That morning, Hermione was perched at the Gryffindor table, reading her copy of the
Harry plucks up the pillow from his bed and props it on the windowsill. Sitting against it the walls of the window sill, Harry settles in for a long night of watching the map.
Harry watches him silently, unsure of what to do. Malfoy was here now and he was unsure if there was anything, he could do to pull him away.
Then, as the meal came to an end, overhead there was the sound of rustling feathers as a flock of bird’s flutter down through the enchanted ceiling’s illusion. Letters and packages were dropped down onto laps, heads, goblets of pumpkin juice, and into waiting hands of excited kids. Several owls settled next to their students, nibbling on their ears and looking for an extra treat for doing a good job.
“Back to work,” He demanded heading back to his desk, whistling softly. Several students dropped their heads down, intent on looking busy lest they get yelled at next. Harry went back to slicing up his Amanita muscaria to the 8
“Several months away.” Ron cut in, wrapping an arm around Hermione, pulling her in close to distract her from refuting, “Come on Hermione it’s clear that Harry is tired, I doubt he would be able to study anyway.” Harry nodded, unable to not notice that Malfoy was staring down at his empty plate, ignoring the world. He wasn’t even bothering to fake like he was interested in eating. Malfoy was just there because he had to be. Ron shifted, blocking Harry’s line of sight towards the blonde man, “Hey how about we do a round of 1 v. 1?”
The Fat Lady looked lovely as always, lounging back in her chaise, playing a card game with some young milkmaid of an unknown painting. The pair didn’t seem surprised to see Harry out in the middle of the night.
Currently, he was standing in a Hall of Glass.
“Actually.” Harry sipped from the cup, running with the feeling in his gut, “I think I am going to the pitch.”
He didn’t know what time it was, all he knew was the moon was high in the sky by the time he was ripped from sleep by nightmares again. Now it was starting to sink again as the next day morning was quickly catching up with him. He walked in a slow stuttering pace, freezing and silently staring at anything little thing that caught his attention.
“I don’t bother people anymore. I haven’t for a while.” He admitted probably louder than he meant to, an almost sad look passing over his features. “Go bother someone else. I’m sure the Weaselette would prefer your incessant bitching, or is she too busy seeing other men now.” Just like that the vulnerability was gone, locked tight behind an angry frown.
“Your, not my handler, Pott head.” Malfoys raised voice pulled Harry's attention back to his angry eyes. He was stepping closer. Completely ignoring his wand on the ground.
Soon, just as his muscles were starting to become sore from paddling, the shore started to come into view under the water. Pulling himself up and out of the water, Harry reapplied the warming charms and a drying spell to keep the chilly fall air from making him shiver. The bank was heavily shaded, the forest giving it that ominous darkness that made it feel like it was constantly night within the trees. The birds had grown even louder now. Their screaming song starting to have more of a beat to it. Harry assumed it was just the specific pattern of that bird, even though he couldn’t make out what type of bird call it was in the least. “Oh man, they only get louder.” Neville jammed a finger into his ear, trying to muffle the volume. Luna stood beside him, head tilted, just staring into the woods.
“I am fine!” He snapped suddenly vicious. All his softness was gone at once and all that was left was the cold cruel tone in his voice Harry was sadly so used to hearing. “Don’t try and mother me Potter.”
“Just get it over with Potter.” With the ever-present air of haughtiness, Malfoy snatched up a broom and sauntered out to the center of the field. Harry was quick to grab his own and chase after the other man.
The Great Hall was heaving with early morning life, like a revving engine that is shifting into 3
Malfoy stared at him like he was offering to start a knitting circle with him. Seeming to remember himself though, Malfoy adjusted his book bag and brushed past hair, “Absolutely not.”
“You really should study Harry the O.W.L.S are-“
Malfoy walked past the Great Hall doors not even wasting a moment to look into the bustling room full of students eating. Harry tried to stop him, “Its dinner time, let’s go eat.”
“Come on, I am hungry.” Maybe food would take his mind off the matter. The incessant nagging was going to drive him up a wall. It took up so much space in his mind, almost every thought seemed to circle back around to it. The smells from the fireplace remind him of the charred Room of Requirements, the flowers made him think about the strange charm still in his pocket, even the boring ache in his back, brought on by professor Bines’ history lectures felt like the splinters of broken objects pressing into his back.
Wand clutched tightly in his hand; Harry slowly started down one of the countless numbers of hallways. Following the path of whomever else was here.
“Malfoy!” Harry yelled at him, snatching the other man’s attention from fussing with some invisible dust on his sleeve. Snapping his head up, Malfoy gave an instant sneer at once he recognized who was yelling at him.
“Why are you hanging around the Room of Requirements?”
clicking the dorm room door closed behind him Harry noted that everyone was still fast asleep when he returned.
Unfolding the map Harry searched the hundreds of names that moved like ants on a picnic blanket. Malfoy’s name wasn’t in the infirmary, or the dorms, or anywhere close to where he ought to be. He was in the Room of Requirements. Harrys mind went on high alert, his leg muscle spasmed wanting nothing more than to run there immediately. He was about to show Ron and Hermione when a question caught his attention.
When this new year started, most decided not to come back. Some out of fear, a minority because they were in prison or on the run, but most simply couldn’t call Hogwarts home anymore. The illusion of them ever being welcomed was shattered as they were forcefully locked down in the dungeons during the battle. Many, once it was over, saw a school that didn’t hold anything for them and the fragile façade of school unity had crumbled alongside the rubble of the school.
“Can you even talk to birds?” Harry had to ask. It seemed like a wild idea but then again, he could talk to snakes so really anything was on the table.
Facing each other, they mounted their brooms, poised to take off. “On the count of Ten,” Harry announced. On the count of five, he let go of the snitch, which zipped out of his grip and views, headed to the sky. Six, he dug his heels in. Seven, tightened his grip ready to rocket off into the sky. Eight, Harry checked to see if there was any flash of golden light. Nine, looking back down he locked eyes with Malfoy’s. Ten!
The grass was a vibrant green, spotted with dewdrops from the early morning dampness, as Harry headed down the hill towards the pitch. Opening up the storage shed, Harry finds the chest of balls, fishing out the slightly tarnish and dented practice snitch. It was slower than they used in actual games, with a bent wing, but unlike the regulation ones, Harry could call it right back to himself if he managed to lose it.
Malfoy didn’t say anything for the longest time, he just sat there rubbing his arms as if he was cold. He was quiet for so long Harry thought he actually hadn’t heard him. Harry began to shift, the stones underneath them becomes incredibly uncomfortable. It might be him for him to go. Just as he was about to stand, Malfoy turned to look at him.
Landing none too gently on the ground, Harry rolls several feet before just laying on the ground, bruised, and heaving great gulps of air. His lung burned and felt amazing. Pushing his body to the limit was such a strong feeling and he craved it constantly. Staring up at the overcast sky and just reveled in the cool dirt bellow him and sweat on his brow.
“I’m not afraid of her or you.” He tried to sound enraged but Harry could see it in his eyes. Malfoy was worried. Shaking his head, Harry backed away.
“It’s okay, Hermione. Just a rough night.” He sipped his drink, enjoying the burn down his throat, just staring at the other students not really interested in anything.
“What I want to know is why was doing the Forbidden Forest?” Harry watched, as their boat pulled further and further away from the shore. Professor Mot, becoming smaller and hazier in the distance, was bent over, doing something to the body.
Once at the front of the room the Professor turning and addressed the entire class, “I will not be handing out house points in this class.” He started, pausing as several students started to whisper conspiratorially. “Your house cup is meaningless to me and it should bloody well be to you too. In this class, you will be making complex and sometimes dangerous potions. Either you do the potions correctly or you get hurt in the process. That should be enough motivation for you to pay attention. You are adults now and there are no brownie points in the real world. Class dismissed.” Just like that he headed for his office, slamming the door behind him on a class full of dumbfounded 8
“You are always tired,” Hermione dismissed him, sparing a wave for the blonde Ravenclaw.
“See I would have assumed that Dumbledore meant people become addicted to the mirror and slowly die simply from not taking of themselves, but look here.” She pointed to a bit of small dense text.
“I have better things to do.” He glared at Harry over his shoulder, picking up the pace to get away from Harry.
Ron snorted, “Well that worked out…” He settled back looking content like the issue was completely settled.
He couldn’t tell if it was a wolf, Fang, or some other dog but from here it looked just like Sirius.
With a frustrated groan, Harry thumps the side of his head against the cool glass of the tower’s window. His eyes ache. He wants nothing more than to just close them and go to sleep; however, whenever he tries, they only seem to ache and burn more. Angry imaginary starbursts scatter against the blackness of his eyelids
“Christ.” Malfoy punched his arm, surprisingly hard. “God – no, I’m not fucking
Malfoy blinked again, a real show of it, and then exhaled and groaned into the back of his wrist. “
There was nothing accusative about it. Ron was looking up at him, eyes clear and sincere. He had grown up so much since Hogwarts that sometimes it almost jarred Harry. He felt his eyes begin to well up again.
"Alright you coward," Malfoy drawled, clearly disappointed, "Rate how good sex is with the Weaslette, on a scale of one to ten, ten being the best and one being shit. It's penetrative sex mind you, none of this oral crap. Of course, getting your cock sucked feels good."
---------------------------------------------------------------------
"Well, what are you expecting us to do? No offence Ginny but I figured it out for myself when Harry hadn't shown up for dinner."
Ginny, however, was struck for a whole new reason.....damn Malfoy's hot! She thought. Him with his perfectly chiseled abs and broad shoulders, defined legs, and.....Merlin, the list goes on. Harry, of course, was perfection. She had seen him naked before and had kissed down his chest, licked his abs....but seeing two ridiculously attractive boys making out with each other was something new altogether. Ginny would be lying if she said she wasn't enjoying it....at least a little bit.
"Come on Jus, we're all waiting," Harry cooed unable to help himself.
"Silence!" Snape snapped at the class, "you will take him Draco and that is final."
"What's wrong with him?" Draco turned to Madam Pomfrey.
Everyone grinned evilly at this as Ron cowered away in embarrassement. Surprisingly it was Malfoy who spoke up.
He yanked the door open to find a fuming Pansy tapping her foot, a scowl etched across her face. "Seriously, Pansy?" Draco glowered, "Do you think that I've got nothing better to do with my life?"
Draco smirked, his snarkiness, however, disappearing once he glanced down at the adorable Gryffindor in his arms. He unconsciously held Harry tighter to his chest as he made his way to the infirmary.
"Always wanted to do this," Draco said whilst he continued to grope Harry's bottom. Harry blushed, "Well then, you should have done it sooner." Just as Harry was about to make another snarky remark, more slick dripped out of his hole and he cried out.
Harry gulped, "Umm...yes."
"Humph, fine. We'll both take our last names. Draco and Harry Malfoy-Potter." Malfoy said, running his hands down Harry's warm back.
Draco could never forgive himself if he hurt Harry. "Patience Harry, I don't want you to get hurt," with that Draco cast a wandless lubricating charm on his prick and up Harry's arse. Harry wriggled as he felt the slick liquid fill him up.
"No, I don't. I've never hated you, Harry, and I never will." Draco said softly, his hands drawing circles on Harry's back. Harry beamed at him, "Me neither, Draco."
"But proffesor-," Hermione started.
Ron snorted, "Harry afraid of getting caught? yeah right. Gin how long have you known Harry? And I doubt this is a spare room. All the prefects have their own rooms."
Harry's face brightened at that. Thank Merlin he wasn't stuck like this forever.
"'Mione, what the fuck?" Ron roared, getting on his feet. "You wanna just sit here and watch, as Harry gets fucked up the arse with Malfoy's cock?"
When Harry arrived at the common room, to find cushions sprawled across the floor, he instinctively tried to rush back up to his dorm, only to find Hermione blocking his away, with her hands on her hips.
"Ron," Dean started innocently, "you cannot by any means say that Harry doesn't have a firm, plump arse."
"Merlin Harry! You're still so tight! Your hole is so greedy you're swallowing my fingers. Arrghhh I can feel my come inside you, god you're so wet!" Harry had had enough of Draco's teasing. The dirty talk was the last straw.
Ron and Ginny were rendered utterly and completely silent.
Ron just shrugged and reached out to touch Harry's other ear. "I admit I wanted to touch them since I first saw them," Ron admitted. Harry didn't have the energy to swat their hands away, so he reluctantly allowed them to continue petting his ears. It did actually feel really good, and soon he was arching into their touch, his eyes closing drowsily and he realized he was squeaking.
"You sure you want to be talking about Weasley while my cock is in your arse?" Draco mused. Harry giggled before wriggling his arse again, earning him Draco's trademark scowl. "Well you started it," Harry said kissing Draco's cheekbones lightly before turning to face away from him, "Go to sleep. We'll talk about it in the morning."
"Ahhhhh" Harry grunted as hands squeezed his arse. "You've got a perky little bubble butt, you know that?" Draco said, kneading the cheeks of Harry's bubble butt. "Nice and firm and round......you need to stop bending over your cauldron in potions and shoving that pert arse into the air. It's your fault my potion blew up today and we both got bathed in slug juice."
Not knowing what else to do, with Harry Potter fast asleep in his arms, Draco opted to staring at them blinking rapidly, not knowing what else to do.
Harry tried to hide his smirk, one of Draco's hands had found its way under his pants and was now fondling his bare arse. "I don't know what you're talking about.......ahhhhh!" Harry cried out as Draco playfully bit the tender skin on his neck.
"That's right," Parkinson called, "When Granger said extreme, she meant it. As usual, we will be using veritaserum, but that's not the extreme part. Everyone should be willing to do the dares, which will be more sexual and possibly dangerous than before. As for truths, questions asked will be far more personal. There will be no exceptions. Is everything clear?"
Seamus was next and Hermione surprisingly went easy on him, daring him to make out with Dean. Seamus had looked pleased, possibly quite happy it wasn't to perform oral sex and had merely said, "No homo mate," before proceeding to sit down on Dean's lap and snog him into oblivion. Throughout the game, Harry witnessed Hannah fingering Luna, Lavender giving Zachariah a handjob, Zabini eating out Pansy's vagina and found out even more about Hermione and Ron's sex life.
"Oh Harry," she said apologetically, "rules are rules, so it's only fair that you have to-"
That's when he heard Madam Pomfrey's voice shooing most of them out. Soon all that remained were Hermione, Ron, and Ginny.
"I saw you running from the great hall," Malfoy explained calmly, advancing on Harry. "I don't think you know this but I was just with McGonagall and she told me to keep an eye on you until you were back to normal."
"Such a filthy mouth, Potter," Draco growled possessively, now fucking Harry with no abandon. "I'll fill you up you wanton slut."
"Nuh-uh," Harry replied, "No way am I ever going to be Harry Malfoy, that sounds so weird and wrong." Harry outwardly cringed.
Thank Merlin for silencing charms. They couldn't leave.....god no they would never hear the end of it. So they settled on ogling at the pair, even though they could look away at any time, they couldn't.
Hermione was just about ready to faint from the utter adorableness and was squealing out loud. "Awwww," he heard her tell Ron in his state of drowsing off, "can we keep Harry like this for a bit longer?"
He ground his cock directly against Harry's over-stimulated prostate. "Ahhhh," Harry cried, his head falling against Draco's shoulder. "Alright, Draco, ahh stop please..."
Draco knew better than to argue with his godfather. He looked at Potter with a disgusting expression, well masking how adorable he thought Potter's tail looked, twitching in its own accord.
"Oh dear!" Madam Pomfrey exclaimed once she caught sight of Harry in Draco's arms. "What happened?" She questioned with wide eyes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
," Hermione stressed, sparing a glance at Harry, "promised to join truth or dare for a month."
At this point, they were fighting back and forth for the stirring rod and Harry knew after last time that this would end badly, but he wasn't going to back away and surrender to Malfoy of all people, his potion's grade be damned.
"You were pretty happy snuggled up against me earlier," Malfoy countered, then he smirked, "You made the most adorable squeaky noises."
"Malfoy! What the fuck!"
Padma sighed loudly and got up. "Oh alright, fine!" she finally surrendered, "Nott get your arse over here and don't expect for a replay."
“It’s even weirder trying to fool around with you knowing that the entire Gryffindor clan is painted on the wall next to us.”
If you're here from my previous fics, suprise surprise it's a different fandom this time :D
“Okay. Good.”, Harry nodded, finishing the last of his tea. He buried his hands in his hair, pulling it back to expose his forehead. His unruly black mop was getting too long again, he either needed to go for a haircut or start tying it back.
“What?!”, Harry huffed so loudly it startled Kreacher who was bringing a grape jelly sandwich. “We were-? Hermione it was the exact opposite! I’m sure Malfoy hates me now for assuming we were on a date. You should’ve seen the look in his eyes when I said it.”
“Um, Malfoy, if you want to I can…”, he gestured towards the door, feeling like an incompetent teen stumbling over his words.
Harry pouted.
“It felt really weird painting myself on your bedroom wall”, Draco mumbled.
day? Is this going to take several days?”, Harry practically cried out when Malfoy started unpacking a can of white stuff, announcing that he’d start priming the wall on this first day.
Almost robotically, Malfoy turned back to face the wall, painting Ron’s hair with small short strokes. “I was just saying how Potter would’ve fit right in at Slytherin.”
loved it when Harry made that little grunting noise in answer to it.
“Harry, you do know that there’s a Malfoy in here…. apparently painting your bedroom.”
He wanted to splutter indignantly and rebuke that statement, but he couldn’t lie to Hermione. She was right, he had been enjoying their casual banter and friendly goofing around. The doorbell rang.
“Took you long enough, two cups of tea. I’m parched.”
“You look like a dog coming out of the rain when you do that.” The amused glint in the blonde’s eyes made clear it wasn’t an insult. He climbed down from the ladder and put his tools down before he started to dig in his pocket.
With impressive speed he gulped down his still piping-hot tea and grabbed another biscuit before bolting out of the door. Harry and Draco listened to his thundering footsteps on the stairs, and then the sound of the door opening and closing.
“I don’t care, it’s still a date as long as we’re together. It doesn’t matter where.”
“Hermione, I think that’s him at the door now.”
“Thank you”, Harry decided to say.
“No. It's a family secret, no telling!”, Malfoy lifted his index finger to his lips in a mischievous shushing gesture. Harry nodded, pretended to lock up his lips and throw away the key over his shoulder.
Harry had just breathed in and out slowly before stepping aside and letting Draco in. Just one mural. He just had to put up with him for a little while and then the blonde apparition from his past would be banned to said past again.
, a sneer Harry thought he’d never hear again. Until today, when he’d opened the door for his new indoor decorator who’d turned out to be Malfoy, Draco bloody Malfoy.
“You’re being very straight-forward today. ‘Saucy’. ‘Ass’. Never thought I’d hear that from you”, Harry grinned.
house. Shouldn’t you act politely?”
Harry sat down, unable to wipe the grin off his face. Maybe his trait of randomly spewing thoughts wasn’t that bad.
“What are you smiling about, Potter?”
He was wearing black fitted trousers and a vest with silver embroidery, flamboyant as ever. Harry frowned and looked down at his itchy old sweater.
guy standing on the small ladder leaning against his bedroom wall. The guy that was the cause of this weird situation Harry was stuck in, feeling totally out of place in his own house. That guy, who was now standing with his hand on his hip, lower lip jutted out into a sneer.
Hello!!
“It turned out that I had a talent, and I really enjoyed painting. It’s something you can focus on with your hands without having to think about anything else except for the very next step in your process. I liked that-”, Malfoy was taking out a pencil to continue sketching over the primer, “-and I’ve liked painting and dyeing stuff since I was young. I always helped mother paint her bangs white.”
Harry huffed and rolled his eyes, biting at Malfoy’s collarbone from where he was laying on the blonde’s chest. “Conceited twat.”
Thus started the courting of Malfoy and Potter. The most unlikely duo to get together after Hogwarts, yet fate proved otherwise. The painting was finished, but that didn’t stop Harry from inviting Draco over. At first, he needed excuses to lure the wizard to Grimmauld Place;
“Weasley”, Draco shot up and regained his stiff composure.
Malfoy laughed. He
Malfoy’s sharp jaw relaxed when he realised Harry had never seen this process before. “I have to infuse the primer with magic, don’t worry about the wand”, he dug out the correct wand-attachment from his collection and fastened it to the tip: a broad brush add-on. And just like that, his wand had transformed onto a paint-brush, the hawthorne wood being the handle. Again, he dipped it into the primer, this time submerging the bristle hairs.
Inching up an eyebrow, the blonde nodded. He sniffed at his drink, and seemed content at the new expensive tea Hermione had sent over. He even took a biscuit, clearly in a good mood today. It made Harry’s heart skip a beat, watching the man warming his hands on his mug and nibbling away at the treat.
“And a biscuit”, the redhead squeaked, staring at the scene that was unfolding right in front of him. Harry. And Malfoy. Harry had smiled at Malfoy. Malfoy was painting what seemed to be a portrait of him.
to act civil around each other? I didn’t really have any hard feelings left after Hogwarts, and I’d like to keep it that way.”
“If you’re going to keep staring I’ll get embarrassed, Potter.”
“What are you doing?!”
was such a lovely view. Harry sighed.
The popcorn roses were strung onto a thread as if it was Christmas and hung as a caramel and rose-scented garland in Grimmauld’s parlour.
He’d sworn the blonde was looking at him as if he’d grown horns. He also made a show of first scratching at his eyebrow, very investidly looking underneath his fingernail and tapping at his chin before giving Harry his response. “Fi-ne.”
“Harry you’re going to have to repeat yourself, the music in this lobby is obnoxiously loud.”
The mural was alive with colour and magic, the painted people on it were oh-so detailed and oh-so happy to walk around in the forest scenery Malfoy had painted around them. The little mural trees swayed when you walked past them, and on the edges of the mural flowers, toadstools or snowflakes appeared according to the season.
“It’s going to be hard to find something we agree on, but what do you have in mind?”, the blonde dawdled.
“Yes please, Draco Malfoy”.
“There, done.”
Harry wished he’d researched this better beforehand. But he wasn’t of the researching kind, more of the act-think-later type. Malfoy went on unperturbed, casting a Scourgify onto the wall before opening up the lid of the primer can and dipping his wand in. Wait-
“Thanks.”
Harry trotted over and started examining the painting standing right next to Malfoy, quite purposefully brushing their shoulders together. “The other ones seem less energetic?”
He scratched at his stomach and laughed a little at the image of Hermione angrily staring down the poor lobby clerk at her hotel. Lounging in the bedroom, he'd decided to call Hermione to vent about his Malfoy-problems. The music in the background of the call died down considerably.
“This guy won’t stand still.”
“Ron, sit.”, Harry patted the lounge seat next to him. Ron sat, and immediately stuffed his mouth with a biscuit.
“Harry-um. I just came to give you this actually”, he slid two tickets for his next Quidditch game over the coffee table. “I’ll catch up with you later.”
They plopped down and awkwardly started shuffling their belongings around, trying to find a spot for their arm on the shared arm rest. Malfoy had donned a black cap to shield his sensitive eyes against the sun and Harry couldn’t stop looking at him. Malfoy in casual clothes was a miracle he’d never witnessed before.
The green eyes widened considerably. “Really?”, he tried to tame his excitement, but couldn’t.
Harry hummed.
A goal was made and everybody stood up to cheer, but Harry remained frozen in his seat. His stomach churned at the thought of possibly several hours more in the company of Malfoy, now that he’d single-handedly ruined the entire friendly atmosphere with that forsaken comment.
“Let’s just
Hermione and Parvati were gone, Luna and Neville were apparently busy planting Alihotsy and Aconite. So it was only logical that Harry had invited Draco to Ron’s Quidditch match, right? He had two tickets after all, he didn’t want one going to waste. Occupied by these thoughts, Harry hadn’t noticed they’d arrived at their seats in the stadium until he bumped into Malfoy.
“He said he almost couldn’t stomach you two lovebirds staring at each other during the match but that he’d accept it if it made you happy.”
“Ah yes, the Malfoy thing. Ronald flooed me about it.”
Malfoy was surveying him, looking down on him. Literally, he was standing a metre or so higher thanks to the stepladder.
The exact opposite of Harry’s new free mindset was Malfoy’s closed-off one. Once, Harry had made a joke about giving Draco a suppository for his emotional constipation, which had earned him an angry look and scoff. But Harry persevered.
“Madame Malkin. McLaggen….. McGonagall?”
He noticed Malfoy gawking at him from the corner of his eye. He seemed just as flabbergasted as Harry felt.
Draco huffed, turned and started walking away briskly in embarrassment, but didn’t let go of Harry's hand.
had popped up for him. Magic murals turned out to be large paintings carefully created onto walls with magic-infused paint, moving and changing over time. Almost like the magic portraits at Hogwarts, but without their frame and talkative residents. The people in murals only moved and interacted with the others in their scene, not with the outside world. Anyways, Harry hadn’t expected Malfoy to show up, with cans of paint in his hands.
“Sirius, Remus, Tonks, my parents, Hermione and Parvati, Luna and Neville, Ron and the other Weasleys, Hagrid and-”
And thus the adventure began, the following days Malfoy came knocking at Grimmauld Place’s creaky door, Harry brought him tea and biscuits and then he started painting and sketching along the wall. Three days had passed like that, and Harry discovered that he quite enjoyed the small talks he got out of tea-time with Malfoy, it had been a while since he’d talked so leisurely with someone. After all, Hermione had left on a vacation to Vietnam with Parvati, sending pictures of herself in the mail with her girlfriend smiling beside her or kissing her cheek. Ron was busy with Quidditch, as always, and Luna and Neville were too occupied by their new garden project, whatever that may be. Ergo, Malfoy had become his new favourite conversation partner. ‘Ergo’, was something he’d learned from the blonde, who casually sprinkled Latin throughout his explanations.
“Isn’t it a bit weird to have an image of myself in my bedroom?”, Harry mumbled, trying not to stare at the frown of concentration on Malfoy’s handsome face.
Again, Malfoy rolled his eyes, a gesture he seemed to favour at least once per minute. He stalked over to Harry and handed him the hair tie.
“Is this a date?”
Malfoy stretched his wand-arm which sometimes cramped up after painting for a while.  “Are you so happy to get me out of your hair?”
Malfoy was still staring at him from his elevated position in the room. His eyes were following Harry’s movements, and a remark seemed ready at his lips. But he swallowed it, together with a gulp of tea. “So, what theme did you have in mind?”, the painter asked, turning back to the wall to touch it, trying to estimate how much priming it would need.
The steam rising from the mugs on his platter was fogging up Harry’s glasses, and it was already difficult enough just balancing the tray properly on his way up Grimmauld Place’s wonky stairs. Let alone blind. He managed to get the two cups of tea upstairs without tripping. Peeking from behind a door, Kreacher was staring holes into his back.
And that’s how they’d ended up here, Malfoy on a stepladder assessing the wall and slurping his tea with a frown while Harry stood a few steps further, blowing on his own hot drink.
, but then the fog on his glasses, yet again caused by carrying the tea upstairs, disappeared. His vision cleared.
“Draco, Kreacher said he really missed you and wanted to see you.”
“Good luck Harry! I’m sure you can resolve that awkwardness.”
“I’m-”
“Merlin, Potter. You just say anything that comes to mind, don’t you?”
Harry looked up and grinned at him. “How do I look?”
Merlin, he was going absolutely bonkers.
Draco laughed, turned back to the now eggshell-plastered wall and started drawing intricate shapes and profiles Harry couldn’t distinguish just yet. The ideas Malfoy held for this wall were still a secret to the owner of Grimmauld Place.
“It must’ve been you, I don’t even know fancy charms like these”, Harry smiled as he investigated one of the popcorn roses.
“Of course, you id-... Potter. I have to prime the wall, come up with an idea, get the right colours, make a sketch, fill it in, correct mistakes,... It takes at least two weeks.”
“What am I supposed to do with this?”
“Shall I add a Gryffindor crest while I’m at it?”
Ron choked.
“No, no. I still need you for my hair”, Harry pointed at the bun on top of his head Malfoy had made this morning.
Harry frowned at the
“Don’t let me interrupt your...conversation.”, he mumbled around the pumpkin pinwheel.
As the days turned into a week, everybody at Grimmauld Place seemed quite content with the current arrangement. Harry had someone to talk to. Kreacher had an excuse to try out every biscuit recipe he knew, and Malfoy… well he was getting paid. Harry shrugged. The blonde hadn’t shown the same stiff uneasiness from that first day anymore, so he assumed Malfoy had started feeling a bit more comfortable.
“I told the Master that I should help! I had to open the door for the Master, or else he would’ve spilled the tea all over, Kreacher’s sure!”
Real Harry smiled. “I’m glad you’re here.”
Almost painfully quickly Harry snapped his head towards the front, gulping down his iced pumpkin juice to hide his embarrassment. Ron flew by the tribunes, waving at him as he always did before the game really started. He’d probably make a remark about Harry bringing Malfoy along with him on a Quidditch date after the match. Wait-
A long, relieved sigh squeezed past Harry’s stiff lips, making him sound like a steaming kettle. “Thanks. I appreciate it."
It was such a surprisingly sweet statement, Harry raised his eyebrows and grabbed the last cookie to hide his surprise. Draco hadn’t touched the shortbread. As the last piece left the plate when he picked it up, the tray with their empty cups disappeared with a soft ‘plop!’, he was quite sure Kreacher was behind this.
“Ok so-”, Draco held up his hands, “-Basically every Gryffindor on earth and Luna Lovegood.”
“Quite nice.”
The blonde eyed the hairdo in question, and oh so carefully, even more carefully than when he had painted the petite boots on the mural people, he brushed an escaping strand of black hair behind Harry’s ear. His hand stayed there for a few exasperating seconds, but just when Harry wanted to lean his cheek into it he pulled away. With a shaky breath Draco dipped his brush into the paint again and continued.
Malfoy huffed and nodded. “So just tell me what you want, I’ll make sure you’ll get something nice.”
“Thank you. Give Parvati a hug from me. Remember to use sunscreen and-” Malfoy stalked into the room, Kreacher had probably opened the door for him. “Love you lots, bye!”, Harry hurriedly slammed down the receiver and rolled down from the bed, pulling his wrinkly shirt down.
He pointed his wand at Harry’s head, and for a fraction of a second Harry thought
And in the middle of the Muggle shopping street, they kissed. Malfoy tasted like the fizzy drink he’d sipped in the theatre. Harry slid his hands around Draco’s neck, enlacing his fingers to keep the other man close. Draco only had to bend down a little to meet Harry’s enthusiastic kisses.
“No, I mean. Why did you…. Why did you wink at me like that?”
Sometimes their daily talks were about the weather or the tea or the mural. Other times, Harry managed to pry little bits of information out of Malfoy, he discovered tads of stories and personality quirks that turned Malfoy into… into Draco. The blonde talked about how his father’s peacocks used to run after him as a child, chasing him around the Manor. With his eyebrows furrowed in concentration, he talked about how he’d always been surprised Harry didn’t end up in Slytherin. And one day, when he was charming paint into just the right red colour for Ron’s hair and talking about Slytherin once again, someone stormed into the room. It was the person who was being painted at the moment.
“Lapis Lazuli.” The portrait unlocked and slowly swung open, a warm gust of heat from the common room being released out into the halls. Harry could hear the last crackles of the dying fires in the common room as he crawled through the portrait hole. The room was empty, the homework wasn’t intense enough yet to demand the all-nighters of the students.
He really didn’t want to care but his mind kept circling back to it. Any distraction would be greatly appreciated.
“No, but I can tell them what you’re doing.”
“How could it or anything survive that inferno?” Ron shuddered remembering that horrible Hellfire.
“Harry, I think you are worrying a bit too much. You should return that to him. It looks precious.” She handed back the necklace, watching as he tucked away once more.
“Who cares what he is doing with the mirror,” Ron’s irritated voice broke him out of his memories. “Are we really comfortable with Malfoy running around at night?” Ron exclaimed putting all his emphasis on the night “Who knows what he could be doing and that’s just more reason for you to go to McGonagall right now.”

“Alright, you Rat Bastards, sit down and shut up!” Came a booming voice from the back of the room as the door slammed open, banging against the wall. In strode a man, with tightly shaved red hair so bright he looked to be part of the Weasley family tree. His voice was the kind of transatlantic effect that hinted at the man hopping between England and America for a while, or at least he wanted you to think that. A thick pungent smoke, pouring from a cigarette in his mouth, seeming to hang around him like a fog,
“How long until the mural is done?”, he was planning to ask Malfoy out for a real date afterwards.
To hear the word ‘saucy’ tumble from Malfoy’s mouth. Malfoy’s thin-lipped but soft-looking mouth. Oh Merlin, what was he thinking?! Harry shook his head to get the thoughts out, a habit he picked up when Voldemort was still in his mind.
It was true, painting-Ron and painting-Hermione were laughing at painting-Harry’s antics, but not moving around as much as he did. “Even your mini version is a pain in the ass, Potter.”
Days passed, cookies were eaten and tea was sipped. Again, Harry caught himself really looking forward to Malfoy’s visits, even if they were work-related visits. He looked forward to Malfoy walking towards him, combing his hair out of his face with his elegant fingers and securing it in place with a hair-tie. He looked forward to watching Malfoy work, face scrunched in concentration at the artwork. It was such a lovely view.
“Just nice?”, Harry mockingly trapped the tip of his tongue between his teeth.
Honestly, Harry felt like he’d wandlessly stupefied himself after that question just slipped out of his mouth.
“You admire me?”
Harry always complained about Draco’s cold hands and cold feet, but when they were entangled in a kiss, he pressed up against his cold boyfriend as much as he could. He laughed breathily when Malfoy turned them over, the blonde now hovering over him and eagerly covering all of those breathy laughs with his lips. His pale cheeks had turned rosy and his hands were all warmed up, while their tea on the coffee table had gone cold, long forgotten in favour of each other.
Malfoy stepped back and stared right into Harry’s eyes. “I wonder if they’re more of an emerald green or rather a jade green?”, he tapped his index finger against his chin.
“How outrageous! I didn’t know muggles were so strict…”, Malfoy fumed as they were walking home.
He plopped down at the authority in the blonde’s voice. And stood right back up when said blonde started walking towards him. When he reached Harry, he grabbed hold of a portion of his hair and started tying it back. His eyes darted over the face of the boy-who-lived.
The blonde lifted his wand from the white liquid, the tip now coated in it. “What?”
Harry couldn’t do anything but gesture at what was happening wordlessly.
Today, it was a special lotus tea from Vietnam -courtesy of Hermione- and empire biscuits -courtesy of Kreacher- which Harry was balancing on his tray. When he reached the door, it swung open, this time because Malfoy had heard him coming up the age-old stairs.
Harry was struggling to envision Goyle painting mandalas and flowers to find inner peace, but he tried to keep a straight face.
“Potter? I think I just had a hearing malfunction.”
Was this a déjà-vu? Why was he stuck in this cycle of saying things he wasn’t supposed to say? Did someone hit him with a blabbermouth-curse? The worst thing was, yet again, Malfoy was gawking at him as if he’d just told him the apocalypse was starting in a few minutes. Frankly, this situation wasn’t that far off.
Malfoy scolded him with a harsh look. “Don’t get ahead of yourself.”
“No, I guess not.” Draco removed his hands from underneath Harry’s sweater and used them to pull the Boy-Who-Lived up in his embrace. Harry’s hair was getting long enough to braid, and Draco was glad he’d done so this morning. Otherwise, he would’ve been buried in his black curls by now. Harry grinned his signature grin at him. It made Draco pull him down for a kiss, which soon turned into a proper snog. From their first kiss onwards, Draco had decided that he absolutely loved to trap Harry’s lower lip between his own, and he
Harry scuffled around the room, settling down into one of the sofa chairs around the coffee table. He stuffed a biscuit into his mouth and revelled in Malfoy’s look of disgust as some crumbs fell down onto his lap and the sofa. “The mural is a replacement for the Black-family tapestry, so I’m thinking something family-related as well. But more of my own family, instead.”
“That isn’t her natural hair?”, Harry gasped. Such revelations were being spilled this afternoon.
As if Malfoy would ever want to go on a date with him. He tried to take another swig of juice, but was met only by ice cubes.
“If you’d seriously expected that old bat to show up here to paint your wall, you’re more of a dimwit than I already knew you were.”
Indoor decorator was the wrong term, actually. A few days ago, he’d phoned a small company that advertised their excellent mural-making skills. Because that’s what he needed, a mural. Together with Hermione, he’d torn out the old magic family tapestry on the bedroom wall of Grimmauld Place. That tapestry Sirius despised so much, that tapestry where some people had been burned away because they weren’t behaving ‘Pureblood’ enough. Feeling the old fabric tear away from the wall had been so satisfying, even though it had stirred up a huge cloud of dust and an accompanying fit of coughs. Kreacher had wept, small fists clenched at his side but unable to do anything to save the image of his dear old Masters and Mistresses. To console the poor house elf, Harry had promised to decorate the wall anew, with another magical moving scene.
“Draco, I leaned against the painting and made a smudge.”
At the very end Harry had managed to persuade the painter to add a little version of himself as well, resulting in a painted, usually grumpy little Malfoy leaning against one of the trees, reading a book. Mini-mural-Harry loved doing cartwheels around him.
Rolling of eyes. “Blaise has been growing out his hair, it almost reaches his ass now.”
“I can
“He looks way better in green than in red, too.”, the painter continued. He looked over his shoulder, amused by Ron’s red face. He even threw a wink at Harry, which made the cough-like choking sounds even worse. Harry had to hit him on the back a few times.
Harry entered the room and put down the tray on that cute little coffee table Luna had bought him. Finally, he could wipe his glasses on his sweater, and enjoy proper eyesight once again.
“Why are you wearing such fancy clothes when you’re the one working with paint?”
Harry felt like punching himself. Should he stay in the room like always? Would Malfoy prefer it if he sat down? The painter was quietly unpacking his brushes and paint.
“Huh, what did he say?”, he rolled over onto his stomach. Hermione was one of the only friends he still called with a muggle phone instead of using the Floo system, but he quite enjoyed the feel of the receiver and the charm of an occasional hum on the telephone line.
Draco nodded and licked a crumb away from his thumb. “Well… Let’s see.”, he pondered as he put down his tea and started unpacking his materials. Brushes, paints, mixing sticks and more. “After the Fiendfyre and the Battle, Goyle was having some trouble processing all of it and his mother sent him to a therapy painting class, I accompanied him.”
“I thought you were supposed to be the cool, composed one”, Harry laughed. Mini-mural-Harry seemed to agree and did a celebratory cartwheel to prove it.
When they parted, Harry hiccuped and started laughing. Draco furrowed his brow and blushed. The popcorn left in the bucket had been transfigured into little pink roses, some of them unfinished with popcorn petals instead of flower ones. One of the wizards had used magic accidentally, as if they were 12 again and unable to control their emotions.
“It's starting, you might want to look at the game instead of gawking at me”, the blonde mumbled between pursed lips.
“Oh… Oh Harry I’m sorry. I know you really wanted to become friends with him.”
The painter turned back to start mixing his paint into the perfect Harry-Potter-Eyes green. “I was under the impression that it might’ve been a date.”
“I could’ve done that, Master…”, he grumbled, clearly displeased.
“It’s called
Harry frowned. “That might be a bit tacky, no?”
“Oh! A story would be so cool, can you do that?”, Harry scratched at his forehead again. He should really buy some hair ties.
“It won’t be complete without you in it, trust me.”
”, Malfoy stopped abruptly, pulling Harry back with the hand he was still holding. He enunciated his date’s name very clearly, rolling the r’s. “Harry Potter, can I kiss you?”
‘This guy’ turned out to be Harry’s counterpart on the painting, who couldn’t stand still while Malfoy tried to paint his cloak. Mini-Harry hopped around and jumped up and down, or enthusiastically waved at the other people in the painting. Draco cursed under his breath when his brush slipped.
“No, actually, I admire you for that. Saying what you want to say, having the courage to do so.”
Harry fled.
“Foul-mouthed idiot.”
“It’ll be done after I finish it with a protective layer, so that would be the day after tomorrow.”
Draco wanted to fight back with another retort, but it died down when he saw the smile in Harry’s eyes. “You don’t mind that I’ve ruined our date?”
“I was just complaining about how awkward I’d made things with my indoor decorator, ‘Mione.”
“Why?”
Laughing, Harry pressed a kiss onto the collarbone he’d attacked earlier. They were cuddling on the sofa, admiring the finished artwork. Draco’s hands had wandered underneath Harry’s sweater, stealing warmth. In turn Harry had buried his head into the crook of Draco’s neck, nuzzling at him and basking in the scent of his expensive perfume. “I’m glad you added yourself after all”, he sighed.
“Quite?”
“Like an idiot pineapple”, Malfoy grinned back.
Malfoy shrugged as if it was nothing, but the back of his ears were slowly turning red. “Why not. I like talking with you. You’re kinda funny. You look…”, he turned back towards Harry, eyeing him up explicitly. “Nice.”
“Did I accidently cast a wandless ‘Stupefy’? Why are you standing there like that, Potter?”
That last endeavour had resulted in them getting kicked out of the cinema because Malfoy had screamed when the 3D dragon had leapt out of the screen. Luckily Harry was holding his hand, otherwise the blonde would’ve pulled out his wand to sling a hex towards the cinema screen. The screaming could’ve been excused, but the cursing afterwards couldn’t, so a very nervous teen employee asked them to leave the theatre.
“I love it. I love that – I love that it’s blue.”
Malfoy said, distinct even through all the obstacles, and Harry tightened the grip on his throat. He rolled again.
He looked up at Draco.
Harry responded by throwing one of the books at Draco’s head. Draco swore through his laughter, and then picked himself up, his palms pressing into the ground. His eyes were wide and excited.
“Right,” said Charlie and clapped his hands together. “Who’s next?”
These were all things that Harry thought as they walked to the Green Hotel, and as they walked, he remembered why he didn’t often let himself think.
“…and then if I have nature and art and poetry, and if that is not enough, what is enough?”
“Paths,” said Harry. Malfoy was really looking at him now. He ignored him.
Kissing became such a transformative thing when knowledge was there. When Harry kissed Draco, he thought about all the little things that made him up, like his leggings and the way he spoke and his dragon and the movement of his wrist as he gelled through his hair – and the way he tried, the way he always seemed to be trying, so hard and so earnest it was like a natural energy moving with the earth. When Draco kissed Harry back, it was a similar thing. His pale hand came up and brushed the ridge of Harry’s jaw, right where you could it open. His tongue pressed into Harry’s lower lip, and then slipped inside. It was a consummation. His teeth bit down on the flesh. Harry was hard in his jeans.
“Not if I’m gagged.”
Malfoy was still trying to smother his giggling behind one hand. When he finally reached composure, he looked over at Jane and locked eyes with her.
Draco laughed. It was a breathy little laugh, one that Harry felt on the back of his ear.
“Yes,” said Oceania, “Don’t worry. You’ll learn to keep up.”
“I’m good.” Harry leaned back on the counter.
After a moment, he coughed. “Oh,” he said weakly. “Right.”
Harry rolled his eyes again, harder, though it probably wasn’t so effective when his face was still red. But god, it wasn’t like it was his fault. Malfoy
“Today,” said Oceania, with great feeling. “We will not be having bao zi for breakfast.  Oh. Oh no. We will be having,” she took a moment to raise her arms for effect, “Porridge!”
Draco was gone a long time. Once Harry was almost certain he wasn’t going to cry, he got up and went over to the training room. Draco was standing with his arms crossed, staring at the mats like he was trying to forgive them.
“You wanted to know.”
Malfoy said,” Shall I pick it up for you?” His voice was softer than Harry had expected, and it was like missing a step in the dark.
infused moon fragments, and they sent halos rippling down over Malfoy’s marmoreal forehead. Harry wanted to dip his fingers in it.
And how femininity could be this terrifying thing – a place where love and violence overlapped like lips over teeth, and teeth over tongue – and how everyone knew that girl’s bodies could be soft and beautiful, and that they wobbled all over when they loved – but failed to understand how a woman’s back could snap in pleasure like some kind of injury, how slender fingers could coil around bed sheets and hair in some kind of unrestrained destruction – and how orgasm could feel like some violent, torturous thing, when the woman you love cannot reach you, cannot touch you through all your wobbling, rounded flesh; and try as you might bind yourself to love to save you, all that ever comes of it is this breaking, be it your shell or your bones.
“Potter,” he said. “Nice to see you here.”
“Your Highness?” he said, raising a brow as he held out one hand. Oceania giggled and took off her shoes. She reached for Harry, who promptly gave her his hand as well. There was a brief struggle and lots of groaning as she attempted to balance herself on top of Draco’s thigh.
Harry blinked at the abruptly empty room, trying to figure out how the mood had switched so quick. Had he gone too far?
The sheets were crinkled under his limbs. Textured, steady. The ceiling above him had mountains painted on it.
“Cool.” Oceania jumped to her feet. “Let’s go then Harry.”
“Stop it.”
“I thought that’s why you asked me to lunch,” Draco said. “Because you’d seen it on me.”
“Is there a difference?”
Harry started. Malfoy had set his glass down, and was looking directly at Harry. Harry blinked.
“I heard about Jane,” Malfoy said after a moment. “Charlie told me.”
,” said Draco, and then he scrambled up, sitting back on Harry’s thighs. “Yes, how, how do you want me? Do you want me like this? Do you want me –”
“Tell me why,” he said.
And Malfoy is too. The rest of it is a complete act – it’s like a set-up, like a porn movie, like a fantasy – all coy eyes and crude words and lingerie – Malfoy will bat her eyes as she asks whether Harry would rather be swallowing a dick right now instead of sticking her tongue inside her. But when Malfoy is on the floor, moaning, gasping, eyes scrunched up and nose all wrinkly as she tells Harry how much she needs it, how much she wants it, how she needs it harder – Harry believes it then.
“Mm,” she agreed. “That does sound like a spiritual awakening.”
Harry drank. It was lukewarm in his mouth.
“None of that. Body part stuff. It doesn’t matter.”
“Okay,” Harry agreed.
“You say his name like he’s famous.” There was a glass of water next to her elbow. She didn’t offer it to him. “I mean, mostly I was joking. Now I’m not so sure.”
Draco swallowed. It looked like a difficult action on him. “I mean,” he said. “This isn’t permanent. I meant what I said the first time. I’m not just…giving up everything for you. I have a life.”
“What The Fuck,” he said emphatically, slowly raising his hands from his head back up to the sky. “Does That Even Fucking Mean.”
Once, she walks in on Malfoy as she is doing the dishes. She’s got a dressing gown on – fluffy and baby blue – and her hair is up in loose bun. Her face is scrubbed clean, and when she looks up Harry realises she’s wearing glasses.
Draco just nodded. He looked away into the fire. “I know I – that I’ve sometimes said things to you that made it seem like perhaps…I don’t think highly of you. But I – I do, Harry. You have been – and are – so much more than I expected. And I’m proud of you.”
Eventually Harry slumped onto his back, and opened his eyes to stare up at the ceiling. There was a small constellation in the right-hand corner of it.
Malfoy raised his head. His grumpy expression was upset upon witnessing Charlie’s inebriated state, at which he raised an amused brow.
Oceania stayed with Jane for a few more moments, and then stood up. She looked over to Harry and beckoned.
Draco’s mouth parted, a little like a gasp. Harry stood and checked the syrup – it had almost burned again – then summoned it, the whiskey, the bitters, the egg white, the lemon juice and the ice all into the shaker. He rolled his sleeves up and shook it, hard.
Luna just nodded and tilted her head back, looking at the sky. The sunlight filtered across her face. “I think it would be very nice,” she said, “if we were all friends.”
“I didn’t say you weren’t capable of love,” said Harry. He was leaning back from Malfoy’s sharp gaze.
The line of Draco’s mouth curled a little at the edges, like damp paper. “The sand mandala,” he said. “Are you telling me you’re just standing here, without a clue as to what’s going on?”
“It doesn’t matter if you’re on the team,” said Harry. “I’m not seeing him again.”
Another flick and bonds come up and wrap themselves over Harry’s limbs, holding her in place. She struggles to catch her breath, head ringing.
After the war, he had moved north. He had bought a flat. He hadn’t wanted to stay in Grimmauld Place. It was too full of memories. There had been something brimming in him, asking for a new start. He had wanted to live a new sort of life.
Sometimes, he felt like Malfoy noticed everything. Like Malfoy could see deeper into Harry than Harry could himself. He had said he was good at finding paths into people, and Harry believed him.
“The Mac one is fine, thanks.”
“Why aren’t you up there?” asked Harry. “On the stage. Performing.”
“Urm,” said Harry hesitantly. “I…need these.”
“No.” Malfoy repeated the whole process to his other eye.
“Slowly, bring yourself back up,” said Oceania. Her voice was softer and quieter during the yoga sessions than any other time. “Take your time.”
“Were you still gay, when you were a cricket?” Hayden asked, smiling.
Harry caught the vase on reflex and shot Malfoy a sidelong look while he did it. “I think you’re just supposed to look,” he said lightly.
Oceania looked so thrilled he considered letting her dress him everyday. And then abruptly re-considered approximately thirty seconds later.
“I do,” said Hayden. “But I also know how much I’d like some blue cheese, especially on my bao zi in the mornings.”
“Bringing out the Potter-ing, are you?” Harry muttered, and then raised both his arms to the sky. “Meadcow,” he declared.
“This,” he said, and then he paused too. “Can’t you feel it?”
“Oh,” said Harry. He felt like a teenager being told that his extended family were coming to visit for a week, and that he was going to have to share his room with a cousin he hadn’t talked to in years. Not that he personally knew what that felt like.
“Oh.” Malfoy took that in. “Well, you can hardly have expected me to pull out a whip in a deli.”
Harry laughed, not expecting it. Malfoy looked over and smiled at him, all traces of animosity gone.
He gasped, clawing at his head again. He was never going to get back up. He was never going to get out of here. He was never going to –
She shrugged, a playful movement. “You’re opening. Don’t you think?”
“You know it’s not your fault, right?” Malfoy’s became a hushed, urgent murmur. “It’s not your fault. Dragons are a sensitive species. These things happen. It’s common. All the time. It’s not anybody’s fault.”
The whole situation is located at the remote end of a remote village on the Scottish island of Raasay. Less than two hundred people live here. There is grass, and sea, and plenty of sheep.
Harry laughed. “Urm,” he said.
“Yeah,” said Harry. He sort of wanted to nose Draco’s long, white neck.
All Draco had wanted to do earlier was look away, but now it was like being trapped in a serpent’s gaze. Harry was in front of him, his hands reaching. Sitting down, he was taller. His hands were on Draco’s hips. His thumbs were curving around to press at the silk over Draco’s inner thighs. Slowly, slowly, they slid outwards, parting Draco’s legs.
“Oh, Draco,” she murmurs. “Draco, Draco, Draco.”
“No need to get defensive.”
Mercifully, Hayden took it upon their self to change topic, and asked Malfoy about his dragon.
“Do you know anyone who speaks English?” Harry said, starting to feel a little agitated when he felt a firm hand clasp his shoulder. He whirled around.
“Are you in counselling?” she demanded after a moment.
“It’s a gift,” said Malfoy. “I put the word in my mouth and imagine sucking cock as I take it back out.”
“Sometimes I swear you just love to fight,” said Draco. He was standing up, straightening his leggings with his free hand. In the other, he was barely keeping his cup of tea from visibly trembling.
Harry closed his eyes. The sunlight poured insistently against his skin, the red of his blood lighting up like a lantern through his lids. The grass tickled against his open palms. He was beginning to understand what he had to do now. The knowledge dawned like the raw blaze of the Scottish sun, cresting over familiar mountains.
Harry squinted at it and then let his eyes fall closed. The beating in his head echoed the monks with their drums down in the village below.
Malfoy grinned, his eyes appraising. “Okay,” he said. “Yeah, you are.”
As they waited for the shots, they all watched Oceania reach for Malfoy’s milkshake and pour half of it into hers. Malfoy sighed, but allowed it.
Harry let out a ragged breath, slipping his hands down from his face. The air was cool on the dampness of his cheeks. Malfoy’s middle finger tapped two feathery beats against the material of his jumper.
He stood up and crossed the room. Felt for his jacket and shoes. He could turn the light on, but it didn’t feel right.
Harry did.
Harry looked at him. Draco hoped he didn’t notice how rehearsed the words sounded. His eyes had deepened though, and it happened so rarely – once, when Draco had asked for his respect, once, when he had been high and it had been in his voice, when he had said, “I saved you” – but whenever it did, Draco felt that it was like suddenly the two of them fell into sync, a perfect connection reaching out and back in like a threaded needle – so sharp and perfect it could prick through anything, any skin.
“How did you know that I appreciate art?” he asked.
“I don’t know if I want you to. Seriously, it’s like a squirrel storing nuts or something. You know we’re not going to run out, right?”
He was so fucking grateful.
“There they are,” said Harry.
Harry hesitated. Tom said, “Are you okay with Draco being here?”
At this, Zambini stopped looking polite and taken aback and started looking very amused instead, which was a far more honest expression on him.
“I thought it wasn’t a choice,” he said.
Maybe there was no home. Only the endless coming.
“This isn’t exactly scraggly undergrowth,” said Harry, once they’d arrived. He was standing in front of a set of logs that had been sliced in half to make benches, all arranged around a black circle which was clearly the fire place. Oceania was already there.
“I love yours too,” she said smiling, and curled into him. Grateful, his body met hers, entangling itself. It had been starving for human closeness. It knew how to love better than his mind.
Luna turned back to the hot chocolate. “Anyway,” she said, “gardening is very good for mental health. I’ve read a lot about it. It’s why a lot of retired people do it.”
It was quite a thing to watch her at work. When Oceania painted, her otherwise dreamy expression focused right in, her entire attention given. It was a little awesome to see a mind otherwise so big dedicated entirely to one cause. Harry wished he could understand where each perfect stroke came from, how every decision was so precisely made – but he could only witness the outlet. The painting was a waterfall, and he was in the wrong position to see what rivers it had led from. No wonder she had run away. For her, art was magic.
He found his suitcase. He flipped it open and started tipping things into it, haphazard and nonsensically. He knew he was acting nonsensically. But just like everything else, he could not control it.
Malfoy was waiting for him in the corridor. His eyes went very big for a few seconds.
Harry blinked.
“No, sure.” Harry stopped looking away and smiled tightly. “If you think it will help.”
“Mate,” said Ron after a long, long silence. “You understand that’s ridiculous, right. Like, no offense – but that’s completely bonkers. Like next level madness. Ridiculous.”
“Well,” he said. “Do you want to try again, or are we done for today?”
Pansy finally looked up at him and raised a brow. “Because,” she said, “it’s a completely different process, and a completely different product.”
“I’m asking you to,” he said quietly.
The waves crash onto the rocks, loud and soft, and Draco Malfoy stands there for a while.
It’s a horrible thing to say, and Malfoy must know it, so Harry leaves the conversation and rolls over, staring at that muted light, and the way it ripples across the folds of the bed sheets.
Ron somehow still manages to start spluttering and coughing, and Hermione is forced to give her boyfriend a couple hard slaps on the back.
“You’re telling me,” said Harry.
“Yeah,” agreed Oceania. “It would.” She sighed happily and leaned against the door frame. “Maybe I’ll kiss Malfoy instead. He’s pretty too.”
Oceania tilted her head to look at him. Her cheeks were still lit up from excitement, and her eyes were bright.
“Ever since I met you here,” he told him, “I kind of stopped believing in normality.”
“You’re still not funny.” Harry eyed up the framed pictures on the wall as he came in. He hadn’t noticed them last time, probably because of the trauma.
“This…” Harry hesitated, checking what he was about to say. If he wanted to help, he had to expose himself, too. “This time, this space you’re experiencing. This is for you. This is your time with yourself. Let your subconscious find you.”
He was sure.
What were they, really? Friends? More than that? Harry rummaged his mind for some reference of description that would fit, but all he could really come up with was
“They apologised,” said Harry. “And they – they’re not bigoted anymore, I don’t think. From the way they talk.”
There wasn’t exactly anywhere to sit on the bed. Harry pushed a breastplate to the side and perched next to the bedside table.
“Before that as well.”
Harry had always supposed that being…
She looks the same as ever – dark skin, thick brows, thin lips – her wide hips, her stocky set of legs, which are slightly apart now, planted so solidly in the ground she looks like she grew out of it. Her hair is longer than it used to be, and her robes billow out around her. They look expensive.
“You’re perfect,” says Harry. “You’re lovel-“
“You know,” he said. “If…if you’re wanting some kind of –
“Damn you! Swim, for fucks sakes.” Harry was panting and spitting. His body felt like it was caving. It was like when he was running, when he’d been running for too long, only worse. A frustrated groan tore through his chest.
Malfoy was breathing quite heavily. He didn’t look at Harry. “Can you let me out?”
The mountains were in the distance. Not so far away that they couldn’t be reached, though.
“Well,” explained Luna. “It requires a lot of reading gardening books.”
Things like speaking, smiling, laughing. They happened, but so often, he had the strange feeling that it wasn’t him that was making them happen. People talked to him, but the words slipped over his skin meaninglessly, and he couldn’t quite understand. The language of socialising felt swollen on his tongue. He had to work to mimic what he saw being exchanged around him.
Harry went back to the hotel. He packed his suitcase again. He unpacked it. He sat on the bed.
“What’s up, bitches!” Oceania suddenly slid into the seat next to Malfoy, startling Harry into leaning back. Hayden appeared to Harry’s right. “What’s up, indeed,” they said, smirking.
Draco didn’t even know why he was typecast as the Dramatic one. At least he was funny when he did it.
Draco keeps on crying, moans turning to whimpers that in some abstract part of her mind she wishes she could put a stop to – and Harry leans down and peppers kisses all over her tear tracks, rocking her back and forth.
Harry swallowed again. He nodded. Oceania drunk some of her tea. The orange sunlight grasped onto the pale skin of her bare elbow.
Draco just smiled wider. “Maybe he’ll have to wear leather jeans now too.  Perhaps with those lovely knee pads you discovered a while ago.”
Delia’s eyebrows floated closer to God. “Some women have dicks,” she said, a little too pointedly.
Harry cocked his head to the side. “I’m sorry,” he said slowly. “What did you just say?”
Harry applauded as she swept off to the side, where there was an iphone lying on top of a pair of huge speakers. She fiddled with the password. A familiar whir of alarm bells rang through the building.
Harry reached out. It shouldn’t have been so charged, the movement of his fingers extending through the air, except now that he had consent, he had to actually do it. He hadn’t really thought about what it would be to touch Draco Malfoy, in his kitchen, on a Friday night. He had thought about what it would mean; not how it would feel.
It’s just…so –”
He dipped his head back down to the milkshake. Malfoy was staring at him, wide-eyed.
“Thank you,” said Harry.
Harry opened his eyes. He didn’t remember making the decision to close them. The mountain they were closest to was cut more profoundly that Harry thought any statue could look.
“Wow,” said Delia into the horrified stillness. “Talk about preparing for a long winter.”
Malfoy shook his head. “I…don’t know how to.” He shrugged and glanced away. “Empty my mind.”
“Hey Harry,” he said, “How’s the bowling?”
“Just.” Harry made a general gesture. “You know. Being here. Dragon-taming.”
“I feel like your idea of smiling might be different from most people’s.”
“Ah,” said Draco. He took a sip of his tea, even though his must be cold too. “I suppose you’ll want to stay over then.”
After a moment he said: “I’m going to have to apologise to him, aren’t I?”
Perhaps that was the crux of the issue. That he couldn’t understand it. It didn’t feel real.
“No,” he said, and swallowed. “What you said was true.”
A glamourous Queen was standing at a microphone, her padded curves swathed in a fishtail gown. Her blonde coiffure was swept up in a classic pageant do. Her eyebrows were drawn on at an angle that made her look permanently appalled with what she saw.
“I’m never kidding.”
He hadn’t been sure when Harry would bring it up, which was why he had only gone to visit him once. It was one of the times Weasley had been there. Harry was, well,
“When you close your eyes,” said Harry, “Pretend that I’m not here. Or that I’m not – you know, me. I’m just – a voice inside you. I’m not something else.”
Harry nodded. Malfoy nodded too, a quick jerky tuck of his chin.
“Okay,” said Harry. “But – we made it out – or hey, maybe it was me, sure – but we made it out as if they were one-dimensional, you know? And they aren’t.”
Oceania beamed again, and produced two more brushes from her hair. They got to work.
Malfoy was having too much fun.
Malfoy was too close. Harry refused to take a step back.
Harry laughed into the table. Blaise said, very wryly, “Do you have any thoughts on spirituality that you’d like to contribute, Harry?”
Her hands curve around Harry’s waist, and she rolls them over so that she’s on top, and they’re facing. She leans in, and the whole world is just her scornful grin, and a silver bullet between teeth.
A tentative hand reached out. Harry felt the knobs of Draco’s spine – up and down and up – through the silk.
Her lips, her hair. She touches her lips and her hair. She touches the same lips that Potter touched, and the same hair that Potter touched, and feels the bloom of her mouth as it stretches over her teeth and digs into her cheeks.
“Of course.” Now Pansy really shot him an incredulous look. “We’re friends. The point is kind of
Hayden looked at him.
Draco gasped, pulling back enough to look at Harry, his eyes wide and hectic. His skin was blushing, something Harry had always found a novelty – but particularly now, so up close. Touching seemed to affect him more than it did Harry. Everything did.
Harry had always thought that religion was an easy way out. But perhaps, if he was clever, he could use it to find a way in.
“I hadn’t realised it would be like this,” he said aloud.
Draco rather wished he would. He kept his face even blanker.
“Have a shower afterwards,” said Oceania, gesturing him forward with her hand, “Otherwise, you’ll just have to take two showers.”
“You’re very pretty,” he blurted out, and then immediately wanted to die.
Perhaps, Harry thought, he’d somehow seen the papers?
Harry could understand why Draco might live here. He would want to live here too, if he was staying longer.
Malfoy’s eyes were moving under his lids. “I want you to say my name.”
“Yes, exactly.”
Malfoy was comfortable wearing makeup. Harry was not. The fact of this made him feel like a child.
Harry stared at Delia. They shared an office, and Harry had grown to sort of timidly like her, despite the fact that she made a point of mentioning the clutter on his own desk every other day. It was the sort of thing Malfoy might do, if he and Malfoy shared an office.
“I don’t know what you mean,” he admitted.
“Osh, darling, I love you. But I’m going to need you to stop right there. Right
Harry bit his lip. “Has he read it as well?”
Harry took a deep breath. He looked over at Draco’s lovely legs, only successfully avoiding smiling through sheer strength of will.
“Because.” Draco shrugged his shoulders, incredulous. His eyes were still very wide. “It’s your first flight. It’s tradition. It’s sacred. It’s…supposed to be about the bon –”
Frankness –
Oceania wrenched the tea cosy from Malfoy’s grasp and flung it across the room. Malfoy wailed like a wounded soldier. The hideous contraption skidded to a halt on the ground in front of Harry and Charlie.
“It’s…it’s a feeling. That’s all.”
“I invited you round, Malfoy,” Harry interrupted quietly.
“You surprised me,” said Harry. “By being different. It made me realise that I don’t know you.”
It wasn’t that he didn’t like the happiness. It was just that – it was so damn hard to feel like he was being genuine sometimes, when it was all around him and he just couldn’t feel it.
Potter hums, and then looks over at Draco as if remembering she’s there. “Malfoy.” she says, frowning. “I haven’t seen you since the trials.”
Malfoy didn’t flinch, but something about him hardened as he watched Harry struggle for the words. When it was apparent no more were coming, he said, “Why is that a bad thing to have been brave about?”
Harry looked over at her. The light was glinting off her lipstick. She was looking calmly at the artwork. Harry realised that she wasn’t exactly angry with him; he had expected her to be.
“Okay,” he said, and pushed open the door.
“Anytime.” As Harry crossed the threshold, he saw Tom’s eyes close.
“I’m good,” said Harry. “I’m great. I’ve never been better.”
“I found people who were like me,” she said simply.
Oceania didn’t open her eyes. Her lips were rested in a calm half-moon. With her other hand, she reached up and pressed her fingers against Harry’s chest, over his shirt. He let her.
“Tenacious, aren’t you?”
“Okay,” said Malfoy, not moving, “I’ll see you tomorrow.”
It’s even better once Malfoy brings out the strap-on.
was nosing at his shoulder. He turned around and snapped, “Yes, yes, alright, I get it, just wait for
Harry turned on his heel and walked back down the mountain ridge.
He’d thought about these words for a long time before saying them. He practiced it at all. Now, he saw the way Harry’s face changed, the way he stopped.
END OF PART 1
Malfoy rolled his eyes, but relaxed a little against the wall, watching her with fondness. Again, Harry felt like he shouldn’t be watching.
He took a slightly cautious step forward, and when it just continued to stare at him, held out a tentative hand. Mayo’s nose shot forward, instantly beginning to butt at his palm. It made screechy, short noises of pleasure.
Finally, Malfoy looked up again. “It’s in the job description,” he said, after a moment.
“Fuck,” said Malfoy, taking the coffee cup back from Hayden and crushing it in his hand. “I love ceilings.”
“How does it feel to love me?”
Harry felt quite less flattered. Malfoy snorted into his fist, which was pretty fucking rich.
Harry took the tea. “What do you mean?”
to Draco, hadn’t he? The leggings, his face structure, the quality of his skin – there had always been a pull, and it was all of a sudden so fucking obvious that it was about sex, really, wasn’t it? Or that sex was at least a factor in the warmth Harry had felt at different points regarding him. It was obvious now, wasn’t it? It was obvious.
It was not so unlike meditating after all. No wonder it had come from Buddhism. It was strange, Harry thought, this religion that was so intent on kindness, on uncovering soft and secret places inside of the individual. He was aware of his own ignorance, but all the same, he had never encountered a religion that was so gentle.
“You’re just a pure-blood bitch,” She says, and tears Malfoy’s silk shirt at the back. Malfoy leans back, an eyebrow raised.
“It’s in the bathroom cupboard.” Oceania emerged from the drawers triumphantly, her fist clutched around a ball of fabric, although at this point it could still contain as yet unknown horrors. Harry waited before Malfoy had brushed past into the bathroom before saying, “Isn’t a mac a type of sandwich?”
“Are they?” Oceania pursed her lips in consideration. “The British are very strange.”
“Harry it’s our turn –”
“Where’s your cleavage?” Malfoy bent backwards over the stool and rubbed his palms on Benjamin’s chest, which was now adorned in a pink gown. “I miss it.”
“Hello,” Draco says quietly.
“I’ve died Malfoy,” he mumbled around his mouthful, “I’ve died, and God is real.”
“I have cravings,” they said.
, of all people. You, possibly the most influential person, maybe ever – you, blissfully unaware of it all.
“So what?” Harry straightened up. “You just…stand up and
“I love your hair,” he said.
“Ah –” said Harry, and stopped. He took it in.
“Then,” said Luna. “I suppose the only thing is to decide whether you’d like to live with him or without him. People are like everything else. You have to choose them.”
“I left.” Draco’s eyes flickered towards him, but they remained ambivalent. “You don’t think it was going to be heroic, did you? My father still doesn’t know where I am.” Another sip. “Don’t try to be proud of me, Harry Potter.”
Charlie gestured to Harry and then looked at him expectantly. Harry swallowed, and then waved lamely.
“Alright, alright.” Malfoy waved a hand at him. “Let’s not get fucking mawkish.”
“No,” said Harry.
Bolson rubbed his chin thoughtfully. “I thought he was a dominatrix.”
To his surprise, Malfoy made no further comments. Instead, he just looked down at the lipstick, almost cogitative in his expression, before pulling it off. It was slow, deliberative. Harry thought there was something explicit about the bend of his fingers.
“And witches,” Oceania piped up.
He let the quiet draw out for a while longer before turning his head. “Hey,” he said.
“Granger-Weasley,” Harry corrected. The corner of his mouth pulled up. “And no.”
Harry didn’t know how to start. But he thought that, perhaps, yoga was a good place to begin.
Harry had almost lost the entirety of his thought. Malfoy’s lashes swept his cheeks, darting back and forth like an unhappy butterfly, and then Harry figured it out.
“Please don’t leave,” Draco manages to whisper against her skin, and Harry inhales sharply.
“Yes,” said Harry, blinking at Draco’s proximity. “Well. It’s just a bit much.”
He waited for Draco to say something. But Draco just kept looking at him, his lips parting and closing a few times, like petals quivering in the breeze. Then he looked away, and Harry had the distinct impression suddenly that he was missing out on something. But he couldn’t figure out what, and so he opened his mouth to say the second thing he had come here to say.
The coffee finished brewing. Harry burnt his tongue on it. He couldn’t be bothered to find the sugar and of course there wasn’t any milk, so he had it black. It didn’t taste good. Black coffee never tasted good.
“Mm,” said Harry.
He went back to the hotel. He slept. He focused on the actions, and nothing else. It was easier that way, to keep going.
He had wanted to live a new sort of life, but he would have had to become a new sort of person first. And how did you leave everything that had ever defined you behind, just because of one nonsensical whimsy? It was stupid. He had been being stupid. He had stayed.
Malfoy’s eyes were sparkling. Funnily enough, he did look happier in his little maid get up.
He pulled back, pushing at Draco’s hips. They were absolutely as bony as he had always thought they would be. “Here, here – yeah, like this.”
Harry let his head tilt to the side. Being drunk wasn’t like being high, but the air was still thick, still viscous. Everything still loosened right up.
“’Pretty good’,” scoffed Malfoy, accepting the drink as Harry pushed it back to him. “Don’t talk to me with such filth. Here, Charlie, you try.”
There was a moment of silence, which was finally broken by Hayden’s slow clapping.
“Right,” said Harry, and followed her up the hill.
Harry had gotten a letter.
Harry pulled back. “Do you think I’m a coward?” he asked.
“That might be. But you still suck at taming them.”
“But I'm on beat,” he replied into the ensuing silence.
“Yes,” he said, and then bit his lip. “Why?”
“Do you ever get lonely?” Harry asked, desperate, before he could stop himself.
“My heart doesn’t sing hymns.”
“Because.” Harry felt himself growing frustrated. “There’s nothing for me here. I don’t even know what I’m doing. I don’t even know why I came.”
Oceania being Oceania, didn’t even blink. “Well by all means.” She gestured for him to take the lead.
“Oh, you know,” said Harry. “Probably just a tea.”
“Urm,” said Harry, “Me?”
“Alright.”
Jane was still staring at him. She blinked her glorious eyes.
Malfoy sighed and rubbed his eyes.
Draco was laughing. Once he’d stopped he straightened back up and started at Harry, wide-eyed, where he was perched up on top of Jane’s back.
And he looked at Draco like he finally understood everything. It wouldn’t be so bad if he did, Draco thought. It had taken him long enough.
“Wow,” said Harry, “I can’t believe he brought my hair into this. Now I’ve got to go and fuck him up.”
“Hey,” he said, “Wait.”
“What?” said Harry, “No, of course not.”
“It’s smiling.” Harry frowned.
“I’m quitting,” said Harry, and started to storm off. “That’s what I’m doing, telling Charlie that I’m quitting. Have a nice life Malfoy.”
Harry’s hand flung out to hover above his waist. “
Harry choked into his empty glass. “God,” he said, once he’d gotten a hold of himself. “
Benjamin Poppers was being rolled onstage. She was in a poised in a chair, draped in a nude illusion bodysuit, bald scalp glistening under the spotlight. Her bedazzled nipples winked as she leaned further back in the chair, microphone in hand.
Oceania clapped loudly and whooped as he got up and walked over to the counter. He didn’t know why he kept allowing these things to happen to him.
“Come here now.”
“You may not know this Harry,” said Malfoy, “But the point of being tidy is just
“Draco,” he said, and Draco’s eyes focused on him, and it felt it deep down within himself, pulsing against the dark of him, down in the place where he thought he would always be alone. Draco blinked, and it was slowed down in Harry’s mind.
This seemed to be a fair and true assessment. Harry said, “I thought you said this wasn’t a gay bar.”
“I thought it was good for him,” she said, “because lord knows that bitch needed a little fucking holiness after everything he’s been through.”
“I need you to save me,” said Harry, and it was the way his voice sounded, then. It made something in Draco seemingly wake up, and start howling. It was like finding a new part of his body that could ache. He didn’t understand, then, the first time he felt that.
Harry, forgetting himself, had been about to say from how he was during the war. Now he paused and looked at her.
When Harry meditated, the world went still. Something strange happened to the patchwork of reality around him – the fabric of it seemed to almost unrumple, iron-out. Like someone had taken a breath and was holding it, like something precious in their lungs and mouth.
“I can’t look at you,” he announced once he was done. “All this time, I believed that you…I thought you’d
Malfoy’s finger came away and back again. Harry wondered how much of this white shit he was putting on.
“You’re making fun of me,” said Oceania, swaying and squinting impressively across at them, “Both of you. I’m going to go and sit beside ‘arry.”
“What do you have feelings about?” Hayden peered meanly at Oceania. “Persimmons?”
Harry shrugged, glancing away. “I don’t know,” he said. “It was only once, and very drunk. I guess it seemed like the thing to do.”
It was actually kind of beautiful. It didn’t really match the mountains on the wall, but that was what made it so
“Mmm.” Osh licked at the edge of the coffee cup. “Mmmmm.”
“You asked me why I came here,” Harry said eventually. His voice was very quiet, because he was talking with his soul. “I never really answered you. But the truth, the truth of it is…I’m not well.”
“And Charlie’s praying, I think. Maybe. Anyway, he’s kneeling on a pillow in the bathroom next to her, with a ceramic turtle balanced on his head, so.”
“Officially?” said Hayden. “No.”
Draco looked at him. “I think,” he said after a moment. “That you’re just trying to stop feeling…bad. And I understand that. But... I think you should know that you don’t outrun these sorts of things. There is never any escape. Not ever. The only way out is in.”
“Tell me I’m the only who gets you hot like this, the only one who makes you scream.”
And Draco can only say her name, and feel her touch, and there is very little else.
“What do you think I’m thinking?” he replied, grinning.
He turned, digging into his leather satchel. Jane watched him beadily, making the occasional clucking noise.
All his attention was focused on Harry’s mouth. It wasn’t so bad. Harry closed his eyes.
“I know you don’t like me,” said Malfoy. He paused. “I don’t need that.”
There was a tense moment filled only with the sound of fluttering pages as Harry flipped open the list of questions Bolson had bequeathed him. Once he’d found what appeared to be the first page – the top of the page merely stated, in comic sans,
Draco just blinked lazily and kept smiling. “This isn’t high school,” he drawled, but scooted up anyway, raising himself up onto his elbows.
Draco shakes her head. “My parents?” she hears herself ask.
“Were you laughing at me earlier?” Malfoy asked from beside him.
Mayo made a whale-like sound of grievance as Malfoy shrugged him off and squatted in front of the bag again. It stared after him, longingly, before turning its baleful eyes on Harry.
The world was so big. Harry was only understanding now that he had known and felt so little of it. His inexperience ached at him. There was so much waiting involved with being young.
Unfortunately, he was also now sober.
“Because Draco has taste,” said Pansy, and the cast him a look. “Or I thought he did. Don’t you?”
There were a few ball-gags strewn over the books. Harry selected the spikiest one off the top of a cover of
There was a breath, and in the silence Malfoy’s face reddened, but he stood his ground.
“It’s not because I’m running away,” said Harry.
Malfoy didn’t say anything. Harry felt his voice grow small. “I thought you wanted it.”
The lounge was a different colour scheme. Where the kitchen had been all dark, but earthy colours, here everything was bluish tones. Not dark blue. Draco had an entire sofa that was the colour of the sky.
But looking at Malfoy now, he didn’t want to say any of them. Malfoy was here now, in front of him, asking for Harry’s respect.
Harry ducked his head. He heard Draco stand up.
“I don’t,” said Harry, then glanced around to make sure no one had heard him. “But I like Luna. And I do like some crafts.”
“You’re so fucking hungry for it.” Harry finally retracted his thumb, carefully easing it out. Malfoy sucked even harder, as if he wanted to keep it there. As if he would feel the loss.
that you’re making new friends Harry,” protested Hermione. “We’re all adults; it’s good to be open-minded about it.”
He backed up into downward dog, pressed his ankles firmly down. Flowed forward into plank, then upwards dog. Flowed again. Began to work on opening his lower body.
I will be uploading the next chapter within the next week :) Until then, please let me know what you think so far!
Pansy rolled her eyes, again. “You heard me, Potter,” she drawled.
“A while,” he said eventually.
“Peppermint,” says Harry, in a tone akin to wonder. “I’ve never tried that before.” She swings her legs, back and forth.
Jane blinked her beautiful blue eyes slowly at him. It was disconcerting, if Draco was being honest, how calm she was. He had never seen a dragon like it. Perhaps he should bring it up with Charlie.
“Barge?” said Harry.
Outside smelt different here. The smell of the outside in Scotland was always very fresh, very solid. It was partly why he had wanted to move there so bad. Here everything had different flavours, like a slightly warped version of Harry’s reality. He’d come to the Himalayas because he’d wanted something different. But difference was only ever shallow.
“I’m not in love,” said Oceania across the table. “I’m just interested.”
Hayden looked very carefully at him. “You do know what a queer is, don’t you Harry?”
“Harry!” she cried, voice a little muffled. “Let me take your suitcase.” She reached over for it.
He looked back. His eyes were red-rimmed too. Harry had the sudden vision of Malfoy crumpling over, sobbing while this time Harry held him instead, pressing kisses to his neck and clinging to him through it. Then Malfoy inhaled sharply, nostrils flaring, and the vision disappeared. His gaze skittered off the length of Harry and back to his face. Harry wished, out of all the expressions he could have known how to interpret, that it hadn’t been this one.
His muscles were aching, but he had already trained himself to endure this, and so it was not difficult. Next to him, Malfoy was breathing hard. Harry was reminded that although Malfoy was in fit condition, he had not trained himself in running. The pain was still novel.
“Please,” she whispers, growing more desperate as more buttons are undone. “Please, Harry – I can’t –“
into.”
“I read books, Draco,” he said pleasantly. Malfoy blinked hard at him, and then collected himself. Abashment turned to bemusement. And then mildly surprised amusement. It was fun to watch.
“Look at me.”
“Harry, please,” she says, canting her hips forward and swaying, one hand blindly reaching out to brush against the wet tiles, her eyes scrunched shut. “Harry, please, don’t-“ she says, even as her fist tightens its grip in all that dark hair between her legs, and even as the moan works itself up her throat, until she throws her head back into the path of the showerhead, letting water spill across her face and down her neck and chest, dripping off her nipples and all the way down to where Harry is kissing her, and keeps kissing her, and oh
Draco was laid back on the sofa, his legs still locked around Harry’s waist. Harry sucked on his neck some more, and then pushed his jumper all the way up and licked a stripe up his stomach.
Harry’s in the corner, drinking a beer all by herself and trying not to be seen. She’s deliberately chosen a muggle pub – doesn’t want to be recognised. I’m not going to hook up with anyone tonight, she thinks. Or ever. I’m in a relationship.
A muscle in Malfoy’s jaw jumped. He kept looking at Harry, until he looked away.
“Yes,” said Malfoy. “Are we just going to glide by the part where you were stalking me again?”
“Morning,” he said to the receptionist. She looked up from her copy of readers digest to glare at him.
Harry sat up. “How long have you been standing there?”
“Relax into it,” murmured Oceania, having switched into her yoga teacher voice despite Harry being the only one there. “Don’t use your body to get into the pose, but instead use the pose to get into the body.”
Draco gulps for air and swallows and pants into Harry’s collarbone as Harry kisses from her nose to her hairline.
Osh raised her chin. This was the part where she delivered her killer blow. Draco knew it.
“Get off me!” he squealed, laughing, trying to wriggle out of her grasp. “No – God, woman, I’m a poof! A flagrant poof! Control yourself!”
Then the class resumed. Just like that. The only difference was that the girl kept glancing behind at Harry to make sure he was keeping up. He absolutely wasn’t, but she didn’t seem to mind.
Hermione’s eyes were very wide. Her fingers were clutched tight around the tea cup, even though it really must be too hot. “Oh, that’s alright,” she squeaked in a small voice.
he murmured. He dropped his head onto Draco’s shoulder, his mind revelling in the idea that this was allowed. Draco stiffened, but didn’t push him away. The curve of his neck was warm against the slice of Harry’s forehead.
“Yes,” said Hayden, “It was.”
“Every time I think I’ve got you figured out, you just do something else. Something out-of-character. Something that doesn’t make sense. Like coming here, for example. I can’t understand why you would come. You’re not the kind of person to come.”
She jutted a thumb back towards the small set of shelves behind her. “Arrived two days ago, but I was in the middle of a book.”
“Great,” said Harry, “I’ll see you.”
Of course.
“You didn’t know about being gay?”
“You know,” he said tentatively. “I don’t always understand you, either.”
“What?”
But then he saw Draco laugh, and then he was speeding up again, and then he was there and his cheeks were pink and he was wearing a beanie and he was perfect. Harry felt like he was going to kiss him. He didn’t. Instead, he rocked forward on his heels and grinned and said, wittily, “Hi.”
“Yes. Harry here loves gay bars now. I guess gayness is contagious after all. Don’t tell the monks. Won’t you let us in, love?”
“Hey,” he said. “I’m allowed to go.”
“Ah. So they’re a thing now then?”
Forwardness –
Harry flushed all over. He could feel it all under his clothes, but pushed on. “Yeah.
“Ballsy,” Harry noted. “Wish I could say I didn’t get it.”
Harry’s heart surged. “What do you mean?”
“I told you,” said Draco quietly, not looking up. “It’s very simple.”
They sat in silence for a few moments as Harry absorbed that.
“That’s not coffee,” Harry felt inclined to point out.
Oceania beamed. “That’s a good one.”
“Did you mean them?” he asked.
“Do you know a Kumbukani Laska?”
He moved the burger image slightly to the left.
But it had, and now he was sitting here alone, and there was no escaping it.
Oceania smiled at him. “You should help Draco put the mats away again,” she said lightly.
There was a pregnant pause. Harry stared pointedly at a spot a few inches to her left.
“If you knew all this,” said Harry, “then why did you come over?”
“She stole one of Benjamin’s hairpieces.” Malfoy seemed to realise he was still holding down Harry. He retracted his hand immediately, fumbling with his wine glass.
“Are you gay?” asks Harry.
“I just meant…”Malfoy breathed a small chuckle. “Like how normal people…” His hand ran along Harry’s forearm and found his wrist. His fingers paused there too, finding the small bone that jutted outwards.
And then he thought about Draco telling him that he loved him, and the fog of arousal abruptly evaporated and became something different, something entirely more confusing to Harry. And he was just standing there, in his kitchen, frowning desperately at the floorboards.
“Cows,” Harry said faintly, “Feelings.”
When they finally navigated their way back to the bar, Oceania ordered some iced water for the two of them. She hopped up onto one of the stools, and as Harry sat down, he realised how grateful he was for a break.
He stood there in the doorway for another second, arms crossed over himself. He had changed back into a jumper and jeans but hadn’t removed the eyeliner. It was bizarre to see him hesitating.
Harry shuffled on the hillside. He hadn’t expected Malfoy to take him seriously.
Draco’s gaze flickered from the floor up to Harry for a second. He was frowning.
“Mm,” she managed around a yawn. “Have to. I feel like I’m not awake without it.”
They veered over some more trees. Draco’s ankles were cold. He needed to knit more socks.
As Malfoy passed over to the lane next to Oceania he winked at Harry. Harry rolled his eyes again, fruitlessly, and then said to no one in particular: “I’m going to get a coke.”
It was only once they got to Harry’s flat that he felt the real world come back to him. As he paid the taxi driver, Draco asked, “Where am I staying?”
When he woke, his eyes were dry. He sat up, the dream washing off like a liquid memory. As he pressed the heel of his palms into his sockets, he clung onto the fading memory of pale skin, stepping past him, into something awful.
“Dare’s a dare.”
what this is?”
“Anyway,” says Draco, voice rising rapidly. “Why do you care? Are you in
Harry closed his eyes. “I came here,” he said, "because I couldn’t stay.”
“I love it here,” said Harry. It was true. He hadn’t entirely known until now – but he did, he loved it so much. So much more than he thought he would.
Harry looked over at Malfoy, who had flushed pink, and tried to tamp down the laughter rising in his throat.
“Well,” said Charlie, chewing on the straw, “I suppose they’re – well, Draco in particular – really into muggle stuff.”
“Look, I – I,” Draco stutters as Potters gaze snaps back to meet hers. “I – really need to make tea.”
“I don’t know yet,” said Malfoy, his eyes still quite wide, “I’m still processing. It’s a bit much.”
The flush in Malfoy’s cheeks was spreading all over his face. He tried to nod in Harry’s steel grip, best he could. Harry’s lips lifted.
“I’m ace,” said Tom.
“Close your eyes,” said Oceania.
“I think you should,” said Oceania. Her gaze was serious.
“You’re so strange,” Draco muttered as he looked away, rolling his eyes pointedly, but it didn’t change the embarrassed curve of his neck. He turned and rummaged through the drawers before flinging some blue material at Harry. “Go get changing in the bathroom,” he said, without turning around.
There was another drawn out silence. Draco exhaled. Harry watched as he rolled his shoulders back. It was so pale.
“How did this even happen?” wails Ron, eyes glistening with deep distraught.
“Really?” Malfoy sneers, and turns around, sifting through her wardrobe. “I thought you were a girl. And Christ – haven’t you ever heard of hating yourself?”
“You’re so –”
“No.” Malfoy turned to face a wall of body-stockings so Harry couldn’t see his pout. Which was still visible if Harry leaned slightly to the right. His overdrawn lips jut out over the knife’s point of his chin, a tiny red blossom. Malfoy liked to paint on his lipstick in the shape of heart, just like the evil queen from Alice in Wonderland.
“It’ll be Draco,” said Charlie, “Draco can teach you.”
Oceania maintained eye contact with her for a few moments, and it was clear something was been exchanged. And then she leaned forward and pressed a hand to her nose. Jane let her.
Now Malfoy looked surprised. “You’ve read it?”
said Draco, and then reverted back to his earlier statement.
“Do you feel that?” he grunted and punctuated it with a harsh thrust. “Do you feel that big thing? I’m going to put it in your mouth.”
“Do you miss them?” he drawled, as quietly as he could.
?” Malfoy shot back. He was on his feet. Harry was staring up at him, adrenaline beating through his system. “Your dragon is depressed, so you’re just
“Could you be humanly worse at this?” asked Malfoy gleefully. Harry crossed his arms and watched as his tenth ball rolled down again into the gutter.
“Would you like to take a seat?” Charlie asked, gesturing towards the sofa.
Pansy’s lips drew into a tight purse, as if she’d said more than she’d have liked. Harry stared at her. A length of her black hair blew across her pale cheek, and she didn’t brush it back.
“I’m not going to lower myself to your level,” Hayden said coolly, and headed off into the woods with their blue cheese.
“We can’t risk this again,” said Charlie, “I’ll need to supervise you from now on.”
“I’ve been to a gay bar.”
“I just – I don’t understand –”
“You have to,” he said lightly, “It’s part of training.”
“I’ve spent a significant portion of my recent life telling you what to do, Harry,” said Draco. His voice was warm and quiet with sleep. “You’ll have to specify.”
“You could wear it yourself,” Oceania suggested.
Harry followed her direction to where a white letter was balanced precariously on top of an empty yoghurt pot. The handwriting on the front was neat.
“Don’t hold your breath,” said somebody, and then he was awake. Reality was thudding around him. He gasped out loud, and it caught like a sob.
Draco looked very strange. He was staring off into the unlit fire, but it was a little like he wasn’t staring there at all, like he was seeing something else. His finger on his now empty beer bottle twitched, flitting against the curling edge of the unpeeling sticker.
Harry wasn’t sure if he was talking about the print or himself. There was really no safe answer.
“You say that like it’s a bad thing,” said Oceania.
“Wanna come over?” He asked.
Ever since he had realised his – not
“I’m not making anything a thing,” Draco protested. It came out sounding like a dying bird, even as he said it. “It’s just – it doesn’t make any sense Osh.”
“Urm,” he said. “I’m sorry, I don’t think my, uh, foundation will work for you.”
If it hadn’t been him he would’ve laughed. But it was him, and the possibility of laughter got stuck just behind his teeth.
Namely, men.
Malfoy met his eyes. He swallowed and looked away. There was a silence as he scratched at the short hair at the back of his head.
“I think…” Harry looked away. “You told me, a few days ago, that you were proud of me. For being…honest. But…I don’t think I’ve been being very honest. At all.”
“The height of anarchistic vandalism,” Draco deadpanned. “Excessive hand-made decorations.”
She doesn’t have enough distractions anymore, though.
“Oh,” she said, noticing Harry and uncurling, “Hey. You’re up early.”
Malfoy swallows. “No,” she says. “You haven’t.”
But he had already started, hadn’t he? In the Himalayas, he’d managed to create some sort of morning routine, a basic rinse and repeat of yoga and meditation. The fact that he was here didn’t change that, surely. He could still continue the yoga, at least.
I'm all out of other ones.”
When they got back to the camp it was very late. They all recovered by holding onto the trees at the edge of the forest and groaning loudly for a few minutes, before trekking up to the cafeteria. There were noises, the sounds of people talking and laughing, coming faintly from somewhere close.
Luna nodded thoughtfully. “Why do you think that?”
Oh god, thinks Draco. Oh, god.
Harry opened the door. It was Malfoy.
Malfoy took his fingers away from his face. “In a manner of speaking,” he muttered, leaning back properly. “I mean. Oceania’s throwing up. Again. It’s mostly water though.”
Draco is so still Harry almost thinks she’ll never move again.
Charlie shrugged. “Messenger, kill. Don’t.”
Sometimes, after he had a…breakdown, or whatever he was supposed to call it, things became like this. Everything inside him would go still, as silent as dawn. It was as if there was only so much one person was supposed to feel, as if the emotional centres had purged, taking all the sadness that one might feel in a year and making him feel it in a day. It was too intense; the next day, he would be numb.
“Suck cock?”
Everything went very still. Harry thought he could feel the oxygen vibrating in his brain.
“I’m okay,” he said. “Osh, thanks for…all this.”
They went in through one of the two wide doorways, stepping under the folds of bamboo sheets. Inside, everything was dim and potent; at the far end, the incense burned in neat sets of rows, rich and red and sweet.  Several painted statues of what Harry assumed were various gods were laid out, plates of fruit and sweets and burnt incense offered before them, and in the very centre of them all was a huge depiction of Buddha, one hand raised and the other resting by his lap, palms presented, his eyes closed peacefully. Harry wasn’t religious, but anyone would be affected in a place like this.
“Is that the black pencil?”
Draco looked away. “Did Osh say how long you were being sexiled for?” he asked after a moment, quite casually.
Inside, it looked just as Harry would have imagined it if he’d been thinking about what kind of place Oceania would live in. There were rugs and pillows draped across the living room, floating lanterns and odd bits of wood, which all looked like they’d been hacked off some nearby tree. The place smelt of pine and tea. On the walls, there were paintings of the surrounding mountains. It was almost like she’d tried to bring the Himalayas inside.
Malfoy was definitely giggling in the background now. It was easier to distract himself from the sheer horror of the situation if he focused on the centring, soothing image of kicking Malfoy in the throat.
“Malfoy,” breathes Potter, and puts on a hand on the front of Malfoy’s trousers. “Draco.”
“I think that might actually be worse,” said Harry, and then sighed. “Are we doing this or not?”
“Harry,” said Pansy, and he was back in the bar. Everything was brown and wooden and dimmed, and it was nothing like the Himalayas, not so green, not so bright, not so clear. He reached for his glass; it was cold around the cup of his fingers.
“So we’re going bowling,” Harry had said.
“Hmm,” says Harry around his double chocolate sundae. “Nice statues.”
“Hello,” she croaks.
“I –” said Malfoy. Harry heard him take a breath. “We’ve been looking for you.”
He breathed in. He breathed out. Then he got undressed and unpacked it all, very slowly. It took a long time as well, and exhaustion was a permanent resident in his bones, but he found that if he focused on the actions of it all, it was easier to keep going.
“Oh,” says Potter. “Of course. Yes. Go ahead.”
“Because it wasn’t me,” he said. “It wasn’t my bravery.”
“Fuck you,” says Malfoy, coming in close to her and dropping her wand on the ground. She grips Harry’s jaw, and raises her other fist as if to punch her, punch her so hard she bursts through the skin of Harry’s cheek, but somewhere on that journey something gets confused, and when Malfoy meets Harry’s skin it’s with a desperate kiss.
He didn’t want to be human anymore; it was too much. It was too much. He wanted the air and sun to be enough.
“When did you become so muggle?” Harry asked.
Harry peered at him. His eyes were striking against the black of his brow.
Also it turned out the green hotel only had four rooms anyway.
“Oh, Harry,” she said once she could breathe again. “Of course he is. Gosh, you’re so lovely. Go to sleep.”
Harry closed his eyes, and his lashes were wet. It was always raining in his mind.
“Everyone has problems,” Malfoy said. He wasn’t yelling anymore. Harry turned around and looked at him.
“What does give way mean?”
I just thought you were a dominatrix.”
Foresight –
“Me too,” said Malfoy.
Harry didn’t go to the Highlands. But he did get in touch with Charlie Weasley.
breathed Harry under his breath. Draco had to take a moment from his educating to hide his smile.
Delia looked dubious. “Uh huh.”
“I didn’t know about all that other stuff either,” he added. “All that, like – bisexual, and whatever. No one ever really told me.”
Malfoy smirked, but the way he directed it was not cruel. There was something almost attentive about his gaze. Then he turned it away and rummaged through the bag.
“Great,” said Malfoy, and took a step back.
“The coke is still two-fifty,” she added after another few moments, and scratch that, Harry didn’t just want to die. He wanted to be annihilated, or possibly, turned into a tree. Trees didn’t have to worry about flirting. Trees could just bathe in the sun.
Harry brought the cup to his mouth. The steam was hot as it hit his skin. It was peppermint. He watched as Oceania joined Hayden on the bed and began to help them roll up the purple fluff in a sort of haphazard joint. It was strange to see them so methodical. Malfoy stayed by the door.
“You stared at her a lot.” says Hermione.
“Draco,” said Harry.
Malfoy swallowed with difficulty and looked away. The wind was catching on his fringe, running playful fingers through it.
“Do you still think I’m a coward?” Harry asked.
The way he’d probably been looking at him his whole life, honestly. Seeing Malfoy all dressed up like this reminded Harry of a time when he’d still believed that Draco Malfoy was nothing but trouble. Harry could see it now – trouble – tucked up in the corner of his lips, tangled in his blackened eyelashes. Trouble. Malfoy took another sip.
“I don’t not like you,” said Harry.
“Look,” said Harry, “I think I’ve taken a wrong turn. Sorry for interrupting you.”
“Do you?” Draco injects, her voice dry.
“No, no.” Bolson shook his head. “These are fine. Send them to, um, Helen to sort out.”
“Surely I, of all people, would have been the most inhibited to that fact.” He couldn’t help leaning forward.
Harry tucked further into his shoulder. “Okay,” he said, because he didn’t know what else to say. His eyes were aching again.
“How the…” Draco trailed off and took his hands back down. They dangled at his sides. “How did you get up there? How did you get her to…you know what? Never mind. Never fucking mind. You’re fucking Harry Potter. How could I forget? How could I
“So soon?” Malfoy draped himself against the bars of the cage, one hip hitching up. “Oh, and you haven’t even bought me dinner.”
“Ah, yes.” Malfoy’s thin lips twisted around the words. Harry had forgotten it, mostly – but Malfoy was not a handsome man. His nose was too long, his eyes too narrow, his chin too sharp. The hollows in his face had a permanent sunken-in appearance. His transparent skin betrayed his hatred, when he felt it, all too easily.
“No,” said Harry. “But also, yes. She says it’s not official, but like…” He turned back around, having prepared both the cups. “You know.”
“Sure.” She shrugged. “It’s a novelty, right? It’s okay if you want to know more. Especially since you’re so reserved.”
Harry glanced over at him. His pointy face was very close. “Thanks,” he said. “How was the kitchen top?”
Malfoy looked up, and then raised a brow. “You really know how to make small talk, don’t you?” he said, rather dryly.
There was no going back on this. Once he had left this place, it would never be the same. Even if he came back, even if he decided he wanted to become a monk like Tom and live here for the rest of his days – it would never be the same. Not for him. Gay Dragon Village was a real, solid place – but it had also existed in his mind, a half-lucid dream. Tom was right – life was something that happened inside of you.
“Ah,” said Draco calmly, as he splashed coffee down his robes. “Harry.”
“I can’t help you.” says Draco.
“Harry,” says Draco, her voice coming out half-strangled, and Harry dips her tongue in deeper, sliding against all the right places, and Draco stumbles forward and gasps.
“Why isn’t it?”
“Not very much,” he heard himself say. His gaze had slid to a midway point between two trees.
After a moment, he decided he wasn’t going to throw up. Probably. For now, at least. He steadied himself weakly, and then kept walking.
Harry was staring at him. When Draco looked back over he glanced away instinctively. But he looked back again.
“Ah,” Tom said again, and smiled gently. “Why don’t you sit down?”
Harry raised his brow, feeling a little smug. “First name basis?”
Draco frowned deeper. “Neither did I,” he murmured.
“Osh,” he said, “Come here. Come here.”
“Are you seriously
Luna thought about it. “Sometimes,” she said, after a moment. “But normally, I manage it. I ask to see a friend. Or I keep busy.”
“Good,” said Harry, and then – “Keep looking,” because he was pushing two fingers into Malfoy’s mouth.
“I should go,” said Malfoy. He was looking at Harry attentively, and Harry was suddenly thinking about what he must look like.
“Oh, my apologies,” said Harry. “I’ll never know why it didn’t occur to me that Gay Dragon Village would have such vital ties with Asda. My mistake.”
There is no easy way to explain this to someone you love. Someone that you are leaving.
“Seriously. Thank you.”
“That’s a classic, you know,” he admonished, but missed a believable disapproving tone by about a thousand marks.
It was the third time now, but Harry’s body still felt stiff. Granted, it wasn’t as bad as the first time, but it sure as hell didn’t feel like Harry’s body had “opened up” or whatever the fuck it was that Oceania had told him would happen. He gritted his teeth and tried to breathe through it.
“Rambling.” The syrup was fine. Harry looked over at Malfoy, who was leaning nonchalantly on the edge of the island, hand in pockets. “Why is that?”
“Truth,” said Malfoy. He sat down and avoided Oceania’s glare.
“Oh my god,” she managed to force out, barely holding herself together.
“The first step,” Draco had continued, “is about awakening the individual from illusion.”
“I’m alright, I guess.” He took the hand down from his hair. “I mean, relative to everything. I suppose I’m alright.”
“Hey,” said Harry.
When he reached back down, it was to reveal a small pink bow, perched atop the “head” of the sunflower.
Harry leaned forward. “I don’t actually think it was about that though, actually.”
“Why do you say it like that?” He took a step back. “Like…it’s a, fuck, I don’t know – a crime or something?”
Charlie just shrugged again. “Maybe not to you.”
“Oh wow,” mouthed Harry.
“Because,” continued Harry after a few moments, “it is the sort of confusion that demands to be felt.”
Gao tilted her head to the other side. “I can’t say if that’s right or wrong,” she said slowly. “But as far as I can see, being happy, for the most part, is the point of it all, isn’t it?”
There was a pause. Draco kept walking. And then –
“We have bad blood,” said Harry. “Bad history.”
Ron was looking at him over the table. “How have they changed?” he asked.
“Draco Malfoy,” Pansy was drawling. She was still standing next to Blaise like a pair of horror movie twins, cleavage and villainy at her max.
Malfoy laughed. It sounded like rain on the leaves. “No,” he said. “I do not paint.”
“You can stay,” said Oceania cheerfully. “But we’re totally going to have sex.”
“A medium sized one,” said Harry.
“It’s not a dress,” Oceania told him, turning and padding her way back into the house. “It’s a bathrobe.”
“He’s just – he’s so – he’s different.”
“Indeed!” Charlie cried, and then his brow dropped considerably. He tugged his bathrobe with tiny dragons printed on it tighter around his torso and stepped out onto the porch.
“Thank you,” breathes Harry, and suddenly her voice is very close. “That’s perfect.”
“How long?” Harry asked again.
“I’m not reserved,” he said, slowly.
“I know,” said Malfoy, and his voice was gentle, “I know.”
“His no-magic diet,” she repeated, and then: “Did he really never tell you?”
“I’m not homophobic,” he said quickly, “I didn’t mean to suggest anything.”
Oceania arrived a week later. Harry met her in the airport.
“No, I’m not –” Fucking hell. “I’m not
“Why were you in the loch, Malfoy?” he murmured. He leaned in closer, still. He wanted to fit his whole body into that space of skin.
Then Harry told him to close his eyes, and he did that too. It was different, when you weren’t alone. Instead of disappearing into the room, it was like he became more aware of his body, of the jagged shape of it. Harry told him to breathe in. Draco felt it in his throat, lungs, ribs.
“Breathe in to your third eye,” he instructed. “The space between your brows. Feel the space there. Focus your energy there.”
“I’ve been ready for a long time,” he whispered, and then the desire in Jane snapped and they were off.
“Osh,” he said. He swallowed. He felt that his eyes were too big – big enough that she could just dive in and see everything inside him right now. “I…I think I’ve done something bad.”
This chapter's song is Vroom Vroom by Charli XCX, obviously.
“The Mayo-Masters keep raising income tax,” Harry told him solemnly. “It’s tearing Condiment-ville apart.”
Malfoy reached again. Then he stopped again, a few inches away, and looked at Harry.
“Before that.”
A muscle jumped in Malfoy’s jaw. He wasn’t looking at Harry anymore. He had definitely been looking at him earlier. Harry watched him breathe in deeply, his eyes fluttering momentarily closed.
“So what now?” whispered Draco eventually.
Draco frowned. It looked pained. “Does that matter?”
“I just don’t understand,” Draco said eventually. He no longer looked pained, just tired. Harry hated that he had made him look this way. He hated all of this.
“Draco,” said Harry, sitting at his desk a fortnight later.
That didn’t mean that she thought about the lines of their body particularly, of their low voices and big hands and square jaws. It didn’t mean that when she closed her eyes, when she fucked herself with her fingers, that she couldn’t think of tits and ass and long hair brushing in her face. Somehow, the word straight and the fantasies of women could co-exist perfectly fine in her mind, and frankly, she had had slightly more pressing issues at the time.
“Hey,” she says, lifting Draco’s head and kissing her forehead. “Hey.”
“Perhaps you took them to a nice little pub at the bottom and bought them pints. Perhaps you checked the state of their apparatus down there as well. It makes sense, as a control. Although, there are a lot of variables in that equation.”
This was not successful, largely because the three of them were laughing so hard they all kept curling over, but also because it was a stupid fucking idea. Eventually, they decided to try it the other way around.
When he got home, there was a white letter sitting on his table.
Malfoy paused, and then turned back around, his eyebrows raised. “Yes?”
“Surely not,” said Malfoy.
Harry wondered if he saw a man.
“Thanks for your input,” Malfoy said drily. He was still looking down at the fire.
When they settled back into the small clearing Harry could almost feel the soft of the carpeted grass underneath Jane’s claws. He stroked her, and there was so much sweetness in his chest for her that he mindlessly leaning forward and rubbed his cheek against her neck. She made an ugly noise through her nose, but it wasn’t disgruntled.
“Open your heart Draco,” said Hayden in ditsy voice, “Open your mind.”
Malfoy’s breath drew in closer. Harry stopped right in front of him, and Malfoy sort of looked like he wanted to bolt, except – “Do it.”
“God, Draco,” Harry moans, voice breaking, her back bending like a bow being strung. “God, god, I want you.”
Harry breathed out very quickly. He clutched to the phone.
Draco smiled back, but it was tighter. Harry knew this one. A mixture of scepticism and amusement. Maybe fondness. Pleased with himself, Harry leaned back even more. The smile grew more pronounced.
Blaise Zambini’s eyes were twinkling. Harry said, “Where were you thinking of going for drinks?”
It splashed, hot as blood, between their bodies. It definitely got on Draco’s very nice blouse. He moaned helplessly, as if it was happening to him and not Harry.
Harry frowned. “You chose your own name?”
Harry looked over his shoulder. Malfoy was dressed as latex maid. He was wearing a lot of eyeliner.
Then he turned his head to the side. Malfoy was standing at the edge of the plaza, his arms folded.
Draco told him some of it.
Malfoy stiffened, and then continued stacking the mats. He seemed to be organising them by colour, and then thickness.
Malfoy looked at him and the smile extended to the other half of his mouth. “Definitely not the bible.”
“It’s just not what jumps to mind, chiefly, when I think of fun activities,” Malfoy muttered again after a brief pause.
“I needed to be on my own,” he admitted. “Too.”
Malfoy stepped back into the kitchen. He looked significantly less pretty than usual, but Harry supposed four consecutive shots of vodka could that to a person. Harry certainly felt less pretty.
“You can,” said Hayden. “I think I’m going to go write a bit. Or perhaps, lay myself down in the dirt and mutter curses about whoever invented the cookie.”
“You’re still friends with Draco?” he asked through gritted teeth.
“Do you want tea?” she asked, without looking up.
Malfoy bent over and picked it up. The sunlight dripped down his calve muscle. Then he straightened back up, and the letter was in between his white fingers.
Malfoy keeps on running the cloth around the edges of the plate, catching each drop with the utmost concentration.
“It’s quite alright.” Malfoy made a movement as if to pat his hand and then seemed to think better of it. His fingers fluttered awkwardly between them. “Let me put this is in a way you can understand: I’m free next Thursday at quarter to one.”
Harry bit his cheek to keep down his temper and shrugged at the ground. “Okay.”
“Urm,” said Malfoy, “Okay.”
He was all alone. It had happened more suddenly than he had expected. He turned back to the loch. When he began to cry again, he didn’t bother to keep himself quiet. It made it easier not to think.
Harry didn’t understand it, so he hadn’t thought about it. The idea that these two Draco Malfoys were the same person was something that could not fit inside his skull.  One of them had to be unreal, and it was all too easy to see the beautiful and appalling image of Draco Malfoy’s white back, forever descending into the open blue, as just another subconscious yearning that Harry had dreamt up.
She’s most honest when she isn’t thinking.
Another silence.
“We’re mages Harry,” said Oceania, “We can summon things.”
Ron shrugged. Hermione looked between them, a little tense. “Alright,” he said. “It’s great of you to like, forgive them and all that. But like, no one would blame you if you didn’t. You don’t really owe them it.”
“Yes way,” said Harry, grinning.
Draco studied him coolly from under his lashes. Harry had always hated the feeling of being inspected, largely as a result of being a famed focal point for wizarding media for a large portion of his life, and also as a result of his loving, loving friends, who loved him so much that they hated the blue as much as him, which would have been fine except he couldn’t always detach it from himself –
“Hey,” they said. Their lips were quirked up to the side, a single eyebrow raised. Their hands were stuffed full of bags of colourful sand. “Haven’t seen you about for a while.”
Draco looked up from his book and raised an amused brow, smiling with half of his mouth at her. “All the essentials, I see.”
Draco Malfoy wasn’t there. Dazed, Harry stumbled out of the bed, floating along the corridor. Somehow, he found himself again in the kitchen, along with Draco. He looked up when he saw Harry.
The next morning, Harry found himself leaning against the sink in Oceania’s lemon yellow kitchen and precariously nursing water from a cereal bowl. The cereal bowl had splotches of black and white patterning on the outside, and inside at the very bottom, it merely said ‘Moo’.
“It would be good for a lot of my friends, I think, but I’ve learned that for the most part you can’t really convince people to do things they haven’t already decided the want to do so…” Luna trailed off, shrugging. She turned around with the full mugs. “Do you want the yellow tassel or the green one?”
“You know what bisexuality is?” said Hayden, raising a brow at him.
“Why?” he asked.
hi it's been a minute
He finished rolling the mat up. Harry still hadn’t said anything. He watched as Draco paused over the mat, looking down at where his fingers were splayed over the worn foam.
“It’s not a kink,” said Harry, but in good humour. “It’s an appreciation.”
The next time Harry was running, he paused in the middle of the path. No one was there to see him.
Harry almost said. Instead, he just nodded, and let Hayden leave him there, at the bottom of a small mountain.
“Well,” said Harry. “I suppose we should get going too.”
No one good, at least.
“That’s alright,” Oceania told him, quite pleasantly. “I don’t mind.”
“Shall I order some olives?” said Luna.
“Is this a fantasy for you?” asks Malfoy, a hand dipping into Harry’s trousers and plunging in two fingers with no warm up, so that it would have probably hurt, if Harry wasn’t so wet. “Tell me, is this just a fantasy for you? Is this how you would have liked it when you were dating men, when you were fucking the Weasel? Is this how you imagined it, all this fighting back, all this hate, all this hurt?”
“Harry,” he said, aghast, and it sounded confessional.
He got to his feet and walked across the room. Malfoy turned and caught sight of him, and then he smiled brilliantly.
“Such a thing does not exist.” Oceania spread her arms. “Cover me.”
“What are you doing?”
“Dramatic? Pray, do not throw about such accusations.” Malfoy’s eyes were starting to sparkle above the pout.
There was an obligatory collective “aww”, and Charlie ruffled his hair.
Harry opened his mouth. Draco was wearing the same blue jumper that he had when they had meditated together. He closed his mouth. His heart was thudding in his chest.
Harry went back to his coke. Swirled the straw though the ice cubes. Once Charlie seemed satisfied with his assessment of the juice carton’s musical ability, he leaned forward onto the counter, resting his chin on his palm.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” said Draco. He was bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet. “Your brain couldn’t come up with half of this shit.”
but there is nothing here, except her tea and her cottage and all these ghosts – there is nothing here but herself, and she is struck with the sudden and utmost fear that she can scream as loud as she wants and no one will hear.
Draco’s eyes darted towards the island and then away. “The sofa,” he said, showing no inclination to move there himself.
Draco leaned back and sighed in mock exasperation. When Harry looked over at him, his face looked how Harry’s felt.
The kitchen lighting was strangely flattering on Draco. “Yeah,” he said softly, looking back at him. “I do.”
“Honestly?” said Malfoy. “This isn’t even a real gay bar.”
Somethings you don’t realise you’ve thought until you’re saying them. And then once you’ve said them, it’s like everything else rearranges around them to make a bit more sense.
“The first thing you have to do,” Malfoy began, “is realise that Dragon-taming isn’t a sport. It’s an art.”
Harry took this moment to study Tom, instead. The robes made his presence seem quite big, sometimes, indeed filling this temple – but he was actually quite small, for a man. It was not just that he was short so much as it was that he simply seemed to have been set from a lesser mold. His hands, in particular, were slim and nimble where they were wrapped around the prayer beads, noticeably more so than Harry’s.
He just managed.
Oceania had already picked it up, both arms wrapped around the middle. She was holding it the way Harry would hold a box of feathers, or possibly, a single leaf.
Harry raised his brows. “Maybe,” he said, still smiling. “You’re being a bit presumptuous. Who’s stereotyping now?”
“It’s not that funny.”
“Do you want it?” Harry asked softly.
Later, once some offerings had been made and various other procedures that were probably quite interesting but that Harry hadn’t really paid much attention to, he separated from the rest of the group. The noise, the colours, the light – it was all very beautiful, but it was also – too much. Too much for Harry, anyway.
Malfoy didn’t say anything.
“How are you, Harry?”
The idea of Malfoy dating someone other than Pansy Parkinson felt very foreign. He tried to imagine Draco Malfoy, with his pointy shapes and outrageous mouth and floral leggings, in love, and it was a bizarre thing indeed. He hadn’t supposed Tom was Draco’s type – but what did Harry know anyway? Love was very strange.
“Was he?” he said, carefully.
The bald man raised his brows meaningfully, then stepped back to let Harry come in.
The walk back to the hotel felt longer than usual. The lines of the setting sun were sharp on his back.
She yanks open the cupboard, and grabs the tea cup that Potter used, and flings it across the room. The shards catch in her rug, the delicate china cracking open like an eggshell, and Potter will never use that tea cup again. She reaches for another one, just to watch it for a second time, and then she starts grabbing them by the handful, all these too many tea cups, hurtling them across the room, the sound of shattering filling her tiny lounge, and it doesn’t matter, none of it matters, because it
“You can touch it,” Harry offered, lifting his jaw.
Time was a funny thing when you were drunk. It had been a long night. Harry felt the warmth of the fire, licking up his side, and he closed his eyes.
Malfoy laughed easily and leaned forward towards Harry. “Are you going to take me to the ball, oh green Prince?”
“Well,” said Draco, after more awkward silence. “I was just on my way back home. So. I’ll just get going.”
“Do you want to be?”
Harry turned to Charlie. Charlie just raised a shoulder. “S’rules,” was all he said. Apparently, three rounds of shots were enough to finish him.
“Urm,” said Harry. “How’re you making the word socks sound so unsuitable?”
Harry presses her mouth against the starting swell of Draco’s bottom, and wraps an arm around the front of her hips to draw her closer as Draco opens her eyes and lets out a loud and decidedly feminine gasp.
“Harry,” said Malfoy, “Walk over, and give her the meat.”
“I’m not.”
“Would you like to come in?” she asked. “I’ll make you tea.”
Ginny kept tossing cautiously curious looks in Harry’s direction. He hadn’t talked to her since the year had started. He wasn’t actively avoiding her; however, he wasn’t actively trying to talk to her either. He kept him at a distance since the war. She needed time with her family and he just needed time. Now he just didn’t have it in him to talk to her, especially about something as serious as their relationship. It wasn’t good, or the right thing to do, but Harry also couldn’t bring himself to care about that either. The relationship just slipped away, ending quietly like so many important things seem to do. Disappearing into the night leaving the survivors wondering decades later ‘what had happened?’
“Then I will speak to you like godforsaken adults. Open your books to 136.” And just like that, he seemed to snap back to normal, with a wry smile. Everyone scrambled to pull their books to the right page. The small print of the text was crammed in tight trying to fit the over 30 step process on two pages accompanied with a graphic ink drawing of a hand going through all 5 stages of decomposition on each finger. From the totally normal-looking thumb all the way the bony remains of a pinkie. Several students shifted uncomfortably as they read the title of the potion.
“I think you’re scared.” Harry hit a nerve with that.
With no idea what else to do, tossing his bag down, Harry sat down beside Malfoy at stares into the mirror as well. Staring at his feet Harry tried to steal his courage before looking at the magic mirror. Feeling ready, Harry looks up into the Mirror of Erised.
Finally, the decaying stopped and for several long seconds, the students stayed silent, desperate to hear any sign of life from the small creature. It neither moved, nor sang, nor cried, nor blinked. It looked good and truly dead. Then after they started to question the sanity and ethic of their new professor, the bird’s body suddenly started to reform. The flesh and feathers snapped back into place, black turned into vibrant blue and the little thing started to wiggle.
Windswept their hair and their flushed cheeks. A smile growing on Harry’s face, revealing in the excitement of flying. He would never get tired of flying.
His eyes were milky white, like thick blinding film-coated his bronze irises. Whispers had instantly started to swim across the great hall the first night when he was introduced to the students as their new Transfiguration professor. “I heard he lost his sight when he botched a Lumos spell.” “I heard it was taken from him by a rogue aura.” “I think I read somewhere that you could lose it in a trade with a Gorgon in exchange to not be turned to stone.” “Pavarti told me it was from a run-in with a witch doctor in America.” Were just the start of the whispered statements Harry had overheard in the last few hours.
Seeing that the coast is clear, Harry slipped back out, trying to puzzle out where exactly in the mess of a storage room he is. No luck, everything looked the same and even if it didn’t, he had never spent enough time in the room to really even know what was where. He could just make out the stone arch doorframe over the top of piled wreckage.
Silently, Harry grabbed the pot of coffee and poured it to the brim of his cup. In the inky reflection, he could see a bastardized version of the early morning light off the Great Hall's enchanted ceiling, the soft blues turned stormy and clouds a heavy muddy color. The steam off the magically heated coffee fogged up his glasses and wafted with the soft scented notes of hazelnut.
“You don’t remember?” Professor Davies looked ready to let out a screaming tirade but stopped short as the bird on his shoulder started chirping excitably in his ear. He raised a hand up and pat it until it went silent, “You look Terrible, Mr…”
Harry was desperate to take in every detail, how the smoke curled from bewitched flames, the ornate designs of medieval objects every crack in the stone gothic window frames, in the hopes to paper over every burnt in detail of his nightmares. Maybe with enough inspection of a portrait, he could erase the way a body concaved under the falling building. Maybe the fresh air could almost cover up the memory of the rancid stench of decomposition and feel the thick level of grit that clung to his skin still. The sweat that was soaked into his hairline was finally cooling and drying in the nighttime air.
“I saw my family.” Harry added as well, “Dumbledore also hid the Sorcerer’s stone inside it.” Quick to change the subject, trying to avoid noticing the sad look on their faces.
“What about killing Harry?” Harry nodded in agreement what if he did want to hurt Harry or, worse, what if other people got hurt. At least Ron seemed to understand the gravity of the situation. Hermione just shook her head, unconvinced.
“Fantastic. We will have plenty.” Neville was beaming as he started to snip some plants at their base.
They split up, Harry heading in one direction while Neville and Luna went the other way, skimming the shore looking for Living Stones. The entire time they had an audience of birds talking all around them. Their combined sounds so loud they started to pound in Harry’s head. Mercifully within minutes, Neville called Harry over having found a patch of Living stones.
“I don’t see why taking a walk by myself should even be a rule worth breaking.”
“Let’s swim!” Luna suddenly stated, clapping her hands together in excitement.
Suddenly the bird started to melt like candle wax, the flesh and tissue pooling around it. Several students gasped, some even starting to tear up, covering their noses and turning away from the decaying body. Davies's smile just grew widened watching as the bird’s body turned from white and blue to oily blackness, “Keep watching.” He admonished several of the more squeamish students. Harry’s own stomach started to churn as the familiar signs of death were put on fast forward before him.
“Shut up Malfoy?” He never knew when to keep his mouth shut. “Not enough of a man for her?”
Malfoy only managed to pull his eyes away from the mirror for a few seconds, but when he saw the pendant, he looks unsettled, “You’re giving it back?”
floor.
“The ministry and McGonagall claim that they already took care of it. I highly doubt she would let it stay on the premises after…” Hermione went quiet, eyes darting side to side like the thoughts in her head were literally being tossed before them. “You say Malfoy’s been going there at night?”
“Who was he talking too?”
Checking back, he Saw Neville helping Luna into the deepest part of the lake, both with a protective bubble around them as well. Together the Trio started to swim for the opposite shore. Harry clutched his wand in his hand, keen to stay alert to anything else alive in the water.
As Malfoy turned a corner, Harry could just make out the discoloration around Malfoy’s eyes, sunken like in the bloody moors of the lake. The dark tones were made ever harsher by his sallow skin. A sickly look he had for several years now and something that didn’t evade Harry’s notice when he first saw him on the platform, hugging his mother before boarding the back most train car. Disappearing into the back of the train.
“Where do they bloody find these people,” Ron muttered, Harry had to agree, Hogwarts had a tendency to pull the eccentric into its shadows. The potion overall seemed relatively easy, it needed few ingredients and one or two needed to be harvested in a highly specific way. What seemed to be the biggest issue was the variability of it. When you add what ingredient determined how far the decay illusion went and one to many stirs clockwise here or there could make the ingested appear dead for only a few minutes or almost an entire day.
“You can’t seriously expect me to believe that you are just giving it back to me.”
“Then explain that.” He pointed in the vague direction of the Mermaid body, still tucked away in the inlet, as peaceful as they had found it.
Everyone worked in near silence, only a handful of whispers amongst friends seeking help on a confusing portion of instructions. The end of class was fast approaching as Harry tried to cut up the last few pieces of his main ingredient, wanting to get it simmering before class ended to increase its potency. Suddenly the floor shook as an explosive fireball burst in the back of the room.
This one is a long one darlings. Consider it a special gift to celebrate the wild day that was November 5th. It honestly gave me so much life and felt like the first time in a while that I felt truly happy for a few hours. It was positively euphoric and I hope you get the chance at that kind of feeling during the plague times.
“Why don’t you just tell McGonagall and be done with it?” Ron finally asked the question that had been pestering Harry for days. Hermione was quick to shake her head no, nocking a few frizzy curls into Ron’s face.
Slipping on his sneakers, Harry quickly and quietly sneaks out of the dorm room into the upper commons room. Below, the fire was still going. It never truly went out, just sort of dimmed in the nighttime.
“Well, there has got to be a reason that he is skulking the halls every night, messing with magic mirrors…”
Instead, this natural beauty was wasted on his wandered the empty halls hoping it would inspire his own mind to the same blessed emptiness. The piercing headache was a cold spike just below the surface, akin to an icicle falling from the highest tower straight into his skull. That blindingly powerful pain that magic, medicine, and alcohol had failed to maintain, now he was hoping the midnight wandering would do the trick.
The last thing he would always see was the empty wide pupil eyed stare. Movies lied; the dead never closed their eyes.
“How many times did you go see it?”
The heat was becoming stifling, his breath becoming shallow. He needed to get out of this room. Go somewhere else to clear his thoughts
Just over Malfoy’s head, Harry could just start to make out his own reflection in the mirror. The tall mirror in its slightly burnt gold frame liked slightly warped from the heat, the glass splotches, and dirty. However, it was still reflecting as clearly as the day Harry found it. It had been years since he laid eyes on the enchanted object. Unlike in the first year though, as Harry stared into the reflective surface, He saw nothing. All that was there was his reflection staring back. It looked like nothing more than a normal mirror. Maybe he wasn't close enough to see his desires or maybe it took longer to conjure. Before whatever desire the mirror could conjure for him, Malfoy stood up, “What are you doing here?”
“-rry. Harry!”
He didn’t want to admit to anyone, even himself when he started to notice a pattern. Whenever Malfoy wasn’t expected to be in class he would be loitering around the Room of Requirements. Meals were flexible, only going to the Great Hall once in the morning at least and he didn’t seem to go to his room to sleep for days on end.
“Okay.”
The snitch was hovering in the middle of the pitch just above the central line marker. Looking eyes with Malfoy Harry spread toward it, the two of them racing at breakneck speed towards one another in a twisted game of chicken. They were going to collide at any moment but the snitch didn’t move. They were either going to catch it, collide, or suddenly veer to miss one another and it seemed like neither was interested in the last option.
Slowly, the sound of scuffing heels grew louder as the unknown pursuer draws closer. A pale hand clutching a wand came into view as the man stops running. Their grip is white-knuckled, surely close to breaking their wand in half as they point it side to side. They are searching for Harry.
There was an unexpected glow cut, into his periphery view—a dulled red of light leaking through his closed eyes. Outside, just on the edges of the forbidden forest that was the orange glow streaming through the trees. It was too contained to be a forest fire, maybe a campfire or even lamplight. Hagrid must have been working in the forest again.
The handful of prints that were discernable amongst the mass seemed to all be the same size and smooth sole appearance. It seemed that it was definitely the same person coming to and from the room. The thought put Harry’s nerves on edge. Surely everything was destroyed in the fire, what could anyone possibly want in this room. There was nothing guaranteeing that though. What if the cabinet survived? What if there was still a secret back entrance into the school? Picking up the pace Harry weaved between piled-high objects following the footpath made by another.
“Ten points from Gryffindor for being out late.” Filch gave a vengeful smile like he just knew Harry would fall to the floor ready to beg for the points back. It would frustrate his house but even that didn’t really bother Harry much. A house cup didn’t feel like much anymore, just a polished pot of tin to be passed around every year.
Crawling into bed, He felt his tense muscle loosen ever so slightly since they were no longer needed to hold him up anymore. He didn’t bother removing his glasses, he wasn’t going to be sleeping anyway. His head was still pounding, by the rare chance, it wasn’t emanating from his scar. No, it was radiating from the back of his head. Like a Stinging Jinx was targeting the juncture of his spine, feeling like a rusty screw being twisted into his body.
floor and Harry still had no answer. Malfoy even stopped for a beat to stare him down, probing for answers. Even so, Harry still couldn’t say a thing.
“Have you ever known someone addicted to a substance?” Hermione’s voice grew high pitched, cracking with indignation. “Addiction can do horrible things to people. They can become so desperate for another hit of their addiction that they would willingly hurt themselves even potentially killing themselves in the process.”
“But this is just a mirror, Hermione, not some tainted bottles of Calming Draught.”
“Bloody terrible you mean. What’s up with all potion professors being a sod.” Ron was still a little red from his previous embarrassing blush
“Well, do we have to walk?” Neville asked, looking back at the quidditch pitch. It looked like a group of first years were in the middle of flying lessons but there were might a few brooms they could borrow.
Raising his wand, Harry readied himself to confront who or what was on the other side of the ornate furniture. Shifting his weight, readjusting his stance, the loud, tinkling grackle of delicate pearl rings in the air, crushed under the toe of his sneakers. Freezing up Harry stops breathing, straining to hear if the other occupant was alerted to his presence. There is utter silence.
He still looked a mess, hair, and face still singed from the accident in class. He clearly had just come straight here instead of going to the infirmary. His skin was an irritated red, most likely burned slightly from the sudden amount of heat caused by the fireball.
Taking his chance, Harry raised his wand, to confront the Slytherin. “Alright, Malfoy who are you talking to?” Harry rounded the corner quickly, aiming his wand right at Malfoy’s and his companion. The only problem was, Malfoy was all alone.
Like melting ice, the look of contempt on Malfoys face slide off into shock, “Where did you get that!?” He lashed out, trying to grab it, but Harry took three quick steps back and a safe distance away from Malfoy’s clutching fingers.
Every stray thought leads back to Malfoy. Any moment of undistracted thought kept going back to sitting next to Malfoy before the Mirror. What Hermione had said about the mirror was eating away at Harry. She made it seem so dangerous but when he saw the look on Malfoy’s face like it was the only true peace he had in years, Harry didn’t want to face the fact that he might have to take that away. He should tell McGonagall, even Hermione was starting to suggest it, but he didn’t know what would happen then. She might not hold this against Malfoy, but once the news was out it never went back into the bottle. As soon as people heard that Malfoy was back in the Room of Requirements there would surely be calls for his arrest.

year Slytherins, and the other two were paired off and avoiding making eye contact with him at any cost.
Walking out into the perfectly tripped pitch, Harry tossed the snitch high into the air and it took flight zipping off to join the clouds. Mounting his broom, Harry kicked off and joined it in the air.
Hermione though didn’t look so convinced, her eyes had that sharp edge to them, “It survived the fire? I figured it would have been destroyed by now.”
“Still, Malfoy could have bloody well exploded the entire room-“
A flurry of feelings bubbles up in Harry's stomach. It makes his nerves tingle pleasurably, his toes curl and his palms suddenly sweaty.  Adjusting his grip, Harry frowns unsure what to do with this development. Their staring contest ends when Malfoy’s eyes snap to something over Harry’s shoulders and in an instant, he rushes past Harry nearly knocking him off his broom.
He should tell them what he saw last night. They would want to know, wouldn’t they? Maybe. Hermione most likely would say he was overreacting, Ron was more likely to take his side. Though he too might not like the idea of staying up all night tracking Malfoy as they did as kids. Ron, more than most, had pushed hard to get past the pains of the last few years. Having the constant reminder of Fred’s absence at home had created an effect in Ron that craved mental distraction. Something Hermione fostered with pushing him to read muggle literature and even trying to improve her flying to join him on day trips. He was especially taken with the world of
“It is if you’re up to something.” Harry accused, hoping to egg him on. That seemed to actually make Malfoy deflate.
It raised its trident to pierce his chest when a sound caught its attention.
“Hey Mate,” Ron all but vaulted over the back of the nearby couch, disrupting reading 4rth year as she was bounced by the force. Harry gave her an apologetic smile, giving a small ‘sorry’ to the 4rth year who slammed her book shut with a huff and walked off. Ron noted Harry’s stormy expression, “What’s got you all gloomy?”
He felt like he needed to vomit what little food was in his stomach so far. How dare Malfoy make him feel like that again. What gave him the right to dig so deep under Harry’s skin and make him miserable. He had no right to control Harry’s emotions better than Harry could himself.
“No.”
“Just tired.” He shrugged waving to Luna as she passed, on her wait to the astronomy tower.
He didn’t know. He couldn’t really say why he cares at all.  All he could really say was that he did care and it was one of the strongest feelings he had in a while. They made it all the way to the 7
Harry’s chest tightened as he took in the way that the dusty light bounced around the man. He was sitting so still; the dust was starting to collect on him. For one sleeting moment, Harry was concerned that he like the other objects in this room would be there for the rest of the time.
Soon though, Malfoy’s attention was pulled back into the Mirror and it stayed there for hours. Harry stayed for hours as well, just being there watching Malfoy watch the mirror. The time stretched on and the tiredness, physical and emotional, truly set in.
“Bloody git didn’t even take points.” Ron looked thoroughly annoyed, stirring his cauldron with a bit too much gusto. “If it was one of us.”
They entered the Potions room. Most of the desks were taken except for ones in the very front, much to Hermione’s pleasure. The Trio headed that way. Harry couldn’t help but notice the small size and disproportion amount of Red to Green.
