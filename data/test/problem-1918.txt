“Draco,” Harry said from behind him, and Draco couldn’t help but turn. Harry had always relaxed in the forest. That invisible weight he carried on his shoulders lifting. He had even stopped frowning at he stared back at Draco, green eyes worried and caring. Draco used to love that he was the only one Harry showed this side of himself to. Now he wasn’t sure he deserved it—after everything he’d done to Harry, everything he wanted to do.
“Stop!” Draco shouted; he was almost embarrassed with how high his voice pitched. “Stop! Stop!”
"Oh, don't be like that, Draco." She rolled her eyes once before stepping into his personal space and wrapping her arms around him. He stiffened. She was hugging him. She was hugging him without his permission. Didn't she know the last person that had done that had been cursed three ways to Sunday? Granted it had been Pansy and she’d tried to fondle him but still…
"You're going to tell me there's nothing wrong with caring about people, but you're wrong," Harry said, trying to pull away from Severus. His eyes were wild, shinning with tears that Severus knew he wouldn't shed. "You're so wrong. I don't know how…" he trailed off before locking his eyes on Severus, a determined light appearing in them. He pulled away and this time Severus let him go, pacing across the room like a caged animal. "I can't feel this way. I can't."
"Nice try," Draco answered.
"Draco," Severus hissed, and Draco flinched. "If you cannot even control your emotions, how can you expect Potter to learn from you?" he asked, his voice coiling around Draco's mind and making him want to shiver. Draco shook Severus' mind off with a quick flick of his thoughts and met his eyes with cold anger.
with these people.
"Well, Slughorn seemed to like it!"
But Severus just continued to follow him, keeping pace behind him until Lucius finally lost his patience. He turned on his heel, stopping so suddenly Severus almost tumbled into him, barely avoiding contact. They stared at each other for longer than was necessary as the last fight they'd had still hung heavy between them.
"Maybe he truly cares for me," had been his response because he couldn't accept the fact that no one could possibly care about him.
So, they were walking to Hogsmeade, Granger and Weasley just a little ahead of them, and Harry walking with more distance between their bodies than he would have put even just a month ago. And Draco had no one to blame but himself.
Draco wrenched his mouth away with a loud gasp, their breathing echoing down the corridor around them, and Harry was suddenly painfully aware of their surroundings. He felt his face heat up, embarrassingly hot. He wasn't sure how his face could have gotten any redder but somehow, it must have. What if someone had walked in on them?
Harry curled his knees up to his chest and put his head in his hands. He was

"Good, okay. Then we need someone else to keep students away from the Slytherin commons while Harry and I sneak in and have a look around."
He shied away from the image, somewhere between fury and heartbreak, determined to feel neither of them and knowing he was doomed before he even started. Hermione had a pitying expression on her face, and he supposed he understood more of what she was feeling from watching Weasley snog someone else than he wanted to admit. What good would it do to slap someone Harry wanted when he knew he wasn’t any good for Harry?
"Harry!" Hermione said. Malfoy smiled, reaching forward to close his hand around the glowing sphere in Harry's hands. Suddenly, Harry pulled his hand back a second before it touched Malfoy’s hand.
He turned his face up to the ceiling and let out a long sigh, closing his eyes and letting himself go to the darkness around him.

"Just get to safety," Nymphadora said. "We'll make sure to get them."
"No, I was just too distracted to eat much at dinner last night," she said, and he could relate to that.
"There you are," he said, his voice low and only slightly hostile. It was almost impressive. "Do you—"
Blaise froze when the sirens started up, echoing down the corridor around them and shrieking into his ears. Luna turned toward him with her bright blue eyes wide.
"I will do my best to make that happen."

"Why don't you sit? I have a feeling we're going to be here for a while."
"He was there!" someone was suddenly saying and then Cornelius Fudge was stepping through the crowd. "I saw him, it was You-Know-Who, I swear, he grabbed a woman and Disapparated!"
to be here, Weasley?" Draco answered.
to make it messy like he liked all the attention on himself." Harry sighed, picking at his school robes distractedly. "People always say I look just like my father but suddenly that doesn't seem like such a good thing anymore."
Severus tried to back pedal, to back away, but the Squid was already there, its tentacle connecting with him and sending both him and the first year back in the water several paces. He felt the sickening plunge in his stomach as his bubblehead charm popped, and he could see the first year's bubble had done the same.
"We have so much homework from Runes," Granger said before turning her large brown eyes on him. "Right, Draco?" He blinked in surprise before answering, wondering why she was talking to him when Weasley and Harry were right there.
Draco asked, dropping his hand from his face. Harry was crying now, his cheeks wet. “You have no idea, do you?” Draco asked. “You have no idea how good you are, Harry Potter.”
wouldn’t mind, but that didn’t mean he deserved to move and act and pretend as if….
"I-," Lucius started but was cut off by the searing pain in his forearm. He clamped a hand down on the place on his arm where his Dark Mark was permanently seared into his flesh. His eyes flicked up, latching onto Severus', who had a look of identical pain in his dark iris'.
. He hiccupped, clutching his throbbing ribs, and wishing he'd never followed Hermione and Ron down here. They were going to-
"I’ve told you I’m done with the Order,” he said. “It’s cost me enough.”
He didn't waste any time before heading to Slughorn's office, knocking twice to make sure he wasn't in the room before pulling out his wand. He unlocked the door with a flick and pushed it open, stepping inside and looking around. He knew that Slughorn had some mead bottle he was planning to give to Dumbledore as a present.
"Why aren't you eating lunch?" he asked, changing the subject before she could ask too much about Draco. As far as he knew, most of the school now knew Draco and he were an item—whatever that meant. He'd gotten a few funny looks at first, some glares, some doe eyed girls—one had even congratulated him, asking him his secret until his glaring scared her off—but most everyone was used to avoiding him, and they weren't going to change now.
"-does not tell you everything," Lucius interrupted with a long sigh. "Oh, it's not his fault. Not in the slightest, it's just that there's some things he
"And why is that?" Lupin croaked.
"Yeah, he's a spy. Been one for years; he's going to lead your precious Potter straight to the Dark Lord and no one will ever know."
It was just… He cared about Draco. He cared, and how could he condone being the cause of Draco’s life being imploded. No matter how conflicted he had been about Draco and Potter being together, he knew when he needed to take a step back. Because at least with Potter, Draco wasn’t alone. And as a Werewolf, if Draco was with Blaise, he would always be alone.
It came sooner than he expected it to.
"Damn you, Potter," she snapped, her silver-grey eyes flashing angrily. "Why aren't you capable of making an intelligent decision?"
The worst part was seeing the frustration in Professor Snape's eyes. An unyielding conviction that 'he should have been doing more,' though both of them knew he couldn't. It was enough for him that Professor Snape was even there. Even with all his prickly edges and insulting bards, the one thing he knew before anything else was that Professor Snape actually cared. Maybe he didn't care about him, but he cared what happened to him. It was an interesting feeling. An unfamiliar feeling. He supposed he should have already felt it, what with being friends with Hermione and Ron. But he had always felt that Ron was more friends with his scar than him and Hermione was just too bossy and careful for him to really feel she cared about him.
The Look from above him.
Draco put his hands along Harry's waist, running them down and stopping just before he reached his trousers. He tugged Harry’s shirt, gently, making his intention clear, and Harry froze against him. Harry leaned back, his mouth leaving Draco's with a wet pop that shouldn't have gone straight to his cock but did anyway. And Harry was panting as he looked up at Draco through his eyelashes, green eyes wide, and if he was anyone else Draco would have accused him of teasing.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m not-.”
"What are you going to do?" Harry asked, eyeing Severus' wand.
"Draco?" Harry answered, slapping Ron on the back as he continued to make gagging noises. "What does this have to do with Draco?"
“Right, of course,” he said. “The name’s Justin Adarins. I’m the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.”
"And I'm so happy with my life," Snape answered, and it was Harry's turn to sigh because he really didn't have an answer to that.
"Professor Adarins," McGonagall frowned at him, her spectacles low on her nose. "It's not as if there's any rule-."
“I hesitate to put you on the stand, Mr. Malfoy,” Woods answered. “Right now we have a good handle of their accusations regarding you, but if you go up and answer one question wrong, there may be no salvaging the case.”
“Um, I should get to Potions,” Neville said. Hermione and Ron looked just as thrown, eyes wide and full of shock and confusion. He figured they were all trying to decide whether Draco was just being a twat or if he was serious.
to drive himself insane.
the voice to hurt, whatever it was. "Even terribly hurt. But never die. Never that. And you're supposed to grow old with some- some woman you love." Hands tightened against his skin, sending a fresh wave of pain through him. He tried to withdraw but the voice was talking again before he could. "And have twenty perfect children and never think of me again..." He suddenly wanted to pull away from the voice. What it was saying certainly didn't
"As if it was hard," he answered, and there was something about his flippant tone that made Draco narrow his eyes.
"Harry Potter," Hermione snapped, making Harry look up at her in befuddlement. "Stop being so stupid."
"I…" Harry started, his face already tucking itself against Draco's neck.
"Well?" Umbridge said finally. "What are you waiting for? Arrest him!" There was a loud bang as two of the Aurors surged forward. Then Draco was suddenly there, pushing him down hard. His body was heavy as he pinned Harry to the ground, hexes flying above them. Fawkes screeched, and a large cloud of black dust filled the air. Harry coughed, his nose hitting Draco's chest as sound of breaking glass filled the room and then—silence. Harry shoved Draco roughly away from him, moving to his feet and wobbling. Draco grabbed his arms, steading him before he could fall, and Harry shoved him away again.
“I’m saying that we could help each other,” Lucius said. “You work with Scrimgeour—”
"But does that make you happy?" Harry asked.
Harry stared hard at the back of Draco’s head, watching as he looked from one shop to another, point at the window of the broom-shop before turning back to Harry with that half smirk of his that suggested he had
“Father, I need to do this,” Draco answered. He was staring down at the tea in his hands, and he suddenly looked so young. He had bags under his eyes from how he hadn’t been sleeping, his hair a mess, his shoulders pulled into his body. Lucius hated to admit it, but whatever was going on, it was really bothering Draco.
Draco was sitting in the back of the library with his feet propped up and pretending to read a book. He was actually looking out the window and watching people leave. He caught sight of Potter's unruly hair as he passed the Great Doors immediately. Of course, Cho Chang was right by his side, standing so close she could have been holding his hand. He turned his face away as he saw Chang start laughing at something Potter had said.
Potter was even worse than usual that night in Occlumency. His mind was unfocused, even when Severus broke through it was just a haze of images leading down a spiral path that made little to no sense. The only reoccurring image was the door in the Department of Mysteries. Draco could sense Harry's desire to see what was on the other side and he knew Severus was just as frustrated as Draco was.
"Granger and Weasley?"
Thanks for reading!
“Draco,” Harry exhaled, his hands wrapping around Draco’s shoulders and clutching as if he was afraid he was about to jump up and run. “Don’t.”
we here?" Luna asked, eyeing the Dementors warily. One turned toward them, gliding a few feet in their direction before veering sharply to the side. Harry felt himself shiver.
"I thought perhaps…" Severus sighed, setting his tea down on the table beside him, his dark eyes focused passed Lucius. "I knew we hadn't been seeing eye to eye on a few things. I thought perhaps you were...upset with me disagree with you. And if this is how it's going to be when I don't just agree-."
They stood in front of the cauldron of poison, watching it bubble. It didn't look affected. It looked the exact same as when they'd finished it. As when they'd left it. There was no visible evidence that it had been tampered with.

He'd felt that way with Lily. Had done so many things he regretted because of that feeling. And it wasn't that he wanted to make the same mistakes with Lucius, he just didn't know how to stop it.
told Umbridge and I'm just as inclined to believe it was Malfoy than anyone else."
"What do you mean?" Potter asked. Draco blinked at him; he wasn’t serious. He couldn’t be. There was no way Harry Potter didn’t know where his useless giant friend was. "What do you know, Draco?" he asked the question softly, with absolutely none of the malice Draco expected to hear from him, and Draco didn’t know how to respond to that tone.
"Oh," Draco answered. And in that moment, he couldn't help but be grateful that even though Weasley didn't know, he understood. He figured he would never like him, but maybe he could at least stop hating him. Maybe. He owed him that after almost killing him. "Thank you."
"I think that's enough for now," Dumbledore said, cutting easily through Harry's thoughts.
"What?" Ron's face turned an ashen color as he sat bolt upright. "Harry's not gay; I'd’ve known!"
don't seem to care whether you live or die!"
"Always looking through history books," Lovegood continued when he didn’t respond. "I would say the wrackspurts got you, but I don't see any around your head." Harry had to look up at that, to know just what Lovegood was talking about this time. She had a pair of brightly colored glasses on, staring at him with wide eyes and a curious tilt of her head as she considered him. He sighed and did the obvious thing.
"Your godfather really let this place go," Draco muttered, examining the walls with his nose wrinkled.
"I think I can figure it out," Draco snarled, baring his canines on reflex. Immediately, he sat back again, swallowing hard. He
"Never you mind," Grubbly-Plank answered, before moving away from them. Draco smirked, taking her place beside Harry to scoop up whatever ridiculous thing they were supposed to be studying.
"It was nothing," he said. "I'll be fine."
you." Potter went pale, his eyes flicking away from Draco’s face. He looked nauseous.
"What's going on in here?" Harry asked, his green eyes flicking between Nott and Draco, glasses reflecting the light back.
"Come back to me," the voice said, soft, sinful, entirely human and familiar.
He's always interested to hear my take on the day's news. And Ambrosius Flume, of Honeydukes…" he continued on, prattling about who was in what portrait and who they were. What they had accomplished and how they still thought of him. Draco tried to resist the urge to tell him to shut up, but it was hard, especially when he just wouldn't. Eventually, he came to a stop, smiling broadly over at his cabinet of photos.
Once, Draco came down from his orgasmic high, he locked eyes with Harry and realized that he was looking up at him with wide surprised eyes. Draco made an effort to close his eyes. He was such an idiot. What was he
Then, Draco Malfoy, heir to the Malfoy line, had had to sit in Umbridge's muggy office and listen to how she had almost caught Draco's—sort of, almost—lover fire calling someone he may or may not be involved with. Seriously, if he was already with someone, he shouldn't act so attached to Draco.
"Could you be louder?" the other person asked, a low annoyed grumble of sound, and Draco felt as if he was about to fall over.
"About what?"
He opened his eyes. Potter's wand was raised, the shield held up between the dragon's breath and them, and he didn't know how Potter could possibly have gotten his wand up fast enough, but it was clear he had saved them. Blaise opened his mouth to warn him, watching as Bellatrix was raising her wand, but all he managed to do was stare as Bellatrix's curse caught Potter straight in the chest, blasting him across the ground with a loud scream that send a chill through Blaise.
"So," Draco rolled his eyes. "Why were we running away, Potter?"
"Exactly," Malfoy answered, the smirk playing across his lips for half a second before it was gone.
"It's about Draco!" Blaise said, and Potter froze. It was a minuscule movement, but it was still enough that he could see the muscles along Potter's shoulders tense and constrict as he stood with his back to Blaise. He supposed Potter did have a heart after all. Who knew? "Just listen. If you don't like what I have to say then tell me to get lost, but don't you think you should at least listen?"
Again, thank you so much for reading and I hope to see you on These Bare Eyes.
“I don’t expect you to.”
"Why are you telling us this?" Weasley asked, narrowing his eyes suspiciously. "What do you expect us to do?"
"Mr. Malfoy, without seeing it, I must say it will be a very difficult job, perhaps impossible." Borgin licked his lips. He looked nervous. Draco wished he was even more nervous. He wished he was nervous enough that Draco didn't have to make any veiled threats. "I couldn't guarantee anything."
"I'm fine, Hermione."
"I think it’s fascinating," Hermione said as they stepped out of the greenhouse, heading up the path toward the castle. "It makes absolute sense to know as much about Voldemort as possible. How else will you find out his weakness?"
"The ring, Harry!" Draco yelled again, sounded exasperated. "Grab the ring!"
"Is he allowed to do that?" Lucius whispered, raising an eyebrow after Harry.
"Where?" Harry asked, and the emotion was gone from his face so fast, Draco was half convinced he'd imagined it in the first place. Except he knew. He knew now what Harry did to avoid his emotions.
“And why was that?”
"What?" Potter asked, blinking idiotically behind his glasses. "But—"
"But what fun would that be?" the witch answered.
"But what if he doesn't come?” he asked. “You know he needs these lessons, Severus."
"Strange man, Professor Snape," Umbridge said once the door closed behind him. "You trust him, Draco?"
"How do you know? How do you know anything about being a werewolf? I can explain some of things you're feeling."
"I didn't say that," Lucius interrupted, his hand so tight on his walking stick, it was almost white. "I just want to know what's really going on."
"NO!" he shouted. "NO, that's not true! Professor Dumbledore didn't—"
was here, not him. It wasn't as if she and Harry were… Or at least, last he'd checked she and Harry hadn't been…
“I thought-.”
He was panted, pressed against Draco with his mouth swollen and his eyes averted, and it took a long minute for Draco to realize what he’d done. Draco pulled his hands away from Harry arse, laying his arms flat against the bed.
"I…" his eyes flicked to Harry. "I believe that this is what Dumbledore wanted to happen. I believe that to defeat Voldemort we need to trust people we may not have normally trusted." He looked pointedly at Lucius before focusing back to Severus. "You need my help."
"Well, no," Harry interrupted. "Not like that. It would be small, something important, probably have something to do with one of founders."
He stared across at the Giant Squid, its red eye blinking at him slowly. And it took Severus a second too long to realize the strange golden piece of metal floating in the water between them was actually the locket Horcrux that had been around his neck. The Squid must have somehow knocked it lose.
"Get them!" his father screamed, causing the shudders already wracking Draco's body to suddenly intensify.
He walked through the large space, finding his way easily now that he knew what he was looking for. He'd found the cabinet by accident too. He'd thought it was interesting that it was the exact copy of the one in Borgin and Burkes but hadn't given it a second thought until Voldemort had shown up at his house and demanded…
"No," Draco glared, his eyes shining as if he was about to start crying. Lucius rather hoped not, he rather hoped he'd trained Draco better than that. "I trusted you never to lie to me."
"I don't see how that's your business?"
"Hmm." She tilted her chin up, throwing her nose in the air and left the compartment in a huff, slamming the door behind her.
"Maybe he heard our voices," Lucius argued, and Severus gave him a long look that told him how unlikely that was.
"But-," Harry started.
"It just takes time, Potter," Draco answered, his face turned resolutely away. "Don't get impatient."
"Ah, you got my note," he said, and Harry blinked when he turned his attention promptly away as if Harry was some nuisance his day required him to deal with. "Ready to go, then," it wasn't a question. Malfoy was already standing, his back to Harry as he grabbed his wand off the desk, sliding it into the holster along his thigh.
following me?" Harry answered, soaking in the anger rippling across Malfoy's face.
"You keep saying that," there was a swoosh of robes, and Draco imagined Lucius was crossing the room to stand in front of Harry. He imagined Harry continuing to focus on his wand, refusing to give Lucius the satisfaction of looking up at him as he wanted. "But I get the feeling you know exactly what he thinks." There was a beat of silence and then Lucius spoke again, his voice loud and angry. "Damn you, Potter, I deserve the truth."
"Of course," Dracona answered, and her figure shifted to the side, leaning even further down, long blonde braid draped over her shoulder as she did. He just saw her wand arm gesturing down, the flick that meant she was pointing her wand at him. He supposed he should be wary; it wouldn't be the first time she'd cursed him. But at the same time, he
"Wait," Harry whispered, moving his hand along Draco's cheek and clutching at the back of his neck. "Just... Wait," he could hear the pleading edge to his voice, but he couldn't bring himself to care. He just didn't want Draco to turn away from him again. Not when he knew the truth.
"Harry?" Lucius asked.
The brown mist began to thin as they reached the landing for the stairs. Obviously, it was meant to be contained on the fourth floor. Blaise didn't know why—couldn't think past getting to the stairs and away from the mist that was burning along his skin, mixing with his sweat and getting into his lungs every time he breathed. Luna coughed next to him, running with her fingers wrapped around his, and he didn't know how much longer they could keep going.
"Why are you here, Lucius? What is the point of pretending there's anything more to this?"
"What?" Sprout answered. "We can't just leave our students down here!"
"I'll carry Hermione, and you carry him," Longbottom said, already reaching down to clasp his hands under Granger's ribcage and lifting her up and over his shoulder. Harry hesitated and then nodded, offering his back as a piggyback for Draco again. Draco climbed back up and they took off in the opposite direction that his father had used to drag him in.
He saw a 5-year-old Harry, with the same unruly hair and large spectacles slipping off his face. Draco's heart beat with affection and he forced himself to focus. He saw how the Harry’s face was twisted with jealousy. The 5-year-old Harry was watching a fat muggle boy ride a shining red bicycle, laughing and point at Harry as if…. Suddenly Harry was nine, still gangly and skinny and looking as if he was running for his life from a large pit bull that was chasing him half up a tree. Draco's heart swelled with sympathy as he saw a group a very fat muggles watching and laughing and knew instinctively that they were
, Harry thought. And he closed his eyes and felt the transformation ripple through him.
"Why are you asking me that?"
"You Gryffindors really are dense, aren't you?" Blaise Zabini said after a minute of this.
"That's why you let him kill you," he said, and was horrified when his voice came out a gasping little whisper. Harry just turned his face further away as if he couldn't bear to look at Draco, which was infuriating. Well, the whole situation was infuriating. And Draco knew he shouldn't be mad at Harry, but he was. He was beyond angry at him.
"What?" Ron answered, setting his won firewhiskey down with a clack. "But he's working with-."
He couldn't help remembering Harry and Chang's date to Hogsmeade. He'd never heard exactly how that'd gone; apparently bad enough to decide Harry really didn't like her, or maybe that had just been the kiss under the mistletoe. Draco shook his head to get rid of those thoughts as they continued into Hogsmeade. He'd rather not think about Chang and Harry together, actually.
"Ok."
"Leave it alone," Draco interrupted, silently making a note to himself that he and Harry would talk about Ginny later. Add it to the list of things they needed to talk about.
"Go annoy someone else, Pansy."
He’d tried. He really had, but every time he saw Harry looking at him with regret or guilt or something of the sort, the anger and hurt just came rushing back. So, he was civil because he knew he was being petty, but somehow that had only seemed to make Harry angry. And now he couldn’t even pretend to be civil in public anymore, and the anger felt so far away now that he couldn’t apologize.
"Does that mean…. that one of us has got to… kill the other…. in the end?" Harry asked.
"Lupin?" Luna asked, her eyes widening a touch.
"I prefer to think we were saving our skins from a madman," Draco answered.
"Are you ok?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Lucius didn't like Dumbledore. He didn't like The Order of the Phoenix. He didn't like the way the old man smiled at him and asked about his dead wife as if he actually cared what had happened to her. He didn't like the way Mad-Eye Moody stared at him with that magical eye as if he could see all the Malfoy secrets. And he especially didn't like how they all looked down their noses at him. He was a Malfoy, a pure-blood, powerful wizard with twice the bloodline and social standing as any of them and they had the audacity to act as if they were better than him. It made him want to curl his lip and curse them all.
Then Hagrid had returned the next day. Draco had been right, he'd been sent on a mission to try and get the giants to help the Order defeat Voldemort, but Harry wasn't quite ready to tell his friends that he already known where Hagrid had gone. He did, however, want to talk to Draco about everything he had learned. He also wanted to ask him why he'd been avoiding him. And he just wanted to see him—even if he wasn't allowed to touch him.
"And if I said yes?"
"Yeah," Twin Weasley 2 answered. The look of pure panic in Harry's eyes sent a spike of anger through Draco. Did the Weasley's not have a
They got around the next corner and half-way down the corridor before Harry stopped abruptly, twisting away from Draco's hand to face him, and Draco tried not to let that bother him as he let his hand drop back to his side. Harry's green eyes were narrowed and dark with suspicion, and he was opening his mouth to probably make some accusation about Draco's possessive behavior when Draco beat him to the punch.
"Ah, Harry Potter," he said, his voice rasping across the space between them. Harry's lips twitched, looking back at him without hesitation. Voldemort thought he was so horrifying. He thought he was the worst thing that has ever happened to Harry. "It's been a long time."
"That wasn't the point I was making," Severus sighed.
"Because, I think, he is ashamed of what he remembers," Dumbledore answered, and Draco supposed he could understand something like that, but it was still the wrong way. He wondered how many lives Slughorn had cost because of the information he'd given, how many he continued to cost because of his incapability with fessing up to what he'd done.
"No. I was the one who didn't want to use the wolfsbane."
Lucius hesitated, a large shadow passing to his right. He looked but saw nothing. Kenny tugged on his sleeve, whimpering something he couldn't understand, and Lucius sighed. He paddled forward another few paces. They were angling up as they went, and Lucius was sure he was just beginning to see light ahead of them.
“What about the ministry?” Harry asked. “They’re investigation into Draco?”
Thank you for all your wonderful comments!! You all are the absolute bestest!
"And do you have a reason for wondering around the halls or are you trying to worry your precious fan group, so you can garner more attention for yourself." He paused delicately while Harry tried to resist the urge to punch him. "Perhaps you’re pretending to be kidnapped so they’ll believe you when you proclaim that another Dark Lord has risen, Hmm?"
his Godfather flinch when Harry said the name, though
Then it was Draco, holding his hand out to Harry, an affectionate smile on his lips.
“It is.”
Draco brought his free hand up, skimming it across Harry's cheekbone before resting it on his shoulder and staring. Harry looked back on him, his eyebrows furrowed as if he truly couldn't understand what Draco was doing. He sighed. He should have known better than to try to be subtle.
Draco heard Harry and the others return later that day but didn't leave his room. He was a bit hurt that Harry didn't come looking for him. It wasn't like Draco was in an unexpected place, but he wasn't surprised. Of course, Harry would rather be with his Weasleys now that his moral issue had been solved. He just laid across his bed, refusing to look for Harry and being pathetically attached and unwanted.
And he still didn't pull away from Draco's grasp.
"No."

"Besides, even if you

His smile faded. He would have given anything for his life to be so simple.
making progress with closing the barriers around his mind. But
When they stepped out onto the pitch, he stopped wondering what had made Malfoy angry and started concentrating on
"I'm off to shower," Draco said, though he doubted anyone cared. He stepped around Sirius Black, heading out of the room, but Harry grabbed his wrist before he crossed the threshold, stopping him in his tracks.
"You can teach me," Harry said. "Dumbledore said you could."
This is the sequel to These Broken Moons. It's much more oriented toward defeating Voldemort than These Broken moons and the plot is going to be moving quite a bit quicker. However, there's also going to be a lot with Harry learning to trust and that to love is ok. I really don't plan on going too in depth with the rape recovery though it will be touched on. There will be sexual encounters and details about Lucius and Severus' relationship, though this will be more focused on Harry and Draco's relationship. Horcruxes do exist in this universe. There's also going to be a bit of Draco coming to terms with being a werewolf. I didn't go for the canon werewolf, just what was convenient for the story.
Dracona wouldn't hurt him, not really.
"I'm going to break into Gringotts."
"We people are such funny things, you know," the witch continued, talking as if she'd never spoke. "We'd rather sacrifice a hundred people than the one that we love."
"Not at all," Severus said, lowering his wand. "Potter's just doing a little remedial potions, is all."
about the consequences."
to Malfoy until tomorrow. After all, Malfoy would still need to go over the case, make sure he knew the facts, get the details. He'd only gotten the file last night, while Harry had had it for over a week.
“You were too busy people watching,” Draco huffed, tilting his chin up as if that would really make Harry care.

"What're you yelling about, Harry?" Ginny asked, tilting her head as she stared at him.
It was stupid, but it was still just as true.
"That was—" Harry started, determined to tell Draco how he'd saved the lot of them. Then Umbridge's voice sounded, echoing down the hall and easily cutting across Harry's words.
"Fine, I get it, it's not my place, but I do think you should talk to someone," he said. "And you do happen to have a very nice boyfriend, who seems to be more than willing."
“You’re jealous of Remus Lupin?”
Harry was curled up in a ball, sleeping when the Hogwarts Express arrived. He'd been perched at the very tip top of his favorite tree; his claws were hooked into the wood to keep him from falling when the damn conductor had blown his whistle right by the forest, sending Harry's bones in a scramble.
"So," he hesitated, and then forged on. Nothing for it now. "You and Potter?" Draco stopped walking, turning to look at him with intense silver-grey eyes that were just a touch too defensive.
Ron was ecstatic that Harry seemed to have cut off all contact with Malfoy. He'd said one 'good riddance' and then hadn't made another comment about Malfoy’s complete disappearance from their conversations and lives.
"You've done that before?" he asked.
"And Severus," Draco said. "There's one more thing." Severus raised an eyebrow, silently asking for Draco to continue. "I want to join the Order of The Pheonix." He was almost proud that his voice didn't shake.
an office, with a desk and everything, up in Dark Arts Retrieval—desk.
“I’m full of complements,” he answered, and Harry laughed, barely an exhale of a chuckle but it was still there. He was so different when he smiled, his whole face brightening. Weasley choked, eyes flicking between them with something close to disbelief. He opened his mouth to say something that was probably horribly profound but the door to the Hog's Head opened before he could.
Wormtail had taken his blood and raised Voldemort. He'd seemed surprised when he didn't bother to struggle, when he didn't bother to say anything, when he didn't bother to do anything but stare at Cedric's lifeless corpse. But Cedric was dead, leaving him cold and empty in a way he'd never felt before. He thought he had. Oh, he thought he had known what it had felt like to hurt, to be empty inside, but he hadn't.
"Harry!" Luna yelled, and there was a loud screech as the dragon yanked against its chains, moving toward and away, flapping its wings and trying to take flight but being unable to.
that. He knew that Harry didn't trust easily. But it hurt that after everything, Harry was still standing in front of him with secrets that he thought he couldn't share with Draco.
"What
"Leaving so soon, Draco," Severus asked, and Draco froze. "Is it wise to be wandering the halls on a night like this? If you were to be caught, Dumbledore—"
"Don't try to distract me," he answered. "Besides, if you were Slytherin, you wouldn't have a problem hiding your true feelings."
"I don't need Harry to protect me from you."
"No," Draco said, and this, at least, seemed to break Harry's control. He blinked at Draco, looking surprised for half a second before he turned his head, a sneer blooming across his face.
"So, what?" Draco asked. He was scowling, his lips turned down in that way he had when he was thinking hard. "Merope used a love potion to make Riddle love her?"
Draco flinched, taking a step away from him and clamping his jaw on the pain and frustration that lashed through him. He hadn't realized how much he'd been craving Potter's kind words—the gentle way he'd been helping, leading Draco forward—until he was denied.
"Not till morning at least."
But Severus didn't this time. He couldn't. He'd seen Harry take three steps forward; he couldn't watch him go leaping back. He couldn't watch him destroy himself. Not again. Not after killing Dumbledore. Not after the mess with Lucius.
"Well, I was wondering if you-," Draco started.
"I try," Harry's lips curved up into that thin half-amused smile of his.
"You should try it," Draco said. "It'll probably make you feel better." Hermione wasted three seconds glaring at him before she turned her face away and smiled, small and hesitant, and Draco knew he'd won.
“People have nightmares,” he said, studying the board again. Though honestly, only one piece had moved, what could he have possibly needed to look so hard at?
He stepped out of them, taking Harry by the hand as he backed toward the bed. Harry followed him easily, his green eyes never leaving Draco's face. On instinct, Draco sank down on his back, pulling Harry on top of him, cradling Harry’s hips between his knees, sliding his hands down and under the waistband of Harry's pants before.
Harry gasped, wrenching his eyes open to reveal not the alluring green that stunned Draco every time he saw them but the red snake eyes of the Dark Lord himself. Draco cried out, clutching Harry, his Harry, and blinking back the wetness lingering on his eyelashes. He would not cry. He wouldn’t.
"Well, there are certain things that My Lord wants-."
" Draco said, putting an absurd amount of emphasis on the word. "Just how many boys are you meeting in the middle of the night, Potter?”
“One shouldn’t listen to rumors,” Severus told him, and he knew the stiffness of his voice wasn’t helping anyone.
"What?" Harry blinked, somehow managing to look away from Malfoy's fluttering eyelashes. Seriously, how did he have such long eyelashes?
Harry let out a breathy whimper and arched his back, pulling at his wrists and trying to make Malfoy's hand move just a
"Yes…" Harry answered, dropping his eyes to the table. Then he seemed to realize what he was doing and raised them to look at Draco defiantly. "What about it?"
"We make another batch," Severus gestured at the diadem, flicking his eyes away and locking back onto Harry. "And we test it."
"Why did you help me if you didn't care?" he asked, watching as Harry flinched away from him, recoiling into himself.
“I know,” Granger said. “But maybe it’s a start?” And he almost said no; he almost threw her offer in her face, but he
“It’s alright to be angry, you know,” she told him, her voice annoyingly steady, calm.
“I-,” Harry turned his head away, feeling confused and pressured and stuck. “I just don’t know what we’re doing.”
"You're Draco Malfoy?" Slughorn asked, his voice pitching low. "Lucius Malfoy's boy." Draco just looked at him, clapping his jaw down to stop the curses he wanted to spew at the sound of his father's name. He saw Harry tense, his hand half rising from his lap before dropping back down.
"I think I will go find, Potter." Severus said abruptly, and Draco's eyes widened. "He's been alone too long."
"I…" Severus shuddered, closed his eyes for a moment, and then locked his gaze back on Lucius. "I have to tell you something, Lucius…"
"No, though I'm sure the Dark Lord would prefer sooner rather than later."
"Mr. Nott," Severus said, leaning forward. It was easy to keep the tremor out of his voice, after all he'd had plenty of practice before now. But it was harder to intimidate the boy as he leaned forward and fixed his eyes on him. Nott just stared back, a vicious gleam appearing in his gaze. "I think you need to seriously consider what you're insinuating."
"Snape and him were both just complainin' abou' Dumbledore bein' on their cases abou' somethin'."
“I’m talking to you,” he answered.
"Who?"
He launched himself out of the tree, digging his claws through Draco's hair and into his skin. Draco howled, reaching around with long claws. Harry twisted, but Draco just barely managed to catch Harry along his back and down his leg. Harry yowled, losing his grip as Draco managed to fling him off. And he watched as Werewolf Draco didn't bother to cast him a second look, stalking toward Granger, Weasley, and Zabini, who were staring at them with wide terrified eyes.
"You know, maybe they wouldn't stare so much if you were there more."
"Draco Malfoy's not actually so bad anymore," she interrupted. "I've worked with him a couple when we had to prosecute some tricky Dark Arts cases. He's really changed since school."
"I wanted to… well, I need your… advice."
Draco was
“What?”
Even after he married Narcissa, even after Abraxas had died, even after he'd had Draco, even after Severus had started speaking to him again, he hadn't been able to step away from the lessons his father had taught him. Traditions were the things that were steady. The things that didn't change. The things to be relied on.
"Now," Malfoy said, releasing the spell with a flick of his wand. Draco slumped, held up only by the hair in his father's hands. "Care to cooperate, Potter?" Harry immediately held out the prophecy, his hand visibly trembling.
It was easy to follow them. Even if Draco didn’t have more than enough practice watching Potter, Weasley’s hair would have been enough. He raised an eyebrow when they ducked into the Hog’s Head but curiosity made him follow. Potter saw him first, but he just dropped him eyes to the trio's table and played with his butterbeer glass. Weasley saw him next. He jumped up from the table, turning to face Draco with his fists clenched.
Everyone looked up at him when he walked in, Weasley frowning at him from his bed without excess hostile, leaving Draco slightly surprised. Harry must not have told him, which left Draco with a bitter taste in his mouth. Hermione and the weaslette both scowled at him but said nothing as he approached Harry's bed.
And Draco cried out, a horrible sound that was half between a whine and a growl as Lupin lunged and both he and Harry fell to the ground. Draco took a step forward as they rolled, and he heard Harry's sharp shout of pain, but his hands were tied behind him, and he didn't have a wand. He struggled against the ropes, pulling uselessly.
"You— You're not mad?" Harry asked, sounding a second away from getting defensive if Draco answered in the affirmative.
destroy him."
He wanted to talk to Potter. To say something—anything that might make up for what had happened in the woods. Not that he even understood what had happened, but he did understand that Potter was upset. And he understood that he had crossed some kind of line that he had
"I thought you weren't interested in her anymore?" Hermione asked, her smile sweet and deadly. "Or have I missed something important?"
"You don't know what you're doing, mate," Weasley said, his breathing heavy between them.
"That doesn’t mean—"
"I hadn't realized just how close you were to the Potter boy," his father said, taking a single step forward into the light and angling himself between Draco and the door. "My Lord was most annoyed when his trap didn't work this evening. Your fault, I take it."
"How dare you-?"
"Does this have something to do with Harry?" Lupin asked, his voice low and tense, and Draco was nodding before he could stop himself, ducking his head. And he felt ashamed but no long sure of what.
"Why did you help me?" Draco clarified. "In fact, it sounded like I'm not the only one you've stopped those idiots from hurting. But I thought you didn't care."
"What are you going to do about your werewolf thing?" Harry answered, shifting and turning his head to ignore the anger in Draco's gaze.
be right. And unlike so many other times, Severus
"You should have," Harry answered, lips twitched of their own accord. Then again, they did that a lot around Draco.
"No, no, it's not better," a pause. "Because then you're left with nothing but the exhaustion."
"Draco…" he murmured, his hands uncurling from Draco’s robes.
He stepped over the edge of the tub, stepping into the warm water with his clothes still on and pulled Harry into his arms, ignoring how the water spilled over the side and splashed onto the floor. Harry relaxed against him with a sigh, leaning his head forward to rest against Draco's shoulder, his legs relaxing to wrap around Draco’s hips as he sat in his lap.
"Fine," he breathed out.
boy. Not that he was bad looking. Draco thought back to his recent obsession with Harry, and a new understanding passed over him. Was this all about an infatuation he'd failed to identify before now? Draco looked over at him from under his eyelashes. Harry was actually rather attractive, all tanned skin, messy hair, and beautiful emerald green eyes that were… looking right at Draco.
"Yeah, that wasn't an act," he sighed. "Don't get me wrong. I didn't like Umbridge, but it was really more inconvenient than anything."
"Ever so pleasant, Weasley," Draco said, eyes never leaving Harry's. "I need to speak with you." Ron opened his mouth to deliver another scathing comment.
Secrets that were obviously tearing him up inside.
Draco had no idea if his words had an effect or not, but he figured it was a start in the right direction.
Malfoy never looked at him, and every time Harry looked up to find Malfoy nodding along to something Parkinson said, his mood got lower and lower. When Ron asked him for help practicing before their team Quidditch practice, Harry jumped on the opportunity. He needed a distraction. Any distraction. Hermione looked at him sharply.
"It seemed they've found out about Draco's change."
Draco was just a few feet away, he ducked down further on the broom, putting on a burst of speed but somehow Potter was still gaining on him, growing even with Draco now.
It was nothing compared to look Draco gave him.
It wasn't strange for Harry to sleep in his room. Even if Lucius came in at some point, Severus figured he wouldn't be surprised. It wasn't until Harry slipped under the sheets next to him, his body thin and trembling that Severus realized just how long it had been since he'd had to comfort Harry.
"Look, I'll clue you in."
you here?"
"Hey!" Draco said, shifting uncomfortably. "Why did you keep your clothes?"
“Severus taught you well,” Lupin said, his eyes on Harry. "You caught on almost immediately, didn't you?"
. That Harry had been trying all week. All the aborted attempts had been Harry trying to reach out to him, and Draco had been too bull headed to notice. As frustrating as that idea was, he suddenly wanted to laugh, though he had an idea that Harry might actually slap him if he did.
"Yes," Lucius answered, and then he paused and took another drink of tea. "But he's my son." He dropped his eyes, placing the tea down on the table and looking up at Severus as if he had the answers. Lucius so wished he had the answers. "He's my son, Severus. I raised him. I watched him grow from an infant to the teenager that he is now. A month ago, I would have told anyone who asked that my son was the embodiment of perfection." Severus seemed to stoop as if he could see what was coming, but Lucius just continued on, his voice stiff and emotionless. "Now he's polluted, corrupted, inferior. Why? Because of a werewolf bite that was not his fault. A little piece of fate that he didn't deserve." Lucius snorted, finally letting Severus' gaze go so he could turn his nose up at the cruelty of it all. "I just can't accept it."
"Draco, please, I'm—" Harry's hand closed around Draco's elbow, and before Draco even realized what he was doing, he'd turned them both around, slamming Harry into the wall. Harry cut off with a pained gasp. They stared at each other, chests pressed together and eyes wide. Draco could feel
"That's what it says," she answered, looking up at him with wide brown eyes. "Umbridge. Run." There were two heartbeats of silence before everyone began screaming.
"Five years ago," Dumbledore began. "You arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole—" Draco snorted, his body trembling visibly as the sound traveled through him. "Yes, Draco's skepticism is warranted." Dumbledore sighed. "And you might as well ask why you couldn't have been sent to a wizarding family who would have treasured you and raised you as their own and the answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. When your mother died, she gave you a lingering protect, a protection that flows in your veins to this day."
," he chanted, quickly followed by a notice-me-not charm and then Harry was tapping Draco on the head, causing the feeling of raw eggs to run down his scalp and over his body, and he knew Potter had cast a disillusion spell on him.
"Oh, alright then, one drink," he answered, putting on a show of being very put out. He walked around them and headed toward a set of decanters and glasses on one side of the room. Dumbledore waved Harry to sit in the middle of the room, his seat illuminated by the firelight, and Draco felt like screaming. The old git was using Harry, trying to entice Slughorn into doing whatever it was he wanted.
His eyes had fluttered open, feeling nauseous and disgusted. But he hadn't gone. Severus would return—he always did.
"What truth?" Harry answered. "You still haven't told me."
Harry slept the rest of the morning though Draco didn't. Partly because he was afraid of what he would see in his dreams and partly because he couldn't bring himself to drag his eyes from Harry's blissfully peaceful face. He couldn't remember the last time he'd seen Harry look truly relaxed, much less
"It's your seventh year. They just might," Severus interrupted, his voice biting, and he didn't miss the way Harry's face turned away from him. The recoil.
“I’m sure,” Severus said, but he was already heading toward the Floo, pinching a generous amount of powder as he made to step away.
"Where?" Draco answered. They both ignored him as Lovegood started pacing back and forth, muttering something under her breath as she went. Harry watched her with a dark expression. His green eyes were drawn with deep shadows under them from nights of not sleeping. His clothes hung off his frame an uncomfortable amount.
"Yeah," Ron answered. "I can hear them too."
"It's not your business."
“She’s doing well,” Lucius said, his knuckles white against his walking stick.
"We're nothing like you," Weasley snapped. Harry ignored him, green eyes locked on Draco
"It was nothing," Harry answered. "She tried to talk to me when I wasn't in the mood."
"Harry!" Both their heads turned to look as red-haired Weasley waved to Harry. Then Granger was there, nudging Weasley's shoulder and pointing out Draco. The Weasel frowned, and then they were both heading over, and Draco wondered vaguely if he could get away with cursing them and running. His eyes flicked to the side as Madame Pince thinned her lips at him. Probably not.
For a while, Harry would have done anything to rid himself of the anger that pulsed through his body and made it hard to breathe. But then, it had gone. It had left him trembling and hollow. It wasn't that he wasn't capable of feeling angry; he did. He was almost always bitter and angry, but it came with the tired sweep of his bones and that hollow quivering in the pit of his stomach.
"I just—" Draco stopped himself. I just know seemed like a bad answer right now. He took a deep breath. "Right now, there's a connection between your minds but that's all this is."
"They guessed," Harry answered, his eyes flicking to Severus as if he could sense he was upset. Severus let out a breath, moving closer to pull the locket out of Harry's fingers. To his surprise Harry didn't move away from him, made no attempt to avoid touching him. It was… strange. Strange enough to send a blast of warmth through Severus' stomach when he brushed his fingers against Harry's shoulder, and Harry still didn't move away, only looked up at him with unreadable green eyes.
"And now, Harry Potter!" he said. "'The Chosen One,' they're calling you now!" Harry just looked back at him, holding his tongue and hoping Slughorn wouldn't ask him anything else. The rest of the room was staring at him, waiting for him to say something as Slughorn went on. "Of course, one doesn't know what to believe, the Prophet has been known to print inaccuracies, make mistakes—but there does seem to be little doubt given the number of witnesses, that there was quite a disturbance at the Ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all!"
to know. He looked over at Madam Pomfrey; she was busy in conversation with Hermione while tending Ron's wounds. He had time. He crept across the room, stopping just inside the infirmary door and listening for the sound of voices.
It took Severus longer to return than Draco thought it would. And when he came back it was with an annoyed scowl that almost guaranteed good news. Harry stood as soon as Severus crossed the threshold, moving in front of him and waiting expectantly.
too slow, the spell on the tip of his tongue as Draco's claws dug into his shoulder. And his fangs were an inch away from his throat as they collided with the ground, Draco holding him down and snarling. And Harry had tightened his fingers around his wand; he could use it. He
"No," he answered. "Thank you for that riveting piece of evidence, Minerva. I now know why we couldn't start this meeting without you."
"There's a lake monster?" Lovegood asked, tilting her head as if she was taking him seriously.
"I—" Harry blinked. The question had been bothering for a while. He wondered if he should even get him anything. It wasn't like they were friends or boyfriends. Besides, the fact that he had absolutely no idea what Draco would even
"Blaise was telling me that Hermione and Ron aren't happy with our relationship," Harry flushed and stumbled over the last word, but Draco decided to ignore that for now.
"Hello," he said when Blaise walked up to him. Luna and her Gryffindors had already disappeared into the crowd behind him, shuffling off toward a carriage so they could get to the feast. It wasn't as if they'd be able to sit together at the feast anyway.
"Tell me, how does death feel?"
"Get away from me, the lot of you." He snarled, and the Slytherins did, scrambling across the corridor and out of sight. Potter put his back against the wall, leaning his head back to stare at the ceiling. The pose was so similar to how Draco had just been standing, except when Potter raised his hand to brush the hair out of face, his hands were trembling violently.
"It actually does," Lucius answered. "How am I supposed to give you advice on manipulating someone when I don't know who the someone is or what the something you're trying to find out is? I don't know how you expect me to help you, Potter,” he paused. “Hypothetically, of course." Harry leaned back in his chair with a sigh, his head falling back to look up at the ceiling.
"I knew we shouldn't have trusted him!" Ron said. His face was about as red as Harry had ever seen it, his eyes narrowed and his hand clenched tight around his wand. It was about as mad as Harry had ever seen him, and he didn’t understand why the sign had caused such a reaction.
"Sit down, Harry, I think we have a long conversation ahead of us."
Draco made his way out of the forest after the fifth night. It was pitch black, hardly anything moving on the grounds and no one in the halls of the castle. It had taken him a long time to find his way out of the forest and up to his room; his body was sore and aching. He felt dirty and cold, and he wanted nothing more than to curl up in his bed and sleep. But he knew he couldn't. He had been out of commission for too long already. He pulled on clothes and then quietly slipped out of his room, flicking his wand to lock the door behind him.
"No."
"Hiding behind Gryffindors now, Malfoy?" Nott asked, his lips twisting in a vicious sneer.
"Will you
"Come with me," Draco answered, tugging against his hand until Harry was following him out of the library. Draco didn't exactly have a plan as to where he was going or even what he was doing; he was just following his gut. Not something he had a lot of experience with, but it seemed natural now to just follow it.
Severus had disappeared after the feast had ended, probably retreating to his room to do paperwork. Adarins had been quick to swoop in afterward, inviting the professors into the staff room for their own party. And Lucius didn't understand why so many had accepted. Why even McGonagall had shrugged as if she couldn't see through the man's smirk. But Adarins had just turned toward him with a triumphant smile that Lucius didn't understand, and Lucius was following him before he knew what he was doing either.
didn't know how to do that.
eyes flutter against his skin. Draco clenched his eyes closed tighter, burying his head in
, and I'm so sick of it," and Harry was so tired; he hadn't been ready to have this conversation; he hadn't even wanted to think about this conversation. "Aren't I allowed to just…"
"Harry Potter," the witch murmured, her body language relaxing, turning sultry and confident in the blink of an eye. "All alone? How foolish can you be?" his wand dipped, but he stayed firmly planted as he stared.
"Alright," Harry said, and Severus looked at him sharply.
"Why don't you like them?" he asked, and Harry's expression immediately turned guarded, turning to Draco with a raise eyebrow and unreadable eyes.
The dreams had gone on for days. Severus had been missing for days. And eventually, he'd given in. He'd gone to Dumbledore, and he'd asked for help. And Dumbledore had made empty promises that led to nothing. So, he'd gone himself, straight into the heart of the ministry and straight into Voldemort's waiting hands. Of course, the Order had eventually showed up, Sirius Black in tow as if he was some kind of hero. And they had saved the say. Saved him. Not because they cared about him or Severus, but because he was the Boy Who Lived and they couldn’t lose him so carelessly.
"You did that last night too," he told it. "You..." he trailed off, his memories piecing themselves together. He stared down at the bobcat. "You stopped me from hurting anyone," he said. "Why would you do that?" It huffed indignantly, dropping its paw to stare at him. It seemed to be looking at him expectantly, as if waiting for him to realize something it considered obvious.
And what were they rowing about? Was Dumbledore on Draco's case about keeping secrets? Then why had he shoved Harry's concerns aside as if they didn't matter? It didn't make sense.
"It's nothing, Harry," Draco said. "It's just hard to be Prefect over people who hate you." It made sense. It was probably as good an answer as any, but there was still something in the way Draco said it, in the way he immediately turned his face away that made Harry sure he was lying.
"What're you-?"
right anymore. "But that's o-o-ok because at least you'll be..." The voice stuttered off as if it couldn't say whatever it was trying to.
"Oh, Professor Umbridge needs you," he said, his eyes flicking with such triumphant glee that Draco was half convinced he had just been caught in the middle of an orgie. "They've found Montague. He's turned up jammed inside a toilet on the fourth floor."
"Nothing," Harry examined his now healed arm with a disturbing lack of interest.
“Next time the Minister should think twice about hiding dangerous artifacts from the Department of Mysteries,” Lucius said, lounging back against the cushions of his chair. Draco laughed, his hand warm where it wrapped around Harry’s. They sat on the small couch across from Lucius and Severus, the fire crackling a few feet away in Severus’ fireplace, and Draco could feel the contentment seeping through the room. “He’ll step down after this,” Lucius said. “Well, if he doesn’t want me to make a scandal out of him.”
I was scared to die. I’m still scared."
"Professor Snape, sir…." Theodore Nott trailed off, looking between the three of them with some confusion. "Sorry to interrupt, sir."
He was appalled. He tried with all his might to understand what the pureblood could be gaining from their supposed friendship, but he could come up with nothing that made sense. Especially after the one time he'd refused to respond to any of Lucius' letter and had ended up with a howler yelled at him for being rude. He wasn't about to make that mistake again, not after the beating he'd received at his father's hand.
He stopped mid sentence, blinking as he stared.
In a primal, possessive, needy sort of way that scared the living shite out of him.
Harry was inclined to think no.
like it was true," he let out a dry chuckle, bitter, hard, too old a sound.
Draco!"
"Look closer, Harry," Draco answered. "Stop trying to get around it and start trying to understand it." Harry bit his lip, turning back to the wall in front of him and taking a step closer. The wall was shifting with his eye, molding itself to what Harry was expecting to see and strengthening itself where Harry was expecting weakness.
why Draco insisted on yanking away from him when it would have been so easy to admit he cared. He finally
"I just wish I knew what that reason was." Harry murmured. Draco sighed, but he really didn't have anything else to say to that. Harry would come to terms with his father or he wouldn’t.
"Harry—"
"I thought Harry might appreciate the opportunity to see you," Dumbledore answered. "I know it's been a while." Draco swallowed, his throat bobbing as he seemed to collect himself.
"We won't…" Luna wheezed in time with him. "Be able to… much further… Fire." Blaise knew she was right; he could already see the smoke in the air, hear the roars of creatures calling from the Fiendfire, his already battered lungs protesting against both the smoke and his intense usage.
"Oh?" Malfoy answered.
. He just didn’t understand the need for it. They were happy, weren’t they? Severus was still headmaster, and yes, the Minister was still hanging over his head, but it was hardly as if
"No!" Harry yelled, reaching for his wand but he was going to be too late; he knew he would.
“Come on,” Draco said. “You never know if you don’t try it.”
"And he wears these
"We will try again," Severus said, raising his wand.
Harry was just opening his mouth to snap something uncouth at Draco when the door to their compartment slid open to reveal several nervous giggling girls who looked to be in the fourth-year. Draco immediately sighed, and Harry found himself looking from him to the girls and back again, slightly puzzled.
Harry walked down the corridor, leaving the mess of slugs behind. Before Weasley had cornered him, he’d already been doing something. Granted, it wasn’t a smart something. And frankly, he didn't know what he even was doing. Why he was doing it. Maybe he was
Then it was over. The door to Severus’ door opening with bang and Draco was scrambling away, his silver-grey eyes wide, his hair askew, and his lips swollen. He flicked his gaze to the door before turning on his heel and almost sprinting away from Harry.
"Feeling as if you're somewhere alien," Draco answered, and Harry whirled around to face him. "You're somewhere completely unfamiliar, somewhere you'll likely never be again." Draco tilted his head, studying Harry with his silver-grey eyes narrowed. "And most people can never begin to understand another person's conscious mind, just as they can't understand an alien planet."
WEASLEY WILL MAKE SURE WE WIN.
"It's just something I've picked up."
It had hurt. It had hurt more than he'd expected it to. It had also worked better than he'd expected it to, cleansing him of pain and anger and all the emotions he didn't want to feel—he had no right to feel. He'd let it heal the muggle way, feeling the pull and pain every time he moved. Severus looked at him funny the next morning, as if he suspected something but didn't seem to know what.
"Since he started caring about you," She'd answered, shrugging.
"Oh, right," Harry said, shifting his feet and feeling horribly uncomfortable.
“After his fourth year, yes, he did.”
"I hate this feeling. Why do I have to feel it at all? Why… do I…" He pressed his nails against the side of his face, wanting to claw to rip to scream to tear, but knowing he wouldn't do any of that. At least, not while Severus was there. "I hate myself."
"Oh, yeah," Harry felt himself blushing, though he had no idea why. He'd talked about this before; he shouldn't be embarrassed just because it was Malfoy of all people asking. "After the war, we just kind of fell apart. We wanted different things."
"I don't know what you're talking about," Weasley snapped. A pause and then, "She does?" Draco tried not to laugh, he really did, but he just couldn't help himself.
"She can't do that!" Weasley said.
"Really?" Draco asked, cocking an eyebrow. He looked about an inch from drawing his own wand, his face twisted up in a sneer of resentful rage. "There are signs that say, 'Draco Malfoy is a traitor?'” Ron's face turned as red as his hair, and Harry had to tighten his grip on Ron’s robes as he lunged forward again. He shoved Ron back, and Malfoy curled his lip. Harry couldn’t tell if it was supposed to be directed at Ron or him.
Really, just Ginny had caught him off guard more than he wanted to admit this year. She was a good flier, smart, pretty even with her long red hair and sharp eyes. She reminded him of Cho in a strange kind of way. It wasn't that she was anything at all like Cho, they were complete opposites, but the feeling he had when he was around her was the same. That he could love her if he tried. In his mind, he knew Ginny was everything he wanted, funny, smart, and he was physically attracted to her, but when he looked at her, all he really saw was how she wasn't Draco.
"We don't have time to come back tomorrow," Harry snapped, kicking the necklace he'd just dropped. "We don't even have time to be
He froze. The sound moving through him like a splash of ice water. How many times had he heard Vernon make that sound above him?
There was an inrush of people, most of them Gryffindor's though there were a few Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs. Draco could pick out Thomas, Longbottom, the Patil twins—his lip curled—Chang, the three other Weasley's, Lee Jordon, and an assortment of other people. Most of their eyes widened at the sight of Draco sitting not even a foot away from Harry Potter but no one really said anything.
"20 points from Gryffindor," Severus said, his lip curling. "And I expect you to show more care with your studies in the future, do you understand?"
"So, you're not on your way to visit Harry, then?" Weasley Two asked.
"Did that paper deserve that?" Draco asked, raising an eyebrow.
"Very well," Umbridge said, her voice sickly sweet. "Very well, Mr. Potter… I have offered you a chance to tell me freely. You refused. I have no alternative but to force you. Theodore—fetch Professor Snape."
, Draco." Harry whispered. Draco froze, his hand tightening painfully on Harry’s wrist for one second, two before he let go and smacked Harry on the arm. Rather hard.
"What
"I don't really care how strong his heart is," Harry answered immediately and then the door closed with a determined snap.
"Of course, I had forgotten," she answered, letting lose her annoyingly girlish giggle. He suppressed his wince. After the third time he'd heard it, he'd decided it
"Harry," Severus yanked him around, his grip on his shoulders probably too tight, but he was angry. He was angry at the boy's family for touching him, for planting the thought in his head that there was something wrong with him, something unnatural. He was angry at Cedric for asking for Harry's heart and then not being strong enough to keep from breaking it. He was angry at Voldemort for ever laying a hand on him, for placing the responsibility of the world on Harry's shoulders when he knew, he
He hated when Draco looked at him as if he was a problem. He loved how he could get a reaction out of Draco at all. He loved how Draco didn’t feel the need to coddle him. He hated how the anger was what was comfortable to him.
"I don't think you realize what you dying would do to me," Draco muttered.
"I…" Lucius hesitated. "Have you spoken to Draco?"
“Draco!” Harry’s voice was suddenly loud in his ear, making him wrench upright. The sheets were tangled around his waist, sweat covering his body. Harry was next to him, fully clothed and staring back with dark green eyes as he lay across the covers. And Draco suddenly realized that it had been a dream.
"The pompous git," Draco muttered.
"Never let one of them near you," he'd said, and he'd been so sure, so confident that there had been no arguing with him. "Never forget that they are less than us, Draco."
"Nothing was simple."
It wasn't the closed lip stiff kiss he'd shared with Draco twice before. It wasn't anything like that. Part of him longed for that kiss, for the safety of it. And another part of him, reveled and hummed and sang at how the kiss burned through him, took him apart, remade him, and made him shudder again and again.
He lit a few candles, then turned to her. “What is the message?”
Malfoy turned his head, arched his eyebrow again. He looked so fucking gorgeous when he did that. “Pregnancy doesn’t make one an invalid, you know.”
Draco sighed. “Do I need to spell it out for you?”
“What must I do to have you, Harry? Tell me!”
The servant curtsied. “Yes, My Lady.”
Draco pulled back. “You don’t want me? Is that it?” Even as if he said it Draco knew Potter wanted him. He just wanted to hear the words from Potter.
“That’s not why I did it!”
Potter bit his lip; his cheeks had gone pink. “Um. She had some influence over my decision.”
“I was thinking more about your healing ribs.”
Gibb smiled apologetically at them. Then he put his neck through the window. “I say it’s the duke! He’s here to visit you!”
“I mean it, Goyle.
to recover. It’s all right if you take a few days off.”
The Duke of Malfoy was fucking him like a locomotive, and Harry
“You’ve no idea,” Malfoy said, smirking a little.
, Potter?”
“I’m not going to let you die,” Harry said fiercely. He was determined to help Malfoy in any way he could.
Malfoy flinched; he looked down at the table. When he looked back up, his gaze had hardened. “I suppose you have a right to know, especially after playing my own personal hero.”
Harry’s eyes fluttered. He had a hard time processing Malfoy’s words. “What?”
When it was all over, they lay sated with Draco resting on Harry’s chest and Harry’s arms cradling him.
“It’s not right,” he blurted out.
“Well, it won’t do to explain in mixed company, but I have half a mind to declare myself a suffragist, too!”
“Which one?”
they let you into Oxford. He proves my point at last!”
An old servant met them at the door. She curtsied. “Your Grace,” she said.
“You assume I’m unable to …
When they reached his room, he found his bag had already been brought up. He hesitated on the threshold, almost unwilling to step into the space.
Finally Potter returned with the crushed herbs and a glass of water. He mixed the mugwort, chasteberries, and the chamomile together. Then he raised the glass to Mrs Gibbs’ lips and helped her drink the concoction. He was so gentle with her and it touched something deep in Draco.
Draco sighed and took another sip of wine. “I was so jealous of you in second year when everyone thought you were the Heir of Slytherin.”
Harry felt his cheeks heat. “I’m sure I don’t understand what you mean.”
Harry glowered at the coins. “I don’t want your money.”
Not looking at Harry, Malfoy lay back on the bed, stretching himself long and straight. He stared at the ceiling and didn’t move.
“No,” Harry said roughly. He cleared his throat. “You’re right. You are healing.”
Harry caught his breath. Hot, desperate yearning flowed through him, and he nearly whimpered when Malfoy released his hand and stepped away.
“Of course, Your Grace.” Goyle pulled out an old map from his pocket. (The man was always prepared.) “Like I said, he’d be in one of the rookeries: Jacob’s Island, St Giles, or Saffron Hill. Just to name a few.”
They were back at Hogwarts, back at Harry’s true home, and Draco didn’t know where he was going. He circled the castle, ignoring the urge to take his chances and stagger into the Forbidden Forest. He wanted those looming trees to swallow him up.
“Keep going!” called Granger. She sounded as if she headed an army. And Harry supposed she did; she headed an army of bluestockings.
Granger studied his face. “I won’t pretend to know your heart, but you still stand here, don’t you?”
The day was sunny again. Of course it was sunny. Nothing mattered anymore, not even the weather. The sun could swoop down and gobble up the whole world, and Draco wouldn’t even blink.
“We were all so worried about you,” Granger said. “Please know that you can always come to us if you need help, any help at all.”
Draco snorted; he was still in disbelief that Potter had shagged a bloke named
“Don’t apologise. You’ve had a long day.”
it. He utterly loved it.
“Okay.” Draco released him and stepped back. “Are we going right now?”
“No … the upkeep is too … well. I’m sure you can sympathise.”
They headed straight for the stables, but Draco was stopped when someone tugged on his coat. He looked around, then down. It was a child.
“God.”
The day passed at a snail’s pace. Harry was exhausted, more than a little muddled. He was too worried about Malfoy to sleep.
“I suppose I will have to,” Granger answered dryly.
“Tell me you don’t want to be with me and I will let you go.”
Cackling to himself, he waited for the perfect moment.
Draco laughed because it wasn’t true. “At least I’ve got a window. I’m not forced to stare at grimy old walls.”
“This is a used hole,” Harry said, thrusting slowly.
Draco’s eyebrows came together in concern. “Tell me what you need. A doctor?”
“Everyone thinks that,” Draco said, voice trembling. He buried his face in Harry’s neck, letting himself feel protected, comforted.
It was overwhelming, to say the least. Harry found he couldn’t breathe when he remembered. He fought back the tears that stung his eyes.
“Goyle, pay her,” Draco said calmly. “She is right. We did have a deal.”
Harry’s eyes flashed. He Vanished the towel with a frustrated wave of his wand. “I’m sorry, okay? But you can be a little less dramatic about it.”
will regret it.”
“Thanks for the -”
“Yes, Your Grace. The ball is … brilliant. I’ve never seen so much opulence, so much beauty.”
Potter laughed, this time with mirth. “You had men when you were barely eighteen?”
“She was a brave woman.”
They cut the kidneys in half and removed the tubes and skins. They thawed a packet of Muggle puff pastry, but only after Malfoy made a show of poking at it in its frozen state. “
After his shower, he wrapped a towel around his waist and ventured to another room. The room was dark, muted, with a lovely sage and lavender scent in the air.
take his word more seriously. Harry just had to find the courage to approach a gentleman who was far, far above his class.
“Brilliant,” Harry said wryly.
“God,” Harry said again. He had lost all control. He didn’t know where they were; he barely knew the man before him was nobility. All he knew was he needed more of that hot, wet mouth, more of that tongue that dragged along the underside, teasing him.
,” he said again. He pulled out a ring and dropped to one knee. “I want you to marry me.”
“It hasn’t been even a week since you fell ill!” Ginny said, entirely too encouraged. “Your body needs
“Of course, Your Grace,” Potter said, “but we are discussing herbs that are available to Mrs Gibbs.”
“Let’s talk about something else,” said the duke stiffly.
Together they watched Potter wank him slowly. Draco was thick and red and desperate. He whined needily.
Harry dragged his thumb over Malfoy’s nose, feeling for any tender spots. “Were you hit on the nose?”
There was a good chance he would lose his place at Oxford because of this. He began to tremble.
“Please come back with me.”
. Harry flushed all over.
“Why? She would be a good match.”
Harry’s heart sank. He hadn’t money for bail; he could barely afford food, let alone money to get him out of gaol.
“That’s economics.”
“Permission?” Harry blinked. The duke could do whatever he damn well pleased. They both knew he didn’t need Harry’s permission.
“But … you came to me last night.”
in public.
“No, I suppose not, but I do know that you are friendly with my sister Ginny.”
“The herbs in the castle are available to her. We would just need to fetch them.”
“Barely eighteen.”
“You won’t.” Draco caressed his cheek some more. “I’m not a viscount’s son. I’m the Duke of Malfoy. Let your cousin try to extort me.”
“Nothing!” Harry yelled. And this was why he avoided Draco when he was in these moods.
Malfoy’s fond expression dropped. He looked sad. “Yes.”
“It’s not funny, Your Grace.”
Weasley’s head shot up. “No, no! That’s not what’s happening at all. What I’m trying to do is ask you to come to Greece with me. Help me with my research.”
“Yes, quite.” Weasley stood up and came around his large, cluttered desk. “I had a wonderful time with you at the opera by the way.”
“Name and date of birth,” the clerk said in a dull voice.
“You want to return to your room? It’s waiting for you.”
“Good morning,” she said brightly.
But, of course, the duke could do whatever he pleased. Especially in his own home—a
Biting his lip, Draco wrapped his hand around Potter’s shaft. Potter was warm and silky. Draco tried and failed to muffle a soft whimper.
“Yes, Malfoy. I’m paying.”
“Oh, yes! I come from the Wayfair stock. Good people. We’ve been working for the Duke of Malfoy since the beginning of the eighteenth century. That’s not our century but the one before us.”
Inside, the conservatory was a wild jungle. The air was humid, thick; it gave Harry’s skin a sensual caress.
“That depends: How do you feel?”
“Can you see the future?”
“Yes.”
Harry pulled at his hair, utterly overwhelmed. He couldn’t panic. “Then tell me what you want me to do.”
Harry felt chilled to the bone, his coat too threadbare to be much help. He treaded steadily with his books and belongings strapped to his back.
For a moment, Harry’s green eyes were glazed over with drowsiness, then his expression cleared. He didn’t smile.
Potter shook hands with the other men. “It was good to meet both of you.”
Draco grinned widely.
Harry gulped and fiddled with his gold-lined serviette. “There was pain in their voices … and there was also hope. Perhaps they were singing about a loaf of bread, but I got the sense the songs were about deeper stuff … like falling in love.”
“Oh.” Draco’s stomach squeezed painfully. When Potter looked at him curiously, all Draco could say was “Oh” again.
“Then you must make him interested! Of course men like him don’t start out invested. Believe me, I grew up with his sort. I know them. But not all of them are lost causes, and I believe we can win him over.”
He thought about Malfoy. He yearned for him.
“This is real, Draco. Your husband is dead but he still cares about you. He is worried about your safety.”
Draco curled up against Potter’s side and Potter buried his hand in his hair.
“No.”
“I will do it,” Miss Brown said happily.
“I want to be discreet.”
Draco growled in his throat. He grabbed Potter’s hands, trying to calm him. “Perhaps it has escaped your attention, but I too am a homosexual.”
“No,” Draco said, and retrieved the velvet-bound Keats book. “I want you to have it.”
“Sod Salazar; are you sure you’re not the mad one?”
It had been a while since Harry’d kissed anyone, but he tried to reciprocate as best as he could. The truth was Draco was a brilliant kisser. He commanded Harry’s mouth, overwhelming his senses. All Harry could do was clutch at him.
Professor Trelawney stood in his doorway. “Hello, dear,” she said. “May I come in?”
Draco had nodded, his gaze very tender.
In his mind’s eye, he saw all the account sheets for his land. He flipped through them quickly, trying to remember where exactly the dukedom lacked funds. “I would need shipments of barley, ma’am. And whiskey. Barrels of it. I would need cash on hand for emergencies.”
“Then I will.”
“All right,” Malfoy said, his hands now moving up his back, over his shoulders. The touch was very soothing. Harry let out a little sigh.
, Draco told himself. He was letting his mind wander when a damn murderer was following him.
“What?”
“Our kind?”
They left the fields and headed for Gibbs’ house, Draco and Potter on horseback, Gibbs on foot. When they made it to the house, Draco tried to see it from Potter’s perspective, and knew the structure came up short. It looked more like a shed than a home.
Smiling, Longbottom pulled up a stool. “Please call me Neville.”
,” Draco said under his breath as he took his spot at the head of the table.
“What?” Draco snapped.
“In more ways than one,” Draco purred.
Potter dropped his hands. “You’re having a laugh, aren’t you?”
Harry raised his head and they made eye contact. He could tell they were thinking the same thing: how in the world had they come to be in this position? Were they not still rivals?
“Yes.”
“I do,” Draco said, voice nearly a growl.
They continued to work on the garden - weeding the flowers, pruning their stems. Another spell revealed ivy choking the garden walls so they spent a few days cutting through the thick vegetation.
“Take it nice and slow,” Draco said, voice more of an order than mere encouragement. They followed a muddy path.
“Sort of.”
The duke turned to face the balcony and pressed his back against Harry. Looking around tentatively, he pulled out a handkerchief from his pocket and began to clean up his face.
Draco marched back into the house and laughter greeted him. It looked like Potter and Mrs Gibbs were having a delightful conversation.
Harry was dead.
Staring into Malfoy’s eyes, he sank down on his cock, inch by slow inch. He watched as the pleasure made Malfoy’s eyes glaze over and his mouth drop open.
“I love you,” Harry said, tears stinging his eyes. He wrapped his hand around his cock, stroking himself desperately. “Fuck, I’m so in love with you.” He spilled over his working hand, dripping on Malfoy’s stomach.
She stretched herself against the dirty wall, showing off her curves. When he didn’t react, she dropped the pose and glowered at him. “You must be here for that bloke. The sickly one.”
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “So?”
“Do it,” Harry cried.
When it was all over, Draco lay shivering in his own mess. His heartbeat thundered in his ears. He felt good, so good.
It was the first time Draco’d had sex since Azkaban.
“Yes, it is.” Draco came around his fortress. He looked at Potter closely, and was pleased to find him looking rested. “Have you been here long?”
Potter put his hands on his chest, and tried to push him away. Draco only rocked back a little. “You don’t
Harry had thought they had months to plan for the birth. He had gathered all the relative spell books on a table … but he hadn’t read through them. He dropped down in a chair and sternly told himself not to panic.
Potter groaned and let Draco’s tongue dominate. Draco licked and sucked, tasting every inch of his mouth. Draco moaned greedily. Then their tongues brushed hotly together, and Draco’s cock jerked in his trousers.
Harry was so wet for him, precome bubbling from his slit. Malfoy licked it up eagerly.
The next morning, Harry woke up to Draco vomiting.
“I don’t know what to say.”
“What a stupid question.”
since you entertained on that scale.”
Potter hesitated. “But my work ….”
Draco opened his mouth. Potter’s gaze was greedy on his face, eating up every reaction.
Malfoy met his eyes. “Do you mind?”
“My wedding? I’m not even seeing anyone.”
“The clothes he has on now need to be disposed of.”
Harry smirked, not raising his head to look at Malfoy. “Which part?”
A small group of suffragists had been invited to Lady Parkinson’s townhouse in Oxford for tea. At the door the footman looked at him disapprovingly but directed him to where the ladies were already seated around a table with steaming cups of Earl Grey.
“Fine.” Harry waved his wand and the yellow glow disappeared from the room. He could still see Malfoy but he didn’t tell Malfoy this.
Draco shook his head. “No, I want to go inside this time.”
“What in the blazes do you mean?”
“Salazar Slytherin wasn’t evil.”
“I won’t let you do it!”
“What is the matter?” Draco said softly.
When Harry woke up, he lay in Malfoy’s arms. Malfoy idly played with his hair, curling his finger around his locks.
“I never meant to intrude upon your time. I shall go.” Draco stood but Potter grabbed his wrist.
“Please, Harry.” Malfoy remained kneeling.
“Draco,” he whispered. It sounded like a prayer.
Potter frowned, his gaze full of hurt. “I don’t think they’re ugly.”
“You don’t believe me! I can tell by your tone.”
“You like it?”
Hand trembling a little, Malfoy reached out. His fingers looked pale, almost delicate, when they wrapped around his stiffy.
Draco was tied up in the chair, starkers, a gag just barely out of his mouth. It was enough to let him talk. “
Draco nodded needily.
Potter bit his lip. Draco was almost distracted by it. He snapped his gaze to the wall just behind Potter’s shoulder.
Potter touched his forehead. “I am feeling a bit feverish.”
“Sure.” Malfoy tipped his head back and closed his eyes.
He checked his watch, and saw it was close to midnight. Soon, it would be the next year, and that meant he kept his promise to the duke to stay through New Year’s Eve.
“Fine. You have my consent.”
Draco had too much on his plate. He always had too much on his plate, but now it made a difference.
“Professor Weasley is an honourable man. He appreciates me for my mind.”
“It was.” Malfoy’s smile dimmed.
Harry gulped.
Potter couldn’t stop staring at Draco, it was ridiculous. Draco sneered whenever he felt Potter’s gaze on him. He sneered and made sure to throw his shoulders back, keeping his chin high. He hadn’t a clue what Potter wanted with him but he refused to cower.
Harry frowned. “Why?”
“Yes, Your Grace.”
Draco stumbled forward. He wanted to throw himself into Harry’s arms, but something told him not to get too close. “I’ve missed you,” he gasped.
“What do you
Malfoy stepped even closer. He raised his hands to kiss his ink stained knuckles. “I’m in love with you, Harry Potter. Please marry me.”
“I want two pounds a month,” Dudley said, a hungry gleam in his eyes. “We will have to hire help in your absence.”
“God,” Harry whispered, unable to contain the whimper that bubbled up. He thrust, watching his red cock move between those fingers, pushing back his foreskin.
“I escaped unharmed, ma’am,” Draco said dryly.
“I haven’t - I never -”
Pointing his wand at Draco, he said in a strong voice, “
“Back to Oxford.”
The man snorted. “They seem to be letting in just anyone, don’t they?”
. I need those payments!”
Potter bit his lush bottom lip. “Maybe a tad.” He ruffled the hair on the back of his head. “Look, I promised Granger I’d have one last go at getting you to join the dark side, since we are evil and all that.”
Draco blinked. “I never thought of it that way,” he said softly.
“I won’t give up.” Potter stood. “I promise you I won’t give up.”
“Are you impressed?” Malfoy asked.
“For what?”
“Um, um,” Ginger Hagrid said.
“Well, Mr Potter,” he said, “you’ll know more tomorrow.”
“Not anymore,” Harry said, caressing Draco’s hand with his thumb.
“Let’s get some dinner in you.” Draco stood and took Harry’s hand. He guided Harry back into the bedroom and helped him sit down on the settee.
Draco saw there was no fire in the hearth, despite the cold day. “Good day, Mrs Gibbs. Would you care for some wood to heat your home?”
“I can’t afford it either,” Potter said, grinning. He pulled up a chair beside the bed. “Hello, Mrs Gibbs. I’m Harry Potter.”
, Draco wanted to say, but that wasn’t entirely true. “It is the dukedom’s. I am merely its proprietor, its caretaker.”
Potter was looking at him fondly. It was more than a little unnerving.
, Draco wanted to demand, but he had already asked and it had made Potter uncomfortable. He wanted to find this man as well. He wanted to put his fist through his mouth.
After work, Draco stopped on his way home to pick up Indian takeaway. Harry had always preferred Thai takeaway so devouring a box of Chicken Korma really helped Draco when he was looking to distract himself.
“No lights,” Draco insisted. “I don’t want you to see me fat.”
Members of Parliament were officially back from the holidays, which meant they were officially open to public visitors. The suffragists planned to bombard every PM in his office. The intent was to catch him unaware, make him squirm. It was the final countdown to the election, and the conservatives were pulling ahead in polls.
“Someone remind the group why we are here,” Granger said, standing like a sergeant in front of them. She rested her hands on her hips.
Draco rolled his hips. “You’re hard. You want me.”
He continued to go to class; he continued his tutoring. And four days a week, he spent the afternoon in Professor Weasley’s office, tending to his correspondence, organising his research.
“I don’t need your flattery, Your Grace,” Goyle said roughly.
“No, dear. I cannot leave before I tell you his message.”
“I will comb his library for resources,” Harry said. “If I could point to intellectual men who support the vote for women, then perhaps I could help him see that it isn’t just a group of disgruntled women who couldn’t find husbands who are pushing for female voting rights.”
“Of course.”
“This is wonderful,” he said, taking a larger bite.
Malfoy’s eyes were unnaturally bright, and a muscle ticked in his jaw. The director quickly fell back behind his desk, as if the furniture could somehow protect him from the duke’s wrath.
“Very good, Miss Brown,” Granger said. “And we accomplish this by petitioning the men of Parliament. Tracking them down,
The game made Malfoy laugh, and Harry would pretty much do anything to make Malfoy laugh.
They glared at one another for a long moment, then both turned away to stare out the window. Harry knew he was being ridiculous; he knew he should be happy, but the overt display of the duke’s power had made him very uneasy, even if it had been for his benefit. Harry thought about all those poor boys and men locked up, how they hadn’t been lucky enough to attract a duke to help them. There was so much inequality in the world, and it made Harry grind his teeth.
Harry shook his head. “I just know.”
Potter yanked his hands away. “It’s not for me!”
This made Potter laugh. “I do want something, but it would definitely dampen the mood.”
Harry laughed. “No, it’s not. This coat was still able to make it here. So have food and drink. We are not starving, are we not?”
“Yes and no,” the duke said calmly, his expression unreadable.
After breakfast, Harry escaped outside to the snow-licked garden grounds. The day was cold, smoke escaping his mouth with each breath. He wore his new emerald coat. It was a ridiculous, undeserved present from the duke, but Harry wasn’t stupid nor stubborn enough to reject it.
Draco forced himself not to react to the man’s proximity. “I demand to know why you are in my library.”
Harry had to drop his head. He was afraid others would see the desire in his expression. Luckily, he was saved by the arrival of the second course—a roasted duck on a bed of cherries.
They took their breakfast and made their way outdoors to the garden. The London sun was shining, and the magical vegetation was lush and colourful.
Harry laughed. “I daresay you’re the only man who believes that.”
Keats was a romantic fellow, everyone knew that, but hearing the duke recite his work gave it more power. Harry was transfixed. He felt like he was underwater, his body riding the throb of waves. He was underwater, and his lifesaver was the duke.
“The chicken—it melts like butter on the tongue. I’ve never tasted anything like it. You know, being poor and all.”
“So delicious, so perfect,” Malfoy growled, then his mouth was on Harry again, his tongue licking and licking. He was getting Harry so, so wet. Malfoy laughed darkly. “I bet you never thought the Duke of Malfoy ate arse.”
Draco and Lady Greengrass were ascending the interior stairs when Draco stumbled and nearly fell.
“You -?”
“Help him back to bed,” Draco ordered. “He needs a scalding cup of tea, some whiskey. Don’t forget to feed him. Start with a bowl of broth.”
“I don’t care if you’re pregnant. In fact, I’m - I’m -” Harry didn’t know what he meant to say. Excited? Invested? The truth was he would be devastated if he wasn’t a part of the baby’s life.
“You’re washing me.”
Draco was smiling widely. He couldn’t help it. “Do you really care about women getting the vote?”
It was a Tuesday night, and Draco had just returned home from his shift at the canteen. As Draco was stepping into the atrium Floo, someone had yelled, “Never come back, you dirty Death Eater!”
"Lucius, would you mind," Severus shifted again, and this time he noticed the blush that flashed across Severus' face before he swallowed and looked away.
Draco was in the room within seconds. He didn't blink at their skewed appearance, which immediately put Lucius on his guard. Draco himself looked ill, cheeks flushed, eyes dark. He had the same look on his face as he did when he broke something of immense value to either Lucius or Narcissa.
"Heard what?"
"Severus?" A new voice caught Draco's attention. He swiveled his head around, focusing on the long blonde hair and silver-grey eyes that matched his own in color and intensity. "Has he…?" His father trailed off when his eyes landed on Draco. His lips tightened, and Draco knew his father was the closest he ever came to tears.
"Yeah, apparently, she was trying to be stealthy, but it didn't really work out for her, did it?" Blaise smirked, his eyes flicking over Draco's face as if he could read his mind. Draco shook himself and kept walking. "They even managed to get McGonagall in the crossfire."
Thank you for your wonderful comments! They truly make my day when I read them.
"And you can't keep babying him," Severus snapped back. "Potter must learn to control his mind."
He ran his tongue along the underside of Severus’ cock, watching the way Severus bit his lip, his stomach muscles tightening. Somehow, it had never felt demeaning when he’d done this for Severus. He pressed his tongue against the underside of the head, wrapping his mouth and sucking gently. He listened as Severus groaned over him. It had only ever felt reverent.
"I want you," Harry whispered. "Please… I want you inside me."
Still, he found himself stuck. Yearning for something unidentifiable and insatiable. He would snare women and invite them into his bed, laying sprawled out with his hands relaxed beside him and refusing to move while they writhed over him. This was for his pleasure, not theirs.
"Potter," Blaise turned to Harry, whose eyes flicked over and then away.
Draco flexed his arms, wishing he could hold Harry and was surprised when the roped came undone. Luna winked at him, twirling her wand. He sighed into Harry's hair, drawing him close as he eyed Lupin's unconscious body.
"Ask Harry," Twin Weasley 1 said.
Draco threw his mind away from his body, dancing after Severus and into Harry's mind. He sighed at the complete lack of defenses around Harry's mind. It was a wonder the Dark Lord hadn't
“You want to what?” Lucius answered, and he was trying to sound calm. He truly was, but when his son came to him talking about werewolf problems and asking to talk to enemies that had tried to kill them, it was harder than he cared to admit.
"Why do you want to know so badly, Malfoy?" Potter asked, pulling away from the wall abruptly. "You want to laugh at The famous Boy Who Lived? Know all my dark little secrets, so you can sell them to the newspapers?"
He turned his head away, studying the glass window. He thought of the other boy who had sat in that chair. Of the face he'd made when he'd seen Draco walk into the room. It had reminded Lucius painfully of that first morning after the full moon. Potter had looked so vulnerable, so open. The look had slowly melted away as the days passed, particularly after Lucius had found him in a pile of his own blood. But the moment Potter had seen Draco, it had been back in full force. Lucius wondered if Draco even knew of the effect he had over the boy. If not, he truly couldn't blame Potter for running. Nothing was more dangerous than someone having power over you, especially when that person didn't know they had it.
"Do you remember when we were young, and we actually believed in everything the Dark Lord preached?" Severus murmured after a moment.
Draco couldn't stop himself from turning away from Lupin on that. Sure, they'd been smooth. Except when he wasn't thinking clearly and tried to kiss Harry, and then again when he’d almost attacked Harry, Severus, and his father, because he was about to change. But other than that, peachy.
"Draco," Harry answered, his voice soft. So soft. Severus hadn't heard him speak like that since before he'd found out about Lupin's betrayal, Sirius Black's true identity. He sounded scared; Severus never thought he would ever get the chance to hear Harry sound scared again. "Draco tried to kiss me." It made him blaze with anger and relief, and Severus had no idea which would win or even which
"Are you going to let me go?" Harry asked finally. Draco raised an eyebrow and let his arm drop from around Harry. Before Harry could take off though, he grabbed his hand, lacing their fingers together. Harry immediately tensed, his startled green eyes locking on Draco's with a dark look.

Draco's entire body shifted as soon as they walked through the doors. Tense and relieved at the same time. It only took a second to realize what he was looking at. Harry was already sitting at the Gryffindor table, his robes crumpled around his shoulders, a single leaf in his hair. He looked over as soon as the doors banged open, his glasses reflected back the candlelight, and Draco looked away just as quick.
Though Draco was fairly certain that Harry had never cared about being late before.

When he emerged from his room—feeling clean and refreshed after his clothes had undergone a powerful
"I am," Harry answered, though the words were hollow, and Draco knew he was tired too. They all were. They had been at this for months with no results. If anything, it almost seemed the lessons was just making Harry's mind more open.
And Lucius didn't know that he agreed with that. He raised his hand to pinch the bridge of his nose. He could do it; he could force Harry to come back to Hogwarts with him; the boy was weak enough, tired enough. But that didn't mean he wouldn't do the same stupid thing again.
His words seemed to catch Draco’s attention, because he looked away from the wreckage around them, locking his eyes on Harry with a dark kind of silver-grey annoyance that he hadn’t used since before Voldemort had died. Sure, they had argued through the summer, but there had been a strange kind of understanding between them. A need for everything to be alright. Or to at least pretend that it was.
"Draco!" Harry protested, leaning around Draco's shoulder and frowning as if he didn't understand what all the fuss was about.
"Really?" Draco raised an eyebrow, unperturbed. "Then what were yours?"
. Malfoys
"Your progress this year is atrocious." Professor Snape said, and he blinked. "Due to this, I will be accompanying you home this summer and giving you extra lessons." Professor Snape narrowed his eyes as his whole face lit up. "Make no mistake, this will be a hard summer for you, Potter." He nodded vigorously, though he didn't really mean it. Professor Snape didn't have a clue what his summers were really like. "Good, I'll send the letters to your… family," Professor Snape's lip curled over the word and he thought maybe, just maybe he was worth more than just a name to someone after all.
He didn't exactly know where he was going. It was early in the morning, early enough that Lucius wouldn't be awake, and neither would Draco. He had absolutely no desire to find the Grey Lady, but he also didn't want to stay in Severus' rooms any longer; he wanted to do
"I'd ask why?" Harry raised an eyebrow.
"But—"
“What am I supposed to do?” he asked.
The old fool, thinking he could use Lucius Malfoy like he was a piece of trash. Lucius wandered down several lights of stairs, finding himself in the dungeon before he really knew where he was going. He knew he should check on Draco, but he also knew the chances of his son wanting to talk to him were pretty slim. Malfoy's didn't forgive and forget so soon after they'd felt like they'd been slighted.
"Hey, that's my—" Weasley started.
, but he was hardly going to correct Harry.
"Oh, he most certainly did," Draco answered, narrowing his eyes at the half-giant in front of them.
"Yes, of course, Mother," Draco answered, bowing slightly to his mother. She nodded before turning back to the mess of clothes and papers strewn in front of her. Draco stepped away, he knew better than to interrupt after she had dismissed him like that. He stepped out of his mother's study and headed down the hall toward his room, hoping he made it before-
"Please don't insult my friends," Harry said quietly, and Draco pursed his lips, turning his face away. "Hermione, Ron, could you give us a minute?"
Draco makes a mistake.
"I'm fine," he answered, standing up straight and looking around. They were in the middle of nowhere, standing in front of a giant mansion with large snakes decorating either side of the ornate gate in front of them. And suddenly, Harry had a very bad feeling about where Dumbledore had brought him. "Where are we, Professor?"
And Draco had never considered that Harry hadn't thought it had been Draco that did something wrong but himself. Though he supposed the idea made more sense than he gave it credit for.
Flicking his eyes once at Ron, who looked as if he'd be busy for quite a while before looking around the room for Hermione again. Just as the portrait hole was opening, he managed to catch sight of bushy brown hair on the edge of his vision. He darted after Hermione, pushing open the portrait and stepping into the corridor. He was rather done with the celebration anyway.
“That could work…” Woods said, the swoosh of her robes sounding against the stone floor. “But you need to be sure Mr. Potter. I’m going to have to ask you questions you might not want to answer.”
But there was the undeniable truth of the matter that Harry was right. As much as Lucius didn’t want him to be.
"Yeah."
And they crashed through the opening of the cell, Harry panting and shivering as Bellatrix turned toward them with a sneer. He didn't have time though. There were Dementors everywhere and they needed to leave, and he
And no, it hadn't escaped his notice that Blaise had been missing too.
“As I’m sure you’re aware, Potter is in my care,” Severus answered, and he tried to keep the snap out of his voice, especially when the Minister turned back toward him with knowing eyes, cold and triumphant.
"What does that have to do with Draco?"
"What?" Harry blinked once, pulling his arm and then blinking again when Draco wouldn't let it go.
scare him. "I simply came to check on Severus."
before, but he'd never felt it while being terrified. While knowing he was just a wand tip away from dying, and that there was nothing he could do about it, and actually
Then Weasley was coming over and talking about Butterbeer, so they were finding Granger and buying their sweets before stepping out into the cold again. It was a shock after being in the warmth for so long, but when Harry reached down and laced their fingers together, Draco couldn't find it in himself to care. They found a table at the Three Broomsticks easily, and Weasley and Hermione left the table to go order the Butterbeers.
Severus moved faster than he’d been expecting him to, lunging at Lucius in a way that had the chair toppling over with a bang, their legs wrapped together, Lucius shirt slipping down his shoulder, and then Severus settling on top of him with a muffled gasp. And Lucius groaned as Severus lined their hips together, his cock still out.
“So, um, I like blokes.”
This will help the hangover.
“There’s a giant gash on the back of your thigh,” said Bill.
"The funny one stayed for breakfast, his name was Bryan and managed to hold a conversation with these two and George. I put the hot dumb one out as soon as I was conscious," Harry says with a look of disgust. "Unless he had volunteered to blow me during breakfast to keep his mouth occupied, he needed to be gone before he started talking again."
Hermione, "How did you figure that out so fast?"
Harry looked at Ginny and smiled, “What do you want to happen now, Gin?” he asked.
In his sixth year, when Dumbledore began showing Harry what would be necessary to defeat Voldemort, Harry thought that being an Auror would help his task.
There are too many sensations for Harry to focus on, George’s lips and tongue on and in his mouth, Fred sucking on his neck, four hands moving continuously over his torso, not knowing who’s hands even belong to who. Harry finally stops trying to follow his mind and just relaxes into the moment and does what he feels.
“I’d like to speak with Draco for a moment next, but after would you be willing to accompany me to tell her about her daughter- and son-in-law.” said Harry.
Harry had hoped that was the case. “I think that given your loyalty and your honour, you’re the perfect person to protect this house and my family within it.”
“But,”
"It wasn't really about hiding from you, Ron. I promise that.  I knew you'd be okay, and support me."
He takes a sip and sighs. "Perfect as always, Granger."
“You said ‘different’, so I’m guessing you’ve already had sex with a man?” Before Harry can answer Ginny’s face pales and she blurts out, “Oh shite, you spent the last year with Hermione and Ron.  Please tell me it wasn’t my brother Harry.”
“No, just get things settled here. Ask Pipsy if Snape had any Dreamless sleep made and share it with everyone. I don’t think anyone’s going to sleep otherwise.”
“We’re blokes. We’re trustworthy. We can help you figure it out.”
“Fuck that’s hot,” Fred says.  He slides out from behind Harry, supporting his weight and lying Harry back onto the rug. Fred stands and removes the rest of his clothes then gets back down on the floor next to his brother. “Switch and strip,” he says. The moment George pulls his mouth of Harry’s cock, Fred takes his place. George strips quickly and watches Fred taking Harry’s length in and out of his mouth for a moment. “Still good, Harry?”
Harry took a deep breath then opened his eyes to see Winky still looking at him with a glint of hope in her eyes that seemed to say that she was hoping against hope that Harry would ask her to help him with Teddy. He blew out the breath then told Winky, “I will need you, Winky. Thank you for offering to help.”
"Make me feel good, Charlie.  Make me forget that I'm Harry Potter, even if it's just for a few hours."
Gin sat silently for a moment then turned her body to face Harry’s. “Complete honesty?”
Hermione looks over at the pair with amusement. "Well, Draco, I'm pleased you finally decided to grace us with your presence at Sunday breakfast, instead running off to hide."
"Harry didn't pull him that night, Draco did." Ron still looks confused. "The man left the party with Draco and yet was with Harry the next morning. Logic says all three were here at some point. Otherwise, a random stranger had the luck of bedding number one and number two on Witch Weekly's Hottest Bachelor's List on the same night? Not likely.
"Malfoy, care for a game of chess? I really don't want to hear this."
“I’m glad to hear it, though I’d still have been thankful either way. This may sound like a strange question given the circumstances, but today I keep learning how many layers there can be to those who served him. I know your family kicked out Andromeda, but do you have any type of relationship with her?”
At dinner, they continued answering questions from the Weasleys. Arthur picked up on asking about the Elder wand again. Then Percy asked what the trio planned to do next. Charlie asked if Harry really died. Then the cycle started over with Ginny.
“Being behind your Fidelus is the safest place for him, and I know you would never keep him from his family,” said Andi.
Charlie stayed on his side but reached out and turned me on my back. One arm around my back, the other pulled my legs up over his and pulled me into his arms. He pushed my hair back from my head and tilted my head to his face to make eye contact.
He leans forward on his knees, pushing towards George, pushing into his kiss, and reaches out for the hem of his shirt. Harry pulls George’s shirt over his head, breaking the kiss, and before George can reconnect the kiss, Harry leans forward and licks a stripe from the base of his throat to his chin pulling a moan from George’s mouth. “Fred I think Harry wants to play.”
Ron smiled around a bite of food, “Thank Merlin she is brilliant. We’d all be dead ten times over if she wasn’t. And Harry thought he should run off alone to protect us.” Ron laughed.
Gin’s head pops up to look at Harry, and Harry realizes he said this out loud.
Harry sighs, "The ginger waiter and the valet."
“Master Severus taught me many things that House Elves are not usually taught,” Pipsy said with a look on her face that Harry thought might be pride. He tried imagining the bitter, angry man trying to teach this diminutive creature and found that he couldn’t see it.
“Do you need me here while you teach Hermione? I’d like to bring Snape’s body from the Shrieking Shack to the Great Hall.” Harry wanted Snape laid out respectfully with the rest of their dead.
“Um. Winky, I am not having a baby,” Harry said.
"Seriously? That's possible?"
“Always the tone of surprise,” said Ron as he pulled a face at Harry.
Charlie just blinked at me, then nodded. “Can I ask?”
“You know we’re loyal to you, nothing you ever say to us leaves this room.”
“Shacklebolt will treat you with respect at the very least.”
“Voldemort is dead,” said Narcissa.
Harry nodded, then rose and Disapparated with Teddy.
Harry sighed, “Then you’re welcome to come to my home with me.”
When Charlie finally came, it was in the same controlled way that he’d done everything else. His hips stilled from their thrusts, he seated himself fully inside me and rocked us together in time. He wrapped both arms tightly against my torso, one across my chest the other across my stomach. The only sign of aggression was his mouth, where he bit down onto my shoulder. He continued rocking us until his orgasm was complete, then he slowly took his mouth off my shoulder and loosened his arms. I felt his softening cock slip from inside me, his hot come following it out of my arse.
Harry pulls off George’s cock just enough to whine out, “Fred please, inside me, fuck. Please fuck me.” Harry leans forward-searching out George’s cock again, and George guides his mouth back into place.
"Ready to go home, love?" Ron asked Hermione.
“The Dumbles and Slughorn problems are problems for our brother and his lovely lady friend.”
I leaned farther into him and had just enough energy to say, “Thank you, Charlie.” I felt him kiss my forehead as he slid out from under me. He must have transfigured something into a blanket because I felt the weight of a blanket as I drifted off to sleep.
Charlie didn’t stop again until he was as far as he could go inside me, his balls rubbing against my cheeks. He looked down at me, making eye contact, smiled, and asked, “Ready?”
Though if he’d told his seventeen-year-old self, that in only two years time, he’d find out the keys to his happiness included parenting three children — a Snape, a Lupin, and a Malfoy at that — married to Draco Malfoy, founder of a half-billion galleon charity, and turning the Wizarding World on its ear with his political influence — seventeen-year-old Harry might have just stuck with becoming an Auror.
“I like it.  I like it a lot,” she says, throwing a leg over Harry and setting her astride Harry’s waist and bending down start a slow passionate snogging session. As Harry deepens the kiss, Ginny slides farther down Harry’s body until her ass is brushing against Harry’s rapidly growing cock.
Harry laughed, “Merlin no Ron, I have no doubts that neither you nor Hermione would ever betray me like that. I am avoiding a Bellatrix Lestrange situation. No one will ever expect me to choose a house-elf to hide my home. But they will automatically expect you. You can’t be tortured for the information you don’t possess. I don’t want either of you ever put in that situation, so I plan to make it clear to the press that my home is protected by a secret keeper, and it’s neither of you.”
“It doesn’t really matter what she wants, it’s not up to her. I mean, I expect her to want to be a part of her grandson’s life, at least I hope she does. But I committed to his parents that I would care for him, and it wasn’t something I did on a whim. I knew the responsibilities when I said yes to Remus and I won’t hand that over to someone else after making that promise.”
Whichever twin is under him starts pressing a lubed finger inside Harry.  He knows it’s not the same person who’s loosening him up with his tongue because that twin is still holding his cheeks apart. The finger in his arse seems to be searching for something, though Harry’s not really sure what would be in there to find, and then all thoughts leave his mind as the finger strokes across something inside him that sends a jolt straight to his cock and Harry is suddenly coming without warning.
“We’re friends. We’re close friends. They don’t need to know anything else. No one needs to know what happens in either of our beds.”
Harry’s eyes widened in shock. “Is that why you three are still here? You’re turning yourselves in?”
“Firewhiskey and talk,” says George passing the bottle to Harry.
Fleur, Harry noticed, had been carefully watching him feed Teddy. He could tell she wanted to know how he was so comfortable feeding an infant. Harry laughed and answered before she could ask. “I’ve known how to hold a baby, how to feed it a bottle, and how to change its diaper since I was seven, but that’s about all I know. It’s all from the Muggle world. Dumbledore had Arabella Figg move into my neighbourhood to monitor me growing up. Whenever Aunt Petunia didn’t want to take me along somewhere, Mrs Figg was my sitter. She tried to make sure I was miserable and bored because she knew Petunia would have stopped sending me if I had a good time there. Sometimes when I was at her house, she was watching the other neighbour’s babies, and she made me help.
“I think he’s enjoying himself, Fred,” George says a little breathlessly. George pulls his thumb from Harry’s mouth and guides his cock to Harry’s mouth. “Open up, Harry,” George says, rubbing the head of his cock slowly on Harry’s lips. Harry opens his mouth and sticks his tongue out, waiting for George to move forward. He feels the hard shaft of smooth, soft skin rub across his tongue, and Harry moans around George. Harry’s not really sure what he’s supposed to do here, but he tries to replicate the things he remembers being done to him before. “Fuck, Harry, your mouth feels good.”
Potter squeezed his eyes closed; his pulse was thudding in his neck. “This is madness … utter madness.”
“Yes,” Potter said, barely hiding an eye roll.
“We had a deal! I
They stepped back to admire the twinkling candlelight. Carefully, Draco wrapped his arm around Potter. He was a little surprised when Potter let him. Potter snuggled close to him, and sighed.
“Your Grace!” The man stood hastily, knocking over his chair. The man flailed, obviously trying to remember protocol. He bowed deeply, his glasses nearly slipping from his nose.
Crystal hung from nearly every surface in the Great Hall. The windows sat snow-licked; the fires roared cheerfully. There were hundreds in attendance, and Harry had never seen so many jewels in all his life.
Harry had his own opinions about the matter, but he kept quiet and ate the third course (a light salad with braised lamb).
A terrible, sickening thought occurred to Draco. “Did you stay because Granger requested it of you?”
“Oh, yes,” Harry said, then hesitated. Even during his sickness, he felt the class divide between them. Being self-taught, Harry doubted he knew a fraction of what the duke knew.
“I’m going to sit down now,” Draco said, then added, “You may tell me to leave at any time.”
Watching his face, Harry eased his fingers inside Draco. Draco’s mouth fell open; his hand came down to tug his desperate cock.
“It slipped my mind.”
The front door opened. It was such a random, unexpected thing; Theo just turned to see what caused the noise.
“But I don’t have the money for it.”
“You are correct that I don’t know German, but the songs’ emotions still moved me.”
Harry looked away from the aristocratic man across from him. He stared gloomily out the window. “It was only a matter of time, Your Grace.”
“Yes, it’s normal procedure, unless someone fetches you beforehand and posts bail.”
“Oh?”
Harry slowly removed his jacket. Granger smoothed her hands across his shoulders, measuring.
He left his room, feeling as if he were in a daze. The hallway was dark and quiet, Harry’s feet padding against the carpet.
He wanted to say this to the duke; he wanted to force him down, make him choke and swallow around him, as he took command of his mouth, and he would say,
“Please don’t scream.”
Potter sat for a long time in his chair by the fire. Draco curled up at his feet, utterly content. Finally, Potter spoke: “There are spells I could cast, but I’m not sure if I want to know the answer.”
“You start that way, I’ll start the other way. We will meet in the middle,” Draco said.
“I’m sorry I couldn’t stay with you over Christmas,” she said, “but my family needed me home.”
Very slowly they made their way to the bathroom. In the bathroom, Harry used his wand to fill the bathtub with nice hot water. He used another spell to create fragrant, relaxing bubbles.
“But I don’t see any weeds.”
The house was a small one room. There was a chipped wardrobe, a frayed carpet, and a lumpy bed. On the bed lay a woman who seemed to have hastily pulled on a cap to cover her hair. Her fiery red hair was shot with silver, and her face was very pale.
“Tell him I said no,” Harry said over his shoulder.
“I don’t love you, Your Grace.”
Watkins came back with Draco’s trusty steed and another horse that was brown and smaller. Draco had to clench his fists as he watched Watkins help Potter into the staddle. Draco desperately wanted to be the one to do it—especially if it meant he could put his hands on Potter’s waist, his thigh, to steady him.
“My Pansy likes to play games.” The duke stood and brushed the dirt from his knee.
“Where are your parents?” Draco asked.
“Absolutely not. What an utterly harebrained idea, Harry.”
Suppressing a smile, Potter raised a finger to get the waiter’s attention.
Potter squirmed beneath Draco’s gaze. His hands trailed down to hide himself; Draco grabbed his wrists.
During one gloomy meeting, Granger asked Harry to meet with the Duke of Malfoy in his office. “I cannot,” Harry said, feeling miserable.
“Yes,” Draco said, letting the rage come. “Do you know where the closest poorhouse is?”
He felt nothing when he made his way from his bedroom to the front door. Everything was in shadow.
Draco got Goyle’s attention and motioned to the exit. Nodding, Goyle raced outside to fetch them a carriage.
“How far did he get?”
Draco slowed his hand; he took his time easing his foreskin back and forth. His cockhead was already pink and wet.
“Need a sit?” Draco said kindly.
“How old were you?”
to be occupied with other matters?”
Harry gulped. “I didn’t know who he was, ma’am. I hope I didn’t hurt the cause.”
wasn’t a good thing. “Do you need a shower?”
Granger stiffened. She looked at Ginny as if the young lady had suggested they make a deal with the devil. “What about her, Miss Weasley?” Granger said, voice clipped.
Gingerly, Malfoy rose from bed. Harry lingered, wanting to wrap his arms around Malfoy, help him down the hallway; but he didn’t want to make Malfoy uncomfortable.
“Surely you understand you will be unwell for the next couple of days? If you had deadlines ....”
“All right,” Harry said with a grin. He stepped back and let Malfoy finish putting together the pie.
He listened for a moment. His valet knew not to enter his room until he heard Draco puttering about but sometimes servants were late in setting up his morning toilet.
Draco was growling up a storm. If he’d been in his human form, he would’ve been stomping his foot.
“Don’t,” he said quietly.
Draco halted Potter’s horse and jumped down. He quickly tied his steed to a tree, making sure the steed understood he was not happy.
Finally a note came for Goyle that laid out all the sightings his contacts had gathered. “There are a lot, Your Grace,” he said. “It turns out there are loads of blokes with black hair and glasses walking about London.”
In the days leading up to Christmas, the snow cleared up a touch and Potter regained his full strength. He had still looked unwell in the conservatory, and it had made Draco’s stomach twist in fear. He hated seeing Potter unwell. It made Draco feel as if he were also sick.
“You have a lovely home,” Potter said, trying to climb down from his horse. He fell and nearly landed on his bum. Gibbs rushed to help him. “Thank you,” Potter said, face red with embarrassment.
He wasn’t surprised when a knock sounded on his door. He knew Theo would come.
“I didn’t save you.”
She cocked her head. “You’re looking for someone then? Someone special to you?”
Pansy cackled again.
“A word,” he said to the servant and motioned to the hall. They left the room to speak privately. Draco didn’t want Harry to feel embarrassed or ashamed. “Bring up clothes for Mr Potter. Enough for a couple of outfits. Sensible clothes. Do not forget underthings and shoes. Do I make myself clear?”
Harry crouched, giving him a miraculous view of his arse. He pulled the gown from under the bed and shouldered it on. Tying it around his waist, he looked down at the floor, his cheeks aflame. “I thought we understood one another,” he said quietly.
Potter laughed and kissed him on the nose. “Yeah, me neither. I don’t think I’ll be asking Garth out again.”
Malfoy hissed. “Me too.”
Harry buried his face against his neck, and did what Draco requested. He fucked him over and over, the bed hitting the wall, groaning beneath them. Draco felt like heaven against him, his skin so pale and flushed, his legs so open for him, his cock so hard for him. Harry reached down, feeling Draco’s pregnancy bump, feeling how soft and warm he was, and orgasm came over him suddenly.
Pansy covered her mouth. “How terrible. What are you going to do?”
That foolish, foolish man.
Potter’s cock thickened. He liked what was happening. A desperate flush spilled down his chest. Draco made space for himself between Potter’s legs. He touched Potter’s warm thigh, then the delicate skin of his groin. He leaned down and kissed the places he touched. Potter’s breath stuttered.
He straddled Malfoy and looked down at him. Malfoy looked gorgeous laying there against the white sheets. Malfoy cocked an eyebrow.
!” Potter yelled as the horse jumped a small, frozen stream. He pressed his face to Draco’s neck, trying to hide from the world.
“Hello, Your Grace,” she said in a voice that was a mere whisper.
Draco had watched the man like a hawk, waiting for him to steal something. To his surprise, the man barely looked around before he took up a desk, filled his pen with ink, then began furiously copying notes from one of his books.
“Hello there, boy,” Potter cooed, dropping to his knees. His eyes sparkled behind his glasses.
“Yeah … Hermione’s really busy now and Ron’s still figuring out how to help run George’s shops. They deserve a relaxing night together.”
“Draco.”
“Good.”
“You were exhausted, I’m sure.”
Draco scrutinized him. He wished he knew what Potter was thinking. Potter’s hand moved in circles on his stomach. “That’s not my cock,” he said.
“I’ve shagged men before.”
Malfoy gave him a wink.
Harry muffled a gasp. He felt ill as he watched Goyle pull a checkbook from his inner pocket. Malfoy signed the check and slammed it down on the director’s desk.
“Did you find anything?”
Harry stood to help Malfoy out of his bloody robes. Malfoy clutched at his collar.
to be under the power of men. I know now that I was mistaken.”
Harry wiped the tears from Draco’s face. He held him tighter. “You don’t need them. People who call you names like that don’t deserve your attention.”
The tool was easy enough to figure out how to use. The sun shone brightly and sweat began to bead Harry’s forehead, collect under his arms. He let himself sneak glances at Malfoy as they worked in comfortable silence.
“I didn’t much care about working for Dudley or giving him all my money, but I did care that my lover had said that about me. I could have endured anything else … but of course he had to turn on me to save his own neck. The pathetic thing is that I spent years still wanting him.”
“Couldn’t I just wear the same suit to the dinner and the ball?”
“I don’t understand,” said Draco.
“Oh,” Harry said, frowning.
when he left to meet up with clients, and Harry liked to watch him step into the Floo and disappear in a roar of green flame.
“Hello, Potter,” he said, leaning in the doorway of his office.
Leaving Harry for a moment, Draco went into the bathroom to fill the tub with hot, relaxing water. He made sure there was a flannel and soap and enough towels to get Harry nice and dry. When he returned, a servant was setting out their dinner.
“Why?” Draco asked softly.
“We are not that far from the castle,” Draco said over his shoulder. “I have full confidence that you can find your way back on your own, or I can ask Watkins to come fetch you.”
“Yes.”
“I could never sleep with her. We are friends … it just couldn’t happen.”
The flat was dark when they stepped inside. Draco kicked the door closed and dropped the takeaway on the nearest table.
“Your ribs on the right side are broken,” Harry muttered.
“He got my nose!” Ronaldo said. There was a lot of blood, and Draco felt quite satisfied with himself.
“I’m so sorry, Draco.”
This made the duke’s mouth curl down, his bottom lip plumping up. “You deserve anything you desire in this world.”
Malfoy retrieved it from the table and wordlessly handed it to Harry. Harry scooped some out, then reached behind to get himself ready. It wasn’t difficult; his channel was still wet from their previous fuck.
Speechless, Draco was in shock. He shook a little, his teeth chattering. All he could do was stare at Potter. Potter was shaking, too. He touched Draco’s cheek with his gloved hand.
“Harry,” Draco said, stumbling forward, reaching out. He tried to grab Harry, but his hand went through him. It was useless.
Malfoy blinked up at him, eyes a little dazed. “All right,” he said, though his tone was strange. Harry couldn’t make out what it meant.
“I can’t believe you’re going to let me do this.”
Dudley shook his head. “No, it’s impossible. If you leave, who will take care of the children?”
“I said I was sorry, didn’t I?” Harry growled.
They spent hours thinking about ways to better support the dukedom’s tenants and the National Society of Women’s Suffrage. Draco was already considering how he would pay back the Queen. He hadn’t upheld his end of their bargain, after all.
“I did what was right.”
“No, let’s put them on the tree.”
Potter’s eyes went wide, feigning innocence. “Your Grace?”
want.”
Harry pulled his hand away. “I need to go.” He rose from bed to find his dressing gown.
“I’m sorry about what happened to Potter. I heard … well, you two were married.”
“Let’s see what you made for us.” Draco moved toward the counter.
“I would be a man of no belongings if it hadn’t been for you.”
Draco took an angry sip of his tea. The servant set out his light breakfast of an egg, bread, and butter. He used his spoon to crack the egg open. “Next time I should be
Harry froze all over. He was sure even his heart stopped. “Pardon?”
“Don’t be.” Malfoy got to his feet and drew Harry into a kiss. Malfoy smiled against his mouth. When the kiss ended, he laughed again. “
Draco leaned in for another kiss, but Potter turned his face away. Draco’s lips brushed his cold cheek instead.
“I dunno. I reckon I expected you to say poached lobster or something.”
“No,” Harry said sharply.
Even in winter, the gardens were magnificent. The weak sun shined down on him like a secret friend.
“Yes, I will go with you.”
Malfoy licked his cut lips. “I’m pregnant.”
“No one says no to His Grace!”
“You can have me, Harry. You can have my everything.”
Potter stared at him. “You think I’m the kind of man who would do such a thing?”
He was inside the Duke of Malfoy, and it was glorious. It was the hottest thing he had ever experienced.
“May I come in?” the duke asked.
The duke mounted his horse, then held out his hand to Harry. Harry hesitated before grasping it. Malfoy’s hand burned through his glove.
Draco buried a hand in his sweaty hair. “You are perfect, utterly perfect.”
“My casual wear is not
Draco took a step closer. “You still want me. You
Malfoy reached over and threaded their fingers together. His thumb caressed the top of Harry’s hand. The touch unlocked something deep and sweet inside him.
Pansy sensed his thoughts. She stood before he could say anything more about Lady Granger.
you?”
Harry looked down before he could stop himself. Luckily, the water was too murky to see anything.
Harry didn’t know where to put his hands. It had been so much easier when Malfoy was unconscious. “We need to get you to bed.”
Potter popped up from his chair. “Do you have the herbs? Let's see them.”
Potter blinked at him. He seemed unsure what to say. “Like I said, I’m a conflicted man.”
“I’ve ruined your clothes,” Harry whispered hoarsely. There was something in his tone that made Malfoy glance at him.
Potter dropped his gaze again. “Does it remind you of your tenants?”
Malfoy reached around to stroke his dripping prick. Harry thrust into his hand, his eyes rolling up. His orgasm was close, so close, and it made him clench around Malfoy’s thrusts.
“Makes sense. Will you move back to the Manor?”
“With any luck, Doctor Barwald will be at your residence in a handful of hours,” Draco said, still astride his steed.
“It’s true.”
“Healer Malfoy?” he called politely.
you inside me.”
“Look at this pretty little hole,” Malfoy said. He leaned down and dragged his tongue over Harry’s entrance.
, Draco thought, relieved. Pocketing his wand, he headed to work. The trailing footsteps didn’t return.
Potter turned a bright red. Draco wanted to leer but it wouldn’t be right. He was already going too far with his little comments.
“Of course, Your Grace.”
“Yes, you did.”
“Hello, Harry.”
“You’d be surprised,” Harry said, exhausted but not letting himself feel it.
“My life is a half-life without you.”
Theo approached him, then motioned to the empty chair at Draco’s table. “Do you mind if I join you?”
“He was not a good man.”
“You could have just walked away.”
“Don’t,” Harry said, putting a hand on Draco’s chest. “It’s over now. The man was desperate. I get it.”
“Good.”
“I want you to leave. Right now.”
“Glasses, eh?” The boss scratched his bristly chin. “I haven’t hired anyone with that description in a while.”
Draco turned his face away, skin so flushed. “I love you.”
“I don’t want to get up.”
“Peppermint!” Potter gasped.
Draco’s ears perked up. He recognised the man’s laughter. He recognised his scent.
“Do you think it makes me dirty, Potter?”
Now all he wanted to do was make Potter happy.
“This is madness, I tell you,” Potter said.
“Oh?” Goyle was a very patient man.
“That’s easy. For money.”
“I agree! Goodnight, Harry.” Ginger Hagrid stomped to the Floo.
Draco was lounging in the bathtub, face still pale. Under the water, he clutched his stomach.
he thought savagely. He tried to go for Ronaldo’s leg, but Potter threw up a magical barrier, and Draco ricocheted off it like a frozen Cornish Pixie.
“It won’t be charity,” Granger said. “As far as I’m concerned, you will be working for the cause while at Malfoy Castle. Think of the suit as a form of payment.”
“Of course not! You benefited from his infatuation.”
Her little hand made a fist in her lap. “Then hire better managers. Why are you letting such trivial matters stand in the way of this? We are at a political turning point, Malfoy. We
“I’m ashamed,” he said against his skin. “I’m ashamed that you had to save me from a damn gaol. I don’t know how I’ll ever repay you.”
is better than him.”
Burying his hand in Potter’s soft, unruly locks, Draco urged his head back as he took command of the kiss. He kissed Potter like he meant it, like he had been desperate for it. He wanted Potter to know how much he wanted him.
“You think so?”
Harry knew from the old books that the colour for pregnancy was a deep violet. He cast the diagnostic spell again, this time focusing solely on Malfoy’s stomach. He let out a quiet sigh when he spotted the violet.
Malfoy paused to think about his next words. “I’m meeting a client soon. In public. A pub, if you care to know. He’s a good bloke. I will be okay.”
“It’s just a chicken pasta bake that my aunt taught me how to make.”
In a corner, a boy no older than fourteen was sobbing.
Fear had made him deny himself so much. Fear of being rejected, of being beaten. Fear of being thrown into prison. He had experienced all that, but still he wanted to deny himself. He thought he could somehow control how the world treated him, but he couldn’t. Forcing himself to be unhappy wouldn’t make the world treat him any better.
“What is it?” Draco said.
Draco loomed over him. “What are you doing in my library?” His voice boomed in the quiet room.
“He was better than Voldemort.”
He heard another set of footsteps, different from Pansy’s. He swerved around, wand at the ready. Theodore Nott raised his hands.
He and his teammates took a few celebratory laps around the pitch, their brooms shooting through the air, their faces lit up on the mega screens. Black and white confetti fell from the sky, blanketing the crowd, catching in Harry’s hair. His job was done for the day.
Suddenly Harry had a hard time swallowing. He took a long pull from his fizzy drink, then fiddled with his cutlery for a moment. “When Sirius and I first met - properly met, I mean - he said that I could come live with him if I wanted. It made me so happy, you know. That’s all I had wanted … to live with him in a house - to be with family. But it wasn’t meant to be. He was on the run and then he died. So … I guess you could say I live here because it’s the closest I’ve ever come to living with someone who loves me.”
“I don’t want -”
“I dunno,” he replied.
“Um … I didn’t have plans.”
Potter’s hips jerked. His mouth fell open.
The curtains were still drawn around his bed but he saw a slice of weak morning light. A fire crackled nearby but his room was still cold. He could tell it had snowed overnight.
Harry carded his fingers through his hair. When Malfoy didn’t move away, he grabbed his head for leverage and thrust up into that hot, tight mouth. Malfoy whimpered, saliva escaping his lips.
“Where are we going?”
“I beg your pardon?” There was honest confusion in his voice.
Potter inclined his head. Draco stared at his unruly locks, feeling a touch peevish. Why must Potter be so
Draco still couldn’t believe his nerve. When he had ordered Potter to leave, it had never occurred to him that Potter would do so on foot. It must have been his upbringing; perhaps he was used to walking for miles.
“Shut up,” Potter said, wrapping his arms and a leg around him. He thrust and thrust, and Draco was erect; he was pounding.
He shrugged and looked away. “I just can’t. Give me another member to speak to. I’ll talk to anyone. I just can’t speak to him.”
“Oh, yeah,” Harry said eagerly. “Go right ahead.”
Draco brushed his soft lips against his cheek again. “Tell me. Please.”
“Let me,” Draco whispered as his hands once more went to Potter’s belt.
Potter sighed. “The problem is women don’t report their abuse. Men like you will get up in Parliament and shout numbers that just aren’t true. Your precious statistics don’t represent the lived experience of women.”
This time, they both laughed.
“Is His Grace engaged to Lady Parkinson?” he said suddenly.
“I don’t?”
“Where are your friends? Granger … that Weasley.”
“Oh, God,” Potter said. Potter buried his hand in Draco’s hair. “Just like that, boy.
“A sweetheart?”
“That,” said Miss Weasley, “was the Duke of Malfoy.”
“Perhaps, it’s simply the case of me fancying you more than you fancy me, but how you make me feel? How
“They are dead, sir. Went home to their maker.”
Very gently, Potter healed his nose with a spell. He stared deeply into Ronaldo’s eyes, murmuring things. Ronaldo went in for a kiss.
Harry turned them both and Disapparated. They reappeared in his bedroom. Then they were snogging again, desperate, yanking at each other’s clothes. Harry raised his wand to turn on a few gas lamps, but Draco grabbed his wrist.
win this election for the Tory party.”
“Fun?” Potter repeated, blinking owlishly.
Harry was in a race with the sun, and his life depended on his win. He knew very well from growing up in the countryside how easily a cold night could creep up on a man.
does it feel like home?”
Late at night, he heard Potter’s moans, felt the clench of his fingers against his shoulders. When he wanked, he recalled how Potter tasted on his tongue, how his sweat and musk and cologne filled his nose. His orgasms were lonely, empty things, and they always left him wanting more.
“This is
“Oh, yes. I believe we have ten, but those aren’t for my enjoyment, they are for appearances. Let’s put up a tree right here in the library.”
Draco took a delicate sip of his wine, then said, “I would suck your cock.”
Draco wrenched himself away. He was heavy and throbbing, but he would stop if Potter wanted him to stop.
A few minutes later, Draco galloped away with the herbs in his pocket. He knew his servants had good reason to stare at him; he knew he was acting quite unusual. It didn’t matter. The only thing that mattered was improving Mrs Gibbs health (and impressing Potter).
“You are thinking of all the times I had to be around that smelly giant mate of yours.”
Draco wanted to destroy those photographs. He wanted to destroy them and cherish them.
The duke yanked him off the horse without warning. Flailing, Harry barely landed on his feet. He grabbed the duke to steady himself.
The officer stiffened. “Your Grace?”
Granger pinned him with her sharp gaze. “Is it not true he has been spending every evening in this room with you?”
“Yes, ma’am.” Draco eyed the door, ready to escape as soon as possible.
“Tell that to your brother,” Harry grumbled.
Harry spent the day reading in his bedroom with the door open so he’d hear clearly if Malfoy cried out or fell trying to walk. He copied down a few promising diagnosis spells; but there was a risk because the Blacks’ books were outdated by over a century. Harry hoped he didn’t harm Malfoy in the process of trying to figure out what was wrong with him.
“Yeah?”
The sofa was snug, comfortable. The fire washed them both in cozy warmth. Harry had a blanket wrapped over his knees; he threw half of the blanket over Malfoy, encouraging him to come closer.
“You’re leaving to sleep with another man?” Harry felt a bit dazed.
“Come along,” Draco said, and slapped a hand on his shoulder. A nice burst of feeling shot through Draco when he touched Potter. He could feel how warm Potter’s skin was through his clothing.
Potter played with the moisture on the side of his pint. “Can we talk about something other than Dumbledore and my … my privates?”
“I—how did you find me?”
“While being very, very fit.” Harry nipped his earlobe.
“It sounds like you enjoy his company.”
“Professor Weasley?” sniffed the man. “Never heard of him.”
Potter laughed. He grabbed Draco’s hand and guided him upstairs to his bedroom.
Potter’s eyes darkened. He licked his full lips. “Something like that.”
“No.” Harry crossed his arms over his chest. He couldn’t keep the sullenness from his voice. He also couldn’t stop himself from glaring just a little.
“I figured as much.”
Murderous, Draco looked at Goyle. He mouthed: “
“I know.”
“Yes.”
It turned out Ginger Hagrid was a screamer between the sheets, and Draco had had enough. He transformed back into a man. Nude, he marched down the hall to Potter’s closed bedroom. He intended to kick the door open. He intended to punch Ginger Hagrid right in the face, but then he had an idea.
“Something like that.”
Malfoy nodded seriously. “It’s my favourite subject.”
Draco was sweaty when he made it back to the Gibbs house. Once again, he was struck by how small it was. Thankfully, a thin stream of smoke now issued from their chimney. Good. He needn’t have to sack Carter after all.
Harry’s eyes fluttered:
. It was dirty and used, and it probably had a smell. But he stepped back and let Malfoy into his private space.
“Stop before you make me come!” Potter cried.
Together they pulled Malfoy’s robes over his head. Malfoy only wore trousers underneath. Harry eased his boots off to make him more comfortable.
Then Draco realised it was far too late for even a stodgy professor to be at work, so instead he went to the only gentlemen’s club in Oxford. In the club, he ordered a large brandy. Goyle sat next to him at the bar.
“No! They are … pillocks! I hate them all.” Malfoy leaned close to whisper: “And I’m tired of taking orders from the Queen. I’m tired of doing her dirty work. I quit, I tell you!”
“He said, ‘Good for you old chap. I didn’t think you had it in you.’”
He smacked his thigh. “I said stop calling me that!”
“Yes,” Malfoy said, his nose brushing Harry’s hair. “There are a thousand things burning inside me, Potter, and I can’t whisper even one.”
Draco snorted. “I don’t fear your cousin, Harry. Trust me, if he ever tried to blackmail me, I could squash him like a bug.”
“I’ve got you,” Malfoy said again, and fucked him harder, curling his fingers until he brushed Harry’s prostate.
It took a minute or so for Draco to pull out. He wanted to keep his come inside Potter for as long as possible.
Malfoy turned back to the director. Cold rage burned in his eyes. “Show me where he was kept,” he said, voice still deadly quiet.
Draco grabbed his hip, pulling him even closer. He found his hole and slowly pressed inside. They stared into each other’s eyes as Draco sank into him.
“I thought you wanted me to clean your house,” Draco said.
Draco pushed the door closed and sauntered inside. He’d gained weight since being released from Azkaban. His hair was freshly cut.
“All right,” Draco said casually. “Lead the way.”
Harry gulped. “Yeah - something like that.”
“I’M HIS BLOODY BOYFRIEND! NOW GET THE HELL OUT OF MY HOUSE!” Draco hollered. When Ginger Hagrid ran from the bathroom, Draco calmly turned back into a dog and sauntered back to the lounge. He flopped down on his bed and went to town on his favourite milk bone.
“Of course.” Draco slammed the door shut on his way out.
Parliament was closed for the season but
A mediwitch gently healed the cuts on Draco’s face. “Need something for your nerves?” the mediwitch asked.
“You hardly ever have parties, Malfoy. It’s never good to be unsocial, to reject merriment. When I was a young girl, your family’s New Year's Eve parties were renowned. Your grandfather knew how to hold such splendid gatherings. I especially enjoyed the fireworks.”
“Harry—he doesn’t like it when other people see me.”
,” Harry moaned.
They lounged on the sofa in comfortable silence. There was something relaxing about being with Theo. Draco didn’t feel the need to prove anything to him. They’d both spent time in Azkaban, and that was what they talked about the most.
“You can have me.”
?” There was disgust in his voice, and it made Harry’s cheeks flame.
“Yes, of course; but even the Queen puts away work on Christmas.”
“What about a protest? Right in front of Parliament? We would get their attention then.”
“What?”
“I am the Duke of Malfoy. They will believe
“You must regret ever meeting me.”
“Chin up, Potter. People are watching.”
“Oh, Harry, Harry.” Malfoy closed the space between them and grabbed his hands. He held his hands close to his chest. “I have seen the light.”
Goyle stepped between Draco and the child. He handed the child some money and said, “Now leave off.”
Potter patted his thigh. “Come on, boy. Follow me.”
“You could work your entire life and not be able to give me what a duke can.”
“If you attend this opera with me, I promise not to … force anything.”
Malfoy lay a gentle hand on his cheek. “This part,” he said softly.
Draco hesitated. He wanted to be polite, but he also knew his politeness could make people uncomfortable. “May I sit down?”
Harry left the room. He wasn’t sure if Malfoy would make it through the day without a medical emergency.
It took their carriage a few minutes to reach the conclusion of the long, manicured drive. A footman received them once the carriage came to a stop.
The grin disappeared. “Of course.”
“Are you having a fucking laugh? Do you think those men fuck themselves?”
, Draco thought, and he barked.
Harry was delighted when he discovered he was seated to the duke’s left. He took his seat, smiling politely at his dinner neighbours. His body was hyper aware of the duke being mere inches from him. He stole a glance at the duke, and found him staring right back at him.
“Why not?”
, Harry thought, then felt guilty. Malfoy was a victim, wasn’t he? He’d been beaten up by a client for crying out loud. Thinking about him with those men shouldn’t arouse Harry … it should appal him, plain and simple.
“It wasn’t my choice to live with my cousin Dudley and his family,” Potter whispered. “I wanted to get out, see the world, get an education.”
“Full time. A proper one.”
By the third day, Malfoy was strong enough to make it downstairs to the kitchen on his own. Harry woke up to the aroma of frying eggs and rashers of bacon, and he was delighted to see a pot of tea waiting for him on the ancient table.
“It’s not like that,” Harry pauses, “well, I don’t think it’s like that. I mean, he’s up to something, and no one believes me. Starting to piss me right off.”
Harry broke out into laughter, “Gin, seriously. Do your brothers strike you as husband material for me of all people?”
“True. I’ve dealt with the blood, and I believe you promised sustenance. Feed me, Potter.”
“Oh,” Ron said. “Good idea.”
“What’s the matter Hermione, don’t you find my dressing gown stylish?” Harry said, gesturing to his transfigured dressing gown. “You still have all my clothes.”
May 3, 1998: #12 Grimmauld Place - Harry’s POV
Harry’s eyes went wide again. “You speak to your blood-traitor Aunt?” Harry said, voice laced heavily with sarcasm.
Harry just nodded. He slid Draco’s Hawthorne wand from his pocket and held it out to Draco, “I believe this is yours.”
Harry ignored the Weasley clan interactions and turned to Hermione “Can you fix it?”
She nods, “No, Harry, I don’t want to go back to dating.”
“No! I may be a slag, but I’d never mess with someone’s marriage.”
Before Kingsley could speak again, Harry called for Kreacher and asked for sandwiches for the group. Both Ron and Hermione looked thankful. While finally getting to eat without worrying about where the next food was coming from, without having to pick up and run in the middle of it, the Trio took the time to enjoy their sandwiches. While eating, Kingsley and McGonagall asked question after question about what they’d been through, where they’d gone, what they’d done.
“For what it’s worth, you have my vote. Though depending on the public, that’s a help or a hindrance.”
"One day Harry Potter, you and I are getting drunk and going swimming in your Pensieve."
Ron replies, “Our Harry’s a bit of a masochist.”
Andromeda threw her arms around Narcissa and sobbed. She sat back and asked, “Are you all going to be arrested?”
“Of course I can, but I’m not cutting into you this time. If Ron cuts it out, I’ll heal it.” she asked as she stood from the sofa.
“Can I convince you to just call me Harry?”
"Do you really want to know?"
"Dragons are always in need of proper handling Potter," Draco says with an air of arrogance that just makes Harry laugh harder. "I'm going to the loo, send him off."
Ron's still silent but does begin eating his breakfast. Food seems to wake Ron's brain up because after he's halfway through his first plate, he looks to finally be able to join the conversation that Harry, Draco, and Hermione are having.
Everyone wants Charlie. And Charlie always likes fun. That's a no brainer. So, he's on both lists.
Harry hopped up and grabbed his jeans from the pile to put on. He leaned over and kissed Hermione on the cheek as he zipped them up. “Thanks’ Mione. I know how much you love blood right before you get to eat.”
Harry turned on the water to a temperature that was just at the limit of hot but not too hot to be comfortable. He also turned on the tap that would add potions to the water to aid muscle relaxation. Harry watched as the tub began to fill, and the potion created bubbles. Harry waves his wand for the water to stop once the tub is full and set a stasis charm over the water temperature and the bubbles.
