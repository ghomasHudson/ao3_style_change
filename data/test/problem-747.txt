Draco, of course, refused to let go, instead using his hand to stroke the rest of which he couldn't get with his mouth and looked up at his lover. That seemed to do him in as the next moment he tightened his hold on Draco's hair and started fucking up into his mouth wildly till-
As he sat back down from the check, and put his wand down next to him; He heard a whimper come from Draco. He tried to pay it no mind, 'It'll pass just like the rest of them,' he thought. But it didn't. It got worse till the point of him panting, trying to scream, make any noise till-
Harry tried to say anything to comfort the other man but fell short, resulting at him just staring at shaking man with symphathy.
He made quick work to unbotton Draco's pants, rubbing it as he did so. When it was finally free of it's restrains, Harry spat in his hand and started massaging it up and down, every moan the other man makes going straight to his own cock.
"H-He killed you, then me. I-I couldn't do a thing, he was too fast," Draco strangled out, looking frantic at him.
"I want to, Harry, please," and fuck, when Draco gave him those eyes he's cock started to twitch once more.
He looked in Harry's eyes, hand still on his neck, gently holding it. He doesn't believe he's ever seen one man so handsome. He traces the freckles, tracks all of them with his eyes, till he's staring at his mouth.
Draco's not fairing any better. His mind is empty, save the montre of 'More. Please more'. He knows he shouldn't want like this. Shouldn't feel how he feels. Father always said it was wrong, said it was damned. But at this current moment, with Harry grinding up into him...He'd chance hell for this moment of heaven.
"My good boy," Harry gruffed out as he held on tighter to Draco and closed his pants up for him, not caring about his own release.
Harry was sitting in the tent, trying so hard to stay vigilant; to be aware of any sound, any movement, but it was in vain as his attention was constantly wondering to the man lying asleep next to him.
He got further down on the ground, to where he was lying on his stomach, fit snug between Harry's legs. He looked up, for reasurance and found soft eyes staring back.
There was not one word that came to Harry's mind except "beautiful", as he gazed at Draco. He'll be damned if he called the other man that aloud though. He finally tore his eyes away from him to do another perimeter check.
Draco knew he was close when he's breath started to hitch and the pleasure tilted on the point of too much.
He pulled them apart for but a moment to beg "Harry, please," And while he might've not known what he was begging for exactly, Harry did.
Draco didn't want to, he wanted this to last longer but as soon as he looked into those green eyes and saw the look of adoration in them-
It was... Different from the girls he's kissed. Draco's lips were almost dry and cracking due to lack of care, and so was his but by Gods if it wasn't the best kiss he's ever had. He wants more.
Draco reached his hands to his neck, checking for pulse and once found, gave a small sigh of utter relief. It really had been just a horrid dream. Thoughts of 'We're not dead, thank Merlin,' rushing through his head.
"You don't have to," Harry started as soon as he broke out of his haze and realized what Draco was doing.
Draco shot up, breathing as though he'd ran a marathon, a crazed look in his eye. It took a second for Harry to realize Draco was talking, as he was still unerved at seeing him like this.
The man in question was sleeping across from him. Though one could hardly call it sleeping. Harry could see the twitches and mini tremors that shook through him and, against his better jugdment, all he wanted to do was hold him. To bring some comfort to him in any way. He deserves that, Harry thinks.
Before the Gryfindor could offer any objections just to better the comfort of Draco, he licked at the slit of his cock. Then started licking up and down the shaft, till he finally took the tip into his mouth. He swirled his tounge around a few times before pushing his head lower, swallowing more.
Draco sniffs. "Much. Now, if I can get through this paperwork, we can get a new assignment, and escape this blasted heat."
Tired eyes rising from their thousand-mile stare down the crowded hallway, the wizard blinks up at him. "Because the entire Ministry is ready to kill everyone and everything in my department. It's a bit tense in here."
Draco's fingers tighten in Harry's hair before releasing to trail down the back of his head and along his neck before settling on his shoulders. "Potter…"
But Voldemort bent down—his red eyes gleaming, his snake's mouth wide and full of pointed teeth—and plucked the wand from Harry's hands with a simple, "It is done," and the world erupted with noise.
His soothing words don't mean anything, not really, but as he continues to whisper them into Draco's hair, he knows it's the only comfort he can offer that Draco will accept. So he tells Draco that it's okay, that Harry forgives him, that Harry doesn't blame him. And though he shouldn't, he tells Draco he loves him, cherishes him, would do anything for him.
It's an immediate mistake, because unlike Blaise or Dean or Seamus, Malfoy is looking directly at Harry. Not at his hand on his prick, either, but on Harry's face. When Harry looks at Malfoy, their eyes lock, and Harry feels that hook in his gut
He dozes off at some point in the night. Draco has to shake him awake, and though Harry's eyes are dry and sore from too little sleep, he forces them open so he can see Draco in the early morning light streaming through the barred window.
The slap against his arse leaves Draco laughing and dancing away from Harry. Grinning, he spins around in time to catch the smug grin on Harry's face as he does up his fly.
Draco's thumbs dig into Harry's temples, not unkindly. The pleasure wrenches a groan from Harry's chest, and he feels himself flush in embarrassment.
Potter lets out a relieved sigh. "I thought I was imagining things. It's burning up. You mind?" He gestures at his robes, and Draco shakes his head. "Thanks, mate."
"Drink," Harry says as he puts a glass to Draco's mouth. Draco sips at the cool water gratefully, letting it spill from the corners of his mouth in his enthusiasm. "Slowly. You'll make yourself sick."
"This is nice," Draco finally said, his voice rough and sleepy, "but I need a cigarette, and they're downstairs."
"Fuck!" Draco grabs at Potter's robes and drags him all the way behind the box. "Damn it, Potter. What the hell are you doing here?"
It was a Thursday night. A football match on the telly had finished a half hour earlier, and the crowd had gone from rowdy to tired before slowly filtering out of the pub.
It took him a month to realize that what he really needed was a job. Something to keep his hands and mind busy. Fame, of course, made it difficult to do. Oh, he didn't have any problems being offered work. There were endorsement deals arriving daily, flocks of owls settling in his garden in some great, migratory pattern that ornithologists would have loved to study. The Cannons even offered Harry the starting Seeker position on their team (he did
"You can take them off," Potter says, startling Draco from his brief moment of respite. Finally looking up, he nods at Draco's hand and how it still holds his robes away from his neck. "Your robes. It's bloody hot in here, and I'm not going to tell on you for a uniform violation."
Draco's hands, still shaking, opened Harry's trousers and reached inside. His touch was uncertain at first, but as he wrapped his fingers around Harry's cock, he became more confident, more steady. Harry tried not to think about why Draco knew what he was doing but the idea of Draco touching himself and his hot breath on Harry's neck as he watched his hand on Harry's flesh was enough to wrench the orgasm from him, a soul-deep pleasure that had his hips rising from the couch and his heart pounding in his chest.
"No sleeping yet," he says before passing Potter his cup. "I know you think I'm taking the piss, but I do know a bit about Healing, and you shouldn't sleep right after a head injury."
It made the corner of Malfoy's mouth tick up, an involuntary smile that he tamped down quickly. "I'm just here to say my piece, then I'll be on my way."
And though it feels like he's flaying his skin open with slate knives dipped in salt water, Draco Apparates away with Potter encased in his arms.
"God, every time you opened that bloody mouth of yours, I wanted to shut you up with my cock in your mouth. Wanted to fuck the spoiled brat right out of you. And now," — another meaningful twist of his fingers, wrenching a cry from Draco's throat — "I'm going to fuck you raw."
"Ah, Merlin, Harry." Draco digs his fingers into Harry's hair but doesn't try to pull him away. "What've you been… Fuck, what've you been thinking about?"
Malfoy gives a pointed look to Harry's prick, which hasn't caught up with the program and is still hard and expectant. "I'd say otherwise."
When Potter goes to follow after the shining man, Draco hesitates. It makes Potter frown, then reach for Draco's hand. "C'mon, Malfoy," he says, pulling gently on Draco's fingers before letting them drop. "Let's get a seat. I've heard the food's fantastic."
Draco can see a sweat-dampened vest from behind the gaping front of Potter's shirt. It's white and doing very little to hide the muscled chest beneath it. As he stares, Potter shifts, and his shirt falls further open. Draco sees the curved shadow of a nipple and finally tears his eyes away.
Draco tilted his head back, opened his mouth, and breathed out a slow wreath of smoke. Almost without thought, Harry put his hand on the side of Draco's throat. He could feel the trailing end of Draco's exhalation, and when he placed his thumb on Draco's Adam's apple, he felt him swallow after.
It'd been a long day. Ron and Hermione had owled that morning to say they wouldn't be able to make it for Sunday dinner, and one of Harry's freezers wasn't staying cold. The repairman couldn't come out for another day, and while Harry was able to keep his stores stable with freezing spells, it was exhausting to have them going all of the time and required him to sleep on the pull-out couch in the upstairs office. It had left his back aching all day, and paired with all of the time on his feet, he was bone-weary and ready for sleep.
"We'll pick up here after lunch," Malfoy says, startling Harry from his lust-induced stupor. "Make sure to thoroughly wash your hands before you come back for the practical. Any outside contaminants could cause serious issues with the brewing process. You are dismissed."
Draco pours all of his repressed desire into the kiss, lost as it washes over him, drags him under. There's just the feel of Harry's mouth, restless and searching against his, the sting of his hands tangled in Draco's hair, the burning heat of Harry's body pressed against Draco's. It's overwhelming, undeniable, and as Harry's tongue teases at the seam of Draco's mouth, temptation and challenge at the same time, the office sizzles with heat.
While Draco does his best to not die on the table, Potter waits for the waiter to uncork the bottle, pour a small portion into a glass, and then goes through the motions of tasting the wine. Quick swirl around the glass, sniff, pause, then a tentative sip. He hums happily and nods to the waiter, who finishes filling Potter's glass before filling one for Draco.
Dragging his eyes away from Malfoy, he stares into his cauldron and watches as it shifts from a neutral grey to a slightly bluer grey. It takes a painfully long time for the color to noticeably change, and the old adage about watched pots and boiling ricochets through his head as he waits. But staring at the shifting color is much easier than staring at Malfoy and lusting, so he makes friends with boredom and turns down the heat.
Neville stretches, his shirt riding up to reveal the toned expanse of his stomach. Blaise's eyes drift down to the strip of pale skin and the line of darker hair that bisects it before he drags them, clearly unwillingly, back to Neville's face.
It's been awhile since he's lost himself to the simple motion of running. He's not a huge fan of it, something about his flight from Snatchers and Voldemort having put him off it, but when he needs to empty his mind, there's nothing better. He puts on a grey hoodie and matching joggers, tightens the laces on his trainers, and gets ready to lose himself in the feel of his feet on the ground and his leg muscles slowly burning.
isn't half-bad. A bit tinny, if he isn't concentrating, but cool and consistent. It'll get him through the rest of the day.
Harry's thrusts lose their tempo, speeding up and stuttering as he clings to Draco's body. "God, you didn't. Fuck, Draco, I'm—"
"That'd be the concussion." Draco sits again and cradles his tea, blowing across its steaming surface before taking a tentative sip. "If you're going to be sick, do try to avoid the rug. I can Vanish the mess, but I'd rather not lose the decor."
Harry glares at him, but all Malfoy does is a small wave with just the tips of his fingers before he steps out of the shower stall, whistling to himself as he leaves.
"I haven't hurt anyone since I left," Draco grits through his teeth. "I just want to be left alone."
Harry starts with soft touches, limited to Draco's shaft. He wraps his thumb and forefinger around the length, then trails them up and down, slowly but steadily, until Draco has to lock all of his muscles tight to stop himself from thrusting into the loose hold.
"I don't reckon they'll find you till the train's back in London." Harry's cloak settles softly over his aching face. "See you around, Potter… or not."
"You've got eyes on her, then," Draco says, hoping their waiter will arrive soon with the wine. He desperately needs the wine. "Shall I keep you riveted with conversation while you surreptitiously surveil her?"
"What in the hell is going on?" Draco looks at their window and its perfectly placid day, and he feels a bit of smug relief. "Well. At least we don't have to worry about anything more than a bit of discomfort. Has Building Services offered any kind of timeline for when this will be resolved?"
Harry, his body simultaneously frozen solid and burning up from the inside out, watches as Draco storms off with poise and decorum. Even in a full strop, he's still elegant and refined.
Malfoy's surprise is only there for a moment before he nods. "Why not? As long as you're sure you can keep up. We both know how your stamina can be."
"Oh, get the wand out of your arse, Potter." Draco waves at the couch. "Sit. This is going to take awhile to explain in such a way as to not force your security clearance up a few levels."
It doesn't take long. Draco is, if nothing else, a perfectionist. Potter's back bows off the floor, his hands scrabbling for purchase against the wood, and Draco can't help but feel a bit smug when he realizes that Potter's knocked one of his shoes off in the process.
Draco hears the glass settle on a table, then Harry's footsteps as he approaches. He touches Draco's shoulder again, lets his hand trail from Draco's back to his front as Harry walks around Draco's body, stopping before him, only to draw Draco's gaze up with a gentle press of two fingers under Draco's chin.
Draco's laugh is nearly manic. "Oh, Potter, you brilliant man. Pansy's getting an early birthday present."
He rests his head on Harry's shoulder, his forehead sticking to the sweat gathered in the curve of Harry's neck, and pulls his prick out. Even his grip on it earlier doesn't prepare Draco for the reality of it. Thick enough around that Draco's fingers nearly don't meet when he cradles it in his palm and heavy with blood, long enough that Draco knows he wouldn't be able to fit it all in his mouth if he tried. Draco draws Harry's foreskin up over the flushed head and holds back a pleased laugh when Harry groans.
"So, do we just… start?" Blaise asks, his hand resting precariously close to the slit in his briefs. As Harry watches, Blaise settles his fingers overtop of his prick, teasing.
"I don't know what you think you're going to do here, Potter. I may not have a wand anymore, but I've learned more than my fair share of tricks while on the run. I'm not letting you take me in."
it all had to come from somewhere. You can't ship things via Floo. There's too much uncertainty about which fireplace you'll end up at, too much volatility in sending sensitive goods through literal flames. Apparition is just as bad. You've Sided-Along someone, of course. Now imagine doing it with a wooden crate weighing two tonnes.
But as he carefully cuts the root, Harry can't help the surge of blood south when Malfoy hums his quiet approval.
The cock ring won't let him come. Harry won't let him come. But all Draco's body is doing is screaming out that he must, that this pleasure can't continue, that he's going to fall and shake apart and become nothingness if he doesn't.
"Why would I expect anything less?" He takes in the heavy fur-lined cloak she has draped over her shoulders. "Might I offer you a Warming Charm?"
Harry Potter off-balance and screaming at Draco should not be attractive. But as he drinks his tea and takes in the unsteady but righteous fury of Potter in a full strop, Draco has to admit there's something alluring about it. It might be the flush high on Potter's cheeks, or the bit of blood still clinging to his neck. Perhaps the way his muscles tense and relax as he paces, or the narrowed, unfocused glares he keeps tossing at Draco.
He's considering making the feeling worse by trying to figure out where they would've been when Harry defeated Voldemort when there's a noise from the front of the classroom that has Harry's head rising. It's not even a noise, more like an oppressive absence of sound, and he realizes rather quickly what's caused it.
Semen lands hot and warm on Harry's face, across the lenses of his glasses in off-white smears. He opens his mouth, tastes it on his tongue, feels it on his lips. It's hot and bitter, and as Malfoy's shakes, Harry squeezes his grip tighter, dragging another spurt from Malfoy's body.
Still a bit distracted trying to figure out who makes Potter's clothes since they clearly sew seams made of steel, Draco stumbles over the question. "What am I… What?"
Potter sets Draco spinning, slow and smooth. "You've been running for years, Malfoy. No one's been able to find you, to get a bead on your trail. Ever since your father died, you've been like a ghost. Everyone told me to give up, to let it go." His smile is a brutal thing, his teeth gleaming like fangs in the dark. "But I never did. And now, I've got you."
The chair clattered on the table top as Harry dropped it. He didn't even realize he'd cast an unlocking charm without his wand or a word until Malfoy twisted the doorknob and stepped inside. Closing it behind himself, he leaned against the windowed door, then reached back to redo the lock.
When Malfoy turns his back to the lecture hall to write on the massive blackboard at the front of the room, Harry can't help but notice the breadth of Malfoy's shoulders and the taper of his waist, or the way that Malfoy's trousers cup his arse.
It takes a Herculean effort to keep his eyes open as he comes, but there's no way he's going to miss this. His spunk falls onto Malfoy's hand, Malfoy's cock. It mixes with Malfoy's own on his stomach before pooling in his belly button.
"It's perfect," Draco gasped. "You're perfect. Gods, Harry. This is going to be over embarrassingly fast."
Ron points at Harry with his fork, then down the table at Malfoy, then back to Harry. "The two of you. You're a… thing? Now?"
"Deathly," Voldemort hisses. He places his hand over top of the Elder Wand, and Lucius's face goes white. "Give the key over to your son. Now."
of you, of how you've changed. I know it must have taken a hell of a lot of work to do it. It's impressive, Draco.
Draco groaned and pressed himself closer to Harry. Hands cupping Harry's jaw, Draco tilted Harry's head just so, slotting their mouths together more firmly before nibbling at Harry's bottom lip. Gasping, Harry didn't have time to think before Draco's tongue caressed the ache. He opened wider, let Draco kiss him deeply. It was filled with a desire that felt like a revelation, like finding magic for the first time.
"It's not a kinky thing!" Harry pushes his glasses up to rub at the bridge of his nose. "Look, Malfoy beat me that time, and then he kept rubbing it in my face—"
Harry's dressed to perfection. A white starched shirt that fits his shoulders like a dream, tucked into well-tailored black trousers that encase his legs like a lover's touch. His black leather belt is still fastened around his waist, but Draco can't help but wonder if it'll leave its loops, if he'll hear the clatter of the buckle as Harry readies the belt between his hands.
She shoves Draco to the side, and though he tries not to be annoyed about it—she's got an icicle dangling from her right lapel—he does shoot a glare back at the Building Services employee, who's repeating the same spiel he gave Draco a moment before. Grumbling quietly to himself, he turns down the hallway, walks past the various miserable wix still waiting their turn, and wonders if he's got time for a quick bite before heading back to his sweatbox of an office.
to see by, but there's enough light coming in from the window that he won't bang into anyone else's bed on the way to his own. He still does his best to be quiet, not wanting to wake anyone up at this ungodly hour.
He stalked forward, his hair falling over his forehead, his leather coat billowing behind him. A perfect picture of masculine beauty and furor, Malfoy stopped, toe-to-toe, in front of Harry.
When he's back in his room, Harry's fingers tremble as he touches the baby soft skin of his cheeks and jaw.
Malfoy, also dressed in exercise clothes, is leaning against the stands, arms crossed as he watches Harry draw nearer. Like a comet caught by a star, Harry slows, then stops in front of Malfoy, caught by his gravity.
But as Harry turns over on the thin mattress in his cold cell two months later, he can't help but shiver and wonder.
"Well, then." Draco rested his forehead against Harry's, his grey eyes bright. "First time's the charm."
He hated that he was keeping count, and he hated that he couldn't stop himself. All he could do was replay those final words in his mind.
Potter's hands clench on Draco's arse, pulling Draco's cock deep into Potter's mouth. His throat flutters around the head, and as Draco sees stars, he feels Potter's fingers play at the crease of Draco's arse.
Harry's fingers were steady on the zip and as they parted the fabric and pulled down Draco's pants, but as soon as Draco's prick sprang free, they stumbled.
When he's falling asleep in the single bedroom that night, Potter's arm thrown across his waist, he feels Potter speaking against the nape of his neck.
Laughing, Pansy walks from the office and shuts the door behind her. The room feels painfully quiet now that Draco and Potter are alone again, and though he somehow manages to stay focused on the cases before him—kidnapping, potions accident that might have been intentional, murder from two decades ago—the room gets hotter and hotter, until Draco's forced to do the unthinkable.
His lean legs carry him easily from table to table, and his voice, low and mellow like warm honey, answers questions and offers guidance with an ease that has Harry shivering. When Malfoy turns, he catches Harry staring, and his raised eyebrow does nothing to soothe the ache in Harry's veins.
"What the hell, Malfoy?" Harry asked, staring down in stunned amusement as the front of his shirt gaped open to reveal his white vest beneath.
He slumps forward, cock twitching painfully as a final spurt of come dribbles out, and then Harry's there, letting Draco lean against his broad, welcoming chest.
, so there's the slick-slide slap of lube added to the mix. Others, like Harry, haven't, and though he likes it a bit rough, he's not sure he wants the others to know that about himself.
Draco finishes his cigarette, then drops it to the ground before stamping it out. "You forgot murder."
Oh, don't give me that look. I can see that little investigator's mind of your's whirring away. And like I told you, I didn't set out to become a pirate. Moribund needed his goods shipped, and I was willing to walk down to the docks, to interact with the Muggles he wouldn't deign to be seen with.
At first, there's nothing. No sound, no movement. But then there's a frantic scrambling as the Death Eaters in the room flee, falling over each other to get out of the room, to get away before Draco turns on them.
"And grab one of those pitchers from the cafeteria, the ever-filling ones. All this heat is drying me out."
There'd been too much death, he said. Too much harm done. If Voldemort gave the Order one week to let people flee, Harry would be his prisoner, willingly, for as long as Voldemort lived. At first, the ruined courtyard was silent. No one spoke. No one was willing to. Harry's words echoed in that silence until even the memory of them started to fade. Perhaps they'd all heard him wrong, perhaps they'd misunderstood.
"The part of Voldemort's soul that was inside of me died." Reaching into his pocket, he pulls out the Snitch and presses it against his mouth. As it clicks open, he fishes the tiny stone from its protective case. "And it's rather hard to die when you've got the Resurrection Stone."
He'd never been so afraid before in his life. He'd never done something so meaningful before in his life.
Draco barely has to exert any pressure before Harry's falling to his knees. The hard tile stings a bit — he's not as young as he used to be — but that brief, sharp pain is replaced by the dull ache in the low centre of his gut when he sees that Draco is hard in his trousers, the thick line of his prick pressing against the neatly starched fabric.
Harry can feel the heat of Draco's body against his back, and he doesn't know if he wants to lean into it—he's starving for a touch that isn't his own, even Draco's—or lash out.
"Good morning," Malfoy says, his voice loud and commanding. Harry's prick dutifully pays attention. "Today's seminar will be six hours long. There is a three hour lecture in the morning, followed by a thirty minute lunch, then a three hour practical after. I expect you all to pay close attention during the morning session, as it will cover many of the techniques and theories that you need to know in order to succeed during the second half of the seminar."
Of course, that's biting him in the arse now. He sits in the back row of seats with the hood of his sweatshirt pulled up tight around his face. Fiddling idly with the strings, he gets a notepad and pencil out of his satchel and waits for the rest of class to file in. The Auror Trainees look painfully young, and Harry wonders how it is that ten years in the Corps have aged him so much. Trying to imagine where these children were when Harry first became an Auror successfully kills five minutes and any lingering belief that Harry's still young.
He rests on his heels and with steady hands unbuttons Draco's trousers. Nosing at the fly, he exhales easily against the front placard, then eases the waistband down. The starched linen settles around Draco's knees, unable to go any further due to the spread of his legs.
"I had more important things to do," Harry says. He retraces his steps, drags the rough pads of his fingers over Draco's skin. "This isn't your only tattoo, is it?"
"Yes." Draco's voice is rough and filled with gravel. Harry recognizes it from before, from when Harry didn't know it was Draco beneath him.
There's another shout, and when Potter turns this time, Draco's got his wand out and pressed into the small of Potter's back before he can turn back around.
Draco looks Harry in the eye for a long, still moment. Steam curls around them from the water evaporating off of the floor. Harry swallows, and Draco can feel his throat move beneath Draco's finger.
He doesn't have to be told twice. Eyes sliding shut, he draws Harry's thumb deeper into his mouth, sucking on it like he'd suck on Harry's prick if it was offered. He wraps his tongue around the tip, then swallows it as deep as he can. The web between Harry's thumb and his hand digs into the corner of Draco's mouth almost to the point of pain, and while it's not choking on Harry's fingers like he wants, it's good enough for now.
"The room. It's responding to us." Draco pulls at the hem of his vest, lets it drag against his skin as it comes free of his trousers. At the flash of pale skin above his hip, he sees Potter's eyes darken, and the room grows warmer. "To this."
The bathroom is all black marbled and brushed steel. There's a man standing at the row of urinals, and Harry quickly turns his eyes to the two stalls. The door to one is hanging open, and the other's is shut. There's a flash of polished leather, and Harry catches a glimpse of a black Oxford disappearing from view, as if someone is sitting on the loo, their legs pulled up so no one can see them.
A few days later while Draco is continuing his research into the Himbo conservation effort, Potter arrives at Draco's door as if called there by the constant thoughts of washboard abs and trembling biceps.
Draco kisses Potter, though it's a just-there brush of lips against lips. He still isn't sure if he'll be able to dodge a fist if one gets thrown his way, so he's not as fully committed to the kiss as he'd like to be. When Potter's hand raises, Draco flinches, but Potter only rests it gently on Draco's jaw, holding him still as Potter deepens the kiss.
The vibration makes every muscle in his body clench. The pleasure is like pain is like fire. He's overly sensitive, and the razor-sharp ache of it all is nearly too much.
Harry, always blind without his glasses, squints at Malfoy and realizes that his hair is wet, and what Harry thought was a nightshirt is actually a towel draped over Malfoy's shoulders, another wrapped around his waist. As Harry watches, the front of it tents, just a little.
"Is this okay?" he breathed against Harry's mouth, his hands on Harry's shoulders steady only because he pressed them so hard into skin and bone. "I don't know what I'm doing here."
It was partly why he moved here after the war. Twelve Grimmauld Place was too full of mourning for Harry, and Auror Training felt too much like the past eighteen years of his life for either to feel comfortable. He saw a yawning, black chasm of reliving the worst parts of his life before him, and Harry packed his bags, sold the house, and moved to where he should've been in the first place.
His arms pinned by Harry's enthusiastic hug, Ron pats at Harry's hip in response. "She's got to say yes first."
It's not an entirely unusual sound. They're all young and virile, and Harry doesn't hold it against whoever's cracking one off while the rest of the room is asleep. Of course, he should've been a bit more careful with his privacy charms, but Harry figures they must've been in a bit of a rush.
Potter's hips press against Draco's arse, and he stays there for a long moment, both of them breathing heavily into the cool night air. Potter's mouth brushes against Draco's neck, and as he shivers from the caress, Potter pulls back, then slams inside.
"I don't understand why you keep him like that," Amycus Carrow says one night as Harry sits to the side and behind Draco's chair. "With the leash and the collar, the whole…" He waves an indolent hand. "Get up."
Potter sighs when he takes his robes off. Settling them over the back of his chair, he sits with a pleased sound. "That's much better. You think they've mucked up the climate control spells?"
"Not anymore, I don't. Pure fucking blizzard now. Parkison was getting ready to Transfigure her desk into a fireplace before I left. She's already turned the rug into a fur cape."
Green light fills the room. There's a high, unnatural yell, and then the sickening thud of a body. The screaming voices die away until there's just the silence of a room filled with terrified people, uncertain of what to do next.
Weasley, frowning, looks between the two of them. "I really can't figure out what's going on between you two. If you figure it out, let me know."
It shouldn't be hot. Malfoy telling Harry to not fuck up should not be sexually attractive in the slightest. He should not feel a hunger to please, a desperate ache to make Malfoy tell Harry he's done a good job.
"Oh, you've gotta be fucking with me." Ron's eyes are wide, his eyebrows raised so high they disappear into his fringe. "So you're doing it two more times, then."
He's nineteen the first time he asks Ginny to hurt him during sex, and he's a day older than that when she tells him this isn't working.
"Malfoy!" Potter steps through the doors, his black greatcoat billowing about his chest and legs in a truly heroic display. He smiles sheepishly at Draco, then runs a hand through his curls. It pulls his white jumper tight across the expanse of his chest, and though the fabric is thick and heavily cabled, it still somehow defines his muscles in a way that has Draco feeling completely liquid.
"I don't want to forget." Draco wishes he could stride up to Potter, but there's a table in the way, and he has to edge around it carefully. Draco's awkward half-steps make Potter furrow his brow, and Draco prays that he'll have a chance to be suave about this at a later date. Right now, though, all he wants to do is make Harry understand.
Harry stares at the parchment clenched between his hands, then up at Ron, who's still engrossed with whatever form he's busy filling in, as if Ron will help Harry to make sense of it all.
It punches through him as much as his orgasm had. Malfoy's mouth on his, the sudden intake of breath followed by that hand on his hip racing into his hair, pulling him closer. Harry groans and presses his body against Malfoy's. Even though Malfoy's other hand is trapped between them, neither of them seem to care. All they can do is kiss, each press forward and gentle retreat as overwhelming as the last.
Draco starts pulling forms from his desk, and as soon as Potter leaves— Draco's eyes traitorously glancing at the man's arse and staying there until the door blocks his view—the temperature in the room starts to cool. Now that he's no longer distracted by Potter or his case review, Draco's more than a little aware of how quickly the room becomes temperate and comfortable. The sweat-drenched collar of Draco's shirt is an uncomfortable reminder of how warm it had been, and though he's not quite sure if it means what he thinks it means, Draco has an unsettling idea of why his shared office with Potter might always trend towards flaming heat while Pansy and Weasley's office is cold enough to freeze.
"Thank fuck." Malfoy drags Harry's mouth back to his, the kiss a bit too forceful to feel good. Harry's desperate for it anyway.
Cursing, he throws his arm out, casting unruly flames that engulf the ropes and devour them. Potter laughs, high and bright, then hits Draco with a Stunner that leaves his head aching and his body limp and unmoving.
Potter sighs and runs his hand over his face. The fabric of his sleeve groans around his arm. Draco thinks he sees a seam finally give way. "It's fine. It's impossible to think with this heat."
He's laughing when he stands, and though his knees crack — loudly — he can't feel anything but easy pleasure and happiness as he watches Draco put himself back together. Harry grabs a paper towel and quickly cleans up the mess they'd left on the floor and his face, then washes his hands again as Draco crowds in close behind him, pushing Harry's hips against the counter. Even though he's just come, Harry's prick gives an interested twitch.
Even though only a moment ago, they were stroking each other's pricks and neither of them has yet put the offending members back into their pants, Harry looks nervous. Bashful, even. He glances down, eyes darkening and the room growing warmer, and looks back up at Draco through the wet fall of his lashes. Tentatively, as if Draco will spook, he leans in closer and presses the tip of his nose against Draco's cheek before kissing him. It's soft and searching, and Draco lets himself be found. A cool breeze eases through the office, and Draco shivers.
Potter cradles Draco's jaw and kisses him again and again. He trails his lips over Draco's jaw and down his neck. When he bites at the bulge of Draco's throat, Draco hisses in a breath.
She barrels through the door to his office, eyes bright with a near maniacal fervour that dies as soon as she stills in the center of the room. "I thought it was supposed to be a bloody desert in here. This is… this is
Laughing, Potter takes both of his hands away. Draco wants to curse at the loss, but before he can, Potter's cock is against his hole and pushing its way inside.
, and Draco drifts up from the cold, wet ground in a smooth, easy motion. His feet hover over the ground in a facsimile of standing, but his weight is fully supported by the spell.
"Can't." Weasley shivers again. "We tried that, but it didn't help. Building Services put it through, but the window didn't change. And we're not the only ones having issues. Kingsley was nearly drowned in his office this morning. Full on thunderstorm in there. He nearly got struck by lightning when he got in."
Draco glances down at his computer screen—the department insists they use Muggle technology in order to better understand their subjects, and since Draco found Google Image Search, he's had no complaints—and the picture of Chris Hemsworth in board shorts filling it, and nods sagely. "Very interesting, though highly specialized. I'm certain you'd have no interest."
"Well done," he says before lifting the blankets aside to clean up Draco's skin. "You've done so well for me, love."
"You will be assigned a partner for the practical course, but as I count an odd number of students, that means one of you will be paired with me. " He smiles, and it's sharp like when they were at Hogwarts together, sharp like a paper cut. "Mr Potter, if you would be so kind to join me for the second half of class."
Potter flushes and ducks his head adorably. Draco's brain melts a little more. "Ah, thanks. I've been going on about it for awhile, haven't I? Sorry about that. Why don't you tell me what you've been up to lately? Anything exciting?"
He gives her a deadpan look. "Pansy. I'm not telling you until your birthday. Stop trying to sneak it out of me."
When he opens his bleary eyes, Harry drags his gaze up to meet Malfoy's. His mouth is bitten red, plump and wet like a fresh strawberry, and Harry can't stop himself from leaning in to taste.
Before the dinner rush started, Harry slid Malfoy a menu. "Food's pretty good, if you want to grab something to eat before you leave."
Harry couldn't stop his hands from roaming, from finding every inch of perfect muscle and skin and feeling it, finally, without the barrier of clothes between. It was overwhelming. It was glorious. And through it all, the careful motion of Draco's prick against his own, the press and pull, the drive towards completion as frantic as their racing hearts pressed as close to each other as they could get with the obstacle of flesh and bone still in the way.
Tearing his eyes from Potter's body—the man is painfully unaware of Draco's lingering, wandering gaze, no matter how many times Draco loses control of it—Draco refocuses on his paperwork and does his best to ignore the sudden warmth in the room.
"Much easier to speak freely when you've a drink in your hand." Harry pointedly met Malfoy's gaze and refused to look away. "Please. I insist."
ready." Draco turned his head to kiss Harry's palm, and though his breath trembled against Harry's palm, he did it again. "I just don't know how to start."
His safehouse nearly throws him back into the blank nothingness of Apparition when Draco hits the wards. They grab at Potter's limp body and try to tear it from Draco's arms. Cursing, he moves his fingers in the quick motions necessary to add another person to the binding. When the inexorable pull on Potter's body stops, Draco falls back onto the floor, panting.
"I haven't been able to stop thinking about it," Harry says softly, though his hand is rough on his prick. "The way you looked that night."
"Better get your ears checked. They must be as bad as your eyes." Malfoy steps close enough that Harry can make out the individual flecks of grey that make up his irises. They look like granite, and Malfoy's expression is just as hard. "Let's have it out, then," he says. "Last round, right now."
"Why don't you show us, Draco?" Alecto looks at her brother, then laughs. "Does he come when you call?"
Draco doesn't shiver at the curse on Potter's lips or the way his voice roughens with the word. "At least temporarily."
"We're getting a bit old for this," Harry says as he falls back. "Did you really steal a bunch of wallets?"
Draco's cock jumps at the heat in Potter's words, in the way his eyes linger on Draco's mouth and the pulse fluttering at his throat.
"You're sure about that?" Draco's disbelief is like a slap. "It certainly seemed like what you meant when you said it."
The water continues to run, a quiet fall that's the only sound in the room. With his free hand, Draco twists the faucet off before dragging his eyes up to meet Harry's gaze.
Harry watches the bob of Draco's throat and wants to put his teeth to it. And since the bathroom door is locked, and he's fucked the man already, he leans forward and does.
"Everything okay, Malfoy?" Harry asks, though he isn't sure he wants to know the answer. His anxiety grows as Malfoy continues to stay silent. "If this is about the competition…" Harry starts.
Mouth open, eyes dark, Malfoy stares at Harry's hands before seemingly waking up out of a stupor. "What? Now? I hardly see how that's sporting."
Slowly, he undoes the knot. Harry's head is still tilted back, so when the blindfold falls free, it doesn't fall from his face. Resting against his closed eyes, it reminds him of the weight of the Invisibility Cloak, thrown over him carelessly as he bled in the Hogwarts Express.
For a man who was hiding out in a bathroom, Draco Malfoy carries himself without the slightest hint of embarrassment. No, even here, he's all composure and poise as he straightens his cuffs and lifts his chin in Harry's direction.
He drinks his tea rather than answering. Not because he doesn't want to answer Potter, but because Draco deeply appreciates the flush that colors Potter's cheeks when he's angry.
Draco glances up at him, eyebrows raised. "The last time you filed our paperwork, we got pulled in front of a disciplinary committee and, as you recall, were pulled from active duty for two weeks until we'd redone all of it."
thinking about Potter's knickers and what shape they might otherwise be in—Draco finishes the form he's on, sets the new stack of papers on Potter's desk, then lazily makes his way to the Ministry cafeteria.
He kept his touch light. Each caress was slow and deliberate, thought out and considered before being undertaken. The last thing he wanted to do was have this iridescent, sparkling moment end.
But as Malfoy pulls his sticky hand away to smear it through the mess on his belly, Harry thinks it might be the hottest thing he's ever seen in his life.
"What do you think you're doing?" Draco asks. He doesn't pull away, just turns his hand so that it forces Harry's wrist to turn with it. Draco's name flashes white from Harry's skin. "I won't let you out."
It rips through him like a tidal wave, washing everything else from his mind and body but the stunning, overwhelming pleasure of it all. His aching wrists, his aching knees, the tension throughout his body, it's all wiped clean under the onslaught. All there is is pleasure, white and pure, and Harry's voice calling to Draco from a distance, praising him, guiding him home.
He sets his tea down, then helps Potter get loose of the blanket. He bats at Draco's hands, cursing and hissing as he gets to his knees.
"You're pathetic," Pansy says before sitting down next to him, her lunch tray laden with a sandwich and chips. "Honestly, Draco, the last time I saw you looking like this it was, oh, let me think? Literally our entire time at Hogwarts."
"I do," Malfoy says slowly, his eyes narrowed in suspicion. "What's that got to do with anything I've just said?"
Malfoy's hair is a bit longer, and if it weren't for his glasses and his elegant fingers brushing his fringe aside, it'd be hanging in his eyes. His well-tailored black pants cling to his thighs like a desperate lover.
"Tell me what you like," Harry said as he stroked Draco from root to tip, again and again. "Tell me if this is too much."
The floors were uneven. The plaster was water damaged. The ceiling beams bowed in an enormously unsettling way. If he dropped a marble in the upstairs flat, it would roll in sickening circles before settling, every time, in the middle of the floor. Windows leaked, doors hung uneven on their hinges, and the basement wasn't even worth mentioning.
"You're quite passionate about it," Draco says, his mind in a lust- and liquor-induced haze. "It sounds like a great idea."
"Okay, that's enough of that. C'mere." Harry grabs Malfoy's robes in his fist, then pulls him away from the main hallway and into a corridor to the grounds. Slamming Malfoy against the wall, Harry's arm braced across his chest, he asks, "What're you trying to prove, Malfoy?"
Cursing, Draco turns left, then right, looking around for another place where he can hide or lose his tail. But the man chasing him is fast, and Draco's made a misstep somewhere along the way because he's in a fenced in alley, and there's no way he's going to scale the chain link fence before his pursuer catches up.
He isn't wearing his regulation uniform, though that's far from unusual. Harry Potter, still the Golden Boy of the DMLE, does his absolute best to skirt whatever rules and regulations he can. Today, he's got a white shirt on, buttoned up to just beneath his collar bone, and sharply creased black trousers that are clearly bespoke and made by someone with impeccable skill. His shoes, a shining pair of black leather Oxfords, are wet with rain and the soles have a bit of dirt clinging to them, a hint of where Potter's feet have tread on their way to work. There's no sign of his wand holster, but Draco knows it's against Potter's chest, tucked tight to his skin underneath the starched white of his shirt. Invisible, except when linen comes a bit too close to skin, and then it's a tantalizing hint of shadow, a smear of darkness against the pure white.
asking you out. For coffee." Figuring he's already dead at this point, he continues. "Or maybe dinner?"
"Yeah," he says as he reaches for the button at Draco's wrist and flicks it open, "she saw me stand when you left and made me."
"I do care," Harry says, wondering if he can convince Draco to come closer, to let Harry touch him again. "But he won't kill me."
Draco laughs and takes another sip of tea. "Well, I'm afraid what I'm going to tell you next is going to do very little to help with that, then."
Draco grabs Harry's hand and forces Harry's wrist up, baring Draco's name scrawled across it. "Because I own you, Potter. And as long as you're mine, you'll do what you're told."
"Shit." Draco peers around the edge of the box, then ducks back as quickly as he can. The thugs who run the place aren't paying any attention to where their spells are landing, and Draco can't afford to get injured, not with Potter passed out against his legs.
"No." Harry falls into the chair before Ron's desk, tosses his notebook onto the surface, and then buries his fingers in his hair. "No, I'm not."
He's partway through their evidentiary forms when the door to his office opens, and his partner falls through in a wet mess.
“Yeah, I haven’t figured out that part yet,” Potter sighed. “But I wanted to let you know before I start asking around for ideas.”
“We can just say that…never mind, we can’t write anything obvious, she’ll be able to see all the messages when I come back out. Bloody hell.”
Longbottom peers at her, apparently trying to discern whether she’s just fucking with him. Draco fervently hopes she is, but that hope is dashed when Millicent asks several questions about plants, seeming honestly interested when Longbottom starts talking. Draco tries to catch her eye and give her a
“I can do that,” Draco said after some consideration. He would have agreed to a whole lot more to ensure that Harry kept doing what he was doing.
Hermione exclaimed her surprise at that point, interrupting what had probably been an insult in the making. “I had no idea this existed! That’s brilliant, Draco, thank you.”
But Harry was prepared and had faster reflexes. Without hesitation, he hurled “SECTUMSEMPRA” at Draco.
“Oh, I’m sure Evadne is just fine,” said Ermintrude. She stretched out a hand toward the Kneazle, who hissed again. “Excuse you,” Ermintrude huffed.
“You can’t prove it’s a nude painting,” Draco said haughtily. “In fact, I don’t even know what you’re talking about. It’s abstract, Pansy, you’re not supposed to be able to tell what it is. The curator told me her personal perception of it is a calico kitten playing with a ball of yarn. See, this here’s the tail, and the yarn is the thing over there.”
“It sounds utterly ludicrous, Hermione. You have proof? You know for sure he isn’t just pretending?”
Draco’s insides felt frozen as soon as he spun around and saw Granger – Hermione – running toward them at full speed, because this couldn’t possibly be good news.
“Yep,” said Ron on his way to the door. “Me too. It’s called the ‘Harry’s a blind, oblivious idiot who doesn’t listen to me’ crisis.”
“I’m sure we’re all very sad for your missed opportunity,” said Blaise as he wrapped his stasis field around Smith’s with a complicated, jerky wand motion. He turned towards the stool as though waiting for it to be vacated, which didn’t happen. Smith only crossed his arms and glared.
That was when Draco remembered that Potter was a rash, hot-tempered Gryffindor who would probably actually do what he was threatening. With a sigh and a wave of his wand, he unlocked the door, but otherwise did not move.
“That’s too bad. If you had, you probably would have come up with a brilliant idea to get free by now – their saliva can do wondrous things, you see.” The last words she addressed to Pansy, who nodded and put on a serious ‘I am listening very intently and extremely interested in whatever you’re telling me’ sort of expression.
Potter shrugs. “I saw Hermione eat one of the Bakewell tarts and asked her if she was crazy. She said that Parkinson and she had a good talk. That’s all.”
Draco swallowed hard as he rearranged the herbs, separated them out and reached for his silver knife. “You know why.”
The wands of his teachers, and Draco watching attentively as they performed their spells in front of the students.  Snape, clearing the smoke from one of Finnigan’s explosions. Flitwick, demonstrating the levitation charm. McGonagall, transforming animals into water goblets.
Draco was completely bewildered. When Eden knocked on one of the doors leading away from the room, he turned to Potter. “What in the world is a hen party?”
Severus snorted in disbelief. “There are plenty of other spells which will accomplish that – or even your fists.”
he asked himself, trying to hear something, anything except silence. There was only the sound of water spraying from the walls. But Malfoy was still here, somewhere.
After the judging is finished, all the bakers stand ready to receive their total score for the weekend. As it turns out, the Charms Round has allowed both Harry and Draco to make a decent jump towards the top of the leaderboard, and so it’s Ernie who has to say goodbye to the competition, along with – unsurprisingly – Hermione. The two of them bow and wave, and the audience showers them with generous applause.
And even though the drunken haze dulled everything by now, he understood the momentousness of the occasion. He understood that this wasn’t something he could pretend to have forgotten about in the morning, and somehow, beyond sense and logic, he knew wouldn’t need to.
. He screamed for help, but nobody seemed to hear him. It was hopeless, nobody wandered near Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom, so what should he do? His thoughts raced wildly. Leave Malfoy here and fetch someone? No, he was far too afraid of returning only to find him dead.
The two of them sat there for quite a while, silent and unmoving. While Snape attempted to stare holes into him, Harry kept his gaze lowered and took in Malfoy’s still form as he tried to reassure himself. Malfoy looked better than he had only a short while ago, and hadn’t the nice apprentice healer said that he would be alright?
A dull pain bloomed in his chest every time he laid eyes on it, a harsh reminder of the stunned shock that had crashed through him and the entire wizarding population when Harry Potter had died. Draco had never even spoken to the Saviour after the war trials, but seven years of shared history meant that Potter’s death had hit him hard just the same.
“There was a sound,” said Clearwater. “Some sort of strange…it’s difficult to describe. The Veil’s always whispering – that’s why it’s policy that no one goes in by themselves, it gets dangerous if you start listening too closely – but the whispering was suddenly drowned out by something like…like a howling wind, and the fabric of the Veil moved more than it normally does. And then Harry came sailing out.”
“Why in the bloody fuck did I decide to pitch myself back into the Veil the first time, then, when I had no way of knowing it would work because the time loop hadn’t even happened yet?” Harry asked. “Wouldn’t have made much sense, would it?”
“Give me a hand, yeah?” Potter asked. He was apparently trying to get up but struggled to find a way to pull himself up safely. As a healer, Draco should probably have insisted on a monitoring spell, but he doubted that Potter would wait for him to cast one, so he moved forward with a mental shrug and pulled Potter to his feet.
Then came the day when Slughorn paired them together in Potions. Draco was the one to get the ingredients for their Allergy Alleviator, and by the time he returned, Potter had set up their cauldron. Draco dropped herbs onto the cutting board and was completely unprepared for a hand to snatch his own.
Even though it had been more than two years ago, he remembered the day in detail, down to the fact that it had been a soggy cheese sandwich he’d been in the process of eating when one of the other trainee healers had burst into the room and simply shouted it out.
doing here?” he asked with a sigh. Had they all planned to meet up here, so they could laugh at Harry’s I-am-maybe-possibly-worthy-of-dating-Draco-Malfoy delusions?
He had no idea how long he had been at his work when he heard the echo of footsteps coming closer. Even though he tried hard to ignore the sound, truth was that few people had good reason to come this way unless they were looking for him. Whether it was another gaggle of students looking to torment him, or perhaps Slughorn wanting to chase him out of the room, he didn’t know, but either way he had no desire to be interrupted.
“Draco asked me to check on his plants while he’s gone,” Neville said. “But I think helping you takes precedence.”
He tried to lead her into the kitchen so he could offer her tea and buy himself a little time to process that someone with whom he’d only ever traded insults was at his doorstep at eleven thirty at night, but she stopped in the dimly lit hall and faced him.
"No, there's a big long list," Draco said. "The more experienced healers can usually do them all from the top of their head, but they still use notes to make sure they haven’t skipped one. Ultrasound gives you an actual picture, yes?"
When Draco opened his eyes and scrutinized the unwelcome visitor, he realized that Harry was no longer entirely steady on his feet. He must have been drinking as well. What a pair they were, both so pathetically broken over what should have been a meaningless affair of mutual gain.
Granger approached, handing her a steaming cup of tea, and Parvati took it with a nod of thanks. The rest of them remained silent, solemn. Draco stared blankly at the decorative green glass bowl filled with mint humbugs and candy canes, which was probably supposed to spread festive cheer but fell well short.
Madam Pomfrey started working immediately. She called through the room to her assistant, “Holly, quickly! I need Essence of Dittany, healing cloths, and blood replenishing potions, now!”
“Great,” said Draco. “Let’s start with anyone who came to your house when you were there for the summer. Did you have visitors or anyone who worked for you?”
Draco retrieved the poor owl that had flown into the window glass and checked her over for injuries while Harry untied the letter. The parchment was heavy and gilded around the edges.
“You have to realize,” he said, “that this really is a huge secret, and we do have to be very careful who we share it with. Even I only know by sheer necessity.”
“Why Potter,” he said, carefully keeping his voice from shaking and instead infusing his speech with a healthy amount of disdain, “have you been
“The first one wasn’t our fault, you know, Lyman Selwyn is just a colossal arsehole,” Harry interjected.
Embarrassment at his strange behavior hadn't set in until hours after the fact. He had since experimented with the hair-pulling, but to his disappointment he hadn't been able to recreate the floaty feeling of peace. Scratching his forearms had a tendency to calm him, but the effect was so minuscule Draco thought he would have to scrape his skin right off before approaching anything like what Potter had given him.
“Alright,” said Potter, and Draco watched with amusement as Potter took out his wand, transfigured a medium-sized rock into a chair, and went to sit down right there in the driveway, quill poised. “Don’t mind me, I’ll only be taking notes.”
“Very well.” Draco waited for Potter’s quill to stop scratching. “Did she mention feeling strange at any point? Did she look uncomfortable, sick?”
"Yes, it is." Hermione turned to go back the way they'd come, and Draco followed, but they both froze when they saw Ron and Blaise headed their way.
“Oh, Merlin no,” Draco said and lunged for his sleeve when Potter made to approach the closest lamp. “If you do this, I will leave you here and your tongue will fall off because you won’t be able to pronounce any spells to get it loose.”
“I’ve been meaning to ask – I need to know what your, ah, stance is as far as my living situation is concerned.”
Draco would have asked why Potter was in stasis, but since Granger had summoned him because of his expertise, he assumed that it was the same reason why Draco’s patients so often were in stasis as well. “How do you know he’s been poisoned? What signs did he show?”
“I don’t know. I frankly can’t be bothered to worry about it, either. The Aurors might be able to figure that part out.”
Draco pretended not to notice. The last thing he wanted was for Potter to get self-conscious, to stop their arrangement. That would have been unacceptable. So he willed down his erection and buttoned up his shirt, forcing himself to maintain a bored, neutral expression as he nodded at Potter and left the bathroom.
Harry reflexively yanked his wand up to cast a spell and then realized there was nothing powerful enough to keep him either dry or warm – not when the wind was so strong that the rain was pelting damn near sideways, and the sheer amount of what was coming down could have filled a small ocean. The curb was already overflowing.
“Probably better,” Draco agreed, but he sounded distracted as he stared at the letter. “What the fuck?” he said then.
Draco’s heart sinks immediately. He tries for a neutral expression, but Potter knows him to well to let it pass.
A hush falls over the crowd as Molly and Kingsley walk up to the black table. There is a sound like a struck gong, and the first cake appears on the table in a swirl of dramatic glitter.
“Not coincidence, maybe, but…it’s the Realm of the Dead, Draco, it doesn’t play by the same rules. Maybe there’s an explanation, but frankly, I’m not too concerned about it right now because I haven’t got the time for it, and it’s already worked seventeen times, so considering that the alternative is both of us dying, I’m perfectly willing to risk it.”
After several more questions for the purpose of nailing down the timeline, Draco decided there was no reason to torture the poor woman any longer. It was obviously upsetting for her, thinking back to the incident, and so he thanked her and shook her hand and assured her that they would find the Secretary’s murderer.
But he had. His hand came up to cup Draco's cheek, and he pulled him close for a kiss. Their lips met clumsily. The intimacy of the moment was painful. Draco's pulse pounded as Harry deepened the kiss, tongues meeting and tangling, and he clung to Harry desperately. There was something between them that was new, intense and frightening. He couldn't breathe.
They trudged through the sludgy snow of the High Street for several minutes more before leaving the village behind. Luckily it wasn’t a Hogsmeade weekend for Hogwarts students, else Draco never would have agreed for the two of them to make their way to the castle on foot. He could understand why Potter had expressed the wish to pass through Hogsmeade, however. Any former Hogwarts student who hadn’t Imperiused people and distributed cursed necklaces there was bound to have fond memories of the place.
For a long time, Potter said nothing, opening his mouth repeatedly and closing it again, moistening his lips. Draco tried not to be too obviously impatient. Eventually, Potter managed to speak.
“Three meals a day. No skipping. Even if you don't want to eat, try to get down at least a little something.”
“I don’t even have words,” Draco muttered, looking as if he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. “This better be the last one, else I’m casting high-security anti-owl wards around this place.”
Draco wanted to pitch himself head-first into a convenient snow drift for bringing this up, even if he knew perfectly well that he couldn’t have known.
She rolled her eyes. “Oh, I remember now what else I was going to ask – have you gone over the notes on your arm recently, Harry, or do you have them glamoured all of the time? Is there anything that might pertain to something we’ve found out recently?”
“What do I do?” Harry asked, utterly lost. “I just took off like an utter berk, he must think I’ve gone ‘round the bend. What do I
fabric, he realized a moment later, when he was frowning down at something grey with a large bobble on top.
“Harry! Hey!” Draco hisses. When Harry looks, he’s faced with more white crystals in a cauldron. “Does yours look like this?”
“I know,” Potter said, looking rueful. “If it hadn’t happened to me or had such enormous consequences, I’d be laughing too.”
“I can’t help but wonder if I would have been one of those bullies if she'd gone to school with me.”
And now his wand was all that was left, and they’d displayed it like a memorial designed to punch Draco in the gut whenever he caught sight of it.
“Yeah, she’s good,” Blaise agreed. “Shame she quit after Potter died. I mean, it’s understandable – losing a partner is traumatic at the best of times – but still.”
Theo’s face finally clears. “Oh, that! Well, we figured you two had finally gotten around to sneaking out and doing the dirty somewhere, just like they predicted.”
“Oh, this is going to be my take on a Bramble cocktail, you see” Ernie says. From the corner of his eye, Harry can see him waving his arms around in illustration. “I’m doing a lemon sponge, and the filling will be blackberry with a healthy dose of gin.”
The sight that awaited him shook him to the core. Malfoy lay on the floor, his skin deathly pale, and his white shirt soaked by a mix of water and blood. Harry was so shocked he could barely move. His limbs began to shake, his heart raced so fast he was worried he might faint. He hadn’t intended for this to happen! He’d just wanted to teach Malfoy a lesson, and now Malfoy was lying here, covered in blood. It had to be a dream, it couldn’t possibly be true. Harry started to hyperventilate.
“Why not? Why do you bloody care about what happens to me? You don't like me, Potter, so don't pretend you do.”
Draco couldn’t claim to understand, but then, he didn’t have a significant other he could decide to keep secrets from. He cleared his throat. “I was coming to take more blood, actually,” he said.
“I know Sylvana didn’t work in the ward, but would she have had access to it outside of visiting hours?” Hermione asked.
He had done a blood analysis so many times he could have done it in his sleep. But things wouldn’t be that simple, he realized once he had it under the microscope.
Draco had to admit, however, that it was all far enough in the past now that the memory and the shame that came with it were no longer all-encompassing. He turned and regarded the elaborate iron sign that hung from the archway they had just passed.
“I am,” Potter protested. “Do you see me hurling insults? I mean, apart from the accidental one just now?”
“You probably figured out there was no way to get help because Clearwater had barred the exit – presumably it happened somewhat similarly to last night, first time around – and you thought maybe the time sand would let you travel back to the department a few hours earlier when people were still there and could help you,” Draco suggested. “But you also knew the poison would render you unconscious soon enough, so you wrote something about that on your hand to give yourself the best chance of survival.”
For the first time in a very long time, all was right with the world, and he felt like a child again, running through the manor carefree and happy instead of with terror in his heart.
Harry had simply meant to take a walk to clear his head. The fresh air, the steady, repetitive movement of his steps, and the slowly changing surroundings usually gave him the space he needed to think things through rationally – channel his inner Hermione, as it were. But after he slammed the door, ready to go stalking off into the night, he stepped right into a torrential downpour, and the sound of thunder growled overhead as the wind tore at his hair.
“We’re with the Auror Department,” Harry said. “Do you happen to know who was the one helping Sylvana Brown when she was here to get fitted for new robes the day before yesterday?”
“Are you sure about that?” asked Pansy, her tone implying that she was certain no one but Harry could ever be this dumb.
She laughed. “Go home and have some tea and think about the cheeky snowman in a telephone box,” she advised.
“They're not wrong,” he said eventually into the silence. There were a few tears running down his face; he wiped at them ineffectually with his sleeve, embarrassed.
“Oh, no.” Pansy stood and loomed over him as well as somebody of her size could, which was…not impressive. The looked on her face more than made up for it, though. “You are not leaving me alone in this place! And you sure as the hells aren’t going to quit your job over Harry fucking Potter!”
A second later, he felt the stinging hex hitting his skin. His cry was more one of surprise than pain, although it did hurt – in the best way. How Harry had discerned that this was something he needed, he didn't know, but it worked. Over and over, Harry touched the tip of his wand to Draco's back, until Draco was a shaking, sobbing mess, hunched over with his palms and forehead on the floor.
With a wave of her wand, the matron cleaned the blood off the sheets and replied, “I’ll be glad if he wakes up at all, Severus. I’m not terribly worried about the scar.”
He was in the shower when he realized that the last of the marks on his body had faded. There were no more bruises to connect him to Harry, nothing tangible he could cling to. It was well and truly over. He was alone, again, and for good. He hadn’t thought it would hurt quite so much.
“He reacted…badly.” Draco sighed. “And then, I reacted badly and insulted him, and he just…stormed out, he was that upset. And that meeting was supposed to be my chance to impress him, Pans, and I fucked it up so badly.”
“Ah, well.” Harry adjusted his glasses in endearing fashion. “I’ve been writing down what we’ve found out about the poisoner and the victims – and about possible motives Marielle, Zach or Penny might have had. This entire thing is getting too bloody complicated for me to follow along.”
It was strange, he thought, that he’d managed to fall into a pleasant camaraderie with Granger almost immediately, yet Potter still seemed able to make him feel insecure and awkward simply by being in the same room.
He listened attentively, every muscle in his body tense, ready to strike. And there it was! He registered the unmistakable sound of a foot splashing water as it was set on the wet floor. Lightning fast, Harry emerged from his cover and stood face to face with his arch enemy Draco Malfoy…
“Do shut up and write, Potter.” Draco glanced up and realized Harry had never even started and was instead standing there, looking wide-eyed at the already existing notes on his arm, marker hovering in mid-air.
And it’s even more maddening that I probably could have figured out some of it if the Time Room hadn’t been decommissioned.”
“Oh, of course. She’s been feeling guilty for far too long, don’t you think? Besides, I needed a distraction.” She bit her lip.
of complaints! I…no, you don’t get it, do you?” She made a sound of bitter amusement. “Taking the high road doesn’t stop those people, Harry. I tried. I tried for so long, but nothing ever changed, and then I tried a different approach, and…look at it! It’s working, Harry. I can finally do something more than stand by and watch as these horrible people get away with belittling and discriminating and hurting and acting like it’s their right to do so.”
Everyone was quiet again and looked at him. The rain continued to drum monotonously against the windows.
“Makes sense, I suppose,” Potter says. “McGonagall did keep going on about unity and friendship and looking beyond our school houses during the welcoming feast. I’m impressed she took the initiative. That’s probably what caused everyone else to make an effort, too.”
“Fine,” he said. “Meet me in the same bathroom after dinner tonight. We can talk then. I'm not letting you bring down my Potions 'O'.”
Parkinson ignores him. “Dear audience, we have to say goodbye for today. Please join us again two weeks from now, when Biscuit Week will test our remaining bakers in new and unexpected ways!”
“I’ll buy you a new cloak once I’ve got access to the Potter vault back, how’s that?” Harry offered, then looked around. “Right, I’m going to cast a Notice-Me-Not.”
For some time, they were quiet as they walked, then Harry said abruptly, “We should find a Christmas tree soon.”
It started with a memory of Ollivanders, the day he had purchased his own. He pictured the many rows of haphazardly stacked boxes, some of them new and others ancient, the worn labels on the ends and the dust flying up whenever one of the boxes was taken off the shelf. He remembered the first two wands he had been given to try and the way they hadn’t felt quite right, then the hawthorn wand and the silver fog it had produced once Draco held it, making his own robes and those of his mother sparkle merrily before dissipating.
“That…yes, I suppose that is what I’m saying.” Draco ran a hand through his hair and then made a face about it. It felt good not to have to suppress his favorite nervous tic because of blood-smeared gloves, but he'd overcompensated and now he was sure his hair looked beyond stupid. “But how does it
“Draco, Harry!” she said cheerfully. Her face was barely visible over the mountain of decorations she was carrying, but they could clearly see the reindeer antlers on her head. “I’m so glad I caught you. I have more things for your home!”
. And despite me having a pulse and all, being dead must have changed something in me that it recognized.”
“’Scuse me,” the man mumbled and reached for a red shirt that had been draped over the chair. Draco watched, mouth open, as he collected items of clothing from all across the room and dressed himself in what turned out to be an elaborate Santa suit. The trousers had to be velcroed shut. The shiny black boots and fake beard came last, and then the man slunk away with his eyes firmly on the floor.
“Have you tried catnip?” she asked, and Draco immediately started wondering if Victoria had spent too much time with Luna Lovegood lately. He would have to keep a very,
“No, but if you do it the Muggle way, you’ll need one of those machines they use to calculate things. My friend Millicent – you remember her, right, from our year? She liaises with a Muggle bank for Gringotts, and she told me her contact was overjoyed when they figured out magic wouldn’t be able to crack the codes. She liked the idea, so she learned how it worked and then fashioned some spells that work the same way.”
“Draco,” Harry cut in, “Draco, we have less than half an hour to try and survive this, do you really think that wasting time –”
While he’s whipping his egg whites and sugar into shape with energetic wand movements, Harry thinks that he’s lucky he has learned to tune out Hermione’s constant nervous muttering before tests over the years, because she is working at the station behind his, and she’s doing it now. Instead of History of Magic facts, she’s reciting the steps to creating her tiramisu swiss roll at lightning speed. She’s clearly nervous. The entire thing is her brainchild, after all.
“Er...” Harry ran a hand through his perpetually messy hair. “Look, Malfoy, I know this year hasn't been the easiest for you-”
By the time he got there, she had saved her spot with a bookmark and summoned two glasses of water. She was hastily trying to untangle the string of fairy lights but gave up after a moment, instead unplugging them and moving them out of the way with a frustrated swipe of her arm.
Granger rolled her eyes. “No, they didn’t really think at all before trying to just Vanish the entire thing. It didn’t occur to them that you can’t Vanish time like it’s an object.”
“Nothing, really. I’m just processing. It’s…” He shook his head and then shrugged, a bit helplessly.
Draco nodded briskly. “You don’t owe it to me,” he said. “Granger, probably, but not me.” Another spell, lungs this time, searching for any damage. Looking intently at a patient’s chest had never been an issue for Draco – until now. Of course. He decided to busy himself with feeling for weak spots in the tissues of Potter’s right arm at the same time, just to keep busy.
Harry suddenly found it hard to breathe. He struggled out of his chair. “Stop! Stop the bus!” he yelled. “I need to go back! I need to tell Draco that I, er…”
“Yes.” Draco wished he could run his hands through his hair or even just tap his finger to the outside of his thigh, but he was wearing gloves smeared with blood and bile and other things, and he couldn’t help but think that taking them off now would be akin to giving up.
Harry stared dumbly at his wand, which he’d forgotten to lower, and then back at the bus. He gave a mental shrug.
“Interesting,” said Potter. “I need you to owl a list of anyone you’ve been in a romantic relationship with to Auror Patil as soon as possible. I will let her know to expect it by tomorrow at the latest.”
Potter cleared his throat. “You know, this pureblood pissing contest is entertaining and all, but we’re trying to solve a murder here.”
"I'm getting to that part. I happened to be over at the Granger-Weasley household to discuss something with my colleague when Potter here burst through the Floo and started complaining about you and about the fact that you're being an absolute grouch –”
Draco grimaces. “I think the raspberry filling ended up too wet,” he says, apparently seriously concerned. “How about yours? Looked good, from what I could see.”
She’d been approached by Blaise Zabini, of all people. He’d been looking for a spectacular idea for a Muggle Studies project, something that would help reintegrate Slytherin with the rest of them, and that could show the world they weren’t bad people at their core. Harry didn’t know the details of what they had planned at first, but the entire thing had evolved into a spectacle of epic proportions. If Harry had to guess, it was because after the traumatic war they’d been through, the entire wizarding world was dying for some light, harmless entertainment. He isn’t about to complain. The contest marks the first time in a long time he’s been able to make himself care about something.
“Yes Ron, I’m talking about Draco Malfoy, the tragic victim of circumstance who was cleared of any crimes by the Wizengamot, among others through the testimony by fellow contestant Harry Potter.”
“A Notice-Me-Not isn’t anywhere near enough to keep you from being recognized, all that anyone needs to –”
“I need this,” he said bluntly, making himself vulnerable. “I don't know what I'd do if you stopped.”
“She’d gone to get fitted for new robes,” Parvati told him, reaching for her teacup. She made a face, presumably because the tea inside it had gone cold. Draco helpfully leaned across the coffee table and prodded it with his wand.
Draco, who had been in the process of reaching for his wand to cast yet another diagnostic spell, faltered. “A
"I'll do Marielle's office first," Harry said even before they'd come out from beneath the invisibility cloak. "Shall I find you in Penelope and Smith’s office once I'm all finished?"
Blaise mixed drinks. He was the one Draco took to watching, because the prospect of alcohol cheered him a whole lot more than watching everyone turn his clean little flat into an abomination dripping with seasonal, vomit-inducing cheer. He’d lost track of Harry and decided he didn’t want to know what
“As well as can be expected,” said Draco. “There’s still some tissue, vein, and artery damage, and his lungs aren’t quite working at full capacity, but it’s nothing the right potions and spells and a bit of rest won’t be able to fix.”
Draco kept pounding, eyes firmly on his work. He didn’t want to think about Harry’s words. It was no use to go back to what they had, only to have to go through this same pain again when it ended. He would have to stand firm.
“Yes, of course, the kitten, Potter, are you some sort of simpleton? Can you not even make out the subject of this piece? How dull.”
“I…I was…” Harry took a deep breath, feeling the prickle of oncoming tears. Fuck it, he had screwed it all up anyway. “I was trying to de-gnome your garden, because I needed to do something to show you I was sorry because I forgot our anniversary, except obviously it’s not actually our anniversary, because we’re not properly together, but I really wanted to be and so I was trying to be romantic, except something happened to my arm and now it’s stuck, and I’ve just announced that there’s something going on between us, which nobody was supposed to know, so now I’m a horrible idiot and everything is terrible and I want to die.”
“Oh, this and that.” Babs stuck Draco with a needle, and he somehow managed not to flinch. It reminded him of what they were really looking for.
“How lucky there’s a pregnant witch going out of her mind because she can’t make herself useful,” Hermione said pointedly.
Eventually, Harry put his empty glass down, looked over to Hermione and said, “Go on, then. You’ve got a theory for what in Merlin’s name happened the last sixteen times I went back into the Veil, yes? Because I still don’t understand one bit about that part.”
“Eh?” Draco frowned in confusion and then followed Harry’s gaze to a tall, imposing tree in front of one of the fancier buildings on the other side of the street. “We don’t need a Christmas tree.”
Parvati wiped her eyes again with the base of her palm – Draco found the lack of dainty mustn’t-smear-makeup fingertip dabbing very refreshing – and stood. “Harry, I am so happy that you’re here, and I’m tempted to talk to you specifically for several more hours, but I’ve already been here too long. Armadill will be wondering where I’ve run off to. I’d love it if we could talk sometime soon though.”
There is a long silence, and Draco can tell the exact moment Potter figures it out by the breath he sucks in.
“Do excuse me, Potter,” he drawled as he got up, stepping over Harry's legs just as a balloon exploded overhead and showered both of them liberally in green sparkles. With a muttered curse, Draco stalked off, barely just catching Potter's half-open mouth and forlorn expression.
“Considering the things I’ve heard - isn’t a Weasley dinner utter madness by definition?” Draco wanted to know.
For the next two weeks, Potter avoided Draco, and Draco avoided him right back. It was quite a feat considering they shared a common room, classes, and the 8
I've decided to post the mostly-unedited drafts of the remaining chapters, since I'm not in a good place currently and have no idea whether I'll ever be able to get this done otherwise. I'm sorry about the long wait and the lack of polish, but for right now, it's unfortunately the best I can do. I hope you can still get some enjoyment out of it, as well as a satisfying reveal of the mystery. Much love ❤
Harry pushed his glasses up again, making Draco feel an inescapable urge to kiss him, so he stopped and did. Faintly, he wondered whether he should feel embarrassed about acting like a giddy teenager, then decided not to bother.
Harry tries to make sense of them. Apparently, he’ll need to make two batters, then divide them both in half again and add varying amounts of cocoa to each. There’s caramel involved as well, of course, and chocolate icing. He can’t imagine the result, whatever it is, will be worth the effort.
“No…well, sort of. Ermintrude – that’s the other old lady – asked me to tell you that she won’t let her sister murder you.”
“You think you can swoop in and make things okay again?” he rasped, looking at her for the first time in the conversation. “You… you have no idea, Granger.”
“Malfoy, I have the Elder Wand. I will obliterate the fucking wards on your house and apparate straight into your bedroom if I have to.”
There was a long pause. Just as Draco realized he should probably offer Potter a seat, and he opened his mouth to do so, Potter spoke.
Of all the things, it had been Fiendfyre that had trapped the Golden Boy in a basement after he’d been disarmed and gone recklessly charging in anyway, like the blasted Gryffindor he'd always been. It wasn’t fair, Draco thought, that Potter, who had risked his bloody life so many times for other people, who had risked it to save
He couldn’t help the snort that escaped him at that nonsensical statement, and tiredness mixed with irritation was finally getting the best of him. “
“You tap it thrice with your wand, push the button, then set it down and point it where you want the barrier to be and tap it once more. You’d best be really bloody certain of the placement though, because it can’t be taken down for sixty-five minutes after it’s put up. Anton and I tried to adjust that time, but it destabilizes the cubes, and we haven’t got a fix for it yet.”
“I agree.” Hermione sighed, stuffed her gloved hands in her pockets and then took them right back out. “Look,” she said softly.
Blaise, who had just stepped through the Floo and then promptly handed Draco a potted plant and a satchel, said nothing, but he smiled at him in a way Draco found rather suspicious.
Lastly, I'd like to extend my sincere apologies to anyone who has any actual Chemistry knowledge. Reading the magical theory in this one will probably be like fingernails on a chalkboard.
Potter studied his face for a moment. Draco's vision was hazy, but he could still see the look in Potter's eyes changing to one of determination, just before he ripped aside the collar of Draco's shirt, popping the first few buttons, and bit down on Draco's shoulder.
“It was clear, though, when we rolled him over and saw his face,” said Clearwater. “I went to fetch Hermione, and then we saw the writing.”
“Alright.” Potter sounded unconvinced. He took a step back, but then hesitated and stepped forward again, stretching out his hand. The tips of his fingers ghosted across Draco’s cheek. “Good night.”
left?” Harry sounded stunned and sort of lost, and Draco couldn’t blame him. They had all known Susan for years, but Harry had been her Auror partner, and that sort of thing created a unique bond.
The next time they met in their bathroom, it was an emergency. Draco was beside himself with mental anguish, he could barely even think clearly enough to get to the right room. There was a thunderstorm raging outside, harsh lightning illuminating the bathroom at irregular intervals. Draco huddled up in the corner and hoped that Harry would know to look for him here when he wasn't at dinner. He couldn't bear facing anyone else.
“It said not to put me in danger,” said Granger, “so I suppose in one iteration I must have been, and…oh.” She paled.
“Not quite, no, but similar. It never stopped. Nobody knew how to fix it or really do anything at all, so they simply left it alone, and…considering what happened later, with the bell jar, that was probably smart.”
Ron raised an eyebrow. “Behind your back? Would you like to move in with us so we can be sure to do it in front of you if the topic happens to come up? Or should we just spend every moment you’re not with us pretending we don’t know who this ‘Harry’ person is?”
Draco nodded at Hermione’s words, feeling numb. He didn’t even know Susan Bones all that well, and if
“Indefinitely, in theory. There’s just no way for me to understand all there is to understand about this poison from one day to the next, so I’ve circumvented actually having to deal with this yet-to-mutate form in the blood. Eliminating the one already in the cells is fairly straightforward.”
“Mate.” Ron pressed the palms of his hands to his desk, spreading his fingers over the many forms that littered it. “He fancies you. He’s fancied you for ages. You’ve fancied him for ages. What is the actual problem here?”
“Fair point,” Draco conceded. “Would you notice if one of them is fake when you try to re-enchant it?”
“We can’t let on that we’re suspicious,” he starts. “Merlin knows what they’ll do if they think they’ve been found out.”
Apparently, Draco thought when he had unlaced the ribbon and found a silver necklace inside the box. A crystal disc as big as Draco’s thumbnail had been attached to it, and inside, suspended, was a spark of pure magic, orange-golden and bright. When he turned it in the light, it glittered beautifully. Draco had never seen anything like it. When he touched the disc, feeling awed, the familiar feel of Harry’s magic prickled his fingertips.
Harry hands over his wand without question, realizing only after she holds it in her hands that she’s the one of very few people for whom he’d do this without hesitating even a moment.
“Can we eat these ones?” Molly eagerly reaches out, takes one of the leaves tumbling in the breeze, and pops it in her mouth. “Oh, it’s made of dried apple, such a nice idea. And the pumpkin?”
“Isn’t it obvious?” Granger – Hermione – frowned at him, and then generously at the rest of them. “I didn’t cast the spell to hide the writing until Zach, Penelope, Blaise and Marielle had already had a chance to see it. There is no telling what might happen if our poisoner found out exactly what the clues are talking about. They might decide making sure Harry never wakes up is in their best interest.”
“Lovely spellwork, first of all.” Molly smiles at the colorful beachball tumbling to and fro atop the sand, which Harry very much hopes is not actually sand.
He found himself yearning for touch, for Harry’s touch, even when he wasn’t at his worst. It was more than coping, at this point, it was pure want, a luxury. But he thought he was good at hiding it. He thought that until they were both up late one night, studying in the 8
“Well,” said Potter, looking incredibly awkward and reluctant, “it only just occurred to me that there must have been a good reason the message on my arm was phrased the way it was.”
“No, I need to walk. I haven’t done enough of it over the last few days, and I’m sore from just sitting and lying down.”
Pansy stared at him for a long moment before she said, “I can’t wait for you to tell Minister Shacklebolt that he has a depraved mind,”
Draco cleared his throat as loudly as he could, which earned him a disapproving look from Babs. “Are you
“No.” Draco frowned. “I’m not sure…now it says twenty-five years and seven months. I’ve never seen this happen before, it shouldn’t… Merlin.”
“I know,” Draco said, and slumped even more. “I’m completely fucked. And…oh, Merlin, it just occurred to me that I’m even more fucked than I thought, because there was a
“She does,” Harry said, “We’ve talked a couple of times. I feel awful that my vanishing has affected her so much.”
It wasn’t really fair, because Millie was working on applying it to much more than just messages, but it was how she’d gotten started. The prospect of a new method of keeping secrets was sure to warm any Slytherin’s heart.
And it wasn’t, as became abundantly clear as soon as she slowed, looking wide-eyed and frazzled, and caught her breath enough to get the words out.
“That’s fine,” she said and held up a paper bag. “I brought breakfast. Afterward we need to go to St Mungo’s and grab everything you need from your lab. I squared everything away with them, you’re on infinite loan for this, er, case. One of the Auror Department’s potions consultants, Victoria Sommersby, is going to help out in your ward until you get back.”
Holly stroked a calming hand down his back. “Let’s get you up, Harry. Draco will be alright. Would you like to sit with him?”
“Drank the lemon water you used to dose everyone else?” Draco supplied, because of course that’s what it had been, of
“Oh yes,” Blaise said with emphasis and took a very large gulp of wine. “Might blow up in our faces, in fact, depending on how they faked it. Son of a
“Yes. But this case is different, because the antidote doesn’t need to have a shelf life, therefore we can avoid having to combine anything in a single vial. We can also avoid having them mixing together in his stomach as they wait to be absorbed. I plan to inject them directly into the blood.”
Well, maybe he is, a little bit. Harry has, after all, spent the better part of the last three weeks with the git, trying to turn him into a baker, and they haven’t tried to kill or maim each other once, which is a massive improvement from…well, anything that happened before eighth year, really. So yes, Draco has something resembling positive qualities, and Harry is confident enough,
Draco considered it. They were nowhere near close enough that he would ever be tempted to pour out his heart to her, but they had developed something like a tentative friendship during their antidote work, and he did feel comfortable with her.
“Marielle,” Granger corrected. “Yes. She agreed to interrupt her maternity leave to help maintain Harry’s stasis.”
“Shouldn’t be too much of a problem,” Granger assured him. “I’ll let them know that the Ministry has…I don’t know, commandeered you for some issue that sounds terribly important and halfway plausible. Maybe I can send someone else to help out in your ward for a time.”
“Why now?” he asked. “What changed?” His body was crowding Harry’s, wonderful and solid and warm, and he felt so very, very perfect.
“I’m not so sure anymore.” Theo, the stupid chess-traitor. “I mean, obviously we all thought so, that’s why we left them out of it in the first place, isn’t it?”
It is perfectly obvious to Draco that Pansy has infected Blaise with whatever insanity has taken root in her brain. There is no other explanation when he sees him holding open a door for the Weaselette, waiting patiently when she steps back, looking baffled, and eyes the doorframe as though expecting a trap.
Draco didn’t want to be entirely passive, so he brought his hand up to his mouth and spat in it. Blindly, he reached back and found Harry’s cock, smooth and hot and hard against the palm of his hand, and he started stroking and caressing. There was a sound from Harry like a half-suppressed little whine. Draco loved it, and he tried to draw out more of the same but was foiled when slick fingers twisted inside him and made him lose track of what was happening. Both his hands shot up to grab the edge of the sink tightly.
“But –” Draco started, and promptly gave up because she had already thrown in the Floo powder. Potter was in the room a second later – or at least that was what it felt like – and Draco had had no chance to prepare.
“Granger-Weasley residence,” he demanded tersely. When the call connected, he was faced with Granger, curled up on the sofa and reading a book in the soft glow of what seemed to be a messy bundle of muggle fairy lights lying next to her.
“Weasley, no one is disputing that your girlfriend is a heroine in her own right, but this is precisely what the anonymous judging is supposed to prevent – preferential treatment. According to Miss Granger herself, this competition was conceived to exemplify the blank slate all of us deserve, which will allow us to look ahead towards a better future instead of clinging to the horrors of the past. We should learn from what happened, but at the same time try to practice forgiveness and understanding instead of dispensing judgment.”
Granger obviously agrees with him, because she is reacting to Pansy’s cheerful offer of “Bakewell tart, Hermione?” with an open mouth and a wide-eyed stare. Pansy, undeterred, holds the tray out to her in a way that’s really quite invasive. Granger’s trapped between it and the back of her chair, and if Pansy doesn’t stop inching closer, Draco thinks that Granger might just tip her chair over in a desperate attempt at escape.
“Maybe not. I’d settle for neutral.” Harry led the way to the back of the store, where a lone silver-haired witch in powder blue robes was directing both a broom and a feather duster with jerky wand movements.
“I’ve been thinking about it,” she said, “but the problem is, of course, that we’re talking about something that’s essentially both metaphysical and metamagical in nature.”
“Yes, they certainly did. Oh, for Merlin’s sake.” The witch raised her wand once more and took control of the broom, which had started sweeping the wall. “None of this nonsense, now, you hear me?”
“Hello, Malfoy.” She looked anxious, fidgety, and at the same time even more tired than Draco felt. “May I come in?” Draco’s words about how this was a really bad time for a chat stuck in his throat when she added a quiet, “Please?”
Harry sighed and sat comfortably on the floor, close to Draco. “Tell me what they said,” he requested – no, Draco realized suddenly, he was
Neville winced. “Not without destroying the entire garden’s root strengthening charms,” he said. “But then again, I’d say getting Harry out is more important than the charm, so-”
"Why?" Draco asked, and then immediately answered his own question. "Because he doesn't know the encoding spell."
“How can I convince you?” Harry asked into the silence. “How can I make you see that we’re good together?”
He sighed heavily. “I know. I just…it hasn’t sunk in, you know, both that she’s dead and that she was the one responsible.”
Potter’s wand flew out of his hand and straight Draco’s way. He ducked, idiotically, before remembering it couldn’t actually hit him. There was a clattering sound somewhere in a far corner.
They moved into the living room, which had the proper non-illusion Christmas tree in it, sparkling and colourful, the only movement coming from twinkling lights and snow that was falling on a variety of miniature landscapes inside glass ornaments. The gifts underneath it had been wrapped with varying degrees of care, from ‘I lovingly pre-creased every edge’ to ‘I rolled this up haphazardly and stuck spellotape in random places’. Draco was certain he knew who’d committed the sin of haphazard gift-rolling, and it was confirmed when Harry held out a shapeless blob of shiny blue paper. “Mine first,” he said. “Mostly because I didn’t have a lot of money or time available, so it’s terrible, but I plan on getting you a real one once I have both of those things.”
She reached over and touched his hand in a calming gesture. “No, I don’t think it will have any adverse effects, although we should look into it and get you properly checked over, just to be sure. Any extra bits – for lack of a better term – were added to the combined Harry. The writing, for example, that’s why it always carried over. That’s what happened with your memory, too – I think the older Harry already had his memories eaten away by the poison, the same thing it did to Susan, and the younger Harry had the memories of the cairn and the rest of his life, so those were added to the combined Harry.”
“I’m sorry, Blaise.” Draco sighed and hung the scarf on the coat rack in the hall. By the time he returned, Blaise had stolen Draco’s seat and was busy thumbing through the book.
He figured Clearwater's possessions wouldn't take as long to search, so her desk was where he started. He felt jittery with nerves as he leafed through the papers in her desk drawers, cast
Draco banged his head against the wall. It seemed to be the best answer to that inane statement, and it helped a little in letting him come back to himself.
was feeling this awful…he couldn’t imagine how Harry felt. He’d been sitting by Susan’s bedside for the past half hour, and he might have held her hand if not for the stasis spell. A scowling older Auror Draco didn’t know was currently maintaining it, and another looked ready to leap into action to defend them both, if necessary. The Auror Department did not fuck around when it came to protecting their own, even if Bones had quit two years prior.
Draco did look and saw a snowed-over park, trees and bushes covered in frost, icicles hanging from branches. The sky was clear but beginning to darken, and Harry was wearing a ridiculous hat with five differently colored bobbles that made Draco want to kiss him.
Draco had never had the opportunity to examine them all at his leisure. He gently grasped Potter’s wrist and, when Potter didn’t protest, drew it close.
“Been better,” Draco grumbles, and then he yelps very, very loudly. Harry drops his cookie cutter in alarm.
“Fine,” Harry stepped back into the corridor, but he couldn’t resist shouting back, “I’m telling Hermione that you lumped your intellect in with hers!”
“And anyway, thinking about him doesn’t make me smile, it makes me irritated and grumpy because he’s a git.”
“Both, ideally,” said Draco. “Antidote takes precedence, but I believe the more we understand about the poison, the more effective an antidote we can create.”
Draco nodded curtly. His stomach was churning. There were many very good reason he hadn't been cut out to be a Death Eater, and one of them was his inability to maintain a clear head under certain kinds of pressure. He felt
“We got a second one,” Hermione said. Suddenly, she looked sad. “For Susan. I thought she might enjoy something with a bit of Christmas spirit to look at. We were planning to go visit her later, if you two would like to –”
Sliding out of bed, Draco failed to find his shoes in the dark and left the dorm barefoot, trying to keep Harry Potter firmly off his mind. And still, his wandering brought him to the bathroom that had become theirs weeks ago. He sat there, huddled in a corner, and tried to remember the emotions that flooded him every time he was here with Potter, the content peacefulness. He thought about how Potter had held him just hours before, how his teeth had sunk into the flesh of Draco's shoulder, and he wished Potter was here right now to do it all again.
It seemed to take both no time at all and an eternity until they’d reached Granger’s little office, and by the time they did, they’d managed to hammer out a basic message.
Green eyes – behind an unfamiliar set of glasses that Granger must have brought in – looked him up and down. Draco was shocked by how many of the old insecurities immediately rose up in him. He’d thought himself long past those. He found himself wishing he was wearing his official-looking healer’s robes, or at least had a Muggle stethoscope to hang about his neck, which he had noticed during his apprenticeship was at least ninety-five percent of the trick to looking important and knowledgeable in a Muggle hospital.
“Very.” She sighed. “And he’s not wrong, I should have told him days ago, especially since you and Harry both already knew.”
It was not an easy undertaking. Astonished stares and whispers followed them the first time they walked together between classes. After keeping his head down all year, being the center of attention wasn't something that Draco was at all comfortable with, especially when it took the form of open hostility and accusations being thrown at him.
She tucked the strip of parchment back into the book. “You still haven’t told me why you’re here, you know.”
“Hermione talked to me,” Harry blurted out a moment later. “She said… well, she said a lot of things, but mostly, I think, she wanted me to know how awful you’re feeling. I tried to give you space. But that backfired, didn’t it?”
year party that night, which Draco stayed as far away from as possible, despite the efforts of Pansy and Blaise to get him to go. They weren’t idiots, they had noticed that he’d seemed to be doing better for a while and that his mood had now swung back to worse. But they had no idea what the cause of these changes was, and while their efforts to distract him were admirable, Draco hadn’t been able to take many of them before he had to isolate himself.
Draco sighed and finally turned his head. Despite the darkness, he could make out Potter’s contrite and concerned expression. “Alright,” he said. “Fine. You’re sorry. If you don’t mind, I’d like to go to sleep.”
For this round, Harry has found a recipe for something called Spanish apple cake. It features almonds, apples – obviously – and plenty of rum along with the usual cake ingredients, all underneath a crust of simple icing sugar and lemon juice. He races to get the apples diced and soaking in the rum, trying to ignore the hectic rush all around him. Making the cake is less than half the battle for this round, and he needs to focus on it. Otherwise, he won’t have enough time to finish the biscuits and the spellwork that is supposed to help him stand out.
“Oh,” he said and peered down at his feet. He wasn’t very far up, only just floating, but it was disconcerting, nonetheless.
“Relax,” he said in that new, calm and confident tone of his, and his hands framed Draco’s face. “Close your eyes.”
“Is there something wrong?” Malfoy asked, strangled, and Harry wondered how he was supposed to sit through this stupid meeting knowing that Malfoy had looked at a picture Harry had painted, a picture
Potter said after making a small gurgling noise. Judging by his tone, the little particles were something that made him very,
So she takes a deep breath, whispers something to her friend – who puts her hand discreetly onto her wand – and marches through the door.
Draco looked away and plucked another blade of grass. He took some time to think about the answer before he gave it, and Harry, thankfully, didn't push.
“Can you think of anyone who might have wanted to harm her?” Potter asked once he was finished writing.
“Harry, you pillock,” Draco said eventually. “First of all, I paid George to de-gnome my garden days ago. He said he would place some traps he invented to prevent them from moving back in. I think your arm must have gotten caught in one.”
It was a bit stupid, really. Draco wasn’t even all that close to Potter, and here he was, being calmed by Hermione Granger of all people, a woman who had to have been affected by Potter’s death, and now his return, more than anyone, and who hadn’t had much more time than Draco to process.
Draco ran. He bolted out the door with no idea where he was going, nothing before his eyes but the green that seemed to have seared his retinas. All he knew was running. He found himself stumbling against a wall, his knees hitting hard tile as he retched. Body shaking and heart racing, he curled into a ball.
Later in the day though, he couldn’t help himself. He stuffed a few bites of food into his mouth during dinner and then hurried out of the Great Hall, knowing without turning around that he was being followed.
“Oh,” he croaked when he finally looked up and saw the Veil. “Oh fuck, this…you think this is when you restart the time loop.”
one! And letting me figure it out early would change the timeline more than a bit because I’d be stuck in a lab the entire time.”
“That’s quite alright.” Draco tried to sound as kind as he could. “Let’s move on. Do you remember your mother corresponding with anyone via owl or having any Floo conversations?”
So Draco walked them both back the way he’d come, past the room that had been his lab, to a door he’d never seen any of the Unspeakables go through. At Potter’s prodding, he opened it and peeked in.
"First of all, could you really blame me if I sent out my cards this late?" She gave him a challenging look that softened after a moment. "Not that it matters - this isn't a Christmas card, it’s pictures. I went to a Muggle doctor and had her do an ultrasound - you...sorry, I know you're a healer so forgive me for asking -"
Hands unbuttoned his shirt with haste, greedily slipped beneath to touch his chest. Draco moaned and leaned into the warm touch. He felt dizzy, shaky. No longer thinking, he crashed to his knees. His hands were shaking with eagerness as he popped buttons, sought skin. Finally, he managed to free Harry's cock, and even though they had rubbed off against each other countless times, he had never gotten to look or touch before. This was new. This was... wonderful.
As soon as she had finished the thought, Holly returned to the hospital wing with a tense-looking Severus.
He gave another shake of the head. “I haven’t been there in a few days. I did note down plenty of ideas of what we could try, and I’d planned on starting on them yesterday, but I wasn’t able to go in, obviously. Sorry.”
The little goblin started to say something and was promptly shushed. “English, Bug. You need to practice if you ever want the wizards to show you the slightest bit of respect.”
“That, and while she’s a good potioneer, I don’t think she’s good enough to figure out the entire formula and brew it at such short notice. And how would we get a message to her anyway?”
"Would you like to see the lovely party trick Bartholomew and I can do?" Blaise asked eventually, either trying to distract Draco to keep him from frothing at the mouth - or else this trick of his had to be impressive enough for him to be excited about showing it off. Draco wasn;t sure which option he preferred.
Even if Harry had known what to say to this, he couldn’t have managed to because Draco was too busy doubling over with laughter. “Oh Merlin,” he howled when he finally managed to draw breath, “oh Merlin, ‘your shortsighted decision which you are sure to regret’. That’s some bona fide optimism right there.”
And speaking of appreciative, Etalice has been the absolute champion of the quick beta and master of valuable comments for this chapter!
“Of course not,” Harry said at once. He sounded vehement, even disgusted, and there was something in his voice that made Draco wonder what exactly Harry's history was with that sort of violence. He didn't dare ask.
“I do remember,” Parvati confirmed. She’d taken her hand off her wand but still looked beyond tense. “Does this have something to do with the Department of Mysteries?”
Potter, who was sitting by himself on the sofa, looked up at that. He was very pale and his eyes had a haunted look to them.
Severus’ eyebrows went up. “Who did that?” he asked as he took the book. He risked a short glance at the first page and recognized the proclamation that he himself had written into the book twenty years ago:
“The student’s name is Draco Malfoy, Slytherin house. Check his file for his blood type and bring me the proper blood replenishing potion,” she demanded of the young woman, meanwhile soaking the cloths in essence of dittany and trying to wipe away the blood with her left hand while her right cast a diagnostic charm
Draco considered this. “I mean…if you’re marrying someone like Lyman, I can sort of see the appeal.”
He ends up fifth out of eight – which is made official when the glowing number five Kingsley had scribbled into the air above his swiss roll zooms across the tent and affixes itself to his shirt. As everyone files out and the house-elves descend upon the mess, he vows to make it up in the next round.
a strange sight, but it was also difficult to stay sad and gloomy when there was an optimistically grinning snowman peering out through the panes of glass, by the looks of it having a grand old time confusing as many people as possible.
There was no signature – not that one was necessary. Draco gritted his teeth and tried his hardest not to turn and look. Instead, he focused on the small box he’d set on his empty plate and tried to ignore the curious looks being thrown his way by his housemates. No one sat with Draco these days, but lately, the younger students hadn’t been keeping their distance quite so drastically either. They pretended to ignore him, of course, but the fact of Draco receiving gifts was novelty enough to capture their attention.
It took a while until Harry had calmed down and ceased casting spells at random out of sheer joy, but once he did, he instead looked around and asked, “Crackers?” with child-like hopefulness.
Granger looked uncomfortable. Draco was opening his mouth to try and clarify he hadn’t meant to sound suicidal, but she shook her head and cleared her throat. “Anyway…out of the lot of us, Marielle is best equipped to handle the room. She’s been through a lot in life, love and loss and everything in between. She understands it as well as anyone can hope to, I think.”
“Well, yes, I’m aware, else I’d be dead in a ditch somewhere by now. But it’s different when…what I did back in sixth year…” Draco shrugged, a bit helplessly.  It had been so long ago, and he was no longer that person, but at the same time it felt as fresh as though it had happened yesterday. He was responsible for allowing Death Eaters into what had at the time been the ultimate sanctuary. Students had been hurt because of it. It didn’t feel right to expect a warm welcome back, now or in the future.
“Potter, that’s the opposite of a plan! How in Merlin’s name is that going to break the Founders-cursed bubble?”
“I put a bit of a warming charm on it, though it won’t last forever. Like I said, I’ll make it up to you properly, once I can, but for now this is the best I can do to keep your head warm in this weather.”
“Me,” Granger said simply. “It’s why they assigned me to the Time Room in the first place. It took me three years to figure it out a way to extract the sand, and actually doing it took weeks. It’s been in here ever since.”
“Macmillan,” he hears Parkinson’s voice somewhere toward the front of the tent, magically amplified for the benefit of the many spectators, including those listening on the wireless. “Tell us about the sort of swiss roll you’re making today!”
He was afraid of the pain, the ugly, emotional one, that would tear him apart. He was afraid of that unspecified time in the future when he would no longer have Harry to help him cope. He was afraid of being found out, of everyone knowing how much of a wreck he had become, of how needy he was, how dependent.
The weeks went on, and Harry kept up his end of the bargain. Together, they met Draco's needs in their little bathroom, and outside of it, they tried to be friends.
Thinking about the wet spot in Potter's pyjamas that had matched his own the night before, Draco smirked. “Clearly.”
“Have a seat, mate,” Weasley invites his best friend. “Millicent and Theo are bringing snacks from the kitchen.”
Potter looked less upset than she had when he waved Draco into the room from where he was sitting in his blanket nest, but his face was not a happy one either. He didn’t seem inclined to chat, so Draco figured he might as well cut straight to the chase after he’d closed the door.
To Draco’s surprise, Weasley was actually home when they flooed over to the Granger-Weasley residence for dinner that evening. Things still didn’t seem quite right between him and Granger, but his presence had to be a good sign, at least.
“Parchment’s probably safest,” said Draco. “I’m not sure how your skin would take to it, if it actually works.” He went and searched Granger’s desk until he found a small piece that would do and copied the numbers to it with a few taps of his wand.
He made a compelling argument. Draco stood once more, cheered by the prospect of drinking with Blaise – he’d skipped pub night, after all, which meant they were overdue to sit around, drink and complain about whatever there was to complain about.
Potter frowned, and Draco decided self-defenestration sounded like an excellent idea. Could he have sounded any more cold-hearted?
“She flooed me earlier, actually. So far, all she’s found is that Penelope had a friend who stayed at the ward for a couple of weeks during the time Sylvana worked as a Welcome Witch.”
Severus sighed when the boy was finally out of the doors, and rubbed the ridge of his nose. Then he glanced at Draco, who was looking better by the minute. Some color had returned to his skin, and his breath was even and steady, a sure sign that his body was healing and the potions were doing their work. If Potter had actually managed the unthinkable, to kill Draco, it would have meant Severus’ own death as well. Once again, he asked himself just when the stakes had been raised so high.
“Draco?” Pansy asked somewhere nearby in the hallway, and he heard her heels clicking as she approached. “Oh, good, I was hoping to catch you before-” She gasped, presumedly because she’d caught a glimpse of Draco’s office. “Salazar!”
Harry’s palms are sweaty. Everything he needs is in front of him, and he stands there, tense and anxious and waiting for the signal. He’s ready. He might be taking this entire thing far too seriously, but looking around, he doesn’t think he is the only one. Most of his fellow contestants seem poised to give their absolute best.
Harry looks up and into the face of Draco Malfoy, who’s looking back at him from his own station with a mixture of concern and bemusement.
Draco didn't like it. The sooner Potter left him to his own devices, the better. He could already feel the stares that had resulted from Potter simply sitting next to him on the bench, the other eighth years wondering what in the world they could possibly have to say to each other, after everything.
Hermione set her trifle down on the coffee table with care, stood and towered over her husband with her hands on her hips. “Ronald Bilius Weasley, you’re soon going to have a daughter who stands a good chance of inheriting my bookishness and appreciation for logical reasoning, and if you make this sort of comment about her even just one single time, so help me Merlin –”
In the end, Molly and Kingsley enjoy the lemon cake and sweet biscuit crumb sand, but they’re left a little disappointed that the beach ball decoration isn’t edible. The crowd applauds politely, the cake disappears from the table – to be cut and distributed as soon as judging is done – and another takes its place.
He waits. She waits. Draco waits, and so does everyone else who’s witnessing the scene, which means that the doorway is now effectively out of commission.
Harry’s eyes widened when he heard Draco beg. Without another thought, he fell to his knees at Malfoy’s side and seized his limp hand. It was only now dawning on him that this was not some sort of minor injury. Draco was in danger of bleeding out, and if that happened, it would be Harry’s fault. Suddenly terrified, he shook the limp body, screaming, “Malfoy! Come on, wake up! WAKE UP!”
“I used to hate him, actually,” Harry admitted. He wasn’t sure why he was sharing all of this; he usually detested strangers knowing his personal business. It felt oddly nice though, being able to let it all out. “And he simply loathed me. But over the past couple of years, we managed to mend fences. We were both tired of all the negativity. We started meeting up for coffee every once in a while, just to talk, and we actually got on quite well. Then he told me he was looking for a new place to live, and my old flatmate moved out because Hogwarts offered him a teaching position, so it all worked out quite well.
Draco was roused from blissful sleep by a knock on his door. His mind took a while to get a grip on reality, longer than it usually did. What had happened the night before felt foggy and unreal, like a strange dream, until he realized that it was Granger at his door and was forcefully reminded that he
“I will await you tomorrow evening in my office, at eight o’clock sharp, Potter. I will not tolerate tardiness then, whatever the reason.”
Potter’s throat moved, and a soft, broken keening sound made its way through his slightly parted lips.
“Actually, that sounds brilliant,” Harry announced and gave Draco a look he was unable to interpret. “Doesn’t it?”
“Because I’m the one here who’s most qualified to speak for Harry right now, since he can’t do it himself,” Granger informed him without missing a beat. Smith looked like he wanted to argue, but then he seemed to decide that it was pointless while most of his focus had to be elsewhere.
Blaise looked thoughtful. “A few basic spells to make sure everything’s in working order and ready for re-enchanting. But not really anything to determine specifically whether someone’s trying to fool us. It never seemed necessary, not when the only people using them were the ones working in the Department of Mysteries. They’ve got potential for abuse, of course, but so do half of the Wizard Wheezes products.”
“Still working on the message on Harry’s arm, the one that’s for me.” She grimaced. “It’s not helpful though. I’ve nailed down the encryption method – it’s simple, really, it only needs a single password, six letters or less – but I can’t move beyond that because I have no idea what the word is. And from what I’ve gathered, there is no way to narrow it down.”
“Because you’re blushing, Draco, and you’ve got that ridiculous expression on your face that you only get when you think about him. And also because there’s a blond and a dark-haired man in that painting, no matter how much you try to deny it.”
“They must be clinging to the last shreds of their sanity still,” he points out. “They’re trying to protect us, give us time to-”
“We wouldn’t be messing around,” Granger said, as though that was completely ludicrous. “We would simply be…consultants. Liaisons. You can have those.”
Draco wrenched his wrist out of Potter's grip and bent to pick up his knife. “Do not,” he said in a clipped voice, “talk with Granger about me. Do
“She’s never worked down here, because some higher up cleverly decided that sort of experience wasn’t needed to oversee us.” Hermione sighed. “Idiotic, but she’s what we’ve got. She’s far too nice to fire Zach for anything but egregious misconduct.”
“We won’t,” Granger said gently and finally went to sit down on the couch Parvati wasn’t occupying. Draco approved. It was probably a good idea to give her space.
“That’s actually what I wanted to speak to you about. I’ll need a type of stirring rod I don’t have, and ordinarily I would owl-order it, but those always take a while to be processed, and I’d like to avoid delays.”
“That’s not weird at all,” said Draco. “You got to know them and spend time with them, and now you won’t be able to again. It’s completely understandable.”
“Happening? Not much.” Blaise tapped the satchel thrice with the tip of his wand, then opened it and retrieved a bottle of what looked like a high-quality whisky, setting it on the counter.
“Severus, if you shout at the boy like that again, I will throw you out of the hospital wing. Are we clear?”
“I’m…” Granger trailed off, swallowing hard. She looked at the tree, bronze decorations gleaming in the light of the most recent illusion-fireplace she had decided to deploy. Draco thought he might just have to purchase a set of his own. The way they warmed the room literally and figuratively was wonderful – not that he’d ever tell Weasley that. Even Draco’s adult sensibilities had their limits.
She fought valiantly. Draco could have told her there was no point, and maybe she knew, maybe she only fought because she couldn’t bear the thought of running without trying all she could to save her partner. Again and again, she battled back the fiery creatures coming at her, tried to make headway, screaming Harry’s name as sweat and tears ran down her face and she started to cough.
“Kill me,” Harry said desperately. “Or run into the kitchen and fetch me my wand, so I can do it. Wait, is it possible to Avada Kedavra oneself?”
The crackers didn’t make fart noises, in the end, although several of them bleated like sheep. They wished each other “Happy Christmas!” repeatedly and pulled crackers, were enveloped in rainbow-coloured smoke and tried to figure out which hat would look the most ridiculous on them. Draco ended up with a dainty tiara perched atop his new bobble hat, Harry had a feathery turquoise fascinator decorating his hair, and Weasley wore a white and purple boater. When Hermione joined them and handed everyone a glass of winter berry trifle, Harry forced a glittering green deerstalker on her while her hands were still full. She rolled her eyes but kept it on.
He kept watching as Blaise poured the blackberry liqueur into the glasses, and for a moment, he had no idea what exactly he was supposed to be watching. But then he realized that the two liquids...were not mixing. The crème de mure simply hovered a hair’s breadth above the gin as though repulsed and unwilling to come into contact
“One set, yes. Wanted horrible magenta ones, but I was able to convince her of their unflattering nature. She settled on a different colour in the end – fuchsia. Much, much better.”
It was, truth be told, rather maddening. And Draco continued picking at his food and saying nothing in any of his classes, and his life almost felt like it had before Harry Potter had found him in a bathroom and pulled his hair out of some strange concern for Draco.
“He’s not talking to me at all right now. Left a note saying he’d be with his parents for the foreseeable future.”
“I’m sorry,” Potter said contritely. “It really must have been hard, if Malfoy’s even defending you.”
“Potter!” Draco called out, photograph firmly in hand as he wheeled around and hurried back into the corridor, damn near sprinted by the time he was crossing the department’s entrance chamber. “Potter!”
“Yes. Charming girl, she was, albeit a bit…” Babs tutted again. A glance told Draco that Harry was also confused.
“I…oh. I know you and Ron have said things, occasionally, but I always thought you two were just joking because you were annoyed that I talked about him so much,” he admitted. “And I thought that there was no way you might be right because you don’t usually see him, so how could you know anything about it?”
The young wizard nodded absently and let the apprentice healer maneuver him into the chair she had conjured next to Draco’s bed. Meanwhile, Madam Pomfrey lectured Severus.
Instead of telling him, Granger rounded the body and reached out, before hesitating and glancing at Zacharias Smith, who sat on a stool by the far wall with his wand raised.
“Oh my,” Molly says, taking in the mess the contestants have made at and around their stations. Dirty baking sheets, whisks, and icing sugar have been flung anywhere and everywhere. Along with Kingsley, she starts perusing the rolls lined up on the table in front of them. The judging is anonymous, as to avoid accusations of favoritism, since the contestants have been picked from all four houses and all over the popularity spectrum. Harry sees his creation sitting there, all the way to the judges’ left, and hates how long he’s going to have to wait until he knows whether they like it.
“Well, because Hermione said your flat looked sad, and then Marielle pulled these from somewhere and shoved them at me and said I had better spruce the place up a bit. And I am not about to fight with either of those two about it, sorry.”
Draco doesn’t let go of Potter until they’ve left the library and are standing in an empty corridor, both with the same sort of haunted expression on their faces.
She sighed and massaged her temples. “Can we close him back up and discuss this elsewhere? The smell is getting to me.”
He’d spent days trying to figure out which set of robes brought out his eyes the best, done copious amounts of research barely related to the topic they were supposed to be discussing, just in case it came up in conversation. He’d imagined all the ways the meeting might go, had
“I didn’t mean it the way it came out,” Potter said then, again. “I only meant…well, I’m not sure what I mean. I think I’m just so used to being the one defending her that it felt strange to be on the opposite end of that, with you on her side.”
“Cristina said they had just gotten back from their holiday the day before,” Hermione added. “Spain.”
"Ah." Blaise poured a healthy amount of gin from one bottle into the shaker, then carefully plucked a handful of mint leaves off Bartholomew. "Essentially, I will make it...it's difficult to explain, you'll have to be patient for a moment."
“There was a bell jar with bright light, all the way back there.” Potter pointed. “Quite beautiful, actually. It had this…was it a hummingbird, ‘Mione?”
He fumbled his way through making tea, but was cheered up by the fact that Granger had bothered to bring the
yet.” Granger looked guilty, her face crumpling when Potter scowled at her. “I’ll tell him tonight, I promise, Harry, there just hasn’t been a good moment.”
Draco knew his own smile was changing into something more predatory as he purred, “Well, to even the score, why don’t I tell you about one of the fantasies I’ve had about the two of us? You see, it happens to involve this desk right here…”
It wasn’t Draco’s fault that Potter looked stupid with hazel eyes, and that his forehead without the lightning bolt scar was just
Then Draco finally noticed that he wasn't the only one whose skin had a flush, or the only one who was breathing a little faster than normal. He was still the worse for wear, but it was undeniable that what had happened had an effect on Potter as well.
“No need to sound so surprised.” Harry stuck his tongue out and then touched his wand to his pocket as though making sure the book was still there. “Just to check – all of us are hoping it’s Smith, right?”
A hand came to lie on his shoulder. Draco didn't even flinch at the contact, like he would have done some weeks ago. He had gotten used to having Harry's hands on him, and wasn't that just an odd little fact?
Another wave of icy chill spread through him, much stronger now than the ones before. “Merlin, Harry, we’re so utterly fucked. We haven’t got the time left to think of something, we spent too long on this plan and she still didn’t manage to decode in time.”
Clearwater made a polite face and stepped past him to look down at Potter. “Anything new since I left?”
A short, oppressive moment of silence later, Granger huffed out a humorless laugh. “I was waiting for Zach to make a scathing remark, just now,” she said. “I’m so glad he went off to sleep. I’m not anywhere near calm enough to keep from hexing him.”
“Draco, who-” Pansy started, and that was the question, wasn’t it? Who would go through this much effort, for him? Not only were the floor and his desk and his shelves covered in flowers, but there were vases literally
He couldn't help but wish himself among them. He couldn't help but wish he could touch Harry outside of their sacred time together in their bathroom, or, hell, sometimes his ridiculous mind imagined kneeling by Harry's feet right in the middle of the Great Hall and letting everyone see who he belonged to. But it wasn't his place. He wasn't the Saviour, he was the Death Eater, an afterthought, and he was supposed to be thankful he had as much as he did.
Harry remained silent for a while. Draco, after drinking, did the same. With the sudden warmth coursing through him, he felt almost like before he had broken it off, Harry’s presence so comforting next to him and the tension that had always,
“Should have worn short sleeves,” Harry says without thinking, and then winces when Draco freezes, realizing he’s an idiot. “Shit, sorry. I didn’t mean-”
“Well.” Draco cleared his throat. He felt wrong-footed. None of his patients had ever had him quite as tempted to blurt out a hundred questions at once and at the same time made him wonder to what degree their opinions of him might have changed over the past eight-ish years.
Harry kissed him again, more deeply this time, licking the seam of Draco’s lips until they parted and allowed Harry’s tongue to slip between them. Draco’s hands came up to clutch at Harry’s shoulders, and then they were pressed against each other, lost in the kiss but for the nagging doubts and fears in the back of Draco’s mind.
A little while later, as they were all busy clearing plates, Hermione said, “Last night, just before we all went home and left the aurors to clean up the mess –
“What?” he asked, because he was fairly certain that a kissable Harry wasn’t what she’d been referring to, and she veered right toward a tree, forcing him to step back with haste to avoid her.
Draco has stopped moaning with pleasure by the time they were in the lift but that didn’t mean he wasn’t enjoying the remainder of his meal. Potter, damn him, still hadn’t lost the smirk he’d worn ever since Draco had taken his very first bite.
“I’m not sure if they’re related, but it would make a lot of sense if that’s the case. Harry, this is Stanislaus Selpie. I remember him because I attended one of his lectures on antidotes once, a long time ago.”
“My point is,” she continued, oblivious to his shock, “that you two were helping each other heal. I want Harry to be happy. He’s earned it. He was well on his way, but now he’s backslid into brooding and his temper is just horrid. I need to know how I can help fix this.”
year common room, behind several stacks of books, in order to try and get his homework finished without encountering distractions starting with the letter “H”. But he was foiled when the same owl who had delivered the small package landed on his parchment and hopped on the not-yet-dry ink.
“She was feeling fine before the meeting, and then she kept shivering afterwards. The meeting lasted around forty-five minutes, and I’m going to assume that she talked to her assistant afterwards for no more than five minutes.
“I won’t be calling you that for much longer anyway,” Draco pointed out dully. His chest hurt, suddenly. He told himself it was the poison. “Do you know how unlikely it is for the sand to take you exactly to that point in time by coincidence?”
Rose.” He watched the letters reform into numbers, feeling the chills getting worse as he did, and then cleared his throat. “Right, are you ready?”
“What did you tell Molly, anyway?” Harry asked. “I can’t imagine it went over particularly well when you said you wouldn’t be coming to dinner.”
Draco marvelled at how calm Harry sounded, but he felt extraordinarily foolish when it finally occurred to him that Potter would hardly have been such an excellent Auror if he was likely to crumble under pressure.
Draco had never seen anything quite as beautiful as the two slender vials of swirling turquoise liquid sitting next to a bubble of suspended, glittering time sand.
Draco managed to pull himself together. “Right,” he said, and straightened up. “And before that can happen, I need to do a lot of work. We should get going.”
She beamed at him, which was not remotely close to the reaction Draco usually got when he introduced himself. “I knew a Draco once,” she said. “Wonderful man.”
She hadn’t done it right away after apparating them to the park. Instead, she’d let the cold, fresh air ground him until his breathing slowed and his vision cleared. Now that it had, she was crouching next to him as they both stared at the unending flurries.
Draco only shrugged. He didn't have the right to refuse a request like this, not these days. He couldn't imagine what Potter could possibly want from him that warranted tracking him down like this. He hadn't done anything. He stayed out of everyone's way with an efficiency that bordered on compulsion. His need for solitude defined him these days. If he was alone, huddled in a corner or in his bed, he couldn't get caught up in anything bad.
Draco gave a bitter chuckle. His pride was stinging, but that wasn't the important bit. He knew how everyone would be talking for the rest of the day, and probably even longer than that. How the Death Eater couldn't handle the reminders of what he'd done. How Malfoy dared to think his pain was worse than that of people who'd seen their friends and family die. He had heard it before. Now it would just flare up again.
With a wordless spell, Madam Pomfrey closed the curtains around her patient’s bed while also still peeling the cloak from his lifeless body, then carefully opened the buttons of his shirt and pulled that off as well, mentally thanking Merlin that extensive training and years of experience had taught her to work quickly and efficiently. Feeling more and more alarmed, she looked at the boy. Across his chest, from the left shoulder to the lowest rib on the right, was a cut that was copiously oozing blood.
The words tore through Draco like a lance of ice. Here it was. This was the end of everything he’d had, and Merlin, it hurt. It hurt.
Blaise shot him a look of death. “Would you like to wager a guess as to who demanded that I come over here and ask you whether you were planning to grace your parents with your presence at all this season?”
“Idle curiosity, really. You said before that some of it looked like sensitive information. I’ve been wondering how and why it’s all written down on his skin, but I haven’t been able to come up with a plausible reason. Unless he thought he might be obliviated, but…well, none of it quite fits. The poison message wasn’t there because he might be obliviated, it was because he knew he wouldn’t be conscious to tell anyone.”
Granger ceased writing and lifted her head, following Draco’s gaze to the fire dancing merrily in a fireplace that looked wholly unfamiliar to Draco, who had been in this office quite a bit during the past two days.
His fingers twitched with nervous energy as he roamed the hallways after classes, deep in thought and wondering how to save himself from the worst of the fallout. It would ruin him.
“See that it doesn’t happen again, peasant,” Blaise said with his nose in the air, and sniffed in a disdainful way. “Wait until my father hears about this.”
“I asked that as well. Apparently, when she does maintenance, there’s a few things she wants to make extra sure she’ll stay away from, so she puts a barrier up.”
“Oh,” Potter said and stuffed his hands in his pockets. “Alright. Will you tell her thanks? She’s the one who went to talk to Susan and told her about what happened to me.” He was still frowning, and Draco wanted to explain that he hadn’t meant to sound like an arsehole, but the words wouldn’t come.
“I doubt it means much, but…” Draco shook his head. “It’s strange, and I don’t know what to make of it.”
“As soon as I’ve had some sleep,” Draco said immediately. “I’ll need to take the sample to my lab, and – “
“Today’s theme, which was picked by a vote on the WWN, is the four seasons. Honestly, I’m a bit disappointed – I was hoping that one of the more outrageous suggestions would come out on top, such as Celestina Warbeck song titles, or the one that…what was it called? Ah yes, ‘Guilty Pleasures’.”
Potter shrugs sheepishly. “Well, you know. Parkinson is offering Bakewell tarts, Nott started playing Wizard’s Chess with Ron-”
Harry scrubbed his hand through his hair. “Is it just me or does it feel like we’ve made no progress at all lately?”
“My name’s Sky,” said the turquoise-haired girl and held up a fluffy towel. “Hold still.” She carefully dried his face and then wrapped the towel around Harry’s shoulders.
“Nothing to worry about, I have it under control,” Harry assured her and brought the broom down from the ceiling. He waited until Babs had turned back to Draco to give him a cheerful grin, because of course he was the one who’d sent Egbert up there to begin with.
Harold the Welcome Wizard gave him a cheerful wave. Draco responded with a tired smile as he walked past, but even that faded when he realized that he’d once again forgotten his recent resolution to avoid the reception area.
Potter opened his mouth and closed it. And then, he jumped out of his chair and bolted from Draco’s office as though chased by a herd of vicious centaurs.
Harry has yet another five glowing on his shirt, while Draco has a three and a seven, marking a tie between them. They are making their way towards the Great Hall for dinner, while back at the tent, some of the student volunteers cut the ombre cakes that are at least halfway decent and pass them out to the audience.
Potter was close to a grin now. Draco gave himself a mental pat on the back. Then he wondered why he cared so much.
“Circumstances worked in my favor. I heard from more than one student who saw Potter racing past with Malfoy, I only had to follow the track of blood. And then your apprentice came running up to me in the corridor.”
“Harry,” she said, looking upset, “you can’t possibly believe I don’t know you’re trying to keep me talking until the barrier comes down. I’m not a fool. I’m sorry, you’re a good person and I really am crushed I have to do this to you.
“Don’t worry, ma’am,” said Potter. Even though his face was not his own at the moment, there was no mistaking the earnest look. “We’re going to take care of it.”
“Wait, we weren’t supposed to know about this? Oh no,” Hermione said with a gasp, looking horrified. “I should have pretended I didn’t know what Molly was talking about when she asked me whether Draco and you would finally get married next year. Harry, I’m so sorry.”
“That sounds like the Ministry I know,” said Potter. He frowned and pointed to a different wall. “There was that shelf with the time-turners too, the one that got caught up in an endless loop of breaking and unbreaking.”
Draco was about to take the card back and let it go, but then he glanced Potter’s way and realized that one corner of his mouth was quirking up, and, hell, Potter could use a little cheering up.
She rolled her eyes. “Thanks. It hasn’t really sunk in. Frankly, it’s not my biggest worry right now; I’ll process it when I have the time to.”
“Anyway,” Finnegan piped up, sounding decidedly more cheerful, “as Dean said, we were wondering if you'd like to join us for a friendly game of Quidditch. We've got seven people together, two keepers, five chasers, need one more to make the teams full. What do you say?”
Draco shook his head. He certainly wasn't in a partying mood. The only reason he was here at all was because Pansy and Blaise had bullied him into it. Not that they bought into the whole inter-house unity project any more than he did, but they knew better than to stick out these days. Keeping your head down was the new Slytherin mode of operation, which was why Draco wasn't entirely comfortable with receiving attention from Harry all of a sudden. But he knew better than to say so.
“Lovely old lady,” Blaise added. “Cute as a button. Fun to flirt with, though a bit naïve and hard of hearing.”
“Oh yes, very. Poor Hubert barely had any bristles left, we had to retire him recently. Egbert here has proven
“Honestly.” Ermintrude shook her head. “Maybe you’re the one who is getting to be hard of hearing, my dear.”
Draco sighs, because for the first time he has something of an idea what Granger has to put up with at all times. Potter is lucky he’s got charm and fame. “If we can trace the path that the infection has taken, we might be able to determine its origin. That is the whole
The owl landed in front of him two days later, perching precariously on his goblet and preventing him from taking the sip he’d meant to. He gripped the stem hard and scrutinized the fluffy little thing. It had a note tied to one leg and a small box to the other, and it would barely hold still long enough for him to get both of these untied.
“Suppose you might even understand, to some degree.” She looked at Harry, then Draco, making a sound of bleak amusement.
Blaise took out a bottle of gin next and rolled his eyes. "Yes, Draco, as evidenced by the fact that he didn’t act surprised to see me and then also said, ‘Oh, good, you're here’."
“I appreciate that you all want to help, but I can’t just let you mess around with an active investigation,” said Parvati.
“Merlin,” Draco said much later when they were lying in bed and catching their breaths, the air cool against their sweat-slicked skin. “I am so fucking glad you came to your senses.”
“I’ve scanned all the layers of the skin and the muscles beneath with three different spells. None of them show an unusually high concentration of poison damage in one area, so it can’t have been a contact poison, and the few scratches Orval has are nowhere near big enough to deliver a large enough amount of the poison even if he’d bathed in it, so it’s not subcutaneous either. He doesn’t have any injuries that go deeper than that, so it can’t have been intravenous. That would be unlikely anyway, unless we’re talking about a muggleborn with medical training.”
“Well,” Babs said and jabbed a needle in the side of his neck for a second time, “yes. Very jumpy, she was. Shivered dreadfully toward the end, poor dear, but you’ll be happy to hear that I did not catch Mumblemumps from her.”
“That’s nice,” Draco said absently, and then, “Oh for fuck’s sake, there is another one. You must have really impressed these people.”
Harry stood near her, helplessly. The last thing he saw before the curtains around the bed were closed was Madam Pomfrey’s agitated face and Malfoy’s seemingly lifeless body as they extracted him from Harry’s cloak.
There was a choking noise. Draco blinked and realized that Clearwater, instead of gloating or going on pretending her actions had been justified, had staggered back and was now pressing her hand against her chest as a shiver ran through her.
“Why don’t you three start pulling a few crackers while I assemble the deserts?” Hermione suggested and raised her wand. “Someone monitor the noise-dampening charm though, please. I am
“If she wasn’t, and if it wasn’t for this stupid message on my arm, I wouldn’t see a problem with having her and Blaise take us down here and search the place, now that he knows anyway. But I’m not risking it, especially when we know that something
“Or Ron,” Harry pointed out. “Problem is that there’s no guarantee she hasn’t dosed the the whole bloody Auror department as well, or anyone else who’s likely to come after her.”
After another cake that has somewhat sad-looking daisies blooming and closing again, it’s Harry’s turn.
But when he ripped away the last of the wrapping, his breath caught, and he realised that he’d misunderstood, because this was by the same artist who had done Draco’s other painting. The style was unmistakable. This one showed what Draco thought might be the same blond man who’d been in the other one, but in a much different pose, something that seemed…coy. It was difficult to tell because the style didn’t lend itself to figuring out details, but Draco just got that sort of feeling from it, as though the artist had communicated through more than just the subject’s pose itself. It was the same thing that had drawn Draco to the first painting, the way that the painting spoke so much louder than just a regular picture might. He loved it immediately.
“No, nothing like that.” Harry frowned and looked out of the raindrop-covered window to his right. There was nothing but darkness beyond his reflection. “It seems a bit ridiculous now.”
Ordinary stasis charms had limitations. They held once cast, and they froze most of the body’s processes, but others they only slowed, and that hindered some poisons more than others. Even with stasis charms, Draco’s work was often a race against time.
“Yes,” Sky said. “But don’t ask me how to go about doing that, I just work on a bus. If you don’t mind, I have a question for you now though. How come you’re wanting a round trip? Not very many people like to ride the Knight Bus for the fun of it, oddly enough.”
“Me too, but I’m worried I’ve overlooked something obvious. I can only do this once, Briar said he’d bury his brother as soon as I was done. I don’t plan to take up grave robbing.”
Grabbing the bottle and glasses didn’t take him very long, but he did take the time to dig through his cupboards for some kind of snack to go with the wine. When he finally returned, bottle in hand and shooing everything else ahead of him with his wand, Blaise was standing there with an ominous look on his face, arms crossed.
“Is there a rhyme or reason for placing those as you did?” Blaise asked. “The green ones, I mean. Obviously, they’re not following the same pattern as the other two.”
Maybe part of him also wanted to draw out the time until he had to leave for good. Draco wondered if it could still be considered a subconscious act if you kind-of-sort-of knew you were doing it.
They emerged in the Three Broomsticks and from there stepped out into the picturesquely snow-covered village. The air was crisp and clear, with a uniformly blue sky overhead, and it was easy to see an equally snow-covered Hogwarts from here. The sight caused a pang of longing in Draco’s chest. He hadn’t been back in far too long. Apart from his work at the St Mungo’s he didn’t have much of a life at all, and there had never been a good reason for him to visit. The closest he got was the occasional Floo conversation with Poppy Pomfrey, on the exceedingly rare occasion when there was a student on his floor she wanted to check in on, or if she needed a consultation on anything potions-related.
. It could have been any number of couples with contrasting hair colours that the painting might have portrayed, but every glance made Draco feel warm all over and had his mind shouting
“Stanislaus would have been in possession of her notes until he died, and afterwards they would have been inherited by some family member or another. If Clearwater
“I look every night before bed,” Harry said, “but I haven’t found anything yet. I’ll let you know the moment I do. I still wonder why I felt the need to make it all so vague, it’s bloody annoying.”
“Fuck,” Draco said succinctly and started taking his gloves off. He had felt frustrated and short-tempered since the morning, and it was only getting worse. The autopsy hadn’t helped a lick. “How the hell is it so well-distributed? It shouldn’t be possible; it just doesn’t fit.”
Harry tilted his head, as if to concede the point. Then he sighed and climbed to his feet and put his hand on Draco's shoulder.
“Generally, yes, but there are exceptions. I would wager a guess that the Selwyn family attached some condition to the inheritance – that he has to get married first, for example.” Draco once again checked the parchment strip on which Parvati had scrawled an address. “This can’t be right; we should have passed it by now.”
“Well,” he said, faltering. That’s what he got for keeping that stupid message’s advice in the back of his mind. “You don’t have to, obviously, but I barely ever have anyone over, and it might not be a bad idea for you to be around a healer for a little while longer, just in case.”
They reached Versatile Vials on a side street, and before they entered, Blaise took care to make sure his Ministry badge was on full display. Granger had promised to get Draco a consultant badge as soon as she had the time, in case his being at the ministry was ever questioned. For now, he still wore the visitor’s badge he had been issued the day before – which, to Draco’s endless amusement, proclaimed him to be
That night, Draco had another nightmare. It was all cackling laughter, pairs of eyes following him, a high, cold voice in his ears as he ran through the dark manor in search of the exit. Nowhere was safe any longer, not when they were watching his every step, waiting for him to fail and be punished some more. His aunt, gleefully telling him she couldn't wait to
“A candy cane that’s shaped like a ‘W’.” Hermione rolled her eyes. “Let’s try it, come on. Everyone take one and name a Christmas carol!”
“And she said to tell you that Zabini is rather upset with you. And I talked to Parvati as well, she gave me a few more facts that should help us.”
"No!" Harry holds his hands up in a calming manner, though it seems to have the opposite effect. "I mean yes, but not… I didn't poison Jefferies on purpose. That was an accident. And I was made to take your seminar. Didn't have much choice in the matter, honestly, though you're really good at teaching. Like, shockingly good at it. But I
"Malfoy?" His green eyes are unfocused, and his glasses have a jagged crack down the middle of one lens. "What're you doing here? Am I dreaming?"
Harry had rarely thought of Godric's Hollow as a nice place. There was nothing bad about the town. It was quaint, in a picturesque, postcard sort of way. The people who lived there were lovely, even the old man at the end of the high street who liked to talk about Muggle politics to anyone who'll listen. Even the memorial didn't bother Harry that much, not anymore, though he hadn't yet grown used to seeing his father's face when he walked past it on his way to work and home again.
Harry hums quietly to himself and continues to touch Draco's cock with feather-light strokes. Just barely-there presses of skin against skin that make the breath catch in Draco's lungs. It's not long before he feels his orgasm tightening in his stomach, but before he can warn Harry, Harry's already pulled away.
Harry speeds up his strokes. He knows he doesn't have to come now. He's won. The point is his. But as he watches Malfoy's eyes open slowly, as if he's barely able to find the energy to do so, and Malfoy's cock drools more come onto his skin, Harry can't hold it back.
Weasley steps in, and Draco immediately knows that his day is about to become complicated. The man's hair is wet, but judging by the bits of snow and frost clinging to the curling ends, it's not from the rainstorm outside. He steps inside with a full-body shiver and a groan.
"You're a bloody idiot if you don't think she will." Harry squeezes Ron tight enough to crack his back, then lets him go to grab at his shoulders instead. "Oh my God, you're going to marry Hermione."
"I'd burned down everything else in my life that mattered." Draco held the cigarette out to Harry, placed it in the part of his lips. "I figured why not me as well?"
Harry steps out of his trousers and throws them in the direction of his bed. "You'd think with the goal of this game, you wouldn't want to do what you prefer."
But Harry's eighteen, not-entirely-straight, and currently surrounded by other men with their hands around hard cocks. He can't help but start to get into it a bit.
Of course, the rest of the day ends up feeling like sitting on the surface of the sun. The blue sky of their window is a taunting thing, the ripples on the fake Thames hinted at a breeze that is nowhere to be found within the confines of the room. Potter tries casting a Cooling Charm, but all it does is freeze the sweat on his skin, which melts a moment later. Potter Transfigures a teacup into a pitcher, casts his cooling charm on that instead, and they at least are able to have some cold water to drink as they swelter.
Rather than holding back, Draco fills the small safe house with moans and panted curses. His fingers rests gently on the top of Harry's head, and he can't stop the praise from pouring out of his mouth.
"Get fucked, Malfoy," she says, nose in the air. Her superior mein is ruined by the sneeze that rockets out of her. "Salazar, I hate this."
Greyback growls, and Harry hears the table crack as the werewolf digs his claws into the wood. "You dare talk to me like that, boy? I'll crush your neck with my teeth and laugh as you choke on your own blood."
Draco smirks. "There are more things in heaven and earth, Harold, than are dreamt of in your vacuum of a skull."
His hand shaking, Lucius reaches into his robe and withdraws a golden key. It's ornately decorated, and when Harry looks back to his wrists as the room's attention turns to him, he sees that it matches the decorations on his manacles.
