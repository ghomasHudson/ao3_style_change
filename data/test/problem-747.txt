The war hadn’t helped matters, of course, but there wasn’t anything stopping him now. Right? He'd turned his life around while in America, working hard to get to where he was now. Nothing influenced the circumstances -- not his last name or the bullying around he did in school. His skill and patience with the wood he worked with elevated him to the position he now held. Surely Potter would see it that way.
He was already tired of the question even though she had only asked it twice now. Once when she came in from the treasure hunt to find Draco gone, and now -- two days after Draco left. Harry could practically feel James staring at his back as he tried to think of a good answer to his daughter’s question. James and Albus might be old enough to really understand what had happened, but Lily was different. She still believed everything would always work out and Harry wanted her to have that magic for as long as possible.
“Today was a good day,” Draco said as soon as he shut the boys’ bedroom door. “Why don’t we visit them more often?”
Harry hesitated, looking down at his shoes. How could he answer that without giving anything away? Because a real husband probably would have been kissing Draco every day. A real husband would be touching him and making sure he was loved.
It had been the friendliest place Harry had ever been to and that made him love it more than anything. Sure, the school was in the next town over and if he needed anything specific he had to drive nearly an hour out of his way, but he didn’t care.
So Harry abused the fact that they had let it slip just where that location was and found himself appearing just inside the wards of the grounds. He stared at the intimidating manor, not sure whether or not he actually wanted Draco to be inside or not.
“Yes, you.” Draco stood in front of him. “Maybe you don’t want him to come around because you don’t want to see me.”
“Yeah, sorry.” Harry sat on his side of the bed.
Draco wrinkled his nose before following Harry out of the truck and toward the wrap-around porch that squeaked as they walked on it. “I don’t remember ever seeing this place.”
“Jasmine? No, she’s a runner that one. Besides, her mum is some hot-shot in the city and I wouldn’t want to get that much attention. If I get arrested and accidentally do wandless spells, we might have the second witch hunt start. I didn’t save the wizarding world to destroy it not a decade later.”
“It’s just a bed, don’t worry about it.” Draco signed his name before bending over to blow gently on the ink.
“Yes, Draco, we’re married.”
“I can’t offer my best friend some tea?”
Harry found himself in the doorway of their -- no,
“That’s because you have amnesia.” Harry opened the door, the wards recognizing him. He’d need to key Draco into them. “It’s okay. The doctor said familiar things should help and you can’t get more familiar than home.”
.” Drew laughed, nudging Harry with his foot. “I thought you were supposed to be getting back at him?”
“Draco.” Harry reached out to take his wrist. “Come on, you love the couch.”
“You are far too interested in my love life.” He toed off his shoes before brushing past her. “It was a business deal, nothing else happened.”
“We did,” Harry agreed, eyes locked with the blond’s own. “Having you with me in Elk Cove showed me what could have happened if I took your hand in first year. Maybe... maybe I would have fallen for you instead of Ginny.” Harry took a chance and stepped closer. “Maybe you and I would have adopted some children to raise. To care for.”
A frown crossed the delicate features. “Apologize?”
showing up, but ... well, kids you know.”
meeting in the future -- he would rather have something more solid to work with, but he knew when not to push his luck and this was it. So he bid Potter a farewell and forced himself to take the short walk back to the Apparition point.
Potter tilted his head a bit so he could see the notepad. “It does -- I like it. Are you positive this is what you want?”
Harry watched the couple leave before turning back to the television just as a story about an amnesiac came up. It took him a moment to realize that the person they were showing on the screen was
“What about the other legs?”
“As she does every day,” Peter said before holding up his mug. “Could do with some more joe.”
“Babe, the kids are missing you like crazy. Don’t you want to see them again?”
Draco didn’t say anything in return. He tried to fluff the pillow a bit before settling down, pulling the quilt completely over himself to hide. Harry watched the lump that was his school rival for a moment before heading back upstairs to hide as well.
By the time the next day rolled around, Harry had mostly succeeded in pushing away the fact  that Malfoy was around. Between fixing the fridge, and then making sure his kids had their homework done and their rooms clean, his mind had luckily been too focused on his own life to worry much about anything else. He kissed the kids goodbye at their school before making his way to the local bar where he helped out whenever he could and didn’t have any other work to do.
Already in the driver’s side, seat belt tightly across his chest, Draco sat with his hands gripping the wheel until his knuckles turned white. Harry debated just asking him to move over, but didn’t want to start a fight; he got in the passenger side and leaned over to turn the key.
“More than okay.” Draco pulled out his sketchbook and leaned toward Teddy. “I hear you’re in the market for a new bed.”
Harry built over the past few weeks was going to stop, it was going to explode in his face.
“I’m sorry,” he said instead, nervous as Draco’s expression didn’t change from the muted disappointment he had been showing when he arrived. “I came here to apologize for what happened since you left before I could.” He hesitated. “Well, you left without letting me, I guess.”
A door led from the kitchen to the backyard and Draco looked through the dirty pane, face still disgusted. The yard had been Ginny’s specialty and Harry couldn’t bring himself to do too much to it, especially after he had spent so much time in his Aunt’s garden as a kid. It was the one aspect of his adult life that he really didn’t enjoy and it showed.
Draco leaned against the counter, quiet after Harry’s declaration. It was only after Harry put in the roast to warm that he looked over at the other man and realized what he had said. Continuing the Malfoy line had been something Draco bragged about for years in school. And even as out of the loop to Pureblood traditions as Harry was, even he knew how important carrying on your lineage was.
“You’re eleven,” Harry said, exasperated. “You don’t understand everything that’s going on.”
So, ignoring anything further Malfoy had to say, Harry took out his keys and slipped into the truck they had purchased when first coming to town. The now rusted-red paint gave away its age, but Harry’s neighbor made sure to keep it in top condition for him. He didn’t dare look up to see Malfoy’s expression as he left.
“You,” Potter snapped out, though he looked surprised he had done so. At Draco’s raised eyebrow, he seemed to gather his famous Gryffindor courage around him and straighten his back. “I don’t want him around influences like you and Parkinson.”
“Good, then let’s talk business.”
Harry looked to the wall, racing to find yet another excuse. “Oh, well. You hate how your pictures come out and don’t like me to display them.”
“I am. Now, all right, Teddy, what were you thinking?” he asked, ignoring Potter for the moment.
“...Of course, right.” Harry nodded and followed her through the front door, feeling like a teenager being scolded. “Thank you.”
“I said maybe...”
Lily closed her mouth finally before making the motion of zipping her lips closed. “I always wanted another daddy.”
-- bedroom. Draco looked up from the dresser, wand in hand. “Are you really going to try to stop me?” he asked, fingers tightening around the wood.
Harry froze. He hadn’t thought about Ginny in a while and he wasn’t quite sure what to make of that.
“Shut up, don’t judge me.” Draco leaned his head back. “I want a lemon cake and we’re going to get one.”
“Spoil-sport.”
Draco scowled at Harry before pushing past him and going for the stairs near the entrance. Harry rolled his eyes and followed; nobody but himself had to know just how attractive Draco’s ass was as they went up the stairs.
“Where have you been?” Harry asked after setting down his juice.
“Some time after I moved to the States. I don’t much remember when, but the community I moved to blurred the lines more than we do here.” Draco eased forward to put his cup by the bench leg. “You learn quite a bit living next to them.”
They both stopped. Draco’s hands dropped to his sides and he refused to look at Harry, worrying at his lower lip. Harry stood, chair scraping against the floor, and tried to move closer to the other man. When Draco took a small step back, Harry stopped and let out a sigh.
“Yes,” Draco agreed, “we should really do this more often. Maybe next time you can come to ours?”
“It was difficult at first, but I do enjoy it.” Draco pulled his hands back, a little surprised Potter hadn’t asked if he was actually good at it. “My pieces are all custom order. I like to do carvings catered to the person buying. It’s why Pansy’s letting me stay with her.”
Lily poked her head out, one eye open. “Daddy...”
-----
“Don’t you two have homework or something?” Harry asked as he sat back down.
“Oi, Potter!”
Harry reached over to squeeze James’ hand. “I won’t let him be upset. There’s nothing to be upset about.”
for a moment. Draco and Lily were in town looking for some kind of doll she wanted, and he could hear the boys calling to each other outside, so there was nothing to worry about.
“The first room on the right is our daughter’s and the second is the boys’ room. The left is the kids’ bathroom and then my... our room.”
Draco eyed the cup suspiciously before reaching up to take it. “Are you serious right now, Pansy?”
The story always ended in two ways, depending on who you talked to. The romantics claimed that the rich woman fell in love with the angry carpenter and they stayed together even after she regained her memories. The realists’ story ended with the angry carpenter in jail and the woman returned to her true husband. Drew was, of course, a romantic so he had winked at Harry and told him not to fall in love.
Molly had been surprised when Harry showed up on her doorstep with the three kids, but thankfully she had  asked no questions. She simply pressed a kiss to Harry’s temple and told him to go do whatever it was he had to do -- the kids would be safe. He had no question about that as it was, but he appreciated the promise all the same. She may have only met his children a few times, but she was Grandma Molly and they would feel comfortable staying with her while Harry tried to get his life back.
“Sounds good.” Harry got up to put his plate and silverware near the kitchen window. “I might give him a call later. My fridge broke yesterday morning.”
Teddy nodded, grasping Potter’s hand. “Can we get it? Can we?”
The blond’s hair had dirt streaks and his clothes not nearly as clean as Harry came to expect. Draco’s hands, deep within the dirt in the flowerbeds, were no longer pristine and pale. Seeing him there, weeding and what looked to be replanting, Harry felt something in his heart constrict. The stray thought that he could get used to coming home to this view scared him.
“I got it,” Draco said, voice sharp. “I was... I just...”
“Sometimes I forget she was a Black. No offense, but your family tree confuses me.”
“Of course, of course.” Harry gave him a small wave before disappearing back to where the part he needed was.
“Maybe,” James agreed before standing, “but I still think you can get him back.”
“Yes, ma’am.” Harry hesitated before reaching for his own cup. “I came to apologize and to... to tell him that not everything was a fantasy created by the situation.”
“But--”
“I didn’t want to push you,” he said, hoping the explanation would be enough.
Draco scoffed and came over to pat down Harry’s pockets. “Just--”
“Is it?” Lily sat up on her knees. “Why?”
“I’m used to her by now, but tinker away if you want to.” Ashley poured a glass of juice and set it down at a spot at the bar. “But after you eat.”
Harry looked down at his feet, hand gripping tight to the handrail beside him. “I--”
-----
“Sorry,” Potter said, running a hand through Teddy’s hair. “We tried to talk about what he wanted
He rolled his shoulders, trying to get himself to get over whatever was going on in his head. Potter was just a man, just another potential person to put money in his pocket, and that was how he needed to think about this.
? There was no way Potter was going to invite him to sit now, not with the crass way he was acting.
to -- that would just mean the kids were that much closer to leaving the house, and him, behind. “Yeah, maybe. Town’s to the left.”
“I thought Hogwarts was behind the times,” Malfoy said, drawing Harry out of his thoughts. “Has this place changed at all since it was built hundreds of years ago?”
Draco watched Pansy leave the room, keeping the smile on his face as she left. Hopefully, talk of furniture would keep her occupied for some time.
to say goodbye.
“No, you listen while I talk right now.” Draco finally made it to the top, standing in front of him. “The Golden Boy isn’t so golden after all. Is that why you came here to hide? Is that why you disappeared?”
“They don’t look like me,” Draco said as soon as the kids were out of earshot. “How can they be my kids?”
here so I’m hoping you didn’t leave them with Drew. I know you like the man, but he teaches James the worst sort of things and I won’t have my-- mmph-”
He had to tell Draco the truth.
It sounded like a large piece of bullshit, but Harry was too far to back out now. Ginny would be laughing at him, he was sure of it. Albus knew it was a load of crap, too, but he nodded and looked out the window, essentially ending the conversation. Harry held back a sigh as he started the truck.
eyes widened just slightly. If they were ‘married,’ then Harry needed to stop thinking of him as Malfoy. The doctor mentioned something about getting the release paperwork before leaving them alone in the room with a nurse. Harry tried not to show how awkward he felt.
“Will you be joining me?” Draco asked with a leer.
“Hm.” Draco leaned back. “Is it because I used to bully you in school or because I used to be a Death Eater that has you pause?”
“Bippy is here, sir,” the elf said as soon as it came in.
“And our treasure is in the forest,” Albus added. “Papa said he hid something out there!”
Draco rolled his eyes and went back to his work. “Which one of us is in charge of the gardens?”
His moment of quiet finished, Harry flipped through the letters that had arrived. Molly Weasley’s monthly letter felt thicker than usual; he put that off to the side to read later. She tended to write novels about her grandchildren. Next was a note from Gringotts regarding his finances and other various affairs the goblins looked over for him. Harry hadn’t opened one of those in years and today was no different -- he tossed it straight to the fire.
that so much. The only question was would Draco even let him try?
Draco didn’t really have it, but the jerking of the truck was better than a quick run into the house. Harry was glad their house was some distance away from most others as that would give Draco a chance to really get a hold of the truck before they met too many other cars. Surprisingly, it didn’t take him that long to get the hang of how much pressure to put on the gas pedal. He had been one of the smartest in their year, Harry recalled.
Before she could answer, the fireplace burned bright green, signaling the arrival of someone. Draco stumbled out of the fireplace, hair in disarray and robes lopsided on his shoulders. Harry’s eyes widened and he could do nothing but stare as Draco brushed himself off, the blond not even realizing they were in the room as he called a house elf.
“Draco...”
For a second, an embarrassing second, Draco actually believed him. But the twitch of mischief in Potter’s eye had him snorting and looking out over the playground. “Nice, Potter. I suggest that girl in the sand, then. She hasn’t moved since I walked up. Easier to handle if she’s that easy to entertain.”
“You worry too much,” he said, voice muffled against Harry’s shoulder.
“Thanks, Malfoy,” Potter interrupted, closing his eyes as he breathed in the scent. “Honeysuckle?”
Harry stood as Draco finally realized he was in the room. They stared at each other in silence and Harry barely noticed when Narcissa slipped out of the room, leaving them alone.
Draco nodded, hands easing on the wheel the further they drove. “How do you do the... the clicky-thing?”
Harry looked down at the wedding band he had been spinning around his finger. The band Ginny had put there the day they married. The band Draco had thought he put on Harry’s finger. No. No, he didn’t want to court Draco, he wanted to marry him. He
“You’re
“Albus,” Draco repeated with a nod. “He doesn’t like me? Why?”
The front door jingled open at that point, announcing Pansy’s arrival home. Bells over her entryway doors were, according to her, a way to ward off unwanted faeries. Draco figured it was her own kind of warning system just in case.
Draco jerked to the side so he could give Harry a disgusting look. “You want to eat
Unimpressed, Draco pushed the tour along and into the kitchen. Because the fridge had been out, it was the cleanest room in the house. Since he already cleaned the fridge as well as any counters the old food touched, Harry had gone ahead and just did the whole room. The cabinets weren’t perfect, a few doors hung crooked, but at least the counters were clear of dishes and food.
Eventually.
Draco blew him a kiss before motioning toward the leg closest to Harry. “I put a deer and a doe on there. For your parents.”
alone time.”
“Two weeks is fine, I’m sure.” Potter smiled at Teddy. “Right?”
and you’re being a complete dick.” Harry went back to the food, a frown on his face.
“Husband?
“Enough to do it for real?” Harry pulled back enough to look at Draco, heart beating loudly in his chest. “Draco Malfoy, will you marry me?”
“Are you calling me a
“That shouldn’t be nec--”
“Gi-... Ah, we switch sometimes. I think it was my turn.”
“No,” Pansy said with a pout, settling on the opposite end of the sofa, feet curled up beneath her. “Were you always this dense?”
Malfoy’s smug smile returned. “Don’t you know? I’m an expert cartographer and was sent on assignment to further our knowledge of the American Northwest. This... charming town just happened to be my next stop.”
The door opened and Lily ran inside, a new doll clutched in her hands. Harry barely heard her hello as she raced upstairs. He was too busy staring at Draco, his wind-swept hair almost messier than Harry’s own. Before Harry could attempt to explain anything, Draco turned toward him and gave Harry a wide smile. The kiss that came next filled his heart with warmth and, if anything, that made Harry panic more.
What looked like panic flashed through Draco’s eyes, though he held it in. “I don’t believe you.”
“It’s nothing personal,” Potter said quickly. “I swear, I just... I’m protective of him.”
Harry laughed as Ashley packed the bread into a pan. “Sorry, no can do. Ready to go home?”
He was sure Ginny would have laughed and told him to “Just go for it, Harry.”
“Thanks, mate. Draco and I should get the kids home, though. School tomorrow.”
“Because today you and your brothers are going to eat both breakfast
“I don’t understand.”
“I’ll make sure of it,” Potter promised. “Go and play while I finish up here, okay?”
The only thought in Harry’s mind was
“It’s true,” Harry insisted. “You haven’t been in my... in our bed in weeks. Who's to say that it’ll be familiar to you?”
“Malfoy?” he finally asked, seeming to come to his senses. “Merlin, is it really you?”
His neighbor Drew owned the place and invited Harry to work there when he saw a slight lull in Harry’s handyman job. It started with Harry simply fixing up things around the bar and then extended to covering for any sick or personal leave of the rest of the staff. As it was during school hours, there wasn’t all that much for Harry to do that day besides help make baked goods that could last the week or fix any loose screws in the chairs.
All he could do was nod, not sure if Draco would even let him speak.
“If I had my wand, I could just send them a hex if they aren’t,” Draco sing-songed before disappearing up the stairs.
The bird leaned a bit away from James but didn’t fly off when his eldest ran his own fingers across the feathers. Once it finished all the treats Albus brought, he let out a screech and took off; Harry ignored the scratches left behind. They would heal.
-----
Harry settled the leftovers Ashley had given him on the stove before putting his hands on Draco’s shoulders. “Hey, come on. I know you don’t remember them, but that was uncalled for.”
“Enough,” Harry told them, standing and holding out his arm. “You can’t demand things from the owls, okay? I thought we went over this before.”
Draco put a hand on his chest in mock surprise. “
A fact he would never admit to their faces.
“Dad?”
“I just didn’t want him to bother you.”
Harry lifted a hand, fingers spread. “I’ll do it...”
“Good morning,” Draco told them both, sitting next to them. “I’m glad I could help you with the new bed.”
Whatever his professional relationship with Potter, Pansy didn’t need to know. Or Draco didn’t want her to know because she would be able to see right through him eventually. There was no telling whether or not she’d also stick her nose into his business and tell Potter about his ridiculous crush.
“Yeah, and it falls apart fast, right?” Draco wished he had some pictures on him to show Potter. Maybe next time? “No, this is made the old-fashion way. Everything is done by hand.”
Three years and it hadn’t really gotten easier.
-----
“I’m fine,” Harry said quickly, looking away. “I just... nap. You and Lily scared me.” Coward.
“Found one. I’ll talk to the kids, make sure they don’t steal the pillow again.” Harry dropped the pillow on the couch. “All set.”
Ginny was laughing at him, Harry was sure of it. He licked his lips before stepping closer, all but pinning Draco against the door frame. Draco’s eyes widened just slightly before fluttering closed as Harry leaned in. Their breath mingled for a moment while Harry debated just backing away, but Draco took that choice from him and surged forward.
Harry gripped the letter tightly, trying to remember how to breathe. They were looking for Draco. They were looking and by this point, the town knew about him and where he lived. The false sense of
“When is Papa coming back?”
Harry shivered, unable to help but lean forward and give Draco a kiss. He forced himself to keep it short or he would drag Draco off into the bedroom and damn the consequences. “Merlin, Draco...”
“...and that’s why we have to work hard to pretend Draco is your papa,” Harry said, hands gripping the steering wheel tight. The silence in the backseat grew uncomfortable to the point where Harry had to turn to make sure he didn’t forget to pick up his youngest two. Sure enough, Albus and Lily stared at him with wide eyes and open mouths.
Draco held out his hands, well calloused over from the labor. “Honestly, the absolute look of horror from my father when he learned of my trade made the pain worth it.”
Potter scoffed, though there was a tint of pink to his cheeks. “That’s absurd. I never said--”
be here as well.” Draco took a seat after putting the cups down at the table. “What’s this really about?”
It wasn’t often that Harry felt the pang of missing Ron and while he felt it now, he was also glad that it was Drew sitting there and not his brother-in-law. Ron would never understand what happened here, especially not since the other person was Draco. Harry shook the thought away and reached out to clasp Drew’s hand.
“I appreciate it.” Harry gave Drew one last smile before heading into the kitchen and coming up behind Draco. He gently rested his hands on the blond’s hips and leaned over, resting his chin on Draco’s shoulder. “Can I eat it now?”
Draco hardly minded when people watched, but he didn’t want to go against what Potter said. “A lot of the work is dangerous, so your uncle is right. Maybe I can send pictures?”
“A potential customer.”
“You know how it is with schedules.” Harry tucked a stray bit of hair behind Draco’s ear. “We should get some sleep, too.”
“Go tell James what’s going on, and I’ll get the keys.”
“How long have you been out here?” he asked, catching Draco’s attention. “Your neck is red.”
“Did you really think this would work?” he asked, his movements slow. Harry’s heart cracked every time Draco’s foot reached another step. “When you decided to take me into your home, introduce me to your children? When was the point where you really thought I would want to be here with
He wanted that, he wanted to
Elk Cove. I liked waking up next to your ridiculous bed head. I liked watching you fix things around the house and teach James things that he could still do despite being a squib. I liked how you wouldn’t let Albus or Lily make him uncomfortable, yet you still let them grow and be joyful with their own magic. I liked being
Lily was already asleep by the time they reached the house, so Harry carried her upstairs and put her to bed while Draco took the boys. The entire thing felt way too easy -- the two of them working together as parents. With Lily tucked away with her stuffed elephant, and the boys drifting off in their own beds, Harry didn’t want it to end. This domestic bliss he found. And that terrified him.
“Is that the guy who followed you out of Howard’s?” At Harry’s look, Drew held up his hands. “Word travels fast.”
Harry watched as Draco trailed off, eyes staring at something in the distance. “Left it?” When Draco didn’t answer, Harry grew worried. “Draco...?”
-----
“Potter.” Draco wrapped his hands around his cup. “I am running on very little sleep, so my patience for bullshit is thin. What’s the real reason?”
Once Teddy ran off to jump on the jungle gym, Draco put the notepad on the bench and tried to give Potter a smile. “Honestly I don’t mind if he watches. People used to in Boston.”
The footboard of the bed would focus on Teddy’s father, Remus Lupin. Draco had fond memories of his once-professor despite the fear of the man’s beastly side. He noticed Potter’s concerned look when Teddy first brought it up, but he ignored it and focused on creating a werewolf running through a vast forest, tongue hanging out of its mouth.
“Dad’s right here,” Harry muttered before closing his book and watching his eldest try to coax the owl closer. “Do you have the treats?”
Harry wanted to argue, wanted to stay where they were and pretend nothing bad was happening. But he knew better than to argue in front of his children. “I’ll have James come out just in case.”
Harry nodded. “Yeah, figured we’d grab them on the way to the truck. Thank you for dinner, Ash, it was lovely.”
He needed an excuse,
It was barely a whisper, but the way Draco said his name made Harry’s heart break. It wasn’t the teasing way he had been saying it around the house, but the low, disgusted way he said it during school. Harry leaned back as Draco’s eyes narrowed.
Teddy brightened at the promise. “Really?”
“Oh, please. From what I hear, he all but stalked you through school and never did anything more than give a girl a
“Draco...”
-----
Harry could do nothing but watch as Albus led his very upset daughter out of the room and up the stairs. He ran a hand through his hair, tugging on it before finally focusing back on his eldest. James, leaned back in his chair, saying nothing until Harry arched an eyebrow at him.
His second surprise came from a knock on the front door. Sure, he put in for an order of Pansy’s requested wood, but he wasn’t expecting that for at least another two days. He wiped as much sawdust off his clothes as he could before making his way to the front door.
Draco shrugged. “Hachures don’t belong on treasure maps, apparently. If I had my tools, I could probably make a harder one when they’re older.”
Harry laughed and took a seat next to Draco, sliding the map closer. “A treasure hunt, hm? That sounds like a good way to spend our afternoon.”
The kids were easy to wrangle into the truck. James and Albus wanted to ride in the bed -- it was something Harry normally didn’t allow, but the ride would barely be five minutes back to the house, so he had relented. Draco placed strict instructions for them to stay seated and hold on and the two immediately agreed before climbing into the back.
James’ face fell and he stood. “Dad, are you okay?”
“Boundary survey,” Draco repeated before giving Harry a wide grin. “I had him establish a boundary line around the property so we don’t stray too far.”
“A cake?”
Draco tilted his head. “Push me? Harry, if I married you, I think I would have wanted you to push me.”
“That doesn’t seem like me.” Draco sat, then bounced a bit to get a feel for the old couch. “This seems extremely uncomfortable.”
). Teddy had taken it upon himself to try to imitate those around him perfectly.
children.”
Draco’s cheek flushed as they came to a stop at the sign. “We’ll see. Maybe we can afford to get another car by then.”
“At least not now,” Harry said and got under the covers as well. “Good night, Draco.”
He was so
Draco scoffed and crossed his arms. “I’m not leaving here with him.”
“We bullied each other,” Draco said softly, getting Harry’s attention.
Jules took one last sip of her coffee before standing. “Think if we leak that video of him covered in shit he might change?”
Harry flinched, unable to help himself. “Well, yeah, but--”
“It has,” Harry agreed. “We’ll get through this, okay? I promise.”
“Too many lines,” Lily said before grabbing another crayon. “Papa said they were hat-sures--”
from Draco. “No, but I really want to.”
Harry’s favorite couch, red and stained in places from the kids and cushions no longer soft, sat against the far windows while a television hung on the wall across from it. The purple rug Lily insisted they had to have needed a good vacuuming, but on it sat the oak coffee table Harry put together as a gift to Ginny. It was more a project to see how well he did with power tools, but it worked out well enough. The uneven legs were hardly noticeable.
Time passed faster than Harry wanted it to. Every day he came home, the house became a little tidier. A week and a half into the arrangement, Harry brought the kids home to dinner waiting on the table. While some of the food was bland, Harry had never expected Draco to actually cook them anything. Standing there, looking over the roast and vegetables, Harry couldn’t help but lean in and place a gentle kiss to Draco’s cheek. Dinner waiting for them became normal on weekdays after that.
“Rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated,” Draco quoted, remembering the line from some Muggle sci-fi film he managed to watch. He grinned at Potter’s shocked face. “Surprised?”
Albus tapped his pencil on the desk, frowning. “You said you could fix anything...”
Draco stopped and turned to give Harry a very unimpressed look. “What?”
“A favorite of mine,” Draco admitted.
“Thank you.” Harry was just glad that this wasn’t the same hospital Ginny had given birth in or they would definitely question the records. Especially since Harry had to lie on most of Malfoy’s.
Potter arched an eyebrow, a smirk just barely visible on his face. “This is a kids' park, Draco.”
Watching Draco turn the wheel as if he had been doing it all his life, and Harry could see it. He could see Draco sliding into the passenger seat to teach James how to drive. He could see them putting aside money every month in a special fund until the day they brought one of the kids to the used car place in town. Hell, he could see Draco years from now, hairline receding, as they waved to Lily when she left to finally start her life.
He knew how to cook due to his childhood history, but there was something about Ashley’s breakfast that was just extra comforting. He had attempted to remake it several times for his kids but it always fell just short of the taste.
like me,” Draco hissed, glancing back to Lily’s tear-filled eyes. “They...”
Potter snorted. “
Protective and still didn’t trust a Slytherin, but Draco could work with Potter’s half-lie. “I don’t bite, I promise. Besides, Pansy changes her mind every other day so I have plenty of free time.”
“I’m not in any of the pictures.”
Draco shrugged, though he didn’t try to pull away as Harry thought he might. “It’s been a long day.”
“Don’t they have Americans to do this?” Harry interrupted, hoping to hold off the anger. “Why send you?”
Harry continued the tour into the small dining room. Toys and old school projects were piled on one side, leaving just barely enough room for the three chairs on the other side. He made sure to keep that clear so the kids could have a place to eat dinner. The kids’ artwork scattered across the pale walls -- not all of it on paper and some on the paint itself.
Harry arched an eyebrow. “Not a mommy?”
“I’ll talk to her, I promise.” Harry ruffled James’ hair. “Come on, you guys need to get ready for school. Go get Albus, I’ll get Lily.”
That had been new just yesterday, the odd flirtation from Draco. Harry hadn’t been sure how to handle it, but he couldn’t deny that Draco’s words made him blush every time. He never thought he could be gay or even bisexual, but something about the way Draco smiled as he teased did something to Harry’s heart.
-----
The war and its aftermath hadn’t been kind to Draco’s family. After a year of constant rejection, Draco packed his things and took the first opportunity he found to escape. Most of Europe was out of the question, so he took a chance on America -- Boston, to be exact. While the wizards in New England had known of the war, the old man he found a position with simply shrugged and made a comment about children and dumb choices. Not another word had been spoken about it since; Draco appreciated it more than anything else.
“Our next project,” Harry promised. “Now ease off the brake and then move your foot to the gas.”
“I know,” Harry agreed, defeated. “You can curse me. If it’ll make you feel better.”
-----
“Eyes on the road.” Harry couldn’t help but lean in and press a gentle kiss to Draco’s cheek. “Soon you’ll be good enough to teach the kids when they’re of age.”
She called out a hello and Draco tilted back in his chair. “Dining room, Pans!” he stated before returning his attention to the letter.
Harry cut off Draco’s words by dragging him into a kiss. Fingers gripped tight in Draco’s robes, Harry poured as much feeling as he could into kissing Draco Malfoy. Draco’s own hands came to wrap around Harry’s neck as the kiss softened. It wasn’t until Harry needed air that he broke away, leaning their foreheads together.
“I want to kiss my husband. Maybe it’ll spark something in me. You do remember telling me that familiar things will help, yes? So kiss me already, you coward.”
Drew rubbed at the back of his neck as he watched Ashley help Draco knead dough for the first time. The two of them laughed about something Harry couldn’t hear from their spot on in the living room, but as long as Draco kept smiling, he wasn’t going to worry too much about it. The look on his friend’s face, however, he was definitely going to worry about.
“Right, they said you didn’t remember anything.” Harry sighed before moving to sit in the chair next to the wall. He did slide it closer to the bed, though. “I’m Harry. We’ve been married for some time now and have three beautiful children.”
The handshake was all that Draco wanted it to be nearly two decades before: firm and full of promise. He let go reluctantly, watching as Potter gathered a boy with the same inky black hair before walking off in the opposite direction. Perhaps, he thought, he could make a stop by the park whenever he needed a break from work. It wasn’t far, after all.
Draco’s lips were chapped from being outside, but they were still softer than Harry expected. His hands came up to rest on Draco’s hips as he held the kiss, not sure why he didn’t just pull away as soon as it happened. He
James just nodded and silence reigned for the rest of the ride home.
excuse. “You can’t sleep in there.”
“Nobody but you cares about that anymore, trust me. I haven’t been asked to leave a shop in years.”
his work proudly displayed? A fleeting dream and Pansy was making it come true. Coming to England and designing her furniture would be worth whatever issues that cropped up while there.
Richard, an old man that liked to go fishing during the night, sold the freshest fish to anyone who wanted it in the morning. Drew was one of the few who actually woke up early enough to take advantage of it, though Harry had done so a few times himself. When Ginny had been pregnant with Lily, all she wanted was sushi.
Draco’s dirty hand flew up to press against the back of his neck where the afternoon sun beat on it. “I’m not sure? Is it bad?”
Harry tried to see it through his eyes, but all he really saw was Ginny’s favorite diner next to his favorite bookstore. Sure, the signs were a bit faded and not all of the street parking was marked correctly, but it was home. Howard’s Hardware didn’t even have a sign, but everyone in town knew where to find it. And if they didn’t, all they had to do was look confused and at least four people would step forward in an offer to help.
,” Harry lied, not wanting to give any further reasoning as to why his and Ginny’s kids didn’t look like Draco Bloody Malfoy. “We found out after James.”
Harry had to hold back the bit of laughter at the mental image of Draco realizing he got dirt on his clothes. “Sorry about him. That’s how he was when we met, but he changed over the years. Otherwise, we’d probably be in the city instead of here.”
Malfoy walked slowly up to him, making sure it was obvious he was looking over Harry’s state of being. “Merlin, how the mighty have fallen...”
“You’re right,” Potter agreed with a sigh. “No, you’re right. And honestly, my hesitation isn’t about who you were at all. I’m just... I’m protective about him is all. And it sounds like you have plenty of other work.”
“It’s temporary,” he promised the kids, “and he’s going to be very grumpy. Just be nice.”
Draco scoffed and rubbed at his leg. “We’re Slytherins, Pans. When do we ever admit to our feelings?”
Maybe the lie wasn’t a terrible idea. It would get Malfoy out of the hospital and Harry would have an easier time contacting somebody about the wizard. Putting on a soft smile, Harry approached the bed and rested his hands on the bar, letting the coolness of it ground him.
“You have alone time with me every night.”
Draco agreed and now he was on his way to meet with Potter and his godson. He debated doubling back to grab tea again, but decided against it at the last minute. It would just be delaying something he should not have been nervous about in the first place. It was just Potter, just another customer.
“See? Gentle.” Harry smiled, stroking the bird’s chest. “They’re smarter than you think.”
“What? No, that’s--”
Shit.
Draco closed his eyes. “I have to ask you for
-----
“We had breakfast, but tea is fine.” Potter hovered in the doorway of the kitchen. “Malfoy...”
“It looks great,” Harry said from the doorway, pulling Draco’s attention away from the dragon carefully carved into a leg. “How much longer until it’s done?”
Even without his memories, Draco was still a prick. Harry gave the nurse a small smile before leaving the room to fill out the necessary paperwork to take his new “husband” home. He was sure it would be fine, maybe. Hopefully.
“That’s okay, I know it’s a lot to take in.”
Harry held back the sigh that threatened to escape, wondering if he should just Owl Narcissa Malfoy and wash his hands of the mess. “I see your attitude has regressed back to when you were eleven,” he muttered instead.
“Potter, please don’t bullshit me,” Draco said, voice quiet. “I’ve spent eight years trying to be better than I was before. I don’t pretend what happened during sixth year never occurred and I am trying my best to prove I am not that scared child anymore.”
“I just said--”
Of course he did -- Drew explained it not even an hour ago. The story went that a traveling woman hired a local carpenter for a job on her yacht. When the job went south, she fired him with no pay and sent the angry man home. Later that night, she had fallen off the yacht and lost her memory. The angry carpenter took advantage of the situation and claimed she was his wife, taking her home to take care of his kids and clean his house.
Harry took the hand as he stood. “I’m just glad you found my husband. I didn’t want to worry the kids, so I planned on heading out to the station today and it was luck that I saw the news when I did.”
“Go,” Harry said again, waving him off before washing his hands in the sink. “Make sure the kids are doing their homework while you’re up there.”
Harry shook his head. “He’s remembered. Can you distract Albus and Lily?”
“I can’t fix it,” Harry told his children after Lily settled into her chair. “He didn’t belong here and he didn’t really want to be here, either. We’ll get through this together, though. Okay?”
Peter chuckled as Jules rolled her eyes. “Just last week you served us yourself,” she said before holding out her own mug. “The attitude on these young kids...”
Potter hesitated before holding out his hand toward Draco. “Likewise, Malfoy.”
The nurse shrugged. “It’s hard to say, sir. Some people remember things easily, and others don’t. Your husband here has all the proper paperwork...”
“Mister Potter?” At Draco’s nod, Narcissa turned and stepped aside. “Has he?”
Drao’s fingers tightened around the wand. “You have no right to try.”
. There’s even a rumor he was seen kissing a bloke at some holiday party.”
Draco frowned at the couch. “If I sleep here, where is my pillow?”
“You don’t have to if you don’t want to.” Harry pulled out of the parking lot he had stopped in to explain what was going on. “Let’s just get through this and then we can go back to normal. I promise.”
Draco looked down at his feet before moving his foot to the brake pedal. “I can’t believe I was worried about this.”
“I manipulated you,” Harry continued. “I used the fact that you didn’t have any memories for my own personal gain. I wish I had been better than that and I am truly sorry for the hurt I caused you. And if it affected your job, let me know and I’ll speak to your supervisor. I’ll explain that I’m the reason you’re behind. If you are, I mean...”
Lily, now seven, would only know her mother through stories and pictures, just as Harry would never know his parents any other way. He vowed to make sure his children would never question how much Ginny loved them no matter what it took. Especially James, who was born a squib. When they realized, Ginny had been desperate and swore that James would never feel lesser than his siblings, which Harry obviously agreed with. Magic or not, their children were perfect just the way they were.
The same wand that Harry had taken from him years ago. The same wand used to defeat Voldemort. Harry shook his head, tired of
. Perhaps it would even be something he could pass down to Teddy some day.
“The one and only. May I sit or is your ego still big enough to take up all the space around you?” Stupid, why did he have to be so
“Oh come on, dad, you just want to help him.” James shrugged before turning around a bit to look at his siblings. “We’ll call him papa, right? And no telling, Lily.”
Harry couldn’t help the laugh that escaped. Draco’s missing wedding band had been brought up the second day and the only excuse Harry had was that Draco must have dropped it during whatever made him lose his memory. Affording the ring that Draco figured he deserved wasn’t going to happen easily -- part of Harry wondered why he even considered getting one in the first place.
“Not a problem, Mr. Potter. Tell the children I said hello!”
“I’m sure I’ll pick it up once I get in the truck.” He held out his hand. “Keys.”
“Of course. I think Pansy made some coffee, but we also have tea?” Draco left the door open while he went into the nearby kitchen. “Are you hungry?”
“They were confusing,” Lily continued, ignoring him. “Papa said they were to tell us how steep things were, but we already know it because we live here.”
Harry shook his head. “His family is in England, same as mine. He said he was here for work.”
“I had my own run in with men in my younger years.”
Initially, Draco questioned including all four of them, but Potter just said, “They were friends at one point, and even Peter changed in the end.” Draco just nodded, accepting that.
“No,” Potter said, almost too quickly. When Draco arched an eyebrow at him, Potter cleared his throat. “Mister Malfoy has enough work to do, I’m sure.”
“Hush, Harry.” Draco trailed his fingers down Harry’s cheek. “Coming back to England, ranting about your stupidity to my mother, it made me realize something. I
Harry wanted to kiss him.
He turned off the stove so the pasta didn’t over-boil before turning to kneel next in front of her. Harry tucked a piece of hair behind her ear and tried to give her a smile. “Papa... Lily, Papa had to leave. He isn’t coming back, baby.”
“True.” Pansy shifted so she was pressing against Draco’s side, her head on his shoulder. “But, we’re not really defined by our House anymore. Granger had a run through with the Ministry when we were reforming it and berated a lot of old men into shame.”
, Potter.”
“We’ll see,” Draco told her, pressing a kiss to her temple. “For now, let me just focus on doing my job.”
-----
“I don’t deserve your thanks for that. Not after what I did.”
Drew just smiled wider as the television behind them started in on the news. They both looked over as the anchor, a stuck-up ponce who thought he was an actual Hollywood celebrity, stared seriously into the camera as he went on about the breaking news.
Harry leaned over Draco’s shoulders, squeezing them gently. “What are you three up to?” he asked before pressing a kiss to Draco’s head.
“Pansy--”
Harry waved him off, leaning against the bar. “You know you don’t have to.”
“You let him go really easy, Dad.” Albus closed his notebook and stood from the table. “You don’t want to fix it,” he said with a shrug.
-----
“Good to know.” Potter checked his watch and frowned. “Look, I’m not making an excuse to leave to get away from you, but Teddy and I have to go. I promised Ron I’d babysit for their anniversary and...”
“If it’s our bedroom, my
Pansy met Draco at the door with a cup of tea and an innocent grin. “How’d it go?” she asked, handing the cup over.
“Albus--”
Well, to hide and to make plans. Draco would need a lot more than Harry’s word to believe him, so that meant an ID and even a marriage certificate. Feeling just a bit dirty, Harry reached into his dresser to pull out his wand and get to work.
Harry’s heart tightened in his chest. “I... I see.”
.” Draco then flicked his wand with a flourish and disappeared, leaving Harry alone in the bedroom, his guilt the only thing keeping him company.
“I saw a design while I was out which I just
“I’m not hiding anything, Malfoy,” Potter said, taking a step back. When Draco matched him, he let out a sigh. “Do you mind?”
“His kid is cute.” Draco settled onto the couch, putting his tea on the side table. “Potter obviously dotes on him and he’s going to be a terror at Hogwarts, I’m sure. Curious and imaginative.” He looked to her, eyebrow arched. “Does that answer your question?”
For the first time in days, Harry wondered what Ginny would have thought about the situation. She definitely would have called him an asshole, first of all, but after that, he wasn’t so sure. Harry stood, escorting Lily to the table to sit with her brothers. They had to get on with their lives.  Wishing Draco was back here wasn’t going to help.
Both his sons bowed their heads, muttering apologies as the barn owl finally landed on Harry’s outstretched arm. He cooed at the bird, settling it before taking the letters. He then knelt down to let Albus slowly approach, treats in the palm of his hand.
“If you’re sure...”
“Good. Now I’m going to grab my wand and leave here. I don’t care what you tell your children because this is no longer my problem. And just so you know, I
“I’m almost afraid to see the bedrooms,” Draco said, voice icy. “How long have I been away?”
“That isn’t any fun.” Pansy followed behind him. “Come on, tell me.”
Harry went around Draco to press a kiss to each of their foreheads. “Make sure your brother starts his, please.”
“Nothing a little aloe won’t fix. And a hat next time.”
“Sounds good. Come on, babe, let’s go home.” Draco pressed a gentle kiss to Harry’s cheek before taking his hand and pulling him out the door.
After a long moment, Potter’s shoulders slumped. “You’re right, I’m sorry. Send me an owl when you’ve reached that point?”
Harry stayed in the doorway, listening for any sounds downstairs after James left the house. He could hear muffled voices outside, but didn’t bother trying to figure out who was saying what -- did it even matter anymore? Yet again, his life was crumbling beneath his feet. Losing Ginny hurt, but at least they had time to prepare for that. The muggle disease that took her was slow and gave them time to say their goodbyes. Losing Draco -- because what else would be happening right now -- cut him deeper than anything else had before. Harry wasn’t even sure how to begin convincing the blond to stay here with them. He wasn’t
Draco made sure to turn on the signal before looking both ways down the road. “We’ll start saving now. Another truck, maybe?”
“You’re not allowed again,” Draco insisted before standing. “Honestly, how could I have let it go on so long?”
“What?” he asked, hoping to just get it over with.
-----
“The turn signal is on the left.” Harry took off his belt so he could shift a bit closer and point to it. “You push it up to indicate right, and down to indicate left.”
“Self-sacrificing

Draco didn’t want to leave with only a

“This would be better with two feet,” Draco complained. “Are you sure?”
“M-me?”
“Albus,” Harry corrected.
“I mean--”
“Oh, sod off it, Potter.”
“I get it, you didn’t want to make me uncomfortable. But Harry, I’ve been taking naps up here while you’ve been at work ever since we got back from the hospital.” Draco tugged back the covers. “So, let’s just go to bed.”
“Just show me where I can take a nap. I want to hopefully wake up in a place I actually belong.”
“I’m sorry, babe.” Draco kissed his cheek. “Why don’t you take a bath and relax. I got dinner.”
“Three kids isn’t a walk in the park, even if they’re as perfect as ours.” Harry motioned for Draco to follow him. “Come on, I’ll show you upstairs.”
“Your back!” Harry all but screamed as Draco took a step into the room. “You hurt your back a while ago and you’ve been sleeping on the couch until it got better. Something about the way it helps you stretch.”
“I did hear about that...”
“Oh... Sorry, I didn’t even notice the time. The kids still outside?”
Potter ruffled the boy’s hair. “I told Teddy and he was too excited to wait until our next park outing, I hope it’s okay we asked to meet so soon.”
“Slytherin influences?” Draco stood, pushing his chair back slowly to do so. “Why Potter, I didn’t realize being ambitious was such a bad thing in your eyes. Isn’t Granger quite ambitious? I’ve heard plenty of stories.”
“Draco--”
“Busy.”
“One is for you and one is for Teddy. Those are what I haven’t decided on yet.” Draco stood, stretching his back. “I might carve some on the top, too, and cover it in glass.” He just couldn’t decide whether to make it Hogwarts or the streets of Boston. Both places had the same feeling of
It wasn’t until Harry saw Drew’s wink that he burst into laughter. At roughly the same age, Drew didn’t have all that much “younger years” behind him. At least Harry hoped not -- he didn’t want to be older as it was.
“This isn’t that hard,” Draco said as he slowed the truck down at the end of their yard. “I should have done this sooner.”
Harry took the picture back and stuffed it in his pocket. “Draco. His name is Draco Malfoy.” When she arched an eyebrow, Harry realized his mistake. “He wanted to keep his name since he’s the only son.”
“I promise I won’t bite,” Draco teased as he lay down.
“That’s what you do, right?” Lily looked to her brothers. “He fixes things every day, right?”
That was the thought that finally pulled him away. Harry kept his hands on Draco’s hips but stepped back so there would be space between them. Space so he wouldn’t press forward and kiss the blond again and again and...
“Maybe.“ Harry shrugged, trying not to recall the hidden fear he witnessed in Draco’s eyes.
“Without sounding rude, we’re glad you came. He hasn’t been easy to deal with, though none of us blame him.” The doctor motioned Harry to follow him. “If I lost my memory and woke up in the middle of a muddy field, I would be upset as well.”
Draco just hummed in response, and they spent the rest of the time making dinner in silence.

She handed him a clipboard. “Of course. And we’ll need you to fill these out as well...”
“I see. Sounds like fun.”
“I won’t be a burden!”
Draco hesitated before pouring the water. “All right?”
Harry Potter wants one of my pieces in his home? Merlin, I might
If living in Boston had taught him one thing, it was the fact that Muggles knew how to make their food. After growing up on house-elf made dishes, the variety offered on the brick streets made him almost want to become a chef. Almost.
Startled, Draco paused upon arriving, sandwich halfway to his mouth, as he spotted a familiar figure in the park across the street. It took him a moment longer to realize he wasn’t seeing ghosts and the man sitting relaxed on the bench was, in fact, Harry Potter. Eight years had done him well and Draco felt his old school crush come back full force. Any classmate of theirs would say their rivalry was legendary, but Draco always found antagonizing Potter preferable over facing his true feelings.
“If he wants to,” Albus agreed. “I don’t think he wants to fix this, Lily.”
“It happens, I promise. We’re all stubborn here.” Harry rubbed Draco’s arms softly until he realized what he had been doing. Blushing, he went back to the fridge and grabbed a few vegetables. “It’s going to be a rough few days, but things will get back to normal.”
“Go get him, Dad,” James had said before Harry spun on his heel and apparated out of the Burrow.
“They don’t--”
He spotted a few cafes along his walk that looked excellent. Though there was one small cart on the street that smelled too good to pass up; Draco decided to give it a chance. The menu boasted simple sandwiches, but it still took a while for Draco to decide which one -- they all sounded fantastic.
“I understand. A lot of what I do is rather boring while I form the wood.” He hesitated. “If it’s alright with you and Pansy, he can come to watch me carve it. That way if he has any changes, I can do them quickly.”
“The keys?” he asked again.
The doctor ignored him and went to poke at some of the machines. Harry wasn’t sure what he was doing, so he just hovered in the doorway, watching Malfoy on the bed. His arms were crossed over his chest and despite being in a plain hospital gown, he still looked regal and intimidating. The slight twitch in his eye, though, told Harry that the blond was only crossing his arms to hide the shake in his hands. It had become a tick during the war that Malfoy never could seem to get rid of whenever he was truly scared.
“Does it look like I work here?” Harry teased before grabbing the warming coffee pot. “I come in here for my own breakfast and I’m put to work...”
Harry snorted, popping the top off his beer before taking a swig. He missed firewhiskey. “What kind of advantage could come out of lost memories?”
“Dad--”
The years made him a sap.
“I’m just grabbing this,” Harry told Howard, quickly heading for the door.
-----
“You have to be kidding,” Draco whispered beside him, scowling at the house. “There must be a mistake. I can’t possibly live somewhere as dirty as this.”
Potter frowned, rubbing at his forehead where the scar still sat. “I’ll think about it.”
“Mom said that,” James cut in, “but she isn’t wrong.”
Draco just smiled, staring into the fireplace in front of them. Maybe he could feel out Potter over the next few weeks. They would be talking through owls and potential in-person meetings if Draco pretended not to stalk him and Teddy at the park. He couldn’t be
“Shouldn’t take longer than two weeks in-between Pansy’s stuff,” Draco said. “If you need it sooner...”
try to contact me again, I will make your life a living hell. Are we understood?”
?” Harry held back a shiver at the acid dripping from Malfoy’s voice. “I think I would remember if I had a husband!”
“Of course they are,” Potter turned back to where the children were running around. “So... Rumors are you died, actually.”
Before Draco could let his mind berate him too much, Potter let out a laugh and shifted over on the bench. “Yes, I suppose it’s really you. Might as well take a seat or you’ll worry the other mums.”
Albus immediately sat up, a child that was a perfect combination of both Harry and Ginny. He looked a lot like Ginny, but with Harry’s inky black hair and emerald green eyes  “Really?”
Draco pushed past Harry, shoving him with his shoulder as he did so. Harry turned, throat dry and feeling as if someone were choking him. He wanted to tell Draco not to leave, to stay and figure this out together. But what right did he have? No matter how much he actually cared for Draco, he had still faked a life that didn’t belong to either of them.
“Nothing like that, I promise.” Harry pressed a kiss to her forehead. “Daddy just made a mistake, so Papa left. You did nothing wrong, love.”
“You could use it to your advantage.” Drew pointed the unopened bottle at Harry. “Take him to task, or whatever they say.”
Harry caught both Ashely and Drew’s grins as he left and he couldn’t help the flush that stole across his cheeks. The next time he was in the bar, there was going to be more than just talking about their next dinner date. The couple would definitely have questions about the fact that Harry was so obviously gone on his pretend husband
“We had a surrogate, Draco. You saw their pictures earlier.”
“That isn’t what I meant.” Potter crossed his arms. “Teddy isn’t going to come here and that’s... that’s final.”
Eventually.
Draco stared at the empty parchment, not sure what exactly to say to Potter. Copies of previous designs he typically sent out to inquiring customers sat on the corner of his desk, but that was as far as he had gotten in the hours after he left the park. Simply saying, “Dear Mister Potter, here are some examples. Draco Malfoy” would do nothing more than have him lose a customer.
“Draco, you--”
“Mmhm.” Harry unbuckled his seatbelt and opened the door. “Come on, might as well head on in. I have to pick up the kids from school later, but I want to make sure you’re settled in first. We can also do some of our own diagnostics to see what went wrong.” Harry had briefly explained on their way to the house about being wizards -- Draco had taken it surprisingly well.
-----
Drew rubbed at his chin. “If he went to school with you, he probably doesn’t have family around here, right? Or is that why he’s here?”
“Draco.” She rested a hand on his arm. “You’ve been going on about Potter for years. Not just through school, but you've mentioned him in your letters over the years, too. When are you going to admit to your feelings?”
Harry looked up from James’ latest homework, staring at Draco. It took him a moment to realize what he had asked, so by the time he leaned back in the chair, Draco’s arms were crossed and his foot tapping impatiently on the floor.
husband, then why not?”
“It looks perfect,” Teddy declared once Draco finished the last line. “Uncle Harry, look!”
After the war, the Weasley family had been the ones to convince Harry he didn’t need to stick around and rebuild a society that all but ignored him until they needed something from him. He owed them nothing -- he had already given them his
“Lost memory or not, you’re being rude. They’re
to him. “Anyway, you’re home early.”
“Yes, mum,” Harry said, gratefully taking the plate from her. “I figured I would work on that second stove today. You said it doesn’t heat as it should?”
Draco’s quick footsteps as he came down the stairs jerked Harry from his thoughts. He turned to smile at the man, pulling the keys out of the pocket. Draco returned the smile and took them from Harry’s hand, dropping a quick kiss on his cheek as he went out the door.  Harry shook his head, following behind.
“What is it, Potter?” Draco took two teacups down to prepare the drinks.
“I’m not calling him Papa,” Albus mumbled and Harry gave in.
Draco recalled hearing about Potter’s godson through his mother. Though the name of the boy escaped him, he did know they were related -- his grandmother was Draco’s aunt. “I’m sorry for your loss,” he said sincerely. “I didn’t know her as well as you did, though she was family. Mum took it hard.”
Nurse Annie’s lips quirked. “Do you have proof? We’ve had quite a few people in here already claiming to know the poor man. I’m sure you know of our rumors.”

“No offense, but the Dark Lord was never living in your home.” Draco forced a smile on his face. “Tell me about this design you saw.”
to have on my dresser,” she said, sweeping into the room. “I made sure to get a memory of it so you can view it later, but I promise this is the last time I change it.”
The last person he expected to see on the other side was Potter. Draco stared at him for a long moment before remembering his manners. “Potter... What are you doing here? How...?”
“The two of you have been fighting since you were eleven and it hasn’t always been simply school-boy rivalry.” Her look turned soft and she tilted her head. “What do you feel for my son, Mister Potter?”
Draco moved around the table, stepping closer to the Boy-Who-Won. “You know, I think it has absolutely nothing to do with myself or Pansy. I think it has to do with you.”
him, Mister Potter.” She smiled and looked down at his wedding band. “I saved your life once, so long ago now, and I consider this your repayment. Your life debt to me has been fulfilled.”
Draco had pulled the covers back on Ginny’s side of the bed. The side that hadn’t smelled like her for weeks now, actually. It had smelled like
Draco nodded. “Oh, for sure. My first map was too detailed.”
The doctor chuckled before opening a door. “Good news,” he said to the room, easily dodging what looked like an empty cup thrown from the bed. “Your husband has arrived to take you home.”
“You know...” Potter waved his hand as if that explained anything. All it did was grate on Draco’s already frayed nerves. “Influences.”
“I heard she recently split from Nott. So it’s true?”
“That’s right, same direction.” Harry rubbed his hand on Draco’s leg. He was sure he should pull it away, but it seemed to be helping Draco’s nerves, so he kept it there. “We’ll talk about the wipers when it actually rains.”
Harry was close enough, so Draco pressed a gentle kiss to his temple. “Of course. They’re important to you, so they’re important to me.”
-----
me. Understand?”
“I didn’t realize you wanted to run away from England that bad,” Harry snapped out before he could stop himself.
The longer Harry was next to Draco, the more he was convinced that this really was a terrible idea. Drew could be convincing at times and now, pulling into the dirt driveway of the house, Harry regretted ever listening to his crazy suggestion. Sure, he always wanted to get a little revenge on Draco for everything that happened at school, but was this maybe taking it too far?
