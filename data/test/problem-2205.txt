“But... you...” Harry floundered. He wasn’t sure what ritual Draco thought created a horcrux, but he doubted it was the real one. If Draco really knew, he would not calmly lay with him and try to reassure him.
“That makes one of us,” Harry said as he rubbed absently at his neck. He’d been doing it all morning.
“And like I said earlier, it’s best if we don’t know specifics,” Theo said. “What if we’re caught? If a guard finds the other mirror, or a professor catches us with this one, we’re screwed. The more we know, the worse it’ll be for us.”
If Snape and McGonagall weren’t bad enough, the other students regained interest in him after Lance’s first article was published in Monday’s paper. That first article was a short piece that let the public know Harry had become a young activist who was hoping to improve Azkaban and the overall policies surrounding wizard incarceration. Harry had expected this, as Lance informed him he would conduct some research and interview others before he started publishing more in-depth articles. Unfortunately, it seemed that once Harry was willing to open up to a reporter, the other students felt intitled to ask their own questions. Neither Ron nor Hermione were surprised when Harry announced his intention to spend another night in the library, despite having managed to catch up with coursework.
“No,” Harry said firmly.
“Yes,” said Zabini quickly.
can handle it,” Draco responded with a small smile. He let Harry into a beautifully decorated room. Once they reached the bed, he helped Harry remove his clothes. “You good to sleep in your pants, or do you want me to find you some night clothes?”
“I imagined it... I did it...” Harry said softly without looking at Draco. He felt the hand in his hair pause. When he finally raised his worried eyes to meet Draco’s, he saw the other man looked shocked and a little horrified.
“Good on you for avenging your godfather,” as the voice continued. “Pretty ballsy of you to kill her on ministry grounds, but-”
“I knew it’d have to be me,” Draco admitted. “Not that you aren’t romantic, but I knew I’d have to ask.”
“Pardon?”
As promised, Rodolphus did teach Harry two defense spells. Since the curse did not have a counter, Lestrange taught Harry a spell that would help alleviate pain. Harry found it useful as it could be used against headaches, though it lacked the potency a potion would have. For the second spell, Lestrange taught him a manticore repelling charm. Harry did not think it would come in that handy, but he still made an effort to learn it.
“Harry,” Hermione said with sympathy and held his hand. “What Burke did was not OK. He should never have been hired, so maybe better screening for guards should be implemented. But Burke was the exception. That’s not… unless he wasn’t the exception?” Hermione asked, suddenly fearing how commonplace Burke’s behaviour was.
It only took a few questions for Harry to get the general sense of what Hale was trying to tease out. The man focused on getting Harry to describe whether the Death Eaters had been aggressive or reluctant. He asked whether Harry recalled anyone trying to minimize the damage.
“Oh?” Harry asked. Draco had created several spells over the last few years, and Harry never failed to be impressed by them. By Draco.
“Dementors,” came Crabbe’s voice. “Definitely dementors.”
“That’s why I’m here,” he held up the ring again. “I was hoping you could hold on it... I... If I survive –
“Pott-” Snape was cut off when Harry flinched hard. An angry crimson-coloured spell shot from his wand. Fortunately, he had not been aiming at anyone, as the spell left a deep crack in the wall that quickly spiderwebbed. The entire class stopped what they were doing to either watch Harry quickly shift away from Snape, or where the crack continued to spiderwebbed up the wall about four feet.
“He doesn’t act like it,” Harry couldn’t help but cut in.
“Er, you probably taught me more than I should know already,” stated Harry.
His friends didn’t look convinced, but at least they didn’t look at him like he’d been permanently brain damaged by his stay in Azkaban.
“I know it’s a lot of ask,” Harry mimicked how Lucius had broached the subject, “but Lucius was hoping you would be able to mail this letter to his son, Draco.”
The box also housed the photos Harry had created of his friends. He suggested that the others occasionally store their own photos in Albert’s box to reduce the risk of the guards finding them. As much as it pained them to part with those photos, they agreed it was safer to only pull them out when they needed to.
“How?” asked Hermione.
“I don’t know how humans consume one another or the repercussions,” said Ishanders, which caused Harry to flinch. He hated the way Ishanders phrased that as it sounded uncomfortably close to cannibalism. The idea of cannibalism made Harry queasy, though he didn’t know if it was better or worse to eat someone’s soul. Probably worse.
“What do you mean?” asked Harry.
“Er, I know. Found that out in first year... the hard way,” Harry said.
“You didn’t always think so,” Draco pointed out.
“Yeah. My scar. And he didn’t mean to make me into one. So, it can happen accidentally, you see?” Harry pointed out.
“No, no, don’t give me your stuff. You’ve done enough; I don’t deserve it,” Harry said. Draco sighed, but decided not to force Harry into pajamas.
Draco focused his attention on helping his father recuperate. Logically Harry understood that Azkaban tore people down. He recalled how fragile Draco looked following his release, and that was during a time he had still hidden parts of himself from Harry. Draco still couldn’t talk about it except in bits and pieces. Lucius had been in Azkaban longer than his son, and likely was in poor health. He would need support. He knew Draco loved his father and would be part of his support system. Harry understood this... and yet he still became despondent when Draco barely made time for him. Draco did fire-call, but they were relatively short and focused on appeasing James, who didn’t understand why Draco had to spend his days and nights away from them. Harry waited for the day when Draco would leave him because Mr. Malfoy did not approve of a single father with a ‘questionable’ blood status as a partner for his only son.
“Alright?” asked Ron. Harry looked over his wand before he answered.
spoiled. Well, he can be really mean, but that’s with people he doesn’t like,” such as Harry, Harry thought morosely. It was perhaps his least favourite part of Draco’s personality. Draco would go after what his opponent was the most vulnerable about. But he was the opposite with the people he truly cared about. “My cousin, Dudley, is spoiled. He gets whatever he wants and that made him really selfish. He doesn’t really think about anyone but himself. I used to think Draco was the same way. But it’s more like he’s learnt that you spoil the people you care about. Like… when Crabbe told me that Draco buys his son
“Ready?” Draco eventually asked when it became clear his husband would need prompting.
Harry blinked a few times in stunned silence, before he leaned towards Hale. “Is he fucking me with?” Harry asked in genuine uncertainty. His voice was low but given the near silence of the courtroom, his question travelled rather far.
His mother’s ring was a mangled mess. The band was broken and twisted twice over. He didn’t know how Mrs. Weasley had managed to get it to stay on a chain, but magic must have been involved. It no longer remotely resembled a ring, but Harry knew it for what it was. Even the lack of ruby in the center piece did not throw Harry off. He knew this mangled twisted piece of metal had once been his mother’s ring. His horcrux. However, Harry could tell it was neither anymore. It was no more a horcrux than it was a ring. His soul was gone. Harry shuddered to think it was trapped under the bench with Voldemort’s in the in-between.
Burke might think he was safe, but Harry was starting to feel the same way he had right before he blew up aunt Marge. The magic felt particularly potent given that Burke’s insults played upon in his negative feelings towards Bellatrix. Unfortunately, when Harry tried to actively reach for it, his magic seemed to slip out of his grasp.
“Dementors,” Malfoy explained, not that he needed to. By now, Harry was aware of what dementors felt like. As the sound of his mother’s voice started ringing in his head, Harry tried to huddle on his bed without looking like he was huddling. It seemed unlikely that the other men would notice due to their own proximity to the dementors but he remembered all too clearly the teasing Draco Malfoy and his cronies gave him in third year. Without his wand available to cast a patronus, Harry suddenly felt like he was in third year all over again. Completely helpless against the dementors and his worst memories.
“I don’t want to go back to the party,” Harry admitted petulantly.
“Did you really manage to remove Burke’s soul by yourself?” Lucius asked. His voice held no condemnation, which gave Harry enough hope to answer truthfully. He was pretty sure Lucius had had a clear view into his cell, but realized the man might not have wanted to watch him get raped and turned away at the most critical moment.
“Pity we can’t owl order one for Burke,” stated Mulciber. Harry laughed as he imaged the look on the man’s face as he accidentally set it off as he opened the package.
“I consent,” Harry said. Hale nodded and placed the quill above the notepad. He began asking Harry questions, and Harry answered them as he had practiced with his mentors. The answers might have been rehearsed but the sentiments were real. Harry wanted to speak out against the ministry, especially Umbridge. Lucius and Albert simply helped ensure he would do so elegantly.
“Yes, well… we have not forgotten the incident before the boy’s fifth year,” stated the auror.
far. We’re cleaned up before our judicial-wizards or any high-up ministry workers see us. So, it isn’t obvious to anyone not in the building. Though I doubt the public outcry would be too loud in defense of prisoners anyway,” Lucius said.
“What?” asked Harry.
Harry expected Draco to tell Zabini to fuck off, but after a slight pause, Draco shrugged and said, “why not.” Harry had time to mentally scream ‘oh my god, oh my god, oh my god’ before he was enveloped by Draco. Harry’s hands rose automatically, but unlike his hug with Crabbe, his arms rested against Draco’s back rather than pat him. Harry was shorter than Draco, and it left his eyes aligned closer to Draco’s shoulder. Harry used to resent their difference in height, but now that he was so close to him, Harry understood there could be some pleasant benefits. Under different circumstances it would easy for Harry to tuck himself just under Draco’s chin and burrow into his warmth. Nevertheless, Harry found that even standing chest to chest he was able to take in Draco’s scent. Harry tried not to obviously breath in that delicious aroma that was a pleasant mix of – no doubt expensive – hygiene and beauty products. Harry was no expert in hugs, but this had to be high up on the ‘best hug ever’ list, surely.
“Clearly,” Lucius remarked with amusement.
” one dementor questioned the others.
Harry talked a little of current events that he picked up mostly from Hermione, but it quickly became clear that that wasn’t the main topic Malfoy was fishing for.
He recounted how he learnt about the deathly hallows. He was amused by Draco’s reaction to learning the hallows were real and how he’d unknowing been the brief master of the elder wand. As he recounted what he experienced, or thought he experienced in purgatory, a terrible possibility occurred to him.
“Oh, that’s right, they are delinquents just like you. They’ll probably be joining you here soon enough. I know the aurors were questioning them,” stated Burke. Harry tried not to let his worry show. Harry could overlook Burke’s taunts about being labelled a delinquent. It wouldn’t be the first time it happened. But Harry didn’t know what happened to his friends and he was worried about them just as much as he was worried about what was happening to him. It sounded like they were still safe at Hogwarts for now.
. Ginny’s dead. Neville killed him. Kind
cast the curse,” the voice continued. He also sounded amused.
“Did he ever mention why he became a Death Eater?” asked Bones.
“Only for a second,” Harry repeated. Glancing between Nott and Malfoy, Harry could tell that they both seemed surprised.
“Hands against the wall!” repeated Burke. Albert very reluctantly complied.
“You unwrap it, stick the back to a section of the wall, smack the center, and then back up. Before you know it, there’s a nice-sized hole in the wall you can squeeze through,” Ron explained.
Harry sighed and tried to think of a completely different idea. Unfortunately, for every lowkey romantic idea that popped into his head, Harry was able to imagine how Draco could misinterpret Harry’s intentions. Lucius had seemed pleased by the brush and mirror, but that had been in Azkaban. Any gift was probably welcomed just for the novelty of having something pleasant around. Harry wished he could ask Lucius for advice.
criminal, but his awareness of the situation would be hampered by the presence of the dementor,” Scrimgeour said. The latter was a valid point, but Harry realized that if the man truly thought that then he would apply the same logic to anything Harry said given he’d been closer to the dementor.
The water was only a notch above what Harry would call warm, but there was no way for him to adjust the temperature. He took a minute to just enjoy the feeling of water pouring over his body, before he reached for the only soap dispenser attached to the stall. Harry felt weird using the same soap on his hair and body, but it was better than nothing.
“No one?” asked Malfoy. He pointedly raised his eyebrows. Harry immediately thought of Umbridge. When he pushed the thought of her away, it was thoughts of getting revenge on Snape that took its place. Almost immediately afterwards thoughts of cursing Voldemort, Wormtail and the Dursleys all popped into his head. Perhaps there were a few people he might want to hurt…
“Oh, I already feel so angry. All the time,” Andromeda confessed. “The fact that it was Bellatrix. That’s she’s gone too, and I won’t ever get my revenge... or an explanation as to why my
Not important to the plot but in case anyone was curious: Blocks A and B are for less sever crimes/sentences while C and D are high security. Block A & C are women’s while B and D are men.
“Can I help?” Harry blurted just as Draco reached the entrance area. Draco turned back towards him with raised eyebrows.
“Vince, could you come here?” Draco asked. Crabbe practically leapt to his feet; Harry didn’t think he’d ever seen him move that fast. Draco realized he wouldn’t have to explain the situation, so he gave Crabbe the mirror and let him pass him into the classroom.
“Not bad? Harry, they’re Death Eaters,” Ron exclaimed.
The only thing that caused genuine strife in their relationship was when Lucius Malfoy appealed his conviction. Draco had been nervous but hopeful to get his father back. Harry thought the man deserved to rot a bit longer. He didn’t say so aloud, at least not to Draco, but the underlying sentiments were obvious. It caused continuous tension in their relationship for the duration of the trial. Harry grew even more aggravated when he felt like Mr. Malfoy was using his family’s connection to Harry to help his case. Especially since it worked. Lucius Malfoy was released from Azkaban years before he should have been.
“I’m sure... Perhaps Potter knows then,” Burke threatened as he drew his attention away from the injured man and focused on Harry once more. Harry drew in a fortifying breath as he held the man’s full attention once more. Whatever satisfaction Burke had gotten from seeing Albert in pain slid off his face as he moved towards Harry’s cell.
“Harry?” Lucius prompted once the other prisoners recovered from the effects of the dementors’ presence.
Harry told them about the strange events that had been happening all year. He felt awkward accusing Draco of Katie’s predicament to his father, but he forged on. A few of the other prisoners snorted in amusement when Harry mentioned Ron had accidentally consumed a love potion meant for Harry, but Malfoy seemed as tense as ever throughout the whole conversation. Harry thought it was an odd twist of fate that despite his strong accusations all year, Harry was parroting some of Hermione’s arguments about how Harry could be wrong about Malfoy. Harry himself didn’t believe but he found himself wanting to comfort Malfoy.
Harry next focused on Mulciber’s cell and built a similar illusion. He waited until he was almost in front of the cell before he activated the wards. He breathed easier once he felt them set without any visible confirmation. He didn't have as much time to build an illusion in front of the second Lestrange brother’s cell. He knew it was sloppy work, but gambled on the fact that the guards’ attention was elsewhere.
“From what you saw that night, did you get the impression she was willing to use any means?”
“In Azkaban?” asked a confused Goyle.
Harry was trying to think of a response that wouldn’t incriminate him but also let them know he was crap at that particular spell. Surely the fact that it had barely worked should cut him some slack. Before he could think of a way to phrase it, the sound of doors opening at both ends of the hallways were heard. Suddenly the already cold air turned frigid. Both Malfoy and Albert back up in their cells.
“How’d you get a two-way mirror in-”
“How does Ginny factor into this?” Draco asked.
As the guards moved away from his cell, Harry caught Malfoy looking at him with concern. Harry quickly looked at the walls of his cell instead. He didn’t know what to do with Malfoy’s pity. He felt too vulnerable, and Malfoy and Nott had already seen him cry once today.
“I-” Harry shifted uncomfortably. He didn’t want to talk about Azkaban. Ever. Unfortunately, he didn’t know how else to get them to understand his new perspective on the other prisoners. “It’s a pretty miserable place. It’s cold, and the guards... well, they’re mostly shit if I’m being honest. Maybe some of them are alright, but not the ones working in the major crimes section of the prison. There’s just so much time to think about how everything went wrong. The dementors’ presence just encourages those thoughts,” Harry said. He might have stopped feeling the dementors’ effects himself, but that wasn’t the case for the other prisoners. He’d felt guilty and frustrated that he couldn’t do anything to help them. The time he’d heard Crabbe sobbing in his cell, trying to be quiet, had been heartbreaking. Doubly so because he had started to look forward to Asherath and Ishanders’ visits, hoping he’d get answers (and then wishing he never had). If he said the dementors ‘weren’t that bad’, his friends would think he was certifiably insane.
“So... what was it like for you? Did they really put you next to Nott?” Ron asked.
“Go on,” the last guard urged impatiently.
“That’s just an added bonus. I’d hoped to see at least one of you. Otherwise, I would have asked Harry to come to the off-”
“It was the same for Ginny, Luna and me as well,” Hermione added. Ron let out another bark of a laugh.
“Well... I was a horcrux, right? What if that’s the spot Voldemort’s soul took up?” Harry asked. He’d stopped avoiding saying ‘Voldemort’ once the aurors started using it as a way to round up any stray supporters dumb enough to show up when his name was spoken.
Harry realized no towel would be provided as he walked pass the entryway leading back to the changing room. Instead a blast of too-hot air surrounded him. Almost instantly the water on his person evaporated. It felt similar to one of those muggle hand dryers, but much more efficient. When Harry reluctantly moved one hand from his groin to touch his hair, he noticed it was dry too.
“Plus, if you got the pleasure of torturing Potter while the dark lord is denied...” Nott trailed off as he let Jugson picture whatever he wanted as the negative consequence.
“Rodolphus really misses her,” Harry attempted to explain. Hale didn’t push the issue. He dutifully shuffled the letter in with the pile of scrolls in front of him.
He did appreciate that Narcissa gave Molly some areas that she could be involved in. Harry suspected they were carefully chosen to be things Narcissa didn’t care as much about, or she expected Molly’s decisions would be forced to compliment the rest of the wedding plans.
“Auror Bole, Auror Perkins,” Runecraft nodded towards Harry, Hermione and Ron. As both aurors started making their way towards them, Harry glanced at professor Dumbledore for guidance but the man’s attention was on Runecraft.
“Disintegrating?” he repeated. “How can you tell?”
“Theo was already helping me with this part anyway,” Harry said as he riffed through his bag to dig up his notes.
Harry debated revealing what he discovered about horcruxes, and ask Dumbledore if he knew that Harry was one. Anger briefly surfaced at the thought but it faded quickly and was replaced with fear and sadness. He knew they should talk about it, but Harry wasn’t up for facing it today on top of everything else.
“Back to work,” Snape snapped. The other students went back to practicing their spellwork, but their attention remained primarily on Snape or Harry.
The prisoners filed out of the changing room and back into their cells in an orderly fashion. Harry was once again surprised at how docile the most dangerous of Azkaban’s prisoners were being. It made sense given there were dementors nearby, ready to swoop in as soon as the guards dropped their spell. Still, Harry found it unsettling. Perhaps because he too walked back into his cell and watched the door close without even thinking of making a break for it.
“You have always been a remarkable young man. I’ve admired the strength you’ve shown in your latest troubles, but I suppose that is nothing new for you,” McGonagall said.
It honestly surprised no one that Harry drank too much that night. Fortunately, his plan to avoid people by hanging around Draco worked. He said some unfortunate things, but nothing he couldn't bounce back from when sober. Draco, while he did nothing to stop Harry from drinking, had helped steer the conversation towards safe topics. If Harry remembered, he would have to thank him in the morning. Unfortunately, despite Draco’s best efforts, Harry still managed to embarrass himself. At some point he had drunk enough to feel queasy and had to run out of the room before he vomited in front of everyone. Despite making it to the privacy of the bathroom, it didn't take too much sleuthing for people to realize what had happened.
“Potter,” Malfoy answered.
. Azkaban was so cold that, even without the dementors, it seeped into your bones. Harry had his warded cell and Burke’s soul to keep him warm. Without Azkaban’s coolness, Harry felt like he was constantly running hot. While initially pleasant, Hogwart’s warmth has grown uncomfortable. It was as if he’d played a quidditch game and then decided to drink a large cup of tea in front of the fireplace. Wearing a sweater, had been a poor choice.
“No,” Harry insisted and put down his fork before he bent it out of shape. “You won’t be the one to carry our kids.”
Harry shivered but he was not sure if it was because the Azkanban uniform did nothing to stop the cold, or if it was all because of the looks he kept getting from Burke.
“Apparently not since I miss having all of you around,” Harry admitted. He spent the next few minutes catching up with everyone. Now that the desperate need for Lucius, Albert, and Crabbe to see their sons had passed, everyone else wanted a chance to speak to Harry. It was harder to speak to those whose cells were across the hallway from Lucius’. The prisoners didn’t want to risk tossing the mirror across the hall. If they didn’t push hard enough, the mirror might get stuck in the middle of the hallway. If they pushed too hard they risked breaking the glass. They also feared that the mirror might hit the bars instead of pass through the gaps between them. So instead, the prisoners on Lucius’ side of the hallway held up the mirror so Harry could see the prisoners on the other side. It wasn’t ideal, but Harry was still happy.
“That is so gross,” Harry said as he watched the toenails on the foot Lestrange stuck out of his cell detach and curl in on themselves. It was even more cringe-worthy to see it happen than Harry would have guessed the first time they told him about that spell. “Does it hurt?”
“Shoes too,” announced Burke. Harry toed off his threadbare sneakers and replaced them with the shoes on Anton’s desk. The new shoes resized to fit Harry’s feet but that was the only impressive feature. Similar to the thin prisoner uniform, the shoes seemed to be made of cheap and crappy material. Harry was pretty sure that he’d actually be more comfortable in the worn-out pair he came in with.
“It’s really not a trick or anything,” Harry said and directed it towards Draco. Despite Parkinson’s protective stance, Harry was easily able to make eye contact with Draco.
“I’m sure once you start dating, Draco will spoil you rotten,” he said cheerfully.
“Well… I suppose it’s better than the alternative,” suggested Nott.
Draco found him sitting outside the bathroom. He raised an eyebrow at Harry’s ruffled appearance, but didn’t lecture him like he expected.
“Uh no,” Harry admitted with a cringe. Albert wouldn’t be happy if he heard Harry was skipping classes. All of his previous tutors took his education seriously, but Albert was definitely a stickler for keeping to daily lessons. “I didn’t want to deal with Snape today.”
certainly won’t judge you harshly. It’s admirable that you went to defend your godfather’s honour. It’s actually impressive that one so young managed the cruciatus curse. You don-”
Harry didn’t look at any of the other prisoners as he made his way down the hallway. He just wanted to lie down, hopefully sleep, and pretend that nothing had happened.
“Harry, you explain to Draco,” Theo said and practically shoved Harry into the classroom. A few seconds later, Draco joined him and the door closed behind him.
Later that night, Harry snuck out to meet Theo so the other boy could give him a quick tutorial on the basics of blood magic. He didn’t know if it was sitting in a dark square room, learning one-on-one, or just Theo himself, but it reminded Harry of the nights he spent learning magic from the other prisoners. They agreed to meet again the next day, meeting in the classroom right after classes ended so they wouldn’t lose sleep two nights in a row. The latter wasn’t a concern for Harry, but he didn’t want Theo to go without.
“Ginny told us what happened the last time she saw you,” Mr. Weasley spoke up when he noticed his wife struggling. Harry blanched then reddened. He might have been holding the product that resulted from that night, but that didn’t mean he expected Ginny’s father to bring it up.
The aurors had their wands at the ready. They were scanning the great hall and when they spotted Dumbledore, they gave him their full attention. However, the elder wizard with the fancier robes spotted Harry and gave him a rather unsettling grin. The man squared his shoulders and puffed out his chest. Harry had a foreboding feeling that he wasn’t going to like why these men have shown up in the middle of dinner.
“They already have,” whispered Harry, unaware he mimicked Burke. He felt defeated.
“Ronald Weasley?” Bole asked Ron. At Ron’s confirmation, Bole grabbed his arm as well. The man was large and muscular and could probably subdue both of Harry’s friends if need be. He started guiding them towards the other aurors and Perkins followed suit with Harry.
“Are you sure?” Draco asked.
“So, Potter,” Malfoy stated as he tapped the bar to remove his empty tray. “I can’t imagine you’ll be here much longer.”
Harry’s heart skipped a beat at those words. He flashed back to Umbridge saying much the same thing during his detentions with the blood quill.
Dobby greeted him before enthusiastically getting a small meal at Harry’s request. Harry was glad that Dobby didn’t ask about Azkaban beyond making sure that Harry was ok. The other elves mostly ignored him unless he spoke to them first. It was the most pleasant meal he’d had since being back at Hogwarts.
Harry froze for a heartbeat. He felt himself flush and feared his face was an unpleasant shade of red. “I should head back before Hermione comes looking for me,” he said. He followed his urge to flee and turned away from them, and started to walk back the way he came.
“Professor-“ Harry tried to catch Dumbledore’s attention, but the auror whose name Harry didn’t know pushed his shoulder and forcibly guided Harry along. They were out of the hall and on the grounds before Harry thought about properly resisting.
“I suppose this will have to do,” Hale said as he poured a headache relief potion on the ground. He cleaned out the residue and dried the bottle with a couple of spells. “Ready?”
“I don’t know how this is possible,” Draco said as he skimmed the page in front of him.
“Thank you... again. These really are b-” Draco stopped mid-sentence and turned towards a retreating Theo. “Where are you going?”
There was another awkward pause, and this one went on longer than the previous one. Harry desperately searched for something new to say but drew a blank.
Harry nodded. “I will. I’ll do better. With James, and any other children we have. If you still want them, that is.”
“Normally I would be reluctant to use memories in trials. The ministry is notorious for heavily questioning their authenticity. However,
“He’s still young. Some of his features aren’t all that distinct yet,” Draco countered.
“Hey, Mulciber,” Harry said with a smile as he walked into the room.
“You read the letters?” asked Nott sharply.
“Perhaps you should be!” someone yelled from the back of the room. It was enough to give Hawkworth pause, but Runecraft readily stepped in.
his fault.
“What?” asked a bemused Harry. He’d never heard that particular expression, and he shared a dorm with Seamus Finnegan.
Malfoy and Nott laughed at that.
“I see,” Hale answered. He somehow made those two words sound like a threat.
“It is not something that we do,” Asherath added.
“How smallminded of you,” Lucius sneered in true Malfoy fashion. “You’re overlooking the fact that others far more important than you or Burke have already staked their claim on the boy.”
Harry’s pleasure didn’t stem from stealing Burke’s happiness for his own sustenance. Rather, it had to do with feeling his magic thrum under his skin again. It was knowing that he had stopped Burke from violating him further. It was his decision to keep going until he plucked the man’s soul out of his body so that he couldn’t hurt anyone ever again. Decision made, Harry sat up and got to work.
Harry panted through the onslaught of information and the accompanying headache that came with connecting to another’s mind. It wasn’t something he could put into words and explain like any other magical theory, but he suddenly knew how dementors pulled out someone’s soul. If Harry had time to think, he would have convinced himself that it was a magic he couldn’t perform since he wasn’t a dementor. But he knew he had to try when Burke pushed Harry’s legs wide open so that he could settle comfortably between then. Harry trembled, closed his eyes, and tried to call on his magic to coax Burke’s soul out of his body.
Luckily no one pressed him to continue. Harry was pretty sure Hermione would try to speak to him privately, but he planned to put that off as long as possible.
“Potter, you need to speak to someone about your trauma,” Snape insisted as he looked down his nose at Harry.
“Eaten?” questioned Mulciber before laughing. Harry flinched at the sound. He did that a lot lately.
Harry didn’t like being labelled as a victim, but he knew this was coming.
“Is Malfoy as fit as he seems?” asked Ginny.
,” Harry said. He held back the ‘and I hate it’, but he thought the others heard it regardless.
“Shouldn’t we be at the ministry?” asked Harry. The auror’s answer and attitude were doing nothing to alleviate his fears. In fact, Harry’s imagination was growing and leaping at wilder theories. Were these men really death eaters and were using this whole situation as a ruse to get Harry to Voldemort?
Ancient studies were more interesting than Harry expected them to be. The problems Harry had in those lessons arose whenever the Lestrange brothers focused on wizard superiority. Harry felt the need to rebel against that on principle. These lessons inevitably devolved into debates. Harry grew frustrated that all his tutors supported each other during these arguments.
“Pans, go get Theo, or we really will be here all night,” Draco interrupted before Parkinson and Harry could continue to bicker.
Not wanting to talk, Harry lay on his cot and ignored everyone. Rodophous tried to coax Harry by taking in that baby voice he and his wife seemed to love so much, but Lucius told him to shut it. Surprisingly the man did. Fortunately, no one tried asking him about quidditch as a means to distract him; if they had, Harry was sure he would have screamed at them.
“Up to a week if you’ve really pissed them off,” explained Malfoy. Harry made a disgusted face but Malfoy seemed pleased that Harry shared his outrage.
“Our records show Mr. Potter cast the cruciatus on one Bellatrix Lestrange. Duration was only for a couple of seconds,” stated one of the other aurors. Like Bole, the man seemed cold and stern. “Likely he realized that it wasn’t smart to cast such a curse on ministry grounds and cancelled it. Too late, I’m afraid.”
“You... forgot your box,” Draco said.
“Fine,” Harry reluctantly agreed. He knew it would help him to know various counters to dark spells. Furthermore, of all his professors, Snape was the least likely to cut Harry some slack for having missed classes due to imprisonment. Harry
Harry tried not to be too obvious when they were around other people after those comments, but he found himself slipping when he was alone with the other man. When Draco had gifted James a nightlight that projected stars on to the ceiling, Harry had not been able to stop admiring it. James had developed a fear of the dark, but none of the store-bought nightlights had seemed to help. Draco decided to create his own, and James was finally satisfied with the softer dispersed lights and its ability to play a soft tune if he was still scared. Harry hadn’t been able to stop complimenting Draco’s brilliance that night.
“Alright… but I don’t see how that will help,” Harry stated.
“Yes. Sometimes just talking helps. It distracts you from all the bad things going through your head, you know? I think that’s why they wanted to teach me. It gave them something else to focus on. And I learnt a lot,” Harry said earnestly.
Harry attempted one spell. It fortunately did not unintentionally damage the mirror, but he wasn’t surprised when he only saw himself reflected back at him. There was the slight possibility that it worked but Lucius was asleep and didn’t hear his call, but Harry doubted it. Disappointed, Harry returned to his dorm. As he laid in bed pretending to sleep, Harry went over various spells that had similar effects to what he was attempting, but he was fairly certain he wouldn’t be able to tweak or combine them enough to get the desired results. He needed to research it. It was fortunate everyone assumed Harry would spend Sunday in the library catching up on his schoolwork. No one would think anything was amiss if they found him stressed out and desperately researching all day.
“Can you hold another illusion?” Albert whispered. “Hold the image of the cell right in front of the door as you activate the wards?”
“Still, it’s... it’s my fault,” Harry admitted. He was the one that got her pregnant. “I should have been there.”
“We’ll have you all healed in another minute,” Burke commented. Harry thought it was a rather odd concern for the man that just violated him by putting the unwanted tattoo there in the first place. He didn’t know why the man would care if he was healed or not. Perhaps he would get fired if Harry’s tattoo got infected.
“That’s where Lucius is,” Harry said smartly.
“Luis, go find Dennis and make sure all the dementors are accounted for. Might as well give him an update about what happened here,” the other guard nodded and left. Harry was a little less happy to see him go if only because he was taking Burke’s wand with him.
The great hall grew quiet. Those that had not noticed the ministry employees enter the hall were suddenly notified not only of their presence but also their reason for being there. The students alternated watching the aurors and Harry, who had frozen a few feet from the Gryffindor table.  He stood near Ron and Hermione who had been leaving the hall with him.
“How do you understand this better than me, when I was in the actual lesson?” Ron asked.
“Hmm, there’s that too,” Blaise agreed.
Draco must have felt the attention, as he looked up suddenly and locked eyes with the lurking Gryffindor. Surprised when he spotted Harry, Draco jumped and gained the attention of the other boys. With no more time to plan what to say, Harry resigned himself to winging it. He patted his pocket to confirm the pictures were still there. The last thing he needed was to accidentally hand those over. Harry took a deep breath and made his way over to the Slytherins’ table.
“Don’t think you’re so special, Potter. The minister doesn’t care about
“Not as salty as you,” snarked Harry, before he consciously thought about it. His stomach turned as he looked up at Burke and was reminded of what the man had done to him. Harry stopped eating in fear he’d throw up just at the sight of the man.
His fellow prisoners did not know how to reassure Harry. Lestrange did not mention that what little he knew about horcruxes was not good. Removing the soul from its vessel typically caused irreparable damage to said vessel. There was a chance that the vessel would be unharmed if the soul was removed without using the ritual to return the one that had died. Unfortunately, Lestrange did not remember reading about that, nor if it was even possible to transfer the soul to another vessel. The fact that Harry was a vessel with his own soul would certainly complicate matters further.
“I want to attend my classes,” Harry said. Honestly, he would be happy to skip Snape’s class but he knew this was an all or nothing scenario. Harry kept his voice steady as he plead his case.
“The chances of us having such complications are unlikely,” Draco tried to reassure his fiancé.
“Harry wasn’t given the opportunity to attend those classes. You, on the other hand, choose to daydream instead of paying attention,” Hermione said snidely.
“I can’t,” Harry gasped as he pulled away. He was still so close, he couldn’t miss the flash of hurt that crossed Draco’s face before he started to shut down. Harry’s stomach churned as he realized Draco thought Harry was rejecting
“It was nice meeting you Miss Granger and Mr. Weasley,” Hale said pleasantly before scooping up his daughter in a hug that lifted her feet off the ground. “Goodbye my Munchkin. D, get ready because I’m about to embarrass you in front of your friends,” Hale said before giving his son a hug too. Harry couldn’t help but smile at the softer side of Hale.
“I don’t know how to do this. The Dursleys only showed me how to fuck up a child. I have no clue how to raise a well-adjusted one,” Harry said. Dudley might have grown up knowing he was loved, but he was far from a healthy and functioning member of society.
“And Luna’s interview... well I’m sure you can imagine how that went,” Hermione added. Harry could. Flitwick probably didn’t bother interrupting as much since Luna would talk about nargles and blibbering humdingers. It might have been more frustrating than the professors blocking all questioning attempts.
“Such as?” Harry asked.
There was an awkward pause as both Wiblin and the remaining guard watched Harry from the door to his cell. Clearing his throat, the guard finally decided to close the cell. Harry jumped at the sound of the lock.
Rabastan Lestrange would be gifted a pair of x-ray/telescope glasses. Initially Harry had intended for only let the immediate outside world be visible, but when he tested the glasses himself, he quickly realized how boring the area surrounding Azkaban was. The constant fog made it difficult to see very far, so Harry adjusted the glasses to see distances. It was so successful that the glasses allowed one to see the stars and beyond. Harry hoped that a man that had spent way too many years locked away would appreciate an occasional glimpse of the outside world. Worried that it could still be boring or painful, Harry added a deck of muggle style playing cards. He made the jacks, queens and kings of each suit a historical figure the man had mentioned during his ancient studies lessons.
As they made their way down the corridor, Harry thought Burke was actually walking slower so that Harry could look at each prisoner they passed and they in turn could look at him. Except not all of the prisoners turned towards them. Harry noticed a few vacant stares and wondered if the dementors already sucked out a few souls. A few prisoners do glance his way and Harry noticed most had raised eyebrows and disbelieving looks.
Harry refused to say anything to both men as Burke continued to pat the tattoo for longer than a minute. In fact, as the pain receded completely, Harry became aware that Burke was no longer patting the area so much as caressing it. As his hand passed from one side to the other, he let his pinky drag along Harry’s collarbone. Harry’s unease grew at this new attention. He didn’t forget Burke’s extra attention during his pat down.
He mentally reviewed what he wanted to say as he walked towards the meeting place. He felt confident up until he spotted Hale and another man waiting for him. The second man was a black man roughly around Hale’s age. He was dressed in practical dark grey robes. He held himself in a confident manner without giving off the impression of someone pretentious. He made an interesting contrast standing next to Hale, who even on a casual Saturday managed to embody the wealth and prestige his job afforded him.
“You should be thanking me. I agreed to work overtime just to ensure that you would be settled in,” Burke responded mildly. “Do you know how we help prisoners adjust to their new circumstances?”
“But if it’s any consolation, my friends doubt that he’s marked. They too doubt Vol- you-know-who would mark someone still in school,” Harry attempted to reassure Malfoy despite his own doubts. Although Malfoy was wearing his best poker face, he seemed paler and more drawn than Harry could remember seeing him. Including the times just before dementors started patrolling their hallways. Faced with Draco’s father’s clear concern, Harry almost felt guilty about his suspicions.
“You think he’s been marked?” Malfoy asked breathlessly.
Draco let Harry absorb his words. A few more tears fell, but Harry didn’t pull away to wipe his face. He just watched Draco and Draco watched him.
“Er, actually, yes, sort of anyway,” Harry admitted awkwardly. He tried to think of a way to make it less creepy. “I figured you’d want
“You’re back,” said Dean. There was a round of pleasantries where they asked how Harry was doing and Harry did the same. However, it didn’t take long for Seamus’ lack of tact to drive him to ask what he really wanted to know.
“Right, well we all understand why you would
“She... she told us...” Mrs. Weasley said haltingly. He thought her difficulty in speaking was because of her grief, but when Harry glanced back at her he saw worry instead.
“Draco... there is something you need to know. If you really want to marry me, you should know this beforehand...” Harry said.
“Harry?” Harry heard Lucius’ voice call to him, but when he turned back around, Draco still had the mirror angled towards him with a look of wonder.
“Yeah, well, that wasn’t me. I mean, I wasn’t controlling it. I’m usually treated to my worst memories,” Harry said. He realized he probably shouldn’t be so candid with death eaters, but the entire situation was freaking him out. What could the dementors possibly want with him? “It was one of the dementors that stopped it. He stated he
The auror took two steps towards Harry before Dumbledore’s voice rang across the hall causing the auror to pause momentarily.
“So...” Zabini eventually broke the silence. He looked inexplicably exasperated when Harry turned his attention to him. He was looking between Harry and Draco as if he expected one of them to fill in the awkward silence. When neither did, he rolled his eyes and stated, “I noticed you weren’t in Defense today.”
a prison…” Ron said slowly. Harry knew this sentiment would be the biggest challenge he’ll face. The wizengamot had basically said the same thing when Harry had brought it up during his trial.
To take his mind off of Burke, Harry glanced at Anton and his meagre bag of possessions. Possessions he was sure he probably won’t want back after this whole ordeal. Harry felt happy that that he’d left his bag in his dorm and both his invisibility cloak and map are safe from the ministry’s hands. Perkins handed over Harry’s wand, and Harry watched as it joined his other items in the bag. Fortunately no one snapped it.
“Attention! Attention!” yelled one of the guards, interrupting the potions review. The man followed up with a series of banging noises. It sounded as if someone was passing a metal bar across the cell’s bars. The noise grew louder as the guard came closer to Harry’s cell. He didn’t pause as he continued down the hallway, but he was walking slow enough that Harry realized the noise came from the man’s wand rather than a physical tool. Harry was grateful that the guards didn’t carry metal batons, like the muggle police had, despite knowing their wands were capable of just as much damage.
Bradley handed the forms back to Anton. There was a slight gasp before the man was glancing at Harry’s forehead, no doubt looking for the scar, but as Harry expected, he did not make any comments about who the newest Azkaban prisoner was or question why this whole thing was happening. By now, Harry was pretty sure no one is going to speak on his behalf.
“What about the one in you?” Draco asked, worried what effects the horcrux attached to Harry for years might have done to him.
“No,” Harry said. “Dolph just isn’t shy about his feelings for his wife. And Mulciber helped him write the raunchy one.”
“Then they shouldn’t leave the door wide open, hmmm?” Harry asked, mimicking Burke’s own speech pattern. “We didn’t break in so much as walk in. If the ministry is so concerned about us being there they probably shouldn’t have
“Harry, will you-”
“Who the hell is Wren?” asked a confused Harry.
“Don’t you?” Harry asked. Andromeda and Draco, and by extension Narcissa, were the ones who saw the most natural interactions between Harry and James.
“North Sea,” answered Bradley gruffly.
“We said everything we needed to. Besides, I know I’ll get to speak to him again soon,” Theo said. “However, there’s someone who wants to speak to you.”
people like you. I make sure you get what you
“No need to bother her over a couple of outstanding forms. I figured it would be less disruptive to come see Harry after his classes than to have him come to me during standard office hours. Unless of course, you feel you can spare him during the hours your class?” Hale asked. Snape made a hmmm sound in response.
Harry was astonished by the fact that the guards were buying the story. They had no reason to assume differently since no wizard had taken a soul like a dementor could before. There was no reason for any of the guards to assume Harry was the culprit. And yet, his fear was insisting that it must be obvious. Harry was clearly not behaving normally. How could he when he felt Burke’s soul with every inch of his body? Harry found it hard to believe that there was no outward sign of his internal struggle.
“I can’t always control it,” Harry admitted. “If I concentrate, like with the rocks, I can easily do the magic... but it also happens when I don’t intend to. Like with the light spell last night. I’d just thought that it needed to be brighter and suddenly we were blinded by light. I didn’t mean to cast the spell, it just happened because I
It took a bit of maneuvering with some transfigured mirrors, but Harry was able to see into Crabbe and Lestrange’s cells to activate their wards. Unfortunately for the others, their wards would could only be activated the next time Harry was in the hallway. Luckily the chalk lines were faint enough that they should avoid detection.
“Very well,” McGonagall said. After another awkward offer to talk, which Harry declined, the two parted ways. Harry could feel her concerned gaze track his departure. He didn’t dare stay. Once her guilt and concern faded, she would remember that Harry had gone to the trial to support a known Death Eater. He didn’t want to see her concern turn to anger.
Once the box was ready, Crabbe and Nott handed over the letters they had already written. Both had written their sons' names on the letter so that they could be properly distributed once the box was full.
Suddenly it stopped. The sudden silence was jarring.
“Er, he insisted I learn proper posture and some politics. That was exactly as boring as it sounds,” Harry said and was glad when Ron immediately commiserated with him. However, Hermione wasn’t distracted and took to quizzing Harry about various subjects. When she was done, she stated she was satisfied that the Death Eaters hadn’t purposely misinformed him.
“Seems Jugson agrees with the boy,” stated Lucius. As one, they turned to watch Jugson leave the shower area. Unlike Harry, he didn’t seem bothered by his nakedness and walked casually around the room until he found one of the remaining uniforms.
Harry did not know enough about curses to follow Voldemort in how he went about protecting his horcruxes. There would be no point in trying to secretly pull that information from Voldemort like he had with how to make a horcrux. The man would know how to circumvent any security Harry put in place. He knew he could ask Hermione for help, or ask her to wear it, but frankly he didn’t want to. He couldn’t bring himself to explain what he’d done. He couldn’t lose her like he’d lost Ron. He didn’t want to see fear or disgust on her face every time she’d be forced to interact with him. Besides, he figured she’d be a terrible choice to carry his horcrux since she was always with him. He didn’t like thinking about it, but there was a good chance she’d be captured or killed with him.
questions, ask them now or we will move on to sentencing.”
“But who are-” Harry started to protest, wondering just what sort of criminals Burke planned to place him with.
With a wicked smile, Ginny asked “I guess that means I can’t ask how big
Harry transfigured more rocks into parchment, roughly the size of a standard muggle photo. He focused on a new memory. When he opened his eyes, Draco’s smile greeted him. Harry sucked in a breath as a sense of longing hit him hard. It was no wonder Lestrange sounded so grateful for his photo.
Harry quickly fell into a routine. Lucius would start their morning with a pop quiz. If Harry remembered a spell that he had covered earlier in the year, he would tell them so they could review the theory and practice the wand movements. Similarly, if Harry remembered a potion he had worked on, or a magical creature he covered in class, that would be reviewed before any new content was covered. Most of the day was spent on Harry’s lessons. Harry would call it a day when he started to feel overwhelmed. His tutors usually respected this, but occasionally Lucius or Albert would push him to keep going. Harry wondered if their sons felt just as much pressure to live up to their expectations.
“It slowly peels up the toenails and then rolls them up. Before the nails can detach, they uncurl and reset properly in the foot. After a minute the process starts again,” explained Malfoy. Harry had unconsciously shifted and protectively placed his feet under his bum.
“Why?” Harry asked.
“No I’m not,” Harry said defensively. Both Malfoy and Albert looked amused by his protests.
“I can’t believe you’re actually going to read up on ancient runes for fun,” Ron said after Hermione promised to look for her old notes once they got back to the common room. In the meantime, she gave him a couple of book titles he could find while they were in the library. Harry just shrugged at Ron and didn’t bother explaining he didn’t want to let a bunch of Death Eaters down by slacking and letting their efforts go to waste.
“But-”
“How so?” Draco asked and nibbled on a biscuit from the dessert plate Andromeda left out for them.
“Mate, if Azkaban is so bad that even Umbridge doesn’t deserve it, then it probably really is too much,” Ron said. Harry blinked a few times at Ron’s sudden agreement, but it was a huge weigh off Harry’s shoulders when he realized Ron was genuinely on board to help Harry with his Goliath-sized campaign for prison reform.
“And how are you liking your own space? I hope you’re finding the accommodations to your liking,” Burke asked.
Harry saw that several heads nodded in agreement, but several wizengamot members stubbornly pressed on with questions aimed to highlight Harry’s guilt. Hale, equally stubborn, jumped in each time before Harry was forced to answer. Hale appeared to relish in the opportunity to chastise each person. Harry barely managed to keep a straight face as Hale snidely said “since Mr. Tetley seems to have forgotten his memory potion this morning, let me remind you...”, “Mr. Runecraft seems to be confused about how the judicial process works,” and “Madame Ito, perhaps you could consult the court transcripts if you weren’t paying attention the first time.” It became obvious to tell which wizengamot members wanted Harry to return to Azkaban as they were increasingly frustrated. The rest of the audience appeared amused by Hale’s comments.
“I don’t know,” Lucius sounded both frustrated and desperate. “If I can contact Narcissa-”
“Who would you say was the leader?” asked Hale.
“Don’t worry; we’re bound for a shower soon,” Nott added after a moment. He had probably meant it to be encouraging but Harry suddenly realized it would bring a whole new set of problems. It was embarrassing contemplating taking care of his bowel movements in front of two death eaters. He didn’t know how he would deal with being naked surrounded by a dozen of them. He could picture Dudley snidely telling him not to drop the soap.
That was true. It seemed to roughly occupy the same amount of space Draco’s had. Even if Harry added up all the thin blank spaces between the healthy spots, it wouldn’t take up half the space.
“Draco, I, fuck, it’s just... there are multiple steps, you see, and I-”
don’t want me, then that’s one thing. But I’m perfectly capable of deciding who I want.”
Andromeda was surprised, but willing to support him. Harry thought she was reluctantly hopeful about reconnecting with her family. As she watched Harry pushed through the first few hurdles, she told him she was grateful he didn't immediately give up when encountering resistance. Harry would be the first to admit he hadn't expected as much trouble as he got. Part of him thought his relationship with Kingsley would make the progress easy. Unfortunately, the minister wasn't eager to appear soft against Death Eaters so soon after the war.
“What are
“I requested the right to collect the memory, but nothing held Harry to providing it,” Hale responded.
“Did you really cast an unforgivable curse?” asked Albert, cutting into Harry’s internal debate on whether the mattress in the cell was better or worse than the one he was stuck using every summer.
When Harry saw Lucius and Albert yawn for the umpteenth time, he suggested they call it a night. He selfishly wanted them to stay up and distract him from everything that had happened. Harry did not feel tired and couldn’t imagine how he’d fall asleep in the same spot Burke had attacked him in. However, these men had been generous enough with him. It was odd but Harry felt more guilty for keeping them up late than he did for eating Burke’s soul in the first place.
This transitioned into exploring variations of the spell. Lucius’ grandfather had used a pair of glasses to see wards. Many curse breakers often used a variation of the spell that allowed them to see what branches of magic were placed on an object.
“This is lovely, Harry. Thank you,” the man said.
“Yes,” Harry answered truthfully. There was no point in lying about that since it was already known the man was marked, and Harry would have seen it in Azkaban’s showers.
“Help,” Harry whispered roughly. “Get... im... off...” Harry tried to plead even though it hurt to talk.
“Yes,” Harry answered.
“Harry, I know the ritual.
“We’re not. We’re just friends,” Harry said.
“I didn’t want to. I tried to pretend I didn’t even think of it. But then. This man – snatcher – a bunch of them found Hermione and me. We split up but one followed me when I apparated. He splinched himself. I don’t know if I could have saved him, but I didn’t try. I didn’t even try, Draco. Instead I used him to...” Harry’s voiced trailed off before he could confess.
“We may never know for sure,” Draco said one day while he and Harry cuddled on their bedroom floor with Harry’s soul projected above them. He’d run every test he could think of and had no conclusive answers. The next step would be to observe James, or to consult outside help but that might also mean letting them know what Harry had done.
“Where are we?” Harry asked. He wondered if the aurors had taken him to the middle of nowhere to dispose of him. It suddenly occurred to him that he was alone with them and at their mercy. They could tell the world that Harry fought them, maybe even that he escaped so they would have time to hide his body.
Burke. What else can it be?” Harry despaired.
“Harry?” Lucius asked as he stared at the rocks. A few parted to reveal Harry’s face. He blinked at Lucius slowly before he glanced up and noted the low light coming from the cell’s window.
“Anyone know soul magic?” asked Lucius.
Over time, Lucius and Harry’s interaction became easy. Not enough for Harry to feel like Lucius approved of him, but enough that he no longer dreaded having to spend time with the man. Draco had been exceedingly amused when they started attending quidditch matches together. The first time it happened was because Draco felt ill and suggested his father take his place at the match. Harry would have preferred to ask Ron, but Draco had made the suggestion in front of his parents. Narcissa had jumped on to the idea, and both men were left awkwardly agreeing. Apparently rooting for the same team, insulting the moves of the opposing team, and fanboying over well-executed maneuvers was enough to make the experience enjoyable. Enough that it kept happening, and Harry even found himself fire-calling Lucius to discuss the overseas matches they didn’t attend in person. It wasn’t the sort of friendship people wrote poetry about, but it was a vast improvement from where they’d started.
“That’s not what I said. And you accuse me of being a drama queen,” Draco rolled his eyes. “Look, Potter, we all have our demons. There is so much I regret, and plenty more people telling me I should feel bad about even more things that were out of my control. I’m not miserable, but I’m not the happy child I was before the dark lord returned. I’m not going to pretend to be either. If you’re not OK, it’s not your duty to pretend you are so other people feel better about themselves. You hide enough of it in front of the children, but no one has a right to ask you to bottle it all up. Be upset; work through your shit, and if you need help ask for it. Your friends will support you.”
“Very well. I’m here when you’re ready. I’ve been told I have a very comfy shoulder to cry on,” Dumbledore said amicably. Harry nodded. He was still upset about the possibility that Dumbledore already
“In a moment,” Burke said carelessly. “When I’m done with him.”
The only downside to these days were the increased visits from the dementors. Two dementors were constantly popping by to visit Harry and ask questions. One dementor introduced himself. To Harry, his name sounded like Ash-er-rath. He was the first dementor Harry had met in Azkaban. He introduced his mate as Ish-an-ders. Their interest still made Harry nervous, but he was keenly aware of Crabbe’s pitiful whimpers next door, so he willingly answered their questions. The questions seemed random and Harry couldn’t figure out why they would want to know things like his favourite colour or food. It was obvious they weren’t asking just to get to know Harry, but he couldn’t tell how knowing Harry had a weakness for treacle tart would provide any insight into whatever was going on. They had yet to explain to Harry why they found him so interesting.
“You – you can’t do this,” Harry said.
“It’s only until your trial date can be set up,” Perkins tried to reassure him. It didn’t help. Harry knew all too well that someone could be forgotten in the wizarding prison. After all, Sirius had stayed in Azkaban for over a decade without ever receiving a trial.
“What are you doing here?” Stan asked. Since he wasn’t yet fully dressed, Harry got a good look at his forearm. There was no dark mark.
“How was your first day back, my boy?” Dumbledore asked.
“Wait a moment,” Albert cut in before Harry could so much as shift. “How are you?”
The other prisoners were quiet as they absorbed that information. Harry scrunched his sheets nervously as he waited for their verdict. He wanted to put the rest of his clothes on but was worried that if he moved the too-full feeling would overwhelm him again.
“This is crazy! I’m not going to go around practicing unforgivables,” Harry said. “If I have to mean it for the curse to work, then I would need to want to hurt the person I’m casting it on. Aside from Bellatrix, I don’t really want to hurt anyone like that.”
“I doubt that, Potter. Why don’t you tell me, and I can show you how wrong you are,” Draco suggested.
Under the curious and watchful eyes of Albert and Lucius, Harry had put the box together. He applied the shrinking and enlarging charms, though he did not use 'Harry Malfoy' as the password. "Stag," Harry said pointedly.
Harry didn’t know how long it took him to tease out the soul, but he was patient. He sent his magic out so that it gathered Burke’s soul and nudged it up and out of the man’s mouth. Harry couldn’t help but marvel at his success when a glowing white orb floated just past Burke’s lips. Later Harry would wonder how someone as revolting as Burke could still have such a pure-looking soul. For now, he just took a moment to observe the soul hovering between him and Burke.
“I’m not going to hurt you,” Wiblin seemed offended that Harry assumed he would go to such an extreme. Harry let out a harsh sound that could only loosely be called a laugh. One of his hands unclenched from the sheets and covered the area where the tattoo Burke and Wiblin had force upon him was. It served to remind Wiblin that Harry had no reason to trust the man. The closer Wiblin tried to get, the more Harry became aware of his magic ready to rise to his defense. As much as Harry wanted to lash out at the man, he knew it wasn’t the smartest move. His inner Hermione was urging him to hold back on those impulses. So far it seemed like he was getting away with what he did to Burke, but if he cursed the guards then he’d be in trouble once again.
“I’m aware,” Harry parroted back. Usually when his uncle said much the same to him, Vernon was satisfied to hear Harry agree. When Harry was younger, he had tried sticking up for himself, but that only lead to more chores or being sent to his cupboard. Eventually Harry discovered that if he agreed with Vernon then the man would decide he’d filled his daily quota of making Harry miserable. Harry wondered if the same strategy might work with Burke. In a lot of ways Burke reminded him of Vernon; they both had the same misplaced sense of superiority. Unlike Vernon, Burke wasn’t satisfied with Harry’s insincere agreement. Instead it seemed to pull all the air out of Burke’s sails, which pissed him off more.
“Come on now,” Burke spoke over him. There was clear anger in his voice now and his grip on Harry’s arm was bruising. A sharp tug pulled Harry forward and he stumbled.
“You’re not special,” Burke pressed as if repeating it would somehow hurt Harry more.
“What...” Harry stammered. He raised one hand to lightly pat Crabbe’s upper back. “Glad I could help... He really misses you,” Harry said, uncertain about what else to say.
“Hands on the table, Potter,” Wiblin ordered. Harry was mortified as he was patted down to make sure Reginald hadn’t sneaked him some contraband items. Once satisfied, the guards spelled Harry’s hands behind his back. As Wiblin was pulling him from the room, Harry heard the click of a picture being taken. Both Harry and the guard turned to look at Reginald who had the camera pointed at them. Harry didn’t like it, but trusted Reginald by now. The reason Reginald took his picture at the start of the interview was because Harry was still tense and uncomfortable. That would come through in the pictures. Harry was tense again because Wiblin was holding him tightly. It brought back bad memories. However, at the click of the camera, the guard loosened his hold. He was more cautious as he led Harry back to his cell.
“You were fighting for your life, and the lives of many others. Whatever it is, you had valid reasons,” Draco insisted.
The hallway was soon filled with pitiful moans. Harry thought the other prisoners sounded even more pained than they had the previous evening, though Harry himself remained unaffected. Even Malfoy and Nott in their animal forms were huddled in the back of their cells. Harry finally got a good look at Nott’s animagus form and it was a porcupine.
“You can’t mean that,” said Tetley incredulously.
“Which one?” pressed Lestrange but Harry still held his tongue.
Harry lingered in the shelves, watching them, and he tried to think of what to say to Draco specifically. Unfortunately, he could only think about how tired Draco looked and mentioning that was unlikely to go over well. Harry itched to comfort him but had no idea how to go about it in a way that wouldn’t be rejected.
“Why didn’t you?” asked Dumbledore mildly.
Desperate for something happy to think about, Harry tried to focus on Draco. Unfortunately, Harry got hung up on the disastrous scene in the library. He felt he’d wasted the perfect opportunity to impress Draco and hopefully get closer to him. For fuck’s sake, he’d admitted to stalking him like some creep. Even if Draco miraculously overlooked that, there was the whole Burke issue to consider. Logically Harry knew what happened wasn’t his fault. Burke was a sorry excuse of a man and his actions didn’t reflect who Harry was. Albert had repeated this fact to him multiple times following the attack. Harry had believed him, but every so often doubts came back. It made Harry feel weak, dirty, and scared that any future relationship he tried to build would be tainted by it. Harry used to get an excited thrill imagining being in bed with someone on top of him. Now, Burke lurked in the background and Harry was terrified about what would happen if he ever found himself in that position again.
“What I’m confused about when
“How can we help?” asked Crabbe. Immense gratitude chased away his self-pity. He knew he should be troubled by why these men weren’t disturbed by the knowledge that Harry ate someone’s
It took Scrimgeour a minute to get everyone to settle down. The man looked resigned as he went through the motions of adjourning the trial.
“Why?” asked Draco.
They eventually arrived at a room that surprisingly reminded Harry of the muggle police stations he’d seen on the telly. There were no cells in view, but there was a man seated behind a desk. There were a few chairs, though no prisoners were handcuffed to them. Slightly to the right of the man behind the desk were steel bars that Harry figured must led to the cells.
“Er no, I didn’t take that either,” Harry said suddenly feeling self-conscious. “I am taking herbology.”
“It’s my dad’s handwriting,” Crabbe said in amazement.
The papers were split. As Kingsley anticipated, a good portion of the public was not keen on pardoning any Death Eater. However, Harry was still the Boy who Lived (Twice) which garnered support or at least a willingness to listen. He might not have been the one to kill Voldemort in the end, but it was common knowledge that Harry, Ron and Hermione had spent the war weakening Voldemort.
“Of course,” Harry said before Snape could respond to that.
“Do you know why you survived the killing curse?” Draco asked one day. It was one of the many questions he’d asked in relation to his research, but it was the first one Harry understood could be connected to soul magic theory.
Special thanks to imweirdthatsok & Ruby_slipper_of_iowa who suggested various ways for Harry to help Lucius communicate with Draco. I went with the suggestion of having Lucius ask for paper to write his son a letter. I planned for Harry to help Lucius communicate with Draco later on in the story. Having him write a letter now means we can imagine that Lucius included some subtle encouragement for his son to date Harry – makes Harry’s job easier once he’s back in school!
“It was my pleasure,” Hale said. Before they could say more, Perkins walked up to them to return Harry’s belongings. He didn’t much care about his school robes, but he reverently held his wand once it was returned in one piece.
Harry had expected Lucius Malfoy’s mocking face to greet him, looking much like his son had in third year. Instead an even nastier surprise was waiting for him.
They let Harry leave shortly after. He was tired by the time he got to the common room. He wanted nothing more than to sleep the rest of the day away, but since he no longer could sleep, he had no escape. Harry debated pretending to go to sleep just avoid everyone, but as soon as he spotted his friends, he knew they weren’t done with him yet.
“Where are we going to find these children?” asked Harry.
Harry spent a significant amount of time nitpicking at the design, but actually was happy with his creation by the time he finally set it down. He started to prepare for making a matching brush, but hesitated. Considering the lifestyle his parents had been able to provide, Draco likely had no shortage of beautiful knickknacks. Harry’s mirror was probably equivalent to a preschooler’s drawing compared to the mirrors Draco could purchase from high end boutiques. Harry sat back with a groan and reconsidered his gift.
Harry was trying not to shiver but couldn’t stop it completely. The cell was cold and his prisoner uniform was doing little to fight against the cold. Harry was also pretty sure his shaking was partly due to fear. Harry wanted to break down but refused to do so in front of a bunch of death eaters so he fought the urge to cry and scream. He wasn’t sure how long he would be able to hold out but he hoped he could make it until the others feel asleep.
“Watch it, Nott. It’d be a shame to inform your judicial-wizard that you could not make your date because you were in solitary confinement,” threaten Burke. Nott’s sneer became more pronounced, but he didn’t reply. Harry was glad that the man remained close to them.
,” one of the dementors stated.
“Potter fought him off initially. It seemed... I thought Harry would not be able hold him off any longer, but then the dementor arrived,” Lucius briefly paused, and Harry tensed waiting for the truth to come out. “The dementor might have assumed Burke was trying to escape with the boy,” Lucius suggested. Attempted escapes were usually the only time the dementors could kiss someone without ministry approval.
“Potter?” asked Draco in confusion.
“I don’t know what you could possibly mean,” hedged Harry, but smiled for the first time that day.
Nott looked it over and nodded a few times. “It might work if you had both mirrors,” he hypothesized.
“He also agreed to send a certain guard a little present...” Nott smirked. “I might have mentioned that Burke deserved a nice bouquet of Shy Tortoise Hyacinth. It should arrive with his morning post.”
Harry didn’t know how he felt about what he was just told. On the one hand, if he got to leave prison sooner, he wouldn’t care much if they started the trial without him. But on the other hand, he wouldn’t be able to defend himself beyond the statements he’d already given to Hale.
It eventually dawned on him that he felt normal because he was holding on to the ring. While separated, the two pieces still felt right by maintaining their proximity. Despite his worries he’d grow unstable, Harry knew he couldn’t hold on to the ring forever. The whole point of creating it was to have a backup. It would be stupid and a waste if he died with it on him, completely unprotected.
“Yeah?” Harry asked.
“Miss Granger?” he asked.
“Just make sure there are no more unforgivables, Potter,” Perkins said lightly.
“Wait… are you saying- did you use an unforgiveable on my wife?” the man asked letting Harry know that the Lestrange next to him was in fact the one married to Bellatrix. As far as Harry knew, the other Lestrange brother wasn’t married. Harry didn’t answer him and refused to look at either Malfoy or Nott in case his guilt was plainly written on his face. His silence was probably just as damning.
By the time Harry has calmed down enough to be aware of his surroundings, he noticed that the rest of the Weasleys and Hermione had left to give them privacy. Harry was grateful that they’d taken the baby with them, though he immediately felt guilty for thinking it.
Once dressed, Harry noted that his sweater didn’t cover his Azkaban serial number. It made him nervous, but short of committing to an entire wardrobe of turtlenecks, there wasn’t anything he could do. With his shoulders hunched, made his way to the owlery. He had some letters to deliver and it would be best to do so before anyone noticed and asked questions.
The prisoners all ate their breakfast quickly after Harry spelled the food to taste better. Even Harry ate his full share. He hadn’t felt hungry, but he must have used enough of Burke’s soul on his gifts that the thought of food didn’t make him feel nauseated. Harry resolved not to feel guilty about that.
“Relax Weasley. I’m here for Potter,” Nott said. His comment did not settle Ron in the least.
They asked if Albert ever told Harry what he’d do if he was released. Harry said he didn’t know Albert’s plans, but he obviously missed his son just as much as Theo missed his dad, so he’d likely try to contact him. Hale gave him a miniscule nod at his response.
horcruxes during our second year. It drained her energy and possessed her to get stronger,” Harry said.
Given the minister's visit, Lucius was keen to go over the finer points of politics. While Harry was onboard to complain about Fudge and Scrimgeour's failings, he found the historical perspective Lucius provided to be dry. He tried to focus. He knew that it was useful information given the oppositional stance he had with the ministry now. Unfortunately, the subject couldn't hold his interest for long. Fortunately he wasn't the only one.
Harry passed Nott the outline he and Hermione had started. Nott looked it over carefully. He offered only a couple of suggestions, but even Hermione agreed they should be added so Ron didn’t accuse their classmate of sabotaging them. Nott asked a few questions about some of the points, and it dawned on Harry he was trying to ask about his dad without being direct. Hermione’s suspicion softened once she realized it too.
Mrs. Weasley was patient with him as she taught him how to properly care for a baby. He was uncomfortable holding the child, but he did it because it was not fair to ask the Weasleys to do it. Still, his reluctance must have shown because each of the Weasleys gave him concerned looks at one point or another. Only Hermione had been willing to call him out on it. He still couldn’t explain the horcrux, so he settled for revealing a different truth; one that would have made him nervous had James actually been his son instead of a horcrux.
“Don’t you? I thought you said it moved from the ring to James,” Draco said confused.
“You need to consider them now. Have a plan before it’s time-”
. What was that about?” asked Lucius once the guards had moved on.
When Harry saw a large B displayed at the end of the hallway, he wondered if they were transferring him to the other ward. However, Burke stopped in front of a door just before block B started. Unlike the other rooms they passed along the way, this one didn’t seem to have a large window allowing them to see into it.
“Harry?” asked Hermione.
“You sure?” asked Ron.
“No?” Draco asked. He was more confused than hurt, but rapidly sliding into the latter.
“I’ll say when I stop. That’s my point. You convicts have no power.
Harry’s chest felt tight, but he couldn’t say if that was from suspecting Lucius was plotting, or from believing Lucius trusted him with Draco’s happiness. Either way, it ground their conversation to a halt. Even Mulciber and the Lestrange brothers let the conversation die out. In the resulting quiet, Harry kept imagining how he could convince Draco for both a date and to hideout at grimmauld place.
. You tethered your soul to a particular object. It would need another ritual to transfer it to something else, or someone else, I guess,” Draco said.
“Mixed,” Albert said. “The ministry made some last-minute changes to their witnesses and experts. Probably hoped to throw Reginald off. Bastards clearly coached them all on what to say,” Albert recounted.
,” Draco sounded devastated, but instead of marching out the door and out of Harry’s life, he blindly grasped for Harry’s hand, unable to look away from the display in front of them. “I knew... It makes sense you’d have some scars.”
As the other men started recounting their own Hogwarts quidditch days, Lucius was eventually pulled into the conversation. Harry learnt that he and Mr. Weasley started their animosity on the quidditch pitch. Harry hadn’t even known Mr. Weasley had played quidditch. He probably should have guessed given how many of his children played the sport.
“I know this can be hard to talk about, so I got legal permission to extract and use your memory of the attack,” Hale stated.
“Yes. Pansy isn’t going to do anything that would hurt Draco, Greg won’t hurt Vince, and Blaise can be bought,” Theo explained.
“He’s got a point,” Lucius added. “We don’t yet know enough about horcruxes. If we can research them and understand the theory, we may be able to safely move the dark lord’s soul.” Even though the man didn’t outright offer his own library and was careful not to mention what would happen to the soul shard once removed from Harry, Harry felt Lucius was just as invested in saving Harry as Crabbe.
“That was fast,” Harry said in surprise.
“Right. I thought I’d sneak in tonight and check,” Harry confessed.
Perkins sat comfortably beside him, though he was watching the scenery go by rather than Harry. The still-nameless auror was sitting across from Harry and watched him suspiciously. His wand was out and aimed at Harry as if he expected Harry to either attack him or jump out of the carriage at any moment. To be fair, Harry was considering both options but didn’t think the odds would be in his favour.
“It won’t – I can’t-” Harry stammered. He didn’t know how to explain. He couldn’t tell Hale why the memory would do more damage than good.
“But at the time, it felt like your best option. You didn’t create it in some misguided attempt at immortality. You knew it would have negative repercussions, and you’d have to live with it, but you did it anyway just for the chance to keep fighting for your friends. You would damn yourself over and over again to save the people you love. It’s an admirable quality. One I don’t want to encourage, mind you, but it’s admirable,” Draco said. He waited until Harry returned his stare and added, “how could I not love you?”
“Harry...” she started as Harry gathered James’ things.
Harry's heart broke for the man. "Do you want to add more to the message I'll give him the next time I see him?" he asked. It wasn't ideal as Harry might forget a part of it.
“He saved me. They didn’t,” Harry shrugged.
“It’s dark magic.
“Can I help?” Nott asked after he considered Harry’s words.
“Welcome back,” Neville said. He didn’t hug Harry, but he smiled welcomingly.
“I don’t understand,” Draco said, unable to confirm that Harry’s son would be alright. He didn’t know how James was part of Harry’s biggest secret. He thought whatever it was happened long before James was born.
“Time to pat him down,” said Burke and stepped towards Harry. He ran his hands down Harry’s sides more thoroughly than the auror did when he was arrested. It made Harry feel rather uncomfortable. When he reached Harry’s trousers and felt a bump near the pockets, Burke reached into each pocket and pulled items out.
Harry had the most trouble with his new subjects. Alchemy was interesting but Albert and Harry found themselves limited. Harry had a hard time memorizing formulas and working through equations without the ability to take notes. Harry could tell Albert was frustrated. He couldn’t shake the feeling he was letting the man down and felt horrible about it.
Before anyone could question his odd behaviour, the box started to enlarge. Once it had grown to its full size, Harry awkwardly added “missing you” and internally insulted his past self for choosing such a sappy password. It was still less embarrassing than
“But... how?” Harry asked, because it didn’t make sense. Even if James wasn’t his horcrux, how could his soul return to him? That didn’t happen when Voldemort’s horcruxes were destroyed.
It only got worse the more the guards travelled down the hall. They didn’t name every prisoner, but Harry definitely recognized a few Death Eater names. He wouldn’t be surprised if the entire department of mysteries arrestees were all in the same block.
“I know that. But they’re more than just the-” Harry cut himself off as his eyes landed on Neville, noting his suddenly pale complexion. With Ron and Hermione, Harry could
“Right, because that worked out so well for me this time,” Harry said and gestured around him.
“Do you think we can all write letters?” Crabbe asked softly.
“You didn’t,” Hermione said with a laugh.
“Alright, alright,” Harry said. He paused before adding a “thank you.”
“I accidentally revealed something personal that I had no intention of sharing,” Harry said. Theo raised an eyebrow at Harry’s vague answer so Harry quickly moved on with his recap.
Not that he acted on his feelings. He’d done enough damage to Ginny. He didn’t deserve a second chance; especially since he wasn’t sure he or his horcrux wouldn’t unintentionally hurt Draco in some unforeseen way. He was content to bask in Draco’s friendship, and let that be enough.
“I’ll be back for you soon, Potter,” Burke promised.
“Yeah,” he said when he was satisfied he hadn’t damaged with wand with the force of the spell. Snape’s unexpected touch had made him loose focus on the feeling of his magic and how much effort he put into casting. Consequently, a lot of energy had been channeled through his wand. It partly explained the large amount of damage done to the wall. The second reason being that Harry had accidentally cast a dark arts spell that Rodolphus had taught him. The spell was intended for living beings, but Harry had been unwilling to practice casting it on Lestrange. Harry had practiced it by aiming at the wall separating their cells, so he knew what the effects looked like when cast on inanimate objects. He really hoped he was the only one. He could pass it off as a fluke; just a strong burst of energy. He’d rely on Snape’s low opinion of him to actually work in his favour for once.
“I, I, OK. It’s because I thought I was going to die. Dumbledore said I was the only one who could kill Voldemort, but I didn’t know if I would survive long enough to do it. He found a way he could keep coming back, you see, and we couldn’t figure out how to undo it. There were just so many to find, right? And even if we found them, we had to somehow destroy them,” Harry said. He wanted Draco to understand how desperate he’d been.
Harry used the bar of soap in his cell to at least wash his face. He didn’t have a mirror, but he could feel some pimples popping up due to lack of hygiene and the stress of being sent to Azkaban. He was rather glad that his breakfast that morning came with a new bar of soap, even if it was about the same size as the bars provided in muggle hotel rooms.
“Holy shit!” Harry exclaimed when his own reflection gave way to show Lucius’ face. They blinked at each other in surprise. Harry recovered first and gave Lucius what was possibly the biggest smile Harry had ever given anyone.
“It seems Potter is woefully unaware of some of the nastier spells in existence,” added Malfoy.
“Right... but just in case,” Harry said.
He saw the anger, and then the pain that crossed Draco’s face. “Potter, that’s bullshit and you know it.”
“Hold still now,” Burke admonished. “it’d be a shame if it was all sloppy.”
It occurred to Harry that the man probably thought Harry had done the same given he barely had any facial hair to speak of. “Oh,” Harry blushed.
“James is mine,” Draco insisted. Harry felt his heart soar. His feelings surrounding James were still a mess. He couldn’t look at James without being reminded of the horcrux but took care not to let his self-hatred spread to the child. Even now, he couldn’t offer affection as easily as Draco, and thus appreciated everything Draco did even more.
“The kind that hurts others,” Harry said. Hermione deflated at that, and suddenly everyone understood how the Dursleys might have been mentioned. They were still confused about how Albert knew about them in the first place, but weren’t sure if the should ask Harry about it.
“OK,” he said eventually.
“Calm your tits, Mulciber. I made something for all of you,” Harry retorted.
“Then why risk it?” Harry asked.
Eventually Lucius asked to speak to Harry privately. Harry expected the man to warn him away from his son. Instead, Lucius told him he would not interfere so long as Harry kept making Draco happy. He followed it up with a rather a scary shovel talk – one only a former death eater could give weight to. Harry knew it wasn’t just a front like other fathers would give to their child’s boyfriend. Harry was pretty sure Mr. Malfoy had killed someone before and likely knew exactly how to hide the body. Still, if it ever came to it – if Harry actually hurt Draco enough that his family sought revenge, it wasn’t Lucius Malfoy that Harry was leery of. His wife on the other hand would be truly terrifying.
“Oh, come and stir my cauldron, and if you do it right,” sang Mulciber suddenly, drawing everyone’s attention to him. He swayed his hips as he continued, “I’ll boil you up some hot strong love to keep you warm tonight.”
“Great. Let’s start with going through the steps needed to create a horcrux,” Draco said, Harry blanched immediately.
“What hap – sweet Morgana!” one guard exclaimed as he looked into Harry’s cell. The light from the lumos he’d cast illuminated the awful scene. The man’s eyes were focused on Burke’s bare arse.
“Heal,” Snape sneered.
After a moment, Harry decided he was too tired of Azkaban not to take the chance. He didn’t know if Dumbledore, and likely Ron and Hermione were making any strides in getting him released. If Nott could help by gaining public sympathy for him, it would probably help Dumbledore more than hinder him.
“How would this work?” asked Harry.
“What for?” asked Harry.
“Er, I think it’s a muggle thing,” warned Harry.
“It’s no problem. Really,” Harry reassured him. He honestly didn’t know how Hale would make it work, but a large part of Harry hoped it was successful. Death Eater or not, Albert was his friend and Harry had no desire to keep in him Azkaban.
“Still hot... and full,” Harry answered. He wasn’t sure if the dementors experienced soul eating the same way as him but answering honestly seemed like the best way to get their honest answers and help in return. “It’s getting better, I think,” Harry said. It was either better or Harry was used to the feeling now.
“… and
“Besides, your meetings with Nott were meant to cover his trial, not Potter’s,” stated another wizard.
“I figured we’d start with us,” Draco explained. “It’s still in an experimental phase. I’m sure it’s safe, even to use on children, but I can’t exactly ask other people to let me test it on their children. And we’d need that if we’re going to look at James’ soul. There’s still so much we don’t know. Like, do souls come into being fully formed, or is it something that grows with time? So, if we tested it on James, and his soul is about half the size of an adult’s, we won’t know if it’s because his soul is still growing or if it’s because he’s half of your fully developed soul. So really, it’s best not to start there. We’d need-”
“I’m happy to see you’re readjusting, but you know I’d understand if you needed some time. Don’t push yourself too much. I know you’re an excellent brewer,” Slughorn said. Harry could read between the lines. If Harry asked, Slughorn would be willing to do Harry a favour by being more lenient with coursework than usual. Harry tried not to grimace. He knew the professor only made the offer because Harry was still someone he wanted to ‘collect’. Harry might have gone to prison, but his reputation was currently good with the media, so he was still desirable. Unlike Draco, who Slughorn avoided because someone he was
“Don’t just focus on the... scars. Look at its size,” Draco directed. When Harry only frowned in response, Draco pointed out, “it’s the same size as mine was.”
Similar for Ron and Hermione. There will be moments of tension as Harry tries to figure out where he fits between his old friends and new ones. Arguments might come up when Harry tries to defend the prisoners. Ron won’t like it, and won’t understand what Harry sees in Draco. Hermione’s blood status automatically puts her at odds with most death eaters. As you can see in this chapter, tension will also rise with Neville. Trying to reconcile Neville’s friendship with his newfound appreciation of the Lestrange brothers won’t be easy. It’ll be a mess for poor Harry.
“Unfortunately,” said Harry.
The first time the idea had come to him, Harry had immediately rejected it. However, he kept circling back to it no matter how much he hated it. He knew it was a bad idea. Aside from having to kill someone to create a horcrux, there was a plethora of additional side-effects. Voldemort was definitely unhinged. Perhaps that wouldn’t happen if Harry only created one, but he didn’t delude himself. There was no way he’d be completely spared since he’d be damaging his
he’d done it. Draco observed him with a frown and glanced at Harry’s unfinished meal.
“She still hasn’t forgiven me,” Crabbe stated. “She told Vince his first week at Hogwarts, that if he brought any plants to class, she would ensure they ended up back in his dorm room with a permanent sticking charm.”
“You can have my memory of that,” Harry offered. “It probably won’t help much since I didn’t see Burke attack him. But I heard him threaten Albert, and gloat when he returned him to his cell.”
Once inside the building, John and his shipmate broke away from the group and Harry was sorry to see them go. So far, John was the only one to question the ridiculousness of the situation. While Perkins seemed sympathetic enough, it is clear that he was willing to go along with it.
When their attempt to discredit Harry’s memories failed, they focused their attention on asking Harry questions. Harry felt like they picked apart anything he said as much as they could. Runecraft in particular tried to twist Harry's words. Several times he quoted some statements Harry had made from the transcript Hale submitted to the court, purposely cut to be damning. Each time, Harry glared at the man and elaborated so it wasn't as negative for Albert. Ito tried to censor Harry once, but Hale stepped in, read the whole statement Harry had previously given, and simply asked Harry to confirm that he’d said it.
Harry figured that answered that.
“Harry, dear, you know what happened to Ginevra was not your fault,” Narcissa said. She’d known him long enough to know he carried the weight of her death. Despite her words, she also knew Harry had yet to believe anyone who told him it wasn’t his fault.
“Yeah,” Harry said tiredly.
“Not all at once,” Albert cut in before Harry offered to give Hale a letter from them all. “One letter can slip through the cracks, but eight letters are more likely to be noticed.”
There was more shaky movement in the mirror. By the time the view settled again, Harry was able to see part of Lucius and part of Albert in the mirror. It was obvious they were both awkwardly squished against the wall separating their cells so that both men could see the mirror at once.
“Yes. I don’t know how much he knows about Draco’s task,” Harry stated. Although he couldn’t see Crabbe’s face, Harry thought he heard the same fatherly concern that Malfoy had been expressing.
“It is something that should be decided upon before marriage,” Lucius insisted. He suspected Draco was going to change the subject, so he continued before anyone else could speak. “Harry already has an heir. You ought to have one too.”
“Right... er, I do have something to tell you. I – I, shit, I don’t know how to do this,” Harry admitted.
“Look,” Draco said and gestured towards Harry’s soul.
There was a moment, however brief, where the man desperately looked at Harry and silently begged for help. Harry considered giving it. He really did. But that insidious thought was still rattling around his brain. Harry watched as the man slowly died in front of him, and he knew exactly what he had to do to create a horcrux. Dumbledore had never told him. Hermione had never discovered it in her research. But Harry
“At least have a mind healer come talk to Potter,” Snape insisted, not ready to give up yet.
“Yes. Now, stop trying to get rid of me,” Draco joked lightly.
“I don’t need any warnings or a suspension,” the other guard cut in. “We probably should have left Nott. If Hale comes by soon and hears about it, he’ll make a big stink- I mean, umm,
“I’m not a natural,” Harry protested, disturbed by the thought.
“We’ve barely even started,” said Malfoy. Harry wondered if that was his cue to back out. “But if it makes you feel better, we’ll start with a Hogwarts-approved defense against the dark arts review.”
Draco second-guessed that decision each time Harry came home banged up. He added basic healing magic to his ever-growing field of studies. The only thing that prevented him from asking Harry to choose a safer career was seeing how happy it made his husband. That, and the fact that Harry had supported him through his studies. Even once he finished his first two masteries, Harry encouraged Draco to pursue another in potions, even though it would interfere with Draco’s attempt to settle the horcrux issue.
“It’s standard protocol to leave judicial-wizards alone with their clients” the guard said
“Nothing yet. Just that you weren’t hurting Draco in there. I thought it best to wait for you,” Theo said.
“It is unheard of that one of you would make yourself
“What?” Draco prompted.
“I guess that depends on what they want from you,” Nott acknowledged.
“I need to get back to my post,” Wiblin stated, causing Burke to pull away from Harry.
Instead, Harry spent his afternoon working on the mirror. He read through the books Theo had lent him with ease after he’d had a crash course on the subject. As he added to the notes Theo had started. Harry took care to print clearly as he’d already caught Theo squinting at Harry’s usual messy scrawl.
“No need. Perhaps you’re right after all and there isn’t a need for a formal sit-down. I shouldn’t take too much of Harry’s time. But perhaps, Harry, you’ll humour me and walk with me to the gates,” Hale said.
“I’m well aware that Hogwarts’ professors don’t adequately cover it. With the amount of misinformation that circles around the dorms, it is best to ensure you’re fully prepared when any sexual activities occur,” Lucius pushed though the awkwardness he felt. “Have you learnt the cleaning-”
“The first step is to see what you can do,” Albert suggested. “Test the limits while you get a sense of how magic feels for you now. Once we know the scope, we can work on making it appear more natural.”
“Misshapen?” Harry finished.
“What?... yes, of course,” Nott said with confusion. Harry studied his face and tried to determine his sincerity.
Plus is wasn’t an altruistic offer on the part of the others. They too needed distractions to keep their own negative memories away. As Harry stared at Malfoy’s earnest expression, he wondered how he had spent his days prior to Harry’s arrival. Harry speculated whether his cell had been empty the whole time. If so, that pretty much just left Lestrange as the only person Malfoy could see. He could talk to the men on either side of him, and possibly even a few cells down if the spoke loud enough. But after months of being locked up, not allowed any visitors beside the guards or their judicial-wizards, their conversations must have grown stale. Harry’s presence shook things up and gave them something new and challenging to occupy their time with.
“I think it helps that they aren’t alone. The ministry has rounded up so many prisoners lately, that most of us are put next to someone else. Being able to talk to someone helps... you know?” Harry said. Draco nodded slowly.
The guard didn’t look happy, but he left without taking Harry with him.
“He’s using a two-way mirror to talk to his dad,” Harry said.
“No, go ahead. Maybe you can tell everyone to piss off again,” Harry said with a smile.
Harry laughed at that and was somewhat disappointed that Crabbe Jr. had never tried the same stunt. He and Ron would have laughed themselves silly knowing Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle had to share a room with a temperamental and smelly plant. Harry might have even tried to sneak into their common room again in hopes to set the thing off.
“Nothing good,” answered Crabbe but seemed unwilling to elaborate.
“You?” asked Harry.
“Have you discussed your desires concerning children?” he asked.
“Even if you’re right,” Harry still doubted that Draco didn’t just outright hate him, “I wouldn’t know how to ask him.” Harry didn’t have much experience with asking people out on dates. It wasn’t as if Draco would be charmed by his oh so smooth
“Oh, don’t be such a sad sack,” was the response. “Don’t pay him any mind, Potter. Lucius is too
to him. They’d been his support system and he felt a little lost without them now. Perhaps Burke had been right when he accused Harry of having ‘daddy issues’. Harry honestly couldn’t tell if his messed-up childhood had an impact on how he felt about his relationship with the other prisoners. Harry had never felt more supported than those otherwise miserable weeks in Azkaban, but he couldn’t help but fear that it meant more to him than it did to them. Then, he felt guilty for doubting them.
“Me too,” said Regina with pride. Even though Hale was focused on Hermione, he must have heard her because he put an arm around his daughter and drew her closer at the declaration.
“Surely, not on suspected death eater charges,” Malfoy prompted.
Harry took the time to mention to Narcissa that Andromeda was interested in reconnecting. He did not say more, leaving it to the two women to decide how to move forward. For a long time, he hadn't been sure whether they did so. It was only about a month and a half later that Harry swung by Andromeda's house to drop off something for Teddy while Draco and Narcissa were visiting. He’d been invited in for a cup of tea. When nothing disastrous happened, Andromeda felt comfortable occasionally inviting Harry over at the same time as the Malfoys. She’d claimed it was because Harry was family too, but Harry suspected she wanted him to keep Draco entertained while she cautiously got to know the person her sister had become.
It was surreal for Harry that shortly after the men in the cells closest to him started suggesting various hexes and curses that one could use against enemies. They seemed amused and tried to one up each other with their suggestions.
When Draco frowned down at the notes, Harry wasn’t sure if he was confused by the magic or Harry’s handwriting. “I can explain... if you want,” Harry offered and tried not to grin like a fool when Draco accepted. As Harry explained how he used the blood permanence spell as the base for the connection without undoing the initial transfiguration spell, he felt Draco’s side press up against his. While Harry answered questions about how he solved the issue of the significant distance between the mirrors, he felt Draco’s breath glide down his neck. When he showed Draco the notes of his previous failed attempts, he felt his own body temperature rise but wasn’t sure if was due to Draco’s proximity or the flush that occurred whenever Draco complimented his work.
The unexpected boon moving in with the Malfoy gave Harry was that he was able to start his auror training earlier than planned. Narcissa had insisted as she spent most days watching James anyway. Now that the boys were old enough to play together, Teddy and James insisted on seeing each other frequently. With Andromeda also there, Narcissa pointed out that there wasn’t a need for three adults to watch two children. Harry disagreed considering the mischief the two had started to cook up but ultimately relented once Draco agreed it would be a good time for Harry to start his career.
“I know how it sounds,” Harry said and felt like a broken record. “And I don’t expect you to like or forgive them,” Harry said that last bit to Neville, “but I can’t hate them. I just can’t.”
“I don’t need a mind healer, Hermione,” Harry insisted. Hermione fidgeted.
From the cell next to Harry, Rodolphus snorted. “I taught you most of those spells.”
“Er, we’re not exactly… friendly…” Harry felt awkward having this conversation, especially with Lucius right there. Harry had only just come to terms with the fact that he liked his rival, but he hadn’t admitted that fact aloud before. He didn’t see the point when he knew his best friends would be horrified. Given their history with Draco, Ron and Hermione were likely to discourage Harry from pursuing a relationship with him. Harry was pretty sure that Hermione might have already guessed at Harry’s crush since she was subtly nudging him towards Ginny. As much as he liked Ginny, and knew she was less likely to turn him down and break his heart, Harry felt horrible for liking her since she was dating his friend. Harry felt like his heart had chosen the two most impossible people to focus on.
After months of looking for Voldemort’s horcruxes, with no idea where they were,
As he ate, Harry reflected on Draco’s words. He couldn’t get Lucius released from Azkaban since he didn’t have Hale’s skills. Perhaps there was something else he could do. Both at his trial and during his conversation with Dumbledore, Harry spoke of his desire to have better conditions for the prisoners. He wasn’t sure how to go about that, but perhaps he could think of ways to make their time in Azkaban less miserable. Perhaps Hermione would have ideas. Assuming Harry figured out a way to get her to care about the prisoners. She was a compassionate person. She wouldn’t have made SPEW if she wasn’t. However, she might be less sympathetic about helping a bunch of Death Eaters. Harry hoped to help all prisoners, but he knew Hermione would focus on the fact that mostly Death Eaters would benefit. Harry remembered the look she’d given him when he talked about the other prisoners. He would just have to count on her sense of justice outweighing her hatred and distrust of Death Eaters.
“There have been dozens of students willing to go on record,” Hale responded. “The public outcry has not been good for the ministry’s image. If we tie you in as another victim, we can use the public anger to regain some sympathy for you.”
“Harry. Harry, you listen to me,” Ginny said and turned his face back towards her, “you’re coming back to me. You’re going to stop him, and then you’re coming back to me. I can let you go – run off to do whatever it is you’re doing, but that’s because I know you’re
“I don’t need-”
“What? Dad?” Draco stared dumbfoundedly at the mirror.
“Er, Malfoy, hi,” Harry said as he closed the distance between them. He tried to stop his out-of-breath panting so that it wasn’t so obvious he had run after them. “Can I talk to you for a moment? In private?”
When the class began to work on the practical part of the lesson, Snape didn’t bother checking in with Harry like his other professors had. The man was content to let Harry figure out how he’d catch up on the spells and theories he’d missed. It seemed like Snape was prepared to spend the rest of the class pretending Harry hadn’t rejoined them. Therefore, it was all the more surprising when Snape approached Harry from behind and suddenly reached for Harry’s wand hand.
“You probably do more for him than I do,” Harry shamefully admitted.
They were quiet as Dumbledore prepared the tea. Harry busied himself with greeting Fawkes, who flew to rest on his chair’s armrest. The phoenix’s soft crooning soothed the remaining tension out of Harry. It sank in that he was finally home. He basked in the warmth of the castle, the comfort from Fawkes, and the near perfection of a cup of tea at just the right temperature.
“I suppose we have our answer,” Harry said. When there was no immediate response, he glanced away from the atrocity before him to seek out his husband. Everything in him tensed when he saw the tears falling from Draco’s eyes. Somehow that hurt more than being confronted with his own mangled soul.
Harry started to wash his own body as Albert took a moment to adjust to the sensation of the water spray hitting his cuts and bruises. Now that the man was naked, everyone could see that he was bruised all over. The most damage was around his stomach and ribs, but it was clear that Burke made a valiant effort to mark each part of Albert’s body.
New clean uniforms were laid out on the benches. Given the magical resizing of the clothes, Harry assumed he could grab any pair and gratefully walked towards the set closest to where he left his glasses. Harry realized one downside of interchangeable clothes was that his old pair of pants weren’t returned to him freshly laundered. Instead he had a thin pair of tighty-whities. A quick glance at Lucius revealed the man had put on a matching pair. As he slipped his on, Harry tried not to think about how many prisoners wore that specific pair of pants previously. He would have skipped them but in Azkaban, every thin layer counted.
“We’re flooing from here,” Hale informed him before Harry could spiral too far into his sudden fear that the aurors took him here for an assassination attempt. Auror Perkins flooed first, followed by Harry, then Hale, and lastly Bradley. Harry was rather surprised to land in the main atrium and guided to check-in at the visitor’s station. He felt eyes on him as Bradley manhandled him. It made him extremely tense until one witch yelled “free Potter!” and several other voices joined in with a supportive cheer. By the time it took them to get processed, several bystanders had transfigured and charmed handheld posters. Harry read ones that said ‘Free Potter’ and ‘Down with M.O.M, we don’t trust them!’. The crowd had also started chanting “Hey, hey, auror! Unhand Potter!”. It helped Harry steel his resolve.
“I think I made it worse,” he said.
“May I?” Hermione asked. Harry let her read it over.
At this pronouncement, some of the teachers started voicing their protests. Dumbledore moved around the head table and started making his way towards the ministry employees.
“I’m sorry,” Neville blurted in the middle of the afternoon tea Harry had served him.
“Perhaps,” Draco nodded. “If souls develop as we age like any other body part, then yours might have had to grow around the foreign substance. Even with it now gone, your soul stayed...”
,” he said with mirth.
By the time Ron finished writing his charms essay, Harry had gone over most of Hermione’s notes.
“That actually might be better. Less chance of having people stick around and eavesdrop,” Hale mused. He said he’d follow up with a letter for the day and time, but he imagined his reporter friend would be eager to meet Harry as soon as possible. Harry agreed and once again thanked Hale for the list he’d given.
about how happy she was that she killed him!”
“You’d know all about delinquency,” Harry muttered. He didn’t need Hermione’s elbow to his side to let him know he said it too loud. Snape’s frown grew more pronounced than ever as he leveled Harry with a look that could rival aunt Petunia’s look of utmost disgust. Harry didn’t care. He didn’t need Snape of all people throwing proverbial stones. When Harry chanced a glance in Draco’s direction, he was somewhat mollified by the blonde’s annoyed expression. Harry knew it wasn’t for his benefit. Half of Snape’s comments had referred to Harry’s stay in Azkaban, which was where Draco’s father still resided.
“You stopped him?” Crabbe’s confused voice prevented Harry from wondering how he felt physically fine. Harry didn’t know what to say. The last thing he wanted was for these men to fear him or be disgusted by what he did.
“You can’t do anything. You’ll get in trouble again,” Harry tried to reason with Burke.
“You would not have,” Draco responded.
“So, horcruxes are sentient?” Draco wondered.
“How did he try to stop you?” asked Hale.
that did it, and even when it was me, no one cared about
“Thank you,” Harry said, grateful for Ron’s foresight. Harry didn’t like the idea of people going through his things, and he would have hated it if the aurors had taken his dad’s cloak and map. He hoped his family album was safe.
“Potter, your hair is getting rather long,” Draco observed. He emphasized his point by running his hand through Harry’s locks. It wasn’t the first time he’d done that, so Harry didn’t think much of it.
Two guards passed out breakfast without their usual sneers or loud noises that woke the dozing prisoners. They worked quickly and efficiently. When they neared Harry, he made sure to move slowly as if he was still injured. The guard passing Harry his food, cringed at the sight of his injuries and looked away. He left without offering to heal him.
“You didn’t hurt her too much, did you?” Lestrange asked. Harry wanted to retort that she deserved so much more than what she got but realized that Lestrange was concerned about his wife. It was odd to realize even death eaters had feelings and cared about their families. Harry was fighting against feeling any pity for the man. Neither he nor his wife were innocent victims.
Harry immediately cast the counter and Lestrange’s nails settled into their natural state.
“Do you think the same limitations will apply for James?” Draco questioned.
“But it didn’t kiss you?” asked Hawkworth.
“I don’t need a mind healer,” Harry bristled.
“What if, for every dark art spell the Lestrange brothers teach you, they show you two defense spells? Preferably one of those defense spells would be to counter or heal the effects of that dark spell,” Lucius proposed.
“Potentially useful,” interrupted Ishanders as he disagreed on how handy this ability was. “If we can harness this skill, we can keep a portion of our meals for when we are in dire need,” Ishanders theorized. It sounded like an old debate between the two, but Harry barely followed their conversation at this point. His mind was busy going over all of the lessons he had with Dumbledore throughout the year.
“Or it was stupid. I could have been released ages ago,” Harry remarked. He may not have been completely spared from Burke’s treatment, but he could have avoided the worst of it.
“Oh dear. Of course, you don’t know. You couldn’t know. I’m sorry to be the one to tell you this, especially so soon after you’ve woken up... I’m afraid Ginevra Weasley died a few months ago during a difficult delivery. It was a tough pregnancy overall,” she told him as gently as she could.
“Are you sure?” the man asked.
Harry tried to go as quickly as possible. He was glad that it wasn’t particularly loud, and it didn’t clog the toilet. The situation was embarrassing enough as it was. Harry waited for one of the other prisoners to comment, but no one did.
He was only saved because something distracted Burke from finishing the job. When Burke’s grip loosened, Harry gratefully gasped in lungfuls of air between coughs.
Snape also wasn’t content with McGonagall’s answer, but for different reasons.
“I won’t review any defense spells if you are so closed minded about the dark arts themselves,” snipped Rodolphus.
The man was a decent singer, but his gyrating as he soaped up his body made the scene as indecent as it was absurd. When Harry caught the man’s eye, Mulciber winked at him and continued to serenade the prisoners. The more they complained and demanded he shut up, the bigger the spectacle he caused. It drew all eyes away from Harry. His heart filled with gratitude and Harry made a mental note to conjure the man another bottle of lube.
“It wasn’t justified!” Harry said too loudly.
Harry didn’t know Avery enough to select a personal gift. The man’s cell was close enough to relay some lessons, but also far away enough that it made personal conversations difficult. In the end, Harry decided to create a dagger. He was fairly certain it wasn’t properly balanced, but he hoped the engraved snakes on the handle made up for it. He selected the last rune Avery taught him, “Eihwaz”, as the trigger for enlarging the dagger.
As Harry expected, Snape was the only professor he saw that day that wasn’t understanding or supportive. He’d started the class by making a big spectacle when he announced they would review the past several classes, specifically so Harry could catch up. From any other professor it might have been a kindness, though they wouldn’t single him out like Snape did. Snape tried to use the opportunity to show how little Harry knew. This became clear when he posed more questions to Harry than any of his peers who had attended the lessons. Unfortunately for Snape, Harry was unwilling to pretend to struggle and answered all of the questions correctly. When it became apparent he couldn’t humiliate Harry this way, Snape decreed that since Harry did not need their help, he had until Monday to hand in all of the assignments he missed. Since it was already Thursday, it was clear he expected Harry to spend the entire weekend catching up on weeks of Defense lessons. Snape didn’t bother to actually give him a list of the missed assignments. Hermione likely had a record of them, so Harry knew he’d be fine. Still, it seemed like Snape hoped he’d miss some so that he’d have an excuse to fail Harry.
Both Albert and Lucius were infuriated on Harry’s behalf every time a memory involving one of the Dursleys came up. After seeing how uncomfortable Harry was, they tried to tone down their reactions, but they couldn’t mask their anger. The first time Albert had seen Vernon toss then lock Harry in the cupboard, the man had sworn up a storm commenting on how he would just land himself back in Azkaban for murdering them. Lucius periodically asked Harry if he wanted to talk about it, but respected Harry’s continuous refusal. The man had even grudgingly admitted that “some Weasleys weren’t so bad” after he’d seen the memory where Fred, George, and Ron had pulled off the bars from Harry’s window and took him away in a flying car. Harry overheard them roping Mulciber into their revenge plans when they thought Harry wasn’t paying attention. Harry had mixed emotions about it. He was moved that they not only cared but were actively planning how to prevent the Dursleys from hurting him again. However, these men were more likely to do more permanent damage than Fred and George’s ton-tongue toffees.
A low and gravelly voice asked him. It was accompanied by a rattling sound. Harry shivered but realized that the usual cold he feels in the presence of dementors had also receded. It was still cold, but it was just the general cold of Azkaban. Harry wondered what could be blocking the effects of the dementor before he registered that the men in the cells around him were moaning in misery. Harry hadn’t noticed until his own laboured breathing had calmed. Although Harry could no longer feel the effects of the dementors, it seemed like everyone else in the vicinity still could.
“They make sure any injuries are healed before you’re presented to anyone from the outside,” Mulciber informed Harry.
“It probably hindered you more than helped,” suggested Malfoy. “Anger can provide the desire for the curse to work, but likely made you lose focus.”
There was some resistance from the wizengamot who wanted to keep asking Harry about his home life. He didn’t know if it was genuine concern or just a morbid fascination and a desire to gossip. Harry was grateful when Bones forcibly steered the questioning back to Harry’s experiences with Albert.
,” Harry said before painful sobs wracked his body. He let Mrs. Weasley gather him in her arms, and felt worse because she should hate him, but Harry let her comfort him instead. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry...”
step. I know what you... what you did. I can’t actually picture you doing any of it, but I know what you must have done to create one,” Draco admitted. Harry carefully observed Draco and began to believe him. There was a certain amount of pain and disgust in his expression, even though he did not pull away from Harry. Harry felt relieved but also ashamed.
“Would I have to go back to court?” Harry asked.
Harry didn’t answer the question. Despite their support on how ridiculous this situation was, Harry didn’t trust them not to repeat any confessions he might make. However, his silence might have been answer enough given the raised eyebrows both Albert and Malfoy were sporting.
Perhaps Burke wasn’t too far off the mark, because a dark part of Harry very much wished that one of the surrounding Death Eaters would find a way to relay that comment back to Voldemort. Someone who went by the moniker “dark lord” would likely take offense to such a bold claim, and consequently try to prove who the darker wizard was by using Burke as target practice.
Although Hale asked questions about Albert, Harry tied in a few of the other prisoners as well. Hale was the judicial-wizard for all his new death eaters friends, even if they were not currently appealing their case. So, Harry made sure to mention that Crabbe told Harry to wake him if Harry had nightmares about Burke. He spoke about how Lucius was constantly ensuring that Harry was OK, which was remarkable given that the guards had not offered even the mildest of pain relief potions. To Hale’s amusement, Harry even recounted how Mulciber sung and danced in the showers to draw the attention away from Harry’s bruised body.
“Right...” Harry acknowledged Draco’s plan, but was worried about following through. He’d waited years to have proof of his greatest fear, but now that it might be within his reach, he was scared to find out.
“Why did you select that curse if you had not yet mastered it?” asked Nott. He seemed surprised by Harry’s blank look. “Was that the first time you ever tried that curse?” he asked disbelievingly.
“I don’t know what’s worst; the dementors or the guards,” said Nott.
“Oh,” Harry sighed. “I can do privacy charms!” Except, before he could put any in place, the door at the end of the hallway opened up and they were told to file out of their cells for a shower.
“Still in Azkaban though,” Crabbe pointed out. Before Harry could try to reassure them that Hale was working on Albert’s case, Draco cut in.
“So, James can’t be your horcrux, if you still have your whole soul,” Draco said.
“I didn’t have to. It was all for nothing,” Harry couldn’t help but point out.
Lucius was more precise in his directions and stressed the importance of the wand movements. Harry thought the man was a tad frustrated that he couldn’t directly correct Harry’s stance. It would have been easier if the man could manhandle Harry into the correct position. Eventually Lucius was satisfied that Harry would be able to perform the magic once he had his wand.
“That mugglefucker didn’t give me any pain-relieving potions either,” grumbled Mulciber.
“Better some mystery bland thing than a mysterious pungent meal” responded Malfoy. Harry watched Malfoy scoop up some of the beans and eat it. Harry cautiously did the same. He figured if the aristocratic Malfoy could eat it, it was something Harry could manage.
“It’s like I took a pepper-up potion, only it’s less pleasant,” Harry responded.
“Doesn’t matter,” responded Mulciber. “That’s gold.”
“Harry,” Lucius said cautiously. Harry looked in his direction even though his vision was blurred by tears and a lack of glasses. “Are you-” the man had wanted to ask if Harry was alright, but cut himself off as it was obvious that the boy wasn’t okay.
“Not help, er, with whatever that is,” Harry clarified and gestured towards the room of requirement. As much as he liked the Malfoys, he wasn’t about to help Voldemort’s schemes. “I just mean...” Harry trailed off. The truth was he didn’t know what he meant. Unless Draco confided in him, Harry didn’t know enough about the situation to offer anything.
Hale was patient throughout the process and allowed Harry to review everything once they were done. When the quill was no longer recording their conversation, Hale laid out his plan of action for Harry.
,” interrupted the dementor. It moved closer to the bars. For a second, Harry worried the creature would be able to squeeze through. Harry was relieved when it became apparent that it could not move any closer. “
“No. I’ve been focused on the rocks,” as soon as Harry revealed this, he felt rather stupid. He’d spent hours playing with rocks instead of doing something more productive.
Halfway through Harry’s modest breakfast, McLaggen gathered enough courage to ask the questions everyone seemed to want to know. When Harry pretended not to hear him, the older boy grew increasingly loud and his questions turned into rude comments. Harry tried not to let it bother him. He knew it was suspect when the saltshaker kept falling into McLaggen’s meal, but Harry felt secure that no one would immediately jump to the conclusion that Harry had mastered silent and wandless magic. After McLaggen’s bravery, Harry noticed more and more people blatantly listened to his conversations with his friends. Harry managed to make it through the entire meal, but he’d developed a tension headache by the time his first class started.
“I cast it but it only worked for a second,” Harry admitted and hoped that this conversation wasn’t their plan to get him to admit it out loud.
“Your wife is in Gryffindor too?” Harry asked.
“What would your friends say about such a tragedy? Or perhaps they’ve already written you off. I wouldn’t want to associate with criminal elements,” taunted Burke.
“But-”
“No, well yes, but that wasn’t – I’m trying to find Draco,” Harry explained, even if it did little to actually explain anything to the prisoners.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m a Malfoy, Potter. I’m perfectly capable of learning any branch of magic I set my mind to,” Draco said arrogantly.
“Watch what you say,” Lucius warned as Mulciber talked about his son.
Harry managed to work through most of those assignments that night after the others went to bed. He was mentally exhausted by the time he flopped onto his bed and pretended to sleep. Despite how boring the reading and assignments were, a part of Harry appreciated the distraction from his own dark thoughts. He worried about what he would do Saturday night since he anticipated being finished with the rest of his schoolwork by then. With nothing occupying his mind, it was likely to wander to topics Harry really didn’t want to think about.
