Harry looks up. James has circles under his eyes and his eyebrows are drawn together. “I’m okay, Dad,” Harry says. He wants to wipe the worried look from his father’s face, but he knows how bad his fall was. He thought himself that he was going to die when he was racing towards the ground.
The next day, against the advice of his attorneys, Harry signed the marriage contract without hesitation.
Without thinking he reached out and very gently traced a lightening bolt shaped scar. The scar didn’t ruin the very handsome face; instead, it enhanced it. Green eyes stared down at him lustfully and Draco then ran his hand to his wild raven hair. All his life he had been surrounded by fair and blond males that he had never seen such a dark color before. Male nymphs didn’t look like the wizard before him. Strong with a frame that dwarfed his tiny frame.
As much as he was kept sheltered, the other pureblood girls were a wealth of information and Draco wasn’t above using his beauty to ensnare Harry. He watched as Harry’s breathing began to get labored and with a sweet smile, opened his nightgown exposing his breasts.
For his part, the wizard moaned in appreciation and closed his eyes at the tight wet heat sucking him. If he wasn’t mistaken, he felt something like a hymen resist him before snapping and he was able to push deeper into the petite beauty.
Harry stared back in shock. Theo had once dared to imply some very unsavory thoughts about Draco’s figure and Harry had broken his face for it. If he was an idiot to try again, Harry would destroy him and his House for it.
They both went off to Hogwarts, the British wizarding community aflutter with news of their engagement. Even though Harry had established his rights over Draco, his possessiveness worsened as the beauty’s figure blossomed. Those perky buds grew and Draco developed an hour-glass figure with wide hips and a fat ass. No matter where he went, the gaze of every wizard followed him. Harry made sure his fiancee was protected and any crass words were instantly regretted. Draco was to be respected. But more than anything, Harry wanted to keep the blond sweet and innocent. It was lewd how sweet the blond was when he had the body of a goddess.
“I love you and was too much of a fool to tell you. I hate my so-call elite friends and all those that came before you pale in comparison. Yes, you should have been nothing to me, but I feel for you and I want you back. Please,” Harry begged, “come home with me and let me be a father to Jaime and a husband to you.”
Harry began to finger him, pleased at the resistance he found and swallowed Draco’s moans of discomfort. Aided by Draco’s slick, Harry pushed into him and closed his eyes in pleasure. His boy cunt was better than he remembered, a tight heat that was almost virginal. But Draco was a mother now, proof that he had taken Harry’s cock and cum.
Draco was still a virgin, but Harry had seen him bared from the waist up. He spent his evenings buried in Draco’s chest with a hand on his cock, pleasuring himself and releasing his seed on Draco’s nightgowns.
Sitting in his bedroom accent chair was none other than Harry Potter, the man who broke his heart. The man still looked as gorgeous as ever, handsome in a way that made Draco squirm. Now, it left Draco breathless, knowing that Harry knew.
“James Regulus Malfoy,” Draco whispered. He had taken one look at his Potter baby and knew he needed a Potter name, even if he never carried the famous surname.
Draco shook his head, tears running down his face. Jaime began whimpering, his sleep slowly disturbed by his parents’ shouts.
But, Harry wasn’t afraid of Hermione. Anything between them would be consensual and he would ensure that Draco was well-compensated for his time. And yet, Harry could never treat him like his previous conquests.
When they returned back to Hogwarts, Draco was settled and Harry now spent his nights with him in his dorm. Daphne, on the other hand, looked on with barely concealed jealousy at how once again, Harry Potter was wrapped around Draco’s finger.
Draco never imagined he would one day be engaged to the Boy-Who-Lived. As a Malfoy, he knew his marriage would be advantageous and he was lucky that it was Harry. Harry was so patient with him and loving. He never held their first unofficial meeting against him. Draco had been so naive then to not take extra care in common spaces. That his fiancé had seen his breasts and never once hinted at his dishonor made it easy to fall in love with him.
No one had ever looked at him with such awe and passion. Before the birth of their younglings, Draco would lounge around almost nude, wearing the skimpiest of clothing, lingerie and bikinis. All magical portraits were locked away and the lone female house elf kept her distance, leaving her Master and Mistress free to indulge.
Since Draco left him, Harry felt lost and disoriented. The blond beauty was so very important to him, no matter how much Harry tried to deny it.
The wizard kissed his hand before kissing him again. Draco moaned as large hands massaged his breasts and very soon the passion between them reignited and his breasts were suckled.
Raised by his aunt, he hadn’t known anything of their world. The wealth that once graced the Malfoy name was gone and the family prestige tarnished. All Draco had was a name and dead parents. His aunt had been middle classed at best and his cousin a rookie on the police force. He had his grades, degree and yet, he was naively sweet.
Harry closed his eyes as soft fingers caressed his face and he gasped when soft pouty lips touched his. Draco’s first kiss!
For a long time, Draco had been uncomfortable of how large his breasts were for a boy. Hell, even some girls! He always made sure to be covered up, not wanting to attract more than leering looks. He saw how much Harry loved playing with them and gripping them during sex. Now, Harry slept with one hand on his breast, nose buried in his blond hair. It made Draco feel both wanted and safe.
For his part, Harry looked at Draco, nursing his son in his shirt. The shirt was too large for him and it left the blond’s body on display. Tits out with Harry’s cum running down his thighs, it made him hot, but they had business to attend too.
His wizard loved his body and his large hands would always reverently caress his curves. The wizarding world was strange and at first, his mate prevented him from leaving their dwelling. He had feared Draco would run, but even if Draco had the inclination, he was far away from all that he knew. It wasn’t just fear that explained away Harry’s actions, but possessiveness as well. As Draco began to speak English and learn to read and write, his mate became more controlling and demanding.
Draco could have been a Duchess or even a Queen if Harry hadn’t seen him, but a month before he started his wizarding education at Hogwarts, he was engaged to Harry. Since he was eleven, Draco knew he was destined to be Harry’s wife. He knew it was a honor to one day be the wife of Great Britain’s wizarding savior and Harry made sure he never found out what had been taken from him. Draco wouldn’t want for anything and amongst Harry’s family jewels existed several tiaras Draco could wear if he so desired.
Harry gently caressed his face and bent down to kiss him softly before his fingers began to undo his nightgown’s buttons.
Even now, Draco didn’t know how his mate found him. All he remembers was bathing in a pond alone when he felt the presence of another behind him. He wasn’t even given a chance to react before he felt strong arms around him.
Harry stopped, startled at hearing his father’s name. He didn’t know whether to feel grateful or anger.
“Draco!” Harry exclaimed and quickly grabbed his beloved’s hands. When he had gone to see Draco earlier that morning, his heart had dropped when he saw his beauty fallen over, unconscious. The thought of losing his love made Harry feel both fear and rage. He quickly moved Draco from Hogwarts. As if he would allow a mere school nurse to tend to him!
He couldn’t wait to be Harry’s and with a wicked smile, changed the rules once again. With a pout, Draco reached out joining his hands with Harry’s on his cock.
Harry watched as grey eyes closed, exhaustion settling in. He would let Draco rest, but even that wouldn’t stop him from another round. His hands gripped the large tits, pleasured with how firm and perky they were still. Draco made for a sexy baby mama and Harry wouldn’t mind filling him again, impregnating him several times over. He was the last Potter and he was sure his heir would want siblings.
Draco laid underneath him, tired, large breasts heaving and he whimpered as he felt himself be filled with come. His last thought was that he hoped him still nursing Jaime would be enough to prevent another pregnancy.
Draco, on the other hand, had a different idea. Harry was his and Draco wanted to ensure that he would never looked at anyone ever again. With a reckless of a Black, he slowly began to undo the buttons on his nightgown and watched as green eyes widen at his actions.
The precious blond was fast asleep, unaware that his days of running and hiding were over. Harry took off his clothes and got into the bed. The moment Harry cuddled up to petite blond and rubbed his nose against silky blond hair, he finally felt the tension leave his body.
Harry wasted no time and began suckling, the sweet milk hitting his taste buds. He took his cock out and a small soft hand began jerking him off. Draco’s movements were inexperienced but it drove Harry wild. Draco was his. That night had confirmed it. His boy cunt had been too tight and Draco had been offended by the suggestion, almost causing them to argue again.
He could feel his breasts bounce with each thrust and to his embarrassment he began leaking. Draco knew he should have weaned Jaime, but his baby was fussy and preferred to nurse still.
He was lucky. Without his Boy-Who-Lived status and the fortune of two ancient families, he wouldn’t be allowed near the blond. And even then, it had been a struggle. Draco’s fair beauty had been apparent at a young age and no doubts, the Malfoys hoped to engaged him to actual royalty and maybe they would have been successful if they hadn’t met as children.
Draco moaned as he was pushed into the bed and he felt breathless as his innocent kiss became indecent. Harry began to kiss his face and throat and Draco shivered at the new sensations.
The calmness in his voice was a warning and Draco could barely respond when he saw him move. With the deadly grace Draco remembered so well, Harry was in the bed, spreading his thighs looming over him.
And that more than anything made Draco feel both insecure and sad. He was ready to mate and have younglings. There was times while he was bathing that he felt like he was in heat. He so desperately needed a cock inside him. Someone to thrust into him and suckle his tits.
Harry thanked his lucky stars he had walked into the wrong changing room. The circumstances may have been embarrassing at the time. Hours earlier he had learned he was a wizard with money and then the next he had walked into a changing room with a beautiful half-nude blond boy. Draco’s tits had been a handful of perky buds then but Harry was hooked.
Draco knew his Aunt loved him, even behind her harsh manner. But, he felt mortified when she added an infidelity clause to their marriage contract.
Draco knew it was acting spoiled, but he was rarely denied and Harry Potter needed to explain his idiocy to him immediately.
He had been so nervous when he had been called into his father’s parlor. The moment he walked in and saw the familiar raven-haired boy, his heart had stopped. Draco was scared that he would be ruined.
Slowly the pain gave away and Draco whimpered softly at the pleasure. He had never been taken before but he knew mating was only for the purpose of younglings and yet this felt different. Maybe Draco was a freak to enjoy the pleasure the wizard was giving him but Draco would savor the moment.
That made him shut-up. Hadn’t he run because he feared being throw aside like a toy? Hadn’t he feared his Jaime would be harmed without the protection of the Potter name?
“I don’t know Draco. Mum is nuts sometimes, but she is right. Love blinds you now, but you would a fool to not use Potter’s love for Jaime’s advantage at least,” Tonks responded when she heard his complaints.
That was not to say that he wasn’t afraid when he saw the wizard for the first time. Nymphs, although magical creatures, tended to keep away from others. Water nymphs, in particular, were very isolated and only moved along their established territories nearby lakes and streams.
Harry quietly walked into the nursery and with gentle hands picked up the sleeping baby. Cradling the one year old baby boy, Harry ran his hand through wild raven hair and when sleepy eyes opened to looked up at him, Harry was in awe at the green gaze.
Draco wouldn’t have it any other way. Their wedding, the event of the decade if not the century, was fast approaching. Already, he had chosen his tiara from the Potter collection. He couldn’t wear all the jewelry pieces available to him until he was Lady Potter, but Draco wore a few lesser known pieces to social events.
Theo Nott may not be from the wealthiest family compared to the Greengrass fortune, but the Nott family name had clout. Theirs was a Noble name. As much as their engagement was an arrangement, Daphne had a soft spot for Theo. Theo was less boisterous compared to others, but he liked his loose women. No matter how discreet, Daphne knew and it made her blood boil. They all knew it was common in their circle. They would have the name, ring and recognition amongst their peers. Faithfulness, on the other hand, was a dream. Men had needs, it was often said and they sated them with those of lesser blood.
Harry kissed Draco’s hands and wiped away the tears, “Daphne is a jealous fool. Me accepting had little to do with such things, I promise. I only attend the day meetings and any extracurriculars are soundly rejected.”
Draco brushed his hand against wild raven curls and kissed the scared forehead. He didn’t know why but he whispered to the sleeping man “love you” before getting up and putting on Harry’s shirt. His nightgown was ripped and he needed to check on Jaime. Draco whimpered as he limped out of the bedroom, green eyes watching him leave.
“Darling,” he tried again and gently grasped the slender hand before he was slapped again. He kissed each finger and looked into those eyes before kissing his face and lips.
“My little sleeping beauty,” a voice called out and Draco froze. He knew that voice and he could feel himself shake.
Harry closed his eyes and didn’t even touch his face too soothe the painful flare on his cheek. Between himself and the Malfoys, Draco was a spoiled little princess. Harry wouldn’t have it any other way and found his rare temper tantrums adorable. He couldn’t even say he was annoyed now. Harry sighed and stared down at his spiteful fiancé.
It was that image that sealed the deal. Any doubts Harry Potter had in taking a nymph as his wife were silenced.
He thought Harry trusted him. Hell, he thought they were in a relationship! They even lived together and Harry would even cook for him! But, it was all a lie. Draco was just convenient and one day Harry would get bored and marry his childhood sweetheart. The moment Draco found out he was pregnant he had been both excited and scared. Scared of what Harry would think and when he saw that damn picture of Ginny Weasley kissing Harry, he knew his baby didn’t even stand a chance. He didn’t trust the redhead to not hurt them. So, he left.
“His name,” Harry demanded as he stepped into the nursery. It was one of the few things Harry couldn’t find.
But, he was ignored. Harry pushed deeper into him, his thrusts brutally hitting his prostate and Draco moaned as pleasure began coursing through him.
Draco loved Harry and even now he feared all his insecurities would come true. He had finished nursing Jaime when he felt Harry come into the nursery.
Tonks had been happy to see him, having kept his secret. “She was worried you see”, she told him briefly before leaving him to Andromeda Black’s mercy.
He hadn’t know then who Harry was or his importance in his new home and years later Draco still didn’t understand beyond the influence and power his mate weld.
“You make for such a beautiful mother,” a deep voice stated behind him and Draco whipped his head to look at Harry looking at them with cool green eyes. He tried not to look at his half nude body, but was unsuccessful when he felt himself blush. Harry was such a handsome man.
The wizard gently kissed his lips as he laid Draco on the meadow’s ground and all he could do was stare up at the male with large blue eyes. Finally, he could take in the face of his assailant and Draco just stared at him in awe.
With a willpower he didn’t know he possessed, he covered Draco up and was shocked to see Draco burst into tears.
With those thoughts in mind, he started to get hard once again and without hesitation, began fucking the slumbering blond.
Harry could forgive, but not this betrayal. Draco would pay for daring to think he could reject Harry and fuck off with another man.
Draco liked how he looked. He thought his curves were exotic. It was the other nymphs that were an issue. Beyond his pod mother, the other nymphs found his body to be bulky and strange. He wasn’t the slender and lithe archetype nor the ideal beauty and as a result, no male nymph showed any interest in mating with him.
Draco ran and Harry didn’t find out why until he came across a report of a baby. Money was no object and Harry had the resources to spare to locate the blond. The moment he learned his Draco had been pregnant, Harry raged, the jealousy coursing through him. The thoughts of other men fucking his blond made the blood boil in his veins. Just the image of another man not only knowing the pleasure of Draco’s body, but actually coming inside him enraged him. Harry destroyed his living room in his fit. He hated Draco for allowing another to not only fuck him, but impregnating him.
It made Draco blush in mortification. His Aunt did not know how right she was, especially since Harry did indeed enjoy his breast milk.
“Do you not like them?” Draco wailed as the boy he loved rejected him. What did Draco lack? He knew he was beautiful and yet, it wasn’t enough.
But seeing the baby, Harry knew without the need of a paternity test that the boy was his. Draco hadn’t exactly betrayed him with another, but he had run and eluded him for years. Harry was more than ready to teach him a lesson, but first he needed to rest so he buried his nose in blond hair and slept peacefully for the first time in months.
“You left me and had my son,” Harry whispered before sharp teeth latched themselves to the delicate skin on his neck.
“How can such a slutty body still be a virgin?” he asked but Draco was gone and he just laid on the grass, whimpering as the thrusts became faster and rougher. His breasts began to bounce wildly along with each thrust and a large hand grasped one of them as the other was suckled.
“Harry!” Draco exclaimed at the swat on his bottom. It was a gentle tap that was soon soothed over by another squeeze.
“You left me Draco,” Harry stated as green eyes looked down at him and Draco looked up at him with large grey eyes. Jaime too had inherited those eyes and Draco couldn’t force himself to speak.
Once Harry got his fill of the sweet milk, he gripped a tit for leverage and chased his pleasure. He always made sure Draco came before him, but now he wanted to punish the blond beauty. The boy cunt was clenching his cock just right and Harry felt Draco come undone. That set him off and Harry began coming inside, refusing to pull out.
He never expected Draco, the son of the disgraced Malfoy family to be his undoing. At first, Harry believed his wide-eyed innocence was a facade. How could the son of Lucius Malfoy, the right hand man of the infamous Tom Riddle be anything but? And yet, Draco was.
Since their fight, he had respected his decision. Draco would marry him, but there would be no intimacy until after their wedding.
“I raised you better than this!” She had shouted, “You spread your legs for a Potter without a ring on your hand and came back with his bastard! You are lucky that boy is still willing to buy the cow even though he got the milk for free!”
Looking back, Draco wondered how his life would have turned out if his mate hadn’t taken him. Since the moment Draco looked up into green eyes, he finally felt desired. His mate had never hidden his appreciation for his body and it made Draco’s heart swell with happiness.
The stress of the war and the weight of everyone’s expectations almost drove Harry to the breaking point. The loss of Sirius combined with the absence of his friends’ support drove him to lash out. With access to his family’s gold and Sirius’ inheritance, Harry indulged for the first time in his life and Draco was his prize. Harry never regretted spying on and stalking the blond nymph. Draco has been his light throughout his battle with Voldemort and he found peace in pale arms and blond hair.
Harry had the apartment surveilled for a month and knew the layout. Once his baby was asleep, he didn’t hesitate to go to the master bedroom. Inside, he found the real prize: Draco.
“Is it true?” Draco asked, afraid of the answer, but needing to know the truth, “Are you truly going to shame me by going carousing with Theo!”
Draco woke up, his body sore. He whimpered as he tried to sit up in his bed, but he was held back by a muscular tan arm. He looked down at Harry’s sleeping face and almost cried. He hadn’t been dreaming after all. Harry had found him and no doubt he would rage at him the moment he laid his eyes on Jaime. The baby was splitting image of a Potter, anyone with eyes could see it.
Draco’s eyes widened when he felt something thicker than fingers prod his entrance and he promptly screamed when the large cock entered him. He felt all the air leave him as the wizard pushed into him and it felt never ending. Draco felt full and he laid on the grass, his eyes glassy as the large cock broke his seal and stretched him out.
Harry gasped and wildly looked at him, his pupils blown. Draco’s other hand, tugged at a fat pink nipple. He began to caress the heavy cock in his hand. Harry was no longer a boy, he hand grown into a man and Draco was pleased.
was the only thing Harry’s mind could process. He didn’t like that Draco knew such things. He thought the entire thing was crass and usually rolled his eyes at such meetings. He never saw the point of it. That was not to say Harry hadn’t experimented, but he had done so far away and felt disgusted afterwards. Harry had a true prize, a true goddess in his arms and everyone else felt cheap.
Large grey eyes looked at him in horror as the blond blushed and all Harry could go was stutter an apology before walking away. He later learned that even though it had been an accident, Draco could have been disgraced. As a male bearer he had been seen in an intimate position by another male, accident or no.
And Harry loved indulging. Draco’s breasts were always uncovered, fat pink nipples ready to be played with. Soon after arriving to his new home, his mate had him on his knees, his small mouth and throat struggling to pleasure his cock. And yet, his struggle made Harry wild. And when his mouth became too tired, his breasts would finish him off.
I lose myself in his merciless rhythm, he’s pounding my prostate and I’m so close, a blessed tightening in my pelvis. With blistering speed, he yanks me from the wrecked wall and we smash into the table. The wood splinters under my back and the serrated edges scrape deliciously against my raw skin, driving my pleasure ever higher.
‘I made a friend! His name is Draco, he’s so cool and we got to sit next to each other, he’s really nice and he let me have his candy...’
Draco looked bewildered for a moment before a glare stole over his reddening face. Tears were streaming from Harry’s eyes and his cheeks were aching, his giggles only made worse by Draco’s exasperated frown. After a long minute, in which Draco’s glare intensified until he looked absolutely irate, Harry was finally able to calm himself down enough to speak.
I felt bad for making Myrtle feel even worse. I told her I was sorry and then asked her who threw it at her. She didn’t know. She had just been sitting in her U-bend thinking about death, and then it fell right through the top of her head. I asked her what it’s like, to die. Did it hurt or was it peaceful? Myrtle than told me how she died. She said it was dreadful. It had happened right there, in her toilet stall. She remembers it well because she’d been hiding from Olive Hornby. She had been teasing Myrtle about her glasses. Myrtle had been crying when she heard someone else enter the bathroom and say something funny, in a strange language. It was a boy, so Myrtle opened her stall to tell him to get out and use his own toilet, and then she died. She doesn’t know how, she just saw a pair of great big, yellow eyes. Her body sort of seized up and then she was floating away. And I just thought, that doesn’t sound so bad. It would be nice to flow away from this place and move on to be with you. I really wish I could be with you, mom and dad.
It has been two weeks. Draco sits at the back of the potions classroom and watches as Granger and Weasley get yelled at by Professor Snape. Granger has lost her touch. Her eyes are red-rimmed all the time now, and Draco never sees her study anymore. They haven’t been to the library since the Quidditch match. Granger used to go there at least a couple of times a week. Draco wonders if it’s because she just can’t concentrate or if she just doesn’t want to run into Draco. Surely they can’t believe what everyone is saying. That Draco pushed Harry off his broom, that it’s his fault that Harry is gone.
Draco, who is probably in the library. Maybe Harry should go see him. He’s probably alone. On this cold Sunday. Harry sighs and sags further into the sofa. It would be so cool to have Draco in Gryffindor house. He would fit right in. He’s so fucking brave. The way he managed to keep his grades somewhat decent without being able to cast, and without the ability to hear a single word any teacher ever said. And now he’s taking extra lessons with Professor Flitwick to learn how to cast non-verbal. It’s difficult. Harry tried it, and he couldn’t make his spells work without uttering the incantations. But Draco will manage it. He will get better grades and his father will maybe be a bit kinder towards him.
“Okay, let’s go now,” Neville says. He snatches the map out of Hermione’s hands and stands up again. Harry quickly grabs his bag and the two of them walk out of the Great Hall. They are just about to go up the stairs when Oliver catches up with them.
“I can’t,” Draco starts. He chokes on his words and lets the tears fall, hiding his face in his hands. His body shivers while he weeps. He feels sick, and he can’t seem to swallow the lump in his throat. Harry’s arms are around him in seconds, holding him close against Harry’s chest. They don’t speak. The tears say all that needs to be said right now. For six weeks they believed they would become parents, and now, with a straightforward scan that dream has gone up in smoke.
From that moment on Draco, Hermione, Ron and I have been looking up hexes in the library or practising the Stunning Spell. Draco says he doesn’t mind, but I don’t like stunning him all the time. He always falls in the wrong direction and misses the cushions. Ron suggested to kidnap Mrs Norris and stun her. Hermione and Draco both agreed that was just a stupid idea, that we don’t need Filch to come after us for hurting his cat and that Ron could be my test subject for some time. He didn’t last long, complaining his back was killing him from falling onto it.
We went back to our dormitory and waited for Greg and Blaise to come back. When they did they told us that they had gotten all the supplies we need to lure Black to us. I told them I didn’t want to go through with the plan anymore, that they could all end up dead because of me. Draco asked me what I wanted to do instead and told me there was no way he would let me go after Black alone. I told them I didn’t know, that I had to think about it. So we paused the plan for now. Blaise went off to tell Luna. As soon as he was gone Greg started to tell us all about his day with Daphne. He’s madly in love with her, only she doesn’t seem to see it. I hope I’m not like him when I talk about Draco. He goes on and on about her beautiful hair and her sweet smile and her perfect eyes. Please tell me I’m not like that.
The Dementor doesn’t pay any attention to Harry. And Harry can’t do anything to stop it. He can only watch as Malfoy’s face is lifted off his legs and held by the Dementor.
After we exchanged our gifts we took a look at the pile of gifts at the end of my bed. Draco had some books about proper behaviour and the importance of pure bloodlines from his father. Like that will make him less gay and less in love with me. Draco didn’t even bother to open them, he just threw them into his trunk. His mother’s gift was better, she had sent him loads of chocolates with a note that he should share them with me.
Harry turns quickly and picks up his quill. His heart reaches in his chest and a smile forms on his face. Malfoy has beautiful eyes when he gets angry. Harry should get him riled up more often.
Like I was telling, we tried to convince Hagrid to let Norbert go, but he wouldn’t, saying it would die if he would set it free. And then I had an idea. Ron his older brother Charlie studies dragons in Romania. I asked Ron if we could send Norbert to him. Hagrid needed some convincing but soon realized that it would be the best change for Norbert. So Ron wrote a letter to Charlie.
Draco is okay now. He was released of the hospital wing on Sunday. Pansy is pampering him ever since. I don’t think he really likes it, he keeps pushing her hand away every time she tries to stroke his hair. His watery eyes from the hospital wing have been hunting me. I see them every time I close my eyes. They looked so hopeless and sad. I think something bad is going on with Draco. What if my dreams are coming true? What if he is ill? So ill he might die? Mom, I’m scared. How do I get him to talk to me, to tell me what is wrong? I need to help him, need to be with him.
“He will help cook his own dinner this Christmas,” Hermione says. “And then he will understand that it’s wrong to keep house-elves as slaves to serve ours.”
Draco's nostril’s flair, and he’s tempted to reach for his wand to destroy the untouched glass of wine on the table. Instead, he points his hand towards the door. “Let yourself out, before I hurt you,” Draco hisses. “I never want to see you here again.”
“I’ll get Madam Pomfrey,” Harry says. He jumps off Draco’s bed and starts for Madam Pomfrey’s office.
“Yes, I know. But still. Do they even mention Draco?” Pansy says. She opens the Daily Prophet. Draco looks up and stares again at Harry’s face. He wants to scream that he didn’t mend to kill him. That he loves the bastard. But he can’t. If he wants his mother to survive he needs to keep his head down. It’s almost time for Easter break. Draco will be in the same building as the Dark Lord. He can’t have him think Draco didn’t mean to kill Harry. It will be the end of him. The end for all Malfoy’s. And Draco won’t have any more blood on his hands. It’s already bad enough he’s responsible for Harry’s death. He can’t be responsible for his mother’s too.
I’m sitting in the Quidditch stands by the way. Today are the tryouts for the Slytherin team and Draco is one of the candidates. He saw me sitting here, I know he did, even though he pretends like I don’t exist. It’s nice to see him fly. He is a lot better than the other kids trying out and I think he can be sure that he will get a spot on the team. I hope he does, it was something he really wanted last year. I hope he will hang back afterwards and maybe talk to me. We’ll see.
Draco took it upon himself to inform his father about his success in potions. He was top of his class for this subject, he made sure the Mudblood wouldn’t beat him there. His father praised his good grades, but he didn’t invite Draco to join him in his dungeon. It was a disappointment and Draco sulked in his room for hours.
“He might not be allowed to,” James says. “I’m sure that if Draco could, he would have written to you.”
“Pettigrew was the secret keeper for his parents,” Harry explains when it’s clear Neville isn’t going to say anything else.
Hermione complained the day before the match that she didn’t know who she should support. She is a Gryffindor and all, but her two best friends are in Slytherin and on their team. She kept going back and forth with arguments why she wanted to support Gryffindor or Slytherin. It all seemed so unfair to her that she had to choose a side.
I stopped them. I stepped in front of Pettigrew and convinced them to lower their wands. I told them that you, dad, wouldn’t want them to become killers. And Draco chipped in that we needed him to prove that Black didn’t commit the crimes he was sentenced for. Lupin bound Pettigrew and as a safety percussion, we chained him to Lupin and Draco. Both I and Black helped Ron on his feet and together we set off down the passageway back to the castle. Black and I talked on our way out, he figured out he would be free now that we had Pettigrew and he told me he was my godfather. I told him I knew.  And then he said I could come and live with him. This means I never have to go live with the Dursleys again. I’m moving in with my godfather. Black was surprised I wanted to and I assured him I really mean it. That I would love to live with him. And then Black smiled and that made him look ten years younger than before and he looked more like the man in the wedding picture I have of you.
It’s still early morning and there is no rush. But still, Draco doesn’t think he can get out of bed. He knows he promised Lily that they would go to the park today. And maybe in some time, he will find a way to move without puking all over himself, but right now he just wants to lay still in his bed and not think about what it means that he’s sick for no reason.
Harry pulls him close again and Draco is shaken by the sincere look on Harry’s face. “We will find a way. I’ll talk to Dumbledore. He will help, I promise. We’ll get your mother to a safe place and then you don’t have to hide anymore. We don’t have to hide. Because I’m sick of lying to my friends and pretending I still hate you. I know it won’t be easy, and most people won’t understand. But I like you Draco, you’re the one that makes all this shit bearable.”
Professor Moody didn’t deny it. He took credit for his handy work. He wanted to know if Voldemort forgave the other Death Eaters, the ones that never went to Azkaban, or even searched for their lord. He was the one who concurred the Dark Mark in the sky during the Quidditch World Cup. And he made sure I would win the Tournament. He manipulated me all year and he is the one who used the Imperius curse on Viktor during the final task. Viktor didn’t attack Cedric because he wanted to win that badly, he wasn’t in control.
More commotion follows. The Wizengamot gets adjourned. Harry is transported back to his cell. Time passes while he stares at the walls around him. Draco always said the cells were a horrible place. Cold and clamp. Harry never thought about it after he’d helped Draco escape. Now the words of those conversations flood his mind.
I couldn’t keep my eyes of Draco, and neither could he. When we were supposed to bow, we both barely inclined our heads. We both raised or wands, but I couldn’t remember the spell Professor Snape had used so I went for something else that wouldn’t be harmful. The only thing I could think of was a Tickling Charm. Draco had used it on me before when I was annoying during one of his study sessions last year. So when it was time to cast the spell I shouted Rictusempra. A jet of silver light hit Draco in the stomach and he doubled up, wheezing. I could hear Professor Lockhart shouting in the distant that we were to disarm only, when Draco sank to his knees, barely able to move for the laughing. His eyes found mine and for a moment I could see he remembered too, that night and the fun we had together, and a proper smile formed on his face before it fell back into his neutral form.
By Wednesday Malfoy started to call me Scarface all the time. He joked that the lighting scar was the only pretty thing about me. Since I have horrible black hair that looks like a raven landed on my head. And my eyes are so poor that it’s a shame the glasses don’t hide them any better from view.
The whole class was looking at me and I was glad that Draco pulled me to my feet and dragged me out of the room. He told Ron to go tell Hermione after class that we’re going to see Professor Snape, knowing she would worry if we wouldn’t show up for dinner.
“Don’t believe you,” Neville says. There’s a smile again on his face and Harry wants to punch him. They both know Harry is full of shit. He would hate every person that will hurt his little sister. And that is what happens when you like someone. You get hurt, no matter how much you love them.
“Shut up, Hermione,” Neville says. “You don’t know half of it. That man is clever. He’s escaped Azkaban, he’s not going to get caught that easily.”
I wandered around the castle before I decided to go the Owlery to see Hedwig. Only I never made it. Professor Lupin called out to me from his office when I passed by. He asked me where Draco was and I told him that he was at Hogsmeade with the rest of our friends. And then Professor Lupin showed me a Grindylow to cheer me up. A Grindylow is a sickly green creature with sharp little horns and long spindly fingers. The professor explained that they are water demons and that they were easier to handle than the Kappas we studied in the lessons before that.
“Yeah, of course, you didn’t mean too,” Draco cuts in. “You never mean any off it. You don’t mean to be rude to Harry, you don’t mean to tease Teddy to the point where he doesn’t like you, and you don’t mean to be the biggest slut I know. And you never mean to hurt me, but you do it anyway,” Draco shouts.
Hermione opens her mouth to respond. But at that moment the first student gets sorted into Gryffindor and the entire table cheers, blocking out Hermione’s words.
Draco swallows. The Dark Lord knows. He’s aware that Draco doesn’t want to be his servant. That he’s his enemy.
So when Ron went after Nott, Draco walked by and I called out his name and he turned around to look at me. His eyes were on me for a second and then they moved to look at Nott. It’s then that he just turned again and walked out of the shop without saying one word to me. I wanted to follow him but was stopped by Fred, who just shook his head to tell me I shouldn’t follow. Meanwhile, Mr Weasley had told Ron to stop it. Nott was laughing, Ginny was crying and Nott’s father and Mr Malfoy started a nasty conversation with Mr Weasley. Before I realised what was going on Mr Weasley had thrown himself at Mr Malfoy, Fred and George were cheering their dad on when a dozen heavy spell-books came thundering down on Mr Weasley’s and Mr Malfoy’s heads.
Sirius had ordered pizza’s for dinner and made a bonfire in the garden when it became dark and chilly. I have no idea till how late we all stayed outside and talked, but it was amazing to celebrate my birthday this way.
Oh, and we helped Greg in asking Daphne to the dance. He wanted to make it special. So we planned the whole thing, with flowers and everything. It was almost like a wedding proposal and Daphne was delighted. I think that was the first time they kissed in public. It was really cute.
But all too soon Harry moves back and rests his head against Draco. He’s got a goofy smile on his face and Draco wants to move back in and kiss that stupid smile. It’s the most beautiful thing Draco has ever seen.
New tears fall from Draco’s eyes and Harry rushes back to the desk. He rests his hands on Draco’s sides and leans in for another kiss. “I love you too,” he tells Draco.
Harry pushes his hand through his hair. “I’ll try,” he says. “Not sure if Malfoy wants me to be his friend.” And that is the whole problem. Harry wants to help him, wants to be close to him. But he has no idea how.
We slowly walked down to the dungeons. I told Draco about what was said in the small room, about what Moody had said, that maybe someone put my name in to get me killed. I mentioned my dream from last summer wherein I’d heard Voldemort plotting my death. Draco stayed silent next to me, he just held my hand while I talked.
Cedric and I both went our separate ways again. And I know I ran into a Sphinx and that he had a riddle I had to solve, but I can’t remember what the riddle was any more or how I solved it. I only know that I did and that the Sphinx let me pass. And when I took the corner I could see the Cup. I started running towards it until I saw Cedric come out of a path further ahead. I knew I would never be able to catch up to him, with his long legs. I stopped in my tracks and just stared at Cedric getting closer to the cup.
“Yes, and Uncle Sirius, he’s deaf because of a spell Pettigrew cast when he tried to get away,” Iris pipes in.
After the lessons, I went to the library to start on my homework. But Malfoy and his bodyguards Crabbe and Goyle had followed me. Crabbe stole my bag and turned it around, so all the books fell out. And then Malfoy said that this is just the beginning. They left after that and I had to pick up all my stuff. One of my quills got broken and my Standard Book of Spells is damage from the fall from my bag. I’m glad they left, so I could finish my homework in peace.
Harry leans over Draco and searches the map. Who did Neville see? It can only be one person. Is he here? In the castle?
Narcissa came to look for us in the early morning and wasn’t even upset when she found me in her son’s bed. She told us to stay in Draco’s wing until Lucius would have left for the day. She told us the elves would bring us breakfast and now we’re just waiting for it to arrive. Draco keeps asking me when I’m going to put my book down an pay him some attention. I told him I had to tell you all about what happened and he stopped complaining after that. He’s reading a book right now, his hand entwined with mine on the bed. I’m really happy I’m here now and somehow I’m not that worried anymore about what is going to happen next.
I’d also written a letter to Sirius about it all. He wasn’t very impressed with me, taking off with Viktor in the middle of the night. I had to return him a promise that I won’t go wandering around at night and that I make sure I keep myself safe. He told me again that my name didn’t get into the Goblet of Fire by accident and that the person responsible is on their last chance of attacking me. He told me to go and practice stunning and disarming spells. And maybe some hexes. His message was clear, focus on the third task and forget all the crazy business with Mr Crouch. He told me again to trust Dumbledore and Professor Moody, and asked me please to not break any more school rules and to keep myself safe.
Ever since that night, there are more security measures. Filch is boarding up every little crack in the walls he can find. It’s kind of funny to watch. Also, we had a little meeting with our Slytherin friends. We didn’t invite Hermione and Luna, not sure if they will agree to help or even keep their mouth shut. We are working on a plan to find Black and give him the punishment he deserves. Daphne and Greg had some very good ideas and Blaise wondered if he could get some tips from his mother on how to best kill Black. Really, Blaise and his mom their relationship is a mystery to me. Who would ask his own mother on tips of how to kill someone? But more to the point, we have a plan at the ready, we just need to get all our supplies during our next trip to Hogsmeade.
It was that moment that Hermione snapped. She said something like ‘not that ridiculous Grim again’. Professor Trelawney turned to Hermione and told her she had never seen a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane. Hermione then got up and said she gave up and left the class. She hasn’t been back in Divination since then.
Harry opens his mouth and then shuts it again. He can’t say it. He will get a lot of people in trouble if he does. Mostly his dad and his Uncle Sirius.
The blasts from the commotion came closer and closer and Draco took out his wand and light it up. I tried to get mine, but somehow I’d had lost it. We looked around with the light of Draco’s wand but couldn’t find it. It made me feel vulnerable and I was glad Draco was with me, knowing he would protect me if it was necessary.
And then you stepped out of the wand, mom. My hand trembled then, and I almost let go. But you said that dad was coming, that he wanted to see me too. So I fought to hold on. I wanted to see dad too. And just thinking about it, makes me miss you so much. I hope it truly was you that came to help me from beyond. And it was good to see you and to hear you speak to me. I just wish you were here now too. That you could hold me and tell me that everything will be alright. Because I don’t think it will be for a long time and I don’t want to think about what that means for me and Draco. I don’t want a war. I don’t want anyone else to die.
“No, it’s not,” Harry says. His voice makes clear it isn’t a discussion. Draco can only imagine where Harry’s mind is, what he sees when he thinks back to the time where Draco was high all the time, and how much effort it took to stop using and to be clean. It must have been hell for Harry to see Draco like that. And the fact he stuck with Draco just shows how much the man loves him. Only Draco doesn’t think it will be enough if Harry will never get the child he wants so badly.
Remus pulls Harry against his chest. His arms are firm around Harry and it feels good. But Harry needs to get to Draco. He needs to tell him that all is okay. And thank him. If it hadn’t been for Draco, Harry would be lying dead on the floor. Draco saved him. With magic. He performed some amazing spell work without uttering a word. So Harry pushes against Remus and tries to step out of the hold.
Harry nods his head. Of course, Malfoy won’t give in that easily. Harry needs a better excuse to get Malfoy to accept his help. He looks down at his Potions book. It’s his worst subject. Harry likes to blame it all on Snape, but the truth is that he just doesn’t get it.
Myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end toilet when we came in and she was surprised to see me. She asked what I was still doing walking around alive. She thought I was dead by now since I hadn’t been around in weeks. I hadn’t thought about it, but I hadn’t been back there since she convinced me it was a good idea to slit my wrist open and kill myself. I had completely forgotten about Myrtle. And I was supposed to be her friend. I apologised to her and promised that I would come to visit her more often.
“I know,” Harry sighs. Tears are pricking at the corners of his eyes again. Somehow, he knows that the longer it takes before he can explain himself to Draco, the smaller the chance becomes that Draco will stay his friend.
Only moments later the door opened and headmaster Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall came in carrying what looked like a statue. Professor McGonagall went to get Madam Pomfrey. It seemed there had been another attack and this time it was Colin Creevey, the Gryffindor first year that used to follow me around at the beginning of the year. He was also petrified, still holding his little camera in his hand. When headmaster Dumbledore took it and opened the back a jet of steam hissed out of the camera. The inside of the camera was melted and I wondered what that mend. I still need to tell Hermione; maybe it will help her in figuring out what is attacking everyone.
Harry growled, stopping himself before doing more. Draco was his without a doubt, but he was a maiden. He would be deflowered on their wedding night and all Harry had to do was wait.
Harry’s cock harden and he needed to be inside Draco now. He wanted to make sure Draco remembered who he belonged to, but most of all he wanted confirmation that he was still the only man his body had ever taken.
As he trails Draco into the canvas tent, hands already itching with want, Harry knows they will fall together effortlessly.
Harry sometimes, really more often than not, said the exact wrong thing. He couldn’t control his words, mostly stuttering his way into making everything worse. Thumbing through a thesaurus, he groaned in frustration as he tried to figure out the perfect way to describe his fiancé.
Only then did Harry notice the furious blush creeping up Draco’s neck and his upside down Arithmancy book. He leaned over confidently, brushing his lips against Draco’s ear. “I think you meant it’s only our first date.”
He heard Draco shouting, but couldn’t make sense of the words, they were lost to the roar of the crowd as they traversed the dark club. The loo was tiny, copious stickers and graffiti allowing only glimpses of the dingy orange walls. Harry pushed Draco against the sink, throwing wandless silencing and locking spells. Draco’s eyes were wide, skin glowing and flushed, harsh panting barely audible over the screaming guitar. Harry’d never seen him look so beautiful.
This was what he knew for sure, less clear was why Draco was currently wearing a three-piece muggle suit. Not that Harry minded looking at Draco’s arse in those trousers—in fact, Harry’s own trousers were tightening quite delightfully at the view—but he was certainly going to stand out at a rock concert.
Harry closes Draco’s fingers over the wretched gem. Tears leak from his eyes, he wishes he could bring
He waves his arms wildly, ashes floating across Draco. “Michael’s jacket burst into flames in the middle of a rainstorm. I’m cursed! I just know it.”
Draco, attempting to hide his grin, quietly told her all about Harry. Green eyes, wild hair, brave, friendly. But, most importantly, ‘he’s just like me.’
Honestly, I deserve an Order of Merlin for not killing him on the spot. I glare at him through narrowed eyes. “As we have previously
.” She waved, winking at him as she stepped into the hearth, and green flames whisked her out of their flat.
—looks ravishing, of course. All thanks to me.” Pansy’s heels clacked loudly as she walked to the hearth, leering at Harry who was lounging with his feet up on the plush red ottoman. “I’m not sure you’ll make it to your show once you see him.”
A secret room in Grimmauld, warded to the teeth. Once filled with vial after vial, swirling with silvery memories, labelled carefully and stacked with care, now empty.
Draco laughs shamelessly as Harry describes the blistered wood and scorched wallpaper. “Your clothes were hideous anyway, I’d call this luck.”
I stand there expectantly, waiting for the first sentence of a disagreement we’ve had more times than I can count.
Harry gripped Draco’s bound hands. The Healers poured a crimson potion into Draco’s gaping mouth. They tightened their hands on his jaw, forcing him to swallow.
“As much as I would love to miss the entirety of the show, you would never forgive me,” Draco said, chuckling as he disentangled himself from Harry’s arms. “And you can always shag me in the loo.”
Harry climbed under the duvet and pulled Draco tight against his chest. “Starting tomorrow, I’m dosing you with dreamless sleep.”
It takes a few moments for me to realize we’re laying on the shattered remains of our dining room table. I can’t stop from laughing loudly as I take in our demolished kitchen, detritus from the crumbling wall and cold bodies strewn across the floor. I hiss as Harry slides across my sore rim, and he collapses next to me.
He easily spotted Malfoy’s white blond hair in the dark library. Harry hurried over, almost knocking him out of his chair in his haste to sit down. Breathless, he replied, “Yes, yes. Of course I will.”
It was all Harry could do to not stare. Draco was loose-limbed—likely from the shots of vodka Harry convinced him to take, despite his protestations about the sticky counter and exorbitant cost—and Harry was having trouble tearing his eyes from the neon lights shining vividly on Draco’s pearlescent skin, as he moved his hips and nodded his head to the beat. Despite Draco’s assertions that the actual symphony would be a far more enjoyable experience, he seemed to be having a good time and had not yet stuck his fingers in his ears.
Unable, unwilling, to let go, Narcissa bent to kiss his forehead, then began to lead them forward. ‘How was your first day?’
Harry exhales heavily, throwing himself across the unmade bed. “Can’t we just throw everything away and buy new shit?”
Harry looked away, sobbing, “I’ve got you. I’ll keep you safe.” He hated himself for lying, but how could he defend Draco from his own mind?
Draco looks out over rolling grassy hills, blanketed with dazzling wildflowers—a resplendent sea of luminous fuchsia. It’s beautiful (seductive).
Slowly, he realizes he is dead. Just like Harry, his angel of death, moving him through the doorway of this life, into the next. And what sweet release it is. He would suffer an eternity of fire, if only to be held a moment longer.
Draco was thrumming with anticipation as he marched towards the pitch. Cursing Harry’s flawless flying, “Potter, I need to speak with you. It’s urgent.”
Draco growled. “I come from a long line of Seers, as you very well know. Oneirology is a serious branch—”
He pulls my hand up, and kisses my knuckles, a euphoric smile on his face. “Maybe packing isn’t so bad after all.”
Fireworks explode across my vision, cock pulsating forcefully into my fist as Harry batters my prostate with each thrust. He snaps his hips, bottoming out and coming with a protracted moan, his release hot inside my arse.
They barely make it to the sofa before Harry’s mouth is searing a path across Draco’s jaw. “I know it was you…”
He hasn’t told Draco about the time-turner, about the past Harry has changed over and over to give Draco everything he deserves.
Harry perishes slowly, besieged by ghosts and longing, mourning all he has lost and all he has left to lose.
He winks mischievously and it’s like lightning in my veins. I yank Audra’s hand and pull her taut against my chest. My teeth slice through her carotid before she can make a sound. I keep my eyes trained on Harry drinking greedily from Rodney.
8:30AM - Draco has sat at the same table for nearly an hour. He’s been scowling for the last twenty minutes, embarrassed that he pushed back his morning meeting to wait. Chagrined, he quickly walks toward Gringotts, not looking back once.
7:35AM - Draco spies Harry through the window, and he swiftly hides his smile. Harry stands quickly, stumbling forward as Draco opens the door, “Draco, finally! Go out with me tonight.”
Harry met Draco’s grey eyes in the reflection. “Um, babe—not that you don’t look great, but don’t you think you’re overdressed?”
Harry catches me easily and I wrap my legs around his waist, crushing my mouth to his. It’s vicious and sublime, his seductive mouth moving aggressively against mine. I can taste the fresh blood dripping from his lips and I’m suddenly insatiable. I can’t get enough; enough blood, enough Harry. I’m ravenous and I pull back only long enough to beg. “Vanish these fucking clothes. I need you inside me. Now.”
He carefully removes the gag and blindfold, moving his hands tenderly over every cut and bruise. Whispering ‘Draco’ across his eyelids, over his cheeks, down his throat. After months of torture, each exhalation is a warm balm. Draco takes his first full breath in years. Wrapped tenderly in a cloak, Harry holds him in his arms. He is finally safe.
Draco walked down the stairs and all the breath left Harry’s lungs. He was in the tightest dark blue jeans Harry had ever seen. They were tucked into tall dragonhide boots and artfully ripped, giving Harry glimpses of the pale skin he was always eager to have under his hands. Pansy had transfigured one of Harry’s t-shirts so that it clung deliciously to Draco’s sinewy arms—
He slams me into the wall and I feel the disintegrating plaster cascading down my back. His hands are bruising against my arse and it’s exquisite. He’s feral, clawing at my skin, biting at my neck, growling unabashedly.
’ was written in perfect cursive on the wing. He unfolded it with sweaty hands, seeing that beautiful script again ‘
Draco’s ravenous by the time Harry returns from the market. Tart nectarines, juicy tomatoes, succulent peaches laid across the table, a veritable feast.
Harry snapped his teeth together, but was still so fucking flustered by Draco’s appearance; the dark eyeliner made his eyes brighter—a beautiful quicksilver—and his slim body was irresistible in Harry’s clothes. He reacted without thinking, grabbing Draco’s waist, pulling him down the step and crowding Draco against the bannister. Clearly pleased, Draco blushed and bent his head, capturing Harry’s mouth in a searing kiss. His hands tugged at Harry’s wild hair, pulling a moan from Harry, and Draco’s long fingers tightened around his curls even further as he deepened their kiss. Harry couldn’t remember the last time he had gotten this worked up this quickly, and he was just grinding his burgeoning erection into Draco’s thigh, when Draco pulled away.
When Malfoy—ostracized and despairing—appears on his doorstep, Harry lets him in without a word. Tea, a warm blanket, gentle hands…eventually, love.
Harry stilled, considered the ache in his chest, space carved behind his ribs where his heart had once been. The savage devotion burning through him. The dangerous grace of Draco’s hands shaping his soul.
A crisp apple bruises on the floor as Harry, luscious and supple, writhes beneath Draco’s devouring mouth.
It was fucking intense—the pressure on his cock, music thundering through the walls, Draco’s hands tight on his shoulders. Harry wailed into the curve of Draco’s neck as he came, and the pleasure shaking through him pushed aside all his embarrassment about finishing so fast.
“Draco, besides the fact that he hasn’t asked for help, I don’t think you’d make a very good Fairy God…father.”
Draco dragged him towards the changing room, “You can celebrate later.” Finally, fucking finally, he crowded Harry against the wall, trying to claw his uniform off, and as his lips finally met warm, brown skin, he breathed, “I want your body now.”
He’s such a stubborn prick. I never would’ve guessed that I would be the pushover in our relationship…alas, here we are.
He doesn’t even make it to his date with Chris, as his wardrobe is charred beyond recognition before he can save anything.
He lopes out of the kitchen, wide smile exposing his sharpened teeth, and I wish I could drag him back and kiss him senseless.
We will leave the things that are easily replaced, but I refuse to abandon all of our possessions simply because you’re a lazy wanker.” The last part comes out as a furious hiss,
Harry and Margo are in the middle of ordering when the cooler magnificently combusts. Ice cream sublimating into steam from the scorching flames.
I hear him cursing as he stomps into the sitting room. Clearly finding nothing to distract him, he huffs his way into the kitchen and slams a cabinet so hard that the wood cracks.
The Order clearly thought they were safe here. As though Potter could blend in, as if he was anything less than
them. For some reason the unforgivables always leave a bitter aftertaste. He leads them into the kitchen blathering on about natural light and I lean casually in the doorway, waiting for his signal.
Pain lances my shoulder. Falling into damp leaves, whimpering, scrabbling for safety. I have never known torment like this. A fierce shadow moves in the trees.
7:45AM - Draco asks for the most complicated latte he can think of, hoping to spend more time in the warm café. He tries to convince himself it’s because of the rain and not because of Harry. It takes them longer than ten minutes to get him his drink, likely more from spite than all the intricacies of his order. He takes one last look around before Disapparating from the side alley.
When the Aurors catch Draco, he is ravaged. Rituals, potions, fires. Edges softened by love, now sharpened by grief.
He looks up, hope lighting up his features, and I can’t stop a soppy grin from spreading across my face. Harry’s stunning, beautiful face radiant in the waning sunset. He grabs me, peppering my face with wet kisses until I break into an undignified giggle and push him away. “Stop it, you mongrel. Go get us supper.”
Harry watched Draco adjusting his tie from the doorway, before walking into their room. Draco was standing in front of a gilded full-length mirror that he insisted Harry buy before he would even consider moving in. It had been one of many, many necessities—according to Draco—that Harry had willingly acquired so they could finally live together.
Harry surprises me by returning within the hour, bringing two mouthwatering Muggles with him. They’re remarkably attractive and their delicious scent quickly saturates the hall.
“Harry…I’m still confused. Why do we have 47 skeins of yarn, 11 potted plants, 6 boxes of apples, and 3 kittens again?”
. You, an uncivilized heathen, may not appreciate it, but I’m sure others will. According to Pansy, ‘dick pics’ are all the rage with muggles.”
“Well, you know my parents, perhaps it was their fault. I was eleven. I refuse to apologize for everything I have ever done.”
“Harry! He’s back, he’s back.” Tears rolled down his cheeks. “It burns. Harry! My arm is burning, save me. Save me!”
“No—okay, fine, you win. I don’t listen to everything you say,” Harry said, tugging on Draco’s lapel. “But it doesn’t change the fact that you can’t wear a suit to the show.”
“Yes, Draco, I understand she’s talented. I’m just trying to figure out why there’s a painting of your dick on the mantel.”
“It’s n-not the symphony,” he hiccoughed, still chuckling, earning another over-exaggerated scowl from Draco. “Manchester Orchestra is a rock band.”
It took several fumbling seconds for Harry to get their cocks out and slick them up. Harry laved his tongue across Draco’s jaw as he wrapped his hand around them both. The salty tang of sweat and Draco’s orange blossom soap overwhelmed him as he sucked a bruise into Draco’s soft skin. Harry needed to keep his mouth busy so he wouldn’t cry out, the relief from finally getting his hands on Draco—and the delicious satisfaction of Draco’s cock dragging against his—burned through him.
8:45AM - Harry slams open the door startling the entirety of the café into silence. He looks around wildly. The patrons recover quickly, chattering loudly as Harry charges out the door.
