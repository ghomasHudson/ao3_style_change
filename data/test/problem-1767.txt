All this time, as information came dripping in, as improvement happened slowly, he was waiting for his mother to come visit him. He was sure she would find a way to pretend to be a muggle, even if it took her some practice to do it, but he had been completely out of it for seven months, surely that would be enough time? Unless she had been caught while practicing. That was a disturbing thought, but there was nothing he could do to find out. His mother never came.
Potter—who sat on the opposite side of the table, currently busy lathering his own piece of toast with what, at any other point in time, Draco would have called him out for as a truly obtuse amount of jam—shot Draco an alarmed look as the Slytherin proceeded to have a coughing fit nearly as awful as the one Potter had had in that alley the other night. Only, of course, minus the blood.
Guys. You didn’t honestly think I would ever kill off Draco, did you? To quote my beautiful cinnamon roll Blaise: It’s wounding. Consider me wounded. I admit there may be a decent amount of angst in this fic, but at the end of the day it isn’t out to hurt you, promise. Howeverrrrr, while Drarry is 1000% endgame, their journey is far from over. I’m really sorry to all those who were looking for a (relatively) quick read, but brevity has never and likely will never be a strong suit of mine, especially not regarding writing. Please be patient with me, I promise it’ll be worth the wait in the end!!
Draco had panicked. There, he admitted it. And in his panic, he perhaps hadn’t behaved entirely sensible. Instead, he’d jumped up from his chair, almost knocking it backwards, and bounded out the restaurant, ignoring the worried exclamations from his friends and the alarmed cries of the other restaurant-goers, only to Disapparate the moment he was outside.
Ok so this chapter is a little shorter than usual (sorry!!) but I promise the next chapter will in turn be a lot longer. Also, this one's entirely in Draco's POV, so enjoy!
“Attack the Chosen One, without a wand?” Yaxley barked an entirely mirthless laugh. “I may be slightly insane, Potter, but don’t make the mistake of thinking me a fool.”
in me or anything. It’s a personal issue, I get that. But…” He chewed on his lower lip, and blast Draco’s traitorous eyes, they immediately zeroed in on the motion.
When he looked up again, a smile was stretched taut across his mouth. “Dad’s not really in the picture anymore, I’m afraid. He and my mother went through a nasty divorce, just a little while after Delia died. It was just…a lot on everyone. I don’t blame either one of them. Anyway, he doesn’t live in the States anymore, so there’s not much he can do.”
Relief flooded through the Gryffindor, and he immediately relaxed. “Christ, Nic, I thought you were some type of criminal. You gave me a proper fright.” Harry shook his head, huffing out a breath. “What are you doing out and about anyway? And in such a heavy cloak? Mate, you do realise it’s the middle of summer, right?”
Harry very nearly choked on air, and he could feel Draco’s entire body tense beside him, unadulterated anger thrumming through the air as a heavy, heavy silence encompassed the hallway.
“Goodness gracious, Priyawadi,” yelped Healer Hodkinson, earning himself the type of glare that would have any man with half a brain cowering in fear. “The boy’s barely awake, you can’t simply bombard him with such information!”
He hadn’t expected some heartfelt apology, hadn’t even expected Lucius to reply at all. Going on past experiences alone, Draco could say with complete certainty that being actually helpful was beyond the man’s capabilities.
They sat there in relatively tense silence for a few minutes more, Harry silently eating his Thai while Malfoy sat staring at the fireplace, evidently uneasy, when Harry finally decided enough was enough.
“We met once before a few weeks back,” the man said. “Right here, as a matter of fact, investigating the Acturin deal. Name’s Jennings.” When Draco still didn’t react, the man added awkwardly, “I apprenticed under Joachim Heind?”
He looked once more at Yaxley, who was still grinning, and then at Harry—Harry, who was white as a sheet, whose eyes were wider than usual, whose expression was drawn. Draco gritted his teeth.
,” Harry gritted out and slowly but surely forced himself upwards into a seating position, ignoring the Healers’ protests as he did. “It doesn’t matter I just woke up. I don’t
, recoiling ever so slightly at the sound of his voice, inching towards the fireplace as though she might like to jump in and Floo far, far away from this flat.
“Maybe you—” Draco stopped midsentence and cleared his throat, and when Harry chanced a quick glance at the Slytherin’s face, he was surprised to find it flushed as well. “Maybe you could move a bit? You’re, err, blocking the way.”
“That they did,” Draco said softly, looking back down into the dark depths of his tea with a small, sad smile. “But no one else even took me seriously.”
But then Nic replied, “Mom stayed in New York. She…hasn’t been quite right, since Da—since Delia died. But my aunt’s taking care of her while I’m over here, so she’s doing as well as can be expected.” He said it with a tight smile, but Harry could hear the pain lacing his tone.
Yaxley ignored this and continued, “You’ve surprised me this past week, and yet I’m almost confident the question you truly want to ask me would not. Think of me what you will, Draco, but the Dark Lord valued me for a reason. I can read people, you know, better than most others, and I have read you, and I think you and I both know what it is I discovered.”
Before Harry could even begin to protest, Robards held up a silencing hand and said curtly, “I know you may think yourself fully capable of defending yourself—and, as I said before, you really are one of my best Aurors, Harry—but even the best of the best need help at times. Especially after last night.”
Philomena. On second thought, Draco mused, it was highly probable the shopkeeper wouldn’t even allow Potter to set foot in her store, not as a known half-blood with muggle ties.
If not for the blond’s murderous expression and the overall static tension in the air, Harry might have laughed; no one did I’m-too-good-for-you-so-bow-you-lowly-peasant quite like Draco Malfoy.
But Draco didn’t budge. Quite the contrary; he took a step closer, until he loomed rather menacingly over Harry, one hand sprawled on the table, one on the back of Harry’s chair. Which was just brilliant. Lovely, really. After all, it wasn’t like the bloody height difference was bad enough when they were standing.
Fortunately, there was no mention of what else had occurred that night, nor of Potter’s brief stay at St. Mungo’s. Draco was glad the press hadn’t gotten wind of it. With Potter’s would-be murderer still running loose, such coverage would do far more damage than any actual good.
. He would not raise false hopes, and he would not read into this, and he would not indulge in delusions. Because that’s all they were—delusions, and fantasies, and that was quite enough of that.
“Your father is a very…prideful man, Draco, as you very well know,” she said softly, cautiously. Wise move, Harry thought as he felt his boyfriend stiffen, jaw clenched. He gripped Draco’s hand tighter. “In his eyes, you don’t deserve his help, not after you renounced the Dark Lord and then proceeded to ignore him for three years. I’m not saying you acted wrong”—she added quickly when Draco opened his mouth to protest, eyes stormy—“but, in Lucius’ opinion, you abandoned him. Therefore, you’ll have a hard time getting him to be of any assistance to you, particularly if it has anything to do with Harry.”
The now-youngest Weasley was absolutely adorable. Harry had only briefly met little Roxanne that very morning before she, her mum and her dad left for the Burrow, where Fred had been staying with Molly and Arthur for the past few days. But it hadn’t taken more than a single look at her for Harry’s heart to go warm and his eyes to tear up. And it wasn’t even his fault.
Ron gave a satisfied little nod. “Good. What I was trying to say is that I had my doubts about you and Ginny, and they turned out to be valid. You broke up, and you broke her heart. That’s a fact.”
“Ron,” George Weasley’s voice said. Except his tone was even terser than usual, laced with an anxiety, a worry that had Harry’s gut immediately clenching in apprehension. “Ron, get over here now. We’re at the shop and—that’s it, love, deep breaths—look, we’re at the shop and I think the baby’s coming. Okay, no, I’m
That certainly didn’t stop him from cooing, “Oh, look at that. So sorry, I amend my statement; we aren’t going anywhere,
Harry pivoted in his seat to glower up at Draco with all his might, because what the ever-loving fuck gave the git the impression he could just barge in here—while Harry was on a
And then, before Draco could so much as form another thought, the man pushed at his manacle, pushed and pushed until his skin was red and scuffed, and Draco momentarily panicked, sure Yaxley would somehow escape now, and it’d be on Draco for letting him, for just sitting there, and Harry—
Draco’s gaze coasted across the room once more, desperately looking for something to latch onto, something that might get him out of this mess.
After they’d finally finished stowing everything away again, Harry had journeyed into the kitchen for some water, and Draco had trailed after him. And be it due to their mutual exhaustion after the duel, or perhaps their shared boredom, Harry couldn’t say for sure—but for some reason or another, he now found himself sitting slumped against the fridge, cross-legged and clutching a large bar of chocolate, while Draco sat to his left, legs drawn up to his chest, hair a tousled but at the same time still perfectly elegant mess, thoughtfully chewing on his own broken-off piece of chocolate as he stared ahead into nothing.
were all paired up and in love and perfectly happy. Hermione and Ron, Seamus and Dean, Neville and Luna. Harry was pretty sure Parvati was seeing someone, too, and Lavender was, well, Lavender, and Ginny—
He did not, however, back off. If anything, Harry had the feeling he drew even closer, matching Harry’s pace with ease. It made Harry’s cheeks flush and his heart do very bizarre things indeed.
And he did. Usually, the colouring of Nic’s skin was similar to Harry’s, if perhaps a few shades lighter. But right now, in the dark of the alleyway, where not even the warm, golden rays of summer sun could reach them, Nic was practically as white as a sheet, with dark smudges discolouring the area right below his eyes, making him seem years older and wearier than he actually was, beads of sweat unmistakable as they trickled down his brow.
,” he repeated, “Potter is such a confused, oblivious mess that I doubt he’d realise my feelings for him aren’t just platonic if I whacked him over the head with it. Trust me, it’s a real, legitimate issue of his.” Draco couldn’t help but be reminded of that very morning, when Nic The Bastard had showed up and almost driven Draco to murder before he’d even gotten his morning coffee.
Draco couldn’t help himself—he laughed, although it really was more of a sob than anything else. “I do, don’t I? Too bad he hates my guts now.”
was hidden underneath the sleeves of Potter’s—obviously red, how could it not have been red—pullover, etched onto which was the logo of some muggle sports team.
Draco gritted his teeth so hard he wouldn’t have been surprised had one or two broken in the process.
? “If you two lovebirds aren’t too busy staring at each other, by all means, enlighten us. What has our favourite Saviour been doing to pass his time while stuck in this prison of a hospital?”
Harry made a startled little sound, but he didn’t pull back again. Instead, he melted into the kiss, arms looping around Draco’s neck—and then they were full-out snogging again, completely uncaring that they were technically in public, out in the open, where anyone could see them.
Pansy frowned, but her tone remained doggedly optimistic. “But that’s great! Honestly, I didn’t even think you two would manage
He glanced over at Draco, who still had his wand raised, expression hard. It was obvious he wasn’t exactly pleased by Ginny’s sudden and unannounced arrival—neither was Harry, to be perfectly honest. But when their eyes met, the Slytherin sighed, motioning for the door.
“Better pessimistic and alive than optimistic and dead,” Draco snapped, reverting to insults as was his default, because it was just so, so much easier to pretend when he didn’t have to be civil to the beautiful prat. “This is stupid and reckless and absolutely insane. And with
ten times now, don’t even try denying it. Besides, I happen to remember you being a decent duellist back in Second Year. Thought you’d jump at the chance of a rematch.”
“I don’t know much more than you do.” His voice was…oddly gentle. A gigantic contrast to the venomous hiss it’d been minutes before. “It shouldn’t be possible. But he really is gone. Robards’s already had the whole place searched from top to bottom. Every office on every floor in every building. There’s no sign of him anywhere.” He inhaled deep. “No one knows how he did it. One moment Takeuchi was in there with him, questioning him, then they left the room for five minutes—and when they came back in, Yaxley was gone. You—”
Or at least Weasley did. If Draco weren’t at that moment so preoccupied with his boyfriend, he might have laughed at the Weasel’s truly comical expression.
Ginny sent him a death-glare, but then turned back to Harry. Her eyes were still steely and full of anger, but when she spoke again, there was something else in her tone, something desperate. “Do you love me, Harry?”
Draco pulled Harry into a narrow, dark alleyway, and he didn’t need any light to be able to say with utmost certainty that the Slytherin was currently scowling something fierce, for the simple reason that he could.
of it, of kindness and compassion and warmth and love, had those traits woven into his DNA, his magic, his very existence.
, then. Hmm, well, I don’t think duelling in here would be all too wise. Although the idea of destroying a few of these eyesores you call decoration is mighty appealing, I have to live here, as well, so we really shouldn’t wreck the place.”
Draco didn’t bother conceal the relief that engulfed him then, like a tidal wave crashing down on an unsuspecting fisher’s boat, and he sighed and let himself fall back onto the bed. “Thank Salazar.”
Harry furrowed his brow, turning to face Draco fully. The blond still had his gaze trained on some unfixed point ahead, chocolate clutched in one hand and wand held loosely in the other, and he looked… Well. Draco looked sad.
Harry blinked a few times, both so that his brain might catch up to his surroundings and in an effort not to look directly into the blinding white lights shining down from above.
Harry crossed the living room to grab a biro, all the while chuckling despite himself, and penned a quick letter to Robards, telling him about Malfoy’s family connections to Craigs, and requesting they tag along. He conveniently left out all mention of Malfoy’s hesitance, making sure to emphasize what an asset the Slytherin would be to the investigation. When he was done, he folded it and headed back towards where the barn owl was still sitting more or less patiently by the windowsill.
But now—now he looked very much nervous, with his drawn face and rumpled hair, as though he’d either gotten stuck in a windstorm or simply raked his fingers through it one too many times, even going so far as to fiddle with the sleeves of his robe. It was almost like something a
. It had an intensity to it Harry had never felt before, and he loved it more than words could possibly describe.
. Sure, Ginny was great, but he’d broken off their relationship for a reason. If fate now suddenly decided to go ‘nope, you’re destined to be together forever after all’…well, it would be awkward as hell, to say the least.
other than stare into those disgustingly beautiful green eyes and think to himself that perhaps this was its own brand of torture in itself.
When, again, no answer came, spoken or otherwise, not even the rustling of paper or the squeaking of a chair—that’s when Draco began to get truly suspicious. Wes, Robards’ secretary, had assured Draco just minutes before that Robards was in his office, sorting through paperwork. He’d even buzzed up to let the Head Auror know Draco was there, to which Robards had responded simply ‘send him on up’.
And then there were the possibility of meeting aliens. How might they judge humanity, and how would humanity respond? Would they teach people more peace, or more war? Were they deeply similar to humans, or so different as to be completely incomprehensible? Or somehow both? How would we deal with them? Ethical dilemmas, culture crashes – lots of people wrote about aliens, and in a stunning variety of ways.
“Very good, I hope you can appreciate that this was a necessary thing to ask, because some people are reluctant to admit to, hum, certain things while their mother is in the room, but of course, your mother insisted on being present. An admirable instinct, of course, to protect a mother’s feelings, but in this case it could be lethal.”
The conversation sounded a bit weird to him, stilted, even as what he told her was definitely one of the things he had wanted to tell her about. Maybe it was Hermione hearing Pansy’s side of the conversation that made it feel a bit off, he didn’t know.
“Well, the adults let us have our engagement, confirmed it for us, made it count. And we meant it, deeply. You know how serious children can be. And of course we were best friends ever after, and marrying my best friend was the best possible thing, so there was no reason to doubt it.”
“So we’re in some luck, he’s just finished his shift and he’s coming here right away, and then you two can talk and figure things out. Oh, and I said I’ll order us all pizza, so, what toppings do you like?”
He might not feel up to history books, but he was reading more and more in that last period before he would get to leave his bed. Resting took up most of his time, but light reading was a close second.
And so they did that too, finding the number for the flowershop in a big, newspaperlike book with extremely thin pages. Draco hadn’t known he owned that book – he thought he had read every book in the house, but this one he had not even seen. “The biggest, loveliest bouquet they can make,” Draco insisted. “With yellow roses in it. Yellow roses are her favorite.”
Draco didn’t ask about Aunt Petunia this time. Whenever she came up, Harry stopped talking very quickly. Still, he wanted to know what could make Harry, one of the most easygoing people he knew, get so upset he disliked anything he associated with her. Floral patterns. Queen Elizabeth. Scones. Bacon. Hair products. Respectability. Draco now added Jane Austen to his mental list of things Petunia Dursley liked and so Harry didn’t.
Kenny just laughed at that. But he seemed happy with the chocolates. He went down and checked when Mohammed was next working (that night), and Harry would get his the next day.
Harry came over on Saturday morning. Kenny rushed around getting ready, shouting things like “If the microwave decides to be ornery, Harry can just call for some take-away for you both”,  “If you guys exhaust each other and I have to do more than I have to come Monday, I will just drug you both down so I can get some goddamn peace, you know I will” and “Eat whatever in the fridge or freezer that doesn’t have a weekday written on it. No matter what you do, don’t eat the lasagna for Monday, if you eat that lasagna I will kill you both, because I absolutely won’t be in any shape to cook anything come Monday, oh fuck me, two double shift in two days, those fucking insane admin people, I hate them so much, but I will hate them more on Sunday night, thank fuck for coffee at least, come to think killing you two will take even more energy than cooking, ughhh”
“Yes, let us do that for Mary, send her flowers. And unless chocolate is too strange, could we do that too? Mary really likes the belgian seashell-shaped things, filled with nougat, do you know what those are?”
“Oh. You were that close to dying. I didn’t realise. God, I’m a bellend, sorry. Hermione told me about some people dying of this stuff because they refused to leave the magical world. I’m glad you didn’t die.”
It wasn’t like home, but it was lovely. He felt taken care of. He felt seen, and he decided that this was the most important thing for a birthday.
He bought whatever sounded good, or interesting, or different from what he had already heard, or similar to what he had already enjoyed. Those loose criteria kept the CDs flowing in. He even bought some just because he liked the names or covers. He bought a record called Abraxas because it reminded him of his grandfather, and although he didn’t think his grandfather would appreciate it that much, he rather liked it. He got one called Blue, because the close-up of the woman who had made it made him feel sad in a way he thought he perhaps needed to be sad, and it turned out the record did that for him too, although how exactly songs were like tattoos, as she claimed, remained unclear.
Usually they would have a cup of tea in hand – Draco would have his decaf, trusting Mary and Kenny who said stimulants were not good for him at this stage, but Harry didn’t care for “tea that didn’t work”, “tea with all the joy sucked out”, “swill that tastes like this fucking illness, I swear”, “no better than herbal”. Harry would have his builder’s tea, or else a cup of cocoa.
“I don’t see how that can be fixed, really. The connection could be there, it could exist, but Mother would need to know enough to buy a phone in the first place, and then know the spells to use, and how to use them, and on top of that she would need to know which part is the SIM card, remember how Kenny had to do that part for me, and then she would need to get the information about her number to me. That is a lot – she doesn’t even know where I am, I think.”
“We can start off by boiling water in it, as a test. Or, even better, for tea! I could do with a cuppa.”
Apparently the argumentative child was removed by wand. She had a point, Draco thought. Sabine. His own first daughter was to be named Sabine, after Pansy’s maternal grandmother, he’d known that forever. And now there would never be a Sabine Malfoy in the world as he thought there would be, but instead the world had a Sabine Flint. A fresh wave of grief over the loss of Pansy washed over him. Apparently he had lost her conversation too, and he only heard parts of Pansy and Hermione’s conversation as it happened.
Harry came over at five. Draco had rested, and wore a fresh dressing gown over his pyjamas from yesterday. Changing clothes and having Harry over would still be a much for one day. He wished he could celebrate in style, though – wished for dress robes, or perhaps a nice suit and tie, for having showered the same day instead of the day before. Perhaps next year – it should definitely be possible next year. Harry wished him happy birthday and gave him a big hug, which was a bit awkward in the wheelchair, but was still nice.
On the kitchen floor was Mary, laying very still and looking very, very wrong in the face. He called out her name. She didn’t react. He swallowed back the bile rising in his throat, forcing it down. He couldn’t force back the feeling that a part of him wanted him to freeze in place and never move again, though, or the images of from the war which were flooding his field of vision uninvited. So much death, so much blood – but the worst were the parade of dead bodies that had no blood on them at all. Mister Goyle, Greg’s father, face strangely purple. Professor Lupin, so pale. Aunt Bella, with her head doing something it shouldn’t be able to do. Strangers and known faces, laid out after. After.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said awkwardly, an odd look on his face.“I feel like… shit, I WANT to have this conversation, and I know I started it, but I also am not really ready for it. Shall we, ummmmh, go test out the microwave?”
“Thank you. I suppose you couldn’t have known that. And thank you for wanting to save me when you thought I was a prisoner in my own home. The truth is, with another man, I might have been.”
Draco twisted uncomfortably in his chair. Was it possible they had entirely forgotten him? Pansy seemed to have moved into the mode of dealing with a potential friend now, doling out small confidences to see how the other woman would handle it. He never understood female friendships very well, but they were a lot more verbal than any other type, certainly, even than his own friendship with Pansy.
Muggle politics – he might understand it one day and he might not. He was in no hurry, he had years of muggle newspapers ahead of him. For once he felt content at the thought of all the time ahead before he could go home. His veranda chair was nearly as comfortable as the one in the living room, and it was a lovely day. He was wearing a woolen blanket over his pajama legs, and another over his shoulders, and his dressing gown was quite warm, so he was perfectly comfortable out here.
“No, that’s just it, I couldn’t. It wasn’t about priorities. I mean, I understand that it looks like a ‘moral choice’ or whatever, and that I made the brave or heroic one or what you might call it, but the thing is, it really doesn’t feel like a choice in the situation. It feels like there is only one single possible course of action. And somehow people always… ughhh, I’m not saying you’ve done anything wrong now, right? I’m just saying I’ve had so many people saying the sort of thing you just said, that it’s a choice, that it makes me sort of… sick. Frustrated. I don’t know. It just doesn’t feel true. Like, at all.”
Back in the living room, the big one with the sea view, Harry was on the sofa, frantically pushing buttons on his bright green little phone with his thumbs. Draco couldn’t understand how Harry could write text messages that fast – not just the fast tapping, but hitting the right one of the tiny buttons, and knowing which one had to be tapped how many times to get which letter, or held in for the number, or… Draco could write text messages, of course, but a short one took him several minutes. Harry insisted it was just practice, but Draco could not see how he would ever get enough practice to text like that.
“The headmaster,” Harry was choking. “He would… oh God, I can’t even imagine that talk. He would be all ‘Sometimes, Harry, our hearts makes decisions we cannot support with our whole selves…’ Oh no, I can imagine it, I really can…”
“Very good. I understand this is hard, Mrs. Malfoy, Draco. I am sorry to ask such intrusive questions, and I hope you know I would not do that unless it was absolutely necessary. Now. Have you ever mixed sleep potions with any type of muggle medicine?”
He wanted to argue more with Harry Potter, he thought, and the opportunity would arise. Every Tuesday, apparently, because Harry had to give up something called Tae Kwon Do class on Tuesdays because it was still too strenuous for his body.
Eventually Mary introduced options for lighter activities, and tried to figure out what he liked – how about reading? What would he like to read? He had no idea what sort of reading materials muggles might have – did they have books at all? He couldn’t remember – but Mary got him a stack of various colorful but eerily unmoving magasines, and promised more of whatever type he enjoyed, and that later, when he was better, they could do the same for books. What would muggle books be like? He couldn’t begin to guess.
Draco was going to be sick. He was going to be sick, and he was going to throw up all over the perfectly clean, ivory-white bed sheets, and he was going to do so until the horror and fear and pain became secondary and his head grew so dizzy his mind stopped reeling.
His hands went up to tangle in Harry’s hair, and in response the latter’s grip on his shirt collar tightened, pulling him closer. Not that Draco could have moved if he’d wanted to (which, it should be stressed, he did not); the wall pressing against his back and the Harry crowded against his front effectively held him in place.
But he didn’t ask that, because Draco looked genuinely nervous, skin a shade paler than usual, long fingers clutching the coffee mug like a lifeline, eyes trained resolutely on the kitchen counter. And Harry’s heart thawed a bit and he said sincerely, “Of course you can, Draco. I already told you: anything you want to talk about, anything at all, I won’t judge.”
“No,” he gritted out. “No, I don’t. And, frankly, I’m in no mood for your mind games right now, so either tell me what you’re so clearly itching to say or do us both a favour and shut up.”
After that, the conversation devolved into mindless chatter, like how Seamus and Dean's new neighbor was an asshat who apparently loved Metallica a little too much, or how Lavender had missed out on a role in a theatre production she'd been dead-set on for months now all because her would-be costar wanted his girlfriend to have the part, or how Neville had just discovered a new species of man-eating flower over in Asia that had almost devoured Luna on not one, not two but three separate occasions ("The poor thing just wants a friend," she'd replied sagely).
“Mr. Potter,” interrupted Healer Preedan before Harry could open his mouth to vehemently and vociferously defend his boyfriend. “Are you saying Mr. Malfoy did this? Because if so, we need to alert Deputy Head Auror Gilligan immediately, she should be on her way anyway—”
The instant he was gone, Draco’s sighed dramatically, rolling his eyes as he walked the few steps back to his armchair and fell into it with another especially forceful sigh.
Even if Draco weren’t so hyperaware of Harry at all times, the way the Gryffindor went completely still was unmissable. At the back of the room, Robards and the unnamed Auror exchanged a stony look and then left the room without another word, slamming the door shut behind them.
Draco scowled, and Harry nearly opened his mouth to admonish the blond. However, he promptly stopped himself. Had Harry gone through with it, that was something neither Draco nor his friends would likely ever let him live down. And he’d survived enough awkwardness for one day, thank you very much.
“Finally,” she said, crossing her arms. “Took you long enough. I was beginning to fear the both of you would never get over yourselves.”
“Anyway, enough talk,” said Ron then, finally moving away from where he, Hermione, Parvati, Lavender and Ginny still stood clustered by the fireplace, attention fixed on the kitchen. “I want some of that cake.”
It made him seem infinitely younger, softer, like he would perhaps look in a world where Voldemort hadn’t murdered his parents at the age of one, where he hadn’t had to fight for survival every year since in a world where everyone either wanted something from him, or wanted him dead.
Harry wanted to laugh. What came out instead, however, was more of a smothered choke, and Ron gave him an alarmed look.
Then Harry had started growing up, and it was true what people said, that you only ever really grew into your features during your teenage years, because Harry Potter was a prime example for it. He’d started off too thin, a bit scrawny, even, and ended up with a fine but definite layer of muscles over the years, both from Quidditch and all the other ungodly things he and his friends had gotten up to. He’d grown in height, too, until he was almost as tall as Draco (that had irked him to no end during Fifth Year), and his face had gone from juvenile and slightly chubby to angular and well-defined.
And Harry didn’t even take offense at that less-than-desirable comparison, because Draco had called him
Ron blinked at him a few times, eyes wide. Harry felt distinctly uncomfortable lying in his hospital bed, unable to so much as sit up but at the same time painfully aware of half a dozen pair of eyes boring into him.
Draco shot him a quick narrow-eyed glance over his shoulder. “I’m going to go change out of these wretched wet eyesores. In the meantime, do me a favour, Potter, and don’t get yourself killed. Think you can manage that?”
She opened her mouth to speak, to say something that would no doubt just make Draco’s day even worse, and the latter wondered miserably when his life had become such utter shit (trick question, it’d always been utter shit).
“Now,” Robards said. “There are still plenty of things I need to get done today, and I’m sure you all do too, so I’ll make this short. Auror Malfoy will watch over Auror Potter until this would-be assassin is identified and detained. Once Auror Potter is discharged from St. Mungo’s, I suggest Auror Malfoy take up temporary residence at Potter’s flat, after all, it’s entirely possible the culprit might try to get to him that way. I'd also suggest the both of you refrain from coming into the office any time soon, with the Ministry being such a crowded place. Consider the successful realisation of this partnership your assignment for the imminent future.” He paused, glancing from Draco to Potter. “I trust you two can maintain a professional, civil partnership for the duration of the matter?”
They didn’t talk about Nic for the rest of the morning. But less than ten minutes after the beignet-incident, Draco shut his book with a decisive slam, stood, and marched into the kitchen. There was a grating sound, one Harry knew from years of living in the flat was the rubbish bin opening. Then seconds later a soft but definite thud.
Ron frowned at that. “But nineteen’s a bloody awful age to be forever. In the States, you can’t even drink yet until you’re twenty-five.”
Yes, he had always been beautiful. But now, right now, as he came walking into the café, looking sheepish but radiant at the same time, he was absolutely stunning.
Draco grinned and answered, because Harry was obviously still too mortified to do so, “Yes. Yes, you should have.”
“Well, of course you’re still recovering, silly,” said Luna, but her tone didn’t hold its usual carefree cheer. Nor did her face, Harry was alarmed to see; his friend’s expression was pinched and drawn, none of her usual buoyancy in sight. “You need to rest, Harry. Even the Wrackspurts are keeping well away from you right now, and that’s never a good sign.”
They passed Hayes, and Draco refused to so much as glance at the man, his shoulders tensing up despite himself, gaze trained doggedly ahead.
Harry swallowed before replying, both because he needed the time to come up with a suitable response and because he doubted Draco would appreciate the alternative—he may not agree with his father’s ideology, but Draco was still a well-bred, well-mannered pureblood through-and-through, and speaking whilst chewing was something even Harry had been taught was impolite.
Potter flushed but gave Draco the address, and just like that, it was time to go. Yet Draco, once again, found himself hesitating.
However, stupid as the words might have been, they made Malfoy finally look up from where he’d been staring stubbornly at the cobbled path of Diagon Alley. Since the Slytherin had made no show of wanting to Apparate back to Harry’s flat any time soon, despite what he'd said as they'd exited the shop, Harry had simply contented himself with keeping pace at his side as they walked down Diagon’s long, winding street. There were few people out that afternoon, not with the sun blazing down so intensely, which suited Harry just fine.
, but the exact details didn’t matter). Which, he felt needed to be stressed, was not his fault, not when Draco simply stood there staring right back, mouth opened just a sliver, pink lips parted in surprise as those damn eyes of his locked onto Harry’s.
And although, technically speaking, Draco was the one doing the protecting, Harry couldn’t help but feel oddly obligated to offer the blond, silver-eyed Slytherin the same courtesy.
As you may or may not have noticed, this update's a week late. Sorry. I'm afraid my workload is picking up again, so unfortunately I can't truly promise you weekly updates for the next couple of chapters. But they will come!!! This story will not be abandoned, I swear it on Narcissa Malfoy's favourite china set ;)
But Draco didn’t want the Chosen One, he didn’t want the Saviour, the celebrity everyone made the great Harry Potter out to be—he just wanted Harry. Harry, who was loud and brash and oblivious and ignorant, who was reckless and stupid, who was kind and compassionate and attentive and good.
And just like that, whatever comfortable atmosphere that might’ve existed an instant ago vanished into thin air, and Malfoy’s head snapped up so quickly he risked whiplash, grey eyes wide.
Draco had known, of course, that Potter would never manage to keep his soulmark hidden from the press, but when he opened his copy of the Daily Prophet the next morning only to read the headlines ‘HARRY POTTER’S SOULMARK CONFIRMED: IT’S A
Nic watched him, eyes like two empty, frozen sheets of ice. It was then that two separate realisations hit Harry with about as much subtlety as the Hogwarts Express at full speed:
Harry smiled. “I am. I saw your grilled cheese sandwiches, by the way, Mione. They were great, thanks a lot.”
But watching Harry get practically strangled by the ginger’s fierce bear-hug, emerald eyes practically bulging out of their sockets as he mouthed at Draco over Weasley’s bony shoulder ‘Help me’—all Draco could do when faced with that image was laugh.
Harry once again felt a flurry of uncertainty pass over him, but he swallowed the lump in his throat and said earnestly, “Look, I’m sorry. Both for meddling just then, and for forcing you to go with me to Renaults and Co. in the first place. I should’ve accepted a no. I wanted a bit of action and got carried away. I didn’t realize what it might mean to you, and for that, I’m sorry. Truly.”
For a brief moment, there was silence. No more bursts of colour shot through the air, no more cabinets were blown to pieces. For a moment, the wrecked interior of Renaults and Co. was at peace.
There was a long moment of silence, in which Draco simply stared at Harry, grey eyes unreadable. Then, finally, Draco said, “Merlin, don’t tell me you honestly don’t know?”
looking anywhere near Draco. He didn’t know what to make of Potter’s words. Had it simply been an attempt to prevent yet another fight between his best mate and childhood-rival, or had Potter been…
“You do release what’s at stake here, right? Let me remind you: this is Harry’s life you’re trifling with. His
But Harry’s mind was elsewhere, mainly on getting to the Ministry as fast as possible, to keep Draco from doing or saying something stupid. Because although that silver fire of his made Harry’s heart beat faster every time, although Harry had half a mind himself to go marching into wherever they were holding Yaxley and obliterate the man with his bare hands for what he’d done, both to Harry and to all the innocents during the war and to
This time Hermione answered. “We’re thinking of a spring wedding. Winter’s too cold, obviously, and there's still far too much planning to get through to host it this autumn. Plus, I’d love to hold the ceremony outdoors, so the weather has to be perfect. Perhaps May.”
Damn, Draco though faintly as he flung open the door, wand lifted high, Blaise had been right—Harry’s Gryffindor tendencies really were rubbing off on him.
Draco and Harry had a split second to jump apart, before the kitchen door flew open with a resounding bang and in marched one dishevelled but determined looking Ronald Weasley and one scowling, particularly terrifying Hermione Granger.
Draco held up a hand, effectively silencing the rambling Gryffindor. “It’s fine. No need to explain yourself. Constant vigilance and all that, I understand. Besides—” Draco gave Harry his best Slytherin smirk. “—I happen to like Butterbeer a lot, for your information.”
Healer Hodkinson was quiet for another long moment. Then, finally, he said, and it was fully possible his voice was squeakier than normal, “Mr. Potter. I see you have…guests. And here I’d thought you’d be spending your time with Mr. Weasley and Mrs. Granger.”
However, all that cheer was long gone, the light-hearted conversations and genuine smiles now but a memory from the past, and although Draco couldn’t stop glancing over at Harry as they walked, the Gryffindor refused to make eye contact, even if Draco was certain Harry knew he was watching. At least he hadn’t Apparated back to the flat yet—if Harry locked himself in his room and ignored Draco for the rest of the night, Draco really couldn’t be held accountable for whatever irrational actions he may pursue.
“Are you asking whether there’re any more Death Eater-assassins you need to be worried about?” Yaxley paused for a long moment and leaned back in his iron chair, evidently enjoying the tension. “No, not that I know of. But who knows what might happen in the future.”
had told him about Narcissa, and he felt just as useless as he had back then, sitting on the cold kitchen floor, listening to the Slytherin talk.
Because if something ever happened to that man, with his soft smiles and twinkling eyes and horrible case of bedhead—Draco would never ever
for him. He’d figured as much, judging by everything he’d heard so far from Pansy and Blaise, but to have actual confirmation from the woman who had raised Draco—Harry would be gloating right now if there weren’t much more pressing matters to be dealt with first.
Harry shook his head, the chocolate laying forgotten in his lap. “I’m so sorry, Draco. Honestly. That’s just…wow. I can’t even begin to imagine what your mother must be going through.” He paused. “Is there anything that can be done? To help her?”
So, with that in mind, Harry tried to sit still. To calm down just enough to quit squirming around underneath the white, thin sheets St. Mungo’s had provided, and stop. Wait. Be patient.
“Err,” he tried again, not quite able to look Draco in the eye. “I, uhm. Didn’t actually mean that. Sorry. Tell you the truth, you’re actually a lot nicer than you give yourself credit for. Loads more thoughtful, too, and empathetic, and wicked clever as well. Honestly, I’d never tell Hermione this because I know she’d murder me in my sleep and hide my body where no one would ever find it, but I think you really give her a run for her money. You see, you’re actually quite brilliant, and a mighty good listener, and—”
Irrational or not, Draco certainly hoped it would. But fate had never been kind to him for any prolonged periods of time, so he wasn’t counting on it.
Save for a twitch in the corner of his mouth, Draco didn’t react at all. He just stood there with all his annoying three-inches-taller-than-Harry-ness and stupid silver eyes. This only soured Harry’s mood further, and he shouldered past the blond with perhaps just a tad bit too much force, making him stumble a step.
“As a matter of fact, all my living relatives are terrible people, and they treated me horribly. To be honest, I think that’s one of the reasons I disliked you so; after all, here I’d been, alone and clueless, at Hogwarts for the first time, entering into this beautiful new world of possibilities, so sure I’d left all the bullying behind me, so sure this place with all its wonderful, magical people would be better,” Harry said. “Then I met you. In a way, you reminded me of them, and I hated you for it.
Harry loved Draco. Perhaps this emotion was new, perhaps he always had—it didn’t matter. All that mattered now was that Harry knew it, and so would Draco.
“Harry,” Draco said again, and the Gryffindor didn’t know what was going on right now, but still that smile alone loosened something in his chest, making it easier to breathe again. Some might say it worked like magic. “Harry, oh my
“Yes, it does feel a little dishonest. But you understand why I had to say yes to the nazi thing, don’t you? It would be a lot more dishonest to deny that label. And blood purity is racial supremacy too, just not the skin colour type.”
“Not everyone in the magical world knows everything about, say, animagi. It’s like that, basically.”
That hit like a hex. He didn’t know how he could have been satisfied with just having moved along, but he had been, it was true. Learning about muggles the way he had for the last few years had been so good, it had felt like peace and growth and how life was supposed to be. Like he had finally claimed his place among the broader humanity, the place he hadn’t realised was there for him, had been there all along. He hadn’t known he had wanted to belong to that until he did, but it felt so right now. Learning and growing had been good, and necessary, but he felt ashamed now, embarrassed that he had felt so content with it.
“Five? I was engaged at five, too, and now I barely remember the boy’s name. How can an engagement at the age of five mean anything? Sorry, I don’t actually mean to sound critical here, I am genuinely asking how that happened. Some part of this culture is still quite confusing after all these years.”
A loud, long beep in his ear interrupted his thoughts. He jumped. Oh, the ringing, there was supposed to be a ringing tone, and while he wouldn’t call this ringing, necessarily, it had to be that.
“Hum. Strawberries?” The first local strawberries always came just before his birthday. Well, perhaps they were earlier this far south, a bit, but still, they should be in season. And even if they weren’t, muggles moved food over distances, he’d read that somewhere.
He knew there were more things Mary had given him after having done too much, but he didn’t know what they were, let alone where they were. This one would have to do. So tired. So hard without Mary. Hoped she’d be able to come back to work. Hoped she’d be okay to at least be, to live, to be well. Harry seemed to have an idea for how to fix a substitute of some sort. If Mary couldn’t work... Good thing Harry had been there. He knew… pill. Over extending. Progress – yet, he’d said, he’d used the word yet, about Draco going out. Harry… knew all the things?
“Well, we learn physics in school, I guess. Microwaves are physics, I think. Or chemistry, maybe. Anyway, we learn about that in school.”
The folder also contained a few scientific articles about the disease he had, one which described “five cases of attempting to use non-muggles to care for patients of a damaged magical core”. Only one of the cases was British, though. He supposed that with such a rare disease it made sense that they had to draw examples from all over Europe. In the British one they had tried to isolate a man with a house elf. The house elf had been instructed to care for him until he died or got well, and so the house elf had obediently nursed the man to his death.
So that was another chapter speedrunning an entire year of recovery. Still, there's been some growth and learning as well. And next chapter our story begins in earnest.
“Yes, my school… it was a bit like that, yes.” The goblin wars… well, clearly something was missing from the tellings of that history, that was obvious at some distance, and probably from lots of other parts of history as well. “And then I discovered the topic of war in music… and I wanted context, but I wasn’t well enough back then to read up. Now I am.”
“I don’t know how it is,” Draco admitted, “I’ve never done this before. But I do feel very tired, maybe bed is a good idea.”
And then, once out of bed, there would be a wheelchair, which he gathered was a chair for getting around if you couldn’t walk. The chair part of that was familiar enough – Tracy in his year had used a charmed armchair that floated over the ground to get around – but wheels seemed a bit silly, because what on earth would one do about stairs? He’d heard often enough that muggles were obsessed with wheels, though, because they didn’t have magic, so probably that was it. There would also be a thing called a walker, which apparently didn’t walk, but instead had wheels on it, too.
“Hello, Draco. Normally I would run wand diagnostics first, but I don’t dare to do that now, it is simply too dangerous in the state you are in. We will need to start with questions,” the healer said. “I understand you can’t talk anymore, but blink once for yes, and twice for no. Otherwise, just conserve your strength as best you can as we go through this. Can you do that?”
“No, I want…” He wasn’t sure exactly what he wanted, except seeing all the people. He spotted a big model of an ice cream hanging on a café. Many things were different between the muggle world and the wizarding, but surely that one was universal. “Ice cream? And sitting in the sun and eating it?”
“Huh. I suppose I do think of all the pureblood marriage stuff as old-fashioned, not just bizarre. I mean, also bizarre, sorry, Draco, but they are. But in an old-fashioned way. What was this book, then?”
Draco could hear the healer and his mother talking outside his room. That was one thing to hold on to. He couldn’t make out what they were saying, but he liked hearing their voices, because a day with a healer was different, and a different day was something to hold on to. He knew he was in his room, that was another anchor. He knew he had been here for a long time, in this bed. Months. He clung to that information as well, unpleasant as it was. Knowing things. Knowing things was good. Confusion was bad. Thinking was good. Confusion was bad. He was awake, and he held on to that piece of knowledge as well. It was the most important one, because he wanted it, wanted so badly to be awake. He was lying still in his bed, and with his eyes closed, it was all he could do, but he was awake. Alive. For now, at least.
He had dreamed about the tubes. About in the beginning, being stuck in bed, tied to machines, not even understanding what they did, having only foggy ideas. Tubes into his body, delivering the incomprehensible medicines of a people he had been taught his whole life to hate and fear.
It was a Tuesday late in September. Harry was over, they had eaten dinner, and now they were just hanging out in the living room, talking about that day in May, when Mary had collapsed.
“I have heard you talk on the phone several times now,” Draco said, after. “I think I can probably do it too, if you do all the button stuff for me the first time.”
“Don’t. Worry.” Harry insisted. “Just don’t. This is fine. This will all be fine. You will have your mother back, on phone, at least. And others too, probably. Who do you miss the most?”
He was the loneliest man on the planet, and he would remain so. No one, muggle or wizard, could echo this, no one. This was forever, forever, because even though the illness would end, and the worst of it had already ended, living with it wouldn’t. There was no escape from it having happened.
He told Mary he hadn’t been allowed much music growing up, which was true enough, and that he was interested in exploring more. She said that with his budget he should feel free to explore music as much as he pleased, so he decided he would.
A third detailed the known causes, most of which he knew, as they fit with the questions he had been asked by the Healer.
“The thing is, I know this guy, Kenny. Great guy. He used to be my carer, actually. He’s a nurse now, he wasn’t back then, just worked for me on the side while he was doing nursing school. So, umm, I know he’s good at this kind of stuff, and won’t mess you up with bad advice or bad care, but yeah, he works part-time at the hospital, so he couldn’t be here all the time, but I was thinking, what if we call him, and then hears if he’s interested? He could stay here as well. I mean, he’s living on his sister’s sofa after his asshole of a man cheated on him, so you know, he’d probably be pretty delighted with the situation, to be honest. But mostly I just think he’ll be exactly what you need.”
“I have. I wanted to, before, you know, when I was so ill. There’s a lot that I missed when I was in school. I wasn’t a bad student, but I wasn’t exactly equally interested in everything.” He hadn’t taken muggle studies, he thought.
Draco felt dizzy, like he’d just landed after a side-along. Too fast, too much. He was still trying to piece together Harry’s rapid-fire phone talk, and now… decisions? About something else entirely?
“And I figure that either you boys can pick one out for her and send it by muggle mail to me and I will charm it up for her, or I can just swing by a store and get it tomorrow, which would be faster, but then you don’t have as much a say in what type and all, what would be easier for her to use, unless you already know.”
Lucius had made a soldier out of Draco. Oh, Draco had gone along with it, and been mighty proud of it, too. It hadn’t been a hard decision. It was his own fault as much as anyone, but his father had been a weight on the wrong scale.
The elevator dinged, and Mohammed from the reception strode out. He was a young man with curly hair and a sweet smile, whom Draco had seen before because he sometimes helped Mary with groceries. He was slightly wild-eyed now, and certainly not smiling. And behind him followed, of all people, Harry Potter. That registered as vaguely strange, but there was no time to wonder about it.
“Apparently I didn’t have to either. Not that I was consulted. I was asleep for the first seven months of the whole thing.”
“It’s interesting!” He defended himself, and his beloved sci-fi. “And very instructive! It is a very interesting way to learn about the muggle relationship with technology, which – ”
It had also been classified as a disease by something called the World Health Organization, which apparently got to decide things like that, but that was all over now too.
“I did not think about it. Mary…” he said, swallowed. Mary. The outside. New routines. New people. “There’s been a lot to think about, I suppose.”
He’d been out here for a while now, he thought. Better see whether lunch was ready. Getting up, he discarded the blankets, and then, letting go of the armrest of the chair, grabbed on to the door to the veranda. Once through the door, he let himself fall into the wheelchair that stood there waiting, turning it on and placing his feet on the footrest. And then, the technology familiar by now, the motor propelled him ahead through the living rooms, into the hall, and from there he used the joystick to turn left to enter the kitchen, before stopping with a shout.
Mary told him that she had not been allowed to open it, so obviously she didn’t know what was in it, but that it was for him to look at when he was well enough. She thought he was probably well enough now that he could read a little, but added that “if it’s too hard, just save it for later. If it could wait this long, it can wait a little longer.” It did not feel like it could, though, not at all.
“Oh no, I absolutely do, I love it. That was my introduction to good music, you see. Bach…” Draco waved his hands over his now empty plate. “Laying in my bed, hearing the Goldberg Variations for the first time, it was a revelation. Mary thought it would be relaxing, but it was the most stimulating experience I had had in years.” It had actually been a little too stimulating, in a sense, but Draco saw no reason to tell Kenny that. “And then Mary said I could explore music as much as I pleased because I had enough money that it wouldn’t really affect my budget much, and so I did.”
Mary had asked if he liked classical music, and he had said yes – that sounded like a safe thing to say, he supposed, something that most people would like. It turned out to be nothing like wizarding music at all. Nobody sang anything, for one thing, and there was so much feeling he was overwhelmed at first. Mary said it was probably good music for resting, she’d read that somewhere, at least. He could not understand why that would be, he never felt quite at rest with the music, he just felt intensely alive, but still, rest it was. He still spent a lot of time laying flat with his eyes closed, and if Johan Sebastian Bach could make him feel like this, well, that made his life a lot more tolerable.
“Thanks! It takes less time per CD than it take to play, so if I bring a few over when I see her next, I’ll bring them right back with me the same day. Man, I better get the lasagna in the oven, it’s happier when it’s done on low heat suuuuper slowly, though it works to just stick it in for half an hour too. So expect food in about four hours.”
“You know what I did,” Draco replied. “You know. Don’t try to excuse it just because I wouldn’t do it again. That’s not nearly enough, and you know it.”
“…gave me a lot of time to think. And if that is a clichee, then that must be because it has been true for a lot of people. But I think that both the experience of nearly dying, and that of recovering so slowly, well. It is very unpleasant, obviously. It’s not something I would wish on anyone. But it’s an opportunity too, for a certain type of growth.”
Draco obediently went for his phone. He had not used it much yet, but he had it on him when Kenny went shopping, and him and Harry were practicing sending text messages. Could it really connect him to someone in the wizarding world, though? Could it bridge that gap?
“I’m glad. That is sad, though, that she still can’t see it. So. You’re all over Draco, then? Harry said he was really distraught over losing you, still.”
They arranged that the chocolate would be delivered on Monday. He gave the address, and the bill would be delivered with the chocolate, but discreetly under the smallest basket, as that was for him. He thanked her nicely, said goodbye, and pushed the right button to hang up. He beamed at Harry.
“Hmmm. Could I borrow your books, maybe? When I’m better? I’m not up for heavy text books yet, but still. I would like to learn more about the microwave thing.”
So, Harry had assumed he was romantically involved with Pansy. That made sense, as an assumption. Draco was used to everyone around him knowing he liked men – well, everyone his age, whose business it was, and also his mother, whose business it wasn’t, as such, but who always saw through him in matters of the heart, and who had comforted him when Sebastian had turned out to be predictably heartless.
Sorry about the huge delay here (and the morose Draco). I have several chapters ready to go, but I have some structure problems in order to get to them. Not giving up, though!
And then Kenny turned on Harry, insisting he take a taxi home and then take a “crash package” and spend the next day in bed. Draco was surprised – Harry didn’t seem out of sorts at all. But Harry grudgingly acknowledged that this was probably a good idea, fuck you, Kenny, and call me if you need anything tomorrow, anything at all, hear me? And then Harry was gone and Draco was alone with the stranger.
They didn’t talk about her marriage. They didn’t even talk about her children. He appreciated that she was holding back, for now.
“Is it okay I do that on Tuesday this week? Otherwise we can do errands on Thursday whenever I don’t work, if that matters. What magazines do you want? Is there a list?”
“I guess I am, yeah. I mean, I feel pretty sure he will stick around. And it will probably be good for him, too.”
That made sense. Sense enough, anyway. He used to be smarter. Used to be smart. Long time ago now, years. Brain doesn’t do what it should. Body doesn’t either. So many Healers, but no answers. Until now. Muggle disease. Die among muggles. Except he wouldn’t, he somehow felt, he wouldn’t die. He would live. Live.
Having someone poke his arm with something sharp, almost feeling like it broke the skin, even, but being helpless to stop it.
The apartment was rather small, Draco thought – three bedrooms, two living rooms, a kitchen, a hall, and three bathrooms. All said it was about the size of his parents’ suite at the Manor, perhaps, and more suitable for one person than two unless they shared a bed, but it served him well enough, and for all he knew, all muggles had to live like this. It was good for him, he thought, to live like a muggle. He understood them much better now.
“And your logic was ‘I want chocolate plus I want to gift chocolate equals buy such much chocolate’. Oh god, this is amazing and also a little terrifying.”
This summer he could probably venture outside, Mary had said. He would be using a wheelchair, and if that went well, eventually he could walk out to the little sidewalk café and sit there having a cup of tea. 137 steps each way, Mary had counted, but of course the real challenge was all the sights and sounds. Anyway, if it turned out to be too much, she could always retrieve his wheelchair to help him back. But on a good day he could already walk that amount inside. It wasn’t a lot, granted, but it was a lot more than nothing. He was getting there.
He didn’t have a muggle disease after all. What he had was a very rare disease of the magical core, which made it react to magic as it happened around him, or as he tried to do magic himself. Apparently this had made him worse and worse over time, ravaged his body almost to the point of death. It could no longer handle even non-magical activities or stimuli, and it would take a long time to recover.
And then towards the end of that month, Ron and I took his car down here and stayed in a hotel for a few days while looking at places. I mean, that felt hurried enough, to be honest. I ended up renting a furnished place, the only wheelchair accessible thing we found, actually, first for a year, but as it turns out, I’m still in that apartment. Anyway, we had plenty of time compared to you, apparently.”
He sat waiting, but he didn’t hear the voice again. Had he succeeded? Was help on the way? No way of knowing. He couldn’t remember Mary ever having to shout into the telephone, but what did he know? He unlocked the door with his free hand, keeping the telephone close to his ear in case the voice came back. Then he opened the door and peeked out.
His bed turned out to be a muggle machine. It could lift his upper body up to a semi-sitting, semi-reclining position, which was useful. It had what Mary called a remote control, which did exactly what it sounded like: It remotely controlled the bed. A little machine that controlled other machines – it was so muggle-like it sounded almost like parody, but here he was, finding it far too helpful to really be amused. The remote control had buttons for the bed, buttons for controlling the light in the room, and a big, red one for calling Mary.
He found the names of records that sounded interesting in Rolling Stone Magazine, and Mary bought what she could find in the record store on her errand day on Thursdays. She made a neat stack called Draco’s favorites, and put the rest in heard and unheard stacks. That lasted about a month. When the stacks had multiplied and were could in no way be kept neat anymore, she alphabetised the lot, leaving room for a lot more.
The rest of the day he was a little bored. Reading made his brain hurt, so he rested and listened to music, mostly. Lots of Bach, and then some Joni Mithcell. Kenny mostly puttered around in the kitchen, getting himself familiar with where things were placed, and then making some big batches of food for the fridge and freezer that “didn’t taste like shit when it’s reheated, you know”. Lunch was freshly baked rolls and an omelette with red peppers and leek, which was lovely.
Only the next morning did it occur to him that he had interrupted Kenny’s sleep too that night, and after the man had been working very hard for two double-shift days, too. Kenny actually had pronounced blue rings under his eyes that morning, and after Draco was clean and had his breakfast, he suggested Kenny go back to bed.
She was clearly curious, but didn’t quite want to ask. Well, that was nice, he supposed, Harry had told him to be prepared for a barrage of intrusive questions, it happened a lot when out and about in a wheelchair, but this lady had at least kept a rein on her curiosity. He appreciated that.
“I don’t believe in bad genres. Besides, country especially is so varied. You can do so much with it.”
What had he even been doing in 1994? Been in third year? Played quidditch? Been mauled by a wild animal that the crazy Magical Creatures teacher had been allowed to have them play with? His father was trying to bring back Voldemort, of course, but he hadn’t brought Draco into that. Draco hadn’t been a nice child, but in that, at least, he had been innocent. “But you see, it’s not me, it’s not my family – ” - but it had been his family. His mother must have known too, or suspected, at the very least, pushed away suspicion. If his parents had made different choices, the entire war might have twisted and turned differently.
He wanted to talk with his mother about all this when he came back. The chocolate taste in his mouth turned bitter at the thought. Thankfully he had years to prepare for that conversation.
The proposed cure for this illness was a total and complete avoidance of magic, and allowing plenty of time for recovery. The patient should not only avoid using magic himself, or using any sort of magical items, there would be no proximity to magic in any form – no magical items, people or creatures who used magic, or even items that had been around magic for any considerable stretches of time.
“He said it himself, kind of. It’s like he’s trying to decide how I am supposed to react to something that happened to me. Like, just as if because he’s on my side he gets to do that. Just because he cares more about politics and all he gets to just know what it is I should say or how I should hold my grudges and that it’s wrong to forgive you or whatever. To be fair, I think that’s why he left, though. Because he realised he was doing that. So that’s something, at least.”
So he missed Pansy. He wanted to know what she thought about everything: The illness itself, of course, the muggle technology, the funeral of the Queen Mother, Mary The Muggle Nurse (would she be in Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff, hypotethically?), what strategies he could use for making sure he did not reveal his ignorance about muggle matters… he needed Pansy, but all he had was himself.
Conditional love, what an ugly thing to bring a child. And he had still been a child, he could see that now, although at the time he had thought about himself as a freshly minted adult. No, anyone who had tried to tell him at seventeen that he was a child would have received his deepest disdain, but he had been, and his father should have seen that.
Odd to have this stranger call him by his first name. Odd. Something not. Supposed to. Be like. That.
He opened his eyes to darkness. Closed them again. He still felt tired, worn out beyond anything he could have imagined before all this had started to happen, but instead of feeling like he was falling down, sinking into the sludge of his mind, he felt strangely bouyant, like he was rising up. The pain was less all-compassing, somehow. It was still hard to think, but it felt possible. Merlin. Possible. It had been a long time since anything felt possible.
Harry had been right, Kenny had decided to stay. In fact, he did not appear to have even considered leaving for good. He had come back later the night of their argument carrying three big pizza boxes as a peace offering, and said he was interested in talking more about it all later, but that he absolutely didn’t want to put any pressure on Draco about these things. And then he had apologised to Harry, and the two of them had promised to talk. In the time that followed that day Kenny and Draco had talked too, here and there, but it was more like the slow conversations about power Draco and Mary had been having, stretched out over weeks.
“That certainly sounds like a much nicer way to go about it. But did you bring your muggle things from before?” He knew he did not have the option of bringing any comfort items, but perhaps Harry had some things that had not been as contaminated with magic.
“I’ll stay,” Harry had said after the ambulance people had left. He said it firmly, aggressively, almost. “Unless you actually kick me out, I’m staying until I am positive that you’re okay. Mo needs to go back down to the reception, but I have time. Nowhere I need to be. I’ll stay.”
“That’s alright, then. I’m glad you are getting out. Does that mean you’re getting better, from your…?”
“SO WERE YOU!” Draco found himself shouting, and now he was sobbing too, fuck. “You were too! Just a! Child! And they did not care about that, they didn’t give a shit! But you were just a little child, and they took that from you! After they had already taken your parents!”
“Oh no, it’s the other way around days. It’s like everyone is supposed to like everything. Actually you’ll find that most people say they like everything except country and opera – ”
“That is lovely, I would love to experience some of what have entertained you while you have been recovering. What is it like where you live? I requested the nurse find an apartment with a sea view when I heard you would be near the sea, if at all possible – did she find one?”
“Oh no, oh FUCK, oh NO,” they heard Mohammed shout from in there. Harry ran after him, and Draco dropped the part of the phone he had been holding onto and followed on his wheels, as fast as he dared to go without risking heelclipping the other man with the foot rest of his wheelchair.
“Well, I don’t know what he has told you, but either way those stories are the stories about a child. A really terrible child, but still. Even if I had grown up to be an equally terrible man, which I hope I am not, I would have been quite different from that child, I think. But this illness…”
“I have, of course I have, but the difference is, I understand the basics of potions! We learn it in school, for Merlin’s sake. And when I was a child, the decisions about potions would be made by my parents, who, similarly, understood potions! So that’s not a very helpful analogy either.”
“Oh. Well, good, do you know what you would like to try, or should I just buy a lot of halves and we’ll see what you like? Like, a selection, I suppose?”
“No, I just read a lot, and it was an aha that sort of happened based on lots of knowledge from other people.”
It was dawning on him that there had been an entire muggle history, and there had been several wars. Trying to piece together what belonged to which war was pretty much impossible without context, though. Draco wanted history books, to learn about those other wars, that whole other parallel history, but he couldn’t read them yet. He had a few simple books along with his magasines now, novels written for teenagers, and they taught him about muggle culture too, but even those were too much sometimes, as was trying to piece together the strange things he learned about to some sort of narrative. He would have to wait.
Well, perhaps, but Draco was the one whose fault it actually was, so he failed to see how that helped. Seeing Greg without Vincent had also been so strange. Greg had come to visit at the Manor when Draco got sick, for as long as Draco was well enough to receive him. Every time he came, Draco was struck by the lack of Vince by his side. Greg was his own person, of course, he always had been, but he had also been part of a pair, more than Draco and Pansy, even. Malindra Goyle and Viola Crabbe were cousins and best friends, and their sons had been raised spending more time together than apart, and kept that up for as long as Vincent had lived. And now it was just Gregory. Now he had to deal with the world as just one person, not as part of a pair. If Draco missed Vincent, well, that could be nothing to what Greg felt.
For a while he needed to get food through a tube, through his nose and down his throat, and that was absolutely disgusting. He never could get used to it. Apparently it was necessary, though, so he could learn to eat real food later, because his stomach would have forgotten, Mary said, while he got it all through an arm, and besides, he needed more calories, whatever that was. The tube was permanently stuck there, too, and got connected to another tube when he needed to “eat”.
He couldn’t decide whether to be relieved or worried. On the one hand, this could mean Robards was finally heeding Draco’s requests for a more active role in the case, one that didn’t have him fretting all day about when, where and how Yaxley might strike next, left completely in the dark.
for Merlin’s sake. Yet all Harry had been able to dig up was an unusual feeling of…placidity, if you will. Sure, he wasn’t entirely thrilled with the notion of the former Slytherin babysitting him, much less living at his flat. But it bothered him much less than he’d expected it to. Which made no sense whatsoever, seeing as he really ought to be the opposite of calm when faced with the idea of
The Death Eater did not waste a second to take in his surroundings before shooting a curse in Draco’s direction, and the latter dodged it by throwing himself behind an ancient-looking cabinet covered in all kinds of books and vials and jars. Said books and vials and jars shattered and disintegrated under the impact of Yaxley’s spell, and the sound of breaking glass mixed with Philomena’s shrieks across the room which rapidly turned from angry to fearful to hysterical.
And, although he’d love to argue, Harry’s drooping eyes and sleep-craving body begged to differ, and so he found himself nodding. “Fine. But I expect owled updates. Hourly.”
,” he said again, this time nothing more than a tortured groan. He didn’t dare glance over to where Harry stood, silently watching the scene unfold—probably grinning like a moron.
Draco threw himself to the side just in time, and the Killing Curse hit the wall behind him, ripping the mint-green wallpaper apart where it collided. He swore and rolled behind the desk just as another curse hit the spot where he’d stood mere seconds before.
At that, Blaise’s confusion melted a bit, and he glanced at the closed door of Potter’s hospital room. “I don’t know much at all, I’m afraid. Only that it seems Potter was poisoned somehow. Acturin, they think it is—a nasty concoction, really. Potter’s lucky you, err, found him so quickly.”
“I guess, yeah. We know where people are sorted, I s’pose. Sometimes it still doesn’t make sense, though. Like Peter Pettigrew, you know the shitstain of a man who betrayed my parents, being in Gryffindor. I keep wondering how that could have happened.”
“Hey, so, if you’re okay with it, we’ll just start off by Hermione owling your mother to let her that you’re safe, alive, and partly recovered, and that we have found a way to establish regular contact. Oh, and that we will probably be able to establish contact sometime within the next week. And then Hermione will call me later and we can get into the details. How does that sound for you?”
“Oh my god. Oh fuck,” Kenny was saying, and a faraway part of him told Draco that he was about to lose Kenny’s friendship, was in fact losing it this very minute. Fair enough, he thought, fair enough. He had never deserved Kenny in the first place, had only ever had him in his life because Harry had vouched for Draco, implicitly if nothing else. While it was hard to disgust a man like Kenny, it was certainly possible. You just needed a past like Draco’s. He was disgusted with himself too, but his own disgust didn’t signify anything, of course – it had certainly been thrown around enough, and wasn’t that exactly the problem.
“Oh my god, you were a fucking nazi!” Shock and disgust mingled on Kenny’s face as the stories he had heard caught up with him and arranged themselves in his head to make a fuller picture. His face contracted in disgust, but still, perhaps, with a bit of space for the possibility that this was all a terrible misunderstanding somehow.
“My mother would probably sit down and plot to make it happen, though, if she was sure I really wanted it.” Fresh waves of laughter from both of them at that. Harry didn’t know Narcissa well, but he probably knew the truth of that. Calming down, drying slight tears of hilarity from the corners of his eyes, Draco said to Kenny,
All in all, Kenny was surprisingly easy to deal with. He offered to drop his swearing, but was happy when Draco told him he would not have to. He knew the medical stuff, and while he had less time for Draco than Mary had, he also had a lot of ideas how how to make Draco’s life easier, to make him more independent. Mostly, though, Kenny was just easy to be around. Having a new person to care for him should have been a lot more scary than this, Draco thought, especially someone so very different from Mary. But Kenny was such comfortable company that Draco found himself quite relaxed about the whole thing, even when everything was different. And when Kenny remembered just how to support Draco’s head when he brushed his teeth, that night, Draco felt trust settling on him, as if things were just okay.
Blink. Blink. What on earth. Who would ever, even. He thought he could hear his mother choke back a sob. Oh, mother. The indignities. You suffer for me. I love you.
“Nothing is the matter with me,” he defended himself. “I simply used logic in the face of incomplete information.”
“Oh, I can.” Harry had no business sounding this amused, but Draco couldn’t find it in himself to care right now.
They left, the door closing behind them, the sounds of his mother and the healer removing things echoing painfully in his head. Sleep took him fast, but he could hear them in the distance, removing several more things from his room. Voices drifted in and out of his sleep, his mother and the healer, words that didn’t make sense.
“Camping,” Harry said. “It’s odd, I miss camping so much sometimes. Spent a lot of my seventh year camping, you know, on the run from snatchers, and it was so fucking hard, but sometimes I still miss it. Strange, isn’t it? But this time I want to do it with just muggle things, and alone, at least the first time. Just me and the forest, like, for at least a good week.”
Nic glanced once at Harry, then back at Draco, and the emotions that passed across his face at that moment were so many so fast that Harry had not the slightest chance at interpreting even one. But then he sighed, and looked back at Harry with a tight but sincere-enough seeming smile.
, Potter. Absolutely not.” Whereas he’d usually smooth any loose strands back into place instantly, he didn’t even seem to notice them this time, too busy shaking his head some more. “No, no and
If he hadn’t recently found out Draco was his literal soulmate, Harry’d probably be pissed right now.
He meant it as a joke. An ill-timed, hospital-themed, horridly horrible joke that not even Draco’s inborn dry humour could excuse—but a joke nonetheless.
“Don’t you ‘Mother’ me, Draco,” she said, eyes narrowing. “I sat through years and years of listening to your complaints. Every single holiday it was ‘Harry Potter this’ and ‘Harry Potter that’ and ‘oh why won’t he ever notice me’. And now that, years later, you finally got over yourself and confessed, you have the audacity to say you
if he squinted hard enough. The skin there was still perfectly bare, just as it had been his entire life. Tomorrow, though, that would change.
Draco cleared his throat and redonned his familiar cold sneer, all the while mentally chiding himself for his own bloody carelessness. Honestly, at the rate he was going,
But then, much to Harry’s utter bewilderment, that sneer fell away. Just like that. It was there, and then a blink of an eye later, it wasn’t, and Draco had plastered what could only be described as the blandest of bland smiles over his face. And although it didn’t meet his cool grey eyes, Harry was so taken aback by the sudden change in demeanour he didn’t even try to hide his gaping.
For a moment, Draco was sure his friend saw right through his lie. But then Blaise closed his mouth and gave a stiff nod. “Good.”
There was a round of silence, and suddenly Harry very much missed the carefree atmosphere from before, even if that did entail Pansy and Blaise making fun of him; he’d take that over this grim feeling of
Harry had always figured he’d have kids one day, had never even considered any other option. It just seemed like something he would do, something he would enjoy, an opportunity to give a child of his own the loving upbringing he’d never had but had always yearned for.
Draco snorted and rolled his eyes, and although he was evidently trying hard to look annoyed, the corner of his mouth twitching upwards effectively betrayed him. “
Draco allowed himself a small smile. “You heard me correctly, Potter—thank you. I might just take you up on that offer someday soon.”
Draco’s lips twitched downwards into a frown, that cautious, soft smile gone. “She’s…doing better, I suppose. Still not quite good, but better, nonetheless.”
She paused, looking at Draco expectantly, any trace of that earlier blush long gone, replaced instead by that fiercely glimmering purpose Draco had learned to expect when faced with Hermione Granger. It dawned on him then that she was waiting for him to answer, and so, although he dreaded whatever ‘it’ was, he gave a dazed nod.
, and the action didn’t even hurt anymore; there was no room for pain inside Harry, not when he was filled to the brim with such incredible, undimmable
But Harry simply continued calmly, “No more truces.” He took three great big steps forwards, until he stood directly in front of Draco, whose grey eyes went wide. “I know you’re a Slytherin, but the real world doesn’t have truces. In the real world, people have friends.” And, with that, Harry raised his right hand and stretched it towards Draco. “So. How about it, Malfoy? Friends?”
Draco wouldn’t lie; he’d imagined snogging Harry Potter plenty of times over the years. The very first time he could remember giving it active thought would have to be on the night of the Yuletide Ball back in Fourth Year. He had no doubt he’d been pining after the dark-haired Gryffindor for years before that, perhaps even since that very first fateful meeting at Madame Malkin’s. But it was on that historic evening in December of 1994, as all of Hogwarts twinkled like a snowy winter wonderland and students danced their way across the Great Hall until their feet were sore, that Draco realised just how far gone he truly was.
, Weasley.” Draco spat the word at him with all the venom in the world. And yet he felt not even the slightest flicker of triumph when the youngest Weasley son flinched as though physically struck. No triumph, no smug victory, nothing at all.
. We. Home. He definitely hadn’t used those words before. Potter likely hadn’t meant it like that, no, it had undoubtedly been a mere slip-up, a blip of the mind. And yet that didn’t stop Draco’s chest from becoming inexplicably tight and warm all of a sudden.
It was beautiful, and Harry was touched by the thought that had so obviously flowed into Nic’s choice of eatery. Harry doubted he’d have ever discovered the place alone, doubted any of his friends would frequent such an evidently posh restaurant, save for Draco of cour—
The problem wasn’t that he was thinking about the blond git, per se. No, that was rather inevitable, what with how much Harry currently wanted to murder the arsehole with his bare hands.
But Blaise didn’t so much as acknowledge his sarcastic greeting. He simply stood there in the half-open doorway, eyes wide and rimmed with dark, dark circles, fixing Draco with a mixture between horror and pity.
So this chapter is, once again, solely in Harry’s POV. I switch in between his and Draco’s depending on whose perspective is more fitting / central to the plot in each chapter. However, I promise there’ll be much more Draco Chapter 13.
Anyway, seeing as Christmas'll be over by the time I update next, I'd just like to wish all of you wonderful people a merry Christmas and a happy New Year!! 2021 has got to be better than 2020, right?
. He was wearing a pair of dark trousers, nothing like the worn jeans he usually always sported, but instead far more form-fitting and sophisticated. And although the outfit alone made him look so much more polished, it wasn’t it that captured Draco’s attention.
Potter grimaced a bit at the title, which Draco had used on purpose, knowing how much he disliked it. Potter straightened up, but suddenly he looked a lot more embarrassed than Draco was comfortable with. An embarrassed Potter was never good, because then that in turn made Draco blush, and
He waited patiently for Draco to nod, and when he did, the look on the Slytherin’s face, so full of that same fear, that same brokenness, it settled something for Harry.
Granger blinked and glanced up at him, her dark brown eyes assessing as they studied his. Draco had no idea what she saw there, whether what she found was an answer to her unspoken question, whether said answer was good or bad or something in between.
“Sure you didn’t. Point is, there’s a reason people keep their soulmarks private. Don’t you remember what I told you? If you’ve accepted your soulmate-bond, then your magical core and that of your soulmate are one. No one in their right mind is going to go around parading the identity of their soulmate like a fool. They’d be shouting out their vulnerabilities to the world.”
Harry wasn’t sure why he hadn’t noticed it before, but it was enough to make him worry. The man looked positively nauseous, for Christ’s sake.
Only to find two familiar wide, dark blue eyes staring back at him, set into an equally familiar face framed by equally familiar brown curls.
Harry seemed similarly awed, although his shock was understandably greater. “That’s…,” he tried and shook his head, making a strand of black fall into his eyes. “That’s actually rather brilliant, Parkinson.”
Draco snorted. “And wherever would be the fun in that? Not to mention, I feel like this so-called law of yours should at least extend both ways, it’s hardly fair if—”
One look at the grin still stretching across Blaise’s face and the twinkle in his eyes, and Draco only snorted, whacking Blaise on the arm. “Prick. We’ll see how well
But before Harry could say anything or even raise a hand in greeting, the fifth and last of his newest guests emerged from the Floo.
Draco blinked. Opened his mouth. Blinked again. “Harry Potter. Here. As in, right there. All night.”
“Yes,” Harry found himself saying, and he meant it. “Yes, I do think that. And you should, too. You changed sides, Malfoy—stop acting as though you deserve to be in Azkaban with those who didn’t.”
Nic gave him a small grateful smile in return, although the painful tinge to it was unmistakable. “Nothing
Somewhere in the room Draco knew Weasley was hanging around as well, and Robards and another nameless Auror there to watch the proceedings. But all Draco could see was Harry, and Harry’s distress, and it made him seethe with disgust and anger and hatred for Yaxley, who had done this.
Harry burst into laughter, and the sound was as beautiful as it was infective, and soon Draco found himself chuckling as well, unable to look away from the bright twinkle in the Gryffindor’s eyes.
Then, surprisingly, Weasley turned to Draco and said, voice oddly gentle, “It isn’t your fault. And when Harry wakes up, he’ll be glad you’re here.”
When Death Eaters had first started trickling into Malfoy Manor in the summer of 1997, Narcissa had pulled Draco aside one day and, amongst other things, warned him there would be dangerous people coming into their lives, people Draco needed to avoid, for his own good. Dangerous, because they were willing and capable of doing whatever it took to enforce their beliefs upon the world. Even now, Draco could still remember the sickly pallor of his mother’s skin, the first flash of fear he’d ever glimpsed in her usually so proud and dauntless eyes—could still hear her words echoing in the empty hallway; beware of fanatics, Draco, for they will not be swayed from their path. But, above all, beware of the fanatic that hides their fanaticism under a mask of sanity, for you’ll never see them coming until it’s too late.
“No. I mean it. I was in the wrong this time.” Harry cracked a weak smile, but it instantly lightened the mood considerably. “Besides, I need to restore you to your normal arsehole-ness. The Malfoy I know would have already thrown a party and alerted the media at the prospects of me admitting I was actually
, after all, Draco didn’t know the man, nor did he find himself particularly keen on getting to know him ever—hadn’t even glanced Draco’s way once since coming over to their table, interrupting a perfectly good conversation.
Healer Hodkinson still hovered awkwardly above Harry, wringing his hands as he watched the Gryffindor, looking like he couldn’t decide whether or not to speak. Harry found he was enjoying the latter just fine.
Before Harry could so much as open his mouth, Draco was up out of his armchair and smiling broadly as he said, “Why yes, I’m sure Harry and I will love them. Again, so very thoughtful of you.” And with that he plucked the basket from Nic’s lap, who looked a mixture between insulted and stunned. Nic opened his mouth as though he might argue, but then closed it again and simply watched Draco through somewhat narrowed eyes.
“Great! Then that’s settled.” Ron turned to Harry. “You don’t mind us going, right, mate? We can come back in half an hour or so, yeah?”
And, okay, Harry probably shouldn’t take so much pleasure in watching Draco splutter, in watching the Slytherin’s usually so composed, pale face go beetroot red, poise and serenity forgotten. But he did. Sue him.
The tip of a wand dug into Draco’s throat, and he scrambled for his own. But his attacker simply laughed and kicked Draco’s wand across the street, a cold, merciless laugh that sent shivers running down Draco’s spine. He froze, going completely still. Because—fuck, he
He wasn’t ready for this, despite what Hermione might think. He wasn't ready to become someone's 'one and only'. He wasn't ready for a god-damn
Instantly, fact after fact after fact went racing through Draco’s head, none of which did anything to calm his sprinting heart; Moonroot, a perennial flowering plant native to North America, known also as Banshee’s Glove or simply the Death Flower, with snow-white petals and vivid red berries, the former of which are used in many dark potions. Highly poisonous to animals and humans alike, and ultimately also quite fatal.
“Yeah. It was my fault, really. Pansy’s the first person I’ve met that genuinely doesn’t care about her soulmark or thinks it’s this super secret, taboo sort of matter not to be discussed
Draco looked incredulously between the two. He opened his mouth. But then he shook his head, deciding it was better to give up than make any more of a fool of himself than he already had. “You know what, I’m not even going to ask. Have fun with your bizarre muggle topics. Oh, and Weasley—” The redhead was in the process of shoving about half a piece of cake in his mouth at once, and when he looked up, startled, some crumbs fell out. Draco grimaced. “—do try not to eat the entire cake. That much sugar is bound to make even you sick, and that is one thing I
Harry nodded, and out of the corner of his eye he saw Malfoy’s scowl deepen, though he couldn’t for the love of Merlin say why. Harry was
Draco didn’t know much, but he did know one thing: Ronald Weasley was the biggest, most insufferable arsehole in the world.
“Christ, this is too much,” Draco dimly noted Weasley grumble. “We’re literally right here. Do they realise we’re right here? I think they do.”
A chaotic twenty-something minutes after their arrival at Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, Harry stepped outside and took a deep, deep breath, letting his eyes fall shut for an instant as he stood on the cobbled sidewalk outside the shop and enjoyed the calming, soothing feeling of the sun rays on his face.
Slytherins—even when you knew they were playing mind games, you simply couldn’t help but play right into their cards.
Immediately, Ron perked up, sniffing in the air like a bloodhound. When it came to food, Harry reasoned, comparing Ron to a bloodhound really was quite fitting. “Mione’s right,” the redhead said. His eyes went wider when he spied the half-eaten piece of cake still sitting on the coffee table at Harry’s right. “Oi, is that chocolate cake?”
“Harry. Mate,” Ron said, and the sheer amount of weariness in his tone instantly cleared away any lingering fatigue Harry might have felt, replaced instead by shock. “We only just heard about last night. When I got to the office, everyone was talking about how Yaxley attacked you in Diagon, and it was a right mess, and there was some sort of poisoned dagger involved, and you were here… So I got Mione and we immediately Apparated here, and then the Welcome Witch told us it was Malfoy that got injured, and…” Three pairs of eyes shifted to the bed across the room, and Harry felt his own chest become oddly tight.
The others nodded, even Ron. He looked the most confused out of everyone, but still his tone was sincere, if dazed, as he said, “Bloody hell, never thought I’d be saying this, but you really seem like you’ve changed a lot, Malfoy. And in a good way, too. Good on you. I think I’m starting to see why Harry hasn’t hexed you to Scotland and back yet.”
Thank you so much for reading the first few chapters of "no need to panic"...there's a lot more to come! Feel free to comment or leave kudos if you've liked the story so far.
Minutes or hours later, they were both near-wheezing from both breathlessness and restrained laughter. Harry shouted, “Tarantallegra!” and Draco, who’d just hit Harry with an especially devious Tickling Hex and was currently busy laughing himself silly because of it, was hit squarely in the chest.
“There, I showed you my soulmark. I told you my story. I dare say, my boy, it’s your turn now.” He grinned, exposing a row of chipped, yellowing teeth, all of them unnaturally sharp under the harsh lighting of the room. “And what an interesting story I’m certain yours’ll be. I’m curious, did you realise before or after you betrayed the Dark Lord that you wanted to fuck the one person you were supposed to hate?”
They ordered another round, and soon there were a dozen different conversations going on at once, as though the three years since Hogwarts had never happened, as though they were back at school, relaxing after an especially tiresome day of classes. Everyone put in their two cents, even Ginny, who’d stayed unusually quiet that evening, and soon Harry had forgotten all about the soulmark that was sure to appear on his wrist sometime that day. And once he’d forgotten about the thing that had kept him on the edge of his seat all day, glancing at his wrist every other minute, he was genuinely enjoying himself.
And before Harry could so much as blink, a familiar tugging sensation rose up in his chest, and then they were gone.
Harry grimaced slightly, and it made his nose scrunch up adorably. “No, no, really, it doesn’t matter, I was just thinking—”
Those stupidly green eyes of his danced with such pure joy it made Draco’s heart skip a beat, and all he could do was stare and think ‘That’s my soulmate, and he loves me’.
The man inclined his head, and then, without another word or glance in Draco’s direction, turned on his heel and walked away.
Hello and welcome back to another chapter of Harry The Oblivious Moron vs. Draco The Love-Sick Puppy! I hope you're all doing well and not too stressed and are looking forward to the holidays as much as I am.
. But, much to Harry’s surprise (and relief, because he really hadn’t been in the mood to Obliviate fifty-something muggles tonight, thank you very much), Draco simply hissed at him through barred teeth, “Fine. I’ll tell you on the way out.”
he shouldn’t have told Draco about that. Leave it to a Slytherin to blackmail you with something you confessed in a Butterbeer-induced sugar haze on the night you both almost got murdered by a wrathful, deranged Death Eater.
And just like that, Draco’s worries had been appeased, at least for the time being. The people that mattered hadn’t minded the name now tattooed across his wrist, hidden 24/7 underneath either long sleeves or a leather band.
However, Draco could fully admit he himself was for the most part responsible for Harry’s abrupt departure. What he’d said to the man, to his soulmate…it hadn’t been particularly kind, to put it mildly. Plus, considering the Gryffindor’s infamous temper, Draco was actually fairly certain he’d gotten off easy.
Draco blinked, but before he could so much as open his mouth, Nic was nodding, wearing a grin so gigantic and bright it made Draco glad he’d forgone lunch. “Sure thing. Say around six?”
? For Christ’s sake, he and Draco had only just gotten together, how was Harry already imagining them married and with
alive, right?” came Yaxley’s cold voice again, wrenching Draco back to reality. The man sounded amused, if such an emotion was even possible with such a shrivelled, pitch-black heart.
As a matter of fact, Harry noted with a bang of alarm, Nic didn’t look at all happy to see him; gone were the laugh lines and smiles Harry had come to expect on the American’s face, gone and replaced by a harsh, hard sort of stoniness that had Harry’s smile slowly but surely fading.
Harry would have been perfectly content with simply staying on the couch and cuddling all day, thank you very much.
And then everyone was shuffling out of the room—some more willingly than others—and, just like that, Harry and Draco were alone.
A charged, hair-raising silence descended upon them, and the tension in the air seemed to double every further second Harry stared into Draco’s eyes and Draco stared into Harry’s, locked in a staring competition neither dared break.
He leaned forwards and pressed the softest of kisses onto Harry’s lips, light and chaste, the exact opposite of all the confessional, claiming ones of the evening before. The latter started in surprise, green eyes wide as they lifted to Draco’s, but once again he didn’t pull away, not even a fraction of an inch.
for Merlin’s sake! As were Dean and Seamus, and Luna and Neville. Hell, in the time it’d taken Harry to realise he was bi, Pansy had already found
“Look, mate, I have no idea what you’re talking about,” he said truthfully, eliciting a few poorly suppressed gasps from the rest of the room. He ignored them all. “But, whatever happened, I know it wasn’t your fault. Okay? So please don’t apologize. You’ve done nothing wrong.”
Then she nodded again, pursing her lips. “Fine. You know what? You two can have each other,” she hissed, voice laced with venom. “Apparently, you fit together so well, isn’t that right? Just don’t blame me when shit hits the fan.”
Harry often wondered whether the war had broken him, on some level. Because, after everything, he simply hadn’t had the energy to be with anyone, not even Ginny. And if he couldn’t find it in him to want to be with
His own twentieth birthday a month before had been far more pleasant than Draco had expected it to be. Pansy, Blaise, Theo and Greg had taken him out for lunch to some brand-new restaurant in Diagon Alley, and the food there had been surprisingly good. What’s more, no one had bothered the group of former Slytherins; there had been no muttered insults, no evil glares, no scathing remarks spoken just loud enough for them to hear. They’d been left entirely alone.
Harry sat there, wordlessly watching him, for a long moment, before standing again, picking up the basket of beignets, and taking them into the kitchen. The beignets were perfectly golden, and they smelled divine. Tasted divine, too Harry found once he’d fished one out to try.
where there had been nothing but bare skin the day before. And, though unlikely, there were many ways he might accidentally find out Draco sported his name. And, knowing Potter, his reaction to that was bound to be explosive.
But it didn’t matter how much Draco chided himself for missing such an obvious explanation, for none of it would change the fact that Corban Yaxley was currently pinning him to the ground, murder in his eyes, and all Draco could possibly do where he lay wandless and powerless and entirely useless, was curse his own stupidity and hope his looming demise would be signed with a quick Avada Kedavra to the heart. Salazar knew Death Eaters like Yaxley were certainly capable of far less merciful deaths. Draco had witnessed that himself.
“I have no issue with it being muggle, Potter,” Draco replied, forgetting for a moment his rigid posture and pureblood manners and instead fixing Harry with a little scowl. “I have
Draco’s lips quirked into the beginning of what might’ve been a grin. His posture had already lost most if not all of its previous rigidity, his shoulders no longer tight and his back no longer straight as an arrow, and the cold seeping out of his expression, replaced by that warm little smirk Harry had gotten so used to, was almost a palpable thing. Whether it was due to this or simply Harry’s inborn curiosity, he couldn’t say for sure, but before he could think twice about it, he blurted out, “Why didn’t you give him a second chance?”
Harry would have dropped his wand in surprise if it weren’t, of course, currently on the other side of the alleyway.
And he certainly didn’t need to know how much it had warmed Draco’s heart when he had insisted on coming, on meeting Draco’s closest friends, Draco’s family in every way but blood, had touched him deeper even than his fear that something might happen while they were out, that maybe this time they wouldn’t be so lucky, that Yaxley would be faster than Draco and Harry would pay the price.
And without another word, Draco shouldered past Harry, not looking him in the eye as he passed, not looking at him at all, and marched into the kitchen to get himself a bloody cup of tea.
stands for my name, seeing as he certainly doesn’t have any feelings for me? Yes, yes and yes.” He groaned. “Why can’t I just be in love with you like a sane bloke.”
“Err,” Potter began, rubbing the back of his neck, emerald eyes full of uncertainty. “So. About this newest…arrangement.”
. I shudder to think how he’ll have influenced you once a full week has passed. Perhaps you’ll be sporting red all the time, hollering Quidditch hymns at the top of your lungs while hanging off the side of the Hogwarts Astronomy Tower.” Blaise sighed dramatically. “If this is how life with a soulmate looks, then count me the hell out.”
“My stomach,” he bit out. “Hence why I’m currently hunched over on this bed like Pansy during her period.”
“And I first.” Harry just grinned wider at the death glare Draco shot him and shrugged. “Just putting it out there.”
Pressing matters, like the fact that it seemed his soulmate had written his estranged, jailed, Death Eater father a letter and then conveniently forgotten to tell Harry about it.
“Draco, darling!” said the Slytherin, tone sickly sweet as she swept through Harry’s living room, sparing not a single glance at her surroundings, her focus instead entirely on the two of them. There was a twinkle there, a glint of something Harry couldn’t quite pinpoint—and, honestly, judging by the mischievous smirk dancing across the Slytherin’s ruby-red lips, likely didn’t want to either. “I see you’ve been stress-baking again. You really should acquire a new hobby—this one’ll make you fat. And what ever would you do without your only redeeming quality?”
However, sitting there in his messy living room on the faded yellow sofa he’d bought from Ikea when he first moved into the apartment, clad in sweatpants, Mrs. Weasley’s maroon Christmas jumper and one sock, hand clasped around that of his boyfriend who—even in a simple pair of trousers and a grey jumper—looked like he’d just fallen out of a magazine, seated across from said boyfriend’s mother, who put muggle supermodels to shame…
“Nuh-uh-uh,” the brunet said, tutting. “None of that. Behave yourself.” He leaned forwards, eyes raking over Harry’s arm. A frown overtook his pallid face, and while, at first, Harry was confused, it dawned on him just as Nic said, “Still just a D? I must admit, I’m disappointed, Harry. I thought you two would have worked things out by now.”
“I’m curious,” the brunette said, tone as icy as her glower. “Is there a reason, pray tell, why no one at the Ministry was informed that Harry had returned to the apartment and not, as we were led to believe, died a horrible death at the hands of one escaped Corban Yaxley? If so, please do enlighten us, I’d
“Fucking hell!” cursed Ginevra Weasley as her brother staggered back a few steps, hands flying to the side of his face. “You bloody
The ensuing wave of relief Harry felt at that moment was so immense and inexplicable he was temporarily floored. However, he quickly recovered and said simply with a grateful smile, “Thanks, Ron. Sounds good. Now
be thanking the heavens for this particular show of mercy. A miracle, some might call it. And yet, instead, here he was, actually and legitimately worrying.
After about five minutes of Draco tapping his foot, hands clasped tightly around his steaming mug of coffee (three sugars and two dollops of cream—not that Harry had memorised it or anything), grey eyes fixed on the floor, on the carpet, on the red wall behind Harry’s head—everywhere, really, but
Right. What Draco had promised. To stay calm. To remember they were helping Harry, they were helping his soulmate, they were doing their best to make sure he stayed alive, that he didn’t die in some sterilely empty hospital room in St. Mungo’s, die from wounds that had probably been inflicted by Yaxley’s accomplice during his escape, the accomplice Draco ought to have caught—
there with him. He distinctly remembered someone calling his name, sounding worried. Or, no, not his name, not Harry. They’d called him—
Pansy’s eyes sparkled with mirth and something much more sadistic, and Draco was afraid she’d say something uncalled for. But he needn’t have worried; instead of taunting Harry, she sighed softly and said, tone much gentler, “Look, Potter. Penelope’s my soulmate, it’s true. But she has a girlfriend. A fiancée, to be precise, as of a few weeks ago. And I’m happy for them.
But then, finally, the blond nodded stiffly and averted his eyes, a slight scowl still twisting across his face. “Fine.”
Draco gave a snort at that, but Harry steadfastly ignored the blond, instead smiling at Nic and nodding. “Will do. Thanks again.”
It wasn’t that he felt uncomfortable with Narcissa Malfoy here; on the contrary, Harry found he quite liked the woman. He figured that was just what happened when someone saved your life from a psychopathic snake-man.
There was a long beat of silence in which neither party quite seemed to know how to react to the other. Then Draco blinked and, hand mixer still held high, said, “You’re awake.”
But, no, that was definitely Draco Malfoy barrelling towards them through the restaurant. But not the regal, elegant version of him Harry’s traitorous mind had conjured up only moments prior—this one looked a lot less elegant and a lot more manic, not to mention twice, no, triple as scary.
Harry smiled, and Malfoy must have been as uncertain as Harry was, for the sight visibly calmed the blond, making his shoulders sag slightly. No—not Malfoy, Harry reminded himself, and an inexplicable surge of warmth went through his chest.
Draco didn’t like violence, never had, never would, especially not after all he’d seen first-hand during the war. He didn’t like hurting people and he certainly didn’t like having to kill. It was one of the only qualms he’d had about becoming an Auror—he still had nightmares sometimes, even three years later, of screaming and crying and begging echoing through the Manor’s halls, of Bellatrix’s manic cackling or Voldemort’s cold laugh before a flash of green.
“Right then,” said Harry, looking from Draco to Nic. The smile he sent the other man, if small, made Draco want to break something. Preferably Hayes’ face. “See you later, then?”
The Gryffindor’s eyebrows shot sky-high, and he crossed his arms, coming to a complete stop as he turned to face Draco. “Oh
,” he heard himself say, and just like that the silence evaporated again, an excited buzz overtaking not only their table, but those closest to them as well. Apparently, and Harry really should have seen this coming before speaking, there had been more than just his friends’ ears listening in.
That might cause Harry to re-evaluate his previous statement on not being as undateable as a potato after all.
Except Lucius, who had been no doubt the most model Malfoy to ever impose his foul presence upon the world—rich, influential, and all-round unpleasant, cold-hearted monster—was in prison, without a family to hark back to, without friends, without even his precious estate. And Draco didn’t know much about his future, but he sure as hell knew he wasn’t going to end up like that.
So, yeah. That really just happened. To everyone who commented in earlier chapters that Nic was kinda sus—you were right! Yay! You can now officially say your judgement is better than Harry’s (not that that’s hard to manage lmao, Harry is, as we have already established, an idiot)
Draco loosened a sigh. “Not any more so than she’s been these past three years, I suppose. She says she’s fine, and that I needn’t worry, that she’d tell me if something were the matter. Only…well, I still worry, don’t I? A part of me feels like I should be at the Manor with her, just in case. But then again, there’s nothing I
Harry stood so abruptly Draco started in surprise. But Harry just threw the half-eaten bar of chocolate onto the kitchen counter and extended his now-free hand to where the blond Slytherin still sat on the floor, looking torn between his previous misery and wary confusion.
“—working on him as we speak.” It was Blaise again, but his voice sounded oddly far away, as though he weren’t standing across the room but on the other side of a large, yawning chasm, separating Draco from the rest of the world. “He’ll pull through; he’s
Again, I’m sorry this chapter turned out so long, there was just a lot a lot to fit into it, as you have now witnessed first-hand.
Through the flames, Draco could see Yaxley’s gaunt face, distorted with rage, those hollow black eyes glinting with such pure hatred it sent a shudder down Draco’s spine. His eyes narrowed and, with an especially ferocious growl, Yaxley threw himself forwards, towards the flames, hands reaching out for Draco.
Harry furrowed his brows, confused, and strained his neck to see what the fuss was about—only to do a double-take, blinking repeatedly just to make sure he wasn’t hallucinating.
Yaxley chuckled, and the unnatural sound was accompanied by another bang of green light, making Draco wince despite himself. “No, of course he is. Silly me. I’d have heard, if not. You understand, I had to ask—after all, my accomplice is quite unpredictable.”
“So what,” he said, and he couldn’t hold back the cold anger seeing into his tone, “you came here just to insult Draco and me?”
The door flew open, and Draco launched himself backwards so fast he very nearly tripped over his own feet. Thankfully, however, he managed to keep at least a part of his dignity intact, and he turned to find none other than Ronald fucking Weasley standing in the doorway, looking at the same time bewildered and startled and distrustful as he regarded them. Or, rather, as he regarded Draco.
When they finally did, Harry and Draco both were breathless, panting but simultaneously smiling so wide it was a wonder their faces didn’t collapse under the strain.
Harry looked up, surprised to find Draco’s face smoothed into a sombre expression, grey eyes flickering across Harry’s face. The Slytherin sighed and set down the mixer, and in that moment it cracked something in Harry’s chest seeing how disheartened and exhausted and hopeless Draco looked.
what he was to Draco, never would, because even after all this time spent together, even after becoming friends and learning to trust each other, even then Harry couldn’t love him the way Draco wanted—no—
First of all, how he’d let Potter convince him to take them both to Knockturn Alley of all places, even with the extra protection the other two Aurors working the case provided, was still a mystery to Draco. One moment, it had looked as though he’d win—because, honestly, how could he have foreseen that Robards would act so…so…so bloody
“Oh dear,” came a different voice, and a new face appeared above him. It was a pudgy man with silver-grey hair, and although it took a moment, Harry’s mind supplied a name before the rest of his senses had the chance to catch up.
“He’ll make a full recovery,” Harry answered instantly, repeating Healer Hodkinson’s words. God knows he’d had the man recite it often enough. “Bunch of bruises and cuts and a mild concussion, but nothing the healers couldn’t take care of. He’ll be out cold for a few more hours, though, sleeping off the healing potions. The main problem was the Moonroot. Yaxley’d coated his dagger with it, and when he cut Draco it seeped into his bloodstream. It was…a close call.” He wasn’t sure he could say much else, not without his voice becoming pitifully strained.
“Shut your mouth, Malfoy,” the She-Weasel growled, and judging by the closeness of the words she was standing right beside him, wand no doubt drawn.
But then the brunet turned to Harry, forcing another smile as he nodded. “Yeah. Just some beignets. They’re sort of a family recipe, if you will; Grandma was famous for them. I could never get enough as a child, so I learned to make them myself, and, well. I thought you might like some.”
Harry forgot to breathe. Either that, or perhaps his heart just stopped working entirely, split in two by that horrid sensation of fear that had suddenly gripped him and wouldn’t let go.
Yet it was his calculating Slytherin eye that immediately took in every single detail of the room, however tiny and trivial it may seem, and immediately relaxed when he realized that, no, there were no murderous Death Eaters lurking behind the door or hiding in the curtains, poised to attack.
. Blaise had yet to find his soulmate, but the day he did, Draco vowed the most epic teasing of all time would commence, as payback for all the shit Blaise had given Draco over the years for his crush on Harry.
Harry wasn’t so sure about that. He couldn’t be mad at Hermione or fault her for simplifying matters just because her situation had been so, well,
The Slytherin’s narrowed eyes never left Nic once as he snapped, “He didn’t get any letters because this entire building is
engraved in his wrist—after all, the single letter only ever turned into a full name if there were, err, feelings there—Potter would likely still find a
At that, Harry honestly thought Draco might whip out his wand and Avada Kedavra him right then and there, muggle witnesses and Statute of Secrecy be damned.
Blaise chuckled. “Let’s get you dressed first. After all, you need to look your best if you’re going to win over Harry Potter.”
Potter simply huffed, throwing his hands up in frustration. “If they love me so much, then why can’t they bloody well leave me be for five minutes?
Malfoy still had that indecipherable look in his eyes, but he shook his head and barked a small laugh nevertheless. “Fine. But if you ever say a word to
Harry’s blurred shape stepped closer again, and Yaxley’s grip on Draco tightened some more, and in that moment, several things happened at once.
…but if he just knocked once to make sure Draco was indeed planning on coming back out tonight, that wouldn’t hurt anyone, right?
Harry offered him a quick grin, already busy pulling on a light jacket and his favourite pair of trainers, excitement taking hold of his every nerve once again. “Okay,” he said cheerily. “But can it wait? Robards agreed, so you have no reason to force me to stay.”
Hayes waved a dismissive hand, and that’s when Draco knew for sure the git was planning something. There was no other explanation, especially after he said, “No worries, all is forgiven. Would I have liked to go on a few more dates with you? Sure. Who wouldn’t? But I suppose we can’t all have what we want, right?”
But Potter’s gaze didn’t drop, emerald stare triumphant. “That’s exactly what I mean! You already get defensive when I mention your soulmark. Now imagine the entirety of Wizarding Britain talking about it. You can’t simply
It wasn’t that he didn’t want kids, nor that he didn’t think himself capable of raising an actual human being, temper tantrums and all. On the contrary, he knew he could do it, might even enjoy it.
“Yes, because that’s essentially my only function,” Draco drawled, and Harry was so thankful he didn’t glower back at Ginny, although there was no way the Slytherin had missed the intensity of her narrow-eyed gaze. “Draco Malfoy, the baking slave who lives to serve Gryffindors.”
, no wonder Nic wasn’t glad to see him. Harry felt like facepalming. Draco was right, he truly was a blind, insensitive moron.
Because—and Harry would never admit this to Ron, though he strongly suspected the redhead already knew—Ron and Hermione really were perfect together, and he couldn't be happier for them if he tried.
. Remember how you were just lecturing me about faking a smile? Humility is the most rudimentary and gross form of fakeness, Potter. No one—I repeat,
Yes, Harry had invited Ginny. Of course he had. They were still friends after all, even after their breakup. Plus, Ron would have probably murdered him had he not; Ron was a great best mate, yes, but even that wouldn’t save Harry from the wrath of an older brother if Harry decided to completely sever ties with Ginny.
He thought of lying, of denying it and insulting Granger and simply walking out, leaving, just as he yearned to do.
Draco scowled. “I’m an Auror, Blaise. Danger’s quite literally in the job description. Where’s all this new-found concern coming from?”
. There’s no reason you should be out in the open like this, not when Yaxley has proven himself far more resourceful than anyone could have predicted. He obviously has allies in high places, otherwise there’s no way he’d have escaped the platoon of Aurors Robards sent after him the other day. And if thirty-something Aurors can’t hold their own against him, I doubt a disgraced heir, a fashion designer and a Healer-in-training will do you much good, Harry.”
. And here I thought boyfriends were supposed to be all loving and supportive. Serves me right for assuming, I guess.”
They just stood there in silence for an instant, and as Draco studied Granger closer, as he watched her so resolutely
Jennings said from where he and his partner still stood near the door, “Do you remember anything that might help us identify him? Hair colour, perhaps? Was his voice noticeably deep or particularly gruff? Did he say anything odd?”
“Malfoy!” he shouted, a grin already twisting its way across his face. “Malfoy, come here. Robards wrote!”
Within an instant, two pairs of eyes focused on him, one blue, one grey, and Harry cursed his complete lack of grace. However, he forced a small smile, although its effectiveness was likely limited due to his pre-existing grimace.
Malfoy snorted, but Harry was glad for it when the tension previously spiking the blond’s shoulders faded. “
“Philomena. I wish I could say it's a pleasure, but then I'd be lying. The name's Draco Malfoy—though I'm sure you realised that the moment we walked in the door.” The woman’s eyes narrowed and her lips pursed, confirming Draco's suspicions, but he didn’t allow his mask to crack. “I'm sure the both of us would rather this be handled as swiftly as at all possible, so I’m going to make this quick: There was an attempted murder the day before yesterday, one we recently discovered was carried out with the help of the poison commonly known as Acturin. I’m sure you know what I'm talking about, since it was here in this very store said poison was bought. Now, we’d like to know who this mystery buyer was, when they bought the Acturin, and how much of it was sold. It’s rather urgent, too, so if you didn’t put up that much of a fight, it’d be appreciated. And,” he added when the woman opened her mouth, expression indignant, “before you decide to grace us with another series of uninspired insults, Philomena: none of what I just said was a request. We are Aurors employed by the Ministry of Magic—not prey you can bully into submission."
Healer Hodkinson, however, breathed a sigh of relief. “Well, that’s good news! At least that’s only a day of memories lost. Could have been much worse, Mr. Potter. You should count yourself lucky.”
And Yaxley raised his wand until the tip of it hovered directly between Draco’s eyes, whose heart was beating thunderously in his chest and gaze went slightly cross-eyed trying to keep his eyes on the tip of the wand that was to bring his death, and the Death Eater smirked and said what Draco realized—after all he’d been through, after all he’d survived, after all he’d so painstakingly worked through just to find his way back into society, into reality, into
This week was rather shitty for me, so I've decided to post the next chapter today already in hopes that it might lighten my mood. So much for a regular upload schedule lol, sorry.
. Was that really so fucking impossible a task? You couldn’t send one of your five dozen other siblings to babysit? You had to drag Harry into it?”
But Yaxley simply snorted and tightened his grip on Draco. “You know what, Mr. Potter, I think I’m going to have to decline. Appreciate your gracious offer as I may, I’d much rather stay and watch you panic. Can’t save everyone, I’m afraid.” He altered his grip on Draco, shifting his hand so it curled directly above the cut, eliciting a pained cry from Draco. “It’s Moonroot, in case you were wondering. Lovely little flower, one of my all-time favourites.”
The words held so much venom it was almost a tangible thing, but, whereas the Draco of four years ago would have minded the comment about his father, twenty-year-old, Harry-Potter-dating Draco honestly couldn’t have cared less.
Draco felt like he was wearing his heart on his sleeve, exposed, unprotected, practically begging to be trampled and wrecked and destroyed beyond repair. He’d done many a risky thing in his life—joining Voldemort, defecting, going into Auror training, running after Yaxley without backup. And yet the biggest risk he’d ever taken was
He smiled at Nic and asked gently, since Draco obviously wasn’t about to, “What happened on Tuesday?”
And, damn it, Draco wanted to say he did. He wanted to reassure Harry, tell him everything would be fine and that there was no need to worry. After all, Harry deserved that, didn’t he? He was right—after all the years of running from Voldemort, of living under the constant fear of dying, he deserved a fucking break.
Malfoy’s lips twitched slightly, as though the Slytherin might just smile. “You sure Auror’s the right job for you, Potter? You’re starting to sound an awful lot like a Mind Healer.”
And whatever Blaise saw in his eyes must have been sufficient, for the other man’s lips lifted at the edges, and he gave Draco an approving, perhaps even proud nod. “Good.”
Especially when she said, “You know, Draco, I don’t think you are as much of a git as you might like people to think.”
Except Draco was a coward, always had been, always would be, and so, needless to say, he didn’t use a single one of those replies.
“Oh, please,” Yaxley said, bored, disinterested, as though the words didn’t so much as daunt him. “You said it yourself: I’m going to be incarcerated for life anyway. It hardly matters whether or not I help you do your job now. If anything, really, refusing to comply is my last hurrah of sorts.”
Nic’s mouth tapered, and he shot another wary look at Draco, who simply smiled back, expression so sickly sweet it reminded Harry briefly and repulsively of Dolores Umbridge, may her soul rot in hell.
And before Draco or Yaxley could react in any way, none other than one bloodied, dishevelled-looking, but no less steely-faced Harry Potter emerged from the shadows, wand trained on Yaxley, emerald eyes gleaming with that uncontainable, nonpareil fervour of his.
“You won’t be needing that, dear,” Narcissa said calmly, red lips twisting upwards. She stood tall and calm, completely unbothered by the wand pointed straight at her face. “I assure you I come in peace.”
The bushy-haired Gryffindor winced ever so slightly, and not even the dark brown of her skin could hide the blush furiously blooming on her face. As a matter of fact, Draco noted even through his bewilderment, she looked almost
, then surely Draco wouldn’t be smiling at him like that. Surely he wouldn’t be looking at Harry like he was the biggest and brightest star in the night sky, like he was the single most important person in the entirety of St. Mungo’s, of Wizarding Britain, of the
“I mean just that,” Narcissa answered. “A message was slipped into his copy of the Daily Prophet a few days ago, telling him that if he told you anything, he’d regret it.”
First Pansy Parkinson, who, true to her word, left again after a brief chat with Draco that had left the blond Slytherin wearing a disgruntled scowl overtop of his batter-spattered clothes. Harry had no idea what the hell Parkinson had said to him to ruffle him so but decided it was likely most sensible to give Draco some space after that. So Harry had simply plucked a book from his shelf labelled “Quidditch Icons of the Past Century” (the last present Ginny had given him before their breakup) and plopped down on his usual armchair across from where Draco sat in his own, a thick, leatherbound book perched on the Slytherin’s pointy knees, and the two of them had read their respective books in amicable silence.
Harry’s reaction, on the other hand, was much less contained, and so there was little Draco could do before his boyfriend had already jumped up, wand out and pointed at the ‘intruder’. Which would have been a commendable reaction, were it not for the fact that the Gryffindor’s glasses were hanging off one ear, completely askew, and he was wearing sweats and only one sock.
Draco’s mouth quirked into the tiniest of smiles, and although it was hardly anything at all compared to the humongous grin he’d worn plastered across his face during their play-duel, it made Harry instantly glad he’d held on.
And so, when Draco looked up to see none other than Corban Yaxley staring down at him, those familiar dark eyes blazing, all he could do was gape up at him in horror and shock.
is your problem?” seethed Ginevra. “Ron’s devastated, can you not see that? You have no right to come in here and accuse him of not caring about Harry, of—of—of indirectly
. I did not nearly break the Statute of Secrecy so you could get yourself murdered through your own stupidity, understood?”
“It’s because I cherish it that I’ve had such a hard time telling you what I’m about to say. I don’t want to ruin this—that’s the last thing I want—so this considerably more complicated than I might like.” Draco took a deep breath. Closed his eyes. Exhaled. And when those silver eyes opened again, they were drilling into Harry’s.
Narcissa’s answering smile held not a smidgeon of smugness or complacency as she inclined her head, and instead was one of complete and utter warmth and love and
.” Harry heaved a leaden sigh, but he didn’t sound annoyed, if anything, he sounded amused. “It’s just…back at the store, Pansy and I were talking.”
that laugh. That laugh, bloody hell, he remembered hearing that laugh at Malfoy Manor. Remembered sitting at the long, ebony dining table, horrified and sick to his stomach, as Voldemort perched at the head of the table with Nagini like some self-proclaimed king, petting the snake as though it were a cat, praising the face Draco knew that cold laugh belonged to, a face that had taken almost as much pleasure in torturing and murdering muggleborns as Bellatrix had. Bellatrix might have been much more obvious about it, but Draco still distinctly remembered how the man’s dark eyes had glowed every time he recounted his stories for all the Death Eaters to hear.
“Ooh, reverting to threats,” jeered Weasley, looking more She-Devil than She-Weasel with her fiery red hair and flashing eyes. “Now I’m scared. How entirely unexpected, from a Malfoy.”
Briefly, because the instant Draco had reached their table in a thunderstorm of red wizard robes and silver fury, he just
Both Pansy and Blaise rolled their eyes, but thankfully ceased any further talk about ‘the single most important moment of Draco’s life’. The two of them started politely engaging Harry in conversation, asking him about his friends and Quidditch and when he planned on repainting his living room walls (Pansy’s doing, naturally, although Draco voiced his vehement agreement) (up until the point she suggested a nice emerald green, that is, and although Harry had of course immediately accused her of trying to ‘Slytherin-ify his flat’, Draco had flushed and refused to look anywhere near Harry’s eyes for the ensuing five minutes).
Draco had done enough protecting this past month, had saved Harry more times than he could count, both physically and emotionally. The least he could do now was return the favour.
Draco was still shocked by this newest revelation about his mother, and he breathed, “Can I… I should go see her. I should—” He started past Blaise, but the other man’s hands quickly settled on Draco’s arms, effectively stopping him once again from running out the door.
Takeuchi was referring to the second round of questioning that would be performed after this one, and the third and the fourth and so on and so on, until they either got what they wanted or the prisoner was too much of a broken, sobbing mess to articulate their thoughts in a manner that was comprehensive enough to be submitted as a confession. Draco knew this, for he himself had once been subject to the whole charade, three years ago.
Harry pulled a face. So, Malfoy was as exasperating a git as he’d always been. “Oh, sod off. You know that’s not what I meant. What are
, than betray his master—that was what Draco associated that twisting feeling in his chest with. The anger it accompanied, and the despair, the misery, the
, he needed more time. That was all his sluggish brain could come up with, all his cyclone of racing thoughts could agree on.
. So much. To the point that he feared his chest might just constrict completely and his lungs would stop working. He’d collapse to the floor and his heart would burst and he’d die right there on the cold kitchen floor, knowing not only had he brought about his own soulmate’s ruin by letting the man who wanted to kill him know of his potentially greatest vulnerability, no, said soulmate didn’t even fucking
And although, judging by the way Harry drank merrily from his Butterbeer, afterwards wiping his mouth with his sleeve and launching into some conversation Draco was only barely aware of, the Gryffindor likely hadn’t put much thought into that last word—
He didn’t miss Blaise frowning slightly from where he still stood by Draco’s bed, dark eyes fixed on the cursive letters peeking out from under the fingers of Draco’s left hand. “He was here, by the way. Potter, I mean. Stayed the entire night in that chair right by the door.” He pointed at a particularly uncomfortable-looking chair, and Draco’s heart missed a beat.
people—can’t switch emotions like that. Or fake them, for that matter, at least not that efficiently.”
Except, no, that wasn’t true anymore. Perhaps a month ago he could have still claimed that, but certainly not now. Call him vapid or cliched or overly sentimental, but even with all that was going on, with Yaxley on the loose and his mother slowly wasting away and the most oblivious moron of all time stuck as his soulmate—even then, looking at Harry now and being able to confidently say
He couldn’t have spoken even had he known something to say, and so when Potter stepped towards the shopkeeper, thankfully not looking Draco’s way, his green eyes mirroring that same immutable determination that had awed Draco since they first met, he was grateful.
There was a long pause, and Harry stared at Draco and Draco stared at Harry, and then the Slytherin’s eyes widened and he was shaking his head with such vigour it sent another few strands of blond falling into his eyes.
Harry snorted, and, without glancing back at Malfoy again, traversed the apartment to the kitchen. There, he opened the fridge, taking his time rifling through its contents, all the while humming under his breath the Weird Sisters song Ron had forced him to listen to the other day whilst the two Aurors filled out reports regarding their case.
Draco drew his wand and started slowly, quietly, combing his way through the flat. No upturned furniture, or any other previously-inexistent mess that might indicate a struggle. And had Harry been attacked, regardless of whether he looked like ‘death personified’ or not, Salazar knows there’d have been a struggle. Yet this realization only calmed Draco somewhat, and he kept his wand at the ready.
The man’s answering scowl was immediate, and Draco found himself silently pleased at how easily and effectively he’d distracted the redhead with only a single vaguely snide comment.
Draco jumped out of the way just in time, Yaxley’s next curse missing him by mere hairsbreadths, so close it singed the side of his coat.
Draco swallowed hard, and when he spoke again, his voice was uncharacteristically frail. “She’s going to tell the world, isn’t she?”
Draco pursed his lips but then, slowly, carefully, raised first his left, then his right hand, taking a measured, cautious step backwards. Then another, and another, until the stranger grunted their approval.
Harry scowled at him but, honestly, how was Draco supposed to take the man seriously when he was looking like
“Why, Pansy, don’t be ridiculous,” Draco drawled. “Voldemort’s birthday isn’t until December.” But that half-arsed attempt at humour only earned him another narrow-eyed glare from his fellow Slytherin.
Again, Harry was happy for them. But that did nothing to reduce his own fears. Because, unlike Ron and Hermione, he hadn’t met his soulmate at age eleven, promptly becoming inseparable for the rest of their lives. And there really was no guarantee Harry would ever meet someone like that, someone who was his better half and he theirs. So Harry’s stomach constricted tighter every time his thoughts started to wander in that direction.
Hayes stiffened, and for a split-second there it was: the dislike Draco had expected, sizzling hot and intense as his eyes narrowed at Draco. But then the moment had passed, and Hayes focused his attention back on Harry, ignoring Draco as though he weren’t even there in the first place.
should have made Draco move, snap out of whatever daze he was suspended in, leave the cell, leave the Ministry. Go back to Harry, take him where no one could reach them, no one at all. “Something I think you’ll find very interesting indeed.”
had a crush on Potter. Which, of course, was wholly pointless, seeing as the full name now written on his wrist begged to differ.
Granger merely shrugged. “Then you just have to show him you two suit each other better.” A small smile broke out across her lips. “Plus, an apology—and I mean a
So he wrenched his gaze away from Harry and instead fixated his mother, who was still watching Harry with obvious amusement. Draco’s lips twitched. Amusement was good. Amusement he could work with.
at all. Draco had done the research; while very, very rare, unrequited soulmates did exist. Draco would never ever admit aloud, but he despised said second option with every fibre of his being.
Draco said farewell to the Gryffindors and headed for his room, all the while smiling faintly to himself. Perhaps the situation wasn’t quite as dire as he’d initially feared after all.
The Slytherin wouldn’t meet his eyes as he spoke, almost as though he was genuinely afraid Harry might be angry at him for keeping it a secret. The notion immediately dispelled whatever small kernel of displeasure Harry might’ve still been holding on to, and he gave Draco’s hand a small reassuring squeeze, smiling gently when their eyes met.
Something about the figure felt off, and so Harry slipped into the shadows as well and followed the figure down the unusually empty street, wand all the while drawn, footsteps so quiet they were near-silent. He kept his distance at first, but then the figure veered into a narrow alleyway, and Harry took a second to curse his bad luck, but then hastened to follow.
Draco gritted his teeth and inhaled deep. And then he pushed down on the doorknob, wand raised in front of him, and entered the office.
He was cut short as Harry’s lips crashed back against his. The Gryffindor threw his arms around Draco, his
The word elicited an involuntary flinch from Draco, but the youngest Weasley either didn’t notice or didn’t care, for she soldiered on without hesitation.
Still at the fireplace, Nic cleared his throat, reminding Harry with a bang that he was, in fact, staring at Draco again. The brunet looked exceedingly uncomfortable, especially as he said, “Uhm…okay then. Anyway, I’m sorry if I came at a bad time, I can leave again if you want—”
Then there was that; the fact that Harry Potter and Pansy Parkinson, the two banes of Draco’s existence, had over the course of the past one hour somehow managed to become friends. Alright, maybe ‘friends’ was pushing it, but they were certainly a hell of a lot less hostile towards each other than they’d been before this little outing. Pansy had even pulled Draco aside at one point to tell him with a smirk, quote, ‘I’m starting to see why you like him so much. He’s rather adorable, your boy, at least when you get past the hero-complex and absolute lack of style.’.
. “I sure hope you weren’t about to say ‘he’s used it’, because that’s tactless even for your standards, Weasley. You don’t just ‘get used to’ people trying to kill you. Now move, or so help me Salazar, I will move you.”
They just stood there for a moment or two, and Harry only realised belatedly he was staring (alright,
The Slytherin’s eyes narrowed, and for a moment Harry feared another argument might break out, this time in the limited, confined space of his living room.
“What?” asked Harry, and Draco turned to see him standing in the exact spot he’d left him, arms crossed, looking disastrously handsome in all his early-morning glory, a gentle smile coasting across his lips as he regarded Draco with what could only be interpreted as affection.
Beside her, Weasley opened his mouth, looking properly spooked. No doubt to give some utterly moronic comment, because there was no filter in between the man’s brain and mouth.
But then he also thought of Harry, of the hurt in his face when Draco had lashed out, of the disappointment and disgust he’d known even then he deserved.
So, yeah, while pointed glares and switching topics usually saved him from too many awkward conversations and less-than-subtle attempts to set him up with Seamus' sister's boyfriend's ex or whoever it was this time...well, suffice to say Harry knew none of that would save him tomorrow.
What followed next could only be described as a chaotic mess of spells and insults, underscored by the occasional laugh and cackle from Harry and Draco respectively. Draco, Harry learned, had indeed improved quite a staggering amount since their infamous duel back in Second Year. He may not have Harry’s vastness of sheer power, but that didn’t matter whatsoever, for Draco certainly made up for it in his casting. Each spell was meticulously cast and expertly aimed. Plus, Draco was fast, faster than Harry would quite like to admit, not only in his casting, but also in his reactions. The quick agility with which he dodged Harry’s jinxes made him an impossible target to hit, and, for the first time in a while, Harry didn’t hold back one bit. Because, one, there was no need to do so, and two, he strongly suspected that, if he did, Draco would personally drown him in a bowl of chocolate batter.
through his veins. For as much as he knew it was a futile hope, he wanted Harry to disagree. To tell him no, he had indeed misheard, that Nic was a friend and nothing more, that Harry wouldn’t ever go on a date with him no matter how much the man threw himself at his feet. Draco wanted that so. Much. More than he could even begin to fathom.
And so, he swallowed hard, and nodded. “I’m sorry. I…I didn’t mean for any of it to happen. Yaxley…he caught me off guard, caught both of us off guard…” At that, his eyes trailed back over to Draco’s bed, and Harry went quiet, the lump in his throat making any further words impossible.
Indeed, Harry stammered and stuttered, until eventually he just averted his gaze, glaring down at his plate, and muttered petulantly, “That’s rather private, y’know.”
There was a moment of silence, and although Harry itched to look up, he did not, too afraid he might fall back into whatever bizarre spell had taken hold of him moments before.
Draco’s hearing fizzled out during the end of that last sentence, so he couldn’t be exactly sure whether that had been what Yaxley had said. The pain was becoming unbearable and had now engulfed his entire upper body, making it not only progressively impossible to think, but to breathe as well. His head was buzzing and ringing all at once, and he had to blink multiple times just to keep his vision from going as black as the night sky above.
During his years at Hogwarts, it had been a recurring joke amongst the Gryffindors that Harry practically lived in the Hospital Wing. And although Harry had always maintained he was not to blame for it, there was no denying the accuracy of that particular statement. After leaving the school, Harry had hoped that’d be the last of it. However, he thought as he found himself for the second time that week sitting in a bright, spotless hospital room in St. Mungo’s, trying to keep his eyes open after a long night of no sleep, some things simply never changed.
But he couldn’t claim something hadn’t changed in Renaults and Co., something so profound it had sent the typically so expressive Slytherin into a lapse of never-ending silence. Even now, ten minutes after they’d left the shop, Malfoy still hadn’t uttered a single word. He’d simply handed the vial of Philomena Craigs’ memories to Jennings and walked away, leaving Harry to quickly say goodbye to the two other Aurors before zipping after him. Malfoy hadn’t even
“Well, surprise,” said Harry, grinning. A grin that only widened when Draco pulled a face, making him laugh. “And here I thought you’d be glad to see I did, in fact,
Harry had just opened his mouth to reply, when the doors across the room flew open and in marched Healer Hodkinson. The man froze dead in his tracks the moment he realised just who was keeping Harry company, and he blinked, startled, eyes darting between Pansy and Draco, evidently unsure which ‘who’ was worse.
Blaise nodded severely. “My apologies. Let me rephrase that: What has our favourite Saviour been doing to pass his time in this prison of a hospital, save for snogging Draco? Please, I’m genuinely interested. Three whole days cooped up in here—I’d have never thought you capable of such a feat.”
Awkward silence filled the room, and Hermione had the decency to look distressed when she realized what exactly it was she’d just said. “God, Harry, I’m sorry. That’s…good lord, that was rather tactless, wasn’t it?”
. And not even because it was literally his job, his assignment, something that he was at the end of the day being paid to do, but because he was Harry’s soulmate and Harry his, because protecting him and making sure he stayed safe was without the shadow of a doubt the most important task of his life.
“So, you’re here because…?” he began, lifting an eyebrow of his own as he eyed the other man with a sneer.
Nic’s gaze remained downwards for another few seconds, silent as he stared into his glass, watched the little bubbles of carbonated water shoot out of the cup.
Harry was too stunned to reply. The icy drawl, the sneer, the glare—it reminded Harry far too much of Hogwarts-era-Draco, of Draco-the-blood-purist, of
. “Tell me, or I’m not coming.” He scowled. “Wait, no, I’m not coming regardless, because as you well know I’m on a
The problem was, however, that Harry had absolutely no idea how good parenting was supposed to look. His own childhood had been shite. That much was a fact. The Dursleys hadn’t exactly been good role models, and although the teachers at Hogwarts—McGonagall and Dumbledore especially—had certainly shaped Harry’s childhood in the best way, they still hadn’t been parent figures either. Guardians, sure, but parents…not so much.
Even now, three years after the war had ended, Harry had yet to return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He didn't know if he ever would.
packed into that last word. Harry always had been too expressive. "You were there, he was being an arsehole for no reason—”
Now, just to be clear, if anyone other than Ron or Hermione had said that, Harry would have thrown up at the sheer amount of sappiness. However, he'd had to learn the hard way that Ronald Bilius Weasley, contrary to what one might expect, was the biggest sap in existence—a character flaw that had only been amplified when he and Hermione got together. In the years since he'd had to endure many sappy looks, cheesy words and adorable yet sickening kisses, but he'd endured it.
Whilst sitting in that god-awful hospital chair, waiting for Draco to wake up, Harry had had plenty of time to think about things—including how he’d spent an entire evening with Draco Malfoy of all people, talking and laughing as though they’d been friends all their life, drinking copious amounts of Butterbeer like they were back at Hogwarts. After that eye-opening experience, there was no way Harry could look at the blond in the same way he had before, no feasible way he could consider him an enemy anymore.
And at that moment, the Floo sounded, and a red-haired, gangly figure burst into the flat, coughing violently.
the whole ten minutes he was here? One more of those ridiculously pathetic smiles and I’d have lost my breakfast.”
“Yeah,” Lavender agreed slowly. “Much better than ‘Draco Malfoy, the arrogant pureblood bastard that hates all Gryffindors’, that’s for sure.”
“But…but…,” Harry stammered. Why wasn’t Draco flinging that bowl of batter at Harry’s head? He bloody well
Harry only dimly noted how Draco hadn’t, in fact, apologized for his own behaviour on Tuesday evening, too utterly flummoxed by the man’s sudden change of heart. And, okay, yes, wary, too. Because, to put it simply, what the actual fuck was happening.
Harry huffed a laugh. “Hell if I know. I mean, you saw how angry he was when he got back from the Ministry. He was livid and wouldn’t even tell me why. I figured it must’ve been because of Yaxley—”
But all Draco could feel as he watched the broken shell of a human being stare at his interrogator, a small, slippery smile snaking across his face, pulling at it in truly unnatural ways, was hatred. A hatred so deep-rooted and intense it almost equalled what he’d felt for Voldemort in those last months, what he felt even now at times when he thought of his father and all he’d done to their family.
Harry blinked, realizing belatedly that he must've been in a momentary daze of sorts, for he had completely lost track of the conversation. "Sorry, what?"
The she-devil simply puckered her violet lips and fluttered her eyelashes and cooed “Love you, too, darling”, and Draco knew the gesture alone would be enough to send his heart a-fluttering, were he not, of course, so regrettably gay.
to vent his anger, to ease the chaotic, searing bundle of emotions twisting and writhing within him, if only briefly.
How did Harry know this? Well, for one, wood was far too coarse a material for the git, with all his pureblood elegance and soft edges and ethereal grace. Porcelain would be more fitting, or perhaps glass, beautiful and polished, but cutting if handled incorrectly.
“Seriously, what happened to you?” Harry asked and took a step forward. “Are you ill? Hurt? Did someone attack you? I can Side-Along you to St. Mungo’s right away if you think you’re up for it—”
