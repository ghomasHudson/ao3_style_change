." Ginny said with complete revulsion in her voice. Harry laughed. He knew his friends were just surprised and being slightly over dramatic. This would all pass.
"You most certainly do." Dean insisted. "Come on Potter, we're all deathly curious." Harry shook his head, laughing some more as his friends began to throw out names.
"I've always preferred strawberry myself but smoking is a terrible habit Harry." Harry shrugged.
"Yeah well... Now I'm nervous." Harry said, tossing his cloak onto the dresser by Draco's bed.
"Theresa Gonzalez."
"Not from us." Ron said. "Is it my sister?" He demanded, pointing at Ginny.
"I don't know what to say to you." Harry said, refusing to turn around. Draco slowly let go of Harry's arm.
"Yes, we are." Harry sighed. "Ron and I tried to calm her down but... She wouldn't talk to me for almost a month after I think... It was dreadfully long is all I know. She was especially mad that the only punishment I got was a few weeks of detention."
"Who was it?" Dean demanded. "Someone we know?"
"Draco, one of the last things Harry said to us was that he wanted to walk into the Forbidden Forest and wait for something to kill him. Would he go there?" As soon as Hermione said this, Draco's eyes lit up and he stood. Hermione and Ron scrambled to stand with him.
"What?"
"Why didn't you think to check out here?" Ron asked.
"You sound like some sex-worker you idiot."
"Come to my room tonight." Draco said as Harry pushed him up against a wall, kissing down Draco's neck and trying to decide where to leave a large purple bruise.
"That's the nice part. Who cares about me? At least you know how much your mom loves you." Harry said. Draco, touched Harry's hand lightly as he began to fold the letter back up.
"What?" Draco demanded.
"Hey Malfoy." Harry said before cringing at his stupidly overly cheerful greeting. Draco glanced over at him, tucking his books under his arm.
"Prat." Blaise fired back with a wicked smile before exiting the room, closing the door behind him. Draco huffed and flopped onto his back on his bed.
"Jerk."
"Really? Could've sworn I heard a hollow knocking sound when you did that." Laughter bubbled out of Harry and Draco found himself smiling as he watched him laugh in the middle of the Forbidden Forest.
"What happened?" Pansy said.
Draco." Harry said with a frown.
be fine." Harry said. Hermione nodded before slowly letting go of him.
"What? Is there nothing over there? No happy afterlife? No horribly painful one? Is it just... Nothing?" Draco said. Harry shrugged.
." Harry said as if he had said something different. Draco sighed.
just months after we started to become friends... I just... I want to make sure you
"I guess I still don't really know. I mean... I haven't really figured out what I'm supposed to do now that Voldemort is dead and we're no longer fighting. I don't even have hobbies or anything Draco or aspirations or dreams. I have... Nothing." Draco frowned at his tea. "Actually that's a lie. I know one thing about myself which is the only reason I'm sure you asked this question." Draco looked up to see Harry smirking lightly. Draco blushed.
"Diana Roth!"
"I'm trying to make sure you don't leave me alone in the morning." Draco said.
was if he got even just one kiss from you. One kiss and he felt that... All of his troubles would melt away." The tension in Harry's shoulders fell and the expression on his face became one of bewilderment.
"So it's a guy..." Neville said. "That significantly lowers the pool of people to choose from." Everyone arched an eyebrow at Neville. "Well first we've narrowed it down to the guys and there are significantly less guys at Hogwarts than there are girls and we can narrow it down further to that small group of people who have come out and there we have it." Neville said.
"I can and I will." Draco said.
"I don't either." Ginny said with a frown. Luna shrugged.
you find out?" Draco asked. Blaise shrugged.
"Harry how could you!" Ron exclaimed while Harry turned bright red with embarrassment.
"I'm... I'm sorry for bringing him up. That was insensitive." Hermione said softly.
"I told you to
"Yeah, I am pretty unbelievable but I'm right. I
"How do you know Reggie?" Draco gave Harry a look like he was stupid which, he sort of was.
"Uhh... Like... A Date?" Harry said.
"At least it's different. Nebraska is pretty nice." Blaise said.
"I'm fine." Draco said through his teeth. He didn't want to argue with Harry. He just wanted to kiss his stupid lips and get the image out of his head of Harry standing over him in that bathroom. Even after all this time, Draco hadn't been able to decide what kind of expression Harry had been wearing as he watched Draco bleed out.
"And you
"Oh yeah." Seamus said, standing with him. "See you lot later." Seamus smiled as he and Dean said goodbye, the two boys walking off together and talking about their Herbology class.
"What?"
"I don't think that will work for me." Draco said. Harry leaned in and kissed him lightly.
Voldemort." Draco said. The two boys were glaring at each other, faces inches apart. "You were
"He helped carry things into the apartment but I decorated, yes. Thank you Pansy." Hermione said. Pansy then shoved the potted flower she was holding into Hermione's hands.

"It just felt like a good time. Neville's speech was over, he pulled the sword out of the sorting hat..." Harry paused. "I didn't want him to get hurt."
"Did you want a bad grade?" Draco said, arching an eyebrow at him. Harry shook his head and pushed his glasses back up to the bridge of his nose. "Well shut up then Potter."
"O-okay." Harry said, confused and unsure of what was happening. Draco sighed.
"Ron, you're drunk." Harry said, standing and walking towards his friends. "Let's go." Harry grabbed his arm but Ron just glared at him.
"What?" Harry said. Luna smiled.
"Seriously?"
." Draco heard a voice behind him say softly.  Draco immediately panicked, knowing what the spell meant.  He would be stuck to this chair or the table for the next five minutes or so which could only mean... Harry had finally caught him. Draco was scowling when Harry came and sat in the chair next to Draco, careful to not touch the table.  He watched Draco strain to pull his arms up off of the wood but it wouldn't work. "Stop avoiding me." Harry said.
"I... Yeah I think so. I haven't exactly encountered a snake in a while or anything but I'm sure it's all still there." Harry said, tapping his temple lightly.
"Luna must have been seeing things." Draco said in a hard voice.
"I didn't even think about it until Hermione brought it up actually." Harry said with a shake of his head. "He was a good looking guy." Harry said with a soft smile.
"What?" Blaise said. Draco huffed, crossing his arms over his chest. "Did I walk in on something?" Blaise said. Draco was still clothed, the buttons of his shirt were undone and his hair was slightly askew but nothing looked out of sorts. "Don't worry. I won't be here for long."

"A... A year or two?" Draco spat out. "Who
"Called it." George said with an evil grin.
"You're both giving me fuckin' anxiety." Ron muttered, taking out his wand so he could light the cigarette. Harry smiled lightly at his best friend as strawberry smoke began to drift around them. "What are you too even doing out here. Don't you have class?" Ron demanded.
"Come to the tower tonight and find out." Draco said with a smirk, walking away. Harry found himself blushing a little and hoped other people weren't staring at them. They might start to wonder about the two of them and Harry didn't want rumors to start swirling around when he had barely begun to figure out his feelings on his own.
"What kind of question is that? No, I wouldn't prefer. I'm sure the girl version of you would be even harder to read. Your mood swings would be... Legendary." Harry said. Draco smirked.
"I think we're sure Harry. " Harry sighed. He knew Ginny was right. Everything felt a little... Weird between them ever since Harry had died, came back to life and had to deal with the repercussions of the war. He had spent the entire summer at the Weasley house, trying not to think too hard about Fred or Remus or Tonks or any of the number of other people who had died not just in the war, but over the course of the last eighteen years of his life. The only thing that kept him from spiraling into darkness was a small bouncing baby boy whose hair was often a bright blue and Ginny who always smiled so warmly at him no matter how she was feeling.
Harry was pacing in Draco's room as Draco took his Slytherin robe off and dropped it in his open drawer, not caring if it got wrinkled. "Will you stop fussing." Draco said, watching him turn on his heel again.
"You're not. Don't
"Kiss me, please." He said. That's all Harry had been thinking about honestly but he wasn't sure if Draco wanted to kiss him. Harry leaned in and kissed him slowly. "I still love you." Draco whispered. "Nothings going to change that."
"She told me about how you apologized to her last month." Harry said. Draco blushed red.
Two days later, Harry was still missing and nobody at Hogwarts had any idea as to where he might be.
"Weasley just needs some time. He lost his brother. He still hasn't processed all of it properly. Eventually he'll stop acting so much... Like me." Draco said with a smirk. Harry didn't smile though.
"Say it like you mean it." Draco said.
"Why would I douse perfectly good cigarettes with a love potion?" Draco demanded, slowly tearing a roll into pieces and eating it.
"I just... I wanted to. Is that bad?"
"Okay, what in bloody hell is wrong with you."Ron said, slamming his book closed.
left that room." Harry almost said
"I can't believe you're all defending them." Ron said with a sneer.
"You kissed me first." Draco said in a hard voice.
"I won't leave then." Harry said softly. "But if Blaise is going to find out, we might as well tell everyone." Draco snorted.
"It's okay. I felt
"Harry will you talk to me now, please." Draco begged, grabbing Harry's arm. Hermione was still crying and Ron was trying to comfort her while also trying to pay attention to the two boys in front of him.
"Harry Potter!" A voice boomed. Harry would recognize that voice anywhere. Draco stepped into the Great Hall smirking up a storm, pleased that everyone's eyes were on him.
"Stop, that's far enough." Ron said, holding his hand out. Their friends laughed.
"Well shit." Ron said. Mrs. Weasley glared at him. "Mum was really hopping you would join the family."

"Yes. It's really fun." Draco said. Harry shook his head.
"I... I don't remember that." Harry said slowly.
"You've been avoiding us." Pansy accused.

"That doesn't sound like
your fault." Hermione wondered if Pansy knew about him and Harry.

The door was open this time and When Harry stepped into the room, he found Draco sitting completely out of the window, his legs dangling out in open air. He was leaning over so far that Harry thought he might jump. Fear seized his heart for some reason. Harry quickly walked forward and grabbed the hood of Draco's robe. He didn't even look back at him. "Are you fuckin' insane?" Harry demanded.
"I can't sleep. This Castle..." Harry paused. "It used to make me so happy being here. Now it just feels like it's filled with..." Harry stopped again.
"Barely. He's only in our room for minutes at a time." Draco said with a shrug.
"You." Harry said after a beat of silence.
"I'm thinking of selling Harry's stuff on the blackmarket. Everyone wants a piece of the Chosen One." Draco said. Ginny started to laugh as Harry hit his boyfriends arm.
"Bye Malfoy." Harry shook his head a little, feeling strangely happy with how the night had gone.
"Do you meet this girl of yours late at night?" Ron said. Harry pursed his lips.
"Are you gonna drag my grade down?" Harry tried not to blush. "I'm fairly certain that's why the Professor put us together." Draco said, looking away. "I'm the best in the class and you're the worst."
"Fine," Harry said automatically, thinking of the chaos of the Auror Department, and how it was best left alone. "Same old story."
"Yeah," Malfoy panted. "You can - you can do two, if you want."
Potter grunted softly and the speed increased noticeably. There were no words between them, just the sounds from their throats, of their bodies. Potter was pulling out further with every thrust and fucking him harder, deeper, faster. It was all building to something rather incredible, tendrils of it beginning to shoot out to every nerve ending in his body. Potter said something to him then, a question, and he barely heard it but his cock certainly understood and he nodded frantically, echoing it aloud and then Potter really fucked him. It was hard and at that speed, anyone else would have been desperately out of control, but Potter's rhythm didn't even falter. His hand was so tight around Draco's cock that he was nearly squeezing the life out of it, but no amount of grip would have been too tight just then. Draco heard himself gasping, like a fish out of water, and Potter's breath caught. His hips drove forward so far that his pelvic bones jammed into the backs of Draco's thighs and stayed for a long moment as he came. As the wetness spurted into Draco, he began to move again, strictly, Draco knew, for his benefit. Neither the fact nor the effect were lost on him; he was almost there and needed only a little more - Potter's fist was jerking him again, his cock nudging him from within, and then the heat was spreading through him like a wave, the first drops spattering out onto his stomach. Potter bent to swipe his tongue through it, slipping out of him. His tongue and hand together urged the last of it out.
Malfoy had waved him off. "Oh, sure. Go ahead," he'd said, handing Harry a warm, serviette-wrapped packet. "Do you like lamb?"
"Okay. Let's go."
The bread was stale and Harry guessed it would taste much better toasted. There was no coffee, but there was quite a bit of tea in the cupboards. Harry carried this meagre breakfast into the other room. Malfoy was sitting in a chair that faced the window, wand lying on the arm beside him, reading the paper. Or pretending to read. Harry chose a dusty armchair not far from him and sat down to eat his toast. Malfoy ignored him. Harry thought of the many, many occasions during which he had eaten in front of other people and thought with annoyance that he'd never managed to get as many crumbs on himself as he was currently doing, or made as much noise chewing. The only sign that Malfoy knew he was in the room was the tiny line that had appeared between his eyes. He was wearing the glasses again, Harry noticed, and otherwise tried not to notice him at all.
Getting the camels to stand upright was slightly more alarming than Harry had expected, but once they were up, he found that Draco was right. It wasn't all that hard at all. Their guides spoke to each other and ignored them, which suited them both. Draco pointed out various sites that he'd read about, told him about the ancient trade routes. It all felt so old, and it was very interesting.
"I'm sure you've endured worse," Malfoy said, rolling his eyes from the sounds of it, but when Harry looked, there was a half-smile there. "Now shut up and listen."
"No! I mean, I - he didn't say anything about that." Harry was flustered. Though it did explain certain cryptic comments Malfoy had made.
"Why are you being so nice?" Malfoy asked. The tension in his voice did nothing to help the knot in Harry's abdomen. "By all rights, you should hate me."
They went out into the sun and Harry let Draco bargain for the camel prices. There was no actual steering involved; just riding. The boys who kept the camels were their guides as well. Draco paid for two camels. Harry studied them. Though they were elaborately covered in wraps and blankets, it appeared that they were single-hump camels, dromedaries or some such thing. "Have you ever been on a camel before?" he asked Draco apprehensively, eyeing his mount.
Harry went to him. "You weren't, before," he said. Their mouths came together, Malfoy's tongue warm against his, and their ephemeral relationship, or whatever it was, felt like something tangible and solid and real, even if it wasn't, really. Harry was wearing an old t-shirt with his pyjama pants, but this time it was Malfoy who was already half undressed and clawing at his clothing. Harry reluctantly broke the kiss and kicked his pyjamas off, pulling the t-shirt over his head to drop on the floor.
"Sounds good. Edinburgh. I'll call you Richard tonight. You can call me Denise."
"I just can't really believe it. It seems too good to be true or something."
"Good morning, sir." Draco nodded at Moody as well.
"You were mine, too," Malfoy said, audible despite a small patch of static.
Their first year of training was coming to its final set of major assignments, and this quarter's were to focus on the areas in which they most needed improvement. The assignments were being given any moment now, and Harry couldn't help but catch some of Hermione's anticipation. He knew that his own area of weakness was likely to be found in group work. Their advisors had repeatedly told him that he needed to learn how to work in a team, in a partnership ("Aurors generally work in partnerships, Mr Potter, you know that"), that he needed to stop taking the lead and trying to do everything on his own.
"Oh, and not telling me you were in training - finished your training, whatever - wasn't a lie of omission?" Potter returned, colour staining his cheeks darkly.
Harry turned his face and smiled. "Hey, it's what I do, right? Come on, let's go back to the table. Where's Hermione?"
Harry did as he was told, pausing to look closely at Malfoy's arse first, the voice in the back of his head expressing doubt that he was actually about to put his fingers in someone's arse. Remembering what Malfoy's tongue had felt like there made it a little different, though. If it felt even half that good, he could understand why people did this. Slowly, he pushed a finger inside. Malfoy talked him through the others, and it was not all that traumatic after all. And then Harry was on his knees behind Malfoy, lining up their bodies, and he understood why this was important to Malfoy. It was a bit of a test: he had to know that Harry was really all right with blatantly knowing that he was with a man on purpose, doing something explicitly gay. It wasn't enough that he hadn't stopped fucking Malfoy when the glamours wore off: it had to be deliberate. And it had to happen before they could go on, to establish ground. With a soft exhalation, Harry pushed his cock in, watched it disappear into Malfoy's body, tightness and heat enveloping him, and as he heard his own sounds mingling with Malfoy's, something told him that it was never going to happen with Ginny. Not when he could be having this. A rush of emotion rose in his throat, choking him. He fucked Malfoy slowly and the emotion grew as he got closer and closer, feeling closer to Malfoy with every passing second. Malfoy's arms were trembling and when Harry reached around to grip his cock with lube-slick fingers, his elbows buckled for a second. Malfoy was telling him harder and faster and Oh God Harry, yes and Harry was hearing everything Malfoy had said to him over the past year, every clue that he'd felt like this, wanted this. When he came, the emotion welling around him was overwhelming. His body was slamming into Malfoy's, his heart pounding, and he made himself keep moving so that Malfoy could come, too. Malfoy's hand came up to join his, his fingers intertwining with Harry's, squeezing when he came.
Harry's attention was focused solely on Malfoy's words. "Did it work?"
Harry's palms grew instantly clammy and he hated himself for it. Why was he nervous? Malfoy wasn't talking about anything but friendship. (Did he wish it was more? Harry mentally dodged the question.) "Yeah."
Beside him, Harry lay awake for a long time, trying not to think unthinkable thoughts.
"How are any of those things unavailable?"
"I thought we were leaving the past where it was. And as Muggles, we didn't have a sixth year, we had sixth form, remember? I plan on introducing you as Harvey, by the way. I should be able to remember that." Malfoy strode ahead, his strides loping and loose, arms hanging by his sides.
"No, I said I would make supper," Harry said. "I just got distracted by the Hippogriff on the table."
Certainly a turn-off. "Time to change that, then," Draco said, and stopped trying not to rub himself against Potter. Potter didn't put up a fight. His breath came sharply, his body jerking forward into Draco's. It was going to happen quickly, that much was certain, but Draco was determined to enjoy it as much as humanly possible. The chances of getting Potter into this particular situation again were infinitesimal - Draco could already hear the stuttered explanations of how this was yet another mistake, how it should not have happened, could not happen again, moanings about his family, et cetera. He pushed it all aside and unbuttoned Potter's trousers with rough impatience. Potter appeared all too eager to help; his fingers were fumbling with Draco's, slowing things down, which shot another sharp spike of frustrated arousal through Draco, his cock throbbing against the seaming of his own trousers.
He revelled in Potter's discomfort. "The term is 'gay', Potter."
It could not happen again. That much was clear. But he was glad to have experienced attraction that strong, arousal that powerful, a climax that intense, at least once. Perhaps it was because of the link through the wands, but at the time, Harry had not been thinking of that at all. It was having rough hands on him, a cock sliding against him, Malfoy's eyes pinning him like a silver Basilisk stare to the wall - Harry dropped the potato he was attempting to peel manually and it rolled to the edge of the counter and onto the floor. Biting back a bit of profanity, Harry picked it up and put it in the compost bin under the sink, rinsed his hands and reached for another one. Albus sat behind him at the table, colouring. James was at the Weasleys, and Ginny had taken Lily for a walk in her stroller. The house was quiet. Too quiet.
"No, and no," Malfoy said, glancing at Harry's chest again. "Just some of Snape's old robes, and I imagine you don't want to wear those."
"When you didn't confirm my identity," Harry said quietly. "I haven't forgotten that, either."
"No!" Harry threw down the quill he'd been using harder than he'd meant to. "For the record, Malfoy thinks the same thing."
His turn? Oh, right. Harry got up and was naked within seconds. "There," he said, and went for Malfoy's cock again.
Harry had saved one promise in particular for the first night he spent with Malfoy in the new house. They had looked at flats, but none had five bedrooms, and five were needed in case all four kids were there at the same time. But tonight they were alone. Harry had poured wine and lit candles until Malfoy had drawled something to the effect of not having been warned of what a saccharine romantic Harry was turning out to be. Harry grinned and told him to take off his clothes. Malfoy did so slowly, in front of the fireplace, very much aware that Harry was trying not to steal glances at him while making his way around the room with the taper. He could have done that magically, too, but there were some things in life that were worth doing manually, after all. By the time Malfoy was nude, Harry's pulse was racing and he hurried through the last few and over to Malfoy.
"There was also that time you let slip to Neville that Luna liked him." Seamus said. Neville blushed red. Him and Luna had been dating now for the better part of the year. Everyone thought they made a really cute couple.
Harry furrows his eyebrows. "Just a few minutes, right?"
Twenty minutes later, after quite a bit of explanation and teaching, they had a pot of boiling water on the stove. Draco was leaning over, looking at it curiously.
I'm in the roots of your hair.
He rolled his eyes at the inner Draco in his mind and practically dove toward his suitcase. He ripped open the main zipper searching every crevice, every pocket he could see.
Harry's allowed to be himself. He can be in the middle between angelic and subhuman. He can be anything, as long as he's with Draco.
"Seriously Draco? I know you like me. You've liked me for a while haven't you?" Harry said. For the first time, Harry watched Draco blush red all the way to his ears. It was a good color on him.
"Are you okay?" Pansy asked.
2. I also love Harry with dark skin.
"Are we talking about the same Hermione?" Draco asked. Harry chuckled a little and nodded.
"For everyone." Luna said. "Draco included." Harry pursed his lips. "Do you remember how he abandoned his family once he realized you were alive?" Harry looked to Luna with surprise.
"This is our new normal. We have to all get used to being around one another." Harry said as Hermione greeted Blaise and Pansy maybe a bit too enthusiastically. Harry waved at the pair of Slytherins as they stepped into the room.
"Okay but you also know how traditional both she and him are. They're not going to accept me if I tell them about myself. They'll try to... I mean they just might..." Draco couldn't finish the sentences. He didn't even want to think about what his parents might do if he told them he's gay. They would lament about how they would never have a heir, how Draco had soiled their family name and if Draco could prolong their embarrassment of him, he would. He wasn't sure what eh would do if his parents stopped loving him.
Draco needed a long nap or some fucking fresh air or maybe just a good slap in the face
"Who is Penelope?" Harry said, cocking his head. Hermione huffed.
"Can I call you babe?" Harry said Draco's eye widened and he blushed hard which made Harry chuckle lightly. Draco swallowed hard and looked away.
"Yeah, it'll be fun." He leaned in to kiss Draco but he put his hand on his shoulder and stopped him from coming closer. Harry paused.
"Pansy won't dare leave his side though. How are we going to talk to him?" Hermione demanded.
"Yet?" Hermione whispered, looking pale in the face.
"You called me Harry." Draco's jaw clenched. "Also that's the first time you've yelled at me since we've been back here."
"You had a thing with Harris didn't you?" Blaise said. Draco sucked in a deep breath of air and his cheeks flared pink. Pansy looked almost aghast.
"Fuck the eggs!" Dean exclaimed, nearly knocking his entire plate onto the floor. "What in the bloody hell was that!"
"Oh I want kids. They probably just won't look like me or you for that matter if we adopt."
"When I was six I called my Aunt 'mum' once and she went ballistic." Draco snorted. "What?" Harry asked, watching Draco try to stifle his laugh with his hand.
"Get off me, you're heavy." Harry said even though Draco wasn't really putting any of his weight on him.
"I said you weren't on Tuesday and you still came." Draco said. "Why would it being a Thursday night stop you?" Harry grinned.
evacuate. Some of them stayed. Our Prefect Analise stayed. She
"I really hate you." Draco repeated.
"Yes." Pansy said firmly. Harry knew she wasn't messing with him right now. "And believe me, I was so shocked I nearly threw up but..." Pansy paused. "Draco wears his heart on his sleeve. It may not be obvious to you but it's obvious to me. That's why he's so... Why he's so fragile now. The stitching is coming undone, the stuffing is coming out and.."
. We're leaving." Harry said. Hermione looked shocked beyond belief. Pansy was still struggling to escape Blaise's grip.
" Draco groaned, lightly pushing back on Harry's shoulder. Harry gave him a quizzical look before slipping off of Draco's lap. Draco sat up, refusing to look at Harry
"You don't have to apologize. Nothings wrong with being angry." Harry said. "But I'm still going to talk to him and hangout with him. There's nothing wrong with getting to know him." Ron scoffed.
"I'll tell him. He probably won't say anything though." Harry said, stealing a glance across the dining hall. Draco was pushing his food around on his plate as Blaise and Pansy talked around him. Harry pursed his lips, wondering if he should abide by Draco's warning to not go to the tower tonight. Harry wasn't sure why but... Every time he talked to Draco he got this weird rush of adrenaline. It was that same rush he used to get when they would fight but somehow... This felt different. In a good way.
Draco deliberately unclenched his jaw, calmly clicked "delete" and read the rest of his mail. There was no point in answering; he hadn't answered any of the previous messages, either. The jab at him, vis-ŕ-vis Potter, was meant to sting. They'd never talked about that, though Blaise and Pansy's jeering looks had sometimes said far too much. The jab at Potter, however, was a blatant attempt to assert the sort of camaraderie they'd once shared, but it was far too late. Those days had been over since the day he'd chosen to be involved in the war and she'd chosen not to be. Not that he would have phrased it that plainly, but it had everything to do with it. Not because he was going fatalistic about it, but the fact was that it had been the single most important thing that had happened in either of their lives, and they hadn't lived through it together. It was a gap too great to bridge. In fact, it would be easier to talk to Potter, of all people, about the war than it would be to talk to Pansy about it. She hadn't fought. They had, even if on directly opposite sides.
Harry let the door close behind him on his way out.
She opened her mouth to protest, but closed it again at Potter's subtle shift in expression and looked at his hand. She shook it and smiled resignedly. "Thank you," she said. "You, too."
Malfoy was moving back toward the hall, probably to get his jacket. He went in pursuit. Malfoy was only a few paces ahead, his firm arse drawing Harry's complete attention as he walked down the short hallway to the coat stand. Now that the subject had been raised, it would be extremely hard to forget. Maybe impossible. Malfoy picked up Harry's suit jacket and turned, catching his gaze. Seeing Harry's expression, he smirked and didn't even say anything. He didn't have to. He came over and held out Harry's jacket and with it, another unspoken offer, his eyes rooting Harry in place on the carpeted floor.
"Are you going to do something with those potatoes, or are you just going to leave them there for me to do something with them?" Ginny asked.
Malfoy coughed. "Maybe we should talk about something else. That's a nice shirt you're wearing."
"I've seen the dynamics between you two," she said. "I wouldn't have said anything, but it's obvious now that you both know that things aren't going well."
"Well, maybe I haven't dealt with this, either," Malfoy said. His voice trembled unsteadily for a second, but he cleared his throat to cover it. "It's… a hell of a way to lose your virginity."
They were leaving the tube station now, Malfoy subtly guiding him through the crowd toward the exit they wanted. "It's not exactly my scene," Malfoy said. "But not a hard one to fake."
"Thanks," Harry said. He looked around. "So, what now?"
Harry imagined Malfoy doing just that, jerking himself off with one hand and pushing a finger into his hole with the other. It was an extremely appealing image. "I do," he said. "Or I have, now and then."
Malfoy made a sound that might have been a chuckle; it was hard to tell without seeing his face. "Come on, let's move." He turned and went to the entrance of the alley, and Harry noticed that as soon as he was in sunlight, the outline faded considerably. He would have no trouble spotting it in a crowd, however, unless Malfoy suddenly made a getaway. He followed him into the Leaky, slipping between people and was hurrying down Diagon Alley with Malfoy across the way. When they reached Gringotts, Malfoy came over and took Harry by the wrist. "Shh," he said warningly. "Remember, we are observing. That's all. This is what I do for a living. I'm not just a spy, I spy here. If you blow my cover, you will destroy everything I've built up in the last… few years. So do me a favour and hold off on any Gryffindor thoughtless exclamations or uncalled-for actions, all right?"
"It's Christmas next week. Won't you be in London?"
"Why?"
Malfoy must have been close already, because his fists tightened and he allowed himself to thrust just once into Harry's throat before regaining control of himself. "Potter - I'm - " he panted, and that was all there was time for. Harry got the message and pulled back, leaving just the tip of Malfoy's cock in his mouth and sucked hard, rubbing his tongue against the flooding slit, and then his mouth was filled as Malfoy came, gasping. Harry swallowed the bitter fluid hungrily, reflecting that it wasn't all that bad at all. He waited, prodding out the last of it with his tongue, and when Malfoy grew too sensitive, his cock twitched and Harry let it go.

"Me?" Draco was sharp. "Nothing!"
"I… well, I thought so," Malfoy said. "I was wondering why."
"May I just ask," Harry began politely, "how I'm to recognise you once we're at Gringotts, if this Disillusionment of yours is so powerful?"
* * *
"No, you're showering here, with me," Draco announced.
__________________
Draco sat. "If it's so nice, why did you take off before?" It was pointed and he knew it. Maybe this whole friendship deal was impossible after all. Maybe it wasn't possible for them to even be civil.
"No one's forgotten anything, Finnigan," Malfoy said, the same cool look on his face. "This has been in the works for years. And you're ten Galleons richer for it, so I wouldn't say anything if I were you."
Malfoy scowled at this. "Fuck you, Potter." He got up and headed for the door.
"It'll be better with two people."
Fuck the tube. "I'll be there as soon as I can find a place to Apparate!"
"Are you sad?" Albus asked, very quietly.
"Stop griping for once," Harry said mildly, and with that, summoned the nerve to take Malfoy's cock and put it into his mouth. Or the head, at least. Harry was a little surprised to find how little he could actually fit in there. He knew what he liked, though, and tried to reciprocate the way Malfoy had done it for him, lips covering his teeth, tongue working at the underside, tracing along the thick vein beneath. He tugged at Malfoy's balls, listening with satisfaction to Malfoy's gasp, cock twitching in Harry's mouth. It wasn't rocket science after all. He remembered to use his hands and gradually he was able to take it a little further in, establishing a rhythm based on Malfoy's restrained attempts to thrust into his mouth, and soon enough Malfoy was shaking and shooting into Harry's mouth, fingers clenched in Harry's hair.
"It looks like we're stuck here," he said, looking away. As though he blamed the fact solely on himself.
Harry hadn't expected to be right on that count. He opened his eyes in the dark. "What?"
"Hello," Malfoy said, and allowed her to kiss him on the cheek. "I see you survived the wilds of Edinburgh."
Draco had to grin. "You are completely ridiculous."
Malfoy's eyes were like lances, searching Harry's relentlessly. "You'd better not." He sounded as insecure as though he were sixteen again. "I can't promise that everything will be okay. But we will figure things out."
* * *
Malfoy was predictably even more withdrawn, his only exchanges with anyone typically contemptuous and brief, with the possible exception of Neville, who was just so harmless and well-intentioned that even Malfoy couldn't be nasty to him. They all slept in the bedroom upstairs. Three days had passed. They were all waiting for clearance to return to St. Mungo's, not that Harry particularly wanted to return to the melee there. If Malfoy hadn't been there, it might have almost been nice. The pantry had quite a bit of food, though nothing fresh. Someone had put some fresh bread in the house since Harry had last been there, but there certainly weren't any deliveries being made.
Potter just stared at him for a second, then gave a bark of surprised laughter. "Fuck that," he said succinctly. "I've been interested in you for years! I thought - never mind. Never mind what I thought, it doesn't matter. I want you. I like you. I thought this was going to end our friendship completely." He moved much closer to Draco, eager. "You're really interested in me?"
And so it went. They'd been given a time to come home, but their arrival was to be flanked with Aurors and Unspeakables in arms, as Harry put it, all watching to see if Harry's return would trigger anything for the Death Eaters. Draco was all for this, too. "I'm already with you all the time, and I hardly got you away in time for the last attack," he pointed out, when Harry complained. "I'm not risking it."
Today was just supposed to be about observing. Harry was to watch Malfoy watching over the goblins' shoulders, noting keyed-in passwords, touch-only access points, access that was limited by specific goblins' fingerprints or retinal scans, memorising codes and security points and account numbers. It promised to be dull and intricate work, but Harry was far from bored. Malfoy had done something to his feet that dulled his steps better than most things Harry knew, but even so, silence was crucial. Malfoy's outline was bending over a goblin seated on a stool, something that vaguely resembled a computer nearby, though the text rearranged itself as the goblin muttered throatily to himself, Galleons slipping through his fingers and piling themselves into stacks of twelve. Harry felt a touch on his arm tugging him back and then Malfoy's mouth was nearly on his ear.
"Harry, don't blame yourself for the bloody shit Voldemort did.
"Once or twice. We're partners in potions now. We kind of have to talk." Harry said.
"Is that supposed to make me feel sorry for you!" Ron spat back.
"Too bad." Draco said with a smirk. Harry rolled his eyes and took a half step back.
"Maybe later idiot. Right now I think we should head down to the Great Hall. They should be serving dinner soon." Harry glanced out the window of the tower to see how low the sun had set. He hadn't even noticed.
"Since when?" Harry said. Draco half chuckled and Harry felt slightly uncomfortable.
"And he didn't say anything?" Draco said. Harry rubbed the back of his neck.
"He just... Fixed it. He didn't reverse it. Do you even know what
"Well fuck Ron! I was kind of trying to fucking deal with the fact that the only guy I've ever loved
of this was your fault." Draco said, continuing to rub at Harry's cheeks to stop the tears from falling. "Oh come on Chosen one. You're not supposed to cry." Draco said, trying to smile. Harry laughed lightly.
"Who else has come out?" Ron said. Neville shrugged.
"He said that whatever bad blood between us basically... Is just water under the bridge." Ron scoffed.
it." Pansy said.
"All the Eighth years will be there. It will be like one big class reunion for us and hey... There'll be alcohol. I know how much you love Firewhiskey."
"Perhaps." Harry said. Draco snorted.
Harry and sometimes the feeling of hope is stronger than the feeling of loyalty." Harry said nothing and it made Draco uncomfortable. Harry slowly held his hand out to Draco. He arched an eyebrow at Harry confused before he realized what the Chosen One wanted. Harry wanted to shake Draco's hand. Draco's hand was warmer than Harry expected and it was also very soft. Meanwhile, Draco was off put by the scars on Harry's knuckles and how unnaturally cold his hand was in his own. Draco squeezed Harry's hand lightly as they shook hands.
"I think you established first year that you wanted nothing to do with me." Draco said with a scowl. Harry frowned. He did remember that but that was just twelve year old angst. None of that really mattered to Harry anymore.
"You two are happy. You don't need me. I don't want to be the cause of one or both of your deaths." Harry said. Hermione let out a small sob.
"Well, we should tell people." Harry said firmly.

"My point is Harry is that I was also the
"Nothing." Harry said at the same moment that Draco motioned for Harry to meet him by the doors. Harry glanced towards the front where all the teachers sat. Headmistress McGonagall was standing, eyeing the two boys curiously. Hagrid had even stopped eating, fork poised halfway between his plate and his open mouth.
"Oh don't take her side." Draco said with a scoff. "I liked it better when you were neutral about everything." Draco said with a shake of his head. Blaise smirked.
"Wouldn't you go too?" Luna said. "If your parents were crying and calling for you?" Neville looked away.
"Are you afraid of spiders." Harry said.
"Well we must go back and check. I volunteer you to be spider food." Draco said with a cheeky grin at Harry.
looking at you. I
"Generally, yes."
"You don't seem fine." Harry said.
"Babe, she never thought she would ever hear you say you were sorry. When she said she appreciated you apologizing, it was her saying that she forgives you. She's seen how much you've changed. She's told me so herself." Draco frowned, not believing him. "She apologized for punching you in the face didn't she?" Draco shrugged.
"I'm pretty sure I haven't been okay since fourth year Potter." Draco said.
"Uhhh..."
"What's with the dorky ass smile?" Hermione asked.
"I know... It's just difficult to remember sometimes because she's not here to say it." Harry said. Draco didn't know what to say so he just smiled and took the folded letter from Harry. What he really wanted to do was kiss Harry until the Chosen One felt better, ached a little less on the inside. Draco could just lean in and... "Tell your mom I said  Hi." Draco smiled before looking around the library. Nobody was nearby. He could at least do this. Draco took Harry's hand and kissed his knuckles. Harry looked stunned, blushing bright pink.
"He's lying." Draco said.
"I would rather be here with you but yes, I was heading somewhere." Harry leaned in quickly and kissed Draco much to his surprise. Draco was about to say goodbye but Harry spoke first. "Hey, I love you Draco." Draco froze instantly and Harry cringed as Draco took a step down away from him.
"Potions class. You know we're partners right?" Harry said. Hermione pursed her lips.
"Than what other reason can you fathom for this horrible pairing?" Draco said, sitting up and half glaring at Harry. Draco watched him run one hand through his hair. God did he ever use a comb? Did he know what a comb was? Not that Draco could really talk. As of late, he's kept his hair long and in his face.
"No you don't." Harry said. Draco rolled his eyes.
"Sort of your friend? I'm offended. We shook hands." Draco said. Harry chuckled.
"Is that one of those bottomless backpacks." Harry said. Draco half rolled his eyes.
"Put that away Potter. I'm not going to fight you." Hermione and Ron also had their wands out and Harry slowly realized that none of the Slytherins in front of them had theirs out. "We'll leave since that's clearly what you all want." Draco said. Ron's hands were shaking. "Pansy won't say it so I will. I'm sorry Ron, about your brother and about what she said. That was a horrible thing for her to say." Ron wouldn't look at Draco. He ground his teeth instead. Nobody said anything  else. Draco moved forward, towards the door. Harry stiffened, his grip on his wand tightening.
"Ponce!" Draco shouted at him.
"That's exactly what someone who has taken a love potion would say." Seamus said. "We need to get McGonagall to remove Draco's spell." Harry laughed.
"Well, it's not like he's wrong. We're notoriously bad people." Draco said. Harry could tell Draco was trying to lighten the mood, get him to laugh. It was sort of working. Harry smirked.
"The wizarding world will riot. It's fucking brilliant. Let's do it." Draco said.
"You're the one who jumped out of your seat the
"Ah right, I forgot how fuckin noble you are. Silly me." He grumbled. "If Voldemort had tried to kill me... I wouldn't bother coming back." Draco said. Harry swallowed hard.
"'Mione wants us over this weekend by the way." Harry said.
"Umm.. I told them I was going to be with you." Harry said. Draco stiffened slightly but they kept walking. "Well, I told them I'd be with the person I've been... Sneaking around with." Harry said with a shrug. "What about you? Where do Pansy and Blaise think you are?"
"I helped." Ron said from across the room.
"I... I didn't know." Harry said. He was breathing hard and Draco ground his teeth. He didn't like the way Harry was looking at him.
"If they had seen us..."
"My parents. Sirius. Cedric. Mad Eye. Hedwig. Dobby. Dumbledore. Remus. Fred." Harry choked out. Ron had looked away.
"Fine, Potter. Come to my room tonight." Draco said. Harry looked at Draco with evident surprise and Draco rolled his eyes. "Now look who is..."
"But I'm not a Pureblood! I'm a ruddy half-breed." She wailed.
"Shut up." Draco said.
"Do you not want to date? I thought that was the whole point of.... This." Harry said.
"I was surprised he didn't try to kill Pans..." Draco murmured. "If I was him I would have." Harry pursed his lips.
"Make me." Pansy hissed. From the corner of his eye, Harry finally watched Draco stand. Harry pulled out his wand. Draco didn't make a move for his own though. He simply stepped in between Pansy and Harry, his back to Harry. Harry stared at Draco's back confused.
"You're our friend Harry. Our best friend. Talk to us." Hermione said.
Harry was just about to throw on his invisibility cloak when Ron sat up in bed, scaring him half to death as he said, "Where are you going?"
I mean. Am I allowed up into the tower tonight?" Harry said.
"How? At least you and everyone else would stop bugging me about how messy it is." Harry said.
(See the end of the chapter for
. Voldemort is
"You're the one who kissed me." Draco said. "I was thoroughly against the idea of us."
"No you won't." Harry said with a laugh. "You love me too much."
"That good huh?" Harry said. Draco half shoved Harry away from him feeling like the blood in his veins was on fire. Draco always knew Harry made him feel like this but Draco just thought this feeling was anger not... The other thing. It's what he had thought for a long time before he sorted through his emotions a little.
"Oh but you do. Like I said, Draco's my best friend and..." Harry grabbed Pansy's hand and dragged her down a different, empty hallway and she yelped as Harry pulled her into a deserted classroom. "Don't get any funny ideas Potter! You're not going to convince me you're not shagging Draco if you try to kiss me!" Harry was stunned.
"That was.... Unexpected." Draco said lightly.
"Cedric is the reason that I'm not surprised that you're chasing di-" Ginny said before Ron put his hands over her mouth.
"I guess I'm not opposed to the idea I just don't know what you want from me Harry." Draco said.
"You looked way too happy to be discussing potions and I can't believe I just thought you looked happy talking to Draco of all people." Ginny said. Harry shrugged.
"Well let's hope nothing bad happens." Harry said, because knowing his luck, trouble is always right around the corner.
wrong." Ron hissed out. "What is it, tell us." He insisted.
"How'd you hear that?" Pansy said.
If ya'll don't like that... #Leave. I do really like all the actors that were cast for the movie though. But for the sake of this story, just a reminder that I'm imagining Harry and Hermione with dark skin and Harry with a large scar on his forehead.
"That's a relationship."
"Draco..."
"Wow, a compliment. Thanks Ron." Ginny said with a smirk. Harry smiled and Ginny winked at him. "I call dibs on hearing their name first though." Ginny said.
"Didn't you say you wanted to tell everyone about us?" Draco was smiling wickedly.
"But.. You dated Pansy."
"Yeah well... I feel like my hands are always shaking now." Harry said, closing his hands into fists over and over to try to steady himself. The blueberry flavored cigarette rolled around in his palm.
started... Kissing like a week ago Ron. We're not doing anything up in that tower other than talking, smoking..."
"I'm taking you back to the Gryffindor common room before you do something stupid." Hermione said. Ron pulled his arm out of her grasp though and faster than she or Harry could move, Ron had marched right over to the Slytherin's and was standing in front of them, glaring them down.
"It's... It's nothing." Harry said. "I just need some space sometimes."
"It is really hot that I'm dating someone smarter than me." Harry said.
"I'm your best friend. You don't have to lie to me." Ron said.
"What are you reading babe?" Harry asked. Draco's heart fluttered in his chest as he looked past his blonde hair at his stupidly good looking boyfriend.
"What?" Harry said, looking at his friends. Ginny was eyeing him funny, eyes half narrowed as she chewed on a bite of bread. Harry hadn't realized how wide his smile was.
"I'm fine." He said, slowly sitting up. Draco just stared at his boyfriend. Ex-boyfriend? It was the first thing Harry had said to him in over a week. Harry looked behind Draco at Hermione and Ron, surprised. Then he looked at Draco. "You brought them out here?"
"I didn't want Blaise to walk in." Harry said to Draco as they continued down the busy hallway together. People parted for them like they were diseased, everyone surprised to see the pair of them conversing, walking side by side.
"Oh my god will both of you shut up." Ron said. He was standing closer to them now with an expression that was a weird mix of anger and confusion. "What is this? Friendly banter?" Ron demanded. Draco shrugged.
"Someone is eventually going to see Potter, especially if you keep trying to kiss me in places that aren't our goddamn tower." Draco siad. Harry currently had Draco pinned up against one of the hallways that led to the eighth year floor for Slytherins and his heart fluttered when he heard Draco say
"No." He said pretty forcefully. Harry grinned.
"Sewing analogies, yes I get it." Harry interrupted. Pansy frowned at him.
"Yes." Draco's heart was running a mile a minute.
"Hey prat." Draco said, sitting next to Harry in the library.
"I'm glad you are." Harry said. "The Chosen one and his arch-nemesis deserve a happy ending after all right?" Draco laughed.
"Hestia. It's a pretty name." Draco nodded and as Blaise walked away, Pansy fell into the couch in a slump. It was very un-Pansy like and Draco would have asked her what was wrong but her posture told him to shove it. So Draco said nothing.
"You better not be talking about girls at all unless you're discussing me." Hermione said with a frown. Ron sighed.
"You." Draco said, wishing he had hesitated slightly. Harry chuckled.
"Yeah,
"For gods sake Harry I just want to fall asleep next to you you bastard." Draco said. Harry half smirked.
"God is this going to be a regular thing. I think I need to blind myself or become deaf." A voice said behind them. Draco half stiffened.
"H-harry..." Ron said.
"I don't think she knows." Harry said.
to you." Draco said.
But Draco knows that she didn't. Harry never even met his mother. Harry is eying him quizzically. Draco clears his throat. "Anyways, please leave."
"Someone wants their best friend to come with him to a party." Harry looked up at Ron and saw how serious was. With a sigh, Harry finally relented.
"It's a fuck yes, Draco." Harry said, kissing him. Draco smiled broadly.
"Ron, we're not defending what Pansy said. We all hate what she said too." Hermione said, touching his shoulder lightly. "But you can't just say... All Slytherins are bad because that's not true. It's not like... All Gryffindors are good or all Ravenclaws love school. Those are just stereotypes."
"This isn't simple. It's a cure for Dragon Pox. I've never even seen someone with Dragon Pox." Harry said with a frown.
"How are you not freaking out!" Harry snapped at him, stepping away from Draco as if he was diseased. Draco felt like he was about to cry.
"Wh-what do you mean? How could this
"I'm pretty sure if everyone knew I was gay, they would think I was into you." Draco murmured, burying his face in Harry's neck. God why did his hair smell so good? Harry grinned.
"Okay well... I'm good at keeping my own secrets." Harry said, pushing his food around on his plate.
Harry swallowed down his frustration. Malfoy knew exactly how useless it was, knew how likely it was that anyone good would ever find out what had become of them, and was afraid that Harry was about to point it out, and that would make everything untenable. With an effort, Harry put the remainder of his headache out of mind and for once deliberately removed the cynicism from his voice. "Sure," he said. "What did you have in mind?"
Malfoy agreed and they fell into step, walking away from the newer part of the city around Bab Touma, on the Northeast corner of the Old City. "Hungry?" Malfoy asked.
It was evidently the wrong thing to say. Potter's entire face suffused with colour. "I'm not gay!" he shouted, his fingernails white where they suddenly gripped the edge of the table. The dusty chandelier hanging between them shuddered, dust motes raining down over the wooden floor. Potter didn't seem to notice. More calmly, though through a clenched jaw, he went on. "It was a mistake. It shouldn't have happened."
"Al. That's enough," Harry said.
"I suppose I am," Harry said. "Although it's easier to be a good Auror if you actually know where the Death Eaters you're trying to apprehend are. We're having some trouble tracking people down, as you may know."
"Calm down." Pansy glared back. "I didn't say I wouldn't go."
"Thought you would like that."
Draco nodded, not trusting himself to speak, not even to say goodbye. He turned to Dumbledore and focused on the dark room he and Snape appeared to be in. Snape sat in an armchair that was made of green velvet and draped in gold material. The texture was not clear in the painting. Dumbledore was standing near the chair and there was nothing else in the frame. Draco concentrated on Dumbledore and the green velvet chair, gathered himself, turned on the spot, and vanished.
Potter grinned at him. "It's okay, it's not going to throw you out or anything. No magical qualities whatsoever."
"There's something else, too," Harry said. "We seem to have some sort of strange connection going on. Something magical, I mean."
Harry shrugged. It was wholly feigned, but he was not the Head of the Auror Department for nothing. "I'm not shocked. I just didn't know. Charlie Weasley is gay. I know gay people. It's not a big deal." Good, it sounded casual.
Malfoy turned on his side and put an arm over Harry's abdomen. "You were amazing."
The apartment was dark and did not smell like alcohol or vomit or potions. There was a faint trace of something slightly familiar, but Harry couldn't place it. It nudged at his memory like déja vù, but did not reveal itself. Harry didn't bother looking for a light switch. He'd spent years creeping around dark rooms and alleys and could almost feel his way better than see it by now. He wasn't sure what to do with Malfoy, though. "Where to?" he asked, trying not to look Malfoy in the eye, as his face was rather close to Harry's.
Harry was still trying to process everything Malfoy had just said. "I'm not tense."
"What? Noticed it?" Ginny was acrid. "Right. I believe that. Tell me another one, Harry."
* * *
The door leading from the library opened and Arthur Weasley and Kingsley Shacklebolt came through. The atmosphere stiffened. Harry sensed everyone shifting around him, probably gathering their thoughts and preparing their statements, he figured. Molly Weasley poured tea for both of them and passed them silently round the table. Arthur nodded his thanks, drew a deep breath, and began.
"You have three children," she said dryly. "I hardly think you're 'defective'. And I don't think that homosexuality is caused by trauma. It's just the way a person is."
Malfoy treated him to a smile that was full of Slytherin. "The safe house in Norfolk got pretty cold sometimes, what can I say?"
Potter looked at him with hollow eyes. "All right," he said. That was all, but he went with Draco to the tower without objection, or any further speech.
Harry frowned. "Who are you?" he asked, realising even as he said it that it was probably rude. It didn't matter.
"Dumbledore left it to me, Ron, and Hermione," Harry said. "How many times have I told you that? It wasn't my choosing."
Harry winced.
"I beg your pardon?" Snape's tone was a little more polite, but this did not appear to sit well.
There was a yawn and then a hand emerged, groping blindly for glasses. "No." Harry pushed himself up to an elbow. "Of course not."
"I want you to go over the weekend. Finish up whatever you're working on right now."
Malfoy didn't seem perturbed. "I'm sorry for asking, then," he said swiftly. "At least you have your kids, though. Do you miss them?"
"Good night." Where was the door handle? Oh, there - Draco got himself out of the car, closed the door hastily and hurried inside, cursing himself mightily. God, how awkward! He couldn't have done anything differently, though. If he'd stayed any longer, he would have lost his ability to suppress his urge to kiss Potter, touch him, tangle his fingers in that impossible hair. How ridiculous! But the urge was there nonetheless. Furious with himself, he gave himself a talking to about the qualification, his assignment, and crawled into bed to sleep off his humiliation, his cock hard, the blanket sliding over it like a whisper. He wrapped one hand around it and tried not to think of Potter, but it was far too late for that. He came mouthing Potter's name into his pillow, rutting against his mattress as though he was a teenager again. After, he lay still and pulled the blanket tight around himself and knew that if it had been that close this last time, it would only get worse from here on in.
"Shut up, Potter."
"A bit late for that," Harry retorted. "Everyone knows about our existence now." He mentally declined to include Malfoy in the "our" and hoped that his tone had conveyed that. He knew he was being unfriendly. That was just how they did things. And frankly, regardless of the size of the house, it was awkward living in the same space as Malfoy, especially now that the war was over. Harry had no idea how else he was supposed to interact with him.
Harry held his gaze for a long moment. "No," he said evenly.
They found seats and sat on their own, talking and drinking beer and making up people to talk about, which Harry found amusing. The first time Malfoy, his speech distinctly less precise and more slangy, started a line of conversation with something like, "That bloke who knocked up Colleen, you ever find out his name?", Harry was forced to rein in his laughter and make something up to go with the story. After a bit, Malfoy insisted that they mingle with the locals and they joined a game of darts. They were friendly but not inquisitive, and Harry found himself enjoying the evening.
Harry walked the five blocks from the tube to Malfoy's building, idly wondering what his clever new idea was. He was a little early, having overcompensated for the tube's normal lateness. He arrived to find a girl sitting on the bench under the canopy, legs crossed at the knee and reading a magazine. Harry leaned back against one of the canopy struts to wait, and tried not to stare. The girl was spectacular, he deduced from covert glances. She had long blond hair falling almost to her elbows and was wearing a simple, summery blue dress that fell just low enough to reveal an enticing eyeful. It stopped just past the knees, and a low-heeled sandal dangled from one foot. The dress matched the girl's eyes, which were light in colour. Blue, probably, or maybe grey. Grey - Harry had a sudden, shocked thought just as one of the eyes winked at him. Recognition flooded him belatedly; of course that was Malfoy's magical signature he felt.
Potter ignored him. "Can I come and stay?"
"I don't suppose I would, either," Malfoy said, but he got up and went to his robe from where it was lying on the floor.
She pouted and sank back down into the chair, but it wasn't a real pout. She had won, and they both knew it. Harry was amused. Ruffling her hair, he went to the bedroom. "Just this once, I won't leave my socks on the floor," he called back, by way of making up the wait to her.
"Just trying to be a good sidekick."
"So, what is it?" Ginny crossed her arms in front of herself and waited.
Malfoy's legs fell open and Harry collapsed onto him, both their chests heaving. Malfoy put both arms around Harry's neck, pulling him down. They kissed for a long time, panting into each other's mouths. It turned slow and languorous after a little, and was still intensely passionate. Harry had never known that it could be quite like this. There didn't seem to be a need to say anything. Harry didn't want to talk about logistics and specifics just yet. Not now.

"Ah," Harry said.
"Are you kidding? I'm surprised he knew what a USB port was." Harry rolled his eyes.
Potter spoke suddenly. "If you'd like to do me a favour, would you mind staying with him?" he asked.
Malfoy's arms were crossed over his chest, his expression both accusatory and annoyed. "Pansy told me that she was going to talk to you to see what you were thinking about what had happened. She told me that you said you weren't interested and that it was just a one-time thing that happened because we were both drunk and just happened to be there at the same time."
Draco was pacing up in the tower, wondering if Harry would still come tonight despite them sort of getting into a fight earlier today. It made Draco angry that he was thinking about Harry. Harry certainly wouldn't be thinking about him. The bastard was probably sound asleep in bed and didn't give two shits if... "Trying to burn a trench in the floor?" Harry said. Malfoy stopped abruptly and glanced over at Harry. He hoped his hands didn't shake as he pulled the cigarette out of his mouth.
3. I love the idea that Harry's scar is LARGE not the tiny little bolt that he has in the movies.
"Yeah, yeah I know." Harry murmured as they continued to kiss, pressed up against the stone.
"Draco's done something." Seamus said. "A love potion. A
"Could've fooled me. Anyways, have fun." Blaise said with a wink and a wave.
"Technically, he was always here." Luna said.
"Who says we don't?" Ron produced  a flask from his pocket. "I have a bottle stashed here in the room but I didn't want to show you because you drink that stuff faster than a catholic drinks wine at church." Harry snorted.
"Hey, you were the one who said I should beg for more if that's what I wanted Draco. Do you want me to get on my knees?" Draco tried not to imagine Harry on his knees in front of him. The image would have fucking
"I just... I mean I wish things had happened differently. I wish..." Harry didn't really know what he wished for. Ginny smiled at him sadly, touching his cheek lightly.
felt?
"I thought you kept better tabs on me than this Potter." Draco said. Harry's ears burned which could only mean he was blushing bright red. Harry hoped Draco couldn't tell in the dim lighting. Draco's eyes trailed back out the open window as he put the cigarette back to his lips. He put his head back on the stone wall behind him, one leg swinging lazily out in the open air. Harry wanted to tell him to stop, that he might fall but then he wondered why he would care about Draco falling. "Can I help you?" Draco asked, blowing smoke out the window before slowly shifting his gaze back to Harry who had been nervously shifting his weight around on the balls of his feet.
"God this is a bore." Ron said with a groan. The trio were currently sitting in the Gryffindor Common Room. Hermione was reading a book and Harry was sitting on the floor, doing some homework on the coffee table. Ron on the other hand was just watching them, bored out of his mind.
"Didn't seem important really." Blaise said before standing slowly. "Anyways, I have homework to do." He said, moving off slowly.
When voices could be heard down the hallway Draco ground his teeth.
"Ronald." Hermione hissed in a low voice. Harry tried not to cringe. It had been a week. An entire week of refusing to talk to Draco, refusing to read his magical notes. Harry had even convinced Professor Potswell that he and Draco shouldn't be potions partners anymore. Harry thinks she only made this change because Harry had broken down crying over it. It was the first time he had cried in a long time. Not even updates from Andromeda about Teddy could cheer him up. He was just... Sad.
"Really?" Harry nodded, licking his lips.
"We'll be right there." Ginny said with a small smile. Ron nodded and turned away from his sister and best friend, heading downstairs without them. When he left, Harry sighed heavily.
"I'm going to be late for class." He said simply, turning away from Harry and heading out of their Charms class.
"Yes, it was." Ginny said. Harry smiled at her. "But so long as Draco doesn't try to ruin our final year together at Hogwarts, then... He's alright in my books." Ginny put her head on Harry's shoulder and he sighed, comforted by her gesture.

"You knew it was us?" Harry said.
"If it's dreadful..." Harry said.
"Oh whatever." Pansy said, letting go of Harry and wiping at a stray tear under her eye. She breathed in deeply and smirked. There was the Pansy Harry knows. "Now, what the fuck did you do to him?" Pansy said, shoving his shoulder. Harry stumbled.
"It's fine."
strawberries." Draco said, pulling the cigarette pack out of the pocket of his robe. It was mostly full of strawberry cigarettes. Draco and Harry weren't particularly fond of that flavor and always smoked them once the other two were gone.
