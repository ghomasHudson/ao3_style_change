*If you have seen How I Met Your Mother, then it is kind of like the diamond suit Barney buys at Christmas.
“That isn’t the point, whether I liked her or not. She wasn’t a witch, Draco. Neither was his father. He has lived with his father until recently, and never spoken of his mother, so as far as I know, Jason is a mudblood. How could I possibly bring home a mudblood?” Blaise’s voice had raised to a certain level and the professor had heard them.
Harry made an agreeing hum as he looked around the giant glasshall. As he turned back to ask his boyfriend to go back to the table, he noticed Draco staring intensely at Pansy who was looking quite annoyed.
Then he felt it. Slowly and steadily, Draco pushed the head against his hole. Tension returned as his body tried to keep the cock from entering.
It was only for the past twenty-four hours he had surfaced the still sea and realized what he was about to do. A monster of terror was pressuring to erupt inside him, but he kept it down. It was too late now. He was getting married in a few hours and he couldn’t leave. No matter their differences, he wouldn’t cause Pansy such humiliation and leave her at the altar in front of all their friends and family.
Making out had been amazing every time, but Harry had gotten the feeling lately that Draco was ready for more. No matter how much he tried to leave it be, he knew for certainty that the blonde had already lost his virginity a long time ago, while Harry never really had the time to truly consider doing it with anyone, let alone someone he cared about.
“Thank you,” She smiled into his shoulder. Her curly hair tickled his chin and ear as she silently cried into his shirt.
The boys left the dying fire and settled down in the dorm room. Harry asked a house elf for new sheets on one of the beds next to Jason’s. When they had both used the bathroom and gotten into their pajamas, they sat on Harry’s temporary bed to talk a little while longer. They had started talking about what to come after their graduation.
Ron had believed him but kept bugging him about ‘what to do next’, what he had replied and if they should pick on Malfoy, next time they saw him. Harry didn’t really care. He knew Ron would never accept Malfoy as a friend and therefore until further, he would keep it quiet about his newfound friendship.
After all, the two of them hung on to Potter like leeches. Running back over the memory of him asking out Potter, it was actually rather surprising that he felt a tad nervous. It usually never took anything for him to ask out others, since most said yes or just straight out jumped him. But Potter was another case, as he always had been. He hadn’t realized he had been smiling notoriously before they had been interrupted by Snape.
want to see you?! You hurt me SO MUCH! For weeks if not months I cried for you to come back all the while hating myself for even wanting to forgive you! And while I tried to move on and not fall into a dark hole, what do I see?” Harry sneered.
The two boys hiding under the cloak were deadly silent as the sound of Remus’ footsteps lessened down the hall. Harry hadn’t really wished to spy on the two professors but Jason had seemed quite certain that this was the only way to get Snape to talk about his father.
“Yeah, we almost got convinced by Neville to get Professor McGonagall.” Seamus weighed in as Neville sent Harry an apologetic look.
The professor looked at him intensely. Finally placing his hands on the table in a thoughtful manner, he asked again.
Blaise had no idea how many minutes – it felt like hours – but he almost frightfully jumped when Fawkes moved to sit even closer to Jason’s face. It made Blaise quite uneasy to watch that huge beak next to his face but refrained from moving. Even though Dumbledore was an old cook, Blaise could admit he was powerful. If he believed the bird could save Jason, he would just have to wait and see.
“No, really. I hadn’t seen Remus in so long and even though it would be fine with just us, it was really nice to be the four of us instead.” He smiled sincerely.
A knock on the bathroom door alarmed him it was time to meet the others at the front entrance. Leaving the dorm room, his friends Michael, Astoria and Ethan stood waiting for him. Astoria was definitely wearing too much make up and not enough clothes but Jason was sure one of her girlfriends would inform her. Jason didn’t especially care what people wore, that was people’s own business. But, he cared that she would be freezing the second she came outside before complaining for an hour until he gave in and gave her his robe.
Harry patted him kindly on the back as they and the professors went to the headmaster’s office. The entire walk was deadly silent and Harry feared for his safety as a Hogwarts student. The only noise was Hagrid’s less manly sobbing and his very indiscreetly way of blowing his nose in a handkerchief the size of a small tablecloth. Inside the office, the guilty student and caretaker sat down. Although Hagrid’s chair had to be enlarged as the tree legs squeaked underneath his weight.  McGonnagall began yelling the second the door was closed.
Alone in the silence of his private quarters, the shock of days of almost losing his son, kicked in. His hands shook as he poured himself a double whiskey. Slowly he sat down in his favourite lounge chair and tried to empty his aching head for thoughts. During his service in the war, he had seen his fair share of horrors and tragedy, even lost people he had considered close, but this had painfully shaken him. Constantly being aware that he could lose his life at any given moment, left you without certain fears after the first few years, but never having imagined his son would reach so far in the progression of losing a mate, the news had been a shock.
“Ah!” Harry arms gave out and he fell down on the soft matrass. “Ah, Please!” Harry gasped in pleasure as only his hips was raised in the air.
“I do believe,” the headmaster whispered. “That Hagrid could use a friend right now.” Padding him gently on the back, Dumbledore sent him along towards the pair. Hagrid was gently stroking the dragon’s head while dapping his eyes with his enormous handkerchief.  “Good boy…”
Dean had yelled at him more than once to slow down, and before he could yell again, Seamus had slipped and sat with a rather hurt puppy look, as he got no kisses for his pain.
Eating his daily portion of oatmeal in peace was once again deemed too much to ask; Harry thought annoyed as the whispers around him continued as though he wasn’t even here. He smashed a strawberry in the bowl, trying to keep his very tired eyes from rolling.
“What? That I’m a mudblood?” Harry sneered mockingly. “Like my mother was? And my best friend? Should I feel lucky to have a little magical blood so that you even bother me with your grace?”
“Can’t understand how you can possible eat those.” Blaise wrinkled his nose as Jason tore into the bloodpops, quickly throwing two into his mouth.
“So, ‘you tired?” Dean asked while gentle running his hand through Seamus’ hair. The boy nodded sleepily. As they were about to get up, harry interrupted.
“Promise me you will not tell anyone. If the school board got any knowledge of my creature heritage, they would have enough ground to expel me.”
“Bullshit. Who would care?! It wouldn’t even matter! No matter what, I will have to take my exam with another examiner and everyone already knows you’re favoring your own house.” Jason interrupted. “Face it! You are ashamed of me! That’s it, isn’t it? You are ashamed to admit you might have a son whom isn’t completely human!”
Shrugging the blond changed the subject. “I know we haven’t exactly had plans to go together but I wanted to tell you now that I’m going to Hogsmeade with my friends next time.”
In the end, Harry settled for a few boys whom all possessed one or more qualities he deemed important in a relationship.
“Because he told us, Potter. He told everyone about the fact that you slept together. He told us about that stupid giraffe you gave him.”
“Sorry my friend, it seems like Potter is going to be your new partner.” Theodore gurgled. “See it from the positive side of things, it could be worse. Two second later out the door and you would have had to sleep with Longbottom.”
Jason nodded. “Yes, but not right now. I’m… not certain how well he would take it and even then, I just don’t know how to act around him. It’s just easier when he is my head of house.”
“Merlin, Harry I’m gonna shoot my load so far up in you.” Draco was clearly getting close and not wishing to finish without him, Draco grabbed his cock and used the lubed hand to jerk him off.
Draco forced himself to get up slowly and not dash for the door. He could feel the icy stare of narrow black eyes at the back of his head. He had almost reached freedom, landing his hand on the door handle, when once again Professor Snape stopped him.
The candy store was as always one of the most visited sites in Hogsmeade. People stood outside waiting for the others to leave so the line would move. Thankfully, the window display outside had been changed since the last excursion and instead of the giant Chinese figuring with beard and hair made of licorice was now a giant peppermint mountain with tiny little miners digging and transporting the white lumps. While they stood in line, a smaller group of miners had placed explosives on the left side, sending a small cloud of white smoke up and letting boulders down onto the window ceiling.
As he had almost left the warm castle, Draco stood waiting by the great hall. Seeing Harry, he smiled and waved him over. He wasn’t really busy so he went to see what the Slytherin wanted. Gathering some courage, Harry leaned in to give him a quick peck ‘hello’.
“Oh, what a shame.” The old man sighed, nearly pouting. “Well then, whatever biscuits you have.” He smiled and sent the elf on his way. Severus still hadn’t said a word but it didn’t stop the twinkling old man from converting.
Murmurs of agreement came from their friends and then everyone got back to their own plate. Harry shivered for what seemed like the hundredth time as he looked at the cold weather. He took a glance at his watch and it looked like he had enough time to grab a warmer sweater if he hurried. He summed up his plan to his friends before leaving the great hall.
Harry hurried to swing his bag over the shoulder, before following. He had to run slightly, to keep up with the professor. Snape didn’t tell him where they were going, but Harry almost figured that they were heading towards the potions classroom, considering it was his own first class.
“…Do you need help?” Harry awkwardly asked as it sounded like Hermione was having trouble with the dress.
“Mental, that one.” Draco muttered as they neared. Harry wasn’t in the mood to correct his behavior and let it slip for now.
“No, I want to.” Harry slowly started stroking to member, pulling the foreskin back and forth over the head. “I’m just not sure I can take… well all of it.” He blushed.
I really hope you’re still reading! I’m sorry if it was annoying how many times I went back in time but it seemed like the best way to describe the same moment from different characters.
“What is wrong with him?” Zabini silently wept as he sought out the Professor for an explanation. The professor simply shook his head and continued to stare at his son. Sniffling, Zabini leaned in and stroked the faltering brown hair.
“Hogwarts will miss your presence, but I am certain you will all do well, going into the real world and turning your focus and skills elsewhere. For everyone one of you; We at Hogwarts wish you congratulations and most of all, good luck.”
“What’s going on? Crabbe, Goyle! Get to class and save us some seats.” Malfoy’s voice boomed at them, coming from behind the trio.
“I know you don’t want to hear it, but Harry-“ Draco stared into his eyes. “I love you. I know what I did was unforgiveable. It still is, but I had to see you again, even if it was just to see a door slammed in my face. I had to tell you how sorry I am for hurting you.”
Ron whom had finished his mouthful casually asked the table what time they would be going for the dance, ‘since they would all be going down there together.’ As the group began to discuss the options of time, Harry remained quiet. He felt incredibly stupid as he hadn’t even thought of the fact that he would either be going with his friends at Gryffindor or his boyfriend and the rest of the Slytherin gang. Trying not to sound desperate, he hopefully suggested they could all go together.
“Well that is wonderful news. I’m happy to see the two houses interact beyond schoolwork.” The older man chuckled, grabbing another biscuit.
Listening at the door, it didn’t sound as though the class was in progress. He doubted for another second if he should be intruding. But then he knocked and it was too late for regrets.
At the first set of steps towards freedom, a female voice stopped him. Glancing back, he saw Pansy Parkinson hastily making her way towards him. Even though he didn’t have anything against the girl per say, she did give him an odd vibe. Especially since she and Draco seemed to be in constant glaring contest whenever they were together.
‘Wow, stop there, mother, never said I intended to marry him.’ The lucky feeling he gathered from believing his mother was on his side, disappeared as swiftly as it had come.
Malfoy. Potter had said ‘Malfoy’. Harry Potter had said his name. Out loud. Looking for proof of what could only be construed as a horrible joke, Draco looked into a blue pair of eyes from what was most certainly a dark bloodcurdling monster. Pansy looked like she had just hit the jackpot of the Ministry lottery. The toe-curling smirk on her face was enough to confirm Draco’s worst nightmare. Harry Potter was indeed his intended for this year’s bet.
Harry couldn’t help but take sadistic pleasure in seeing Ron squirm under the heated battle from a rather fierce boy and his rather strong boyfriend. But no matter how satisfying, they still had to get down to breakfast.
Giving him a rare smile, Blaise took his hand and soundlessly thanked him by stepping closer and leaning up to give him a peck on the lips. Jason felt the boy shivering slightly as he deepened the kiss. Not knowing wither it was from the kiss or the biting cold, he wrapped his arms around him and pressed them harder together. After -what to Jason felt like a too short time- Blaise pulled away but made up for it by lying his head on his shoulder and nuzzled closer under his chin.
Potter moved with him and continued to fold the gentle pressure on his knee as well as on his thigh now. If Potter continued to follow him so easily, Draco wouldn’t even have to do most of the work before Potter would be eating right out of his palms, he expected. Hopefully with his cock in between them.
The scenarios in his head played like a record as he imagined Draco telling his friends everything. Sitting with every Slytherin that bothered to listen, about how pathetic Potter had given him a second chance, what a loser he had been giving him any sort of gift for Christmas… what whorish noises he had wringed from virgin Potter…
Harry threw his bag next to his seat and sat down alone. As students began finding their places, the chairs around Harry’s desk slowly filled in. Neville ended up next to him and nervously tried to get his book and paper out, before Professor Snape could comment on his sloppiness. Harry just gave him a smile and returned to look at the front of the class.
As annoyed as he was, that Snape immediately thought he was the one to have stolen from him, Harry’s surprise at the information went beyond.
“Come on Draco, Malfoys don’t run away… it’s just a little party...” Wishing to pull his own hair out, he had to stop since he didn’t have time to put it back in a slick firm style. A knock on the door interrupted his meltdown.
Fearing to see the blond asshole again, Harry quickly nodded and went on his way. While he had no intention of going down to the dungeon, he did still feel guilty for not leading Snape down to his private quarters. After all, his son had just been on the edge of death and that would obviously take a toll on anyone. Professor Snape was without a doubt the greatest spy and therefor the greatest liar, Harry had ever known. ‘Perhaps he should send McGonagall down there?’ or better yet, Remus. Both men had lost plenty of friends and lovers along the way, and this would possibly be easier for Snape to confine in him instead of Harry. While the men still weren’t on the best terms, surely any company would benefit the professor.
“I know. He is eating everything I throw his way. He even started eating my chair when I didn’t come home quickly enough.” Hagrid laughed and showed him the leg on the only other chair in the hut. It was almost chewed in half and Harry wondered how it didn’t break under Hagrid’s weight. Actually, as he glanced around the room he realized a lot of things were broken. Splintered glass and wood laid around, some of the stones from the fireplace had been scratched out and the paint from the window ceiling was almost gone.
Although it worried him, Blaise was almost an adult in the eyes of the law and while Jason didn’t trust Malfoy further than he could hit his stupid face, Blaise cared for him. And although he hated to admit it to himself, he owed Malfoy for not getting him expelled. Or worst case, if anyone had investigated and found out what he was, getting him arrested.
“Why?” she demanded with narrowed eyes, looking directly into his. Harry could see why such a person would be in Slytherin. She wasn’t scared to stand up for her house. But still, he was three years older and basically towering up over her. Hating to do exploit himself as a bully, but hating even more having to answer her question, Harry invaded her personal space, looking down at her.
“No. Not now.” He turned back to his breakfast but didn’t even manage a single bite as the woman dug her nails even deeper.
“No, not really. A few of my father’s associates were there and god, the second they saw me standing there with a ‘doll’ they laughed. Teasing my father about me, my nurturing.”
Opening up, the Professor gave him a short look before backing up, waiting for him to enter. Nodding his thanks, Harry didn’t break the silence but hurried to sit down in the small couch in front of the fire. The small table in front of him held a tray with a kettle, milk and sugar.
Harry shouldn’t really have been surprised that Dumbledore already knew about his situation. He had always kept a close eye on him and more often than not, been able to hand out great advice. Although he had called his – well whatever it was – with Malfoy a ‘friendship’. And while Harry hadn’t labeled them, he was most certain friends didn’t make out whenever a chance became available.
“No, you didn’t, really.” Harry didn’t know what to say. Should he ask? “I just- I have never seen you. Together. And- it was the first time I ever saw two boys- anyway-it… didn’t make me uncomfortable.” Harry finished in a small voice continuing to fiddle with the hem of his robes.
Light enfolded the two boys in their passionate moment beside the roaming shadow in the doorway. Harry would have jumped back if it weren’t for Malfoy trapping him between his body and shelves behind.
“I know, but I wished to speak to you and you’re mad at me, so I wasn’t sure you would come if I asked.” Malfoy looked somewhere above Harry’s head.
“Don’t worry little brother,” The twins joined them at the door. “Harry’s got everything he needs, already.”
“Probably.” Jason fiddled with a loose end on his bandages. “But it was just easier from him. He is my head of house and it’s closer to the crypt.”
“Mist apologies, sir, but no such cakes in kitchen.” The house elf flattened his ear against his baldhead and his eyes became even bigger as he had to disappoint his only master. Even though the elves in the kitchen knew they had no true master, simply an employee, the elves continued to behave as if they abided the Headmaster’s every wish.
“I am, really.” Jason gave a teething smile. “I spoke to my father and my aunt. I’m staying here for Christmas.”
So last chapter was really emotional for me to write. Harry had to say goodbye to a dear friend and at the same time he actually believe he might finally be in love with Draco. So exciting!
“I do not know if Fawkes will do anything yet, Mr. Zabini. He is here of his own free will and I cannot force him to do any other.”
“I can almost guess for certainly that this student must be our new exchange student from Australia, Mr. Melck.”
The Potter whom he was apparently dating right now and had been to insecure to buy anything for. He should have. Not only because the annoying golden child had bought him one, but right now said boy was probably rather upset; looking for his own present from Draco.
Getting up and getting dressed, Harry hurried after his friends who were already heading for breakfast. Running down the stairs, he had barely managed to tighten his tie before catching up. Running a hand through the raven colored nest on his head, he tried to untangle a few locks. Getting to the hall the group of Gryffindors was interrupted by a rather loud yell from behind.
“She asked about you and why you guys hadn’t picked up where you left it. You know with Voldemort gone she figured…”
The concerned eyes watching him for signs of distress, finally broke him down. Tears gathered in the corner of his eyes, blurring his sight. Draco seeing this awkwardly pulled him close and pushed him away from preening eyes of the students.  Leaning against the strong broad chest of his boyfriend, Harry confessed to everything. Aodhan, the days they had hidden him, the chaos this morning… everything.  Through it all, Harry didn’t look up but simply cried into his warm shoulder, silently thanking Draco for holding him. For a minute, he feared he might have fallen to the ground if the strong arms around him weren’t. When he had finished speaking, his mouth felt like a dessert. The sobs retreated and in the end, he gently sniffled, trying to keep any snot of his boyfriend’s shirt.
“We are very different people, he and I. I’m just not certain how great it would go. I mean as long as we’re speaking about lighter topics, like Quidditch, everything is fine, but we can’t exactly avoid how different our opinions are, right?”
“Harry.” Remus sighed. “You know Professor Snape wouldn’t appreciate you meddling in his private affairs.”
Reality hit him on the head, harder than any smasher could and he moved his head away from the taller teen.
This time Jason Melck is going to be our main character. We will see the trip to Hogsmeade in last chapter, from his view.
want?!” Harry finally snapped and got up on his feet, nearly kneeing Draco in the face. “That is right, what
Although by the looks of it, Hagrid was on his way out. He was still putting on his giant fluffy mittens as he spoke.
Smirking, the blond boy started kissing down his neck. The desperate need to feel him was getting to him and he sucked hard enough to leave a bruise. Harry hissed in a mix of pleasure and pain as Draco moved further down over his chest. Draco flicked a pink nipple and watched it harden underneath his gaze. Tweaking them both at the same time, Draco listened to the moans dropping from the innocent lips of his boyfriend.
At last, the pleasure exploded and his legs buckled uncontrollably as he ran through the high. Draco franticly continued to grind against him a few more times before he too fell breathlessly against Harry. Trying to gain their breath, Harry gently started kissing him once again. It seemed different to kiss after one had sought gratification, he noticed. While it had been rough and pleasurable, it now seemed… wholesome.
Freeing himself, Draco grinded up against the perfectly globed ass and gathered whatever leftover lube he could. He didn’t wish to hurt Harry, and if he asked him to stop, he would, but deepdown Draco hoped he was able to get in without too much preparation.
The incredibly blunt question was quickly regretted, as he watched the book fall from Blaise’s hands.
“Yeah, right. Draco just told me too.” He desperately wished to would stop fidgeting and crossed his arms. “He’s… not taking it so well.”
“No, it doesn’t make sense. You’re lying.” He whispered. She had to be. But then why, wouldn’t his heart stop pumping so hard?
For the rest of the class, she sat silently beside him and thankfully, let Draco concentrate. As the class ended, he gathered his things but threw out the piece of parchment which literally only had three sentences. As he left with the rest of the students, Melck showed up beside him in the hall.
Smiling, Harry carefully took the slytherin’s hand, almost fearful he would avoid the public affection. Without commenting it, Draco grabbed his hand firmly and gave a gentle squeeze.
Shit. “Nothing, sorry I was thinking of something else.” Harry hurried to move on but it was obvious Snape had caught the end of something big as his eyes narrowed. Getting up slowly from his own chair, he went around the desk.
“Oh, ermh, you just seem really tense around each other and more so than last time you worked here.”
“So what did you want to say?” Harry wondered. Trying his best not to sound eager. Malfoy still hadn’t removed his hand.
“Harry.”  Looking behind him, the group of wizards were ready to interfere. One of the men stepped forward and Aodhan started growling in displeasure.
“No,” Draco shook his head in denial. “It was the greatest present I’ve gotten in years.” Leaning in he kissed Harry gently on the lips once more before letting go all together.
“Do you mind if we try?” He pleaded. “I think it will be good for both of them to talk again. They are clearly avoiding each other.”
No, it actually hadn’t occurred to him. He had been so obsessed with making Draco seem like a good person to his friends. A person whom had changed… the idea had never even struck him. No, okay so Draco might have spoken a little too loudly about their relation but it didn’t mean he had done it out of spite.
“Death is part of life. Unfortunately, it greets some quicker than others.” He discreetly wiped his eyes with the white cotton sleeve of his pajamas. “I always thought it was exaggerated, when people in movies or books said they missed their loved ones every day, but it’s true… every single day. I recognize a smell that would take me back home. Listens to a song or a joke he would have liked. Every single day something reminds me the pain of losing and the love of having known him.”
“Hey, it’s fine, really. It feels good.” Seeing the praise gave his boyfriend slightly more confidence he lied back down. “Just try to cover your teeth with your lips. Yeah, like that.” As Harry tried without the member in his mouth. This time minding the teeth, he pulled the member back in his mouth. He tried sucking on it as he went further and further down, the hand in his hair stroking him encouragingly along.
“He would have found out somehow.” Draco whispered as he took her hand, stopping her from ruining more of her bouquet. Squeezing it gently, she gave him a wet smile and simply sat together. Each crying for the future they would never have.
“No, it just… you’re crazy, okay?! Draco loves me. I’m sorry he doesn’t want to marry you, but this is just out of line-“
This chapter is going to be slightly different. So far, we have had POV from Harry, Draco and sometimes Severus.
Harry could only nod as his hand settled over the egg, secretly hoping for it to kick against him again. In the half hour, he spent at Hagrid’s he only felt the dragon kick that once, But Hagrid promised him he could come back soon, as the activity only would increase over time as the fetus developed.
“All right then!” Jason gave a blinding teething smile. He took out his wand before flicking it quickly right through the group. Between them, in the snow, was an enormously long line almost crossing half the pitch in the middle.
Trying to shrug it off, Draco left for his own first class of the day. Transfiguration wasn’t exactly going to be exciting. Entering the class as one of the last ones, he chose the first seat available between his housemates, next to Knott. The Hufflepuffs had brigaded the front of the class, probably fearing Professor McGonagall couldn’t rescue them if they were sitting in between the snakes.
Sighing, Remus continued. “No. Unfortunately, I can’t blame that on anyone but myself. You might remember that the Marauders and I would stay in the forest while I was under my transformation. I would never remember the time we spent in the forest, since the Wolfsbane hadn’t been invented yet. Then one night, something happened…”
“Potter, while you may wish not to listen to me about the nature of Slytherins, you must listen to me when I tell you; I know my godson.”
“Well based on the dark red color, which is remarkably like blood even though the actual potion do not contain it, the slight smell of roses which can confuse the victim of the poison… oh, and you wrote it had to be stored in crystal flasks.” Zabini observed.
Outside in the frosty air, Harry scooted closer to the taller boy, trying to keep from freezing. A hand snuck around him and laid gently on his hip as they went towards Hagrid’s cabin, in silence. As they approached, the hut they saw Remus, McGonagall, Snape and the headmaster standing a few feet away, while Hagrid stood beside his curious friend. The professors seemed at unease standing so close to a magical creature without their wands ready. Dumbledore on the other hand seemed to be spellbound by the crimson flowers shining under the moonlight, never even bothered by the fact that his back was turned to the dragon.
Laughing, Jason explained. “No, no, god no, he supplies me. I just have to go see him once in a while and have a cup- maybe two- and then I’m fine. Kind of like a blood bank.”
“NO, eccentric.” Harry stared at him harshly, daring Draco to defy him. The blond just raised his eyebrows in defeat and went back to drinking.
Harry smiled. “Yes, very much,” blushing slightly, he looked into his cup. “In fact, I… I think I love him.”
“No reason.” He shrugged. “I just haven’t been talking to him besides in class. ‘Don’t really know him.”
“There isn’t much to tell. We talked and I lost control. No matter what, I am simply glad I wasn’t expelled.” He sighed.
“Yes.” He nodded and gave Harry a gentle smile. “I sometimes forget not everyone is interested in money as much as I am. And I’m sorry too. I didn’t mean to indicate you couldn’t buy something for yourself. I know the Potter line was rather wealthy.”
An entire two weeks had gone by and each day, Severus stepped inside the little pastry shop ‘Partly cakes’. For some horrible reason, he felt obligated to come back each day from the way Lauris smiled at him every time he came by.
After that, they didn’t bring up Malfoy again, but continued to discuss the egg’s progress and how Hagrid’s other ‘pets’ were doing. When they finally finished their tea, the sun had set and Hagrid believed it was best for him to be escorted back to the castle.
Smiling sadly, Harry had to admit it sounded quite wonderful. To capture the perfect moment. But how on earth did you do that? Or how did you know it was the right moment and not the next one? Damn.
Harry couldn’t really decide if he liked the boy or not. While he seemed down to earth and gentleman-like, he also kind of upset Harry with all this idle gossip.
“Just promise!” She raised her voice. “If any of the Slytherins found out I would be called a traitor…”
Most of his life Draco had doubted his father true love for his mother and him. It had always appeared as though their image and respect for tradition had had bigger value than their own lives. Now that he was older, Draco could see how much his father had moved since his own upbringing. Draco would never become like the normal wizarding family – Merlin forbid like the Weasels – but he was determined to love his family when the day came and never let his son or daughter feel the doubt that he himself had had to deal with for so long. He would keep their traditions and their dignity in society but at home, they would be treated as family should.
“Why does it even matter?” Dean finally interrupted. “You are going to be wearing your robe anyway, it’s freezing outside.”
Turning his head and seeing Jason up close for the first time in weeks gave Harry quite a startle. The pale boy looked sick as his eyes were bulging and blend. He looked incredibly tired and almost seemed to sway as he stood beside Gryffindors.
The entire way down, Harry was aware of how hard his heart was beating. He could hear the drumming in his ears. The reason was unclear. It was probably the constant fear of getting caught out of bed, after curfew. It felt unnatural to walk around the castle at night without his cloak. Discreetly glancing at Malfoy beside him, Harry didn’t see the least sign of unease. Perhaps it was more common for the Slytherin to walk these halls, than Harry thought.
The scrapping sounds of chairs against the floor woke Draco up from daydreaming. People were heading out and as he turned his head to the back of the class, he got eye contact with Potter. The boy gave him a careful smile, just a small lift at the corner of his mouth so no one would take notice. Smirking, Draco sent him a wink and Potter blushed.
Lupin looked as if he had just slipped him poison. It took a while before the wolf had gathered himself enough to answer. After a deep breath, he whispered to his own feet.
Draco made an acknowledging sound and continued to ram his prostate with a perfect curled finger. Harry continued to trash on the bed, holding the silky covers tightly in his fists.
But when the teen had confronted him in the library, Blaise realized how wrongly he had treated him. Blaise truly hadn’t meant it to hurt him. Honestly, it was just the way he was. But merlin, how much he regretted it now.
“No, I swear!” Jason reached for another cookie. “One of the first school rules we had was ‘No dragons allowed.’”
That night Harry slept awfully. He kept flooding in and out of the weirdest dreams. In some Jason and Draco had run away together. Some were just filled with odd occurrences such as Dumbledore dancing rumba while Hagrid and Aodhan shared a tea party in frilly dresses. After waking up three times during the night, someone finally shook him awake.
“I just wanted to apologies. For, you know, telling people about… your preference.” She practically grimaced. Harry could feel the resentment in him grow. She couldn’t even talk about it without looking like she eat something sour.
“So much! Please, please, Draco. Fuck me! Now!” he pushed a hand back fumblingly trying to grab the cock and push it in, himself.
Waving goodbye to Ron and Neville, he went down the staircase and headed for the entrance hall. As the staircase started moving under his feet, Harry realized he was the only one not going upstairs to head for the Gryffindor tower or the library. As the staircases didn’t exactly move fast, Harry spent the time watching the paintings entertain each other. Most of them only moved a little as they discussed over a dinner or studied at a desk. A pair of young girls giggled and waved at him from a blooming yard. Even though it was possible, the paintings actually rarely jumped into each other’s frames. Harry couldn’t imagine being stuck like that at the same place for all eternity. But perhaps it was because death never frightened him, so becoming immortal sounded more like a punishment. As his eyes glanced around, simply watching the painted wizards turn to the animal section, he finally settled on watching a beautiful glory white unicorn slowly sipping water from a stream.
In the end, Harry barely pulled his own finger out of his mouth before coming on the stone wall. Panting, he watched his come washing down the showerdrain, and got out of the shower. Drying off, he silently went back to the dorm and his head had barely hit the pillow before he drifted off.
Shaking as he tried to collect himself, the boy who lived nearly flew up from the chair when a gentle hand landed on his head. Closing his eyes, he found comfort in the soothing hand gently carding through his hair. He gave up trying to fight the tears and for once let himself be consoled by an adult. The hand on his head carefully guided his head to rest on a warm stomach and Harry entangled his fist in the black robe, weeping quietly.
“Yeah and I appreciate it. But I just realized in that moment how difficult it would be for us, erhm to be seen together.. as friends.” Harry explained awkwardly.
Turning back to the concerned couple, he decided just to tell the truth. Keeping his head high he quickly told them what they wanted.
Back in his own quarters, Severus still felt miserable and tired. He had poured himself a double scotch into a crystal glass and was slowly sipping the horrible drink. Normally he loved a good scotch but since he had been on a teacher’s salary and Lucius and him were barely speaking anymore, he hadn’t really been drinking from the good life for long.
Everyone seemed frozen. The two gorillas seemed surprised as well but didn’t dare to question their leader. Giving them one last glare, they turned around and went down the crypt. Malfoy had actually defended them. This was seriously disturbing.
The rest of the day went by quickly. After visiting Hagrid, he only had two more classes and then the Gryffindor gang spent the rest of the afternoon hanging out in the common room. Even though Harry loved spending time with his friends he felt completely exhausted. He would actually rather have gone to bed than having dinner, but Hermione didn’t look overly pleased by his idea.
After all, no matter what Dumbledore said, the reporters always found a way inside or even sometimes bribed students into taking pictures for them.
Back in the common room he expected to be alone at this time but apparently his so-called friends had decided to wait up for him.  Knott saw him fist and let down the giant book he was holding.
Yes, everything did truly seem harmonic. Harry was adoringly in love with him, classes were going great – therefor the exams would be easy- and he had won the bet. True, he did feel slightly bad whenever some of the Slytherin brought up the subject and yes, something tore into his stomach every time Harry mentioned their first few dates, but it didn’t matter anymore; The guilt would surely end at some point.
“Yes. Now come, there are some people I want to introduce you to.” Laying a light hand on his lower back, Draco led him to other tables across the room where multiple girls were dressed in emerald green. Harry ironically imagined what house they were possibly from. But these were Draco friends and he quickly put on a smile he remembered Hermione had said was charming.
An anger unlike any that evening rose inside of him at the unasked parenting advice. Who was the wolf to inform or lecture him on anything remotely close to parenting? He, who in his own way had abandoned his friends’ child and-
Enchanted snow was falling from the ceiling and spreading out across the Great Hall at breakfast. Harry was sitting and trying his best not to fall back to sleep. Yawning for what seemed like the hundredth time, he grabbed the nearest pot of coffee, pouring it up to the rime of the cup.
This was a short chapter with a lot of change of scenery. But I really loved writing this one. I’m almost giggling with glee, knowing the dragon has hatched. I’m guessing we are going to see him a lot more from now one, but who knows? I shouldn’t but I always change my mind when I’m writing.
“Ron, please calm down-“ Hermione quickly leapt forward hoping to stop the ginger from exposing them in front of everyone. Harry felt his blood freeze the moment he saw his best friend. He knew that Ron wasn’t going to yell at him in front of everyone. Hopefully.
Esben shook his head. “Only her mother. My mother spoke to her out of sheer willpower. She was… a rather eccentric woman when it came to her daughters. Always bragging…”
“What is it girl?” Harry tried to feed her a small piece of egg but Hedwig simply bit his finger in irritation, making him drop the piece of food.
“Wow. That… damn-“ Chuckling he fell to the side as to not completely crush his lover. Smiling broadly, he pulled the smaller boy against his own heaving chest and they simply stayed like that for minutes. Quickly and gently kissing each other around the face. Harry could only smile in pure bliss as Draco kissed his forehead and eyelids. While the heavy breathing was kind of soothing, Harry felt kind of cold as the sweat on their warm bodies were getting chilled. Draco quickly got halfway up and tucked the blanket out from underneath them, before lying back down.
“I haven’t been apart from Blaise since the beginning of the term. Going from that to not seeing each other for days isn’t going to be easy. I actually fear how I will react. I apologies beforehand if I seem a tad irritated or edgy over the next week.”
“Okay what were-“ Harry didn’t get a chance to finish the sentence because the Slytherin weren’t in the mood to a long chat anymore. Pushing the boy up against the stall, Draco quickly moved in to kiss him. Harry panted in surprise as Draco forced his mouth open and pushed his tongue against his. For a few seconds, Harry seemed to retaliate but the blond wasn’t letting him. A hand pushed against his chest and Draco regrettably moved back.
“Your parents? I mean, It won’t… but we will figure it out, you know? We take one day at a time. Besides, if anything your parents were Gryffindors right? Wouldn’t they be happy if you are happy?”
Apparently, today was an extra special day. Severus had barely gotten to the crypt entrance before stumbling into Potter and Draco. Standing a bit close for the usual enemies, Severus tried to analyze the situation. Neither boy looked angry or hurt so perhaps Severus could avoid the inevitable.
It didn’t really seem to be in Hagrid’s favor but being the kind person he was, he obviously didn’t want to disagree with another teacher in front of the students. He didn’t say anything except wave Jason towards himself and Harry. As Harry stood in front of the class he discreetly sought out Malfoy, and by the looks of it, Pansy was digging her rather long nails into his arm to keep him quiet. Jason gave him a smirk and joined his side. Hagrid kept calling people forth, until everyone had been teamed up. The lecture continued for a while as Hagrid prepared them for the unicorns’ antics and how to approach the animal.
“Look at the front.” He said slowly, discreetly pointing at the paper in his hand. The sinking feeling spread in his stomach like acid as he turned it over. And truly it was a sight to behold. Had anyone shown it to him a few months ago he would have burned it and claimed to be possessed.
Turning back to the class front, Draco regarded the blackboard with a very small matter of interest, trying to figure out where the spell was written. Looking across the blackboard his gaze happened to linger on the back of a tousled black haired head. As the goddess of luck smiled upon Draco today, the boy happened to turn around for whatever reason he had. Their eyes met and here was his chance.
“Draco would like it if you didn’t discuss his life as if he wasn’t here.” Draco sneered, trying to push the woman off him at the same time.
Looking to the back of the group, Harry could skim the blond hair sticking up between heads. As the students started to walk forward, Harry stayed back.
How badly Harry wanted to play it cool and give of a sarcastic remark. But as fate would have given him delicate senses, his pumping pulse indicated the blossoming red patched across his cheeks.
“I mean, there is just an expectation of us going together, since… everything that has happened, even though were just, you know, casual and stuff.” The Slytherin laughed awkwardly. What. The. Hell?
Back at the Gryffindor tower, a young man was having the hardest time picking out his clothes. There wasn’t much to begin with, but shirts and pants had been scattered all over his bed as well as two of his friends who were rather amused by all the commotion.
Carefully, he snuck back into the dorm and shed his clothes. Laying down in the cloud-soft bed, Harry thought about tonight’s event. Even though it had only been a couple of hours since dinner, he felt as if he had been away for days. He saw an entire new side of Malfoy tonight. THE Draco Malfoy had actually decided to change. He wasn’t sure if it would be noticeable at first, but he was sure Malfoy could do it if he really meant what he said.
“No, Professor Snape and I simply talked for a minute longer, then he stormed off.” Remus explained. Harry would have to ask at some point how he had acquired such deep tissue scars, but for now, he would let it go. It was after all Remus’ story to tell.
His friends looked rather perplexed and seeing Ron was ready to jump to conclusion, Harry hurried and reassured them to go ahead and get to class. They didn’t looked very comforted but slowly turned and went onward.
“No, it’s okay! It’ll be out soon.” Thankfully, it was one of the few times he had been right, and in the end only smoke and burned down wood remained. As they watched the small cabin turn to kindling, Harry stroked the dragon’s had soothingly.
Over the last couple of days, he had cried who knew how many times, begged, yelled in anger that Json was a coward for giving up this easily. He would yell until either his throat dried out or Madam Pomphrey would stop him.
“You must realize soon that I cannot keep protecting you.” Severus chastised and started pacing. “You have already proved yourself capable of deliberately hurting another student violently-“
First after the giant door had slammed shut behind her, Draco took a shaken breath. It was already a troubling day and he had just finished breakfast. Stirring a hand through his hair, Draco desperately whished for a drink. Or even perhaps one of his father’s imported cigars. In time, things would be back to normal. Pansy needed time to face it, but they had plenty. Their graduation was just around the corner. A few exams and then they were off into the real world. Draco still wasn’t completely sure about working in the ministry but it would surely be better than anything he would find outside of England.
It took a few seconds before Harry realized Snape was waiting for him to answer. The thought of speaking about his godfather, and especially with Snape, gave him a big lump in the throat. Coughing a bit, Harry found his voice.
The next day had seemed to go by incredibly fast. Breakfast, classes and their fifteen-minute break almost molded, and then after Divination, someone caught Harry unexpectedly. Coming down from the tall ladder, Harry tried to follow his friends when a stiff hand landed on his shoulder.
“Oh, merlin beard…” Hagrid mumbled. The two stood completely frozen as they waited for the Professors to join them.
The students in the hall roared and whistled as Harry tried not to hide himself underneath the table. More than a few got up on their feet to congratulate him. Looking up at the podium, Dumbledore was smiling at him and proudly clapping his wrinkled hands together. The teachers behind him joined as they rejoiced the wonderful fall of the dark lord. Harry was sure he even saw Professor McGonagall wipe away a tear.
Harry couldn’t help but be annoyed as Ron stood beside him, reciting every way to difference a curse from a hex. Harry simply tried to relax. While his skills in the written exam had always lacked, the practical exam was his domain.
He tried to focus on the sweetness and endearment of the kiss, rather than the tiny painful poking in his stomach and chest at the thought of Blaise not wanting to return the gesture. Their kiss continued as Jason locked his hands underneath his back, clinging to his body.
The old man smoothed down his long white beard, the deep wrinkles on his forehead furthering, as he was lost in thoughts.
Outside his room, he carefully went passed the hall where everyone had gathered already. He would hopefully be able to sneak out the backdoor of the hotel, where the staff entered. Looking back one last time he saw both their parents, toasting to their future.
Trying not to glare at him, Harry hurried to the empty seat and sat down. Of course, he should have realized that his golden luck would have led him to Slytherin territory. The seat beside Zabini, Malfoy and Jason had been the only available one. Even though Harry was fairly certain Jason only had sat down there to be close to Zabini. From the looks of it, Zabini wasn’t very pleased with the turn out.
Remus looked rather tired from the full moon’s last approach but was smiling none the less. He shook Harry’s hand and clasped the other one on top.
A cough from behind almost frightened him to death. Turning around, his godfather stood in his formal robe – looking almost identical from every day.
“I believe Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy has spent quite enough time together.” Snape calmly stated. Although it was obviously more of a demand than a suggestion. Half the student body jumped in shock, as they had not even realized Snape was there. Looking between the startled face of Hagrid and the raised eyebrow from Snape made Harry incredible uncomfortable and seeing the faces around him, he wasn’t the only one.
“What’s going on?” Hermione worriedly laid her soft hand on his shoulder. For the first time, he finally met her gaze. Her almond brown eyes tore him apart and he tried to take a calming breath. A huge lump in his throat started to hurt and he tried to tell her it was fine. How everything was fine.
“Enough nonsense, Dumbledore.” Lucius raised his voice. “I will give you exactly one day to expel the crazy boy who almost killed my son!”
“No. he just followed me up here because we were heading the same way.” Harry explained. “And he never shows too much emotion when others are around, so if you could keep it to yourself that we were walking together…?”
Releasing a shaky breath, Harry refused to cry once more. He nodded and quietly explained what had happened. How Malfoy had tricked him, used him for his own amusement. Through the story, Dean and Seamus continued to change expressions. The surprised raised eyebrows exchanged with a rather angry scowl. If Harry hadn’t been in so much pain right now, it would actually have been quite funny.
Both Remus and Snape started protesting at the same time, believing – and probably knowing – the atmosphere in the room would turn from cozy to freezing awkward in just a few minutes. Realizing he was agreeing with the Dark Arts Professor, Snape calmed himself enough to ask them to stay. It was incredibly obvious how desperately he wished for the opposite, but Harry appreciated the effort. Sitting down on the couch, he smiled as Remus slowly joined him.
“Get off ‘ye beast.” Hagrid chastised as he hurried to drag the dragon back inside. Harry pushed as well on the large scaly chest and was finally able to rise.
“I’m happy for you.” Jason said with such honesty, no longer laughing. Harry wasn’t sure what to say, so he simply changed the topic.
“Erhm, yes, please.” The curtain carefully opened and Hermione stuck her head out. “I like this one, but I’m not sure if it looks a little… mottled since the purple one I wore last time.”
Understanding the Slytherin mind, Draco knew this was Pansy’s way of apologizing. And to be completely truthful, he had missed her a little as well. Their relationship had always been so intense so full of understanding yet they annoyed the hell out of each other. He had missed her snarky comments when they were heading towards someone else.
“So,” Harry tried to sound as innocent as possible. “I’m going to stay here, and Remus has promised we could spent it together.”
Hugs? Harry couldn’t help the small smile from spreading across his face. Looking up from his letter he found himself being the center of attention once again, he stuffed the letter into his pocket before getting up to leave.
Laughing Harry was surprised as a brown owl almost landed in his pumpkin juice. A small note was attached to the leg and it impatiently stretched it out for him to gather. Harry took the note after giving the owl a single cornflake to munch on.
Suddenly the two gorillas of Malfoy’ friends came towards them. It was rather weird they were heading in the opposite direction considering they were all in potion class together. On the other hand, those two were without a doubt the dumbest creatures in school, if not in England, so how was Harry supposed to know what was going on inside their heads.
Jason? He was certainly the nicest boy from Slytherin. He was kind of cute. Not so much Harry’s type, but he could see the appeal. So someone as nice but not Jason in particular. Besides, he was obviously very much in love with Zabini. Zabini was very handsome, smart, certainly. A few more people had grown up a lot this summer.
Fearing the worst, Harry constantly searched for any funny looks from the Slytherins. But on his way to the great hall, nothing seemed out of the ordinary hatred he always received from the snakes. In the sunlit hall the conversation was bussing like any other day. Harry couldn’t help but cover behind a group of fourth years as he hurried for shelter at the Gryffindor table. As much as he hated himself for it, he couldn’t help the searching glance at the Slytherin table, where he sought out his friend. Across the room, Jason sat and Harry was almost scared for his health. The suntanned boy was almost sickly pale and by the looks of it, he almost seemed nauseas at the thought of eating the cereal in front of him.
The silence in the room became touchily uncomfortable. Severus had never intended to spend Christmas with Potter nor Lupin. It hadn’t been a complete waste of time, but it certainly never dawned on him to possibly be left alone with the wolf. Why his son insisted on them conversing, he had no idea. He would have understood the want for Potter to join, since the boys had become companions. Maybe Lupin had simply been the extension on that invite.
“Get out.” Draco left his things on the small table on went to open the door. “I’m done with you. I’ll win this bet and you better start looking for a new source of money, because I will most certainly not be standing at the end of the aisle.”  The red patches on Pansy’s cheeks told Draco he had hit a nerve, bringing up her family’s need to marry of their youngest daughter into wealth. It had been quite a few years since the Parkinsons’ had done well for themselves and when the oldest son had lost his business for the second time, their embarrassment only grew in the society.  Storming past him, the girl left running down the stairs.
Their bodies were slick against each other as they moved in harmony, Lauris’s hands kept moving from his shoulders to his hair, grabbing on and pulling him down for a kiss. They came closer to the edge as their moves got desperate. In the end, Lauris pulled away to gasp for fresh air and he tightened around Severus’ member. The grip around him and the moaning of his name became too much and he forced himself in harder than before, gripping any part of the body beneath him as he filled him.
The second he laid a hand on the snout, the childish and friendly Aodhan reappeared. Licking his hand, the dragon pushed his head against him almost pushing him down again, in eager. Harry looked around to see if the spider had died but all he could see was the burn marks on the ground. The spider must have run away when it realizes Aodhan was a firebreather.
“Well as you know, I’m gay. I was recently asked out by Draco Malfoy and I decided to say yes. Which is why I have spent so much time around the Slytherins lately.”
“Yeah I could use something warm.” Harry gave a small smile and both went in the direction of the Three Broomsticks. Opening the rotting tree door, the boys saw how packed the place was. Finding a smaller table at the center, they sat down. They didn’t say much to each other before one of the barmaids wanted their order.
Back in London the grey weather had finally given in and the rain was pouring down. People hurried on the street, whishing to seek shelter from the large drops that were soaking through their layered clothes. Harry’s shift hadn’t even ended yet, but here on the street he was. Angrily he grabbed his bag even tighter and tried to hurry through the masses.
They were standing face to face now. Malfoy looked rather casual standing with his hands in his front pockets. Harry tried not to fiddle too much and settled for clasping his hands.
“I think we better let it go. Malfoy said something to get me riled up on purpose and it worked. I made a mistake and I should be happy he didn’t prosecute me.”
“Harry, pull the rest off.” Draco tried to sound demanding, but Harry couldn’t keep from smiling at the whiny tone. Seeing Draco lying like that, waiting for him, filled his confidence and he quickly pulled off the rest of his shoes, pants and socks. The only piece missing was the silken boxer covering the most interesting part of him. Harry lied back down and he felt shaken as he pulled off the clothing piece.
to stop himself from saying the word ‘mudblood’. An as Jason pointed out, he would never know if he cancelled their date now.
Trying to compose himself, Potter didn’t look very amused by the thought of having to share a carriage with the Slytherins.
Getting in line to pay, the blond boy asked if he had found anything. Shaking his head, Harry continued to watch the line.
Trying to hide a yawn, Draco hurried up the stairs in the dungeon. He was already late for breakfast, since he’d spent most of last night, turning and tossing. His head had left him with hundreds of different thoughts and ideas, all fighting for the right to rule. He kept imagined Harry’s smiling face and the laughter they shared. While the images left him flustered and spiralling, Pansy’s annoying shrill voice kept interrupting.
“Unfortunately, it would do more damage than good. The shell is only as hard as it needs to be for the dragon to come out. If the dragon can’t, he won’t survive out here.”
“So you guys dated?” It seemed totally weird to think of his friend ‘making out’ with Professor Snape. Harry grimaced at the idea. Seeing the expression on Harry’s face, the werewolf started chuckling.
Deciding he had had enough of his friends’ fun on his behalf, he left to go to bed. Draco was about to throw his shirt off when he sound of footsteps came towards him. Without even knocking Pansy entered the room, seeming prissy as ever.
“I do not know, Potter. Your father and I barely spoke more than a few sentences across seven years unless you count hexes. But I do believe if you get the chance, you could acquire Lupin. He would know for sure.”
He almost regretted asking such a personal and depressing question when he saw the way Jason’s jaw clenched. The hand on his chest clenched around a handful of his shirt.
“I’m fine.” Blaise looked aside, probably at a lock of Jason’s hair. He never seemed to be able to look straight at him whenever he felt the need to lie. A trade most decent humans shared, although it could be imposed by the mated part in him. “Really.” He tried to reassure him.
“Yes, Australia. Well it appears someone I once knew had been withholding a secret from me for very long. It wasn’t until recently I discovered… I have a son.” Severus was looking down into the half-empty cup, not really sure what to expect from the Headmaster whom he considered his best friend, mentor and the closest thing he had ever had to a father figure.
They didn’t have to wait for long with the rest of the Gryffindors and the Slytherins, as the door slammed open and a rich voice erupted; “Get in, sit down and turn to page 438 part 2, QUIETLY.”
Ron didn’t seem convinced but given the nature of their relationship right now, he raised no further questions and continued to eat his scrambled eggs. Still feeling slightly hungry, Harry grabbed an apple before leaving. His heart was pumping in excitement and he felt butterflies in his stomach, while he tried not to run out of the hall.
“That’s great. Congratulations.” Harry chuckled and lifted the spoon off his tray. Pumpkin soup wasn’t a favorite but the warmth was needed.
Tearing his eyes away he quickly sneaked his way through the narrow halls before realizing he actually had no idea where to go. He couldn’t very well go home. It would be the first place his father would tear down to the ground, trying to find him. His family and all his friends were gathered here. Should he try to find Blaise in the hall?
Blaise seemed more and more uncomfortable and Jason could literally feel his pulse beneath his warm glove and through his hand. After a few seconds, where he didn’t answer, Jason got slightly annoyed.
In his sleep deprived state it took a few minutes before Harry realized what Hagrid was trying to tell him.  Looking towards the teachers’ table, he noticed Hagrid’s absent. Quickly he swung his feet over the bench, ready to leave.
“She was a witch in the eighteen hundred who fell in love with a dying man. Fearing for her life without him she turned to dark magic and on his deathbed, she turned him into an inferius. The second he woke up, he saw her and killed her.”
“Well, we have already talked it through, Mr. Malfoy and I do not believe young Mr. Malfoy jr. will be pressing any charges, did I understand correctly?” He turned to give the young blond boy a twinkly-eyed look.
Arriving at the library, Harry searched for an unoccupied table. Most seemed available as the majority of students were still in class. The advanced classes were few, so they had time to practice and study on their own. Thankfully, Jason had been kind to teach him how to make a decent essay for their assignment in History of Magic.
Harry backed back from the door as he felt the need to sit down. Without saying a word, he left to sit down on the couch and Draco took a small step into the apartment. Enough to close the door behind him.
Harry didn’t really feel like keeping anymore secrets from his friend, especially since they were finally on speaking terms again.
“Well, I’m used to having a ‘lovely’ time with boys. Although they are usually Slytherins.” He said innocently. “Brown eyes, dark skin, good body-“ Beside him the sound of the scissors cutting, stopped. “Still sleeps in my dormroom… you know the type.”
“So, what?” Draco just sneered right back. He knew what she wanted but he wasn’t happy about this turn of events either, so if he could make it worse for her, so be it.
“Listen Parkinson, whatever you tell your father is your problem. I kept to my part and I didn’t plan on bringing my parents along but somehow it happened. Roll with it.”
Harry wasn’t sure what part of him started pounding more, his head or his heart. He hadn’t expected to tell his friends of Malfoy. At least not for a rather long time. Trying to calm himself, he turned back to Malfoy, not really sure what to look for. Support, he supposed. But to be fair, dealing with Ron, he was probably better off on his own.
“Great. At least, I think so. He is always quite difficult to read but he barely put up a fight when I asked him to go out on a date next Hogsmead trip.”
“I’m sorry.” Malfoy whispered. As Harry looked at him, he realized Malfoy looked more... surprised than sorry. “I really am.” He whispered. Laying a gentle hand on his arm, he felt Malfoy give a tiny jump, almost as if he had forgotten he wasn’t alone. Malfoy shook his head, probably to clear it. Smiling, Harry leaned slightly against his shoulder. Malfoy continued to ask him questions about his childhood, or lack of. Some questions were easy; where he grew up, how his family looked – Malfoy laughed at his comparison of a pig to his cousin-, others were slightly harder. Questions whom not even his friends had ever asked him. Even though it didn’t change what had happened to him, Harry found it difficult anyway to answer how his birthdays’ were like, how he learned to read and write, the time he learned about his real family and how the Durleys’ had lied to him. Through the whole conversation, Malfoy listened carefully and never interrupted or pushed him. When he ran out of questions, they simple sat together. Harry felt somewhat exhausted from all the talking and closed his eyes for a second. Simply to rest them.
It was almost comically how the entire group turned around at the same time, seeing a rather angry potion Professor standing behind them. His arms crossed, Snape looked far from amused at the sight of the giant battlefield occupying the pitch. Harry could practically point out the popping vein on his forehead growing. Harry discreetly looked to his left where Jason was, and he could clearly see the discomforting look across his face.
Harry’s leg started stamping lightly as he waited for the teen he had considered a friend. He almost jumped as there sounded a knock on the door. Without waiting for a resounding call, Jason stepped into the living room.
Hagrid gathered the dragon in his arms and held him close, while Harry carefully picked up a foot to cut. He was careful to listen whenever Hagrid told him it was too close to the root before cutting. He really didn’t want to hurt Aodhan. But while the dragon was very cute and happy, he was also very determined not to help them in any way. As soon as Harry had clipped the first claw, Aodhan started struggling and even went as far as to bite Hagrid. Thankfully, his teeth weren’t big enough to do any damage but it didn’t look pleasant.
An elbow was placed in between his ribs and he had to bite his tongue in order to keep from hissing. Looking to the left, he realized that not only Lucius – whom had been the elbow shovel – but everyone was watching him. Mr. Knott was standing up as the only member and held out a letter in his hand. Getting a grip on himself quickly he got up with as much grace as possible, even though he dreaded whatever the letter entailed.
And soon the Gryffindors would find out too. His friends would pity him, try to keep him away from the masses of questions going his way. Hermione and Ron would be supportive but he would know; every time he would turn away, they would look at each other with knowing gazes. Confirming how right they had been from the start about Draco. The school would tease, gossip and laugh behind his back for the rest of the year. It would be just like in firth year, only instead for anger and disbelief; they would look at him with mockery and pity. For some reason, the idea felt a hundred times worse.
Starting to recognize the accent and way-too-happy morning attitude, Harry barely had to turn before answering;
“Hey.” He announced his arrival to his two friends as they realized whom had entered the common room.  They looked to be in a rather lively discussion and Harry figured they needed time alone so he hurried towards the dorm.
Draco sat for a long time, waiting for the anger to surface. He remembered all the confusion and heartache it had given him, whenever he heard about Harry. But seeing the devastating face of his fiancé, the anger somehow never came. He realized they had both been trapped in their own misery. Pansy wasn’t stupid. She must have seen the uncaring and indifference on his face whenever they discussed the wedding. He never thought of how much it must have affected her, seeing him like that.
Hoping to have finally infuriated the teen, Draco looked discreetly to his side. Although he had imagined it would anger him, he certainly wasn’t prepared for the boy to start shaking. Before he even had time to ask, a low rather angry snarl and then, everything went dark.
“Leave him alone, you slimy git!” The weasel just shouted as he stormed off with Potter in a tow and all their irritating friends. Left behind stood a shocked Slytherin and five laughing teens.
“She will probably show up soon again, Colin.” The boy beside him smirked. While no man could compare to the sexiness of his boyfriend, Harry was certainly not blind. The teen in front of him had a cool demeanor and a strawberry blond curl was naturally waving down in front of his forehead.  If Draco didn’t have that honor already, this guy could definitely have turned Harry around.
Well that wasn’t much to work with, but Harry was very aware of how self-protective the Slytherin could be. They believed any given information, could be used against them somehow.
The widening of his eyes must have been enough for Knott because he gave a cat-like smirk before returning to his book.
Thinking back on all the moments Harry and his friend had had in this very hall. Harry felt excited. Yet, a lingering sadness tore him as he forever had to say goodbye to his only real home. It was with a heavy heart. Looking back at his NEWT results he was quite ready to leave. Hermione had assured him that his grades were enough to get him into a healing studentship at St. Mungos. It had been a harsh month. Looking back at the disaster of his first real relationship with a boy, Harry was at least relieved to leave it behind him. He hadn’t heard a single word from Malfoy ever since that day, and while he often felt the haunting looks at the back of his neck, he stubbornly held on and kept far away from the blond.
Normally on a beautiful day such as this, Harry would be outside with the rest of the students but for now, he was stuck inside the library. With the spelled warmth inside the giant room, a sweater was unnecessary, but Harry couldn’t help but feel the need for soft sweaters, hot chocolate by the fire and having another snowball fight. Wanting the homework to be over as quickly as possible, the two boys spent every free hour together at the library. It might seem like an easy task but the assignments demanded even more research than last time, and getting together when Slytherin and Gryffindor had a free period wasn’t more than once a week.
Back in the infirmary, Madam Pomphrey had concluded her lecture on healing Jason’s skin, by handing Blaise a salve to rub CAREFULLY on to his broken skin. The young men grimaced when she told them his skin would be pretty well after shedding the old. Silently Blaise started dapping the neck and chest with the ill-smelling potion. Nothing happened except turning his skin slightly green but that was to be expected.
‘Malfoy is unbelievable! God, that bastard is never going to change.’ Harry thought as he stormed down the corridor. He should probably call off their trip to Hogsmeade all together. They could hold up a decent conversation for about two minutes, but deeper issues had to matter as well. At some point, they would have to discuss their society or politics and they were clearly in disagreement. Even though Malfoy claimed to have changed, it certainly wasn’t enough.
“Sir, I swear I want to tell you, but I cannot.” Harry hurried to continue as Snape looked ready to yell at him again. “I really want to, sir! But Jason has his own reason and if I tell you why I know… I fear he will hate me. I know he will tell you at some point. Could you please just let it go for now?” He begged.
Mr. Malfoy seemed completely outraged at his son’s refusal. While Mrs. Malfoy was still making sure her son was truly okay, Dumbledore shushed everyone out of the office, only leaving the Malfoys’ and Snape, since it was a ‘family matter’ now.
Sitting down, Harry leaned up against the hard surface of the tree. Malfoy sat down right beside him and Harry couldn’t help but notice how their thighs touched. He could feel the heat Malfoy’s body gave away, and again he got chills, although this time it sent a pleasant shiver through his entire body.
After Harry had opened the last button on his white shirt, he sat back down in his wooden chair. He had already thrown his sweater and robes on the floor over fifteen minutes ago. He imagined this was how a sauna felt with the sweating, the damp air and the fireplace. Not that Harry had ever tried one. He didn’t even bother to waft himself, since the air was so intense it would only feel even hotter against his face.
