The rapid French did its job as they took the next few steps, successfully dissuading the men from approaching them. When they had turned away and moved down the steps, Draco quickly dropped Potter’s arm.
Cheer does not yet extend to the stock room."
Her head snapped up and she stood up straight.
Today though, he had at least an hour before he was going to let himself go home. More importantly, he was having a hard time. Surely he could justify something like a guitar with his parent's money; ultimate happiness had to be the goal of inheritance, right? He took a deep breath and pushed open the door. The melodic bells that went off were very appropriate but they made Harry want to cower behind the tower of amps he found himself faced with just inside the door.
"Draco Malfoy," Harry said, trying to gain his mate's attention. "Eva Potter," Draco drawled in response. Harry flinched visibly at his mate's unintentional mistake by deadnaming him. "If we're going to be mates you should know my secrets," Harry explains tentatively, "You might not want me once you know," He admits sheepishly. Draco nods, unsure of how to respond. "I'm trans," Harry says bluntly, "I'm a guy, I want to be called Harry and treated like any other bloke," he added, cheeks bright red. Draco felt a strong urge to comfort his mate, to let Harry know he was loved and that Draco wanted him. Draco moved to the other end of the compartment sitting next to Harry before pulling the smaller boy into his lap, wrapping arms tightly around him. "It's okay," Draco assures him, "I've got you, you're safe with me." Harry sniffles softly before letting himself breakdown. He lets the tears stream from his eyes as he buried his face in Draco's chest. Draco held him close, soothingly rubbing his back. Harry cried himself to sleep in Draco's arms. Draco runs his fingers through Harry's hair and rubs soothing circles on his back, happy to just sit there and hold his mate. Draco felt an overwhelmingly protective urge towards the small boy in his arms. Draco knew his mate would have a lot to overcome and he wanted to be by his side through everything. Harry slept comfortably in Draco's arms for several hours, sleeping soundly.
July, Privet Dr:
“Are you my godfather?” Harry asks after bursting into the compartment. “Ari--“ Remus starts to reply. Draco bursts in after him, “Harry there you are, sweetness,” Draco looks relieved. “I’m sorry, Harry,” Remus immediately corrects himself as if it were nothing. “I am one of your godfathers,” he confirmed, “Siri, my husband, is as well,” he adds, “We would have given anything to raise you, but Dumbledore cursed us to stay away,” Remus confirmed Draco’s suspicions.
Harry looked up into Draco's eyes, still fearful. "I'm not, I'm broken..." Harry explains tensely, "I'm a submissive...but I'm not...pure," he explained, tears running down his cheeks and a bright blush turning his brown skin rosy as he told Draco in the proper terms, knowing most dominants wouldn't accept their submissive mate if they were 'damaged goods'. Draco held him tighter, squeezing him hard. "What happen?" Draco asks, running his fingers through the scared boy's hair, making an effort to comfort him. "My uncle...he..." Harry sniffles out, sobs quickly overtaking his ability to speak. "Harry, baby," Draco whispers in a forced calm tone, "It's not your fault if your uncle raped you." Harry lets out a breath he hadn't realized he had been holding, it comes out as a sigh. "You don't hate me?" Harry asks sheepishly, voice trembling. "Oh Harry! I want to take care of you, I want to protect you, to fall in love with you, to make you my husband, to spend my life with you, to raise a family with you, for you to know you belong to me and no one can take what's mine away or harm it. My Harry, my sweet boy," Draco assures firmly. Harry sobs into Draco's shirt. A while later Harry calms down, feeling completely safe for the first time in his memory.
AU: Voldemort died the first time
Trans!Harry, Trans!Remus, Drarry,  Wolfstar, LGBTQ+ characters, mostly LGBTQ+ accepting wizarding world, mentions of abuse, evil/manipulative Dumbledore
Harry always dreaded his birthday. His uncle always found 'presents' for him which were painful, humiliating, and gave him nightmares for months following thereafter. Ever since Harry was seven and had began insisting that he was a boy, his uncle had added sexual abuse to his repertoire of punishments. Now Uncle Vernon had to beat the magic out of him and fuck the freakishness out as well. Harry had stopped caring years ago, just accepting that this was what he deserved. Hogwarts had been a refuge, a months long escapes from the beatings and rapes which had become a more frequent occurrence over the years. Harry never fought back, it was useless his uncle weighed nearly three times as much as the half-starved teen.
“Why didn’t Dumbledore let me be with you?” Harry asks after a few minutes. “He’s a very manipulative man and he felt betrayed when your parents, Sirius, and I decided not to be a part of his war anymore. He sought revenge. He framed Tom Riddle, the man he named Lord Voldemort, but he killed your parents because he wanted to control you,” Remus explains, “He’s a power hungry bastard who demands loyalty,” Remus continued, “He killed your parents, drove the Longbottoms to insanity, and framed his political opponents. He has been brainwashing children for far too long and until now no one has challenged him.
TW: rape scene, child abuse
He knew what it meant. It meant he had to wait, his mate whoever he was--and it would most definitely be a man because Draco was 110% gay--his mate hadn't came into their inheritance yet, he was younger. Draco spent the next almost two months doing his best to avoid his father and staving off boredom by reading, gardening, and completing his summer essays. Finally at the end of July, the pull of his mate appeared. Draco knew who his mate was, Eva Lily Potter--the bloody girl-who-lived. He knew she wasn't a veela because another veela would've been drawn to his location immediately, the veela magic leading her to his location. Draco spent the final month of summer moping about and attempting to come to terms with who his mate was.
Draco took a sharp breath. “Want to just call this date one? I mean, we’ve already gotten the whole inappropriate public snogging out of the way.”
If Harry had all the information, he'd never be standing across from Draco in any space. He'd never gain trust again.
“Times change,” Draco said.
“Those were pretty hilarious, you have to admit,” Malfoy smirked.
“What’s the plan, Harry,” he gasps, pulling back. “Food shopping, remember?”
"Am not."
It was Theo’s turn to laugh. “Well, maybe. But there is also the distinct possibility that you’ve helped them work out their issues for the first time ever.”
sake.
“He just uses the pen for the takeaway cups, but he draws really awesome designs. I’ve wanted to get a couple of them permanently inked,” Diego laughed. “Go on, Harry. He’ll get a kick out of it.”
“Liar. You should be at home. With your family,” Draco said darkly.
“Because I need help.”
am learning that even devastation is an opportunity for transformation, and my gratitude evolves as I do.”
“Wh-what?” Harry stuttered.
He ignored Potter’s absence, in fact, until the first Saturday in the January term when Quidditch practises were cancelled. The notice was innocuous, scribbled on parchment and tacked to the front hall notice board. But to Draco, who knew that cancelling Quidditch was an escalation that hadn’t been seen since the war, a dark and tiny panic set in; at breakfast, he worried at his plate until he was so obvious that Flitwick, sitting to his right, cleared his throat and looked at him pointedly.
He extended his hand and Potter, much to Draco's combined annoyance and amusement, flinched slightly.
“A quote.”
“See? You missed me too.”
"Happy?" Harry had finished wryly.
“If you ever figure that out, let me know.”
Except that maybe he had?
“What?” Harry said, the blood draining from his head and making him dizzy. “No, he isn’t.”
Which.
He handed the paper back to the man, who simply nodded and closed his briefcase again, walking away.
He changed into a wool jumper that morning before he even headed down to the station. It was an old one, grey herringbone with fraying cuffs. Technically, it had been the first jumper he’d laid his hands on in his wardrobe, but a long-forgotten argument surfaced the second he pulled it over his head and he had to wonder if there wasn’t something larger at work in the fact that he put it on. Words swam in his head, making him dizzy enough that he sat heavily on his bed to breathe for a moment.
He bought a nondescript sign for an innocuous company to make Muggles less curious and connected to the Floo Network—the permits from the Ministry alone had taken four months.
“We have too much... water, bridge, all that,” Harry said, looking him in the eye again.
“I can go somewhere else. I can just rent a place. We don’t have to tell the Ministry. It’s okay.”
. They...well, they seemed very dangerous, actually.”
It was owned by none other than Harry
“No,” he said eventually. “No, that would be worse. Alone is worse. But listen, can I ask a favour? Can you stop...calling me Potter? It’s a little...god, I don’t know, charged?”
He just didn’t know how to mesh that information with who he was, what his responsibilities to the New World Order were. He didn’t know how to match himself to that; how did he explain to other people that he was fixated on a former master of the death at Hogwarts. How did he explain this to
“Oh, I’m ready,” Harry replied, stepping up to the shelf beside Draco, crowding into his space and reaching behind him. Draco inhaled sharply and felt himself collapse a little bit into his frame. But Harry just held out a large brown file folder.
to get killed.”
,” she added proudly.”
Ron blushed the deepest shade of scarlet Draco had ever seen and immediately whirled around to face the fire. “Right, um, erm, yeah. I’ll just. I’ll sort myself. I’ll…see you soon.”
“Uh, hi.”
“Mostly because it wasn’t that surprising. We need...different things. He needs someone who isn’t going to lie to him, who he doesn’t have to look after. I need someone who will challenge me. Question me.”
in love with him. So you already forgave him. And now, you don’t need to forgive him again," Hermione said.
“What the fuck did you just do?” Ron asked with a laugh.
“That cousin,” Lily sighed dramatically. “He can’t sort out his own Christmas gifts. I tell you.”
“What?”
on my desk.”
“Yeah,” Harry breathed, running a hand through his hair and disheveling his attempts to flatten it. “Yeah, I’m...Draco.” He put his coffee down slowly on the table and sat beside Draco on the couch, facing him and inhaling deeply. “Draco, I need to…tell you. Something.”
“Goodness, who could that be,” Narcissa asked him primly, clearly already on guard.
“Sorry, I don’t know what’s wrong,” Harry said. “I just feel…like my hackles are up.”
"What?"
She glared at him and readjusted the baby. He knew that was the way to get her; Hermione, without information, was like a rabid dog. Unable to let it lie. She nodded once and stepped back, leaving a small gap for him to step into the entryway.
“Well, if you’re desperate,” she simpered, making him cringe in anticipation as she unsnapped her wallet and pulled out the familiar business card of
Seizing his opportunity, Owen whipped around.
“Auror card goes a long way, especially when you show up at one in the morning.”
Harry could not stop thinking about that night at the bar; across the room, in a place full of people, he’d only seen blonde, silvery hair. His eyes had laser focus. The only person he could look at and actually see had been the one with the hollow cheeks and the slightly soured expression. He knew that face because it’s how he actually felt about these things. Ministry sponsored mixers were actually just sanctioned torture for all of them, anyone who had survived the war as a part of the new regime. Everyone was trying to speak to him. Five years in the field, and he still dealt with the disgusting celebrity focus. It had started to fade, sure. There was a new generation coming up, ones who didn’t really give a fuck. Harry was counting the days. But that brought its own issues, its own drama. Now, the new kids were unaware of what had happened on that fateful day in the North end of nowhere Scotland. That was harder. He hadn’t been ready.
Draco and Harry get their inheritances
When Draco finally found his way into the compartment where Ariana was sitting crying her eyes out. Draco feels a strong need to comfort his mate. Before Draco can think, he has his mate in his lap holding her tightly. Draco takes a thumb and gently wipes away the tears. Harry looks up into grey-blue eyes. "You won't want me...once you know..." Harry croaks out between tears. Draco holds his small mate tightly, "Tell me sweetest," he whispers softly then squeezes her even more. "I'm not a girl, at least I'm not supposed to be..." Harry says blushing and crying. He hid his face in Draco's cheek. Draco rubs his back, "It's okay love," he whispers. Harry sobs himself breathless. "What should I call you?" Draco asks, "I assume you prefer a different name," he adds in a soft voice. Harry nods, "H-h-arr-ry," he stutters out nervously. "Harry," Draco repeats with a half smile, "Suits you." Harry falls into an exhausted and fitful sleep. Draco holds Harry close as the small boy sleeps for a few hours before waking up. "Draco," Harry says, his voice raspy from crying and from sleep. "I have you, sweet boy," Draco reassures him. Harry blushes softly and turns away.
June, Malfoy Manor:
Harry settled himself in Draco’s lap once again in the carriage, soaking up every moment they had together. "I don't want to go to Gryffindor," Harry whispers, "I wish I was a Slytherin," he says wishfully. "You can request a resort," Draco suggests. "Really?" Harry asked hopefully. "Any student who has a major life change has the right to get a resort if they desire. You coming out as trans counts," Draco told him earnestly. As soon as the carriages arrived at Hogwarts, Harry and Draco went straight to the headmistress's office. Draco knocked curtly. Professor McGonagall opened the door quickly, her expression one of pure shock. She saw the two students who had given her terrible migraines for the previous five years, bitter rivals--enemies. Yet the two were standing outside her door, holding hands and grinning. Malfoy even had an arm around Potter's waist. She ushered them in, all her effort focused on not passing out from pure shock.
Harry had tears in his eyes and curled himself up in his boyfriend’s lap. He had been holding himself together for so long, he let it all out as soon as he felt safe. Draco was still dealing with his own emotional turmoil, but his urge to protect Harry was stronger. Draco felt an insatiable desire to protect and care for the smaller boy who had allowed himself to be vulnerable and but his faith in Draco.
Harry eventually fell into a restless, exhausted sleep. Draco held his sleeping mate, imagining a life where they raised the baby Harry’s bastard of an uncle had forced into his beautiful mate. He knew he could love the child as his own because it would be part of his Harry. He imagined them raising this little one, who he thought would be a girl, alongside Harry’s godson and two or three children of their own. Draco fell asleep thinking about the family he could have with his mate. Draco resolved to support any and all choices Harry made about  his pregnancy and to always hold him when he needed to break down.
It was easy to ignore the fact that he was bored.
“Sure. Whatever. Get back to work, loser,” she said, laughing at him. “Or have you already carved out an entire afternoon of pining over the bloke?”
“Wizard, but a squib.”
“I know but—”
. They show up without asking questions. Dressed appropriately.”
"This is my bank. We'll add you to my Muggle account. I never use it anyway, but it'll make it harder to close it because you'll need me there too."
, of all people, are here asking me about it just goes to show how insane this world has become. You’re not getting your bloody comment. Get. Out.”
“No rush,” he replied, shucking his coat and laying it on the omnipresent stool beside the guitar wall. He pulled one down at random, a bright blue strat that he knew Draco had ordered years ago thinking someone might buy it. He strummed once, hating the sound of the unplugged electric and throwing it back on the shelf. He shoved his hands in his pockets and took in the shop.
“He’s having a hard time with unicorns,” Diego teased, making Draco wince. Diego, of course, had no idea that bringing up unicorns in the present company wasn’t a great plan.
One was whispering
“Number one,” he said. “Why did you ask Pansy for my number? Yes. Hermione told me. Also, she’s very interested in why Pansy then showed up at her Ministry event last night, but I feel like that’s a conversation for another day.”
it had been as painful for Harry as it had been for Draco.
“I adore you, Geegee.” He kissed her on the cheek and she smiled a long-suffering smile before belting him across the head.
“Please,” he laughed. “It’s Fililus now. We’re coworkers, after all!”
“You should come sit at the bar,” Potter said casually, going back to his work for the second time.
“The kitten?” Draco replied in disbelief. He considered a moment and then held Zinnia up to his face with scrutiny. She mewled in distress and he shook his head and held her back against his chest, stroking her head and pulling gently on her ear tuft until she purred so loudly that Harry could hear it from his spot on the floor. “Of
"Not forever," Draco responded quietly. "Just for now.” “Why are you so stuck on this?” “Because,” Draco said fiercely. “Because at least if you were tethered, I'd know where you were. I know you were still alive. Still… safe." Draco dropped his eyes then, clearly close to crying.
of a Muggle flat, with a Muggle job and Muggle friends. Admittedly, it wasn’t a Muggle boyfriend, but his promise to his father held firm.
“Still stuck, then?” he said wryly.
“Excuse me,” he’d asked the chirpy attendant touring them around. “Is that one okay?"
“Abe, enough. It was a long time ago, and it was just a stupid crush.”
“Yes,
As he settled at the table with Harry, Draco pushed the small paper out toward the middle of the table. "What's this, Hare? Are you going to go see someone?" he asked casually.
Draco. Answer. Me.
That hadn't stopped him from going
He figured he’d need all his patience for stupid Pureblood arguments by tea-time.
manoeuvres in the air during a routine pre-season
“You could take the day,” she said, strangled. It had taken her a lot to offer and it made Draco smile.
"Sorry,” Draco said, realising he was staring a little oddly. “You, uh…you look a little familiar."
“I really am,” Potter laughed.
“Hermione, what are people going to say? No one is going to just accept a six-month break and move on. Molly is going to murder me. The papers will get a hold of the story. We’ll be the target of everyone all over again.”
“Go. See. McGonagall. I’m not doing this with you right now. Not without witnesses,” Malfoy sneered. He spun on his heel and stormed away.
He hung up.
“Mornings,” Draco declared. “Are horrible. And you know it.”
you, Malfoy!” she suddenly snapped. “Harry’s been here since Saturday and he made no mention of you.”
“Well, yeah, but you had every right to—”
“I didn’t really gauge my strength that well,” Harry said miserably. “I’d never Obliviated anyone.”
“Yeah. It was a start,” Harry admitted, letting the conversation of the past go. “It would probably be enough to protect you from a dementor for a minute. Now you just practice.”
His trousers must be soaked, cold and extremely uncomfortable. Harry gave himself a stern talking to take his mind off of Malfoy’s trousers and held up a pathetic half wave that he instantly regretted. He really was such a git. Trying to cover his embarrassment, he moved toward the bench slightly faster.
of large company changes
Life. It is hard. And messy. And scary and perfect and awful and lovely and the most confusing part of the universe. It is full of ups and downs and in-betweens that you can't even begin to feel. These characters are just life. Come join them on the random meander through years of regular. Years of tea and dirty spoons. Years of adventure and quiet.

“Yes, of course. Night!”
“Bill, thanks for talking to me, but I’m not sure you...I don’t know if what I need to know is something you’ll have the right experience with to help me.”
to tell Hermione!”
Draco considered for a second, thought about how much he could give away, how much he needed to say before he broke everything anyway. But before he could answer, Diego had sat up.
A week before Christmas, Draco was sat at the counter, on his third latte, laughing hysterically at Harry. He’d convinced him to put on Christmas carols and had been treated to no fewer than three all-out performances by Harry and Bridget, complete with dance numbers. He distantly heard the bell in the empty cafe, but it took a full thirty seconds for him to realise that it was Diego who was standing at the counter. He felt cold dread sweep through him until he actually looked over; Diego was grinning broadly, looking between Draco and Harry.
Draco sighed and turned to her. 'Mandy, I've had a very weird two days off. Can you help me?"
Harry was staring again; he gave his head a small shake and tried to look interested as Kingsley spoke, attempting to refocus on what the Minister was saying. After all, that had been his promise, at the beginning of the end. He had sworn that they would be able to work together. That they could carry on as normal.
“Oh god, you aren’t one of those, are you?”
Maybe more violent than was strictly necessary. Definitely more mysterious and aggressive than he’d meant to be. Still. He sent the owl.
“To America,” Pansy added.
He tramped around the room for a few minutes, searching for the file he knew he had left somewhere on the bookshelf, but he kept getting distracted. It was really quite irritating.
“I have a much better secret,” Harry whispered, leaning in a breath more as Draco drew in a breath that he did not release. “You have incredibly wonderful forearms.”
They were at work.
Harry looked around the shop, eyes fixated suddenly on the wall of guitars. “Guess I’m looking for a guitar,” he said with a shrug. “Nothing fancy. Acoustic. The one I learned on was absolute shit so I honestly just want to…”
to like the sun. Supposed to grin at strangers and say inane things like ‘hot enough for ya?’. Being a Brit who liked the sun was too predictable.
Ron surveyed them both with an owl-like gaze. He shook his head. “You two go. Bring me back a latte. I’ll get started on… well, on this.”
Marci pushed on. “The request is that you be moved away from training while you undergo psychoanalysis and internal review. How is that a bad thing? You hate training.”
They don't understand the way we do.
“So you know how you've been standing on this parapet for about three hours now? Creeping out the first years and all that?” Harry announced. “I'm wondering if you are also feeling like a Victorian lady ghost. Because that’s what they’ve decided what you are.”
He glared at her. “He didn’t love her. Anyone could see that. It doesn’t have to be my fault.”
Draco chuckled. “That’s the one. You know, as much as we both know I love it here, I think you saying there is a ‘history’ here is a little pretentious. It’s only been three years.”
“Yeah, okay. Shove aside. I’m making you a drink.”
“Just yes? Have you thought about this from every—”
“Fuck. Are you always this optimistic?”
what he was going to do. And it was going to make everything significantly more complicated.
“It’s getting there,” Ron agreed.
When Diego had first arrived on the scene, Draco hadn’t been much of a person at all. He’d been living off of hush-money from his parents, promising not to tell anyone that he’d actually gilted Astoria because he was gay. He was in a flatshare with people whose names he honestly couldn’t remember now, drinking and partying way too much. He had nightmares that kept him from sleeping at night, and he couldn’t stop moving for five minutes during the day without panicking.
He took a deep breath and turned toward Harry, who'd fallen easily into step with him despite his long stride. He gripped one of Harry’s shoulders, leaned in, and without hesitation, kissed him firmly. Shock only lasted a second before Harry grinned and kissed him back. His lips were chapped and felt different than Diego’s.
Probably not. And yet…
“Do you think they ever used those for actual arrows?” he asked, trying to reset the tension in his shoulders.
And so, without a valid reason why he
“What, why?” Harry laughed.
Harry’s smile turned to a smirk. “That’s just because you’re a needy little brat who knows I’m right. We are dating. You and I. We are a couple. If you don’t admit it, I don’t come home with you again. If you don’t admit it, no more brilliant sex. And I meant it. I come over this time, I’m spending the night. I’m fucking exhausted from the back and forth. We aren’t eighteen. I need to sleep.”
The barest hint of a smile crossed over Theo’s face, and it calmed Pansy’s beating heart significantly. The grave weight of whatever he was about to tell her had not stolen his sense of humour. Suddenly, she was stalwart again. They could handle whatever was about to be thrown their way; they had before, they would again. She took a deep breath and waited.
"So, Draco, you going to tell us why he's still at your flat?" he muttered nonchalantly. "Theo texted us," he added apologetically.
It was infuriating. Every time he got just one step closer to being
Theo had been an accident, truthfully. They’d slept together once, in a messy and ill-advised adventure in sixth year. When Draco found him in Diagon, begging on a corner and bruised from head to toe, it hadn’t taken more than a minute for him to offer half his savings. He had been raised in privilege and the number seemed large enough; he didn’t understand at the time how quickly they would burn through their resources, especially in London. When the money ran out, they’d both decided that going home was not a choice. They’d made their way North, fought their way into terrible jobs that did not pay rent and survived. Just barely, but survived.
As tradition mandated, the projection of forty clients was sorely lacking; the regular crowd of forty had arrived by noon into the warm lounge, settling into their normal crews and pulling out cards and instruments, and the newcomers doubled their numbers by the time lunch was actually served. Draco stood behind the counter only as long as was necessary to serve food, and then dragged Theo out to the lounge, forcing him to play a couple of songs to make Maria smile.
At number 4:
Chapter 1: See me
“I wish I knew if my parents would accept me...” he thinks aloud. “Of course they would, just look at who they named as your godfathers,” Draco replies sincerely. “I have godfathers?” He asks confused. “Remus and Sirius Lupin-Black,” Draco says, “How could no one have told you?” He asks, astonished. “How do you know?” Harry responds with equal surprise. “Everyone knows, godparents are publicly announced, it’s a publicly recognized honor,” Draco explains, “Anyways, Dumbledore must have spelled them not to seek you out. Sirius is my cousin,” Draco adds, “His husband, Remus, is transgender. They have three children and one on the way,” Draco tells him. Harry’s mouth is agape, eyes wide as he takes in the information. Then he was angry, he had godfathers who could have raised him and loved him. “How can I talk to them?” Harry demands desperately. “Remus is our new defense teacher,” Draco tells him, “I do believe he’s a chaperone on the train.”
Draco carried a shaking Harry to their rooms, setting him down on the bed before taking a seat beside him, pulling the smaller boy into his lap and running his fingers through his raven hair. Harry relaxed, finally feeling safe and loved in his mate's arms. They sat in contented silence in each other's arms for a few minutes, just enjoying one another's warmth and company. After a while Draco called for a house elf to bring them up a light dinner, knowing Harry was much too anxious to stomach anything more substantial. Harry nibbled at his food, refusing to leave Draco’s arms. Draco finished his plate and the rest of Harry's when the other boy couldn't eat anymore, his stomach shrunken from starvation.
"Dwaco," Harry yawned out as he woke up, sleep thick on his voice still. Harry blinked several times and looked up at Draco, realizing he was in the other boy's lap. Harry's facial expression was fearful, mouth agape and eyes wide, he scooted out of Draco's lap and curled up into the fetal position. "Harry," Draco whispers in a soft, calm voice, "I'm here when you need me." Harry's expression changes from fearful to shocked to elated to apprehensive to fearful again. "I told you?" Harry asks, "You didn't leave." he adds, astonished. "I'm not leaving," Draco confirms, tone reassuring and a bit forceful. Harry grins, then blushes, "Will you hold me?" he asks, weary and nervous--overwhelmingly fearful of the potential rejection. Draco pulls Harry into his lap, arms tightly around the smaller boy, protectively. "Harry, I'm not leaving," Draco tells him again, wiping Harry's tears from his cheeks. Harry snuggles closer. "Draco, are you not embarrassed to be my mate" Harry whispers meekly, unable to imagine his disgusting self as desirable, it was wholly unfathomable. Harry knew he was a freak. No one loved freaks. That he was unlovable, a monster. That was all Harry knew, what he'd been raised believing. The idea that someone wanted him made him queasy. It felt like a dream, a too-good-to-be-true sort of dream.
“I like you a lot...love you even,” Draco replies, “I will always support you and I want a life with you,” He explains, “Mother will adore you, father will take more convincing,” Draco assures, “I will make sure you are safe from Dumbledore and your relatives. You will have a family and you will be not only accepted, but embraced as yourself.”
There are other safeguards for young children, to protect them from exploitation. Children age six and under must be no more than three years apart in age and children six and under cannot be betrothed to children over age six. Children seven to twelve can be up to five years apart though no one ten or younger can be betrothed to anyone over age twelve. Anyone twelve or older must consent to their contract and the maximum age of the younger member of a match is fifteen. If both parties are over twelve than age differences of up to ten years are acceptable and age differences greater than ten years require approval by the department of wizarding child welfare.
Secondly, there are many laws to protect LGBTQ+ wizards and witches including those under age seventeen. This includes rights in relation to marriage, family, medical care, education, non discrimination, and all other areas. Third, these rights include you. You have the right to access affirming medical care, to be resorted if you choose because gender identity plays a significant role in personality traits and motives, to request placement with affirming guardians, and to be placed in a boys' dorm or a private room, amongst other things,” Draco explains. Harry looks at Draco eyes wide and mouth slightly agape.  "There are many things that can be done to help make your body match your heart and mind," Draco tells him. Harry looks skeptically. "There are potions you can take, surgeries, prosthetics, and binders," Draco explains, "No matter what I will help you and protect you," he vows.
This chapter has taken me a while to write it is very heavy and emotional Discussion of abortion, unwanted/unplanned pregnancy, mention of past rape
It was several hours before either boy spoke again. Harry was the first to, he asked a slightly pointed question, “Won’t your father disown you, he expects an heir?” Harry asks nervously. “He might, I’m much more afraid he is likely to try and pressure you into carrying and heir,” Draco clarifies. “I don’t know if I could handle it...it’s such a woman-ish thing...” he says anxiously, feeling guilt and shame about not feeling like he could give Draco a family. “I understand if it’s not something you want,” Draco replies, holding Harry tightly “I think you should know first that many transgender wizards have had children, it wouldn’t make you any less of a man,” he adds. Harry kisses him softly in thanks.
Harry woke up early the next morning, his stomach lurching. He scrambled out of bed quickly rushing to the bathroom urgently. As soon as he got to the bathroom he wretches into the toilet bowl. Tears stream down his face. Harry sits there, clutching his stomach and sobbing uncontrollably. Draco awakened to his mate retching into the toilet bowl. Draco went over to the bathroom and knelt down behind Harry holding back his hair and wrapped his arm around his shoulders. "Its okay baby," Draco whispered into Harry's ear. Once Harry had finished vomiting he leaned back into Draco's lap sobbing against his mate's bare chest. "How do you feel, baby?" Draco asked him as he rubbed his back soothingly. "I think I need to see Madam Pomfrey," he whispered feeling terrible. "Okay love," Draco said, helping him up and then helping them both get dressed before carrying Harry bridal-style to the hospital wing.
“No, Harry,” Draco said sadly. “Diego was perfect.
Harry let himself blush, let the embarrassment show rather than try and keep it hidden, but said nothing as he stood up and began to walk away.
Harry quickly realised he was going to have to put his distrust aside, at least for the moment. He had few connections here, no leverage he could use. There were so many people in and out of the Auror department that he barely remembered anyone’s name, and as if that weren’t enough, he was constantly busy. After two weeks of orientation, introductions, and whirlwind cases meant to ‘get his feet wet’, he was going to bed at nine each night and felt like he’d been working for a decade by his third Friday.
Tuesday was easy; he went into the store at noon, meaning he’d had time to finish his Christmas shopping, reopen his own bank account, ate a delicious lunch at The Pomme before he’d had to deal with the jumper shipment and the angry grandma’s who were trying to return too-small clothing.
too small. He was probably the only one who was feeling that way, given that Draco was asleep. He had been sound asleep for nearly an hour. Harry understood why; his spell had made sparks for thirteen consecutive attempts. The amount of magic that would have required would have made anyone tired and Draco really hadn’t slept the night before.
When Harry had finished, though, he’d cleared his throat. He began his sentence two or three times. Finally, he sighed and stated, "Forgive me, Potter, but you realize you don't actually seem all that…"
Harry laughed, the sound unrecognisable as his own, so full of pride it was. “Of course your Patronus is a fox,” he laughed, putting the cocoa down on the grass to watch the animal better.
“Want to know what I did right now? Why it worked? I fell asleep. I fell asleep without crying or screaming or drinking. Because
He moved at a half run until he got to the top of the street and into the pound shop. It was early enough in December that there was, thank Merlin, still a rack of horribly tacky headbands with various Christmas-themed ears attached. One day, he planned on getting Erica so trashed again that she explained why she cared so very fucking much about holiday headgear. He knew that if he had tried to go to the floor
“Let’s start with the end of the story,” Harry replied, standing up and backing away.
Harry sighed. “Pansy, you are staying for a while I assume?”
When Blaise had found them and dragged Pansy back, they’d managed to convince them both that they were fine.

“Well,” Hermione grinned. “That seems like the type of thing that shouldn’t wait until morning.”
accepted if Draco was able to go were simply trusting an Auror partner. That nothing existed between them that hadn’t always been there, a tolerant animosity built on mutual respect. She insisted, so he’d squashed the flame. Despite the fired food and the Irish Coffee and the Christmas gifts.
“Through here.” Draco gestured through the tiny corridor to at the end of the hall.
He stormed up to the back stairwell behind his tiny office and stomped up them as loudly as he could manage in his soft leather shoes; it wasn’t that loud, in all honesty, and he knew he was not managing to drown out the sound. Still, it was satisfying.
Malfoy paused, looking cornered. He didn't speak again until the lift opened, announcing its arrival at the Enforcement offices.
anything from you. Before you, I was an independent human being. I was actually pretty happy, frankly. I didn't need anyone. I didn't need anything.”
families. The Twenty-Eight.”
The wink, of course, had the same impact on Potter that it had had on everyone he had ever used it on; the familiar blush, the hesitant pause, the slight choke. The problem was that Draco had not intended to use the power of the wink on Potter.
“I don’t know what you’ve got your back up about,” Draco huffed. “It can hardly come as a surprise that I’m here.”
And Draco stops in his tracks.
“Oh,” Draco hummed. “Thank you.”
The smell is what hit him first.
"What? Date blokes? Guess you're right, actually. Wait!" Harry said, suddenly realizing something, letting his arms fall and standing straight up dramatically. "I don't actually know that you've ever dated anyone."
“Harry,” Draco whimpered.
“It’s not that easy,” Draco said miserably.
“I’m glad to hear it,” Malfoy responded, a genuine smile gracing his delicate features and making him seem far more vulnerable.
Luckily for both of them, the opening notes of the shadow cast introduction began and they stood in their seats as everyone around them settled down. Well, not down. No one really did anything calmly at a Rocky night. It was basically his favourite thing about the theatre. The jeering and the swearing. The complete lack of any propriety.
“He turned you down, though. So now it
“Fuck
Abe shrugged. “He’s cut off all that dreadful hair and actually sleeps now and then. I get it.”
“Yeah,” Draco replied, sliding into Harry’s arms. “But still. Five years? That’s a very long time for any magical effect to—”
“Harry, what the actual fuck are you doing! The sign on the door is HUGE! Do. Not. Open,” Neville shouted. “I can not believe you...your selfishness really knows no bounds, does it?”
“I’m not going,” he repeated.
“No, I’m fine,” Draco snapped, drawing back his anger by clearing his own throat and standing before trying again. “Thank you, for this. I’ll look into it tonight and bring you new information. I know this isn’t easy.”
. Four jobs in five years and you show up every fucking time. What is it going to take, huh? What do I have to do to get you to leave me alone!”
Draco just rolled his eyes and ducked out the door.
The night was cool and dark, cascading shadows long through the hedgerows. They’d decided to walk to an Apparition point rather than floo, hoping to shake off some of the fuzzy warmth of too much food and drink and good company. Which meant that the moment Harry and Draco’s relationship changed, they were standing under the only streetlamp in Ottery St. Catchpole, staring at each other over dust motes that made Harry shiver even to this day.
“I mean, just generally.”
“Well, you’re the one who just used the word ‘screwed’,” Harry replied, shuffling back and standing up. He picked up both containers of food and started to walk out of the room. “It’s late and you should stay. There’s a new toothbrush under the sink. You smell like curry.”
me, Marci? Did you even make an argument for me?”
“Relax, Nev,” Harry insisted, grabbing him by both shoulders and steering him out of the shop. “We just need one that’s a little more party shop and a little less orgy.” Harry smiled apologetically at the scowl his statement produced from the very pretty punk girl at the cash. “Not that there’s anything wrong with that,” he added hastily with a wink.
Harry scrambled down the second they were grounded, and by the time Draco had followed, he had already packed his duffle. They spent a few minutes with Buckbeak, Draco lingering in the background for a few moments as Harry whispered secrets that Draco could guess the contents of. When the giant beast had turned and taken off, screeching away across the horizon, Harry turned to Draco suddenly, a hand extended and a firm expression on his face.
And that had earned him his first, real, unreserved Draco Malfoy laugh. It was rich, and full, and required all of his faculties to listen attentively. He was instantly hooked. Malfoy took his last swig, and stood up, shouldering his coat in that dignified way that Harry thought only people in films pulled off.
Harry smiled boldly. He tried to make his tone lighter when he continued. “We can’t keep fighting; McGonagall will murder us both.”
"Nothing, I am bloody brilliant.” Ron shrugged. “Think it’s going to be fun though."
Draco loved him, and he had since Diego had picked Draco up off some random bar floor two years ago. Loved him since, in no uncertain terms, he had saved Draco's life. He had been such a mess at that point that’d he’d been pretty horrible at first. Still, with steady praise and stalwart love, the relationship had become a comfortable thing, steeping Draco's life in more cosy safety than he had ever known.
“You’re fine,” Harry said impatiently. “Now

“I understand why,” Harry had replied with a shrug. “We’re just getting a job done.”

“You weren’t kidding,” he said to Deigo. “Didn’t know you could draw,

“Of course! I’ll bring you some scones and tea and then get out of your way. You both look like you might be sick. Are you feeling quite alright?”
“I decide what I do,
"Carl," Draco interrupted, a hand flying to his hair, instinctually shoving it back in a habit he'd picked up while arguing with Harry. He took a deep breath.
“Well, yeah, but… he’s
He’d been perched on the edge of Draco’s sofa, not looking settled but also looking pretty normal. Harry Potter always sort of looked like he could fly into action. At least, Harry Potter at work was. Draco had spent an uncomfortable amount of time wondering what a relaxed Harry looked like. What did Harry, out of uniform and lounging, even resemble? Draco had a hard time imagining the spring uncoiled, the flighty energy resting.  When he stood suddenly, it didn’t startle Draco because he was pretty used to Harry leaping first and explaining later. It was slightly more worrying, though, when Harry started pacing..
He took a deep breath and walked slowly up to the table.
Harry spent Saturday afternoon with his headphones in, blasting
Until the day at the fifth bank. It had happened again, and unguarded, he’d told Harry what had been happening. He didn’t even realise how serious it seemed until Harry’s brow was furrowed in that classic and adorable
He let his sentence fall out of the bottom as he realised that he was following Draco closer towards the wall. He didn’t think that he’d actually planned on staying inside, let alone looking at an instrument.
“You didn’t have to come all the way here,” he said.
, before he nonchalantly withdrew his arm as though it wasn't far too late for that action. He didn't speak directly to Harry. He nodded at him vaguely but didn't look him in the eye as he turned to the tall man.
She took her bag back and left through the great doors at a clipped pace. Harry waited until the door closed again before wandering into the now empty Great Hall long enough to pull his cloak over his head. He was part ashamed of what he was about to do, and part too far gone to actually care. He walked the now familiar path up three flights of stairs and through the nooks and crannies to the stained glass window of the toads by the lake. There, curled into a ball, sat Draco Malfoy, holding a cat toy and a bottle of butterbeer. The kitten was on it’s back, trying in vain to capture the tiny feathered bait attached to the string above its head. Harry settled onto the floor, cross-legged, across the corridor, back against the wall, and stilled his breathing as much as he could.
In the end, he needn't have worried.
“Mr Potter,” the cool voice of the goblin on duty intoned, regarding him with a healthy dose of suspicion that was his regular welcome at the bank. Harry supposed that successfully breaking into a bank and stealing a part of its security system had not led him down a path of unending trust, but it did get a little tiresome having to deal with the Goblin Cohort every time he needed to secure a few galleons.
it okay. I can introduce you to some people or whatever, but—”
Draco sighed. He hated this part. "Barkley,” he mumbled.
Harry stood straighter and glared down at the tiny creature. He cleared his throat. “I,” he emphasised. “Will. Wait.”
Harry smiled, took a sip, and shrugged, "Kind of, yeah."
He did not come out of this story sounding good. He knew it. Largely because, in the beginning, he had only intended to do one thing: sleep with Draco Malfoy.
“Yeah, I know, I just…”
“I know. I already have your medical reports from St Mungo’s.”
not heard me? Merlin, you're really not doing well… Ron said, but then he always exaggerates everything, especially when it comes to you or Hermione, or the kids."
The council, when he’d been growing up, had always just been a rumour. He’d never seriously believed the stories his father told. For the two full, happy, glorious years of their shockingly uncomplicated relationship, Draco had barely given the anonymous note he’d received any second thought.
off to get just an ounce of respect and trust around here. A month in and he’s taken that away. Doesn’t even matter what the review says. Everyone always believes him first.”
“I don’t think he hates you.”
For months, he had been threatening to tell Montgomery of the details of his time off, about of the bathtub, about Mungo's. The conversation had happened so many times that it had lost all meaning. But this? This obvious pain? This hurt? It clawed at the dark thing inside of Harry and made him weep without knowing why.
“Draco,” Harry said insistently. “I’m
“I do not have an appointment,” he replied harshly, skipping the pleasantries that wouldn’t get him anywhere anyway. “But I’d like to speak to someone about securing an inheritance.”
“Seven months, sixteen days, fifteen hours,” the man murmured, looking pained.
“Hm. I have terrible taste.”
“They know where you are,” Owen said boldly, seeming to think he had some sort of advantage all of a sudden. Which was ludicrous given that Harry still hadn't seen a wand or any form of protective spells or clothing. It was almost surprising to note how large the man was, how well-trained he looked; Harry almost wanted to laugh. Despite the fact that he looked as though he may wet himself at any moment, Owen Travers seemed to be attempting intimidation. Harry whirled around again, pointing a threatening arm in the man's face until his mouth closed involuntarily.
“Yeah,” Harry replied. “It does. Especially since, you know, I’m
“Checking on my kitten. And finishing Potions. And it’s Christmas. I love Christmas at Hogwarts.”
“Yeah, well,” she huffed, folding her arms and kicking him gently. “Maybe part of the way down the road, but you never really—”
Standing in the middle of all that you broke
“Hello?”
“You know what, Rosie? I think we should go to the park. Sound good?”
"Sorry," he mumbled. "Old habits and such. Do you though? Want a drink. I… But no, it's a weeknight. You won't."
He stood up again, even though Harry was sure he'd only been sitting a moment. He watched him head back toward the door.
For their one year anniversary of being on the Auror team, Hermione had decided they needed to throw a party. Not a big bash, really. Just close friends. Neville and Luna, Humphrey and McLennan from their training class. Hermione had charmed a banner to dance around the walls of the room singing
“Clearly, they don't change all that much,” she teased.
“Would. You. Shut. Up!” Draco shouted as he entered. “It’s bloody Saturday, and I’m pretty sure you’re even keeping the owls awake.”
He needed to change tactics. This was not what he’d had in mind when he’d waltzed into Draco’s office to demand he take his midnight shift on Saturday next. Of course, what came out of his mouth next hadn’t been either.
She trailed off and looked at him at a loss.
Harry opened his mouth, closed it again, took a breath. “Um,” he started. “Yup.”
"You're certainly more chipper than a moment ago," Potter commented.
through the too-thin walls and pretending every day that he was looking for work. They were being patient with him, but the fact remained that their newly formed, adult lives were being cramped by his presence in a way that had never happened at school. No one needed to say it to make it true.
When Harry apparated home a fortnight later, he had known already that something was wrong. Being away had not been good; he had spent the past three days unable to catch his breath, occasionally drifting into full-blown panic. When he had Apparated away from the reports at the Ministry, he briefly wondered if he should go straight to St. Mungo's, but decided he was overreacting. After all, nothing had happened. He'd had no physical trauma. He was probably just tired and keyed up from the case.
"Do you know what I need from you Harry?" he asked. Harry opened his mouth to reply, but Draco held up a hand. "
,” Draco drawled. “That manager found a way to get stuck on the Isle of Wight over the weekend. In the middle of the winter. And you just so
“It’s in my pocket, just in case,” Harry teased, winking ludicrously and releasing Draco. “Alright, lead on. Take me to my certain doom.”
Hermione smirked at him, and read from the article again, and he groaned as Ron laughed in the background.
things. He revelled in it some more until Ron said one sunny day, "Mate. It's getting a bit weird, er, the mentioning every sense."
Harry bolted down the corridor, swinging the door open hard. Draco was dressed, his long coat slung across his arm as he tucked his feet into his boots. Harry ignored his jumbled speech of shock, his indication that he was leaving and would Apparate home and Harry could call him in the morning if he wanted. He tried to push past Harry through the doorway he was blocking. Harry reached out to stop him, managing to grab a corner of his coat. Spinning him around until his back hit the wall and turned the lights out surprised himself as much as it did Draco. Crowding into his space, pressing himself flush to his body, colliding in a kiss that meant so much more than it needed to and seared him to the core; these things were not surprising. They were good and right and perfect. He was not a fan of words. This was far more effective and far more enjoyable.
“So the new flat is ready, then?” Draco asked harshly, already knowing the answer. The new flat had been finished since the last week of November. And they both knew that he knew that.
Though, he supposed, it
He sensed Harry but did not see him until he came around the other side of the bed and stuck his head through the curtains there. “I’m going to kiss you goodbye now,” he announced, leaning down on the bed. Apparently, he was on his knees on the other side. “And I am going to keep kissing you goodbye until you stop being ashamed of me. I meant what I said last night.”
The return to the castle was more comforting to Draco than any job had ever been. Even the frigid wind and snowstorms could not drag him into a sulk. Everyone else was both stressed and confusingly lethargic. The darkness and cold of winter intermingled with the stress of exams and papers and too much marking. The post-holiday haze made everyone a touch more ornery than normal.
“Darling, we both know we’ve been done for a while. You deserve to be who you are really are, and we both know you can’t do that around me. You care too much about taking care of me.”
“Don’t you dare,” she said dangerously. “Don't you dare address me so informally. I am the matriarch of a noble house, and you are a
“Look at that,” he said. “Finally feels like Christmas.”
“Well,” he began. “Initially, clubs. But the bigger win was kissing goodbye, apparently.”
“What?” Harry said, confused.
“Sorry,” he dismissed. “Pickpockets. This area requires attention. So many tourists.”
me?” Harry fumed. "I’m not 'erasing progress'. I'm doing fine! What would you have me do, huh? Quit? Stay here and cook and clean for you like a fucking house elf?"
He did not feel better when he saw Draco and Harry sat at a table in the middle of the room and immediately realised he was overdressed.
Draco picked up the receiver on his phone the second his door clicked shut. Listening as Harry’s footsteps retreated down the hallway, Draco exhaled deeply and hung his head before dialling. He begged Pansy to be in the office the whole time the phone rang. When she finally picked up using her poshest
For reasons he would never be able to explain to anyone out loud, Harry always took the train when he left Hogwarts. He could convince himself that it was his dislike of the Floo, or that Apparition took too long because of the number of stops you had to take, but deep down, he suspected it had more to do with nostalgia than anything. Arriving at King’s Cross never seemed to lose its appeal, and if he was honest, the fact that it took several hours to get there was comforting to him. It allowed him to prepare for London, for the city of Muggles, for the loss of the bubble of safety that moving between the Castle and Hogsmeade created. It was a strange feeling to realise he didn’t really feel at home in the Muggle world anymore, what with all of his days being surrounded and engulfed with magic as they were.
“Why,” Potter asked suddenly. “Why do you want to help me?”
‘You’ve always needed that,” he said defensively.
“Don’t worry so much, Draco,” Harry chuckled. “I know what I’m doing. I’ll protect you.”
"We never really had the conversation after that,” Harry admitted. “Before I knew it, we just
Harry tried not to be distracted during his morning flying lesson on Monday. The snow was trying really hard to stick to everything, even in the sky, and the students were grumbling fifteen minutes in. It didn’t help that he didn’t want to be there either. He signalled for them all to land after another five minutes and gathered them all in a clump beside the change rooms.
The unfortunate reality now, however, was that it was impacting Draco’s currently limited social life, and he was very much Not Okay with it. Largely because it was extremely problematic to have your boyfriend locked in a silent battle with one of the few other people their own age within a hundred-mile radius.
“He’s aged. Has a dog.”
Disconcerted, Minerva had called Harry into her office to ask what Draco had done to him, or what Harry held over Draco.
The first few years of growing up pass by quickly for most people; there are moments that stretch out before you and feel like decades while they happen, but inevitably, the years pass you by without much permission to move as fast as they do. The times of trials and impossible things quickly disappear, and even when they were at their worst, the moments of exciting new things, the watching in wonder, it far outweighed the cost of the hard times.
“Well,” Harry said in a strangled voice. “I think I just said help me understand, but…”
Were naps normal? Were subdued emotions and careful choices and concerns about wards
“Harry—”
He turned and walked away, forcing one foot in front of the other until he was met with the relative warmth and brightness of the main road. It was getting busier as the morning progressed, and he leaned against the cold brick of the corner for a moment, breathing heavily. He pulled out his phone and dialled a number he hadn’t used in a very long time.
“So, why are you here, Mr Local Celebrity?”
what happened when you left us alone in England?”
Behind her back, Draco felt his arm get a light squeeze and smiled. He’d have time to regret this, one day.
happy Draco."
“I’ll tell Lily you got called into work. It’s fine. They’re here for the next couple of days anyway.”
“I’m going to kiss you now, unless you stop me. You can stop me, of course, but I don’t think I can deny that I want this much longer. You’re killing me slowly with that corset.”
"Cool. I can't wait for my first duel!"
She sighed, pouting in an exaggerated sadness that made him laugh. "Still gay, then?"
"Harry, you don't call me 'babe',” Draco interrupted. “It's clear you've been taking that potion again. Please sit up. I need… we need to talk. Well. No. Actually,
“Right, uh...well, fair. Anyway, I worked here, but despite being raised by Muggles, I never really got used to living with them, and I was just out of the war and the trials, and Hogwarts, really,” Harry rambled, looking nervous. “I didn’t exactly...do a great job of blending in.”
Audrey looked mortified, but Harry burst out laughing.
"What exactly are you doing?" Draco snapped.
"Not that you have to tell me," Harry added hastily. "Hermione doesn't exactly let just anyone into the house, so I'm sure you have a good reason, I was just—"
“Why don’t I just go get some food. We can eat here. The shops will be rammed so it’ll be a minute. Do you care if I just buy something easy? A quick bread, cheese, meat sort of thing? Or, I could go to the creperie just round the way. Up to you.”
"Hm,” Malfoy agreed.
“Look,” Owen said, making his voice as calm and reasonable as he could muster, drawing on years of experience negotiating for hostages. “What do you need me to do? Go up there, into the bank, right? I think we can all handle that. I won’t even make a fuss. I don’t want to be mixed up in this any more than—”
They sat down and for the next ten minutes of intro music, said nothing and refused to look at each other.
“I know?” Harry said, confused.
Draco didn’t know what to do with these moments. Moments where it almost seemed like he was being invited over, almost like he was being forgiven, accepted. He was reading pieces of paper and he was completely unsure what they meant. He knew what he
“You’re allowed to admit we’re friends, you know. I promise not to tell anyone.”
“Even the old families?”
right now. Going to make some soup.”
that he’d noticed these things.
Draco’s face lit up and it punched Harry in the stomach. “Oh my goodness, that’s right. You haven’t met her. Come with me.”
do you work here? Shouldn’t you be in jail?”
Draco moved forward cautiously, not looking up and already folded in a reverent hunch. He watched a large, talented paw dip smoothly.
Harry flushed slightly but he grinned. “Honestly? It’s mostly breakup food. I figured emotional eating is emotional eating, regardless of the cause.”
Draco was absolutely sick to the back teeth of being agreed with all the time; it made it very difficult to have a debate, impossible to make a tough decision when no one would weigh the pros and cons with you. Draco enjoyed the challenge, and fire. He had grown up in the Slytherin dorms, where wit and guile were the tools of the trade, where you learned to survive in the heat of verbal battle. He had needed kid gloves while he healed, but now he wasn’t so sure he could handle much more softness.
“Fine. But it’s true. There are loads of people who never manage to cast it.”
“He’s okay, you know,” Pansy said quietly. “It kind of sucks.”
Draco shrugged. “I just go where I’m sent. Got a comment for the story?”
“It’s me.”
“Not bloody likely. I’m hardly the ‘go back on my knees and beg’ type.”
“I’ll have you know, I liked you first.” Draco glared at Harry, who just smiled in response.
: Okay, seriously. I’m worried. I hate being worried. Don’t make me call your mother.
“I’m not going,” he said to himself, checking his watch.
After a restless night's sleep, he was pleased to feel the resolve still pulsing through him. He went to work that morning resigned to the fact that he wouldn't bother replying to Draco by owl. He would ignore it. When he saw him on Thursday, he would pretend nothing had happened. They could go back to their normal Thursday night routine, and everything would be fine. Harry went about his day, cleaning the club top to bottom, filing paperwork, finishing up some phone calls and paying bills. Generally, making the most of a client-free day at the office.
you imagine exists. You’re supposed to do something for yourself for a change.”
“Alright, enough. Take a break. Let’s go for a hike.”
“Hush,” Harry interrupted, holding up a hand. “So yeah, that’s my point. You and I
“Yeah, but,” Harry started. “Now it’s written down on paper and it just all seems way more…”
he replied. "But I really don't mind if you wanted this one."
Draco nodded. He felt the same way. He sipped his coffee and tried to get a handle on himself. It wasn’t like anything had happened. They sat in unpleasant silence for a while.
Harry wavered between a few emotions. Finally, he seemed to settle on shared amusement. He sat down at Draco’s desk, in one of the large wingback chairs he’d stolen from his parents' house without telling them. Harry Potter looked ridiculously small in the oversized chair; when he curled his legs beneath him, dropping his bag to the floor, he looked younger and more vulnerable than Draco had seen him since they were in school. He turned in his chair back to the coffee cart quickly, hiding his reaction to the sight before he let his emotions get the better of him.
“Don’t call me that, asshole,” Theo replied, ducking his head out of the kitchen and flipping him off. “How are you, Draco?” he added warmly, an afterthought that was probably related to Draco’s large grin.
This was ridiculous. This needed to stop. The man was engaged. The man was engaged and now technically his boss again, and more importantly, he was

“It definitely does. It’s not like he doesn’t have access to your
"Hermione, you are a Gryffindor. That's not a bit surprising," Harry laughed, happy for the support, but nervous nonetheless.
“I don’t know. It’s just standard wizarding practice. But the point is that those false bottoms have important stuff in them. Promise me you will retain that information, Harry.”
“Follow me?” Harry stammered, stopping in his tracks. “Who’s following me? Hermione, are there people following us?”
the kitten. I should have known. What exactly do you want from me, Potter?”
“Yeah.” Draco shrugged. “But you’re a decent friend. So I’ll help you.”
Older and yet unchanged, leaner yet even more sophisticated, lacking the youthful sneer that had so easily landed on his face yet now sporting a leery, untrusting stance.
"Neville's on his way over,” Draco said, pausing at the hall closet to pull out two large cases. “He's going to stay here with you a while. I don't trust leaving you alone, but I can't be the one to stay anymore."
Standing in the middle of all that you broke,
Staring at himself in the mirror, he thought about Diego’s banter with Potter at the coffee shop. He thought about the nicknames and the teasing, and the self-deprecating laugh he never used at home. What did it mean that he hadn’t known any of those things were even
She shrugged. “Also, your boyfriend is an ass. He hit on the coat check girl before he left.”
Lunch is as good a place as any to start correcting his mistakes.
“Do you want a drink?” Draco blurted. “I’ve just remembered that I was on a mission to the bar for Astoria and should probably continue in that direction before she finds me here distracted.”

“Oh, hey. Before you go. I, uh...ran into Harry yesterday.”
“Transfer finally went through. I am, officially this time, no longer an Auror.”
The surge in his movements was very complex; he was instantly out of control in a way that he’d never before experienced. His mouth was open as though he was going to explain, but instead, he crashed into Harry's chest first. As most humans would have, Harry stepped back with one foot, braced Draco by the arms, and opened
She shrugged. “Okay, fine, fair point. You are forgiven because of your cold. So...how did he look?”
“Merlin, no,” Draco laughed.
“You really didn’t have to—”
“Don’t fucking lie to yourself, Harry James,” Hermione insisted in a quiet hiss. She so rarely swore that he took notice and chuckled a little. “You know exactly what he wants. He showed up at my house six days before Christmas, with a wild expression and a wilder tale. You know he wants you back. Stop being an idiot and go get him."
. And, Harry was suddenly absolutely certain, he was gay as the day was long.
One day, in late October, Draco came into the living room, where Harry was admittedly not as present as he should have been. He had lost count of how many small sips he had taken that day, and he turned his body only vaguely at Draco entering.
"I'm fine," Harry muttered in response.
isn’t utterly pointless because I’m trying to arrest my father for murder.”
Near the end of their trip, they had been walking one cool, breezy evening down the beach. Mid-laugh, Draco had stopped dead and turned to face Harry.
“I’m not,” Draco said simply.
It's dumb, of course it is. He should have understood this about Potter's life. Fame is one step to the left of notoriety. Draco understands the latter more than anything else in the world.
“There’s Irish cream for coffee. It’s like...brunch.”
Harry graduated in a hilarious, prison movie style graduation ceremony, wherein Rabia made a speech, and Roy the slightly-less-Racist gave him the Velvet Underground discography on an actual CD (bringing him at least part way into the new century).
"What?"
of dark wood, except that it had been exorbitantly expensive, custom built, and had come out of a conversation about its design and construction which had bored Harry so much that he’d accidentally created small whirlpools at the feet of the designer, earning him a stern glare from Draco and banishment from the room.
“Now. If you’ll excuse me, gentlemen. Auror Weasley and his wife, and Mr Malfoy and I have a very important brunch to expense on company time.”
Ginny rushed into the kitchen, expecting to find him flat on the floor mid seizure, and burst into an amused grin when instead, she saw Harry’s stricken expression of existential crisis.
“Harry, this is your last chance. I’m taking the train now,” Hermione whined as she resettled her large book bag and bag. He took her duffle from her gently and shook his head.
,” he whined. He was calming down, which was unfortunate; any second now, he was going to start to cry, rounding out his day of embarrassing bullshit.
Ron raised his hands in surrender, but pasted an infuriating smirk on at the same time. Draco’s face heated and he swallowed back the anger that was stemming from his anxiety and embarrassment.
Malfoy was headed down a corridor toward him. “Potter?” Malfoy sneered, apparently unsurprised, disdain quickly settling across his smug face.
"You know you don't have to wear that thing back here, right? Her control of Christmas
And it hits him.
, remember?”
Auror.
“Nothing that bad,” Harry laughed. “But the Muggle owner who worked here got suspicious pretty fast about how I was managing to get everything done as quickly as I did. And then he started following me home and stuff. So, I sort of, um–”
“Do you think it’s the same for Muggle banks?”
“Get a grip, Potter,” he told the mirror. “You like this thing. You don’t care one way or another if he shows up. You look good. Get going.”
“Not until you agree to stop,” Malfoy hissed. “Can’t we just get through this year? I earned my place here, same as you.”
keep thinking about it, until suddenly he was sitting with Collette that week in his flat.
“Shh,” Hermione insisted.
“Nothing. Love you. You’re a giant sap and I love you.”
When he acts, he is fully committed. He is present and entirely aware of what he is doing. This means that when Harry’s back slams into the door behind him hard enough to rattle the window in its pane and something deep within him growls in satisfaction, Draco is completely aware of it happening.
“What?” Gloria replied, the glee in her voice badly hidden. “How did
Every time he saw someone else who looked at the world the same way he did, he would return to that eleven-year-old boy who stood in front of the Mirror of Erised. The one who felt sadness and hope in equal measure, the one who could see that he had friends and still felt entirely and completely alone. He would remember what it felt like to know the world really was not a great place and yet still want to be in it, want to hold onto it.
“Diego!” he called again, but the jerk just chuckled and shrugged, not even turning around this time.
—he was going to America to start over. He didn’t need their money, built on blood and bigotry and wrong ideas about magic. It may have taken him seventeen years to figure it out, but the world was flipped and twisted and it was in seeing the underbelly that Draco saw the truth.
“Abberlok,” Rose repeated.
For days, they did this; well, okay,
“Nope,” he shrugged. “These captains have no idea what they are doing. Luckily, that’s not my job. Not anymore. I just have to make sure they don’t die or break the rules.”
Harry, as everyone could see, was furious. He whirled around and began advancing, ever so slowly, on one, small, bald man, who seemed to already know what was coming for him.
He was holding two crates at once, trying to get done in time for lunch, when the greenhouse door opened.
“Except apparently when it isn’t.”
The sharp chill in his voice made Hermione cringe. He hadn’t used that tone in a long, long time, but he was hardly about to back down. He had lost his cool many hours ago. He wrenched Owen by the arm and up the steps towards the bank.
Draco’s head hit the table with an audible thunk. He really hated it here.
The kettle had just boiled when a sudden dinging shocked him out of his half-sleeping daze.
“Okay. So we need to talk,” he agreed.
toast, for crying out loud. I remember it so clearly. Something about how lucky we all were to be able to have second chances at love at first sight. I didn’t think about it at first, either.”
“I was outside. You didn’t have to hug me.”
“Trust me. I know how it sounds.”
“I really hate London,” he said by way of explanation.
The tip of his wand glowed, shooting a large circle of silver light, warm and comforting, into the clearing around them. It was so large that it illuminated all the trees at the edge of the forest. Harry could even momentarily see that there were daisies in the ground by his feet.
Harry had to finish today. He knew he had to. Hermione and Ginny would be there early Sunday morning to take the bags. Because he’d
For screaming and destroying. But it's time it was repurposed.
to worry about Potter?
"Ginny, it's not that simple—”
Her sharp gaze snapped to Hermoine. “Don’t ‘Ginny’ me. I want to know how many pieces of our best friend I’m going to have to pick up off the floor in an hour.”
There was a hitch in Draco’s chest when he shrugged as nonchalantly as he could. “You’ve nothing to apologise for,” he insisted. “It’s not like we had a date.”
Although, as he had drifted into darkness, he realized that it was easier this way. If he just didn't have to do it anymore. It hurt less, right now. It was just easier.
Potter crossed his arms and shrugged again, “Diego said you were stuck on some piece you’re working on. You needed a change of perspective.
“Jesus, Abe, shove off. I barely recognised him. Couldn’t place him for a minute, actually. Which was weird.”
"Harry? How much did you take?" Draco demanded, sounding very tired all of a sudden.
“Why does that not comfort me, Mr Malfoy?” she said warningly.
Harry sighed, remembering the struggle. Those first months had been intense. Perhaps even
He grinned a sickening, satisfied grin.
It didn’t matter that he didn’t understand how he felt.

He nodded into her familiar coconut scented hair and forced himself not to start crying. He’d cried enough tears in the past seven months.

“He’s not going to
prick,” Seamus corrected. “Who also had that whole ‘misunderstood broody heir’ thing going for him. And rich.”
“How’d it go? Did you both get all adorable and flustered like you used to?”
Harry nodded shortly. “Requires some sort of sacrifice or blood ritual, right?”
“Right,” he said stiffly. “First things first. I’m going to go ahead and hazard a guess that you haven’t involved the Aurors in your case yet. Am I right?”
It's complicated. Plus, more important problem."
The bottom drawer’s false bottom was always the hardest to release from it’s nest. It was built a bit too tight. Harry had only ever opened it once before, but Draco whined about it frequently. Harry had always teased him that maybe if he kept fewer secrets, the drawer wouldn’t annoy him quite so much.
“Marco is sort’ve...here,” Abe replied miserably.
managed to keep his word.
Harry panicked. “Every-I mean, I’ll usually find some friends inside and stuff but…fuck, Draco, sorry, I didn’t mean to imply this was like…a group thing?”
“Not if it’s because you’ve fucked around with his emotions!” she replied sternly. “Harry, I love you, but you haven’t exactly had the best track record for relationships lately.”
“What?” Draco sputtered, confused as to how he had lost this conversation so completely, and in such a short amount of time. He'd been ready to tear a strip off of Potter for messing with his coffee, but instead, he was just frazzled and confused.
With that, Potter waltzed from the office in a full billowing of robes; Draco beamed at the stunned Ministry officials and Ron saluted as they both followed Harry out of the office.
“I already regret inviting you two!” he called after Ron with a chuckle.
In retrospect, that bitter elixir that never did anyone any good, Draco had realised that something was wrong. He
Draco snorted and shook his head. “I might not stop you, to be honest.”
"Are you likely to do that?"
He nodded, glancing around to check that the room had fully emptied. "I wonder if we might discuss… a shift. In my appointment,” he murmured pathetically. “I, er, miss the field."
Different in the same way that an ember and blue flames were different; technically, they both burned, but one was far more dangerous than the other.
"No, no, not
"Ah. Right," Erica answered with a hasty wave of her hand. "The weird name."
Near his birthday, in the middle of a heat wave, Harry and Ron were assigned a new case in Leeds. It had seemed quite simple, if a bit sad and gruesome. A double homicide, although it was possible another case was linked. He had thought nothing of it as he packed a bag, and neither had Draco, who had kissed him soundly and made him promise not to miss his own birthday party. He and Ron had set off full of nervous excitement, the usual mood before a new case. They were gone for nearly two weeks.
Harry Appararenting into his bedroom, however, was an entirely different thrill. The second Draco’s feet were under him, Harry had him pinned to the door, warm hands lifting his t-shirt over his head without a moment’s hesitation. As much as he hated to admit it, they were well practised at this by now. They knew all the steps.
the sincerity he was suddenly feeling. “Try one more time.”
"Part six" he mumbles into Draco's lips as he presses down. "In which Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy probably should have just fucked in eighth year."
“I do,” he insisted, looking up at her. “I go out with people. I go on
She shook her head but did stop talking, in favour of holding out the reindeer pyjamas she'd just pulled down from the shelf. He took them, scanned them, and threw them in the box to the left.
“Draco,” he called, more deeply than loudly, hoping that his tried and true ‘I’m Harry Potter’ teacher voice would be enough to cause him to pause.
Harry stood stilted and unsure of himself in the middle of the display room. He knew how awkward he looked, and for the first time, it occurred to him that he had no idea what he was about to say. How does one introduce the idea of ‘my dead husband left me a riddle and told me to come find him’ without seeming completely insane? He looked desperately at Hermione, who clasped his hand firmly and did not let go.
“Yeah, whatever. Listen, I’m going to go outside and light a fire. Get a snack maybe. You can do what you want.”
; his hair was neatly combed, making the wild curls look intentional rather than insane. He wore a neat shirt, his coat open and his scarf hanging loose. He seemed to have acquired new, stylish frames for his glasses. All of this led Draco to the comforting conclusion that someone was taking care of him. Which, of course, brought his mind back to the
"Oh yes, your
The first time Draco had found the nerve to go out in Paris with the sincere intention of meeting someone, he’d nearly passed out from the nerves before he made it to a club. He’d made some friends at school, the way most people made first-year friends at uni; people whose names he’d taken the time to remember, then clung to in barely-disguised desperation. If anyone else had been doing something different, it might have been embarrassing.
He’d met Diego in the midst of a tailspin. He was running out of money, his flatmates had stolen all his gold family heirlooms, and he was quickly becoming something a Malfoy had not been in a very long time; broke.
Randomly placing compliments on an individual who you never see, and more importantly, who does not trust you, is not enough to convince them that they should date you. Particularly, Harry suspected, when that person also happened to be your former childhood rival.
Three days passed quickly. Draco did too much and too little, held Harry too tight and not long enough. He begged Harry’s sleeping form to hear him mutter words about the closet and the black box. Hermione’s memory had already been modified, fortunately not by him. There was no going back at this point. Hermione wouldn’t remember what she had agreed to until they wound up in Madam Malkins, and Harry wouldn’t wind up in Madam Malkins unless he followed the insane trail of breadcrumbs that had been laid before him.
what you know about my husband’s death.”
“I’m...no, okay, I see what you mean.”
Neville opened his mouth to speak, closed it again a moment later. Harry decided that maybe, what they both needed, was just action. It was only much later that he would reconsider his decision, here on this high street in Edinburgh, hoping that he wasn’t about to lose his favourite co-worker and a very good friend.
you,” Draco teased. “Calling me pretty, with those fucking eyes.”
“He doesn’t talk to me,” Harry replied simply. “You’d have to ask.”
They ate in silence for a moment before Blaise cleared his throat.
nice to have dry feet. And to be able to do his hair before he left the flat. And to not have to force the dog into the waterproof booties he hated.
Hermione sighed. “Draco,” she said imploringly. “If I go get him, are you going to make things worse for him? For me? Because honestly, it’s Christmas. I’d like to just...not do that. If this is going to cause more pain for anyone in this house —
“Yeah, I was going to ask about that, but then in the chaos of the paperwork, I never did. How did you manage that? My bank accounts and credit and—”
He picked up the takeaway cup again and grinned at Harry’s confusion.
His mother found a way to give him his inheritance and it had barely changed his life; he bought The Kitchen and endowed them for fifty years, then went back to living mostly on his Muggle income.
“W-what?” Harry stuttered.
He picked a pair of horribly off-coloured green antlers and headed towards the cash. The overly crowded shop had way too many shelves piled into every corner and he was in too much of a bad-morning induced haze to pay much attention; it didn’t surprise him, as a result, when he walked straight into a pram.
“I...I don’t think I’m supposed to say.”
The box.
Harry laughed again and jumped down. “What? Do you think Neville Longbottom is the sort to sleep with someone when they believe they’ve been coerced? Yeah, you really don’t know him.”
And they are small inside of yours
He knew it was technically more than that; the fact that he had spent many hours flirting with this man before he’d ever even considered fame, or the impact Draco had had on his world-changing career. But that stuff wasn’t really in play here. He wasn’t that person anymore, and he had no idea who Draco was now.
the worms.”
“Well, would you like me to innumerate with my Muggle boyfriend ten feet away?” Draco shot back, his own eyebrow hitting a familiar height as he crossed his arms to glare at Potter.
“Don’t even start,” Pansy chastised. “You waited until
“Customer,” she called back in a slightly strangled voice. Appropriately curious and possibly a little concerned, Abe’s head appeared around the corner of the door.
“Yeah, yeah. Okay. I sent them. Abe just needs to sign.”
family, then he is. Or if you need us to be furious and never speak to him again, that’s what we do.”
Poppy wrinkled her nose at him. “Disgusting,” she insisted. “I love it.”
Draco sat back down, and waited for the Highland sunset, his eyes prickling with un-shed tears and frustration.
For three more months, he thought he had done a decent job of pretending things were fine. He hid in the bathroom when he had panic attacks at home, slept in the guest room after Draco had gone to sleep if he felt a bad night was coming. He stopped talking about work at home and Draco seemed to appreciate the reduction in gruesome details of crime scenes. On the outside, his friends were fooled; Hermione regularly commented on how happy she was for he and Draco, how content Harry seemed all the time.
Well, no. Not gay. Pansy would kill him for saying gay.
“The wrong jacket,” he said dumbly.
Potter grimaced slightly, but nodded.
“What? Of course not, we love Hannah.”
When he showed up at the shelter before even Alex had gotten there, he had to admit to himself that he was maybe getting a bit too dependent on the busy days off. He’d worry about that after the holidays, though. Right now, he had work to do and a purpose. There were worse ways to spend his time.
"Harry," Draco said as they got into his bed. "Are you actually ready? I'm not kidding, the work is going to get much trickier from now on. Do you… was your training—"
"I have plans actually," he lied. "Just came home to change."
It wasn’t until the third closure that he’d worked out that something was wrong; almost at the exact same time, he’d realised that if someone else was accessing his accounts, there was likely Polyjuice involved, which meant the list of possible suspects was incredibly small.
“Draco,” he declared, sounding surprised.
Before he could stop himself, Draco snickered. The man looked at him questioningly as he approached. “Not usually,” Draco explained. “He’s not generally a fan of people…"
“Right, that’s me done for the day,” Draco whined, flopping onto the cushions on the floor beside Harry. “I can’t believe the sofa didn’t arrive on time.”
undisturbed by the nightmares.
The arm slung over him was possessive and warm, bundling him into Harry's side on the too-small guest bed in Hermione's house. It was too familiar, too real, too past. It was perfect.
"Do you really think we need wards?" Draco asked as he checked the hinges on the kitchen cupboards one more time.
’ phases. Not Draco's type at all, really. But it was hard to correlate Diego's beauty with his personality, once you knew him. He was the ultimate softy, a caregiver; it didn't match with the chiselled, blasé exterior— and even that was part of his charm. He was oozing in contradiction; the ass of a man who could expect to be worshipped, and yet with the personality of a saint.
“Harry!”
“You're reading too much into that,” he said sulkily. “It's just a crap song.”
“Sick,” Draco answered, his ears ringing and his splitting head pounding at the attempt to speak.
“Hm,” Draco said, trying to keep his tone disinterested. Flitwick looked at him and smiled. “Well, I just wonder if I should pay him a visit. Mock him a little… or offer some help. I did that my first term, too.”
After a moment of sitting in this pathetic tableaux, a sad smile pasted itself on Diego’s face as he let go of Draco’s hand. “You know, Draco,” he said. “You deserve to be the person you are around Harry as well.”
Draco tilted his head in response. He didn’t like being caught unaware.
“Okay, Potter. Out with it. Something is wrong.”
“What?”
“That, and...oh god, Draco. The things I’ve said about you in the past six months. I was
He had an alley to find.
Potter shrugged again.
“You know what, Marci? I am not sure I’m actually suited to a career with our illustrious leaders. Bit too much bureaucracy, not enough seeking of the truth.”
be marrying Astoria.”
“Draco!” Lily shouted, flinging herself into his arms. He calmly caught her and smiled a beatific grin as he slung her up into his arms. The sight sent Harry’s stomach rolling, his heart racing, and his blood boiling in anger.
Draco sighed. “You caught him, and now he can't hurt anyone else. That’s your
“Outside,” Molly said, bristling past him in an apron and brandishing a cup towel. He followed her out the still open door, ready to be told to never darken this doorway again. “Harry has already been here. I know the whole story. Give me a reason to believe you?”
The hate and anger have always made Harry sexy and alluring in very indecent ways, since Draco despised simpering affection or softness, preferred to have a bit of fight with his fuck. The only time Draco ever felt he was close to understanding Harry was when they had spent time together on the Quidditch pitch in years before. And that time is past.
“Well, obviously, you dolt,” she exhaled in exasperation. She chuckled and went to him, wrapping her arms around his waist. “Although, we aren’t keeping that ghastly flat. I know you boys are all very attached to it because of the weirdly sentimental
All through lunch, all through presents and Christmas radio, Harry hovered near-by. He never really touched Draco, which was noticeable only to him. Harry wasn’t clingy, not by a long shot, but he was also not usually distant. He would find touch-points to reassure Draco, not because he thought they needed them, but because he didn’t think of it at all. He’d find a touch of a toe on a socked foot, or Harry’s thumb, brushing his thigh. A bump of a shoulder as he moved passed in a corridor, or the straightening of a tie.
“What the hell!” Draco shouted over the banging and crashing and sparks.
Lucius Malfoy had a plan. Even from Azkaban, he would find a way to secure the happiness of his son and wife. If fighting for what had turned out to be the losing side had taught him nothing else, he had learned that you could not trust anyone else with your life. The meeting he was about to have had cost him dearly; finances were only the beginning. His happiest memories—his wedding, the day he’d been accepted at the Ministry, Draco’s birth—had become the food to the foul creatures that he now regretted allowing into the school.
—of these pixie infiltrations over the past six months—which, may I just remind you, have been under investigation by no fewer than four departments of dark magic. Those attacks can all be attributed to an infestation of fucking
Malfoy turned back, an awkward half-turn that screamed of his hesitation and uncertainty. “Yes,” he said finally, surveying Harry for a moment longer. “We can.“
“He was not.”
He followed them at a clipped pace, even when they walked through a brick wall and he found himself facing the garden of a very shitty looking pub.
“I—” Potter stared at the ground. “Thanks, Draco.”
"No, hear me out,” Ron chuckled. “It'll just be a laugh. You should try and… erm… seduce Malfoy."
But now, in the hope in Harry’s eyes, the embarrassment in his face, the fluster in his fidgeting fingers, Draco knew he had been right all along. And he was unable to contain his glee.
They’d end up in hysterics every time Draco finished a sketch, and Harry’s face was transformed into lightness and clarity, the weight of pretending to be someone else momentarily lifted. It made Draco wonder what living as a Muggle had done to his own personality, his own appearance. He hadn’t noticed, but it was hard to see small changes in your own face.
, at all. Have fun.”
“Just flooed. They’re freshening up in the guest room.”
“You really need to calm down, Draco,” Potter said softly, so that only he could hear. “I’m doing my best to give you the benefit of the doubt, you know.”
The coffee he drank was black and too strong, but he choked it down with the resolve of an ancient seer. He’d need every ounce of caffeine to survive sitting beside his father for the entire day. He picked up the memorandum before it got dripped on by the errant coffee pot, and found a note on the back, written in a familiar script, careful and neat despite the obvious afterthought of the message.
“Not Abe,” Draco clarified. “Potter. I offered him his job back.”
"Hermione," he whispered. "I don't expect forgiveness. I'm honestly not sure he'll even see me. But I have to try. I have to — he needs to know what happened. Because I—"
It wasn’t until five hours later, itching from head-to-toe with anxious energy at the announcement that the terminal station of “London King’s Cross” was approaching, that he realised he had spent the entire day sitting behind the man and the black box.
“Harry,” Hermione warned.
“You have direct evidence that The Mage exists. So yes, you are. Now, what else do you want to add?”
It was. Draco turned around slowly and glared at him; the maliciousness in his face was from another time as well, so much so that it almost took him aback.
Carl looked dubious.
Even if Harry tolerated him more now, they had resolved exactly none of their issues. Not to mention the fact that on top of being Harry Bloody Potter, the man was the boss of his ex, which added a level of difficulty to a situation that really didn’t need more complications. So, he was just stuck, in an endless loop of clumsy flirting and cinnamon, feeling unhinged and desperate.
Draco swallowed. Harry had a large, fake pearl necklace peeking out of the collar of his coat. His collarbone was bare and jutting out. There was little doubt in his mind who Harry had come dressed as. He’d only watched this bizarre movie for the first time an hour ago, he knew a sweet transvestite when he saw one.
“Doll, Abe has been working for you for—“
“Draco,” Harry replied calmly, proffering a large bag and picking one up from the porch where he’d evidently put it down. “Do you mind? These are heavy and I walked from the tube.”
Draco was very much aware of how tiny his pants were.
The conversation over, Draco retreated into their bedroom and refused to come back out.
His plans had not anticipated Harry Potter. They hadn’t considered an impassioned speech, on behalf of him and Pansy, Theo, even Blaise. How the Slytherin’s found in the castle had fought for the right side, in the end. How they had staved off the final moments until he’d been around.
. Draco’s mind spun. He knew, he supposed, in some corner of his mind, that the weasel and spouse had procreated. This must be the product. He consciously prodded himself to respond. He reminded his brain that he
“Listen to this one; a bezoar is for being a bezoar in potions for poisons. Essentially? Right. But semantically? Painful.”
things, because, at that point, I just want to freaking pin you down and not let you up until I’ve wiped the smirk off your face. With my mouth. Which is really complicated, isn’t it?”
comes.”
Carl laughed and swung himself forward, capturing Draco in his arms with light and humour in his eyes that had been missing for months. "Then I assume you need a drink," he teased, leaning into Draco.
"I forgot you were like walking beside a Spaniel."
"Yes, well, I already told you. It's going to be stronger for you. Without magic, you can't feel where it was intruding. It's going to take some time to sift through what was real for you. Which is why," Draco reiterated. "You. Can't. Be. Here. You're making this really hard. For both of us."
Harry laughed. “I think I’m doing that to myself. It’s hard, isn’t it? When an old crush pops up out of nowhere. I’ll pay more attention though, I promise. I’m sorry, for what it’s—”
Draco winced, scrubbing his face and curling his legs up around him as he pulled the blankets to him; he was likely cold. He was always cold.
“I can’t believe Professor Lewen is making you stay,” she huffed.
“Now please leave me to my parapet,” he declared, hoisting himself up.
Ron had scribbled the address of Harry’s flat on a scrap of a memo about floor cleaning charms, and Draco had clutched it so hard it was barely legible by the time he found the blue front door in Maida Vale; it was way nicer than he’d anticipated.
“So, go out with me.”
“Ow,” he said sheepishly. “Fine. Maybe a little? But only because...Hermione, you didn’t see this kiss.”
“How could he do that?” Narcissa had muttered, over and over again.
“We’ve solved the pixie mystery,” he announced loudly, startling Harry bolt-upright. “You two both need to get into the Ministry, right now. There’s a debrief in Malfoy’s office in fifteen minutes.”
"Amanda—"
Winter was where shit really hit the fan. January in London, Harry decided, was possibly the worst time and place to exist as he was; the days rolled by slowly and he didn’t know he was still alive. He was barely breathing, barely conscious most of the time. The outside seemed to be perfect pathetic fallacy. More days than not, a persistent cold drizzle bore down on them, the grey in the sky impenetrable by the weak winter sun. When Harry arrived at work, it was still pitch black. When he left, the darkness had returned. Daylight, when it did occur, was not something he saw.
Potter had the grace to chuckle. “One of what? The sort that likes to be fully apprised of the words hurled at him in a language he doesn’t speak while being accosted by a man who used to jink him in school?”
“You don’t know that.”
But the sleeping potion was only slightly stronger than the ones Draco had been making him at home. Soon, he was taking twice as much as he’d been prescribed. He ruefully smiled at himself in the mirror on the second time he doubled the dose.
,” Harry insisted, sitting heavily in his chair and staring firmly at Draco until he looked at him. “Yesterday you couldn’t make sparks. That was very nearly corporeal. That is so much better than
“Have you read the paper yet this morning?” Hermione asked as she flew into the kitchen.
Draco scrubbed a hand through his hair and sighed. “I’m going to get coffee,” he announced.
Draco groaned and dropped his head to the table in defeat. This, it would appear, was happening.
Not to mention the fact that Draco wasn’t fully himself either. Whenever he felt himself get too angry, he’d leave the flat. Whenever he was in a terrible mood, or when the nightmares returned, he’d just hide. That couldn’t be right, could it?
Harry, just not as much as he loved Carl. It had taken him six months of feeling ill as he fell asleep to dig deeper and figure out what had happened.
He laughed again, but her brow creased and she leaned forward to fold him into her arms.
“The answer was to die?”  Harry replied robotically.
“Alright, love?” a kind lady said behind him. “You forget the pattern? No worries, think Tom changed it this month. Here, let me.”
Harry sighed. "Guess so."
He watched the blond putter by the closet for a moment, putting things away, getting ready for the morning before he went to make dinner. The whole thing seeped in routine and normalcy, and it made Harry's heart swell happily. Clearly, he had just needed to come
, trying to get us to meet.”
"Tell me who he is first,"
“Third floor. Second door after the Charms room,” Flitwick said kindly.
Draco chuckled, pouring himself a coffee and kissing Harry on top of the head. “Does too. I remembered all on my own! It’s like all past transgressions are—”
“I know,” she smirked. “Harry, you know that it took a lot of work to let Draco in the first time.”
Still, he sat through the board meeting and the shareholder’s session at the bank, survived a stuffy lunch at his great aunt’s club, and made it all the way through the library tour where the new wing would be dedicated the following month. He saved up all his quips and jabs, kept his mouth shut and didn’t ruffle feathers.
’ look on his face, and it was making Draco very nervous.
“Potter and Prose,” Draco smirked. Harry flinched slightly, and Draco felt a tiny thrill of success. He didn’t mean to be like this, callous and a little bit cold, but it came so naturally and brought him so much joy.
, but then, I told you about the whole ‘I’m bi’ thing, and you came down to tell me that Hannah and I were a good decision regardless, but the spores had already attuned to me. When you breathed them in that day last month, you...well, regardless, you don’t actually want me.”
“I do.”
. It's good, Harry.”
“Draco, better than
From the tiled floor to the chipped cupboards, this room still felt like home, but when he opened the cabinet where the coffee had always been, he found plates instead and sighed.

“Well, you
"Why aren't you asleep? It's late," Harry said. Realising that was completely the wrong question, no matter how happy he was to see a sleepy, crumpled Draco at two in the morning. He wasn't really allowed to ask that question, not now. He shook his head at himself. "Wait. No. Why are you here? More important."
"I'd very much appreciate it if you would Apparate us to the museum," he continued. "I promise to leave you alone once we're there. I'm quite content in museums. You don't have to be a tour guide the whole time we're here."
feel guilty for not having messaged Harry earlier.
"Raoul, Obliviate him. Tie him up just in case. I think we need to go to Diagon Alley.
Draco froze and spun around. “Look, I don’t know what’s going on with you, but we aren’t friends. Have you forgotten that? We aren’t friends and you don’t owe me anything.”
Draco smiled a small, private smile. “I know. Sorry. It’s just. I don’t know. You’re surprising, Potter.”
“For fuck’s sake, Potter. Do you not think that in all this time I haven’t had someone
“I can facilitate the conversation?”
"Oh dear. Wait a moment," he sneered. "Did you say
“Where’ve you been?” he asked gently, his signature quiet tone making her bristle.
,” Draco said, pulling back to look at him straight on. Grey eyes and silver hair in the moonlight. Convictions and understanding, an inability to back down. A past and a present, a future they’d both secured. In other words,
“Yup,” Harry replied with a grin. “What I’m
She smirked at him "Sure. Sure it is. Did you forget your apron?"
“And they didn’t fire you,” Diego said, an intriguing hint of irritation in his voice. “Miraculous. Harry, will you change this bloody music? It’s depressing.”
“Did you not get a scone? They’re fresh,” Harry said, hanging up his coat, putting on an apron, and robotically handing Draco a plate.
“Sorry, Professor Lewen,” he murmured as the old witch tutted at him. “Need to try again. I’m just going to run to the loo and give it another go.”
"Well,” Harry said, “it's not really what I was expecting."
"No. I’ll take it. It's perfect.”
"Potter,” he declared. “Not surprised you don’t recognise me. We weren’t even really acquaintances. In fact, I think we may have been enemies, even if you didn’t know it.”
He spent the rest of the day in his room at the pub, trying and failing to fall asleep in the middle of the day.
Harry saw Draco.
To be fair, that was Malfoy’s fault; he was sitting behind the big counter of the lab in a red satin button up, the top two buttons loose and his blonde hair wild from being hunched over a cauldron all morning. He looked so very much like Riff in this moment that the idea was organic and feeing. Harry could practically feel the moment when Draco would let go of the tension in his shoulders when he’d understand how to scream asshole at the screen at the right moment. How he’d lean into Harry and…
Saturday morning found Draco warm and cosy and unwilling to move for anything; the blanket was the perfect weight and Harry, though not quite touching him, radiated just enough heat to be a steady presence.
"Harry," he finally said slowly. "Don't… don't panic, here, but I'm going to suggest that perhaps we don't spend the day inside the museum."
Harry spent the next hour unpacking but found himself bored witless by half-ten, just as he had predicted. Making a split-second decision, he threw on his old house scarf and headed down to the lake.
Draco looked at him and opened his mouth several times.
“Look, Draco, I don’t know what you’re implying here, but –”
“Certainly,” she said, that annoying sympathetic tone that he hated more than any other creeping into her posh politeness. She was subtly staring at him behind downcast eyes, barely looking at the cheque; her neck was already bright red, and he assumed that beneath her heavy makeup, she was also blushing.
“Travers. I owe these people far more than my life. So yes. Besides, I’m not at risk. Harry will figure it out.”
a chance for you there.”
“If I don’t sell it, they’ll get it, too. It’s…it’s too important to me to keep it.”
“Should be.”
“You work with who I tell you to work with.”
“Neville, Neville, Neville,” Draco murmured with a lascivious chuckle. “Do you really,
“Come in and close the door. The baby is sick,” she declared, clipped tone and intolerance dripping from her. Clearly, the invitation inside was not a surrender, and Draco did not treat it as one.
“Neville,” Harry teased. “You don’t get to tell me what I want.”
“Do you actually have them every night?” Draco asked softly.
“Yes, thank you Lil, I am not so old that I am deaf,” Ginny said wearily. Harry saw her stretch off the couch and pad toward the door as he walked back to the living room with their mugs.
Draco began furiously shaking his head. "No," he insisted. "That was me, being a twat. Me, protecting the wrong thing. As usual. We, you and
don't remember Draco from school. Just prepare yourself. He takes some getting used to, as well. But, unlike that trash you're wandering around with, he's worth it.”
, but he could hardly say anything about it. Harry had to sit close, or he’d fall.
since they owned their home, both made salary, and both had more money in the inheritance than a childless couple was going to need.
“Only when asked,” he teased, winking at Neville without meaning too. Sometimes, when he was in this mood, the winking got a bit out of control. Neville shot him an interesting look; part glower, part...something else. If he didn’t know better, if it weren’t Neville, he’d assume it was interest
“Hey, Draco?” Harry interrupted. “I forgot something.”
Bill bid him farewell, still looking a little concerned for his safety, and Harry wandered out into the now completely pitch black street, despite the fact that it was only just dinner time.
“Hare!” George called jovially when he spotted him. “What the heck are you doing here!”
“He was more than a nothing, though. He lived with him, Pansy.”
Draco pushed his hair back, surveyed the tents, then nodded once and followed.

“Well, I mean...hang on. Is this a baby accessible bad thing?”
"This is definitely it," he said firmly to the agent.
He spent the entire second half of his evening pretending he
, Draco?” he asked the room, scrubbing his hair. His hands had no marks, but the pain of the flames lingered mentally, like some sort of invisible curse.
He slept horribly in Tom’s very lumpy bed and was awake before the sun, let alone early enough for his breakfast with George. He decided to get up and grab a coffee at one of the stands he’d seen with pastries the night before, then go for a stroll in the park just outside Diagon. He’d be plenty hungry again before long, and his head needed to be occupied for a few minutes. He slipped on his coat and gloves, shoving his recently acquired mobile phone into his pocket on impulse. He rarely carried it; there was no signal at school, and when he was home, he was almost always with the four people who had his number. Still, leaving Hogwarts, he always shoved it in his bag out of habit and bringing it with him now made him feel slightly more secure, though he couldn’t exactly say why.
But he heard his own voice, knew he sounded nothing like himself. And even
Sure enough, Potter’s face darkened imperceptibly. No doubt, he was reliving the night in the forest, just as he himself had been all month. It's hard to forget your first unicorn sighting anyway, but to see one the way they both had was...
Despite his very intentionally calm tone, Draco held his breath, bracing for the backlash. It was reckless to remind his father that he couldn’t actually
“Listen, Potter. It’s over. Let it go.”
He took a deep breath and consulted the list;
every time she thought he couldn’t hear him. He could play with them and laugh and joke, and it almost looked like he was himself again.
“What?” Harry demanded. “Who is this?”
He hadn't meant to drink it all.
"Mariah."
“It’s alright, Harry,” she said gently. “It’s not been lost on me that something is weighing on your soul these past few weeks. The school will continue to function in your absence, I assure you.”
She found him in the back, frantically searching his locker, which did
Draco didn’t hear from Pansy for three days. Other people may have worried about this, agonised, even. Not Draco. Draco Malfoy was not one to agonise over a boy, nor was he worried about his friend. If she wasn’t calling him, it was just because she was busy. Or finding his number. Or…something.
The entire room erupted in laughter, pushing Draco to grin into his wine glass, eyeing Harry and begging him silently to join him. When Harry was settled beside him, Draco glanced over and subtly shuffled his leg into contact with Harry's.
“Sod that,” Harry replies, reaching behind him with one hand to open the door and dragging Draco inside with him with the other. “I can starve, I don’t even care. Inside.
Harry grinned. “Not taking that bet. It’s inevitable,” he replied. “What do you reckon? Worst convocation speech in history?”
Voldemort was gone. He was the reason Voldemort was gone, for Merlin's sake. Allowing himself to still be afraid meant that the evil had won. Voldemort would have liked nothing more than to know that he was still feared, even after his death. So Harry would be angry that he was allowing these thoughts into his subconscious, and consequently feel like he couldn't confide in anyone. The cycle was vicious. It was lonely. It was exhausting.
“I mean, he sort of found me, to be honest, and—”
Harry chuckled, pulling pack. “Thank you. What was that for?”
“I appreciate your patience as I got the last loose ends tied up,” Carl replied coldly.
"So I can buy you a drink, then?" he asked carefully.
Draco bit back the retort he wanted to use again; he didn’t actually know why that kept happening. He cleared his throat.
“Are you sure about that?” Draco mused. “Sounds awfully like a terrible excuse to me.”
"What do you want, Potter?" he demanded suddenly.
The next thing Owen knew, the wall behind him had caved in with the great crack of an explosion and an unfamiliar haze of purple smoke. He looked around, dazed, and quickly realised that whatever had happened had knocked out both his captors. He didn't hesitate a second more. He dashed over their prone bodies and out the door.

“Well, thank fuck for that,” Ginny’s harsh voice said from the open door. “Are you two morons ready to come back inside? Lily has a present for you, Draco, and apparently Albus has made extra waffles because you love them. We don’t really have time for sappy reunions. We have to be at the Burrow in two hours. Can you two sort out the finer details of your stupidity tomorrow?”

Barkley crowded up onto the sofa, shoving Larry out of the way just enough that he was right beside Draco.
“The car is already waiting for you on the street, you dolt,” she called back at him from the third set of stairs. “Honestly. Learn to be famous. Idiot.”
She looked at him sadly but didn’t argue. “I… I’ll put it through, if you insist. But. Draco, one thing before you go?”
Draco batted at Harry’s chest with no force and glanced up at the lights again. “It’s because they’re so cheery,” he insisted.
“Hey,” Harry whispered against his lips, gripping the back of Draco’s neck. “Hey, I’ve got you.”
“I don’t need to hear anything to know what you’ve done. The war is over Malfoy.”
“Um…I mean…”
“Well, I can wake him
"So sorry,” Draco called out. “He’s mine. Got away from me."
Harry shook his hand, nodded once, shouldered his bag, and spun into Apparition without another word.
“Did you think I
“She—“
Seamus and Dean managed to exchange a not so subtle glance that even he managed to see.
“Harry,” Madam Malkin announced in a reverent whisper the second she stepped out from behind the curtain to the back room. “Oh Harry,
“I’m...serious, Harry. You should check. Um.
And the confusing reality that his dead husband’s owl had delivered a note about an utterly baseless connection to the man who was now rightfully trying to flee.
The flash of fear that crossed his mind was embarrassing, so instead, Lucius simply shook his head slowly. The man nodded, opened his briefcase, and took out a form. After glancing around fervently for a moment to double-check for the guards or the dementors, both of whom were absent thanks to a tidy sum paid by Narcissa, he slid a contract through the bars. The quill that followed was ostentatious and irritating, but Lucius signed quickly without reading too closely. He knew what was there already; unrestricted access to the house for both the council. A commitment to three years of back pay to The Mage through his wife’s accounts. Power of Attorney passed to Marica and Josiah Avery indefinitely, and a new clause in his will that stated Draco was only to inherit at the time of his death.
They were made of fire, both of them. There were arguments over how and when money should be spent. They had different views on what city and jobs one could live in comfortably, and how long a Floo to work was what you could consider acceptable.
“Theo is not a part of this.”
The tiny hippogriff clung carefully to it’s father’s back legs, downy fluff still stark against its haunches.
"Harry, my only worry..." Hermione started. He braced himself for the onslaught he had known would come. "Are you sure about running the place all on your own? It seems like an awfully big job, and Luna can't stay forever. She has to go back to running
on repeat. It might not actually
Barkley’s head turned in that way that made Draco’s insides melt and he sighed. “Fine. I didn’t mean it. But listen, you’re going to have to tell me what he said to you.”
Three months later, that confidence had completely disappeared as Harry stood in the nursery of the maternity ward, looking down at two small, wriggling things in the same small cot, calm and clinging to each other with one hand.
"Darling, stop this. It's just a tad… pathetic? You obviously like him. I have a feeling it started to be obvious to you around Halloween? I know it's messy and stuff but honestly. What the hell is the point of living through what we did if we aren't going to get a little messy?"

destroyed.
“Your mother will be along shortly,” Lucius interjected, ignoring Draco.
When he got home, he did better for the summer. He saw his therapist three times a week, stopped the sleeping draughts. He was trying very hard to see all the lights at the ends of all the tunnels, and Draco was back to his former self. For those warm, sunny months, life seemed brighter. Lighter. Almost perfect.
She sat up suddenly and threw a pillow at him. “Okay. Enough of this. You know the whole story. Now we plan. In the meantime, I’m going to go down to Hogsmeade. Want to come?”
“Ohmygod, ohmygod. Okay, be cool Audrey.” She muttered to herself a few more times before she stuck out her hand at a very direct angle. “Audrey. Never meet famous people. Not gonna make it weird, your music is great, I’m sad you’re leaving, thanks for coming in, is there anything I can help you with.”
He didn’t exactly have a
Confusingly, Ginny's plan seemed to be an annoyingly regular presence in his life. She started by making small, bizarre requests for help. It started with mundane tasks that she obviously did not actually need help with; she would show up at the house requesting company while she went to the bank, or help to babysit Rose and baby Hugo, or to be her buddy on adventures into muggle London.
“Thanks for forcing this,” Draco murmured against her shoulder.
“What issues?” Draco said eyes narrowed.
Malfoy,” Harry growled.
Amanda saw him first; this was almost inevitable, to be honest. Amanda had seen Draco first after so many years and moments and he loved her for her complete lack of subtly in moments like this.
She sighed at him and drank the rest of her drink in one gulp. “I’m getting another round. Anyone else?”
“You are a
“Hm.”
He fell asleep with tears crusting his eyes and his pants balled up on the floor beside him.
He wasn’t.
"And two," he continues, "we get the fact that I want to pin you down and snog you out of the way right now. Or else I won't be able to focus on the apology you plan on crafting."
“Me too,” Harry said seriously. Draco turned one eye to him and burst out laughing. “What?”
Draco looked at him, baffled. “Well...yes, but I mean...it isn’t a case. There’s no crime—”
when you read it. He’s in his second term here.”
Harry sighed. Of fucking course. That made perfect sense, really, given how his year was currently going. Shivering in the November wind, he shoved the envelope and the paper into the inner pocket of his robes and stalked darkly back up to the castle.
“What do you mean, Ginny?” Harry hissed. He wanted to take the tone back, he really did. But something in the question made him feel extra insane, and he was honestly all out of the ability to care. He was being accused of something.
Draco smiled sheepishly, then summon his courage before asking, “Sorry, Filius. Just been a long week. I wonder, have you seen Professor Potter this week? Haven’t seen him around.”
Diego was relatively jovial throughout the entire
They sat beside each other in the picture of perfect happiness. Both wore banal smiles, suffused with warmth and comfort. Harry had his hand loosely wrapped around Draco’s, resting haphazardly on the table between them as his mouth moved, telling some sort of story that was making Draco chuckle. He wore a dark blue henley, the top button undone, and his curls ran wild around his face.
"W-what?"
Granger,” Draco hissed.
“Draco!” Harry shouted, drawing him close and screaming directly into his ear so that he could be heard over the thumping beat of the music. “It’s too loud in here! I’m tired!”
. But…”
Malfoy whirled around, shouldering his broom and storming towards Harry in such a sudden change of direction that Harry stepped back defensively on instinct alone. “Same thing you are, idiot!” Malfoy roared. “And I’d like to know
“It’s where you met him first. When we were eleven. Merlin, Harry. He used to talk about that all the time. It was in his
Draco nodded. "I'm sorry, but yes. Compulsion."
“Well,” Ginny answered with predictable defensiveness. “I mean. We had a funeral for him, Harry. The Ministry declared his death an accident. Because there was an investigation.
“Love spores.”
“I...I’m sorry,” he finally muttered. “My family are…”
“I know,” Harry said, saving him even though he had planned to let him flounder. He deserved to flounder a bit, but it was Christmas and Harry was feeling charitable. “I know, Draco. So what are we going to do about it? I already told you, I can’t do this if you are going to run every time things get hard.”
Lou nodded, looking down at her clipboard. It didn't matter. Harry had spent a lot of time studying her expressions. As he had known she would, she had immediately picked up on what he
He didn’t
He meandered slowly down the busy street, stopping at many of the Christmastime vendors that always ended up popping up out of nowhere around December 1st. He knew many people despised these tinkers and traders, whose bizarre wears were not usually genuine or particularly useful, but Harry happened to love them. They highlighted the season for him, their carts full to bursting and decorated with tiny lights, occasionally containing real faeries that had been bribed into providing their light for an evening. The general hubbub of Diagon was increased threefold by their presence, and Harry felt lightened by the general atmosphere.
But no one seemed to badger Potter. It infuriated Draco.
If there was a set of guidelines for the practice of living with one's colleague in a different country, Draco had never gotten his copy. He certainly didn't know what was expected of him as Potter pulled a large, old key from his rucksack and let them into the gate at the front of the ancient building and led them up three flights of stairs.
with me anymore? Draco, I don't know what you want me to do. I'm working. It's my job!"
"Well, strictly, no," said Harry, shrugging his shoulders. "I'd rather just take you home and… to put it politely, jump your bones. But society has taught me that most people aren't huge fans of that direction. I'm completely cool with it if you are, though."
He knew, before Harry even voiced the thought, what had happened just now. The problem was that he was struggling to believe it, to comprehend.
he loved Wednesday off so much.
And complicated.
"Malfoy, I can assure you that I know you aren’t up to anything. My boss is always singing your praises; apparently, you champion even the most hopeless of cases? Make sure they get a fair sentence?” Harry listed all the things Malfoy was known for in the upper corridors. It was baffling, but for some reason, Harry already believed these things. He shrugged. “By all accounts, you are very good at your job."
Since he had only ever played in the dark hidden corners of the castle, on an ancient piece of shit with plastic strings that constantly went out of tune, he knew very little about the technical side of music. He supposed he’d gotten pretty good, using books of old Beatles tunes and
With four days left and only images of scones and coffee cups on the page, Diego made some crack about how productive Draco looked in the quiet shop. Draco had no choice but to throw his sketchbook in retaliation. Irritatingly, Diego was quick and he caught it deftly, laughing heartily, drawing attention to them.
Harry huffed. “Fine. What is it, then?”
Draco said this last sentence all in a rush, as though he had been avoiding it. Harry laughed; he was rested and happy and so the entire conversation only resonated in Harry's brain as excessively adorable worry from his ever-concerned boyfriend. He kissed Draco's forehead, promised he would tell him if things got worse, and then dragged him bodily, kicking and screaming, into the surf. They finished their week gloriously, Draco shoving too many souvenirs for Hermione and Ron and their kids into his carry-on.
“No, I just… I miss you, you know. I know you come home and stuff, but it always feels like we don’t see each other when you’re at work. And here I am, not home when you’re off. It’s stupid of me to waste the time.”
"You feel better?" He asks hopefully. "A little," Harry replies halfheartedly. "I want to be a real boy," Harry whispers wishfully. "You are a real boy Harry," Draco protests. Harry shakes his head, "Look at me," he pleads sadly. "I see a handsome boy," Draco muses then gets out his wand and casts a charm chopping of Harry's long hair. "There," Draco tells him smiling. Harry's eyes widened and he ran his fingers through his hair relieved. "I will help you, sweet boy," Draco tells him.
Harry and Draco get some unexpected and very disturbing news
AN: This chapter has been rewritten and combine with an alternative version posted on Amino.
"Professor, I have some requests to make on my and my mate's behalths," Draco said using the distant, authoritarian voice his father was known for. Harry curled into his boyfriend's side, trying to disappear. "Now what can I do for you, Mr. Malfoy, Ms. Potter?" the professor regarded her students curtly, she had a welcoming feast to get to after all. Draco glared holes through McGonagall's head when he heard her refer to his Harry as miss. Harry flinched slightly as he always had when people misgendered him. "Harry," he corrected in a soft nervous whisper, "Mr. Potter," Harry said with a bit more confidence. McGonagall nodded, face still expressionless with her mouth in a thin line as was her normal, "I apologize Mr. Potter, now will I be assigning you to the boys' dorm or should you request bonded quarters?" she asked getting to the point without missing a beat. "Shared," Draco replies confidently. Harry blushes a little, Draco squeezes his hand tightly. "I want to be resorted," Harry tells her nervously. McGonagall nods and places the hat on Harry's head. Finally the hat says in Harry's head, now you see I was right last time you belong in, "Slytherin," the hat screamed. Harry smiles and Draco hugs him tightly.
Ariana Lily Potter was looking for an empty compartment, preferably far away from Ron and Hermione. She was ready to cut of her hair, change her name--his name...He thought, trying out the new pronouns in his head. He felt a warm fuzzy feeling in his stomach and he smiles. Harry, Harry James Potter he thought as he took a deep breath and opened the door of the nearest compartment. Harry was quite distraught by the time he found his way to an empty compartment on the train and curled up in the ball letting the tears stream down his cheeks as he waited for Draco Malfoy who would surely find him a disgusting freak once he knew the truth. Harry wouldn't lie. He couldn't keep living a lie and if this man was going to be his mate--tied together for life; he would have to be honest even if it meant heartbreak. Harry found and empty compartment and curled into a ball, letting his tears run down his cheeks.
Harry was overwhelmed. Overwhelmed with pain. Overwhelmed with need. Overwhelmed with fear. Harry felt dizzy, head spinning. "Need to lie down," Harry mumbles, vision going blurry despite his glasses. "May we be excused from the feast?" Draco asks the stern headmistress, knowing it was his duty to protect his submissive. "You may," she agreed after a moment of consideration, she hands them a paper with directions to their quarters including both their password and the main Slytherin password for the common room.
Harry gets up and runs to the front of the train opening one of the teacher’s compartments to find a short man with brown hair and eyes who was deeply engrossed in a book.
At Malfoy Manor (a month prior):
Harry and Draco on the Hogwarts Express, bonding, hurt/comfort, protectiveness, fluff
“What about your betrothal...” Harry asks, not keen on sharing his Draco. “I cannot break the contract without my father’s permission until I turn seventeen,” Draco explains a bit disheartened. “That’s stupid!” Harry practically shouts, “How can you a thirteen year old boy be engaged to a twelve year old girl?” Draco let’s out a soft halfhearted laugh, “I doubt you want to be lectured on pureblood traditions, but I can tell you a few things that might reassure you slightly. First a betrothal isn’t an engagement. A betrothal is only an official contact between families for political alliances. The contract is to ensure that should either child in the match become an orphan before age 16, the father of their betrothed will adopt the child as his own which would nullify the betrothal. The goal of the contract is to secure the futures of each family’s bloodline. Marriage is not the primary goal though many betrothals end in an engagement and eventual marriage. If the match is incompatible then either party may end the contract upon reaching the age of 17. The parents or guardians may also end the contract at anytime before either member turns fifteen. Between fifteen and seventeen both the parent and child on one side or the parents of both children must agree to nullify the contract.
Harry blushes a little at the thought of being pregnant. "I would like to have a family with you when we're older, I feel uncomfortable about the idea of being pregnant," he says sheepishly. "Harry, I would never force you," Draco assured, arms tightening around Harry. "I don't really understand a lot about what being mates means and how the magical world feels about trans and gay people because I was raised by muggles," Harry admits. "Mates means soulmates, destined to fall in love. Lady Magic chooses our soulmates the moment we are conceived, though until age 16 we don't know who we belong with. As for sexuality and gender, we are far different then muggles. No one in the wizarding world cares or judges anyone for being gay, lesbian, bisexual, asexual, or other orientations, apart from pureblood heirs who are expected to marry opposite sex and produce heirs for their lines. As for your being trans it is not exactly common or widely discussed, however there are various treatments which can help your body develop more like other boys and it is considered extremely rude to misgender or deadname anyone when you know better. The professors will help other students learn to address you and show respect. Hogwarts and the ministry have policies and laws to protect trans wixen," Draco told him in an effort to help his mate's confidence. Harry's relief was palpable.
“My father would disown me for being gay,” Draco admits sheepishly. “Why?” Harry asks, grimacing as he thinks of how his relatives would react if they knew he was trans and gay. “It’s a very long story,” Draco replies in an attempt to avoid the question.  “We have an eight hour train ride,” Harry jabs back now leaning against Draco. Draco smirks coyly, rolls his eyes, and let’s out a soft huff before beginning to tell his story, though he lets Harry’s head stay against his shoulder. “I believe I was seven when we met, you might know her. She’s in the year below us, her name is Astoria Greengrass she’s in Ravenclaw. We had been betrothed days after her birth,” Draco explains. Harry gasps audibly, mouth gaping. “Shut your mouth,” Draco insists. “Astoria is alright, what changed?” Harry asks. “I don’t like girls that way,” Draco admits, going quite red. “Big deal? You like blokes,” Harry replied nonchalantly. “To my father it is,” Draco retorts. “So Lucius Malfoy is a bigot, whoop! Whoop! Shocked,” Harry jabs back with a snarky tone. “I’m heir to the Malfoy line, I cannot be with a man because I have to produce a son,” Draco corrected, “My father would be fine if I had a brother,” he amends.
TW: rape scene
"Can I tell you one of my own secrets?" Draco ask. Harry nods, happy to learn more about his mate. "I always thought I was gay, except there was one person who I was attracted to who I thought was a girl, it turns out he's actually a boy so yeah...I'm gay," he admits, awkwardly, "My father wants me to give him proper heirs, marry a proper pureblood witch. It is my duty to continue the Malfoy line," annoyance clear in his tone as he rolled his eyes and he sighed audibly in displeasure. "So your father is homophobic?" Harry asks for clarification. "No, he's fine with me being gay so long as I produce a legitimate pureblood heir, though he might like you more than most wizards because you and I could produce an heir, albeit he will not approve of your blood status," Draco rebuts.
There were several problems with Potter being his mate. Firstly; she was a girl and Draco was gayer than gay. Secondly; the two of them were rivals, enemies. They couldn't stand to be in the same room without hexing each other or shouting insults. Lastly; they were completely incompatible. Fire and ice, oil and water, red and green, Gryffindor and Slytherin. Draco couldn't imagine any situation where the two of them could be content with each other, let alone happy, godforbid in love. By the time September 1st rolled around, Draco had begrudgingly accepted his fate. He found an empty compartment in which he could await his insufferable mate's arrival. Draco daydreamed as he waited, numbed from any and all pain. He felt above all things relief. Relief at finally escaping his father's violent rage and relief at finally returning to school where he felt most safe and accepted--apart from in his mother's arms.
Harry hugs the man tightly. Remus hugs back, feeling an intense need to protect the boy who he knew would face many of the same challenges he had. Remus was glad Harry would have Draco because he knew he wouldn’t be the man he was today without his Siri. “If you are willing,” Remus says a bit uncertainly, “We would like for you to come live with us,” Remus offers. Harry nods and thinks for a minute, biting his lip. “You would be safe with them love,” Draco whispers. “You’re sure Sirius and your children would want me around?” He asks, fearing rejection. “How about I owl Sirius and can come visit so you can ask him yourself,” Remus offers quickly. “Okay,” Harry replies relaxing a bit and making himself comfortable in Draco’s lap. “What about your kids what are they like?” Harry asks. “Our oldest, Anya, is eight. She is quite a curious child and very creative. Then we have four year old twins, Greer and Taylor, they are little trouble makers. They take after their daddy, while Anya is more like her papa,” he says smugly. “Are the twins boys, girls, or one of each?” Draco asks, noticing that this fact had been left out. “We’re not sure,” Remus explains, “We are letting them tell us when they are ready.” Harry grins at that, “I wish I had felt like I had a choice,” he admits. “Your parents would be so proud,” Remus tells him, smiling sadly as he thinks of his close friends. “Really?” Harry asks in slight disbelief. “Of course, they made me and Sirius your godfathers and we all were very close friends,” Remus reminds him. Harry smiles at that, feeling closer to his parents being around Remus.
After a few minutes of torture, Harry managed to break his restraints and throw his uncle off him as his body transformed with his creature inheritance. Fangs grew from his canines, his skin paled, dark circles enveloped his eyes, and a deep insaciable bloodlust grew in his belly, painful. He threw his uncle to the ground, knocking the older man out. Harry curled up in a ball, sobbing and desperately pining for his mate. Draco Malfoy, Harry needed him. His mate was his ex-enemy and Harry couldn't help but want to be safe in the other boys arms, to be loved, to have a real family with him. The last month of Harry's summer was largely uneventful. His relatives gave him a wide berth, more petrified of the boy then ever. Harry was able to complete his summer assignments, eat a bit more than normal, and avoid beatings or rapes. For Harry Potter, that counted as a good summer. By August 31st Harry was ready to meet Draco properly, fearful of rejection and a tad hopeful that maybe the could have a life together.
On Harry's sixteenth birthday Uncle Vernon had feigned illness, sending his wife and son of to an expensive amusement park with several of Dudley's friends. Uncle Vernon had tied Harry to his bed with chains, leaving the boy naked and at his uncle's complete mercy. The cruel man took his time, showering, eating breakfast, even watching a television program. Harry's anxiety was painful, the waiting increasing his terror. Uncle Vernon returned, belt in hand. The large man whipped the boy hard, only stopping when the boy looked close to falling into unconsciousness. The man stripped, getting on top of the boy and thrusting into his tight front hole without any prep or lubrication. Harry let out a pained shriek, thrashing about, despite having his wrists and ankles bound. Uncle Vernon came inside the small boy, laughing maniacally, "I'm going to knock you up girl! Then you'll see that you are a women, a mother." Harry sobbed and shook with terror.
Harry nods and hugs his mate close, "I love you, don't want you to die," he insists, "I'm scared Dray, I never had anyone who wants me or loves me before." Draco instinctively takes off his shirt and releases his wings, wrapping them around his little mate. Harry feels warm and safe in Draco’s wings. "Drink," he orders Harry softly, offering his neck to his little mate. Harry bites down, drawing blood. He drinks for a few minutes, licking the wound closed and kissing the bruised skin. Draco moans in arousal, enjoying the pain-pleasure sensation of his mate feeding from him. "Thank you," Harry breaths. "Baby," Draco reminds him, "You don't need to thank me for taking care your needs. My Harry, love it is my duty and honor to care for you." Harry blushes brightly and curls up against his mate's chest. Draco covers his mate with a large wing. The two drift off into a peaceful sleep.
“Can I tell you my own secret?” Draco asks in a weak attempt to change the subject. Harry nods, interested. “I’m gay, I wasn’t sure I was gay because there was this one person I thought was a girl...but it turns out he’s been a boy all along,” Draco explains in a round about way. Harry blushes beet red and smiles widely, he places a soft kiss on Draco’s lips. Draco looks into Harry’s green eyes. Draco pulls back slightly to speak, “Harry, I feel so much for you,” Draco explains, “I want you in my life and my heart, be my boyfriend?” He asks, hopefully. “I need to think about it,” Harry whispers not fully processing. Draco nods, understandingly.
“Alright then,” the matron said, “Mr. Potter, you are two months pregnant. Harry’s face became ghostly white as his brain connected the dots--the baby was Vernon’s. Tears fell from Harry’s eyes as he sobbed into Draco’s chest. “You have options,” the mediwitch explained to the clearly distressed young man, “If you don’t want the baby you can choose to end the pregnancy or I can assist you in locating an adoptive family, you have until three months to decide.” Harry was having a full blown panic attack by this point. Draco picked up his mate carrying him bridal style, sneering at the mediwitch and telling her to go to hell as he carried Harry back to their room.
"Draco, I'm hungry," Harry whispered, blushing brightly and biting his nails nervously terrified to ask for what he needed from his mate. "I need blood," Harry mumbled under his breath, ashamed of what he needed from his mate, "I'm sorry." "Oh my sweet, sweet boy," Draco replied softly, running his fingers through Harry's hair to calm and reassure him once again as he spoke, "Never be sorry for needing my blood. Harry, baby, it's natural for you to need my blood. I am your mate you need my blood, just as I need your presence. A vampire needs his mate's blood for energy. A veela will die if he's without his mate for too long or if his mate rejects him. We both need the other. I love you, even if our creature inheritances brought us together I really love you."
Somehow, his answer made Draco uneasy. Rather than argue or start an even longer conversation than this one he already didn't want to have, he drew his wand and began to mutter the first wards that came to mind. He may have been imagining, but Potter's indifference took on a slightly grateful air, and it almost looked like he might be smiling.
“Draco,” Hermione murmured when he had finished, quietly covering her face where he knew she was crying. “I want to say, why didn’t you tell us, but then— you couldn’t have, could you?”
“I’m going to help you,” Draco sighed. “You’re clearly useless at this particular skill set, Auror Potter, and I would like to go home at some point today.”
Shortly later, with twenty twelve-year-olds in tow, he ran into Minerva by the door of the hall.
“The nightmares then? I know you've had them a long time, but now they seem to be—"
"Amanda. You're doing it again."
“Harry, I just don’t think that—”
“I… we don’t know.”
Draco’s breath whooshed out in a surprised laugh. “Forearms!?” he exclaimed. “Forear—“
“A firstborn male,” Harry interjected quickly.
The apology took them through an entire afternoon. A conversation neither of them was ready to have that was mitigated by hard work and hot September sun. It was shortly after that day that Harry started noticing the forearms.
The empty space was one thing, but it felt like such a small part of the opening. He knew he needed to advertise. So he put posters about the opening day in every place he could think of, up to and including a poster in each of the common rooms at Hogwarts. McGonagall seemed pleased enough to help him. Eventually, after several shots of whisky, he even called
“Well, no! But he
has been doing this? We have to report them!”
“What?! Draco, don’t be so ridiculous. We can—”
“I don’t
“Professor! Headmistress McGonagall says you’re needed in her office right away.”
Neville looked at Draco carefully. He tried to find the hint of blatant teasing, the painful underpinning of bullying he was used to seeing. He looked for the sneer in this man’s features, the ones that had tormented his nightmares for years. He was free of it now, with a good counsellor, some serious self-exploration, a job that he loved...not to mention the quiet pestering of Hermione to make him understand the things he’d done in the war. It didn’t exactly amount to
had demanded to see someone immediately. Come on back.”
Harry suddenly looked directly at Draco and beamed, and the expression was so out of the blue that Draco froze for a moment. In all their history, he had definitely never been the recipient of a full-blown Potter smile. It was certainly disarming. He suddenly felt like he was part of a very secret club he'd never realised he wanted to join, and he felt quite out of breath for some reason.
Ron clapped his hands together and leapt up.
“Listen. I...Harry told me the story.”
“Yeah, no, I know that part. But why were you
He trailed his hands down the boning in Harry’s ribs, tugging the bottom edge of the corset as he went. “Or is it for this?” he asked, stroking his fingers over the pearl beads and therefore brushing Harry’s clavicle. “Or is it for that?” he said gesturing vaguely. “Because I’ll tell you what. I’m here. I don’t have much beyond that. I’m here and I don’t know why, and if you don’t kiss me soon, I might lose my nerve.”
“Okay…”
He made his way to the refreshment table and, with a glass of champagne in hand, he followed the shadows behind the pennants trying to escape the noise. He quickly discovered a corridor he’d never been down and snuck away from prying eyes, hoping to catch his breath. Unfortunately, a sudden voice and echoing footsteps forced him to duck into a crevice as silently as he could only a moment later.
“But sir,” Harry protested.
Part two.
He pulled the paperweight Hugo had made from it’s revered spot and packed it into his small box of ‘keep’ items. Refusing to delay and consider closer, he reached beneath the hidden ledge under the top drawer and retrieved the key. For no reason he could discern, he decided to start with the bottom drawer.
“And it’s almost Christmas. And, also—”
Draco laughed, turning his head away as he considered. “What about the other seven per cent?”
“Death? Hus-husband?”
He did look up, but he wasn’t angry as Harry had hoped, or proud, as he had always been before. His eyes were wide, dark circles crowding out the lids and worry lines etched into his forehead. “I meant it, Potter,” he said gently. “I’m sorry. It was an accident.”
Carl had been at the desk.
“So you
were never going, and he was still here thinking you might forgive him and take him back.”
“For goodness sake, Potter, no. You’ll survive a new partner. God, and you call
“Okay stop,” Draco finally snapped as they found seats in between a large group in the middle of the theatre. “I feel stupid enough without your shock.”
was a dirty word.
Arriving back at Hogwarts normally made him feel better, but when Harry stepped out of the floo in the Three Broomsticks and began the snowy, trudging walk back to the castle, an unfamiliar heaviness fell over him.
She smiled sadly and kissed him again. “What the fuck have I done? Draco is going to kill me.”
Harry stopped dead in the street. “Wh-what? What do you mean
, and effectively turning the tables.
The blaring fire provided too much light compared to the stark darkness, and Harry squinted.
"Harry!" Draco exclaimed more concern than an actual exclamation. "What-what are you doing here…oh, wait. Do you want me to leave? I'll leave. It's okay. Don't wake the others. I tried to tell Hermione it was a bad idea and—"
“Never mind. Hugo’s arrived. He says you have secret affairs to attend to?” Ginny grinned.
It was so tempting. Tempting to just lean in and let go, let the story be written here instead of two weeks ago. But the small jolt in his stomach reminded him why he was not going to do that, and he took a step back.
Harry knew, then, that Draco had won. He had convinced them that he was not his eleven-year-old self anymore. Instead, he was worthy of Neville's affection, and Hermione's concern, and Ron's firm nod and a jarring handshake.
Of course, the bubble burst the second he set his keycard into the staff entrance slot and was hit with the overwhelming heat and the heady, impenetrably fake smell of Cinnamon Spiced air fresheners. The nick-knack aisle at the front of the store, which Amanda had fondly dubbed The Shit Stacks, always made the whole place stink of Corporate Christmas. He took a deep breath of outside air before the door closed, forcing himself to relax as he marched purposefully to the back.
“Try again,” Harry said, beaming at him instead, trying to make him
The large desk was dark wood; Harry didn’t actually remember what
“How did you find me?” Draco said, ignoring her message.
"I know."
“How is this my life?” Potter wondered.
Travers may have been relatively calm to most people, but to Draco, who knew Pureblood masques better than most, he might as well have been wringing his hands and pacing.
Ignoring the fact that he’d completely missed breakfast with George, Harry headed straight for Wycombe. Pansy was leaning against the window of the shop when Harry finally made his way down the high street. He’d landed in the middle of a very familiar alleyway and was not sure how his brain felt about the Apparition. He’d stood for a moment, making sure he wasn’t about to throw up.
Draco reached up, only having just realised that he'd walked home with his jingle bell adorned felt antlers fixed firmly to his head.
There had been a time when he had been the same, wary of strangers. Or, really anyone who wasn’t his cats. Larry with his Mohawk. Meg with her bizarre meow. Triage, named after this near-death collusion into Draco’s life. These three had made a cohesive team against the world, and they occasionally tolerated Draco. Since he himself had always felt barely tolerable, their relationship worked out very well.
Potter, against all odds, burst out in a fit of laughter that he quickly tamped down. Still, there was a smile there, ghosted on his face, when he nodded sheepishly. Draco ignored the tiny spark of gratified satisfaction he felt at the expression.
“Weather got too bad to fly,” he declared, out of breath. “Had to wait for these guys to change.”
“This has to stop,” he said suddenly, whirling around on Harry who had the decency to look surprised for a moment. It was when his face relaxed, however, that Draco knew just how screwed they both were. Harry nodded slightly and sighed.
Is he fit?"
He turned to find Potter slack-jawed and frozen in place. Draco sighed and reached out to pinch his jumper between his fingers, pulling him up the next step.
Harry looked at the papers, and back at Collette, before muttering, "So, you actually think I can do this?"
Ron and Hermione, best friends that they were, had been very calm about his decision not to enter the Air Force. They had no right to be calm about anything at all. He’d told them in a terrible way. At their leaving tea, with all their teachers standing around holding flutes of champagne, all of them dressed in the fanciest Dress Uniforms that their posh private school could imagine. It had been the entirely wrong time to blurt out that he had, over the last two weeks, changed the entire trajectory of his five-year plan.
He stood up and looked around the office. He considered his options, the niggling in the back of his mind. He thought about the same thing he’d been thinking about for the past three months, even before Potter had shown up in the Ministry and proved him right.
He stood and grabbed his almost empty cup and wandered over to the coffee pot.
Harry opened his mouth to reply, then hesitated as a thought struck him. He inhaled deeply, resisted the urge to wince, and blurted, “Draco, why did you say yes? To tonight?"
It smelled like bread and bad water and too much pee on the street. It felt like spring despite being late summer, and there were random, inexplicable flower petals littering the street. Their origins would never be revealed, and they just added to the overwhelming sense of deja vu. As did having to complete his order in French. In London, he rarely spoke in French. Sometimes, he read books, or listened to French radio, but never spoke. Still, the words rolled off his tongue, the teasing quip ready when the girl behind the till teased him for buying such a variety of things. The softness, the smoothness, the fact that he didn’t have to guard his accent. It all settled across his shoulders like a comfy jumper and, arms laden with delicious morsels of France, he found himself content. Content, and resigned.
He heaved a great sigh and tried to ignore the fact that the tinned music of the seasons played even in
They sat in slightly awkward silence for a moment before Harry cleared his throat.
“Harry can’t know. We’re sure?”
"Don't have em," Amanda shrugged. "The pink ones broke. These
"Draco," Malfoy said after a beat, offering his own hand hesitatingly. "We should…I mean, we could. If you want. Dinner, another time maybe?"
“So I hear congratulations are in order?” Harry asked when he had finally chosen a set of strings.
“Because three years ago, you would have supported the decision,” Draco nodded.
“I—” Draco replied faintly. “Ok, well… Ok.”
Pansy turned to him sharply. "What? No, Draco. Merlin, how did you manage to completely miss my point. We aren't 15, Draco. Go love someone. Go love the person your brain is
“Can I have a coffee?” he growled at Harry, sitting heavily in a chair at the bar.
“When you have nightmares, is it of him?” Harry asked quietly.
The truth was, his midnight brain had so
“It happened because you still haven’t had a conversation with Harry Potter about what actually happened during the battle. Or about any of it,” she answered patiently.
“It’s not really a big deal, Draco,” Marci continued. “This isn’t going to impact you long term. He’s entitled to request the review and since it was backed up by his superior officer, it had to go through. It happens all the time. They’ll do the review and move on.”
All told, it took a year. One year from that day, he stood in the centre of a building that he suddenly owned instead of leased; he had learned enough carpentry to fix the floors, hired a handyman to help with the walls, and he and Ron had placed protective charms and wards on the building.
“Just don’t let yourself get behind by helping him,” he warned with a knowing smirk. “Though I suppose you young folk do have to stick together, don’t you?”
“Hush,” the girl said to him, tightening her grip on his arm and propping it up, like he was weak and about to faint; which, if he was honest, was a distinct possibility.
have to resist.
“Draco, do you have plans on Saturday night?” he said suddenly, hit with an idea that had never occurred to him.
“Oh, absolutely.” Harry laughed, tucking the kitten into his pocket.
“Right.”
“I get that,” Harry nodded, turning back to the sky as Draco relaxed onto the ground beside him again.
“Why am I here,” Harry?” Draco whispered in his ear. “Am I here for this?”
Harry’s face melted a tiny bit, into a soft expression Draco hadn’t seen before. “It really is, though. You know that right?”
going to notice that you avoided the only other fit man in the entire building.”
“Barely,” Harry said with a wry grin. Draco swallowed.
"What?" Draco demanded.
“Likely often,” Harry laughed. “Draco,” he added, as an afterthought.
Draco held his breath for a moment, until he needed oxygen. The light itch of a pen tip hit his skin, and he remained frozen for the first minute. The hand that slowly turned his wrist was rough, calloused from too many burns and too much time spent damp; the shift of fingers lightly on his skin kept making Draco’s stomach jolt.
Draco sat up, curling his knees in. From the corner of his eye, Harry watched him become smaller than he’d ever seen him. It felt very wrong, to have someone so tall and slender, so agile, curl into a feeble ball.
“I think we’re no good for each other,” Draco replied, pushing food around with his fork. “Also, I don’t mean to make this…you know, awkward and everything but—”
Draco had an entire sentence pop into his mind. It was a good one, right on brand.
Draco closed his eyes tightly against the memory and let his head fall to the desk beside the largely untouched breakfast tray. He felt ill. He tried to imagine going to his father and saying he couldn’t do the meetings today because he was hungover and lovesick and acutely lonely. The thought made a pathetic giggle bubble up in his mind, imagining a world where he just owled Harry instead, met him for lunch in the little parkette he’d discovered last year.
