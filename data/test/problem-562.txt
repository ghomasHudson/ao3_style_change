“I know… I know you’re here for me. I’m sorry. I-” Harry broke her gaze, suddenly nervous, “...I’ve been seeing someone, OK?”
The bathroom had become foggy, obscuring their naked bodies, but Harry found comfort in it, it was as though it was just him and Draco in their own little world.
“I know you’re thinking the worst, Harry, but there a million other good reasons as to why Draco isn't back yet...Perhaps his Mother had come to London to visit him?”
At about one thirty in the morning Harry woke up yelling; visions of the forest, and of the odd Horcrux still lingering in his mind's eye, as he sat up in a cold sweat. Only a minute after his screaming did he hear a knock on his door and Draco entered. His face showed sadness as he looked at Harry, panting on his bed.
Harry fell asleep peacefully with Draco’s arms around his waist and his blond head nuzzled into Harry’s neck.
Harry’s attachment had grown tenfold, and it made him irritably uncomfortable. He didn’t want to be attached, he didn’t want to be looking out for a glimpse of the blond any chance he could.
Lying completely still, with his hand still palmed over his crotch, acting as though nothing weird was happening just in case Draco really had woken up, Harry really couldn’t believe what was happening next.
And then Harry had barely had time to blink before Draco’s walls were barricaded around him once more.
As Harry looked at the two of them, his insides swelled with admiration. Their two purely blond heads leaned toward one another, chatting warmly.
Harry sped off to catch him. He came up beside Draco and reached out his arm. The Snitch had then abruptly sped downwards towards the grass. The two boys followed suit, almost flying vertically downwards.
“And you’ll make so much money here now that you’re so close to Hogwarts,” Hermione said in a matter of fact way.
They both fell silent and looked at him expectedly. As he looked at them, Harry suspected they’d been waiting for this for weeks.
Draco looked even more attractive as his uniform was now as ruffled as Ron’s, his hair all messed up. Harry, inwardly wishing that he’d been the one to ruffle up his boyfriend’s hair and clothes.
Draco snickered. The blond placed his arms on either side of Harry’s head and lay the rest of his body on top of him. Slowly, Draco lowered himself, nuzzling his head into Harry’s neck as he began grinding against Harry’s pelvis.
He and Draco had developed a distinctly unusual relationship and were now stealing secret moments together throughout their weeks at Hogwarts.
The two started laughing again, leaning on each other as they tried to catch their breath. Even Crabbe had started to giggle as he caught onto the reality of the situation.
Harry awoke to quiet whispers and murmurs around him. His eyes were still closed, but he could hear voices he recognised. Perhaps this was another dream?
“I’m serious. Actions have always spoken louder than words. I’d prefer to develop a friendship with Draco, rather than an exchange of apology that doesn’t get us anywhere. By coming back here, he has a chance to redeem himself right? His redemption, if he chooses to act upon it, will earn my forgiveness.”
Harry closed his eyes and exhaled, then looked fiercely at the blond. “Draco, you know we can’t do this.”
Harry felt Draco’s erection against his thigh, and then the blond started to grind shamelessly into Harry and it was all he could do to keep himself upright and not crumple to his knees in overwhelming arousal.
Harry knew Draco had no idea where the Gryffindor common room was, so he pushed away the idea that Draco could actually be looking for him. And yet, the turmoil swelled inside him; did he reveal himself and face the wrath of Draco’s anger? Or did he just chase the boy around like a lunatic?
“Not gonna lie you guys are cute together. Gosh I’ve been pinning this relationship for years, and here you two finally are, all hot and bothered before I interrupted your morning fun.”
That was a dangerous kind of love, but the more Harry thought about it, he knew he wouldn’t have expected anything less once he fell in love with Draco. The two of them always entertained the invisible string that pulled them together; on the surface they entertained it as enemies, but now he knew that deep down they entertained it as an excuse to be with one another.
“I know Draco. But when and … if, this is all over, then at least I have hope we could try something in the future…”
Harry moaned and threw his head back at the touch. Draco chuckled, then swiftly undid Harry’s fly, pushing down his trousers slightly and gripped his palm around Harry’s cock.
He had woken in a cold sweat, painfully reminded of the emptiness of his bed. The pillows beside him smelt of Draco, and he hugged them tightly to his chest.
And then the Slytherin was descending the stairs proudly, leaving Harry frozen on the step and in a complete blunder of emotions in his wake.
Harry’s head was still tilted back slightly, wanting the sensation Draco was giving, but also hugely confused and conflicted at this sudden turn of events.
“Harry... I want you so badly,” Draco whispered into Harry’s ear, causing Harry to groan, feeling himself becoming hard.
Harry suddenly felt intoxicated by his attire. He could smell the boy's scent; it was wood, mixed with lemon and parchment, but also hints of grass and soil. Harry was rendered immobilized on the spot, immediately at a loss for words, the reckless courage seeming to catch up with him.
Gone, was Harry’s uninhibited state from the previous night. Now the reality of his decision to sleep in Draco Malfoy’s bed weighed down on him so heavily he might suffocate. How on earth was he supposed to get out of this room? Yes, he had the Invisibility Cloak, but the Slytherin dormitory suddenly seemed a lot smaller now it had four other occupants.
“This is mental. We’re really sitting here discussing Harry’s future with a git we’ve hated for five years. Merlin things just get stranger and stranger as the years go on.”
Seamus broke the silence first as he moved toward the entrance to the twin spiral staircases. “Well, I dunno know about the rest of you but I’m keen to see my room.”
Sighing, Draco said, “Of course I’d choose you Potter! Merlin, I’ve never played against Thomas or Finnigan, but I know your style like the back of my hand. I hope McGonagall and the rest of them realise this. Surely being two Seekers would heighten our chance.”
The blond stirred before slowly opening his eyes and looking up at Harry. He smiled softly and then moved his hand to slowly but gracefully trace the back of his fingers along Harry’s cheek. Harry’s breath hitched as he stared down at Draco, tempted to take the hand that had just caressed his face into his own. But before he could move, Draco seemed to abruptly awaken from his hazeful bliss. He sat up straight and cleared his throat, not looking at Harry, shuffling now back to his side of the bed.
Harry moaned and his head fell forward onto Draco’s shoulder and he pushed him even further against the wall. He was breathing heavily against Draco’s neck, the blond now gripping the front of Harry’s T-shirt.
“Oh shh don’t spin this around,” Hermione said smiling. “I mean, we all knew what was going on, but it was up to you to tell us. And now you have!”
Harry suddenly found his voice, looking at the boy with maddening anger, “Yeah. I know about it. All thanks to you.” His voice was full of disdain.
“I think she’s fine Ron,” Harry said politely, “She’s her own person, happy to enjoy your company but also happy without it.”
“Now, I’d just like to begin by saying how wonderful the first half of the year has been,” McGonagall said standing, addressing them all.
“Harry, even after all this time do you forget Hogwarts is a school of magic? It’s enchanted obviously. Well, the dorms are anyway. The common room would be much the same as Gryffindor I assume.”
“So, apart from you being a thrill seeking daredevil, why did you end up in Gryffindor?” Draco demanded.
“Besides, can you imagine what would’ve happened if we got together back in the day?” Draco said, a joking tone to his voice.
Harry fell silent. It was true, kids did still stare at him all the time at school. Was he really that distracted by Draco Malfoy that he’d actually become immune to it all?
The boy shrugged, “You can’t blame her Granger. Draco’s wanted Potter for years-” Harry almost fell out of his seat, “-so now that the specky git has shown some interest, I think she’s just keen for them to finally get together.”
“Woah OK, OK…,” He looked to Pansy, “Pansy, you won’t see Draco for a bit so best be nice to him? And Draco,” Harry said turning to him, “The Ministry twat is standing at the doorway,” Harry gestured behind him, “Let’s not give him any more reasons to hate you.”
Draco stalked past him, scanning the five beds in the dormitory, “Relax Potter. Weasley probably just assumed you’re coming up here for a wank. Which is partly true,” the blond chuckled, “but it also means we’ll be left alone.”
“Here here!” Boomed Slughorn, waving his glass and slopping it over the table as he went, Harry now realising Ron and Blaise were definitely not the only tipsy ones here.
As Draco sat down beside Harry, he reached out and pulled Harry’s right hand toward him. Harry watched as grey eyes swept over the white scarring that faintly spelt, “I must not tell lies.”
The two had been discussing all manner of things from Draco’s life at the manor, what his mother was doing now. Harry told him all about Sirius, and all about Grimmauld Place.
This weekend was the fourth Saturday of the month which meant no mentoring. Although Hermione had profusely reminded Harry and Ron that this meant extra time to study, the two best friends had used their previous weekends off for well deserved leisure; flying, sleeping, visiting Hagrid, eating and lounging around Ron’s chess board.
“You know what? I’m glad you guttered him. He deserved what he got. I would’ve done the same thing, no question.”
“I knew you were coming,” The old wizard smiled in his frame, gesturing to McGonagall’s desk directly below him, “Professor McGonagall’s schedule sits right in front of me, you see?”
Already drunk with arousal, the darkened shadows that coated their bodies only egged Harry on more. He brought his hand up and ran it through Draco’s hair.
As they made their way up the winding path, Harry stealing as many side glances toward Draco as he could, Draco broke the silence first.
Harry and Draco hadn’t met up with each other in almost two weeks. Harry suspected it was a mixture of Draco’s mortification and fury toward Harry that sustained the distance between them. And although the increasing pressures of fifth year were mounting, by the time Harry fell into bed every night, his mind still drifted to the platinum blond locks of his Slytherin enemy.
Dean was smiling at him, as were the other eighth years as Harry plonked down in between Parvati and Ron, throwing his head in his hands.
Draco stood in the doorway to his room. An oversized dark green sweater on his top half, and straight, black trousers that were cut at his ankles on his bottom half, with Slytherin socks to match.
Harry panted, the pleasure still lingering in his pants. “Merlin Draco.” His grip on the blonds hair only tightening.
As Harry touched him however, Draco’s head fell back in obvious pleasure and he leaned into Harry’s touch.
They two began wrestling each other roughly, panting hard and laughing between breaths as Harry tried and tried again to break his Snitch away from Draco’s fingers.
As Draco obeyed, Harry groaned. He breathed in the apple scent of Draco’s hair and felt his trousers tighten at the feel of Draco’s mouth utterly devouring his throat.
“Neville!” Hannah said loudly then looked as though she thoroughly regretted it, “I er….I really like you,” She mumbled.
“Ron, I’d thought winning the war last year would’ve put things into perspective. Whatever happened between me and Malfoy in the past was trivial, principle, meaningless!-”
It was dawn, and the soft hues of light fell through Harry’s mullioned windows and danced gently upon the hardwood floors of his bedroom.
Harry exhaled, then looked at Draco directly, “What are your plans next year, when you leave Hogwarts?”
“Ugh, if only I’d just asked McGonagall if I could go with him! I hate the thought of what they might be doing to him Hermione.”
Then Draco was pulling Harry up onto his lap so Harry was straddling him in the bed. Draco’s eyes graced over Harry’s face; down from his green eyes to his lips and then back up again in such a seductive way all Harry could do was tense and clench his jaw in arousal.
“Right. Off we go, back to the castle...Thank you gentleman that’ll be all,” the man said to the wizards who were still holding Draco and Blaise.
But this had become one of very many nights, and once again, Harry found himself completely lost in the moment.
Harry shifted closer to Draco, reaching out and clinging onto his top. Draco hummed and deepened the kiss.
Hermione stood up suddenly, blocking his path, “You have got to stop pushing us away Harry! When are you going to get it into your head? We’re your friends and we’re here for you!”
“Well, regardless of whether or not they’ve changed, I don’t think you should be so forgiving Hermione,” Hannah suddenly said. “You three,” she looked to Hermione, Ron and Harry, “Are the real heroes and they should be sucking up to you as much as possible.”
Before his hazy brain could catch up with reality, Ron and Seamus had also stood up next to him on the couch, the three of them wrapping their arms around each other’s shoulders and singing absurdly loud.
Harry swallowed, reaching out under the covers to run his hand down Draco’s chest, “Draco...it was so hard without you here.”
Draco gave him a look but the smirk on his lips gave his feigned anger away. He sat down next to Harry. Harry couldn’t deny that they were quite close to each other now. They weren’t touching but Harry could feel the other boys body heat.
Harry was always one to speak his mind and ask questions, because sometimes he hated the agendas that were formed and passively obeyed, in fact, it was these agendas that had caused such disunity between the four houses in the past. But as he was sitting so close to Draco, he concluded that he could readily go along with this one like everybody else.
Harry had barely a second thought before he scrambled to his desk, placed a fresh piece of parchment in front of him, and dipped his quill in ink. His mind raced and his green eyes were blazing, then he bent over the parchment and began to write.
“You’re barking? There’s no way the Malfoy’s would switch sides. Especially not for their son’s love interest.” Ron said.
“Uh Hem,” Pansy’s voice registered somewhere in Harry’s somewhat functioning brain. Harry and Draco suddenly stilled at her interruption.
“He’s not on probation and he doesn’t have a record, so he’s just got a few detentions with McGonagall.” Draco answered looking at Harry.
It’s cold here at the manor. I often fall into daydreams about us wrapping our arms around each other next to the fire.
“Oh it would be my pleasure.” Pansy got up and walked over to Ernie, “Ernie my darling Hufflepuff you look way too stiff, and not in the good way.” She winked at him as the laughs got louder. “Let me help you relax.”
Harry read the letter that had just been delivered by Teddy the owl. It was early in the morning and Teddy’s tapping on Harry’s window had woken him up from a light sleep, filled with dreams of apples, broomsticks and swirling colours of platinum blond.
Pansy raised her eyebrows, “Merlin help us. Never thought I’d see the day where Weasel B approved of Potter and Draco’s-” She lifted her fingers to imitate quotation marks, “‘friendship.’”
They broke apart. Draco’s hair now a little dischelleved which did not help Harry’s predicament in his pants. The boy looked heavenly.
Harry was ascending the dungeons after an unfair and gruelling detention with Snape, and Draco was descending them.
Harry’s fingers were tangled in Draco’s platinum blond locks as the Slytherin laid atop him in Draco’s king size bed.
Ever since the end of the war, Harry tried to be as present as possible, reminding himself that the past was the past and the future didn’t harbour any prospects of defeating Dark Lords, so he took another shot from Seamus and readily resolved to get drunk.
When Harry pulled back, his glazed eyes stared at Draco. He reached up and pushed his blond bangs out of his eyes.
“And I have a feeling he won’t be unsupervised.” Hermione said as Harry’s eyes widened, but determinedly kept his back to them.
Clearing his throat awkwardly, Harry slowly got up from Draco, the bulge in his pants embarrassingly uncomfortable as he made his way back to his place in the circle. Draco was red, his eyes had darkened, his hair a mess and his clothes askew, Harry didn’t think he’d ever seen anything more arousing.
He bit his lip, “Well, no... Like I said, enough strange things have happened to me that I sort of just go with it.”
Harry watched as Draco stilled, continuing to face forward, but the rest of his friends turned to face him.
Harry continued to suck on Draco’s neck, not ever wanting this pleasure to end. Draco was so irresistibly sexy, Harry just wanted to eat him up.
“At first, I was like, nah no way, there’s no way I’d let that git near Harry! But you make ‘im happy don’t ya?”
The three slumped onto the couch by the fire, their eyes unfocused and their laughs getting louder as they looked between the unruly state of themselves.
“Draco, I… I don’t want to but,” Harry swallowed, “I need to get out of here before your friends see me.”
The man looked to Draco then and put out his hand, “Good morning Mr Malfoy. My name is Sir Pattison Edmund Saunders.”
Harry watched the sexy movement of Draco’s throat as the blond swallowed in excitement and anticipation.
Slowly and carefully, he removed his hand from Draco’s hip and rested it on the bulge in his boxers. Harry dug his head deeper into Draco’s chest so as to stifle the moan trying desperately to escape his lips. He slowly peeked up at the blond, so as to check he was still sleeping. Draco looked content and free as ever as he slept, and this only turned Harry on more.
Harry felt his chest ache and he suddenly regretted asking George the question in the first place. He still felt entirely guilty for what happened to Fred.
Draco’s then used his other hand to grip around Harry’s middle. And Harry was moaning breathlessly as he came into Draco’s hand. And not a second later was Draco pushing Harry up against the wall as he came behind him and was riding out his high.
The rest of the table raised their glasses and cheered, some of them stood, saluting Ron and Hermione.
The more he thought about it, the more he realised that he’d always found both girls and boys attractive, but he’d figured everyone just felt that way. Harry had always loved extra hard. The neglect of his past always made him determined to treat the ones he loved with kindness and affection. And although he noted the physical features of all the people he’d met in his life, his curiosity was always more attuned to their personality. ‘Figures,’ He thought, ‘I’ve met some pretty horrid people in my life.’
“Yeah it’s all sunshine and daisy’s for you!” Neville’s face contorted with annoyance, “I knew I should’ve just stayed at Hogwarts, my Gran’s a nightmare, even more so at Christmas!”
On the bottom half of the parchment, Harry saw the list of subjects being offered. He scanned the list quickly looking for Quidditch. When he found it, he saw that three names had already been scribbled down below it’s title; Seamus, Dean and Draco. Suddenly excited at this revelation, that there was a one in three chance that it would be himself and Draco that would teach Quidditch together, Harry dived for the pen stuck to the noticeboard and scribbled his name below Draco’s.
Draco must have sensed Harry’s hesitation, because the blond squeezed his hand and led him towards his perfectly made bed that lined the wall that was furthest away from the entrance.
His face was pale and his eyes bore an unmistakable look of worry, as if he would flee any second. Harry braced himself, and opted to return Draco’s gesture from before. As he closed his hand on Draco’s shoulder, he watched Draco’s eyes soften and slowly turn to face Harry. Once more, there was that look of curiosity, and Harry really didn’t know what to take from it. But he’d find out sooner or later. Right now, they needed to get into the Great Hall, and Harry was determined to be Draco’s anchor.
Harry couldn’t believe what he was hearing, he felt he was the main character of a story he knew nothing about (actually the more he thought about it, he realised that had been the case his entire life). But regardless, Draco actually liked Harry, even before the war. The thought was frightening and euphoric all at once.
“That’s great,” Hermione said smiling, “I personally want to get into the Ministry as soon as I can, especially after Harry told us what happened to you Draco. There’s still a long way to go, I don’t want to waste any time.”
Harry simply couldn’t fathom what was happening. Among all of his strange encounters through his years at Hogwarts, sitting in Draco Malfoy’s lap on the stone cold floor of the dungeons while the Slytherin nuzzled his neck, was taking bizarre to a whole new level.
Harry was so lost in the moment. So lost to Draco’s sounds of pleasure escaping his lips. So lost that he couldn’t even acknowledge he’d never done anything like this with another boy. The heat of the moment was so strong that he merely just went with it, and he found that it all felt so natural.
Slowly Draco leaned in, his lips ghosting over Harry’s. Harry leaned up involuntarily, seeking his touch.
Harry watched him go before returning his eyes forward, suddenly faced with the mingled expressions of Ron and Hermione. Hermione’s face bared that familiar knowing expression that often unnerved Harry. But Ron’s eyebrows were high up somewhere on his forehead and his smile had formed a smirk, “Jumping on McGonagall’s bandwagon of house unity are we?”
Ron had appeared suddenly at Hermione’s side, looking aghast between herself and Draco. After a moment, he resolved to say, “Well, you know Hermione, now that we don’t have a war to fight I plan to read that one, I hear it’s most illuminating-”
This caused a few head turns from some of the other eighth years spread about the common room. This was, indeed, taking inter-house unity to new heights.
The moments they stole together at midnight, were the moments where Harry could completely let himself go to the present moment. The foreboding that followed him during his days suddenly subsided and he was free under Draco’s touch, liberated by their kisses.
Draco’s fingers began caressing Harry's throat. His voice was still sexily raspy, and Harry realised whenever he heard it, it was during moments where Draco was uninhibited, when he was comfortable and free, when they were cuddled together like this in bed.
“I know you’re too proud to say the words out loud,” Harry said with an arrogant look, “But I know the truth and that’s good enough for me.”
“I truly admire you, Harry. I had so many opportunities to make the right choice but I let my fear get the better of me. And by turning a blind eye on those who were suffering, I suffered myself. I became so mentally weak I’d forgotten who I was.”
“But what other options have you? Oh, I don’t know, let me think… Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher perhaps?”
And with that Hermione kissed Harry on the cheek then walked confidently up the stairs, out of sight.
“So this is what it feels like to be ‘Arry Potter,” Seamus said as he looked back at all the prying eyes. He patted Harry roughly on the back, “Sorry mate.”
“Right, yeah” Harry cleared his throat, “I mean I could say the same for you but...we’re past that, aren’t we?”
“And besides,” Draco continued, “Pansy and Blaise are straight, well...so they say anyway.” The blond giggled again.
“So did you guys hear? You’ve got a new common room,” Ginny said with a sharpness to her voice. Harry suspected she was perhaps upset at the reality of being away from him.
He moved forward to softly kiss Harry’s bare chest, before sitting back again and placing his hand at the top of Harry’s trousers.
In Harry’s drunkenness, he fell forwards into Draco, his head falling onto Draco’s shoulders. Before Harry pulled away, he revelled in Draco’s scent, the aroma only making him more delirious with euphoria amidst his intoxicated state.
Ron was taking a seat in between Hermione and Seamus. Harry quickly turned to grab more drinks for them, before joining the circle.
Ginny made a face at him and then said “Goodbye Mum.” She kissed her mother on the cheek then set off to find a compartment on the train with her friends.
He’d lost count of how many times he’d been down in the dungeons this year. Every time he descended the stairs in the middle of the night, he told himself this would be the last time, but Harry just couldn’t stop himself from going back for more. More of what exactly? He didn’t quite know. But the root of his dilemma began plainly, with Draco Malfoy.
But Harry still hadn’t openly admitted that he and Draco were practically together, which seemed stupid considering they were certainly acting that way.
Harry hastily reached behind Draco’s neck and kissed him senseless, wondering if it was humanly possible to fall any deeper in love with the boy above him.
When they sat upon Draco’s bed, the blond drew the curtains concealing them from the dormitory. Then Harry finally took off his cloak and all Draco did was look at him with hunger and seduction, moving so he wrapped one arm around Harry’s waist.
Light chatter flitted throughout the high ceilinged room, as well as Christmas symphonies floating from Filch’s overly large gramophone in one corner of the room.
Harry had only had a few drinks, but he noted that Draco had resolutely caught up with Ron and Blaise, the three of them now rolling around on the floor singing Christmas carols loudly. A sight he truly never, ever, thought he’d see.
“I’ll talk to him toni- tomorrow!” Harry said quickly, undoubtedly knowing Hermione would’ve caught on to his misstep.
Their homework seemed to double at each passing week. The spells; more complicated, the potions; more intricate, the incantations; more advanced, and the textbooks; more complex. Harry began to realise what it felt like to be Hermione simply by being in the library nearly everyday.
“Yeah, right,” Harry said harshly, clear sarcasm in his voice, “Like you’d want anyone to find out… I’d pay to see the look on old Lucius’s face.”
Harry kept walking, determined to get to the door. He felt eyes from all directions burning into him, the murmured whispers now becoming excited chatter at the image of Harry Potter walking through the Slytherin common room.
Draco knew just how to do it, squeezing and twisting at the right moments, bringing Harry closer and closer to the edge.
He opened his door and motioned Harry to leave. Harry got up hurriedly but as he passed Draco on his way out, he winked back at him and said “I’ll be seeing you tonight.”
Although the past term at Hogwarts was dotted with many wonderful moments with Draco, now that Harry had actually confessed his feelings, he finally felt pure and free. And the freedom was encompassing, it filled him up like sunlight saturating and warming his body.
“Oh!” Unable to deny the relief swimming in Harry’s stomach, “Right, of course. I mean, it’s totally fine if you were sharing a bed with a girlfriend, but thanks for clearing that up-”
Now that Harry thought about it, he realised he would have to tell Ron and Hermione what had happened between himself and the Slytherin. He knew that they’d expected as much, but now that the two boys had confessed their love, Harry supposed that meant they were in a relationship? Truthfully, he didn’t know.
“I’d just like to say thank you to all of you for your cooperation this term,” She looked around at them all with kind eyes, “The younger year levels have been so appreciative of your mentorship. And, more importantly...I’ve seen a real change in all of you. From what I can see, you have developed new friendships beyond that of your own Houses, and I believe that shows real maturity.” Harry saw her eyes begin to water. “Well...happy Christmas,” She said before she hurried off, blowing her nose into a tartan handkerchief as she went.
It was Tuesday evening now and Harry was sitting in the library with Ron and Hermione, looking utterly depressed.
Hermione’s eyes were watery as she stared at Ron, before she flung her arms around him and kissed his cheek.
It was dark outside, and the light in Draco’s room was dim, the only glare coming from the softening embers in the fireplace. As Draco made to get into his bed, Harry followed suit. Before they had both laid down however, Harry spoke.
“What were you even talking about Parvati?” Came Ron’s croaky voice, his eyes half closed turning to her.
Draco snorted, “Yeah, right, like the whole wizarding world’s gonna believe that? Surely you know better Potter.”
Harry smiled sheepishly, “Who knows, me, Ron and Hermione put our names down for Defence, so I’ve cut my chances.”
“It’s a part of my probation Harry, I can’t do anything about it. Besides, it’s my fault, I let my anger get the better of me.”
Slowly Draco broke away from Harry’s lips and began to leave a trail of kisses down his jaw, to his neck and then onto Harry’s chest.
Draco placed his hand behind his head on Harry’s pillow. He looked Harry up and down, sizing him up as he often did before they’d fight. Harry hovered above him, his hands upholding him on either side of Draco’s head.
Blaise burst into another round of giggles. Crabbe was just looking between Harry and his friends with confusion.
Draco touched Harry’s chest, before slowly gracing his hand down over Harry’s shirt. He snuck his fingers beneath it and caressed the skin at Harry’s hip, causing the brunette to buck into Draco’s touch.
“Well I don’t know about anyone else, but that was freaking hot,” Lavender said with raised eyebrows.
She squeezed his arm, “It’s OK Harry, really. I’m glad you figured it out,” She looked at him kindly, “Don’t you remember me telling you there was more to your sexuality?”
Hermione smiled and shook her head. Draco looked at him, a kind of ‘are you serious?’ look adorning his face.
Draco then broke away from Harry’s neck and looked at him, his eyes darkened with arousal. Harry stopped his grinding and looked back at Draco in earnest, utterly mesmerised by his gaze.
Harry looked into Draco’s grey eyes. They looked exhausted. Harry took Draco’s hand away from his cheek and softly kissed his palm.
On Friday morning, Harry and Draco sat together in Charms. The whole class was practising all manner of nonverbal spells, whilst Professor Flitwick’s head bobbed along in between the desks checking up on each pair of students.
Harry turned toward the open door, and watched it close on its own accord, before Draco pulled the Cloak off him, looking exasperated but a little wicked at the same time.
They stared at each other for a moment before Harry snaked his hand around Draco’s neck and pulled him down for a kiss.
Harry could only roll his eyes and shove his hands in the pockets of his robes in an attempt to feign his indifference toward the cursed muttering. He risked a glance at Draco and saw that his jaw was set and eyes were fixated on the eighth year table, and Harry couldn’t blame him.
Of course, appearances did play a part. He still thought Ginny was absolutely beautiful, and her fiery personality only made her more attractive.
There was Pansy, sitting right next to Hermione across from him. Blaise sat on Seamus’s otherside, Theo sat between Neville and Hannah, and finally, with another lurching feeling, sat Draco at the head of the table, only one seat away from Harry.
“We just can’t Hermione,” Harry said firmly, “But that’s not the problem… It’s like, I just want to be with him all the time, and I’m always looking for him everywhere I go, always thinking about him! My problem is… I don’t have the time or the effort to be so attached, and yet here I am, more attached than ever!”
“I assure you Mr Potter, Malfoy here will be safe with me. Now come along now,” He began turning toward the door, “I’ve already spoken with the Headmistress. The Ministry is expecting you at nine o’clock.”
The blond smiled back at him and there was a slight pause, before Draco said, “So, what should we teach them? I think we’ve got the first years to start with.”
Draco then placed his hand against Harry’s heart and pulled back so that Harry was forced to look at him, “They’ll always be with you, in here.”
He absentmindedly hoped Draco would be one of those few students who stayed here over Christmas, but Harry thought better of it. He knew his mum needed him.
Some adult wizards had broken into the middle of the circle. One grabbed Draco by his arms and pulled him roughly back. Another pulled Blaise’s hands behind him, as he struggled to break free. And then another two wizards were kneed in the snow, slowly helping the beaten man up. His mouth and nose were bloody.
Ron’s tie was undone, so was his collar, his robe; only barely hanging onto his shoulders, his white shirt untucked, hanging out from underneath his Gryffindor jumper. Harry could only smile, he was perfectly Ron.
Draco then motioned their bodies toward one of the tiled walls. Harry was now face to face with it as Draco still stood behind him.
In Harry’s embarrassed haste, he actually tumbled and fell to the ground. The laughter around him only intensified, and he found himself laughing as well.
Draco shrugged and returned to his wand, “Yeah. I mean, at first I just thought it was principle. Like, you’ve got to hate each other you know? That explained the fights in front of the others. But…” Draco suddenly dropped his gaze to the table, “But how do you explain the incessant staring from across the Great Hall?” He returned his gaze to Harry. “I thought maybe it was just because I hated you so much that you always turned up in my line of vision, but, it wasn’t until later, that I realised I was actually looking for you.”
Shortly after narrowly missing Filch up the stairs to the seventh floor, they removed the cloak and Ron walked back and forth three times, thinking hard, ‘I want to go to the legal age eighth year party.’
“Draco and I also found this Harry,” Hermione’s soft voice spoke again as she tentatively passed him a brown book that looked like a photobook.
“He’ll have to do a lot more than say sorry. Empty words really. If he’s gonna earn my forgiveness it’ll be through action.” Ron said on the other side of Hermione.
“Pffft,” Ron chucked a pillow at him as they all laughed. “Shall I leave you two to it?” The redhead asked, looking between Harry and Draco.
Ron looked at Hermione disbelieving, and then cracked up even more, which only made Harry laugh. It seemed to soften the weight that pressed down on his chest.
Blaise laughed, “I don’t really go by labels. If I think someones attractive, whether they’re male or female, I’ll go for em’.”
After lunch Harry set out onto the Hogwarts grounds. He paid Hagrid a first visit, something he’d been meaning to do since returning to Hogwarts. After he fed Buckbeak and helped Hagrid with his pumpkin patch, they went inside and Harry slurped up his bucket sized mug of tea as Fang rested his drooling snout on Harry’s leg. He and Hagrid swapped stories of their summer and reminisced about Dumbledore, until they both became teary with nostalgia and sweaty with relief at the fact that they both had made it through the war, and were able to return to the happiness of Hogwarts.
As Harry chewed on his salad sandwich, he asked, “So, I guess we won’t have to worry about getting food or drinks. The room would do that for us.”
Harry beamed. The mere fact that Draco had at one point noticed what he was wearing was enough to surge him on.
Draco was still sleeping peacefully. Harry felt the tranquil rise and fall of his chest and breathed in the citrus and apple scent of his blond hair.
The first day of school was pleasant enough. Harry kept thinking back to the way he’d told Draco he’d be seeing him later on only to realise how stupid he sounded considering they ate their breakfast, lunch and shared all of their classes that day, together. Nevertheless, Draco was polite to him whenever they passed each other in the halls. He had kept to his own Slytherin friends, but Harry had to remind himself that this was literally day one and to expect things to happen, whatever those things were, he needed to be patient with Draco.
Ron didn’t appear to have heard him however, as he chugged the bottle that Blaise handed him in earnest.
“Draco I...I’ve felt this way for a long time, but, the way my life has been for the past seven years, I guess I...I just never had the chance to decipher what those feelings meant.”
He could tell his best friends knew how he was feeling, but as either of them could do nothing to help, they remained silent and quietly hoped that their presence was enough of a comfort.
Hermione sat beside Harry, the two of them appearing just as amazed as each other at the sight of these unlikely pairings.
When Harry awoke however, he found himself tightly wrapped up in Draco’s arms, his head nuzzled into the blond boy's chest. Harry realised his hand was resting softly on Draco’s hip; half his hand on the fabric of Draco’s T-shirt, the other half grazing Draco’s skin, for his shirt had slightly risen up in the night.
Yes, Harry was used to the incessant staring. Not to mention the taunts that reached him from across the Great Hall or down the corridors, claiming he was insane or mental, but Harry would have readily exchanged those taunts for the ones that reached him now.
The boys nodded and they all turned to trudge back through the snow up the main street. Gold and red scarves obscuring their faces.
Harry realised he was indeed sitting on top of Draco. Draco’s arm that contained the Snitch was bent above his head and Harry’s hand had pinned in into the ground.
Hermione nudged Harry with that knowing look in her eyes. Harry scrambled to his feet. The three of them were the only ones left in the common room.
Harry heard him approach, then felt a hand clasp the Cloak and pull it roughly from his half-revealed head, now exposing his entire body.
Draco chuckled into Harry’s throat, kissing him once more just under his ear. His hand now leaving Harry’s pants to trace lines underneath the bottom of his shirt, along Harry’s hips.
“Please don’t tell me you’ve been in the library for five hours?” Ron asked as he turned to his girlfriend.
But Draco had already shifted forward, laying Harry back onto the hard stone floor. Draco hovered over him, looking, to Harry’s impatient frustration, incredibly sexy.
Harry had thanked Molly and Arthur profusely for his Christmas present, and had quietly given George the lowdown on the nature of his and Draco’s relationship, to which George accepted knowingly, saying that he’d alway seen similar traits Charlie had in Harry.
This was sort of a bridging chapter. Hogsmeade trips, Ministry inquiries, and Christmas at Hogwarts to come soon :) stay tuned
“Merlin Harry. As much as I want you dead… You know it wouldn’t be fair on me if you did get yourself killed.”
Hermione looked affronted, clearly outraged that someone who was so intoxicated could perform such skilled magic.
As Draco propped himself up on one arm while keeping the other firmly gripped on Harry’s hip, his grinding suddenly slowed, before the blond shuddered and groaned loudly, collapsing on top of Harry.
To add to Harry's potent mixture of emotions swimming in his stomach, he now felt relief. But no sooner had the relief swept through him, was he suddenly up on his feet and storming across the room ready to shout out his anger at an innocent Hermione.
“Before we’re burdened by more tiresome obligations and responsibilities of adulthood?” Hermione said.
Then Draco was growling eagerly into Harry’s shoulder, biting down on his skin, his grinding becoming erratic and Harry knew he was as close to climax as he was.
He sat down quickly, trying to gather his thoughts again despite being left utterly gobsmacked by his old Headmaster.
Harry suddenly felt abashed, perhaps he’d pushed Draco too far with the questions. This was the most they had talked in the past seven years.
Harry, at his worst and most reckless of times, would even make Draco jealous on purpose; perhaps flirt with Ginny or laugh loudly in the Great Hall, only to relish in the angered look on Draco’s face from the Slytherin table.
Draco turned to Harry once the couple were out of sight and grabbed his hand, “You’re definitely sleeping with me tonight.”
Harry felt a rush of fierce anger as he saw, clear as day, that the kid had a smug look on his face, as if he’d achieved what he’d set out to do.
Ultimately, the bridging gap was really up to the Slytherins and Gryffindors, whose rivalry went back decades. Both houses; full of fire and spirit, but where one was selfless, the other was selfish. But perhaps if they could meet somewhere in the middle, then the unity would be complete.
Harry suddenly became aware of the fact that he had indeed cut his chances, his precious chances of teaching Quidditch, with Draco.
“Dare or not, I don’t think I’d seen Potter get up from the floor quicker no sooner had the dare left my lips.”
“Yes but we can’t just sit back and bask in our glory,” Hermione said. “I imagine McGonagall will expect just as much from us as she does from the other students.”
He faintly heard Neville’s voice behind him, “Honestly at this point I just go with it. Harry’s mind works on it’s own agenda.”
He sat down between Seamus and Lavender. Then beside Lavender was Parvati, then Neville, then Theo, then Blaise, then Pansy, then Draco, then Luna, then Hannah, then Padma, then Ernie, then Justin, then Anthony and then finally, Dean closing the circle next to Hermione.
In the afternoon, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Seamus and Neville were sitting in the eighth year section of the library, trying to fit in some homework.
Draco sniffed as he crossed his arms, suddenly amused, “I’d pay to see the look on Weasel B’s face if he ever found out.”
Draco’s hand slid up along Harry’s neck and painfully gripped a fistful of Harry’s curly locks. The blond attempted to sit up, but Harry determinedly placed a palm on his chest and pushed him back down on the bed.
Harry reached around and tightly wrapped his arm Draco’s waist, as Draco rested his hand along Harry’s neck.
Harry had enough on his mind; between Voldemort’s repeated visits and his foreboding knowledge that the wizarding world would soon be in war… No, he simply could not be in love with Draco Malfoy.
Blaise raised his eyebrows as he studied Draco, “You look a little flushed Draco… Don’t tell me you’ve been fooling around with that bloke from Ravenclaw?”
Draco smirked, “I knew that Potter, that’s why I annoyed you so much because I knew you’d bite back, how else was I gonna get your attention?”
“I’m fine,” Harry lied, not looking at him. He reached for his wand, but Draco had grabbed his own first, and gently waved a Warming charm over Harry.
Harry spluttered, but quickly regained his composure, “If I’m not mistaken, it was you who was sucking on my neck.”
“Yeah, inter-house unity at it’s finest!” Pansy shrieked and Hermione laughed. Apparently the two got along now.
“It’s not a hotel Ronald. It’s a school. And just because we won the war doesn’t mean you get to stop working for the rest of your life.”
“That, and also the fact that I cop Death Eater comments every day and I guess I was bound to crack at some point.”
“I’m not surprised. He’s a nice boy, offered me food and water when I was in the dungeons at the manor, when his parents weren’t looking of course. He’s generous.”
And he pulled Harry from his bed, his shaken body leaning against Draco for support as the blond led him from his room, into his own room, and lay him down gently on his bed.
She exhaled frustratingly, “I could say the same to you two! On the Quidditch pitch for five hours!”
“Huh. So they allowed it to happen.” Harry said, a slight pang in his chest at the reality that McGonagall gave him Defence instead of Quidditch.
When he entered, he saw that the pillows on his bed were emerald green. He shook his head smiling, not even questioning the reason for their sudden change.
Draco moved his way up to Harry’s jaw, before tilting the brunettes head back with his hand and leaning down to kiss him.
At one point during their walk, Harry’s eyes gazed out onto the vast expanse of ice that had coated the lake’s surface, absentmindedly wondering if the Giant Squid would be feeling claustrophobic in the depths below,  just as he had once felt in that icy lake in the Forest of Dean a million years ago.
“No, actually, we’ll leave you guys to it!” Draco said loudly, before he was stumbling to his feet and tugging on Harry’s tie, pulling him up.
Again, I feel mental writing to you all the time. I like to think I’m not very selfish, but there’s this nagging feeling inside me that wants you all to myself.
As the age old rivalry between Gryffindor and Slytherin had evidently been passed onto Harry and Draco seven years before, who took it upon themselves to be the new leaders for the infamous divide, surprisingly, their newly formed friendship seemed to be doing the most in regards to eliminating house segregation.
Harry realised as he sat down, that he was relatively out in public despite the many Hogwarts students that adorned the pub. There were just as many adult witches and wizards as there were students and he felt the familiar sensation of being watched from all angles. He resolved to sit on a chair where his back was turned to the majority of the onlookers.
Draco began to stroke Harry’s hardened cock, and it felt like fire was running through Harry’s veins.
“I dunno, I just thought we could be friends,” Harry turned to look at him, “Obviously you know yourself best, but from an outsiders point of view, I know you’ve changed.”
“Whatever,” Seamus said impatiently, “I’m gonna ask Blaise anyway. More drinks the better right?” He winked at them all and then got up and left the library.
Harry felt Luna’s soft words wash over him, the war is over. Once more, that immense wave of relief washed over him and he could only chuckle at Luna’s eccentric words.
At this, the chatter and excitement broke again as they all made their way toward the staircases. Harry heard the distinct voice of Draco Malfoy muttering behind him.
He was on the blond before he knew what he was doing. Draco drew his wand but Harry gripped it and threw it away. He threw Draco up against the wall and punched his ribs mercilessly. As Draco groaned and bent in pain, Harry gripped his shoulders and kneed him hard in the stomach, causing Draco to choke on his breath.
Harry then reached up, grasping behind Draco’s neck and roughly pulling him down into a kiss. It was urgent and fiery, as if they both needed to let off steam and this was the perfect way to do it.
That was until Draco purposely bumped Harry with his shoulder, causing him to look up into Draco’s eyes.
Harry watched as Draco’s head tipped back against the wall, to allow Harry better access to his neck. The blond then gripped onto the front of Harry’s hoodie in order to pull Harry closer.
Ron’s parents are coming to stay in Hogsmeade over Christmas so Ron and Hermione are staying here too.
Harry, now painfully hard, shifted so he was straddling Draco’s hips. Draco welcomed the position as he continued to kiss Harry’s neck.
She straightened herself clearing her throat, “Right you are Miss Patil. I should hope they are making a good team, the other professors and I took a risk putting Potter and Mr Malfoy together, be sure not to let us down.” She gave a stern look between Harry and Draco. “Good day to you all.”
Draco giggled as he looked at Harry, cutting him off, “I haven’t liked anyone else since third year, so I guess that means I’m yours Potter.”
Harry nudged him slightly in the shoulder, “Aye, that’s if you get chosen. And who were you expecting really? Ernie MacMillan?”
As Draco’s head had fallen back onto Harry’s shoulder and his face was turned into the crevice of Harry’s neck, Harry softly whispered.
Harry awoke the next morning to warm fingertips running through his hair. He looked up to see Draco propped up on one elbow, grinning down at Harry as he ran his hand through the brunette's hair.
That was until… he felt the familiar warmth of Draco’s fingers caressing beneath the hem of his school jumper. His breath ghosting Harry’s cheek.
“That’s not true you daft git! You brought Draco out here and started threatening him and his mother!” Blaise yelled as he struggled to free himself from the man clinging his hands together behind him.
His thoughts then began to drift to the dangerous and confusing topic of Draco Malfoy, now suddenly even more awake at the mere fact that the blond was just on the other side of the wall. So much for eradicating that gravitational pull Harry thought to himself, now he was forced to be closer to Draco than ever, and to make things more confusing, he found that he enjoyed the proximity.
Disbelieving that he was capable of feeling such happiness, he softly ran his fingers through Draco’s hair in an attempt to materialise what he was feeling. It was like he had to prove to himself that this was really happening. Draco was in his arms, and they loved each other.
As Draco’s friends moved back towards the crowd, Harry realised he and Draco were the only two students left on the platform. The voices of students becoming more and more distant.
Harry, I can’t wait to talk to you. It feels like I’ve waited a lifetime for whatever is happening between us. I know that there’s always been something happening between us...but it’s only now that we’ve decided to divulge in it’s mystery.
A few moments later Harry found himself watching Seamus scramble through the common room door with a rolled piece of parchment in his hand.
Draco reached up and wiped a stray curl away from Harry’s eyes as he stared fondly down at him, “...You’re beautiful Harry.”
Draco still gripped Harry’s waist tightly as he breathed into Harry’s neck, the hot water still pouring over their bodies.
Finally resolving to give in to his infamous recklessness, Harry thought maybe, because he was so hard and leaking already, that perhaps if he just palmed himself through his boxers, he’d come quietly and then be done with it.
Draco gripped ever so tightly on Harry’s cock and before Harry knew it, he was coming hard into Draco’s hand. He bit down onto Draco’s neck as he came, so as to stop himself from groaning embarrassingly loud. His hips bucked into Draco’s hand as he rode out his high, feeling Draco’s hand rest on his hip to steady him.
“Well, McGonagall and the rest of the staff have transformed an unused tower of the castle into dorms and a common room just for the returning eighth years.”
The afternoon was passing pleasantly. Harry’s stomach continued to fill with warm Butterbeer and he soon forgot that there were still an abundance of witches and wizards stealing glances at him from across the room.
Harry turned to see a small smile on Draco’s face. Harry raised his eyebrows, “And I thought you were bad.”
Draco and Harry kissed for a long time. Their hands roaming delicately between one another. Their passionate and fiery magic intertwining. It's residue laid bare on their bodies.
Harry giggled as he hopped off his lap and threw Draco’s Slytherin T-shirt back over himself, “Can’t complain though.”
“Harry,” Ron cut him off, “Stop. It’s alright. I’ve got you and Hermione, George doesn’t have anyone-” Harry felt his chest tighten, “-so he’ll be glad you checked up on him. Really I should be doing more for him as his brother,” he said more to himself. “But as for me, I’m fine. But thanks anyway mate.”
They reconnected their lips and began kissing passionately. Draco digging his tongue into Harry’s mouth and Harry opening up for him readily.
The blond rested his hands on Harry’s hips, looking up at him seductively and Harry’s already painfully hard cock twitched.
McGongall left and all that could be heard was the ancient clanking of the door closing, and the soft crackling of the fire.
It would've had to have been 2 o’clock in the morning or so, Harry thought, but he didn’t want to move. Eventually he felt his eyes close, and his head drooping, the same homely smells of grass and parchment wafting around him.
As Harry’s eyes swept his room, all he could see was the comforting hues of metallic red and gold. His room looked much like his own Gryffindor dorm, except there was only one bed and it was quite larger than what he had previously. A deep red, soft and puffy looking doona lay across it with four pillows looking so comfy he was tempted to fall onto them right now.
“Yes...And no. I think it was just easier for us to deal with your insults if we just told ourselves it was because you were jealous...Still, that didn’t ever stop me from fighting back.”
“Maybe,” Harry looked at him seriously, “Isn’t that why we’re here? To make friends with the other houses?”
Harry returned to look at the fire and shrugged, “Well, in that case, I guess we just teach them the basics. Each position, how the scoring works… Not many first years can fly well so I think if we can manage to just get everyone up in the air, we’ll have achieved something.”
Harry shook his head furiously, “No! No… It’s-” His mouth was dry. He swallowed, trying to compose himself, “Look, this has been a rough year, and… And well, I’ve sort of found an escape with this person… You know, like a way to get my mind off everything. I-I don’t really know how it happened, but… But I’m late so I really have to go.”
Even though Harry had accepted her games, he would never let her walk all over him, especially not in front of everyone else.
“Harry you know you’re not a guest, you’re a part of our family and nothing will change that. As long as you want to live with us, you’re welcome.”
My probation officer told McGonagall everything. She wasn’t happy and demanded that I’d be set free at once, and that if they dared put anything about what happened to me in the Prophet, they’d face the wrath of Kingsely and your Order lot.
Ron’s voice was so loud, Harry couldn’t pretend he didn’t see the heads of his various teachers turning toward the loud and obnoxious Gryffindor.
On Friday afternoon at lunch, the eighth years were discussing Dean and Seamus’s new notice they’d pinned to the noticeboard: Eighth Year Party in the Room of Requirement. This Saturday at 9 PM.
Draco took off his shirt, and now Harry felt sick; his stomach was swirling with both arousal and anxiety, and once more he felt stuck helplessly between logic and irrationality.
Harry gasped. He pulled off Draco’s coat and ran his hands up beneath Draco’s skivvy, touching his stomach and relishing in the feel of Draco’s skin.
Before Harry could finish his sentence, a young, dark haired man about George’s age had appeared behind him and Draco, and had grasped roughly on Draco’s collar, pulling him back as if to pull Draco off his chair.
Harry’s heart was racing. He watched the Ministry wizard lead Draco and Blaise up the main street toward the path that takes them back to Hogwarts, feeling a pressing urge to run after Draco.
Harry actually felt himself hurt at that comment. Until all thought was lost as he suddenly felt Draco’s hand close on his shoulder.
“But surely I can go up there now and prove his innocence!” Harry said cutting Hermione off, “Surely if I vouch for him that’ll make a difference!”
Draco looked at his friend indignantly, “Really Blaise? We’ve known each other a million years and suddenly I’m ‘Potter’s boyfriend?’”
I’m sorry I haven’t been able to write sooner, the last few days have been...intense. I arrived at the Ministry on Sunday and was attacked by a wizard in the Atrium.
That evening in the common room, Harry laid on the floor facing Ron over a game of Wizard’s Chess. The common room was a whole lot quieter with only four occupants vacating the eighth year tower. The soft cackle of the fire and the peaceful symphony the house elves had begun to play on an old fashioned gramophone were the only sounds circling the room.
McGonagall wanted the remaining students to wear their robes for some ungodly reason, but Harry couldn’t bring himself to complain; seeing his platinum blond boyfriend clad in his black and emerald Slytherin robes had left him utterly flustered and aroused.
Platform nine and three quarters was bustling with students and their parents hugging one another as the white smoke puffing from the train made its way through the crowd. As Harry made his way through the huddles of people alongside Ron, Ginny and Molly, eyes from all directions burned into him. Barely suppressed whispers floated into his ears as he passed.
Harry felt his insides warm with love at the sight of the children so engaged with Draco, so enthralled at his words and explanations. He was smiling up at them from the ground and they looked back at him with awe.
Hermione rolled her eyes. Harry and Draco could only laugh at the descending state of Ron. Blaise, though flushed in the face, seemed to be able to hold his liquor a lot better.
Dumbledore peered at him. That same face boring into Harry, looking at him like he already knew everything.
Harry turned to see Draco on the threshold between the boy’s dormitories and their common room. A sneer on his face, his voice drawling. But no less looking undeniably flawless against the green glow of the windows.
It was just past midnight and he’d only just finished his excruciating Occlumency with Snape. His clothes were soaked in sweat, with his invisibility cloak draped over him as he ran down the darkened castle stairs towards the Slytherin common room.
“God Harry, your body,” Draco murmured into Harry’s neck between kisses, then lowered his hand even further to grip Harry’s cock.
Ron had suddenly redirected his gaze to the chess board to see one of his knights be thoroughly destroyed by one of Draco’s pawns.
“I think he might be,” Theo said, a mischievous smile on his face, “Got lost on his way back from dinner last night and happened to stumble right into Draco’s bed.”
Harry’s heart was beating in his throat. He looked to Draco, who was still looking into his lap, seeming to be patiently waiting for the wrath of Ron Weasley.
“What in the devils is going on here?!” An important looking wizard with a Ministry of Magic badge pinned to his robes said as he stepped forward.
And the worst of all, was when Harry would come meet Draco after he’d seen Snape for Occlumency, and Harry simply couldn’t tell Draco about what he’d been doing; the blond would outrightly sulk.
Ron, having apparently overheard their conversation, turned. He squeezed between Harry and Draco and threw his arm around the blond’s shoulders.
Harry’s hands roamed up Draco’s chest, pulling his robe off of him, then roughly gripping Draco’s tie to pull the blond closer.
Moreover, Draco had begun to adopt a muggle style and incorporate it with his already flawless  wizarding sense of fashion. The perfect combination of formal and casual. Dress pants but paired with a hoodie or sweater. Crisp white shirt one would usually wear with a tuxedo, but Draco undid the top few buttons at his chest and then tucked one side of it into the front of his black trousers and then left the other half hanging out loosely. It drew Harry wild, how he looked so smart and yet so relaxed. And then those tight black long sleeves he’d wear with a loose, T-shirt over the top, Merlin, the stuck up pureblood had really been left behind with the war.
Draco groaned into Harry’s neck and Harry moaned so loudly he honestly felt as though he would pass out with arousal.
Harry had no idea what Draco was thinking, was now the right time to bring up that gravitational pull that Harry believed urged the two together? Or would it be better to just come clean and admit to Draco that he liked him? What if Draco just thought this was a fun thing to do and he really had no feelings for Harry? The Slytherin was so free these days that he seemed to just go where the tide took him. He thought it better not to tell Draco how he felt, considering he was still distantly intoxicated and Draco might think he was just taking the piss.
Ron, now looking extremely put out, reluctantly took the pen from Hermione after she’d signed her name, then signed his own, and passed the pen to Harry.
“Not as bad these days, but sometimes the heat of the moment gets the better of her. I can’t talk though,” Draco chuckled as he stared at the lake, “I was so much worse than she was. Any chance I got to humiliate someone, I’d take it. And not just you Potter, I’m talking people in my own house.”
The stillness of the autumn air felt so good against Harry’s skin as he flew higher and higher above the pitch. The peach tinged sky was reflected beautifully against the lake and the castle and for miles he could only see the lush greens of the Forest and the Scottish landscape. It was a spectacular sight, not to mention Draco also flying in and out his sight to only add to Harry’s dreamy view.
When Ginny had ended it, she had said something to Harry that had left him confused, curious and somewhat afraid.
“So Dean and I went up to the Room at lunch to try it out,” Seamus said quietly. “It worked. There was everything we needed.”
Harry felt a tingle of excitement run down his spine as he realised that he wanted this. He wanted the chaos, the contradiction, the complexity, the fire. Those were the things that always had a way of seeping into Harry’s life, so why not share it with someone who he not only fancied and fell in love with, but with someone who knew what it was like to live amongst chaos and intensity.
At that moment, Harry and Ron snapped their heads toward the sound of the common room’s door opening.
Ron and Hermione were chatting animatedly about their upcoming Christmas in Hogsmeade with the rest of the Weasley’s.
“No,” Harry whined as he wrapped his arms around Draco. But the blond just kissed him softly on the cheek before he unraveled himself out of Harry’s grasp and stood up, straightened his clothes, and headed for the door.
Harry felt his heart rate speed up, “Well, actually...I was going to ask you that. You see, I was sure we went to bed together, but when I woke up you weren’t there?”
Whenever they shared classes together, Harry could practically feel the tingling magnetism between them and not to mention the many unspoken words. This infuriated Harry, to put it lightly, as he has always been one to wear his heart on his sleeve and voice exactly how it is he is feeling. As much as he wanted to yell and scream at Draco, he couldn’t even bring himself to admit the truth out loud. Harry would yell at Draco if he could, but deep down he knew that would take them straight back to dangerous territory.
When Harry turned to see Draco staring at him from the doorway to the bathroom, Harry noticed something he was surprised he hadn’t noticed before since sleeping next to Drack; his Dark Mark.
“I wasn’t sure if you wanted to sleep together tonight.” Harry said quietly, “I thought you’d be too exhausted.”
Then Draco moved forwards and their lips met in a soft purposeful kiss. Draco ran his hands up Harry’s abs beneath his shirt, as Harry gripped more tightly on Draco’s hair. The kiss wasn’t fiery as it had been last night. Instead, it was meaningful, as if they were making a promise to each other. Their lips moved slowly and they both melted into the gentleness of the kiss. It made Harry feel alive. He felt the traces of their magic swirl around them again. He was still so astonished at the impact somebody else's mere touch caused him, and Draco seemed to know this, because he touched and kissed Harry with purpose, as if he was trying to heal Harry’s loss and deprivation.
They both laid motionless for a moment, apart from the rising and falling of their chests. When Draco pulled back, his grey sparkly eyes were dark and he lowered himself to kiss Harry softly.
Harry, the closeness you speak of, I feel it also. I can feel the trace of your magic in all of the letters you’ve sent me. I hope you have figured out what this closeness might mean, not to mention the meaning behind the scent of your Amortentia :)
Thank you for sticking with me till the end, this was a fun fic to write, I will definitely be writing more drarry fics soon! xx
Blaise didn’t answer, but Harry felt the boy’s arm reach behind him and clearly pass a bottle of who knows what to Ron from behind Harry and Draco’s back.
“Why do you want me to sleep in your bed? Do you know how tricky that’s gonna be when we wake up and I somehow have to navigate my way out of here?” Harry hissed.
All the others eyed his shirt. Harry, who rarely looked in the mirror before leaving his room, only just realised he still wore Draco’s emerald Slytherin T-shirt. He thanked Merlin inwardly that Pansy didn’t happen to be with them.
The next few days into their first week went by relatively well, relatively meaning that Ron’s wish of a laidback year was irreversibly squashed. Their workload was much much like fifth year, except NEWTS were even more complicated than OWLS. He realised that the eighth year's gift of a brand new tower and bedrooms wasn’t just a simple thanks for their services to the school, but perhaps McGonagall's attempt at compensation for their treacherous year ahead, filled with long hours in the library and a constant look out for Hermione, begging for her help.
“Thank you Draco,” Harry said as some of the first years were murmuring, “Did you see that?!” “How did he do that?”
Draco simply shrugged, smiling slightly, “Yeah, but I also feel very good, so I guess it balances out.”
Harry could only stand there trying to catch his breath. OK, even if he hadn't admitted to himself he liked boys, he could definitely admit to himself that he liked Draco Malfoy.
On the rare occasions that Harry did visit this office, he’d noticed that Dumbledore was either asleep or else within his many portraits outside of Hogwarts.
They looked at each other for a moment, before Harry lent slowly and nuzzled his head into Draco’s neck.
Draco’s eyes flashed at him, his lips parted in an attempt to protest, but before he spoke, the hangings around them were drawn open.
Hermione, Ginny and Luna sat across from the boys. Hermione giving Ron a pointed, nasty look as she sat.
“Oh come on.” She grabbed his arm and they turned together toward the spiral staircase, Ron ranting as she pulled him along.
The man halted. Harry felt Pansy and Draco turn their eyes upon him, their eyebrows raised in amusement.
Draco laughed at his rambling, “I’m sure that can happen when you switch between the wizarding and the muggle world.”
“Look, we just wanna know if you’re alright!” Ron said defensively, “I know you’ve been having bad dreams but-”
Draco’s eyes flashed in anger, “And you talk a lot of game for someone who's gonna get what’s coming to them.”
“Stop.” He looked at Hermione. “Don’t fight. Not over my own stupidity… Merlin I’m surprised you two are even still talking to me.”
Harry didn’t want to move. He knew that Draco would be taken away today and Harry could only pray to the stars that the Ministry wouldn’t keep him for more than a day.
‘OK, so maybe I like men,’ he thought to himself. The thought, surprisingly, didn’t make him uncomfortable, in fact, it felt as though he was discovering a part of himself that hadn’t before had a chance of coming into Harry’s conscious. But now, with the war over, the Horcruxes destroyed, Voldemort defeated, Harry suddenly felt like he was learning to properly get to know himself.
Harry had spotted him leaving the hospital wing, probably having milked the punch Harry had thrown him, and was heading back to the Slytherin dungeons, alone.
Now all the students were spread out again across the room, even more comfortable with one another, and a whole lot more drunk (if that was humanly possible for Ron, Harry and Seamus).
As Draco turned to leave, he stood next to the seated Harry, and placed his hand on Harry’s shoulder looking down at him, “Well, I can tell you that I’ve worked out what your so-called ‘gravitational pull’ means between us. When you’ve managed to work it out, let me know.”
It was the day before Christmas Eve, and Harry had arranged a meeting with McGonagall so that he could tell her about his new aspiration to be a teacher.
“Yeah,” The blond shrugged, “I thought if I was mean to you I’d forget that I actually really liked you. Much good that did.”
Harry folded up and the letter and enveloped it. Then he walked to the fire where the grey owl still stood looking much warmer, and attached his letter to its leg.
The arm that was still draped over Harry’s body from before suddenly started moving, Draco’s hand sliding softly down Harry’s chest and stomach.
“Is that what your Dad told you was it? Him and Voldemort having a nice little chat over tea about how they’re gonna kill me?”
“That...that means...” Harry felt his heart rate beat faster and faster, “That we could live in the castle together!”
Now delirious with pleasure, Harry gasped again as Draco moved his hand over Harry's that was gripping the bulge in his shorts. Draco moved even closer to Harry now, so he was leaning a little over him. He removed Harry’s hand and replaced it his own, rubbing gently against Harry’s erection. He continued to kiss down into Harry’s collar bones. Harry threw his head back once more and gripped Draco’s hair tightly with his hand.
Harry had caught the Snitch first, and then Draco had captured it second. Now they were racing around, weaving in and out of each other to determine who would win the third and final match and declare victory.
Before anyone could respond however, Blaise and Draco appeared standing beside them all at the ‘Gryffindor’s end of the table.
