“Oh yeah, Ron, he’s great at conversation, as soon as he’s done pooing and drooling,” Harry deadpans and Draco makes a disgusted sound.
“So, you’re feeding me now?”
When Draco saw Potter slip out to the terrace, his need to get some air felt somewhat justified, seeing that even the Saviour himself decided to ditch his table.
. At the same time, deep under that layer of animosity and rivalry, Harry also wanted to be noticed, to be seen, and in hindsight, he’s sure Draco felt the same. Later on, Draco wanted to hurt him, to see him fail at all costs, and Harry wanted him to see reason, to change his mind, and in the end, Harry had wanted to
“No!” Hermione’s tone is far too defensive to assume she meant
Draco looks at him in question.
Kingsly turns to Harry with a grave expression. “Harry,” he puts his hand on Harry’s shoulder and quickly steers him a few steps away from the others. “Do you still have that emergency kit of yours?”
“Please note I said
Finally, they sit down in the dingy waiting room chairs, arm in arm, both nursing a cup of awful hospital coffee, both wearing grave expressions. They sit in silence that’s tense but companionable, something they’ve become adept at through years of friendship, and Harry’s grateful Ron doesn’t flood him with questions as soon as they have a minute alone.
If a few years ago, he was told that Draco Malfoy would become a permanent addition to their friend circle, Harry would probably shake it off with a polite laugh. But five years after going into Auror training, a few things happened in quick succession. After old Rodney Doves went into a well-deserved retirement, Harry was named the vice-head of the DMLE. He kept telling everyone it was a facade promotion and seeing how the only thing that changed was the plaque on his office door, Harry felt his exasperation was pretty much justified. He stood by it with unwavering certainty until one day, Robards summoned him into his office—one nicer than any of the Auror offices Harry had seen so far, with chunky armchairs and a large, polished desk, which only further confirmed Harry was just as bland an employee as all his colleagues. And that was fine, it had always been the way Harry preferred it. His self-reassurance lasted a whole four minutes during which Robards assigned him the task of finding and hiring someone for the Potions Master position to run their newly opened forensics department. The sheer confusion Harry felt must have shown on his face quite clearly when Robards, wearing the expression of someone who doesn’t like to hear any excuses, asked if there was a problem. Harry doesn’t remember his exact phrasing but he must have said
“Tell me,” Draco whispered back, not stopping his movements.
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry manages to choke out, twisting and straining under his hands. “Please. Fuck, please, yes,
. A week later, he had three interviews to conduct and no idea how to go about the whole business. Being a true Gryffindor at heart, Harry was nothing if not good at diving headfirst into things—he invited the candidates in, asked seemingly clever questions and watched how they interacted with the potions lab. The first one, a girl roughly his age, almost fell face-down over the threshold as soon as she saw him—and that was fair, Harry thought, wondering if he was being too lenient, or maybe too firm?—and it only got worse. After the poor woman broke the fourth beaker in ten minutes while trying to choke out the answers to his questions, Harry didn’t have the heart to keep her there any longer. An almost funny image of Neville in their Potions classes at Hogwarts flashed before his eyes as the girl stuttered her
kind of way. Like when you blow me,” he says, and Draco snorts at Harry speaking his language. “Do you expect anything in return?”
Suddenly, Harry’s stricken with realisation.
Malfoy runs a hand over his face. “When they were checking my testimony— In the holding cell. The two they left me with…”
“You can’t tell me there are no drugs in rich people places or— Wherever your crowd goes.”
Harry gets a Floo call from Mungo’s sometime after he wakes up from a sixteen-hour nap. He feels groggy and his head hurts so much it feels like it’s about to split in half, something he hasn’t felt since his scar-hurting times. He combs through the bathroom cupboard and hears the roar of flames just as he downs his last vial of Painkiller Potion, making a mental note to replenish his stash.
deceive me. Will that be all, mr Potter?”
Draco hums in confirmation.
Harry felt like an exposed nerve. “I’d make you stay.”
They lie like that for a few minutes, completely spent and breathing heavily, and Harry groans as Draco’s cock slips out of him. He has never felt so sated, so completely wrung out in the best possible way, and his heart has never leapt quite so much in his life.
Harry shakes off the thought—he shouldn’t find Draco
“Hey!” Ginny’s voice shakes them out of it. “We’re still here!”
He could feel Draco’s girth in his hand, imagined how it would feel slowly breaching him, sliding inside, setting him on fire. He was
Draco is, tragically, still not immune to the power Potter’s arse seems to have over him—and Potter is more than happy to volunteer it up for Draco’s worship, whether it be his fingers, his tongue or his cock.
“It’s a slow night,” Draco says, and kisses down Teddy’s spine. “Isn’t it, baby? A joint and a cock. And then another. Taking our time.”
is what that means, he would be gladly called a dog for the rest of his life. Draco fucks into him in fast, unyielding thrusts and Harry cannot, for the life of him, take his eyes off their reflection. Normally, he would let his eyes fall closed and ride out the mounting waves of burning pleasure, but not tonight—not when he can clearly see Draco burying his nose behind Harry’s ear and sucking bruises into his neck, not when he’s fixated on the way Draco’s muscles shift under his skin, not when Harry sees his hole stretched around Draco’s cock, pumping in and out, as come and lube drip down onto the sheets.
“You mean my life?” Harry asks. “Yeah, you could say that.”
“We Slytherins have our ways, clinging to idols and such,” he says with a laugh and leans in, propping his elbows on Harry’s desk. “Speaking of
Potter tilted his head and asked, “And how would one—”
“Enough to pester us with his heterosexual
—he jumped from his seat to check up on his nephew. It was heartbreaking, to see the poor little baby so tired and fussy he could only cry to indicate that all he wanted was some peace and quiet.
,” he says urgently. They need to be ready to leave as soon as Harry makes that poor excuse of a gangster reverse the curse. Draco pauses, looking Harry in the eyes with an unreadable expression, and eventually releases Dmitri; the man falls to the ground, wheezing and coughing as his lungs finally swallow some much-needed air.
And then, there’s Potter. Potter, whose eyes are nearly black, who’s still hard as rock and leaking down Draco’s shirt, who, Draco suddenly realises, is very much
“It would be easier if you just handed it over.”
“That’s pretty much what she said,” Harry shrugs. “Some new Healer for the Harpies, or something.”
“Do you think we’re being… stupid?” Harry finally asks, the conversation Draco had with Zabini all those weeks ago pushing itself to the forefront of his mind.
“What?”
Potter cleared his throat, and shrugged. “Looks like a torture device,” he said, squinting. “Or something… medical. Painful.”
that protection, seeing as you took an afternoon off to throw your buddies under a bus?”
Draco sighs. “No child deserves to be treated that way. None,” he says in a low voice. “Even in the mafia… children are off-limits, do you understand? Some poor sod would deal under the table and they would cut his hand off, but there would be tuition money in their vault
Harry’s blood
“Distract me,” he whispers into Harry’s ear, kissing it. “Help me trust you.”
“Harry,” Draco says urgently, one of his hands moving to cup his cheek. Harry goes quiet at the use of his first name. “While I’m not saying these… concerns are unfounded—” He takes a sharp breath. “You need to turn off that— Auror switch in your head. It’s not like we’ll get killed as soon as we step through the door.”
“Wait,” Harry breathes, grabbing his shoulder. “Go get your wand.
Speechless, Harry looks at his fuck-drunk face with wet hair sticking to his forehead, and at his body, naked, sweaty and completely ruined, draped over Draco like a two-Knut whore. His cock pulses at the very sight and he spreads his legs further, seeing Draco’s mischievous smile as he slowly pushes his cock inside him.
“Kingsley,” Harry says, squirming in his seat. “About that inside man thing—”
Harry wants to touch the bruises. To help somehow, to mend what he can; and while he’s not the one who did it, inexplicably, he feels responsible, hating the instinct at the same time. He wants to trace a finger along the Sectumsempra scars, too, to feel the sinewy ripple of evidence of the darkness inside him that perhaps only Malfoy knows how to ignite. “Why didn’t you say anything?” he asks abruptly, his mouth dry.
Harry doesn’t, not really. “And you just, er. Hit it off?”
“There are spells, sure, but those used to be cast on women back in the day.” He grimaces. “You know, when arranged marriages were all the rage, and the brides-to-be weren’t exactly as pure as their rich old betrothed would have expected. But, mind you, it was merely a physical procedure, now an outdated one, and thank Merlin for that.” Draco rests his head on Harry’s and the comfort of being able to talk to Draco about it makes something in his chest ache.
“I can eat on my own!” Harry looks around their faces, slightly offended at being excluded from the conversation.
about?”
“Mm.”
“You serve. You
Harry’s good mood evaporates as soon as he steps into the office—it’s like a Tripwire Curse was triggered, making everything go wrong in the craziest possible ways. He gets distracted and spills a little coffee from his paper cup straight onto Claire’s desk, earning himself a murderous glare and a straight-up refusal to remind him about an important meeting on Monday. He gets a scolding from Robards for nothing in particular which most likely means Kingsley found out about some paperwork discrepancies and requested Robards take care of them personally. Then, an overeager Auror newbie sees him in person for the first time and loses his cool so badly that the poor boy ends up tripping and dropping his salad all over Harry’s front. Harry doesn’t know what’s more annoying at this point—the guy’s profound apologies, his clear infatuation, manifesting in the form of a furious flush across his face, or the fact that despite a few heavy-duty Scourgifies, his uniform still bears the faintest smell of French dressing.
you?” Harry asks quietly.
Harry deflates a little at that, his heart going soft. Damn lovely Luna and her pure intentions. He pinches the bridge of his nose. “Yes, Luna, I appreciate it, I really do, but I was thinking of a companion I could… I don’t know, potentially think about spending the rest of my life with?” He can feel Draco’s gaze boring into him so he decides to keep his focus on Luna. “Not—the rest of
Wand. His wand is lost somewhere, so Harry focuses as hard as he can, feeling hot, desperate tears burning his cheeks and blurring his vision as he gently folds his palms over Draco’s ribs, just like he did all those weeks ago. He doesn’t touch him, doesn’t want to cause him any more pain, and Draco watches with a half-present expression as Harry keeps whispering the spell he had once sworn to never forget:
“Yes, aaaaah!
There’s a breath, a hand on his neck, and Draco pulls him in the rest of the way.
It’s been ten weeks since they started sleeping together and Merlin knows how many mind-blowing, toe-curling, sensual fucks that translates to. It’s a simple arrangement—they rile each other up at work and release the tension after, either at Draco’s flat or at Potter’s house on Grimmauld Place. Sometimes, they don’t make it to the bedroom and do it on the fluffy sheepskin rug Potter keeps in front of his hearth, as if specially for the occasion; sometimes, Draco ends up fucking Potter on his own, pristine kitchen counter, when the bastard is so worked up he simply strips right next to the wine cabinet. Watching Draco finish his water (he insists they hydrate before strenuous activities), Potter likes to lazily wank himself, stark naked, until Draco hurls his glass into the sink and throws himself at all the lush, warm body on display.
“I’ll do it,” Harry said simply, careful not to sound
“Seriously?” She asks incredulously. “You have so much in common, he’s a good guy!” Next to her, Luna nods with a serious expression.
His warm breath washing against Harry’s skin makes him suppress a shiver and Harry’s momentarily grateful he’s in too much pain to think about Malfoy’s lips and teeth and all the places where he could put them to use. “I can take care of myself—”
They end up choosing a couple of partly-obscured machines way in the back, so as not to attract any unnecessary attention if anyone manages to get through the wards—it’s not the middle of nowhere anymore, it’s a medium-sized town and Harry can still see people walking around, even at two o’clock in the morning. He fishes out all of their clothes, save for the ones they’re currently wearing, not willing to even hint at washing those as well. He throws a few off-handed instructions Draco’s way, to look like he knows more than he actually does, and once they find an abandoned bottle of detergent, they get down to figuring out the machines.
“Harry—”
They both moan into the other’s mouth and Harry gulps for air at the overwhelming feeling of
Harry wants to shove another biscuit down his throat.
“That’s your plan?”
Draco observes his surroundings with the suspicious expression of someone completely out of his element—he even seems to forget Harry’s watching and cautiously walks around the space, examining the buttons and dials on the machines, and skimming the instructions hanging on the wall. The launderette is completely empty save for the two of them and Harry’s maybe a little bit glad for it, considering the questions Draco might have, if he chooses to ask them, but he’s also strangely on edge and out of his element outside the relative safety of their hotel room. He feels watched in a way similar to those washing machines, like Draco’s trying to figure how
“Anything interesting?” The man asks conversationally. They don’t use names here, it’s forbidden. It’s encouraged to come up with aliases but they hadn’t had the talk yet.
“What?” Harry asks, feeling his heart flutter, wondering why Draco would bring it up.
Draco relaxes in his seat and, feeling brave, smirks at the group. “So about that little bet…”
“Why don’t you bake some bloody scones and hand them out in Azkaban—”
Harry wonders if
He doesn’t need to be told twice—Harry pulls his trousers down with his underwear, groaning as it brushes against his cock on its way. Finally naked, he crawls over Draco, stroking his hand over Draco’s thigh and hip, up to his waist and takes his mouth in a bruising kiss. Draco pulls him closer by the hips until Harry falls on top of him and they both cry out in pleasure as their cocks rub against each other in the crook of their hips.
” he says, poison dripping from every word. “They already have my mother, and it’s a matter of time until they get to me! Is that how your department works?” he asks with a vicious sneer. “Is that how you protect people? You can’t save me, Potter. You couldn’t save Dumbledore, or Sirius Black—”
safe, I want you, you, just you—”
Harry’s heart forgets how to follow any rhythm. “Do you always chalk everything up to one of the two?”
“He ate just before you came so it was a matter of time before he was out,” Harry says. “Babies are sort of like Ron. Not that hard to manage once you figure it out.”
is, he stops dead in his tracks.
“Fuck you—aah, ” Draco hisses, feeling their cocks rub through the fabric of their trousers.
Something ugly and panicked churned in Harry’s stomach when he finally put a name to that strange note in Draco’s voice.
His voice wavered; a barely-there, invisible twitch skitted across the presenter’s face, immediately schooled into journalistic objectivity. Even in the blurry image it was evident his jaw was clenched tight. He continued in a blank voice, devoid of all the emotions currently roaring in Harry’s caving chest. —
Draco was kissing the hollow of his collarbone when the flash came.
They breathed, holding each other for a few seconds and then, Draco gently pushed him towards the love chair—an apt name, even though Draco wasn’t quite ready to put a name to what they were doing. The sole fact there might have been a name scared the shit out of him until Harry kissed him, leaning against the seat.
“Oh for the— Malfoy,” Harry hisses, making him jump. “Just tell me. Did you
“She seems… eager,” Harry says politely, his eyebrows nearly hitting his hairline.
so fast, Harry’s wand immediately flies out of his hand. Luckily, he manages a wandless
“You’re scaring me a little,” Draco says with a knitted brow. “Are you hurt?”
“It smells like I imagined you’d taste,” he said. Draco’s breath caught in his throat into a strangled groan when Harry looked him in the eyes and licked his hand. Slowly, from the heel of his palm up to the tips of his fingers.
escapes Draco. “That’s intriguing,” he hums. “Let me think—given that you already know all my sins, big
The kiss was irregular, broken and renewed with a shifting kind of energy each time they dove back in, like the Autumn weather outside; in was the sun, warm and careful, unsure if it was welcome, then out, and then back again was a thunderstorm, cold, wet lips and a biting lash of electricity down Harry’s back, all the way to the tips of his toes.
“Potter,” he holds out his hand, pale fingers glistening with rain in the pearlescent light.
“Much better,” he whispers.
“Fuck,” Draco whispered, kissing him deeply, “yeah, all of it, whatever you want.”
Draco can only nod curtly.
seeing him cast, or watching his fingers hold it with a delicate, deadly force, like a feather falling onto a landmine, it’s a duty to his job and his own sanity he can’t quite bring himself to carry out.
“Oh my
As soon as Harry’s fingers brushed the place the glands must have been, barely able to get a feel of their shape, Draco bucked forward, crying out. “
“I see you eyeing it, you know,” Draco said one afternoon, looking over some abysmally boring paperwork and signing off reports to Floo back to the office.
They reach the interrogation rooms across the hall of the holding cells in the western wing. A quick look at the enchanted board says all of them are empty save for one—probably some poor sod caught publicly drunk, or some petty thief who tried to nick a few potions on Diagon. If it were someone who’s big news, Harry and Ron would have known, usually getting the lead on more serious cases—any one of them could have ties to the Family these days and the Minister has personally ensured his top Aurors are well-informed at all times.
, unabashedly nosing at the wet spot in the front.
When Harry gets back to the Atrium, he lets out a relieved sigh. He can see Robards, standing in the distance by the central fountain. He’s pacing nervously and stops dead in his tracks, staring at Harry with a deer-in-the-headlights expression, his silent shock strangely disconcerting.
Hermione ignores the jab. “And be good.”
“Sometimes it seemed… almost sentient.” Draco huffs and shakes his head again. Harry gets it—years of friendship with Hermione have taught him that people like her and Draco believe some things have just no right to exist, even in the world of magic, and being confronted with things like sentient potions usually causes frustration rather than sparking any academic curiosity.
Malfoy’s jaw twitches. “I said I work with them, didn’t I?” he asks testily. “I’ve been collecting it in secret. For… years. A little personal safeguard, if things ever went south,” he says. “And they did. So I need you to take this, I need you to blow up that bloody mafia to smithereens, I—”
“There was a sound like a Mountain Troll giving birth so forgive me for assuming you’re not in your right mind, Mr Potter.” She looks at him expectantly and Harry feels like he’s about to get detention. There’s also something motherly underneath her cool gaze and that causes him to back down a little.
“You’re staring,” Draco murmured, his shoulders tensing under Harry’s intense gaze.
“It’s been a year, you know.”
The visit wasn't exactly
That’s as far as facts went and, frankly, there wasn’t too much to go on guesswork-wise either. The press was eerily silent about the fates of the innocent members of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, regardless of the reality of said innocence. Whether it was a deliberate act of defiance against the laws of the old, or whether substantial sums of Galleons still stashed in estates’ secret vaults were quietly passed on to people who were willing to put their silence on sale, it didn’t matter. The renaissance of the shady elite has still come full circle just like it always does throughout history. The Family reared its head suddenly, bearing no resemblance to Voldemort’s old methods and now, Draco Malfoy sat in front of Harry claiming he had information about them.
Harry dreams about dragons and the sounds of gunshots, feeling strange, cold knots curl around his stomach, but all of that dissolves into an afterthought when he wakes up to a warm, soft body wrapped tightly around him. It’s not that he expected Draco to bolt, or to move to his own bed somewhere during the night, but Harry’s foolish heart still flutters helplessly as he cracks one eye open and sees silvery-white tufts of hair spilling onto the pillow.
“Did you lock him up?” Robards asks with a manic glint in his eyes, looking around the hall impatiently. “Level seven?”
Harry exhales. One, two times, the images of him and Draco yesterday morning still fresh in his mind. “Yeah,” Harry whispers and swallows thickly. “Yeah, we did.”
,” he continues, clearly biting down a smirk. “Just like it probably says in your little files, my mother and I left Britain and went to France.”
Draco was so tense Harry wanted to ask if it was okay, if it was going to hurt, but perhaps the temptation was too much to resist. The trust Draco put in him made something unfurl in his stomach, going deeper and growing hotter with every quiet exhale, and Harry was hopelessly trying to control his breathing as he lifted a shaking hand to gather some of the oil in his hand, going up towards the base of the wings.
, next to the list of his favourite tea brands, amongst scattered notes on the biscuits he likes, things he needs but won’t admit out loud, and things he thinks about himself but aren’t true. Some of those things are too big and important to fit in drawers so Harry learns those and commits them to memory, remembers Draco won’t always wear them like a heart on a sleeve, raw and alive; those things are rare and fleeting like a dream—Harry sometimes wakes up and can’t remember if they’re actually true.
It all feels slightly criminal and maybe that’s why they keep doing this dance, where instead of opening doors, they pick locks; instead of admitting what they need, they allow the other to steal it and keep it close to their chests. That’s why they keep touching themselves but never each other, and talk about philosophy but not what they truly want.
“Fuck, Harry—” he breathes, not entirely present, his eyes unfocused with arousal. “Oh my— Fuck, get
“Oh cheer up love, you must admit the babysitter idea was a pretty porny one to begin with,” Ron chuckles, massaging her shoulder, and Hermione scoffs at him.
Ginny and Luna are unusually quiet and sure,
he says, whispering the last word.
“Malfoy, there’s no time,” he grits out, already hearing footsteps behind the corner. “They’re
“Malfoy,” Harry lifts his hands in a placating gesture. “I’m me, remember? I don’t bloody want it, I’m not going to abuse it, I just need to cast it. It’s procedure—you’re still a criminal until you testify,” Harry says, tired. He wants to lie down.
“You’re Ron’s best man so you need someone with you for the official part,” Hermione says, raising a hand as soon as Harry opens his mouth. “I’ll explain everything later. So. Since you’re not dating anyone, we could set you up with someone.”
. It wasn’t Narcissa—it was never meant to be Narcissa, it was Robards’ wife. The Family wanted the DMLE to know they had found her in France so they had leverage, not over Draco, but over Robards. Which means…
with a half-eaten box of pizza on the coffee table?”
Draco’s gaze lingers for a few more seconds before he picks up the book. Harry’s relieved he can just take a few minutes to unwind and Draco never pushes or picks his brain. A change of topic is sort of an unspoken plea of
talents were still at the Ministry’s service, he scoffed, saying that Harry would be helpless without him and that someone needs to be captain on this bloody sinking ship, sailing the dark and unfriendly seas of bureaucracy. In reality, Harry thinks Draco simply likes his job and the guidance he can give in his position makes him feel like he can help young people with their careers. He doesn’t need to tell Draco that, though.
“I need to—” Harry groans as Draco bites at his neck and sucks hard kisses into his skin, his stubble leaving it reddened and sensitive. He’s going to have bruises and the mere thought of being marked makes his cock drool in his trousers. The lovebites aren’t even visible yet and Harry’s already half-aware he won’t be healing them—there’s something thrilling in the idea of him looking in the mirror tomorrow and seeing Draco’s marks, being claimed with those lips and teeth for everyone to see, for Draco to know, and for Harry to feel—a tender, physical reminder of their activities. The thought turns up the heat growing at the base of his spine, making Harry bare his neck in a silent plea for more.
Draco pauses, his pale eyebrow arching in question. “Really.”
It sends a rush of sensation up his arm and this, this is his own brand of
“Apparently, pampering you is now my job,” Harry says with a lopsided smile. He’s feeling a little tipsy but still sees Draco’s eyes darken just a fraction, contrasting with the smile still plastered to his face.
A shrug. “Long enough.”
“It’s not that—”
A woman who lived four houses over, if Harry recalled correctly, collapsed onto her knees in front of their driveway and let out a piercing shriek—it was heart-wrenching to watch her, hopeless and defeated, sitting on the curb and crying her heart out, unable to even breathe, let alone stand up and get to safety in time. Draco sobbed at the sound and Harry held him closer with one arm. He waved his free hand and the curtains closed. Another sharp wave and a Muffling Charm fell over the room, successfully cutting off most of the sounds coming from outside.
Harry’s coming down, and the fog in the corners of his eyes clears enough for him to notice he still has his hand on Draco’s thigh. It feels almost unbearably good, and embarrassing, too, to crave that scrap of skin contact, to crave the feeling of
“I knew the prat wouldn’t tell you himself,” Ron says. “Too proud for his own good.”
Harry sends thanks to whatever Forces That Be that must have been listening that they arrived on the side of an empty road—no Muggles in sight, no cars, no civilisation for another kilometre or so. Nearby, there’s a sign with the town’s name spray-painted over, and Harry would maybe be worried about it but the anonymity their surroundings granted was exactly what he was hoping for.
There’s another set of footsteps reverberating in the empty hall and Harry turns to see Draco running towards them with his gun aimed straight at Robards. He’s hurt—a trickle of blood drips down his face from a large wound at his temple, sticking his fringe into a bloody cluster, his suit is singed in a few places, and he has a split lip. But all Harry can focus on are his eyes—shining with unrestrained, wild fury, like two pools of molten silver as he zones in on Robards.
Harry plops down next to him, legs crossed, back against the rails. “Figures I’d find you here,” he says, uncapping his beer.
“Do it,” Harry whispered, trying and failing to thrust into Draco’s fist. “It’s okay, fuck, I’m close.”
Something wild and uncontrolled flashes across Malfoy’s face and Harry savours the challenge; a thrill of excitement goes up Harry’s spine at discovering he still remembers this years-old dance. Malfoy has just swallowed the bait and if the little twitch in his jaw is anything to go on, the conversation they’re about to have will be all kinds of interesting. Harry doesn’t waste time wondering when he last felt this kind of anticipation.
He huffs out a surprised laugh. “I’ve never liked it.”
“I wasn’t planning to,” Draco murmured, slowly coaxing Harry’s mouth open.
For a brief moment, Harry wonders if it’s actually concern for his withered loins that drives Ginny, or if winning the bet is just a victory lap for her competitive streak that’s the main motivating factor here. Either way, it looks like she thought of everything, the sly fox. “Ginny, I don’t know—”
Potter.
They get off the ride and as soon as they’re out of eyeshot, Draco grabs Harry’s elbow and drags him off to the side.
“I—” Harry deflates. “Nevermind,” he barks.
Harry paused, frowning. “What do you mean?”
“Hey,” Harry said and took a step closer. “It’s all right. What’s going on?” He was using all the self-restraint he possessed not to do something reckless, like come closer, or touch Draco’s back. Or kiss him.
“Did you just
“What?” Harry pauses. “Why— How did you come to that conclusion?” He feels his face is heating up again and it’s not fair, to end up an apple-cheeked maiden, thrown into
Draco glares at him. “Yes, because we have a bloody network all across London?” He hisses.
Draco turned to reach the nightstand where he, presumably, kept his lube, and a thought crossed Harry’s mind, a thought that nearly made him come on the spot, his cock filling even more at the very idea.
Harry stands up and takes a step forward, a wide, impish smile on his face. “C’mere.”
Harry opens and closes his mouth, maybe a little offended at how easily Malfoy assumed Harry thinks the worst of him, and maybe a little ashamed, too, of how quickly he jumped to conclusions, which seems to be a pattern for him whenever Draco Malfoy is concerned.
. He sprints to the bedroom to change out of his pyjama pants, not paying any attention to the head in his fireplace, screaming something about ‘limited visit times’ and ‘still very weak’. Remembering about his manners, Harry runs back to thank him and Apparates on the spot.
“I’m not asking—” Harry chuckles. “I think there’s enough facial hair between the two of us,” he says, absently scratching at his beard. It’s very neat, even if Harry says so himself, and he keeps it short—he’s been told it makes him look more refined and goes well with his position, uniform, and status. Harry doesn’t really care about all that, he just likes the way it feels and—quite frankly—hates razor blades with a passion, only resorting to them for… other areas, while also being absolutely pants at Shaving Charms. He hopes it doesn’t look too bad. The beard, that is.
“All right, fine,” Harry sighs. “I also maybe wanted to vent. You won’t believe what Ron and Hermione did. Well, I’m pretty sure it was… eighty per cent Hermione.”
“I charmed,” he says simply. Harry frowns. “I seduced, persuaded, baited, and coaxed,” Malfoy lists. He peers at Harry from under his fringe with a mischievous gleam. “I
“Ron, I think this is as far as our check-up can go,” Hermione says with a laugh and they turn to leave. “We’ll keep in touch.”
“How do I know you’re telling the truth?”
To know Malfoy’s reaction before even proposing it is a poor victory but Harry says it anyway. “I can try another way. With, er”—he swallows—“my hands.”
“I do like a strong, silent Slavic man,” he says dreamily and Harry rolls his eyes. “They’re much more straightforward over there, mind you, and
They can see their faceless coworker come around the corner through the glossy veil of the Cloak and Potter’s mouth falls open in a slight smile as he smears saliva all over Draco’s kiss-swollen lips. Draco, still trying to control his breathing, chases the touch with his tongue as Potter traces the shape of his mouth with filthy-wet fingers.
“Don’t worry about it.” Draco goes silent but definitely feels Harry staring a hole in the side of his face. Finally, he breaks. “Look, if he were a breakfast food, he’d be porridge. Perfectly bland and regular but also nutritious and a choice that’s…”
“Do you have a smell you hate?” Harry asks abruptly, thinking back to the disastrous date. Well, not exactly disastrous—still, somewhere oh his way back, Harry decided he’s not going to pursue anything with Amy.
The door opens an inch and a cloud of purple smoke seeps out through the crack in a flurry of glittering swirls that slowly curl down, spilling over the floor like a nebulous magical carpet. Through the thin fog, Harry can make out a sweaty brow and a brown eye glancing at him with suspicion until it lightens up with recognition. The door opens wide and Harry steps through the smoke curtain accompanied by the intern’s excited babble.
exactly who they wanted to kiss in a room full of people and it turned out to be their spouse or secret lover, or… you know. You’ve been to the Department of Mysteries. You saw the,” he gestures vaguely, “pink room. What do you think they study there?”
“Do it,” Malfoy says hoarsely. “I accept your conditions.” His eyes are the only thing that betray him, shining with renewed determination but a shadow of fear, too, almost unrecognisable in the deep, calm silver.
with you today?” he asks, closing the books he’s currently reading with a loud smack. Harry stiffens, refusing to meet his eyes. “It can’t be me, I am delightful company,” he says off-handedly, “so what is wrong with you?”
Harry ignores him, feeling his fury bubbling on a low simmer, deep in his gut, filling his lungs with black smoke, and sending little hot pulses of magic down his arms. “Kitchen,” he barks, not looking back, Draco’s footsteps the only indicator he’s following. He pulls out his phone, types a quick text to Ron that he won’t be able to make it today, and throws the phone onto the table with a loud clatter.
Draco would hate it, Harry thinks, if he told him, really, how careful he’s being. How he can’t help but treat him like the finest china that would shatter with one false move. And it’s not because Draco is a wilting, delicate flower, too fragile to grab, to push, to
“You disgust me,” Harry spits, “All that blood—”
There’s not much time to ponder over all the events that led to this moment—Harry opens his desk drawer and memories of the Horcrux hunt flood his mind like a river after a drought. He allows himself to run his fingers over the soft, worn leather for a second, feeling strangely emotional thinking about everything he went through with his two best friends. His jaw clenches at the thought of what needs to be done now; Harry ties the pouch around his neck and hides it under his uniform. With its weight secure and solid at his chest, Harry casts one last look at his and Ron’s office, wondering how soon he will get to see it again.
“I need a shower,” he says abruptly, and lifts himself off the bed. Draco bolts away, and busies himself with the kettle even though the water must have gone lukewarm a good fifteen minutes ago. He only turns around when Harry opens the bathroom door, mouth open around a question. “I won’t mess it up,” Harry says, lifting his patched up hand.
Quando il diavolo ti accarezza, vuole l’anima - When the devil caresses you, he wants the soul (Italian proverb)
“Care to elaborate on that?”
The shower is cramped and its water pressure leaves something to be desired but Harry nearly moans when the first scalding-hot rivulets drip down his back. It’s getting late and only now Harry fully realises it’s still the same day—just hours ago, he was interrogating Malfoy at the Ministry. Just hours ago, he was having lunch with Ron, chatting and having coffee. And then, inexplicably, Harry found himself extracting a possible high-profile witness who just happened to be his old school rival, arch-nemesis, and a general pain in the arse.
“What’s wrong?”
The Head Auror finally lifts his gaze from the file he’s holding and freezes as he notices the stranger. Rheumy eyes swipe over the room so quickly it could almost be missed, a paranoid little habit that always betrayed them quicker than the offensive scarlet of their uniforms.
Draco kissed him again, pettily, still holding on to the bubble of the revenge scenario and Harry played along for now because while he wasn’t exactly patient, Draco was careful and conflicting in a way that reminded Harry of a scared cat.
“I need to get to the Aurors’ office,” Harry finally says, some semblance of a plan beginning to crystallise. In moments like this, he misses Ron—his strategic thinking, the logic of a seasoned chess player that perfectly complements Harry’s rather wild and particular kind of brute force. It’s what makes them good partners—more of a ying-yang sort of balance, rather than brains and brawn—and at this moment, Harry really needs a dash of logic in the eerily empty Atrium.
“Wait,” he whispered, and gently pulled Draco back by the wrist, flushing at his questioning glance. “We can— Here,” he said.
“That’s better,” Draco says softly, a questioning note ringing at the end of the sentence.
“Goodbye, my love,” Draco smiles softly, tucking a lock of wavy, blond hair behind her ear. “
“I… see,” Harry says, treading carefully, curious if Draco will say anything more.
He pauses as Draco’s fingers wrap around his wrist. He gently guides Harry’s hands so he plates the last pancake and turns the stove off. And then, Draco pulls him away, turns them and promptly devours Harry against the kitchen counter.
“It’s the Family,” Harry says darkly, “it must be.”
“Why did you need me here?” The question hangs in the air and Harry isn’t sure anymore, only knows that Draco made this disappointing night better by just showing up. It feels too big to say for some reason, like Draco would maybe laugh at him or ask him to elaborate and Harry has no answer to that, not yet.
Apparently, the amount of creature genes present in Draco’s blood in particular was plenty enough to randomly induce a Veela awakening in the middle of a fucking raid, an awakening Draco had expected as much as one expects it to rain frogs. Harry tried very hard to contain himself when in fact, he wanted to bombard everyone around them, and Draco specifically, with an onslaught of questions, including but not limited to: what was going to happen now, how could Draco not know, what did it mean, and why did it happen.
. “Excuse me?” He crosses the room, walks around Harry like a predator circling a prey that’s a match for him, calculating the odds with an amused arch of his brow.
Harry quietly sat down at the corner of the bed, not knowing what to say.
Harry just nods, not lifting his head, and feels the familiar tingle of magic wash over him, including the spot where Draco’s finger is.
a safe choice, I don’t
“And you?” Draco gasps. “Fucking jock, with your muscles and—
Draco lifts his hands and draws invisible lines in the air, his slim fingers casting shadows in the dim room. “Every action creates a reaction. Energy flows, matter circulates, and magic… is. Studies show that even when we Summon something, seemingly from the Aether, it has to come from somewhere. If it didn’t, every Conjuration Spell could tear the very fabric of what we know as
Draco didn’t waver. “He’s not going to buy it. And we’re not having sex.”
There was something profoundly melancholic in the furrow of Draco’s brow. “Not nearly enough to excuse this.”
to find his glasses and wand in the middle of the night. At one point, Ron—or perhaps it was Hermione—pointed out that Harry had just Levitated a tray of tea with his wand still sitting on the coffee table. That day, Harry realised he hadn’t used his wand at home for weeks, instinctively letting his magic flow through his fingers, as easy as breathing, and the excitement, the feeling of
“Draco, gods, we’re forty.”
Daniel kisses him. It’s a soft peck, it’s tame and safe and all the things that Daniel is and he doesn’t taste like chocolate or wine, doesn’t smell like citrus and spice and the thought of his lips on Harry’s doesn’t send a shiver down his spine like it ought to. He breaks it off after a second or two like he’s been hit with a Stunner and if Daniel is surprised he doesn’t show it, being the kind, polite, perfect model of man that he is.
Harry grabs his wand and casts a tiny stinger that misses Draco’s mussed hair by an inch.
The Muggle movie reference doesn’t go over Harry’s head but he leaves it be, not wanting to set Malfoy off into another of the fruitless back-and-forths he seems to enjoy so immensely. “Wards are down, Malfoy, so get on with it. You’ve wasted enough of my time.”
“All right,” says Harry, slowly extending his right hand, “I’ll try to mend the other rib, yeah?”
“Wha— why would she do that?!” He turns to Ginny. “
“What? Ah, I suppose,” he says distractedly, a rueful smile creeping up on his face. “Seeing Dmitri again reminded me— It’s an old Russian folk song,” he says sifting through the odds and ends in the kit, discarding a pack of plasters but setting aside a few rolls of bandages.
Draco swallowed. “Potter I—”
He clears his throat. “Thanks. D’you need any spare clothes?”
Harry nods and follows, shooting a sympathetic smile to Swan on the way, as the boy scrubs some beakers in the sink—Draco doesn’t let them Scourgify the equipment, claiming it’s not as thorough as hand-cleaning which also
Ron chokes on his beer, forcing out his words between coughs. “Harry, wait,
“I don’t see how that’s relevant.”
“Now!”
Oh, Draco.
Harry had a hard time adjusting after hearing those verdicts, knowing that justice had not been served, not entirely. Those who avoided Azkaban scattered all across Europe, most finding refuge in summer estates all along the French Riviera, and began planning and regrouping only to resurface two years later, and do so with a ghastly flourish.
“All right, I guess,” Harry says. “What else can you tell me? There must be something wrong with him, you know, given my track record.”
Before him stood Draco—impossibly beautiful, winged, and very distractingly shirtless. Harry could only helplessly stare and fall deeper and deeper in love with the man, with his weary expression and arms twitching as if wanting to cover himself, with the place his teeth pressed down on his lower lip, with the way his glorious wings fluttered under the scrutiny.
“Tell me,” Draco says, crossing his arms. “Have I missed the moment when we’ve turned fifty?” he asks haughtily, shaking his head in disbelief. “Shall I whip out my knitting equipment as we mindlessly chew on candy floss with our withered mouths—”
And if Harry took a closer look or two at those pictures on the odd night, that’s nobody’s business but his own.
all along. Draco shares the sentiment, judging by the groan he lets out in response—the kiss is now a slow, deliberate slide of tongues, Draco’s fingers ghosting over Harry’s clothed ribs and tangling in his hair. At one point, Draco carefully takes his glasses off and puts them on the coffee table. The slight change of angle makes them both gasp and as Draco stretches to reach the table, Harry sees the tented front of his trousers, sees the outline of Draco’s cock through the fabric and suddenly, he becomes aware of his own arousal and the low, bubbling heat building up at the base of his spine.
“Is that…” He trails off, watching the hot-pink liquid’s slow swirl against the glass.
“Life, Harry, my dear boy,” Ginny says gravely and Harry snorts. Fine, whatever. He’s done this so many times already, it can’t hurt to just go along with it.
“You’re in love with me.”
Draco pushes him back a few steps until he has Harry against a large oak tree in a small clearing off the nearest path. The sounds of commotion are almost completely drowned out by the thick foliage around them and Harry watches Draco take a steadying breath. “You have to immediately Apparate us to our room because—the things I want to do to you right now might be
know you, Harry.”
“Hello, anyone here?” A disembodied voice muffled by magic echoes across the lab. The Unspeakable’s footsteps are getting closer and Potter pinches Draco’s nipple with his free hand, the absolute prat, and moves his fingers so Draco can breathe through his mouth, more quietly.
In the end, he doesn’t reach for it.
Harry chokes on his saliva under the Cloak and quietly thanks Merlin and Morgana none of the Muggles heard him. He chooses to believe what Zabini just said is some kind of a Slytherin inside joke, and tries not to think about all of Malfoy’s lewd, shameless comments, or his ridiculous, messy hair, or his black leather gun holster. The whole comment is just ridiculous, and Harry can’t imagine he would ever cross that line with a witness, and Malfoy no less.
“Yeah, Draco, why?” Harry asks, abandoning all hope of putting on a t-shirt. Instead, he jumps up on the kitchen counter and watches his… charge-turned-lover-turned-maybe-boyfriend in amusement as Draco squirms.
Draco stares at him like he hung the stars and Harry’s stomach flutters like it’s made of butterflies. Finally, the crease is gone and Dracos’ lips curve in a small smile. “They’re going to lose their minds, you know.”
The hotel is small and… unassuming, for lack of a better word. They walk across a morose-looking car park—the concrete is cracked and overrun with weeds sprouting through the gaps, extending and growing all over a pile of old rubber tires that’s displayed under the fence for no apparent reason. Harry chuckles under his breath, seeing that Malfoy wants to ask, and he almost prompts him to, but the blond decides against it and follows Harry inside.
“I’m the voice of reason, you can’t automatically assume people are all smiles and sunshine—”
Turns out, Draco’s secret Unspeakable partner is Harry Potter.
you’re always right—”
Honestly, if he were staking out the place, Harry would arrest himself.
,” he adds with a sly smile.
“Ahhhh,
, he really needs to convert Draco to something less flashy, maybe some wildlife programme or just the weather.
“Does this,” Draco whispered, and leaned in, and touched Harry’s lips with his own, “feel like I’ve moved on?”
To say that reporters are waiting in front of the Ministry is a gross understatement—they’ve virtually built a small encampment, collectively jumping to their feet as soon as they see Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who hastily retreat back inside, opting to use to the Floo to get to Grimmauld. Draco has to stay behind, to sign a heap of paperwork regarding his deal and finally get his wand back, and while Harry hates that he has to leave him there, he decides it’s not a big deal to wait just a little more before they can take the first real breath after all they’ve been through.
They step into Draco’s small office—still bigger than Harry’s, which Draco likes to remind him about any time the occasion arises—and take their usual spots: Draco in an over-the-top leather chair behind his desk and Harry in a victorian armchair facing the desk. He plops the paper bag on the desk and Draco immediately snatches it and takes a whiff of the fragrant chocolate pastries. “Ah, yes,” he hums, “you’ve done well, Potter, very well.”
Draco’s breath sped up and up until he was coming all over Harry’s fist, writhing in his grip, and Harry thought he had never seen anything more beautiful or raw, and he momentarily regretted they were doing this in a bathroom instead of a proper bed with sheets and a space to gather Draco into his arms. He wasn’t sure if it was that thought that finally brought him over the edge but Harry came with a muffled shout, filling up the condom and gripping Draco’s hips tight enough to bruise.
For now, Harry lets himself melt into porcelain skin and almond-smelling sheets, and waits for the inevitable endgame.
“What on earth are you laughing at, you lunatic?” Draco grumbles, elbowing him for good measure while trying to prevent his drink from spilling.
“Scared, Potter?”
,” Draco continues with an eye roll, “Summoned water is a different story entirely.”
“I don’t have to,” Draco says softly, so quiet Harry almost misses it.
Harry’s quiet, trying not to think of the prize Draco’s talking about, hoping it doesn’t show on his face.
“Yeah,” Harry sighs. “Bye.”
Draco rolls off of him and Harry whimpers at the loss of his delicious, comforting heat. It doesn’t last long, though—Draco immediately takes Harry into his arms and kisses him with a satisfied sigh, hand moving down in between his arse cheeks. Harry blushes for some ridiculous reason—Draco’s
Weasley scoffs at that. “No fucking way he's won. I refuse to believe Malfoy of all people had the best candidate.”
“Pansy, I’m telling you, it might be the best one I’ve ever seen,
“Good,” Draco says and places one last kiss to Harry’s neck. “Try to relax,” he adds softly.
with the witness.”
Draco pauses in the middle of the room, watching Harry with mild amusement. “Let me guess. Waiting to have this back?” He wiggles his wand in the air and lets out a laugh at Harry’s constipated face. “I was wondering when you would
Draco heard Potter stop scrawling in his reports, felt his hot gaze; he took a pinch of Floo Powder from an ornate little shelf screwed to the mantle and threw it into the flames along with the letter, whispering the destination.
Harry’s brows knit in concern. “What’s wrong?” He looks back, wondering if Draco saw something suspicious, maybe a familiar face in the crowd, and cold dread starts crawling up his neck.
It could still happen—his position has some obvious perks, including, but not limited to, first dibs on the hottest, most difficult cases, and Harry has always had a hard time refusing a good challenge. It’s definitely worth all those meetings and Claire’s authoritarian style of running the office because that’s when he has the chance to get into the fray, to actually help people and feel the adrenaline rush he always gets when fighting the good fight.
. To that vault. Go, Harry, maybe that spot is still waiting for you, go and beg them to let you in, go, please,” his voice was slowly raising, laced with panic and a desperate plea, his long, pale fingers digging into Harry’s forearm. “Don’t make me—”
“Still a tyrant, I see,” Harry says, settling comfortably in the chair. It immediately strikes him how nice Draco’s office always smells, like old wood with a barely-there, clean, chemical note and also like Draco himself, the lemony-spicy-sage smell permeating the air, as subtle as its owner.
Seconds later, they’re there. Harry’s whole world narrows down to the four loud cracks he counts, to the long, pointy shadows moving quickly across the dunes. They’re about fifty feet away and the quaggy, wet sand slows them down, enough for Harry to gather his wits. The mobsters slowly emerge from the darkness and he knows they’ll see them as soon as Harry gets a clear shot. As if on cue, the goons emerge into the moonlit clearing and both Harry and Malfoy cast in tandem, a jet of red light shooting from Harry’s wand, and a sheaf of angry, purple sparks firing from Malfoy’s. Harry doesn’t know the spell but one of the mobsters gets hit square in the chest and immediately collapses onto the ground.
He looks at the bottle of liquor and suddenly wants to down it all in one go, duty, consequences, and mobsters be damned. There are over three weeks left and both Harry and Draco are teetering on the brink of sanity, which can only end in them imploding or, more probably, doing something irrevocably, abysmally reckless.
“Ones that cure lycanthropy?” Draco lets out a long exhale. “No, unfortunately not. We’re not even close to finding a proper cure,” he says gravely.
“Hello?” Harry calls. Weirdly, he’s expecting his voice to echo around all this space but it sounds rather muffled, drowning in all the foliage and the stuffy, damp air.
, and promptly left Harry outside the door with a creeping feeling of impending doom.
That seems to soothe his nerves a little as Malfoy stops in front of him, entirely too close, and his soft, sweet smell assaults Harry. He breathes in despite himself.
They barely moved, not even lifting their feet, just swayed in place holding each other with more force that either was willing to admit. The sounds from outside were tuned out completely, and none of them dared to speak. His eyes squeezed shut, Harry desperately tried to freeze the moment in his head in naive hope he could somehow stop all the clocks and stay suspended in this sweet vacuity where everything was
There are his own feelings to consider as well, and they seem so scrambled and all over the place it only results in his head hurting and his heart racing. Harry feels there’s something to do, something to say and there’s a cowardly part of him that wants to run for the hills any time his heart skips a beat or he can’t breathe with the weight of the questions he’s too afraid to ask.
“We both know memories can be tampered with, Potter. And!” He raises a hand as soon as Harry’s mouth opens. “Ah, ah, don’t even start on Veritaserum, I’ve only just admitted to myself that you do possess some semblance of intelligence, after all.”
“Draco,” Harry says coldly. “Let’s go.”
The rush of scalding-hot water lashing at his back drowns out all sound as Harry stands in the shower with one hand on the tile wall. Head bowed down, he tries to gather his thoughts so he doesn’t jump out of his skin with how fast his mind is rushing. The steam condenses on the glass stall door, turning it milky-white, so thick he can hardly breathe. The whole experience feels more like a sensory deprivation trip than a shower. Harry’s skin is flushed a deep pink and it almost stings from the pressure, his whole body string-taut and restless.
“I’d invite him to lunch because he must be hungry and feeling sick,” Harry responds automatically, his Auror instincts kicking in. Judging by the indignant huff that escapes Draco, Harry already knows what he’s going to say.
“The old and the young, clashing in an unrelenting whirlwind of passion—”
Harry pauses and shakes his head in confusion. “I can’t—”
“Close your eyes,” Draco said hoarsely, not looking at him.
“Leave the boots,” he said, and paused as soon as Harry looked up at him with a raised eyebrow. “Unless—” Draco shook his head. “Perish the thought,” he said and smiled, cradling Harry’s jaw in his palm. “I want you bare.”
. How did they know so much? How did they get so far as to manipulate the trial date? How did they roam free and unpunished for so long, right under the Ministry’s nose? Harry sometimes wondered, how no-one was ever discovered, even though all senior Aurors’ work correspondence is monitored, even though their wands are randomly checked? The answer is so terrifyingly simple, Harry feels bile rise in his throat; it wasn’t a senior Auror. It was
“What?” Harry asks, tearing his gaze from Draco’s over-the-top clothes—honestly, who wears a waistcoat to a casual get-together?
“Long version or short version?” Harry asks, raising a brow.
, and he wasn’t a
“Malfoy, this is a gross overstepping and they would have been punished—”
“Why did he kidnap you?”
“What I know is that she can take care of herself. I’ve seen it.”
—doing this in the shower,” he offers.
—the reason lies in Harry himself, in every sharp intake of breath that wants to swallow him whole, in the way Draco tries to hide his face so Harry doesn’t see the tears drying at the corners of his eyes. Once again, it’s Draco who lays down the rules, with Harry helplessly obeying, worshipping every moan that rips out of Draco without him calculating whether it’s okay to let it out in the first place.
He thinks about the time Draco found some old tomes that turned out to be dark spellbooks; they probably belonged to Sirius’ ancestors and the horrifying curses they found inside were dangerous enough for them to decide to return the books to the Ministry. Harry took them in on the next day and got the dressing-down of the century from Robards for just throwing the tomes in his satchel, and then a second one from Draco for the exact same thing (they already touched them at home, it’s not like they were cursed). There was also a time Draco found a book on Black ancestry, hidden in a secret compartment in one the many bookshelves of Twelve Grimmauld Place. They studied it until wee hours of the morning, both eager to learn—Draco being his mother’s son and Harry being Sirius’ godson and the master of his house. The one tome they didn’t discuss too much—or look each other in the eye for two hours after spelling it open—was a small book in a golden cover, depicting a plethora of sexual positions and practices that should make any respected pure-blood clutch their pearls in justified indignation. With the tips of his ears burning red, Draco croakily explained that such guides were a common occurrence back in the day, especially in the high society, and they left it at that.
Draco snorted. “God forbid, seeing I’ve already been…
“Then touch me,” Harry chuckles, and moves Draco’s hands lower, just like that first day.
Draco takes a grave gulp of his wine, trying really hard not to burst out laughing. He can’t say anything yet, he wouldn’t take away the opportunity from Harry, to see their friends’ faces. There’s also a small part of him that’s terrified Harry’s not going to show up because he has changed his mind about everything in the last hour, but Draco likes to be a rational man in most situations. Even though discovering that his years-long infatuation with the Prat who Lived is very much mutual could not, by any standards, be considered ‘most situations’. He absently wonders if all the sex they had in the last sixteen-or-so hours has anything to do with his absent-mindedness. The mindblowing, toe-curling, heartstopping sex with the man he’s so in love with, it might honestly kill him one day. In moments like this, Draco curses his light complexion because he’s quite certain his face is now the colour of the Hogwarts Express. He fiddles with the top button of his shirt and feels a sting of pain from what Draco knows is a large purplish love bite, courtesy of Harry. The ones above the collar are all Glamoured—Draco wouldn’t dream of getting rid of them for reasons he can’t quite put a name to, he just knows his stomach flutters at the very memory of Harry’s lips latched onto his neck. And many other places, too.
!” Harry grabs both his wrists and backs him up against the nearest wall.
means, or why a complete stranger would like him to sit on their face, but he tries not to think about it too much.
Draco pressed Harry’s leg flush against his body and held it there, slotting them even closer, and fucked him even harder, his stomach contracting on every grunt. Harry didn’t even register his own whimpers anymore, just let his mind float as his eyes rolled back in ecstasy.
“All right. Just— Wait. Everyone, wait,” he says, watching the group with a strange intensity and zoning in on Draco and Harry. “Just, please— Tell me: did you lot know about this?” He wiggles a finger between the two of them, looking at his fiancee almost pleadingly.
Potter is not just powerful. Potter is
“Are you willing to take a question?”
Draco regards him curiously. “You’re always so... in control. You give orders, you can assess the situation without a hitch and yet…”
“All right, so what did you do when you met him?”
He tries to break away, at least for a second, to make sure Draco
,” he adds with a fake smile.
He comes back into the room with dread as his companion, filling the room like a black cloud, and Draco jumps up from his seat, already seeing something’s very wrong.
“You have a bed for the night,” Harry grits out and points to the ensuite, and then to the TV. “There’s a bathroom with a shower, and there’s an old telly. Knock yourself out.” With that, he Summons the remote and throws it at Malfoy who swiftly catches it—not without a smirk—and Harry’s heart skips a single beat at the simple, ages-old thrill that goes up his spine. As much Harry hates to admit it, Malfoy’s still got it—the Seeker reflexes, the spoiled, entitled attitude and the uncanny, undeniable ability to drive Harry insane.
” Draco nods frantically, thrusting up, not really focusing on the game they’re playing anymore. All his nerves are laser-wired to the frequency of
Something dark stirs in his gut, too, knowing Draco smelled it and didn’t like it for some reason.
“The usual,” Draco says in a bored tone. “Lies, drivel, and wanking over
“I’m going to cast a few spells,” he whispers into Harry’s ear, sending sparks down his back. “Protection, cleansing, lubrication,” he says, “is that all right?”
A bored, young receptionist eyes them both with unabashed interest and Harry’s painfully reminded that while he’s wearing his Transfigured uniform and a pair of dark trousers, Malfoy’s apparel consists of all things that scream
“Your question brings me to three: apparently, Muggles do not feel that threatened by—and I am quoting—
“Fuck you,” Harry snarls, feeling anger bubble dangerously in his gut. “And you?
Later that day, Potter comes over for round two. They fight about it a little, Draco says a few nasty things he doesn't really mean, and the errors of his ways are shown to him so clearly, he won't be able to properly sit for at least a day.
Hary shakes his head. “
“It’s not my first time on the run,” Harry shrugs. “Too many Cleaning Charms will do that—the fabric can only take so much, it gets stiffer when hit with too many Scourgifies.”
“Cause cave-ins when they expire,” Draco shrugged.
Harry’s sure she’s not talking about the arthritis. “Old Age Pensioneer sex? Brilliant,” he says, voice dripping with sarcasm.
Harry goes cold. Not a single ‘maintenance worker’, receptionist, or Auror can be spotted in the vicinity which means everyone has gone somewhere, or no-one’s in the building at all. A looming sense of dread starts to creep in, the feeling that something is very, very wrong, just like eight weeks ago, when he and Ron came to their floor and found it empty. And now Harry’s here again.
“Yeah,” Draco said and bucked at the slight change of angle, slamming his hand over his mouth to muffle a loud moan. Harry grabbed him by the wrist and bent his arm behind his back, gentle but firm, making sure he wouldn’t dislocate Draco’s shoulder.
He watches the little purple crane flutter over his head, doing a few circles and then it’s gone, flying to the other side of their floor where the Forensics Department resides. Harry can almost hear Draco’s exasperated scoff among the stifling vapours of his potions—he likes to pretend to be extraordinarily busy every time Harry comes over and makes a big fuss out of ridding himself of all his protective gear while Harry smiles at his theatrics. Draco thinks he looks like a mysterious genius emerging from a cloud of fumes in all his mad glory, looking like he has just devised a plan to take over the world. But he actually looks like a goofy mad scientist with tousled hair, goggle imprints around his eyes and a flush across his cheeks, and no amount of tight-fitting, black robes, no matter how good and intimidating they look, will wipe the smirk off Harry’s face at the sight of it.
“Put your wand on the table, take a step back, and turn around with your hands behind your back.”
Hermione covers her face with a hand to stifle a soft giggle. “Well,” she smiles mischievously, “it’s just because all of us do it on the regular,” she shrugs. “Except for Harry,” she adds quickly. The group erupts in laughter and Harry flips them two fingers.
When the three of them move on to the hard part, Harry realises he’s gripping the terrace railing so hard, his confused magic is heating and cooling it over and over again. It’s a good reflection of his own mental state when Kingsley tells him the trial has been scheduled to take place in two months and the Wizengamot won’t budge.
“Awful,” he looks at her dramatically, and Harry nearly snorts. “My kidnapper had no manners and a dreadful haircut.”
Harry had almost forgotten the overwhelming feeling of being full, of being so intimately close to another person it set his body on fire. There was a steady pressure of mounting arousal building up deep under his belly as Draco set off an agonising rhythm, carefully pushing in and out as he stretched Harry to fully accommodate him.
Content with the attentions he gave to Harry’s neck, Draco looked up and paused. Harry looked positively debauched, with tousled, dark curls, half-hard against Draco’s hip, and Draco kissed up, and up, until he realised that Harry’s eyes were focused on one object in the room.
“Malfoy,” Harry warns.
Harry ignores that last bit, blocking out any images before they have a chance to form. “You are being arrested for participating in activities of an organised crime group,” he says in a monotone voice, “You don’t have to say anything from now on but if you do, you’d better be telling the fucking truth,” he finishes, going off-script. He’s still completely in the dark as to Malfoy’s intentions—they have never been particularly trusting towards one another and Harry doesn’t see that changing anytime soon just because Malfoy had a sudden, suspicious change of heart. He pulls out his wand, not taking his eyes off the blond.
“How did you manage to mess it up?”
“Fuck, you’re so hot,” Harry said quietly and Draco smiled at his fumbling. “Always have been. I don’t have my wand on me,” he added when Draco raised his brow at the very Muggle condom and a packet of lube Harry was holding.
“Of course you can,” Ginny says and climbs on her tiptoes to kiss his cheek. “Make sure he drinks water! A normal person shouldn’t just run on coffee like a maniac.”
. The part that drove Harry to pull him out of Fiendfyre, to stand up for him before the whole Wizengamot ten years ago, and to have this disconcerting conversation on a roof of a Muggle motel in the middle of the night.
Potter has stayed over nine times at Draco’s place, usually achieving it through wrapping himself around Draco’s slim frame
“Relax, Potter, I know you wouldn’t voluntarily say something like that.” He shoots Harry a weak smile but quickly looks away and something ugly pushes inside Harry’s chest. “I can only imagine what mind games those two have stooped to in order to get you so agitated.”
The sky burned like a thousand suns as it fell down on them.
“Make me, then.”
“What?”
,” the Unspeakable whispers into his ear as Draco’s fingers instinctively dig into the firm flesh.
already,” he says, releasing a shaky laugh.
. “People do love their symbols, don’t they? Without his token Golden Boy, Shacklebolt’s office will quickly lose all the trust put in them. After all, who lets a national hero die under their very nose? And then, the hand that has stricken their beloved saint will take the reins,” he says.
in several countries—”
“Are you very sore?” He murmurs against Harry’s hair, fingering him leisurely and slow. Not to go another round, neither of them would be capable of such a feat at the moment, it’s just strangely comforting and intimate, to have that empty, uncomfortable feeling squashed for just a while, to ease the transition. Harry mewls softly as Draco fingers his own come back inside him and it shouldn’t be so hot, or make him feel claimed but in that moment, it makes his breath hitch.
Later that day, the gang ends up at Harry’s house for a spontaneous get-together. Harry has long given up on figuring out why its always his house, of all places, that has ended up being the ultimate social pilgrimage destination, but he never complains. It’s always a pleasant surprise to come home to Ginny and Luna making dinner in his kitchen as Kreacher looms in the shadows with an expression of a particularly ugly gargoyle, or meeting Ron and Hermione right on the stoop and going inside together to hang out and talk about their respective days. Sometimes, Draco pops in uninvited too, forever overdressed in his slim waistcoats, button-down shirts and fitting trousers. It always baffles Harry how Draco can just step in through the Floo, unceremoniously plop down on the couch and demand tea looking like that. He looks like a tabloid photograph, a celebrity after a particularly heavy red carpet party, all classy, proper and completely debauched. It drives Harry mad wondering if Draco sleeps in dress robes, or takes showers in a suit.
There’s a young Healer, behind Draco; a tall, dark-skinned woman whose long ponytail bounces ominously as she walks up to Harry. “Mr Potter, so glad you’re here,” she says, gracing him with a tired smile, clearly relieved she can leave the room. “Maybe you can explain the repercussions of massive internal bleeding to Mr Malfoy,
“I—” Draco stares at him, wide-eyed, and Harry kisses him with a laugh.
Ron and Hermione watch Harry scramble for words in silent indignance until Hermione takes pity on him.
Harry looks at him incredulously. “You support this?!”
“Well, the Healers say it’s just until your potions start to work, you had massive internal bleeding,” Harry says. “Again,” he adds, pursing his lips.
Harry’s brows raise slightly and Ginny’s smirk widens.
in their plummy voices, going as far as to claim they were not in the country at all during the events. Some even took a disgusting advantage of Hermione’s House-Elf Free Will Act and had the terrified creatures dragged to the stand to confirm everything their masters said.
Harry doesn’t say anything as a tiny shrike Patronus flies in, confirming two Aurors are on their way to escort their… Harry wants to say ‘guest’ but he supposes Malfoy is a detainee now, in every sense of the word. He checks the handcuffs and finds them securely locked around Malfoy’s slender wrists—if they were any slimmer, the cuffs would have fallen off. He’s never been made for prison, Harry thinks—with his fragile bones and angelic hair, and smelling like almonds—Malfoy would have ended up a canary stuffed into the darkest, grimiest box imaginable.
“How— How about Felix Felicis?” Harry asks, surprised he even thought of that.
. He smells incredible, even amongst the thick steam and clouds of fumes coming out of the cauldrons lined up on the workbench. Draco wonders if today is a day they go to his place right after work and do it against a wall. His cock gives a faint twitch at the prospect.
“Well, what?” Harry asks defensively, already aware what’s on his mind.
“Potter, my wand,” he says, his voice laced with steel.
Draco, to Harry’s surprise, is a picture of calm resolve as he downs one drink after another while instructing Harry in adjusting his clothes to a whole new level of tightness. He looks like sex on legs, posh and depraved, in black jeans and a black t-shirt that hugs his biceps so nicely Harry has half a mind to Transfigure it into something less revealing, mildly horrified he’s turning into Molly Weasley. Thankfully, they’re both so heavily warded in high-level concealment spellwork, it will be impossible for any Muggles to even remember them after they leave, and very hard to recognise them if, against all odds, some of Draco’s old friends decide to visit a dingy bar in the middle of the English countryside.
“I knew it,” Harry growls, finally letting his anger bloom, spreading like hot, black smoke over his chest. “You don’t give a fuck about your wife, about—”
“You’re in a chirpy mood.” Malfoy raises a questioning eyebrow and puts down what he’s doing. “I’m not sure if you remember, but you have my wand so I have to make do with
Relax. Deep breaths. Slowly, Harry starts to move.
,” he says, looking at Harry with an intensity that makes his heart stutter. “People disappear and are never found. Gold gets passed around and suddenly, you’re arrested for a dead body you’ve never seen in your life. Are you following?”
He lifts himself up and goes for the door; time for damage control.
Draco sniffs. “Ah yes, lately I do sort of feel like a can of red spray paint, you shake me up a little and off I go!”
, it was driving me insane, I—”
“Ron?” Harry shrugs with a smile. “Well yeah, sure, I think it would suit him.”
Draco jerks at the first touch of something warm and firm and immediately realises it’s
“Auror Potter, how absolutely crass for a public servant.” Mafloy shakes his head, crossing his arms in defiance. “And here I thought that an unexpected, ghastly bout of stomach cramps, or something of the sort, had driven you to storm out so abruptly from our previous conversation, but apparently, it has turned you quite randy, if I can say so myself—”
“Yes, that’s it, Potter,” he pants. “Can you feel it? Are you angry? Surely, I must’ve got under your skin.” He bares his teeth in a vicious smile. “No one will know, Auror Potter. You want this, you
Harry smirks. “And yet, scarlet is a good colour on you.”
A soft
“You’re always horny,” he huffs, wondering what on earth was in those case reports that got Potter so hot. It’s a little difficult to focus and Draco sometimes wonders how far Potter’s obliviousness actually goes, how much of it is his raging libido and actually wanting Draco, and how much is just a sly trick to get Draco worked up and ruin his entire life.
, yes,” he babbles, feeling his cock harden at the very thought of Draco doing it again, of Draco
“She told me she’s an
Harry groans. “Wait. Wait, wait— A girl is coming over to babysit and she’ll find a grown man, who, might I add,
sent straight into the ground at his opponent’s feet, sending the man flying backwards with white-hot pellets of vitrified sand following in his wake. Harry distractedly thinks he should focus on his opponent but keeps stealing glances at Malfoy, making sure they both have the upper hand. And Draco Malfoy duelling is something to behold. He moves with the speed and agility of a seasoned rogue, barely having to move as he dodges his adversary’s attacks—not only with his wand, but also with his body. Harry wonders where he picked up those techniques, casting like it’s breathing, moving like it’s dancing. The red-haired woman curses as Malfoy dodges her lazy
“What?”
Malfoy doesn’t say anything, just clenches his jaw with a steadying breath. “Go on then,
Draco doesn’t say anything, just sits there with his shoulders hunched protectively, tense and wrecked.
He sort of wished Pansy
“He saved my life. He can’t die now,” Harry says quietly.
If any of the witches and wizards rushing chaotically around the building had ever bothered to learn about the non-magical world, they would have realised the dashing stranger is wearing the material equivalent of three months’ worth of their salary. But even those ignorant of Muggle fashion houses can’t help but cast a furtive glance at the man’s lissome form, and some look around in confusion as the heady smell of quality cologne reaches their nose seconds after he has passed. Most, however, just get out of his way on instinct, only half-aware of the raw, alluring power he seems to carry as naturally as he breathes.
They Apparate in a narrow alley, right across the street from one of the lesser-used Ministry entrances.
” Draco cried out, slamming into him with renewed force. “I’m going to come, it’s—”
“Precisely. So until we know what the potion…”—Draco pauses and scoffs—“
The worst part, however, was that Draco had wings
For a few moments, the only sounds in the bathroom were the muffled beats of the music in the pub, the crude slaps of thigh on thigh, and their shared gasps, a rhythmic stream of
“See that chair?” Harry points to an old, creaky thing at the end of the hall, next to a large potted plant that has probably needed some Healer’s help for some time. “It transfigures to quite a decent lounger once you figure out how to fit it under the Invisibility Cloak.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, not thinking about McLaggen at all. “Quite.”
Free to run their own operation after their deranged master’s fall from grace into a literal grave, those who were still wealthy enough after paying all the war reparations had formed a pure-blood wizarding alliance. Or, more accurately, an elite neo-Death Eater club that had quickly evolved into a carefully constructed, hierarchical crime family with its black, oily tentacles pulsing around the very guts of banks, and institutions, and even whole cities. Their goal: power. Money. Revenge.
“What the—” Harry mutters, feeling stunned.
The Vault people came about a year and a half after they had settled down. Draco wasn’t officially on the lease—it would have raised too many eyebrows, two bachelors owning a house together brought too much attention. If anyone asked, Draco was a friend and a housemate, living in the spare guest bedroom that they never actually set their foot in. Their bedroom was upstairs, a private, intimate space where all secrets were left by the door, where they could unabashedly be themselves, where no prying eyes stripped them of what they had. Initially, it didn’t matter Harry was the only official resident—Muggle law didn’t really apply to them, not when they had their wands and Privacy and Memory Charms at hand, if anything were to go awry, if they had to adjust the reality a little bit to stop it from bursting their safe bubble.
“Do you like him?”
For a second, Harry gets a glimpse of the old Draco when a slow, vicious smile stretches his lips. He’s watching Harry carefully, with a knowing glint in his eyes. “I made her realise that it takes two to tango, so to speak. And if there’s any name-ruining bound to happen, there’s plenty of space in the headlines to fit two names,” he says darkly.
Harry sighs, his mind racing, thinking what Draco could possibly want to ask him. It’s not really unexpected if Harry thinks about it, turning whatever’s between them into a
“Senior Auror Potter,” one of them grumbles and Harry hears Malfoy stifle a snort.
“Are you seriously asking me if I had sex with your sister? What’s wrong with you?” Harry can feel his face must have taken an impressive shade of crimson by now and he’s honestly annoyed—it’s Ron who should feel bad about that question! None of the others, however, share that sentiment, all four of them looking at him as if he were an interesting new species they’re seeing for the first time. A true missing link to society’s endless layers of people who apparently shag each other all the time. Harry sighs. It’s not like it was a real secret to begin with.
It’s done anyway, it’s not like Harry can find a Time-Turner and go back a few hours, preferably to get hit by a car so he wouldn’t have to come here and… Now he sees what Hermione meant with the
“—if he wakes up, I know.”
A ragged breath broke the silence and the pit of guilt in Harry’s stomach started to fill with something else entirely. He heard Draco exhale again and it was nearly a gasp, a repressed thing that tore out of him on instinct, and Harry watched the quivering wings as his pulse slowly sped up.
Malfoy is quiet for a while but finally, he says: “You look like shit.” Harry gets the impression he doesn’t really mean it. “Let’s go then,” Draco murmurs and his magic sucks them into the vortex of Apparition.
Finally, Harry’s mind keeps going back to all those… moments; all the things that kept happening between them. And while one or two slip-ups could have been called an accident and moved on from, those fleeting seconds when he felt there was something
Malfoy scowls at him. He presses his knee between Dmitri’s shoulder blades and adjusts the garrote. “Now—”
“But enough about that,” Draco announces, Summoning his assembled healing station onto the other bed. He turns to look at Harry, slowly shaking his head. “Oh, how the tables have turned, Auror Potter.”
Harry starts with the angry-red Stinger marks, casting simple Healing spells over each of them and watching as the inflammation slowly subsides. They turn just a faint pink and without thinking, Harry applies some Dittany to every discolouration. He hears a soft gasp and realises he could have just given him the ointment, that he didn’t have to put it on Malfoy’s wounds himself but it feels right for an inexplicable reason so Harry doesn’t overthink it. After those are taken care of, Harry gets to the bruises that fade quickly with the help of the Murtlap and Nogtail balms. Malfoy is eerily quiet throughout the whole process, keeping his hands palms-up on his knees.
That brings Draco to four. Four times, Potter suggested they could grab some dinner and four times Draco played it down as teasing and distracted the man with assets other than food (although not impartial to some form of eating). In his vehement crusade against any form of emotion deeper than where his cock can reach, Draco had once made Potter come three times in one night; the image of him completely incoherent with pleasure now forever etched into Draco’s mind. He wanted to believe Potter really meant it, but the amount of couple-y things they’d been doing was already mind-boggling enough without the addition of dinner dates and staring at Potter’s smile for extended amounts of time.
“No but seriously, you didn’t have a candidate?” Ginny asks.
Dean watches him with the intent and wobbly focus of a very determined drunk. He squints at Harry for an uncomfortable amount of time before he asks: “Not even a handjob? Blowjobs?”
“I’ll explain later,” Harry says off-handedly, not really concerned with getting Malfoy on board with the plan. He pulls the vial out of his pocket. “Touch it.”
He’s not sure where that protectiveness is coming from but Harry feels his blood
They never talk about their childhoods much, is the thing. It did happen a few times—two or three drunken nights on the couch or out on the terrace—things like this would spill out at some point, unprompted and never pushed, like a seeping wound that healed itself over time. Neither of them asked, the other just started talking and they would listen, silent and present, a human gauze to sop up all that’s spilling out, the good, the bad, and the dirty. They never mentioned it the next day and that was okay—they both understood it was something the other needed, some things had to be said and locked in a drawer, filed away in the past so that it could be moved on from.
-borough!” he finishes lamely, spreading his arms. Malfoy rolls his eyes. “The home of mud fields and… not much else, apparently. Let’s Side-Along a little closer to the town and go from there. Find a hotel, or—”
Draco snorts and spreads his arms. “How could I refuse?”
“Look at you,” Draco whispered, dipping down to kiss his calves, the insides of his knees, going lower to the soft flesh of his thighs. “It’s like you were made to be splayed across expensive things,” he murmured, brushing his hands all over the taut muscles, smiling against the hot skin as Harry gasped and arched under the attention. “And kissed,” he whispered, kissing over his sternum, “and licked,” he added, sucking a nipple between his teeth, “and worshipped.” They both gasped as Draco leaned over to kiss him and their cocks slid together, almost painfully hard at this point.
“And then, that pesky violence issue came back to light—I don’t know why, someone said something, perhaps—and I found myself in quite a pickle, as you do.”
— Well,” Draco pursed his lips. “I suppose. I had a few drinks, though.”
Draco means and he’s not sure if it’s the haze of arousal or the fact that the longer they do this, the more certain Harry is he’s been in love with Draco for longer than he’d anticipated, but Harry knows he wants it. Wants it to be Draco. And it’s not some bullshit about flowers or initiations—Harry wants him, wants his heart and his body, wants Draco to do all those things to him, and wants to wake up next to him and do it all over again.
“This time for good, I hope?”
, it’s a plea and a promise, all melted into the single touch of lips.
“He’s— What?” Harry chokes out. “Are you sure?”
Whatever Potter’s been doing while away, it has done wonders to his physique—he’s all broad shoulders and veiny forearms, trimmed waist, thick thighs, and that wretched pert arse of his. He looks every inch the superhero the wizarding world believes him to be, along with a beard and a mop of unruly hair that now somehow looks rakish rather than unkempt.
“You’re staring,” Draco murmurs with a small smile, crumpling up his napkin and flicking it into the nearest litter bin.
“It’s not bad, it’s exquisite.”
Harry feels the increasing sensation of guilt crawling deeper and deeper under his skin and when he finally realises what might be the reason for that, the shift inside him is so powerful, he clutches the elbow rest of his chair hard enough that his knuckles turn white.
“And then?” Harry asks, unable to hide the concern in his voice.
One by one, Harry unloops the buttons on his shirt, kissing down his chest as Draco pushes back, tangling long fingers in Harry’s hair. Harry’s lips are burning with the need to trace the Sectumsempra scars end to end, one by one, naively hoping he’d kiss away the pain he’d once caused; he knows better than that, though, and carefully kisses around them, too terrified to open that Pandora’s box, feeling tension radiate off Draco in waves as he urges him to stay quiet just with the twist of his fingers at Harry’s scalp. So Harry does; Draco arches like a whip in his arms when Harry sucks a nipple into his mouth, and Draco’s hand guides his head, a silent plea,
“I’ll make sure we’ll tell them, then,” Ginny says and kisses the tip of her ear.
we’re on the same page,” he huffs, rocking his hips.
“You’re not a child, so I’m not going to tell you to take a nap,” Malfoy says, sitting up, always ready to have some fun at Harry’s expense. “We just ate, so it can’t be hungry-moody— Although the food so far has been substandard at best,” he adds with a smirk, apparently unable to stop himself. Harry’s jaw clenches and a small part of him wants his suspicions to be true. “If I didn’t know any better, I’d just recommend a proper wank—how long has it been, Auror Potter?” He doesn’t wait for an answer, tapping his lower lip with a slender finger, and Harry doesn’t plan on giving him one. “Would you say that it helps? I, for one, find the act soothing, when all is said and done, don’t you think?” His white teeth flash in a teasing grin. “Of course, I usually have someone on hand, some pretty thing that’s willing to help me out—”
Draco hums. “Accurate. Potter—it’s feeding time, ladies, please,
"I did. I started topping."
“You’re insane if you think I care,” Harry quips and rolls them over until he’s on top of Draco. “Get used to it,” he murmurs, smiling softly.
They paused, and a shiver went down Draco’s spine when he felt Potter’s nose grazing the hairs at the back of his neck. The Concealment Spells were down again and Draco absently wondered where Potter’s signature suspiciousness had gone. As if the last ten years had somehow taken away the last ounce of self-preservation Potter possessed and he had suddenly decided it was a good idea to rut against his arch-enemy in the very bowels of the Ministry of Magic.
“We’ll take it,” Draco butts in, his voice smooth like the finest silk, and, judging by the receptionist’s discreet smile, Harry’s face must be as red as the jacket he’s wearing. He absently hopes the name of the room won’t be visible on the receipt, lest Kingsley or Robards decide to go through the case expenses.
“Your father would flip,” he said softly, smiling like the devil.
Draco uses all his well-mannered sensibilities to choke on his wine as discreetly as possible. Ron spills his beer, Dean and Seamus grin like madmen. The girls giggle, hiding their faces behind their hands.
“My friends knew, though. The closest ones. Pansy, Blaise, a few others.”
, you idiot, get moving!”
When they’re done, Harry goes outside and uses the burner to call Ron and Kingsley. It’s not a long conversation; it’s still dangerous for them to make too much contact or draw any unnecessary attention so Kingsley puts him on speaker so that Robards and Ron, who it seems is now naturally included in all things Harry-related, can also participate.
Draco asked, “Your point?” And spread himself more comfortably in the chaise lounge. “The only flipping my father can do right now is in the comfort of his own grave, so the decision was mine to make.”
“Ah, yes! Well,” he says and pauses, regarding Harry with unrestrained fascination. “Trust is a peculiar thing, isn’t it? I trust you’ll tell the truth, however uncomfortable it may be, yet…”
The man’s features remain predatorily calm as the woman immediately looks up without him even having to clear his throat. He speaks a few quiet words and watches the receptionist hurriedly stamp a visitor’s badge and hold it out to him. Seeing his arched brow, her smile wanes and the woman simply places it onto the mahogany desk, clearly having changed her mind. Gracing her with a polite nod, the man swipes it off and leaves without another word.
Hermione counts them out loud on her fingers. “Luna, Ron and I, Neville, and now Ginny, I suppose. That’s four I know of.”
“Well I’m not coughing up blood anymore so that’s an upside,” he says testily, and Harry squirms on the bench, guilt clutching heavy at his lungs. “Cunning fuckers, they left the face intact so nobody saw.”
The girl was a little surprised to find out Harry doesn’t own a Muggle mobile phone, as most wizards these days have already adapted the wonders of Muggle technology the Magical World was yet to offer. Harry didn’t like the idea of anyone being able to get his number, especially with his kind of notoriety, so he chose to keep relying on his trusty Floo and his friends’ Patronuses. Hermione liked to say it made him seem down-to-earth, Draco liked to say it made him a crazy hermit, and Ginny liked to say it made him an old, old man. Harry, though, liked to say it just made sense.
“You’re impossible!” Harry yells and realizes he’s laughing and he can’t stop, so he finds a piece of paper, crumples it in his fist and chucks it at Draco’s head. It hits him square in the forehead and Harry laughs even harder, seeing the utter shock on Draco’s face.
He casts some Freshening Spells he had learned from Molly to make his clothes feel a little less sweaty and grimy, and changes into an old AC/DC t-shirt he fishes out of the Mokeskin pouch, one of many he had found in Sirius’ room. After a second of deliberation, he gets another one for Malfoy to sleep in—it’s Blondie, and Harry snorts. While it would be interesting to see him try to relax in a dress shirt, Harry’s not a sadist, and maybe that little scrap of comfort will make all the difference in the amount of headache Malfoy would otherwise send Harry’s way. As he rummages around the Extendable Charm inside the pouch, Harry’s fingers brush against Malfoy’s wand. It can’t be his own—the cool, soft pull of magic is unmistakable and for a second, Harry wants to take it and cast—something, anything—to maybe feel like he did back then, to find something he has felt he’d lost for some time, somewhere after the Hogwarts Battle, to reclaim that feeling and stifle the ache he could never put his finger on.
“Hold him open for me, love,” Harry asks.
There’s no fanfare when he’s done, he can simply feel that it’s enough, some foreign magic thrumming anew through the warm body next to his, and Harry pauses at the realisation it must be Malfoy’s core, evidently pleased with its host brought back to health. Malfoy’s face is flushed, his fringe is sticking to his forehead, and he’s biting his lip that’s already red and worried under his teeth. All in all, Malfoy looks completely debauched and Harry’s thoughts go to places they should steer clear of for multiple reasons but mostly due to the fact Malfoy just had two of his ribs magically mended.
They’d just finished their shift and Draco turned around to see Potter without his Glamours again, looking at him with a smile that a regular person would have considered shy, almost boyish. Draco, however, knew the bastard was a hot, insufferable, sexy incubus and was going to be the death of him.
, Draco,” Harry says urgently, dread filling his lungs at the thought Draco might get hurt when they’re so close to the finish line he can almost taste it. There’s also the matter of the fierce, protective fire sizzling deep in his belly, a crippling panic as he imagines anything happening to Draco—it can’t happen, not now, not when they’re—
“Why, though?” He asks as if they never stopped arguing.
“Potter, don’t you think I would have already strangled you in your sleep if I wanted to betray you?” Malfoy hisses through clenched teeth. “How would that serve
Harry’s stomach sinks. “No. It can’t—” If it weren’t for the baby, he would probably take off his glasses so he doesn’t have to look at his friends. “Did you even tell her I’ll be here?!”
, Draco?!” he exclaims, stifling his magic as he hears a few glasses rattle in the cupboards. “Without a fucking word?”
Malfoy isn’t too happy with being manhandled and in all his hissy squirming, Harry accidentally elbows him in the side, making him groan in pain through clenched teeth.
Potter, who’s currently trying to get even closer, nosing lightly at the nape of Draco’s neck and smiling at the light shiver it elicits.
“Yeah,” Harry said, picking up the pace, and he pushed Draco forward and face-down on the counter, arse up, and fucked harder into him clenching his teeth from how hard was trying not to come. “Can you come like that?” he asked, finding the thought impossibly hot, the way Draco would keen and arch, and finally give in, admit he fucking likes this, and Harry, and the fact they were actually, unashamedly, and thoroughly enjoying this fuck.
“It’s cake! What’s not to like?” Ron shouts incredulously, always first to stand by any and all food. “And look, they gave me samples!” He points to a large pile of boxes on the kitchen counter.
It’s because Draco might want him just for
“Fuck,” Harry manages, dropping down onto the bed and pulling Draco on top of him.
“But yeah. And no chemistry either, like, none.”
It begs to be squeezed, and slapped, maybe even bitten, and Draco feels he’s the man for the job. And he would, if only it weren’t for the solid shell of numerous Glamours and Concealment Charms the Department insists on slapping over their employees’ faces on a daily basis.
“Calm down Weasley, no need to flex so hard,” Draco says with a smirk. “I was going to suggest a friend of my mother’s, he’s French and a
Draco swallows the words with another kiss and Harry half-expects him to ask if he’s sure or to say something nice and tender but Draco thinks better of it and shifts them so he’s on top of Harry. “Yeah. All right,” he says simply, privately. “Turn over for me. On your stomach.” He says the words so softly, Harry can’t help but stare in complete adoration, his heart leaping out of his chest.
Over the course of a mere two months, they fall into a strange sort of relationship where they amp up the tension at work, so high Draco can almost taste it at the back of his tongue, and then do hot and sinful things to one another afterwards. But it doesn’t always end in sex, and its occassional lack is far more concerning—going home together every other day veers dangerously close to being a couple and the only couple they are is a couple of horny, insatiable fools who will one day get caught or do something unbelievably, abysmally stupid.
The true secret, the one thing only Harry (and a lovely artist all the way in Spain) knows about, is his tattoos. He adjusts himself on the sofa, feeling the softest hum of magic along his core—the Concealing Charms he’s been wearing for the last few months feel more like a safety blanket than like a burden. At first, he needed a bit more focus to keep them up all day but it’s second nature now and Harry is glad to take advantage of his allegedly exceptional magical prowess.
Draco looks. There’s saliva and precome dripping down his chin, glistening all over his kiss-bitten lips, tears drying at the corners of his eyes, and he’s panting, watching Harry with black-blown pupils.
Harry lets go to come up for air, his jaw getting a little sore. There’s a string of saliva stretching out between his lower lip and the tip of Draco's cock and Draco watches as it breaks and his cock slaps wetly against his abdomen.
again, I’m going to throw up.”
“I… suppose,” Draco said in a tight voice, the muscles in his back tensing and rippling under porcelain skin. “Can you gather some onto your hands? From— From my back?”
“Perfect not good enough for you?”
Draco looks at Luna with a smile. “129 years old, what a ripe age, indeed.” He turns to Harry and nudges the top of his head. “And Ol’ Noseless? He was, like, what? Seventy? I’m sure you could handle a more… refined gentleman.” His voice sounds a little choked and on one hand, Harry grateful for his restraint not to laugh in his face, and on the other, wishes Draco would get it all out of his system already.
Draco shrugs, watching a small crowd of older kids strut by, carrying snacks and cups of cocoa. “You’re small and defenceless, you would be very easy to kidnap,” he says sagely. “And it’s no fun,” he adds.
Or maybe that’s just Harry’s perception of him, and they look like that at every newcomer.
Harry clenches his jaw. “Fine,” he says and re-positions himself opposite Malfoy, one leg hanging off the bed. “I’m not saying it won’t hurt, but it will probably hurt less,” he clarifies.
Harry lurches forward and, as soon as their lips meet, they disappear.
Draco huffed, not bothering to hide his smile. “Quite the contrary, actually,” he said, biting his lip. “May I present,
Harry stares down his cup, still frowning.
Harry stops him with a kiss. “You’re also good. You
“Bloody hell,” Harry curses. He pockets the vial and looks at Kingsley with determination, feeling Malfoy’s wand burning a hole in the side of his thigh.
“If it weren’t for him, we wouldn’t have known you’d be there,” Ron says quietly, and they both know what it means. They wouldn’t have come. No-one would have known what went down in an empty Atrium with no witnesses. And sure, Draco still would have shot Robards, but then, he would have died there in Harry’s arms and the Family’s goons would have taken care of Harry shortly after, just like they had planned.
“You would what?” The question leaves him empty and Harry feels it might be dangerous—it’s like burning the last bridge on his way to Draco, just sitting before him like that, breathing the same air and asking about things that feel final when they shouldn’t be.
“You will?” Draco asked with a hopeful note to his voice. “I—”
Harry laughs weakly, unable to bring himself to really mean it.
“Fuck,” Draco whispered, claiming Harry’s mouth with renewed vigour. “I— I never thought you’d—” He trailed off, running a hand through Harry’s hair.
“Oh come on,” Draco scoffs, “We both know we could… loosen up a bit,” he says, looking straight at Harry with a strange expression. Harry swallows.
and sees white tufts of fluffy hair styled around the bald top of his head and when the stranger smiles, Harry struggles to locate more than six teeth that are still attached to his gums.
“Well!” Ron pipes in, terribly displeased with his barmy theories going unacknowledged. “You’re not that touchy with Hermione! Or— or me!”
Draco stared at his lover, shamelessly spread open for him, and silently blessed their ancestors for their filthy ingenuity. Harry looked back at him with wide pupils and a soft smile, propped up on his elbows, and Draco’s eyes skitted across his body, undecided what to admire first. He looked positively sinful, laid out before Draco like that, hard and flushed, and absolutely breathtaking. All of him: his shoulders and biceps barely fitting into a seat designed for a smaller, female frame; his stomach, taut and toned, with the softest rolls at the bottom; his cock, glistening wet and flushed a pretty red.
“And you offered—”
“Yeah, y’know. More Aurors beating up detainees, using questionable spells, and also— uh.”
Hermione watches the exchange with amusement. Ginny pauses halfway through braiding Luna’s hair and both girls watch as Harry slowly zones in on Ron and his bean bag. Which sounds
“What?” Harry and Ron ask unison. This is bad. Ron should be allowed not to know these things. Harry, on the other hand…
“Neville and his flowers!” Luna says. “They positively flourish if you tell them how beautiful they are, it’s so lovely,” her lips turned up into a thoughtful moue. “So does Neville, come to think of it.”
Slowly, careful not to hurt him, Draco pulls out the plug and shivers at how warm it is in his palm. He drops it to the floor, making a mental note to pick it up once they’re done, and rubs his index and middle finger over Potter’s loose, wet hole.
It suddenly hit him—it was over. Everything was over.
Ron!”
They’re going faster and faster, the sound of flesh slapping against flesh obscenely arousing, and they kiss every few seconds to ground themselves in the moment, to make sure it’s all real. It’s so unbelievably intimate, giving himself over to Draco, and Harry realises it was never scary, it’s just wonderful, and
He lets out an outraged yelp while Ginny and Luna topple over laughing. “You did
Draco shrugged and, just as he was reaching out to take the fag, Potter’s cold fingers wrapped around his jaw and then, cool, soft lips encircled his own; Draco breathed the smoke in on instinct, straight out of Potters lungs. They stayed like that for a few more seconds, lips still touching, and Potter deepened it, inch by inch, until he carefully coaxed Draco’s mouth open, slid his tongue inside, and right then, Draco stopped thinking altogether.
Draco’s face smoothed out in realisation. “You want him to think we came here to fuck,” he said more than asked, quiet and dangerous in the way an empty field feels right before lightning strikes—a biting static gathering in the air, making the hair on Harry’s arms stand on end.
“Oh my god,” Draco groans, “
He waves his hand and a gentle, barely-there pulse of magic softly pushes Malfoy onto the bed. Harry’s unperturbed by his indignant huffs and puffs—he needs him functioning if they run into trouble, he needs to make sure Malfoy is taken care of. It’s not a game, what they’re doing, it’s a serious criminal case and Harry’s job, first and foremost, is to make sure that the witness arrives at the trial in one piece. It’s also the least he can do, knowing Malfoy would have been fine if it weren’t for Harry’s own poor judgement.
When he finally gets his windpipe working again, Draco takes another swig for good measure and examines the glass.
“Thanks for filling in for us, Harry,” Ron says, draping Hermione’s scarf around her neck.
“And that’s why you’re saying it’s dangerous.”
He shook his head quickly. “What did you just say?”
Teddy’s incoherent in his grip but he manages to lift himself up onto his arms; he turns around and watches Harry in his blissed-out confusion, in adoring wonder, and his face alone makes Draco slow it down a bit. He listens for those sweet tiny gasps, each impact pushing out one more, and another, and
