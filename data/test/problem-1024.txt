The music, mixed with the endless chatter from the party goers, made Draco's head pound. He sipped on his Firewhiskey again, "Let's go dance?" He said to Pansy.
"Right. This is what I think you might like." She said to him. She picked up a pair of black jeans and handed them to him. "Put these on first."
"Darling, of course it's going to be fun." She raised her cup in cheers. Clinking, or touching, his cups with Pansy he rolled his eyes and downed the rest of his drink.
He was currently dancing with a tall, dark and handsome Ravenclaw. He could feel Potter's eyes on him as he bit his lips and tilted his head back to lean on the guy's shoulder while he held onto Draco's hips tightly. He was a good dancer, Draco had to admit. The guy started to nip his neck lightly. Parting his lips slightly, Draco let out a small breath and opened his eyes. Potter was standing against a wall in front of Draco and the Ravenclaw, holding tightly onto his plastic cup filled with amber liquid. Draco kept his gaze on him as he tilted his head to the side, giving the guy more access to his neck. He smirked when he saw Potter clench his jaw. Draco giggled, biting his lips, and looked away from Potter's fiery gaze.
"Yes he did." Pansy cut him off. "Point is, hun, you're going to play his game. You're going to make him beg you for your cock, though I do believe the one begging is going to be you, you're going to make him want it so much he'll cry. Hell be pulling his cock three times a day when you give what he's playing for."
I'm back babes. It's been quite a bit sorry for the wait i got caught up in other things. I do apologize for my irresponsibility. As per usual if you find any mistakes or anything do leave a comment, it would be much appreciated.
"I like these." He said to Pansy, who was sorting through some shirts on the bed. She looked him up and down.
"Do you still have the lip gloss I gave you?" Pansy asked when they reached the door. She opened it and walked in.
"Thanks." Draco said, cursing how small his voice sounded. He cleared his throat and looked at what Potter was wearing. Tight, black skinny jeans, loose black t-shirt with a small flame on the left pectoral and dark trainers. Draco noticed the way his biceps bulged as he crossed his arms, the thought of him being picked up or pressed against a wall crossed his mind. He gulped, willing the thoughts to go away. "You don't look bad in black." He let out, his voice was breathy and unsteady as Potter got closer. Soon they were so close Draco could almost feel the heat coming from Potter's body seeping into his skin and smell his cologne. Potter took a step closer and leaned in. He was so close Draco could feel his breath on his cheek. He licked his lips slowly and blinked.
Draco looked at her. He had taken to tuning out Pansy's insistent babbling. He had better things to do than listen to her complain about her make-up. "No."
Draco stared at Blaise and Pansy snorted. "I wouldn't be surprised." She said while running a hand through her hair and looking back to where Potter stood, still staring at him. "But I don't think our saviour would rape anyone. Even if it is Draco. Also, Draco wouldn't mind being fucked into a wall by Potter."
"I think we should give you some accessories." She said smiling excitedly. She really was in her element; ever since she was younger, Pansy had always loved dressing people up in clothes and doing their make-up. Draco suspected she would probably find a job in the fashion industry when she graduated.
Pansy rolled her eyes, "No. I mean I have some clothes that could fit you, like jeans and t-shirts and shit." Draco thought for a bit. Pansy did have nice clothes. He considered it. It couldn't be that bad, could it? Draco looked at his reflection in the giggling mirror and back at Pansy, she was about his size...
"I wouldn't do that and you know it." And Draco did know it. "I want you to get a cock up your arse as much as you do." She smirked.
Harry watched Draco walk away, his fists clenching at his sides. He ground his teeth together until it hurt, all the while staring at Draco's swaying hips. He was a tease. He took a deep breath to calm himself and rubbed his hands on the fabric of his jeans. He closed his eyes, running a hand through his hair. He pictured Draco's glazed eyes and flushed face as he sucked on his thumb and the desperate sounds he had made in the dorm. When he opened his eyes, Harry saw the very same grey eyes looking back at him, a smirk painted on Draco's sinful red lips, as he winked and turned back around. Harry watched as Draco made his way to where Pansy was getting drinks talking to Hermione, of all people. Harry sighed and turned around, his mind set. If Draco wanted games, he would get games.
Draco snapped his head towards Potter. He was still staring at them. "Yes, Potter, I am." Draco said slowly, his mouth twitching. He suddenly felt really self conscious., Draco bit his lip and Potter hummed, still looking at him.
"I'll be there in a second." He said to Weasly and then he turned back to Draco and he whispered in his ear. "I don't want you touching yourself when I'm gone. Is that understood?"
Draco turned his head, Pansy was looking at him with a small smirk on her face. He huffed and looked back at the Gryffindor table. "I'm not staring." He said, his eyebrows pinching together. "I'm observing."
"It's not like I have a choice, is it?" Draco retorted, glaring at her. She raised her eyebrows at him, unimpressed. He turned back to his eggs, they were unpleasantly cold. He wrinkled his nose and pushed his plate away and started making another cup tea. "I'll come." He said reluctantly.
"Finally alone." Potter's voice murmured in his ear. Draco tilted his head to the side without thinking and pressed his hips against Potter's. He parted his lips to speak but instead he let out a soft sigh as Potter's arms wrapped tighter around his hips. Draco felt his head go all mushy and all he could smell, hear and touch was Potter. His heartbeat sped up and blood rushed to his face, coating it in a soft, rosy pink blush. He hummed, it was a nice feeling -Potter's arms around him and his breath on Draco's neck.
Draco grinded his hips slightly against Potter's, feeling the hard press of his cock against his arse. He heard Potter's breath hitch as he gasped slightly. The hands on his hips tightened even more when Draco pressed back again, with a soft and barely there touch. Draco then suddenly turned around and faced Potter, to find the green eyes darkened with obvious lust. Draco pressed his hips against Potter's, drawing in a breath and suppressing a moan, he bit his lip. He brought his hand up to Potter's hair, tangling his fingers in the soft strands. He stood on his toes and pulled Potter's face down so they would be almost level, though he still had to tilt his head back slightly. He took his right hand and placed it on Potter's sharp jaw and brought his face closer. Their lips were less than a centimetre apart, only just enough so they weren't touching. Draco looked at Potter through his eyelashes, red lips parted only just with Potter's warm breath ghosting over them. "Aren't I?" He murmured so low he was sure Potter only just heard it. Then he took a step back, dropped his arms and walked away from Potter, swaying his hips.
Rivulets of icy water rolled down his face, staining his cheeks red. Harry closed his eyes against the migraine that crept through the back of his skull. Perhaps, if he shut his eyes tight enough, the pain would ease with sheer force alone. The rusted tap gurgled with age as it spat out an erratic stream of water against steel, and he sighed as he watched his breath make patterns on the dingy bathroom mirror. His hands gripped tight over the basin.
Harry carefully placed the photo into his back pocket, and stared at the open envelope sitting on the bench, right next to the long string of twine that had been wrapped around the owl’s leg. He ran his fingers along the frayed length of it, grabbing the pair of broken Snitch wings still left in his pocket.
Draco splashed his face. Scalding rivulets poured down his neck and cascaded down his cheeks, leaving behind red smoking trails in their midst. The heat did nothing to soothe the tight knots in his muscles, but at least it made him feel something besides the numbness. An itching reminder that he was still alive.
But Malfoy was a stranger, a foreign anomaly. Harry didn't know how or why, or what it was that made him suddenly come to this.
And in the morning when Draco opened the notebook again, nothing at all had changed. His words were still there, same as when he had written it—neat, long strokes. Ink crisp and sharp. No magic, nothing at all.
Slowly, Harry unthreaded his belt from the buckle, the metal clinking as it fell open against his trousers. “Can I?” he whispered, and Malfoy’s body bent towards Harry’s palm like waves crashing to the shore.
, and slackened the grip of his thighs. Somehow, using a complicated maneuver that only the most elegant and flexible player could have pulled off, Draco untangled himself from Harry and swung himself over the handle so that he was now sitting right-side-up on the broom. Harry left to dangle upside-down. Their bodies mirrored each other, like a reflection in a lake. Two sides of the same coin.
Harry didn’t quite know what to take from that. He shook his head and sighed into the heavy, stale air. His breath fluttered out in front of him. “You do know that this is all your fault, right?” he said. “No matter what your intentions were.”
“When we’re old and barmy and start losing our memory,” Draco began, a smile on his lips. “We can unthread the key from the yarn and let every memory we’ve ever written in this notebook flood out. We may not remember each moment or every second, but we’ll never forget all the feelings we shared together. That’s what the key is for, Harry.”
surrounding it. He stood up, looking down at them with a strained, pitying smile. “Your appointment is at half nine on Friday, boys. It’s only a small team, real professional, your knackers will be covered. That’s final.”
And when Harry turned on the wireless in a desperate feat to stop the words from ringing in his mind, he heard none other than Glenda bloody Chittock and her sultry drawl. He sent an angry
Harry took a step forward, but there was no more space left between them, so Malfoy could do nothing but step back. Harry met his every step with one of his own, and so they moved together, one foot after another: a dance.
Draco couldn’t stand that answer, it repulsed and repeated in his head over and over until he wished he had never seen Potter’s reflection in the first place.
“Our feelings are like memories,” she had said. “As time passes they become more hazy—blurred around the edges. Until one day we wake up and realise that we have forgotten what it means to be alive. Instead, we become familiar with living in the numbness, because our childish joy and wonder has withered with the weather, aged with the lines and wrinkles carved on our face. You see, Draco, it is not wise to treat your life as something as fleeting as a memory. A Pensieve can paint a beautiful picture, after all, but that is meaningless if we have lost the true feelings of being alive.”
He sighed. “Come off it, Potter. Stop wallowing here alone in self-pity. Where’s that going to get you? The
, because he hated him, hated how fit he looked right now. And that thought sobered him enough to make him feel sick to his stomach.
Yet this spring was much different from the ones he once remembered, because he felt a strange loss like yellowed, whittled leaves in September. Like grains of sand slipping through the palm of his hands, pale skin, blonde hair, and silver eyes made of flint never did come again.
“What a surprise, Golden Boy, it’s Heads.” He took another step forward, thumbing the Galleon between his fingers.
Harry leaned across the table, a dark chuckle slipping out of his mouth as he continued speaking. “And what of it, Deverill?” he all but whispered. “What if me and Malfoy
The leaves lay around them on the grass like a bed, and Harry brushed a hand against Draco’s chest. Draco fell backwards, wrapped in the covers of flower petals that fluttered in the breeze. His hair splayed around him in a halo of gold. With the sharp lines of his face and the contour of his nose, he looked as though he was carved out of stone.
Draco drummed his fingers to a silent rhythm; it rang over the piercing white noise rushing in his ears. “I think I’ve gone completely off the deep end, you know. Lost cause, and all.”
Craving the taste of blood red wine on the tip of forbidden lips. The sound of Malfoy’s voice whispering in his ear, the tease of it all. Their bodies close, but not close enough.
This was clarity: painted like the sun that lit Draco’s hair golden, drowning out every shadow of doubt that had darkened Harry’s face before. This photograph: a fleeting moment captured between them, a memory that could last longer than an eternity.
Harry guided him backwards. Back and back and back. Until he felt a splattering of cold water run down his face, curl around the ends of his hair, and stick Malfoy’s Quidditch robes tight against his skin. He stared at Malfoy underneath the rain of the waterfall. He stared and he stared as Malfoy’s hair grew a darker shade of gold; it swirled up the platinum strands like an inkstain. Harry ran his fingers through the wet lengths, and he stared and he stared as Malfoy’s lips parted, his head tipped back under the weight of Harry’s hand.
In these heady moments, he couldn’t help but remember just how much he loved to forget. That delicious delirium would surely become the death of him.
“Draco,” he called, when he was close enough. Draco whirled around, his eyes focusing on Harry again. “Heads or Tails?”
“No, it’s not you,” he repeated because he refused to let himself fall victim to the pretty little illusions his mind gave him.
But Potter only stepped closer, sitting on the edge of the grass. The river twinkled in front of them, a reflection of a thousand glowing stars. Their sides were aligned, thigh against thigh as he undid the laces on his shoes, submerging his feet into the cavernous blue.
He zeroed in, his eyes flicking around the length of the pitch and through the crowds, circling the air like a rabid animal on the prowl until he caught sight of what he was here for.
“Look who's talking,” he all but growled, a low stretch of notes that curdled his tongue, a poisonous whisper that licked the small space between them.
came crashing over him as if years had not passed since they last saw each other. As if all those years ago when their bodies had intertwined, their fingerprints painting each other’s skin gold, hadn’t at all been a phantom.
Draco’s gaze darted across Harry’s face before coming to rest on his eyes again. “You just look more vulnerable.”
back into the good books. Pretending your star players aren’t fags by publicly parading us with a pair of tits.”
Grey eyes traced the world around them as if he’d never seen anything as interesting as open air. Harry watched Draco drink it all up with a desperate desire to see those grey eyes land on him with that same intensity, and as if his pleas were answered, Draco’s eyes finally met him.
With one final, heavy look, Harry went to push past Malfoy to the bathroom door, but a warm hand against his chest made him halt.
didn’t mean anything... I lied. I wanted to kiss you, but I just didn’t want to admit it to myself.”
Harry had always been an intense flood of movement, flying on intuition alone. Feeling his way through the air, his heart pounding as he fell through the sky—a plummet, a descent. He felt drunk off flying, a shock of intoxication through his veins like he was high in a blurry mindstate of bliss and oblivion.
Draco clasped their fingers together, feeling the familiar dips and calluses of Harry’s hand wrapped perfectly in Draco’s.
He wrapped his fingers around the Snitch's wing at the same time he felt a vicious jolt erupt through his body. His core tightened, his stomach lurched, and his broom was knocked clean from right between his legs.
Fingerprints painted Potter’s reflection like a Pollock. Splattered wet lines that trailed from the ridge of his eyebrows to the frame of his glasses, the point of his lips, and to the sharpness of his collarbone. Even now, the touch of another human was an illusion, broken by the very markings of his own fingerprints.
business for actual smoke to come from her ears. Though maybe if Harry kept up the silent staring contest for a bit longer he would see it in action.
Potter, we’ve been through this. Live your life, whatever, but could you choose ones who don’t look like Draco Malfoy knock-offs? People have been talking, and it’s causing a stir at the
There was a long pause, and it took Harry a while to realise he was so busy staring at Malfoy that he hadn’t responded. His cheeks flamed. “I—I think I’ll manage,” he choked out."
Harry felt every sharp pulse of his heart. Saw each lungful of air that escaped his body with every ragged breath. The smell of ozone and sweat, the electric aftermath of a thunderous storm. And blood. The metallic taste of blood on his lips as his teeth sunk into them.
“What’s the worst that could happen?” he had said to Hermione barely a few weeks ago, like the stupid, ignorant shit he was.
A steady drizzle bathed the sky outside in a greying hue as streaks of pale sunlight peeked through the thick layers of cloud, curving in a faint rainbow of colour that danced along the hard wood floor of Harry’s bedroom.
Draco nodded his head as if he understood any of that. As if the white noise rushing in his ears wasn’t screaming over the same sounds and the same faces in the street.
shagging? What would happen to your precious sensibilities then? Would you sack me? You couldn’t replace me even if you tried.”
But Draco stayed still, for fear that if he reached out, even just a little, he would meet emptiness. The cold condensation across a mirror where his fingerprints painted a mirage out of nothing but stale air. And this time, if he trailed his fingers from the ridge of Potter’s eyebrows to the frame of his glasses, he would wash away in an instant.
“I'm here on a case, actually. I needed to clear my mind a bit so—” he shrugged his shoulders, “—here I am.”
Draco touched his arm, dipped a finger along the smooth edge of a petal. The ink smudged slightly beneath the heat of his thumb, and a pink droplet cascaded down in a single, blushing tendril. Everywhere the ink painted his skin, the numbness melted away and ebbed into a flowing river of nerve endings that brought him back to life. Beating heart. Pumping blood. Breathing air into his lungs.
And then, Malfoy's final words, repulsive in its seductiveness, managed to carve themselves a home in the recesses of his mind. A repetitive driving force that fueled the devil on his shoulder. A slow drawl, the words dripped from his lips like an enticing poison. Like liquid gold.
was only looking for a good headline for the front page, and if a shocking headline was what Skeeter wanted, then Harry was going to give her a run for her fucking money come Saturday.
The door chimed as he opened it, and he was bathed in swathes of warmth. A pool of magic so deep it buckled his knees, took his breath, and filled the chasm that had grown in the pit of his chest. The familiarity of it all, the scent, the way it shook his very core.
He drank up the crowd, swayed on his feet, and his body thrummed with an adrenaline rush he hadn’t had before. He could barely remember his own name.
Perhaps, if they just had one more moment of darkness, one more second of the night, Draco would have finally known what it felt like to kiss Potter.
He had under two months before his eighteenth birthday. And maybe, in the deepest chasm of his mind, he was terrified of that fact. Terrified of seeing his time run out like the slow trickle of blood on a bathroom floor. A broken hourglass, where all he had left to do was watch on in helplessness as the countdown ticked down to zero.
And this time, it wasn’t a tease, a slip of skin between the lines of an iridescent shirt. No, it was an expanse of smoothness, a splattering of beauty spots that painted his skin like a night sky. It was the smallest whisper of gold hair trailing down his navel. Harry swallowed because it was all too much. Too much skin; too much Malfoy. It made him lightheaded, the desperation that curdled his body, urging the muscles in his limbs to
Malfoy leans into my breath, licks the sheen of foam off wet lips. “So what’s it going to be, Potter?” he whispers.
“You’re such a cheat! I refuse to count this!” Draco stepped forward, closing the distance between them, and Harry felt that familiar thrill course through his veins. He was so giddy with it, the adrenaline rush that made his heart thump erratically in his chest.
He felt a wave of heat brush his cheeks as Malfoy breathed a laugh, and in that moment, Harry decided that he’d much rather have frozen nipples than to feel the warmth of Malfoy’s breath flutter against his skin.
And hours later they were still standing there, frozen, as time moved forward for all the other strangers with blurry faces along the cobblestone streets of Paris. A downpour washed over them, and Draco’s heart beat to the pitter-patter of that moment as the black sky became painted with streaks of gold.
And with his every deliberate movement, Malfoy spun a tale, too. A dangerous web of lies that entangled Harry into its grip.
Harry wrapped the twine around the ends of the two wings, tying a knot. They dangled from it, fluttering and curling into each other. Harry circled the string around his neck and knotted it at his nape.
“I think the word you’re looking for is unbelievably charming. Or sexy. Sexy works too.” Harry wiggled his eyebrows as Draco rolled his eyes. One of Harry’s hands snaked its way around Draco’s hips.
“Draco.” He clasped their hands together. “And I think, perhaps, we’ve been waiting for this moment for a terribly long time.”
for Christ’s sake, and since day one he had been a slippery, slimy, slithery snake. But it was too late to back down now, so Harry crossed his arms and raised his eyebrow as if his stomach wasn’t churning and his palms weren’t sweating.
When Draco was little, his mother gave him a small, leather notebook on his birthday, bound with yarn and threaded with a gold key.
So down the cobblestone path he went. Through the crumbling cinder archway, and past a bent picket fence. A rickety old bridge over a river of stone, a left, a right, and a slow train ride until he stood at the precipice of Carnation Grove.
Then, in his silent moment of weakness, the door opened. And the screaming that rang through his ears fractured into a million crystalline pieces, like a shower of piercing glass raining over him. With it, came the final tether he had left. The same one that had held him back from lashing out at all those reporters, the one that stopped him from storming out without a backwards glance.
as if his world was no longer stuck on repeat. As if the memory of being intertwined with Draco was as vital as breathing.
stands. Like déjà vu, Harry outstretched his arm as far as his muscles could pull, and Draco did the same alongside him.
Hand on hand. One winning palm closed around the Snitch. The crowd roared. Blood flooded through Harry’s ears.
“No,” Draco muttered, shaking his head. “At the beginning I thought it would be better, because what could they possibly say to the bloody
Harry knew he should have put a stop to the bet immediately after he woke up the next morning to find his and Malfoy’s face plastered all over Wizarding Britain. This time, it wasn’t just the
From the corner of his eye, he saw Draco nod his head. He swallowed, his throat bobbing up and down, and when Draco spoke again, it was stilted, as if he were forcing the words out. “Last year. Just before Quidditch tryouts. I was at a Muggle bar, and I met someone. But turns out, he wasn't a Muggle at all. The next day my name was all over the front page. ‘Down and Out Death Eater! Draco Malfoy’s Dirty Man-Eating Secret!’”
From his periphery, Harry watched the Snitch move further away, zipping underneath another cloud. When he spoke again, Harry’s voice was rushed. “Are you going to ask me why I think it’ll be the
His head fell into the crook of Harry’s neck, and Harry felt a wash of hot breath against his skin as Malfoy gasped, Harry’s hand cupped around the front of his trousers.
Still, Draco didn’t stop writing in his notebook, and sometimes, he’d spend the night writing instead of sleeping, because reminiscing fond memories of his childhood was much better than succumbing to the reality of his nightmares.
The entire stadium instantly faded behind him. All that was left was Harry and Draco. Nothing else mattered; today, at this moment, the game was the last thing on Harry’s mind. This budding thing between them was worth so much more than winning or losing.
Midnight called, and the moon hung in the sky like a hook on the wall. A slip of silver light cracked the sky in two, and Draco sat on a pillow of grass, his bare feet skimming ripples along the river. The only sound he could hear was the slow crescendo of waves crashing upon waves, and Draco took in the stretch of hills and the strip of houses from the road where he came.
Then, Harry began to close the remaining distance, one long second at a time. It was so slow, so questioning. Giving Malfoy the opportunity to move away. He could push him, turn his head. But Malfoy stayed completely still as the seconds ticked by, as the water gushed against their skin, every drop like a countdown. A steady pulse. A rhythm like the pounding of Harry’s chest.
So Draco, against every nerve in his body screaming at him not to, stepped away from the current and onto dry land. Maybe there was something on his face that called for desperation, and aching knees, and water in a drought—because immediately Harry’s hand wrapped around his wrist. And that same
Malfoy stepped out of his space, and it felt like, for just a second, Harry’s entire world collapsed into itself. He inhaled a haggard breath, and the air around him felt electric with the heavy presence of Malfoy, with the smell of him, a dark cologne of musky wood and the sweet notes of citrus cocktails. If only he could find a way to lick the air, Harry would be able to taste him against his lips.
As if all the fundamentals were there, but the distinct air unique to Potter was missing. Draco could never recreate his fire, the passion that thrummed through his veins. The goodness inside of him that made Draco’s heart pump overdrive. But it was all he had left, so Draco ignored all the wrongness about the Potter in front of him.
Well. Harry could have easily done that, but he didn’t. And the next time he saw Malfoy, he was more than four drinks deep into absolute bliss and oblivion.
He eyes a stranger from across the bar; he slowly drinks them up, but his body is still curved into mine and I can’t help my laugh. I grasp his chin into my hands, direct his face back towards me where he belongs. Malfoy smirks as if he’s won something, I let him believe that for a little while longer.
He didn’t mind getting to know this new Harry, because the one he had taken solace in all those years ago, when he was broken, and lonely, and dying inside—was still there, somewhere. Time hadn’t withered Harry like the browning leaves scattered across cobblestone streets.
That’s when he saw them, pools of gunmetal grey. Dark and overwhelming, and so full of restraint. But Harry refused to back down, and so he leaned further in, close enough to trace the cracks on his lips.
Spring was in the air. It tasted like rebirth and the fresh breath of mint; the colours were a vibrant palette of paint as they brushed over the earth in a soft pitter-patter of rain. Harry loved this season. He spent his days in a lazy haze and his nights submerged in the unfrozen pool of the waves.
He blinked, and the world tumbled into view through the slit of his eyes. Malfoy’s hair, soggy with dirt, sweat, and rainfall, itched his chin, and the dead weight of his body constricted his chest, stuttered his breathing. Harry clenched his fingers, and even that movement sent a searing spike of pain through his ligaments. He groaned, and drove his knee right into Malfoy’s side, shoving him off his body.
Hermione was seething, the smoke-coming-out-of-the-ears kind. Only figuratively of course—she was much too level-headed and wrapped up in the
Their brooms were nose to nose, now, and he could see each one of Draco’s exhales leave his lips, kissing the air between them.
“It will do you well to succeed early, Draco,” he had said. “You’ll get nowhere in life if you follow behind the feet of the inferior. Do you understand?”
I take the bud of the cigarette out of his mouth, breathe one last drag before vanishing it with a wordless spell. Time still burns, ashes curl through the air, but there’s nothing left between us except impulse and truth. They’re one and the same, both dangerous while overdosed with heavy desire.
It slowly began to charr, a black burning ring that unfurled from the middle of the paper, right where the lines of ink were scrawled, and spread out into the very corners of the parchment. As the paper blackened, hints of blonde hair and a backdrop of blue began to gradually develop like an old Muggle film reel.
Perhaps it was too early to want this, too sudden of a realisation, but it coursed through Harry’s veins as if it had always been there, lying dormant, in wait for this singular spark of clarity.
He laughed a low sound of amusement as he stood up and brushed himself off, barely looking like he caught a bruise. Fucker. “Your little stunt broke the Snitch, no one's won.”
“You alright, Potter?” he whispered, and there was something in his eyes which told Harry that this wasn’t one of Malfoy’s taunts. At this moment, they were so far removed from the game of cat and mouse they’d been playing for years. It was different, so different. It was new ground they’d never explored before, and the weight of it was stifling and exciting all at the same time.
Which was a load of absolute bollocks and a waste of fucking time, yet he nevertheless managed to control his shit-eating grin into one that was less shit-eating and more:
He stared up at Harry, held a hand to his face and brought their foreheads together. The river lapped at their backs, But Harry’s touch was a burning, glistening warmth against the icy fall of the waves.
Potter sat at the end of his bed, surveying the empty room whilst Draco couldn’t stop staring him down. The last time he saw Potter in physical form was sixth year amid broken noses and blood-filled gashes that ran up and down his chest. Sat here on his bed, Potter looked normal, and nothing like what a man who had been on the run for months was supposed to look like. That was the first sign that the Potter sitting at the end of his bed was another cruel figment of his imagination.
“Fuck off,” he said, but his eyes traced every movement of Harry’s hands as they ran up his body and around the back of Draco’s neck, pulling him down off the headboard.
“Draco—” he tried, watching helplessly as Draco lifted the covers off his lap and stood up, still refusing to look at Harry. In one quick-draw movement, Draco grabbed his pants from the floor and pulled them up his legs. Harry swallowed, staring at the slight shifts of his back muscles as he moved, the light peeking between the curtains dipped and curved along his spine.
Draco looked up at Potter, a question written in the steel colour of his eyes. His skin was hard and rough—he had the marks of a worker’s hand. Draco fought against the intense desire to enclose his fingers around them.
Harry dipped the tip of his quill into the ink, and watched it drip and fall into the stream. As each droplet kissed the river, it bloomed and bled like swirls of watercolour. Harry brought the quill to Draco’s skin and ran a thumb along the curve of a purple vein. Draco jumped at the cold touch, and goosebumps lit his skin aflame.
The touch, the smell, the taste. And Draco’s body would thrum with a desperate need that wouldn’t ebb until the early morning sunlight. Sometimes, he’d spend the night staring in the mirror and imagined a glimpse; a shadow of dark hair and a lopsided grin. But when his fingers touched cold condensation, it would wash away with the fog.
“You like my eyes?” Potter whispered. It was so low that Draco felt the timbre of his voice wash over him like the pitter-patter of rain across a warm summer sky.
Harry clenched his fist, nails biting the soft skin of his palm. He was a tether away from walking out of this shoddy place indefinitely.
There was a narrow strip of houses, cluttered in a tight row. The buildings were stacked haphazardly skyward, and the facades loomed down low. Wooden sign-boards, weathered and chipped by age, hung on by a thread and creaked when he walked just as night met the day.
Malfoy hummed, a low vibration that stuttered the electric air between them. “You’re drunk, Potter.”
Harry pointed the front of his broom upwards, climbing even higher above the game. He shivered as a bite of cold air nipped at his ears and the tip of his nose. He worked his gaze through every inch of the stadium, coursing over the sea of navy and grey supporters who held banners high above their heads. A drumming chant pulsed through the air, and Harry felt their low notes vibrate through the wood of his broom.
A few minutes ago, Harry had lowered himself to his stomach on the rug despite Draco gallantly offering the reading chair and instead of playing the gentleman he’d been forced to lick his lips and keep his thoughts to himself when Harry’s arms flexed under his weight as he settled.
And in the brief moments that they do make eye contact—like when Harry says something to Pansy and Draco responds, fleetingly winning his attention—there’s something multifaceted in his eyes. He’ll laugh at something the others said, then look at Draco and let the smile linger a moment before it falters. Like he’s remembered to be nervous or serious. Draco might have known him well enough once to decipher it, but he’s lost the confidence to make such analyses.
Harry purses his lips. Draco looks disturbed and drops his head back to Harry’s shoulder. “We’re going shopping. Whatever they sent you, give it back.”
,” Harry snarls. “The case is classified and even in the department our relationship is exclusively hearsay, but the way he
He stands, sidestepping the astonished girl, and throws a friendly wave at Madame Rosmerta as he leaves out the front door. He’s tipsy, maybe more than, and doesn’t even notice Ginny’s followed him out until he feels a friendly hand on his bicep to slow him down.
He does love it inside, just as Harry expected. He’s read every book on the display table, all the local literary legends, but lingers there for a while anyway, just to point certain books out to Harry and page through copies.
When Ron falls into the office chair, it’s with a bitter sigh that Harry wishes he didn’t recognise. It’s one of exhaustion—with the job and with the people—and the fact that he’s most definitely had the same reaction sends his thoughts spiralling towards Ron’s most recent suggestion of resignation in the garden.
“Hello, Potter? Can you hear me or have you already tuned me out to think your big brain Auror thoughts?”
“Indeed,” Harry replies, and he hesitates only enough for Draco to notice when Pansy links her arm through his.
“Where’d Harry run off to so quickly?” Ron asks when they’ve made it through half the guests. “This isn’t my job.”
“Oh, Harry, don’t ask after things you won’t understand,” Draco sighs. “You have no idea what it’s like for everyone to superficially think they know you just because they recognise a cursed scar.”
“Damn.” His hands come up to cradle his face the moment the owl hoots and soars off, either because he hasn’t signed the note or because he shouldn’t have sent it.
They’d gotten an expensive bottle of wine for the table and all raise a glass as Ron gives a long, winding, Dumbledore-esque toast to his wife’s incredible work ethic and the lack of toddlers currently sitting at their table, which Harry and Hermione laugh along to.
A blood-curdling shriek rings out through the silence of the ballroom, interrupting Harry and snapping every head towards the source of the sound. In the far back corner of the room, a single chair is knocked down, its occupant standing back with pure terror in her eyes.
“So I’ll see you tomorrow?” he asks, voice raised over the rain and feeling almost depressed by the regularity of the words. India feels so far already.
“I’ll make sure it’s handled as soon as possible, then. And let the shopkeeper know to close for the day.
Draco rolls his eyes, but it’s not accompanied by a scowl, so it only fills Harry with careful interest. His eyes are bright, meeting Draco’s.
Harry focuses all his energy on a neutral expression, sure that the slipup in communication wouldn’t have happened if everyone hadn’t spent so much of his life teasing about Malfoy. “Yeah, that’s it exactly. He’s a massive pain. But enough about me,” he says, sitting up straighter and gesturing with an open hand across the table. “What’s new with you two?”
Once in a blue moon, when Pansy is this close and this gentle, he misses it. It’s easy to forget that they’d once been an item—he loves her, but she’s often so loud and boisterous that he feels nothing but relief to have that in the past. They’re incredibly comfortable together, but a craving for the familiar isn’t a good enough reason to return to something they know they hadn’t been right for. Better as friends had been the motto for almost thirteen years.
There, in that fair-haired boy, now man, still outgrowing a sneer, is someone who’s getting to know mid-twenties Harry without a predilection for Hogwarts Harry. He’s lucky to have the love of his friends, some of the most all-encompassing love he’s ever been subjected to, but something is thrilling too about this new friendship. In Draco—this Draco—is a confidante who doesn’t give him the benefit of pre-ordained love and idolatry. He must prove himself worthy of friendship. Worthy of disclosing personal matters, like Hogwarts or a friendship with Luna.
He watches the eyes soften first at the outer corners, then the edges of his mouth tip up to match the soft amusement, all to say
It’s an hour to midnight when Harry decides to call it a night. He swallows the last of his drink and stows the bottle before sliding his curse questions list into the file and vanishing it home ahead of him.
Though she spends half her workweek as a solicitor on Muggle cases, she still logs hours in the wizarding world as a barrister, especially with cases of human and animal rights. When it came down to her career path, she simply said she ‘couldn’t choose’ and would do it all. He’s always secretly wondered if she still has a time turner.
“They had runespoor eggs! And a diagnostic book on wide-ranging curse-breaking spells! What was I supposed to do?”
Draco follows Harry and Hermione to the table, more relaxed in the other man’s company once again, and as the meal begins he finds himself growing increasingly comfortable… dare he say happy. His place has been chosen carefully; Harry to his left, alongside Teddy and Dromeda, Hermione to his right with Ron and Rose, and Bill and Fleur across from him.
“I… have a method that’s worked before to get over a straight friend,” he begins cautiously. “Which I mention because it worked
“You don’t need the money,” he continues. “And you’d still have those events you get begged to attend for stimulation. You could even attend more with the free time.”
“I dunno, it’s twenty degrees, at least lose the hat.” He joins him by the mirror, arms crossed. “Better to cast a warming charm than sweat your arse off. I
“Use the little arrows to move around the screen, and the little green button here to start the time, I already set it for five minutes, okay?” He mumbles it under his breath, watching Draco hold the phone as delicately as a raw egg, comically outside his comfort zone. “Just say ‘Go’ and ‘Stop’ for us,” he adds, louder now, as he ducks back in.
There was a feeling of guilt that laid over their interactions, on Draco’s end at least. It was like a mist that he had to squint through to engage in friendly banter, and it stayed until a week into their new routine. Harry had withdrawn from the reading chair in gallant surrender just to lay on his stomach on the rug and complain that Draco hasn’t gotten a second chair yet. From his newly-won perch in the plush seat, he reminds Harry yet again that there’s a chair at his desk, but he insists that even the floor is more comfortable than that arse-killing antique monstrosity. Draco laughs, genuine and untroubled. Harry sticks out his tongue. Draco throws his quill and hits him expertly, dotting his face with ink and sending them both into a fit of laughter.
“I could snog her right now, I swear,” Harry whispered in his ear. “Interrupting your mum makes her look rather dazzling, don’t you think?”
Harry had asked him once if that offended him. He just shrugged and said he was happy to have positive confirmation before publishing so much research.
Both men survey the crowd; a mix of Ministry employees, old friends, professors, and old enemies, seeming to have the same thought.
Ron’s face was drawn in sympathy, suggesting that he did know what he meant, and he shared a look with Hermione; a slight tilt of his head towards Harry, a slight widening of his eyes. She seemed to read this as clearly as a verbal exchange.
He feels Draco’s eyes on him. “I regretted hiding you the second the bedroom door shut, Harry. Let’s just move on.” He says it stiffly. He’s nervous.
His eyes widen and Harry grins as he switches the oven on for a late lunch. He’s caught him in a game of chess. One where he knows his opponent too well to lose; forfeit his strangely gallant need for an equilibrium of favours or take a trip to Jab. He’d bet money on his choice.
He also keeps his mouth shut when Harry assumes he’s hungry too and insists on the Leaky Cauldron. He keeps it shut when he begins to blather on about the office and Murray and the dread of meetings. He doesn’t trust himself to open it when Harry earnestly says he works better from his study. No, he stays successfully quiet through it all, smiling nicely despite already beginning to regret his employment of the Blaise Method. Still, when they finally say goodbye, Draco manages enough personality to call out “Merry Christmas, Harry!” to his disappearing back.
He sees the flicker of surprise in the face of an Auror who hasn’t been ordered around by Harry Potter in years. He nods, says, “Certainly,” and disappears back through the crowd.
Harry regards him with an unreadable expression. “You’ve actually been invited for dinner,” he says. “On Wednesday—“
is in love with my best friend, so I just don’t see it lasting,” Hermione sighs dramatically. Harry and Draco look at each other with a quiet panic that she doesn’t catch, at this casually announced, previously-unspoken thought. She drops Draco’s arm and beckons for Ron.
The next two aren’t his either, and he plugs away at his editing, resigning himself by the fourth to the idea that it was fruitless. When Pansy introduces the next and final question, he doesn’t look up. He only snaps his head towards the radio when he hears his opening line.
Draco turns his murderous gaze to Harry in astonishment, but he’s quickly busied himself by charming the package carefully into the air and surrounding it with a shield charm. He doesn’t breathe again until it’s safely in the evidence box with a strict note of warning and personally walked to evidence. He’d left Draco in his office and returns to find him flipping through documents with a glass in hand that proves he’s found the alcohol drawer.
Draco’s beginning to regret the added fodder handling this Ministry business would offer. Between his friends and, apparently, all of wizarding England’s free press, it seemed more trouble than it was worth.
“Oh, he’s not bad. His reputation precedes him, really. You can tell he cares for his clients. Besides, he’s usually in very different courtrooms than me, so we hardly cross paths.” She shakes her head. “More charm in him than he knows what to do with, though.”
was a different Harry. One who needed to be ordered to take a break and eat, who spoke louder than usual with a gleam in his eyes, gestured animatedly and tapped Draco’s shoulder constantly to tear him from his work on the cursed objects and make him confirm or deny his analyses.
“No girls since then, sure. But I’ve seen a few handsome blokes leaving your flat early in the morning.”
jealous of Jack,” he says. He twists on Draco’s next lunge, stopping him from cementing a hold around his waist, and they pull back to run it routinely.
Orsix returns later as he’s washing his breakfast plate by hand—a therapeutic practice he’d reclaimed from his Dursley years—setting the note on the kitchen counter. This time he’s keen to read it, barely wiping his hands dry on his jeans before sliding his fingers across the folded edge of parchment to break the seal.
He actually loves it. He feels more comfortable in his invisibility than even the back of Boggarts or Potter’s cloak could offer. He understands why Potter comes here to fully unwind in comfort.
“Let me check,” says Draco, joining Harry by the dining table and placing his own hand above a pair of old white trainers. Nothing. “Nothing.”
“Impressive because you’ve managed not to be killed by your own décor? I do that every day. My toaster’s not even once attempted murder.”
Harry is, indeed, trying not to let tears fall. Every muscle in his body tenses in restraint. “No, I’m not, mate, I… okay, I am. I’m just imagining; if Murray saw that, he’d go mad.”
Then again, under the flood of hot water, “Ten years ago, I began my journey to defeat the very personification of evil…”
“Merlin’s fucking bollocks, here to gloat?” he jabs instantly. Wounding Harry must still come as natural as breathing.
wants to see, and how is Harry supposed to deny him anything when he’s gifted him this entire day, even if he’s dead on his feet, so he smiles and takes hold of Draco’s bicep without another word.
many times must I tell you they’re regulation length?” Harry groans. “They give proper movement. Don’t you care about my athletic needs? You—“
It felt like identity. Like something comfortably familiar, when so much had changed. It was harder while discovering his path after the war to admit that there was so much he didn’t know about himself. And if he hadn’t known his parents well enough to know his own culture, it seemed irrational to give up everything he knew from his first eleven years, too.
Harry jerks awake, the scream still echoing in his ears. He lays silently, slowing his breathing and sitting in silence, attempting to decipher if he’d cried out loud. His heart beats as if he did.
Draco reached out a hand without looking up from his notes and gently lowered the finger Blaise had pointed in his face. “Tea?”
“That’s a lot of books,” he says after a minute, nodding to one of the bedside tables. Draco follows his eyes.
to go, he knows. But he’s already sure he will. ‘Change isn’t easy, but it is commendable’. Hermione said that, sitting across from him after a difficultly-delivered apology at dinner.
On his arm, two gnarled circles that never fully disappeared, despite Hermione’s best efforts. An enduring reminder of Nagini. Draco’s hand willingly follows his guidance, and his eyes dart from Harry’s arm back to his face when he speaks.
The first thing he registers, with relief, is the cooling charm that settles over him as he crosses the threshold. Then he sees the windows, the balcony, and tall curtains. The cool blue walls, the framed photos of Indian architecture, and the two single beds.
His mother reaches an arm out, taking his wrist fondly. Lightly. “Perhaps he’s changed, and he’s assumed you changed, too. Haven’t you?”
Ron’s eyes crease in amusement. It’s not a smile, but it’s an improvement. It sends something resembling relief flooding through Harry’s chest. It’s a start.
“I dated women after that, Muggles, but it never worked out and eventually I just thought—I realised that I thought I liked women because I
Luckily—or unluckily—he is all too familiar with the effects of a Cruciatus curse. It would be easier to say he’d gotten skilled at overcoming the curse during the war—it was no secret that Voldemort was heavy-handed, follower or not. Instead, he drew from childhood memories, his father standing over him, wand out, voice even and emotionless as he coached him through the hopeless pain.
She turns to him just as the egg timer goes off. Saved by the bell. He escapes to the kitchen and busies himself with plating dinner as he hears Ginny moving to the table. At the last second, he waves his hand vaguely towards the radio, playing some light music to guarantee that they’re never sitting in silence.
His face is heating. Even in his own office, Draco has the upper hand, decently at ease with the door shut, in Harry’s private space. His gaze sits comfortably on Harry from his office chair and he knocks back his drink with a smirk.
Finally, the door to Quality Quidditch Supplies is within reach, and with it the welcomed familiar smell of polished wood and leather. Harry abandons him instantly, zeroing in on a display by the till, and so Draco wanders the aisles, picking up several things and putting them all back down. Harry finds him not long after eyeing the newest model in the store window and holds up a packed bag in celebration.
Hermione adds, “He’s clean-shaven now, that was surprising. And he must still be running distances because he was wearing the
There’s an anxious part of Harry deeper down that whispers a greater fear; that Draco has a problem with who he is, innately. He can admit to himself, in a moment already heavy with vulnerability, that he shouldn’t get too attached to Draco so long as he’s still piecing together whether he can be comfortable with a friend like Harry. He stares hazily down at the spot where Draco’s shoe had been a moment ago.
“I know, I’ve been buttoned up like an old hag all day,” Ron moans. “And he’s all haughty today, what with the award. It makes him so strict and authoritative.”
He hums thoughtfully, reaches to set the necklace on the coffee table, then slides a hand under Draco’s shirt with the confidence of this response, up to where it sits on his heart. It’s beating slow, calm. Draco doesn’t ask him anything, just squeezes his shoulder with his free hand, likely thinking Harry’s merely offering affection.
He was so angry that he’d walked out of the meeting, mumbling something about paperwork he’d forgot to bring in for discussion, and decided to covertly trace the floor and see if he could feel the same identifier he’d felt while tracing Draco.
A hand sits for just a moment on the top of his head and then disappears. He hears the footsteps fade and then return, feels a poultice on his arm, then the sound of tearing bandages and a shaky hand wrapping fabric around it.
The radio fades out and he’s confident that this briefly picturesque moment is dying with it, but Draco holds him close and he hears him suck in a breath when the beginning brassy notes of ‘The Way You Look Tonight’ chime in.
. She loves her career. She’s always liked Harry, he’d thought. She cared for him. Listened compassionately when Murray wouldn’t. Supported him in training. Praised him even when she beat him out for the promotion.
She rolls her eyes, and for a second he’s back to their little Diagon Alley flat, subjected to her lovable wrath. “You’re so right. I’ve changed my mind. I was
“Fine.” Harry glares. “You—you’re guarded. Because you grew up with... impassive parents that threw you to the dogs and left you with trust issues. You can be cruel. You turn on a sickle. You’ve
He’d thought about running. Hiding out at the chateau in France. He could say he won’t because it’ll look guilty, or because, if they’re going to try to pin him with bureaucracy, his best chance is responding bureaucratically.
He clears his throat nervously. “Good question, good question… I suppose, sometimes I stop by his flat to talk about the consultation. And stay for tea or the like.” It’s so unbelievably an understatement that he sends a prayer that a blush isn’t creeping up his face.
“Draco Malfoy, sir. Consulting on the case, remember? Best curse specialist in England,” he adds proudly.
“Maybe. I’ll think about it,” he promised, adding for Hermione’s sceptical expression, “Really, Hermione. Anyway, how’s the wedding planning?”
He’s always thought of Harry to be someone who shows his affection and appreciation through actions; he’s always cooking for him, and has brought him baked goods since the beginning. He sets training sessions and reads the books Draco gives him. Tonight, occasionally, he calls out ingredients before adding them to confirm that Draco likes them.
Oh, Merlin, he’s done it again. He feels his face heat when he focuses his gaze and meets Ron’s eyes. “Erm, what?
When a morning fighter, Hasan, who Harry only sees at group runs, approaches him and asks if he wants to go a few rounds, he declines regretfully. With the ire running through his veins and practically knocking the stitches out of the punching bag today, he knows he’d be an irresponsible fighter.
He’s all slender, graceful lines and seams falling perfectly along the contours of his form, cutting shapes of black and white and tan. And best of all, he embodies it as though the entire thing was a five-minute afterthought.
,” he replies, but that glare on his mum’s face is like walking veritaserum. He rubs one arm with the opposite hand behind his back, chest subconsciously puffing a bit more in her presence. “It might have slipped my mind,” he corrects.
' dramatically and Draco’s eyes roll even as he leans in, kisses soft and sweet. It’s almost regretfully nice because he’ll have to duck back out now and suffer alone until tomorrow.
“Draco, darling,” Blaise replies, grinning unaffected by the cold welcome. “Look who’s dressing pretty for Potter!”
“Harry, this is quite possibly the longest it’s ever been,” she chides even as she pulls him into a warmly-reciprocated hug.
Draco thrusts his head under the water once more, rubbing his face vigorously, and resolves to go with his proven success—engaging with the enemy. Running away, in more ways than one, has never proved especially helpful.
She studies his face, then reaches a hand across her chair and sets it on his arm. “But last time an era ended we found ourselves here. And how exciting has this been?” She smiles. “Who knows what’s next for us all, right?”
“Ladies and gentlemen, it’s a happy day, but a sad one,” she begins, the crowd hushing around her. “We’ll surely all feel the absence of Ron, if only because he’s taken over and handled the fantasy Quidditch league
“Yes, because right now the skull feels… pointy? Hungry?” he offers. Draco feels for the skull himself and chuckles, feeling the drop in the pit of his stomach that whispers
Draco drops into a crouch, suddenly so close to him that he startles. “You’re at Ron and Hermione’s, I just assumed…”
find out why.” His eyes are shooting daggers, then, in a blink, it’s replaced with a toothy grin and a wink. “Till then, Draco!”
His fingers play with the edge of the file unconsciously as he stares out the dark window, imagining what his fifth-year self would think seeing him sitting here today. He’d likely find it exciting that he’s an Auror, less exciting that Ron’s office is on the complete other end of the department, and blasphemous that Draco Malfoy’s name is typed under ‘
Harry pushes between shoppers, holds the book up high over a couple heads looking at something by the shopkeeper, and counts out the equivalent notes for the number of fingers the man gestures back to him. He passes Draco going the other way when he’s halfway back to the front of the long, thin stall, and sees he’s holding two books of his own.
Harry sits for a while, reading. Long enough to have read it twice, and then he flips it over and looks at the envelope again.
“I come every Friday,” he explains as they reach the gym. He informally gets Draco a visitor’s pass from the front reception, which technically consists of pointing to him, saying “Wants to watch me today,” and getting a thumbs up from Bindy behind the desk. “
Draco begins to write furiously, so he takes his opportunity to steal the chair back. They work in silence, in their own worlds, as Harry lets himself forget his earlier woes and read basked in the fuzzy aura of Draco’s happiness. It warms the room like sunlight through a window. The air feels like his laugh.
As fun as it is to watch him ramble, Draco saves him. “I get it. It’s entertaining that I don’t know muggle vernacular, you don’t like gay jokes, and I can pull.”
“I’m excited that you’re here,” he was saying, “Even if you’ve given up Jab for the day, because I diagnosed the necklace, and it’s more amazing than whatever you’re imagining. I know why the magic was traced so strong without being a curse, and it has you written all over it. Well, as in you, especially, are going to die for this research, I—so what—wow—Merlin, you look… why are you… wow.”
This wasn’t arrogance talking—everyone had said so. He could count how many guests had mentioned, in between congratulations, that they were a picture because he’d been counting how many times it made Harry blush.
She points a shaking finger to a vase of white lilies toppled over on the desk. “Oh,” she says hollowly. “My papers are wet.”
“Honestly, you and your infatuation,” Draco chuckles good-naturedly—he knows better than to stand between Pansy and what she wants. “And this is the only way to go about it? You’ve forgotten about owls and floos?”
He lays his head on Hermione’s shoulder. For the past hour, what’s brought him the most reassurance was keeping his hand flat on his chest, where he’d hung the necklace dug from his delivered bag under his shirt and could feel the beating of a heart against his own.
“Don’t you worry, lad,” Murray says, voice heavy with condescension. “We’re keen to keep your name out of the papers.”
When Draco turns back to him, he expects a challenge for framing a solo picture of him, but he says nothing. The docility takes Harry by surprise. Maybe he’s feeling like the friendship is too fragile to say such a thing. It’s a shame, really—Harry had an entire rebuttal prepared.
… That’s what throws him off—the surety in the gaze and words. All-knowing. Harry the omniscient god. It freaks him out a little, to watch him switch between the moods.
“I’m capable of leaning back, Mother. I’d thought Harry would like to sit next to friends he doesn’t see often enough. I’m sure you’ll get to know each other well despite my presence.”
Draco leaves through Harry’s fireplace a while later, still humming with excitement and carrying his new box of cursed objects, and Harry takes his second shower of the day. He doesn’t shy away from the tempting image of Draco grinning devilishly at Jab.
Ron makes a funny indignant sound when he gets to the part about how quickly Malfoy’s mood turned when he asked about the case, and looks properly annoyed by the time he hears all the rubbish that’d been said about Harry and his role in the Ministry.
Potter tilts his head back in a full-throated laugh that seems to be at Weasley’s expense. The redhead playfully cocks his fist and gives Potter’s shoulder a quick battering, receiving a wide grin and no anger. Instead, still grinning, Potter leans back in his chair, balancing on its back two legs, hands laced behind his head. He makes a joke and Granger snorts into her drink. Draco’s never seen him so at ease—somehow, it offends him not to be privy to that side of him.
They lay contently against each other in sleepy silence, Draco wondering how soon is too soon to go see the cabin. He closes his eyes, and pictures it in the summer; the hikes they can go on, the lazy afternoons and the weekend trips he can take on a whim when he needs a new window to look out. He’s surprised when his thoughts drift further, to maybe five years from now, and then even further, perhaps a winter holiday, with more than two stockings under the mantle.
He thinks Harry’s going to kiss him, but he stands and says, “I’m going to keep cross-referencing the evidence for a bit.” He’d really like to kiss him. Instead, he watches him disappear upstairs.
Harry frowns and puts a hand to his forehead. Ron and Hermione had said nothing, but he had just walked at least thirty minutes home in the cold. “I don’t think—“
Feeling fully plunged into confusion, he moves the history text back to the stack on the table and lays across the sofa, eyes fixed on the ceiling. It was funny, how he hardly heard Draco’s name in the last decade as they built their lives, and now he’s been so fully threaded into Harry’s that it’s completely unavoidable.
In the hallway stands Harry, two parchment shipping boxes stacked almost to his chin and a small paper bag balancing on top of that. His neck bends at an awkward angle to meet Draco’s gaze around it all.
“What are you doing out of bed?!” He smiles, twisting in his chair to see the sleepy Rose who’d stumbled up behind them. “And more importantly, are you ready to get back
“So I’m going to mention, completely neutrally with full acknowledgement that we can speak openly with each other, perhaps more than with anyone else, that you mentioned Draco Malfoy
The barman steals his attention away, yet as he orders, he can’t help but look back. Potter’s also wearing a Weasley shirt, he realises, watching the man take a sip from his pint and lick foam from his top lip. Draco hasn’t seen him in anything besides dress or work robes; in jeans and a Quidditch jersey, he exudes a more relaxed persona than he’s been privy to.
His excited eyes follow Draco’s face in astonishment as he sits back down and he shakes his head in disbelief, so clearly wanting to kiss him and resisting for Draco’s comfort.
“Doing okay?” he pants, meeting Draco’s fixed gaze for the first time since the round started. His eyes are full, mouth open slightly, glancing around Harry’s face without really seeing. Harry rubs the back of his neck, chest still heaving rapidly—he’s suddenly incredibly worried that he’d looked ridiculous in the ring. It must seem barbaric to a wizard. Especially one who uses his wand to even flip on the kettle.
well for the last five years.” A wave of laughter crosses the room, Ron’s face reddening. “But today we say
He stares unseeingly at Harry’s socks, and, abruptly, his heart is in his throat and his stomach drops to his tailbone, his hands clammy and breath shaky. And then, just as suddenly as it hit, his insides calm and he’s reborn into a single train of thought:
Harry tilts his head at Draco’s immobility, shifting black waves of hair over his right eye, and Draco’s heart skips a beat in shock that his hand twitches in a bizarre desire to reach up and brush it from his forehead. Instead, he gives his hands a task and gently reaches out to brush his fingers over Harry’s ears, lightly removing his glasses. He grabs his wand, whispering an ink-cleaning spell first on the lenses, then at Harry’s face, instantly removing all traces of the mess.
Harry’s face is wet, either with his blood or sweat or angry tears, and he collapses in exhaustion against the wall, chest heaving. The basement is silent once again, and when he leans his head back on the wood, he meets Draco’s unreadable eyes down the length of his nose. He presses his hand to his chest and feels two hearts thumping wildly.
“No, don’t stop on my account.” A lopsided smile. “Just try to refrain in front of Ron. He loves proving me wrong—Oh! Now, look at
Neville and Luna spy the pair just when they pop up into the teacher section, waving them towards an open bench near the top rows. Luna’s golden curls are flattened under a royal blue knit hat, and beside her, Neville has taken up Harry’s more unassuming approach to dress and looks, as he has for almost the last decade, rather handsome in a mutely-toned jumper. He glances past Luna with an easy, toothy smile.
She nods as if he’s said anything of value and hugs him tight at the door, only releasing him when he’s assured her that he’ll still be at Boggarts.
“Did you… need me for something?” Harry asks. He sets his bag on the floor beside him, leaning his left shoulder against the locker to face Jack.
She grants him a smile, looking down at him over her glasses. They both know it’s not over. Her pen hovers above a blank sheet of parchment.
Harry’s mouth tightens, but he says nothing, and after a careful moment his face transforms purposefully into a smile, the one from Diagon, the artificial one for strangers. “We’ve got to go, Ted. Do you want to go flying this weekend?”
He chuckles low, turns his head just a little to press his lips to Harry’s throat where he can reach. It sends a dizzying jolt of joy and something more impatient through him, the feeling of which conjures a sudden clarity. Like he’s sobering up from the giddy happiness of the late evening and early morning, Harry remembers what had brought him over in the first place. He takes a deep breath. “I’m sorry—about yesterday.”
Still, he feels a bit emasculated by the truth tugging at his memory, as he walks the empty midday hall towards the Charms classroom. In reality, he’d been decaying wandless in a holding cell. And if anyone had ‘defended his honour,’ regretfully, it was Potter.
“Make room!” Harry pulls his attention from his friends at the sound of Draco’s voice, rising helpfully when he sees the precariously balanced set of drinks in his arms. “Wine for Hermione… pints for Blaise, Pansy, Harry, me…” He places the drinks in front of them as he speaks. “And… a tequila sunrise for Ron?”
the magic, in a way that leaves him craving more challenges. He hasn’t used the potion for support in at least a week.
And Bill Weasley, who finally tracks him down in the living room, is a man Draco could get along quite well with. A reminder that partisan divides have deprived him of several interesting friendships in life up until now. He’s tall and handsome, with the expected Weasley-red hair and a gnarly scar to boot. There’s no point in not appreciating his appearance, considering Harry had already admitted to him being an early fascination—one he should have clocked sooner during his journey of self-discovery.
“Please, I would never charm myself to lose a bet this embarrassingly,” he scoffs, taking the third full beer on the table for himself. It’s a pale lager, still cold, and he drinks it gladly.
and he wouldn’t listen, he was not going to listen to kiss him. But Harry’s eyes were locked on his like he was the only thing in the room and he watched himself lean in from outside his body, and for the brief second that their lips met, it was all worth it.
He turns the faucet and wraps a towel around himself, feeling chilled. The bathroom window is cracked. Absently, he remembers that the nights are lengthening and he should be bracing himself for the cold, then thinks dreamily of the hot sun by the Great Lake and warm spring days with his mother in France. There is nothing like the quiet calm of summer.
Draco’s face had slowly dropped slack in surprise, then upwards into excitement as he spoke, and now he comes forward and takes Harry’s hands. “You thought of the
Draco crosses his arms, forehead wrinkling into deep scepticism. “Just tell me what you’re planning.”
They’re already finishing up when Hermione bursts in and engulfs him in a hug that sends him wincing, but he just tightens his arms around her. Ron is a step behind and embraces him much gentler, wrapping his arms around them both. They’ve been waiting at the hospital for half an hour, apparently, simultaneously hoping and not hoping that Harry would walk through the door.
“I’d love to have you,” Draco says. “I’m going out for another cauldron,” he points a thumb to the cursed book, “But stay. If you practice tracing, only take half a dose. Even a quarter if you feel like it.”
And, always one for a challenge, he’s lately turned his attention to an even more specific breed of cursed objects: those imbued with Unforgiveable curses. He’s yet to find a Killing curse piece, but several magical shops know to give him a call if they find something of interest. He’ll pay handsomely. Borgin and Burkes, in particular, has been very dependable.
He lets go and, before he can overthink it, pulls Ron in, clapping him on the back. “You’re a very patient, understanding mate.”
“It’s not a problem, I was happy to,” Lars replies, opening a locker near Harry’s and retrieving a duffle bag. He glances towards the two of them. “Draco, Draco, you are dressed differently this evening. Is there a chance we are getting you in the ring tonight, eh?”
There are two interruptions; Ron, first, swings through the door without knocking late in the morning.
“Rasmus Neo was a joke!” Hermione says. “And honestly Ron, use some critical thinking skills. I take on rights cases, what human or animal rights is he involved in?”
He doesn’t waste a moment in following Jack down, but he’s restrained by Jack’s feet against his chest, and after a few moments of pushing against each other, Jack manages to kick Draco off and scramble to his feet. Harry curses under his breath—Jack’s always been good at escaping ground fighting.
“Have you been here before? I can tell you what’s good,” Ron is saying as they wait for the woman ahead of them to finish ordering.
In the momentary quiet that follows, he ducks into the closest doorframe—the kitchen—and presses his back to the wall. His breath is forcefully slow to remain calm, his ears listening closely, and when he hears another footfall he spins out and aims a second spell, just missing by a hair. He ducks a fiery red shot, then returns another stunning spell and a disarming spell in a flurry that both miss the retreating figure. He shifts back into his doorway.
Harry stares thoughtfully into Jack’s eyes, a dark chestnut brown almost imperceptible from his pupils. It’s a wonder to him that someone can think so highly of his nature without being influenced by his story. It softens something in his defences, so when Jack says “Can I tell you what I think?” he says, “Of course.”
He chuckles, returning from the locker alcove, at the sight of Draco sitting with perfect posture on the bench, looking strikingly out of place in a dress shirt and a pair of perfectly fitting charcoal grey slacks, complete with an iron-pressed crease down the centre of the legs. He looks like Harry’s agent in all ways but his inattention on the ring; instead, he’s actively studying the laces of his shoes with grave importance.
“The warding was… more advanced than I thought she wanted. The property was massive. And then—Can I come in? It’s important.”
He snorts, and turns to point it out to Draco, but instead finds the man staring pale-faced and statuesque at a mail slot with
sit right by the door. Seems recklessly unnecessary for a man who prefers not to be spotted. Draco had looked their way only because Neville and Ron were making so much noise, and when he recognised the table and saw Harry, he looked away quickly and kept his head down until they reached their usual booth in the back.
This hadn’t been on his mind. He hadn’t spared a thought towards its possibility. Harry has been awake and busy all too long, while Draco’s hardly been awake long enough to think anything at all. And yet, when Harry pulls back, his eyes stare sparklingly into Draco’s.
She pages through silently. Draco sits in silence, too, waiting tensely, and eventually she sets them back on her desk, removes her glasses, and smiles warmly at him. She doesn’t do so often.
“I appreciate you… cleaning I think?” His gaze drifts to the feather duster in his small hand. “But you can go back to Hogwarts for the day, we need the house.”
He feels a point of pride at receiving another flash of teeth. “Cheers,” Potter says gratefully, finishing his pint.
He heard Harry huff a tight little breath to his right—he’d grown to feel appropriately complex emotions for the woman the more Draco had opened up—but Draco just smiled.
Harry doesn’t understand why it has to be one or the other, but he feels beat, exhausted, embarrassed, so he just mutters, “We’re fine.”
Draco leans in even closer, making Harry’s breath catch in his throat. They’re too close. He resists the urge to flinch, to move. Then, Draco pulls back.
Potter finally looks back to Ron and Draco takes the opportunity to disappear, grabbing Blaise’s arm firmly.
Harry doesn’t have the heart to tell him half-off was only a win compared to the exorbitant first offer he’d been given. He thanks him, genuinely, and Draco’s smile deepens.
stamp of approval,” Draco sneered. “I’m a tad more dubious of someone claiming to outdo the Hogwarts kitchen.”
“Draco Malfoy!” He freezes. “Did Harry leave you on your own before he’d even gotten you through a round of introductions? Isn’t he a rude one.” Molly Weasley is walking towards him even as she beckons him forward with her hands. She’s smiling, which is nice, and she’s already insulted Harry, which is nice, too.
“Of course their weapon of choice is paperwork,” Harry mutters. “I don’t see why we can’t just have a bloody duel.”
Harry had barely moved in before he moved back out, so it seems just as unlived in as it had when the trio abandoned it during the war. The kitchen, he expects, will be clear of Dark magic, as will the bedrooms used by the Order, but the rest will be useful to Draco and he expects the attic to be a minefield.
Blaise is still mouthing something to Draco that involves pointing to himself and Harry and drawing a big heart in the air when Pansy sits back down and chirps, “Oh! Looks like you’ll have to sit next to me, Luna.”
He forces Teddy to stand while he applies some extra cushioning charms on the grass, then allows him to remount. They fly high and start diving down only two or three metres repeatedly, to practice the movement. It’s a while before they talk again.
anything. That’s the point of the Blaise Method: overindulge until the fantasy is ruined and you can think practically again.”
Pansy, despite not knowing what connotation lay in Harry’s retort, took it as a sign to change the topic. Blaise was more than happy to help her, though he took time to shoot Draco a loaded look.
, want physical affection? The trip to Paris, the necklace research, the casework—to him, this is blatant proof of caring. But then he thinks of the little gestures he’s already seen Harry offer—a hand combing through his hair, a palm on his cheek, fingers linked into his own. And so, sitting unhelpfully with his book, he feels worriedly like a bad not-boyfriend waiting on his dinner. A not-boyfriend who desperately wants to convey perfection, to keep this happy.
Draco’s mad at him. Harry is almost positive. He’s been present, but extremely quiet, which—under the rules of
He’s countered with a dismissing wave of the hand and trails his friend back to the lockers, a bit achingly slow, pulling his shirt up to wipe his face off and appreciating the rush of adrenaline still coursing through his body.
Freedom was a luxury not offered to the criminally insane. But that was a past mindset, one riddled and broken by war and fear. Draco deserved to live, he deserved freedom just as much as the morally righteous.
“To pretend.” It was the first thing out of Malfoy’s mouth since they found themselves stuck in Deverill’s office. Harry’s gaze shot to Malfoy’s again. Malfoy swallowed; the muscles in his cheek jumped as he stared at a spot in the wall somewhere above their coach’s heads. When he spoke, his voice was devoid of emotion.
Finally, his fingers caught cold leather, and Draco pulled out his Potions book from the depths of his trunk with a relieved smile on his face. Only, when he toyed it between his hands, running his finger down its spine, it wasn’t his Potions book he was holding, but a small leather notebook entwined with yarn. A gold key clinking against the cover, inviting him to open it.
Harry didn’t shake his hand, instead, he pulled him closer, just enough to feel the whisper of lips against his, their hands intertwined in a shadow of the past. But they never did kiss, for they didn’t have time to, because Harry looked up, enraptured by the night. It was like the Great Hall, only so much better. They were silent as they stared at the dark expanse of sky. The sea of ashy stars that glittered over them like thousands of floating candles flickering and pulsing in an everglow.
She clucked her tongue. “You disappoint me, Draco, you’ve become no fun.” She cocked her head at Harry. “If I remember, the cute but dense ones have always been your type, no?”
Malfoy stepped forward, his eyes narrowed. And this was it, the part Harry revelled in. The way the sun would draw back, casting sharp shadows over their faces. How Malfoy’s lips curled as he geared himself for a fight. Harry’s face split into a grin—a terrible, shit-eating grin that he knew made Malfoy’s eye twitch—because his body was
your questions before I take my leave.” His lips turned up into a strained smile. “Do we have a problem with that?”
“There’s no need to trail my broom, you know. It’s still too early for the Snitch,” Draco drawled over the roar of the wind. Harry’s stomach swooped at hearing his voice again; he wanted to bathe in the sound of Draco’s long vowels, his slow slur. The way he made simple words bend to his will, dripping from his tongue in a lazy type of luxury.
To touch. To feel. To grab onto Malfoy’s hands, push them away and continue the journey downwards, unbuttoning his shirt until his fingers traced the band of his pants, slipped
Malfoy looped in the air again, an elegant swirl of robes and hair that painted a pretty picture amongst the backdrop of blue sky. He may not have been as fast as Harry, but Malfoy had a certain control to his every movement that Harry sometimes wished he had. Not that he’d ever admit that to the git.
Apolline pursed her lips. “I asked you to strip. You understand the concept, correct?” And this time, she spoke very slowly as if Harry was the one with the thick foreign accent all along.
He looked around the studio, which had seemed a lot smaller from the outside. There were large compartments all over the room, separated by thin walls of plaster. Everything was white; from floor to ceiling the studio was washed in stark nothingness. There weren’t even any windows to break it up; everywhere he turned, Harry was trapped between the four blank walls. His steps echoed, heavy and booming, across the empty room, which was barren of any props or furniture except for some large Muggle lamps that stood in each corner. Menacingly casting the studio in a sickly fluorescent hue.
As Harry started to shuffle his feet in an attempt to change his position, he felt Malfoy’s lips by the shell of his ear. “Don’t be sorry, dickhead,” he breathed, as his hand snaked to Harry’s, which was still clenched tight around Malfoy’s side. He wrapped his fingers around Harry’s wrist and moved, guiding his palm from it’s frozen position against his side, over to his stomach, and up the path of his abdomen. Harry could feel every muscle under his palm contract against the heat of his touch. The hair trailing down Malfoy’s sternum stood on end as goosebumps followed the same journey their connected hands made.
Draco bit his lip, which was chapped from the wind, and Harry wanted nothing more than to trace his tongue along each split. “We’re currently in a game.”
“I’m fine.” But Malfoy didn’t really sound fine, and Harry swallowed, because he wasn’t sure whether it was Harry that was the problem, or whether it was the intermittent sounds of a camera clicking all around them.
He was sick of living for other people’s benefit. He was not a charity, not a trophy to be gawked at. That’s why he hated the thirty-first, because above everything else, his birthday was
“I wouldn’t be getting my hopes up, if I were you,” Harry said, as he kicked a leg over his broom, knees low to the ground.
They stood there, staring under the weight of old war, until Harry pointed down to the top of his arm where the lines of a Golden Snitch began to form, feathered in flight amongst the black of an inky storm. Malfoy’s gaze followed the path of his hand before snapping up towards the ceiling again.
He’s an addiction all in words, the way he plays with the timbre of his voice, sucking you in until you're right where he wants you. Senseless and craving, overwrought and begging for more.
He was not going to let the stupid tosser ruin this any more then he already had. Sure, you could argue that this whole situation was almost equally Harry’s fault, but he wasn’t the one who proposed the daft
Potter looked at him funny, his eyebrows furrowed, and his nose scrunched in another expression Draco had never seen him make before. “No. Why would I be?”
with his slicked-back hair and self-important attitude, would never have batted an eyelid about prejudice. This image of Malfoy was different, it reminded him of the strange Draco Malfoy he saw crumbled on a dirty bathroom floor. Fingers running through the lengths of his perfectly styled hair.
Draco shrugged his shoulders and nestled his cheek further into Potter’s pillow. “How about: meet me in Paris when I’m no longer there.”
He didn’t answer for a while, unsure whether he should tell the truth. But he mapped Potter’s hand like he was seeing a new constellation for the first time. Potter let him, and so Draco traced the lines in his palm, the calluses on his fingers, the scars that stretched his skin and made him real. Made him human. Made him a bit broken just like Draco.
Then Malfoy, in the strangest of movements, took a large step back. It was the furthest away from Harry he had been since he’d walked into this place, and Harry didn’t quite know how to feel about it. The change was somewhat startling. Left him wrong-footed. “I thought we were supposed to… you know.” He flailed his hand around in the growing space between them, trying to express the thoughts he refused to say out loud.
Harry slammed his fist into Malfoy’s pointy nose until the skin of his knuckles ripped with the pressure.
And Harry should never have felt the depths of his disappearance, because how could one miss what was not theirs to kiss? But somewhere deep within the caverns of his mind he lost himself in a fantasy life: The warm touch of hands cruising along his chest, down the hard plains of muscle, and the tease of lips against the pulse of Malfoy’s pale wrist. He wanted, and he craved, and his skin burned with a fire untamed.
He continued to touch himself for a while before he heard the bedroom door close loudly. He snapped his head to the door and placed his hands by his sides on the mattress. He saw Potter walk towards him slowly, a smirk playing on his lips. Draco's breath came out in quick puffs as Potter got closer to him. He felt his cock throb in his pants and blush rise to his cheeks. Potter's smirk grew at the sight. Draco opened his mouth to say something but all that came out was a small, broken moan.
This chapter is kind of short and a bit bad i think in some parts but i can't bring myself to change it. I tried a bit of Harry pov like just a spec. don't know if you like it. also if there's any recommendations you want to give or something you want me to add like idk a scene you'd like or a kink or something like that i would greatly appreciate it. I want to try and make it better for you in any way I can so you know the drill.
"Great." She clapped her hands together. "Right this way, darling." Draco sighed and trailed behind her with his arms crossed.
"Here it is." He heard Pansy murmur to herself. She walked back to where Draco was, she said herself cross-legged in front of him and opened the lip gloss. It was a soft red colour that tasted like strawberries. It had a slight shimmer to it when you applied it to your lips. Draco had only ever used it when he was going to an event or a special party. "Right now open your mouth a bit." Pansy said, Draco complied and parted his lips as Pansy applied the gloss to his lips. "All done." She closed the lip gloss and placed it on the bed next to her and then took her finger and rubbed it lightly over his lips.
"Put this on." Pansy said, throwing him a silver chain at him. He put it around his neck. "This, as well." Pansy threw him a smaller necklace that had a small serpent in the middle. He put that on as well. "Good, now this earring." She passed him a silver earring in the shape of a feather. He took off his original black earring and put in the silver feather. "Perfect, now I think you should put on that lip gloss I got you for your birthday and I'll do your eye-shadow."
"Tell me when you want me to stop. Okay?" Potter said, his breath was warm against Draco's cheek. Draco nodded but Potter looked unimpressed. "Okay?" He asked again.
The door opened as Pansy opened her mouth to reply, "Hello, Potter." She said instead, with an obvious smirk on her lips. Draco quickly turned his head and saw Potter stand at the door, looking at them weirdly.
"Please." Draco whimpered. He bucked his hips against Harry's hand, desperate. Harry, in turn, took his hand away from Draco's crotch and grabbed his thigh again, squeezing hard, enough to leave a faint mark. "Please, Harry." Draco whimpered again, bucking his hips once more.
Harry then brought his lips to Draco's nipple and sucked. Draco arched into the touch with a loud and desperate moan emanating from his parted lips. He threw his head back as Harry returned his hand to Draco leacking cock, stroking it softly. Draco moaned again, a desperate sound, but resisted the urge to buck his hips into Harry's hand.
He cleared his throat, "Er, Malfoy, Parkinson." He said with a nod at each of them. Potter blinked a few times and then walked to his bed, still looking at them. Draco frowned and looked at Pansy.
Sitting down on his bed again while pansy looked for the lip gloss he thought of the last time he had worn make-up. He didn't wear it much, only on special occasions. He had never learned how to do it himself, it was always Pansy or even sometimes his mother who did it for him. He had never actually been able to do it properly and was hoping to learn to sometime in the future.
The 8th years had been forced to share a common room. McGonagall had said something about house unity at the start of the year. They still shared dormitories loke they used to, boys with boys and girls with girls. Sharing a bedroom with Potter was dangerous, in Draco's opinion. Sharing a room with the most handsome guy in Hogwarts was hard. They also had to share a bathroom. A fucking bathroom. He had to share a bathroom, and bedroom, with Harry fucking Potter. They didn't talk much, obviously, but Draco had noticed that Potter had still continued to stare at him like he was suspicious of him. Old habits die hard, Draco supposed.
"Sod off, Pansy." He said, although he did secretly wish that Potter would look at his arse tonight, though he would not say it out loud.
"I'm not going to be the only one to agree with you there, Draco." She said with a little smirk on her face. "I think Potter might have a fit."
Draco said nothing. He didn't like saying it, even if it was true. He didn't want to be one of Potters simpering fangirls, even if he was.
He opened the book on the right page and started to read. His vision blurred occasionally and his head pounded as he tried to figure out the words and sentences. He tried to concentrate for a while longer before closing the book and putting it on his nightstand. Sighing he covered his face with his arms, trying to ignore his half hard cock in his black pants. He took in deep, calming breaths, trying to bury the feel of Potter and the sound of his voice with no avail. He slid his hand slowly down from his face to his chest, still breathing deeply. When he reached his nippled he rubbed it lightly, breath hitching and face flushing. He continued to play with his hardened, pink nipple and then moved his hand lower towards his crotch, his hard cock straining against the dark cotton of his pants. He dragged his hand over his groin slowly, Potter's image in his head. His breath came out ragged and his face flushed harder. He felt naughty as he continued to palm himself through his pants, hips meeting the slow press of his hand. He brought his other hand down to his nippled and moaned low when his cold fingers made contact with the hard bud.
The lonely, quiet streets calmed his mind. He listened to the soft strums of the river, the melody of the waves as his body shivered for a match and the warmth he craved. And sometimes if he listened, he would hear a songbird sing in the distance, a lullaby that swam through the thick of the breeze and rippled the tops of the towering trees.
He had missed this back and forth with Draco, that fiery spark that darkened his eyes and sent Harry’s body on overdrive. Harry met him halfway, licking his lips, hungry to taste Draco all over again.
“Relax,” Harry whispered, and exhaled a long breath for the both of them. With his other hand, Harry felt the bob of Malfoy’s throat as he swallowed. “Relax.” Malfoy’s teeth unclenched, and as Harry moved up his jaw, teasing the soft skin of his cheeks, he could feel the muscles in his face ease.
Malfoy nodded his head, and his gaze flickered to somewhere in the distance—to Apolline, who was still clicking, and clicking, and clicking. Harry couldn’t help but think that this was wrong, that they shouldn’t be having this conversation, whatever it was, with an audience. No one should have been allowed to see the open and vulnerable expressions painted on Malfoy’s face. Only Harry.
“Regret has never stopped you before,” Harry said, before the blinding flash of cameras fired around them like gunpowder.
Malfoy stared blankly at the wall, while Apolline stood behind the camera with her arms crossed, one of her heels clicking against the floor. She tutted.
He slipped his palm under, hands roamed bare flesh, plains of smooth skin washed with a splattering of light hair. He touched, and he touched, and he touched, traversing the unknown wonders of milky ways and blushing nebulae in the midnight abyss.
He met his home in the dead of night, when the wind was howling and the rain was a heavy plight. Pansy said it was running away. But Draco knew lots about running, so Pansy didn’t have much of a say. This was a fresh start, a new him. A place where no one knew his face, where he could carve another name into the blank canvas of his skin. Cover the scars and the mistakes of his past, because this is where his story would begin.
She shot him a dark look that Molly would be proud of, and Harry raised his hands in surrender. It was indecently early in the morning to argue with a well-rested and fired up Hermione, and he was still nursing a horrendous hangover.
When Draco spoke next, his voice was a raspy whisper. “Apolline’s sending an owl later today with a selection of photos you were supposed to choose from. You can send them back with a note telling her you changed your mind. She’s an old friend of mine, Pansy’s fiancée. She won’t ask any questions.”
Time changed Harry, too; it pebbled along the stubble that paved a path around his lips. Peppered through the greying hair that veiled his temples. Time made space along the concrete of Harry’s skin, carving the shape of a gold ring on his left hand.
Malfoy stepped back, arms crossed over his chest. He had a smug expression on his face as if he already knew he had baited him, hook, line, and
Draco moved a slow trail down his sternum, tracing his fingers along each black letter that curled around his ribs.
This was the perfect weather for flying: the wind was but a soft breeze that wafted over them, marshmallow clouds covered the blinding rays of the sun, and the world was bright.
His breath was hot against Harry’s skin and lit a trail of goosebumps on a spiralling path down Harry’s spine. The soft strands of Malfoy’s hair brushed Harry’s cheek, and he couldn't help the irresistible urge to move into it, eyes closed, mind swimming in stuttering sensations.
“I should be offended that you think so little of me, no?” Her lips were thin and painted red, and when she spoke, she had a small smudge of it on her teeth. Harry tried not to stare at it out of politeness.
Soft feathers brushed his fingertips, and his whole body moved in sync with his hand to try and pull the Snitch out of the air.
“You never answered my question,” Malfoy whispers, and the feeling of his sweet breath against my cheek sends me high on a sugar rush. My hands slide into his hair, fingering fine threads of silk. I coax a low hum from his throat, breathless and ruined.
The stadium erupted with noise, thumping feet and thunderous cheers puncturing the air. Harry flew the both of them to the ground, and they rolled with the impact of touchdown. Draco lay over him, his legs straddling Harry’s hips. His face was painted in shock. “Did that just happen?” he asked incredulously.
His coach flicked his wand, and the newspapers opened to different pages. Every article that had been published about them since the Quidditch game in July was unveiled before Harry’s eyes.
Harry held his hands at the bottom of his jumper, playing and pulling at a loose thread. He cleared his throat again, trying to look anywhere but at Malfoy, but the entire room was too white, too glossy, and he felt like he could see Malfoy’s reflection everywhere he turned. “Right. Sure,” he rasped, and even to his own ears, he sounded like he’d been a chain smoker for about forty-something years.
“No, no. I didn’t mean it like that. I just…” He waved a hand around the room. “Expected to be taken the mickey out of.”
Shoes crunching on grass tore him from his reverie. Draco whipped around and there he stood, green eyes, crooked smile, and the painful sting of a memory. Potter’s hands caved into the depths of his pockets, a thin t-shirt stretched along the width of his chest. Draco’s eyes were caught on the man before him, the edges of a black wing wrapped around the taut skin of his shoulder, disappearing into the expanse of cotton.
“Don’t die on me,” Draco whispered after a while of playing dot to dot with the few stars left in the sky.
“Give them something to really talk about. Something so shocking that you getting drunk with your lackeys at the pub won’t be interesting anymore.”
Her voice was clipped as she said, “Do I look like a woman who's impressed by you lazing about? Wasting my time? Your wrinkles are only getting deeper by the minute.”
Here, wrapped in the lonely depths of Carnation Grove, was exactly where Draco belonged. Hidden by the riverside, where the black ink of a dying sky bloomed into the brightest of summer days.
Draco sat cross-legged on the floor of their lounge room, knees bumping Harry’s as he flicked through the old pages of his inked notebook.
Malfoy stopped the slow journey up his torso, Harry’s hand splayed flat over his chest in a mocking mimic of their reversed position days ago in that dingy bathroom.
Harry hummed, a low breath that swirled with the dust motes that floated against the dimming light of the sun. Harry sat the notebook on his thigh,
Sometimes he’d wander alone at the stroke of midnight, when the wind scraped and stung at his nape. But he didn’t mind so much, even if his jacket was too thin or the grass was soggy beneath his feet, because this was home, and home called out to him.
And when Harry finally came down from the high of his release, he felt nothing but an intense itch under his skin.
It was then that he realised that it wasn’t fair on either of them. It wasn’t fair for Draco who had wanted and
Harry walked, counting the cracks on the ground below, his head swimming with thoughts of a man he had almost known. Through the winding stone paths that had long since eroded, he strode on as blankets of snow melted into morning dew. Droplets of rain evaporated into the warmth of the sun, and suddenly, flower buds bloomed back from the underground.
and its tales of an illicit love affair between a former Death Eater and the Saviour of the bloody Wizarding World, instead of actual Quidditch stats.”
Draco knew about insanity because it curdled through his veins, surged through the blood that was his very name. He also knew about insanity because it showed its face each time he stared at his reflection. A shadow of dark hair, a slow stretch of lips into an unfamiliar smile. Eyes a maze of emotion he could get lost in, pulled into its depths like the overflooding water from the basin of the bathroom.
On the other side of the Great Hall, a small world away, a singular floating candle lit up the sky above it. A fragile golden glow that fought against the consuming darkness. A beacon and a promise after one’s dying wish.
So, he left them there. Maybe—and now this was a genius idea—if he completely refused to move for the rest of the night, he would forget about the sticky being table altogether.
Draco turned to face the Black Lake again and saw the blurry image of Potter standing beside him in the window’s reflection. He couldn’t help but remember cold condensation and fingerprints painting a mirror all those months ago. The desperation to touch hadn’t so much as ebbed, but Potter was like a Forbidden Fruit. He’d take a bite, taste the sweetness on his lips, only to be poisoned in the end.
Harry wouldn’t leave this damn pitch until he felt the soft feathers of the Snitch clasped between his warm hands.
Their brooms were side by side; if Harry just leaned over a little bit, their shoulders would touch.
He blinked, rubbed the haziness out of his tired eyes, and when he opened them, Harry was still there. He stood casually, hands in the pockets of a weathered leather jacket, and he smiled at Draco. Small and shy as if he wasn’t quite sure what was happening either.
in her eye. The ‘I told you so’ glare, without her even having to utter the words. She had warned him, and he didn’t listen. Harry put his head in his hands and let out a long string of expletives that did nothing to make him feel better. He realised, with a pitiful, sinking feeling, that there was no turning back from this.
“Stop,” Malfoy said, barely above a whisper. “I never meant—” Malfoy looked down at his palm still flat against Harry’s chest. He curled his fingers ever so slightly, the material of Harry’s jumper bunching between his fist before he let go and placed his hand by his side, as if he was giving Harry the chance to leave if he wanted to. “I never meant for things to turn out like this. With the press and that
Three years had made its mark on Draco, it squeezed his chin into a sharper point, stretched his lips, and hollowed out his cheeks. His eyes were still round and large, though, glinting silver. Soft, puffy skin pillowed underneath.
Ripped at the seams like the jagged teeth of a zipper strangled between fabric. Where milky skin used to be, the tease of freedom cut deep. A permanent reminder of the man he’d once been.
“Boring question. Potter gets off on saving people so I’d hardly call it anything else than what it is: fuel for his fantasies.”
Harry felt the stutter of Draco’s breath against his face—that stifling staccato rhythm as he swallowed. Draco averted his gaze, staring holes somewhere above Harry’s head, and Harry wanted, with a burning desperation, to understand Draco, to learn which thoughts were running through his mind. Draco frowned, creases dipping between his eyebrows, and Harry smoothed his thumb over the soft skin there, melting the tension away.
“Have you ever wondered what could’ve happened if things were different?” Potter asked one day as they sat side by side on top of Draco’s four-poster bed.
During the day, Hogwarts was a crumbling graveyard. The smell of death lingered heavily in the air. Draco wasn’t sure whether the other students were mourning Dumbledore, or the death that edged closer as the clock rang its toll at every stroke of midnight. No one but Draco knew the extent of the damage to come in the following months, but it was felt. As if Hogwarts itself was a living entity. A whispered plea in each creak of the floor. A cry in the stones as they walked head down through the halls.
Harry glanced up at Draco for a split second, humming as he sent him a wink, and climbed higher up the nose of the broom. Draco’s arm was still stretched towards the Snitch, but his eyes were focused solely on Harry’s chest to where the two halves of the broken snitch fluttered and curled into each other.
Strangers flashed him hidden smiles as if trying to pretend he wasn't anyone important. As if he couldn’t see exactly how they parted for him each time he stumbled across the dim room. How they grabbed at his arms. Tugged his hair. Ran fingers down his sweaty back.
He glanced at the Snitch again, just a flicker of his gaze, before flying straight towards Draco and  wrapping himself into his space. His smell. His warmth.
On the pillow, Draco’s head tilted down so their noses aligned. “We’re more similar than I realised,” he whispered. Draco’s mouth parted, then, and a sliver of warm breath fluttered against Harry’s face as Draco began to press slow, lazy kisses over him. Underneath his jaw...by the corner of his lips…
Harry leaned in despite every will of his mind telling him not to. But he didn’t dare touch, for that would break the fragile delirium that separated fantasy from reality.
Swirls of ink curled around the bends and dips of his body as if each line and every stroke was forged solely for Harry. His skin was crafted like marble, the ink as much a part of him as the patterns of his fingerprints. The full length of an owl’s wing wrapped around his shoulder blade and across his chest. On a forearm, the sharp lines of the Forbidden Forest and a flying Golden Snitch outstretched.
Harry let instinct take over, as he pushed his body to its limits, and then some. His body ached with the tension in his muscles, but the only thought that echoed through his mind was—
Harry brushed his fingers through Draco’s hair, pushing silky strands away from his eyes. Draco’s body melted underneath the heat of Harry’s touch, and then they were moving, slowly collapsing on top of the cotton sheets of his bed. Draco’s head lay on Harry’s pillow, their legs slotted between each other.
“Don’t leave,” he said, and Draco couldn’t help the stinging laugh at the irony of it all. “I just want you to know that I’m so
But he could do nothing except stare into the sea of screaming bodies, nod his head and smile as the reporters asked him increasingly intrusive questions, voices overlapping as they jostled for his attention.
Malfoy’s eyes flashed something dark and terrifying. He leaned down, closer, lips tracing Harry’s earlobe. “Do my proclivities offend you?” he whispered.
He couldn’t quite tell for sure, but Harry was almost certain he heard Draco laugh from behind the blanket of wind surrounding them. “You’re quite the sweet talker. I didn’t know you had it in you.”
If Harry had attended his Mindfulness lesson on Thursday, he might have learned how to cope with undesirable situations, confront his problems, and face them head on. He didn’t do that, or at least, not in the way his instructor—a stiff old woman with a voice of scratching chalk—intended.
Harry could do nothing but nod his head and try to swallow the lump in his throat as he bent down to pick up what he now realised were Malfoy’s robes—Malfoy’s
Harry cleared his throat. The thought hadn’t even crossed his mind to look away, to give Malfoy some privacy, because the only voice that rang inside of his head was a frenzied blur of
Hermione made a show of rolling her eyes, but a fond smile lit up her features so Harry counted that as a personal win. “When this all blows up in your face, I
Father had bought Draco a new Potions textbook for his birthday. He said it was an advanced Master’s book that Draco wouldn’t be able to find in the
Draco stepped back, the water spilled from the basin like a waterfall and pooled around his feet. He turned around, as if to be sure that his source of madness was not actually standing behind him. But as always, the water splashed in curling waves up his ankles—his only company.
Unless that war began with a pointy git, and ended with a well-thrown punch to said pointy git’s face.
“You’re alright, too, Draco,” he said and his lips parted ever so slightly. An invitation. A beckon. A call.
He gives me a smirk and nothing more, taking another drag of the cigarette. The lights all around us paint the swirl of smoke purple, and it draws from the tip of his lips like poison. I want it, and Malfoy knows. Of course he knows.
Apolline didn’t even spare him a glance as she smirked at Malfoy. “You heard the man, don’t keep him waiting.”
And so he walked, and walked, and walked, just as he did come every nightfall. The cobblestone streets and the narrow brick alleyways looked the same as the last; the same hum of sounds, the same blur of faces.
“I suppose. When you have nothing left, you’ve got no choice but resign yourself to such fantasies.”
“I’m in love with a fucking idiot,” Draco mumbled, before his eyes snapped to Harry’s, a whirl of emotions flooding his face.
Harry gulped, but he stared at Draco’s eyes with an unyielding conviction that it was hard to look anywhere else. And Draco swallowed his every word like an addict, a beggar. Wanting
“You can’t say things like that when it’s untrue.” Malfoy's voice was soft, syllables slurred around a gasp. It was so unguarded, so vulnerable, and so un-Malfoy-like that it startled Harry. Maybe that was the point; maybe the man lying naked on top of his bed sheets—legs intertwining, hands roaming, sensations blooming was not Malfoy at all.
“Potter?” he whispered, because even though he stood in front of the face he had seen in only memory, it couldn’t be. Another illusion in his reality. Fake eyes, and a fake smile, and a fake Harry amongst the real cobblestone streets and the flickering lanterns.
Sixth year had carved a permanent scar in Draco, his round, glinting eyes sunken in his head. Lips bitten raw, the skin around his face sucked dry and sallow.
So, maybe Harry was a bit of an idiot sometimes. He could healthily admit that, because his Mindfulness program drilled into him every Monday and Thursday to
It was strange to realise at such a young age that his end was right around the corner, it beckoned him and called his name. Until one day, he’d make that final turn and stare his expiration right in its blackened eyes. Draco didn’t know what would finally do him in, either the skull etched into his arm or the four walls of Azkaban.
Gold and green. Blue sky and white skin, and threads of shimmering silver. A prism of light that coalesced and intertwined between the heat of their bodies.
Draco smiled. He wished it didn’t look as bitter as he knew it did. “Mother used to say it all the time. When goodbye is too painful of a word to speak, meet me in Paris when I’m no longer there.”
Harry saw the world through half-shut, blurry eyes. Vibrant colours assaulted his vision, but as one swig followed the next, it seemed to bother him less and less. Bulstrode hadn’t left his side since they’d all rocked up at the club, and he was stuck sitting at a crowded bar as she chatted up the (admittedly fit) bartender. Every time he turned to leave, she’d pierce her nails into his knee without even breaking eye contact with the (admittedly fit) bartender. She gave him sideways glances, her lips pursed to one side in an expression that reminded him eerily of somebody.
The next few days passed in a sluggish blur, and Harry battled with two very contrasting mental states. Most of the time, he convinced himself that the photoshoot wasn’t actually happening, and if he kept it locked so far in the back of his mind, he wouldn't ever have to deal with it.
was spinning, which meant he wasn’t that drunk. Brilliant. He’d give Malfoy a piece of his mind, rough him up a bit. Bulstrode was too busy with the girl behind the bar anyway.
Draco could find it somewhere within himself to forgive Potter, but not the others. Not the others who believed they had every right to spit on
Malfoy took a step forward, and in the electric space that pulsed between them, Harry’s head pounded with the heavy smell of Malfoy’s cologne. It winded him, his heart a rapid pummel inside his chest. And when it all seemed too much—the thick ropes of tension that wound in the small space around them—Malfoy finally pulled the trigger.
“Out of my way, Malfoy,” Harry yelled over the roaring of the wind. The drum of the crowd pulsed a steady rhythm around them: stomping feet and clapping hands. The audience sang a cacophony of words, a tune that rang in his ears as he saw another flicker of the Golden Snitch just up ahead, Malfoy still in front of him.
Malfoy said nothing but he walked to one of the bathroom walls and sat with his knees up on the dirty floor. The refined elegance and long lines hunched over himself. The pristine suit against the backdrop of mould and peeling plaster. It was so uncharacteristic to the Malfoy he knew.
Harry frowned, but began to trace along the swirling lines of the ink and felt a small thrumming sensation alight the pads of his fingertips—a twining lick of magic that bloomed beneath the heat of his skin. As he finished tracing the last letter of Apolline’s name, the parchment transformed like the blank walls of plaster in her studio.
Malfoy pulled him by the material of his robes and Harry came barreling forward, falling right in the welcoming arms of his chest. Harry steadied himself with a warm hand over the cold skin of Malfoy’s side, the space just before it dipped into his waist. This close, with his head right near the crook of Malfoy’s neck, he could inhale nothing but the sweet smell of Malfoy. His shampoo, something soft and lemony. Tempting him, coaxing him to run his fingers through the silky strands. This close to his skin, it was all he could do to stop himself from moving closer, licking the sensitive area underneath his ear. To taste the intoxicating scent of his cologne. Something earthy and woody, as if they were flying high above the clouds, tasting the air and rushing through the wind.
Harry closed the newspaper with shaking hands. It made a heavy clamour as it fell face first to the table, and he incinerated it with a strong burst of wandless magic that bubbled out of him.
When he flew, everything else washed away until all that mattered was the feeling of wind whipping through his hair and the blisters on his fingers as he gripped his Firebolt.
He sat with his back against the wall, the spray of water curling down his body, slicing his skin in hot pellets. “Fuck you, Malfoy,” he whispered, his voice a slow, drawl of bliss. In these moments of delirium, where the chains in his mind bent to the beckoning hand of pleasure, he couldn’t help but remember the memories.
Harry almost convinced himself he could feel the waves of anticipation roll off Draco’s body as he stared into the distance, grey eyes made of flint. Draco stared at the crowds—and Harry stared at Draco. He stared up at the horizon—Harry still stared at Draco. He stared at the expanse of hills in the distance, plush green and hazy from the wisps of fog in the air—and Harry stared at nothing but Draco.
Two Bludgers came barreling between them, and Harry swerved just in time, his heart plummeting to his stomach as a blur of blue grazed his hair. Harry looked up and saw Draco climbing higher into the air. He followed him.
That familiar thrum flooded Harry’s body again, the thunderous vibration of his heart pumping in his chest. The feeling of adrenaline and blood, and something darker. That desperate need to dig his fingers into the skin of Malfoy’s shoulder until his nails carved crescent moons along his body. Because this was
As soon as Harry touched the wing, it began to flutter slowly in his hand. It was a small movement—barely more than a whisper—but the Snitch’s wings pulled towards each other like the electric charge of a magnet, and as they drew closer, they flapped excitedly, as if their entire cores were tied to each other. Harry couldn’t help but wonder if the Snitch’s wings had missed each other, somehow. He hadn’t realised that Draco had kept the wing too. A small part of him, in a dark corner in the back of his mind, questioned if that was the reason he had been so drawn to Draco in the first place.
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” and Potter smiled a lopsided grin that alit a fire through Draco’s body. A tumultuous glow of heat that rippled and curled inside of him like the waterfall of running water from the basin of the bathroom.
shirt that was pearly white. Until it wasn’t. Because then it was a bit blue, and a bit pink, and it was so many colours. Too many colours. And the shirt had the indecency to be unbuttoned all the way down to his sternum, and it was way too much skin.
I take a step closer and I’m wrapped within the arms of his orbit; he smells sweet like trouble, bitter like temptation. My lips begin to trace his ear. “As if I’d flirt with you, Malfoy.”
And that was it. Blood rushed from Harry’s head to the bottom of his feet. The world spun, tipping completely on its axis as Harry tried desperately to find solid ground where there was none. Even though the bathroom was dim, with nothing but a flickering fluorescent light above them, the room became too bright, too loud, too constricting. All he could smell was Malfoy. And through the blinding yellow light, all he could see was Malfoy and his self-satisfied smirk. He could taste the bitter air through his panting breaths, and he needed to leave. To escape. To find fresh air and solid land because he couldn’t bear for his senses to drown under the weight of Malfoy any longer.
“I met Jacques at a party,” Harry started. “I thought he was a right prick. Couldn't stand him and I planned to just walk away until he started talking about his husband
“Do you know what I mean?” Harry pressed. “I want you to leave him and come home with me. It feels and sounds so incredibly selfish but I — I just want to give you everything he has deprived you of.”
Draco covered his mouth when Harry moved lower and licked at his entrance. Harry murmured a lubricating spell and then pressed a finger against Draco's hole. He settled unto leaving marks on the pale skin of Draco's thighs, peppering kisses from time to time.
“I'm going to try and guess instead, is that okay?” Draco found himself nodding absently. Harry hummed. “let's see. . . You're troubled about something. . .”
His heart sank to his stomach. And the way he whirled around so suddenly felt too familiar to him, almost a deja vu moment. Save for the fact that instead of a dingy bathroom in an old castle, it was under the dimmed light of a sleek and modern kitchen, his stance unassuming with a relaxed and knowing look on his face and he certainly didn't have his wand out and ready to hex his face off.
“I didn't remember, up until now,” Draco couldn't look him in the eye as he confessed, guilty. “though I suppose the memories have always been there, waiting to be brought out and I just had no idea how, nor did I have anyone to do it for me,” Draco paused, hesitant then recited almost mechanically. “because Jacques is the only one who has ever loved and adored me for what I am.”
And God answered, Draco thought as he peered up at a pair of concerned, safe and warm green eyes, arms secured around him. He smiled before drifting off to sleep.
Somehow, when those came from Harry's lips with all the sincerity in the world, Draco was inclined to believe him.
, fuck, Harry!” he gave a startled cry, which faded into a series of whimpers when Harry pressed his hips down, rubbing clothed groin against groin. Draco squeezed his thighs around Harry's hips, he could feel his underwear beginning to soak with precome.
A weak sigh slipped past his lips and he curled tightly to himself, desperately seeking for the lost sense of comfort he was promised since the day of their marriage. The warmth and the feeling of contentment he should feel in their own bedroom, pressed against the heat of his husband's body beside him.
did, but it never came. He then realized Harry wasn't angry at him. “Fuck what he thinks. Fuck whatever bullshit he tells you,” he wiped at the drying tears on Draco's face. “so what if you were a Death Eater at
— and he wanted out. With that in mind, he threw the blankets off of him and stood up, leaving the room without sparing a single glance behind him. He all but ran to the direction of the kitchen as quietly as he could, fetching himself a cold glass of water and downing it all in one go. He squeezed the counter tight until his knuckles turned white , glaring at the wedding band on his finger as though it was the root of all his misery. In a way, it was.
His husband whom Harry knew and loved first. And now Harry has come back to take what was supposed to be his all along. Harry got him. Harry has no intention of ever letting Draco slip from his grasp ever again.
Along with the memories, a familiar flicker of fire hot emotion sparked in his heart, waiting to be fanned to a flame.
“No, don't be. I didn't mean — It's just. . .” Harry sighed. “I missed you so much, Draco. Now that I found you, I don't feel like letting you go again.”
. Harry growled and snapped his hips even harder, relishing at the sight of Draco's lashes fluttering and silver eyes rolling upwards. He rolled his hips up to meet Harry's thrusts just as enthusiastically. It suddenly dawned on Harry how deprived and needy Draco was but the realization that startled him was how willing he was to give it to him. Whatever he wanted and whenever he needed it.
Draco remembered that night very well. He had been dosed with an extremely potent Sleeping Draught and only came to at noon the next day with a thundering headache.
Harry chuckled, more at himself. “I begged the French Ministry for his and your file until they finally handed it over. And there it was, your name with his stupid surname. I was seven years too late. I thought it was stupid to feel so hurt about a school boy nemesis turned sweetheart,” he wet his lips. “I kept trying to get in his good side until he trusted me enough to invite me over to talk business. I was ecstatic at the thought of seeing you again. A treacherous part of me hoped that maybe it wasn't too late, after all.”
It was a discovery. Slow, and uncertain—a question awaiting its answer with every push and pull. But in the silence after each stuttering breath, it was also coming together. Melding. Connecting, like the river running home to the sea.
Harry drummed his fingers on the table, a sheepish grin on his face. “It was a good incentive, sure, but still not the point.”
Harry was flying blind; he moved on instinct and memory alone. He knew the sky like he knew his own name, and as each drop of rain heated his skin, he felt more alive. Thunder pulsed the thick clouds around him, and he zig-zagged past lightning that shocked the ground. His uniform was soaked with sweat and rainfall. Blood danced through his veins to the beat of his heart, and he sang with it.
“Hit too close to home, have I?” he drawled, but his voice was nothing more than a calm whisper. Harry felt every single one of his inhibitions break. A snapped tether. Shattered glass.
Draco took control of the Firebolt, then, curving up into an arc so that it climbed higher in the sky. Harry reached up and grabbed the broom handle, placing his hands in the spot underneath Draco’s own grip. The broom kept moving upwards until it was almost entirely straight, so that the only thing left between Harry and Draco was the stick of wood sharply pressing against their chests. They both wrestled for control, the ground but a green blur below them.
Harry’s eyes searched the sky for that spark of gold, and saw it dart right ahead of them, barrelling towards the private suites above the
Time surrendered to them, frozen between every exhale of breath; it was only them two, held under the light of the waning moon. They kissed to the sounds of the forest, lying on their bed of leaves. Fireflies murmured, their tails like glowing stars dancing in spirals around their intertwined feet. Draco curved into Harry, until his tattoos seeped into the bare expanse of Draco’s skin.
The breeze wafted through his hair, caressing his skin. The smell of ozone and sweat. The rush of blood to his head as gravity pulled him from his legs.
“Harry.” Deverill eyed him from across the desk, leaning forward, his eyebrows drawn into a deep set frown. “I understand how you feel about this. Trust me, I do. But the rumours have gone too far. The
It was more than forgetting his name, more than forgetting consequences, or forgetting himself to the sweet bliss of oblivion. It was forgetting how he shouldn’t want the man so desperately in front of him.
Draco’s fingers ran through the lengths of Potter’s hair, and he, in turn, held onto Draco like his life depended on it. And maybe that was wishful thinking, but as he licked the seam between Potter’s lips, he pulled him ever so closer until their whole bodies intertwined. And Draco was utterly and undeniably intoxicated. By the smell, by the taste, by the touch. Intoxicated with Potter.
The photo flickered, and a streak of static pulsed through the parchment as the image changed over. In the corner, a small number
“Perhaps,” Draco whispered, as he stared up at the ceiling. The fading moon was sheathed by thick clouds of fog, and the stars dwindled in their brightness. It was too dark to identify the constellations, and so Draco stared into nothingness—swirls of grey—just searching. Searching for something to anchor onto. In a crumbling world that swallowed him whole, he wanted nothing more than to find solid ground.
Harry gritted his teeth, desperately raking the air for a glimmer of gold. He climbed higher, trying to lose Malfoy to the wind, but the other man mirrored his every step, flying parallel to him.
He wanted and he craved, and this was the only thought pulsing through him as he pushed his way through the loud thumping music of the club. It was a poisonous want that pushed Harry forward, urging him towards Malfoy, who seemed similarly pulled to Harry. Like oil sliding through water, they parted the sea of strangers until they were so close, Harry could almost taste the blood red wine on the tip of Malfoy’s lips.
articles had sparked noise and controversy in the Wizarding World. Now, everyone had their eyes on Harry and Malfoy’s every move, their every word, their every glance. The reporter’s craved something sinful to talk about, evidence of their so-called illicit love affair.
Harry exhaled to steady his breathing. He wasn’t a horny sixteen year old. He was an adult. What’s a bit of skin?
Unwittingly, his gaze flickered to Malfoy standing rigid next to Apolline. His cheeks were splattered red, but Harry didn’t think he had any right to be embarrassed about this situation, considering he had had no instructions from the slightly scary woman to strip in front of them.
Malfoy released a breath, a low, stuttering gasp. His eyes shot open, and he looked as though he wanted nothing more than to hold his breath captive again.
He turned around to see familiar bottle-green eyes, ablaze with an emotion time had rendered foreign to him. But he had a mess of black hair that looked no different than when they were children.
His eyes shut. The colours faded. The lights waned. The smiles melted. He took one heavy swig in complete darkness, and when he opened his eyes again, he slipped into a rapid descent of senses.
He stepped away from the blonde man and turned to Malfoy. There was something in his eyes that Harry couldn’t decipher, but he was too far gone to care.
Harry mirrored his position, their bare shoulders touching as Harry stared down at the duvet covering their laps. His fingers pulled at the material. “Why are you so obsessed with the media?”
Harry didn’t think he could ever have enough of this. After falling so deep within the pool of Draco’s arms, he never wanted to find air again. His head held underwater, the smell of sea salt and sweat. Maybe it was drizzling again, or maybe his body had turned to liquid under Draco’s palms, but Harry couldn’t care enough to open his eyes and check.
He hummed with the familiar flutters of life. The soothing croon from the bluebird, perched on the ledge outside. The pinpricks of a needle buzzed a song of its own, and here, in this old, little town, Harry had found his home.
He’d go to the pub with Ron and Hermione, and suddenly he was a tragic hero dealing with the fall of the war. Drinking his woes away with Obliviation-spiked alcohol. Or he’d be at the club with his mates from
The world slowly faded into focus like a long summer day that stretched into a longer winter night. Blurs of colour swirled his vision; chocolate brown, midnight blue, and a gold that pulsed and shivered before his eyes. He blinked through the colours, and the room became too dark and too bright all at once.
Instead, Harry dipped through the air. The nose of his broom pointed straight for the ground, and his heart plummeted with the steep drop. Harry revelled in the feeling. He moved so fast his breath was barely an afterthought in the rush of gravity. His chest burned, but he willed it away with a sharp turn to the left, barely missing one of the other team’s goal posts.
Malfoy turned an expression of ire at Apolline, but her smile didn’t wane. “Pas maintenant,” he said through clenched teeth.
Alicia would redirect, hurling it over her shoulder with a practiced accuracy. Lisa or Davies would catch it and make the final mark, sending the Quaffle in the hoop between Flint’s legs.
Moonlight licked his body in ribbons of silver thread. Shadows strung along the horizon, as towering trees dipped towards their fallen leaves. The ebb and flow of the river echoed in a slow, beating pulse, but all Harry could hear was the deep gasping breaths that exhaled from the depths of Draco’s chest. It was music to his ears, a swelling symphony that coalesced with the whispers of night.
It was with this thought that he began to swoop in a circle, gaining power and speed as he swerved through the sky and across the Quidditch pitch. From the corner of his eye he saw that same splash of gold through a small crack in the clouds. Harry made his way towards Draco, green eyes piercing through the fog as the world blurred around him.
The cobblestone path to Carnation Grove was a quiet trek; a puzzle of brown pebbles bathed in the sweet wash of a golden sunset. Plush moss grew between the cracks and scars of the stone, and wilted flower petals paved the green overgrown.
Instead, it was freedom. It was open air, flying higher, higher, higher above a blooming ground. Getting tangled in soft, marshmallow clouds. And as Malfoy ran strong hands down the middle of Harry’s chest, through the splattering of dark hair there, it was electric, too. Voltaic air and the smell of ozone and sweat pulsed like lightning and thunder between them.
and the next few moments slowed down like the blurry seconds between slumber and consciousness. He held out his shaking arm, soggy with sweat and dried blood and placed it on Potter’s shoulder.
His father narrowed his eyes. “I thought I told you, Curse-Breaking isn’t going to get you a high rank in the Wizengamot. Stop being such a child, Draco, I raised you better than that.”
“No. Don’t.” He shook his head, and his eyes flickered away. “Don’t ruin this. Just don’t.” And his voice sped up, as though if he were to speak any slower, the meaning behind his words would catch up to his mind. “Leave everything in the past, and let me pretend. Just this once, I want—I’ve been waiting so
Potter’s fingers touched his neck. Draco’s eyes snapped to his. And in the silence that stretched on, it was as if they both knew they had crossed that line. His hand began to explore, then, a slow journey from the bob of his Adam’s apple to the shape of his jaw. No destination, just the curiousness of something new, of discovering the unknown in the palm of his hands.
Insanity was also a pageant for the criminally sane. Eyes upon your every step as they watched your fall from grace like it was their only entertainment, applauding after the final knell. That eagerness to witness it all over again because once you taste the bittersweetness of the wicked, you cannot come back from it. The morally righteous were not much better than the morally corrupt, in that way. War did that to a person, turned the good insane and the bad more deranged.
The silence in the room turned deafening despite the muddled sounds of thumping bass and idle chatter. He could feel the eyes pouring over him, drinking him up like he had before. But he was too drunk to care, past the point of absolute bliss and oblivion. His gaze wandered towards Malfoy across the dance floor who stood frozen amongst the sea of people. He stared at Harry with an expression he could only assume was shock, and that served the bastard right, he’d have to try a hell of a lot harder to humiliate him. Harry laughed into the man’s lips, stuck his finger up at Malfoy, and fisted the collar of the man’s crinkled shirt, bringing their chests flush, the heat of their bodies overwhelming.
“You may call me Apolline. I take my art very seriously. If you come across a problem, or if you need to stop, you tell me. Understood?”
Harry could do nothing but nod his head as he walked towards the lake, mimicking Malfoy’s slow steps until he felt the cold water seep to his skin underneath his jeans. He stopped when they were barely an arms length apart. Harry fisted his hands deep inside the pockets of Malfoy’s robes, and he watched the way Malfoy’s gaze tracked the movement. His grey eyes flicked everywhere as if he was contemplating, and the darkness within them reminded Harry of the way Malfoy eyed the Snitch. As if he was hungry for it, to feel the smooth golden metal between his hands. As if he’d do absolutely anything to wrap his hands around the unattainable. As if he’d do anything to win.
“Congratulations.” Malfoy deadpanned, a pained grimace on his face. “Now run along to Millie, you’re ruining my pulling game.”
“I lied,” Harry whispered against Draco’s cheeks. “That day in the bathroom, after the press conference, I said that whatever happened between us at
Harry’s head rested halfway off his pillow, his nose buried in something hard and warm. He inhaled, and the soft notes of lemon and wood enveloped his senses. Calming. Soothing. He sighed into it, moving closer, wrapping himself in the scent until all he could feel was warmth. His eyes lazily fluttered open and shut in time with the low rise and fall of breathing. The sound was a distant murmur in Harry’s mind, drowned out by the trickle of rain thumbing a soft rhythm on the window pane.
“I never had the chance to understand my feelings, Draco.” He licked his lips, unsure of how to properly respond. “I went through most of my life
“You know, if you’re trying to show off to all your fans, there are other ways,” a voice drawled from right by his ear, and its closeness made Harry almost slip off his broom. He’d been so consumed by the game he hadn’t seen Malfoy’s approach.
He craved, he craved, he craved. And as he moved into the blonde man’s space imagining another in his place, he felt the tell-tale prick of the broken Snitch’s wing in his pocket. He froze.
“Not to worry, Mr. Potter, you’ll find it quite hot soon enough,” Apolline quipped from across the studio.
Before Draco could say anything in retort, Harry felt his last burst of power push him forward—that final inch closer. The muscles in his stomach grew taut, contracting against the rush of the wind as his hand finally—
“It’s the truth. Face it. You could have had absolutely anyone, but every time you had the chance, who did you choose? Tall, bratty blondes. You might as well have called my name in front of the whole fucking club.”
On the other side of the river was a small shop in the lonely parts of Carnation Grove. Hardly anyone wandered past, and business was slow. Harry kept the window wide open, allowing the cool, brisk air to waft in, brush his hair, and kiss goosebumps along his skin.
He felt the heavy weight of Malfoy’s hands finger the hem of his jumper, and the moment seemed to last a lot longer than it should have as Malfoy gently dislodged his glasses from the tangles of hair and fabric and began to slowly—so
“Oh! How awfully crass of me,” Malfoy drawled, his hand clutched to his chest. “I should have led you a nice, straight path to the Snitch, instead.”
“There’s one more rule you forgot to mention,” Malfoy begins. He pulls back, takes a sip of his Butterbeer, and this feels eerily like the end. I welcome it with open arms, ready and willing to bend to Malfoy’s every word no matter the comedown. “Don’t fucking fall in love.”
Harry didn’t really know what he meant by that, but Draco’s face shuttered as if he had said something he wasn’t supposed to. His expression turned into that familiar blank mask.
But Malfoy didn’t move so much as an inch as Harry fisted his t-shirt, preparing to draw it over his head. Harry stood frozen, the bottom of his top bunched above the waistband of his jeans. He felt a bite of cold air against the sliver of exposed skin on his abdomen, and he wasn’t entirely sure what he was waiting for, or what he was doing. Perhaps he was giving Malfoy time to move away, but as the seconds stretched longer, Malfoy stayed near. He stood too close, eyes locked, as Harry finally pulled his shirt over his head, scrunched the fabric into a ball, and chucked it somewhere in the distance. Malfoy’s throat bobbed up and down.
Every shit thing that had happened leading up to this point seemed almost dull compared to what had just exited Deverill’s mouth. To be honest, Harry was having a hard time believing it at all; surely, this was a cruel joke. In the next moment Deverill would laugh that booming, low laugh, slap his back, and mutter how gullible he was.
he snapped at the owl, dropping the letter onto the bench as he tried to shake off the pain. “What was that for?”
what you do in your spare time! Just don’t bring it to work. These rumours don’t only affect you, they affect the
Suddenly, the legs wrapped around Harry’s hips tightened, yanking sideways, and before Harry could do anything, he felt his entire world tilt on its axis. The broom leveled out, halting their rapid descent, but the sharp jolting sent them hanging upside-down, both of them holding on with only the sheer strength of their thigh muscles. Once again, they were nose-to-nose, but the moment didn’t last long, because as Harry stared into Draco’s eyes, Draco
“Listen, Harry, level with me here. I don’t know the history between you two, but you need to keep it in your pants.
Harry shook his head as he stared at the ceiling, tracing the dark green mould that was growing between the cracks. He took a deep breath and ran a shaking hand through the lengths of his hair, damp with tap water and sweat.
It bubbled through him, making his limbs jittery. He gripped his hands onto the wood of his Firebolt, Quidditch robes billowing softly behind him. The commentator was saying something in the distance, but all Harry could focus on was the smell of fresh air, broom polish, and clean robes. Lemon and wood.
Point being, Harry had restraint, and Harry was still coherent, and Harry had every bit of his wits about him. That’s why it was terribly startling when his brain finally caught up with his eyes, and he saw gunmetal grey at the front door of the club.
The owl came not long before lunch time, tapping its beak impatiently against Harry’s window while he was sitting down with a large cup of tea. As soon as Harry opened it, the owl came flying in and sat on top of his kitchen bench, an envelope tied neatly to its leg. Harry’s breathing quickened as he untied the long piece of twine from the owl and thumbed the white envelope between his fingers. A neat, swirling monogram was engraved in the bottom corner:
He was fine. Malfoy was a git anyway, he reminded himself, before any unwanted images of a pale expanse of skin, blushed pink under the hot steam of water, met his mind.
And he was alive. So alive. Potter’s lips chased all the numbness away, and his heart beat a pulsing rhythm he had never felt before. He had been wandering lost and blind all his life until he found the universe between the slow, uncertain movements of their lips. And it was glorious, and beautiful, and warm, and bright. And he had been waiting so long for this, begging on desperate, aching knees for one drop of water in a lonely drought.
Malfoy leaned down, right up against his face. “A Big Gay Potter scandal, hmm?” His voice was a low thrum that twisted Harry’s gut. “Think of all the poor children. How will we ever survive knowing that our Saviour has been a big, fat ponce all along?”
With a sudden fire that flared deep within his chest, Harry yearned for Malfoy to see the same changed man Harry saw. But his eyes were flint as he glared out the window, staring unseeingly at his reflection as cicadas chirped brightly in the distance.
As if the words he spoke weren't actually coming out of his mouth at all, but somewhere else. “Of me. Of your own feelings. Of how people see you...”
He ran his fingers along the expanse of pale skin; painting a mirage—cold ink against warm breath. Harry melted like dusk into the fluorescent glow of dawn, the sun held high in the sky as flowers bent their heads to cave under its warmth.
Grimmauld Place: dark halls, echoing floors. Harry was deaf to the world except for the sound of low gasps and heavy breathing. Wet skin, warm lips, and caving into Malfoy’s inviting body until there was no more space. Every nerve ending alight and burning, thrumming with sparks of emotion too deep and too foreign for him to completely comprehend.
Draco stopped. Frozen. While the world whirled around him; the same sounds, same faces, same everything. Except something deep and dormant within his body rippled, and pulled and swirled—alive with the memories.
issues onto the cluttered top of his desk. A billow of dust circled around them, causing Harry to clear his throat.
Draco stared at a Potter he only recognised in his mind. He spoke to a Potter he only remembered from before they were even eighteen. Now, he sounded different, and he looked different, too. More broad, more square, more sharp. There were lines on his face that he hadn’t seen before, scars that his fingerprints hadn’t learnt about.
The next time Harry saw him, nights had blurred into days, and days stretched into the monotony of weeks. Malfoy walked in with a trail of dirt at his feet, and shivered with the bite of winter and a chatter of teeth.
Harry always thought the victory tasted so much sweeter when it was a fight to get it. A battle of wills. Cat and mouse. A game he refused to back down from. A game he refused to lose.
Draco still refused to meet Harry’s gaze, his teeth clamped tightly together. An ugly sneer curled his lips, and he looked exactly like the spoiled boy Harry had known at Hogwarts. He hated it.
For instance, two months wasn’t enough time to tell Potter how he felt. That pain in his chest each time their eyes would meet, the numbness that surged through his body like the swell of a thunderous ocean. How every time their skin touched, he would float off the ground amongst the sea of stars, painting the sky gold.
“I already said I agreed to your rules. No snogging, no unnecessary groping—unless under extreme circumstances—and no alcohol.”
He opened his eyes, and through the blurriness, the reflection in the mirror hadn’t ebbed. It stared at him, silent and commanding, taunting him of everything he was not. An amalgamation of all his faults wrapped up into one pretty scar of goodness. Because that’s what Potter was. Everything he could never be.
But then it struck Draco, a blinding, electric shard of realisation. It shot through his veins and sent him reeling—he was teetering on the edge, standing on the precipice where the lines of disgust and euphoria blurred until none of them remained, save for that sparking, igniting flame that Harry had been talking about.
“You’re killing yourself,” Malfoy says as he takes the cigarette from my lips and sucks it in between his own. This familiar dance we’ve been toying with sparks a fire within me. We’re teetering on the edge, seconds before slipping—the adrenaline is intoxicating, I want to melt into Malfoy's mouth. His hands. His stare. I’m dripping with the desperate desire, but I stay exactly where I am. Too close to breathe, too far that I might collapse with the need.
It reminded him, with a swooping feeling in his gut, of Malfoy’s fingers curled between the fabric of his jumper. Holding him in place, the soft whisper of his voice.
“It’s not—” he sighed, running his hands through the lengths of his hair. Hermione’s angry mug of tea was making his hair damp. For all Hermione's insistence that Harry practice Mindfulness, it was clear she wasn't doing the best job at it herself. He didn’t dare to tell her that though; he rather liked to keep his bollocks intact. “It’s not about my career, it’s about freedom.”
“Astounding deduction, Sherlock. It's truly no wonder you've become Head Auror.” he gave him a mocking salute.
I hardly care about that anymore. We've all made terrible choices at one point in our lives. That includes Jacques and his family cowardly hiding amongst muggles during the war — but even so, the war should be behind us. It happened and it's all history,” he carded his fingers through Draco's hair. “and for what it's worth, I adore you. Probably too much.”
were projecting,” the retort slipped before he could stop himself. Not the smartest comeback he could think of. He quickly added. “I was just calling you out on it.”
Draco knew deep inside that he was willing to follow Harry blindly, he trusted the man to hold him by the hand and lead him through the dark. Though he remained silent, not trusting words to himself.
Something about the furtiveness of this situation set fire to Harry's blood. The fact that Draco wore his shirt, his knickers were halfway through his calves, and his svelte legs were perched over Harry's shoulders — Harry squeezed at his own hardness.
Draco swallowed and shook his head. “No, Harry, I. . .” he choked on what seemed like a sob with a side of regret as a wave of repressed memories came rushing back to the forefront of his mind, overwhelming him. He couldn't believe he had forgotten.
Draco was positively screaming and sobbing now, nails clawing at his back and without a doubt leaving promiscuous marks on him. Harry didn't mind, he thought, as he looked down at his own marks he made all over Draco. The bed creaked violently and slammed against the wall. And a treacherous part of Harry hoped that
Harry acted the same around Jacques, and Jacques around Harry. He was friendly, casual and especially chipper. None of tense awkwardness Draco dreaded to see. He felt relieved, if only for  short time. Draco saw the glacial stare Harry threw everytime Jacques turned his back. Draco didn't miss the empty look in Jacques eyes as his gaze flitted back and forth between him and Harry.
“Trust me, Potter. It's not something someone like you would be interested in. Don't bother yourself.”
In one swift movement, Harry had Draco perched on top of the kitchen counter, his warm hands sneaking under his shirt and roaming his back. The cold surface biting the bare skin of his thighs, reminding him that he was wearing nothing other than a shirt and his underwear. Harry pulled away first.
Potter stood up and walked towards Draco on the study desk, and as he moved closer, he became slightly more disjointed.
In the distance, two floating candles flickered and pulsed into a soft, illuminating glow. And it was enough to alight an entire sky within Draco’s eyes.
Light blue paint spread and dripped down the white walls surrounding them as plush moss sprouted and covered the glossy floor. Tiny blue flowers with bright, yellow centres bloomed around their feet, and the room was permeated with the soft scent of fresh grass and open air. The soothing pitter-patter of water trickled behind them, and Harry whipped around to see a large waterfall meet the lazy ebb and flow of a lake.
He couldn’t be serious. That was a sure-fire boner killer if he ever heard one. More than dear Aunt Marge in lace pantyhose.
It was fine, though, Draco could do with the memories. Even if those memories were only ever fantasies.
He soared towards the gold as if Draco were the Snitch. But Harry thought the Golden Snitch couldn’t possibly compare to Draco.
“Then, let’s live right now like we’ve only got forever.” He whispered, and in that moment, time seemed to slow down like the blurry seconds between slumber and consciousness. Between illusion and reality. Between a crumbling world, and one that had been stitched back together again. Because at that moment, Draco finally knew what it felt like to kiss Potter.
and all those other reporters can fuck off with their homophobic bullshit, but you aren’t doing anything by locking your little gay self up in a dirty bathroom, are you?”
Harry swallowed as a wave of heat bloomed against his cheeks, the skin at the nape of his neck suddenly sweaty.
Harry glanced at Malfoy, whose gaze was locked heavily on each one of their photos. His jaw was set tight, something playing in the darkness of his eyes, but Deverill’s hard voice made Malfoy’s head snap up before Harry could pick apart Malfoy’s expression.
The Quidditch pitch was a world of noise. The stadium, full to capacity, had reporters standing on every corner, their Quick-Quotes Quills held at attention and their cameras aimed at the sky. This was the first game between
“Then show me, Draco. Touch me like you mean it. You have me now.” Harry grabbed Draco’s hands, clasping them together as he guided them on a leisurely journey across Harry's body. Down the shapes of his abdomen, curling around each pull of his shifting muscles. Nails biting into hips, crescent moons finding home in his skin.
Harry tried to make a sound of protest, but it was muffled against the piece of material that he was currently swallowing. So instead, he stood awkwardly, with his elbows raised above his head as he stared inside the drowning depths of red cotton, and felt the sudden presence of Malfoy standing in front of him.
Behind him, the tap continued to gurgle, the sound of splattering water pounding against steel. Loud and deafening. He flicked his hand and the water shut off with a strangled swallow. Silence consumed the room as Harry stared at Malfoy, the only sound to break the stillness was the echo of stray water droplets. A constant rhythm against steel; a countdown.
But then, Malfoy began to close the distance between them, one slow step at a time. Harry tried to keep his eyes trained on the glossy floor.
“For as long as I’ve been alive, I’ve never once had an ounce of control. But these tattoos, these marks, they’re all mine. My choice, my decision. Every line of ink heals the scars that bleed from within.”
It was insanity. It was breathtaking. The beginning of a fleeting forever. Of fingerprints on warm skin in a world that was no longer crumbling.
And then, as the sun bounced off the mirror like a spotlight, Draco was left leering at the wretched state of himself. His reflection smiled at him, cruel and mocking, and this time, there were no green sparkling eyes he could get lost in. Just the sticky residue of his fingerprints painting the mirror in all the wrong places.
“Come for another chat, have we?” he tried to joke, but his voice came out in lungfuls of gasps, and breathing sent stinging shocks all down his nerves. To stop breathing, though, seemed counter-intuitive, so Draco tried to force all the air out of his nose instead.
the rest of his clothes as Harry sat in his bed, hunched over his knees, the silence driving a wedge further between them.
You don’t realise until after it collapses and you’re left standing—soiled in sweat—wondering how much can go wrong before the sweet breath of a cigarette teases your tongue.
This place looked more fitting as one of the floors up at St. Mungo’s than it did as a photography studio. Harry frowned. “I expected a line up of half-naked witches. This looks...
Their flying styles truly couldn't have been more different. Malfoy had such precision in the air, as if every small movement was calculated and evaluated seconds before he danced in tandem with the sky. He was a showman, a performer.
Like the very match that had started it all, this was more than a game. And this time, Harry had something to prove. He was more than a stupid sex scandal fabricated by the masses. He was more than a hot-headed player ‘trying to seduce the other team’s seeker’. This was his livelihood, his passion. He was going to show it—and beat Malfoy to a pulp in the process.
A sudden glint caught Harry’s eye, then, like a spotlight—something small and stark against the dark wood floors. Harry stood up, blood rushing to the tight muscles in his legs as he walked towards the door. There, lying innocently on the floor, was a broken Snitch wing.
Deverill sat back in his chair, his hands clasped over his stomach. “I’ve already told you, Harry, I don’t
The wings from the broken Snitch wanted desperately to be whole again. Harry though, standing within the emptiness of his bedroom, felt raw and incomplete. Cut open.
They were so close. So unbearably close. Potter’s fringe fanned across Draco’s forehead and he could see every single mark, mole and freckle that splattered his face as if he were really there. Draco pressed into his warmth, their foreheads touched, and Potter’s lightning bolt scar—the one of goodness and everything Draco could never be—met the scars his eye couldn’t see.
Only Malfoy. The way he looked, and the way he smelt, and the way his eyes spoke the words his lips never did. The way Harry had somehow come to understand his silent conversations.
Draco sat up from his lying position to follow him, arching into his sway. His hands tangled in between the fabric of Harry’s shirt, he coaxed Harry’s arms, lifting up, up, up, until it was over his head and discarded on the grass.
“Would that be such a bad thing?” Harry strummed his fingers along the short hairs at Draco’s nape, tilted his head, until Draco was left staring at the blood red eyes of his biggest mistake.
He felt the outline of a broken wing in the pocket of his jeans, digging into his hip bone. The weight of it—although feather light—was anchoring. He didn’t know why he had put so much importance into it, or why he even kept it, because it was half of the reason he was in this situation in the first place.
Harry looked inside the envelope again, but there was still no sign of the photos that Apolline had mentioned in her letter. He couldn’t help the slight twinge that grew in his chest as he read over the letter for the second time. Harry hadn’t known what to expect upon receiving the owl, but he did at least expect to see a couple of photographs, and he couldn’t decipher whether the feeling swirling in his gut was just nervousness or disappointment.
Malfoy made a sound that sent Harry’s body on fire, and then Malfoy was on him again. Biting at his lips, licking a slow pattern down his neck. Harry groaned as he felt their thighs slot together. This was a bliss he’d never felt before; his blood thrummed with want, his body purled with desire. His mind was a stuttering mess that could only respond to Malfoy’s touch, his voice. The feeling of wet skin sliding against skin.
or the entire stadium erupting into speculative whispers. His mind was whirring, spiralling, descending into a familiar state of manic senses in overdrive.
Perhaps, if he were that little bit closer, Potter would do it again, and he’d be able to feel exactly how it sounded against his cheek. The way his breath might stutter, a slight hitch. Or how his laugh would caress his skin in an unattainable warmth. Perhaps, if he were that little bit closer, he’d be able to feel the ghost of his lips against his.
He sighed, and Draco felt the air escape his own lungs. “This isn’t real, Malfoy, you know that, right?”
“What a load of shite, when yours is the definition of all that is right. Don’t you dare try and compare our past. We’re nothing alike.”
There was a thunderous clamour as Harry’s palms hit wood. The entire room held their breath as Harry stood up, his hands flat and heavy on the table as he tried to stabilise himself. The soft flesh of his palm stung and burned from the impact, and he clenched his fingers into fists to will it away.
Gold in the distance. A sparkle. A glimmer in the air. So small that if he blinked or lost focus for just a second, he would have missed it and forfeited his chance of winning.
“I don’t know.” Draco ran his hand across the table, feeling the grains of wood underneath the pads of his fingers. “I suppose I wanted to hear another voice.”
What part of that don’t you understand?” Her hands were clasped around her hot mug of tea. The steam drew patterns in the air and swirled through the frizzy ends of her curls.
First, Draco caught green eyes. Then, the expanse of the Great Hall unravelled before him. An echo of clinking cutlery and children’s laughter filled the silence of the room; Draco sat engulfed by it all in the Headmaster’s chair.
Draco turned around to face Potter, the tips of their shoes touched, and Draco’s body was already thrumming. “No, that’s not what I need.” Potter’s breath tickled his cheek and Draco swayed into his current. Their shoulders brushed for an entire second, Potter said nothing. “Why do you only come at night?” Draco asked for the third time, hoping for a different answer.
Draco swallowed thickly. “This whole time… you were wearing my robes.” He shook his head, but his eyes never left Harry’s body.
Slowly, Harry ran his thumb underneath the seal, and pulled out a piece of parchment paper. The crinkling sound as he unfolded the letter echoed loudly in his ears.
“May the best team win,” Malfoy said as Oliver and Flint shook hands. And at that moment, Harry was brought back to Hogwarts. To childhood innocence and betting everything on the House Cup. Gryffindor versus Slytherin. Right versus Wrong. Him versus the World. Even though it had been a couple of years since he had left Hogwarts, the memories were still startling. Flying was the only reprieve he’d ever had from the horrors of his childhood, and in a way, he always thought that this freedom was the reason he got into Professional Quidditch in the first place, instead of the Aurors like everyone expected.
He snaked one arm around Malfoy’s waist, and with the other, held his palm around his jaw, coaxing Malfoy's head out of the crook of Harry’s neck. Malfoy’s eyes were dark and half-lidded, the colour of coal. His movements were slow, languid, and Harry’s breath caught in his throat as he stared at Malfoy. The way the fluorescent lights in the studio painted his face in a wash of shadow and light. The shape of his nose, the way wet strands of gold hair stuck to his cheeks, water droplets running down his face and into the sharp hollow of his collarbone.
He tipped his head back as he sighed, trying to fill the lasting silence that permeated the room. Maybe if he sighed loud enough, it would drown out the ringing sound of the door shutting behind Draco.
“That’s fucked! What the fuck is wrong with you, Deverill?” Harry shouted as he snapped his head to his coach. “I’m not ashamed of my sexuality; I don’t need to pose shirtless next to some witch just so the Wizarding World can preserve the ‘straightness’ of their precious ‘Boy Who Lived.’ I’ll get Hermione to write up a statement, say that we’ve never shagged
Harry!” Draco yelled into his ear, but Harry only smiled as he wound his arm around Draco’s waist, pointing his own broom towards the ground. “You’re a cheat!”
Draco wore the growth of five years well on his skin. Faint age lines peaked around the edges of his eyes, marking a long journey of time and change along his face. Skin cured like a clay sculpture, permanent fingerprints etched between the scars of his past, a reminder of how far he had come. A reminder of all the life he still had yet to live.
Draco. Draco. Draco. His smell, his taste, the way his body moved against Harry's, slow and relaxed, silky smooth. His voice, a pool of velvet that sunk into the very fibre of Harry's being, filling him up with molten heat until he was all Draco’s.
In the burning light of Draco’s stare, Harry couldn’t begin to decipher Draco’s emotions. Draco felt deadly. Dangerous in the most thrilling way possible. Harry’s hunger for him was that of a dying man desperately clinging onto his final breath—filling up his lungs, tasting its sweetness in his mouth, cold air on warm tongue—
Because he did, indeed, face a few problems head on. It was just done very quickly. Eyes shut tight, mind eerily blank, palm slipping against the cold tiles of his shower. And when he watched his shame wash down the drain in mocking patterns, he fought that lick of pleasure, the thrill that overcame his body in the slow blurry moments of his afterglow.
“Mr. Malfoy, what are your thoughts about Harry Potter risking his life to save yours, back in July’s game?”
“Potter—” Malfoy began, in a low, soft murmur, his tone of voice so foreign to Harry he couldn’t help but snap his head to his gaze. “—if you truly had a problem with your sexuality then you wouldn’t have been all over those blokes at
Beside him, he heard Draco sigh—soft, barely a hitch of his breath. “You don’t remember when they outed me, do you?”
He wanted to fight. To punch Malfoy, break his nose. He wanted more than anything to lash out, to release the tension that coiled through his limbs like a spring. To soothe the growing magma in his belly, the one that bubbled and purled and wouldn’t simmer down until he had his hands pulling at the git’s stupidly styled hair.
Harry didn’t wait for an apology because he didn’t think Malfoy could bring himself to say it out loud. He shook his head again as he walked over to the bathroom door, fist clasped around the cold handle. He glanced back at Malfoy, met the other man’s gaze, and spoke his next words low. The room was so quiet, the moment so strained, that he knew Malfoy understood every word.
He had succumbed to the bittersweet bliss of oblivion, and the only thing he could remember was his willingness to forget, and the smell of blood red wine on the tip of forbidden lips.
“Now, tell me, Deverill, ‘cause I think I’ve missed something here,” he began, trying to steady his breathing and
And then, the door opened and they were shoved out, the sound of it slamming shut behind them echoed with finality.
Quidditch robes curve around Malfoy’s every sharp line and muscle. His head tips back and I drink the bead of sweat slipping down his throat with my eyes. Silver flickers to green, a glass of Butterbeer between blush-pink lips.
I refuse to give into him, but with every one of his piercing smirks I feel my inhibitions wither. I want him, and Malfoy knows, and yet we both pretend this is nothing more than the thrill of seeing the other person break.
Harry in so many ways, way more than what those gorgeous bottle-green eyes were offering him. And it wasn’t fair for Harry because he could never understand, nor would he need him just as much as Draco.
He shut his mouth again, and Harry’s smile widened. “You’re not very eloquent after sex, are you?” Harry’s eyes glinted as he watched Draco’s ears turn red.
With no other place to put his hands, Draco grabbed Harry’s waist. As they fell, his grip grew tighter, as did the pressure he used to keep his thighs clamped around Harry’s. He yelled, “You’re going to be disqualified for this!”
felt his fingers meet the soft strands of Malfoy’s hair, right at his temple. He brushed his hand through it, and Malfoy...
“It’s got nothing to do with that.” Harry drummed his fingers along the side of the chair. “Tell me, why are you still here?”
But most of all, it was morning. The early sun misted their skin; a slow warmth that soothed the ache in his chest that called out to a man he thought he'd never see again.
Harry shoved his hands into the pockets of his jeans and looked up, only to find that intense grey stare drilling into him as Malfoy brushed the unbuttoned shirt off his shoulders, so slowly Harry was almost sure Malfoy was doing it on purpose. He watched with bated breath as the soft material hit the floor and pooled at Malfoy’s feet.
“Are you right with your t-shirt, Potter, or do you need help with that, too?” Malfoy murmured as he handed Harry his glasses.
People were talking as if Harry hadn’t been drunk off his tits. As if he remembered anything besides the blur of movement. Of heat. Of bodies up against bodies.
The voice was a low murmur, but the room was so silent that it swallowed him whole. He knew that voice, each note, breath, and rhyme. The timbre washed over him like warmth that cradled and dipped between the notches of his spine. So despite himself, despite his will screaming for defiance—he turned around, gaze locked with the only man whose liquid green eyes could make him drown.
Lights flashed in his eyes as bodies blurred together; moving silhouettes and burning skin. The musky smell of sweat and desire thickened the room and sent him spiralling. He hated it. He hated this. But he was barely two more drinks away from forgetting just how much it made his skin crawl, so he swallowed down the thrill of liquor into absolute bliss and oblivion.
“I don’t recall that being a part of the deal, Potter,” Malfoy drawls, but his voice catches, stutters around my name.
“Answer the question.” Harry’s face broke into a grin, his cheeks hurt from it, but he smiled wider still. “Heads or Tails?”
His heart stuttered in its pulsing rhythm, trying to keep up with the rough inhales of air he did not yet have. Blood and adrenaline shot through him, alighting every nerve ending like the thrill of liquored lips, and he basked in it, eyes shut as his senses fueled on overdrive. Ozone and sweat. The hot pellets of rain against his skin. Hard blades of grass and mud underneath his back. The deafening crowd all around him. The soft—almost comforting—sensation of the Snitch’s feathers between his calloused hands.
He spoke slowly, and Harry couldn’t tell whether he was angry enough to kick him off the team, or just tired of dealing with the messes he had started to create every Monday morning. The number of old newspapers that had been in his bin only moments ago didn’t give Harry much hope.
The first person to speak up, Harry recognised instantly as that damned secretary of Skeeter’s. He fought against himself to stay quiet and not spit something he’d later regret.
“You already know the answer.” My voice is raspy, and Malfoy caves under the sound. I see it in the way he parts his lips, his eyes fluttering closed, a slip of silver against dilated pupils. It sends a shiver down my spine, and I take another draw, breathe in, breathe out.
That’s how it started anyway—before Malfoy opened his stupid mouth—with Harry trying to bargain his freedom to anyone who’d listen. The first time one of those articles ran, he had marched right into the
the newspaper and drank up the last few seconds of ignorant bliss before his world would come crashing down around him.
When he was sober, Harry often questioned how he had let himself come to this, but just as often, the answer dissolved into the sweet taste of tequila flavoured lip gloss, a heavy hand pulling at his hair, and another victory against Malfoy in the palm of his hands.
“Are you not willingly sitting here after curfew, boy? If you were to be found, the sound of your last name will not save you much from the hands of the Carrows.”
The reporter’s words barked in his ears, nipped at the sensitive spot in the back of his mind. It repeated, over and over and over again, until it was so loud and so consuming that it drowned out the sound of his own voice, which was a shattered, broken whisper against the clattering crescendo of vitriol. He crumbled with it, the weight. Back arched low to the cold and dirty steel.
Malfoy shrugged one shoulder, a game playing in the smirk of his lips. “I suppose you’ll never really know.” He stood up then, and brushed the stray dust off his clothes, turning to face Harry. “As riveting as this has been, I have to cut this short. Potter and I have some private matters to attend to.”
The owl bent its head to the parchment lying on the bench, and its beak tapped impatiently—much like it did on the window—to the neat monogram written at the end of the letter, exactly like the one on the front of the envelope.
The whistle blew, and finally, Harry kicked off the ground and spiralled up into the beckoning light, the last exhalation of breath dripping off his lips and tangling with the wind.
Malfoy’s teeth nipped at the skin on Harry’s neck, as if he either didn’t care or had completely forgotten that they weren’t alone. He licked a slow stripe up the tendons on Harry's neck, sucking on it between soft, plush lips.
