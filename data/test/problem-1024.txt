“So the trace spell still wont work. We have no way of studying the body to gauge how he died or what killed him and there is no way to know if the partially dug up hole has anything to do with the crime.” Hermione let out an exasperated laugh that made her sound like she was a mad scientist whose experiment failed…again. “That’s just, well, that’s bad, Harry. It’s pretty bad.”
Malfoy nodded at him. He was still wearing his ‘thinking face’ when he said, “Right.”
“Then there was Luis something or other. He was also not my type.” Draco laughed, and Merlin, it was a good laugh.
I hesitated a moment before lowering my hands. He released his grip. I felt drained from the effort it took to stop trying to attack. My voice came out weak and hoarse. “Ron?”
The Succubus loosened her grip on Harry’s neck. “Wizards aren’t trustworthy.”
“We should check out the mausoleums. It will be night soon. No telling when the creature will be back or when the potion wears off.” Draco hoped against hope that Potter couldn’t hear the arousal in his voice.
Draco’s family status was once rivaled by none, but had been greatly de-escalated after the war—his finances gone, his titles removed. And if not for Mr. Potter speaking at his trial, Draco would surely be rotting in a cell.
Up until now, Harry had not looked into Malfoy’s eyes. It was easier if he didn’t because Malfoy did have a very intense stare and Harry was sure the prat would use it to his advantage. So, in an effort to avoid eye contact further, Harry leaned his head in to whisper something into Malfoy’s right ear.
—Though I assume you are often right, so it does not surprise you any longer.” Mr. Potter leaned in to whisper. Draco felt Mr. Potter’s breath on his skin and it felt like the first rays of sunlight in the summer. He wanted to bask in it for an eternity.
“Well? Last night, you just up and left without a word. Why?”
“I was searching for you, Father,” Draco supplied the lie quickly. He had really come to see what sort of night he was in store for. The arrangement of the room often told him all he needed to know. For instance, if there was a long table adorned with their finest ivory colored clothes, it would be a delegation dinner, but if the table was smaller and the room was dimly lit, the meeting would be more intimate and therefore be less about business.
After Luna walked back to Potter and the rest, her words played over in his mind as he stood there at the edge of the party. He tried to distract himself from the nagging feeling that he was making a huge mistake by even showing up at the party, let alone staying. If his encounter with Potter taught him anything it was that the rule he made at the beginning of the year to avoid everyone at all costs was a good rule and he never should have broken it in the first place when Potter asked to be his Potions partner and especially not now by coming to this party.
I had about two minutes to collect myself before Hermione was shoving me on a small stage in front of a sea of Hogwarts students, their families, people from Hogsmeade, and who knows how many other people came in from London.
, or so he’d been told on countless occasions by countless powerful wizards—all of which he had charmed into bed in service of the Dark Lord’s agenda.
“Now you love me?” Draco asked, his face unreadable.
The arrogance of it made Draco smile cruelly. What Potter didn’t know was Weasel had already talked and Granger wouldn’t be far behind. Instead, of telling him this, Draco decided to let Potter keep a bit of his pathetic hope. If only so Draco could watch it rot alongside Potter in that room. “Someone will talk, Potter. And it might even be you. This spunk of yours will burn out fast like kindling in a fireplace. I will stamp you out, do you understand?”
Yet, just as he was about to close his fingers around the snitch and feel the rush of victory pulse through his body, Draco soared in from the left, grunting resolutely, and snatched it out of sight before Harry could.
“I’m sorry, Charlie.”
“Merlin, if anyone could, it would be her,” Ron said with a shiver. He ran his hands over his arms. “What an image.”
Lucius seemed to consider Draco before continuing. A soft smile took up residence where usually a scowl was present. “Where were you last night after showing Nikola the cellar?”
“You are quite beautiful, did you know?” Harry said and it wasn’t to win the bet. He wasn’t trying to elect a response. In fact, he couldn’t believe he had actually let those word slip out of his mouth. But they did and as Harry said them, he realized how true the words were.
“Merlin, I thought Granger was kidding when she said you Muggle-raised sometimes forget to use magic since you grew up without it.”
“Too much, I guess.” I took a deep breath and told them about the visions and the dreams. About the man in the forest. About seeing my mother. And finally about the beast with no face.
Malfoy let out a deep sigh. He looked around again and I didn’t like the look on his face. “I suppose I underestimated my own feelings and overestimated yours.”
Everyone watched excitedly. Potter smiled at Draco and answered, “Let’s do it then.”
I was in the forest looking at a man hunched over in front of the giant rock. There was black ooze everywhere. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I touched them. It felt so real. But I’d just been in my living room, hadn’t I?
On his way to the dining room, Draco took the path that brought him past his mother’s portrait. It hung, life-sized in the foyer. For the last month, Draco avoided it. He took any path through the Manor that avoided the hall where she hung, even the tediously long ones.
Suddenly, he felt silly in his full quidditch kit. Silly, and uncomfortably hot. Terribly, uncomfortably hot. Hot in places that he would rather not be hot in, not when he was still under the intensity of Draco’s gaze. Though he suspected the hotness which had devoured his body had more to do with what Draco looked like in those shorts and less to do with the weather.
“I’ve always been wise,” Ginny whispered into his ear and then pulled out of the hug. She stood up and straightened her forget-me-not blue peacoat, extending her hand to pull him off the bench.
“What?”
He had duties to attend to for
“So confident, in fact, that you felt the need to point out my earlier response was not up to your conversational standards.” Draco paused in order to take in the mischievous smile on Mr. Potter’s face. Then after a pregnant silence, he finished his thought. “I do wish to please you in this manner, Mr. Potter; however, I have so little knowledge of what does the trick as you and I do not often have occasion to speak.”
“What makes you think I need your help?”
Harry nodded. “Were you here when Hermione told the story about the fires?”
“Sorry, again.”
He smiled but it stoped before it reached his eyes. “Sexually, right?”
I raised my gaze to meet Malfoy’s. “How long will it last?”
Most recently, they had the distinct misfortune of discussing Draco’s feelings in regard to Mr. Potter in the hours leading up to this very ball. Pansy was eager in her questioning. Her natural curiosity mixed with her own boredom was a devious pairing that often left Draco feeling exposed no matter how many times he assured her of his complete indifference to Mr. Potter.
. “Just shut it and look for the stupid plants.”
“Ye—yes,” Draco stammered. Merlin, this man would be the death of him one way or the other. He was throwing Draco’s own words back at him.
“Course not.”
“Daisy,” Draco said into the empty room and then there was a pop at his side and Daisy appeared. Her tea towel dress was covered in flour, no doubt from baking the scones he saw near his tea cup.
“You were once like us, weren’t you? Magic allowed you to become this in the first place, why couldn’t it also help keep you that way? You were already trying a spell yourself, a spell to bind your soul energy to this nexus, right? I’m positive with some creative casting, I can manage it.”
Standing abruptly, Draco shoved Potter backwards impulsively. He watched as Potter hit the wall hard enough to knock his breath from him. He sat there a moment, chest heaving, and then said, “You’re a monster. I used to think you were a coward, but now I know you’re a monster. You like this don’t you?”
Draco shook his head, grabbed Harry by the elbow and tugged. “Nope, we’re going to drink it all and the cups will just slow us down. Come on.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “I guess so.”
“Potter, are you losing focus on me now? I’m practically nude,” Draco demanded, his voice cutting through Harry’s thoughts. He sat there, perfect and pale, looking like a dream. There was a look of tired amusement on his face. “You spaced out? I’m in my pants and you space out? How flattering.”
When the lights flicked back on, I was staring in mirror at my mother’s reflection. Her auburn hair flowing around her as if she were underwater. Her eyes were black orbs and a dark ooze flowed out of her mouth. It was just like the dead man in the cemetery. I swirled around but there was nothing behind me and when I looked at the mirror again, she was gone.
Granger was a possibility. She wore a floor length blue dress. It was a shiny slip covered by a lace outer layer. It was elegant and he was sure Granger knew how to properly launder clothes.
I looked around the shop. We seemed to be alone, but that was not a guarantee in the wizarding world. I knew all too well how easy it was to conceal yourself and eavesdrop. I did my fair share of listening in growing up, and up until I got stuck on desk duty, I got paid to do it. There were at least five legal concealment spells and about a dozen illegal ones. That’s not to say any spells or potions the Unspeakables used and never had to tell the DMLE about since they work outside of the laws.
“I don't like parties, Luna. I already explained it to you yesterday when you invited me.”
Draco glanced around some more, ignoring the few students who were shouting about the ghost who just walked off the deck. There was a table that someone had transfigured where the booze sat. It was a menagerie of half filled bottles, likely stolen and snuck into school from their parents homes.
“There’s still some stuff we need to discuss.” Malfoy looked at him now, his smoke-grey eyes bloodshot. “Like, are we simply going to do recon?”
“Are you okay?” she asked, pushing into the bathroom with me and locking the door behind her. She didn’t wait for an answer before she was holding my head in her hands and looking at my eyes.
He didn’t look for Draco. He focused on the snitch. And when he stretched out his right hand, he did not anticipat any interference.
“Goyle failed again. The Dark Lord removed an arm as punishment. Though I can’t say I am surprised. That is what happens when a brute is sent to do the job of a diplomat.”
I shook my head. “No like a specific person. The man sobbing in front of the rock. I almost reached him this time. I just knew I was supposed to get to him, but he is always just out of reach.”
and really loved her characterization of Thad Greystone. She choked on her cucumber sandwich.”
The back room of the shop looked much the same as the front of the shop. All wooden fixtures. Candles in sconces. Book shelves that went to the ceiling lined one wall. A work table lined another. There were vials and potions brewing in cauldrons. Parchment was spread across every free space of the room.
After the first sighting, Harry positioned himself back in the corner of the pitch. This strategy always worked when he played, so he saw no reason to switch it up now. Draco kept moving like a madman. It was hard to keep his eyes searching for the snitch, especially when Draco zipped past him and Harry would catch a whiff Draco—sweat mixed with something earthy like rain, though rain hadn’t fallen in over a week.
“You actually showed up?”
“Next week is good. I’ll owl with my schedule and we can set something up, yeah?” The excitement in her voice was apparent.
Harry and Draco run through the Forbidden Forest and find someone unexpected.
“Don’t put in the transfer yet,” Harry said. “Let me talk to him.” He turned around and pulled a handful of Floo powder out of the sachet next to the fireplace. He tossed it in and the flames roared to life.
Fiddling with the edge of the pastel yellow tablecloth, Harry asked skeptically, “And you’re sure the Prophet will print it?”
“This thing doesn’t seem to be sophisticated. The first few kills were spread out by a week, but it seems to be devolving, killing the last two nights in a row. It’s picking high risk targets, barely making an effort to spread out its hunting grounds, and yet… it’s extremely powerful, and as we recently learned, it can deflect certain spells, but fire seems to affect it, or at least piss it off.”
It was terrifying how he only sat there, very still, smiling. His lips curled up at the corners like he was pleased to be challenged in such a manner, or it meant that he was considering killing Nikola. “Don’t be such a killjoy, Lucius. I am sure your boy is up to taking Nikola on a tour of the cellar. Aren’t you Draco?”
I was almost about to say ‘I knew,’ but then Ginny and her date appeared at the front door. Dean was ushering them inside. Her hair was shorter than the last time I saw her. Bobbing just above her shoulders. It made her look older, more mature. Her hand was interlaced with a woman’s, whose back was turned. I could see short cropped jet black hair. She turned around and I recognized Ginny’s date. Pansy Parkinson, author of all those romance novels I read and Malfoy’s best friend. Great. As if today needed anymore surprises.
“That’s something we need to figure out before it kills again. If it holds to its pattern, we can expect it to find a new victim tonight. Every previous victim was estimated to have died at or very near 3 a.m., so we’re on a clock, people. We can’t afford to mess this up.”
“We need Malfoy,” Ron admitted. “I sort of hoped we didn’t need him. Is that terrible?”
your vision or whatever, we voted, and so, you lost. You get to ask Malfoy for the potion.”
A laugh, thick and warm like honey, bubbled out of Potter. Soft and understanding. Draco wrung his hands for something to do other than take off at a sprint for the exit. This was the most unsettled he’d felt in quite a while.
“And?”
“I—Mr. Potter, surely we should go inside.”
Without another word, Ron cast a perimeter spell to see if anyone else was still in the cemetery. It came back negative, lighting up red.
A smile crept it’s way across Draco’s face as he looked down at the crown of jet black hair in front of him. He loved it when Potter was like this. Indignant like a lightening bolt trapped in a mason jar. It was when he was like this that Draco found him irresistible, so he played with Potter like a child plays with their food.
“Whatever do you mean?” Draco said in his best innocent voice, trying to mask his repulsion with himself, as he scrubbed the last bit of blood from his knuckle. He watched as it was soaked up, dying what was left of the ivory color a bright red. Briefly, Granger’s bloody face flashed through his mind. Her eyes shut. Her cheek busted open.
Without prompting, Draco continued his train of thought. “Or say I kiss you, and you feel something and I don’t? Disastrous. Therefore, it’s better to leave it alone. Isn’t it?”
“A little.” Hermione smiled softly. “He’s
Malfoy clenched his jaw. “Take my energy instead. Let them both go, kill me instead.” He dropped his wand hand to his side. “You still get what you need. I won’t fight you if you let them go.”
Both Hermione and Malfoy looked pleased. They shared a glance that seemed to say ‘this is amazing’ before Malfoy held up his wand. “I’m going to cast a lumos, tell me if you see the traces once I put it out. Lumos.” Malfoy’s wand lit up bright and then he said, “Nox.”
They’d made it over holding hands. The thought made Harry’s stomach flutter.
“Pans, we can sign waiver M-78, relieving you of all liability if the potion has unexpected effects. Not that there will be any. We all know your potion brewing is second to none. It will be fine. We need to stop this thing soon, before more people get hurt.”
“No, I feel the same way,” Harry complained, his head still hanging back to look at the sky and the floating embers. “It’s a silly festival based on old traditions and a myth about two lovers that probably never existed. And if they did, their love story was nowhere near as sappy and happy-go-lucky as this. You’re telling me they were happy to only see each other once a year? That lighting bonfires in unique formations honours them, and jumping over smaller ones is good luck? Please. It makes a good story. That’s it.”
“Right. Thanks, Malfoy. For, you know, all of it.”
“I’m sure he will be flattered that you’re interested, but he just started dating Draco,” Neville said. He shrugged apologetically and then placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder.
She was frowning at me when I finally looked at her. “Maybe. Either way, I am still here and I want to report this story. It’s the biggest one since Voldemort and I want it.”
Pansy scoffed, and said at the same time, “No way. I’m not going to be responsible if you grow a third ear or hump a lamppost because I gave you an unfinished potion.”
Potter was much more drunk than
Harry still gave no answer. It wasn’t as if he were trying to be rude. It was simply that he had no idea what he was doing. Well, he knew he was attempting to touch Malfoy’s face, but the rest of him hadn’t quite caught up to the why part yet.
Ever since their capture, Potter and his friends had been impossible, but Potter especially so. He constantly refused to eat. Leaving food on his trays to rot. Often, he would refuse to let Draco cast a cleaning spell on him to freshen up his clothes. And even more often, Draco would be welcomed by Potter spitting in his face.
Ron took the lead and began explaining about the screams we heard and how we rushed over but the man was already dead. Robards listened attentively, occasionally tearing his eyes away from Ron to give me a look.
“You Gryffindor’s need to work on your repertoire of insults. Yes, yes. I am a coward, I am a tosser, blah, blah, blah. My feelings are so hurt.”
Draco knitted his brow and peered over Harry’s shoulder to see if anyone else would be coming through with him, but the flames turned bright orange again. “Uh, hi?”
“Someone is here.” It was Kreacher. He apparated in right behind me, the shit. I freed him ages ago, but he refused to leave. He said it gave him joy to serve the house, so I said he could stay. Now the fucker sneaks up on me all the time, snickering when he gets me to jump.
The leather seat squeaked as Harry slid off and positioned himself between Draco’s legs. He dragged his hands slowly up Draco’s thighs, stopping at the waistband.
“That’s sort of how love goes, though, isn’t it?” Ginny said in a perfect impersonation of Luna whenever she brought up Nargals, or some other creature Harry had never heard of until that moment.
“Whatever,” Robards said as he steadied his wand and pointed it between us and at a tree at the forest line. “Now back away and let me cast these spells before Reed and Lamont get back with the Unspeakables.”
A man lay on his side near a recently disturbed grave. There was a gash across his chest. Dark blood stained his jumper. It was the caretaker for the cemetery, my only lead. His skin was pale and there were purple bags under his eyes. One bloody handprint marred the otherwise clean tombstone of the vandalized grave. It almost looked human, except for the elongated fingers. It reminded me more of a Dementor. Those boney death ghouls. I grabbed for my wand in my thigh holster, even though I didn’t need it to cast a Patronus.
There was no response, but Lamont must have shook his head because she continued. “We chased down a few of the Death Eaters leftover after, well you know. He didn’t use a spell, a charm, nothing. He walked right up to the guy and sucker punched him. I swear he was smiling when he beat the guy until he was unconscious. So, I’m not surprised he lost it again.”
,” Harry shouted, aiming at the back of the raven-haired woman. It hit her in one angry red flare, but then it bounced off her, ricocheting off the brick wall opposite them, and then fizzling out all together.
“Yes.”
Kharkov hummed to herself. “That is all they will see of you,” she said nodding at the crowd of students.
“Well, then you simply forgot the meeting?”
Harry sat down next to Ron on the couch. The common room was packed full of students, all laughing and dancing and drinking. It felt uncanny to hear so much joy around him so soon after the war. Harry wondered if he was the only one still unsteady, or if there was something wrong with him like he always feared. He thought about it whenever he had a moment to himself. It had always been something he expected to go away once he beat Voldemort for once and for all, but it was still there, like a rock in his shoe. This feeling like something was off, missing, out of place.
Angela smiled one of those awkward half-smiles that said, ‘I’m uncomfortable, but I’m trying hard not to be rude,’ then handed them an old-fashioned silver mirror. The glass on it was tarnished with age and cracked in places, but the silver looked polished. It had intricate filigree details on it that made Harry want to know who’d owned it. Probably someone rich like Malfoy.
. Robards coughed to quiet them. “It’s all hands on deck now. We need to track this thing down. If we can find it, catch it unawares, then we stand a chance at apprehending it. Use your Lock Box to trap it until it can be dealt with by the Unspeakables. I know it’s a relatively new charm box, but it’s been tested in the field and the extension charm inside the box is about the size of a cell.” Robards kept talking while a few of the Aurors in the room skimmed the file, Ron among them. “That being said, Ada Holcomb, the woman who died last night, her death is on us. All of them are, really, so let’s make sure no one else dies. Don’t try to be a hero. Call for backup.”
“Not really, no,” he admitted, shocking himself. He blamed the potion because it picked that moment to make him notice the sharp angle of Malfoy’s jaw and the pale slope of his neck that Harry wanted to drag his lips across. He had to swallow the groan that threatened to rise up out of him.
Lamont nodded. “Good idea, sir.”
It seemed so right, that Harry couldn’t understand how he hadn’t put it all together already. Luna and Ginny, of course that made sense. He felt his heart swell with warmth at the thought, “Luna, I think that’s wonderful and you should tell her. I think she might feel the same way.”
“Harry, you are a wonderful wizard,” Ginny said, dropping her hands and sighing deeply before continuing, “but you are also imperfect, and so is he. Don’t let your pride, or fear of judgement keep you from something you so clearly want.”
Potter grabbed Draco by the arm, pulling him around to face him. Draco expected the arousal this time, but that didn’t take away from the intensity of the touch. Potter squeezed hard once, then pulled his hand back flexing his fingers like they were sore as he did. “Can we walk at a normal pace, so I can explain myself?”
The cemetery was a half a mile from where the Portkey dropped them, so after Harry caught his breath, he started to walk towards the sidewalk where people bustled about their day. Many carried umbrellas with them since it was scheduled to storm again in the evening.
from someone who’s been here.” She waived a hand as if it was no trouble locating my fidelus charm protected address.
“Of course,” Draco said, his head tilting to one side as he watched Harry. His expression gave nothing away. “So, since we’re both of the mind that it’s silly, then no harm done if we jump over holding hands, right? It’s not like we’re hoping for proof that we’re a good couple since we aren’t, in fact, a couple. Everyone else might be doing it as some Solstice fortune-telling thing, but we’re doing it to boost your morale.”
Sipping from his drink, Potter walked around to where Draco stood at the edge of the table. He nudged Draco in the side and asked, “So do you?”
“Twat,” Malfoy said.
Harry laughed again. It was the only option that didn’t include yelling, so instead of being annoyed that Draco had used him to avoid being set up, he laughed. He laughed so hard he had to hold his stomach.
“Hold on, so he doesn’t like that bloke?”
“And in your decided opinion, what earns one these elusive compliments?”
Mr. Potter was dashing through the crowd, no doubt headed for the nearest apparation point. Thoughts clouded Draco’s head, but he pushed them away and found his legs carried him after Mr. Potter even though he could not fathom what excuse he could present that would forgive him the harsh words which he laid upon Mr. Potter’s character.
“Oh, one must, must they?”
“So what if I am? Answer my question.”
But Harry was still afraid of the reactions he would receive upon sharing the news, so he decided that telling everyone would have to be a one-on-one thing, for his sanity. Most of his friends, well, three of them; Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, already knew he fancied both men and women, so at least that part wouldn’t shock them. However, the person with whom he fell in love, that part could be tricky.
Draco didn’t answer his father. Honestly, he had no words. Goyle, who was never one for witty conversations, had always been good to him. He felt a small bit of sympathy for his loss, though he didn’t dare voice it. Anything even remotely resembling disloyalty and Draco was sure he would be no better off. The fact that he was Lucius’s son would do nothing to dissuade the Dark Lord. In fact, he was sure his father would offer him up gladly if it further secured his own position. It seemed all that mattered to his father was the Dark Lord and his wishes.
Harry forced a smile. “Nothing I can’t handle.”
“That remains to be seen. Remember the rules?”
“See? He’s bonkers, Reed. Who cares if he is good at magic when he’s insane. I bet you-know-who was good at magic, too.”
” Draco admitted, “but say I kiss you, and I feel something and you don’t? Also ridiculous because now I’m embarrassed. Then the same result occurs: we can’t be friends anymore because I would be too mortified.”
I took a detour to my bathroom and threw open the cabinet. I was stocked up on Pepper-up Potions and hangover cures. I took one of each and waited while the magic washed over me. I felt my vision clearing up and I blinked slowly at my reflection which stared at me blankly. I could see the purple bags under my eyes, permanent fixtures as of late. That paired with the five o’clock shadow, and I looked a right mess. No wonder everyone was worried about me. Seeing this sight, I couldn’t blame them.
Before anymore pleasantries, or subtle elbow nudges could be exchanged, the first course was brought out and Draco could tell Nikola was impressed by the sheer abundance of food that was placed in front of him. It was the first time all night that he looked at anything other than Draco.
“All right, okay, quiet down,” Robards said, voice barely above a whisper. The murmurs died down. “Thank you. Our potions department has been working on something that will lessen the effects of the Succubus’s power to enthrall people, which should keep all of you focused enough to trap her in a Lock Box,” Robards continued, “Potions Master Parkinson has assured me that it’s nearly done, so before anyone heads out to follow a lead, go down and see her.”
Harry fought against the force of her magic, which still worked on him despite her gruesome face, and gathered his remaining strength and said, “
The room got quiet for a moment as a the song changed from The Weird Sisters to Celestina Warbeck. The mood went from rowdy to suddenly romantic. Someone, probably Stav, even charmed the lights to dim. And many of the party-goers started to slow dance and snog.
After the mess with the war, Draco and Pansy had made it their mission to gain back a small shred of the prestige their family names once held. In order to accomplish such a task, Draco had to condescend himself to do things that he found no enjoyment in like socializing with people at events such as this, even if one only finds them barely tolerable.
Again, he wasn’t really asking Draco, but that was beside the point now. For the sake of all future passers by, Draco opened his top drawer and pulled out the correct file. It was right on top labeled
With difficulty, Draco took in a deep breath and responded. “Surely. It must be something else entirely.”
A smile spread across my face and even though I was only mostly sure we were alone, I sank to my knees in front of him. I looked up at him and tasted my pulse in my mouth. I wanted something to distract me from the day and since Neville wasn’t happening, Malfoy’s cock would do just fine.
The sky darkened even more and rain began to fall. The droplets hit Draco’s face, startling him out of his thoughts, the sensation of the raindrops rolling down his exposed skin like a soft touch. He pulled his wand out and cast an umbrella charm to keep the rain off of him. Then he took in one deep breath and turned towards the opposite end, thankful to be free of Potter’s gaze, yet feeling colder without it as if someone stripped his blankets off in the middle of winter.
Of course, now she only printed fluff pieces about us. I even heard tale of her trying to squash some of the more gossipy articles about me. Not that it changed how I felt about her. She was still a bastard.
“Hello, Harry Potter.” And without waiting for a response, she added. “And Draco Malfoy, too. What a treat.”
Then, over by the opposite goal posts, Harry spotted the snitch. It floated mid-air and beckoned Harry to move—to catch it, but he hesitated, his eyes flitting over to Draco of their own accord. He eyed Draco, who was soaring high above the pitch looking in the opposite direction, and his stomach caved in on itself.
Ron sighed. “No, not okay. We’ve been arguing about this for months. How many more partners do you think they will let you go through before Robards fires you?”
I stared at the sink, not daring to meet Ginny’s eyes. “I lost it, Gin. When I knew what he was doing to that kid. I lost it.”
“The students have been talking all week about how
“Suppose so,” Harry agreed, and turned to the busy sidewalk, feeling comforted by Malfoy’s magic all around him, and replaying the Succubus’ words.
I nodded. Coming back for eighth year had seemed like a good idea at the time, but the reality was that Hogwarts wasn’t home anymore. Not after the battle.
Harry felt his breath quicken. If they were going to have this conversation, then he was going to say all the things he’d been playing over and over in his mind all week. It was now or never, so he answered, “That doesn’t matter right now.”
“Hi,” Harry said, wrapping an arm around the small of Ginny’s back and bringing her body close to his.
“Well, you figured wrong, then.”
“Bye, Ryder,” Draco said, then elbowed Harry in the ribs.
Skeeter nodded. “Your Ministry is covering up the magical surges and I want to know why. Don’t you?”
“She’s desperate,” Harry found himself saying. His conversation with the Succubus the night before was still a bit hazy, like he was seeing it through gauze, but he remembered some of the things she’d said. “She told me she wasn’t a picky eater anymore.”
. She screamed. When he pulled his hand away, his knuckles were stained with her blood, as well as some of his own. His hand throbbed.
Malfoy tightened his grip on my hand. I felt his nails dig into my skin, so I matched his grip and dug my nails in too. “It could kill you if something goes wrong.”
Draco cleared his throat, looked down at their still interlocked hands, and then back up to meet Harry’s eyes. “That wasn’t so bad.” He continued to stare at Harry, an odd expression on his face. He moved in closer to Harry and looked like he was going to say something, but then they heard Flitwick’s voice from the other side telling them they needed to clear the way.
taste like milk.” He fought the urge to drop at her feet and beg her to love him. He knew it wasn’t right, but he just couldn’t remember exactly why. That nagging sensation was the only thing that kept him from doing it.
“My darling Draco, look who is approaching,” Pansy whispered in Draco’s ear. Her breath was hot and smelled fruity from the champagne.
“Course not, mate. Plus, I’m not sure it’s serious yet,” Neville mused. He looked truly concerned for Harry’s dating situation. No doubt, he shared the same worry that all his mates shared which was that Harry would end up old and alone. Most everyone else had at least been dating since the war, if not settled down like Ron and Hermione.
“Well then, Ned, I’m pleased to make your acquaintance. I am Auror Malfoy and this is my partner, Auror Potter. We were hoping you could help us.”
“Well,” Potter mused, “they got it wrong anyhow.”
“All right, this is what’s going to happen,” Robards took out his wand and pointed at Ron. “I am going to cast two Obliviate’s so when they check my wand it will look like I already wiped your memories. Then if the Unspeakables really do wipe my memory, at least you two will still be cognizant.”
“Sir?” Reed asked, still standing where I’d stopped her.
“Yeah, probably best,” Harry agreed and released Draco’s wrist. He stood there a moment, processing what Draco had asked him before he made his way over to Ginny and Hermione.
“On that, I will have to take your word, Mr. Potter, as I have not had the delight of speaking to many people this evening.”
Draco and Harry finally talk.
All Draco cared about in that moment was the calm that washed over him after leaving Potter in his cell, panting from both anger and arousal.
Ned put a hand up to block Malfoy from passing him. “Wait, uh, this is going to sound very forward, and it is, but how would you react if I asked you out?”
“How do I know what you’re saying is true?”
“It’s not an act.”
In the office, Draco sat behind a large mahogany desk. There were books open in a semi-circle in front of him and his head was bowed as he scribbled something down in the margin of one of the books.
“Set me off?”
“Yup,” was all the reply Draco gave.
That made Draco choke on the sip he’d been taking. “No. Since when?” Draco downed the rest of the whisky in his cup. “Okay, we really need to find another bottle.
“Knock, knock,” I said.
Meanwhile, Potter still eyed Draco suspiciously. He leaned in closer and whispered, “Why are you being so helpful all of a sudden? Any other day you’d have fought me about protocol.”
“I have heard stories about your mouth, you know? How it performs magic. How it tastes like the most decadent treats.” Nikola moved a hand from his waist and trailed his index finger across Draco’s mouth slowly as he continued, “Yet in all those stories, not one man spoke of the taste of your cock and I find myself aching to taste you.”
That was it. Draco was tired of Potter always assuming the worst in him just because he was cautious. He took the quill and scribbled his signature on the line under Potter’s. More than anything, Draco wanted Potter to think him worthy. He had since they met that first day in Madam Malkins. He wanted it even more than he wanted Potter to use a coaster.
“It’s a nice offer, but thanks. Also, I never realized I was so easy to read. That is not a good trait to have as an Auror. I’ll have to work on my poker face.” Harry was half joking, but half serious. It seemed that everyone knew things about him that he hadn’t shared. It was starting to concern him.
“Are you seriously trying to flirt with me while we run through the fucking Forbidden Forest?” His speech was labored, but he didn’t fall behind me.
Before stepping into the downpour, Draco steeled himself. Then he felt the rush of water hit him in sheets. It was a cool rain for so late in the spring and he felt his hair immediately cling to his head and cheeks.
Ron turned to face Harry and then cocked his head to the side in confusion, then he asked, “Well, why talk about it now if you think it’s too late?”
“What is the issue then?”
Hermione turned to Ron and held a finger up to her mouth, shushing him. “I need to concentrate. This is the first human trial of the potion. There’s no telling how Harry will react to it.”
The lights flickered off and the room went suddenly cold. I wrapped my arms around my torso. Fear ran though my veins like ice cold water just like third year the fist time I met a Dementor. I couldn’t think straight. I should have cast a wandless spell, but I just stood there in the dark. I had to remind myself to breathe.
At one point, these halls felt safe. Growing up at the Dursley’s had been hell and this place was my sanctuary, until it wasn’t. I got to be myself here, well, most of myself anyway. It was always easy to hide behind ‘doing the right thing because its the right thing’ excuse since that’s what people expected drove me to fight Voldemort over and over. In the end, it didn’t matter what drove me to do it. All anyone cared was that I did it.
“And you believe he was the one showing you those terrible things? You think he forced you to see them?” Greyjoy’s voice grew softer as she spoke. She sipped at her own cup of tea and sighed with relief.
I picked it up and that gritty face watched me from his trial photo which we kept in the file because the Ministry is nothing if not paperwork obsessed. He was scowling and his face was covered in bruises in various states of healing likely from the beatings he took from corrupt and pissed Aurors who lost someone to Voldemort and the war. Something in my gut twisted at the memory of him beaten up sitting there awaiting the Wizegnmont’s verdict and I scowled back at the picture for making me feel guilty and placed the file on my desk and worked on cleaning up the rest.
“Yes, it is,” Nikola replied politely, taking a sip of whiskey from the crystal glasses which were also reserved for occasions where people were to be impressed.
spell. The effort to cast made his legs feel like jelly, so he leaned on the brick wall of the alley to keep steady. Spells rolled off her, so he’d resorted to hitting her with actual objects and it was working, at least it would until he couldn’t gather the strength to focus on casting.
“Well, you got me.” I tried to sound pleasant, or at least not unpleasant. I think I ended up closer to sounding unpleasant. Sleep deprivation will do that to you. So will hangovers.
He swallowed hard, and let loose every spell he could think of, starting with Expelliarmus and ending with a Bat-Bogey Hex. Casting made him see spots, and he wasn’t even sure he was hitting the Succubus. Sometimes nothing came out of his wand at all. She had only kissed him for a minute, but she managed to practically sideline him, not to mention she made him think of things he’d rather ignore. All in all, she had him over a barrel.
“Thanks, took forever, but I think it’s nearly done.” He looked at his handiwork appreciatively, then his eyes found Luna. She wore a flowing forget-me-not blue sundress and no shoes. She beckoned Neville over with a crooked index finger. He smiled at her and then turned to Harry. “Be back, the woman of my dreams needs me for a moment.”
Draco had asked for some time, and Harry figured that meant a day, maybe two, so Harry gave him space. He knew Draco by now, knew he needed time to process things, but then days turned into a week and school was ending soon. Exams started tomorrow and a worrying, sinking feeling that Draco was going to leave him ate away at him.
“Here comes the Saint Potter speech about helping others and saving the world, again. Don’t you ever tire of this whole righteousness act?”
me?” He scoffed, making his way over to Potter. The idea wasn’t entirely without it’s charms. He could set Potter free, Potter would kill him, or at least beat him within an inch of life and then kill his father and the Dark Lord and Draco would be free to be with his mother again.
“It’s the way you say it.” Potter pulled Draco’s hand to his lips. He did not kiss Draco’s hand, but instead rested Draco’s fingers against his lips. Then he whispered, “Sometimes, I get hard just hearing your voice.”
“I lost people in the war, too,” Malfoy snapped. His chest was rising and falling with a stained effort like he was working to not lunge at me and take me down in a tornado of punches.
I gave him mine without hesitation. I’d barely cast any spells with it in the last few days. Ron hesitated and then handed it over. Robards cast a bubble charm around them to persevere the evidence. It was procedure to exclude the aurors wands, so I wasn’t worried.
As Harry was off in his mind thinking about how Draco had beamed with pride when he beat harry three times in a row at the seekers game, he didn't realize he had been staring at Draco. Now, however, he was starkly aware and he was also aware that Draco was watching him, too.
“Tomorrow?”
Draco chewed at his bottom lip, his wide eyes still searching Harry’s face. “Fine. I think I
Draco looked over his shoulder. They were alone in the entrance lobby. “Uh, sure. What’s that?”
His hand hung between us. His long pale fingers outstretched toward me. His hand trembled a bit as he waited for me to take it. “You had no problem touching me the other day, in fact you insisted on it.” Malfoy’s voice lowered to a whisper and if I wasn’t mistaken, he sounded hurt. He was the one that stood me up last night. He had no right sounding hurt.
After watching Quincy and Stav, two chasers, bet one another that they couldn’t do three shots while doing a handstand, Charlie laughed heartily and cheered along with the crowd. “These people are sort of wild,” Charlie observed, still smiling. He held his glass up to his lips and took a slow sip.
?” Lucius asked, attempting concern but skipping past it into pure annoyance at having to deal with someone he so clearly saw as a nuisance. Just what he needed, for his son to fall ill in the middle of a government coup.
“You taste delicious,” the raven-haired Succubus said, her voice husky and breathy. She licked along the line of his jaw as her hands raked down his chest, undoing a few buttons in the process.
Draco’s smile turned hesitant, the lines at the corners of his mouth fading as his smile did. “Huh, weird? I think I missed that part. What’s your point?”
not so bad.”
“Obviously,” Malfoy snapped. He pulled at his collar again, unbuttoning the top button.
Harry tried to control his face. He was happy to hear that they hadn’t kissed yet. In a way, it meant that Harry still had a chance. If he could just get the courage up. “Oh, course, mate. My lips are sealed.” Harry then mimed locking his lips and throwing away the key.
“I understand, and you know how she is...Hermione needs to process. I’m sure when she stops thinking about how it isn’t the plan she had in mind, she will realize that working with George is what’s best for you, and for him.”
Running his tongue over his teeth, Draco tasted the morning on his breath more and more, and the taste of lavender, less and less. It was necessary for his composure. He needed to attempt to erase the terrible stain of his memories in some manner.
“I’m fine. Just a scratch.” Potter grunted as he tried to stand clear of the wall, but leaned back on it again. “Okay, maybe I do need to get this looked at.”
“Do you know what my visions are about?”
“I didn’t get the last one.”
The crowd turned to see Draco, lemon tart halfway to his mouth. He smiled and placed the desert on the plate he held. “Of course, Luna, I’d be glad to.”
Harry lowered his voice to a whisper. “Yeah, I am.”
Without answering, Mrs. Granger placed her hand in Pansy’s. She turned to Mr. Potter and smiled, searching for something in his expression, and when she seemed satisfied he would not object to her leaving, she nodded at Pansy and they headed into the crowd.
It had been months since he had even thought about sex in any way other than a business transaction and then suddenly he was achingly and embarrassingly turned on by a man who he has hated since childhood. To say he was bemused was an understatement.
The next morning, Harry was desperate to see Draco, but he was nowhere to be found. He must have skipped breakfast and Harry didn’t see him in Potions. Everyone around him seemed to move too slow—he was fighting through crowds of slow moving people all day. He needed to find Draco and explain. He needed to know how Draco felt.
“He’s tried, countless times,” Lucius flicked his wrist in disinterest. “Rumors have been circulating for decades about him trying to make the magic work. So far, he has been unsuccessful.”
“Will I
It wasn’t fear that made Harry shake, but the strain of focusing his energy to try and cast. He hated that he’d let her get a piece of him. He’d thought he'd seen the worst of what magic could do to those who attempted to prolong their lives. Voldemort had been grotesque thanks to his efforts, but still seemed human-ish. If this thing had ever been human, Harry couldn’t see it now.
Harry watched Draco for a moment, his posture rigidly straight as always, reminded Harry of a ballerina. Then he swallowed hard because
“Yes, I have full reign on the topics I get to discuss,” Luna said still watching the bird as if it were much more interesting than Harry, “The editor likes me very much and my column is quite popular. Plus, the Prophet will be thrilled to print anything about you.”
“No, Potter.”
I shook my head. “You both creep me out.”
“Oh, this isn’t me causing a scene, Potter. If you want to see a scene, I can deliver.”
“What's that about?” I whispered to Ron as we fell into step behind Hermione who walked with determination past the large water fountain that replaced the statue that fell during the war with Voldemort.
It was easy. Like their bodies and lips were made to fit together in this way. Harry wrapped around Draco and Draco sucking at his bottom lip. In a haze, Harry lifted Draco up and sat him down on the edge of the desk, their lips never parting.
Not exactly standard auror protocol, but Robards cruised to get me sacked was well known. The Unspeakables didn’t even bother questioning it further since they planned to obliviate everyone anyway and Robards’ disdain for me was well known. They sent Ron and I on our way without so much as a sideways glance. As we cleared the cemetery gate, I saw a flash of light that told me Robards had been Obliviated. As far as they knew, the situation was under control.
“You know, you’d give Dumbledore a run for his money as weirdest headmaster.”
His mother only smiled at him and then took her seat again. Unfortunately, his mother had not had enough time to teach her portrait much. It had only been a few months ago that his father decided to commission portraits for the family. Mother had found it silly to have them so soon, but Lucius insisted like somehow he knew she would die. She was a strong witch whose magic was infused with the painting, so it moved like her, talked like her,
“The grave was disturbed.” He turned away from the victim and took out his wand. He cast a magical traces spell to see if anyone had cast in the vicinity within the last half hour. The spell wasn’t perfect. It often misled us or identified the wrong kind of spell, but it worked well enough and it was our only option, at least until Malfoy perfected his potion.
I nodded. “You could say that.”
Draco decided to play with Potter. If the man wasn’t disgusted, then Draco would take this as far as he could tonight because he could see no other opportunity like this ever again presenting itself. He would enjoy watching Potter be aroused by another man sucking his cock. So he shoved forward into Nikola’s mouth again—his eyes locked on Potter’s.
,” he breathed out, overwhelmed by the suddenness of the potion’s shield protecting him, which could only mean one thing: the Succubus was nearby.
She nodded. “I assume you both do, too. Halfway through the party, I noticed Ron very swiftly disappearing his champagne when no one was looking.”
“That scream,” he whispered. “Are they dead?”
“Is the trace still there?” He ignored my answer, but I saw the hint of a smile playing at the corner of his mouth.
When Harry thought about it, and he thought about it often, he wasn’t sure what compelled Draco to continue these meetings. Sure, they had a rivalry and once upon a time, it was a ‘horns locked in battle’ sort of rivalry. But now, it was less and more at the same time. Now it was more of bear cubs play fighting—testing their limits. Harry knew what he was getting out of these meetings. He just wasn’t sure what Draco was getting.
Harry held up his hands. “No problem. I was just telling Draco how rude it was to steal that whisky from me.”
Malfoy looked at the tea in his hand. His eyes widened and I watched his normally schooled expression of indifference fade away and be replaced with fear. He looked up at Greyjoy. “Why are you gathering your own ingredients when Hogwarts has a store room?”
He scowled at me when he reached the clearing where I stood. There was a small opening in the treetops and sunlight floated down into the forest like a spotlight on me.
“Mr. Potter, let me explain,” Draco started.
“I like her books,” I admitted.
That McGonagall and the other professors hadn’t noticed was almost as funny as the fact that Rosmerta, from the Three Broomsticks, had designated a few punch bowls as the “adult” ones and didn’t notice when she had started serving out of the ones Dean, Seamus and Blaise had spiked. Harry laughed to himself because it also seemed like everyone was much more drunk than he was, and he was decently tipsy.
A smile crept across her face, showing her wrinkles. She sat forward a bit, her dress suit rustling against the fabric of the ottoman. “You really should be more careful who you bring home in future.”
“Rachel. She’s a seventh year Gryffindor. Then what’s her face, the one you knew about, her name was Farrah. And they tried one bloke, ironically enough, it was Christian, the one Luna tried setting you up with. That’s it so far. Unless you count both Ron and Hermione asking me for about a month why I didn’t work things out with Ginny. Eventually, they gave up on that one and moved onto trying to play Cupid because apparently I need to be in a relationship.”
Malfoy stammered, managed to plaster on one of his cocksure smirks and said, “It makes sense, really. A witch who was willing to give up everything for immortality wouldn't actually want to owe her soul to anyone.” Malfoy took a breath and continued, “Naturally, you would have been working out how to avoid the call when it came. I know that’s what I would have done, figuring you had at least a few centuries to figure out a loophole before your number was up. Nothing panned out, so now you’re scrambling for something. You searched everywhere, but the only loophole you can think of is binding yourself to earth. But you can’t cast on your own, so you need magic, and lots of it, to manage it.” He pointed to the candles, all of which still burned brightly.
(See the end of the chapter for
I laughed. It was a nasty sound, even to my ears. “So you and your just laws can shove another crime under the rug. No, thanks. I’m going to make sure all the officials have to hear about their pal and the bruises he left on his kid. I’m going to make them face it.” It was hard to have this conversation when I knew only part of the reason I beat the man was because I knew it was wrong what he was doing, but the other part of it had been something more selfish.
lonely?”
Hermione was wearing a tight navy blue dress that was off the shoulder. Her hair was in a complicated looking updo. Ron was wearing gray pants and a soft blue button up. They looked like they were heading out on a fancy date and it made me feel like an interloper. It was not a promising start to the day, but I was on time and I was sober.
“I’m afraid that I’m no good at being any other way, Gin.” Admitting it stung. I’d always worried that having Voldemort's soul attached to mine had corrupted me and that’s why I couldn’t be happy.
Draco barely hid the smile on his face. “A bit forward, yes.”
“Shall we discuss this at yours?” she asked. “Since you have the best security setup.”
She smiled and then started rambling off the rest of their wedding party. Ron, Seamus, and Dean were the other groomsmen. Ginny, Hermione, and one of the people Harry didn’t recognize called Illyana were the bridesmaids. There was a great amount of chatter after the announcements, but Harry tuned most of it out.
approaching us. Their long black robes flapped in the wind as it kicked up. At the front of the group was Robards. He was tall. At least six-five with broad shoulders and a face that wasn’t unattractive but also wasn’t memorable. His light blonde hair made him more noticeable than most, but it wasn’t striking. It was normal. His gaze landed on me and I could almost feel the disgust in that stare. It wasn’t exactly malicious. More annoyed. Officially, I was on desk duty so being at a crime scene would mean a ton of paperwork and explaining on his part.
To Draco’s surprise, the room had been changed since he was there earlier. The long oak table was transfigured into a smaller table, still rectangular, but much more intimate. His father was clearly up to something, but Draco wasn’t sure what it was yet. However, this did confirm he would be offered up to Nikola as he suspected.
“Seems a waste to stand and simply admire the music when we could be dancing. Would you care to dance, Mrs. Granger?” Pansy asked. She extended her pale hand, long fingers splaying out like an elegant lace fan.
The sound echoed off the stone walls. He wanted Potter to know the moan was for him, so he locked eyes with Potter again, this time licking his lips and blowing a kiss as he yanked Nikola forward to swallow him to the hilt.
“Promise?”
Merlin, Harry thought, as he followed his partner through the Floo and back to the Ministry. His partner really was a pain in the arse. Dropping a bomb like that and then making an exit without waiting for a response. Ever the drama queen. He didn’t even give Harry a second to process what that meant, or to tell him that clearly the attraction Harry had been denying was for Malfoy, so that plus being around Malfoy made the potion extra strong.
Malfoy was one of the people who watched Harry and Ron. He wore a quiet scowl that made him look like a governess who was upset that you couldn’t learn the difference between formal
“Draco?” Potter said, still laughing.
? You’re going to jump over a fire? In that expensive suit? In those shoes?” Harry pointed down at the wing-tipped Oxfords Draco wore.
“You know me,” Harry answered.
“Not if you’re going to be a twat about it, no.” Malfoy stepped in front of me and raked his eyes over my body. His gaze lingered over my groin before he settled on my face.
“Not true.”
“What?” Lamont asked.
me, Potter.”
Harry threw his hands up in exasperation. “I mean
It’s New Year’s and Harry is feeling the pressure of the future like a crushing weight. At the New Year’s Eve party, he ends up pretending to be Draco’s date and then things heat up between them.
“I like paperwork,” Luna chimed in thoughtfully. Her hair was almost as white-blonde as Malfoy’s. I’d often wondered if they were related. “It’s nice to get all tidy, don’t you think?”
“One shall.”
Anger bubbled inside of Harry. He felt it just below the surface like a volcano building pressure before blowing. Malfoy was the one who knocked into the shelf. He was the one who attempted a Scourgify that just happened to make the mess disappear along with the entire store closet.
All of these confessions made Draco feel lightheaded. In the last ten minutes, Draco had been more honest than he had ever endeavored to be—sharing his fears and his hopes, however misguided, with Mr. Potter.
"Speak for yourself." A smile spread across Draco's face. Potter laughed again and eyed him seriously, which made Draco’s heart pound. “Okay, fine. Yes. I am stubborn and prideful, too, there, happy?”
“Are you behind those books?”
Ironically, I ended up in the dungeons. At least the setting matched how I felt. Gloomy. Dark. And a bit unpalatable for most civilized people.
The snow broke on contact. It was freezing, which Harry found both obvious and shocking because he had been sure his face was numb after being in the cold for so long. It got in the collar of his jacket making him wiggle around like a complete ponce.“Did you really just do that?”
“He’s vocal about Harry and the hearing. All he had to do was claim he didn’t want Harry knowing about a death linked to a odd magical occurrence becasue that could help him prove his theory.” When Hermione scrunched up her brow, Ron added. “Our trace spells wouldn’t work at the scene. Like not inaccurate or anything. Just nothing. None of us ever saw it react that way. Like there was too much magic to focus on.”
“Of course. I just didn’t know if the date would…”
She shook her head. “Not exactly. I know you’re having them and they will lead to your death if you are not careful.”
We sat in silence for a while. She watched me cautiously, eying the whiskey in my hand. I was getting bored, so I held it out to her and said, “Care for some whiskey?”
“It’s just different now, okay?”
“So, since you already know the story. Do you have any advice?”
It was impressive, really. Potter managing to keep his anger all these months. Draco would almost be impressed if he weren’t so annoyed. It was his job, after all, to make sure Potter’s morale was gone. And Potter made this job nearly impossible. Yet, Draco persisted at the bequest of the The Dark Lord because though he would never voice it, he feared the rise of Potter and his compatriots, even knowing most of them had been captured.
“You’re a bastard, you know that?”
“I wish I had,” Charlie's words died on Harry’s lips and suddenly he was breathing heavy and his face was hot. And Charlie was moving away toward the kitchen.
“You always have and always will be a

a short sleeved cotton shirt. It was pale blue and made his platinum blonde hair stand out even more than usual. Beside him was a tiny owl who looked impatiently at Malfoy as if waiting for the response was taking too long.
. Curious.”
“And that is why you treat me with such contempt whenever you see me? Why you ran from me tonight?”
Hermione was about to ask a question, no doubt about what was wrong, but just then Neville’s voice, via Sonorus charm, echoed throughout the greenhouse. “Everyone, can I get your attention?”
“Well, if it didn’t affect you, then does that mean you didn’t have an already existing attraction?” Potter scrunched his brow. “No, that can’t be it because then the Succubus could have trapped your mind, and she didn’t? That means you had an existing attraction and the potion worked on you?”
“Why does he care? He has a boyfriend doesn’t he?”
Lucius would not let his son embarrass him in front of the Dark Lord, so last week he pushed Draco to resort to physical violence in order to obtain results. At first, Draco had been horrified by the idea if only because he did not want to run the risk of injuring himself or destroying the silky smoothness of his skin with scars. Brute force had never really been his area. However, once he engaged in it, he found that he quiet enjoyed the physicality of it.
“Guess.” Ron’s voice reminded me of McGonagall’s when she caught us out after curfew in school and said, ‘of course it’s you three’ like she wasn’t
Ron laughed. “You might have.”
“Care to tell me why your partner popped out of the Floo and verbally requested a partner change before heading home without being debriefed?”
“Harry, there’s so much…” Draco started to say, but Harry held a finger to his lips.
All sorts of promises were broken and the Ministry operated the same as it had before Voldemort. Nothing was different and people like Daniel J. Riley still worked above the law. I wasn’t going to let that happen anymore.
Objectively, it was a gorgeous painting and a perfect tribute to his mothers entire person. She would have enjoyed being remembered in her garden. Yet, Draco found the whole thing utterly morbid even growing up in a household full of dead ancestors in their portraits had not prepared him for how alive his mother would look, would sound, in that portrait.
Neville’s office was much neater than Hermione’s, Harry reflected, and it was lined with all sorts of plants Harry had never even seen before. They all stretched up, or out, or wound themselves around each other. There were some perched carefully on Neville’s desk in small pots. One in particular, a small yellowish flower, looked like it was proud, as if it felt better than the other plants because it was special enough to be placed on the desk.
“Who got what wrong?” Draco asked, absentmindedly. He took another sip of his drink. It was still vile.
“It took me a while to work it out. I’d probably have gotten it sooner if this potion we took to guard us from you wasn’t messing with my head all day, but he’s come to collect you hasn’t he? Calling your soul?”
Forgetting where they were for a minute, forgetting that he was there to make Draco jealous, Harry watched Charlie walk to the kitchen. He could see him in the kitchen now, talking to Levy and some girl as he filled his glass and took a long swig finishing it and then filling it again.
Thanks to Parkinson’s potion, he was experiencing his feelings for the first time since Dean’s death, really feeling them—all of them. And it was overwhelming and confusing. He hurt all over, physically, but emotionally, too. He hadn’t let himself slow down since he lost Dean, so two years worth of emotions all skidded to a halt at once, crashing into him, with his attraction to Malfoy and guilt for being alive when Dean was dead at the forefront, both competing for top billing.
His wand in hand, Harry slowly walked further into the alley where large dumpsters lined the wall of the club. The back of the alley ended in a brick wall, so unless the thing could Apparate or fly, he had it cornered.
In the middle of the room, there was a raised stone coffin with the name Howard Benchley etched into the stone. According to the etching, Benchley died in 1807. The rest of the dead were housed in the walls around him. He must have been the patriarch of the family. And there were a lot of relatives surrounding Benchley. This man’s eternal resting space was bigger than Harry’s apartment. Rich people. Even in death they had to be showy.
“No, I won’t.”
He was still recovering the Life Energy the Succubus siphoned off him. It had taken him three tries to get his Floo working, and his wand only sparked whenever he tried casting. He hadn’t felt so useless since he was living with the Dursleys.
Hermione took off at a brisk pace. She checked her watch. “That took ten minutes longer than it should have. We could have floo’d here faster. Damn them for not setting their floo up. So inconvenient.”
Malfoy pointed to the dirt on his clothes and hands. “Just you’re a bit dirty and not the fun kind of dirty either. The dirt kind of dirty.” He ended with a wink and again, I felt my body react to him.
I felt my breathing quicken. Closed my eyes and begged the vision to go away, to stop. I opened my eyes and the man was still lying in the dirt, blood pooling around him, seeping into the earth.
Ron looked at Hermione gathering a plate full of food for him. “Tonight. We need to behave normally for now. The Unspeakables think we were mind wiped so we need to stay at this party. It’s what they will expect.” He walked over to Hermione and I watched his face shift from a quiet rage to something softer. They began talking animatedly with Seamus and Dean.
Draco said his mates had been asking questions, too, but all he had to do was give them one withering stare and they dropped the subject—at least they dropped it around him. But that didn’t stop them and everyone else from trying to understand the seemingly friendly manner in which Harry and Draco seemed to regard one another suddenly.
“I sort of hate that you two became close friends.”
Ryder coughed once to clear his throat. “Uh, sorry. I was...Luna made it seem like,” he stuttered and then took a breath. “Of course, it was nice talking with you guys.”
Harry shifted his broom from one hand to the other. The familiar feel of the wood against his calloused palms made him miss the rush of quidditch. He hadn’t played in two years thanks to the war and McGonagall deciding that eighth years weren’t allowed on house teams, so when he was faced with an opportunity to best Draco in a seeker's game, he made sure to take it.
? Your the one with the oafish feet,” Malfoy snapped. As if for good measure, he kicked Harry’s foot. “Every time you stepped, I nearly lost my balance.”
The infamous second kiss ;)
“I’m not doubting her capabilities as weird as that is to admit out loud. Hermione understands the potion better than most, but not better than me. If you want the potion, I come along, too.”
“Sounds like a plan,” Malfoy agreed. He nodded and then walked past us and out into the garden.
“Stop,” he said, pushing away from the Succubus. He felt instantly lightheaded like he’d stood up too quickly.
The living room had grown warm during their talk. The fireplace roaring with an unabashed ferocity. Their dinner plates lay forgotten on the small coffee table. The only thing keeping their attention was the bottle of Ogden’s and Harrys more-than-ridiculous love life.
Neville smiled. “Is it any wonder Witch Weekly calls you unbelievably tempting?” He brought his fingers up to his collar and tugged on it a bit, undoing a third button.
After a moment, Harry shook thoughts of Draco’s flexible limbs from his mind and mounted his broom, with much less grace, and zipped off after Draco and the snitch.
“Ignored her.”
The wind picked up, whipping Harry’s hair around his face as he spiraled down and down on his broom, pulling up at the last moment into a Wronski Feint. The sun had set an hour ago, so that meant Draco was likely settling in for bed. It would be safe to head back to the eighth year common room. Harry took one more lap around the pitch, then made his way to the ground. The adrenaline of flying normally cleared his mind, calmed him, but the gnawing sensation in his gut was still there. It felt like he was still falling, but unable to pull up before he hit the ground.
“They already covered up one incident involving this man. And that’s just what I know about. If they did it once, they will do it again.” Ron gave me a look that begged me to shut up. I ignored it. “I know how it sounds, but an informant told me this man experienced a magical surge so large it produced something resembling an Obscurial. The Unspeakables wiped his memory of the event.”
and he was inside. There were a few vials labeled Dreamless Sleep and another labeled Calming Draught. Draco considered taking that one, but really it was more for dealing with trauma and not for a panic attack.
There was a moment where Draco thought he misunderstood Potter’s implied question, but then he felt the pressure of Potter’s mouth against his. He closed his eyes and let himself be kissed.
Harry gripped his broom tight. Draco looked in the wrong direction. The wind whistled in his ears as he made his way to the opposite goal posts. His heartbeat, pounding as furiously as if he were facing that troll his first year, echoed in his head. It was the rush he had been hoping for when he agreed to play Draco—the rush he expected, craved.
Nikola smirked. It was wicked and Draco noted it almost made up for his pleasant eyes. There was something dangerous in there after all. “I would be interested in seeing him. The rumors are he is quite formidable, which again only speaks to your great power since you were able to thwart him and his followers.”
“Really? Was it after the pick-up Quidditch game? The one where it rained and Charlie and I said we would put away everyone’s brooms?”
I just starred at him, not sure if I wanted to give in to him or if I wanted to fight him. Both would serve as a nice distraction from all the thoughts swirling around my head.
of Potter, fondly. It was another reason he wanted to avoid the party.
Draco’s face was one of pure shock when Harry landed on the pitch. His eyes were wide and his mouth agape. Before Harry could even gloat, Draco was demanding a rematch, claiming that Harry cheated somehow and that he would surely have won if Harry played fair.
Draco’s face was blank. Nothing showed. Not disgust, not happiness, nothing. His chest rose and fell with heavy breaths. He looked at Harry, his eyes narrowed, his lips pursed.
Except there was someone on the couch. Harry stopped mid-step. A lump of a person, curled up under a throw blanket, lay there. The only visible part of their body was the white-blonde strands of hair sticking out from under the blanket. Harry felt his heart pound in his chest at the sight. He started to back away as quietly as possible, but tripped over his Quidditch gear, fell backward, and whispered, “
“Get up, now,” Draco said more firmly than before. He raised a hand as if to strike him and felt his stomach flutter with arousal at the thought.
“Is he? Hadn’t noticed.” Draco waved off the idea with a flick of his wrist much like his father whenever he was done with a conversation. This was not the topic Draco was prepared to cover. He expected to be questioned on how long it took to get information from Potter, or what methods of torture were being used. These were things he had answered on countless occasions. No one ever inquired after Potter’s looks.
When they were out of ear shot, Robards asked, “Weasley, what is your opinion on this matter?”
should be enjoying it. Yet, here I am, scowling at all the happy couples and people drunk off their arses, thinking how ridiculous it all is.”
Hermione nodded. “That he is. But I would say, if you aren’t serious about him, don’t lead him on. We all know your, um, patterns with dating. He doesn’t date around. If he is hooking up with you it’s more than sexual for him. He only ever mentioned one boyfriend to me. They dated three years.”
Another knowing look crossed Pansy’s face. Only she knew about Draco’s asinine feelings for Potter, and only because she stole his diary in fourth year and read a rather embarrassing section where Draco gushed about Potter’s eyes ad nauseam. Eventually she said, “Succubus magic is Life Magic, it’s Death Magic, but it’s also Sex Magic. If they can’t trap you in their seduction, then they are weaker and less able to siphon your Life Energy, so we calculated the best way to keep from melting into a pile of lust at their feet was to use an already existing attraction as a shield.”
. School is ending, and I don’t want to be away from you ever. Just the thought of it makes my stomach sink.”
We both crouched down low behind the bushes and followed the bank of the stream, careful to avoid twigs or leaves underfoot. There was another rustle and this time I also heard humming and then a voice singing. Someone was out here with us. Out here where the black magical trail led us.
, and he didn’t want to stop feeling good.
“It’s one of the oldest wizarding cemeteries in England, Ron. We learned about in Hogwarts, A History.”
“But why right now, Harry?” Draco asked, his own voice quivering though no tears fell from his eyes. “Why not in a year or when my probation is over?”
The witch, whose name tag read Angela, looked at Malfoy cautiously and turned her eyes back to Harry. “For two?”
The fact it annoyed his father was reason enough for Draco to find it impressive. However, the encantions and sheer amount of spellwork that powered something this extravagant would have been enough to strike his curiosity all on its own.
“You’ve missed the morning debriefing. Are you ill?”
Kreacher smirked. “A woman.” And with that he popped back out of the hallway and up to his room, the attic. I could hear him mumbling something and stomping around the room.
The man in front of the rock placed his palm on the smooth part of the stone and when it came away, there was a blood print with elongated fingers just like at the crime scene. The man’s hand shook and I watched it shift like the beasts face. It was a normal sized hand and then it was suddenly the beasts clawed, boney hand.
“You swore you could be casual.”
“When did you fall in love with him?” Ginny asked, her face was somber as she waited for a response.
The door to the greenhouse swung open and Harry smelled the perfume of the blooming flowers, and for a moment, it felt like springtime. He looked to see who had decided to brave the cold, and was greeted by the soft smile of the man of the hour, Neville Longbottom. “Harry, mate, thought that was you. What are you doing out here pacing like a madman? It’s beyond freezing.”
“Potter, you are ridiculous,” Draco said, finally. A small smile played at the corners of his mouth. His eyes fell to Harry’s lips.
It seemed Nikola was no different. He was entranced before Draco even had to lift a finger. Every few minutes, Draco watched Nikola run his tongue across his bottom lip and sigh. Honestly, if this went on much longer, Draco was afraid the man would attempt to leap across the room and fuck him right there in front of his father and the Dark Lord.
He looked at me. His eyes bloodshot. He pulled away from my touch, then he took a sip of the tea and some color returned to his face. “I didn’t know you had visions back then.”
It was quite an interesting bet, Harry decided. It was basically a battle of wills. A battle to see could last the longest without giving in to the temptation and kissing the other. They were allowed to touch anywhere from the torso up, allowed to say things, but they had to keep their lips apart. Simple enough for Harry, since he went into this bet knowing Malfoy wanted him.
“This room is exquisite. The Minister would love to dine here,” Nikola said as he sat down across from Draco. Under the table, Draco felt Nikola’s foot rub up against his calf. The forwardness of the motion surprised Draco. Many of the men he was offered to were private about sex and therefore saved the flirting for when they were alone. Nikola, however, seemed to enjoy open displays of attraction because after he rubbed his foot against Draco’s calf once more, he winked.
Draco turned to meet Luna’s gaze, but it was with great effort because he did not want to stop watching the man who had only moments ago said he wanted to kiss Draco in the bathroom. “Yes, erm, I mean—no, no, that’s not...”
“No.”
“That wasn’t an answer,” I said, pushing my hand up his thigh more.
“Some things never change,” Draco mumbled to himself, covering his mouth as another yawn escaped him. He shut the magazine, and when he looked up, Potter was standing over him looking rested. They’d cleaned all the blood off his face and healed the cut. And if the stupid grin he wore was any indication, rid him of his concussion, too.
I didn’t even pretend to look ashamed. Hooking up at a party was the least terrible placed I’d ever hooked up with someone. The loo at the Leaky Cauldron ranks higher on that list.
Potter added, “You have to play. I am invoking the lab partners clause.”
The trio head back to Harry’s flat to discuss what they know. Harry tells them about his odd visions.
“It’s not so obvious, Harry. Just, well, we’ve known each other a long time. And I didn’t think it was a secret, just thought you didn’t like talking about your love life.”
“Yeah, we do,” Ryder answered. “I tried to ask you to be my partner once, but you were snacthed up pretty fast. Not that I was surprised. You’re the best in the class. The whole school, too, no doubt.”
“Get yourself together, Potter. We have a Succubus to find.” Draco wanted nothing more than to stand there and watch the pulse in Potter’s neck as his heart beat, watching his chest heave up with each strained breath, but Draco also knew that the longer he let himself indulge in those feelings, the worse the potion would affect him, and he was already having a hard enough time ignoring how his body reacted to Potter.
I walked closer to the man and saw his body shaking from crying. There was no sound, not even the sound of the earth beneath my feet as I stepped on twigs in the grass.
Ron nodded. “Harry’s on desk duty. He isn’t allowed to cast at an active crime scene.”
A smile flickered across Draco’s face as Harry hummed the song, and it made him look innocent, almost boyish, and untouched by all the trauma Harry knew he’d endured at the hands of his own family. “Back to it, Potter. These questions won’t answer themselves.”
The cold was making it hard to feel anything, let alone a kiss, so Harry grabbed the front of Malfoy’s coat and pulled him into an embrace figuring body heat would help. Malfoy made a small stuttering noise as their bodies crashed into each other. Neither of them pulled their lips apart, however.
Harry watched their easy dynamic. That’s another thing that changed about Draco, he was working to make friends who liked him for more than his family's money and influence, which he no longer had. Luna was the best of all the friends he’d made from what Harry saw. They were practically inseparable. Weirder things had happened, Harry supposed, like Harry letting Draco tutor him in potions all year and actually enjoying the time they spent arguing over how best to put a potion together.
“Because it was my fault. I planned to sneak away from the party.” Hermione geared up to say something, but before she could I said, “I know, I know— Anyway, I let myself get distracted.”
“He is smaller than I imagined,” Nikola said and moved form the doorway into the room and raked his eyes across Potter’s kneeling body. “But he is as attractive as everyone claims.”
Harry watched Charlie's eyes. They were darting back and forth between his lips and his eyes. It was making his hands feel all sweaty and his chest felt tight suddenly. “Yes,” Harry replied.
“Gin,” Harry started, but the look on Ginny’s face was so sincere and so understanding, that Harry couldn’t help but smile at the amazing, brave woman she had grown into over the last two years. And he had missed it. He missed it because he had to set off and hunt down Horcrux after Horcrux, and then when that was over, Auror training had taken over most of his life. It was only the last six months that Harry had even been able to socialize properly.
In the cellar, Draco finally let himself take a deep breath. The night had taken a turn. He had never paraded Potter about in front of anyone, let alone a strange man whose motivations were still a mystery. He feared that if Potter was obstinate, as he usually was, that Draco would be expected to control the situation. And if he was expected to control Potter, then he expected it would turn him on like it had been as of late.
Ron nodded and quickly raised a finger in the air like Sherlock when he found a clue. “Mayhaps.”
“Well,” Robards said when he approached us. He looked down at the body and then at me.
I nodded and turned to the sink, bracing myself on the edges. I avoided looking in the mirror. “I never really apologized. How could I if I am only now realizing how shit I was?”
“Drastic, huh…”
“Yes. Me as well.”
The cemetery was old. That much was apparent from its grandiose stone and iron gateway. It was also one of the few wizarding cemeteries in the middle of London, so the fact that it was a nexus of Ley Lines wasn’t at all surprising. The stone was covered in ivy, giving the whole thing a gothic, mystic feel. Staring at the gate, Harry almost felt like once he stepped through them, he would be stepping into another realm. There were all manner of tombstones, some newer made from granite or slick stone, but most were made from old stone and had partial names and faded dates on them.
Harry groaned. “This is why I never tell you anything. People are in danger. The sun is starting to set. She likely only needs one more sacrifice to activate the nexus. All the Ley Lines are accounted for, so all that’s left is where they all cross. Are we supposed to let someone die while we wait around for him to give us the go ahead?”
“I love it when you call me Potter.”
Potter pulled back. His face flushed. His lips red. Pupils blown. And he laughed. A full throated, belly laugh. Draco stood against the bathroom door. Breathing in deep breaths. Trying to catch his brain up to his body.
“Strange as in
“It’s not surprising that the Prophet is covering that. We weren’t fighting. I mean, yeah, I shouted a bit about the surges, but mostly it was about the kid and the hearing. Why are you showing me this anyway? There’s at least one article about me in there every week.”
When I came to, we were just outside of Hogsmeade. It would be a five minute walk to Seamus and Dean’s cottage which according to Ron sat just on the edge of the village and the Forbidden Forest.
“Wrong? I think not. Remember, you carry the burden of always being right.”
Draco flicked his wrist haughtily. “It’s only cocky if it isn’t true.”
Though in no way would it be considered cheating, Draco felt himself balk at the idea of sleeping with someone else. Of course, this was ridiculous since Potter did not reciprocate any sexual feelings toward Draco—let alone feelings beside hate, so at best, Draco’s feelings were a wild fantasy and at worst, they were going to drive Draco completely mad. It was completely one-sided attraction and it would remain as such, so possibly this is what Draco needed to distract himself from the hysterical notion that Potter would ever consider sleeping with him.
“Complicated?” Draco scoffed. “I think I am with you so far.”
Draco and Harry have a little study session that gets...serious.
Draco laughed bitterly to himself. “I mean, how could anyone see me as worthy with all the terrible things I did. Death Eater scum that I am, right? Doesn’t matter that I do good now, that I’ve undone as much of the damage my father wrought as I possibly could, in your eyes… I’m still nothing.”
“But—”
A hand shot up in the back. Harry could see out of his periphery that it was Auror Read, a mousy man that reminded Harry of Pettigrew. Harry had gone through training with him, and he was almost as annoying as Malfoy. “But sir, a Succubus will rarely kill so close together. They feed on Life Energy, and according to
I barely managed to stop laughing long enough to breathe. My cheeks burned from smiling too long. Tears streamed down my face. I felt awake despite the exhaustion tugging at my mind.
At each button, Harry felt Draco’s lip brush against his skin. The sensation drove him mad. The soft, warm breath tickled down until Draco stopped at his waist.
“I’m just not looking to date anyone at the moment, okay?” Harry asserted, still focused on her accusation that he refused to let someone love him. He wasn’t sure what she was on about, but he could do it if he wanted to. This conversation was ridiculous. There was something else he needed to do, if only he could remember what it was.
I coughed to get his attention. He looked up and his eyes darted to the front door of the shop and then back to me. “Hi, Malfoy.”
The only sounds were the soft breathing of patients sleeping, and the sounds of Potter’s shoes clicking on the tile floor as they made their way down the halls. Potter walked next to him, keeping in step with him. Potter’s knuckles brushed against his and Draco held his breath. The potion had to be out of his system by now. It’d been hours. So why did Potter’s touch still make him feel like he was flying?
“Avoiding small talk,” I joked. Well, half joked. Neville smiled at that and shook his head. “Also wanted to come say hi.”
I wanted to talk about it, but I couldn’t make myself say the words. I worried that admitting the memory Voldemort still haunted me made me weak. I couldn’t afford to be weak. Not now, not ever. Especially not with people in danger. The magical surges could be nothing. Sure. I could be wrong. But my gut told me there was more to them than we knew. If that were true, then I needed to be strong because the world might need me one more time.
“And by hate you mean love?”
And, like I said, that assumes
I breathed out a small laugh that caught Ron’s attention. Or at least part if it. His eyes were still fixed on Hermione who was boasting about unity or some other crap.
After what felt like hours drinking in the sitting room, the dinner bell rang and they were guided to the dining room by Daisy, their house elf who Draco actually sort of liked, though he was never going to admit it since his father would kill her if he even suspected Draco had made friends with the help.
Harry laughed. “That’s our Hermione. Can’t drop a cause even on her day off.”
“This cemetery is old, right?” Ron asked.
“Auror Potter!” Robards was walking towards him with a tight-lipped frown on his face.
“Sorry, sorry. You know me. I get going and,...there I go again,” she stopped, looking at Ginny’s empty glass and Harry’s half empty one. “I’ll grab us all new drinks. We all know Ginny needs another one after having to listen to me ramble for the last half hour.”
He had been so relaxed after Nikola’s
Ron’s eyes widened. “Merlin, Harry. That was grim.”
Draco was speechless. In all the times he spent with men, he was the one who
“I should have banned her from coming to the Quidditch team’s after-parties. That’s where she figured it all out. I denied it, though, but it was too late because she saw,” Harry mused, remembering the night last week when Ginny had shoved him, quite hard, from the main room of the party into the empty hallway and demanded to know why he hadn’t told her that he was in love.
“You’ve got me there,” Harry agreed. Malfoy tugged on his robe again. “But you are equally foolish if you think we’re just going to let you activate the nexus of Ley Lines.”
His accusation shocked me. I almost said ‘yes, I do want to get fired because at least then I won’t have to pretend everything is okay’ but I managed to catch myself and said, “No.”
“Rush, no, but—uh, Potter…” Draco let the end of what he intended to say trail off, hoping Nikola got his meaning. He was not interested in having Potter watch. Or maybe he was and that was what scared him. Maybe he wanted Potter to see him in a sexual way. That way Potter could fall asleep to thoughts of what Draco’s body felt like.
He was not an infant. He did not need to be reminded that being polite to Mr. Potter was in his best interest. It was not lost on him that having someone like Mr. Potter be amenable towards him would greatly help his cause, which was reason enough to smile and nod courteously. However, Draco still greatly felt the sting of rejection as if it were yesterday that he was waiting eagerly for Mr. Potter’s response to his letters.
Looking out at the dance floor, Draco spotted Pansy, her hands draped at Ms. Granger’s waist as she led them across the dance floor. Unquestionably the most alluring pair on the floor.
“Draco, what is there to think about? There are so many closets at Grimmauld Place, and books. You
“I’ll take it under advisement,” I snapped. She had some serious knuts. “Can you just spit it out already? Why are you here?”
. There’s never been anything wrong about you, Potter.”
“Harry?” Hermione’s voice answered from behind a stack of books that were shaped sort of like a fort, or at the very least a precariously put together wall.
Harry didn’t even bother responding or waiting for Pansy. He flew out of the supply closet and raced back through the main area where the crowd was still gathered and seemed to be quietly gossiping. Ignoring them, and Ron’s calls for him to wait, Harry made his way to the elevators and pushed the button for the Unspeakabale floor.
“Oh, I can woo better than anyone.” Potter’s voice vibrated against his neck in between kisses.
Ron sighed. “She was tricked by her boyfriend to give the information to the reporter.”
“No, Harry,” Hermione answered. “I’m sorry. I know you hate crowds.”
Draco stood and shouted at his father for the first time in his life. “You mean he wants to
Or Draco is trying to tutor Harry in potions but Harry is distracted.
I listened to his soft moans echo off the stone walls and slowed my rhythm, stopping at the tip to flick my tongue around the head. I felt his cock twitch and knew he was close, so I took him into my mouth all the way and let him fuck my mouth. His hands found purchase in my hair and he thrusted into me, his breath quickening and his legs tensing until he climaxed.
Malfoy was the one who answered. “Yes, you work here, correct?” He extended a hand for the man, who stood up and removed his work glove to take Malfoy’s hand.
It was a chaste peck. Soft. Quick. And then Draco pulled back to look at him. Harry was sure he was blushing, but didn’t care. He yearned for another kiss, so he moved in slowly and closed his eyes.
The Succubus’ eyes widened. She almost seemed impressed. “I only need one more death, wizard, and then the nexus will be active,” she said as she slipped herself off of the unconscious man. Her movements were graceful, more graceful than Harry would have expected from something that looked frail enough to crack in a strong wind. She padded across the room and stopped a foot away. Her mouth twisted into a smile that was even more unsettling thanks to the cracking of her burnt flesh. “I was planning on eating that man’s Life Energy, but I’ve had a taste of yours, and I think I’d like the rest.”
“Your indifference amazes me,” Pansy sighed, breaking Draco free from his own thoughts. This was not the first time they had a conversation like this, nor would it be the last.
“Is there some rush?” Nikola asked innocently while rubbing his thigh against Draco’s now throbbing groin.
In the end, Draco had convinced himself to come to the party out of curiosity, that and Luna threatened to do a French braid and spell it to stay for a week unless he agreed to make an appearance. At least that's what he told himself. It was hard to lie, but between Luna’s threat, which he was sure she would make good on, and his desire to see the inside of the ship, Draco decided that had little choice but to come.
“That’s a possibility,” I admitted. “I still think it’s more than that. The forest had always had ambient magic and the school is right near it. So why wasn’t our magic there affected?”
Draco dragged his hand off Potter’s chin, making sure to dig his nails in a little along the way. Bright red lines lay in the wake of his nails like blood in the snow. “Tisk, Tisk, Potter. Never say never. Hasn’t anyone ever told you it’s bad form to tempt the fates?”
“Is this going to be a regular thing?” Hermione asked. “Because if it is, I will need to grab some supplies like my bottled bubble charms to cushion your fall for one.”
“You will go on this mission and you will leave the Minister happier than you found him and in the process you will do what Goyle failed to do and retrieve the journal of Vseslav of Polotsk.”
“The what?” Draco managed. They were nearly at the group. He could hear Weasley’s obnoxious laugh over the hum of music.
again.”
“They must have all come in after I came to say hi to you,” I answered.
“Nonsense, I am immensely enjoying myself,” Mr. Potter sipped from his champagne flute and afterwards licked his bottom lip, seeming to savor the taste. “It is one of the more lively conversations I’ve had all evening. Many of the Ministry officials are painfully dull.”
Best to get right to the point. The longer Ron and Hermione hung around the cemetery, the more likely someone would notice. “I need your magical trace potion.”
She gave me a slight curtesy and lowered her wand. She bent over to pick up another log and tossed it into the fire. The embers and ashes floated up in small orange-black specs. “Won’t you two come join me for some tea? I’ve been foraging for ingredients. The forest has some magnificent plants to help with divination.”
She smiled. “Yes.”
Harry hit the ground with an
“Yes,” Draco said, his voice barely audible, “I do.”
Merlin, everything was so messed up. I was so messed up and I had been since that first fight against Quriell, I just didn’t know it then because I never had time to slow down. There was always another life or death situation waiting around the corner. Another mystery to throw myself into and no one questioned it, no one noticed every little bit of me I sacrifed because I was saving their lives. I was Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World and no one ever cared that that was killing me way before Voldemort ever actually did.
“Is that so?” Draco asked, with a smile. “And remember, I am very sensitive, so sugarcoat it for me.”
“If you’d like. This article is going to say what you want it to say, Harry,” Luna smiled brightly and then turned her attention away from Harry and to the open window where a small pigeon was perched.
“It’s for the privacy spell, you obtuse door knocker. It requires skin to skin contact. Just take my hand.”
Even at work, though, he wasn’t safe. Visitors came and went in the Ministry and some of them faked business so they could get a look at him. In all the mess, Harry had to change the security wards on the auror floor, by himself. His commanding officer claimed it would teach him to stay out of the press.
The rain didn’t bother him, even as it dripped in his eyes and soaked his shoes. It should have, but he barely felt it. All he could think about was Malfoy and the fact that he hadn’t been lying. He did think Malfoy was attractive. He didn’t want to admit he thought so, because he didn’t need the distraction, but he had for some time now. He wished he could just blame it on the potion, but he knew that it didn’t change a person’s feelings.
“I knew it,” Potter said after a few moments of silent perusal of the map in question. “I knew there had to be a pattern. I don’t know why I didn’t see it before.”
“Did I?”
I peered over the bush and saw Adeline Greyjoy, the new Divination professor, holding her hands up in the air. She wore a large flowing dress that billowed out as she spun in circles around a small fire. It crackled as a long snapped under the flames. There was an iron kettle next to the fire along with many glass jars full of herbs. She stoped singing abruptly and turned to me. There was a smile on her face as if she expected to find me here.
.” Malfoy shook his head and with a flick of his wrist, he cast a Disillusionment Charm, and Harry felt the magic settle over them. Even that felt like a caress along his spine, and he shivered under the warmth of Malfoy’s magic.
Potter let out a frustrated growl that startled Raul, the Minister’s secretary, as he walked past. The poor bloke dropped his file and almost dropped the coffee he carried with it. To add to the already alarming display of masculinity, Potter slammed his fist down on the table and said, “Where’s that damned map?”
“No, not that it’s any of your business.” Harry crossed his arms and gave her the look Hermione always gave him when he was being difficult. “Speaking of, why are you even asking me this?”
I smiled again, mostly because I was satiated even though my erection pulsed hungrily in my pants. It was just a bonus that ever since after I sucked him off at the Ministry thing, smiling at Malfoy made him blush. “Bye, Malfoy.”
, but how will we go about that?”
But Harry still couldn’t look at him. He kept his eyes on the moon. “You knew I had feelings for you then, but you never—and now, now you want to say something? On the night I asked you to help me make another man jealous?” Harry’s voice was sharp and he could feel anger rising in him.
“No, sorry.”
She was a quiet witch as far as I knew. Not that I spoke to her much. She was one of the many Harry Potter fans who beamed at me regularly when I came through training. Always asking me out. I tended to avoid those people as best I could. They only liked the celebrity of me, not the actuality of me.
Harry fumbled in his pocket for the Lock Box. Finally, he managed to pull it free and toss it to Malfoy. He caught it and placed it at the Succubus’s feet then said the incantation to open the Lock Box.
Under those circumstances, Draco had expected to feel worse off than he had prior to his bathroom pep talk. Even breathless as he was from being in such close proximity to Potter, Draco felt like someone had breathed new life into his lungs. Potter had tried...he wanted to kiss Draco. The thought felt preposterous, but also Draco let himself believe it were true for a moment as he stood outside the bathroom. It filled him with warmth.
“Will you shut it?” Harry asked, but decided not to wait for a reply. “Let’s go.” With that, Harry started off and didn’t look back to see if Malfoy was following him. He smirked as he heard a huff and then light footsteps behind him.
“Oh, shite,” Hermione cursed and then pressed my glasses to my face. They got caught on my ear and she adjusted them.
“Good match,” he called to Draco and he meant it. Draco had been in rare form that night. He flew with great control and speed. Harry suspected that Draco was practicing flying during the day sometime so he could beat Harry finally after a two weeks long losing streak.
“If the Russian Minister has this, why doesn’t he use it?”
“I’m in need of one particular potion and it has nothing to do with the bedroom, sorry to disappoint.” I ignored the impulse building in me to ask him why he stood me up yesterday at the party. That was a problem for another day. What I needed was the potion, not another distraction.
I heard it before I saw anything. The sound of hundreds of flies swarming, buzzing, in my ears. I focused harder. Closed my eyes tight and saw it. The man sobbing in front of the rock. His back hunched and shaking with each new cry. I still heard the buzzing but it was far away, or at least it sounded far away. The rest of the forest was turning to rot. The trees were black with their bark cracking off in patches. The ground under my feet was the only green patch left in this obscene vision. The man slammed his fist on the rock and the sound of his bones crunching against the stone made my stomach turn.
Malfoy scoffed. “Yeah right.”
“See, this is why I didn’t want to say anything.” Draco looked at Harry with profound annoyance that once might’ve been called a withering stare, but now Harry could see the affection in Draco’s eyes, he knew it wasn’t real annoyance. “It’s ridiculous, obviously. We’re friends, right, and it would mess all that up when it ended up being a terrible idea. And that’s assuming you’d want to kiss me back. Merlin, I hadn’t even considered you wouldn’t want to kiss me back. How horribly vain.”
In the cellar of the Manor, the Death Eaters had created a prison with cells and shackles, all to keep certain witches and wizards out of the way. The cells were small rooms that were charmed to keep their occupants from performing magic. It was quite clever and quite necessary, since, in the end, Potter and his friends ended up being more valuable alive than dead.
Ron considered me slowly. “Are you trying to get fired, Harry? Because you’ve always been a bit, you know, rash, but lately it seems like you’re more, I don’t know, more something. More careless. Like you’re on a mission to cause trouble for yourself. All these articles read like a man on a mission to ruin his own reputation.”
It certainly would bolster his status if the wizarding world's golden boy would say a few kind things about him, if he could even be bothered to think them in the first place. But even that small kindness seemed always slightly out of reach since Draco knew Mr. Potter’s opinion of him as was made unmistakably clear in the rejection of not one, but two letters.
“It means the Unspeakables know about the magical surges. They know the frequency of them is increasing and so is the strength of them, just like the boys.” I felt manic as I tried to explain the significance, but I needed to get this off my chest more than I realized. “It means, I’m right and that there is some kind of pattern to the surges, but I only had access to the underage ones—the ones they could pass off as underage magic usage which is normal—so I couldn’t make it out.”
“As much fun as it’s been, I don’t know if I’m not as okay with being one of many as I thought I would be,” he said. It looked like it too effort, too. He barely made eye contact with me as he spoke. His eyes darted everywhere but my face.
“Do not take that tone, Draco,” Lucius warned. His tone was ice. His eyes like glaciers, revealed nothing on the surface but hid multitudes below.
“Not quite. It is only impossible because no one has made it work, but then again, no wizard has been as powerful as the Dark Lord.”
“Oh, no, no, Potter. You have to work for it.”
“He finds me barely tolerable as was made clear from his behavior after the trial and with, not one, but two refusals for dinner. It is only that this ball is so mundane and filled with boring Ministry officials that he even desired to shower me with his attentions. I can no more see him happy to stand at my side than I can see myself happy to be with a man whose pride gets in the way of such politeness as accepting a dinner invitation. He is quite possibly the last man on earth I could ever truly see myself with.”
Draco smiled at her, sipping his drink. “I’m sure.”
“I said,” Malfoy started in a soft whisper by his ear, but then moved so he was now face to face with Harry, “that I would rather you figure out what makes a posh boy like me
Hermione was casting a Patronus. I watched her otter float off, up and away likely to the Ministry.
“Indifferent? Blimey, Hermione. How could he?”
“Yes, that's exactly what I'm getting at.” Potter caught his mouth again and ran his fingers down Draco's jawline, his fingers continuing down to undo the button of Draco's collar.
I felt my gut tighten. Of course the Ministry was covering more stuff up, I shouldn’t be surprised when they did the same thing when I told them Voldemort was back. “Run this by me one more time. There are magical surges happening to adults in Hogsmeade and graves being robbed?”
Her face went from mischief to innocence in the blink of an eye. “I don’t know what you mean, darling.” She twirled a strand of her hair in between her index and middle finger.
Moving in closer, Harry repeated himself again, “You’re beautiful.”
“It was enough.”
“Er, uh, well...I,” Potter stammered. He locked eyes with Draco. They blazed, wild and green.
I sat up straighter. “Yeah? Who?”
There was a collective
“That face. The face you always get before you do something rash.”
“Then why don’t you fuck me,” Harry said in a low moan. He started to unzip his pants, but Draco grabbed his hand to stop him. Gave him a slight shake of the head as if to say ‘not so fast’ and dragged his hand lightly over the bulge in Harry’s pants.
“Depends,” Harry said between two deep breaths. “Where are we on the whole ‘should I or shouldn’t I’ thing?”
There was a moment where Harry wondered if he should fight this thing without his partner, but thinking about the woman whose life had been lost the last time Harry tried to face this thing alone...he thought better.
not saying that to be an arse. It’s just the truth. You are always willing to suffer so others won’t. But an untested potion could fuck up your magic for the rest of your life if you aren’t careful.”
“Seems like a better thing to be remembered for.”
Ron sighed. “Yes, he’s smart and you’re smart, wahoo for new advances in potion making, but can we save the celebrating for later? We need Harry to look for magic in the cemetery before the potion wears off or before someone spots us all out here wandering a cemetery.”
Pansy licked her bottom lip, put down the file in her hand, and walked around the metal work table that held all manner of bubbling potions, some blue, other’s a sickly yellow, a few of them a verdant green that reminded Draco of Potter’s eyes. She came to stand directly in front of Potter and said, “It’s not ready. I told Robards we need another day to test the effects on a human subject.”
“You’re a pain in the arse, anyone ever tell you that?” Potter asked, opening the folder. Some of the tension eased out of his shoulders as he rested back in his chair.
Lamont looked down at the file he dropped and laughed. He kicked them one more time and stalked out of the bullpen. He turned back, scowling, and Reed jumped to attention, hustling over to him. It seemed like he had her trained up good. Reed always did strike me as a follower.
Harry is numbing the memories the Battle Memorial brought up with alcohol when he gets an unexpected visitor who has information on the magical surges.
“Potter, could you—could you move aside?” Draco said in an attempt to sound casual and polite; two things he had never successfully done with Potter.
“Actually, things do need to be submitted to Robards,” Draco snapped. His frustration bubbling up his throat. Potter didn’t have to be careful the way Draco did, not when he was the wizarding world’s savior. “Are you saying I should be more like you, then? An Auror who doesn’t know the difference between an M-123 form and an M-342? An Auror who ignores protocol and goes out without his partner to face a dangerous criminal and almost gets himself killed?”
Faintly, Harry heard a sound and turned to find Hagrid, who he assumed was the source of the noise, only to see Hagrid was leaning against a tree practically sleeping with his eyes open. If Hagrid was sleeping, then that meant Malfoy was humming and nothing seemed more unlikely to Harry.
I pulled her fingers loose. Her grip was tight for someone too drunk to walk a straight line. I searched her eyes and saw her pupils reacted normally to stimulus and the dim streetlights as we passed them. I whispered, “You’re sober?”
“I understand if you’re too scared or proper or whatever,” Potter said, interrupting Draco’s inner agonising, “but I’m doing this. With or without you makes no difference to me.”
“Potter, talk to me,” Draco said as he rushed to grab the Lock Box once it closed. He picked it up, it was cold to the touch and even trapped as she was—her magic lingered. Once he was sure she was locked away, he went to his partner
“I wouldn't go that far.”
“Psh, is it ‘cos I’m drunk?” Potter asked, pouting his lips.
“I’m not very good at parties.”
Draco knelt down next to Potter and saw the wound on his head gushing blood. He touched his partner’s face, feeling a rush of lust hit him. Potter’s skin was warm under his fingers. He didn’t flinch away, but instead leaned into Draco’s touch. The potion hadn’t worked its way out of their systems yet, that was all.
Robards didn’t turn around. “Go Reed.” He turned to Lamont. “Go with her and make sure the Unspeakables know about the issues with the trace spell.”
The Head Auror had his wand out, ready. “Potter, Malfoy?”
It was lunch before Harry knew it, and with the warm summer weather, many students were gathered in the courtyard. Ron and Hermione only managed to drag him outside after Harry was sure Draco wasn’t hiding somewhere in the Great Hall.
. He eyed Draco suspiciously, his dangerous green eyes searching Draco’s face. It was enough to make Draco forget Pansy was in the room.
As Draco locked eyes with Mr. Potter the room seemed to slow around him as if time itself were giving him an extra moment of Mr. Potter’s attentions. Draco watched Mr. Potter speaking to his companions. His many admirable features flooded Draco’s senses. Mr. Potter’s dark hair framed his olive-toned face and unkempt as it was, still managed to look handsome. His verdant eyes, searched the ballroom with apparent interest, alight with amiability. His supple lips, which he licked after sipping from his champagne flute, were the perfect specimens—like two soft tulip petals in spring.
“So, can we do this?” Potter asked eagerly.
“Thanks,” Draco said. His stomach was flapping about like a fish out of water and here Potter was commenting on art like he was in a museum on a Sunday afternoon. “Potter, are you sure you want to be my partner?”
The twisted smile returned to her face, shattering a bit more of her hold on Harry. His head still felt clouded, but he managed to shout, “
Harry swallowed hard, his arousal coursing through him like wind in a tunnel. Okay, okay, so there
Harry felt his stomach sink. Draco’s suddenly rejection of their ritual of empty challenges struck him like a stinging hex. Maybe Harry had imagined the bond he felt between them. Maybe he was a fool to think that they could ever be anything more than what they already were.
She shook her head. “No, when did you begin having visions. Not these specific ones, but in general. How old were you?”
“So what next?” Draco asked, trying to keep himself steady, both physically and emotionally.
“Is because you were Death Eater?”
It was the same map that had been behind Robards in the conference room, only smaller. All of the recent death locations were marked in red. Potter picked up one of Draco’s quills
I nodded, not sure I could speak without sounding jealous.
I stumbled out of bed, the alcohol clouding my vision for a moment and made my way into the dark hallway. There was a creak behind me and the hairs on my neck stood up.
Draco didn’t respond. He didn’t move either. Their hands still holding the snitch in place. Draco only blinked a few times in quick succession and then opened his mouth like he was going to say something, but then didn’t.
“The forest, Hagrid, really?” Harry asked.
“Count to ten,” Draco told himself as he watched his reflection in the bathroom mirror. The panic was apparent in his ragged breathing and high-pitched voice as he spoke to himself. The gentle sway of the ship on the Black Lake made him feel nauseous again. There were dark circles under his eyes and his normally pale skin was blotchy and red under the dim lantern lighting.
Though Draco was positive Potter hadn’t really been asking him, he answered, “Like I said, you wouldn’t have to go through this every time you needed something if you just organised your desk. It’s a wonder you get anything done.”
I had to get some air. All of this planing and future talk and ministry bull shit was making my blood boil and I was really considering flooing home for a stiff drink.
Another long pause. “No, Harry. I just worry about you. I worry you never properly dealt with things and when you get upset, you drink.”
“I don’t do tradition well.” Potter’s hand fell and he stepped back a little, giving Draco space to breathe. Well, space is a bit generous as the bathroom was the size of a broom cupboard. Potter simply stepped back enough that they would not bump elbows as they undressed.
Potter nodded. “Makes sense. Blocking the attraction to the thing with something else. Okay, good, but what if you’re not attracted to anyone?”
Just what I needed, a lecture about my life choices. “Malfoy isn’t important right now. Leave it be.”
She laughed. “Maybe. I thought saving lives was all that motivated you. At least it used to, but maybe your priorities shifted into brutal assaults and self-destruction? If that’s all you care about, I could be barking up the wrong tree.”
The ship had a strange, skeletal look to it, Draco noted as he made his way around the main deck where the party raged on. No doubt there were as many ghosts roaming the decks of this ship as there were in the castle, though Draco had not run into one yet and he was almost disappointed.
“This place is going to hell,” Lamont said. “The edicts going through about the Secrecy Statue are one thing, but I can’t believe he’s just getting a hearing. A hearing, Angie? Anyone else would have been sent to Azkaban if they did what he did.”
“Wh-what?”
I nodded and we both started working our way back through the maze. There was a clear enough path through, so we didn’t have to do much more than follow back the way I came in.
“I’d probably call it a gulp, but yes,” Harry said, placing his now empty cup on the ground in front of him.
Up until this morning, the thought of talking to her, or even walking past her, had felt like acid in his stomach. However, today he found his feet easily carried him to her. When he arrived, she was seated and looking up at the sky. The sun highlighted her face, making her already pale features seem washed in brightness.
He didn’t know what to say, so he blurted out the first thing that came to mind. “Uh, well, at least I’m rich, right? She’ll like that bit.”
“Of course, Potter. I can handle anything you can.” Malfoy still refused to look him in the eye, now staring down at his shoes. “I'm good at my job. I
“I think so,” she answered, dropping his hands. “I want that if you do.”
“That isn’t really our biggest issue right now.”
Harry looked at Draco and thought about that one saying about how ‘the more things change, the more they stay the same’ or some other nonsense. The war changed a lot, namely Draco. He turned on Voldemort in the end, becoming integral in Harry’s ultimate defeat of the dark wizard. He took responsibility for the part he did take in the war, and was on probation for it. Between that, and the apology tour Draco went on, he was almost completely unrecognizable as the boy who had made so much of his childhood complicated. The thing the war hadn’t changed about Draco was his ability to get right under Harry’s skin no matter what and drive him absolutely mad, even when he was being nice—or at least nice for Draco.
“Nope. You must be hearing things. Maybe it was the wind?”
Ron’s face was turning red. It did that when he was frustrated. “They obliviated Robards, too. Probably Lamont and Reed, as well as any auror at the party. Would have done us if Robards hadn’t tricked them into thinking he already did us.”
I looked down at the upturned dirt again, ignoring Ron’s question. Yesterday when I touched that spot, I saw flashes of that man and the beast. I could still feel that white hot pain. I didn’t want to do it again. The flashes were unsettling and I was afraid of seeing my mother again with those black eyes. Plus there was no guarantee that it would even work a second time. I had felt a pull to the spot before, touched it without even thinking. I felt no pull now, but I had to at least try. With my wand in one hand I knelt down and touched the ground, hoping to see something and hoping just as hard that I didn’t.
“What’s that about Gryffindor brutes?” Ron called from the other small group which consisted of Dean and George. They were parked near the food table, all with tiny white plates full of finger foods held up to their mouths.
Lucius leaned down and lightly gripped the Dark Lord’s hand before placing a chaste kiss upon his knuckles. “My Lord, welcome.”
Harry blinked a few times, confused, before taking the seat next to Draco. He sat closer than necessary—so close that their knees touched.
Harry blinked twice and urged his feet forwards. He followed Draco one step behind, his heart pounding, his stomach fluttering. There was nothing left for it but to own up to his feelings. That hand in his was the last straw to his denial.
Malfoy stood next to me with his hands over his head. He was taking in deep, long breaths. “Fucking bollocks.”
“Merlin, you are impossible.” Malfoy rolled his eyes, but there was a fire in them. “Yes.”
Harry and Ron head back to the party where the find their friends have all been obliviated by the Unspeakables.
“I was actually thinking of leaving after this drink.”
“Potter, what are you doing?”
She clicked her tongue at him, reaching out her slender fingers to tilt his chin up—her deep brown eyes, searching his face. “You really believe that, don’t you, my pet?”
Before he could get out the rest of what he intended to say—all the reasons this was madness, all the reasons it shouldn’t happen—Potter pulled him into a kiss that was so hungry, so desperate, that Draco lost his breath.
Harry
Hermione rolled her eyes and ignored the professor. “So Neville, how are classes?”
Some of the Aurors stood up, assuming the meeting was over, Harry among them, and as he stood, he saw something on the map that he would never have thought of if he hadn’t been complaining to Ron about Malfoy—the deaths all seemed to line up with a Ley Line leading into a nexus. He wasn’t sure why that was important, not yet, but they were definitely all Ley Lines.
“You’re right. I don’t know what he was going through. I barely know what you wen’t through because you never talk about it, except to say that it was bad. What I do know is, if we break the law too, how are we any better than the criminals?”
“I suppose,” Mr. Potter answered and pulled Draco back in and began to sway again, “but they clearly affected you and therefore, are of consequence to me.”
“Rematch. Tomorrow. Same time?”
“What the...” He took a look around the room and his eyes fell on the Succubus. A scream ripped from his body.
“I did.” He looked as surprised as I felt. “I cannot believe I fucking followed you into this damned forest. I’ve snapped. That’s it. I have finally lost it.” He was mumbling to himself as he tried to step over a fallen tree, but he lost his footing and stepped on the tree. It was rotted through and covered in moss. His foot went through the rotten bark with a snap.
“Why?”
Draco watched as Potter unceremoniously made his way back to his cluster of mates who stood just outside of the captain's quarters on the open deck: Weasley, Granger, Girl Weasley, and the rest of the Gryffindor lot. Then laughed as if he hadn’t just mucked up Draco’s entire reality.
“You disgust me,” Potter spat the words at Draco as he entered the room.
“No fang marks,” Harry found himself saying. “Oh, and there’s the fact that every victim was shriveled up with all their Life Energy gone.”
Draco brought his shaking hands up to Harry’s face, cupping his cheeks. He tilted his forehead to rest on Harry’s. He breathed unsteady breaths, and then kissed Harry softly on the lips. “I love you, too, you idiot.”
“Well, the faster we do this, the faster we can go inside and get warm,” Harry choked out the words all at once. Malfoy was watching him with a deviously curious look on his face. Though how anyone managed to look devious or curious when half their face was hidden behind the hideous silver and green of a Slytherin scarf, Harry hadn’t the slightest.
“It’s okay, Draco. You don't need to pretend with me. I see it. I understand.”
“Just ask me whatever inane question you came to ask, so I can tell you to fuck off and leave me alone.”
I took a sip of the tea and wished it was whiskey. “I’m sure plenty of students fainted when they saw you in that suit, Mr. Longbottom.” I was flirting and it felt damned good to do it.
“Yes, perfectly, Father,” Draco said through gritted teeth. He had meant to say—
It was Hermione and she sounded chipper. I really hated people who could be chipper this early in the morning. “No, no. I was up,” I grumbled, blinking the sleep from my eyes. I’d had barely seven hours of sleep in the past forty-eight hours and I wanted to kill Hermione for sounding well rested. If I didn’t get some sleep soon, I might actually act on those impulses.
“So, then what happened? Why didn’t you seem as affected? Every time I touched something, my whole body felt it. It was even more intense when we touched, and I sort of remember Parkinson saying that if you were around someone you found attractive that it would be worse, so I guess what I’m getting at is...”
The mechanisms sprang into action, the metal box unfolding like a flower in bloom. The sounds of gears turning and metal scraping was like music to Harry’s ears. They had her. It was over. They’d done it.
“Well, I guess that’s my answer then.” Harry pulled away from Draco. “I have to, uh, I have to go. Exams in the morning.” Except, Harry didn’t move toward the stairs that led to his room, he turned on his heel, grabbed a bottle of fire whisky from the cabinet where the eighth years stored their community contraband, and stormed out of the common room, his heart in his throat, hot tears streaming down his face, and opened the bottle and relished the burn of alcohol as he drank.
Draco started. Potter was talking to him. Potter was talking to him and he seemed perfectly in control of himself, very much leading Draco to believe he really must have imagined the scene in the privy because
before Draco actually began to answer his questions earnestly. At first, Draco would answer his questions with a scowl and skeptical eyes that seemed to say,
Draco moaned into Harry’s mouth, “Let me fuck you…gods, I need to be inside you right now.”
“But why haven’t you asked him out at least?” Ron asked and Harry had to admit, he had wondered the exact same thing of himself. In the last six months, he had grown feelings at an exorbitant rate. It was nearly instantaneous. Subsequently, he didn’t really have an answer other than, he was scared. Of rejection, or of judgement, he wasn’t truly sure. Possibly a mixture of both, he surmised.
She made it a question, so I answered. “Yes.”
“That is shite, tell me the truth.”
“Yes, you have made that abundantly and boringly clear, Potter,” Draco drawled as he surveyed his captive. Draco noticed that the man had new cuts on his wrists and ankles where he clearly attempted to escape his binds. And the muggle way by the looks of it.
“If only that weren’t the case,” Harry muttered and then adjusted himself in the chair. It was wooden like the table and had a floral pillow tied to the seat. As far a chairs went, this one, Harry decided, was not very comfortable. “Anyway, like I was saying; Ginny and I officially ended things right after the war ended. I think we both realized we were holding onto something that wasn’t there anymore. It wasn’t like we didn’t care for each other, but we also didn’t see a future together.”
. If his father ever caught wind of it, Draco was sure he would be whipped within an inch of his life. That had, after all, been his father’s promise when an unfortunate incident the summer between sixth and seventh year revealed that he and Blaise Zabini had been more than friends to his fathers utter disgust.
“I don’t care about what color the room is, Harry.”
“Right better choice than mine,” Girl Weasley chimed in, walking to stand near Potter. “I had the hots for Mr. I Have a God Complex, over here.” She nudged Potter in the ribs and he laughed, putting an arm around her shoulders. Draco never felt so out of his depth in his life and he shared a home with the darkest wizard of their time. He almost thought that was easier than trying to be casual and calm next to a group of people who had never liked him. He didn’t know what to say, so he stood there and watched Potter interact with them.
Really, he wasn’t even sure what he was asking.
Harry, eager to have his lips on Draco’s so he could know if this crush was ill-fated, offered another interpretation. “Say it happens like that, but it’s
“It’s good, mostly.” Neville smiled again, but it didn’t quite reach his eyes. He lowered his voice and said, “I get unbearably sad sometimes. Being here, I mean. Where it all—”
In a hurry, Draco shoved the potion back into the cabinet. He stood, wiping his hands off on the front of his robes and look at himself in the mirror again. “You don't need it.”
“And some things do.” Potter smiled down at him, responding to Draco’s musings about Potter. “You waited?”
Once we were through the floo, I locked it until morning. I didn’t want any calls or visitors. Especially since the Ministry had clearance to my home and the people who were behind all of this were the exact government for which I worked. And I thought I was collecting ironies before.
“Sorry, Potter. Snooze, you lose,” Draco drawled. His smoke-gray eyes widening in challenge. He was casually dressed for Draco, wearing only a long sleeved shirt that had, of all things, a band name on it that Harry had never heard of called Ten of Swords. He wore dark jeans and white trainers.
That’s when he felt it, her magic, falling over him like a silk sheet. It was silky, it was erotic, and he wanted to bathe in it forever. Her eyes fixed on him, and her smile softened into something devilishly sensual. The quirk of her red-lined lips made Harry stand at attention. He took a step forward, moving to her. There was a nagging voice at the back of his mind that told him this was bad, that he should probably cast a spell, stop her—but it felt so
At Dean and Seamus’s party, Harry gets distracted from his mission to sneak off and check on his lead about the magical surges by his desire for Malfoy.
“And she asked me if I was with Charlie Weasley.”
books. I’ll even refrain from having Gryffindor colors in our room since I know you hate them and if it’s between you and Gryffindor colors, I pick you. I pick you. I’ll pick you every time.”
“Thanks for the pep talk.”
“Maybe you will listen then.”
, one life is enough to sustain them for over a year. They have no need to kill so frequently. The bargain they make with their Demon is for immortality through the sacrifice of one life a year. They give up everything for this, their magic, their morality, their ability to pass on to anywhere other than Hell. Most live a few centuries before the Demon will collect their soul. It makes no logical sense that one would kill so many like this, calling attention to itself when it’s been getting by under the radar.
“Why are you sulking in the dungeons when the Harry Potter parade is about to start? Don’t you know all your adoring fans are waiting?” Malfoy asked. He stayed on the last step, not making any attempt to move closer to me.
I marveled at Hermione’s wit, not for the first time. “So you remember the scream?”
There was that word again.
Hermione took my wrist. “Harry, we all know you like to be the martyr.” She paused when I opened my mouth to protest, but she shook her head. “I’m
All this deliberation could be for nought.”
Draco’s lips quirked into a smirk. “How very thorough of you.” His fingers drummed on Harry’s neck, still holding his head steady.
“That’s not fair. I can’t control how people react to me,” Potter said, sounding sulky.
Potter snatched up the map. “I don’t have time to sit around and theorise just now, but I agree, there’s no way normal magic works, but Ley Lines are different, ancient. Maybe it found a way to tap into them. I don’t know, but I do know it will definitely kill again tonight. There aren’t any more Ley Lines that need activating before… what? Wh—why are you looking at me like that?”
“The Dark Lord was not please by your absence.”
“Hey, where’s Neville?” I asked just to have something to say. Something else to focus on beside Dean and Seamus smiling dreamily at one another.
Yet there he was, his green eyes wide, his chest heaving—watching. The knowledge sent a chill down Draco’s spine and he involuntarily twitched forward, shoving himself deeper into Nikola’s mouth. The motion seemed to encourage Nikola to swallow him deeper, to suck harder.
“I may be tipsy, but I’m not stupid enough to drink outside in the freezing cold without a warming charm.”
“Only for a moment,” Harry agreed, letting his fingertips make contact first. Malfoy hissed and pulled his head back, likely because Harry’s hand was freezing after hovering there for so long. However, he calmed and let Harry continue.
Images flashed through his mind of pinning Draco down on the pitch, the dew of the grass moist on their bodies as they tangled themselves around one another, Harry’s hands free to roam the pale expanse of Draco’s thighs. Free to pull at the hem of Draco’s shirt and slip across the taut muscles of his abdomen.
I felt my pulse quicken at his insinuation. I was already more interested in this conversation than any of the conversations I’d had today. This back and forth with Malfoy had always set my nerves on edge. Fighting with him had been a decent substitute to almost dying at the hands of Voldemort. At least Malfoy didn’t pretend I was perfect, or ask me to be because it fit the fantasy of Harry Potter that he grew up with. Around him, I didn’t have to hide like I did with my friends. Irony of all ironies.
In response, Harry dragged his lips languorously up from Draco’s collar bone to that spot behind the ear that made Draco groan with want. “Seems like someone is much more inclined to be late than he is letting on.”
Pansy turned to Draco and made a face that said ‘talk some sense into your partner before I hit him with a Bat-Bogey Hex.’ If Draco were a smarter man, he wouldn’t push the subject and he would let Potter run off and be the rash, pig-headed hero he was born to be, but deep down, Draco knew he wouldn’t stop Potter. And he certainly wouldn’t let him run into a Succubus den without backup either.
“The prophet,” Potter asserted. “I don’t use any towels after. I air dry.”
After learning about the leaders Skeeter had, Harry wants to jump right on the case...but life gets in the way again when Hermione calls and reminds him of a party he needs to attend.
“Hi,” she echoed, leaning in to lay a soft kiss on his lips. She smelled nice, not flowery like the rest of the greenhouse, but like oranges and a summer breeze. Harry took comfort in the familiarity.
Malfoy sucked in a deep breath. “Sorry, no. Thank you, but I...” He turned his head slightly toward Harry.
“When both of you hold the mirror it will activate. Have a wonderful day,” Angela said and then looked behind them to the next people in line. “Next?”
“There was no time to call you,” Potter spat his excuse at Draco, the same one he’d been using since they were partnered up. “I had to act before she got away.”
Charlie didn’t say anything for a while. Harry finally looked over at him and saw the man’s face screwed up in pain. “After Luna's article mentioned you liking me back then, I figured it was my last shot. I thought maybe if you knew I fancied you, then maybe you wouldn’t even care about Malfoy.”
She released him, but only after biting his bottom lip and slowly dragging her teeth off. “Stop? Are you sure? I can taste your arousal, and it’s surprisingly sweet despite your inability to admit your feelings. Don’t you want all that I can give you?”
Potter.
“We are,” Malfoy said, with a hint of amusement in his voice. “What gave it away? The ghastly robes?”
George, who was in the middle of sipping his drink, coughed loudly and pounded a fist on his chest at my words. “Merlin, umm, I think I hear Charlie calling my name. Bye.”
He fingered the vials carefully, trying to avoid clinking them together. Even though it was a one person bathroom, Draco was afraid of someone catching him rifling through the potions. They might think he was up to something. Most people thought he was planning the next big Death Eater uprising even when he used a simple
“Move in together?” Draco asked, a bitter laugh escaping him. “Tell everyone that their hero is dating a villain?”
“You don’t know me, Skeeter.”
“I could have loved you, too, Harry.”
“Try to have fun. You are young, start over. Always time to start over.” Draco looked away and watched Potter and his friends again. They looked happy. He felt a jolt of jealousy and realized that he wanted that. He wanted
Wand raised, Harry aimed. But he hardly formed the word,
“She left out one thing though,” Potter said.
Doing his best to remain aloof, Draco decided to play with Potter—to put pressure on him in just the right way to make Potter foam at the mouth. “I’m not sure I know to whom you are referring?”
“Okay, I think maybe now I need to be filled in all the way,” Malfoy asserted.
There was a pause in which Harry was sure he had just ruined weeks of building up whatever it was between them. It had been difficult enough to get Draco to believe he didn’t have some hidden agenda, that he was just trying to get to know him. Harry couldn’t imagine how hard it would be to build trust all over again.
“Fair enough,” I said because it was true and if I let on how much I didn’t want it in the papers then maybe she would try and use it against me. I wouldn’t give her any ammo to use against me.
Draco didn't let Potter finish that thought. He crashed his lips to meet Potter's and lost himself in the taste of his partner. Things were heading in a very satisfactory direction before Potter broke away and said, “It was clear that we were both right about why the potion affected me so much, right?”
I looked down at my hands and saw them shaking. Sweat beaded at my hair line and I felt a droplet slide down my temple. “I was thinking. Sorry.”
“Wow, cocky,” Harry laughed. He was doing that around Draco a lot lately, wasn’t he? Draco laughed, too. Their eyes met and for a moment, Harry felt some of that uneasy feeling in his gut uncoil.
It was so jarring because up until that point Harry would have described Draco’s face as being set in a sort of curious scowl, which is already a semi-frowny look. But at Harry’s words, Draco’s face settled into even more of a frown.
There was a long, silent moment as Draco took a deep, long breath. He let it out in a shudder. “I’m thinking ‘should’.”
At his side, Pansy sighed again. Her body next to his was familiar and he felt himself gaining his composure back in increments. Social events had always been the hardest thing for him after the war, as Pansy was well aware. All the people. All the pretending. It was wholly due to Pansy that Draco managed to get through them at all, so when she left him alone his mask started to slip away to reveal the unpleasantness within—the unpleasantness that was sure to convince Mr. Potter that Draco was unworthy of his attentions.
“I’m afraid it is a boring answer. I was reminded that I needed take a pepper up potion so I could keep up with you lushes. I found one in the captain's private bathroom.”
“What do you know about those?”
As the song picked up, Charlie moved in closer, so they were standing almost flush against one another. “Remember after the war, when we all played quidditch in the backyard?”
I opened my eyes to find Hermione and Ron staring at me. Concern all over their faces. It annoyed me. I glanced back over to Ginny and Parkinson and knew I would have to face them sooner or later, but like any functional adult I had to try avoiding it. “I’m in the mood now, Malfoy.”
“I’m not trying to get attention. I’m trying to save lives. These surges are happening. They are affecting adults as well as children. Don’t you care why?”
“I don’t,” Draco answered with a flick of the wrist. After a moment, he stood up so they were toe to toe and now, eye to eye.
Pansy held up a hand. “Even if I had time to test the potion, there would still be some expected side effects, and casting will take more focus than usual.”
Draco took up the quill after Potter placed it down next to the form. A huge part of him was screaming ‘don’t do this, he will figure out your secret.’ If he thought being Potter’s partner was difficult now, he couldn’t imagine what it would be like working with him if Potter found out how Draco felt about him. It was almost enough to make him back down.
That did not just happen, Harry thought and he tried to shake the moment from his memory by actually shaking his head in disbelief. Rather a stupid idea, considering the amount of alcohol he had consumed. Now, on top of his nerves being a mess, he felt like he was going to barf.
Harry shrugged. “
“So if Hermione just went, that means it’s…” Longbottom started, ignoring the quiet that settled in the group after Granger acknowledge Draco.
Skeeter looked around the sitting room and nodded. “Oh, that was your lovely house elf’s doing. He said you liked it unnaturally bright.”
Many of them found his silky pale skin reminded them of the first snowfall—pure, untouched. Others attributed his beauty to the striking white-blond hair which made them think of mystical creatures like the Sirens in Greek Mythology, pulling them into his trap—mesmerized. And of course, there was his slim build. It made him androgynous. He was tall and toned, but not overly so and this meant when he let his hair get long, he looked very feminine.
“I, um, I thought we were coming to the party together,” she said. Her voice unsure. “I guess I’m remembering it wrong. You two had stuff to finish up at the Ministry. Silly me.” She smiled weakly and took a long swig of her drink.
“Get up, you dolt,” Malfoy spat in his direction and then let off a string of defensive spells that lit the room up like a Christmas tree. Harry realised that Malfoy was trying to keep the Succubus away from the victim.
The Durmstrang ship was described as a magical marvel by his father. He heard enough about it fourth year as his father complained that the ship must break every secrecy law the Ministry ever wrote because there was no way to conceal something of this magnitude. It was the only thing his father complained about more that year than he did about how Potter managed a way into the tournament and so how come Draco had not been clever enough to do it.
Two cups of tea and entirely too much bacon later, Draco was ready to face his father. The anxiety still there, buzzing below the surface, ready to swarm forward at a moments notice. However, his stomach was full for the first time in a month and between the energy from sleeping a full night and the energy from breakfast, Draco felt new.
This last line of thinking persuaded Draco to write another letter, outlining the same sentiments as he previously wrote. He expressly begged Mr. Potter’s pardon for not receiving his first letter of thanks sooner and explained that it must be lost somewhere.
I stared him down. “Then who is it on, Ron? That man is dead. I could have helped him, but he was killed, most likely by whatever that beast is from my visions.” I was beginning to sweat, so I fanned my face but that didn’t help. Summer was coming early this year. The heat was humid and thick. It was the kind of heat that felt like it rested on your skin like another layer of clothes.
“I had to stop her.”
Hermione and Neville both laughed. It made me feel good for a moment, being with them, being at Hogwarts with my friends. I tried to enjoy it, but it faded just as quickly as it came about. I died here. I literally died out on the spot where the memorial was being held. I think people forget that. They see me standing and smiling and all-around alive and forget that I died in that battle and sometimes, I am not sure if all of me came back.
“I wasn’t thinking,” Harry lied. Usually he would have said something defensive, hurled an insult Malfoy’s way, but the potion and the Succubus’ words had him off kilter. That, and Malfoy’s annoyingly rosy cheeks.
“Shouldn’t we be able to say his name by now? He’s been dead five years.”
nervous.
Draco was practically out of breath after jogging from the elevator. Potter had made a run for it as soon as the door opened and didn’t stop until he was skidding past the Potions lab door. Now, Potter was catching his breath as he waved his map at the Potions Master on duty, Pansy Parkinson, Draco’s dearest friend.
The man, still moaning under the Succubus, reached up for her breasts, but she slapped his hands out of the way and sat up straighter. She ceased her hip gyrations, and Harry felt her push her magic at them again. And again, the potion rippled along his skin, flooding him with Malfoy’s scent and the contented hum he made every time he sipped his tea, keeping her out of his mind. He was going to buy Parkinson a drink after this. Maybe two.
“Dance with me, Mr. Malfoy.” Without waiting for a response, Mr. Potter stepped forward and extended a hand—palm up. With a deep breath, Draco placed his hand in Mr. Potter’s. His other hand fell to Mr. Potter’s shoulder. Sliding his other hand around Draco’s waist, Mr. Potter pulled their bodies closer together. It felt odd to dance in the rain while no music played, but the feeling of having Mr. Potter’s body so near his was enough to make him forget his own name.
Draco let out a huff. “Fine.”
Pulling back slightly, Mr. Potter looked Draco in the eyes. His face went stern and he stopped swaying, but left his hands wrapped around Draco. “I never received such letters as those. If I had, I would have heartily accepted.”
“Lost track of the time? If only we all could afford such a luxury as that.”
Malfoy smiled slowly, it started in his eyes and then spread across his whole face like the slow rise of curtains on a stage, and finally dropped the snowball he had been holding mid-throw. It made a plonk as it hit the fresh powdering. “It is soft, Potter, but I am still a little confused.”
Before he could stop himself, Harry said,“I wanted you to.” He had fancied Charlie back then and he knew that Charlie had to have known. They had never talked about it, but after the war, Charlie and Harry had leaned on one another without meaning to; never physically, but emotionally.
“It was someone you…let’s say, it was someone you were involved with. I obliviated the information from her mind once I retrieved it. And I expect you will do the same to me once our meeting is finished.”
I turned to face Neville and saw a little bit of my own feelings reflecting back at me though his eyes. He’d tried to make it a joke, but I could sense the undercurrent of sadness. “Nev, you’re insane if you don’t think this many people love you. You’re one of the best people I know.”
“I like the two of you for each other. We spent a lot of time together working on his potion, you know? Lots of lunches. He’s actually quite funny, not to mention absolutely striking.”
Potter stopped kissing him and stood back—looking Draco in the eyes. There was a twinkle or something mischievous in that look. “Is that a challenge?”
“Fresh is best,” she said with a smile. “Plus the forest is so full of magic that it sort of balances out my own magic. My mind is quietest in here.”
Malfoy bristled. “We are not friends Potter. Just because I was bored at the Ministry Fundraiser and let you suck me off in the coat room does not mean we are anything resembling friends.”
Hermione showed great restraint when she didn’t try to correct Ron. “Are you interested in someone? Like as more than a hook up?”
“Don’t act like you care about that. I see it now. Your apathy toward the war. You really only ever cared about being powerful, not about the war itself. All your bullying, all your choices—they served your interests, not his. Even this. These meetings. It’s more for you than him.”
Even without words, Draco managed to get under his skin to the point where Harry simply wanted to catch the snitch just to rub it in Draco’s face that he had. With renewed attention, Harry scanned the pitch. He never did understand why most seekers moved around when searching for the snitch, when really, it was probably easier to spot when standing still.
The pair had been inseparable since childhood much like Draco and Pansy, but even more so since each of their divorces. Seems the Weasley clan shut ranks and Mr. Potter and Ms. Granger were left to lean upon one another.
And what had once been an even match in flying was starting to become balanced in Draco’s favor. He flew with such abandon and with such fluidity. It was that night, among the snow fall and the quiet winter air that Harry realized he was in love. He had almost gotten up the courage to ask Draco out, but in the end, he chickened out, assuming that Draco would never reciprocate his feelings.
Robards cracked his neck. “Auror Read, that is all well and good, but if you could hold off the commentary until I am finished?”
,” Harry cursed under his breath. It was his turn to be caught off guard by the overwhelming sexual tension that was building between their bodies like the ebbing of the tide against the shore.
“I’ll… send it up to him now.” Pansy eyed Potter for a moment and then smirked at Draco before going over to a filing cabinet. She flicked through until she found the form she was looking for, pulled it out and placed it on her desk. With her quill in hand, she began filling it out. After a moment, she sighed and said, “Hold on, I need to go get my boss's signature, too. I’ll just be a minute.” And then she was out the door.
Tonight, Harry was trying to be less wild so he could stay sharp. Usually, he participated in the wildness. Ginny always made sure of that as his semi-permanent plus-one. “The league captains think it’s good for us all to let off steam together. Helps promote good sportsmanship, or whatever.”
I nodded, unable to form words for some reason. The darkness of the cloud persisted and then rain fell in hot, heavy sheets. I blinked and staggered backward into Malfoy who was still holding his champagne flute. His eyes were wide with fear.
Draco laughed eventually, obviously deciding that Harry had to be joking. His laugh, his smile, those lips…
,” Potter growled, pointing the hand that held the bottle in Draco’s general direction. All the panic Draco had coursing through his body seemed to bubble at the surface when Potter spoke. If he could just scoot by Potter, then he could get off this damned ship without anyone taking notice. After all, Luna had only invited him to the party out of pity.
Draco smiled at this remark. He could barely help himself. Mr. Potter was more agreeable than any other man in the hall and he was standing in a corner of the room engaging in light conversation with Draco. It was nearly impossible to avoid feeling special.
“Draco, you will not speak to me in such a manner. Do you understand?”
Ron grabbed my arm and dragged me to my feet. “You okay?”
It was never my choice. That’s the part everyone forgets. I was raised to kill Voldemort. No one asked me if I was capable of it, or if I wanted to do it. Everything was planned, from where and how I was brought up, keeping me unaware of my magical abilities, to how I had to die in order to save everyone. It was just decided before I could even eat solid foods that I would face down the darkest wizard of my time all because he didn’t
“Agreed,” both Hermione and Malfoy answered. They smiled at the coincidence.
I liked her books because the heroine always got the happy ending I had been promised. The one where all was well and I married Ginny and moved on from the war just like Ron and Hermione did. Unrealistic though it was, in an odd way reading about it brought me comfort and comfort was so rare anymore. I took it when I found it, even if it came from the mind of a woman who used to ensure I had a shitty time in school.
His arousal had been a surprise the first time he struck Potter. Not once had Draco ever considered Potter sexually. He considered him as an enemy, as an annoyance, but never as someone attractive. Though it was
It was this hope which afforded him the strength of character necessary to compose a letter to Mr. Potter outlining his deep, unfettering gratitude for his help in securing his freedom. He let his pen glide across the page in near ecstasy as he proclaimed that he had never seen Mr. Potter’s equal in eloquence in speech, nor in his affability. And upon closing the letter, made for an invitation to host Mr. Potter at his new estate, which was small in comparison to the Manor that he lost, but was comfortable enough to keep a cook and therefore provide Mr. Potter with a decent meal if he were so inclined to accept the invitation.
Naturally, Harry wanted to prove Malfoy wrong. So naturally, he had suggested that Malfoy put his money where his mouth was and who better to prove it on than Harry himself?
going on anyway?”
Hopefully, it quelled whatever doubt Draco had about him. Hopefully, Draco realized all these months, he had been flirting with him. Harry remembered one night in particular: it was a few weeks ago, before Draco started dating that bloke. The quidditch match got canceled due to a snow storm. Harry had been pissed because he really needed the release that playing afforded him. He had a particularly bad day at work and wanted to let off steam.
Skeeter tilted her head to one side and looked at me the way an owner looks at a puppy who isn’t house trained yet. With a mixture of pity and superiority. “I think we both know you don’t enjoy being like that.” She gestured at my entire person. “The meaningless sex, the drinking, the fighting. It’s a call for help really.”
Draco had a moment to consider every reason why he shouldn’t follow after the man who managed to complicate even his breakfast orders before he opened his drawer, grabbed his Auror standard Lock Box, and jogged after Potter.
“Sir,” Potter said. “What are you doing here?”
“The journal of Vseslav of Polotsk. He was a sorcerer of great power rumored to have created a spell that removes the magic permanently from a wizard, transferring it to the caster. The task will be more difficult now that he suspects that was what Goyle was after.”
“If you want the potion, then accept that I’m coming or else you can leave empty handed.”
The green flames of the Floo flickered as he stepped through into the lobby of the Ministry expecting to see Malfoy waiting for him, but his partner was nowhere to be seen. Curious. Well, not so curious. Malfoy had just confessed that he was attracted to Harry and he hadn’t seemed too happy about admitting it. Could he have travelled home without Harry realising?
Still straddling him, Draco took his hands and put them on Harry’s chest which was rising and falling in quick, short breaths. Draco’s hands were shaking. “I feel, uh, like we should maybe revisit this again when we haven’t been drinking. Make sure it’s something we both really want.”
They kissed for so long, Draco felt his lips start to get raw, but he wouldn’t be the one to stop this kiss. Eventually, there was a knock at the door and a muffled voice calling out to
“Cock and balls,” Potter grunted as he leaned back on the brick wall next to Draco. He pushed his glasses up with his index and thumb to pinch his nose. “Portkeys always suck, but was it as bad for you as it was for me? I felt like I was being flayed alive. This potion is no joke.”
I felt my face get hot. Did George and Malfoy have a secret joke? The possibility made my fists clench at my side. “Owl incident?”
“These lines are terrible,” Hermione started. “I told Shacklebolt we needed to work on streamlining portkey travel.”
The Succubus stopped pulling the Life Energy from Harry and set her gaze on Malfoy. He held up his hands in surrender. His wand was no longer there. Harry wondered if that was what Malfoy had dropped in his pocket, but then it didn’t feel like a wand. It was heavier and more round and, Merlin, it was the Lock Box. Malfoy must have a plan, right?
A half hour later, Draco broke their unspoken pact of silent wallowing and said, “I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”
Without thinking, Harry reached his hand up, brushing Draco’s tear away with the knuckle of his index finger. “Draco…”
It was Draco Malfoy; ex-rival, ex-Death Eater, and current thorn in my side. He wore a beige suit that looked almost white with a white button up underneath. Like Neville, he forwent the tie and went for the whole unbuttoned, casual look. I sort of hated that I didn’t consider that an option. My tie was making me feel claustrophobic.
As Malfoy smirked, he launched his next snowball directly for Harry’s gut. It landed and Harry let out an oof. The snowball was rolled so tightly that it actually hurt a bit. Like getting hit in the gut with a tennis ball. The noise was more reflexive than anything. Each of them managed to get a few more hits in before they were almost standing on top of one another—panting.
“Yes.”
“Hmm, you know what? I think you might have told me once or twice. Or was it three times? Memory’s a bit foggy.”
“Come on, Draco, say you will. Let’s do it.”
In spite of himself, Harry thought about how this must look. The pair of them whispering and standing inches apart in a semi-dark corner of the Great Hall. The holiday decorations didn't help. The twinkle of the lights from the tree and the bannisters shone on Malfoy’s face making odd shadows that accentuated his pointy nose in a way that made him look less like an angry Flamingo and more like the distinguished bloke he always claimed to be.
