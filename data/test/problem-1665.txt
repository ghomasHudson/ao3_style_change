He screeched slightly and jumped away in shock.
“Oh, there was definitely a girl!” Greg said, smirking.
Snape's presence was an unwelcome one opposed to Draco's lab at home. He was a threatening and slightly scary presence, overlooking everyone. It was quite clear he liked control in his classroom, and everyone had better obtain that or so help them.
"I wonder how the Bulgarian tents look..."
"If we're going to be all buddy-buddy now, you can use our first names y'know Malfoy."
Octavia left the room and entered the common room. In the 10 minutes she was gone, absolutely everything seemed to have come together. It was enchanting!
The door opened to reveal a room about the same size as a dormitory, only stretching out longer. To one wall was scattered broken furniture, some classroom desks on one side, and to another there were a couple of crooked blue and green sofas. Green torches lit the room up, hanging from the ceiling in metal pots. And to the other wall...well, there wasn’t one really. The other wall seemed to be made entirely of glass, looking into the Great Lake. The glass reached into part of the floor, making so you could see down into the depth of murky water
“Good thing we’re leaving.” Sirius decided the take a small risk. “Before Trixie comes back from wherever she is.” He paid close attention to the kid’s face. It only flickered slightly, but it was enough. Cousin Trixie was the kidnapper. At the very least that question was cleared up. “I will let you take one item with you before I put a sack over your head and knock you unconscious.”
“Know that Draco’s definitely into guys, and is definitely into Potter? Yes absolutely.” Octavia choked on air.
“Au revoir Marguax! Au revoir belles filles!” He waved them away. He took a moment to re-adjust his jumper.
“What are we doing exactly?” She asked.
“Standing right in front of me.” That was a new one. Sirius rolled his eyes.
“This movie doesn’t make sense. Why would they want more danger? It’stupid. Fred! You don’ wanna face actual scary stuff! Trus’ me, it’scary.”
“Do you want to know another secret?”
“Professor Karkaroff vill be clucking soon, ve should all return to the ship.” Viktor gestured to the group of students to hustle them along.
After Blaise, the next guinea pig was Lavender Brown, who after a couple of seconds, ended up imitating a squirrel, much to everyone’s amusement. Then Moody turned to Draco.
"Ravenclaw!"
). It was an infuriatingly short time before either of those happened, and he wanted to use his little free time without interruption.
Or at least those were the least of his problems.
“Theoretically. I feel it would be quite apt.” At Potter’s confused look, he elaborated. “Because of my name.”
I AM SO SORRY FOR THE WAIT 😭😭😭😭😭
"Ron!" Potter interrupted their little...whatever this was. "You're being unnecessarily rude to Draco. Stop it." He told Ron. Draco's eyebrows rose.
“Don’t swear. And it’s not my fault, I ran out of sugar quills. Speaking of, may I...” She rolled her eyes far too sassily for her own good and forked one over.
“Good work, Mr Zabini!” Moody barked. “This boy here managed to resist the Imperius curse for an impressive amount of time. Good work boy!” Moody slapped Blaise on the back in a congratulations and Blaise grinned. A couple of the Slytherins clapped for him, including Pansy and Vince, as he took his seat once again.
"Ooh yes, like a fashion show! Show us what you have Harry!" Luna joined in excitedly. I sighed long and hard at the knowledge that there's no way I'd be able to get out of it now.
"I thought you rooting for Ireland?" Octavia asked.
Potter flushes. “What? No, pffft, no, why would I-“ he splutters. “How would I have know if you were here anyway? I would never- that’s ridiculous.” He defended himself
His mind bled with the warnings Aunt Bella had given him about the outside world, about the disgusting nature of muggles, about how you cant trust anyone apart from his Auntie, and that Grimmauld was the only safe place from his awful traitorous parents.
Greg and Vince greeted her happily, with Greg lifting her up and onto one of his shoulders. They've both gotten taller, Draco noted, with Greg growing broader.
Draco fixed him with a level glare. “Oh, c'est vrai? Juste assez pour ‘impressionner les filles’? Quelles bile tu craches. Bien que, je n'attendrais pas plus d'une fouine. Droit, regarder toi même tu connasse.” He spat at the Weasel, enjoying the way he scowled defeatedly. There was nothing quite like insulting someone in another language. He turned to Potter, seeing if he had anything to say.
The envelope timer had reached 01 seconds.
His suit felt uncomfortable. Too stuffy. Stupid collar that was too high up. Stupid. He clumsily took off his jacket and tied it around his waist, not caring how it looked. Blaise’s eyes followed his movement.
"Where did you see him last?"
I hope you enjoyed this chapter! Boy was this a longer one! Ha, that's what she said. Anyway, this chapter did include some Snape hate. So you're going to have to deal with that. Also, sorry if any Americans are confused with the way I spell some things, it's because I'm British. AO3 doesn't see it that way unfortunately.
“I was perfectly fine with my previous company, who you are so determined to refer to as my ‘kidnapper’.” he tried to use air quotes with his arms being trapped behind him.
At the expression on their faces, Aunt Bella’s schooling might be woefully behind a Hogwarts education. He flushed again slightly and looked down.
“What...am I doing......what...?” Draco muttered as he took in his surroundings. “Why...don’t I have my shirt on? And why is my stomach painted on...in green? And did Pansy paint...my nails?” He continued to mutter questions to himself as he got out of his bed, gripping his head.
Draco, Dad has never been known for his impeccable character. Get your head out of your arse and realise what is going to happen!”
“Best friends costume! It was Vince’s idea! And we look awesome!” He threw an arm over Vince’s shoulder delightedly. Pansy smirked.
"It's easy, really. Just a curve of the wrist. You have to have the image of what you want summoned clear in your mind, and then you utter 'Accio'" Draco demonstrated the movement with his own wand. Neville grasped around for the wand in his back pocket and held it with two hands.
"Okay then, uh, cool. So...um...first question; was that letter from your dad?" Harry asked. Draco gave a shaky nod, his knees tucking in tighter. "Oh then, okay...why was he mad?" Draco stared at him. "Sorry! Yes and no questions only, uh...did you do something bad?" He asked awkwardly. Draco nodded somberly. "What did you- right! Yes and no question, yes and no question...did you do something bad in class?" Draco thought about the desk incident. He nodded. "Huh. What did you do? Oh damn it, sorry, I keep on forgetting about the yes and no thing, um..."
Potter blinked up at him, and then scowled. "Maybe you need to get this through your thick skull, Malfoy, but not everyone's an asshole like you are. Not everyone would blame a school bully for trying to summon Voldemort or something." Draco flinched.
He didn’t know why he had these moments, these breakdowns. He’d read a pamphlet or two on PTSD, but shook it off. He wasn’t traumatised, he was FINE. It was all fine. He was just dramatic.
"I want to steal a poster." Draco said, gazing at one.
“Not so promiscuous, then?” Blaise yelled out cheekily, making the common room laugh again.
“And by stuff you mean?”
He walked over from where he'd spent the last half an hour in the bathroom with a plastic wrap over his head which I assumed contained another kind of hair dye, and lay down on his bed, wordlessly turning the lights off. The stars above his bed glowed softly, the light ebbing around the room comfortingly.
“Another person? How many people do you know?” He asked with great confusion. The way the kid phrased it sounded like he’d never been outside.
“Why I am appalled at you Miss Parkinson! And after that lovely night we shared together all but one week ago. I thought we meant something!” Blaise held his heart dramatically and sank to his knees. Draco saw Amanda scrawl frantically in her book some more.
"They do have a bit of a point though, with the amount of death eaters that come from our house..."
He blindly lay both hands on Draco’s face, cupping it softly.
Draco smiled.
. “Eef we’ve all got our papier, zen we shall go now. Look in order! Fix zat hair! Adjust your cap!” Margaux turned her cold gaze to him, which then warmed slightly. “I bid you adieu, mon ami, until we meet again Draco.” She squeezed his forearm.
"Hey! None of that language in front of Octavia!" Draco hissed up at Pansy. Octavia batted Draco's arms away from her before he had the chance to cover her ears.
“Well what if I told mum?” She asked, challenging him. He smirked.
He looked at Draco strangely, as if trying to work him out. He then grabbed Draco's hand left hand with his right hand, surprising the blonde, and held it tightly. He grinned toothily at Draco. Draco smiled back nervously, and carried on walking with the group. Terry carried on holding his hand.
"It was." Draco looked past Harry to the nervous ginger boy. "What's your name?"
He squeaked in pain and bounced back up. His back leg felt like it was sprained.
The Halloween party the night before went incredibly. Not only did she bond with Martha, but she also fit into a social environment with her peers well, even getting to brag about her brother organising the whole soirée. They were rather impressed.
“Go home, you’re drunk.”
“How did you even find this place?” Martha asked Danny excitedly. He smiled tiredly.
“I. Will. Tell. Tom. Vicars.” Pansy grimaced.
Everything was cold.
“Well, he’s a total art weirdo. He likes painting a lot but gets his art supplies all over my clothes. It’s pretty annoying. He also likes music, but he’s a terrible singer.”
You might belong in Hufflepuff,
"Oh, uh, yeah!" The stupid sod stumbled over his words.
"Malfoy, if your hair were to be set on fire, it wouldn't even hurt. It would just burn like a candle because of all that hair product."
“I’m up, I’m up!” Potter protested, trying to get up before lying back down and hissing. “Fucking forehead. Did you have to yell?”
After a few seconds of pause and thinking, Hagrid replied. “Tha’s next lesson, Malfoy, yer jus’ feedin’ ‘em today.” Draco rolled his eyes.
Anthony didn't have any siblings, and only lived with his father. His father was an Auror, and was a bit of a workaholic, but always made time for his son. His mother had left them when he was younger, so he never really knew her. "Good riddance!" Michael had said to this. Apparently Michael and Anthony had gone to the same wizarding primary school in Scotland and had known each other since they were 7.
“But now it reflects badly on me, you selfish prat!”
“A couple er’ flasks an’ some punch.” He mumbled.
“He’s still dancing with her.” He spat resentfully towards the dance floor, where Theo and Green were presumably dancing.
“My upbringing was fine, thank you.”
After a lot of shrieking, Greg finally let Octavia down from his shoulder and everyone sat down in the carriage.
"Ugh, what now Potter?"
"Oh yeah, you'll never believe what I saw in there, it's crazy! I actually saw-" They walk away together. Draco looks after them for a moment too long before turning back to his group.
“This’ll be so awkward...”
"Hey! Let him go!" Octavia yelled at Crouch while Draco tried to desperately tell her not to intervene.
“Oh, oh yeah, right, Draco...” His first name sounded weird in Potter’s voice.
“FOREVER’S GONNA START TONIGHT!”
Draco squinted. “You’re the one who wanted the truce.”
"No complaints about hair dye in the bathroom. I have a shit ton of this stuff and plan on using all of it, and trust me, it's messy." I snorted in surprise at the request and nodded my head.
“You guys are so embarrassing. Especially you Blaise.”
"Let's go to the library, I told Harry to meet us there."
!” He imitates and Draco laughs. “When you were younger you probably would have called Octi ‘Malfoy’ if it wasn’t confusing.”
“That was Blaise Zabini, unfortunately one of my best friends.”
Octavia clapped her hands together. “Fantastic! Now about my eyes...”
"Yeah, well..." he trailed off.
“Well obviously not.”
It was when Dumbledore said that the inter-house Quidditch Cup wouldn't be taking place this year that chaos broke loose.
“Nothing.”
"Well I'm sorry too." Draco began. "I'm sorry for just treating you like a source of knowledge when we first met. That was rude. You were just the first person who'd lived in the muggle world I'd ever met, and I got excited. I should of tried to get to know you." He stuck out his hand. "Friends?"
“See? I’m still bothering you more!” Draco pointed out. Potter rolled his eyes with a smile.
"That's true." Hermione conceded.
“Lead the way Parkinson.” She threw an arm around his shoulder and walked him up to the ‘stage’. She left him there to go and whisper something to the person controlling the black box and he smiled. She returned to Draco with two microphones and handed him one.
"I reckon we can just wait here, you know, we'll hear anyone coming a mile off." Potter said before a figure emerged from behind a tree right ahead of them.
This startled the boy, as did the round of applause that came from the Ravenclaw table. McGonagall took the hat off the boy's head and pushed him towards the Ravenclaw table. He was now in Draco's view and Draco saw his expression grow into a slight panic as he flapped his hands some more. Over the noise he sounded to be clicking his tongue fastly, and his eyes darted about. The boy, Terry, made eye contact with Draco and Draco tried giving him a small smile. The boy bit his tongue and the flapping softened as he sat down. Draco focused his attention back to the sorting.
“That was my first kiss!”
“Mr Zabini, that really isn’t necessary.” McGonagall told him hesitantly, while Draco heard Weasley guffaw.
be taking the Mickey. “I thought you wouldn’t be, because it would be pretty hypocritical with how much shit you give Hagrid, but then you do have their blonde hair and pale skin and the whole-“ Potter waved his over Draco vaguely. Draco raised an eyebrow.
"I'm Octavia Malfoy, and I'm guessing you're Harry Potter, huh?" Octavia asked the speccy git, raising an eyebrow.
“Is he wearing a Michael Jackson Thriller costume?”
Draco Malfoy was in the worst shape of them all, as he’d elected to drink as if he wanted his organs to fail right in front of him. He drank like he was having his arm chopped off and it was the only way to numb the pain. He drank like he had a large infatuation with Harry Potter and wanted to forget all about it.
Octavia began the cycle of fashion. Draco picked something out, modeled it, and she'd give him her fair but critical notes.
"I suppose I am. Are you?" She asked him primly.
The common room filled with an awful quiet that made Octavia feel like she was intruding in on the scene. Blaise’s face crumpled a bit as he looked at Pansy. She looked like she couldn’t believe what she’d said.
[][][][][] [][][][][] [][][][][]
"And I still can't believe you own a library. I'd kill for my own library! My shelves are practically breaking under the weight of my books, it's not fair." She didn't seem as bothered about it as she sounded.
“How did you do that?” Pansy asked him dazedly.
“So...you have an older sibling in Slytherin?” Martha asked. Octavia smiled.
(See the end of the chapter for
On another note, don’t you think it’s a little rude that Potter is his arch nemesis, but Draco isn’t his. I mean, because of all that Voldemort stuff that’s going on, Draco’s probably only his SECOND worst enemy! Can you believe it! After all he goes through the make Potter’s school years living hell, which he never fails at every single day, making sure Potter knows how much he hates him through snide comments and well designed pranks, and suddenly the Dark Lord or whatever swoops in at the end of the year and takes all the credit for ruining Potters school life! At most it was a “team effort” but Voldemort didn’t do shit. Especially last year, Draco thinks something else weird and traumatising happened to Potter at the end of third, but it’s hard to keep up. Especially when you’re sporting a wound like Draco was.
He nods sadly.
"Thanks Lovegood, I always appreciate a compliment. Would you care for some tea?" He handed me a mug of earl grey. I tasted it. A dash of milk and two and a half sugars. How did he know exactly how I like my tea? Legilimency?
“Pansy, do you have any glitter?”
I should never promise when I’m going to get a chapter out 😭 thank you for waiting, I would recap the last chapter briefly if it’s been a while, enjoy!
Speak of the devil, as Octavia walked down the halls of Hogwarts she saw her brother doing the same. He was walking towards her with his head titled downwards, slight bitterness painted all over his face.
“It’s a simple question. I wasn’t aware I was within the presence of someone so dim they are unable to listen to something so simple.” Draco rebutted.
The other three turned to him fearfully as his eyes were locked to what was in front of him.
Have a good one amigos and share ur thoughts haha I need sleep now
Everything looked like it fit. Fit for me. And all of it did. And it wasn't Dudley's. It wasn't school robes that were bought to be a bit bigger to fit for longer. All of it was bought specially to fit me. To make me look good. And I kind of did. As good as I did at the Yule Ball, probably better because I wasn't preparing to dance in front of the whole school with a ridiculous lack of a haircut.
Draco cast a body bind hex on the person to subdue their escape attempts. They had wild eyes, and a complexion much alike Aunt Bella. That did not soften Draco’s suspicion.
“Be careful Draco, your virginal upbringing is showing.” Draco scowled.
"I know! The crazy stuff people get up to! Gives a guy ideas." Michael bounced his eyebrows at Anthony, who pretended to swoon into his arms.
“Hello Drako! How are you today?” Draco cleared his throat before answering.
Blaise sniffled and nodded. He took a sip of his hopefully watered down alcohol and pouted.
Realising that he was still staring into Potter’s eyes, he averted his gaze quickly and nibbled on his sugar quill again. He was nearly done with this one. He could feel his face heat up so he got up from the table.
“I don’t know what to do-“ Draco starts.
After the Veela left and the drooling idiots were taken out of their trance, Ludo continued.
A chorus of “Will you Drako?”s came from the other Durmstrangs. Draco scoffed.
It’s only been a second but Draco has experienced everything at once and it’s taken forever.
“I-I uh, just wanted to...play Quidditch?”
Once everyone left the classroom, noise erupted from the crowd. A lot of people were talking about how cool Moody was. Draco scoffed at this.
He was glorifying it again, but in that moment he still didn’t care.
Draco overheard Harry and the Weasley talking loudly about how they were going to be sorted. When Weasley mentioned a test, he saw Hermione tense up.
He glanced at Potter through his hands. The other boy was giving him a questioning look.
"Oh haven't you heard? Pansy and I are dating! Isn't that right honey?" He draped himself over Pansy, pretending to swoon.
. Draco sighed.
"Wonderful weather, isn't it?" It was raining buckets. Still, Draco steadied the umbrella and nodded along as she lead them down the patio to a sheltered table. Once they were out of the rain, he closed the umbrella before she could see it, and hurried to pull up a chair for her. "Such a polite son I have," He smiled back at her, discreetly checking her over to see if her nightgown got wet.
“Potter.” He whispered as he shook the boy’s shoulder slightly.
"They looked creepy. The faces wouldn't stop smiling. I was just trying to eat and this man in Shoulder pads came up to and tried to chat. It was weird and he wouldn't leave me alone. Luna didn't help!" He narrowed his eyes at her. "She was just watching with a smile on her face. She tried to give him my number!" I glanced at Luna and she shrugged with a smug little smile.
Moody lifted him up again with magic and flung him around again, making him feel sick. “I’m disciplining him. You never pull your wand on your opponent when he has his back turned!”
With a clearer look at Blaise and his outfit, he looked heavily debauched. His jacket was wide open, and a long line of love bites seemed to litter him head to toe.
"Whatever." Weasley backed down reluctantly. Ha-Potter looked at him.
“Hey Blaise?” He whispered.
"Oh no! Draco, your boyfriend's nose looks pretty bad." Octavia hissed to Draco, causing him to break into an ugly blush.
“Yes?”
He started to make sounds of displeasure while struggling to unpack one of his bags, muttering what sounded like "stupid fucking stick of a wand". It's then that I remembered.
“Like hell we won’t!” Pansy yelled. She dragged Draco up by both his hands and spun him round. “Let’s see what we can make of you on such short notice...a vampire?”
“What are you doing? If you’re trying to use Occlumency, good luck,” he chuckled nervously. Both Octavia and Draco were trained by none other than Narcissa Malfoy at Occlumency since they were both young children. Pansy smirked.
Professor McGonagall put out a wooden stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a large pointed wizard's hat. This one was old and dusty, looking to fall apart at the seams at any moment. The sorting hat, Draco realised.
“Yeah?”
“...what?”
Draco Malfoy was developing an odd feeling in his chest.
* Don’t Stop Believin’ - Journey
He did his morning routine before getting back his birthday list. He smoothed it out and revisited
"Well who is that dear?" She asked him.
“Granger,” he began, “I would like to call a truce with you too.” He offered an open hand for her to shake. She eyed it with contempt.
Granger huffed and him, and turned away angrily, as did Weasley. His smirking stopped when he realised potter was still looking at him.
“So? Vince struggles with his tie all the time.”
“Well then I’d like to cash in a favour.” Draco narrowed his eyes.
"Dark blue." He said in a suave voice that nearly made Octavia blush.
But this meant two things. One; she’d become a bit closer with Martha. Two: she was missing on private tutoring and was falling back into being just above average.
"I suppose you're right." She admitted, smoothing our her hair and standing up straight in an attempt to look more dignified.
Thank you so much for your support, you comments literally mean the world to me and every time I hear your feedback I get so much happy chemical! Be sure to give a kudo, comment and a bookmark to kept updated because my update schedule in yikes.
“Filles! Get off ze boy! We have to put our names een ze cup! Show some decorum for Beauxbatons!” The many girls pulled away from the speccy git, leaving him in a sad heap on the floor.
"Besides, the people at the Ravenclaw table aren't exactly being the kindest or the most investing with their conversations." She fiddled with her quill earring. At this, Neville narrowed his eyes.
He walked up to Platforms 9 and 10 and looked at the brick wall in between them. Before he could get a running start he heard a voice from behind him.
He looked at the docile scene before him with a befuddled expression on his face. Hermione swiftly slipped her arm out the crook of his elbow and came over towards the sofa.
Draco thought for a moment, thankful for the change in subject. “I had heard some rumours about Warrington wanting to...and Amanda Green has definitely mentioned it tons of times to her friends, but that could be jut to stir up some gossip. Katy has said that she would if she could, but she’s only in our year...And I’ve heard that bloke Diggory from Hufflepuff is going to try...”
“So?”
The ugly pink cat curled up in his lap happily and he grinned widely, the wand poking the side of his mouth sorely.
“Mm?”
"It's S.P.E.W, and as a society we intend to abolish all house elf slavery being used by freeing elves from their masters and allowing them to live their lives properly, without waiting on hand and foot for someone." She smiled proudly.
"At the World Cup me and Octavia saw some Beauxbatons students," Draco mentioned casually. "It reminded me of how Mother wanted to send me there. Of course, Father wanted to send me to Durmstrang, because of it's love of the...the Dark Arts." He stumbled over that phrase and immediately felt the urge to scratch at his forearm. He pushed that urge away and continued. "Instead of only Defense, it also teachers Dark Magic to students, to understand all areas of it. The manor has a lot of material on it, but Hogwarts is far too vanilla to except that. Of course, he also wanted to send me there due to it's hate of Mu-" he swiftly remembered Octavia was in the carriage, "-uh, muggleborns. Very pureblood at Durmstrang. But Mother didn't like the idea of me going to a school too far away anyway, so they agreed on Hogwarts." He explained. Blaise nodded.
"I'm not that young!"
“I must be drunker than I thought, because I swear I am seeing Harry Potter.” He squinted. Draco pat the drunk boy’s shoulder.
He was about to tell them to get off of him before he spotted Weasley in the corner of his eye giving him a death glare. He smirked at the ginger, pretending to revel in the attention a bit.
It was quite rude to assume Draco would have such a lack of standards! If Draco were to have a crush on the boy who lived, the boy who lived would have to at least be an 11/10. Potter’s barely a 5. Maybe a 6 on a good day. Definitely an 8 when his hair goes that perfect combination of curly and messy and swooping into silky locks of hair rather than miscellaneous cow licks.....but no higher than that! And an 8 would never do for a MALFOY.
He looked down at how he was sat and sighed. His calves were tied to the chair legs, and his lower arms were tied away from each other to the back of the chair. But the chair seemed old and rickety. Breakable.
But why? He grabbed his right arm with his left in an attempt to stop himself, but his body part went against him. His own voice, the good one, was screaming at Moody’s inside of his head.
There was a tense moment of silence.
Maybe he could try and order a cat? As far as he knew, Aunt Bella was okay with animals. He only needed to send the Grimmauld owl Booky off to order a cat, and set a third area to pick it up. But he wasn’t really allowed out, and Aunt Bella was probably too busy to help...
"Agh, fucking hell! Shit!" I hopped up on one foot. That fucking hurt! I picked it up again, still keeping it at arms length. It was still blowing air furiously. I fiddled with the buttons again until I fixed it to a setting I was okay with. I held it steadily with two hands. To be safe.
Defence Against the Dark Arts.
On the other side of the pitch.
But he had to admit, it didn’t look half as bad as he thought it would. But why was Blaise walking backwards?
“It doesn’t matter if I was or not, they’re always going to assume it anyways!”
Octavia got up herself, and guided Blaise’s mourning self to the dorms as well.
At least Granger decided to say something. As infuriating as she was, at least she had common sense. He supposed she had to be logical. Someone had to balance out the Gryffindor house.
- gently rubbed Draco’s cheek and suffice to say Draco’s every thought halted to a harsh stop.
Narcissa's lips purse. "You'll see him tomorrow. We've got to leave NOW." She intertwines their arms with hers and casts.
So, with a complete lack of care, she shoved him off her with her elbow. Which he then fell in the other direction. Onto me. Damn.
I hope you enjoy this chapter. More notes to follow.
“Half seven.” Martha said and Draco scowled.
"Draco Mafloy, sir." He said, ready to get his schedule. Terry trailed behind him.
After we'd paid and put all the equipment in a new bag, we headed out the shop, and I waved to the bored looking repair girl who barely looked up from her nails.
“Face it Via! We’re Slytherins! We’re Malfoys! It’s just what we do! The sooner we accept that the easier it’ll be! So guess what? We are going to have to get used to the shit they throw at us, because it’ll only get worse from here!” Draco yelled.
“I’m Draco.” He told her.
From the very back of the hall flew in an Eurasian eagle-owl. The sheer presence make Draco gulp. Suppose his father did find out. He foolishly tried to convince himself that it was just a letter from his mother, but in the owl's clutches was the unmistakable red of a Howler.
"If you aren't wanting to put in that much time and effort, then I would suggest a small File Department heist. This would include changing the laws from the very inside. It would be done by stealing a key from a lower class worker of the Ministry who's in Silver Law Paperwork, breaking through the advanced safety wards with a tiny bit of dark magic, using Sinseng worms to rid the House Elf Silver Law of whatever you don't like on it (by eating the strong magic trace), and using a quill to simply fill in the blanks with whatever you prefer."
A click.
“Fine.” He said defeatedly. “Fine fine fine fine fine fine. Fine.” He muttered as he walked towards the exit.
"I'm just here for my things." He heaved up his suitcases from under the seat. Both Harry and Ron had fallen into silence and were now staring at him as he struggled.
"Whatever price you come up short, I will pay for it."
"Potter, get up or I'm locking you out of our dorm!" I opened my eyes again to Malfoy's face right up in my mine. A shock to say the least.
Then she got a fantastic idea.
"Yeah yeah I get it. But if someone else asks you for a team, I would go with Ireland."
She felt so mad that she had to laugh a little. She thinks she sounded a bit maniacal with the way that Martha looked at her oddly.
was. It doesn't take an idiot to figure out what happened." He hissed and Draco struggled in his grip.
"Move along now," a sharp voice cut in. "The Sorting Ceremony's about to start." The flying Duke frowned at the interruption, but floated after the other ghosts into the hall. "Now form a line," McGonagall instructed, "and follow me."
And so on and so forth. Many students had gone forward, and the separation seemed quite equal between the houses  as far as Octavia could tell. Soon enough, it was her turn to be sorted.
“So you’re the famous Draco Malfoy, hmm?” The friend of Via’s confronted him, raising a judgemental eyebrow. Draco matched it, refusing to be outdone by a first year.
“I was
(See the end of the chapter for
"My darling Drakey here-"
"Cool! Have a good, uh, break! Come on Ron, didn't you want to show me something in the lake?" His smiled returns. So does Weasley's (unfortunately).
Aunt Bella’s face pinched slightly. “Yes yes, a mother figure of course, but do never call me as such.” At his questioningly gaze she smiled tightly. “Makes me feel old. Stick with Auntie if you please.” She let him out of her embrace and sat to the side of her chair, rapping her fingers on the table. “What was it you were saying earlier, about practising transfiguration? What spell are you having trouble with?”
“Draco may have a point.” Said Pansy. “We are only Slytherins. People think we’re evil anyways. Draco’s history in picking fights with the Golden Trio doesn’t really help either. It’s our word against that of a trusted Hogwarts professor and a previous Auror. We may as well be fighting against the law.”
I could feel his warm breath on the back of my neck due to the close proximity, and it sent unwanted goosebumps down my spine. As he was checking the label, one of his hands brushed my neck and I clenched my fist as a bad, awful feeling began to pool in my gut. It all happened in a matter of seconds before he pulled away.
“What was that about my family?” He confronted them, face red as his hair with anger. Draco took a step forward in front of Octavia on impulse.
“I’m younger than this lot.” She gestured to the fourth and fifth years. “Twelve, to be exact. The name’s Octavia Malfoy.” She offered her hand across the table to Viktor. She then noticed Draco trying to hide his shock and inner fanboy at the fact Viktor Krum was sitting right next to him.
She then decided to be open about it, and told him she wanted to date him. He was confused.
"The firs'- years, Professor McGonagall." Said Hagrid. Her eyes scanned the group of anxious students.
He knew Lucius was probably behind this, or at least partially responsible. He disappears the same time things start going wrong everywhere? It wasn't like he was in trouble. He isn't exactly the good guy. Still, he kept up a strong face as he entered the wood with Octavia , walking a couple meters in to be properly hidden by the foliage, but close enough to know what was happening.
“Then why’d he pull his wand out?” Moody’s eye swivelled to the Slytherins.
He shakily got up and began to pack away his books and parchment. He left the spilt inkwell and quill.
The Great Hall was silent.
“Hello gorgeous.” Draco replied without missing a beat, refusing to look at Blaise, focusing solely on the Viktor Krum poster.
“Why the fuck isn’t this coming off?!” Draco asked the dorm, rapidly scrubbing at the green text on his stomach with a flannel. Blaise snickered.
Edit: had to edit some shit sorry
“Maybe if you want the anger to stop you should take a leaf out of my book. I seem to be quite popular.” He advised.
"It this what the Slytherin dorms look like?" Draco laughed at that.
"Stop being so loud about Hogwarts dear, King's Cross is packed with muggles. Of course they're probably too busy rushing about to notice anything unusual.
"Yeah, don't think you're moving anytime soon. You're a great portable pillow." Octavia told Greg, still leaning against him. Greg's face softened and he stayed where he was.
Draco found some butter and icing sugar, and left it to his mother to prepare. It was her favourite thing to do.
Avada Kedavra.
“And if you actually paid any attention to the boys, then you’d know it’s working!”
“Will it last until tomorrow?” Octavia asked as she picked it up and fiddled with the switch.
She flicked through it again.
"I lost it!"
"Where is Father?" Octavia asks, her face tucked into Draco's shoulder. He gently sets her down.
After I'd finished, I waved goodbye to Luna, and decided to walk to DADA early with Neville.
"Never thought I'd hear that sentence." Said Harry.
“I’ll get one when I feel like it.” Something felt off. “Where’s Greg?”
“An Ouiji board! It’s used for summoning ghosts and spirits!” Another third year answered.
“I have never kissed anyone.” Draco whispers conspiratorially and Blaise snickers.
When he got to the filth on the furniture he began with waking up his friends first.
Danny Keett was gawking so Octavia elbowed him.
, terrifyingly realistic monster masks, fake muggle weaponry (
“But...you can’t hypothetically imagine dating me?” She asks quietly.
Potter snorted. Draco scowled deeply.
He held in front of him to read. His eyes darted across it quickly and widened imperceptibly. The Slytherins noticed and began whispering as quietly as they could muster. Octavia kept her eyes glued to the old headmaster. He cleared his throat to read aloud.
"Are you a muggleborn?" Draco interrupted.
“Probably. You’re the one who wanted to come anyway.” He pointed at the raven haired boy. Said boy grimaced and took a sip of his drink.
“You want a dragon for a pet?” The idiot blurted out. Draco crosses his arms. Was he going to judge him?
"Hey Malfoy."
Potter gave him a look. “I’m hanging out in the library with you of all people, what do you think?”
“Not you lot.” He walked back into the middle of the stage with his microphone. “Anyone in first, second and third year will now be moved back to their rooms. Snape is probably out of it, so as long as you’re relatively quiet, you can continue to party. Watch the things you watch on your black boxes, play dress up with each other, go in each other’s dorms, I don’t care. But you can’t stay here.” He announced, trying to regain his dignity.
The first day of school. Also this is the ferret chapter.
"Slytherin!"
I felt an odd twinge of disappointment at the revelation that he was nowhere to be seen. Probably just the want for things to go as normal as possible. I suppose you can't have everything.
"Why is Malfoy in his closet?"
“I haven’t had the greatest day either.” Potter said.
“No need for a reminder, I only wanted to see if you needed help.” He bowed his head and her coos heightened in pitch.
He gasped.
"Grandfather's portrait."
At this point Draco was vibrating with excitement and anticipation, buzzing in his seat gleefully, to the embarrassment of Lucius.
“Dreadlocks.” Blaise mumbles.
He guessed they couldn’t have their base of operations at Grimmauld after all. Bloody hell, and after he’d talked the place up for all it was worth. At least he’d had the sense to check beforehand. His one brain cell seemed to come in handy sometimes.
He looked at her gratefully. “Okay Pansy. Do you want to play quidditch?”
"Draco, I've heard the 'M' word before, Father uses it all the time." Octavia said.
At first many people thought that the people were trapped in the box using muggle elek-tree-city, but Potter said that wasn’t how it worked, and it was like a longer version of an animated photo. That did clear some stuff up, but also confused some kids further.
“If you’re so surrre.” Draco tried to remember the password. It was some sort of muggle Halloween reference. “What was it, what was it...” he muttered, “right! It was that muggle song by those front-road-boys...” he tried to remember it. Potter gave him a weird look.
At this point they'd gotten to the dungeons. In the common room lay all of their luggage. Octavia picked up her trunk and looked  to where the other first years were being led. Draco, Blaise, Pansy, Greg and Vince all ruffled her hair in unison.
guffawed.
“It was after Professor Moody put the Imperius curse on him.” Greg said.
“But you can trust me.”
“Oh...no...” Pansy moaned into her hands. Draco rested a comforting hand on her shoulder. “My stupid mouth. I always do it, I always go too far. Posy says so, but I never-“ her face crumples and Octavia can see real tears begin to gather. “You know that Theo is bad for him, right?” She asks Draco frantically.
“Nerd.”
“Granger?”
"Wow, golly gee, presentable?! Aw shucks Malfoy, you sure do know how to compliment a gal!"
"Because he thought you were playing hard to get!"
Slytherin included some very skilled casters, strategists and athletes, but because of their ‘evil’ history, no other house would want a Slytherin champion. Octavia’s only emotional investment was that she hoped her house would be chosen. So many had tried, there had to be a chance.
“It was a Defence practice, so we could learn to fight it off.” Draco told her. It was then that Octavia’s eyes were drawn to his left forearm, which he was scratching at. Octavia’s eyes narrowed.
"Right." Octavia nodded, sitting on her bed, closing the blinds over her bed.
“Oh god.” Pansy uttered. “Blaise-“
“No no, I just thought it would be nice to have some company while you’re away plotting, you know I’ll always appreciate you more Auntie-“
'Slytherin of course.' He thought into the hat. The hat gave a weary chuckle in response.
“Hold out your arms Potter.” Blaise told him as he attempted to drop him in Potter’s arms. And then he did. And Octavia laughed.
I hope you enjoyed reading this, I'm sorry for the wait that happened, I am writing the next chapter as I post this and it should be out within the next two days. Comment if you have any ideas or mini headcanons or meme conversations you'd like me to add as this is pretty chill fic with an open plot to those.
“I’ll make it up to them, right now I can’t even think straight.”
One long week after his little Viktor Krum freak out, Draco was getting bored. The Halloween party was long over, and he had no new project to work towards. He still tried to help Viktor, but after the initial help, he studied with his own school. He’d apologised politely and had said Karkaroff had wanted him to stick to his own school, but Draco couldn’t help but feel bitter.
“You’re not?”
Theo smirked. “If it means I get to take the credit for that thing, then sure.” He pointed to Draco’s ‘bruise’ smugly. Draco flushes pinker, all the way up to his ears.
"Were you even listening you halfwit buffoon? I said I did it out of the bloody goodness of my heart. We're sharing a room and we have a fucking truce, you blithering ginger! So I did it to be fucking nice, not to have some lowlife scum start accusing of having ulterior motives because of their idiotic one dimensional perception of who I am as a damn person! I'm trying to be good, to be better, to make up for my mistakes, but that does not entail buying clothes for Potter! Me being nice, is deciding not to punch you in your fat nose for your homophobic idiocy!" He shouted at Ron, his composure lost as Ron had started leaning back away from the flying insults.
The next day he woke up early. He walked quietly into the kitchen, knowing each and every creaking floorboard to avoid. He didn’t want to risk bothering Aunt Bella if she was in one of her moods. He crept into the kitchen and collected his egg on toast from Kreacher, before bringing it back up to his room.
“Ew, they’re probably only sixth and seventh years or something!” Octavia snorted loudly as Martha bounced her eyebrows.
"Okay Malfoy, you're forgiven." Said person looks up at them in disbelief.
"Even if I was, it wouldn't matter, because you're coming with me to Hogwarts after holidays. So I can bother you aaaaaaaall yeeeeeaaaaaarr." He teased her resting his arms on her head and she wasn't that short goddamit!
As they continued to kiss, Draco splayed a hand over Blaise’s chest to secure himself. But then he began to giggle.
"What if you do it a question for a question?" Neville intervened, getting slightly scared. They both turned to him then back to each other. The tension in the room evaporating they both agreed and nodded to this.
I felt good.
“I’ll tell you another time. Right now, I have a question for Draco.” Draco looked at him with a look that could kill. “How did it feel to be wrapped up in Potter’s big strong arms? Did it feel safe?” He batted his eyes and leaned over Draco, while Draco now looked like he was ready to kill Blaise with his own two hands, his face blotched an embarrassed red.
Viktor snorts. “Please, I doubt any of you have ever tried some good rakia.” He tells them. “Our country’s’ speciality. Tastes better if you brew it at home. Or at school.” He smirked and Draco listened with wide eyes.
“Because eventually we’re going to talk about something that you are far too young to understand.” He patted her head condescendingly. She glared up at him. He smirked and took a sip of water from his goblet.
“You’ve never left your house?” Potter asked, and it took Draco a second to realise the question was aimed at him. He flushed and looked down, stroking Cushion a bit.
“It isn’t funny Draco! He should be hung! Performing the Imperius on school children, attempting to vandalise you with the Dark Mark while under the curses influence?! This is serious!” She yelled up at him.
Potter shifted from foot to foot, seemingly out of questions until he gave Draco a quizzical look a second later.
I never knew Malfoy spent so much time trying to bother me. And he'd just admitted that the reason was just for some attention! I'd also never considered how long it took for Malfoy to make the badges, I just knew he did it because he hated me. I'm realising that our whole rivalry was really silly. It just got sillier as the years went on and we became more pubescent insecure messes. It was so stupid and childish looking back on it, but at the time, it was the worst. So I said as much.
"It's not fine Draco, you don't have to stand for this! You should be proud to be a Ravenclaw!" She said encouragingly.
“I’ll see you lot later.” He bid his friends goodbye, kindly ignoring Blaise’s bouncing brows and Pansy’s suggestive wink. He looked over the table to find Octavia and saw that she was smiling and talking with her friends.
Currently many of the older kids had either passed out on random furniture, or had returned to their dorms in pairs. Draco grimaced to think of what they were doing.
"Hello Dobby, please may you clean away the remaining cakes and return this umbrella to the ugly gnome stand." Draco bent down to hand the elf the black umbrella.
"What did Greg have again?"
As they entered Madame Malkins, Octavia decided to ask about why Draco needed dress robes this year anyway.
The common room was filled to the brim, and everyone was dancing. The room was dark, and just as he’d suspected, the coloured lanterns looked perfect. A song was playing overhead, probably by a projection charm, and it was very muggle. Very...pop-y. The singer kept on saying ‘Billy Jean’. It was weird. He saw Blaise showing off the some older years by doing his weird dance moves and excused himself from Pansy.
“Pffft, you two are both twigs. I could lift a sack of flour with greater struggle.”
He wasn’t happy for long.
According to his father they were nothing more than insects. They were dirt to be stepped on, and Muggleborns were no different. But why don't Wizards communicate with Muggles? Is it for the Muggle's safety, or for the Wizards? Why is it so bad if a Muggle discovers magic exists? Muggles have survived for so long without magic and yet they seem so advanced. Does this mean that magic is potentially a crutch for Wizards to stop them from reaching their full potential? And they must be special to be able to birth magic children without being Pureblood. Does this mean that they are like wizards? Or are they a descendant of a squib with magic still in their veins? Why does this exclude Muggleborns from being as important as Purebloods? Why the inequality?
The referee, Hassan Mostafa, walked onto the pitch to star the game and the anticipation hit a wall. Everything felt standstill for a single second before he began. He kicked the crate of balls open and as they flew into the air, the sharp blow of a whistle sounded.
“Oh shut up you Cows. And budge over, this is the comfortable chair.” Blaise tired to nudge them to other side of the chair.
"How are you a bad boy?" Terry asked.
Sorry for the long wait on this chapter and the shortness of it, I promise that I'm writing the next one and that it will be released within the next few days.
“The sparkles are because of you.”
“I’ve never said that Pans! And you do realise how jealous you’re sounding, right?”
"Hold on a minute, that lad's Malfoy? What's with the glamour and black hair?" Dean questioned confusedly.
"Oh yeah, I've heard of you. You're Draco's favourite subject-" She was cut off with said boy's hand frantically covering her mouth.
He heard another click, some muttering, and then footsteps. Footsteps away from the door.
"Don't touch your face with your chip-greased fingers, it'll make the spots worse you brute!" He told me, aghast.
“Attaboy. I wouldn’t lose any stress over the ordeal. Granger may be smart, but she isn’t as smart or quidditch centred as you are. She poses no threat.” She told him. He nodded and smiled.

"We've been over this Draco, call me Luna. And if it isn't too much trouble, I'd love some." When had they 'been over this'? When had Luna talked to Malfoy? Were they friends?
Draco Malfoy stood, poised and collected, in one of Malfoy Manor's many drawing rooms. He had a large pile of hardcover books stacked on top of his head. His face was cold and impassive as he paced back and forth through the room, reciting words that had been drilled into his head since birth. His father, Lucius Malfoy, was watching him from an armchair. His cold and impassive face taking on a sharper, crueler tone.
"That's the best bed hair I've ever seen!" Michael pointed at him while laughing. Draco pouted and tried to smooth it down. There were locks of hair sticking up in ways Draco didn't know was possible. He put a hand through it and tried mussing it up. It looked better at least. It wasn't neat, but it wasn't terrible. It looked a bit too fluffy, so he went over to the en suite and took out his jar of hair gel. He got out a bit and flattened his blonde hair down. It wasn't completely stuck to his scalp, but it was managable. He exited the bathroom to put on his shoes.
I have had the worst month, a terrible Halloween (even tho it’s my fav holiday), have been through a breakup and have run out of comfort drarry fics to read.
There was a lot of fire.
He sighed to himself and rolled his eyes upwards.
“Good. I’m glad you haven’t kissed anyone.” Draco told him.
“Erm, hello there Borislav.” Draco greeted the boy who was staring at him. Said boy flushed and grinned widely.
People are getting ready for the first day of school. Not a lot happens, just messing about and the characters existing.
“You’re not hallucinating. I invited Potter out of pity because he has no friends. Don’t think about it too much.” Blaise looked sceptical for a fraction of a second before shrugging.
He knew what just occurred wasn’t any different to squashing a spider under his boot, but it still felt...wrong.
“Blaise is rather fit actually. I might try to date him instead.” She said.
Octavia turned to the boy at focus as well, the horror and...confusion on his face. He looked so small, and the hall was so quiet, and he looked like a little puppy dog and Octavia just wanted to take him away from all of the eyes and, well, she didn’t know what she would do to make him feel better, feed him soup?
"Okay then, fine. What should I try on first?"
“He’s the nicest, I can tell. And he’s younger. You wouldn’t want some strapping older man whisking your brother away now, would you?” Blaise asks. Octavia shrugs with a smirk.
He looked back up at the screen and tried to focus on the nonsense that played out. He was kind of tired too.
“Call me Viktor. Goodbye Drako. Until ve next see one another.” Viktor waved goodbye. Draco nearly swooned.
"Hey there, the name's Michael! Herbology expert and bad boy extrordinaire!" Michael introduced himself to Neville with a completely straight face. Anthony snorted out a laugh.
. “I keep forgetting that everything’s magic now, and stuff that I thought were just fairy tales are actually real. What next, are Unicorns real?!” Danny yelled a bit, panicking behind them.
“You spaced out-“ it never seemed like Draco was able to finish a sentence around here. There always seemed to be some sort of distraction. This time it was Borislav and Aleksander and Dobromir. No Krum. Yay...
"It's important." He grit his teeth. He saw them exchange looks with each other and avoided eye contact.
Coming from the door.
The Malfoys had arrived at the camp, a large case levitating behind them.
"Yeah, besides, Draco's the best at it anyway. His desk was practically touching the ceiling of the charm's classroom." Anthony pointed out. Draco flushed.
"Wh-what's going on?" Draco asked, yawning. Then they heard screaming.
Some of them shrieked delightedly.
"Since when can you speak French?" Potter asked him, bewildered, causing Draco to flush.
“Okay! This has been really fun, but I believe some students from my house are entering the tournament so I’ll go watch that! Goodbye Viktor. Goodbye Borislav.” He left the table in a pile of awkwardness. He entered the crowd of students but only passed through it. He wasn’t really bothered. He hoped Greg and Vince would forgive him for abandoning them.
“Why would you want to do that? May I remind you that it is a SLYTHERIN party. Fulled with students who didn’t have a champion come from their house, and many of which think you cheated your way in.” He reminded the dolt.
“I’m sick of being congratulated for my bad luck. For being the chosen one. I think some people are even jealous. I’d let them take my place if I could! You think I want to nearly get killed this year?! To uphold that goddamn tradition of being at the mercy of whatever the hell wants to disrupt my school life this time?! You think-“ Draco shushed him by shoving a hand in the other boy’s face.
“Thank you, Malfoy, so much, for painting me that amazing picture. It’s a wonder you aren’t a motivational speaker.”
“Pity?” He pulled a face.
“Yes you did. Congrats.” Potter smiled at him. He smiled awkwardly back. The situation was disconcerting. “Don’t you still owe me a performance of the Malfoy Fall?”
"I've liked Quidditch since I was a baby, because of Diana always needing someone to play with. She's the oldest so we all do what she says. I have 4 brothers, 4 sisters, and 6 cousins who stay with us, so now that Diana's gone there should be the perfect about of people for a game of Quidditch, but my brothers are always ruining it. They do every penalty they can, Blatching, Blurting, Haversacking, and Quaffle-pocking. The only reason we haven't done any Stooging is because I balance it out. I'm fairly certain my cousin Barnie invented a type of cheat where you hit the Bludger into the Snitch before the Seeker catches it, breaking the Snitch and their arm," he rambled on in an odd monotone. Draco listened with fascination. He'd never known somebody could have so many siblings! And cousins too!
”I never asked to be born a
“Of course. I’d never lie to you.” He gave her a hug.
"po--er...Pot--r...Potter.......POTTER!" A voice snapped at me.
“What about best first impressions to your classmates? I love getting to talk to you a lot, and all that nonsense, but you need friends your own age.” He told her sternly.
“It’s about what you said, romance. And I’d rather keep that tidbit of information between us.” He jabbed Potter’s chest as he returned to his crossed leg position.
After eating a fantastic feast of many pumpkin and chocolate themed and flavoured items with Martha and Danny Keett, she slipped through the table to sit near the fours years. Very subtly of course.
Once he sat, he bounced experimentally. This was...fun? He bounced again. Quite a bouyant mattress. He bounced again.
“So you’ll be my boyfriend then?” She begged him, staring into his lovely grey eyes.
The morning after in the Slytherin Dormitories. These idiots.
"I'll see you on the train 1st September! I'll be expecting my answers!" He called before focusing on getting his mother out of there. He squeezed her hand as they flooed back to the manor, ice cream dripping everywhere.
“Mmkay, let’s go.” Draco jumped to his feet (wobbling slightly) and pulled on Blaise’s hand. “C’mon. Let’s gooooo!” He tried to drag the other boy along.
"So, how was shopping Draco?"
"What?"
Draco sat on the other side of Hermione and Michael slid over the table next to Neville.
“Get to the point.”
Once he'd made it he peered through the window. The two boys inside were sitting on a pile of sweets and were exchanging chocolate frogs. Draco never liked chocolate frogs much. He didn't like food that moved, and was never one for collecting cards. Harry just laughed at something Weasley had said, and Draco couldn't help but feel bitter about it. He stomped those feeling down and entered with a blank face.
“It was a distraction and a defence of the...actions I’d been accused off. And your word holds great weight, shocker, so it could have been the difference between me running free and getting arrested. And if I was arrested, no way was I going to let Octavia go with me or stay with you lot.”
"Well here you go then. Thank you for your help." He said while handing Hagrid 4 galleons.
Yoooooo I’m so so sorry for the wait! School has started up again and I’m lowkey drowning in work, but I’m cool. I’m fine. I’m totally handling it. This chapter is more Draco centred than Octavia centred, but don’t worry, the next chapter will have more of this little been. On with the show!
"Can I call you Draco?"
And while being a Slytherin coward he turns back towards the movie that started all of this and secretly holds on to that one special moment. He turns it around in his head and commits it to memory. That’s all he lets himself do because everything else, all the feelings and epiphanies, he pushes down and locks in a drawer and pretends they don’t exist.
After Martha had added a couple of red dots to Octavia’s neck, used some ‘contour’ to make Octavia’s cheekbones look hollower and added some sort of powder to make Octavia’s skin tone a sickly grey, she stuck the pair of glow-in-the-dark vampire teeth in Octavia’s mouth.
He barely made it to his bed before he collapsed down on it. The mattress groaned but he didn't care. He was still in his robes, still holding onto the book as he slept.
Pansy snickered again. "You didn't need to, I could already tell by the way you gazed at-"
to...and you’d become an adult! You could drink! You could drive! Draco hardly knew what driving was, but it sounded incredibly dangerous and cool! And you graduated Hogwarts or Beauxbatons or Durmstrang and went to work for the Ministry of Magic! Of course, Draco would never do that, it went against the teachings of the Dark Lord, but the premise was there!
The boys’ faces all fell at his adamance.
Pansy could firmly say that she was smitten.
Oh right! Potter’s complete lack of good looks and attractiveness!
“Oh, that’s my stupid little Draco, being so eager to help his Lord.” She held his face and tapped his cheek repeatedly, as if trying to hit the problems out of him. “I already said things were difficult last night, you forgetful little boy. Or do you need a reminder?” Her smile turned dangerous and Draco averted eye contact. She started to laugh and he tried to force a laugh out too, only it caught in his throat.
“Details, details...” Martha shook her off to continue making heart eyes at them. Octavia huffed.
It took a second for it to hit him, before Potter announced “Shit!” and jumped out of his seat to run towards the other side of the hall. Draco and the other Slytherin’s snickered.
"Why are you staring at Malfoy, Harry?" Octavia heard Weasley boy's voice ask.
Pansy watched her ‘boyfriend’ chat up Viktor amusedly. Greg, Vince and Octavia enrolled themselves in a heated debate on the best dessert Hogwarts had to offer, while Blaise tried to lure in some poor prey as he chatted up some students. Some were open to it, some were not, and those who weren’t seemed to be very...
“Nonsense, this is fine. Ill take him to Madame Pomfrey in no time!” And Blaise begins carrying him. In all Draco’s indignation, he can’t help but note how strong Blaise is. Octavia followed.
You'll make your real friends,
“What’s going on over here?” He asked, and tried to look authoritative. Greg and Vince backing him on either side definitely helped as the crowd parted for them.
The Quidditch World cup was upon the Wizarding World of Britain, and every quidditch fan was buzzing with excitement.
“Then...then why doesn’t Theo Nott think so?” Blaise asked a bit shakily. Draco’s head snapped up to Blaise’s face.
Draco quietened. He twiddled his thumbs. “It was nothing.”
Octavia rolled her eyes and instead enjoyed laughing with Pansy at Blaise’s performance of one of those waterworks, including intense drama, the saddest faces imaginable, a lot of fanning and a LOT of handkerchiefs. They were so inthralled with Blaise’s performance that they nearly missed the Hogwarts champion being introduced.
“Okay, and the fact that whenever Pansy flirts with Greg, Vince gets really quiet and sort of mad.”
They met their parents outside the tent and they decided to set off towards the pitch down the softly lit path. As a unit of Malfoys, they had to present themselves with poise, elegance, sophistication and wealth. So they kept their heads high, their noses higher, and their name known. They were set to be in the top box alongside the Minister, who in Octavia's opinion looked and acted like a bumbling idiot. Draco agreed with her, but he couldn't be as opinionated and open as she could. He was the heir to the Malfoy fortune, she was a prize to married off later in life. Sure her half was drearier, but there was more pressure on him. Ever the stupid big brother, he always took the hit for her and took the brunt of Malfoy responsibility.
“Or was it a boy?” Blaise queried with a raised eyebrow. The group gasped. Draco blushed a dark red.
"I'm Draco Malfoy." Draco tried to sound proud. Ron's face curled into a disgusted expression.
"Draco, I don't know who to root for, I'm not a quidditch fanatic like you are." She replied in a monotone. "I barely know the rules. I'm only brushing up on them now so you don't waste all your time explaining them to me mid-match." She showed Draco the cover of her book, the title 'Quidditch Through The Ages' flashing in red.
He flew upwards into the centre of the pitch. It felt good to be back on a broom.
There's nothing hidden in your head
He looked at her confusedly and took a hand up to his eyes. At feeling the sore and red skin he grimaced.
Pansy got up and cupped her mouth with her hands. “Blaise! Draco’s lying about where he was! I need backup! Bring Greg and Vince!” Draco froze.
“We put the younger ones to bed of course!” Draco defended. “We’re not stupid, you know.”
"I have to say, knitting is surprisingly exhausting. But I'd like to continue. Once I get better at it, I'll have to ask everyone what they'd like me to knit them for Christmas."
“We’re, like, one year younger than you,” at Greg’s raised eyebrow, he conceded, “ugh, FINE, we won’t summon any ghosts!” The blonde boy said, annoyed.
Blaise must just be barmy. And Pansy is a right drunken bint half the time, so no one can trust her judgment. And of course you could never rely on Greg and Vince for a smart idea. And Theo...Theo is a prat, and prats lie. So in conclusion there really was no way that him, Draco Lucius Abraxas Orion Calindarea Pentious Maxium Malfoy, could have a crush on such a loathsome, self centred, arrogant, Gryffindor, self sacrificing speccy git that is Potter. It’s impossible.
“Please don’t tell anyone.” His eyes were wild and scared. “Father will kill me. Mum would be sad. I’d probably be disowned.”
She hadn’t figured everything out, but she thinks she might have figured out a couple of truths.
“What, about being gay?” She asked, humoured. It wasn’t as funny when he nodded.
"Can we go pay now, my arms are tired of being your personal shopping bag and holding all of this up," I nodded to my arms packed full of stuff. He nodded and grabbed my arm once again to lead me to the counter, nearly causing me to drop everything.
“How dare you doubt my ability to look through Draco’s bull-“she glanced at Octavia, “-shirt. This little wotsit hung out with Potter tonight. And he liked it!” Blaise guffawed.
"Wingardium Leviosa!" Hermione tried. Her feather lifted off the desk and continued to rise. It rose to be 4 foot above everyone's head before she stopped.
“You wouldn’t dare.”
“What’s that?”
. “And for what you call my perversion, which is really just my incredible charming skills, I think I’ll keep them around for now. There are many foreign students in need of seducing after all.”
"Oh just shut up."
“Could you charm away my makeup? I don’t want to sleep with mascara on.” Draco nodded and got out his wand.
"Remember Draco, you are a Malfoy. Act like it." The letter burst into flames and dropped to the floor in a pile of dust.
At around twelve o’clock he organised himself lunch, purposely avoiding telling Kreacher. He did not feel like talking about anything with that dingy elf. He thought the elf was in the cellars anyway, three floors below. He was a nostalgic old elf, and a cruel one at that. It was his idea of a little joke to take a whole day to clean the cellars, a joke against Draco. ‘It was only right’ that he would, since ‘Master Malfoy would be spending plenty time down there after Mistress Lestrange was done with him’.
“Hello Potter...” he reclaimed his headspace and smirked again. “Do you remember Margaux?” He presented the girl, “she was the Beauxbatons girl I was, according to you, Weasley, ‘wasting my time talking to’.” At that, all 12 girls turned to the weasel with annoyance or disgust.
“Fine. I still think it’s loony.”
“Well you can plan those for the second half. The first half is for all years, and that includes the younger ones. So the stuff for the first bit is going to be more...how would you put it? Vanilla?”
“YES I am. Because I’ve treated you and Greg terribly, and you deserve someone who makes you feel special. I’m sorry I made you feel like you have to be an unfeeling jerk all the time, and I’m trying to realise that it isn’t really all that fun. I’m sorry if I made you feel dumb when I tutor you. I’m sorry that I’ve been in charge for so long. I’m sorry for being a shitty person.” He tells Vince. “And you’re not a screw up, especially not for liking Greg. He’s a good person, and it sounds like he’s really good for you.” He says and gives the boy a small smile. The other boy returns it twice as wide.
Terry shot right to the first bunkbed, putting his suitcases underneath the bottom one and jumping onto the top bed. Anthony copied Terry's movements and sat underneath Terry, taking in the room. Michael went to the other bottom bunk and began taking his shoes off, leaving Draco with the last top bunk. Draco slid one of his suitcases underneath the bed, hesitantly taking the other one onto the top bunk. Walking up the steps right into the bed was a foreign concept, as he'd never been on a bunkbed beforehand, never having anyone to share with.
“Well I’m pleased you could join us here at Hogwarts for your last year in school. I have to ask, where are the Durmstrang students staying? We haven’t been told a lot of information by Dumbledore. The mystery I suppose.” Draco said in his negotiation perfect pureblood voice. Octavia met Blaise’s gaze as he was trying not to laugh. Octavia knew what he was thinking, she was thinking the same thing.
Well, it wouldn't be that bad to look like Malfoy. He's a sort of attractive bloke. In a pretty sort of way.
“Perhaps not, but I can throw my charm! Speaking of,” his voice lowered, “‘Ow are you, pree-tee boy?” It took Draco a second before he realised that the comment was aimed at him. He immediately felt his face going red.
“Where’s Theo?” He asked casually. Or at least tried to. To Draco, it was pretty obvious how much Blaise really did care where Theo was. It made Draco’s insides squirm over what he would say next.
“Uh, what’s going on?” Potter’s voice broke through the drama as he held three drinks.
: but he stopped himself. He thought about the muggleborns who hid in Slytherin but brought out such interesting muggle inventions during the party. He thought of his own family’s twisted family tree to stay pureblooded. And then he though of Granger.
“Be gentle with them, the charms aren’t complete!” Draco’s scrambled to defend his ‘project’. “And Potter was the one who let me. He wanted to be in on the support for Diggory to avoid getting harassed all the time. And then Granger helped with badge pressing and charm work.”
"Exactly!" Granger agreed with him, before looking disgusted to having agreed with him. She managed to hold Weasley back from the scruff of his collar before he had his own shot at chatting them up.
"Were you two playing with jam again?" She asked obliviously. Draco averted his eyes downward sadly.
“No, I bet he only knows enough phrases to impress the girls.” Weasley OH-SO-HELPFULLY added once again.
"It's basically a letter that screams at you." Neville explained.
“Oi! Who are you calling a pervert?!” One ginger girl yelled at him.
And she was so certain of Draco that it threw her for a loop a bit.
The rest of them were scattered around the room, all completely plastered. The room was a complete mess and Draco sighed tiredly.
didn’t want to wake up. But he suppose he had to.
After using the hair care, bodywash and what must have been far too much warm water, I stepped out of the shower. I wiped at the fogged up mirror to look at my reflection. My hair was still wet, so I couldn't really see any of the results. I looked down at the pile of clothes I dropped on the floor.
"Um...I think I'll get back to you on that..." Draco huffed in disappointment.
“Her name is Hermione Granger. And why do you care?” He replied, albeit with a bit of bitterness.
"How come?"
“I don’t know what you’re looking for, but you’re not going to get it.” He said carefully.
“But all of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang students are probably going to be a couple of years older than us. To be able to compete in the tournament and all.” Draco pointed out.
He shot past the white line just before Potter, and had to swerve to avoid lurching into a crowd box.
"Okay guys, let's just go to class early. If they're late just tell your teacher Draco got a...what do you call it, howl-thing? Say he'll be late for class. Neville and I will handle Harry. Leave them be." The same voice told the group. The set of hands round his gripped on slightly tighter.
“Wait, don’t tell me you’d thinking of making me a-“
After another hour of trying to discover a more permanent transfiguration spell so that he could turn a pillow into a pet cat, Aunt Bella Apparated into the room. Draco looked up and smiled.
There is no way I am going to be able to pay.
“That was it! That stupid song, what was the title...I Want It That Way?” The snake hissed in approval and the stone wall slide to the side. Draco walked through them and down the steps, when he began to hear music. Not just music, but singing. Amateur singing.
He wanted to scream but the curse kept him silent. The quill began to trace round on his arm.
"Let's go."
Ad that moment Vincent walked into the common room with his head in a scroll.
"Hi! Mind if I sit here?" Draco shook his head and gestured to the seat beside him.
“Right, well they’re annoying.” Theo shakes his head. “Where were we?” He lifts Blaise’s head with a finger and gives him a grin Octavia nearly believes. She watches, transfixed, with an awful feeling beginning to pool around her feet.
He’s kind of like the sun. Everyone talks about how amazing it is, and forgets all about how it burns you and melts your wax wings.
“I’m sure it won’t be. Now shut up, Dumbledore is talking.” She hissed to him with a smile. He gave her a look before craning his neck towards Dumbledore like the rest had.
"Leave the kid alone you gossiping gits!" Meredith's voice broke through the whispers directed at Draco. It had been going on since he left the dormitory. Meredith had guided the Ravenclaws back to the Great Hall and was sitting among them all. All of the muggleborns had immediately taken to her, and had set her as their Ravenclaw mother, to answer questions and help them with anything. She took to the role swiftly and had been a comforting presence for any first year.
“Great idea Drako! Ve vill plan a party, perhaps on the ship? Ve vill have to look for an opening, as I vill be busy planning for the first task.” Viktor said and Draco smiled adoringly.
“You saw all of that?”
"At 11 years old? Merlin, you're paranoid."
“No thanks.”
“I’m not lying!”
"Would you like to be in a dorm with me?" Draco asked. Terry made eye contact for a second before looking away.
I am working on a seperate fic alongside this, a rapunzel Drarry AU type deal gone off the rails, so I’ll be posting that in completion eventually. And if you want more content then every so often I update ‘Draco Malfoy the Disaster’ made up of small one shots that I quickly wrote at 1am to do with Slytherins.
Once Narcissa was done mixing he poured out the mixture into the dozen wrappers and smoothed it all down. Draco got out some oven mitts and put the tray into the oven, setting the timer at the top for fifteen minutes.
"So what now?"
Once they got to the hall, they looked on to the sea of students, all surrounding the goblet.
“You are young, yes? Or are you only short?” He questioned her with a Bulgarian accent. She shrugged.
“Why Potter, do you insist on being a stupid sort of git?” Draco gritted and he lunged for the book one last time. He grabbed it and snatched it away from the idiot, brushing off imaginary dust as he clutched it.
“Well don’t try too hard, no offence but I don’t want a fag going after me.” She pinched his cheek and smiled. “That’d be worse than my single life.”
Draco scurried over. “Did I hear abuse? No abuse at the party, cant have that. Blaise, stop provoking Pansy. Pans, don’t rise to his bait, he’s being a twa-twit.” He busied himself with stacking some odd goblets. “No abuse at the party, its got to be perfect, perfectly abuse free, don’t be silly, now where should this fake blood go...” he continued to mutter to himself as he squirrelled the place up. Octavia rolled her eyes.
She pulled out the garment from the others and revealed it to be a small, gorgeous dress. It had dark purple puffy sleeves, easing into a light blue sweetheart neckline. The rest of the torso was a light purple colour, with a sheen of thin blue material over it, giving it a sparkle in the light. The skirt was large and poofy, made up of many layers of dark purple and light blue fabric, giving it an incredible volume that would sway when dancing. On the hem of the skirt it had many small blue gemstones, growing smaller up the dress, reminding Octavia of raindrops. It was beautiful and regal. It was perfect. And it was just her size.
Draco had been dragging her forward as the game continued, practically, falling off the edge of the box as he watched. There was a quite a bit of drama this game, so Draco was even more hooked. The Veela had a couple of mid game encore performances that ended up distracting a whole lot of people. But Draco was having none of it. Nothing could have dragged his attention away from this game.
"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted," she said, "Abbott, Hannah!"
“Don’t call me that. Open your mouth.”
Was he?
"As I was saying, we are to have the honour of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months, an event which has not been held for over a century. It is my great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year." Octavia's eyes bulged out of her head. She'd read about the Tournament before, extensively, but never imagined it would be brought back.
"It definitely d-does. W-When my F-F-Father f-finds out h-he's going to b-b-be m-mad." Draco was once again filled with dread. He breathed in and folded it all away, and put it in a mental drawer.
They both took another sip of their drinks. Draco was beginning to feel a tiny bit tipsy.
Everyone’s always going on about his green eyes, and how they look like his mothers’, or how they sparkle like emeralds or some other nonsense. Doesn’t anyone know colours?! His eyes obviously resemble more of shamrock or parakeet shade than emerald, and in a darker light they take on more of a basil or pine tone. All which are not *emerald* or what everyone says.
“What was that? I couldn’t here?”
"And why was she with you Draco?" Lucius tapped a book onto the boy's head. He looked like he was going to put it back onto the shelf, but instead balanced in on the boy's head.
But it didn’t.
It nearly made Octavia mad with frustration.
"No, now that would be easy, lazy. You deserve to be in a house you belong."
"All of it," Harry said miserably, "the feather won't budge. Maybe I'm not magic..."
This apparent school unity didn’t prevent Viktor from endlessly being found in the library with Granger.
The day started of as mundane as any other for most of the students and staff.
“If I was so spooky, you would actually be scared.” Greg actually looked a little worried.
Then he heard footsteps.
"It's easy to get to your dorm in the dungeons, no separate towers or anything. They won't mind if we steal you for a bit." Draco told her, holding her hand to lead her through the students.
Draco folded his arms, unimpressed. He then gestured to the bottles standing on the floor.
"Fine, Melindarea, he can join the group." He gave in exasperatedly. She cocked her head.
"Yeah! The Mark came from over there!" Weasley gestures into the wood where they heard the noise.
“Will you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
"What the bloody hell are you wearing Potter? That shirt has a blasted hole in it!" He points at Dudley's clothing. I take a closer look at the shirt, and sure enough, it had a small hole near it's frayed hem.
“Ain’t nothing but a mistake-“
“Heh...straight...”
“What?”
“Okay, tell me the secret.” Blaise said.
It was a short kiss. Chaste. Since as soon as it happened Draco broke away giggling.
So put me on! Don't be afraid!
"Sure."
"Terry." Another prompt response. Terry began to shift a bit, his free hand tapping at his leg a lot before he blurted out "I like Quidditch."
Draco tried to go a bit higher to get in front of Potter, only to have his hand kicked by Potter.
Draco hummed uncertainly. “I’m not sure Pansy... “
“Brilliant!” Viktor told him and Draco grinned. After he collected a couple of books that covered the previous tournaments he began to read through them.
“Go away Hermione, please.” He told her without turning around. She cleared her throat.
He figured that was safe to tell them. If he didn’t answer any questions they might become a bit mad, and the shield wouldn’t hold forever.
“Because I’m scared!” Vince cut him off. He quietened and looked down. “These feelings are...really scary. And they’re really strong, and I don’t know what to do, and every time I see him I just-“ he clamps up and looks at Draco. Draco tries to nod encouragingly even though he isn’t very good at this stuff either. Vince takes a breath. “I’m not used to strong feelings, I’m used to being a sort of boulder, an unmoving force. Unfeeling. Strong.” He describes. “And I know that to you I’m just supposed to be this dumb bodyguard who laughs and doesn’t, like, feel and needs to be cruel or whatever but it’s hard. It’s really hard when every time I see Greg my heart just feels so nice. I didn’t know I could get dumber, but when I’m around him, I manage to.” He self deprecates. “And he doesn’t even mind! He doesn’t mind that I’m so stupid, or that I’m bad at school stuff and struggle with reading and can never tell a joke or straighten my tie,” he rambles, “because he still cares about me and treats me well. He’s still my best friend even though I’m such a screw up, and I’ve really screwed it up now because I like him, and it’s gonna ruin everything, and-“ it’s Draco’s turn to cut him off.
"Calm yourself Potter. Besides, it's probably time for bed. I'm absolutely exhausted, for one," and he began swishing his wand about to unpack all of his bags, Virgo resting on his unarmed arm. I agreed with the decision, and began to unpack my things aswell.
“Yep.”
I thought about their chemistry a little bit, how their relationship worked.
“Come on.” Unlike many, instead of dragging Draco somewhere, Vince just offered his hand for Draco to take. Draco did.
Draco’s eyes grazed over the dorm, and he spotted Blaise discussing with the fifth year Leo. Leo was holding a small black box that looked like a camera, and many coloured wires. He then pulled out a couple of disks and a smaller black box, and handed Blaise a...microphone? You know what, Draco dint want to know.
“Thank you Potter, I’d nearly forgotten what had happened two minutes ago, your service is truly noble.” He told him in a deadpan.
"Is it like a very small wave? A thing used as a greeting? Is it something to do with oceans? Are muggles able to control the tides by themselves now?" Draco asked, trying to make sense of the word.
“I’m not, I swear.” Potter looked worried. Draco looked at him with suspicion.
"Stop swearing!" He dropped her from his back onto her feet. Who he considered to be the smarter two of the golden trio joined in with the laughter. He rolled his eyes and crossed his arms, leaning back against a tree. His legs were tired, his brain was frazzled, and he probably had the worst case of bedhead right now. He was done. Octavia sat down next to him and pulled a book out of her satchel, deciding to read to pass however much time they'd spend here. He decided to comb his hair with his fingers as the other three spoke with each other all 'secretly'.
“Boredom? It’s been a while since I’ve meddled. I miss it.” He half answered.
“What do you want, Potter?” Draco asked him with a practised bored but annoyed tone. He subconsciously leant into Blaise and saw Potter notice his movement.
"Oi! Come back here!" Crouch tries to stop them, casting a couple of Stupefies.
"Uh. I like Quidditch." He cringed at his own sentence. The boys were quiet for a moment before Anthony stepped in.
"Get up Potter, I want to get into my bed. I'm tired." He ordered, offering me a hand. I took it hesitantly and he dragged me off my arse. He picked up the bags from Dervish and Banges, the bags from Gladrags already being upstairs from my modelling. I lumbered up the stairs tiredly, Malfoy following me to our dorm. I got one of the keys to open it when I thought of something.
“Stop trying to blame me. Also, your introduction wasn’t as smooth as Octi’s here.” Blaise ruffled her hair. She scowled up at him.
.” Draco stepped in front of Blaise protectively, spitting the name out like a curse.
Moody began to Crucio the spider. This time, no one laughed. Everyone just stared at it in horror as it writhed in agony. Draco clenched his fists into his trouser and tried to keep an impassive expression.
He was so busy he even forgot to worry about the upcoming DADA lesson with Professor Completely Effing Mad!
"My Uncle Levi married a Mudblood last summer, and that's all it took to be removed from the family tree-"
“And I hope you know I do too.” He lumped the body downwards onto a chair and secured it tightly, before systematically tying his arms separately behind the chair, making sure the kid’s hands were free but unable to burn through the ropes. He left the sack on Draco’s head and snorted slightly. That’s what he gets.
"Aren't you supposed to be at the Ravenclaw table?" I asked her. She smiled.
"You what?!" He confronted the
“Lose the smile Drakey, you look more like a boggart.” He scowled at Pansy. “Now come on darling, let’s enjoy the party we organised!” She grabbed his arm and pulled him out of the room.
Draco sighed. He couldn’t believe he was going to do this.
“It’s Arthur Weasley.” Draco corrected absentmindedly. Blaise gave him a weird look and he crossed his arms.
"What? Why?" Draco asked bewildered.
“It’s Halloween you twat, and as you nosy Gryffindors might have heard earlier, Slytherin are having a party. I was forced to cooperate and...dress up.” He put down a couple of the bottles. His arms were tiring.
"Cool, I do too! I can't wait until our first flying lesson. What's your position?"
Potter snorted. “Old times. Can’t believe that’s past tense. Don’t you think it’s weird how we’ve stopped fighting so easily?”
It took longer.
Hermione smiled widly and went to sit at the gold and red table with the applauding students. Draco was happy for her, it was the house she wanted most to be in, but couldn't help but wish that she'd made it into Slytherin, where he'd be.
Hopefully, if they all played it off and acted cool, they could present the sunglasses as a new motif for their gang.
“My brother is a weirdly good singer, but he’s basically a soprano for how high his voice can go.” They giggled together. “I’m the worst singer in the world! When I sing I sound like a Mandrake!” Octavia told Martha.
"Who are these people?" Octavia asked Draco.
"Best brother ever!"
“You’re an idiot. But yeah, that would really help.”
“Malfoy!”
“S’il te plaît, arrête! Vous êtes très jolies mesdames, mais j'ai besoin d'un peu d'espace!” He asked them nicely, prying a couple off of his expensive grey jumper.
“You tell me, you’re the dumb nerd.”
"That's correct sir." Draco confirmed with a smile.
“Do you have any quidditch shorts?” She asked Draco.
"Weird."
“How did you get the sack off your head?” Draco stays silent and sneers. Sirius chuckles. “Whatever.” He walks over to Draco and pets Cushion a bit. Cushion purrs. Draco scowls. Traitor.
They appeared to be arguing, and they all varied drastically. Draco had read about ghosts a lot, they were featured quite a bit in his story book. He even swore he recognised some from the pictures, pulled right out of legend. He clenched his fists excitedly.
He shook it.
“He’s what?!”
“He’s such a handsome dickhole.” Blaise muttered darkly.
"What do I do?"
“I dunno.” He hiccuped through a laugh. “I got the giggles.” He swatted at Blaise’s broad as ever chest. Blaise seemed to come his senses at that.
"I mean, pureblood romance is never anything good. Look at our family trees! Mine looks more like a spiderweb than anything!" Greg snorted and the rest shared their agreements.
"I'll finally have somebody to practice my french with! Other than you of course, Via." He added after her raised eyebrow. She waved him off.
He turned to look and came face to face with an extremely hungover and partied out Draco Malfoy.
"Welcome to pureblood culture! All of this bull..."he reached over to cover Octavia's ears, "shit!" He uncovered them. She scowled up at him and swatted his hands away. He lay down on one of the seats and lay his head in Pansy's lap, letting her stroke his hair.
“I recall otherwise. Anyway, allow ME to acquaint you with Margaux, Chloé, Laure, Amélie, Juliette, Angélique, Elodie, Anais, Morgane, Lucie, Isabelle and Anne.” He introduced them all in one breath to the trio. Each girl gave a little squeal as he referred to them, and some tried to drape themselves over his arms.
Draco was still feeling morose, and walked a couple of steps behind the others in a sulk. Meredith noticed this, and watched as she beckoned Terry towards her. She whispered something in his ear, causing him to smile widely and nod. He then waited a couple seconds for Draco to catch up to him.
"Why the bloody hell d'you care abou' what that poncy blonde git's up to Harry?" Ron asked through his half asleep daze.
Potter nodded. “I promise I won’t tell anyone about the party.”
"You're in the Big Book Of Stories, Tales, Myths and Legends, sir." Draco explained.
“Oh right, it’s Halloween. I’d forgotten.” Potter looked a bit melancholy.
"Fuck the age limit." Blaise said bluntly, ignoring a death glare from Draco. "All of our upper years are terrible. Me, I'd be incredible in the tournament! The best champion Hogwart's had ever seen!"
“It wasn’t just ‘
Draco walked down the stairs and past the sign. Each shelf of books was labelled on the side of it, from Transfiguration to Dark Magic, it seemed to have everything. Draco continued scouring the shelves for what he wanted.
"Hi, your name's Ron, right?"
"The Dark Mark."
“Promiscuous girl, wherever you are,” he spun and changed their positions, “I'm all alone and it's you that I want.” He pointed to her then put a finger over his lips as a shushing motion.

Octavia was then tapped on the shoulder. She turned around and was faced with an ever cheerful Martha Robinson.
“I do not like Viktor Krum! I’m n-not gay.” Blaise rolled his eyes.
"Can't be worse than Umbridge."
"Now this is a classic single word riddle, where you have to think of how it's spelled and take it apart. But an answer just as fitting would be..." She faced the eagle, "a person wearing a blindfold." You could nearly hear the eagle grumbling about 'Ravenclaws these days', before the door opened out. "Thank you Bernie!" Meredith called to the knocker before walking into the common room. The first years followed after her, all in awe.
She saw Draco take a sugar quill out of his pocket and chew on it grumpily. Suddenly Draco turned to her with wide, sad eyes.
First years Draco didn't know continued to be sorted into Ravenclaw, Gryffindor, Slytherin and Hufflepuff in that order. The time it took to sort seemed to vary on the person, such as for Seamus Finnigan, who took over a minute to be sorted into Gryffindor. Most of the children stayed smiling, so Draco imagined that the hat wasn't overtly reading their minds. It didn't do much to quench the nervousness that pooled in the bottom of his stomach.
The second book was the largest book of fairy tales, collected from Wizard and Muggle stories alike. It included the tales of Beedle the Bard, Hogwarts ghost stories, and Muggle princess tales. Draco's personal favourite was the story of how the 12th century Durmstrang boy Pluto, an underestimated and seemingly average Wizard of humble backround, became the greatest dragon tamer of all time. His arch enemy Adrik of the North died in an icy tundra, but Pluto had his trusty pet dragon Dinara to keep him from freezing. He opened up several dragon training camps all over the world and lived out the rest of his life kicking ass while on a dragon. He was Draco's hero and idol.
The Leprechauns did their bit as Octavia tried not to watch. She was rooting for Ireland, sure, but Leprechauns creeped her out a bit. It didn't stop Draco from whooping and cheering for them, only ignoring what he knew were fake Galleons sprinkled down on the spectators. The Leprechauns went to sit for the match and Ludo continued once again. It was getting to the good stuff.
"Definately! As long as you think I won't crush you..." She wiped away the tears that hadn't fallen.
But you can’t always be a winner, because that would mean being good at everything. You need to pick and choose your fights, and always be certain in yourself.
“That isn’t how I look at my friends.”
Everyone seemed to be paying most of their attention towards the champions, even the unofficial one. Which made sense, but little else seemed to be happening apart from swooning over them all. Octavia wondered distantly why Cedric Diggory had been chosen for Hogwarts’ champion. She didn’t really know him, and she highly doubted he was chosen for his fantastically sharp jawline.
"I asked if you think Malfoy's coming back to school this year?" I repeated. An odd expression filled her face as if she was trying not to smirk, and I felt scrutinsed by her gaze.
"You mean Accio-ing him?" Neville asked, looking concerned.
Potter was looking at him. Then he snorted.
"Shut up Potter, before I hex your bollocks."
"For your information, Weasel, I bought that for him. I bought all his stuff because we went shopping together today. And I did that, not for an evil plot, but so that Potter can feel good about the way he looks. So we bought clothes and hair products to tame that mane of his and it was all bloody fine and dandy. So forgive me Weasel, I must have missed something, you see, because I cannot for the life of me comprehend how that makes your best gay." He said this all in a monotone yet condescending voice, staring Ron in the eye the whole time. Ron's eyes had begun to shift away from looking Malfoy in the eye, but Malfoy was persistent.
“Aw, thank you Greg! You’re so sweet!” Greg flushed light pink and Vince scowled slightly. “But you forgot that we now have our local fashionista with us. She’ll be able to make you look gorgeous for whatever event it is. Won’t you, Via?”
And let the cold wash over him.
“Don’t apologise.” She cut off. He blinked in shock.
“Oh! Oh no! I can’t Via! Gravity is increasing on me!” He leaned some of his weight back on her, making her falter.
While the seventh and sixth years were at all different stages of absolutely wasted, the fifth and fourths had managed to keep their alcohol intake under better control. Most of them.
He was still wearing his trousers and socks, but only one shoe (?) and had his tie wrapped around his forehead, mussing up his usually oh so perfect hair. One his stomach in green ink was “THE WEIRD SISTERS” and the cherries on top were his bright pink painted nails and the large bruise on his neck.
“Putting my broom away. Why?”
"And you want to know the worst part?!" Draco jumped to his feet, shocking Harry. He nodded dumbly. "The worst part is the mystery! Most people think a mystery makes something interesting, or that it adds more layers to a story, and you think with a story like that you wouldn't want to know, but you would! And you do! I want to know who that woman was, what she did to end up nearly going to Azkaban, why she did what she did! And I'll never get to know unless the Aurors are suddenly allowed to share their top secret case files with children! But I think I deserve to know!" He exclaimed indignantly, gesturing wildly with his arms. "But no, I have to just call her 'the woman'. And I have to deal with the fact that she'll never be held accountable! Because she killed herself in front of me before I could ever know. And now I'll never. Never know. I've looked up everything in the library! The closest thing I can think of is Schizotypal Personality Disorder, but it doesn't quite check out, and there's no curse for it." He stopped his rage to think. "Now I'm realising how insensitive I'm being to you, as if you don't know how it feels, but both of your parents kind of died...sorry..." He finished awkwardly, rubbing his arm.
"It's when McGonagall checks up on how I'm handling Hogwarts."
“I’ll keep that in mind.”
"Sure! If you're sure you'd want to, my carriage is empty other than for me."
“Being queer is pretty awful.” She told him, prodding his arm. “You’d be in big trouble if it got out.”
“Yeah! Friendship! It’s called FRIENDSHIP.”
He pursed his lips and walked over to the sofa where Potter was snoring.
"You can't do that to a teacher! And if he's as bad as you're saying he is, he'd have you expelled!"
SIBLING POV CHANGE
“Gah!” Both Potter and him shrieked in unison. Draco jumped up and Potter dropped him, landing him on his arse.
"Thank you Neville, but I don't need saving. It's not a big deal anyway. I suspect his head being full of Popty-Pings, a close cousin to the Wrackspurts. It gives the afflicted an ego and makes them confused enough to suffer delusions for weeks at a time. I've tried recommending ways to get rid of them, eating plenty of salty food, keeping a daisy behind your ear to lure them out, holding the back of a teaspoon to your forehead for a couple of hours, and so on. Of course, you need to want them to leave, so I suppose the Popty-Pings will continue to fester until they've eaten all of his earwax. Once they do, they'll bite through his eardrum, leaving him deaf." Luna responded evenly, even happily. I made concerned eye contact with Neville, who shrugged and mouthed "search me".
“Agreed.” They shook on it.
Fucking stupid relatives always making shit more difficult. Why couldn’t he have been born into a happy and well rounded family? Like literally any other family.
He opened his eyes and was looking at the floor. It was...big. The flagstones were...big.
“I’m sorry, Blaisey-kins, I know it’s your dream to date me-“

“AND WE’LL ONLY BE MAKING IT RIGHT!”
"Late never and punctual is Pureblood a; 16 Number Rule!" The boy's voice grew louder as his father gave the first hit to his arms. "Them between heir a create will and ge-" The boy was interrupted by the thwick of the cane on his arm. With a sharp look from his father, he continued. "Gender opposite the of Pureblood another court will Pureblood a, age of is one when; 15 Number Rule." The boy straightened his back determinedly. So far no book had fallen off of the pile atop his head, and he had not stuttered. He only needed to make it through one more hit and he was free. "Educated well is Pureblood a - AGH!" The third hit came. This one was harsher than the others, and most most likely heated up to burn by Lucius' spells. It drew blood from the boys arms, and nearly caused the boy to lose balance. One of the books nearly toppled and the boy brought his hands up in fear to steady the pile, blood dripping down his arms in large clots, staining his robes and carpet.
“Oh, will it turn back at midnight?”
He could feel his face heat up. "Shut up! It's not 'another Potter thing' or whatever you're thinking. I have a genuine reason to talk to the git." He decided to ignore their eye rolls because he was a better person than they were.
"Yeah, we are."
It was promptly pushed away by Moody’s gravelling voice returning once again.
“Yes, come on pree-tee boy!” Aleksander begged, and Draco heard that
They continued talking until the house elves were clearing everything away. The walked down to the Slytherin dormitories together, arms linked, by the end of it.
By the time we got to the steps of the castle, the scars in the stone were a bit more obvious, but not as severe as I'd expected them to be. The castle looming above me was comforting for once instead of intimidating, and looked lovingly familiar. I could see most of the Eighth years by this point, and was pleased to find a couple of familiar faces. Neville and Luna were obviously here, talking with each other and pointing at the scars of the castle I expect they'd fixed, Susan Bones, Lavender Brown, Millicent Bulstrode, The Patil sisters, Seamus, who was having a piggyback on Dean's back, Goyle, and Parkinson and Zabini, who seemed to be looking around for someone while whispering to one another. There were a surprising amount of Eighth Years considering the circumstances, and I was happy to know that not too many had been affected by the war that badly, although there were still less than half the year in total.
The unfashionable boy tries to combat Draco next, attempting to hit him with a couple disarming charms. Draco dodges them all, rolling and jumping behind furniture.
“Mind if I join you?” Blaise bounced his eyebrows. Draco bit his thumb at him again.
“I know about sex, Draco.” He spat out his water, causing Pansy and Blaise to burst out laughing. Greg and Vince didn’t, however, and instead looked at Octavia with similar horror.
Where those of wit and learning,
"Boot, Terry!"
"You-Know-Who was in Slytherin?"
I stared up at the stars as a comfort and felt myself drifting away again, the soft blue light blurring as my eyes began to close shut once more to fall asleep.
"O-Oh, sorry, sh-she's just someone f-from a fairy tale." He was usually better at keeping in his internal comparisons of people to characters.
“J’m'appelle Margaux Elliot.” She replied, tossing her hair over one shoulder. “And zis ees Chloé, Laure, Amélie, Juliette, Angélique, Elodie, Anais, Morgane, Lucie, Isabelle et Anne.” She introduced each of the girls in turn, rapid fire. He scarcely kept track before they were all over him again.
“Please don’t let it be Diggory! He is so out of wack!” She heard Blaise pray to himself, his head rested on his interlocked hands, looking distressed. She leaned over to give him a comforting pat on the shoulder.
“You know then?”
There wasn’t really a spell that could heal a bruise, that was a potion’s job, but Draco couldn’t bring himself to brew this late at night. A type of concealment charm would have to do.
And not ten seconds after I thought this, Ron came bursting in through the common room doors with Hermione on his arm.
Draco pursed his lips. “I’m only seventeen, it’s not like I spent a lifetime there.”
“Alcohol, you pathetic sod.”
“Right.” She rolled her eyes. “Your truce.” She sounded quite bothered but then it clicked.
“Stop it! You’re so weird!”
After a short while in the cold, from over the forest flew a gigantic powder blue horse-drawn carriage. What a tacky colour. It was lead by a dozen large pegasi that Octavia recalled from many illustrations in her magical creature books. They looked far better in person. As the carriage began it’s descent, many first and second years were forced to move backwards before it landed on them. Martha grabbed her hand and positively sprinted as a large wheel nearly grazed their heads.
“It’s a shame Hogwarts doesn’t have a drama club,” Octavia said, “since instead of putting your dramatics to good use you take it out on me.”
“And why is that?” Draco set himself up for rant for the good of Blaise. He was an incredible friend.
"Um, eventful. I'll explain later, do you want to go to the library?" Draco asked.
"Of course I'm a legend, I'm legendary!" Draco refrained from mentioning that the ghost's life and death were considered more cautionary fairy tales. The other students were watching in awe as Draco talked to the smug ghost, some cowering away from the pearly white form as he floated upwards. "So which one of you little first years cares to hear the legend of the great, the incredible, the breathtaking -!"
Draco scrunched his nose at Viktor’s question. “Decidedly not. She’s a Gryffindor.”
“Malfoy! Are you okay?” Draco jumped to his feet in surprise and turned to where the voice cam from.
Where dwell the brave at heart,
“I know about the no straight thing, not about the Potter thing!” She gasps. “Is there a Potter thing?!” Her mind reels. “Is there a fucking
Bulgaria was doing terribly, one hundred and twenty points behind Ireland, a real low this far into the game. After a foul from Bulgaria, the Veela began to dance again, and it was then that Octavia noticed something.
"Malfoy's don't blush, Potter, and what was that about a truce?" I held out my hand and he shook it firmly.
“What?”
He felt stupid to have found it scary of all things, because out of all the ways he was a coward, he didn’t want to be a cowardly kisser.
"I wonder what tasks will be held!"
"There's kind of a riot going on..." Draco mentioned.
“Would you like any company to help you find things?” Draco asked politely.
“Hmmm...”
While Martha gossiped with some other girls about pairings she’d seen sneak off to the dorms together, Octavia decided to do some people watching.
need the practice." He slapped her on the arm.
Ludo Bagman.
“Thank you for the support Pansy, you’re a national treasure.” He nibbled on the end of his quill. “Let’s get to the Great Hall, I’m feeling kind of hungry.”
“Not you then?”
He was what she didn’t win. She deserved him as a prize, he was oh so special, and it would finally give her a significant one up above all the other Slytherin girls, especially the one who spread around her comparison to a pig, even to stupid mudbloods.
“Maybe because this is a school of magic?” Blaise said sarcastically, bending down to pick Draco up.
“Shut up.”
"Don't patronise me, slut." Blaise and Pansy burst out laughing while Draco started screeching about "SWEARING!" and whatnot.
"Another Malfoy, huh? How interesting..."
“The one,” he posed, “the only,” he posed again, “King of Pop!” He raised his arms to the right of him and looked forward, probably referencing something. Draco gave him a blank look.
"She a-asked to come with me. She w-wanted to go ou-outside." He straightened his back further and puffed out his chest slightly. Stay strong. No one likes weaknesses.
“I don’t really think I ought to know anymore-“
"Was no problem really, this one 'ad lost 'er purse an' was close to cryin'. Was the leas' I could do." He answered bashfully, taking a lick of his ice cream and getting some in his beard. Draco put away his handkerchief.
“I won’t tell,” Potter began and
He’d always loved the stars. Those pretty dots in the sky that told a million tales. He always figured they were the best story tellers.
The boy looked frazzled and took a step back as Draco realised he'd been leaning forward.
"It works on live things. Do you want to try?" Draco asked.
He roles his eyes. “Does everything have to be muggle?” Pansy giggled.
Draco yawned and sighed. “Yep.” He popped the ‘P’.
Next up was Blaise and Theo.
"I decided that I needed a new wardrobe. You know, stuff that isn't just Dudley's hand me downs. Especially since we're not going to wear uniform anymore." Ron nodded along and started making grabby hands towards the bags.
"Oh, I'm sorry sweetheart, but how old are you again?" Narcissa asked Draco while she mixed the ingredients together. Draco's shoulder's slumped slightly. She'd been the only one at his party scarcely a month ago. And she'd already forgotten.
"Oh nice, a German name, right?"
“I would but all I hear is a dumb nerd talking.”
“Uh, Pansy? Can you help me out please?” Draco showed his nails to her and she guffawed.
"Hey Draco, you're weird friends are here." She tapped him on the shoulder.
But still....no Malfoy?
They made it to the class with seconds to spare.
“Potter.”
. He forgot about that.
"Oh Potter, you've no idea how long I've wanted to do that." He tried to organise his hair back to the apparent mop I had.
"Is that Malfoy and a mini Malfoy?" Weasley's voice broke through from behind the two siblings. He turned around to come face to face with the golden trio. He scowled and crossed his arms. Octavia looked quite angry, passing her book and satchel over to Draco and rolling up her sleeves.
For a single second everything stood still.
"What did you have last lesson?" Draco asked Hermione, getting used to tuning Michael out.
Gonna be honest I wrote this is in the dead of night as a fever dream because it was snowing where I was.
Blaise walks over to her too.
“Let’s close the curtains.” Draco said as he pulled them shut around the bed. Then it was just him and Blaise, sitting on a dark bed, shrouded in green light. Draco thought Blaise looked rather fetching in green. It was a good thing he was a Slytherin. Draco giggled and grinned at Blaise.
Draco Malfoy was a very pureblood person. As pureblood as you could get. As they’d joked plenty of times, if you went through his family tree it began to look more like a bush. It was a miracle he was the way he was.
The all sat down together at the Slytherin table. As Draco sat down he noticed Octavia sitting with the first years. At first he was elated, but then he noticed that she wasn’t talking with anyone. She was just...existing. She nodded and laughed but she didn’t add anything. She wasn’t really present.
"Set up the fireplace then. Or make some tea. Or boooooottthhhh." I whined back, burrying myself into the squishy sofa cushions. He sighed tiredly and reluctantly got up and shot a lazy "Incendio" towards the fireplace which cast the logs alight, and trudged into the kitchen to hopefully make me some tea.
"Oh, the uh...the one in Mrs Malfoy's kitchen."
“Then keep your fat mouths shut!” Said Potter, before dragging the other two away. Draco scowled after him.
“Right...” Blaise trails off.
Many death eaters who survived the war felt betrayed by this act. That the Malfoy family were disloyal and cowardly. And none thought this more so than Bellatrix Black, Narcissa Malfoy’s estranged sister.
“Really?”
"Don't worry about the sorting at all. It doesn't matter what house you'll be in, Mother and Father already have one Slytherin child, so it's no pressure. And no matter which house you'll be sorted into, I'll be the loudest and most embarrassing clapper, and you know Pansy, Blaise, Greg and Vince will all be cheering for you as well. So stop the worrying in that little brain of yours. It's going to be fine." She gave him a big hug.
"I did." Harry said. "But I can't remember."
Something feels off about this train ride, but not in the usual 'oh right I'm an Eighth year with Seventh years and there's a distinct lack of First years' off feeling, but something that's different from the norm of train rides. We haven't been disturbed in our carriage, which is change I guess...I got it! Malfoy hasn't passed by out carriage to offer some entertaining bigotry or Slytherin's are awesome themed remark! It's a constant I didn't realize I missed but now I can't stop thinking about it. I wonder if Malfoy is even on the train? Is he coming back for Eighth year? Are any Slytherin's coming back? I spoke for him at his trial and saw that he was excused of all charges, but I would understand if he isn't. Draco Malfoy's always been an odd constant for the Hogwarts life, whether it be his biting insults and remarks, his actually challenging opposition in Quidditch, or his 'Evil' schemes, which turned out to actually be evil in Sixth year, he has always been around.
“That still doesn’t prove anything. You’re just trying to spread your gay agenda.”
“I really don’t.”
"You leave my sister out of this!" Draco began struggling more frantically, kicking Crouch in the shin and escaping from his grip, immediately going to cover Octavia.
“You could at least tell me what it’s about, you know.” Potter pouted and put down his heavy book. Draco held Fleeing With Katrina close to his chest.
“And I told you that’s bullshit. You hooked up at the Halloween party over a week ago and you’ve been hooking up ever since and you’re. Still. Not. Open?” She emphasised each word with a clap.
She excused herself from the table to go marching after the indignant Gryffindor. He was flouncing through the entrance, looking to be heading towards the Great Lake. Octavia sprinted slightly to catch up.
When the Slytherins got the classroom, the Gryffindors were already there. This filled Draco with a stupid amount of annoyance.
“Like kissing my cousin.”
“It’s not my fault you were such a git for the better part of three years!”
"Microwaves aside, we should probably go to Transfiguration." Hermione said, packing away the book she was practising with.
“A boy? Like, a secret friend or...”
"And I have a couple of things I'd like to know about the wizarding world." She said back bossily, standing her ground. They both ended up staring each other down with Neville in the middle, both wanting information and on a quest to get it.
I realize now that I went completely over the line but I don't want to talk to her again for a while, and I'm happy staying away from all other Weasley's other than Ron and George. Ugh. Even in my head it feels wrong not to include Fred. I've tried putting on a brave face for everyone but I'm not as stable as everybody in the wizarding world thinks I am. I only hope that The Prophet doesn't catch word that their beloved Chosen One is actually tearing at the seams. I did all that I could in that one week in Grimmauld Place trying not to let the paper's catch word of me and Ginny's breakup. I can imagine the heading now:
"Who's that?"
The golden trio kept on watching their exchange like nosy gits, ever so confused as they so often were.
“Like a best friend costume?” Draco asked innocently.
“Draco, are you okay?”
“Romance isn’t a story, Malfoy. Tell me the plot. Who are the characters?” Potter prattled on.
“You want to know Granger? Really?” He bit back the fact that she was a mudblood.
"The problem IS that I lifted the desk, Hermione." Draco tried explaining. Why didn't anyone see? He was imperfect. That was BAD.
“-of all the stupid things you could say? You think I’m going to steal your boyfriend-“
“LEAVE IT!” Moody yelled at him and everyone flinched.
He was in front.
“Nice costume Pansy.”
“Oooh, tell me, tell me.” Draco ordered, hitting his fist on Blaise’s leg.
After Snape was done with the register, he put it away and stood menacingly in front of the classroom, as if about to deliver a speech. Because of the apparent dramatics he possessed, Draco guessed he would.
Over the next couple of days, a cloud of suspense hung over Draco. He took to all of his other classes with earnest (admittedly his Care of Magical Creatures lessons less so) but he was dreading one.
Draco raised an eyebrow and sneered. “There’s no need to keep taking the piss.”
It was an idyllic way to go, and he knew he was purposefully focusing on the sky full of stars rather than the sickening crunch his back would make as it hit the floor, but he didn’t care. He let himself relish in the image of him falling through a pretty night sky, dying tragically young.
“Who else? I’m not sure if Granger has any other friends.”
"You lost it?" He asked, bewildered.
“You sure? You don’t need any help with your costume...?”
"I shall return when we are ready for you," she said. "Please wait quietly." She left the chamber.
"What's a Howler?" She asked.
"Thanks Potter," Draco replied, closes off. Potter frowned.
She was raised to be one. She was good at winning.
Don't get him wrong, he liked Terry and Anthony and, albeit a little less the loud personality of Michael, but he missed discussing the differences between the muggle world and the wizard one with Hermione. All three Ravenclaw boys were half-blood, so they only knew as much as Draco, probably less. He missed Neville as well, as even though he knew less, he was very interested in Draco as a person. He was actually interested in who Draco was, a thing Draco had never really encountered before. And both of them didn't care if he blabbered on.
“Why’r laughing?” Blaise asked dazedly. Draco laughed some more.
“I didn’t put my name in.” You could make out him telling his friends. “You know I didn’t.” The hall was so quiet and his monotone was unnerving.
"Do you approve of this Draco?" Hermione suddenly dragged the nervous blonde into him.
“Language.” Draco admonished out of instinct even though Octavia wasn’t there. “And they won’t kill you if they never find out. Here, take this.” He handed Potter the last hangover potion. Potter eyed it wearily. “I’m to trying to poison you, it’s a hangover potion. It’ll help with the pain.”
Draco, priding himself in his intelligence and problem solving ability, often struggled with change. Especially a problem he couldn’t solve. Happened when he went to Hogwarts and wasn’t adored constantly, happened after the World Cup after being confronted by Aurors and not knowing how to fix it, and happened when he was very young and Octavia was born. It seemed now was another one of those times. He just could not figure out what was going on with the boy who lived, and this being a great passion of his, he wasn’t handling it.
"Well, we'd love to stick around and chat but-"
And he wasn’t obsessed with Potter! He just made sure he knew where he was at all times! You know, for defence! And it made great entertainment to rile him up, and so easy too. You only had to insult his friends or dead parents to get him angry as all hell. It was hilarious!
“What?” Potter looked confused.
Krum smiled at her. “Good to meet you. Viktor Krum is my name.” He introduced himself. Octavia hummed in fake cluelessness.
"Yes."
"I was just - um - I was only, I was only handflapping Sir." Terry stumbled over his words.
“Vince, I’m going to tell you something true and you need to promise to listen.” He laid out.
"It's a small box that you use to reheat food. It uses electricity." Hermione explained.
I woke up to clear vision, and in my sleep inebriated state, I thought that I'd regained my vision completely. Then I realized I was wearing my glasses and the illusion of being healed was shattered, giving me a disappointing start to my day.
Danny and Martha had joined in the staring in either side of her to stare in amazement.
“I’m not the one who was amazed by Scooby Doo.” Potter said and Draco thought that was a bit unfair.
“Ain’t nothing but a heartbreak-“
“I am standing right here.” He reminded them, feeling ignored. He sat down with Potter at the table.
“Am I? Am I really?”
It’s a bad joke told in a monotone, only electing a chuckle out of one person.
"I see your point, but what I don't get is how someone like Weaselby managed to snag someone like Granger. I just doesn't make sense." I looked at him questioningly, offended on Ron's behalf, but curious on Hermione's.
I was frozen in disbelief. In shock. In befuddlement. I was fucking confused. Why were we rooming together? There had to be some mistake. While I was having my internal (and probably external) panic, I saw Malfoy walking up to the end of the hallway where I was.
“They were your trashy romance novels.” Pansy snorted loudly before continuing laughing harder, while Draco decided he might just
“Come on, you big baby, stop crying! We need to get Draco back to normal, he’s having one of his ‘moments’.” She dragged him through the halls, struggling somewhat at the weight difference.
Octavia jumped on the care packages filled with cake and treats. There was twice as much as there would be usually, half of it for Octavia. Very early on, Narcissa discovered Draco's love of all things sweet and sugary, so she supplied him with plenty to ward his sugar starved bitchiness until Hogsmead. He would admit that he was more than a little addicted to sweets, especially chocolate. But that was fine. No one really knew anyway. He raised his gaze across the hall and met Potter's eyes. Potter's eyes widened slightly before he looked away with a frown.
"Let's have a tea party." She took Draco by the hand, a gentle tug being all he needed to leave the room with her. Before he did, he gave his father a quick bow, and rushed out of the dark room with her.
"Oh uh yeah, I haven't quite gotten the hang of it, and you seem to be really good at it." Pfft, hardly. Opposed to what everyone was saying, managing to lift a desk instead of a feather was a show of failing, not of power. He'd rectified his mistake and would practice it later that night in the dorms. "I also heard that you're a pretty good teacher."
But she then noticed a small movement in the lake. Some unusual ripples. They were difficult to make out in the dark, but she didn’t have to try too hard as they began to grow larger and larger, until they appeared as a large whirl pool.
After a quick reminder that no souls were in the tely-vision, Potter explained to the many helpless drunk Slytherins that the way they did it was they layered on picture on another to make it look like they moved. They then recorded it with the camera that makes long animated photos, and it worked the same way. He called it ‘muggle magic’. Potter looked happy to explain this all, and probably thought of himself as smart just because he knew about muggle stuff. Draco let him have it as long as he wouldn’t get a big head.
“Just don’t corrupt Via.” He walked over to her. “Go to bed soon.” He kissed her on the crown of her head and walked off as an indignant blushing mess.
Draco also picked out some books for school, some to do with advanced Defense Against the Dark Art, which was a surprise, as well as many large hardcovers on fun charms. He told her he wanted to make this year the most fun and interesting for her, and was dedicated to it. She let him go on with it. They both needed a bit of a laugh.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Shhhhhh, yes you are darling, now be still while your incredible girlfriend Pansy works her magic.” Draco had no choice but to give in.
"What do you need from us Mister Malfoy?" One shy house elf wearing blue rags asked.
"And so in conclusion Potter," Malfoy titled his head with a tight smile, his face coming closer to mine. "YOU ARE THE RICHEST MAN IN ALL OF BRITAIN!" I was not expecting that exclamation.
He scouted and hunted for a book that could have anything to do with the topic. He picked out Hogwarts Houses And Their Meaning, Maybe I'm In The Wrong House and The Sorting Ceremony's Sanctity as good places to start. He sat down on the carpeted floor and leant against a dusty bookshelf in an empty corner of the library. He began with reading Maybe I'm In The Wrong house.
“Martha Robinson. From what I’ve heard about you from ‘Tavia, you’re a right twat.”
“Don’t remind me.” He glanced at his cup. “I think I’m getting a little bit drunk. Do you know what it’s like to be drunk?” He asked.
"Yes, I know plenty about Hogwarts. But tell me, are you a muggleborn?" He questioned, mentally preparing parchment to take notes on.
“Oh, yeah, I know.”
They sat down in silence for a little while.
on the annoyance that you’re champion, maybe even a supporter of Diggory.” He schemed.
"I'll go with you then." Terry said. "Draco?"
"Just because of a Hogwarts house? That's crazy!"
“Are you going to do anything with your hair...” he began to ask and trailed off as he realised Potter’s hair looked the exact same as it usually did. Potter nodded with his realisation.
“He’ll be with Pansy in the common room, and watching them be ‘romantic’ together is the best entertainment since theatre was invented. Draco could almost pass as straight.” Octavia looked up at Blaise in slight surprise.
He was determined to do at least one thing on that list by his eighteenth birthday.
Draco knew the answer. It was 'a promise'. But he didn't want to interrupt the fun just yet.
“Pffft, and if word got out, who would believe us? As you said, we’re mere school children! And Slytherins no less! It would be our word against his. He already said I could fight it off, who’s to say I wasn’t trying to draw the mark on myself?”
'You think he's up to something sketchy?'
“First day and already a swotty overachiever.” She scowled up at him.
But before anyone could take a single bite of the food in front of them, the great Hall's doors slammed open to reveal none other than...Draco Malfoy?
“Ooh, I like it. I asked my mum to send me a little dress i have, and I’m going to plait my hair and be a creepy doll.” Martha explained with big hand movements. Octavia smiled.
“Family roots? Some family tree you got there Malfoy, looks more like a spiderweb than anything.” Weasley added oh-so-helpfully. Draco flushed angrily at him because it was no that bad!
“-he killed my parents-“
“Alcohol for preteens?”
“This is the Slytherin table.” Draco pointed out.
“Blaise you idiot, what the hell? That wasn’t funny, that was painful and dumb and rude et si irresponsable, pourquoi avez-vous pour moi un tel co tout le temps, je me fiche de votre flirt, mais cette fois c'est allé trop loin. Alors arrêtez d'être un tel diable spawn pendant cinq minutes pendant que je suis arrivé à l'infirmière, s'il vous plaît!” He yelled at Blaise, the boy still grinning like a motherfucker next to Octavia. Potter was still staring at him. “You can go now Potter. Blaise will only try and drag you into something else stupid.” The boy flushed and nodded, speed walking in the opposite direction.
“Oh I didn’t just imply it, I said it. You’re a pervert.” Pansy said to him, hugging Draco tighter.
It's size reminded Draco of the manor's ballroom, except instead of a large chandelier, the room was lit with flaming torches. A marble staircase led them all to the upper floors. Draco could hear babbling from further along and deduced that the rest of the school were already there. It would make sense, since only the first years could use the boats across the lake, and they needed a large audience for the sorting.
, he’s all muscle.” He glanced over to said boy. Blaise flexed a muscle and winked, and Draco turned away with a flush.
They stepped into a wide circular room filled with blue. It has graceful arched windows which were hung with blue and bronze silks. There was a  midnight blue carpet, which Draco particularly liked, covered in stars. It reflected onto the domed ceiling, giving the incredible illusion of a night sky, reminiscent of the Great Hall. The room was furnished with blue tables, chairs, and a divan. There were many oohs and aahs coming from the new Ravenclaws as they admired the room. The walls had paintings of famous Ravenclaws, and Draco could make out Laverne de Montmorency, inventor of love potions, lying back on a divan herself within her portrait. The room was lit by lanterns that hung between the many windows, each one a different shade of blue with a flame inside. Draco saw some of the older years gathered around one, messing about by casting colour charms on the glass and changing it from blue to red to green yellow to blue again.
He refuses to let Potter’s hands on his face and his thumb on his cheek have so much control over him.
“My heart and soul!” Blaise flings himself towards her and leans over her dramatically. “Please accept it if you will!”
"I know right," replied Anthony.
. . .
His hands were still shaking. He felt scared.
"What do you want Malfoy?" Weasley asked him, narrowing his eyes. Draco rolled his.
“They’ll never find the body.” He taunted. At the expressions flickering through Potter’s face Draco let out a laugh. “I’m joking, you take everything so seriously.” He turned to the audience. “Potter gets a one time pass here. He promised not to tell anyone about the party as long as he could attend.” He told the Slytherins, watching them nod at Potter’s tactic. “But I have sworn him to secrecy, and I trust you all to keep an ear out for any word of Potter snitching.” The group all nodded obediently and Draco smiled. “Fantastic. You may remove the ropes and go to breakfast now.” He allowed cordially.
She found herself in a large room with four separate beds, each with green bedding. It was then that her exhaustion hit her. Two of the four beds were already taken, so she took the one closest to the corner. One of the girls in the room was Martha Robinson.
"Octi, Octi, always such a meanie, Octi, Octi, the mean octopus." Draco sang as he carried her, wincing as she pulled his hair. "Octi, Octi, always such a..." He trailed off when he heard some voices talking in the woods.
But the best part of the night was nearing the end, after midnight, when Martha had pulled her out of the dorm excitedly to do something sneaky.
A feigned gasp. "You take that back!"
“Not yet I’m not. Just wait until tonight!”
Danny was back to gaping, this time at the female Durmstrang students. Octavia gave him another sharp elbow and a sharp look.
"S.P.E.W is an organistaion I started in Fourth year advocating for house elf rights. It stands for the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare."
"Well..." She gave him a look. A motherly look, if he remembered one correctly. A look that made him feel small, an 'I'm right, you're wrong' look, a look you'd have to be made of solid steel to resist giving in.
"Who's there?" Potter asked.
“Great deduction Potter, aren’t you clever. Impeccable Latin skills.” He sarcastically congratulated him. “On another note, have you thought of your favour yet?”
“Oh, I thought the great slag Blaise Zabini was up for anything?” Theo smirked and they seemed fine for a minute. They were both laughing.
"Well we better hurry. We only have 2 minutes." Michael said, hurrying them along.
“Well...I mean... I have plenty of time for all of that, right now I want to focus on best first impressions to the professors!” He raised an eyebrow at her.
“We are only in second year.” He reminded her. She shrugged.
Shelly seemed a bit transfixed, albeit amused, by their presence in the room. They swam around a bit for them, seeming to want to show off their tale. It was rather lovely after all.
“I expected more from you, to be honest. When I had my first Transfiguration lesson, my matchstick was a needle by the end of it!” She stuck out her tongue at him.
“Excellent!” He called out over the great hall in delight. “Well, we now have our three champions. I am sure I can count upon all of you, including the remaining students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster. By cheering your champion on, you will contribute in a very real-“ he cut himself off. Or, rather, the goblet did.
"Non, nous ne pouvons aller nulle part sans Madame Maxime. Merci pour votre temps. Et vous avez un excellent français!" The curly haired girl replied, giving a sad smile.
After Pansy had glittered up his face and hair, he’d gotten to work carefully charming each of Octavia’s eyes to appear plain black. After he was done with making her look ‘super spooky’ she fucked off elsewhere, leaving him in the terrifying hold of Pansy. He felt like he was being held at wand point as he stuck the poster to the shirt. He’d had to steal one of Blaise’s shirts, he needed one that lacked buttons.
“Good.”
somehow. Like you could see it’s soul leave it’s body.
Those insipid wiry frames that look like they were less than a pound. Poor glasses, being so close to those shamrock/parakeet/basil/pine eyes all day. Draco’s pretty sure Potter was born with those things. It would match the rest of him. All thin, wiry, cheap and easy to break.
"Okay then, we can leave the warmth." He agreed reluctantly, with a hint of a whine. I tried to get up to grab my satchel off of the edge of my seat when I realised that Malfoy was still grabbing my hand.
“You’re not a monster Draco.” Pansy told him. “You’re a big sympathising baby who cries over romantic tragedies.” He sent her a glare.
"Or drinking that potion! I heard it tastes disgusting!" He shivered in disgust. They grinned at each other in a shared understanding of intelligence and I could just tell this wasn't going to bode well for me nor Ron. Nor anyone else for that matter.
"Neville. Neville Longbottom." Ah, a Longbottom. One of the Sacred 28. Draco had heard of him. His parents had been tortured to insanity by his 'Aunt Bella'. He guiltily felt closer to Neville as he thought about the state of his own mother. Neville took his hand and Draco heaved him up.
“See you after weirdo.”
“Harry Potter!” Draco yelled, jumping to his feet and resting his hands flat on the shield. Potter also jumped at the exclamation, looking at Draco oddly. Sirius sighed loudly.
As he got to the 20th page of the book he realised that he probably won't find anything to help his problem. It was an amateur book written by a group of students that only contained a lot of waffle about accepting yourself who you are and steroetypes and yadda yadda yadda. It was the furthest thing from helpful he could have found.
Weasley then snatched the paper out of his hands and scanned it, Potter and Granger peering at it from behind him. His face then went red for a different reason and Draco tried to hide a smirk. Blaise did not.
“Who are they?”
“-the storm never slept, and neither did we! We were all wrapped up in blankets, terrified and cold, when of course my grandma decides that this would be the best time to talk about my aunt Lucille’s recent divorce-“
“Wait, why are you out here?” Draco asked him, picking up the broom and pointing it at him accusingly.
SIBLING POV CHANGE
“You’re the greatest ever Drakey-kins.” She pat his hair. He let her. “Did we kiss last night or was that a dream?” She asked and he grimaced.
"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can." Draco caught her glancing at Neville's cloak, which was fastened under his left ear. Instinctively Draco went in front of him and immediately starting smarting him up, refastening his cloak properly, and smoothing out the creases. He'd had practice from Narcissa's many questionable fashion choices over the years so he was adept at making Neville look more suitable. Hermione watched all this with a smirk.
“And professor Moody. It’s how the whole thing started. Moody...acted like a jerk to my brother in class.”
“I don’t see what the problem is in people thinking you got some last night.” Blaise said, smirking.
The kid looked at him with horror. Sirius shrugged. “Just one item, but it can’t be a weapon. I’m not a monster.” The kid continued to stare at him.
“But...why now?”
He might find Potter to be all these things, and the realisation might make his heart hurt and his ears throb and his eyes mist and his face burn a bright red but he’ll still keep all of that a secret.
“Don’t call me that! In public or EVER!” She hissed at him like a bedraggled cat, black mascara dripping to the left of he eye.
“As it turns out, no.” Harry’s face fell. “I’ll explain in a bit. But first I gotta get this guy into the house and secured.” Harry’s gaze flittered to the side car and he jumped back slightly.
Blaise being pinned against a wall and kissing Theo Nott.
“As sad and lonely as that it, it doesn’t answer my question of why you’re here. Outside the kitchens. Just where I happen to be.” His eyes widened. “Were you stalking me?”
"I already have some peppermint tea ready, it'll be no problem."
“It’s always Potter.”
That was Blaise won over too then
“Draco!” Blaise yelled in his face. He grabbed Draco’s head and turned it towards the dance floor where Greg and Vince were talking. “They’re having a moment.” Draco pursed his lips. They did look like they were getting cosy. He didn’t want to interrupt any progress, and he certainly didn’t want to be a third wheel.
The kid had been missing for god knows how long, and raised by the one and only psychopath of Bellatrix Lestrange. He admits to wondering where she was when all of the Death Eaters were put into Azkaban, including her husband, but he never expected her to take to child care.
), and a large wooden panel they called an ‘Oo-wee-jee board’. It was apparently used to summon evil spirits, and was incredibly popular, but the siblings banned it from being used before Halloween. It would ‘spoil the mood’. They were even more excited when Draco announced that he supposed they could use all of these items for the Halloween party he was arranging on the 31st.
"So you stole them?!" Draco exclaimed, nearly dropping his ice cream. This was just grand, now he'd have to go back and pay double and apologise and there was now a chance of getting banned, and he couldn't get his precious answers from Harry Potter!
"I'm feeling happy today. What about you, my duckling?" Draco flushed happily at the nickname. That nickname meant she was feeling more grounded. It was more likely that she wasn't going to have one of her turns.
I hope you enjoyed this chapter! This was the most fun to write, but I did use a bit of dialogue from the books. (I obviously don't own Harry Potter). I will flesh out Terry's character more, as well as the other Ravenclaw boys. I'm kind of rewriting them as new characters compared to whatever dialogue snippets they had in the book. These boys are now mine. I adopted them. #RavenclawBois
Looking at all of the decorations, Draco tried his best not to think about how purely Ravenclaw this was. He was meant to be in the dungeons right now, being led by Professor Snape into the green and silver themed dormitories.
Just in case.
Draco gagged. “Ew, nonce alert much?”
"Who are you calling mini?" Octavia asked defensively, fists clenched. Weasley looked like he was about to laugh.
“Do it yourself coward.” Draco rebutted, ignoring Nott’s grabby hands for the hangover potion. “I’m too busy for your shit.”
“At least my family tree is free of blood traitors and Weasels.”
Potter looked even more confused as Draco shoved some alcohol into his arms. “Malfoy, what are you-“
“It’s been okay.” She answered. “I have a bit of Charms homework I need to complete before tomorrow so that’s hanging over my head.” She grimaced.
“I ‘ave returned! My name is now in the goblet! And I will be chosen for the ...tour-nor-ment!” Another Durmstrang boy, Aleksander, sat down and announced loudly.
“Mine too, it was awful-“
Octavia nodded. “It’s okay.” She agreed calmly, keeping her excitement contained. Danny’s smile dropped slightly, so Octavia turned back to the glass to avoid his sad puppy eyes. Then she jolted.
“You looking for a girl that'll treat you right. You looking for her in the daytime, with the light,” Pansy sang huskily, and shimmied her shoulders a little bit. Draco upped his confidence.
"What are you doing?"
"It's also supposed to have many ghosts to wander the castle, but the book always described them as adding character to the place rather than being scary. It's all quite medieval, and hasn't really changed since the original Hogwarts House leaders."
“WE’LL BE HOLDING ON FOREVER!”
“Too sexy for my- Too sexy for my- Too sexy for my- Too sexy for my.” The boy dressed as Michael Jackson spun round sensually and Draco didn’t think he could suffer from this much secondhand embarrassment. Blaise continued to sing the same couple of lines over until finally “and I’m too sexy for this song!”
“Um...Draco....”
"I'm pretty tired too, actually, so I think I'll be doing a Michael by going to sleep absurdly early." Anthony stretched his arms.
“Do you know that? Because you look pretty lovesick to me!” She batted her eyelashes mockingly. “Oh the other day Theo told me I looked handsome, Theo gave me homework help, Theo’s such a good kisser!” She made awful kissing sounds. Draco put his hands over his ears.
He listened closer to what sounded like someone coming towards them. He fished his wand out of his pajama pocket awkwardly and stood in front of Octavia.
This is also where the fun part of our story begins.
While looking into the mirror I brought the brush to my hair and dragged it down. Agh!
"Because he's my brother!" Draco sighed in frustration.
He edged around me to get out of the bathroom, a murmered "Good morning Potter," passing through his lips before he went over to his side of the room to get changed. I nodded back and made it into the bathroom, trying to ignore his uncovered chest the best I could.
And there on his forehead lay a lightning bolt scar.
“I am good today, how are you Viktor?”
He looked over to me boredly, having been shifting through a jean rack. He shrugged. "Looks okay, try it on in the booth." He jerked his thumb behind him to a curtain, which I guessed was the "booth".
“Uh...sure then. Okay. That’s fine. Fine and dandy. Perfectly adequate. That is so okay with me, I am cool with it, it’s fine...” he continued as he walked back into the bathroom.
"Are you alright Mother?" Draco began looking her over slightly. She nodded and handed him an ice cream.
Another piece of parchment propelled by flames flew from the goblet, landing in Dumbledore’s hand once again. He squinted as he read it out.
It was an incredibly large space, filled with the four long tables, each representing a house. All of these tables were filled with students, from second years to seventh. The ceiling resembled the night sky and it had candles floating above everyone for a light source. It reminded Octavia of the ball room back at the manor, but this had a cosier tone. A happier place than the large empty halls that Malfoy Manor was made up of.
“Orbis!” Draco yells, successfully casting a fantastic Ground Consuming jinx.
“How did you get that?” Draco asked exasperatedly. Blaise winked.
“What? No! How dare you doubt my transfiguration skills Blaise, you’re such a ponce! And after I work so hard and give so much of my time for you, and you have the audacity-“
“Tell me why!”
"Why didn't you stick up for me against Weasley on the train?" Harry's face blanched. "I-I mean, n-not that you n-needed t-to, it's f-f-fine, but I was j-just wondering, um-"
The wedding was in a month, and Rowan was forbidden to see Gale until after it was over. In this month however, Gale was working on a new spell. A spell that would save their love.
She’d been hanging off his arm as he’d hexed the Mudblood, cackling at how their face had been reshaped. The mudblood had fired the first shot, and told Pansy her face looked like a pig. He told her she had the weight of one too.
“Touché. Oh, and another thing.” He pulled out his wand.
“Facialis Pingere Exite.” He cast and Pansy’s make up was wiped clean. Draco preferred Pansy’s face without makeup. Had a softer look. But Pansy really enjoyed putting on makeup and using colour so Draco didn’t mention it. Whatever made Pansy happy made him happy. So he just smiled.
“I promise I won’t. Now gimme.” Draco reached for Potter’s glasses and plucked them off his face. He twirled them in his fingers for a moment before putting the cursed circular eyewear on his face.
“I’m just full of surprises.” Potter replied as he pulled out another book, the title surprisingly in English. Draco returned to his book with a smile on his face.

"Really? Best day ever!" Michael yelled excitedly. "I love Potions! My dad got me the Child's Potions Lab when I was younger, and I have a subscription to Draughts and Elixirs Weekly!"
“What about a favour for a favour?” Potter bartered uneasily. Octavia thought for a second.
"Eh it's better than being turned into a Ferret I suppose."
“Rough morning?” Blaise’s tired voice asked. Draco groaned in response.
Well please leave a Comment and a kudo, constructive criticisms and feedback are very very welcome and help me a lot, so please, take the to the comments. Ive also been composing a couple of one shots focused around Slytherins and Draco, they may act as side pieces, or are just in other universes. My first one, called Hungover, is in my works so check that out!
"I don't know why you're so shocked Potter. You're probably the richest man in Britian, most likely more than the royal family." Malfoy commented
So that was chapter two! Leave a kudo and a comment, I especially appreciate constructive criticisms and comments that let me know whether or not you like how the narrative is going, as they help me with the process. One really nice comment legit made me cry so thank you so much for the happy brain chemicals, you are a treasure.
Draco glanced at the floor for a second before nodding. “Yeah.”
I woke up fully clothed. Nice.
"Right you are Drakey-kins! My amazing, strong, handsome love of my life!" Blaise burst of laughing, followed by Vince, Greg and Octavia.
"Looking for these Potter?" Malfoy's voice rang out. I could see the blurry figure of who I assumed was him get up from his bed and walk over to me.
“Field training. She casts spells at me and I deflect, and then we move on to darker magic and occasional blood magic. We go through hypothetical scenarios that I’d need to escape. Wandless magic was something I picked up when she banned me from wand usage because my brain was getting lazy. Just the basics.” At least he assumed that was basic defence training. He didn’t really know what typical training was.
“Mm hmm.” Draco hummed supportively. He pat Blaise on the head, bringing a hand though his cornrows distractedly. “If you say so.”
"Ivanova!"
"I might as well have, I didn't want your father to hear about this, did I?" I carried on teasing lightly. He groaned and hid his face in his hands as he leant back onto his bed.
“So you’ll need a badge presser?”
“Rude!”
He opened up the cook book to the fairy cake page and got out a large mixing bowl and spoon. Unlike potions, with baking it was much more relaxed. The measurements weren't as severe. There was more freedom. Draco used to struggle with this, but after some time, he'd adapted to being able to estimate the ingredients rather than measuring them out. Within five minutes he was mixing all of the ingredients in a large bowl. His mother had been watching him. She did this every time, and never ceased to look on in awe, as i it were the first time she was watching him bake.
"So when did you learn you were magic? Did you experience many bouts of accidental magic as a child? Who told you that you were a wizard? Did you choose to go to Hogwarts or did they tell you to? Did you even get the option of going international with your magic schooling? How difficult did you find the conversion of muggle money into galleons? Am I the first wizard you've met? On a scale of one to ten, how exciting is the magical world compared to the muggle one?" That last question could have a biased answer, but Draco didn't care.
“Malfoy.” Potter cut him. Draco’s angry gaze rose to him.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Can Greg or Vince come with me?”
because there were
He was curled up on the sofa near Pansy, no surprise there, but who else he was asleep beside was a bit suspicious.
"A what?" Ah, very new then.
“For the last time Draco, stop trying to meddle! I’m getting somewhere by myself, I don’t need you to but in for everything! I’m fine!” Was the last thing she yelled at him before flouncing off to her dorm.
They were kissing. Draco was kissing Blaise. It should have felt really weird. But it didn’t. It was strange, sure, but it didn’t feel that way. It felt like mouth, Blaise’s mouth. His lips were soft. It felt kind of nice.
Lucius was the opposite, and had locked himself in his study since the Cup ended and had not come out. Octavia tried not to think about what he was doing, but she feared it took on some sketchy  undertones.
“Good work. Malfoy here resisted the Imperius Curse. He put up quite a fight.” Draco’s hands were shaking. The robotic eye was trapped on him again. “Fantastic work lass.”
“Granger?” He hissed. Viktor furrowed his brows.
“Okay, maybe not both completely, but Vince definitely has something for Greg...”
"I had History of Magic. The teacher is a ghost!" She looked bewildered. "He has quite a droning and monotone voice, it makes it quite difficult to want to listen."
After I'd dried my hair sufficiently enough, I picked up a blue hairbrush. How do I...? No, no, I knew how to do this. I'd watched enough people do it. You just kind of put the bristles through your hair? Yeah. And then it turns smooth.
“Riiight, I keep forgetting that you’re a heartless monster.” Blaise mimes stabbing his own heart.
“I can see things no one else can. If fate won’t do its work, it’s up to me.” Octavia raised an eyebrow at him.
“Get them then.” Potter scowled and squinted harder.
Greg said “The Baron is already here and c-c-cor-“
“Oh you are so inventive. To which torture method would that be used?” Draco faltered.
“Tell me why...”
“I gave up on that a long time ago.”
“Very awkward.”
"Holy Hell 'Arry, where's your bird's nest gone?! Are you wearin' a wig?" This caused Dean to laugh harder. I thumped my head on the table again.
"I suppose you wouldn't know. Long ago, the 4 settlers of Hogwarts decided that the students be divided by their characteristics, going into 4 houses named after each of them. Ravenclaw house, for the intelligent, witty and creative. Slytherin, for the cunning, ambitious and resourceful. Gryffindor, for the daring, brave and chivalrous. And lastly Hufflepuff, for the dedicated, patient and loyal. Many have also argued that Hufflepuff's are particularly good finders." He explained in summary. Harry smiled.
Narcissa finished quickly, finalising some of the cupcakes with icing butterfly wings which were charmed to flutter. She then set them all up meticulously on a butterfly plate, and carefully carried it outside. Draco fumbled off of his seat and rushed to get an umbrella out of an ugly gnome umbrella stand. She opened it up and held it up above an oblivious Narcissa as she opened the back door.
“Hi Malfoy.” Potter replied instead.
“Hey Hermione, can we borrow your button presser? Malfoy has a plan to help.” Potter asked her jollily. Her sharp eyes flickered from her book to them, landing soundly on Draco. He tried not to squirm under her judgmental gaze.
Draco sighed and cast the temporary spell on the test pillow anyway. The ugly pink pillow slowly morphed into an ugly pink cat with a squashed face. Draco smiled and pet it slightly as the cat blinked at him drowsily.
"Yep, you should of seen it. Like a child in a sweet shop. Gawking at everything. He particularly liked the castle, and kept wanting me to apparate us inside it, but it was out of bounds. He didn't really understand any of the references, because he hasn't seen any of the films, but liked the music playing everywhere."
“We have five minutes left.” Mentioned Greg, ever so helpful. Vince nodded along next to him, trying to brush his hair down.
"Yeah, people like Voldemort," Ron spat out. Both Hermione and Malfoy gave him a glare, Malfoy with a bit more venom. He turned back to Hermione.
He sat down inside his clear yellow shield, crossing his legs and watching as the boy reverses the tongue tie curse, doing so, but turning the tongue blue in the process. Draco smirked. His own personal branch of tongue tied. The victim could speak when reversed, but couldn’t cast anything. That took another reversal spell. And even after that, the victim’s tongue stayed blue until Draco personally reversed it. He found it funny, and hadn’t had a proper chance to try it yet (on someone other than Kreacher).
“Who are you then, Draco Lestrange? Draco Black?” Draco pondered his earlier conversation with Kreacher. He definitely didn’t want to be a Malfoy, they were traitors. And as Kreacher said, he wasn’t really fit to be a Lestrange. And he certainly didn’t want to sound like he was related to the absolute Boggart that was Sirius Black.
Lol it’s like 12.15AM and I’m sad so I wrote this as an add on for my Double Trouble latest chapter so b shure to read that before this if you want total context
Transfiguration was okay, more enjoyable than the last two had been. McGonagall established the year curriculum for them and they were then tasked with transfiguring multiple materials, such as felt, plastic, wood and metal. The metal was directed to be transfigured into water, which was very difficult for all. No one in the class managed it, though Draco and Blaise managed to transfigure the metal into liquid metal.
quick update for my other fic!
“Yeah, Draco didn’t do anything!” Octavia yells at Mad Eye. The boy in question, now a
Viktor smiled. “I vill see you later Drako.” He bid goodbye. Draco waved before walking fast out of the library, his thoughts wild and bitter.
...until a large Durmstrang boy Octavia hadn’t caught the name of fell into Draco’s arms and let out a defeated sob.
“No you’re the nerd.”
“That’s not a girlfriend/boyfriend nickname, thats a childhood one.” Draco points out and Pansy pouts.
i am writing the next chapter, it's just going slow because i got hyper obsessed with three different fandoms that weren't HP at once and also my life went caput so yikes, my bad.
"Don't call me that!"
Draco shook his head. "I'll be fine, it's just a quick thing." He also decided to ignore Blaise's bouncing eyebrows because he was a better person than Blaise.
"Hm." Draco smiled back shyly, his heart rate calming down a bit.
“Oh shit! Vince is right, we do! We missed breakfast!” Draco yelled. The entire dorm groaned in disappointment. “AND WE HAVE CLASS IN TEN MINUTES!” The entire dorm jumped out of their beds in a panic, some falling on the floor, and immediately began getting ready.
In short, the shirt was a mess.
“Get the fuck up.” Theo’s voice orders. “Get off your fucking knees.” More rustling.
Terry seemed to like his straightforward answer, because his leg tapping had stopped and he looked happier.
"Idiot." But she didn't want him to enter the tournament.
“Sure I am.”
“I don’t know...”
Your top hats sleek and tall,
“Draco, why do you feel the need to lie to us? What’s so scandalous you need to hide it?”  Octavia teased him. Draco scowled and his cheeks began to turn red.
And giggle.
"Um, I guess I'll see you the next lesson we have together?"
BANG!
Draco huffed again. “Obviously, I just said we saw the Golden Trio.”
“W-what?”
“You should probably go back to dorms to sleep this off.” Blaise told him, and Draco was once again reminded that Blaise talked too much. But he listened to him anyway. It was only polite.
“Here you go, now go treat Greg and Vince nice. They deserve it. Hi boys!” She waved behind him to the aforementioned two, as they probably waved back joyfully.
“I wish you weren’t my brother!”
“I don’t really want to kiss you, Pansy.” Draco told her. “But I will be your boyfriend and do everything else. Holding hands and playing together is fun!”
“Heh, thanks. I guess I’m better at talking than I am at reading.” He sighed at his essay.
"Pureblood education is being able to known not only your own family history, but every important family's history by the age of 7." He recited with an eyeroll. "Now even though you're very very rich, you are also very very oblivious, so therefore since you don't have any of your riches with you, I am paying for your clothing. In fact..." He grabbed the pile of clothing and began to carry it towards the counter.
For his name, in Greek mythology he was the dragon that Heracles defeated in one of his 12 labors. But Draco preferred the Greco-Roman legend, and how Draco was a dragon killed by the goddess Minerva and tossed into the sky upon his defeat. The dragon was one of the Gigantes, who battled the Olympic gods for ten years. As Minerva threw the dragon, it became twisted on itself and froze at the cold North Celestial Pole before it could right itself. It may never end well for the dragon, but at least that story includes more action.
“You have got to read a book on Magical Beasts.” Octavia recommended but Danny shook his head.
"Don't worry. He's a toad, he could only go so far." Draco thought for a moment. "Have you tried summoning him?"
She sat in a chair will her head in her hands for a minute, as Draco silently continued to read. She then jumped off the chair delightedly and clapped her hands.
I opened the en suite door to walk out and see Pansy Parkinson dying of laughter on my bed.
And his signature glasses that will most likely be on Potter merchandise until the day Draco dies. Oh don’t get him started on those poor things!
“His hair? WACK! His spells? WACK! His prefect status? WACK! His shoes? WACK! The way that he talks? WACK!. The way that he’s all gross with his girlfriend in public? WACK! Me? I’m tight as fuck.” Blaise announces, emphasising each ‘WACK’ with a clap. Draco was glad he’d put actually good muffling charms around his bed. Blaise would have inevitably woken up the whole dorm otherwise.
?" Draco bobbed his eyebrows. Octavia swatted at him.
They were all becoming rather popular, which was an odd experience by far for Octavia. Martha seemed to be used to it, which made sense since she was so likeable, but Danny tended to shy away from any eyes. Which was rather difficult when his map making gained a rather occult following of students, even some second years.
The air felt painful, like it’d had gone through whiplash. Octavia stood over the armchair awkwardly.
What good that did.
“-so it turns out muggle products are far better for your skin, so I took a load with me! Would you like to do some makeovers?” Martha asked Octavia. Octavia was about to agree until she spotted Draco in a chair in the common room.
“It was okay. I don’t really remember much of it though. I was drunk.” He excused and Blaise’s face fell.
"Well that much is obvious enough." Lucius took his head in one hand and sighed before sitting down on a chair.
After getting undressed I looked through the newly bought bottles for Cheryl Sheelar's Sherbert Scented Shampoo and A & M's Caring Conditioner. I'd never really bothered with many products other than a bit of soap. The Dursley's never let me use more than a bar of cheap soap and two minutes of cold water, so it was all new territory.
“You feeling a bit better now?” Vince asked him. Draco made himself nod.
"But I want to see the Bulgarian tents! Pleeeeaaaa-"
"Yes you r-run through and- "
He shrugged again. “It is just a word.”
“Hi Octi.” He waved tensely, and went to the other side of Greg. Octavia felt like she was seeing double.
Draco was bored. “Oh. All that transfiguration so you could dress as a muggle. Good to know my work was put to good use.” He walked into the now free bathroom to change.
“I’m sorry I thought that was how you do it!”
“Far better than you it seems. You look like someone stole your sugar quills.” She commented,and Draco’s face immediately hardened.
And another moment.
“Never call me that again. And why would I want to support you try to get in an older students pants? It’s disgusting!”
Pansy rolled her eyes. “I will be if you stop being such a snack thief!” She batted his hand away again. Blaise pouted.
"As amusing as it is to see you wearing Slytherin colours, Potter, that's the wrong shade of green."
“Cheers to that!” Potter crowed. “To getting sloshed!” Draco tapped his cup against Potter’s before they both downed it.
“Well that’s another day’s problem, I could definitely do with some dinner. KREACHER!” She shrieked and the elf popped up next to them.
“We’re both on your lap.” Draco told him awkwardly.
“ ‘What did you do?’ WHAT DID YOU DO?! You picked me up bridal style in front of everyone in the entrance hall, and as soon as I was sick of it, you dropped me in Potter’s, “he covered Octavia’s ears, “*£$%@!@£”, he uncovered her ears, “arms!”
“No, not there.” She turned her head round the corner again. Blaise was grinning nervously up at Theo while grabbing the other boy’s hand. “Not yet.”
"Ah, Mister Malfoy! A ten inch Hawthorn with a unicorn hair core, correct?"
“That’ll be the hangover. First one?” Draco asked jollily, as if he didn’t experience his first proper hangover earlier that morning.
. "Ron - Hermione -Harry - are you alright? Mister Malfoy?" He questioned, which Draco presumed was being aimed at him. He would have faced Mr Weasley, but he was in the unfortunate predicament of not being able to move.
It was the favourite part of his day, playing with her hair. It gave him something to do with his hands. He was always needing to keep them busy one way or another, something to focus on and to quench his need to focus onto something. He was always plaiting anything he could find, from Great Aunt Walburga's antique scarves to his favourite sweet, Strawberry Parchment Rolls. He liked plaiting Narcissa's hair because he think it made her look younger, more carefree, and after he undid the plaits it would give her golden curls.
"Well that's pretty dumb. Everyone knows that Ravenclaw is the best!" Michael says proudly. Draco cracked a smile and hugged his knees. Terry stayed silent throughout this exchange, taking it in. When the boys all turned to him at once he bristled and tapped one of his legs.
The ways in which Beauxbatons and Durmstrang got to Hogwarts was truly dramatic, and made Octavia roll her eyes a good couple of times at how easily impressed Danny was.
When she left, the house was painfully quiet. Even quieter than it usually was. Draco sighed and returned to his studies, transferring his attention back to transfiguration, and practising his wandless magic and his magical core with some meditation.
“Of course I do. You want to ask Draco for help?” He snickers.
Potter had the distinct look on his face of one who didn’t often get ideas, getting an idea. Draco scowled and began to think of all the hexes he could perform without doing permanent damage to Potters face.
"Um, my name's Draco."
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?” Both Potter an him said in unison and confusion, and a bit of panic on Draco’s part.
He felt his insides shifting.
“Ugh, shit!” He yelled in pain. He pushed upwards on the filthy ground to get back onto his feet. It was then that he heard a yell.
The excited buzz had only heightened, as now the only thing left to do was to pull the names from the goblet. The champions would soon be chosen! Octavia couldn’t really care less. No one she knew could or would be chosen, so she didn’t have anything to worry or look forward to. Much of Slytherin disagreed. According to what was being passed around the table, Many Slytherins had put their name in the goblet very early in the morning, before the other houses or schools had woken up, to keep everything on the down low in case they weren’t picked.
“Of course.” He agreed and bid her goodbye.
At my confused gaze, he explained "These are for Pansy!"
This realisation made Draco’s stomach squirms return.
Blaise tutted. “Such a prude. Now it’s time to sort your costume. Ladies?” He addressed them, “I believe you’ll take him from here? I need to change into something fantastic!” He swaggered into the en suite bathroom, carrying some red items.
Pluto dropped the red envelope infront of Draco. Draco stared at it in horror. The owl landed harshly on the boy's shoulder and gently nibbled at his ear, as if knowing the danger the boy was in. After stealing a piece of toast off of his plate, the large owl flew off. Draco was still staring horrified at the red envelope.
Granger started talking about how they were from Beauxbatons and... Draco had already lost interest.
