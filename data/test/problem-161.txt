Especially because Harry’s quiet nature did not abate as he grew. In fact, by the time Harry was five, he had spoken a grand total of eighteen words in his life, twelve of which had been variations of ‘mum’ and ‘dad’. The other six had been compiled into a single sentence on the night of his parents’ death, unheard to anyone but the corpse of his mother on the floor who, unfortunately for Harry, had very little to say in response. Those six words would not leave Harry’s lips again for over a decade, and until that day, they would remain a secret to all but Harry himself.
“I’m fine. And Draco is alright, too,” Harry replied pointedly.
The Slytherins turned around. Ronald Weasley had marched forward behind them and apparently decided to intervene. He glared at Draco and stuck out a hand, palm facing up.
Harry changed directions to head for the Ravenclaw table, and frowned at what he saw. Hermione Granger was sitting on the far edge of the long benches, back to the wall and as close to the Head Table as she could get. Surrounding her was a conspicuous emptiness about three people wide. Harry filed the image away to investigate later as he approached the table.
“I haven’t heard that name, sorry,” he told Myrtle absently, picking up the book. “Tell me about her some other time, okay?”
“Wouldyouliketodothisagainsometime?” Hermione rushed.
Their detention wasn’t that bad – but it wasn’t a walk in the park, either. Rather, a walk in the forest. The Forbidden, Dark Forest. Within which, Draco informed Harry in a terrified whisper, lay all sorts of creatures – werewolves, vampires, ghouls, and the like.
“CLOSE YOUR EYES!”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Obviously he meant no stupid fighting in the corridors; pranks; that sort of thing.”
“Hadrian James Potter,” Draco snapped anxiously, “I am not dying in a stupid forest from some stupid spiders, I bloody well am NOT.”
Draco nodded, though it was slightly shaky. “You’re right, of course. Everything will be fine.” He smiled, the tiny tender thing that had grown more familiar to Harry the longer the spectre of Lucius Malfoy was gone from the Manor. “I’m glad you’re here, Harry.”
Tracey put her hands on her hips and glared. “Myrtle is always crying. She’s a ghost. We can’t exactly help her stop being dead.”
Harry turned to him, eyes wide with anxiety. “But- why is he mad at me? What did I do?”
Pansy laughed. “You mean she’s not afraid of
“Ah, but where’s our compensation?” moaned George.
Harry kept his face blank. “I’m shaking hands with Dumbledore. I’ve won the House Cup.”
century in return. Pansy and Theodore he sent their respective favourite sweets to, and they returned the gesture. Millicent bought him a book on the deadliest (but still legal) curses of the modern age, in return for his gift of
Harry was very suspicious by now, and opened his mouth to tell Hagrid that he couldn’t possibly promise to keep a secret when he didn’t know what that secret was, but Neville and Hermione were nodding on either side of him and Hagrid was ushering them inside and Harry only had a few seconds to think that he’d never promised a thing before-
Dumbledore seemed pleased he’d asked. “Fawkes is a magnificent creature, Harry. As you have discovered, one of the many talents of phoenixes is that their tears may heal any ailment; another, is their sense of intuition. Quite possibly, Fawkes was simply drawn to the cry of your magic from within the Chamber – and, remembering you as a student of mine from that day in my office, flew to your aid.”
Draco leaned closer against, brow furrowed as he ran a hand along Harry’s back in comfort. “Well – we could go see the groundskeeper.”
Harry gulped, and turned to Madam Pomfrey.
“You didn’t tell me you played, Potter.”
. He was a freak – that was all he knew. It was all he had been told since being dropped on the doorstep of Number 4.
“No, Neville, that’s it, you’re amazing!” Harry grinned at him. “That makes perfect sense!”
He spared half a desperate prayer that the beast wouldn’t kill the twins on its way to him, before focussing wholly on not slipping on the damp stones beneath his racing feet.
But he wasn’t, and so he didn’t.
“Uhh…” Lockhart responded eloquently, evidently also having trouble changing tracks from ranting about the Weasley twins to facing a group of incredulous twelve year olds. He flashed a poor attempt at his usual gigawatt grin. “Yes, well, urgent call you see. Really can’t miss it.”
“Ready to leave, dear?”
“No!” Draco and Blaise said quickly.
Harry glanced from Daphne to Blaise and back again, before saying, “I was quite tired, actually. I thought I’d head to bed early.”
The boy wasn’t wrong, but Harry appreciated Gemma’s defence. Theo didn’t have that many friends outside of the second year group in Slytherin, quiet as he was, but even if he wasn’t Harry’s friend he was still a snake. He was one of theirs, and they should respect what had happened to him.
“My gran says he’s amazing though,” Neville said. “She says he’s the most powerful wizard since Merlin.”
“It’s a wizarding children’s story, but it’s also a legend. You two should read it sometime, it’s quite interesting.”
“You,” he said calmly, gesturing for Lockhart to stand, “Are coming with us.”
Hermione gasped. “Of course!” She turned to Harry excitedly. “It was in the book you gave me for Christmas! The Philosopher’s Stone can be used to give the owner immortality – that must be what You-Know-Who is after!”
“Help h-how, exactly?” asked Neville.
“Hello.”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Okay. I agree to your terms.”
Harry pieced together what he had learned so far as they walked. Tom Riddle was showing him a memory from his past, from the last time the Chamber of Secrets had been opened, and in that time, someone had died. A student, probably, though a teacher was possible. That was awful, of course, and a terrifying wake-up call for the danger of Harry’s own situation (as so far, students were being Petrified, not killed) but information wise, it didn’t help him. He still didn’t know who had opened the Chamber of Secrets, or what exactly the ‘monster’ within the Chamber was, or
“Of course.”
Harry thought distantly.
“For a price, Longbottom,” Harry said. He tried very hard not to roll his eyes at the obvious confusion on the other boy’s face. He was working on his mask, after all.
Harry stared, uncomprehending.
Harry has his first Potions lesson - and his first detention.
“Oh, thank Salazar!” Pansy cried dramatically. “You lot have been insufferable! Congratulations by the way Harry, you’re a great flyer.”
Deep breaths. Tracey would be proud.
It is 12:51am. I need to get up at 6:00am. Please send help.
“Longbottom, is there another way out of this?” Blaise called. His voice was strained, and he too had his eyes scrunched shut.
child.
“I think it’s a plant. Um, one of you will need to come down with your wand out though. I’m, uh, sitting on mine. But with light I’ll know what it is!”
“Oi,” Harry interrupted. The girls looked at him, both irritated. He ignored their expressions in favour of pointing ahead. “What’s that?”
you saved us from?”
Harry looked down. Astoria Greengrass looked up at him. She didn’t even reach his shoulders.
“Hey kid,” John called from the hall. “You’ve got mail.”
Harry wondered at the implications behind that farewell. He was sure Blaise was hiding another meaning beneath his words, but he couldn’t quite decode the message.
Harry glanced at his friends. “I’ll need all of you to agree to this. If you don’t want to come that’s okay, nothing will be held against you-”
He didn’t have enough time to panic at the small area and the feeling of rising movement beneath his feet before the gargoyle spread its wings once again, revealing a large, circular room.
So. Mental health hit in a bad way. I needed to give myself time to recover and I realise it's been a while, so. Sorry.
table in front of them. In Hagrid’s very
Harry set his jaw resolutely. “We’re going to stop Voldemort.”
“But Mother-”
“Theo and I are staying too, actually,” said Tracey.
“How mysterious,” said the curtain to Harry’s left.
Harry didn’t bother pointing out that Draco had admonished him for having that attitude last night. He didn’t need Draco mad at him in the middle of their investigation. He did, however, share a
“Okay…” Hermione said slowly.
“Draco,” Harry tried to meet his eyes, but he had them clenched shut. “Draco, you need to calm down.”
Something clenched in Harry’s chest. “What?”
Harry glanced at his friends.
He was in the Slytherin Common Room, staring at the forest-green ceiling with his chair sprawled next to him and a sharp ache in the back of his head.
Harry’s eyes prickled, and for once he didn’t want to hold the tears back. He felt young, and scared, and safe with his friends.
With a flash of blinding light, the Slytherin Common Room was empty – all that remained was spilled ink, and a small black diary.
“I’m going to have to turn you in, Hagrid,” Riddle was saying when Harry returned his stunned eyes to the scene playing out before him. “I don’t think you meant to kill anyone-”
“Come in.”
It's 2am and this is unedited. I hope everyone is staying safe during this time <3
“Oh, get off,” Millicent pushed her away, face going a deep, odd purple.
Blaise didn’t seem convinced, but Draco was already barrelling ahead with the conversation.
He moved quickly, following the murderous whispers around the castle, fingers to stone and an urgency building in his chest, moving faster and faster until-
“Baby snakes,” the other twin addressed the other Slytherins.
They made their way down a narrow, darkened corridor to the boys’ dorms. As they were only a small year, all the first year boys would be in the same dorm, and the first year girls were the same. Since Harry and Draco were the first up to the dorm, they were able to have first pick of the beds. Draco immediately claimed the bed at the end of the room, farthest from the door, and Harry picked the one beside it. There was a small porthole-like window above his dresser, looking out into the darkness of the Lake. Harry touched a hand to the cool glass, and smiled slightly to himself.
“Well,” Hermione huffed. “They practically made this room for you, Harry.”
“A student has been Petrified,” Dumbledore announced sadly to the school at breakfast. “Colin Creevey is in the Hospital Wing, and will be cured as soon as Professor Sprout’s mandrakes have matured. Thank you.”
Harry bit his lip. “Call me Harry.”
at the Dursleys’, but he
“Simple?” Blaise raised an eyebrow. “That’s a third year spell.”
“Which is a giant spider. Not helpful, Theo.”
Daphne looked scandalised at the thought, while Hermione just looked disgusted – whether with herself or with Daphne, Harry didn’t know, but he, Millicent, Pansy, and Tracey all burst out laughing at once.
“Miss Farley, Mr Malfoy, Mr Zabini,” Snape paused, a slight sneer taking over his features. “Mr Potter. I believe I explained the consequence for any Gryffindor foolishness.”
Harry gave her the same slow blink. “Reading.”
we all love a good intrigue,” Pansy told them.
“You really wanted to fly, right?” Draco asked, excitedly.
“Sh!” Madam Pince hissed. She was ignored.
“Erm… no.”
Edit: 7/2/17. Just realised I'd listed Draco as Seeker *facepalm*
The shame was in Harry’s chest, now, rising to tighten around his throat and press heatedly behind his eyes. They prickled wetly, and Harry bowed his head more.
“Oh for Merlin’s sake,” muttered a very familiar voice, and Daphne stepped out from behind the bookshelf with a flick of her hair. She was followed by a sheepish Tracey, a grinning Pansy, a bemused Millicent, and a nonchalant Theo.
Hagrid flushed further. Harry fumed - Draco’s father or not, Harry wanted to jinx the hell out of him.
Harry thought, recalling his desperate escape the previous summer. The sight of the bars outside his window, twisted and warped from where the force of Harry’s magic had crashed into them from within, was still lodged in the back of his mind. The idea that he had done that – that he was capable of such impact – was both thrilling and a little terrifying. His embarrassing explosion in his first year dredged up similar feelings, particularly in that the latter ended with him in the hospital wing. Two years at Hogwarts and Harry was quite sick of the amount of time he had already spent under Madam Pomfrey’s care.
Harry gave her a wave as they turned in their separate directions, and began to make his way further into the dungeons.
“So who do you think is going to win, Harry? I’d put my money on both losing, if it were an option. Puffs vs Gryffindorks? It’s the start of a bad joke,” he snorted, before quickly glancing at Neville. “Ahem, no offence of course Longbottom.”
“But have you seen it?”
Draco refused to speak to him throughout the entire day, despite Harry’s best efforts to approach the other boy. In every class, Draco would sit at the front with a silently recruited Theo, while Harry stared helplessly from his seat beside Blaise.
A quick scan of his surroundings answered that question, for Harry had not moved far – just outside of Number 4, Privet Drive, in fact, and so when he glanced up he could very clearly see the iron bars on his own window. Except now, the bars didn’t look so solid. They were twisted and warped, bulging outwards as though some great force had slammed into them from within.
Harry imagined strangling him, and returned the smile. “No, Professor.”
“Always looking for a new target, aren’t we Georgie?” said Fred.
Dumbledore didn’t seem convinced – though really, neither was Harry – but he seemed to let it go.
Harry sighed, and pushed the memory away. He dragged the single threadbare blanket the Dursleys had given him further over his chest. Outside the world would be warming up, summer in Surrey humid and bright, but inside was still cool from the night time chill. Harry missed the Manor and all its inhabitants like a lost limb.
made quite the impression upon their meeting the year before. Even without the deep respect Harry held for the Lady Malfoy, he had no intention of ever crossing her and considered anyone who dared do so to be incredibly stupid. Petunia, if she had any sense at all (which Harry thought she must, given her and Uncle Vernon’s change in attitude since Narcissa’s visit) would have realised that.
been a dream. All the rest of his school supplies had been stuffed into Harry’s old cupboard and locked away.
Harry let out a breathy, hysterical laugh. He could talk to him. He could find out about the Chamber!
Harry took a deep breath himself before grabbing a small fistful of floo powder. He was looking forward to the travel about as much as he was looking forward to the trial itself – despite Narcissa and Draco’s best efforts, Harry was unsuccessful in making the landing from floo transport as seamless and graceful as the Malfoys made it appear. On one memorable occasion, while practicing flooing from the Manor to the Malfoy summer chateau in France, he had stumbled out of the fireplace and fallen flat on his face. Narcissa had had to use
“Why don’t you introduce him to the other firsties, Malfoy?” Gemma was saying. “I’m sure you’ve been introduced to a fair few of them. See you around, Potter.”
Harry frowned. “It looked like a really big spider.”
“Sure, sure,” John replied dismissively. “We serve breakfast in ten, kiddo.”
(Perhaps, it was just a little bit to hear the indignant sound Ron Weasley made behind him – but only a little bit.)
Paper.
, Harry thought.
The Weasley twins grinned down at the group and leaned dramatically against each other with their hands against their foreheads in a mock swoon.
“No it bloody well is not!”
“Plus, we really want to know,” Pansy whined, sitting on the edge of his bed to lean against Millicent.
“As our Mandrakes are only seedlings,” Professor Sprout continued, “Their cries won’t kill you yet. However, they
He struggled to hold in his laughter at Longbottom’s reaction. The other boy’s jaw dropped even further, and he began to splutter slightly, even taking a step back. It was everything he’d hoped for – after all, he might be turning over a new leaf where Longbottom was concerned, but he could still have a little
Though little could be said for the taste of Pepper-Up potion, Harry could write a thousand essays praising its effectiveness. He arrived at breakfast later that morning feeling worlds better, though the tenseness in his chest anticipating his detention – and the double Potions period he had before it – with Professor Snape had not dissipated. Thinking of the detention reminded Harry, irritatingly, of the plans he would have to cancel.
Probably-Fred patted him on the back for that comment. “Atta boy, Ronniekins.”
“Freak!” the boy called, before turning and running away.
“Unless they wanted someone to find it,” Harry mused.
The Gryffindor’s mouth dropped open in shock. “I- I mean, you’re welcome, you were, you were really brave too. And- and loyal, to Hermione.” He swallowed. “I mean, the other Gryffindors don’t say many nice things about you – especially Ron, but – they’re wrong.”
That was a Hufflepuff – Macmillan, Harry thought. He paused, slipping closer to the door.
Harry was the last one in the Common Room that night. He should have been in bed hours ago (if Hermione knew he was still awake she’d give him the lecture of a lifetime) but for some reason he just couldn’t shake the feeling that the Tom Riddle’s diary was important. He turned the pages one by one. No matter how much he stared at them, however, they remained blank.
“Did you have any questions for me?” Dumbledore continued genially. “Before I return your friends to you? Misters Malfoy and Zabini in particular have been quite eager to visit as I understand it, but Madam Pomfrey knows best about when it’s time to allow visitors.” He smiled patiently.
Ron breathed in, quick and terrified as he cast his own
“I’m Colin Creevey! Can I call you Harry? I’m in Gryffindor, but I’m going to talk to Professor Dumbledore and see if I can come to Slytherin, wouldn’t that be fantastic?” Colin beamed.
The two bowed in synch. “Lead the way, Heir of Slytherin.”
“I don’t know if you should refuse,” Tracey shivered. “He’s massive. What if he got angry?”
. Harry was exhausted by the end of his first round, but pleased – he had just barely beaten Higgs to the snitch, meaning he would sit out the next trial match, and play the winning Seeker in the finals. The winning Seeker turned out to be a sixth year Harry wasn’t familiar with, by the name of Wynona Ecklehurt. She was lean and fierce looking, nearly twice Harry’s height. On a positive note though, Draco informed him (still riding cloud nine at having been given the Chaser position after the first match), Flint and Ecklehurt had dated the previous year. Ecklehurt had broken up with Flint, rather publicly, and broken his nose while she was at it (though no one seemed certain why). The point being, Draco continued, it was impossible that Flint was harbouring positive feelings towards Ecklehurt after that stint.
In case you were wondering, yes, the twins' speech DOES make me want to die. And yes, I skipped Diagon Alley. We've all read that, haven't we?
Harry glanced over to see Neville still looking shocked.
Harry opened the letter carefully, and he felt his heart stop as he read the contents:
Their presence was an olive branch that Harry would not accept – until Hermione got her apology, he refused to be friends with them.
Telling himself that didn’t change the way they looked. He felt so helpless. Two of his closest friends lay frozen and he had done nothing to help them. To stop them getting this way.
counted as breaking the rules. But – he
“Is she dead?”
“Nothing like Percy, but just as annoying, eh Fred?”
“So we came to help,” Adrian continued, “But it seems you’ve taken care of it for us.”
He didn’t have time to think any longer as he squinted into the dark because Draco was tugging him down, ducking his head with a hand on his neck and pulling both them and Fang to the ground as the unmistakeable sound of hooves on forest floor surrounded them, deafening, even frightening if it wasn’t accompanied by the sickening squish of spiders being crushed and the screech of those who weren’t scurrying away through the underbrush. The bombardment seemed to go on forever, endless stamping and rushes of air past his face as Harry squeezed his eyes shut against the frighteningly close sensations and booming sounds. Fang’s slobber wet his clothes and the ground stunk of moss, but Draco’s hand was warm on his neck and it was that that kept him breathing. When the movement did finally end, the sudden silence was more piercing than the noise, and it took a long time until Harry could gather the strength to lift his head and view their saviour.
readable you wouldn’t want to read it anyway.”
Harry shook his head. “But…”
Harry gets a glimpse into the past, and he and Draco have an argument.
, and so with this logic Harry had learned to equate normal days with good days, and good days in turn were equated with minimal pain for Harry.
“No.”
Dumbledore nodded at him, and watched as Hagrid made his way back out the door he came through.
“Harry,” Tracey explained, resting one gentle hand on his arm. “That diary could have done anything. There are plenty of cursed objects in the world – you need to be more careful.”
, of the wraith getting closer and closer and closer, but everything seemed vague and unimportant behind the agony in his scar.
“How did you get into Slytherin?” Draco asked, incredulously, when Harry was finished catching his friends up on the events inside the book at breakfast the next morning, at an emergency meeting at the library.
“I’ll talk to her,” said Theo.
“Hadrian,” Gemma Farley met his eyes over Draco’s shoulder, “What in Merlin’s name were you thinking?”
Tracey shook her head. “You’d be surprised. A ghost like Myrtle? She won’t be letting that go anytime soon.”
“What does it say, Harry?” Neville asked. Everyone was silent.
Harry’s friends visited him in the Hospital Wing just minutes after the Headmaster had left.
She turned to Daphne on her left, and Harry read her lips very clearly as she complained, “It’s
“Fantastic,” said Draco. “That is truly wonderful news.”
“I could ask the same of you, Parkinson,” Weasley replied, though the scorn in his voice was notably weaker than usual.
“Let’s go,” he said.
Harry’s brain supplied, wild and panicked.
“…I still don’t understand.”
a thing for walking in to danger, don’t you, it’s ridiculous!”
“I haven’t gotten any messages.”
September 1
Draco looked at him, sceptical. “’Okay’?”
Harry almost winced. Dumbledore certainly wasn’t pulling any punches.
“Why me?” Someone was draining all the oxygen out of the room, surely? Tom Riddle’s stare seemed to pin Harry in place, fear and shock gluing his feet and his attention.
Harry moved towards it, slipping his wand into his hand.
“Miss Weasley and the Misters Weasley who accompanied you in the Chamber are both well on the mend, as you’ve already seen, and the rest of your little cohort are quite safe; including Miss Granger and Mr Nott, who were un-petrified by Professor Sprout’s mandrakes some days ago.”
“They’ll catch up,” Harry nodded. “Let’s go.”
There was a pause. “Do you like it here?”
Pain blossomed up from his elbow as the Bludger hit him with a
“He’d be willing-”
“I know who you are,” Justin chuckled. “We all do. Even us Muggleborns.” He turned back to the stage, and Harry saw a fellow Hufflepuff tug him away from the Slytherins with narrowed eyes.
Millicent looked up with hard eyes. “I’m not a blood traitor. I’m just saying Hadrian has a point about the idiots. Granger may be a know-it-all, but we’re only three days into the year and she’s already pulling ahead as top of the class. That’s not the mark of someone who’s less powerful than the rest of us.”
He voiced the question aloud on accident, the mess in his head dissolving the control he once had on his mouth. The sludgy shame in his gut thickened.
“Just because I like Quidditch doesn’t mean I have any interest in getting on a damn broom in front of the whole school,” she said. “I’m fine just watching, thanks.”
“Why are we going to a Gryffindor-Hufflepuff match again?” Daphne complained. “There aren’t even any cute boys in Hufflepuff.”
“They will,” assured Tracey, though her bitten down nails betrayed her concern.
I’ve heard that name before, I just
Harry wanted to reply – at least to get that look out of Draco’s eyes, or to clear the heat from his own cheeks that must have been the result of the room getting too warm with so many inhabitants - but Daphne was already demanding the full story, so it would have to wait.
Hermione frowned at her. “She’s a first year.”
“Ooh, I’m really scared,” Draco snickered. Pansy laughed out loud.
“Mr Potter,” he sneered. “Our new celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”
Theo said quietly, “Pansy.”
Millicent rubbed her eyes. “Shit.”
The Weasleys were odd, but he was fairly sure they didn’t have feathers.
“Why?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mr Longbottom?” Professor Sprout raised her eyebrows. “A little louder, please.”
It HAS been a year, whoops, so I'm not sure how good this chapter is. But I'm feeling a hell of a lot better than I have in ages, so I'm just happy the passion to write is back. Hope you guys like it!
“Good.” Harry stepped back, slipping his wand away and returning to the spot next to his broom.
, the ceiling collapsed. Harry jumped to one side and had only a second to see Blaise grabbing Draco and Pansy to jump the opposite way before huge chunks of rock dropped between them, sending a mini earthquake through the ground with the aftershocks.
Harry examined him with a cautious eye. He had a lot of questions – what Theo had said to get Hermione looking relaxed after her tearfulness earlier, how Theo had known what to say, why he had even cared – but none of that, if Harry was honest, was really his business.
Lockhart attempted his gigawatt smile, though it fell short somewhere in the realm of sickly. “Very well then,” he said, trying to regain his suavity. “I’ll – I’ll just be in my office, er, getting- getting ready.” He fled the scene.
Harry looked up. Gemma’s dark eyes were carefully avoiding the mirror, and her brow was furrowed in concern.
Thunder, out of nowhere, except it sounded a lot closer than any thunder Harry had ever heard before and wait a second was that a herd of
“I’ll help you find some, Harry,” said Tracey quietly. “I think I know some places to start.”
Despite Draco’s confident words, Harry could feel the other boy shaking. Across from them, Adrian Pucey nodded in acknowledgement. It may have been meant in comfort – knowing Adrian, Harry thought it unlikely, but it would have been nice.
“Oh, do use your common sense!” Lockhart huffed, dropping a protesting portrait of himself into one trunk. “My books wouldn’t have sold half as well if people didn’t think I’d done all those things. No one wants to read about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save a village from werewolves. He’d look dreadful on the front cover – no dress sense at all, really.”
Hanging from a light fixture beneath the threatening message was indeed Filch’s cat, stiff, her yellow eyes wide.
“Did you hear that?” Harry barely noticed Blaise and Draco steadying him, so focused was he on the need to find whatever was whispering that was tightening his chest.
Harry stared at his cousin in shock, but had little time to process before the snake was slinking out of the enclosure and bowing its head in Harry’s direction.
Harry had stopped paying attention the moment he started talking about the sweets. He was too busy thinking about what Dumbledore had said. Love had saved him? Harry loved his mother, or at least the memory of her, and from the way he remembered her he knew she had loved him too, but love wasn’t magic. Love was strong, he was sure, but it couldn’t physically save a life the way Harry had been saved from the Killing Curse. That just didn’t make logical sense.
Harry did the only thing he could think of to do: he wrote to Draco (as Blaise, Neville, and Hermione were all away for the holiday, and he wasn’t as close with his other friends) and asked if he could meet at the Leaky Cauldron sometime soon. Then, after sending the letter off with one of the delivery owls (Hedwig was exhausted, and already settling for sleep on his windowsill), he headed off for Gringotts.
“Everyone with me,” Flint snapped, waiting with a glare for the resting players to join Harry and the others. Once they were all together, Flint wasted no time. “New line-up is this: Chasers are myself, Pucey, and Malfoy. Keeper is Bletchley. Beaters are Derrick and Bole. Seeker…” he paused to look at Harry with disgust. “Seeker is Potter.”
“I don’t know, Draco,” Blaise smirked. “Seems like Harry’s got a new knight in shining armour.”
“Feet on the sofa, Farley? Really?”
Harry leaves the Dursleys', and meets Narcissa.
“Whatever you say, Millie dear.”
“What is it?” Harry asked, squinting at the ball.
“Yeah?”
Neville piped up, “So, are they used for anything? In particular, I mean? Like- guarding, maybe?”
“But if he comes back…” Neville looked to Harry nervously.
Gemma’s laughter carried strong on the wind, and Harry’s smile spread into a beam.
thought Harry, but he kept it to himself. Instead, he gripped his wand tighter in his hand, cast a quick
The first thing Harry thought he really wanted was light. It was very dark in his cupboard, as the light bulb had blown several days earlier and Vernon had not wanted to fix it. So, Harry closed his eyes, and concentrated on wanting light.
“Leave the Snake Slayer alone, Gin,” came a voice from Harry’s other side.
“Oh, shut up,” said Draco, at the same time Blaise knocked him upside the head. “It’s still not a good idea.”
“Not controlling – you’ll find that I can be very persuasive, Harry. She had no idea what she was doing, of course; she was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Yet the power of the diary began to scare her, and she tried to dispose of it in the girls’ bathroom. And then, who should find it, but you, Hadrian Potter. The very person I was most anxious to meet.”
“Nice one, Neville,” Harry murmured, but Neville just seemed to blush harder.
Colin stopped, wide-eyed. “Oh. I- Sorry,” he said, and ran away.
These thoughts, and ones like them, were the main cause of Harry’s intense relief that the Sorting Hat had elected to place him in Slytherin, not Gryffindor. At least in Slytherin, fraternity was a key trait – rather than the shallow act of chivalry Harry had observed of Gryffindors like Ronald Weasley. Gryffindors liked to
Longbottom looked shocked – though he had looked shocked since Harry had walked into the Hospital Wing, so perhaps that was just his resting face.
“Two-”
“Makes one wonder how he managed to keep anything a secret, with this level of drama-”
Neville nudged her meaningfully.
“Well, yes, but that’s not the point.”
“That was
“A professional dragon tamer.”
“But what are we going to do?”
However, because of a very old man named Albus Dumbledore (and, indirectly, the imprisonment of a man named Sirius Black and the wild grief of a man named Remus Lupin), Hadrian James Potter had nowhere else to go after his parents’ deaths, and so he was placed with a man and a woman who hated him, and a child whose screeching almost made up for Harry’s silence – and there Harry stayed.
(Minerva McGonagall noticed this, and said nothing, though the feeling of suspicion that had settled in her chest since receiving Harry Potter’s letter tightened, just a little.)
“Excuse me?” Draco was gaping. “You can’t just tell me to shut up!”
“Merlin’s beard, you’re right,” murmured Tracey. “We’ve actually solved it.”
“Hear what? Harry, are you alright?” Draco asked, brow furrowed in concern.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Who?”
“Why would Ginny Weasley’s journal have been cursed? And I was fine, anyway, so it’s all okay.”
. He found Narcissa again, and carefully followed her line to- a scorch mark. Harry furrowed his brow. So Sirius Black had been disowned sometime in the decade before Harry was born – but why?
“You stupid Gryffindor!” Daphne cried, before collapsing onto him dramatically.
?” yelped Lockhart.
Draco pointed. Harry stared. Flourish and Blotts stood ahead of them, but Harry couldn’t even see the store beyond the huge crowd of people packed in and against it. A tall sign resting precariously on top of the store read:
“Hello, Hadrian,” Narcissa Malfoy said with a smile. “Draco has told me all about you.”
“Shut up, Daphne,” said Draco with a haughty sniff. “Now: Hagrid. That’s a load of nonsense, isn’t it?”
That was Daphne, and suddenly she was in front of him, her green eyes close and her tone firm. “You did nothing wrong. Now breathe, and let us help you.”
As it turned out, Draco knew every single Slytherin in their year. Harry was introduced to a dark-skinned and stoic Blaise Zabini; an arrogant and beautiful Daphne Greengrass; a grumpy Millicent Bulstrode and her equally grumpy cat, Sabre; a quiet boy named Theodore Nott; a brown-haired Tracey Davis; and the girl who had distracted Draco at the Feast, who Harry learned was Pansy Parkinson.
“Hermione and Theo figured it out, before they were Petrified,” Harry told him.
But not quite. Harry entered the Slytherin Common Room (feeling rather sorry for himself, of course) to meet the cheerful grin of Gemma Farley.
“That arrogant prick was freaking Harry out!” Millicent snapped back. “What did you expect me to do? Leave him there?”
“Ah, yes,” the Defence teacher coughed, rising shakily to his feet. “Well, there you have it. That was a Disarming Charm. As you see, I’ve lost my wand. Ah, thank you, Mr Finch-Fletchley.”
“Yes, ma’am,” Daphne gave her signature million watt smile, and Madam Pomfrey wandered out of the room with an air of delight.
Blaise didn’t answer. They sat in silence for a time.
“Hello, Professor!” one of them greeted cheerfully.
“Hermione’s family are Muggles, too,” Harry said quickly, ignoring Hermione’s subsequent glare. The diversion didn’t work – in fact, Harry suspected that once again, Colin hadn’t even noticed.
“We can.”
Harry nodded, and coughed slightly. “Cool. Truce.” He reached out to grasp Ron’s hand, realising too late that the hand he needed to shake Ron’s was currently being held by Draco, so he and Ron ended up just lamely tapping their right hands together.
“Might come in handy, anyway,” said Millicent, before things could get too awkward. “Having the Weasley twins on your side, that is. Didn’t you hear what they said about Lockhart? They’re going to kick his ass this year, because he was a creep to you.”
Harry and the Malfoys entered the courtroom with their heads held high. With high, circular walls of black marble and plaster, stands stacked high – and mostly full, Harry noted, though the trial was not set to begin for another half hour – and a single pensieve in the centre of the floor, the courtroom rather resembled a modified amphitheatre. Harry thought it seemed cold, and dark, and depressing.
“Of course I believe you, Draco, come here.” Harry pulled him into a hug, clutching tight as Draco took deep, jolting breaths against his shoulder.
Draco looked up, suddenly furious. “This is
“Doesn’t mean he has to be weird about it.”
Gloomily, Harry thought back to the crushing events after the trial the day before. Dumbledore had apparated them to Little Whinging, upsetting Harry’s stomach even more after the emotional shock.
Harry’s anger fizzled to a stop in his chest. “What?”
“Harry!”
Harry was happy to oblige, and so, apparently, were the rest of the Slytherins, because soon Harry was surrounded by warm arms and somehow, he didn’t feel claustrophobic.
Neville went bright red. “I- uh, it’s used for transfigurations, P-Professor. To reverse transfigurations.”
“Now you’ve done it,” he muttered at Hedwig, before heading downstairs.
Harry shook his head. “I’ll explain tomorrow, if you’re alright with meeting on a Saturday. At ten?”
The sound must have distracted Tom Riddle, because he was shouting something at Harry – or maybe at the twins, but all it served to do was remind Harry of what had to be done. Staggering over to where Tom and the Weasley twins were watching in shock, Harry dropped to his knees beside the diary. Ginny was still as death now, but he didn’t stop to check for her pulse. Instead, drawing ragged breaths into his burning lungs and fighting the black at the edges of his vision, Harry grabbed onto the basilisk fang in his arm, ripped it free with a scream, and slammed it as hard as he could into the cover of Tom Riddle’s diary.
Millicent looked at her like she’d just said she wanted to go swimming with the Giant Squid. “Because of the Nimbus 2001, of course!”
Blaise looked at him as though he were dim. “You do realise our Common Room is in the
Hedwig was the only real reminder that Hogwarts
Also - this is for the Neville lovers (myself included!)
The rest of the Slytherins exchanged similar goodbyes, and Neville and Hermione even gathered their courage to walk over and face the several glares they were greeted with so they too could say goodbye to Harry.
Lockhart gave him a bemused glance. “Hear what?”
“We aren’t going to rat you out, idiots,” Millicent interrupted.
“Ladies and gentlemen!” Lockhart continued, oblivious to Harry’s panic. “What an extraordinary moment this is! When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography,
Whatever he was going to say was cut off suddenly by a fierce, distant howl.
“Are you going to tell on us?” Hermione asked anxiously.
“Hannah, he’s a Parselmouth, and a Slytherin no less. That’s
, and began to read.
Uncle Vernon nodded, his many chins wobbling. “Good. And Dudley?”
, Harry’s brain supplied,
Harry thought of Hermione and Tracey. “A lot of research.”
Blaise shook his head. “Don’t ever do that again, you idiots.”
Blaise spoke as soon as the silencing ward was up. “You know this means they’ll target him.”
“Excellent idea, excellent idea. But if you don’t mind my saying so, it was very obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy.”
“Oh, come here, you idiot,” he demanded, voice wavering and eyes suspiciously wet as he strode towards Harry for a hug.
Hermione pushed on. “And doesn’t this all seem a bit extreme to any of you? I mean, even if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is really going to return – Dumbledore will deal with it, won’t he? Or the Aurors, or anyone who is, you know, a grown up?”
He was gone before they could get a word of reply, Blaise, Draco, and Pansy in tow.
Draco was awake, cross legged and twirling his wand. He opened his mouth to speak, but thought better of it at the last second and cast a whispered
“Quite the dramatics you had going, Potter,” Blaise smirked.
“Alright,” Harry said, kneeling by the door and tugging it open with a
“One more thing, though I doubt I need tell many of you this: should the culprit behind these attacks remain at large, the school will close. Notify your parents if they are unaware.” With a swirl of his cloak, Snape was gone.
“Oh no,” Hermione chewed on her lip anxiously. “Whoever it is has already passed through here.”
She gave him a look that very clearly said he was stupid. Harry tried not to be offended.
Draco sneered at her. “I followed
Conversation turned to lighter things, then, with Blaise leaving shortly after to go find Draco. Soon enough, it was curfew, and the Cerberus was the last thing on Harry’s mind, so distracted was he by his discussion on the use of magically enhanced plants in various potions with Hermione.
“Parseltongue won’t save you know, Potter – the basilisk obeys only me!”
“Draco?” he whispered, though he doubted the other boy was still awake. He was proven wrong a mere moment later.
Harry tried not to scowl at the reminder of their failed flying lesson. By the time Madam Hooch had got back, there had only been enough time left before lunch to hover a foot or so above the ground for a bit, and so no actual flying had taken place. Harry still felt remarkably cheated.
“You were with me for the Cerberus!” Harry protested. “There’s no point in-”
Harry shook his head. There was an anger running beneath his skin that was foreign and fierce, and he did not want to hold it back. Not while the man who had taken his mother and father from him stood just feet away.
Harry nodded.
That night, after a slap across the face from Vernon and the promise of not two but
“And as his brothers it’s our job-”
’, Harry reminded himself,
“You were brilliant today, Harry!” Colin Creevey beamed at him, his words punctuated by the blinding flash of his camera.
“There, there, Mr Potter,” the matronly witch said, patting his back until the fit subsided. “My name is Madam Pomfrey. Can you tell me what you remember?”
He wanted to cry. He didn’t.
By the time class was over, Harry was so tense he thought he might explode. Snape had a habit of leaning over the shoulders of his students threateningly, and if that wasn’t enough, an anxious looking Gryffindor named Longbottom blew up his cauldron towards the end of class. All in all, Harry had rather hated his first Potions lesson – though he and Blaise had brewed a perfect potion due to Harry’s snapshot memory and Blaise’s previous experience from tutoring – and he doubted his following ones would be any different.
“Theo had that one, see,” Harry showed her the parchment, and pointed to an annotation in Theo’s tiny, cramped handwriting that read, ‘
Therefore, it was with a small smile and relaxed shoulders that Harry settled himself into the nearest empty table, pulled out his Potions text, and began to read.
“What for?” Draco stepped forward, suspicious. “What’s going on?”
“Yeah, I do.”
“No such luck,” Harry replied shakily. The spiders surrounded them, slow, deliberate movements drawing them closer and closer. Fang had hidden himself between Harry and Draco’s legs, growling at the oncoming masses, eyes flicking wildly.
charm. Even with the modified spell, however, it was a gruelling process, and by the end of it all there was not a student in the class who had anything kind left to say about their new professor – not even Pansy or Daphne.
Then the pain was gone as suddenly as it had come, and Harry was looking up into the deep sombre eyes of a-
“Come along, Harry,” said Dumbledore.
The rest of the night passed in a blur. The teachers arrived, eventually, Snape and McGonagall and Quirrell, while Gemma and Adrian kept an eye on the first years – and the troll. Snape wasn’t pleased, Harry could tell, but McGonagall ignored him, and gifted fifty points each to Harry, Hermione, and Longbottom, for
“The stomach of a goat, sir.”
The gargoyle lifted its wings in what perhaps was meant to be a welcoming gesture, and McGonagall gently pushed Harry onto the platform within its wings. The ugly snarl of the creature’s mouth seemed even more menacing up close.
Harry was frustrated when he turned to open
– the girl who had been trailing after the twins in Diagon Alley – was very decisively placed in Gryffindor. Fred and George seemed to have used some sort of charm on their voices, as when they cheered for her, it was so loud that even the Slytherins on the other end of the Hall winced and covered their ears. The twins gave Harry a wink when he caught their eye, and pointed towards Lockhart. The new Defence teacher’s face had gone an alarming shade of purple – their shrieking had affected him especially. Harry grinned at the sight. He got the feeling it was going to be a very good year.
Blaise was the last to leave. He hadn’t said much – rather, he’d been watching Harry with dark, careful eyes since the conversation with Snape.
Only one more chapter after this!
Harry nodded slowly, and the girl smiled, showing off her prominent buck teeth.
Harry looked at Draco, Blaise, Hermione, and Neville in resignation, and shrugged.
The first years froze.
“What’s your story?”
Tom ignored the interruption. “You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger.”
Millicent Bulstrode was one of those, and she shook her head. “That’s all well and depressing, but I don’t know what you want us to do about it, Blaise. We’re of no use against the Dark Lord, at least not until we reach maturity.”
“You do not come from the forest,” the Acromantula said, voice slow and rasping and deep, echoing through the trees. Harry thought he could feel it in his bones. “Who are you?”
Tracey smiled tentatively. “That’s good, right?”
“Harry? Harry, are you okay?” Draco sounded frantic. Harry was more concerned with the fact that he sounded muffled.
A loud
Harry just shook his head, and led the way after their new teacher.
Dumbledore’s features turned sombre again, just briefly, before he smiled amiably. “I’m afraid that’s a question for a later time, Harry. Tom Riddle used very dark magic to create that diary, and it’s nothing you should concern yourself with just yet.”
Lockhart stepped up to the edge of the pit apprehensively, prodded forward by the twins’ wands, and peered down into the dark. “Err…”
Wow it has been a long time and I am very sorry but, er... I'm back?
Possibly, Harry thought, he shouldn’t be enjoying this as much as he was. The disdain in his aunt’s eyes hurt, still – it certainly cut far deeper than Harry wanted it to – but there was a touch of fear there, too. If Harry ignored, for a moment, that tiny part of him that still wished desperately for any inkling of affection from his closest living family, he could acknowledge that Mrs Dursley being frightened of a simple letter was pretty funny.
Harry waited for his parents and friends to appear, but instead- his Mirror-self gave a slow, deliberate smile, and reached carefully into his pocket. When he removed it – without Harry’s real self moving in any way – within the Mirror-self’s palm lay a small, blood-red stone. The Mirror-self winked, and carefully place the Philosopher’s Stone back into his pocket.
Harry’s mind was filled with questions, and after reading the letter once more, he promptly had to sit down and take several deep breaths in an effort to recover.
Tracey shushed the two and wished the boys goodnight before accompanying them, Millicent following suit with Sabre hissing at thin air in her arms.
That Sunday afternoon, Harry found himself cornered in an abandoned potions classroom somewhere in the vast labyrinth of the dungeons by one Blaise Zabini.
(For Vernon Dursley, it was a lot of other things, involving a lot of words which should not be spoken in front of children, even silent ones.)
Harry blinked at the display, but it appeared that this was not out of place, as Professor McGonagall simply continued:
He opened the door, and was greeted by a flash of white that nearly bowled him over.
wasn’t frightened, obviously.”
.” The honorific was spat out like an insult, and Harry managed to smile slightly in pride.
“That doesn’t mean we just ignore her like-”
That, too, was fantastic news, though Harry wouldn’t feel quite right until he’d seen every single one of his friends with his own eyes. Especially Hermione and Theo – the image of them in this very Hospital Wing, pale and ice cold to the touch, still lingered, nightmarish, in the back of his mind.
Daphne, Harry noticed, was clutching back just as tightly.
Not Sirius Black on the other. Harry didn’t know who Andromeda was, or why she would eventually be struck from her family tree, and at that point he really didn’t care. The words on the page were so cramped, finding Narcissa’s name had seemed impossible, let alone another. Harry looked up from the book with a sigh. The bedroom door was blurry. He blinked to readjust his eyes, but succeeded only in worsening his headache.
doing, I think is a better question,” said Draco, grimacing at a pile of hair products beginning to spill sticky liquid onto the floor. “And what happened to your office?”
“Like in Greek Mythology,” Hermione cut in. “With the Cerberus that guards the Underworld.”
Harry’s fingers tightened around his broom. “Trying out, Captain. For Seeker.”
Harry didn’t really think a phoenix counted as a pet, but he supposed it wasn’t his place to say.
The four Slytherins looked at him.
that it almost overwhelmed him with fond emotion. One night, and already Harry missed his best friend terribly. He missed all of his friends, and he missed Narcissa’s gentle guidance, and he missed Hogwarts, and magic, and the freedom that lay outside Privet Drive. He had to wait a moment to count deep, even breaths as Tracey had taught him to do when he got overwhelmed, but once he was ready, he moved on to Narcissa’s letter.
“See you later, Ronniekins!” called the twins in unison, before they headed off down the passageway.
The massive, three-headed dog in front of them snored loudly, oblivious.
“Okay,” Harry said, once Dobby had fulfilled his end of the deal. “Goodbye now, Dobby.”
The world snapped back to awareness at the sound of his name. Harry blinked, and found Blaise Zabini looking at him with something he didn’t recognise.
Narcissa turned to Harry next. She knelt before him as she had Draco. The marble floors of the Manor were perpetually spotless, but Harry had to resist a nervous glance at her dress nonetheless.
“No, it’s. It’s okay.” Draco looked less shaky than before at least, and gave a small smile before squaring his shoulders and glancing towards the spiders. “Should we get the others?”
Oh. But there
Pansy shook her head. “Hang on, but Basilisks are huge! Surely someone would have noticed a giant snake roaming the castle? How’s it getting around?”
I'm back! We should be coming back into regular update time now (that's three to five days) because all my exams are done, and I'm on holiday! Thank you all for your kind wishes and comments :) Please enjoy!
Lockhart surveyed the class with a gleam in his eye and, seeing them all suitably on edge, whipped the cloth covering the cage to one side, revealing-
Harry sighed for the eighth time in the last five minutes. The passageway into the Chamber seemed never-ending, and the twins’ constant chattering wasn’t exactly helping. If it wasn’t their sister waiting ahead, he might’ve hexed them himself. But it was, so he kept walking, and restricted himself to sighing again.
“Not a problem,” Blaise stepped forward with a smirk, Draco half a step behind. “
“Who is that?” Millicent asked bluntly, ignoring the pleasantries (as she usually did).
“Guys,” he said. No one listened, so he said it again. It was Neville who drew the attention of the room, however.
The group stood in silence for a moment, listening, before Lockhart’s voice echoed up from the bottom of the pipe:
“Someone get Professor Snape!”
Feeling Draco’s warmth against him, the knowledge of forgiveness and friendship secure in his chest, Harry closed his eyes, and breathed.
things, like
Draco moved forward, lifting himself onto his tiptoes to see above Harry’s shorter head. His heart stopped.
“And if we don’t?” Harry asked through gritted teeth, forcing his muscles to relax as thick vines began to squeeze his waist.
” Hermione asked. She appeared to be getting a little fed up with not knowing what Tracey was talking about. Harry didn’t blame her – he didn’t like not knowing things either.
With that, she took a handful of floo powder from the golden pot, and stepped into the fireplace.
Harry grinned at them. “Sounds good to me. And – thank you, for coming with me. I know you didn’t do it for me, but. Thanks.”
“Very well.” Narcissa stood, smoothing down the skirt of her elegant dress robe. She did not spare Petunia another glance. “Let’s go back to Draco, shall we?”
Harry wanted to ask what exactly it was Blaise had to tend to so vaguely, but Draco turned to look at him and the wide eyed stare he received made it all to easy to let Blaise go without comment.
“We have to do something!”
The stranger didn’t look like he believed him, but he said nothing. He turned away to a wall of keys behind him and selected one for Harry.
Draco looked about ready to yell at Dumbledore himself, but a staying hand from Narcissa kept him silent. Instead, he clutched Harry’s shoulder under his palm. “It’s not long to go, now,” he said.
Whether Dudley had also got the memo remained to be seen – Harry’s cousin hadn’t been home when he arrived, likely out with his gang of bullies, and Harry had stayed in his room ever since. Small victories; the welcome he had received upon his return to Number 4 was quite awkward enough. Petunia had pursed her already pinched lips at him and then pointedly ignored him in favour of her magazine, and Vernon hadn’t seemed able to decide between being smug at Harry’s misfortune or furious that they hadn’t gotten rid of him for good. Ultimately though, they both let him be, and Harry was grateful. He felt stronger in the face of his aunt and uncle than he ever had before, thanks to his time at Hogwarts and the support of his friends and Narcissa, but he had no intention of testing that resolve against Vernon’s anger anytime soon. Even if the Dursleys didn’t know it, Harry’s wand was useless in the Muggle world until he came of age at 17, which made him defenceless. The thought made his skin crawl.
“Alright,” he said, and stepped forward.
Draco looked ready to argue again, but Gemma took his arm gently.
“Bu’ see- ye need t’ promise me somethin’.”
“I’m sure you can, Harry,” Narcissa assured him calmly. “The point is that you do not have to handle it alone.”
Hermione flushed lightly. “It’s in
With both Tracey and Dilly rushing them along like a pair of mother hens, the shopping for school supplies took surprisingly little time. Before Harry knew it, all they had left was-
Harry swallowed. Pulling the ‘I’m on good terms with the Minister of Magic’ card – Harry could already tell this wasn’t going to any well.
Harry thought wryly. He wasn’t particularly torn up about it.
A slight filler. Enjoy anyway?
Pansy groaned. “Why?”
Harry shifted uncomfortably. “It’s nothing, really. I just think it would be better if I went alone.”
“Granger,” Harry said.
“Ah, yes. Halloween was when I discovered you could be a danger to me – and Snape proved himself.” Quirrell turned, staring at a tall, covered object against the wall. “I let the troll in, but Snape wasn’t fooled. While everyone else was running to the dungeon, he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He rarely left me alone.”
The Dursleys would be hard pressed to break him with those images in his mind.
“Oh zip it, Weasel,” Pansy retorted.
Millicent cursed.
“Not over the top at all, of course-”
Harry jolted, spinning around. Professor McGonagall took in the scene, her stern face carefully neutral.
Draco was silent. His grey eyes had finally met Harry’s, piercing and vulnerable.
Unfortunately for Harry, they didn’t actually get to the flying part of the lesson.
Narcissa: 1, Dumbledore: 0!
him.”
Narcissa’s façade softened just slightly at the approach of her son, and warmth melted the icy blue of her eyes. “Are you alright, my darling?”
As soon as he was gone, Harry read every single one of his letters. Then he searched his room for the broken stub of a pencil he had been allowed, and scratched out replies, explaining his whole situation and how he hoped they were well. At the end of Draco’s, he added:
There was a girl with bright red hair – another Weasley, Harry guessed – standing behind them, who lingered after they walked away. Harry gave her a smile, but she just turned red, and quickly ran after her brothers.
Outwardly, he smiled. “I’m glad she’s okay, sir.”
“Who was it, Myrtle?” Blaise asked, strangely gentle.
“Yes,” Blaise said.
“Hello, Hagrid,” Harry said cautiously. “Is everything alright?”
that whatever catastrophe you’ve gotten yourself into that time is too important to wait, then we are all going.
normal, as Dudley Dursley’s birthday came only once a year as it did for everybody else, but neither was it
“I am terrified,” Harry hissed to his friend as they walked out onto the pitch, gripping the handle of the new Nimbus 2001 tightly.
Harry thought for a moment. Professor McGonagall had told him all about the four Houses of Hogwarts (though he got the feeling she was a bit biased towards her own House, Gryffindor) and Draco had told him about them, too (though he was
It had been a very long day.
“Oh – how very sweet,” she murmured, smiling. “Well, Miss Greengrass, I trust you’ll keep this lot out of trouble. Just for a wee moment, alright? I’ll be back in a jiffy.”
Daphne flushed pink and scoffed. “Goldstein isn’t even on the team, he’s a total bookworm. You should be setting him up with Granger over there.”
Harry steeled his nerve, and drank.
“And you think they should have?” Neville asked. He jutted out his chin in a challenge that likely would have seemed more impressive had his hands not been shaking – but he challenged nonetheless.
“He’s a bit of a prick, really-”
The troll was lumbering forward angrily, so without thinking Harry struck it behind the knees with every hex he had been taught. Before he could tell Longbottom the counter, however, someone was already crying out:
Draco shivered. “The way he looked at you…”
The point remained, however, that the whole school was concerned when Hadrian Potter was injured; Neville Longbottom, on the other hand, was inconsequential. Perks of being the Boy Who Lived, he supposed.
“Even if asking a guy that huge if he killed people fifty years ago
Harry looked up at the familiar voice. “You think I should?”
“Erm, Harry?” Hermione began nervously. “We should really get back.”
The thing seemed to spread fully across the clearing, but it was almost impossible to tell where the creature ended and the shadows began, everything was black on black except for a set of eight, glistening eyes high above Harry’s head. It was the size of an elephant, Harry thought, remembering the friendly looking animals he’d encountered at the zoo with the Dursleys, maybe bigger. It was only when the thing came close enough for the lantern to illuminate two of its massive, hairy legs that Harry realised what it was.
“Don’t bet on it,” Blaise murmured.
The Gryffindor looked like he was about to apologise again, but Professor Sprout had apparently decided they’d had enough time to catch up.
“Hello Fred, George,” Harry said carefully.
“Professor Kettleburn? He teaches Care of Magical Creatures, and a Cerberus is definitely a magical creature. Maybe he’s taking care of it,” Draco suggested.
“And the snakes everywhere are so tasteful-”
Hermione hummed, chewing on a stray piece of hair that had wandered too close to her mouth, brows furrowed in thought. “Did the first door have any locks?”
“I have no clue, Trace,” said Draco. “But if we linger any longer, we’re going to miss the game.”
“Oh, Harry,” Neville interrupted quietly before Harry could ask his friend what was wrong. “Um, I thought you might want to know – Fred and George and Ginny are on your side.”
“I want to know what’s behind it. What’s so dangerous that it could kill us, yet can be kept in a school with kids passing it every day?”
Harry moved forward, splashing through the thin layer of water to peer inside the bathroom.
they were friends, all of them, and yet here he was, alone in his brand new bedroom at Number 4, Privet Drive, twelve years old, and he had not a single letter from any of the wonderful people he remembered.
“Aw,” Blaise grinned in amusement. “Were you scared, Draco?”
The quote from Dumbledore is taken straight from the first movie. Oh, and I know canonically the encounter with Fluffy happens a bit later on, but honestly - fuck it.
This would certainly be a night to remember.
Astoria plucked the folded up parchment from Hermione’s hand and passed it to him.
The books that Narcissa had sent for Harry turned out to be on magical family trees. A simple guide for reading magical genealogy charts; Wilmott the Wild’s self-updating
Harry,
Gilderoy Lockhart ruins the day.
Harry pointedly stared in the opposite direction.
“Hadrian Potter, don’t tell me you’re thinking of not going to try-outs?”
Dobby shuffled back towards the wardrobe, shaking his head.
“Day?”
Harry winced. “Thanks, Colin. But I really need to-”
“In your own time,” he heard Ron say, impatient, behind him, but his friends snapped back quicker than Harry could overthink it:
Theo just shrugged.
Harry snapped his eyes open and lunged forward with a threatening snarl, making Dudley swear and stumble backwards.
“I’m fine,” Draco responded shortly. “Shut up and focus on not tripping.”
“And if it isn’t?” Draco pressed.
“Funny.”
“Draco?”
“Sorry about that,” Gemma smiled at him, jumping off of her table. “I love our House, we’re the best of the school, no doubt – but some of us just don’t know when to back off.”
Harry flushed. Admittedly, he hadn’t really been thinking when he chose to, quite literally, dive into the diary.
“There are many ways evil can return to the world, Hadrian. Unfortunately, I do not doubt that Voldemort will find one of them so that he may revive himself once again.”
“Yep.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, swallowing nervously. “Let’s keep moving.”
Harry opened his eyes. The whole Hall was staring at him, with varying degrees of hope and shock, but none looked so hopeful as Draco Malfoy.
The thought was a certainty, but it was not a comfort.
“You should come stand with me, Harry,” Ron said, turning away from Draco. “You don’t want to be friends with a
The twins shared a look. “Oh, we know Hagrid.”
The Forbidden Forest is spooky, and mysteries are solved.
“Ah, how he knew where you were?”
The conjured creature hissed at him, but lowered itself down obediently.
Although, knowing Narcissa Malfoy, fear was quite probably an appropriate reaction.
Tracey put her hands on her hips again. “It could still be a concealment spell.”
Hermione froze. “But I remember that smell. That was the-”
“I’m sorry, Hadrian,” Gemma petted his arm sympathetically. “He really seems to dislike you.”
Thank you all, again, for your comments and kudos. They mean a lot to me <3
“Um, yes, that should be fine,” Hermione nodded, slightly awkwardly.
Draco rolled his eyes. “No, you dolt. I was just going to ask. Mother and I have been talking, about what’s going to happen over the holidays.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Embarrassingly, it took a full week for Harry to think to ask Hermione exactly
’s biggest fan?”
Harry felt rather awkward, explaining what had happened to one of his best friends and the Lady Malfoy, but he kept as many of the details as he could out of it. He kept it to the basics: he had been in his room, he had woken frightened from a nightmare, his magic had sent him onto the street, and he had run away. He didn’t want anyone to know about the Dursleys, let alone Draco and Narcissa. He didn’t think he could stand it – the disappointment on their faces, knowing that he had let the Dursleys hurt him, let them lock him in a cupboard, knowing he hadn’t done anything to stop it. Even thinking of it all brought a hot flush of shame to his cheeks, and he carefully turned his head away under the pretence of examining the room so that neither Draco nor his mother could see.
Millicent gave him a scalding look. “You didn’t think the Forbidden Forest. Which is expressly forbidden. To everyone. The forest that you have previously been attacked in and nearly died. You didn’t think that forest. Was going to be ‘that dangerous’?”
Harry remembered everything, and so it was with crystal clarity that he recalled the events of his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry: being Sorted into Slytherin; the Great Hall sparkling with light; the troll at Halloween; the Cerberus on the third floor; the parasitic remains of Voldemort crumbling with Quirrell under his bare hands; and of course, his friends. Draco, Blaise, Hermione, Neville, Pansy, Millicent, Daphne, Theodore, Tracey – even Adrian and Gemma. He’d
“Riddle.”
Despite what Draco and Blaise may think, Harry was actually aware that this was his second year in a row walking towards a fatally dangerous situation, and honestly he wasn’t super thrilled about it. Nor was he pleased about what it probably said about him, but at least this time he had company – even if that company was two loud-mouth Gryffindors.
“I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that-”
allowed to the zoo. He had been to the library, once, but other than that knew very little about the entertainment Little Whinging had to offer. He wasn’t entirely certain whether to be excited or afraid.
Harry didn’t care enough at that moment to question the evasive answer. Neville was the only one who had noticed his and Astoria’s discovery, and he was watching in baited silence from Hermione’s other side. Harry unfolded the parchment. It read:
“Thanks. And, by the way,” Harry shot him a grin, “You can call me Harry.”
“Calm down, Draco,” a smooth voice interrupted them. “Don’t overwhelm him.”
frightening.
(by his association with Draco or his fame, he didn’t know) and the sudden change was frazzling his nerves.
Harry nodded. Only a few weeks and then they would be at Hogwarts again – but what about the summer after that? He thought he had been free – had gotten too optimistic, to believe himself rid of the Dursleys for good. This, the Headmaster’s interference, was a harsh clap back to reality.
Harry took a deep breath. “I can’t promise I’ll care about what happens to me enough to not do stupid, reckless things, but… I don’t want to hurt you, Draco. I’ll be more careful. I promise.”
“The Chamber of Secrets was created by Salazar Slytherin when the founders built the school,” Draco explained with a sigh at Hermione’s ignorance. “But he closed it and hid the entrance when he was cast out. It’s said he hid some sort of monster in there, but no one knows what.”
Harry closed his eyes. “Well done,” he replied mockingly, but his voice was weak.
“Charlie, great fella-”
“Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you,” McGonagall said from behind him, and then the gargoyle’s stone wings closed again, trapping Harry within.
Millicent snorted. “He has a point.”
,” Harry said. The snake lifted itself from its coiled position and cocked its head to one side, as if curious. “
“I don’t know,” Harry replied. He carefully ignored the insulting comment. “Gryffindor have been playing well this last season, and the Weasley twins are easily the stronger beaters, but Hufflepuff have the better seeker…”
Harry paused. What an odd thing to say. “Uh, thanks Myrtle.”
“Well,” Hermione huffed. “At least that’s one problem dealt with. Now we just need to find out about-”
“What can I do for you, kiddo?” the man asked cheerfully, though his eyes examined Harry with a curiosity that made Harry want to squirm.
“Harry…” Draco breathed.
“How comforting,” said Harry. He refused to lower his voice. The Forest was far from silent around them, creaking and shuffling as if alive, and speaking quietly seemed only to serve to emphasise those unsettling sounds. “And we’ve already met a centaur – Firenze, remember? He was… nice.”
“As a matter of fact-”
was a piece of cake. Sure enough, there was the scorch mark indicating where Sirius Black’s name used to be. Only next to it in this book was a tiny symbol. A quick flick through found the appendices in the final pages, and then all Harry had to do was match the symbol and finally get some answers.
“How to put this simply,” Harry tilted his head, voice shaking with anger. “
“Of course,” Draco said, before pausing. “Are you really okay though? After everything?”
The only irritants in the holidays were the glares from Ronald Weasley (which Harry found easier to ignore by the day), and the constant pranks by the Weasley twins and Peeves the poltergeist (which were actually incredibly funny – when Harry wasn’t affected by them). Harry’s personal favourite was when the twins charmed snowballs to follow Professor Quirrell around and hit him on the back of the turban. Maybe that would make it stop smelling so strongly of garlic, Harry mused.
Hermione reached forward to give Harry a sweet smile and a squeeze on the arm. “We’re here for you, Harry. Whatever you need.”
? Harry, no-”
“But Harry killed him,” Hermione Granger interrupted. A witch of outstanding talent and passion for learning, she was at a distinct advantage in this room, because she was the only one with the often underrated Muggleborn point of view. “And the Philosopher’s Stone is destroyed.”
“Hermione, we have to go, I’ll explain later,” Harry took another step inside.
“My parents are dentists, they would cry if they saw me making a cake!” Hermione explained with a huff.
Harry dubbed the resistant voice
Harry shrugged. “I’ve been worse. Where are Draco and Blaise, by the way? And Neville and Theodore?” He peered through his circle of friends, but couldn’t find the four.
Despite Harry’s buried concerns, the trio made it out of the castle, into the broom shed, and then into the air without any troubles.
“Neville? What’s going on?”
” shrieked Pansy.
“Maybe,” Harry said, and focussed on the barely visible trail of tiny spiders leading them further into the trees. Although – had the spiders gotten bigger?
“It’s really
No one spoke to him, despite their staring; not even Draco Malfoy. Harry didn’t think it was entirely Draco’s fault, however, as a girl with dirty blonde hair and an upturned nose was happily clutching at his attention.
Harry groaned again, though this time with annoyance as Gilderoy Lockhart rushed forward, wand out.
else would have been more suitable, but I will find out, and whoever is responsible will be punished. No child deserves to be treated the way you and your filthy husband have treated that boy.
Theodore Nott was a boy of few words, for many reasons. One of these reasons was that he could infuse so much meaning into one arched eyebrow that he needed no supplementary speech. The slight twitch of one brow in Blaise’s direction asked the question for him.
He turned back to the waiting Slytherins with a small smile. “You might want to find some chairs – we have a lot to tell you…”
The chestnut centaur stepped further forward with another shake of his hair. “The spiders attacked our foals,” he snarled. “We hunt for revenge, not to save wizard lives when wizards care so little for our own.”
“What are you saying?”
“What on Earth is he doing in there?” Hermione asked.
“And Theo?” Blaise raised one scornful brow. “How are you explaining that one, genius?”
“No worries, Neville,” Harry told him. “I’ll see you after break.”
Harry’s heart was jackhammering in his chest. He hadn’t realised he’d been that transparent; a single week at Hogwarts and already he was flaunting his weaknesses on his face, just like he’d spent his whole childhood teaching himself not to do. Disgust twisted his stomach again.
Unfortunately, he wasn’t given much choice.
“She’s quite protective, isn’t she?” Harry said. He wasn’t sure if he was amused or envious.
Draco had gone quite pale – paler than usual. He swallowed once, twice.
“Harry-”
“Expelliarmus!”
“Devil’s Snare?” Hermione gasped. “But that’s deadly!”
it, Granger, just enchant part of it,” Blaise rolled his eyes.
“I know,” Draco sighed. “Heir of Slytherin. Is it better or worse that it’s true?”
One day, not long after Dudley’s birthday, Harry was collecting the mail when he found something
Harry’s frown deepened. Hagrid seemed likeable enough, but his size still made Harry uncomfortable, reminding him far too much of his whale of an uncle.
“It was sitting on top of a trapdoor,” Harry told her, leaning forward over the desk they had chosen, hidden in the back of the library. “No lock that I could see on the outside, but it was just made of ordinary wood – not exactly secure.”
“He will not judge you, Harry,” Narcissa told him, gently. “But it is your secret to tell. I will not share it for you.”
“I know what day it is,” Dudley said.
“I think I’ve just understood something… oh! I’ve got to go to the library!” She spun on her heel, and abruptly hurried away.
“Merlin, Harry,” Draco rolled his eyes. “You could muster up a little enthusiasm. Aren’t you going to try out for the team? I certainly am. And Father said if I make the team he’ll buy us all brand new Nimbus 2001s!”
“I don’t,” Harry replied. “I mean, this is only the second time I’ve flown.”
Harry resisted the urge to smile. Perhaps it made him a bad person, but he had spent so long feeling terrified of Aunt Petunia, of Uncle Vernon and Dudley and that awful, awful house. He was still afraid – but it was satisfying, to some dark part of himself, to see them afraid, too.
“He and his wife have enough Elixir to set their affairs in order. But yes, they will die.”
Harry glanced to his left and was met with three familiar sets of eyes. Draco was leaning forward, anxiety written clearly over his features; flanking him, to Harry’s surprise, were Blaise Zabini and Gemma Farley.
“And?”
“Well, if it’s just a social call, then you can refuse,” said Draco. He still wasn’t pleased that Neville and Hermione got to visit Hagrid with Harry, while he had to stay behind.
Harry barely noticed his movement until Narcissa was knocking sharply on the Dursleys’ door with her wand. The sound echoed loudly in the quiet of Little Whinging. Harry’s heart beat louder.
“Perhaps,” the snake said eventually, and probably would have said something else had Dudley not chosen that precise moment to shove Harry to the ground and begin shouting at the top of his lungs for Piers to come and see.
The Slytherins were paired with the Gryffindors for double Potions on Friday mornings, but the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs had the same in the afternoons. Knowing how long they had spent in the library this time, Harry suspected they would miss dinner – but he didn’t mind, and he doubted Hermione did either.
, and started the long descent.
Despite his burning curiosity, Harry opened the letter from Draco first. He snorted at the opening lines.
They ran a fair way, up and down several staircases in attempts to evade Filch, his cat, and any prefects on patrol.
think of a small, dark cupboard under a staircase. Neither did he think of heavy fists on that thin door, or cruel insults cutting at his self-esteem.
Narcissa meets Petunia - and is unimpressed.
“Oh, plen’y,” he replied, with a frankly unnecessary amount of enthusiasm. “Love animals, I do. ‘specially the rarer ones, y’know? A lo’ of creatures are just misunderstood, really.”
“Be careful,” said Blaise.
“That’s great, Colin-”
“If you are all ready,” Professor McGonagall said, sneaking up on them and causing several of the children to jump.
“Absolutely! You’re a natural, kid – a little more practise, you could be one of the best damn seekers in the game!”
The Leaky Cauldron was a welcome sight to Harry’s tired eyes. The world was lightening; Harry had been walking for hours, so long that he could barely feel his feet. Everything he owned was back at the Dursleys’, save for the tattered hand-me-downs on his back. Harry was exhausted, and frightened, and very, very, alone.
“Goodnight, Miss Farley, Mr Potter.”
Just like troll hide.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry got the feeling that she had great doubt in Lockhart’s ‘skills’.
“Maybe he just got in the way. Or maybe you just got him for fun. I wouldn’t be surprised, it’s not like Slytherins would know anything about loyalty-”
“Why?”
Harry looked from one twin to the other, as one introduced himself as Fred, and the other as George.
“Welcome back, Potter,” said Blaise. His smirk was casual, but there was something in his eyes that Harry thought might have been relief. Relief that he was safe – that they all were.
“That absolute
Harry took a deep breath. Stay calm. That’s what the Headmaster had said. How hard could that be?
“We’re several floors up with no riskless way of getting back to the Common Room,” Blaise rolled his eyes. “I’m not certain that counts as safe.”
“The monster was born in the castle,” Aragog rasped. “I came from a distant land, in the pocket of a traveller.”
“Harry, look at me.”
“Hey, Neville. How were your holidays?”
“Creevey!” Draco snapped. “Move. Along.”
Blaise smirked at her. “I speak only the truth, Granger.”
The medi-witch gave a small smile. “Then hush, the both of you. Professor Snape will be here soon.”
Narcissa’s letter, to Harry’s surprise, caused even more of a tightness in his chest than Draco’s. Malfoy Manor had enough rooms for half the population of Hogwarts to reside in without the Malfoys themselves even noticing, and yet the idea of his room at the Manor remaining
Hermione furrowed her brow. “What did he look like, this stranger?”
, Harry’s frantic brain provided suddenly, but it was drowned out by an awful cry coming from above. Harry risked a look upwards and saw bloody tears streaming down the basilisk’s face as it shrieked in pain.
“Guys, shut up,” Harry ordered quietly. “We need to work out where we are.”
“We’re going to need to move it,” Blaise murmured, pointing.
“And ‘arry, you’ll go with Malfoy.”
His peace lasted one hour.
Weasley paused. “I can find some. Two.”
that he just
This comment startled a laugh out of Harry. Blaise gave him a small smirk, and Harry’s smile grew.
“I know!” Myrtle cried, flopping dramatically against the window. “It’s just like when I was alive, really. Have you heard of Olive Hornby? She was the real cruel one.”
The door swung open. Albus Dumbledore stepped inside, grim-faced, and behind him a squat looking man in a pinstripe suit.
Harry froze.
“A letter,” said Harry. “From Narcissa Malfoy.”
Harry was beginning to formulate a snarky response in his mind, but was unfortunately cut off by a grating, scraping, rasping sound that could only barely be called a voice saying:
Harry shook it silently, and gave a small smile. After all, Malfoy, Draco Malfoy didn’t seem very nice, but Harry didn’t want to make enemies on his first day.
“Right, that it is Miss Gremmer,” Lockhart continued. “Off we go!”
“Ugh, gross!” Draco yelped and tripped over a mossy root on the forest floor, hands coming up frantically to wipe at his face. “Oh, that is disgusting!”
Harry heard Tracey’s murmured, “You guys really shouldn’t tease him like that”, before they left earshot.
,” he commanded, and the snake vanished into smoke.
The professor gave him a brief smirk, before turning them both to face the Mirror.
“Haven’t you checked the notice board?” Draco was still pulling at him excitedly. “Quidditch try-outs have been announced for this Friday!”
“Or three.”
“Uh,” Harry said, eloquently.
“Of course I’m alive, honestly, I should be saying that to you!” She pulled back from him again, and her eyes were wet. “Going into the Chamber, I mean how foolish! I thought Slytherins were supposed to have self-preservation.”
“A diversion?” Draco suggested. “Maybe someone tried to get the Stone on Halloween, and failed.”
Harry hesitated. “Never mind. I think I must just be getting tired – you know, I’d better be off to bed, Professor.” He stood quickly.
his uncle Vernon had backhanded him so hard he had fallen into a wall and broken his arm.
“Well this is delightful.”
“And then to Fortescue’s?” Pansy suggested. “They have a new flavour in, did you hear? And it’s the perfect weather for ice cream.”
“Don’t call me ‘Millie’.”
The letter stated, in emerald cursive,
Daphne sneered at her. “I don’t recall asking for your worthless opinion, Mudblood.”
“Yes, my boy?”
Harry almost wanted to laugh. Face-to-face with Voldemort, at this bloody school, again. He almost wanted to cry. He very much wanted to scream.
The third floor door swung open, and the group braced themselves for an angry Cerberus.
Harry opened the gift cautiously to reveal a large, soft cloak. It seemed to be fairly standard, until he put it on.
Harry bowed respectfully as Narcissa had taught him, and tried to silence the warning alarms signalling ‘danger’ in the back of his head.
Harry waited for the rush of shame at the confirmation that Draco knew his awful secret, but it did not come. His friend’s eyes were too kind, too understanding, and instead, Harry felt warm.
Halfway back to the Slytherin Common Room he heard voices from a nearby classroom. He would have passed right by, had he not heard his name.
a time they had met – when Harry was a baby. His memories of that time weren’t as clear as everything else, but they were still there. Rather, it was as though he were watching them from under water: muffled voices and tinted images. But he remembered Hagrid, if he thought hard enough – remembered being held in trunk-like arms and carried on a motorbike, staring up at the sky and up at the groundskeeper’s face. That was the night his parents died. The night the leader of the Dark had killed his mother in front of him, with a bright green light and two simple words. Before he knew about magic, Harry had thought he had perhaps imagined the strange light, but with research into his own history in the wizarding world he had discovered the truth. At least they said the Killing Curse was quick.
. Harry’s exhausted mind calculated that as a whopping two hundred points to Slytherin in one night, and he somehow dragged up the appropriate giddiness at the win. Still, he figured he had had enough adventure for one night (and from Longbottom and Hermione’s equally drained expressions, he guessed so had they), and he wanted nothing more than to collapse into his bed.
Harry glanced down at her announcement, and realised with a rush of nausea that she was right. Those weren’t pebbles Pansy was throwing at Lockhart, and that wasn’t the crush of gravel under their feet. Rather, it was the crunch of the skeletons of thousands of small animals, rats and mice and even what looked like possum skulls, layered over the stone ground and covered in slimy muck.
“Aw, Millie!”
Harry swallowed. “It’s amazing, you know.”
“Ah, ‘adrian Potter! I was wonderin’ if I might be seein’ you,” Hagrid greeted them. “And ‘oo are yer friends, then?”
The old wizard smiled genially. Harry did not return the gesture.
,” Tracey glared at him for the interruption. “But that still means that someone is.”
Blaise and Harry have a chat, Ronald Weasley crosses a line, and a new animal is discovered.
, he knew, he could clearly see the page in his
Harry met his eyes around the Mirror. “You killed my parents. I have a good memory. That means I’m not great at forgiveness.”
“Actually,” Draco said with a growing smile, “I’m staying at Hogwarts these holidays.”
Harry gasped in choked breaths and grabbed his wand with his other hand as the basilisk prepared to give the killing bite.
Harry looked up at her, startled, before he realised she wanted him to decide. He barely hesitated, before simply saying, “I trust Gemma.”
“Mr Potter? Mr Potter, open your eyes for me.”
“He didn’t say anything about this. He mustn’t have even told mother, she would have told me, she would have said something- I didn’t know he was going to take Dumbledore away, Harry, you must believe me-”
Blaise looked at her, for once allowing his scorn to coat his features. “Granger, no offence, but Dumbledore didn’t stop the Dark Lord last time. Baby Potter over there did. There are a lot of people who believe Dumbledore is – shall we say, past his prime.”
Ron was closest, so he moved to kneel at Lockhart’s side. Lockhart’s eyes snapped open in a flash, and in the general confusion of the fainted man abruptly sitting up, the professor managed to snatch Ron’s wand from him and aim it directly between the young Weasley’s eyes.
That is, until Professor Quirrell ruined it all.
Harry turned to face Theodore Nott, rather thankful for the distraction as he was getting quite annoyed. Hogwarts was meant to be his escape from being ordered about. He would not tolerate being mothered by Draco, friends or not.
“I- uh, Devil’s Snare hates sunlight. It was in a book I read.”
So not just Firenze in this forest, then,” Draco breathed.
“We know,” said Daphne, releasing Astoria’s hand to step forward and dab at her – very dry – eyes. “But- well, you see, we’ve been friends with Theo and Gr- Hermione a while now, and we’ll be ever so quiet, I promise. Just- us talking to them – it can’t hurt, can it?” She looked up on the last few words, eyes artfully wide, the picture of sad innocence.
“Onwards and upwards, then,” said George.
Tom smiled again, a mockery of comfort. “It won’t come until it’s called. And I’m afraid I can’t let you take her.”
Draco bit his lip for a moment, before apparently making up his mind on something and sitting up straighter on his seat. “Do you want to be friends?”
Harry furrowed his brow. “You can’t choose your parents.”
Harry might have laughed if he weren’t shaking. The spiders’ clicking was reaching a feverish pitch as the lantern seemed to dim at their approach. Harry drew his wand, but every spell he’d ever learnt seemed to vanish from his mind at the sight of the eight-legged onslaught.
she had been crying alone in the bathroom, and when he heard, he was nothing short of furious. Ronald Weasley had no right to attack Hermione, calling her a snooty know-it-all –
Hagrid coughed, opened his mouth to answer-
Ultimately, Harry’s exhausted brain decided it didn’t matter, because he couldn’t quite stop the rush of fatigue pushing his eyelids down. He couldn’t remember why he’d been fighting it, so he didn’t. His eyes closed against the strange visions above him, and he surrendered to the darkness.
“Damn stone floors,” he muttered, pushing himself up.
Once they had a little more privacy – though the charm was not revoked – she relaxed slightly and turned to Harry.
“Draco,” Harry said quietly, “Don’t panic.”
“Thank you.”
“I’m afraid you’ll have to excuse us, Headmaster, the boys have had a trying day.” Narcissa smiled gently, though her eyes remained cold.
“Did you think about whether you would get hurt or not when you entered the diary?”
The young Malfoy heir took a steadying breath and peered at his reflection once more. The mirror, enchanted and twice the size at least of the fateful Mirror of Erised from Harry’s first year, helpfully told Draco that the dark green of his formal robes was deeply flattering. Draco gave no reaction. Harry, not for the first time in his weeks at Draco’s ancestral home, wondered if the mirror had a ‘mute’ function.
No one protested. It was amazing, truly, how just two years with a boy like Hadrian Potter could lead to such a change in children. Some could call it fate. Some could call it prophecy. Or some could call it that very human tendency to find someone you care about and hold on tight, damn the consequences. Whatever the reason, every child in the room that day knew that they would do an awful lot for Hadrian Potter, and this fact alone would change everything.
He turned finally, though his eyes didn’t quite meet Harry’s.
“Very dramatic,” said another.
“Uh. Cool. Bye,” Ron said, and was out the door faster a snitch.
Before the conversation could move to more important things – such as Harry’s status as a suspect in the current series of attacks – Hagrid burst out of a side door by the gargoyle, still clutching the dead rooster Harry had seen him with earlier.
“Already here, Fudge? Good, good,” said the eldest Malfoy by way of greeting. He looked around Hagrid’s house like any part of it may be covered in disease.
Voldemort snarled. “Kill him!”
Harry stood up. “Right. Let’s go.”
“Hey, watch it!” Millicent tugged Pansy out of the way as Ginny Weasley scurried past them at high speed, wild red hair covering her face.
Draco visited Harry every day at the Leaky Cauldron over the following weeks, without fail. Narcissa joined them most days, as a supervisor of sorts, but when she had other business to attend to they were left with a Malfoy House Elf – Dilly. Dilly was a bit odd, Harry thought, but nice enough. And at least she wasn’t Dobby.
It wasn’t until his third night of exploring, however, that Harry encountered any danger.
“Uh…” Harry paused, closing his eyes to imagine a snake writhing, as the small etching on the tap had been pushed out of sight with the opening of the pipe. “
Dumbledore’s eyes lost some of their twinkle. Thinking carefully, Harry averted his own gaze and added, softly, “Plus, Ginny was dying. I had to save her. It was the best idea I had at the time.”
“I’m not- well, I’m not quite sure how predictable it all is, really,” said Neville Longbottom, frightened and brave in equal measure. “I- I mean, just because, Harry really, really, doesn’t seem to like Professor Dumbledore, and my grandmother says that Dumbledore will be the one leading – you know, the er, Light.”
“Okay,” Draco said after a moment. “Goodnight, Harry.”
Harry nodded. Everything and everyone had to die sometime. He had seen enough to know that.
I know it's really short, I'm sorry :( I've been having a little trouble creatively speaking, and I just wanted to get SOMETHING up, y'know? So, just a filler chapter really, I'm sorry, but I hope it's better than nothing! Also, side note: I am fully in love with Astoria as a character (at least the way she is in my head for this universe, lol) so expect a fair involvement of her in upcoming chapters/stories. Ok! Hopefully you enjoy this (incredibly short) chapter! <3
“Did you see the paper open on the table?” Harry asked, clicking his teeth in thought.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry flipped the pages again, but they remained stubbornly blank.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione was looking at him, aghast. “You followed us down here?”
Narcissa pursed her lips. “Hadrian?”
Harry found Neville Longbottom first thing the morning after Halloween. Draco was with him – true to Harry’s predictions, Draco had refused to let him go anywhere alone after the previous night’s fiasco – but Harry had made him promise to keep quiet while he spoke to the Gryffindor boy.
They chatted of their classes and teachers for the rest of the walk. Hermione was enjoying every class, it seemed, though she held a sort of hero-worship for Professor McGonagall, and looked on with slight envy when Harry told her how the professor had collected him from Number 4 Privet Drive. They were both very excited for Potions the next day, though Harry had gotten the feeling from the feasts and the speech in the Slytherin Common Room that Professor Snape didn’t like him all that much. Hermione dismissed the idea, and Harry didn’t push it, but the feeling remained.
, and who would want to be friends with a
The woman in question looked like she might collapse. Her face was white and even tighter than normal, and her eyes flickered quickly between the three magical folk in the front hall of her home.
“But he doesn’t understand,” Quirrell was continuing. “I’m never alone. Never.” He seemed to shake himself off then, focussing on the Mirror and not whatever debate was happening in his mind. “Now… What does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?”
“He said he wants to show us something. And he seems harmless,” Harry added, if just to appease Blaise.
“He’s an Alumnus,” said Theo, not bothering to look up from his book. “Attended Hogwarts fifty years ago.”
“Hello,” Harry said quietly. He wasn’t entirely certain why he did this – Harry didn’t overly like talking, and had not quite broken out of the silent habits of his younger years – but once again, he did not question it.
“It’s up to you, Draco,” he said quietly. “It’s your decision.”
“Shall we head out?” Tracey interrupted, before Blaise could escalate the situation. “We’ll want to get our supplies quickly.”
“I’m afraid they are, Tom.”
for a blood traitor,” Daphne snapped at her menacingly.
“Is that a threat, Zabini?”
Harry looked at his friends with new eyes, distracted for a moment from his own anxiety. He thought of Blaise’s quiet understanding at every turn; Theo’s silence and solemnity; the way Daphne and Astoria clutched at each other like lifelines. He noted Millicent’s clenched fists; Tracey’s averted eyes; the way Pansy was gnawing at her lip so fiercely he thought it might bleed. He saw Draco, staring out the window with damp cheeks.
Harry looked down at his hands. He had done nothing but postpone the inevitable, then.
his Muggleborn friend, but Harry had insisted. Hermione was intelligent, and she was his friend – she deserved to know about their adventure the night before, and maybe help them work out what a damned Cerberus was doing in Hogwarts. He’d only gotten Draco to agree by threatening to just go to the library and discuss it without him. Blaise, as per usual, was unbothered.
“That’s really interesting,” he said.
, that Tracey had used when searching for a link between Harry’s family line and the line of Slytherin; and two hefty tomes entitled
Neville gave a small smile, despite his anxiety at talking directly to any of the Slytherins that weren’t Harry. “The Bat-Bogey Hex.”
Harry repeated the mantra in his head several times, until Blaise nudged him lightly to get his attention. Harry tensed, but forced himself to relax a split-second later and turned to look at Blaise.
He nodded silently, and got to work.
“We don’t mean to eavesdrop,”
As it turned out, Harry did not need to work out the ‘owl’ business at all. This was because the next morning, after Harry had woken (earlier than the Dursleys so he could make their breakfast, as per usual), he discovered a large number of owls surrounding Number 4, Privet Drive. Harry was quite understandably shocked by this, but nonetheless went outside to investigate.
“I can’t believe we’re doing this. Yes,” Draco muttered.
Draco gave the ghost a filthy glare and pulled Harry’s arm until they were standing together at the top of the stairs into the Chamber. “We’re going, now.”
“Norbert?” Neville looked like he was going to pass out.
“Your mask is pretty good already, but it falls to pieces when Snape comes near. I noticed, soon enough someone else will too, and they won’t be as understanding as I am.”
Harry supposed he must have some survival instincts, no matter what the other Slytherins said, because he could very clearly hear them shouting at him to not go anywhere near that huge, dangerous paw.
. He’s not worth your time – or the potential punishment.”
Harry tried to keep up with their conversation, but the split speech was giving him whiplash. Still, he found the boys quite funny, and they seemed kind enough. Plus, they loved to talk, which made up quite nicely for Harry’s own quiet nature. Once Harry was settled in a compartment, however, they had to go.
Dumbledore sighed. “Headmaster Dippet may have no choice, I’m afraid.”
“You said it was a legend,” Hermione pointed out.
Harry woke with a gasp. The world was black. He struggled to get up, but the silence and the dark was pushing him down, choking his throat and suffocating him. Why couldn’t he see anything? Was he standing? Where was he? His hand touched something cold and wet and he snatched it back with a yelp. There was a loud curse from somewhere in the house, and then heavy footsteps on the landing.
Hadrian James Potter was a quiet boy.
“Ronniekins, you all good over there?” called Probably-Fred.
“But if they were really trying to hide something, they wouldn’t rely on a spell a thirteen year old would know,” Hermione pointed out.
Harry didn’t think of any of these things, except for when he did, and when he got into bed that night and drew his curtains, the wetness on his cheeks was from brushing his teeth, and nothing more.
“You scared the pants off everyone in the Common Room, Potter,” Gemma told him seriously, before smiling. “It was actually pretty funny.”
“Speak for yourself,” chimed in Pansy, achieving a frankly frightening amount of anger in her very short form. “I’ve been pissed off! You went to the Forbidden Forest and you
“Good.”
“Won’t that lead to unfair treatment?” Tracey questioned.
“And why can you not come in one or two at a time?” she asked, hair frazzled and hands on her hips. “I have patients to care for, and I can assure you, Miss Granger and Mr Nott are not going anywhere in a hurry.”
“He’ll go with or without our permission, Draco.”
Draco swallowed. “Not good enough. Any other ideas?” He drew his wand anyway, casting a weak light with the hastily stuttered spell.
“Did he say-”
Then he was gone, and Harry was left with his heart in his throat and his nails making crescents in his palms.
“Our sister would

despite his not residing there was almost painfully heart-warming. It said that he was wanted – indefinitely, even. It said that he belonged somewhere other than Hogwarts. It said that his absence was recognisable, beyond some drooping tulips outside a house where he had always been unwelcome.
The twins jumped to their feet, wands drawn in front of Ginny’s body. Harry noticed, absently, that her chest was rising and falling – alive, then. Funnily enough, he felt like it was him who was struggling to breathe.
Harry stared as the two left, followed quickly by his other friends until it was just him and Blaise in the hallway, Neville and Tracey giving him sympathetic smiles as they left, while Hermione gave him a tentative hug and a “good luck”.
Harry made to follow, but a quiet voice stopped him.
Fred gave an exaggerated sniff. “You’d better not.”
, so we’ll be taking him to Madam Pomfrey now, thank you,
Adrian nodded. “Let’s go, then. Coming, Farley?”
“It seems you knocked yourself out from magical exhaustion,” Madam Pomfrey told him. “Hardly surprising, considering Miss Farley’s telling of the events. You’ll be fine after some Pepper-Up potion. Your Head of House is delivering that now. Though honestly, fourth day of the year and already I’ve had two patients. Children!” she snorted.
“Why would he throw something at you?” Hermione asked from the door. Harry took a second to be thankful she and Tracey could put aside their arguing before he turned his attention back to the ghost – the ghost who was still far too close to him. He quietly took a step back.
Harry gave him a blank glance. “I remember everything. What’s through that door?”
“See you at breakfast, Harry,” Draco said, slightly sulkily.
Draco sneered at him in response. “Malfoy; Draco Malfoy. I don’t even need to ask for your surname. Red hair, and a hand-me-down robe? You must be a
“It was,” Neville told him. He seemed a touch more confident than usual – or maybe that was just his grin. “But we needed Nott to do the enchantment, because Hermione wouldn’t, and Zabini made Malfoy decorate.”
he cried, and as soon as the stone slab was in the air he wrenched it back towards the basilisk as hard as he could. The rock hit the creature’s skull with a sickening
“Did he say anything odd?” Hermione pressed. “Was he curious about Hogwarts?”
“The Heir of Slytherin. Surely you’ve read about this, Granger,” Blaise drawled. “Aren’t you
Gemma Farley made a noise of disgust and promptly dropped a book on his head. “Insensitive much, Harlow?”
“Why would Mr Potter go back to friends who don’t even write to him?”
“Hadrian Potter,” the centaur greeted him, tilting his head in acknowledgement. “You must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The Forest is not safe at this time – especially for you.”
Hagrid noticed him staring, and lifted the rooster a touch too close to Harry’s face.
Dumbledore hadn’t even gone up to the door. A quick, encouraging pat to Harry’s shoulder, he had wished Harry farewell and simply watched him approach the house. Harry wanted to scream at him. He wanted to kick and punch and drag the Headmaster into Number 4 so he could see exactly why Harry couldn’t stay in that awful place. And yet, even as the rage built in his blood and the drooping tulips on the lawn began to shake, the cooling suspicion washed over him that Dumbledore already knew. Perhaps not the extent of what went on behind the pristine suburban façade of the Dursley home, but he had spoken to Petunia at least once. He had to know that the Dursleys did not want Harry – had never wanted him, and had made that perfectly clear in Harry’s lifetime. Maybe, Harry had thought with hatred ashen in his mouth, Dumbledore just didn’t care.
“Oh no,” Longbottom whimpered.
“Oh be quiet, both of you,” Tracey rolled her eyes. “Honestly. Weren’t we talking about what Hadrian should do?”
say it was deadly.” And then he was gone, slipping through the Devil’s Snare easy as butter.
Draco nodded shortly. “Oh. Well, good. And if you break them, you know Blaise will help me hide your body. He wanted to make a written contract, you know, you’re lucky I’m settling for verbal agreement.” He eyed Harry suspiciously. “For now.”
“Then we go to Dumbledore,” Hermione suggested.
They stayed up all night talking. Harry learned quite a few new things about himself – like that he had a rare magical gift, and that he must apparently have a relation to Salazar Slytherin himself. He wasn’t sure how he felt about that but, as Theo reminded him (with perhaps a slightly pointed look at Daphne), one could not choose their heritage. Soon enough however, he had to sleep. He was exhausted – not to mention emotionally sapped – but it was with a smile on his face that he drifted into slumber.
Macmillan snorted. “That’s probably why You-Know-Who wanted to kill him in the first place. Didn’t want another Dark Lord competing with him.”
“Excellent. And you, boy?”
Finally, Blaise stood. “Talk to you later, Potter,” he said, and left.
“Not everyone’s like you, Granger,” Draco said, obviously trying very hard to keep his tone civil. Harry had made him promise, after all. “For most people, kids especially, saying ‘don’t go in there’ is like charming a spotlight on it with a sign that says ‘come on in’.”
“I’ve never met a snake who could speak English, either,” Harry said. “Maybe we’re special?”
“No need to apologise, Miss Farley,” Dumbledore held up a hand. “This mirror has ensnared many a witch and wizard, and you were simply looking out for your House member.”
The school stared at him blankly, all as one.
was his last thought before the lantern light went out with a quiet
quite fascinating. Have you read about it?”
,” Harry quoted absently, peering at a thick wooden door with iron studding across from him.
“I’m not a runaway,” Harry said absently, retrieving the letters from an impatient Hedwig and sorting through them. Every one of his friends had replied, much to his pleasure.
“And for good reason,” Millicent rolled her eyes. “The guy’s a fraud.”
“Nice big smile, Hadrian,” Lockhart said under his breath and through a smarmy grin. “Together, you and I rate the front page.”
“Only we couldn’t remember from where-”
“Well, what if I’m just fine watching too?”
Or rather, saviours, plural, because squinting into the dark gave Harry the dim vision of numerous silhouettes of people astride horses. Only, with the lack of light, it almost seemed like the horse and rider became one…
“Quick, up the stairs,” Harry urged.
“Say, Harry – do you think your friend could take a photo of me and you standing together? You know, to prove I’ve met you?”
“Like what?” Blaise stared him down, calm as ever. “Pansy’s right, Harry. There’s not a lot we can do. Or should do, even.”
The club dropped from the air and slammed into the troll’s head with a satisfying
“Alright,” Harry took a deep breath. “Shall we?”
“Guess so,” Draco huffed, for some reason making Daphne and Blaise share a sly smile.
Draco scowled at the nickname.
“Headmaster Dumbledore,” she said, as the old wizard came into view from behind Petunia. “I’m afraid Harry and I were merely stopping by for a moment. My son is still in Diagon Alley, you see, and Harry has books to buy.”
Millicent snorted. Sabre started at the sound, but soon went back to attacking the charmed string above him.
Draco snickered; Blaise smirked; Daphne giggled; and things went quite back to normal.
And promptly stopped.
“Drake?”
Adrian Pucey stared at him incredulously. “Of course I do. Don’t think I forgot our game last year – you’re going to be our new seeker, kid, I told you.”
“Yes,” Dumbledore tilted his head. “And no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge nor truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live.”
He watched with mounting horror as his Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, Cousin Dudley, and the visiting Masons all stared in shock at the snowy white owl carrying a mountain of letters and flying – in plain daylight – into the distance.
His cousin didn’t seem to notice. “It’s your birthday,” Dudley’s cruel smile widened. “And nobody cares.”
“Headmaster?” Harry pushed himself up in the bed, wincing slightly at the ache in his muscles.
Harry didn’t answer, because the door was suddenly opening to reveal the pinched, wide-eyed face of Petunia Dursley.
“Oh!”
“See you later,” Harry said, mustering up a smile.
Harry turned his attention back to the Slytherin Quidditch Captain. Marcus Flint was stalking down the line, inspecting the prospective players and taking down positions. One Chaser, Seeker, and two Beaters were needed to complete the line-up, and Flint appeared to be very serious about finding his perfect team. Flint wasn’t exactly known for his intelligence – there was even a rumour that he was part troll, which would certainly explain his massive, hulking stature. Harry thought he looked more like a Beater than a Chaser, but he had seen Flint play. He was deceptively fast in the air, and what he lacked in academic intelligence he made up with Quidditch strategy. He had also reached Harry in the line, and sneered down at him.
“Wonderful,” Draco muttered, panic lacing his voice.
And was promptly interrupted by a banging knock on the door. The rock cake he was holding dropped to the floor, but Draco was already tugging Harry into a corner and throwing the cloak back over them. Hagrid checked they were completely covered before picking up his crossbow with a swallow and aiming it at the door.
“Excuse me,” he whispered. “Hello?”
“Come on, Trace, just a little look!”
The twins happily took over keeping their wands trained on Lockhart while Harry approached the sink. He felt nervous, and not because he was willingly walking towards a Basilisk. He could feel the weight of his friends’ eyes on him, not to mention Ron and the twins and even Lockhart and Moaning Myrtle. The pressure was on him. If he couldn’t do this, maybe the Slytherins wouldn’t judge him but the Weasleys certainly would – it would be on him if something happened to Ginny because they couldn’t reach her. It would be on him if she died.
Harry swallowed. “So, you were just worried about me?”
Blaise and Draco were either side of him now, both worried. Draco rested one hand on his shoulder, feather-light.
“In the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously into our home,” Aunt Petunia said, sweeping into position.
“Of course,” he said. “Tomorrow, after Potions?”
“Who bloody cares,” grumbled Millicent, “When we still have to do Potions?”
When he turned back to Draco, the blond boy had his arms crossed and his gaze on the floor.
“Well,” Hermione huffed. “He definitely knows something.”
Harry was still numb when they settled in his dorm room, even the girls. Pansy holding his shoulder, uncharacteristically gently, was what finally broke into the fog in his head – the fog infecting his every thought with words he knew far too well, words like
Harry nodded.
“A memory,” Tom corrected. “Preserved in a diary for fifty years.”
Harry thought to himself.
“If we get killed, my ghost is going to kill your ghost all over again,” said Draco, and followed Harry into the dark.
then. But the only older students I know well enough are Gemma and Adrian, and I don’t think either of them are that stupid, do you?”
“Harry!” Hermione tore down the hallway the next day, bag shaking dangerously and hair flying wildly behind her. “Harry! I talked to Professor McGonagall, but Dumbledore’s gone! He was sent to London, the Ministry called him urgently!”
“Oh, Harry! We need to get you to Madam Pomfrey, come on-”
“To take it off your hands-”
“On this very fine-”
Harry noted the movement. That was developing into something very interesting.
Lockhart – slapped a hand down on Harry’s shoulder in enthusiastic greeting. Harry briefly considered hexing that hand with a particularly painful stinging jinx – but the consequences, unfortunately, would most likely outweigh the reward.
“This is out of my hands, Mr Potter,” said McGonagall, not unkindly. “Mr Filch, will you take care of this, please?”
“Are you going to tell me where that voice came from?” Harry asked, though he obeyed.
“Not you two,” groaned Lockhart.
Narcissa considered him carefully. “We must retrieve your school supplies, Hadrian, not to mention your wand.”
Draco did not look okay. He was, in fact, shaking.
“Exactly!” Harry sat up excitedly. “He’s the only one who can really tell us what happened!”
“Nice to meet you,” Harry said quietly.
“And very, very handsome,” Daphne finished for her, the same love-struck look in her eyes.
“Good evening, Hagrid,” Dumbledore greeted, solemn.
“I am in charge of Slytherin students, Poppy,” Snape glared at her. “I will choose how to discipline them.”
“Draco?” Harry called, dread filling his chest.
“No,” Millicent replied shortly. “His books are filled with mistakes – only half of it makes sense, and he’s so arrogant that even if it
“He said,
The first spell knocked the box onto its side, and Hagrid cried out in anguish as a tangle of pitch-black legs and glistening pincers scuttled out at high speed. Tom tracked the creature with his wand but before he could cast a final curse Hagrid had catapulted into him headfirst and the world was spinning and Harry was falling, falling, he was-
Harry wasted no time searching for the surname ‘Black’ in
“What?” asked Draco, finally standing from his sulk.
“Who’s Fluffy?” Neville and Harry asked at the same time.
Snape cocked his head like a snake ready to strike. “Weren’t you saying just last night that you’ve known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?”
Pansy snorted, but managed to disguise it as a cough. Myrtle glared at her, but continued.
Harry knocked. “Mr Hagrid?”
Harry knelt next to Justin, shock turning his limbs to lead, numbing his brain. Justin’s hand was ice cold. Tiny spiders scuttled past, moving as one up the wall and out through a crack in the stone.
Harry kept his eyes fixed firmly on the table, on the lines and scratches on the dark wood from many years of use.
“Potter?” a twin asked, eyebrows raising.
“Okay,” Harry said quietly. “That’s step one. Now for the trapdoor.”
“No, Harry, I don’t want to hear it! You can’t keep walking away from me – from, from Blaise and me, from all of us, into ridiculous danger like some tragic hero, and expect me to be okay with it! You promised you would be more careful, do you even remember?”
“Dobby!” Harry snapped, as quietly as he could. “What family do you serve?”
“Do we knock?” Hermione asked, nervous.
“Have they ever hurt you?”
“Nah,” Fred said, though they both shrugged. “Ron can be a git sometimes.”
“Ministry of Magic,” she called, and disappeared in a burst of green flame.
Harry was getting pretty sick of waking up in the Hospital Wing. Then he remembered that he shouldn’t have been waking up at all, and he felt rather like that was the least of his worries. Summoning his sapped strength, he tilted his aching head, very slowly and carefully, to one side.
After three heavy seconds, Blaise raised his hands in relent. “Fine. We bring the idiot.”
Lucius raised a brow. “Admirable sentiments. We shall all miss your highly individual way of running things, Albus, and only hope your successor will manage to prevent any more, ahem, killings.” He made a mocking bow in the direction of the door, and followed Dumbledore out with his head held high.
Quirrell tugged at the covering of the object, removing it without ceremony to reveal something very familiar – the Mirror of Erised. Seeing it, somehow, sent a stab of pain through Harry’s scar.
Harry held his gaze. “Why are you telling me this?”
Harry gasped. Unmistakeably, Dumbledore’s eyes trailed the wall of Hagrid’s cottage, stopping only when they fixed with his own.
The barkeep raised an eyebrow sceptically. “You’re telling me you have money? No offence, shortie, but you look like a runaway to me.”
?” Pansy said scathingly, spitting out the honorific and drawing herself up to her full – if unimpressive – height. “Everyone will know about this. I mean, for Morgana’s sake, is there anything you
“Harry-”
Harry has a chat with Neville Longbottom (and is unimpressed), and Hermione learns of the Cerberus.
Privately, Minerva thought Harry was handling this remarkably well for a child raised in a Muggle household, but Harry had had a lot of practice in not showing emotion (his cousin Dudley had taught him when he was quite young that crying got you nothing but more pain, and had since learned to keep his thoughts off his face. He did not tell the Professor this, but perhaps he didn’t have to – perhaps tattered clothes and nervous looks were enough. He was unaware that yes; they were).
Harry blinked at the change in topic. “I- of course I did.”
The letters glittered and moved over the surface of the cake, clearly enchanted, until the message was muddled and misspelled. Harry thought it was the most amazing thing he’d ever seen.
“What? Why?” Draco pulled away. “Harry, we need to go,
“I was talking to him just before that kid was found, it can’t have been him!”
Harry could barely focus on the memory – his mind was racing, trying to explain what Tom Riddle was showing him. It just couldn’t be true! Hagrid had frightened him initially, sure, but after getting to know him, it became clear that the groundskeeper wouldn’t hurt a fly. He had been kind to Harry and his friends; they’d all thought he was totally benevolent. They couldn’t all be wrong, surely?
, and quite enjoyed everything
Harry spun away from them, still frantic. “In the walls, the voice! I heard it in Lockhart’s office and then again just-”
Harry blinked. He got the feeling there was something very obvious he was missing.
Draco froze. Wide, frightened blue eyes locked on Harry, but Harry wasn’t looking. He was too busy trying to focus on the hulking shape moving towards them, accompanied by a sick, wet, clicking. He could hear the exact moment Draco turned enough to see the thing, however, because a sound came from the youngest Malfoy’s throat he was sure he had never heard before, halfway between choking terror and a cut-off shout.
“You’re smart, Potter, but you’re not invincible. You’re only a first year, just like the rest of us.”
“Alright,” he said, a smile just starting to tug at his lips. “Let’s go flying. Oh, and Blaise – you know you can call me Harry, right?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Fred – Harry was fairly certain this one had called the other George, so he decided to just roll with it – shook his head.
“I- I don’t know the counter spell!”
“Of course, my boy. I was simply concerned you would be upset about the ordeal, or guilty about the creature’s demise, but it’s understandable that Ginny was your first priority.”
“What do you want,” she said. It wasn’t a question.
Weasley let out a choked laugh. “Yeah, like any Slytherin would be friends with a muggle-born.”
“Give me the remembrall, Malfoy,” Weasley said, lip curled in a poor attempt at being threatening. “Or I’ll take it back.”
Daphne nodded, though her eyes were closed. “We are meant to be successful. It is not our way to be loving. Or, it’s not meant to be.”
Harry set his jaw. “We’ll just have to keep working in his stead, then.”
“How’d you know we were here?” he heard Hermione ask from behind him. Her voice was shaky and small.
“Mr Potter! I’m getting quite sick of seeing you in here.”
Harry read through each of his letters, holding them close and realising with a surge of alarm that he had left not just his other letters (which were more precious to him than nearly anything) but also his wand.
“How’s it going, Hadrian,” said one twin. Harry thought it was probably George – there were tiny differences, he was certain – but he couldn’t quite differentiate the two, particularly not in the dim torchlight of the corridor.
“What is the Mirror of Erised?” Harry asked, struggling to keep his gaze from the mirror.
“Then why save us?” Harry asked.
Harry shrugged. “It’d be worth it. We needed to know more about the Chamber.”
The wraith shifted towards them;
“Arabella Winters, first year, half-blood, quickly giving herself a reputation as a Gryffindor wannabe.”
Hagrid shrugged. “Dunno, ‘is ‘ood was covering ‘is face.”
Her frown deepened. “Perhaps Bulstrode was right about him.”
The last thing his tired mind processed was,
Adrian immediately looked far more interested in the Malfoy heir than he had previously, and nodded. “I expect to see you there, too, then.”
“Still – he might know something. Come on, guys,” she glanced between them, uncharacteristically serious. “Harry’s right. We need to do something,
“Of course not!” Draco huffed. “Honestly, he’s a
A huge, black, mass began to move.
“Harry!”
Quirrell turned and started forward, hands outstretched. Harry shoved the Mirror, knocking it into the parasite. It teetered dangerously, nearly falling, but Harry wasn’t watching because it hadn’t slowed Quirrell for long, in fact, in just seconds Quirrell’s hands were up to him, were on his throat, and he was falling to the ground and he couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t
Draco sighed. “Okay. I’ll be back in a second, Harry.”
Narcissa placed a hand protectively on Harry and Draco’s backs and guided them out of the hallway with quick steps – unfortunately, because this was Harry’s life and nothing ever went smoothly, they only made it a few feet into the main corridor.
“Parseltongue?” suggested Ron. “It’s all snake-stuff, and if Salazar Slytherin never wanted anyone but him and his kids to be able to open it…”
“You don’t have to, Neville,” Hermione put a hand on his arm.
“Blaise, are you serious?” Draco cried. “You’re just going to let him walk into danger?”
“Are you sure?”
“Obviously,” Draco drawled.
Blaise turned to Tracey. “You
Draco came back into the room, then, three cups of tea balanced carefully in his hands, and Harry put back on a smile.
idiots.” He gestured at Vince and Greg, who were napping in their chairs, mouths open and leaking drool.
Another third year question. Harry had only glanced this information, but it was enough.
A choked sound made its way out of Draco’s throat. It may have been ‘father’ – Harry can’t really tell. He’s more concerned with the way Draco’s nails dig into the back of his hand as the boy shakes his head.
“Acromantula,” Draco breathed.
“Professor, I-”
Harry shook his head. He didn’t really want to deal with Hagrid right now. “It’s nothing, just stress. Speaking of, I’d better get back to studying, so…”
With that, Gilderoy Lockhart drew his wand, a charm already falling from his lips-
“That’s very good advice, Professor,” said Harry. He couldn’t quite bring himself to say ‘thank you’.
“But I don’t understand-”
“Yeah, Harry?”
“Wait, Draco,” Harry put a hand on his arm. He sent a placating look at his friends, and turned to the youngest male Weasley. “Look, I don’t really care if you think I’m the Heir of Slytherin or not. I don’t even care about how evil you think Slytherins are. All I know is that you have a choice to make, because I’m not going to sit here and let an innocent girl get killed. You can hate us, or you can come with us, because we’re going after Ginny. We’re going into the Chamber.”
Pansy raised one eyebrow. “Scared of spiders, Millie?”
“I didn’t take
“Shut up.”
Harry felt as if he had been the one Petrified, but something in him was stirring. He couldn’t let this pass. Whatever the beast in the Chamber was, whoever had set it free – they wouldn’t stand a chance. He was young and inexperienced but he had learned his power since coming to Hogwarts. He was strong enough – angry enough – to do this.
“We’re hardly late, Adrienna,” Narcissa replied primly, and air-kissed Lady Zabini’s cheeks.
“Yes, yes!” Hagrid replied, a touch too quickly, fidgeting with his oven gloves. “Now, listen. I wanted to show ye something, alrigh’?”
Neville was swaying dangerously on Harry’s right.
Millicent scoffed from beside the fire, but Draco was too excited to care, and a glare from Harry made her mime zipping her lips.
appreciate.
,” Hermione Granger was saying to the highly uninterested and slightly sick looking girl on her left.
I'm sorry about the lack of updates guys! My formal external exams have just started, and I'm a bit of a mess of stress :( Unfortunately, these slow updates will be continuing (or perhaps even zero updates) for the next two and a half weeks or so as my exams continue. However! My last exam is on the afternoon of November 18th, so after that we should be back to regular upload time! I hope you can forgive me for now :( Thank you all for sticking with me! <3
“Yes and no,” Daphne said, flipping her hair back with a frustrated sigh. “Arabella Winters is stupidly ordinary and nowhere near as afraid of the things she should be. I don’t know what Astoria sees in her.”
“Doubtful,” said Blaise. “Every story about the Chamber of Secrets talks about Salazar’s beast, singular.”
“Obviously,” Blaise drawled.
“C’mon, Aragog. Gotta get you outta here… C’mon now, in the box…”
“Gotta ‘ave a name, don’t ‘e?” Hagrid grinned.
“Harry.”
“My name is Professor Minerva McGonagall,” said the woman. “I’m here about your letter.”
Harry raised both eyebrows incredulously. “
“Oh, Merlin, oh no oh no oh no.” Draco was beginning to hyperventilate, struggling against the plant as it tightened and tightened.
was sorted into Slytherin after very little time beneath the Sorting Hat. The tiny girl seemed even tinier walking the length of the Great Hall to the Slytherin table, and even Harry felt a little reassured once Astoria was safely at her sister’s side. Daphne herself calmed immediately.
“You must have.” Narcissa smiled, then, polite and indulgent – but to Harry it just looked triumphant. “So you see, Headmaster? Just a misunderstanding. Harry and I ought to be going, really, once we collect his things. Do forgive our haste – I dislike leaving Draco for too long.”
“So?”
“So,” Pansy clapped her hands together in excitement. “What’s this about the Chamber?”
Draco had gone stiff as a board to Harry’s side. Slowly, and as subtly as possible, Harry shifted one knee to press against Draco’s. The other boy made no visible response, but Harry still hoped he had helped in some way.
“Harry has no idea, does he?” said Hermione, softly.
Was this, then, the ‘distasteful’ answer Narcissa had said he would find? Were she and the murderer out for Harry’s blood related? Yet, why was there no Sirius Black on the family tree?
“Wait- Hadrian.”
“Millicent!” Daphne sounded scandalised. “What was that?”
Lockhart snapped his gaze up to look at them, sending his usually perfect golden curls flying over his eyes. “What are you doing here?”
Fitting both him and Draco beneath Harry’s invisibility cloak proved to be a slight challenge. They had to squish together, and twice just getting out of the dorm he stepped on Draco’s foot. They got into the swing of it eventually however, and made it out of the castle without a hitch - although Draco seemed remarkably flushed the whole way.
Ginny didn’t stop to look at them, let alone apologise, speeding away down the corridor.
Harry didn’t quite know what to say. “Uh. You’re welcome?”
Harry blinked. “What?”
“Not a spider. Acromantula,” said Theo.
“You failed, though,” Harry said, clenching his jaw. “The Mandrake Draught will heal the petrified and you’ll still be stuck down here.”
“I trust you four understand the trouble you’re in?” Professor McGonagall said.
Harry immediately went to say yes – after all, he had never forgotten a thing in his life – but found his usually perfect recollection oddly fuzzy.
“Mrs Norris,” Blaise finished solemnly. “That’s Mrs Norris.”
Fred and George were hovering over Ginny in Harry’s peripheral vision, casting spell after spell on first her, then the diary. Tom didn’t seem concerned.
On this walk, Hadrian Potter and Minerva McGonagall discussed many things. Minerva was not one to hold back from the truth, and so she rather frankly told Harry about his parents’ deaths at the hand of the Dark Lord Voldemort; of the basic wizarding world; of Harry’s fame; and of course, of Hogwarts.
“I can help with that – if you’d like,” Hermione said suddenly, all in a rush.
By the time the Chamber finally came to a standstill many minutes later, Harry could hear choked coughs from all around as the small group recuperated, all of them inhaling dust and thick, muck-filled air. Oxygen felt uncomfortably warm and humid on its path to Harry’s lungs but he drew in breaths anyway. The collapse felt as if it had taken all the energy from his body, and his bones still felt like they were shaking with the shocks.
“Well then-”
Gemma gave him a quick smile.
“Really big. Like, dog sized.”
Harry slept all the way through that night, and dreamed of swimming in the Black Lake with creatures he could not name.
“You have nothing to be sorry for, you dolt.”
Side note: y'all ever find it kinda messed up that Harry and Ron full on could have murdered Lockhart? Like, when they pushed him down the hole into the Chamber? I'd never really thought about it until I wrote this chapter but.... god damn.

“It was my word against Hagrid’s. Only Dumbledore seemed to think Hagrid was innocent – but it wasn’t enough. I knew it wouldn’t be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school, so I decided to leave behind a diary. I preserved my sixteen year old self in its pages, so that one day I would lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin’s noble work.”
Norbert sneezed, and a puff of flame blew from his nostrils. A few embers caught in Hagrid’s beard, but he simply patted them out with a chuckle.
Harry remembered Lily Potter’s face. He remembered her green eyes, and her soft red hair beneath his fingertips. He remembered her voice cooing his own name at him. He remembered her scream as she died.
with Cornish pixies?” Draco replied sarcastically. He picked at his robes, annoyed. “That bloody incompetent fool.”
“Why would they do that?”
There was a spark of fear in Weasley’s eyes. Harry let the triumph that spark made him feel curl his lips into a cold smile.
“Yes, Professor,” Tom was saying. “I suppose I- I just had to see for myself if… if the rumours were true.” He glanced back down the hall, but the stretcher had moved on.
“Damn, Daph,” Pansy commented admiringly. “That stuff never works with me.”
“Harry!”
“Mr Potter, Mr Longbottom,” Snape addressed them, for once not sneering quite as much. “The two of you are required.”
– was a familiar black diary, and above it a form was shimmering into view. When it finally became distinctive, he wasn’t entirely surprised by the face staring dispassionately down at the three Weasleys.
“Oh, and that’s Vince and Greg,” Draco added dismissively, once he had finished his introductions.
Harry gave him a smile. “Yes, boss.”
“I- I’m alright. I’m alright.”
Harry smiled at their bickering, before turning to the rest of the group. “Time to go, I think.”
,” he commanded the basilisk, and Harry began to run.
“How do you know my friends haven’t been writing me?” Harry asked as calmly as he could.
Theodore’s face was as blank as usual. “He’s our new Defence teacher.”
Draco frowned. “No. You?”
Daphne made a disgusted sound in the back of her throat. “With a

twins a favour, for Merlin’s sake. They’ll get you to do something horrible. We should tell Professor Snape.”
“Yes,” Draco agreed. “We were talking about how he should tell Hagrid to leave him alone.”
Millicent immediately set off in a tirade, leaving Tracey to try and separate them while the others watched: Blaise and Daphne in amusement, and Neville and Hermione in concern. Theo took the opportunity to come up and pat Harry on the back in his own silent form of congratulations, before making his way over to Hermione’s side.
His eyes had fallen, quite perfectly, atop the name ‘Sirius Black’.
Lucius’ smile spread. His teeth flashed, predator-like; triumphant. “Dreadful thing, Dumbledore,” he drawled, so like Draco’s own cocky inflection but so much worse. “But the governors feel it’s time for you to step aside. This is an Order of Suspension.” He passed a scroll to Fudge with one gloved hand. “You’ll find all twelve signatures on it. I’m afraid we feel you’re losing your touch. What with all these attacks, there’ll be no Muggleborns left at Hogwarts. And we all know what an awful loss that would be.”
“Where is he?” Draco asked, tugging Harry up off the ground with a clenched grip on his hand. “He’s a friend, of us and of Hagrid.”
“No one should go forward alone,” Hermione agreed, biting her lip. “It wouldn’t be safe.”
“I’ll talk to Professor McGonagall,” Hermione said firmly. “She’s the deputy headmistress – she can get us to see Dumbledore.”
“Who first?” asked Draco.
Alternatively: Snape is an asshole.
“Maybe you did. Everyone’s saying you’re the Heir of Slytherin anyway, Potter.”
“Who is it the monster has taken, Minerva?” Professor Sprout asked anxiously, rubbing soil-stained hands on her apron.
Only the basilisk hadn’t stopped, and its gaping jaw latched around Harry’s raised arm. Harry screamed and dropped to his knees; there was so much pain, one or maybe more of the creature’s fangs had lodged themselves in his flesh and the venom on its teeth
he shouted, but Tom only laughed again.
Halfway through lunch, Hermione and Theo arrived – together – to walk to their respective tables. Most of the school stared at a Slytherin and a Muggleborn walking alongside each other, but if either of them cared, they didn’t show it. Theo settled in opposite Harry (who was as far from Daphne as he could get), unsurprisingly non-expressive.
Blaise laughed. “Jealous, Draco?”
“Guys! Play nice,” Tracey glared at them both, before turning a gentle smile on Harry. “How’re you doing, Hadrian? Draco and Blaise told us what happened.”
Millicent shoved her off the couch.
“It’s no problem, Hadrian,” Tracey interrupted. “Really.”
After marking the convict’s name with a stray piece of tape, Harry moved on to
But that’s not where it ended. Behind them were his friends, everyone from his life that he considered even remotely close to him. They crowded together, so many that it seemed there was no way they could all fit in the reflection, but still they did. Amongst the familiar faces were people with blurred masks covering their features. Harry wondered who they were supposed to be, but only absently. He was too busy staring at his mother’s gently smiling face.
Several things happened in quick succession, then:
“Good idea,” Tracey said, rubbing her forehead, before leading them out into the Alley.
“The Philosopher’s Stone,” Blaise finished. “The Elixir of Life.”
to disarm. We don’t want any accidents.”
“Wait, there’s more?”
“We’re here to ask how you died, if that’s alright.”
“Hadrian, step away from there.”
“Only if Astoria can come,” replied Daphne. “I’m not letting her out of my sight. Not like her Hufflepuff bestie is going to do much to protect her.”
“Harry!” Hermione admonished. “You promised not to tell anyone!”
Daphne smiled back, and the tension dissipated.
Harry shook his head. “It’s that voice again… but it’s gone.”
life.”
“Yep,” Harry nodded.
“Shh!” Madam Pince hissed.
Harry sighed. “So as it is – no new leads.”
Blaise looked at him a moment longer, before nodding. “Alright. You need to learn to control your face.”
And then there was Draco. Draco hadn’t let go of Harry’s hand since they left the bathroom, and from the way he was clinging to Harry’s side it seemed he had no intentions of letting go any time soon. Harry got the feeling he would remain that way for the next few days – and, surprising himself, found that he didn’t quite mind that thought.
“To be fair,” Harry pointed out, “I didn’t walk into danger alone this time.”
“But Hermione!” Longbottom was saying, still pulling on the sleeve of Harry’s cloak.
Wisely, Ginny retreated without comment. She managed one last forlorn look at Harry before the curtain around Harry’s own bed snapped shut.
“Thanks,” Harry told her, genuinely. “I haven’t read about that spell yet.”
“Oh, leave it alone, Daphne,” Blaise said, rolling his eyes again.
“Heart of a lion, this one,” Ron rolled his eyes. The comment startled a laugh out of Harry – which seemed to shock Ron even more than it did himself.
Harry almost couldn’t get the words out as he looked around and realised that in the time Hermione had been attempting to strangle him to death – though it was very welcome – he had been entirely encircled by his friends. Theo stood scant inches from Hermione, with one hand, Harry noticed, poised ready to catch her should she fall from her rather precarious spot on Harry’s bed; then Daphne, her arm linked with Pansy’s, whose other hand was gripping tightly to Millicent; then Neville and a tearful Tracey; then Blaise, who shockingly enough was standing in front of a very awkward looking Ron Weasley; and then Draco. Draco, who stood as close to Harry’s bedside as he could manage with Hermione still half on top of him. Draco, whose eyes were just a little red around the waterline. Draco, who grasped Harry’s free hand from his side and held so tightly that it was both comfort and slightly painful. Draco, who leaned in very close once Hermione had collected herself enough to remove herself from Harry and was busy embarrassedly brushing her robes free of lint, and said with a voice thick with quiet fear, “You have to stop leaving me behind.”
The rest of the world didn’t seem to care about their unspoken pact of silence, however.
In the end, it was Harry’s own respect for the Lady Malfoy that led him to not open the letter. She had asked him not to, after all, and he couldn’t bear to imagine having the depths of Narcissa’s disappointment directed his way. Still, something told him it was best to get the letter delivered quickly. A glance outside revealed the sun had risen into the sky. Petunia would almost certainly be awake, making breakfast for her family – Harry, of course, not included.
“Now, ‘ow do you lo’ know abou’ Fluffy?”
While in the Hospital Wing the Malfoy heir was grappling with a decision that would have waves of influence upon the years to come, far down below, in an abandoned classroom not far from the entrance to the Slytherin dungeons, guarded with the best privacy charms a group of second years could know, an equally important decision was being made. A group of students who had just the right amount of love for their friend combined with just the right variety of dangerous and political upbringings were having a meeting.
“Shouldn’t you be with your prefects?” Harry asked. His voice sounded absurdly relaxed to his own ears. Perhaps he was getting better at his mask after all.
His tone left very little doubt on Lucius’ belief in that statement.
“The Forbidden Forest?” Draco groaned. “Really?”
“Atta boy, Neville,” said the twins.
Harry hadn’t brought anything. He didn’t know what to bring – there was nothing he could give them that would be enough aside from solving the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets.
Harry shifted uncomfortably, but nodded.
“And if he’s dangerous?” asked Blaise, pointedly.
Harry wondered.
“Watch it,” glared Pansy.
Tom shook his head. “Monsters don’t make good pets, Hagrid. Now, stand aside.” He lifted his wand, aiming directly at the box – the box which seemed to be… clicking?
This time, Harry could feel the tingling from earlier, and with a sudden rush in his chest akin to the feeling of exhaling a large amount of air all at once, there was an unlit candle lying in front of him.
“Absolutely not!” Draco exclaimed.
“Gemma?”
“I promise, Narcissa,” said Harry, forcing back the emotion clogging his throat. Narcissa had been nothing but kind in the time he had been allowed in her home, and he was forever grateful to her, but the sensation of a gentle, motherly figure still overwhelmed him sometimes. He had no idea how Draco accepted her affections so easily – he might have been jealous, if he hadn’t seen himself how dearly Draco loved his mother as much as she doted on him.
“See? Sensible,” Tracey said triumphantly.
“Oh great deduction, Weasley, because no one else ever has ever been a Parseltongue in the history of wizardkind-”
Tom laughed. He blurred a little less when he moved now, or was that Harry’s imagination?
