“What?” harry asked, looking himself over. His side and bed was covered in white fur. He raised an eyebrow.
“Just trust me.. I’m going to speed her up now yeah? Three.. two.. one.. Come on Amour.” He clicked his tongue and Amour sped up into a simple trot.
“None I’ve noticed. Dad and I have been practicing defensive and shield charms all summer. We did one before leaving this morning and I think it’s still holding up.”
Warning, Mentions of PTSD and nightmares in the beginning of this. I did some research for this one but it is not entirely accurate. please do not take the advice given for truth and do your own research, this is just "What draco knows of it".
He did as told. Amour going back to walk with ease. He felt incredibly giddy. “I actually did it!” he called.
“… and so I will sentence Narcissa Malfoy nee Black to 5 years of probations. As well as a year of house arrest. Weekly checkups will be done and 10 percent of the Malfoy fortunes will be put to Charity work. Her wand shall be returned in 6 months.” He looked at his mother. She was sobbing. He gave her a weak smile. She deserved that.. she deserved her freedom. She hadn’t always been a good mother. But he knew she cared.
She smiled, taking his hand from his side now. He let her drag him to the dance floor again, the spelled instruments we playing a soft rather upbeat song, it frankly fit Luna perfectly (Merry go round from howls castle incase anyone is wondering, its such a lovely song and it literally sounds like fucking magic).
He would have to fix this.. he couldn’t stand Harry feeling like shit. “.. And with how I’m feeling while I still have my best friends even if it doesn’t one hundred percent feel like it.. how must he feel? The whole world seems to be as much against him as much as they support me. I hate everything so much.” Potter sobbed. Selfless as ever, if he had been able to cry. He would have. This boy deserved the world. He was kind, to kind. He felt worse and worse for ever being horrible to the boy who lived. He regretted it. The person who he had been. Perhaps.. even if he didn’t deserve this. He should put more effort into Harry. If it would make him happy he would smile for him more.. he could do that.
“It’s fine Malfoy. It makes sense don’t it. We would make very unlikely friends.” Potter didn’t sound disgusted. He was open to talk and for friendship.
They walked into the great hall like that. t was decorated as per usual, the tables were already pushed to the sides however and instead of the benches there were chairs. Harry led them up to where the others were sitting, even pulling out a chair for him. Draco snorted. “Such a gentleman Harry. I’m truly impressed.” He chuckled lightly. Ignoring the glae he was getting from Weasley. Said glare quickly disappearing as Hermoine appeared in the door. The invisibility cloak shoved in the small purse she’d brought
Harry watched him closely. This was a new look on Draco… sad, drunk and pouting. He felt bad having to pull away, but it was freezing out and without a coat.. he didn’t want to get sick, seeing how Draco felt bad about everything already.. he couldn’t bare even thinking of the guilt he’d feel if Harry got sick for lending him his coat.
Despite his best efforts he couldn’t catch his sleep. Mind running wild with thoughts of self- doubt and hatred. His body was tired. So bloody tired. But his head wouldn’t stop picking him apart. His grumbled he tossed and he turned. Eventually settling for spelling his bed to look like he was fast asleep in it, complete with soft snores and all and turning into the snow leopard once more. Perhaps some cold autumn air and a walk around the grounds would help him.
“There you are. Merlin what the fuck happened.. Harry passed out the moment we got back to the dorms after dinner.” Neville started.
Soon enough they put on the saddle, bridle and tightened the girth. Harry handed Draco a helmet but he refused to put it on. “You promised me I won’t fall and I trust you on that. I’m not ruining my hair.” To which he’d been called a git.
“Any time potter.” He gave him a kind little smile, remembering how broken the other had seemed. He shouldn’t be ashamed about waking up practically cuddling with another guy. Harry had needed it and lets be fair. He himself was touch starved and he hadn’t minded it much. What he did mind was the fact it yet again felt so damn natural. So domestic and.. good.
Shortly after the war had passed Draco and his parents had been arrested. They had been put into cells awaiting a trail… Draco was surprised he even got a trail. From what he heard Theo’s father had been put into prison right away. Goyle was is St. Mungo’s. He had lost his mind completely after what had all happened.
He stood in front of his bed. Groaning loudly when he realised he’d have to get out of these clothes.
“It’s fine. We were drunk as all hell. I should’ve gone to the bathroom to change.” Draco interrupted. “Please forget about it alright? Let’s not make things awkward. It’s in the past. I don’t hold it against you. You shouldn’t hold it against you either.”
He preformed some tests, putting a little jam on the plate and pushing it back to see if it rippled. He had to boil it down for about 10 extra minutes.
“Three broomsticks!” Ron called. Leading the group with Finnigan and Thomas on his heels. The rest of them followed not far behind.
Weasley had taken it upon himself to defeat and educate everyone in chess. He was smiling more. Rivers poked fun at him from time to time but it worked. They got along fine. They were masterful thieves too when it came to getting alcohol.
Draco nodded slowly, grabbing the halter and lead, leading her to the brushing station and getting her ready. There were probably spells for brushing her but he liked doing it by hand.
They’d concluded their horse hangout and sporting with a fight over the shower and getting ready for class. The rest of the day being rather uneventful.
“Excuse me. Aren’t you supposed to be the brave Gryffindor out of us three.” Pansy uttered, slightly flustered.
“Of course not.” He replied, looking away from the others in the room and taking a small bite. It was still warm thankfully. “It’s fine. I’m fine now.” He ignored the sigh leaving Hermoine.
He heard potter laugh in between his panting. “Final one. Come on. We’re just behind them.” He called.
“What is that supposed to mean?!” he hissed, louder than he should have, earning a glare from Slughorn. Pansy just gave him a sly smirk. Moving the conversation to something else.
“fine, pull me up then.” He held up his hand, Draco took it, pulling harry behind him. His face flushing slightly at the closeness of it all. “Hand me the reigns.” He felt a pair of arms wrap around his waist and a warm chest press against his back… the worst of it was the breaths against his neck. he had to do everything to keep himself from squirming and making things more awkward. He handed the reigns over nonetheless.
“Wasn’t my intention if that’s what you’re wondering. I just tripped over my own feet. The workout must have made me tired. I passed out in an abandoned corridor and Blaise found me.”
“I’m afraid Poppy wants to keep you at least tonight. You had a pretty nasty  concussion.” She didn’t seem convinced of their deal entirely.
“I’m not sure..” He whispered, mood souring a little. Of course he’d love to go. But he was afraid of an attack.
Dinner went quite alright. McGonagall’s threat seemed to have worked. No spells were thrown his way over dinner. Draco managed to eat at least something.. though it was mostly deserts that Pansy shoved onto his plate.. such a mom.
Today was Friday. Their first Pagan class. A whole 2 hours. Knowing he’d probably have to sit with his roommate. So without asking he plopped his bag next to Draco.
It send a strange warmth through him. Potter looking out for him huh… that was a nice change. Potter willing to state he wants to be friends. It warmed him through. It made him feel safe, even if it might just be a loose promise.
The song for this chapter was most definetly Raise hell by DOROTHY. I found it a few days ago and I've been loving it.
Draco watched him, he couldn’t quite put his finger on Harry anymore. He was being nice, a bit too nice perhaps but Draco found he didn’t mind, he was growing rather attached to the savior of the wizarding world. He was much different than Draco had always thought him to be. He wasn’t arrogant, a slimy git that used his name to get everything. He was kind, wanted to help those around him. Pretty much selfless. Perhaps Draco could teach him a thing or two about allowing himself to ask for things for himself too.
Draco stared at him blankly. “fell down a flight of stairs. I lost my balance.” Longbottom seemed taken aback. “Don’t bother asking... Potter.. a word?” he looked at Potter, who hadn’t said anything so far but looked like he was about to give him a rant.
“It’s no longer offering. We’re going shopping.” Draco smirked. He had been forced to take styling lessons as a child and to be honest it was one of the few classes he was thankful for. Very useful. “We might need Blaise, he’s an expert too. We’ll make you shine on Samhain and absolutely blinding on Yule. Weasley would be an idiot not to drop at your feet with a ring.” Draco smirked, flopping back down in his previous spot.
“That’s not what I meant and you know that.” he tried to will down the blood rushing to his cheeks. “I.. I owe you remember.” He muttered.
“Deal Potter.” He sipped his chocolate. “Why are you so focused on winning?” he blurted out. Trying to hide the fact that whatever Potter did to the hot chocolate.. had made it taste like heaven. 10/10 rating, better that Pips even.
“That one. He.. escaped. Over the summer I’ve visited a farm where he went to live with other Griffins. I learned how to ride there. I just.. needed to get my mind off of things you know? finding new hobbies and such. I’m in no way a professional. But I know how to stay on.”
There was a loud banging in the door. “Draco are you fucking done?? I still need to change and we have like an hour!” harry called, barging in.
Sighing he closed his own curtains, downing his sleeping draught. He didn’t have a lot of vails, but he was certain he could find a way to make himself more.
“you really picked a project and a half to save this time Potter.” Blaise started. “But.. I’m not going to deny you’re likely the only chance Draco Malfoy has at a redemption. So I’m going to tell you this for his sake.” he stayed silent for a moment. Looking for the right words. “as you know he never wanted to be part of he whole dark lord business. But it doesn’t take away years of indoctrination. It doesn’t take away years of doing horrible things. That boy has seen a lot… he refuses any help he can get because he feels undeserving. There’s more behind the asshole mask he puts up.”
“Neville have you seen his coat? He can’t go out like this..” Draco wasn’t really following the conversation. He was making an attempt at getting up really. He heard some stuff about him losing his coat before warm fabric was draped over his shoulders.
Draco just hummed in reply. Disappearing into the shower attached to their dorm. Wondering if he could get away with transforming it into a bath and dozing off in it… probably not worth the effort. Besides he had to save some magic to finish his charms homework. He couldn’t afford a nap.
Draco did as told, a shiver running through him as he did so. The horse seemed rather unfazed. Moving to nuzzle Draco who yelped loudly. His face flushing in embarrassment.
“That’s what it does to you.. do you wanna go back?” Harry asked, helping him to his feet and brushing him off.
Draco nodded. Letting Harry move his hands. Why was it so hard to breathe when Potter was close? He moved his focus from the others face to their hands. Relaxing and trying to conjure his core.
“You’re telling me you’ve never you know.. put on shite music and danced to it with your friends? You’re disappointing me Draco.” Harry teased, hitting his shoulder playfully. Since when did they do that? “Don’t worry. I’ll lead.” Draco could sense his smirk.
“Too late. Lets go see her.” Harry was already standing over him, holding out a hand which Draco reluctantly took to be pulled up. letting himself get dragged back to the field of horses. This time the patting part went better, mostly because Amour seemed to be a rather calm horse.
“You deserve to be here. You know that right? Don’t die on me. I can’t stand anymore death around me.” His voice hitched. There were tears on the brim of falling.
Potter dramatically walked around him. Pointing at him with the words. Draco just flushed and looked confused. Folding his arms across his chest in embarrassment. At least he was until the words “… but I want it that way..” played, dramatically mouthed by Harry and sung by half the pub.
They made their way to the kitchen. there were no rules against asking the elves for tea outside of tea time. Draco was however a tad surprised to find Pip running up to him, holding her hands out for a hug.
Potter shot him a glance. He was in for more questioning later… Draco would just have to pretend to be asleep then.
He couldn’t quite keep his head with his current book. Today it was a play written by Terry Pratchett called good omens. Something about the muggle god and devil and their angels guiding someone called the antichrist? It was honestly confusing him a bit too much but he would ask Hermoine later.
His eyes widened and his jaw dropped nearly. Standing up as he looked at Hermoine. Harry nudged Draco, leaning in and whispering into his ear. “I think he likes it.”
“Oh come on Ron. Leave it.” Potter’s voice came from the door. He looked at them rather sad. “He’s trying to help you. you have to calm down a little. I know you’re upset about the rooming situation. But fighting constantly isn’t going to make it better.” He put a hand on Weasley’s shoulder. Who suddenly looked really tired. “Lets get you cleaned up. 	Oliver.. you can use our shower aight?  Don’t take it to heart.” Rivers shrugged.
“The.. the what? Malfoy you think that’s what I’m worried about? You looked on the verge of death yesterday..” Harry walked closer. “Don’t go wandering alone again aight mate? I’ll find who’s done this..”
“That’s how its supposed to be! You’re an uncultured swine for never having heard of the backstreet boys or Abba. They are the best.” Potter fake glared at him.
About 15 minutes and several more attacks later. They were through. Panting and slightly panicked. The panic soon turned into laughter however. They made it through. They hadn’t cast anything horrible and.. made their best time yet!
“I’m sorry..” He mumbled, stumbling over his own feet. “You kept disappearing. Why’d you leave me alone?” he asked quietly.
He felt grateful, having talked to her. He felt a little better after his whole moral debacle on whether it was alright for him to be around Harry as much as he was…
“Draco. You’ve been sat here for three hours and I know you’re not enjoying this book. When you’re distracted you forget to control your expression and I can see you cringe. Come on.”
They walked to breakfast together but split up quite soon to sit with their own friends. Overall it was nice. There was some chat about the ball and excitement for class. Mostly Hermoine who was loudly questioning some of the other purebloods about how wizarding cooking was different from muggle cooking.
“Oh that sounds like fun! I honestly love it despite..” he paused. “Maybe we could exchange recipies. I never quite get bread right. Something about being impatient.” Harry joked. Deciding it was time to get up too. “Wanna work together for this class then?”
Harry, still looking a bit dazed and confused nodded sheepishly. “Yeah.. err.. thanks.” He muttered, his morning voice was deeper than usual and it made Draco’s stomach flip a little. He nodded curtly before gathering his stuff and speeding towards the shower. feeling a little embarrassed by it all.
He heard footsteps and a huff as potter sat down. Great now he got to look as Draco was send to Azkaban. that’s what he got for trying to stand up for something as hideous as him.
He ate the bread. It felt heavy in his stomach. He wasn’t used to eating both lunch and a somewhat of a dinner.
“I just remembered, there’s something I have to get from the library.. Can you take my bags? I’ll meet you in a bit.” Draco asked, holding his bags out to the two of them.
He flushed, looking away, things popping into his mind that probably shouldn’t. he wasn’t gay after all.
I want everyone to keep in mind that this is a work of FAN fiction. It's diverging from canon. There are going to be inconsistencies with the main story.  That's all. If you want to leave a comment please try to be a little positive or offer genuine criteria. Not just that my story isn't accurate.
When he finally let go he looked around. his eyes meeting with Kingsley’s, who gave him a smile. It wasn’t warm.. it was encouraging. He knew what would wait outside the doors of the ministry court. He knew life wouldn’t be easy for the two of them. But he stood behind his decision. He had gifted all the children involved with the war a free pass. Most of them had no choice but to follow their parents... Hogwarts would be busy this year. But it was for the best.
“They are.” He hummed in reply, holding him back carelessly. “Do you still want to talk or do you want to sleep?”
“I believe I do… Malfoy.” Draco returned the curt nod he got from Ron. At least the other acknowledged him. Which was better than the balled fists and near punches of their previous interactions. The smile the other wore didn’t seem forced.. perhaps tonight it was ok to burry the hatched.
Surprisingly were Longbottom and Daphne, chatting happily together. Draco would Question her on that later.
By the time Draco came out in his uniform, Blaise and Pansy were back. They looked even more battered than he had been. “She’s the devil. Anderson had to stop her on the fifth try… I’m so tired Draco..” Pansy cried, attempting to hug him, he quickly stepped aside. Not willing to get mud on his clean outfit.
He woke up late. Nearly 9am. Potter seemed to have already left. Seemingly the contract didn’t work when one of them didn’t realize the other was right there. He didn’t give himself time to wake up properly. He sped out of the room as fast as he could muster. Making his way, luckily avoiding any students, over to the infirmary where he turned back. Knocking weakly on the door. Turning back had taken a lot of energy and the pain seemed even worse. His vision was spinning again, a concussion he realized by now. The door was opened by Pomfrey. Who called back to someone.
The rest of the week passed rather quick and uneventful. They got a notice that while they would be permitted alcoholic beverages at the Samhain ball but if they got caught giving any underage students they’d be toast. Draco felt rather pleased. He could appreciate a good drink and it was said they’d even be allowed during dinner.
Breakfast was relatively quiet. Apart from a speech about sneaking out to Hogsmeade without permission, followed by an announcement that every two weeks the students of age were allowed to go pubbing in Hogsmeade. Fantastic.
another chapter and a lot sooner than expected. This one is bit more of a filler and some bonding for the boys in general.
“It’s fine Harry. I know it’s a bit too much for him.” Oliver said. “He needs time. I don’t mind br…” Before 	Draco caught the rest of the conversation he was pulled back to reality by Pansy Dropping in his lap. “Draco my love, my most favorite boy on this earth. Tell me darling. How did you pull it off?  I nearly made an attempt on Grangers life.” She dramatically exclaimed.
The common room had turned out to be fairly alright. As long as Draco avoided talking to anyone but Blaise and Pansy. Daphne seemed to, just as Blaise get along with most of the others. They had never picked a side and people seemed to be more forgiving towards them.
“Whatever you want Malfoy. I really don’t give a fuck.” He definitely tried to sound calm. But Draco could feel his rage. “No reason to act like a total git. You could’ve told me that like a normal person.” He hissed, sounding rather hurt now.
“It’s alright. I’ll go.” He said numbly. Grabbing his bag. He had put his luggage in the luggage compartment so he only had a small bag to take… unwillingly he reached into his pocked, grabbing onto his wand. Tensing his shoulders as he looked at Weasley who looked about ready to curse him, only being held back by Granger and Longbottom.
She did. Pulling out the soft pink bow. He had charmed it with some wandless magic,  no one knew he had a feeling for that ever since he had a dark force creep about his home.
Losing his train of thought he stared across  the room. Nearly jumping out of his skin when someone plopped down beside him. He cussed under he breath, putting his wand back where he’d swiftly gotten it from. “Pansy what did I tell you about doing that?” he hissed, turning his gaze back to his book.
“Shut up Pans. At least you weren’t dragged into the water.” Blaise looked worse. His white tee was caked in mud and he was dripping everywhere.
He got himself a glass of water before jumping back into his own bed. Which proved to be rather cold. Grumbling he fell back asleep.
He topped it off with his quidditch robe to stay on brand, though it had now taken the same icy blue color as his tie, the borders bronze and the stitching silver. New was the broche, a silver wolfs head, like the bands had.
“I agree. I’m absolutely starving.” Draco snorted. Pushing her off and letting her lead him to the great hall.
That and I wrote out an entire chapter.. decided it was Harry and Draco getting to close. Too soon. Deleted it and wrote this instead.
He had taken the form of a snow leopard. A rather small member of the big cat family, but powerful enough to take down big prey. Far away enough from lions to satisfy his father.
“Oh geez.. come here.” Harry sighed, carefully helping him out of it, trying not to brush past the others naked skin. For not wanting complaints about his hands being cold purposes only of course.
“From the moment the mark on a child starts to vanish. We teach them wandless magic. Magic is to be respected. Work with your magic. I want every single one of you to focus on your magical core. Close your eyes. Let your magic flow through you. find its center. Focus on it put your hands together. Move your focus from your core to your fingertips. Mend it to materialize. It might not work right away… but keep practicing.”
“I like to pretend I do. You should’ve noticed.” He laughed lazily, fumbling with the buttons of his shirt. He barely registered Potter standing in front of him, slapping his hands away.
He shook his shoulder lightly… but he knew anything more drastic would just make it worse. He bit his lip. Desperate measures. He couldn’t bare the look on the others face as he gasped for air.
He was rather surprised to find 10 poles standing in the field together with Professor Leigh“Welcome everyone!” she called. She was wearing.. a rather traditional looking outfit. “I want the lot of you to pair up with your roommate and line up over there.” She pointed to a row of wooden poles. “10 seconds or else were doing pushups. 10…9…” her tone was happy and cheerful but something told Draco he didn’t want to mess with her.
“Malfoy I know what a stinging hex feels like. I managed to walk to the dorms through it. But I felt every punch. I passed out 3 hours ago and woke up to my body being incredibly sore. It only cleared when you healed it. So tell me. Who did it.”
“You cannot possibly ask me to gloss this over. I wish to ensure the safety of my students. All of them.”
Which he did. Thankfully. It was around 5 am when the first rays of sunshine came through the curtains. Stirring him awake. He managed to get out of the others grasp. Storming into the bathroom to turn back to his human form, dusting himself off. Before returning to his own bed. Thank god it was Sunday and he could sleep in.
“Here, try this one. Might be a bit big on you.” he hummed, handing it to Draco who was attempting to climb out of his button up instead of undoing the two buttons he had fastened.
“Me neither to be honest.” Draco said, stretching out a little. Reluctantly taking a bite of the food. “But it’s been alright. What’s your progress with Longbottom so far?”
“No.. Malfoy its ok. You can stay. All the other carriages are full.” Hermoine said, plopping down opposite of him as more of the Gryffindor team joined.
He wobbled slightly. He was feeling nauseous and tired. Perhaps he could get some sleep in now and make his way to the infirmary in the morning. It sounded far better than making his way back there or getting Blaise’s attention.
“Thank you guys so much..” she muttered nearly, looking in the mirror Draco had enlarged for her so she could see herself. “I can’t believe…”she fumbled for words. Just hugging the two boys instead.
They heard the first team being called back. Pansy and Hermoine… Pansy was attempting to hit Granger with the pole.. He shook his head. No time for distractions.
I also want to clarify some of Ron's anger before hand. He's frustrated. He wasn't willing to go back to Hogwarts. There's a lot of internal struggle. He clashes with Oliver a lot. Oliver is always rather in for a brawl and doesn't take it too personally. do trust me in the fact that they will make up.
He took about 10 minutes to get into his running outfit. Rather reluctantly today. His muscles were still stiff from the day before and the dream hadn’t helped.
“Shoulder straight, follow the rhythm of her walking, relax your hips a little.. there we go.” Harry hummed looking up at Draco with his bright eyes and blinding smile. Nearly making Draco fall of the horse for completely different reasons. He did as told, following the horse. Soon enough he felt relaxed enough to start focusing on finding the leopard he knew they’d never find. Casting some useless finding spells he knew of off the top of his head. “I think we’ll have to try again tomorrow. My spells aren’t coming up with anything.” He said, looking down at harry.
“Master Draco. You are staring again. The bread will not kneed itself that’s what Pips mother always says.” He gave her a smile.. he didn’t speak much.
“Quite well professor. We’re just waiting for the bread to finish and the jam to cool down.” Harry said, smiling friendly at her.
For all the girls it was the same. Pansy seemed to find her courage last. Right after Daphne. “I see.. You will meet an unlikely friend ms. Parkinson. Do not be afraid, you won’t have to watch your back as much as you think you should.”
By the time they were done.. things were quite friendly between them. Draco flopped down on the grass after doing Harry’s completely necessary cooling down stretches. He was battered. Craving water, which neither had brought. Like the dumbasses they were.
He didn’t make out most of it. His world was turning to black again. They had gotten him good huh? Oh well.. they had nearly a month to make up for right? He felt his lips curl up and arms wrap around him right after his knees had hit the floor.. time to go again.
He and Ron had talked about it… Ron knew he was… not completely straight. Ron knew he had stronger feelings for Draco and while Ron had asked him to not act upon them or try to get closer. He couldn’t help it.
He glanced at Potter. Who seemed just as reluctant as him. “..5…4…” he made his way over to a pole. Potter could follow his lead if they were going to do this.
“It’s useless potter. Does it need some kind of spell?” The other asked frustrated. Harry had trouble stopping himself from laughing.
So he asked Blaise for advice.. Blaise was rather approachable. Other than Pansy who shot him daggers anytime he breathed wrong. Yes Blaise was the better option out of the two people Malfoy hung out with. He’d done it Monday morning. As soon as he could.
“are you offering any help? I honestly don’t know what to pick for the Samhain ball.. let alone for the yule one.” Hermoine sighed, following his food picks.
He couldn’t help it. Draco let his expression soften for a moment. “I understand what you mean..” he muttered, before his features hardened again. He wasn’t bout to tell Potter he had spend his summer learning how to bake bread like a little bakery boy.
Harry left the room, pocketing the frogs. He was set on it though. It felt right. Helping Draco. And it was a means to get the wizarding world to accept those who weren’t put into jail and had their actions excused. And.. even after all those years of being pretty much bullied by Malfoy.. he couldn’t hate him. Something about his pestering had been a distraction from it all. Malfoy had always been the same.. well until sixth year when things went downhill incredibly fast.
They started with a formfitting dress.. but she looked too uncomfortable. Gorgeous. But not comfortable.
Aside from needing to take pain numbing potions and having to rub ditany on any cuts and bruises left he felt rather alright. But due to the concussion he was advised to stay out of class till at least after the weekend. He’d told her he’d do just that before leaving to his dorm. Collapsing into his own bed. Hoping to catch some sleep before the others would come back to fuss over him. His body was tired from the healing.
“Shut up, don’t listen to him, he knows nothing.” Draco purred, he needed some hugs and Amour was an excellent provider.
“Don’t apologize.” Draco managed to blurt out, feeling fairly sober all of a sudden. He turned away. “Don’t. I deserved it.” He crossed his arms over his body, clinging the shirt in front of it.
“We most definitely have to try to avoid them. we cannot be blamed for their mess-ups.” He nodded in agreement.
“Me? Angry, of course not. I’m just a little worried about some stuff, lets get you into your Pjs alright?” he tried to smile, looking at the pouting guy in front of him. he remembered the last time Draco had gone to Hogsmeade.. had it really already been months ago? They had been a little more cheerful last time. But he didn’t mind.
“Misses Minevra has told me all of the 8th year students can have dinner in the common room if it seems as if no one is trying to fight. Pip will bring food with her friends!” she announced. Disappearing with another crack. Three cracks later and there was a table full of food and a bunch of plates.
“Go for it Harry. I’ve never seen you like this. So protective of someone else.. doing the whole soft eyes thing and shit… not even with Ginny. I understand.. but please give me time.. time and space to get over it. I can’t help but think of you know who every time I see him. I can’t just get over how he treated us, even if he’s different now.” he’d paused for a moment, squeezing his mate’s shoulders.
“M’fine. I don’t usually drink.” Draco muttered, shivering under the cold air, making a half assed attempt at getting into the coat.
The elf dared to open her little arms. Giving him a hug. Making Draco laugh. The first time he’d laughed in a long.. very long time. It was as clear as a waterfall. He felt a little giddy. It was nice.. having someone care about you. someone to give gifts. A friend.
“I…” Potter stayed silent, making Draco turn to him finally to face him. “It’s a good distraction. I’ve done nothing but working out all summer to move my thoughts and tire myself out to you know.. get some sleep.” He flushed a little.
“Morning to you too sunshine.” Harry chuckled. “rough night? You’re usually slightly less of a git when you just wake up.”
A few minutes of bantering later he found himself walking to the gates with the rest of his year mates. Pansy, as per usual, had been right. everyone was there. Some already red cheeked and holding half empty bottles.
He got down to the grass. Trotting through the crispy leaves blown from the forrest. Eventually he was sprinting and running, hopping up and down pillars. Each breath and pant clearing his mind. Perhaps his body hadn’t been as tired as he thought it was. Just heavy with worry and bad thoughts.
Draco was silent for a moment. He didn’t have a date.. and he would rather not mind having someone to walk with. Who would want to go on a date with a deatheater. He had planned on stealing a dance with Pansy halfway through because he did really like dances.
15 minutes later their station was clean and they were sat on top of their counter with a mug of hot tea. Watching the other teams. There was something oddly domestic about the two of them. cooking together and drinking tea while waiting for the food to finish. It yet again amazed Draco how well they actually worked together. Feelings of doubt yet again filling his brain. If he hadn’t been such a prick.. he could’ve helped Harry instead of bully him all his life. He really didn’t deserve this.. but he was thankful. He knew he shouldn’t be allowed to think this way but.. seeing the other smile and have fun with him now, he wanted to enjoy that while he could. He wanted to salvage every moment he got to enjoy. Because he did in fact enjoy them. a lot.
“I would have died if it weren’t for Ms Malfoy nee Black. She saved my life. Not only that there are multiple witness accounts of Draco acting for our side. Tossing me his wand and fighting on our side till his father called him Voldemort’s side. Can you not see how this is hurting them? using potions to drag the truth out…. This is wrong Kingsley. It’s like you’ve learned nothing..” he wanted to say more. Draco could tell by the sharp, angry inhale he heard coming from the other.
Last period was History. A class so dreary and boring that Draco had taken the liberty of taking a nap. By the time he got to his dorm he started the dreaded essay and charmed his bottle halfway. He worked on it till dinner, where he was picked up by Pansy to get to the great hall.
They tried a few more. Each wand rejecting him. Unicorns, dragons, even a phoenix. No wand seemed to work with him. He felt utterly dreadfull. But perhaps it meant he wouldn’t have to go back. That seemed a rather good option to him.
Dinner had been nice. He’d handed Hermoine the vails. Claiming he found them in his bag from over the summer. She agreed slipping one to Ron would be the best idea… and indeed. Over dinner. Ron seemed himself again. He was smiling.
As soon as Harry was calm again, which took nearly thirty minutes, he pulled himself away. Turning back and grabbing a glass of water. Now gently shaking Harry’s shoulder.
7 shots, each a different color of the rainbow consumed right after each other before downing a beer. Even he was surprised he made it through. His vision had started spinning after the bottle of blue mixed vodka that had given him cavities from simply smelling it. And that was three rounds ago.
He’d worked mostly in silence, not realizing Harry was just watching, mesmerized by the way he did it all. He followed each step carefully and clearly, completely shutting out the outside world, it was like he was working on potions. He was efficient with it all and could get lost in it.
That good feeling turned out to be right, she was stunning in the dress. All she needed was a red lipstick and some good make up. Which Blaise offered up to do. Draco offered to look though his closet for a gray mink to drape over her shoulders.
“You can eat here but if pip catches you making a mess. Pip will have to scold you.” The held up her tiny pointy finger before disappearing again with her friends.
By the time he was supposed to receive his wand.. he got a note instead. His wand had been destroyed.. when Potter used it to fight the dark lord it had split… so he was allowed a pardon for a trip to Olivander’s. Accompanied by an Auror official.
“Potter?” he asked. Looking at the mug. “Trying to poison me are you.” he added, taking it nonetheless.
Today I decided to finish bit of a longer chapter I haven't looked it over like i usually do because my mood has been kind of down. My dog has been Sold. I came home to find him gone and its really broken me up on top of a lot of other things I've got going on...
“Don’t even start me on that. he dragged me up to touch one of the bloody beings. Can you believe that?” he frowned, glaring slightly.
Harry seemed to flush a little. “I suck at potions?”  if Draco could he would’ve thrown something at him. He settled for a scowl his way before looking ahead of him.
“We won’t have to make friends Potter. You’re staying on your side of the room. I’ll stay on mine. We don’t bother one another. You keep out of my business. I’ll keep out of yours. I do not need your pity nor your friendship. I’m certain you have better things to do like being the golden boy.” Draco spat. Great going on being friendly with the man he would have to spend a whole year with. But he wasn’t done yet. Oh no he had a sudden surge of confidence and he best make good use out of it. He opened his mouth to say more. But potter stopped him.
By the time the song ended they were panting lightly, most of the other 8th years had left when the other years had begun to join. Not that the two of them had noticed, they were seemingly lost in a silent conversation of sorts. Neither of them quite understood, but it seemed important, even after the dance that had lasted near 10 minutes, there were still things that needed to be said. Instead of saying them however, Draco smiled lightly. “I’ll.. want to get something to drink?” he asked to which Harry simply answered with a “I think that’s a good idea..” silently following him to the punch table and pouring them both a glass of what was marked 8th years punch.
At this point he was about half way through. His eyes, darting from the pages to look over the common room. Weasley seemed quite calm today. Playing some wizards chess with Granger. Clearly winning. She didn’t seem to get the game. Even after all these years of being conditioned by Weasley.
Draco’s eyes met with Blaise’s even he looked nervous… They would probably be paired up right? I mean. They were unlikely friends, Blaise was of a much lower stance than him when they became friends. Though the guy had worked himself up over the past while. He was friends with people from all houses, friends with benefits might I add. The bloody succubus.
They got up fine until a swarm of shadowy ravens swooped at them. A protego prevented the birds from clashing into them.
“You were too busy dancing with Potterboy. Even I have never been able to get you to do anything other than waltz. I may have to ask him what he fed you”
“Who did Pans?” Blaise asked, very carefully, putting a piece of buttered-and-jammed-toast on her plate.
They started with a red dress. But it didn’t match her skin tone. White was protested because that was too much like a wedding dress… they eventually ended on black for the color.
Once on the field. He found their new rather intimidating challenge. The parkour had been changed up. It was now hidden in dark mist.
“Draco Malfoy wanting to try a muggle hoodie? That’s one for the books, sure. Let me see if I’ve got a clean one.” He hummed, beginning to dig through his trunk, soon coming up with a somewhat clean Hoodie he’d gotten in London a few years back. Bold letters saying London across it and some random date.
“Sod off will you.” Malfoy hissed. Elbowing Blaise. “Keep your Fantasies to yourself thank you. New subject. Pans. How about you and Granger?”
“Will do. Save me a seat at dinner yeah?” Draco said, turning on his heels and making his way to the library. He’d been looking into getting some plants to spruce up his dorm. Rather than asking Neville and getting pulled into a 3 hour conversation he thought it would perhaps be best if he did some research first.
this took a while to get out. at first I was stuck and then I couldn't stop writing. I ended the chapter a bit earlier so i can continue off of some of the stuff I've already written down. Enjoy <3
“You have to rise the bread twice.. for a whole hour?” he asked looking a little confused over the list.
“Oh… Malfoy..” she muttered, being pushed in by Weasley whom was fuming at the mere sight of him. Drawing his wand.
He woke up early. How late was it? Casting a quick tempus he realised it was 7am. Groaning he sat up. He remembered last night faintly. He remembered standing in front of Voldemort. Firing spells at him but nothing worked. He was held back as his friends were tortured to death. It send shivers down his spine. He was set loose at some point. Chased by Fenrir and his gang into the forbidden forest.
“those hooded shirts right? They look comfy, can I sleep in one?” rather a bold question, but it made Harry smile.
“I want you to know. I am not against you. You can come to me with your troubles. I can tell you are troubled.” The man spoke in his heave accent, placing the band on Draco’s wrist and saying the incantation.. Draco felt the magic wash over him. It was warm, it scared him at first. But soon it was rather soothing. Like a new sort of confidence. It made him stand up straighter, stronger in his shoes.
He was escorted by two Aurors he didn’t recognize. They weren’t harsh nor were they kind. They at least took him to the train an hour early so he could avoid most other students. He found himself a compartment, locking it and pulling out a book. He tried to read and not be wary. He failed miserably. His eyes darting to the door constantly.
“I was chosen yes. By my father and HIM. But I didn’t want to be. I was afraid of what would happen to mom. Just as she was afraid for me. Father just wanted to be his little bootlicker.” He felt his fathers eyes on him. But he couldn’t stop speaking the truth. He wanted to hug himself, but with his hands cuffed it just turned into him pushing his arms into his sides. His chest felt heavy. He felt like all the air had been drawn out of him. Feeling so painfully aware of the all the eyes on him.
“Wouldn’t dare too.” Draco mumbled, leaning onto him as they walked towards the shrieking shack. “Oh no not there. That place is haunted Harry.” He looked up at the other with big eyes.
He’d lost track of his coat somewhere, not that he was truly bothered at this point. He was snugged in between Pansy and Hermoine. Giggling like a moron as they dragged him to the next pub where they dropped him off on a table to sit with the others for a moment. They were told to keep an eye on him and stop giving him drinks.
a rather quick update this time. I'm still not sure on how much drama I would like to include. Hence today some fluff.
Their cloaks swissing behind them like the girls dresses were, they should have taken them off before but it was too late now. Soon the others of the school began to join on the dancefloor. It was a custom to do a first waltz at balls like these before doing anything else.
Harry just laughed. “Oh god. It’s not. I was under the cloak when you were dragged through the snow last time. There’s a tunnel there that’ll get you home quicker, safer. And it’s a bit warmer than out here in the cold.”
I absolutely love working on this story and it is officially the furthest I've ever gotten with anything but I do realise its bit of a mess with lots of time skips. a lot of what is being written in this story is me trying to figure out how to write certain things. Like Drunk Draco, or dealing with Ptsd as an outsider, falling in love slowly, coming to terms with yourself, knowing you're in love with someone but not being sure if its ok to be. this is mostly a writing practice.
He snorted in reply, closing his eyes. He felt sore, sweaty and dirty.. but accomplished. It was nice. Potter wasn’t to bad of company right now…
Anderson gave them all another look over. Sending an icy shiver down Draco’s back. He already had trouble with looking people in the eye. This wasn’t easy. But he knew he couldn’t let himself be stepped on if he wanted to be respected by the man.
“I’ll fetch Poppy. Do watch out for yourself Mr. Malfoy…” she sighed, giving him a rather soft look before she left.
Harry handed him a picture from the notebook, Draco put his chocolate away, taking the photo and putting it in his lap, his hands were a little shaky. Harry knew nothing, he couldn’t look suspicious. He stared at the picture…
It was nice until they went to get back in and Draco realized that cigarettes  could hit you worse than alcohol. He stumbled, falling on harry as his world went black for a moment. “Merlin..” he uttered.
They had joined together to build up wards to keep the press away. And two elves had taken it upon themselves to redecorate the place. Often asking Draco what he wanted for the colors… he had mindlessly given them creative freedom and slowly the manor was becoming more colorful. Slowly they drowned out the memories of death and hurt of the house.
“I know.. which is why I forgive you.” she squeezed his hand again. However weird and out of touch this whole experience was. It was rather comforting.
“That’s great! I’ve noticed how well you two are getting along so far. I’d say you’re almost on top of the class bonding wise. Couples and best friends aside. I realy hope the two of you decide to stay.”
But Kingsley interrupted. “Are you done mr Potter? I am having a hearing. You rudely interrupted my first sentencing.. we indeed have taken the better actions of the youngest Malfoy into account, those mentioned by the likes of you and ms Lovegood. Now if you will please take a seat and join us. In peace.” The prime minister didn’t seem upset. He was scolding but he sounded rather proud.
He opened the door. Only to stare into the face of no one other than the savior himself. he froze, averting his eyes. “I’m sorry… there must have been a mistake.” He uttered, turning back to get out of the room. Only to find it blocked off… those bastards…
McGonagall stood up from her spot.. Dumbledore’s old spot.. “My dearest students.. I want to start by saying I am unbelievably proud to see so many of you. I know the last few years haven’t been what they should have been.. But I promise this year will be better. Hogwarts is a school of unity. United we will prevail any danger on our paths and united we will build a better future for the magical world.. therefor my students I ask you. Please be kind to one another. Every singly person here deserves to be here. No matter what their past.” She took a shakey breath. It was evident this took a lot out of her.
He heard potter talk, but he put a silencing charm over his bed, set an alarm and let himself pass out. No sleeping draught needed. His body was drained enough
“Oh.. nothing I missed you.” he blurted, not looking at Harry and focusing on the ground. If he kept looking at the floor he wouldn’t fall.
“Easy there Potter. I can’t tell you what happened. But I will confirm he didn’t slip down some stairs.” Blaise held up his hands. “..Look Potter. Come with me a minute right. We have to talk.”
“I don’t believe my fathers views. But I am sorry for what he’s done.. Frankly I think beating me up will make him bat an eye. He cares for no one but himself. Let me go. I won’t go to anyone about this.” He tried it..
Harry was excited. He looked forward to these classed the most. They were fun, exciting and a great way to put his mind to something.
He had exchanged letters with his former friends. Theodore Nott had moved far away. His mother had taken him to France and they were starting their life there. Pansy was joining but had let him know she would come to him when she felt ready to talk. He respected her wishes… Goyle.. well Goyle had gone mental and wouldn’t be joining them any time soon.
Draco and Harry’s bread was getting along nicely. It was puffing on well. They experimented by adding more seeds making it quite a rich bread.
He was seriously regretting his earlier statement about a helmet now, sitting on top of the horse and looking at the ground beneath, shaking slightly.
“I’m not getting on top of the murder machine Potter. If you want to go ahead and get yourself killed. By all means go ahead. I’ll watch.”
“Told you Potter. I can make bread. Though this is where my expertise ends. I haven’t really gone much further in learning to cook.”
He faintly noticed the sorting of the new attendants.. very few new Slytherins, but they were applauded nonetheless.
“Like I was going to let you be alone Harry come on.” He carefully opened his arms. To his surprise, Harry slumped into his chest. Letting out a sigh.
“They are indeed as comfy as they look.” Draco nodded approvingly. Stepping into Harry’s space for the second time this night and wrapping his arms around his waist. He wasn’t ashamed to admit that maybe he did like drunk and clingy Draco.
“But I’m here.. and Hermoine is in her room with Pansy Harry. Were at Hogwarts in our dorm, the 8th years dorm. He’s gone.. you’re safe. Here. I’m safe here.” He spoke in a soft and gentle tone. Yet it was demanding enough to make Harry look away from the spot on his bed he was staring at and instead face him.
It took him about 30 seconds of carefully following Potters movements before simply giving in. laughing his ass off at how incredibly dramatic he acted out the lyrics. He was full on dancing now. Snickering. “Oh this one is good too. One more since you missed half of the last one.” Potter gave him his begging eyes.
It was healing. He still had his nightmares. He still had trouble feeling accepted. He still nearly jumped out of skin being touched. But having actual friends instead of alleys. Having people see him as he was now, instead of who he was… it felt freeing. He leaned onto Pansy’s shoulder who in turn leaned her cheek on his head.
“I would. But it’s Sunday remember. Anderson said we’d change things up today and I fear for the worst.”
Draco nodded. Still a bit stunned by the friendliness of the other. “I.. yes that’s correct.” He whispered.
“professor do you honestly think that would know? I would like to keep this on the low preferably and avoid it in the future by just staying with my friends…” they would hurt his friends too next time. But McGonagall didn’t need to know that. “.. if we could just do that and avoid anything that could get me put into Azkaban. I would like that.” he finished, his voice growing stronger each word he spoke.
“Fair enough.. do you wanna try getting better with the horse then? I can Lunge you around the field. You’ll still be tied up and you can stop any moment.”
“Thank you Luna. If you.. you know ever need any help let me know alright? I know I haven’t been a good cousin.. or family at all but I would like to make up.”
So far he felt like he was doing a half decent job. Draco was smiling again. With him even. He learned not to take snide remarks to heart. It was a front the other put up. If Harry smiled through them.. he usually earned a grin back.
“F..fine..” he uttered in reply as Harry cast the first freezing spell. It went right through. The dark shadow came closer attempting to consume them… until Draco cast a loud Lumos maxima. The mist cleared for a second and the shadow disappeared.
“Don’t you think he should go back too? I know it’s early but I’m quite tired..” there was a warm voice behind him, he liked that voice, it made him quirk up from his pouting over the fact no one was letting him drink anymore.
“Potter you do realize I was on house arrest right? I haven’t worked out in quite some time even before..”
To be truly honest Draco hadn’t been too invested in the others. But he knew little cliques were starting to form. He usually floated between the study group, fending for himself and playing chess. Perhaps he should try to go to the next Hogsmeade trip with the others. It was Samhain after all and everyone would go dressed up.. perhaps he should.
“A literal tiger Harry.. I’m sorry but what?” he asked. “Explain to me why you think there is a literal tiger in Hogwarts and no one else has seen it.”
Harry grumbled behind him, squeezing just a little tighter, his breath hitting Draco’s neck and making all the hairs stand right up.
It had been a few weeks since they were pardoned. It wasn’t great.. far from it. His mother had shut down completely. Most of Draco’s days, if he got out of bed that was, were spend looking for his mum and making sure she ate what the house elves had cooked. They seemed to have forgiven them. They were allowed to leave, find a better place. But they took care of their masters.
He put his wand away, focussing. He could do this. It had been years but he was certain he could pull it off.
He cast a small lumos… the others face was tear stained, his breathing heavy… nightmares. Bad ones like his own. “Harry?” he asked softly. But the other didn’t wake. He just seemed to panic more. He tried again. “Harry wake up.. you’re dreaming. It’s a dream. It’s not real.”
He felt Potters hands heat up on the back of his own. It didn’t hurt. It felt nice and warm. Like a mug of hot chocolate. Oh he could go for one of those after this.
It kept surprising him. How well everyone was getting along. The mixed houses truly had done them well and Draco only hoped Hogwarts would take something from this experiment and use it for the following years. The house rivalry was still there. But so much milder and much more in a playful manner. The civility might have to do a lot with everyone here, no matter what side they had been on, going through the same process of mourning and grieving and clamping onto what little sanity some had left.
But they got him at least a few hours of sleep each night. Nightmare less sleep. He always thanked her. To which she replied. “Mistress Malfoy cannot care for Master Draco very well. So pip must. But Pip is glad Master Draco is doing better.” He had smiled at her softly. Giving her a little pat on her little head. She reminded him of Dobby. He remembered that silly little deviant elf.
“Say pip.” He croaked softly once the bread was in the oven after its final rising period and she as making him a hot chocolate. Yes it was the middle of summer. But he had a sweet tooth and she’d let him have anything as long as he got something in his stomach.
He turned to look at Ron and Hermoine. Ron was holding a small whirlwind, Hermoine was holding a mountain in a small glove.
He stood there. Shaky and obediently. He felt a great deal of magic hitting him be tried to keep his breath steady. After about five minutes he felt a wand hitting in his hand. It stayed there. “Open your eyes.. I believe you have found your match… a hawthorn Phoenix. Highly excentric… a healing wand. Best matched with a wizard in turmoil. A talented wizard which you most definitely are.. and an independent decisive core.. it seems Draco.. that you are in for a lot of change and good things in your future.”
so what did you guys think?! I love reading your comments about the story, tips and just stuff in general!
“So in need of a new wand are we Draco.” The man smiled at him. “Let’s find you one shall we.. you used to be a hawtorn… unicorn hair?”
“My my fancy. Sure, Baileys and I’d also like one of those oat cookies. You did after all pull me from my important reading.”
“Yes of course you are. All of us have! It’s a muggle game.” He handed the bottle back to him, noting the others confused expression. “Ah… see in college muggles often join these groups right… and when they are let into one. They have a how do I say this.. ritual of sorts? Sometimes its completing embarrassing challenges, other times its icing. Where other members of the club or group hide a bottle of Smirnoff ice. Multiple actually. And when the challenged finds it. They chug it. We made our own version where every member of the 8th years class chugs one at first. And the rest of the night the others buy their drinks. You drink what’s served. No questions asked. Now chug.” He explained, others had stopped now, watching intently. Pansy was yet again wearing a Satan-like grin. She had set this up.
Giving Harry a more serious look. “I.. I’m only saying this once Potter. But.. I’d prefer you to stay too. I really do. So please.. Please do..” with that he pulled away. Remembering the Bread and the fact it had to be pulled out. Harry simply smiled at him, nodding. There was something soft about his eyes that Draco couldn’t quite place. He shook it off, saving their bread just in time from being burnt and pulling it from the oven, placing it on the cutting board.
Harry chuckled in reply. Leading Draco out to the lake. “so I was thinking about doing 6km interval today. We run 2km, sprint about 300m. rinse and repeat. At the 3km mark we take a 10 min break for some stretching exercises and then continue on. Questions?” Potter hummed. Looking determined. Draco was starting to regret agreeing to this. Well starting. He already regretted it.
“We’ll find McGonagall in the morning. First thing. I’m worried too. tomorrow is a normal school day, let’s just try to get some sleep Harry.” Hermoine spoke softly.
His thought travelled back to the past few weeks. Pansy, Granger, Longbottom and Blaise were getting along great. They each had a strong suit in a certain class and they build each other up in each subject.
The now 15 minute ride felt like an hour and he was thankful when they finally were back at the stables. Getting off right after Harry. Immediately regretting doing it faster than needed. His inner thighs cramping up from the position they had been in. he cursed.
“But you did. Come on.” He pulled Draco into the pub by his arm. Did some more shots before disappearing into the crowd for a second. Coming back he smirked. “Ready? Ron is here. I even made sure of a half decent song. Let’s go.”
“professor.. I refuse. I’m not going to be attached to Granger the whole fucking run. It is one thing I am forced to stay in  a room with her!” Pansy protested, making professor Leigh turn to her. “To bad miss Parkinson.. 10 more pushups for speaking up without being asked to. Everyone.”
“I knew I didn’t dream about you.. what happened to you? did your hunt go wrong?” Potter asked as if he was talking to a small puppy and Draco melted. He wasn’t in the right state of mind. He let out the tiniest mew he could muster.
He took a sharp breath as the guards took him by his arms. Dragging him out of the cell he had called home the past few months.
“So are you coming tonight? It’s Friday after all and you haven’t been to Hogsmeade in so long.” Pans hummed, cutting up dandelion roots. Draco took the knife from her, she was butchering the job and uneven root squares could mess with the consistency.
I've been sitting on this chapter. Wanting to add enough words to get the count up to 20 000. as you see. I have failed misserably. But you deserve at least one update.
“Do not insult my tea Blaise. Final warning.” Draco grinned, sitting up with the necessary complaints about being comfortable.
The next day, at exactly 3pm Harry burst into their room. Casting a tempus. “I’m in time. Did you set Blaise up to try and keep me from coming in you devil?”
“Given me what I deserve Blaise. I just hope they decide this isn’t worth it every evening.” He croaked back. Had someone chocked him? His throat felt bruised.. well his whole body felt bruised.
“I can’t leave either way.. And I’d rather not end up with Weasley as my roommate.” He tried to joke but it came out serious. He was serious. Other than Blaise and maybe Neville  he didn’t trust anyone to not attempt murder or ridicule him when he woke up  screaming from his nightmares. He shook his thoughts off.
“They’d get me put into Azkaban.. everything is better than that.” Draco chocked, wrapping his arms around his friend. Blaise had been cold up until now… it was nice to have him be there now. “Please heal me Blaise… it fucking hurts..” he muttered against the others chest, tears soaking into his sweater.
So he did. The guard who had gotten him from his cell came over. Giving him a curt nod. “Alright mr Malfoy. We’re straight to Olivanders shop. After you’ll be given Polyjuice as we shop for your Books. Robes will have to be ordered. Let’s go, we have a tight schedule.”
He made Harry feel like he had a purpose again. He had to save Draco. If he could do that. He could save himself.
“8pm. Leaving in groups of 4. Be ready.” Harry muttered, quickly leaving the scene and for his next class... Rather embarrassed.
Draco nearly chocked on his drink. “Potter. I’m at least as good if not better than you come on now. You were acting out an entire musical over there.” He huffed, puffing out his cheeks.
I've been a bit sidetracked from writing.. Mostly because I've been reading a lot, working out my plot for this fic and working on the plot for a personal project that I hope to publish one day.
He felt a paralyzing spell hit him first. He couldn’t reach for his wand. not anymore. It was taken from his pocket and tossed aside. He was surrounded by a group of glamoured students, none of which he recognized. They had gone as far as hiding anything house related and using voice altering spells.
They walked back in comfortable silence ignoring the glares Draco got for simply walking with Harry. But at their dorm Draco remembered something. “Potter?”
Time seemed to fly. Soon they arrived at the school. They managed to make some small talk with the other Slytherin reject. But they seemed hesitant to befriend Draco too… he didn’t blame them. it was best if they kept away from him for their self-preservation.
“Malfoy? Oh uh..” he sounded confused, letting him go. Draco immediately got up, refusing to turn around, trying to will the heat in his cheeks to go down. He took  deep breath before finally turning around. “I.. I’m going to shower. you feeling better?” he asked
“You’re bright enough to remember them, come on Amour.” He’d linked the lead rope through the bit so there was equal pressure on her mouth. “Don’t pull the reigns. I couldn’t find a bitless bridle. Her mouth is sensitive and it can hurt if you put pressure on. I’ll do the steering for now. Just focus on your seat.” He commented. Teaching seemed to come naturally to him and Draco found it easy to follow him. As soon as Amour set a single step forward he wobbled though. Grasping onto the saddle.
“Oh shoo. No Pip. Just tea please. And maybe some cinnamon buns? If you have any that is.” Pip simply beamed up at them.
“how about we drink another cup of tea and then do it? If we pull it too soon it could collapse in. its just 8 more minutes and then it’ll be done.” Draco hummed, summoning his kettle and holding it up. Harry reluctantly held out his mug and let it be filled. He didn’t complain when Draco put just a little honey in it  Without asking if he wanted any. He wasn’t a big fan of sweet tea but.. With draco taking the lead overall he trusted him on this one.
He took a sip. “No mate you skull it. Toss it back alright.” Seamus grinned, something dangerous about that grin.
He looked up. right… Trail day. He got up. with some trouble. How long had he been sitting in that corner?
Eventually finding the candy lady found him. Leading him to her own compartment. It was rather small but.. Pansy and another Slytherin were also on the hide there. Provided with sweets and cold iced pumpkin juice from the overly friendly, possibly senile lady. They were all chattering softly. “Now shush shush. No one should have to wander around the train like that. Someone has to look out for you. I will be making my rounds. Please do not make a mess.” He nodded in reply. Sitting down in one unoccupied spots in the corner.
He sighed. Might as well give in. watch the door. Be vigilant. He trusted this wand. It was powerful. He had gotten to know it over the past few weeks. It felt better than his old wand. They worked on a whole new level… though it did have bit of a mind of its own. Very prone to fire. He had accidentally lit the yellow love seat on fire the other day… the elves weren’t pleased but had said nothing of it. It rather suited him. Being named after the dragon constellation and all. He watched the door.. soon losing himself in though as the train started filling up.
They hopped the first 5 fences easy. Potter seemed to calculate the jumps up ahead, Draco just had to follow his lead.
“And did you believe that? that you were chosen?” he couldn’t read the others emotions. His eyes were too blurry.
“I still can’t believe it. I mean.. we just went for it. Done did it in one go.” He sounded as happy as Draco felt.
“So what do you say. Friday we sneak out to Hogsmeade for a pub crawl. Drink till you drop.” Ron smirked around. Seamus whom was sat next to him beamed at him.
By the time he was done with the jam they were ready for the bread to be baked. He put the round, puffed dough in the stone oven the had access too. making the fire reach the required heat with a simple flick of his wand.
Draco snickered, drinking the last of the beer before getting up. “Next pub it is.” He hummed, feeling quite tipsy. As they walked to the next pub, Draco found himself walking next to Harry. He turned to him. “Potter. You do know I don’t know how to erm.. you know.. dance? I mean I can waltz properly. Of course. But that also is kind of it.” He muttered, feeling his cheeks flush a little. Thank god for the darkness of the night right?
He stared up at the ceiling, a croaky voice shaking him out of his thoughts. Nearly making him jump at the closeness of it.
The students happily followed him to one of the outer towers. A place that used to be mostly of limits during their last years. It had a view over the lake. Decorations were rather scarce, but enough to make the tower feel warm and cozy.
“I’m glad to hear that Potter.. I’ll give you a hint.. to win him over a bit quicker. He has a horrible sweet tooth. Hot chocolate.. chocolate frogs… cake.. anything of the sort is the best bribe to get Malfoy to even listen to you. help him and you’ll help the others too. I’ll do my part. You do yours.” He handed Harry a bag. “You were planning a run Wednesday right? Talk to him on Tuesday… and don’t bring up what happened. Its off limits. He’ll talk when he’s ready. Now off you go before Longbottom thinks I’ve killed you.”
“Well done Potter and Malfoy!” Anderson called. They made it.. first. Potter cheered. Draco couldn’t help let out a cry of joy himself. Panting hard as he accepted the Highfive offered by Potter. “Damn it Potter.. I can’t believe we did that.”
Once he had caught his breath he reluctantly followed potter to the healers quarters. For once not bothered by the mud he was dragging in. there was a sense of pride. He had finished, first, despite not being in the best shape. He hadn’t been killed by Potter. He only slightly felt like dying. It felt good. Not that he was going to admit that to Potter.
“You wouldn’t want me here.” He simply replied, pushing past Potter, who was last to join them. he heard granger say something. But he didn’t hear it. He felt the tension leave the compartment with him. Faint scolding from Granger to probably Weasley as he made his way through the train. For a moment he could feel eyes on him. But he didn’t look back to see whom.
That was decided then, they would all ask their roommates. Should he ask Draco? No one had objected inviting the Slytherins, mostly because Ron was too distracted to catch that part of the discussion. Besides. He did owe they guy an evening of drinking right? Yeah it only made sense. Now he just had to ask it.
“Master Draco should not mind such things. Pip likes helping. Pip wants to make Master Draco feel happy.”
“Oh sod off. It was pretty great, I’ve never done it so well before!” Harry said with mock disappointment. They both laughed softly.
By the time he got back, an hour later and a lot more careless he was purring softly, finding Harry sitting on top of his bed. His shoulders were slumped a little as he was looking over what he must have thought to be Draco. Draco himself was feeling a little reckless. He might not deserve Harry while he was himself.. but he was touch starved as ever and Harry was always willing to pet a damn leopard.
About half an hour later a alcoholic butterbeer was plopped down in front of him. “Lost you Malfoy. You’ve got to at least give me a chance to keep up my end of the deal.” Potter snorted, joining them. “I thought you’d never come.” Draco said dramatically. Happily downing the beer. He normally wasn’t much of a beer lover. But he made an exception if it came to free beer from no one other than the golden boy.
“It wasn’t Cedric this time. It was.. Sirius.. then You.. then Lupin.. then Hermoine.. he killed everyone and then he began chocking me out. Holding me up so I could see everyone that was gone..” he chocked lightly.
“Floors getting a little close. To be honest.” He muttered, feeling Harry lift his arm and ducking under it to support him.
8pm. Right. Most students were gathered up. Dressed rather nice. They were missing the Parvati twins, Granger and a few others whose names Draco didn’t particularly remember. He got grouped to leave through a secret entrance near the big willow tree that would kick your ass if you got to close. He raised a brow at Potter and Blaise. They were the only group of five and last to leave. Sneaking through the hallways quite effectively.
Malfoy walked up to it. Carefully patting it. “We’ll have to get used to it Pansy… Death surrounds us..” he whispered, getting into the carriage. Where he was greeted by a familiar face. “Blaise.” He said.
“Keep it. I’ve got way too many. They’re easy for taking notes but they do run out rather quick. And You’re not allowed to use them for essays.” He explained, watching Anderson stroll into the class.
“Good job Boys. As promised you’re dismissed, the others will have a run down of each part of the parkours.. Malfoy, you should eat something. It’s good you made it through but you look like you’re gonna pass out on me. Potter please see him to Pomphrey’s for a little energy boost… and get that scratch checked out.” Leigh hummed before Making  her way over to the Parvati twins who had also finished.
They’d hugged it out. Which was rare for them. Ronald Weasley wasn’t a hugger. They’d smiled and toasted to a brighter future after which Ron had been dragged away by Hermoine and he had been left alone again. He’d sighed, looking at Draco again. The guy had barely been able to sit up straight and just like that they were on their way back.
“Will do.” Potter hummed back. Taking his leave. And joining Weasley and Granger with his own mug of chocolate. Perhaps potter was into cooking too. he’d have to ask his recipe as a favor next time.
“Fineeee.” Harry huffed, getting up, holding out a hand to Draco who’s entire body complained already. The other took it gratefully, dusting some sand off of himself, picking up Harry’s hoody and handing it to him.
“Ah.. I…” Potter flushed. “Don’t have one because I forgot and you know it’ll work out we’ll just walk together unless you do have a date with Pansy or something in which case just forget I said anything.” He rambled really quickly, clearly embarrassed.
Draco stared at it in silence. Carefully casting a lumos. It lit up brightly. The wand felt familiar. Warm in his hand. “Thank you..” he uttered.
They were soon dismissed and each went their separate ways after reaching the common room. Harry to go for a ride with Amour. Draco to read and drink tea by the window.
“Malfoy. Welcome to clubnight. Bottoms up mate.” He gestured for Draco to open the bottle, which he did, hesitantly bringing it to his lips. Smirnoff.. only 4%? Couldn’t be too bad right?
Draco was sat at one of the desks. Planning around his schedule appropriately. He knew he would have to spend a lot of time in his room. Hexes and jinxes might be forbidden. But he knew there were possible loopholes. After all who would believe him. Who wouldn’t think it was justified to hurt a death eater.
So there he stood. On a crowded dancefloor facing Potter who held out his hand. “Now this is a classic Draco. You cannot fuck this up no matter what you do.” He grinned like a drunken idiot, glancing at the Weasley that had set this up to begin with. His cheeks were as red as his head. He looked as pissed drunk as Draco felt.
The higher fence was harder, but again Potters plan worked. He pushed Draco up, who in turn pulled Harry up and they got down together.
Breakfast was a quite affair. But during potions first period Pansy scooted next to him. “So. What’s up?”
Harry already had his outfit planned out. Much like the outfits Durmstrang had worn during the Christmas ball. Fur included. He was excited about it. He wasn’t one to put much thought into outfits but… it was Pansy who had told him he had to shine for the ball and she wouldn’t take no for an answer.
“i.. yeah… fuck.. thank you Draco.” Harry muttered, slowly blinking a few times. “Can I.. Can you get me some more water?” he asked, Draco nodded, moving away to get up and to the bathroom. “don’t leave.” It sounded so fragile, it nearly cracked him. He forced a soft smile back on his face instead of the worried frown I had formed the moment he turned away.
Harry did as told. Focusing his energy as he was told. Around the room wind was blowing, he heard the sound of water rushing by, stones clicking together.. fire burning. He felt his hands heat up. he opened his eyes, opening his hands. He was holding a bright fire in his hands.
Harry didn’t seem to mind, wrapping his arms around the cat and nuzzling his face into the fur. Draco purred deeply. “I’m glad you’re here.. I was feeling a little lonely again.” Harry muttered, nearly breaking the others heart by how sad and raw he sounded. “Ron and Hermoine are so happy together. I feel like such an intruder to what they have. Hell most people around me have someone to fall back on. I’m not saying I’m mad at them for getting together.. but it used to be the three of us… now it’s the two of them and me, Fuck.. I feel so alone.” He felt the other shaking, the fur of his neck was getting wet.. oh no.. Potter was having a drunken sob.
He let out a single sob, which gradually turned into full on crying. He knew he deserved this.. but merlin did it break him and his spirit. He had been too happy, that shouldn’t be enjoying himself. Merlin forbid he felt happy or safe. He should have been more vigilant and watched out for himself. he should at least have defended himself instead of simply being taken and beaten by a bunch of children.
“Malfoy.” He smirked. Taking out a notebook and a pen. McGonagall had allowed those for taking notes this year. They didn’t interfere with magic after all. He felt Malfoy staring at it.
He looked up at harry. Whom was laughing too. Giving him a playful wink. Draco wheezed. Fine. He could sway his hips a little right. That wouldn’t hurt.
And so they did. Draco was ready to collapse after the first km. but he pushed on. Harry noticed however. Taking the lead. 1km of running, 500m sprint and 500m walking then another 1km of running. Instead of 10 minutes of stretching he let Draco catch his breath. Then took 20 minutes to explain and do some leg exercises as well as some pushups and its varieties before repeating the running pattern.
“I’m fine Potter… don’t worry about it.” His voice was flat. Void of any emotion he’d rather not shine through.
Just want to say I'm kinda living for Harry and the snow leopard cuddles. Also snow leopards really do curl up with their tail in their mouth. Look it up please its incredibly heart warming.
“Pans. Shut up. I did not. I just had a good night sleep.” He hissed in reply. Continuing on whatever potion they working on.
She scoffed. Draco just stayed silent. Watching them and their bickering as they rode to the castle.
“Has he tried a mind healer?” Draco wasn’t offended. He knew Weasley would never accept him he was surprised Har.. Potter kept trying really.
“Horses Blaise. Can you believe them. have they not learned since second year?!” Draco complained, dramatically splayed over his lap and looking up. “I am disgusted.”
“Agreed.. Wednesday. Lets go for a run. I’m a little rusty and both our techniques could use some work. I don’t know what sort of sport they’re having us play but I doubt they’ll let us play with anyone but each other.. I say we call a truce for at least sports. In turn once a month all your Hogsmeade drinks are on me.. I want to win this.”
“Fine.” He didn’t dare challenge him to see if that was true. He hurried and got clean and dressed, tying his hair up as he walked out the door with Harry. Immediately going to Blaise who was sat in the common room looking worse for wear. Handing him a vail. “Drink up. How much did you have Blaise.” He scoffed, watching the other throw back the potion.
“Yet I am. Here’s the plan. You go first on stuff like the hops and climbing wall so I can help you up. we try to match pace as we run. Do this with me and you get to be a pissbaby after. Don’t ruin it.”
Draco nodded. “Sounds like a plan.” He said quietly. Smiling softly to himself as he made a slice to hand to Leigh who announced that if they were happy with their results they could deliver to her. She’d be grading their recipes over the afternoon with Anderson. Draco simply wished them luck judging 20 slices of bread but it would make for an easy grade.
He looked beside him… his father looked how he felt. His mother looked worse. She looked terribly thin, perhaps not as bad as when the dark lord had lived in their home but.. she knew what was coming too.. she was being held back from hugging him. He just curtly nodded at her. Trying to give her a tired smile.
Draco snorted in return, giving him a mock glare. “Shut up Potter. I’m matching Blaise. Shouldn’t you be off to find your date?”
The yule dress was much easier to find. a sparkly grey dress with a similar bodes and a lacey cape to go with it. When Hermoine tried to look at the tag it was snatched from her hand. Blaise and Draco both treating her to the dresses since she deserved a treat. She had flushed and made them promise to accept at least a butterbeer then.
“We did yes. Potter is set on winning whatever game we’ll be playing. I just play along. Good thinking on making him get me chocolate frogs anytime he wants something out on me. I’d say I owe you. but I’m forced to hang out with the chosen one. It’s a fair trade off.” Draco smirked at him.
They did end up making quite the mess when Harry grinned at Draco, slapping a flour covered hand onto Draco’s back. Draco had been avoiding all the dirty work. Only touching the dough when it was ready to be formed. His face twisting into something between anger and disgust. It earned Harry two flour hands on his chest as he pushed him back lightly.. all in all the were now covered in flour from head to toe.
“Hey.. hey now its alright.. I forgave you already remember. I wasn’t nice to you either. Clean slate. No need to apologize.” Harry said, his voice strangely calm while dealing with a drunk Draco.
“Ah come on Moine, let the lad have some fun. Come with us if you feel like babysitting.” Seamus huffed
“Git. I knew it.” Draco snickered. “You’re cold?  Do you need your coat back?” he asked softly, distracted again.
He closed his eyes, holding onto he pole… the made it. His shoes were only a little wet. “thank fuck..”
Potter showed him how he had conjured the fire. Closing his eyes. He seemed to light up, his fingers glowing as sparks spring from them, eventually turning into a bright fire. As bright as the others grin. Lighting up his face. He had to admit.. it was rather brilliant.
“No one. Shut up pans. I swear to god.” His eyes darted for a moment across the room towards Harry. Who happened to catch his eyes and flush lightly himself. oh merlin..
Dinner was absolutely gorgeous despite some of the treats being rather child themed. The 8th year class indulged in having some good wines with their food.
Potter seemed to have no shame. Popping on some shorts, above the knee, how sinful. “Ready Potter?” he asked tying his own hair back into a tiny palm tree bun. His hair had been getting a bit long, just passing his chin, but he couldn’t be bothered to cut it.
“Most unusual indeed… a powerful magic if over you. you’re more ridded with dark magic and hurt. But there is an overwhelming will to do good. To do better. You wish to heal others… more so than yourself, not a very Slytherin trait is it now.. You’ll be a seer.. a healer. Now off you go. Go meet your roommate.”
“Thanks I suppose.” Harry knew he was trying not to sound too pleased about it. But it was rather evident when he heard the pen click a few times next to him and caught Draco studying it before looking back up at their teacher.
“You’re nice. Did you know that? You’re so nice to me. Always. After everything I’ve done to you you’re so bloody nice…” he mumbled, pulling the coat closer around himself. oh no.. here came emotional overly clingy Draco. He knew that once this started it was hard to get out of.
Ofcourse. Zabini had been neutral. Not picking a side. Not that people didn’t blame him. He was still a Slytherin and he would be discriminated against either way.
Justin Finch-Fletchly and Stephen Cornfoot. A Hufflepuff and a Ravenclaw. Justin looked rather tired, a rather horrid look on his face as his roommate grinned at him. The prankster Hufflepuff must’ve been put in his place for once…
He plopped down. Soon being pulled into a discussion about plants, which got weirder the more they drank. He found himself chuckling. These two were absolutely hideous. But Draco found himself enjoying their company. They of course avoided deeper topics. But that was fine. They could talk about it later. For now it was just nice to not feel judged.
“Your element has nothing to do with your house. It is the core of your magic. You, stripped down beyond your personality. The traits I just named are traits you are likely to have. Your magic will be at its strongest when using magic based on the element you present and some of its base values. So for homework I would like you all to attempt to find your core. When you have found it, I want a paper on the values that do and do not match for you personally. Some self-reflection.” After that Anderson explained more about wandless magic. How little it was used in Norway because they viewed magic as something to only use when it was necessary. How their root beliefs were that magic was a gift from the gods. Harry found it all rather interesting. It was intriguing. He was rather excited about the class and eager to learn more. Which was rare for him.
Lastly Daphne Greengrass and Hannah Abbott, Slytherin and Hufflepuff, were both looking a mess. They had clearly fought. Daphne had always been fairly classy, but she was known to brawl if things didn’t go her way. She had been known as the Lion of Slytherin amongst them. Right now it seemed however… they had both lost.
If you want to feel free to leave a comment with tips or just general stuff! I'd love to hear of you guys!
After years of being mean to the elves.. they were so kind. He didn’t deserve that. but she brought him some joy. Something to look forward too. Right now she was teaching him how to bake a bread. Fussing over the details. She probably had had a child before. Or had been an elf raised as nanny. Either way she was doing a good job of distracting him from his thought about Hogwarts. Something he wasn’t looking forward too. the halls probably reeked of death and horrible memories.
He felt himself bent backwards in pain. Stinging hex, straight to the spine. It wasn’t as horrible as crucio. But damn was it horrible. He cussed under his breath as he reached for his wand while he sank to his knees. He was wide awake all of a sudden. Panic starting to grasp at him.
“I say we check out the stables. It’s warm and dry and he could be hiding out in there.. If he isn’t there lets take that bloody awful horse of yours out for a walk with us.” Draco said, walking up to the stables, truth be told over the few visits he’d paid the animal it had grown on him a little. She was a lot calmer than the crazy gelding Finnigan and Thomas had obtained.
He felt a hand on his shoulder. The guard from earlier had a rather sympathetic look in his eyes. One he didn’t deserve. One he felt like he could breathe a little better he kept his eyes on the floor. “I am guilty. You can send me to Azkaban. Or execute me now. It’s ok. I cannot live with the guilt. I will willingly undergo any punishment…” It came out as a whisper. A desperate whisper.
“If it happens again I’m having someone look into it. It could have been a onetime incident.” Good she didn’t know about the other one.
“I know its strange but.. I get it.. I want to help him. I know he’s trying. He deserves a chance too.. and if Draco Malfoy can reform and live in peace. Perhaps so can others.” Harry nodded.
“Impressive indeed.” He nodded, relaxing a little. It was good to have at least someone. “You might have to teach me that one. I only got in safe by being an hour early.”
He made Potter jump by suddenly standing in front of his spot on the counter. “I cleaned up the first round. Your turn. Goodluck with the saucepan. It’s stained pink.” Draco grinned cheekily.
“there you go.” He whispered, simply taking Harry’s hand again. Feeling the other untense at the touch again. “It really got you bad huh?” he whispered. Harry nodded as a reply. Putting the glass away again.
And hurt it did. It hurt so bad. He lost track of the amount of spells, punches and kicks. The sharp pain and deafening sound of his right forearm being broken. He could feel it snap. He felt every bit of pain but he couldn’t do anything. At this point he couldn’t even scream anymore. All he heard was the maniacal laughter of the demons that had decided to haunt him. Where was potter and his savior complex when you needed him? Where was he when you were being nearly beaten to death? Those were his last thoughts before he lost his consciousness, his vision turning black and the laughter turning into ringing, the pain turning into a buzz running though his body.
“I’m in Ron. Let’s ask the other 8 years too. it would be good!” Dean hummed, looking around the table.
He looked around. Helpless, anxious and full of fear. “Thinking you could hide from us Malfoy? We saw you stalking the halls alone today. Lucky for your puny little friends because they would’ve been next.” A deep, manly not student fitting voice said next to him. He tried to look at the figure next to him but he couldn’t turn his face.
He got into the shoes he was offered. Finally looking up. he wasn’t familiar with the man in front of him. But he probably hurt someone the man knew. A cousin, a niece, a brother, a sister or even just a child. He let out a shaky sigh. Holding his hands out to be cuffed again before he was dragged into court.
“Try pressing the button on top will you Malfoy.” He held up his own pen, clicking it. Watching Draco turn red when he realized he had been writing with a closed pen.
Harry took the liberty to sit on his bed across from him, clinging to his own drink, he had put a notebook next to himself and boy did Draco hope he was just going over some extra notes or a schedule..
He looked over to the other bed. Malfoy was fast asleep. One of the only moments he seemed at peace. No sneers or cold expressions crossing his face. Harry sighed softly. He liked the other. Far more than he should. He felt drawn to him. They had been on opposite sides. But.. it felt right to be around him. Harry felt himself relating to the other.. they both didn’t have a choice in the war. Harry was meant to be the savoir he couldn’t refuse. Draco was meant to be the enemy. Ruining things from the inside. He had failed his task and paid for it.
When he came back Harry had gathered his stuff to jump into the shower.. “Hey erm. Draco?” he said it so softly. Damnit.
“You are a free elf anyway Pip. Go on. Put it on. It’ll look nice with your dress.” He smiled, pointing to the self-made dress she was wearing. It wasn’t particularly well made. But she was proud of it.
Kinda lost track of what i was doing midway through this chapter, started another writing project, talked to my proofreaders for the book about some stuff and just got busy.
There was more grumbling… Don’t mess with leigh. Got it. They did their pushups before professor Anderson appeared n the field. Handing everyone a pole. “Field is set up. now today is a rather easy run. But I want all of you to keep your wands ready. If there is anything you don’t want to get wet.. take it off now. Before you loose it forever. Questions? No. Great. Just run straight forward. Watch out for your teammate.”
Ron had nodded along happily before following Harry’s gaze over to the table Malfoy had been dropped off at.
He hopped onto the bed, curling under the others arm. Keeping his breathing slow. Calm. Letting the others breathing even out to his own.
“Alright! Times up! Starting position!” Leigh called from the side of the line. Potter slapped the pole into his hand, he gripped it tightly, anxiety and adrenaline building up in his chest. Releasing as soon as he heard the booming starting shot.
For this recipe he didn’t write down the steps. He simply let Harry sit back and watch. If he wanted he could copy the recipe next time.
“So. What you do is.. you let the magic flow through you. Let it run though your veins. To me it feels like a burst of energy. I can barely contain it. It feels like a scream building up in my chest and then.. boom. Try focusing on that.” Harry said. His voice was low. Concentrated on the task at hand.
A few hours later. After breakfast they were all gathered on the field. Today they were starting at 10am. Dreadful time for a Sunday.
Hermoine grinned at them. “You’re getting better. Did you know that Dray?” She said, her grin turning into something more genuine. “More and more people can see it. You’re smiling more… hell.. you’re making others smile.” She whispered it, not sure if he wanted others to hear. “I never thought I’d say this.. but I’m glad you’re here. I’m glad I get to be friends with you now.”
He looked at his mother. She opened her arms to him. He fell into them. she rarely hugged him… but it felt safe. It felt so much better. He didn’t put up a mask anymore. There was the clicking of camera’s. He didn’t bother with them. he just clung to his mother. Sobbing with her. He had never dared to believe this.. he had never dared to believe he would be allowed to live after all he did.
She did as told and he pulled out the little box from his pocket, carefully placing it in her teeny hands with deinty fingers.
“Thank you.” was the stuffed reply he got. He could feel the shirt of his pjs getting damp. He didn’t mind. If anyone deserved a good fucking cry it was Harry. He didn’t comment on it. He didn’t ridicule him.
He silently gathered his stuff. Walking through the door with Potter no problem. Mostly no problem as Draco simply refused to even look at him or touch him and with Potters rather broad frame this seemed to pose a slight problem.. but they managed. The others seemed to figure this out as well.
He smirked to himself as Amour managed to outsprint Merlin, short for Merlin’s saggy balls as Weasley had named the horse, every time. He could imagine the laughter coming from the two guys racing each other. he sighed softly. Feeling a ease once more. Things were looking up. things were happy today.
“Alright. how about we just start doing those morning runs today. It’s rather early and perhaps it’ll help clear up your mind.. it’s fine if you’d rather not though…”
“Well then.. that’s..” He muttered to himself. making his way to the bar. Awkwardly sitting himself down. “Firewhiskey. Big glass. Don’t bother with shots.” He muttered to the bartender halfheartedly. Paying as he got his glass, of which he threw back half immediately. Swallowing the burning liquor.
“Sleep like this thank you, I’m already asking enough of you, one last favor to add to the tally.” Came muffled from his chest, making him snort.
“You’ll have to learn as we go.” Draco hummed, walking up to him and holding his hand out, acting more confident than he felt.
Two weeks had passed since then. Today was the day. He was going back to Hogwarts. His mother was allowed to the train. But Draco advised her against it. People weren’t going to be kind. People weren’t going to be friendly. He was fully ready to block any curse thrown his way. Which he assumed would be a lot.
Granger’s eyes grew big before they glazed over. She straightened up.  Anderson muttered something else. something about Grangers future and her being meant for great things, he managed to catch the word earl... She seemed to take in the words before disappearing through the door to the female dorms.
By the time they entered said class everyone was excited. They were indeed starting at the basics. Bread. The recipe was slightly different from what Draco usually did. But they were told to use their own recipe’s if they had any. They were also asked to make something to go with the bread. This ranged from eggs to butter to whatever they pleased. There were recipe’s posted for wizards cheese (which took about 40 minutes instead of months to cure).
I've been hit by quite the writers block. Depression is a bitch and I gotta stop hanging out with her.
“Ah.. I dreamed something about a cat last night. Must’ve been someone’s pet sensing my nightmares.” Harry shrugged it off. Taking note of how Draco’s expression relaxing.
Next up was the pole slide. A high fence they had to get on top of, with several thick poles going down, on the end there was a jump to the next pole. Again they matched each other’s beat pretty much perfect. There was another shot. Mandy and Sally had fallen in between the poles. “I can’t believe were actually doing well.” Potter panted besides him.
“Prepare to be blown away. Salt and sweet is honestly the most perfect combination.” Draco hummed, putting a quick charm over the bread that kept it fresh and kept it from being too hot to eat.
Overall it was a rather tiring experience. But Harry was a good coach, Draco had to admit that. Working with Draco’s abilities and not complaining whenever he slowed down. He simply matched his speed, gave some tips and with some banter inspired him to go on.
“I’ll wait for you two. Go get cleaned up its nearly dinner time.” Draco grinned, suddenly even more glad for team captain Potter.
Draco was the one to nod this time. Getting his stuff ready for class and leaving for the common room where he was taken away by Pansy.
“It’ll be fine Draco, come on. He’s a real softie. He won’t lay a finger on you. At least it wasn’t the Weasley. My room borders his.. you should’ve heard him going last night. A true mess. Longbottom kept apologizing for his behavior till I asked him about the plants he brought.”
“Very good!” Anderson said, signing for them to sit back down. “Do keep in mind that there is nothing wrong with not finding your element right away. It takes a lot of energy and knowing yourself plays a big part.” He said, spelling a piece of chalk to write some things down.
When he walked back into the room smelling faintly of honey almond soaps and in a fresh set of clothes he found Harry staring at him with soft eyes. He still had some tear stains on his face but there was a healthy glow to him. Like having the cat at night had taken a weight off of him.
“You always are. I was asking if you wanted to grab something from the kitchen and get to the charms paper due Tuesday.” Blaise snorted. There was a comment he was wanting to make about what Draco was distracted by.. but even he knew it was best to avoid poking a sleeping dragon.
There was some complaining. Draco felt his heart sink into his shoes. No. he really didn’t want to do this. First of all he had very little stamina. He used to be quite avid on being fit. But the past few years had been horrible for his health… then second of all he had to do this with Potter, as much as Draco love to hate on him and avoid him.. winning a war had done him good and he was likely at peak performance.
as he was writing he remembered the dream after. Sitting by the fire in the common room. Some kind of animal by his side he was patting softly. He remembered the soft purs.. must have been some sort of cat. He felt peaceful. Glad his dreams managed to provide something to ground him and calm him down.
“How about this then?” Draco pulled out a black dress with an open back. The bottom was made with flowy lace and the top had lacey sleeves.
He was a little taken aback, but carefully took her hand. “I’m glad you’re willing to give me the chance at redeeming myself even in the slightest. I’ll do everything to avoid disappointing your trust in me.” She smiled in reply. Squeezing his hand. Before letting go. Their conversation turning to other pleasant things. Pansy left them at some point to go pester someone else.
They got over the fences no problem. But then the first challenge came up. He sensed the illusion charms. A giant shadowy dog came at them. Growling deep. “Stay put Draco. It can’t hurt you” he called, watching the other freeze up.
He was fast asleep, tail in his mouth, white and grey fur stained with blood from the cuts, his right leg horribly swollen and head resting in Harry’s chest. “That’s not a tiger potter. That’s a snow leopard.. I have no bloody idea how one of those could get into the school or even in the country. It must be a creature as you said. Perhaps you should visit the oaf… I mean Hagrid about it?” he suggested. “I’ll put some tracking spells out. We can look tomorrow? I don’t think I’ll be fit to run but we can go for a walk. Visit the horse and try and see where its hiding out.”
It was a herd of Fjords. Larger than your average fjord horse. They probably were mixed with some other creature.
“come on. Everyone is going. Even Hermoine.” Pansy elbowed him in the ribs, earing herself another glare. She could be quite annoying. Truly.
He snorted, hugging the elf. “Mister Draco sir. How are you doing?” pip asked, trying to fix the mess Blaise had made of his hair.
Draco didn’t feel far off from losing his own mind. Their faces.. they kept flashing in front of his eyes. He didn’t know when the last time was he had gotten a decent sleep. He wasn’t in Azkaban yet. But he knew he’d be there soon. He was hoping to go emotionally numb as soon as possible, die shortly after. That was all there was left in him.
“You alright there bud?” Harry asked suddenly, looking at him with a raised eyebrow. Draco blinked at him. Only now realizing that.. what he was doing must have looked like he was checking the other out. He wasn’t of course. He was a Malfoy. He wasn’t gay… Potter just had some nice features he could admire and appreciate.
Draco snorted. “I’ll leave you two to talk on how you’re getting Hermoine to the ball without Weasley spotting her.” He hummed. Snagging his suit and hurrying to the shower before Harry could snag it. He came out 40 minutes later, wearing a deep red suit with a black button up under it and rather tight pants. A dark brown cloak to his knees to match and a chestnut colored mink on his shoulders. He knew the red implicated something else but.. he and Blaise were matching and Red was a color that looked good on them. really good. He popped on a little make up, just to hide the bags under his eyes, a little red under his eyelids, blush to make his cheeks look less pale and a little mascara to darken his lashes, surely no one could blame him for that.
He always remembered his dreams quite vivid. He decided to write this one down. He used to keep a log incase any of his dreams were connected to real world events like they used to when Voldemort was still out there. It was a habit he couldn’t break.
Draco snorted, shooing them off and taking his book. Finding a spot on a sofa in the common room. Everyone was too busy showering and cleaning up. he was safe for now, but he kept his wand close, just incase Weasley decided to come for his ass.
Hermoine had told him he shouldn’t assume whether the other was or wasn’t gay, not how the world would act upon it.
“She’s a good elf. she just appeared one day and hasn’t left. Impossible to rid of.. trust me I’ve tried.” Draco said, leaning against his friend as he watched the elves through the small door behind the painting. Blaise didn’t seem to mind how touchy feely he was today and if he did.. he wasn’t bringing it up.
“Wasn’t too hungry Pans. I was setting up a proper schedule to get through my time. Besides the ministry would love to see I am actually making an effort.” He shrugged, following his friends to the fields, making some small talk about what in the hell this exercise would be. knowing Hogwarts.. probably outrageous and deadly..
They spend some time with her. Even taking her out to brush her, which Harry seemed to know how to do properly. Amour didn’t seem too phased by anything they did.
Without really thinking he snuggled into it. Muttering something about warm. He barely noticed Harry making some excuses and saying his goodbyes, he managed a small wave when he walked out.
“For Merlins sake Ron. I cannot keep up with you. its team work, not Gryffindor takes the lead and drags you through the damn pit!”
“Finally I would like to ask those who are in the 8th year class to stay behind after the dinner… now let us eat!”
Wednesday Draco and Blaise headed into Hogsmeade with some special permission of McGonagall. Hermoine walking in between them. Blaise had taken some effort to style he hair up. nothing too fancy but it would help with the dress picking. “What do you say Blaise? Red? Black?”
“So. I heard you and Potter went to train by the lake huh?” Blaise asked, putting more mashed potatoes on Draco’s plate. He had taken Pansy’s side on making Draco eat more. Filling his plate every time he managed to empty it till the food vanished.
“You and your teammate will be going through this. Your sight will be impaired and there will be new obstacles. To avoid anyone getting hurt by a misused spell in panic. You’ll be going one team at the time and there are wards put in place to keep you from using anything dangerous. The challenge is easy. Get through and you’ll be escorted to the next challenge with professor Anderson.” Leigh hummed. Pointing to Draco and him. “You two are up first.” She grinned. Pushing them towards the mist.
“Nah nah you earned it. Come on. I’ll protect you.” Somehow those last three words… hit him differently. They made him smile unwillingly.
“You didn’t.. I didn’t know what the curse did as I cast it.” Potter uttered, putting a hand on his shoulder. “I thought I killed you.. I regret it.”
“Will do.” Harry nodded. “I’ll let you get your sleep then. Sleep well Draco.. and..” he seemed hesitant to say the next part, closing his mouth as if deciding against it before opening it again. “..I won’t let you get hurt like that again. You’re my friend now whether you want to be or not. Hermoine and I will look out for you too. Ron will come around too..” before Draco could reply. He disappeared into the shower. His chocolate untouched.
“You know some healing spells? I refuse to go to Pomphrey’s. I don’t want anyone to hear of this.” Malfoy uttered, not refusing when Blaise stayed silent. Just pulling him into a careful hug.
“We should try riding her  this week too. how about we try Friday afternoon. No one will be around due to the study group.” Harry said, leading the horse back to the field. Draco looked at him like he’d just told him the moon was made of cheese.
Draco pretended to think for a moment. “Deal. Can you believe this man is not a Slytherin?” he asked, looking at Longbottom. Who burst into laughter.
Blaise reluctantly picked out a band. So did Oliver, Neville, Potter, Weasley and the lot of them. Draco could already hear yelling come from the boys quarters. It made his heart sink.
“Hmm I can’t believe my eyes, you two hanging out and not nearly murdering one another.” Blaise said. Now adding some more veggies to the plate.
“Did you happen to catch the notice?” Draco looked up, realizing he hadn’t been listening to potter rambling about how this leopard really was something special and how it had in fact contributed to his good sleep. No he had missed that completely.
“Now that I have your proper attention.. No mr Finnigan you can stay down.. Today were working on trusting your roommate.” She paced in front of them. “Getting rid of old values, creating understanding. Do not get me wrong. I know this is going to take more than one exercise and not all of you will succeed in forming a proper bond… but it I think it will be worth it.”
He felt a kick to the back of his knee, making him drop down. He caught himself on the floor with his hands.
Before he could yell at her to shut up he was surrounded by none other that Blaise, Pansy, Hermoine and Potter himself. each asking him what happened and trying to fuss.
“I suppose. But cheaper. Here.” Harry held it out to him. Getting himself another one from his bag. Thankful he had bought a 20 pack before leaving to Hogwarts. Draco took it hesitantly, bringing it to his notebook and scribbling something on the side.
Again Draco just leaned into his touch so easily. Maybe he was drunk and just seeing things that weren’t.
“Hmm?” he muttered, not willing to open his eyes. “We got you some dinner darling. You’ve been asleep all afternoon and Potter has been guarding you like a dog. Telling us you’d need the sleep after whatever happened.”
“It’s alright.” He felt the others hands on his own, squeezing gently. “how about I try to channel it with you? So you can feel what its like?” he sounded gentle. Still with the same low and concentrated voice from earlier.
He didn’t know when he drifted off. Probably around the time Harry had started lazily talking about wanting to see magic in other places. The others yawning had only made him sleepier.
Eventually he got a hold of himself. Grabbing his wand with his left arm and casting a tempus. It was nearly 3am. Perfect. Without thinking he transfigured himself into the small snow leopard. The little creature was a little tougher than he was and he managed to use his right arm despite the pain.
“I’ll move it to the morning. I was thinking of doing that either way.” He said, elbowing her softly.
They returned to the common room just fine. Putting down the plate and each taking a bun. The rest of the 8th years soon gathered around them to grab a bun too. Pip seemed to have known this would happen because soon two more plates as well as a tray of tea and tea cups began to appear. What was supposed to be studying before dinner turned into cozy tea time, making Draco feel warm and fuzzy inside. Since when did that happen? Since when did Hogwarts start feeling more and more like home again?
It was honestly the best he’d made. The crust was nice and hard, but the middle was perfectly fluffy, the seeds added some extra texture the jam was a bit sweet and sour, the butter could’ve used a bit more salt but it was honestly the best he’d made so far.
He cut them both a slice and put a thick layer of butter on before spreading some of the now cold jam on it. He handed one to Harry, smirking as he toasted his own slice against it. “bon Appetit.” He hummed before taking a bite.
“We won’t kill you. not on purpose. We’ll just punish you. like you punished us last year. Like the ministry refuses to do for you.” the voice spoke again.
“Everyone deserves to have someone that’s nice to them. you do, I do. Everyone does.” Harry said back, leading him though the shack and into the basement where a riggedy old tunnel was.
Sunday training had gotten more intense. But thanks to Potter they seemed to catch up pretty easy. This week they’d change things up seeing as most roommates seemed to have at least an idea on how to work together. Hell. They all got along well enough to study together and help one another with difficult subjects.
Bake bread at 200c for 35 minutes after rising, its ready to bake when you poke it and it bounces back.
It had been hard at first. Admitting he was bisexual. He didn’t even know it was a thing until Hermoine had told him and that it was ok to have a thing for guys. Later she had admitted seeing what had been happening between him and Draco and he had ended up crying softly onto her shoulder. He’d just been trying to be friendly with the guy. He knew Draco wasn’t gay.. and even if he was… It could never work right? the world would judge them for being Gay and who they were, they would judge Draco even more and say he was manipulating Harry. Destroy him with words and from all the talks they had had… He didn’t want that for him. all he wanted was for Draco to be happy, with or without him. he would have to settle for just friends as hard as that was starting to seem.
It didn’t take them long to make him pass out. He didn’t exactly know how long he was out. But long enough for it to be dark and for Blaise to find him. “My god what have they done to you love.” Blaise uttered.
“Must’ve been. As long as it stays on your side of the room.” He huffed, gathering his stuff to dress up for sports later.
“Yeah.” Draco replied. Grabbing it from the little cubby in his nightstand. “What time is it?” he asked, handing one over. Did they do talking in the morning now? Apparently.
Excited conversation sparking amongst the group. Draco found his company with Blaise, knowing full well he’d loose the guy as soon as he found something. Not that Draco blamed him. He did however feel his heart sink a little when Blaise left him the second they entered the three broomsticks.
“McGonagall said nothing about just beating the shit out of you did she now? You want to know what your father did to my mum for marrying a muggle?” the perpetrator spat at him, the hex was released, traded for a wand pressed into his ribs. “Get up were taking a little walk.” The female voice hissed into his ear.
He stepped out, finding Blaise and Pansy in the Common room. “Ready?” he asked, giving them a small smile. Walking to class should be alright.. right?
By the time they returned to their dorms it was quite late. Bellies full of food, laughter and alcohol. Draco went a little earlier than the rest of the 8th years whom had settled on having an afterparty despite it being nearly 1:30 am.
“I’m getting flashbacks to the last creature I was forced to make friends with and I do not approve.” Draco muttered. Not looking away from the horse that had already approached them.
“I do stand with Malfoy here Harry. You are very dramatic when you hit the dancefloor.” Ron snickered, stealing the bottle from him.
“Today were gonna start on a little parkour. You are to hold these..” she held up a small pole “… at al times. One hand loose and you’re starting over. First to finish is dismissed earlier. A boys team and girls team, since talents will diverge.”
“Whatever.” Draco looked away, letting the other get his buttons undone. He froze when he looked back. Potter was staring at the scars wrapped around his chest. Starting at his right hip and wrapping around him all the way up to his throat. He instantly tried to move away. But found himself frozen in place. Carefully and slowly Harry reached out. Tracing one of the lines across his chest. He opened his mouth.
Draco paled a little next to Harry. The thought of this.. friendship ending so soon. To lose harry, whom he was trusting more and more.. it scared him. He knew this offer wasn’t for him. He had to finish the year and he wouldn’t want it differently. He had lost nearly two years of studying and he was far from ready to face the world outside.
“What’s a supermarket?” Draco asked, taking out a piece of parchment and writing down the steps. He found it easier to write them down so he wouldn’t forget any. He’d found that especially after the war he was a bit confused and forgetful at times.
Harry took it, letting himself be pulled up, hooking their arms. “Let’s go give them a show then.” Now it was Draco’s turn to flush lightly. He hadn’t expected Harry to treat him as his date. What would the others think. Only the 8th years really knew they got along pretty well… he could ruin Harry’s reputation. Maybe this was a bad idea…
Cozy tea time soon turned into cozy forgetting-about-dinner-time. It was around 8 pm. Long after dinner had ended when Finnigan loudly complained about being hungry. Someone cast a tempus charm yelling the time.
There was some rustling. Potter seemed to have accepted and so did the others as they all got up. Draco managed to hide behind a chair just in time. Nearly yelping at the pain shooting though his right paw. Right.. be careful now.
You see it was a family secret. All Malfoy’s had to become animagus. They had a talent for it and if he hadn’t been his father’s son he would have probably failed and left to die alone and an abomination in the woods.
That being sad, he was far better looking than ever before. He’d grown out of his lanky stage a while ago. He was starting to fill out. The tan he’d gotten over summer had stayed, it rather suited him. It did help that Draco had gotten the privilege of getting to know the other better. One might say he was really starting to care for Harry Potter. Not that he could admit that.
He choked. “What kind of question is that?” he asked, turning to her fully now. Unable to keep a light flush from coloring his cheeks. The position he had been in this morning.. sure could have been compromising.
“I knew you wouldn’t believe me. Which is why I asked Colin for his camera this morning. No one else has seen it. I trust you not to tell anyone else. Hermoine would go to McGonagall and Ron would just laugh. I think it’s a magical creature appearing to me like this or something. It isn’t a patronus because.. Just look at it.”
Hermoine flushed slightly. “Only if its not too much effort. I would like to impress him.” She whispered, looking past Draco at her Boyfriend.
His eyes met with Potters next. Who gave him a short nod. Draco opened his mouth but the “I owe you my life” never left his lips. Potter seemed to understand and shook his head. Mouthing what seemed to be a “You deserve it.” He seemed to want to say more. But Draco and Narcissa were escorted out of the court. Brought to Malfoy manor.. a horrific and dreadful place.
He nearly drooled at the sweet smell coming from the pot. When it was done he spread the contents over the two jars. Sealing them off and putting them under a cooling spell.
“We have 10 minutes. Everyone get in. just follow the hallway.” Potter called. Everyone was quick to get in. Potter came in last, they tree coming back into motion shortly after.
