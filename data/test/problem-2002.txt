“Funny you should mention that I worked for Florean while I was studying to be a Mediwizard.” Grant teased grabbing the shake since Bellatrix had her hands full with potions.
“You healed me, besides it was the least I could do, you did fight alongside us and tried to save Percy.” Harry whispered the last part. “I guess there’d be no harm in having a drink with you, you’re actually quite pleasant to be around when you don’t sling insults.” Harry teased lightly writing down his cell number on a piece of parchment. “I’d assume with you spending most of your time in the muggle world that’d you have a cell.” He told the blonde wizard leaning against the counter.
“Sorry mate, it was just really funny is all.” Ron said patting Harry’s shoulder. “I almost forgot I’m getting drinks with the twins later, want to join?” He asked thinking that Harry needed to do something other than stay at home and raise Teddy. “Mum can have Teddy sleep over, you know she loves him.”
The happy couple entered through one of the green St. Mungo’s fireplaces and emerged gracefully in their large home in Croydon which was a borough of London. Their home had recently been redone and was a seven bedroom and five bedroom house along with an indoor swimming pool right next to the house. “How about a glass of wine and a quick soak in the hot tub while I talk about my idea?” Bellatrix suggested kicking of her sneakers which disappeared back to her shoe rack in the closet thanks to a house elf.
“Harry here has a broken wrist. Dumbledore sent me to find out why he wasn’t responding to the owls and his family pushed him against the wall when they learned of the news. It’s early and I didn’t want to wake Poppy and I didn’t want Dumbledore to be mad that I failed the assignment.” Hagrid said a small tear rolling down his cheek; he felt bad for the child in his arms.
Umbridge smirked at the child. “This is now mine; you don’t deserve comfort you freak.” She snarled kicking the bed and leaving the room on light full blast. She had looked over his notes she doubted he was even abused but rather didn’t like being punished. She thought children his age did best with punishment after all how else were they to know they did something wrong.
Grant knocked on the door to the room they were using. “Healer Reid, I have Minerva McGonagall wishing to speak to Dumbledore.” He said an amused tone in his voice wishing he could stay and witness what McGonagall had to say to Dumbledore. She was not a happy woman and had basically chewed his ear about what an idiot Dumbledore was.
“Good to know you like bubblegum.” She teased banishing the empty phial to get cleaned before its next use. “How about I get you into something clean?” She asked gesturing to his dirty jumper and jeans that were stained with grass, mud, and whatever else. She grabbed a navy hospital gown for the cabinet.
“Again, as we have said we need official documentation from either The Ministry or Gringotts Bank. So, until we have the documentation we can add to his file, you will not be getting any information out of Healer Reid, myself, or any staff member at St. Mungo’s. We take privacy here very seriously. Now do you have any other questions, or can Healer Reid and I get back to our patients?” She said with a bite to her words. They had explained it several times already and she was quickly losing her patience with Dumbledore.
Harry bleakly opened his eyes to find that he was missing the blanket, the room lights were ridiculously bright and the nurse in pink scrubs was holding Lily the Dragon. “What?” He asked his voice muffled from the pillow.
Kieran smiled at the child and sat the hospital gown down on the bed. “I’m going to put a small brace around your wrist to help keeps things stable while I check everything else. Due to previous breaks, I can’t just fix your wrist, I’m going to have to magically rebreak some other wrist bones and mend everything back together. Now depending what the health scan says there is a good chance you have other breaks or other issues so I can sedate you when it comes to fixing everything.” He said softly casting the spell for the wrist brace.
“I think I might try the Avocolada, I’m not sure how I feel about egg in my cocktail.” Harry said making a face at the thought. “Who’s Olivia?” He questioned he was sure Draco had said he was single yesterday.
Harry wondered if he should tell Ron, Hermione, and Neville that he had plans later. “I actually do have plans for later tonight.”
Bellatrix sighed once they were safely out of earshot. “I hate this. How could anyone do that to a child.” She said angrily. “Now Dumbledore will try to interfere because he’s a bloody imbecile and thinks child abuse is never as bad and it is the child making things up. I swear he is the worst Headmaster.”
“Harry.” Kieran sighed slightly curious about the liver issue. “You mentioned Paracetamol earlier, what is the typical dose you take?” He asked knowing that Paracetamol could overtime cause liver damage which ultimately could lead to liver failure.
“No sneaking out.” Bellatrix said firmly to the child before looking at her husband and sighed. “Let’s get this meeting over with.”
“Damn those muggles.” Bellatrix cursed leaning her back against the desk her arms crossed over her chest. She wanted to visit Surry and hex those muggles with a curse only someone in the Black family could muster.
Bellatrix laughed softly at herself seeing how angry Minerva was towards Dumbledore. “Hello Professor McGonagall. Both Elara and Rigel are doing great, they love summer, but I know they are ready to get back to Hogwarts and Elara is thrilled to be joining her brother this year. I take it you two have things you’d like to discuss.”
“You two are terrible when it comes to your betting.” Kieran remarked not that he’d do anything about it. He found it vaguely entertaining. “We figured as much, probably was hoping to go searching for information regarding someone. He’s not exactly cunning.” He teased with a wink. “The kiddo is asleep don’t suppose you have a quick Quidditch injury I could heal before I go make sure he has dinner and make him comfortable for the night?
Bellatrix left the room and marched over to the station. “Umbridge you and I need to have a conversation. I suggest you come with me before you learn why you should not anger a Black.” She said pointing her wand at the other Mediwitch. “Regulus said he found the dragon toy over here in the trash. That leads me to believe you did something to my patient.”
Theseus opened his private office and transfigured a table into a chair since he wasn’t used to having several people in his office. He also cast a quick ‘Muffliato’ on his door. “So, want to explained what happened, or do you want to hear what I see?” He questioned sounding rather pleasant, and there was nothing more terrifying than a pleasant Scamander.
He opened the door to his office and tossed the balled-up note into the trash bin and set in on fire and watched the note burn. He grabbed his wand from the holster attached to his belt and pointed his wand at the small fire in the trash bin. “Aguamenti.” He watched the jet of water douse the fire. He placed his wand back into the holster.
“It’s alright, I just got back from Birmingham.” She sighed shoving her fork roughly into the salad covered in raspberry vinaigrette. “I wish you boys weren’t on suspension the one helping me was practically useless.”
Harry rolled over so Kieran had access to his back. He remembered the burn paste from earlier. It felt cool against his hot skin around the burn from Vernon’s fire poker. The application didn’t hurt other than the initial coldness against his skin.
He remembered how depressed Severus was when he learned of James and Lily’s death and Dumbledore’s news that they couldn’t adopt Harry because the old wizard thought that whoever had murdered James, Lily, and Sirius might be after baby Harry and that they couldn’t find Sirius’s Will.
“I’m sorry I have no idea why you would like to speak to about. I’m also confused as to why a Mind Healer is here at such an hour. The patients are perfectly fine and well.” She remarked looking down at her lapel watch.
“He would sneer if I missed a spot, remembering all the cauldron cleanings?” Ron teased remembering all his detentions with the resident dungeon bat. “I know on a couple detention days McGonagall had to come find me worried about the length of some of my detentions.” Ron teased putting his Auror robes back on. “Let’s go then lads.” He suggested knowing Hermione would be waiting for them.
“Why is someone eager to see Tatiana again?” Ron teased playfully elbowing Harry as the trio made their way to the elevator to take them to the second floor so they could get yelled at by a terrifying Auror.
Bellatrix smirked at her husband of course Regulus would bring the boy a dragon. It wasn’t like the name on his wrist was the Latin word for dragon or anything. “Harry.” Bellatrix began waiting for Harry to turn his attention to her. “Kieran and I are going to step out for a moment and give you and Regulus a few moments to talk alone.”
Kieran groaned internally he hated child abuse cases especially these types of child abuse cases where the parent was so against the idea of magic that they took to abuse to get the child to fall in line.
“Harry.” Kieran began softly trying to broach the topic of abuse gently. The diagnostic x-ray spell would not lie and the evidence in his hand was damning towards abuse and it was just a wrist. He couldn’t imagine what the rest of the body was hiding under those baggy clothes.
Kieran smirked at his wife’s lecture aimed at Dumbledore’s lack of proper respect. “Headmaster, St. Mungo’s policy states that we require documentation on Magical Guardianship so if you don’t mind providing us an official copy from either The Ministry of Magic, or Gringotts Bank with the official seal. We’d be more then happy to provide you with information regarding the patient in question medical care.”
“Wait how do you know that stuff?” Harry asked noticing that Draco suddenly sounded less like a Healer and more like a muggle doctor. “I find Skele-Gro to taste of Goblin Piss.” He was honest he hated that time in second year in which that idiot Lockhart had banished his bones.
Andromeda rolled her blue eyes knowing that he was lying. “Just be careful please.” She said getting off the couch to hug him tightly. “I’ll see you soon.” She said hugging her grandchild. “Remember that I love you both.” She watched Harry lead Teddy into the fireplace and the two disappear into green smoke.
Soon Harry was being led out of the meeting room, Neville holding his hand in a vise-like grip and Madam Longbottom leading the way. His mind was whirling, analyzing all his interactions with the Potions Master.
Until I am healthy again I will be posting shorter chapters more sporadically, I hope you all understand.
Rowena and Helga were cuddled up on the love seat in their painting, Rowena reading and Helga braiding the other women’s waist length hair. He had seen this scene so many times of their years together, and it made him long for those days. They had been so idealistic, dreaming of a day when all races could live together in harmony. For the first time in over two thousand years, Godric was glad Salazar was still asleep, out of all of them he had always been the optimist of them all, something anyone to hear the false stories of him wouldn’t believe. When Hogwarts was built the ambition Salazar prized was the ambition to make a better life for oneself and all those around you. He would hate the twisted thing his house became. And Godric hated the moment he would have to see Sal found all of this out, but he knew it would happen. Hated that the spark would go out of his friend’s eyes.
So this chapter has no Harry so I hope you are all okay with that. Fawkes is revealed though so I hope that makes up for it.
“Issy, dear, will you set Harry down so we can do a quick scan? I’m sure he’s fine but I know we would all feel better with the double check.” Anna’s voice was soft as she started to corral Issy towards the dining room table.
Severus went to the only place he knew he might be safe, surprised the wards around the manor gave him entry, dropping him off right in front of the main doors. Before he could knock a tall man opened the door. A man Severus had only seen in passing for the last eighteen years. A man he had once considered his best friend.
Neville’s hands moved faster, head of his cock an angry purple and drool dripping from between his fingers. And with one last erratic thrust of his hips he was cumming, Harry’s name a muffled scream as all the muscles in his body tensed, knees locking up and toes curling against the cold floor.
“Sal, please listen to me, I wish we could kill him, I truly do. But it’s not so simple.” Godric tried.
Anna sounded just as furious as Harry, but she hid it better, clutching onto her son, trying to comfort them both. “But you, Mr. Dumbledore, were Harry’s self-proclaimed Magical Guardian. When he came to you with accusations of abuse, it was your job to take care of him, both as his Guardian and as Chief Warlock. But obviously, you did nothing to investigate these claims.” Anna snapped.
He hissed into the silence of the cabin. Dumbledore threw the letter onto the table, the other pages scatter across the table. But then Albus noticed a piece of paper that was glowing. When he touched it the paper unfolded, paper golden. Until then he hadn’t seen the crest that was on the letter, the wax seal facing down. But there at the top of the paper was the intricate crest of Lady Magic. He instinctively flinched back from the innocent looking piece of paper, the magic on it humming its displeasure at his touch.
“How dare you hurt my Godfather!” Harry screamed, standing over Sirius protectively, magic bubbling out of him like boiling water.
David just allowed him to cry, not commenting beside the occasional comforting hum. Hands over his back and arms, cupping the nape of his neck and running his fingers through his hair every once and awhile.
Harry eased his pants down. Keeping his eyes locked onto the ceiling until he was fully undressed, finally looking back into the mirror. There he stood, naked as the day he was born, and all Harry could do was blush. He had never looked at himself like this before, always quick to change and shower, never lingering around without clothes. But now he looked. Looked at his slender feet, toes curling unconsciously into the soft carpet, his ankles, and his too thin deer-like legs.
The remaining box was much larger than the last about two foot tall and a foot wide. What worried Harry most was that there were air holes, the only thing that kept him from freaking out entirely was there was no noise coming from it.
Arthur had to hide his giggle at Molly’s outraged look in a cough, as she cursed at the owl who was already long gone. She ripped open the envelope, going white as she read and then rushed out through the floo without a word.
They were all now fully dressed and soon headed down to the morning room to eat breakfast. The room stuck out from the main house, three of its four walls covered with ornate glass panels along with the roof, letting in the soft morning sun and looking out onto the magnificent gardens. One of the windows was open, letting in the sweet scent of the Juliet roses and morning dew.
And now, with Harry’s soft hand on his face, he felt that same need again. He had only barely been able to force it down when Harry had rolled over, mouth right above his cock and warm breath from his groan almost too much to handle. The noise by itself was pornographic enough to turn him on.
Harry sputtered, “But I have heard you swear on your life?!” Harry nearly screeched towards the end, looking over at Bartok in shock that the man had risked such a thing.
Remus also recognized Bartok as one of the most well-known lawyers for creature rights, which also eased his worry. He wondered if the man might consider taking on Sirius’ case, it would be something he would have to bring up later.
Albus gathered his superiority around him like one of his magnificent robes and strode towards the gate. Before he could get within ten feet of the ornate gates, the gargoyles jumped down from their perches, their growl like the sliding of rocks down a stony hill.
The trail of hair down to his pelvic bone was thick, and his cock so hard that it was sticking almost straight up from his body the only deviation was the slight curve to the left, foreskin completely retracted and precum making the skin slick.
“I think- I’m gay,” Harry finally said, whispering out into the silent room, confession muffled by Sirius’ skin. But this was it. The first time he said it out loud, and even though he knew it was preposterous to think Sirius and Remus would react badly, considering they were together, Harry couldn’t help but try to shrink back. Considering he was still in Sirius lap, it wouldn’t do much of anything if they decided to react badly.
Harry didn’t know what to do; all he could do was reach out and grip the cuff of his Papa’s sleeve and hold on to him. He needed someone to keep him grounded.
“It’s not your fault, son,” Bartok unfurled his wings, pulling them back into his body. As soon as her path to Harry was clear, Issy was removing him from her mates arms so that she could hold him against her chest, pressing kisses to every inch of skin on his face.
Questions like this assaulted him every time he thought about the portraits, but for Sirius… for Sirius, he would gladly go down to the vaults to retrieve them. Harry could only hope that it hadn’t been one of the things Dumbledore stole.
White petals with elegant streaks of lavender and red, the edges of each petal a glittering gold. Harry was shocked at this feat of magic, so much so that when Neville tenderly placed the flower in Harry’s hair between his two sets of ears that he didn’t know what to say. Neville just pressed forward, foreheads resting together momentarily before he pulled back.
Augusta didn’t back down, her eyes were still steely as her eyes bored into them both. Godric spoke up to break the tension since he knew if left to it, the two would spend hours in their stare down. “I know this is a touchy subject for everyone involved, but I promise on my life and magic we will wait until they have turned seventeen to participate in any sexual relationships with our younger bondmates.” The golden light that flashed around both Godric and Salazar caused Augusta to relax back into her seat, finally taking back up her teacup and sipping contentedly.
In truth, dying when she did was the best thing that could have happened, Godric just wished it would have been more humane. He was also glad that Salazar wasn’t there at the time. The other man would have come to the same conclusion, it would have killed him inside, but Sal would have wanted to be the one to put her out of her misery.
Harry listened to the two brothers talk for about an hour, mostly just enjoying the tight hold his Daddy had on him and the comfort of his blanket and teddy. They discussed the Courts, Siles workshop, and his schooling. He learned that the man was attending the Arthur Technical Institute for a degree in Business Management. They also talked about their other siblings and what was going on in their lives.
“You are no longer welcome here,” the gargoyle on the left said, shocking Dumbledore that the things had been animated to speak.
“Mrs. Claremore, I know you might not understand this, but I am a very busy man, and when Mr. Potter arrived at Hogwarts, he seemed perfectly fine. I had no reason to worry about him returning to his relatives care.” Dumbledore tried to defend himself, but they could all see just how weak it was. It almost didn’t even warrant a reply.
Anna checked the time, seeing it was almost dinner time, they got ready to leave. Godric gave them floo access to the manor since they would both be over often to check on their new patients. But before they could leave Godric handed over a wand box that he said was locked to only open for Harry. He also informed them that he would be visiting the Potter manager to return all that they had recovered.
Harry fidgeted, before a devious smile found its way onto his face. “But, Daddy, I thought I wasn’t supposed to talk to strangers.” He teased back, referring to the talk Bartok had given him over lunch yesterday about the general rules for the Courts. One of which was never to be alone without a parent or bonded mate before he reached maturity at eighteen.
“I hope you get the chance to,” he said, grateful for the change in subject. “And how are you, Miss Lovegood? Have you gotten on well since—”
“There is a sense of… conflict to your aura. May I suggest the Witch’s Brew? It cures many common aura ailments.”
“I have not yet asked for his hand. I am trying to ensure that everything is in place before I do so so that he will be less inclined to refuse. We... are not on the best terms right now.”
this afternoon about their poor training practices,” said his mother, before handing him the plate of scones to replenish the one he lost.
“Oh, come now. My younger self would’ve jumped with glee if he knew I had given you a ‘cursed’ broom. And I did it completely by accident.”
It was the most Gryffindor charity mission that Draco had ever heard, and his father would have sneered at its sentimentality if he were still alive. Still, Draco had a plan and he was here to see it to fruition.
Madam Joylove brought their tea to the table, a teapot for each of them, and poured their cups. She mumbled something about returning for readings, but Draco did not pay much attention as he was adding sugar and the smallest hint of milk to his tea.
In school, Draco had thought that Potter had relished and sought after the attention he received; Draco certainly would have. Even today, he would not turn it down, especially if it meant being forgiven by society for his family’s crimes. Now, he had learned that Potter loathed it all so much that he essentially stalked in the shadows like some mythical beast.
“I thought that surely Madam Pomfrey would have healed them.” He ran his fingertips over the worst gash along his ribcage.
“Yes, I slept in a cupboard under the stairs. They did not want to waste a room on me. At least not at first.” He continued. “So her touch won me over. She could have manipulated me so easily if she wanted to, but she was… kind. We made a habit of meeting as often as possible. She would often pay my aunt and uncle for my ‘labour’ and I would go to her house to read and learn all that I could. She would smear some dirt on my cheek afterward to sell our little lie and send me back home.
“Mrs. Granger-Weasley,” his mother said, “would you mind a walk around the grounds? We may want to provide entertainment and refreshments outdoors as well.” She beckoned Kreacher to her side to continue with his note-taking.
The Malfoys had had Harry’s calling card since the night the Golden Trio joined them for dinner, so Draco knew that Godric’s Hollow should allow callers today between one and four in the afternoon. And while he would usually never arrive at the moment someone’s calling hours began, desperate times did indeed call for desperate measures. At one o’clock, Draco arrived at Harry’s estate and passed through the gates as they were opening. He walked the gravel path to his home, and stood before the front door. Everything he had done within the last fortnight had led up to this moment. And so, with a nervous inhale, he rang the bell.
His mother nodded. “Mother and Father did not just disown you in name alone. You were magically warded from the family to ensure that you could not inherit our wealth if the rest of us passed.”
Draco nodded. “Of course.” He put on his hat. “I apologise for taking up your time, Mrs. Granger-Weasley.” Then he left, finally letting the tears fall when the door closed behind him.
“And Dumbledore, the most powerful wizard outside of Merlin himself, was unable to persuade your family to treat you better?”
Tuesday did not come quickly enough. He was anxious to see Potter after his visit to Godric’s Hollow, yet nervous that he might act a blubbering fool as he did in the library.
Draco arrived at 14 Strops Lane and frowned. The door had no signs or markings to indicate the presence of an office. He took Potter’s letter from his pocket to ensure he read the address correctly.
It was warm in the house with thirteen guests inside, and so Draco removed himself to find a few minutes alone on the balcony. The doors were open, and he could still hear laughter and conversation from the cards tables inside. Dinner had gone well, and Miss Astoria had spent much of the time in conversation with Miss Lovegood and Mr. Shafiq. He did not know whether she would choose any of the people they had invited tonight, but he took small comfort in the fact that they had tried.
Harry stood when Draco shrugged on his robes, crossing the room to meet him. “Will you meet me back here tomorrow evening?” he asked softly, his green eyes bright with hope.
Draco smiled. “I am sure she will be happy to hear from you. The announcement in the paper was not very detailed. Would you mind providing more information about the charity and its mission?”
“And purchase a gift for Mr. and Mrs. Greengrass. I will write a note to accompany it. It should arrive by this evening.”
“Money is not everything,” Weasley said before his next move. “You hurt many people. You hurt every guest in this room. Have you ever even apologised to anyone?”
She came to rest right before them, and her gaze fell first to Draco and then Harry. Her eyes trailed to their entwined hands and she looked at them once more, her face turning into a slow, knowing smile. She raised her sword, and as Draco’s grip tightened on his wand to prepare for attack, the weapon was hoisted over her head and slid into a sheath at her back. Then Nimue placed one hand against Harry’s cheek and another against Draco’s. The touch felt as though he were awash by a lulling sea, yet it, strangely, reminded him of every time Harry had touched him in the same manner, so gentle and affectionate, giving Draco more than he could ever hope to deserve.
“Oh, Merlin, Mother! How many papers did you order?” Draco yelled over the cacophony of at least two dozen birds flying into their dining room and dropping copy after copy of the newspaper in front of Mrs. Malfoy.
Harry Potter and all of the rest of that rubbish.” He was silent for several moments before he turned back over. “I wish I could just be me. I wish I were just—”
“Really? You can feel it from there?” Draco asked. He had only felt the magic of the stones up close.
Draco heard the meaning in Potter’s voice, knowing he had just thrown his own words back at him all of these years later. He smirked and squared his shoulders, replying, “Never, Potter,” before taking off at full speed. He heard Potter laugh behind him seconds later and Draco laughed in response, drunk on the exhilaration of flying fifty feet above the ground and competing together once again.
She gave him a sad smile. “Thank you. You did not have to do all of this. The dinner and the suitors. It was kind of you.” She paused for a moment. “If I may be frank, you have become… much kinder since Hogwarts. I am glad I have gotten to know this version of Draco Malfoy. I like him very much.”
He nodded. “We discussed it this morning. Uncle Harry has been telling me all about you, you see, so I wanted to meet you.” Well that certainly made Draco’s chest heat up with affection. Teddy grabbed his hand, not allowing Draco even a second to think on that feeling. “Come! Let me show you something!”
“Of course not, Mr. Malfoy. My apologies.” He handed Draco the parchment and quill as requested, and Draco jotted a quick note.
“What?” she responded, interrupting his appraisal of the room. She wore lavender robes, which complimented her dark skin, and a paisley ribbon was tied at the high waistline under her chest. She wore a small cameo on a gold chain at her neck, and her hands were covered with pristine white gloves.  “Oh. No, you are not interrupting. We seem to have a niffler problem. One has stolen my purse and there was a bit of a chase.” She cleared her throat and closed the door. “And it is Mrs. Granger-Weasley now.”
Draco nodded and waited for her to leave before he took his correspondence to his bedroom. When he closed the door behind him, he dropped the other letters to the floor in haste to see Potter’s reply, and popped the seal with his fingertip.
Draco stepped forward and hugged his aunt for the first time in his entire life. “Thank you,” he said again, happy to not only have an heir, but to have family, too.
“No! Yes, no, that isn’t. Harry, please let me continue. There was a plan, but you were not specifically a part of it. I had no intentions of using you in any way.”
“Yes, please have my initials engraved on the broom handle. I also have other business this afternoon, so I will need it delivered to my home.”
She tilted her head and reached to cup his cheek. “One day, Mr. Malfoy, you will see the good within yourself.”
“Uncle Harry!” Teddy exclaimed and left Draco’s side to run and greet him. Potter knelt down and embraced him tightly. “Happy birthday.”
“Yes, I swear it! I did not even think about it when I let you borrow it. I thought that Ron may not take too kindly to letting you borrow his broom, so I lent you mine. I am sorry,” he responded. However when he saw Draco’s face, no doubt with a sullen expression, he started to laugh.
The last question left a bad taste in his mouth. His mother had been correct; the right marriage would solve many Malfoy problems. Yet every time he thought of Miss Astoria, Potter would barge into his thoughts and question where he fit into the equation of Draco’s future.
Potter’s eyes averted to the creek. “I have known her most of my life,” he replied after a long moment.
“Ron,” Harry said softly. A flush crept up Mr. Weasley’s neck and his mouth tightened, looking thoroughly chastised. When Draco looked over at Harry, however, his face was pinched with unease. At one time, such a look would have made Draco smirk with utter delight, but now it made his heart sink.
Mrs. Tonks nodded. “Yes, I do.” Her back was as stiff as a board, and she looked as uncomfortable as Draco felt.
The good far outweighed the bad, and so he could not help but smile and sink further into his armchair as he thought about what another Potter rendezvous might bring.
Draco left Godric’s Hollow with eight books shrunken to fit into his bag. When he arrived at home, Quelter met him to inform him that his mother would be dining with the Parkinsons that evening. Draco was not surprised. After a quarrel, she would often avoid him or his father by having meals in her room or dining out all together. He hoped this spell did not last too long as they were scheduled to meet with Potter and Mrs. Granger-Weasley on Tuesday to begin planning the unity ball.
everyone’s eyes upon them as they walked toward the dance floor, and nervousness built within him like floodwaters as each second passed. It felt like they were alone for an eternity until he heard someone finally join them. He peeked and saw Miss Lovegood and Miss Astoria behind them, and then Mrs. Granger-Weasley and Mr. Weasley joined as well. Miss Lovegood gave him a reassuring smile, and, finally, other couples joined them until the dance floor was full.
Draco was not sure how long he had been lost in his own mind, so he cleared his throat and plastered on a smile. He shuffled those nasty thoughts into the corner of his mind, shuttering them out with Occlumency; he was not going to let anything ruin tonight. “Right. Your present.” He stepped forward and handed it to him.
Draco took a deep breath and shrugged. “I fell in love with Mr. Potter when I should not have. Not when I must marry someone else and secure an heir.”
“Perhaps we should join my mother and Mrs. Granger-Weasley in the garden?” Draco suggested, his voice thick with… with something he would rather not think about right then.
“Will Mrs. Granger-Weasley be joining us?” Draco replied, pulling out a portfolio of notes. “Or Mrs. Figg?” He was unsure of Mrs. Figg’s role in the charity, but he thought it would be the most polite option to include her.
Mrs. Granger-Weasley interrupted, “I unfortunately must hurry, so please allow me to escort Mr. Malfoy to the salon.”
Dinner arrived, and Course after course was served under the light of floating candles. Draco sat next to his fellow Gryffindor for the night, Miss Astoria, and with a bit of gentle persuading, she admitted to seeing Miss Lovegood twice since their last dinner.
Potter looked ahead, as though contemplating his answer. “I do not want anyone else to experience what I had to experience. I suppose that is my driving force.”
Several moments passed before Harry looked at Draco with melancholy in his eyes, shaking his head. “Thinking back, it is my own fault for believing it. For how many disappointments in my life have involved you as the common thread?”
“I see. Do you enjoy your service here?” Draco remembered his great-aunt’s home to be rather dark and musty. Surely this was an improvement.
Potter nodded. “She is a very caring person and a wonderful grandmother. She has kindly welcomed my presence in Teddy’s life.”
“Oh, yes. It is quite large. I was shocked when the solicitor told me how big the estate actually is. Ron’s jaw practically fell to the floor.”
Potter gave a sheepish grin. “Yes.” They had both changed out of their flying robes, though Potter was now wearing a muggle tailcoat. He tossed up the tails before sitting down.
A lurching trip by portkey and an Apparition later, they arrived at the steps of his home under the cover of darkness. If he would have been in his right mind, he would have been worried about appearing in the middle Horizont Alley, half dressed with muddied trousers while accompanying a lady with grass-stained robes. It looked as though they had just returned from a rather enthusiastic dalliance. He was not at all in his right mind, however, and instead, he stood on his doorstep waiting for Miss Lovegood to open the door while he slumped against her pitifully.
Draco nodded, his breath still shaky and fast. After a minute, his breathing evened enough to speak. “Is it cursed?”
“You two have been so friendly as of late, and if she were not already married, I would absolutely approve.” She began to tick items off of her fingers as she listed them. “She is close friends with Harry Potter, she was on the front lines of the war, she oversees the most talked-about charity in the Wizarding World… she even has an Order of Merlin, First Class!”
It did not take long for the meal to begin, and he was, thankfully, placed next to Miss Lovegood and not next to one of the dozen Weasleys in attendance. Penelope Clearwater sat on her other side, and while Miss Lovegood spoke with her frequently, she still engaged Draco in stimulating conversation.
“That is up to you. If the pain I have caused you is too much to overcome or if you have moved on since we parted, please say so and I will make my leave.” He paused to allow Harry to respond, but he continued to look at Draco expectantly. “If that is not the case, I told you our first night here that I was yours. I meant it then,” he said, “and I mean it now.”
“Malfoy,” he heard behind him and then felt a hand on his shoulder. “My relationship with Dumbledore was complicated.” He was quiet for several moments before he continued. “Hermione has also questioned his motives and role in my life, too, you know.”
Draco and Mrs. Malfoy had found several rituals to reverse the disownment, but with both parties in agreement, the quickest and most painless option involved the mixing of blood and an incantation. Draco held the palm of his mother’s right hand open and nicked it with a dagger, watching as the blood rose to the surface. He did the same with his aunt’s hand, and then the two sisters stood side-by-side.
What exactly did Mrs. Granger-Weasley hold over her? He was finding himself liking her more and more as of late. It seemed she was a formidable companion, and it was obvious that she must have been key to Potter’s victory over the Dark Lord.
When his mother finished, she turned to her audience. A pleased and proud smile graced her face. “Questions? Thoughts?”
“Harry, you know that I have no attraction toward women. Even before we met again, I did not want this. And then you came into my life again and turned everything upside down. Suddenly you were in my every thought and dream. I wanted nothing more than to be with you, and I allowed myself to yield to temptation, to forget my duties, to cherish the time we could have together. To, to lo—”
“I am your cousin, Edward Lupin. But you can call me Teddy.” His face was red from playing out of doors, and his hair was damp with sweat.
“She sat me down with parchment and a pencil and told me that she was going to teach me to read and write. I panicked, knowing that I was not allowed to do such a thing, and I thought that she may be playing a nasty trick, as my cousin often did to me. But then she took my hand to calm me.” He gave a sad chuckle. “No one had ever held my hand before. The only touch I had ever received was a slap or a punch or a shove. Sometimes my aunt would grab me by the ear to throw me into my cupboard if she was especially displeased with me.”
“Oh.” Draco should have known that was a possibility. “He is the godfather of her grandchild. I forgot to tell you. I am sorry.”
“Of course. I can ship the book to you when I have finished?” He nodded, and she looked up at him and smiled. “I have begun to enjoy our chats, Mr. Malfoy,” she said after a moment of silence. “Which is something I never thought I would say.”
Draco had seen this display many times before. It was a speciality of Black family women for planning large social events. The lady of the house would create twinkling facsimiles of her vision, and an eager elf would take detailed notes to send out to the appropriate persons. As she continued today’s creation, Draco turned to see wide eyes and slack jaws on both Potter and Mrs. Granger-Weasley. The so-called Brightest Witch of Her Age and Boy Who Lived had both taken part in defeating the most dangerous wizard of their time, yet they were still impressed by a little bit of charms work.
As if he sensed his uncertainty, Potter closed the space between them and gave him a soft kiss. “Will we do this again, Mr. Malfoy?”
Mrs. Figg arrived with the tea cart and the trio helped themselves to tea and biscuits before resuming the conversation.
She laughed. “You are probably right.” She clipped another stalk of leaves. “Are you here to see him?”
. Of course, the Golden Trio could very well vanish their clothes and walk down Diagon Alley naked, and no one would bat an eye. There was probably nothing the Wizarding World would hold against them.
He shrugged. “Maybe Miss Astoria does not need an advantageous prospect. Maybe she needs someone good. Someone who would love her for who she is. Which is something I never could have provided her.”
“I thought you may be Mr. Potter. I am working on a potion for his birthday and do not wish for him to figure it out beforehand.”
Draco took a shaky breath, the realization of what both of them had endured at the hands of a madman hitting him all at once. And yet, Harry was here with him, soft and warm, vibrant and bright. He pressed his hand against Harry’s chest and felt the life coursing through him, his own heart pounding in a shared rhythm.
“Mother!” He shot up from his seat like a guilty first-year, scattering the letter and the invitation to the floor. “Nothing, just… enjoying a relaxing Saturday.”
“What?” Draco responded. Potter’s eyes were glued to Draco’s body, and when he looked down, he realized that he was staring at the silver-white scars crisscrossing along his chest and torso. “Oh. Right.”
She sighed and looked at him for a moment, her mouth taut with displeasure. “Very well. This is your plan after all.”
’s most offending owl came careening through the window. Draco sighed and held up the sausage that he knew the bird would steal. The owl hooted at the sight, dropped the paper, and swooped down to retrieve the sausage. Then he flew about the room twice and finally exited.
“Mr. Malfoy?” said Madam Joylove. “Are you ready?” He handed her his teacup with dread. She was quiet this time, taking much longer to read than she did for Miss Lovegood. “I see a… chain?” She seemed unsure. Draco could not remember what a chain signified from his Divination classes. “That would mean an engagement in your future!” She smiled.
“An engagement?” Draco asked, his stomach turning at the thought. He had been so busy with... well, he had been so busy with Potter (and the unity ball, of course!), that he had been putting off that item on his list. He was not ready.
They were interrupted by Quelter announcing Miss Astoria’s presence, and when she entered, adorned in delicate, white robes with pearls woven into her hair, he heard the smallest gasp from Miss Lovegood. He turned to look and saw her cheeks turning pink.
“Well, I will simply say that I truly do hope that you and Mr. Potter will be happy together. He told us everything you did so that you could be with him, and I can see that for the act of love that I believe it is.” She paused for a moment. “You did, however, hurt him, and so my trust can only go so far. And if you ever hurt him again, this is a reminder that I am a very smart and powerful witch and I promise to make you miserable for as long as you live.”
“He crawled in my lap to tell me about his latest adventures, and then—” he gestured with his head toward the bundle in his arms. Potter smiled and then scooted closer, pressing their arms and thighs together. “Did you enjoy your birthday?”
“Draco, the idea was that we would introduce Miss Astoria to matches of wealth and status so that she would have other advantageous prospects available when you broke the news to her. Miss Lovegood, as delightful as you may find her for reasons I have yet to understand, has neither of those things.”
She stood and paced the room for several minutes before speaking. “I saw the way you looked in the manor. And I knew right then that our time with the Dark Lord has forever ruined that place for you. Even if it has been our home your entire life, it has been ruined. And then I asked myself why getting the manor back had been so important. And of course, I believe we both missed the home where our family had lived and you had grown up, but I think I had been fixated on my own vision for you — my son as head of Malfoy Manor with a wife and a child of his own.” She stopped walking and sat beside him again. “But you are rich enough to buy a grand estate of your own if you wanted. And,” she took a deep breath, “with a reversal of disownment, you would also have an heir.”
Then they walked through the gate and Disapparated, appearing at the steps of the place they currently called home. “Quelter!” Mrs. Malfoy called when they stepped inside. She removed her gloves and Draco did the same.
“Draco Malfoy came to me with the idea of working together because if he and I could put our differences behind us for the greater good, then surely anyone could do the same thing. It has not always been easy, and we have had to face our bitter history more than once, but we stand here together to work toward a more understanding and united Wizarding World. I hope you will join us in that work and tonight as we commence the dancing portion of the evening.”
“He is young; I am sure there will be a time for that.” Potter ladled himself a glass of punch. “However,” he paused, “Mrs. Tonks is very protective of him, especially since she lost Mrs. Lupin at such a young age. If she did not want you to speak with Teddy, she very well would not have allowed Teddy anywhere near you.”
Mrs. Malfoy smiled at him very fondly. “Sometimes I forget that you are not my little boy anymore. Even if we disagree at times, I am so proud of you and the man you have become.”
“Ha ha, mother,” Draco responded. She laughed and looked back down to the list, however her smile vanished as quickly as it had come. “What is the matter?”
This is the end, my friends. Thank you so much for reading. I have enjoyed writing this so much — thinking about how the Wizarding World would be in the Regency Era, Draco and Luna becoming unlikely friends, Draco trying to be good even if it does not come naturally. I especially enjoyed writing Narcissa, as I believe many of us can relate to having family with outdated views who need nudges in the right direction, and who may never completely understand things, even if you still love them.
“It is absolutely gorgeous,” Mrs. Granger-Weasley agreed. Her hand hovered above one of the house tables, and she delicately touched her fingers to the glimmering surface, which parted like smoke at her touch.
Friends, Draco thought, and the tips of his ears turned red. Merlin, he was becoming as sentimental as a Hufflepuff. He cleared his throat.
, even by himself when he had been young and so willfully blind — would always stay with him, a spot he could never wash out.
“Mother…” he said, deflated. “Surely this is not the family to whom you want to align the Malfoys. Do you really want to spend every Christmas with Mrs. Greengrass?”
“We should have held this meaning in a place that serves alcohol so we could properly celebrate together.”
As Draco sat down, he noticed a portrait on the wall. He was familiar with several faces, including Potter, Granger-Weasley, and Hagrid, but there were others he did not know, including — was that a house elf? In a waistcoat and robes? “May I inquire about the portrait?”
“No!” he said immediately, remembering Potter’s advice. “No, thank you. Do you have a lavender tea?”
“Yes, see, I know that our families have been in talks about a possible future together. Perhaps I would not call it courting, but we have been circling around each other in some way the last couple of months. Then tonight, I arrive here, and there are several single wizards in the market for a wife, not to mention Miss Lovegood being very attentive. And, well, we are fellow Slytherins. I know a scheme when I see one.”
Draco grinned and rested his gloved hand against his chest, feeling pearls and fabric beneath his fingers. “This ensemble is beautiful.”
“We unfortunately don’t have much time before heading to the Burrow for the day, but I can ring for tea?”
He spent the morning with his mother, and then apparated to the Burrow in the afternoon. When he arrived, his eyes fell on a crooked, leaning tower of a home, which looked susceptible to a tumble by a stiff breeze or even a meager shove. There were tents outside, striped white and green, with tables and chairs lined beneath them. Children ran about the grassy field next to the house, laughter filling the air as they chased each other. There were at least 30 people milling about, many of whom Draco recognized, but some he did not. There was a circle of Weasley siblings to his left and Kingsley Shacklebolt was in deep conversation Neville Longbottom further down the field. Draco’s hands fidgeted nervously at his side as he realized that Potter might be the only person there who did not hate him, and since Potter was the reason for today’s fête, it would be a very lonely day indeed.
Draco could not help but smile in return, as if Potter’s happiness itself were infectious. His gut twisted in an odd sort of feeling that he could not quite identify.
pulling him closer, but not as a snare. It was more like an embrace. “No. No, not at all.” It beckoned them closer and closer until they stood before the center stone. And even though Draco wondered if he were making a mistake, he obeyed both the magic and his own desire and placed their entwined hands upon the rock.
“Ugh, vagrant!” Draco exclaimed, running to the window to see the owl soar above the rooftops. Though he might have expected such behaviour from a poorly trained owl owned by an indolent wizard, he expected better from one owned by a respected business. Well, perhaps
Miss Lovegood stood, her eyes darting back and forth between Draco and his mother. She did look a mess. Her robes were still stained from the forest floor, and her hair was disheveled from sleep. What a sight they must have made.
So Draco found himself jogging to keep up with Teddy as he pumped his tiny legs to sprint behind the house. A large garden sprawled before them, budding with ripening fruit and vegetables. Pumpkins, still small and green at that point in the summer, peeked from behind large leaves, and fat, red tomatoes drooped heavily on stems as if they may fall at any moment.
“It is too hot,” he cried out, tugging at his collar. It was approaching dusk, and the forest was quiet around them.
“Mrs. Figg flooed me this morning. She says that we’ve already had a large number of responses about the ball.”
“May I take your hat? This house isn’t used often and we do not keep an elf staffed here.” Draco handed it over and Potter stepped out of the foyer to put it away. While he did so, he removed the gift from his pocket and enlarged it to his normal size. It was wrapped in brown parchment with a gold ribbon tied around its center.
“I see,” Draco responded, hating the sudden turn in this conversation. He supposed Potter was lucky enough to at least be attracted to women in case he ever had to marry. Draco could certainly appreciate their beauty, but none had made him feel like Potter just did.
Draco took a sip of tea. “My studies at university focused on lineage magic, and I assisted Professor Henri Bernard on a fascinating study about the blood of muggle-born and pureblood witches. When it is published, it may help your educational mission to widely distribute it.”
Mrs. Malfoy now lived in a townhome at the far end of Horizont Alley. It was much smaller than the manor, but it would be more than comfortable for most wizarding families in London. Though the Ministry took their family estate after the trials, the Malfoys had managed to keep their Gringotts vault intact. Draco attributed this to goblin reluctance in allowing the Ministry to meddle in their business affairs as opposed to kindness bestowed by the Wizengamot.
Draco turned to see Miss Lovegood rising from her seat. Her dress matched the color of her loose curls, yellow and sunny, and while he never would have assumed any shade of yellow would compliment a woman so fair, she looked as if she had descended from Mount Olympus itself. He had never realized that Miss Lovegood was handsome while they attended Hogwarts (or while she had been locked away in his family’s dungeon, for that matter). Perhaps he had other things on his mind.
Draco would never know if it had been her name on his lips, or simply their presence that had called her, but a woman, bathed in ethereal, blue light, suddenly glided toward them from the edge of the clearing. Long hair floated behind her and her gown swirled gently as though touched by unseen currents. Her right hand held a large, glistening sword, angled toward the ground. His previous statement had mostly been in jest, but now it seemed to be an omen. He tried to take a step backward, but Harry squeezed his left hand to stop him.
“It has been years now. We were only allowed to collect a few personal belongings after the trial,” Draco responded. The rest had been seized. It probably would have taken a dozen curse-breakers weeks to get through all of the Malfoy wards to take everything, and he wondered if any were still in place.
“I sat in potions class with him for six years, Mrs. Granger-Weasley. I do not think he would know a potion ingredient in the wild if it grew legs and kicked him.”
“Oh. Right. Yes. It was… well, an unkind reminder of how the Black family treated those who stood up against them, including my godfather. It wouldn’t be right to keep it here.”
on his rain shield before stepping inside. “You have a bit of floo powder on your shoulder.” The glittered powder was stark against the dark cloth of his tailcoat.
Mrs. Malfoy was dazzling when she smiled, and he could not think of the last time he saw her so happy. Before the Dark Lord’s return, surely.
He knew that it was the truth, but her words still felt like a dagger to the gut. He took a shuddering breath. “Yes, I — I am attempting to mend our relationship. And securing an heir is a part of that.”
He eyed Draco warily for several moments before speaking. “We cannot just… forget that the war happened.”
She looked at Mrs. Malfoy. “And what are your thoughts? Do you approve of accepting the wife of a muggle back into your family?”
“Yes, but I cannot get the country air there.” The excuse sounded thin to his own ears, so he would not expect Mrs. Granger-Weasley to believe him.
Had Potter had romantic inclinations toward other men, or was Draco the first? He knew that the muggle world prohibited such relationships, and he therefore wondered if Potter had been influenced by his upbringing. The Wizarding World was better in regards to same-gender relationships, but only somewhat. Oh, common people were free to be with whomever they liked, but high society, and especially purebloods, were expected to forego any such inclinations to secure heirs for the family’s legacy. Duty was always more important than following one’s heart. So while Draco had had a couple of minor dalliances at university, at some point he would have to do what was expected of him: marry a woman and have a child. His lip curled at the thought.
Harry deepened the kiss and pressed him to the bed before climbing over him. It did not take long to return to the furious and desperate friction of body against body, Harry’s mouth against his throat.
, he thought. One really should expect greater social skills from a family of pureblood Slytherins. The two younger sisters, Miss Francine and Miss Charlotte, sat between their father and Mrs. Malfoy.
Draco laughed. “I would like to show everything to you, Mr. Potter, if you would accompany me. And then I promise, mama, we will play perfect hosts.”
Draco retired to his own room early that night, fatigued from his trying day of apologies and the unsuccessful discussion with his mother. She did not come down for dinner, and Lokey made apologies on her behalf, saying she was under the weather. Since Draco had done just the same that morning, he could hardly blame her.
He sighed in relief. The last thing he needed was Mrs. Granger-Weasley becoming too curious about his lightning-shaped fortune. Miss Lovegood’s gasp had been bad enough.
Harry started at him a moment before speaking. “I have slept here a couple of times since… since everything.”
Draco disapparated and arrived at the steps of 12 Grimmauld Place. He had not been here since he had been a very small boy when his Great-Aunt Walburga had still been alive. It seemed much the same on the outside, though he was almost too nervously distracted to notice. His hand shook as he reached for the knocker, but Potter was already opening it before he touched it.
“I love you,” he whispered against Harry’s bare skin. Harry looked so gorgeously undone beneath him, and Draco could hardly believe that they were here together.
“Oh,” she said softly. She sat before him in the grass and grabbed both of his hands. “You do not have to tell me what happened, but I am here for you if you wish to speak on it.”
Draco had stood trial before the Wizengamot and had certainly thought about the wrongness of his actions in service to the Dark Lord, but asking for forgiveness from the aggrieved was another thing entirely. Really, Draco could think of very few times in his life that he had actually apologised.
Quelter also handed him two letters, one from Mrs. Granger-Weasley and one from Miss Lovegood. When Draco retired to the parlour, he decided to read Mrs. Granger-Weasley’s letter first, as it was less likely to be filled with nonsense.
She smiled at him. “Good morning, Mr. Malfoy,” she said in French. “There is more coffee available if you would like some.”
“She is as taken with you as every other witch in this country.” He sat down to pour himself a cup of tea. The tea service was made of ornately carved silver, and the teapot depicted an occamy. The head and neck made up the spout, the winged, serpentined body wrapped around the base, and its tail created the handle. Draco thought it must have been an heirloom from when Potter’s family still lived in India.
Draco wished he had a pensieve to revisit the moment again and again. Potter had not run away when Draco touched him. He had not shoved him or sneered in disgust. He had closed his eyes and
“If we are trying to reenter society, then I suppose this sort of thing should be expected.” She looked up and forced a smile onto her face. He was unsure if she was trying to convince him or herself. “Now, hurry and eat, or we will be late for our meeting.”
Draco clenched his jaw, and turned to walk toward the open window, realizing it had begun to rain outside. “Do you not want just one night with me where we forget all of these things?”
Teddy looked down. “That I have to ask first.” Then he huffed. “I just wanted to show Cousin Draco the gnomes!”
“Yes,” he replied. Draco just had to kiss him once more, which turned into twice more, which turned into—
Draco lit the candelabra by his bed and looked at the book resting upon the side table. Whenever he would feel particularly maudlin, which was more often than he would admit to anyone, he would open their book and read all of the things they had said to each other. It would both comfort him and make him sadder, the paradox of memories of lost love.
“Yes,” Potter replied. “This is the founding board of the charity. This is Chiara Lobosca, who oversees werewolf relations; Herky, with elf relations; Mr. Hagrid and Firenze, you know of course, with giant and centaur relations; Mrs. Granger-Weasley oversees muggle-born relations and many, many other aspects of the charity, and I am here to,” he shrugged, as if a bit embarrassed, “raise funds I suppose.”
Draco ate a quick breakfast, and then they left the house to meet Mrs. Granger-Weasley. As they crossed the street a few minutes later, his eyes fell upon a familiar broom in the Quality Quidditch Supplies window.
He did not see Harry when he arrived; he had apparently pulled his friends together to tell them the news, and to, no doubt, deal with Weasley’s ire. Draco realised that he had essentially traded Mrs. Greengrass’s obnoxiousness with Mr. Weasley’s loathing, but it was certainly worth it to be with Harry.
Draco lifted one shoulder in an attempt at nonchalance. “I survived. And Teddy was very friendly. I am not sure if he knows our family history.”
Potter’s words hit him like a blow to the chest. “You know what I had to do. For my family. To survive. Do you really still hold that against me?”
They stayed there for several minutes, and Draco realized that it was all together… pleasant. If he pulled Teddy a bit closer to cuddle against him, well certainly no one would notice.
Draco’s hand drifted under his nightshirt, trailing down his stomach before wrapping around his cock. He was already hard just thinking of their kiss and the sweet sounds Potter had made when Draco had licked and nibbled his neck. What would have happened if Potter had not needed to leave so suddenly? He liked to think that they could have taken their time, undressed each other slowly, letting their hands and mouths wander. Yet he knew the intensity of their desire would not have allowed for that.
The next few days were a flurry of correspondence as invitations to the ball were sent out from the charity office and as the Malfoys, in turn, received their own invitations to an assortment of parties, dinners, and other social engagements. They had not received so many missives since before the Dark Lord’s return, and Draco had never seen his mother so happy.
He looked at her, his beautiful mother who had always loved him without expectation or condition. Even though his position in life had required him to do and be many things, he knew that her love and support would never waiver. Would it be so wrong for her to know?
Draco wondered why anyone would choose the sickening feeling of side-along apparition when they could perform the act themselves. She did seem a bit frail, so perhaps her magic was not as strong as it used to be.
“How long has it been since you have last been here?” Mr. Greengrass asked. They were walking the winding path to the gates of Malfoy Manor to check off the second-to-last item on their plan. Mrs. Malfoy was with them, as well as two aurors sent to keep an eye on them. He should have expected that; there was no such thing as a trustworthy Malfoy in the eyes of the Wizengamot.
He parted his legs, telling Harry how to prepare him and make him ready. His touch was tentative but still exquisite, filling him up, making him ache. It felt even more so when his fingers brushed that spot within him that made him see stars.
“Deal.” Draco removed his glove and extended his hand to shake Potter’s. Potter did the same, and when his hand enclosed Draco’s, it felt warm and calloused from years on a broom. Draco’s face heated as he suddenly remembered the last time he had touched Potter, with fiendfyre licking at their heels when they escaped the Room of Requirement. If only eleven-year-old Draco, whose handshake was scorned by Harry Potter, could see him now, placing a bet with the Saviour of the Wizarding World.
“I think Herky and Griffel are forces with which to be reckoned.” He smiled in amusement. “They’re a passionate duo, and so I have no doubt.”
Bernard’s gaze fell to Miss Lovegood before smiling. “I have copies of the manuscript here, which have been translated to English.” He grabbed his portfolio and placed one copy in front of Miss Lovegood and another in front of Harry. “There is a brief summary on the first page, which essentially states that there were no findings in the study that pureblood magic was stronger than magic found in the blood of muggleborns or half-bloods, and I am happy to answer any questions now or later by owl or by floo.” He was perched so close to the edge of his seat that Draco feared he might fall into the table.
“This!” he shouted, gesturing between them. He took a shuddering breath which turned into a choked sob. “Harry, I have duties. To my family. I have to—” he took another deep breath. “When I returned to England from university, my mother and I concocted a plan. To try to right our wrongs and restore the Malfoy name. We planned to donate money to important charities, to reenter society through advantageous social engagements, and—”
“Besides the obvious, you mean?” Draco responded, and Potter nodded. “I know that you lived with your muggle family, and that you had to return there during the summers for your protection.”
“Mr. Malfoy, what an unexpected surprise!” Astoria Greengrass stood before him, wearing plain, but well-made, peach-coloured dress robes. Her dark hair was in a perfectly styled chignon, and a modest emerald glittered at her pale neck. He had not seen her since Hogwarts and, because she had been two years his junior, much had changed since then. She had certainly lost the bodily awkwardness of youth.
“On the contrary. I am not well acquainted with many people here,” Draco said, ignoring her raised brows at his lack of good acquaintances. “He has proven to be a friend already.”
“May I,” Draco said, his fingers itching to grab Harry’s hand but he stopped himself in case it was too forward, “may I tell you what I had planned to say when I tried to call?” Harry nodded, and Draco took a deep breath. “Harry, I know that I hurt you. That I used you. Even if it had never been my intention, I still did it, and I will always be sorry for that.
“Draco?” his mother said. She turned to look at him with worry in her eyes. She grabbed his hand. “Take a deep breath, darling.” He did not realise, until she said that, that he had been breathing shallowly. His hands felt clammy. There was sweat at his hairline. She leaned forward to whisper in his ear. “We do not have to do this.” She looked around and huffed, her lips curling in distaste. “We... do not have to do any of this.”
Draco took an unsteady breath at just the thought of it. His gaze dipped to Potter’s full, parted mouth, and Potter’s eyes shut tightly, all while Draco’s hand continued to caress his cheek. He took one step closer, though still not enough for their bodies to touch, and brought his other hand to the back of Potter’s neck. Potter suddenly whimpered, “please,” making Draco gasp, and then he brought their lips together.
“Ah,” she said with a smirk. “Then I will certainly pay close attention to your dance partners the evening of the ball. There are no such things as secrets in the Wizarding World, Mr. Malfoy!”
“A plan?” Harry asked, leaning back in surprise. And then he laughed humorlessly. “Of course there was a plan. Of course. And I was just… a pawn in a game to manipulate the Wizarding World into forgetting the evil your family has done.”
“Oh, no. I have a few distant cousins throughout Europe who can worry about populating the earth with more spoiled purebloods.”
“I’ve asked the elves to prepare a meal if you have the time?” Potter asked, guiding them to a small creek that they had flown over a few minutes earlier.
Saturday brought too much introspection for Draco’s comfort. Should he take his mother’s advice and stay away from his professor’s upcoming publication? Should he, instead, bolster its success? Should he appease his mother and court Miss Astoria?
Her nostrils flared, and her mouth formed a thin line. “Yes, I am now married, and yes, I have retained my maiden name.” Her tone was clipped, and Draco had no doubt that she had said the same exact thing many times before. It was no wonder — Draco had never heard of such a thing, and he honestly could not believe that there had not been a very public scandal over it. A married witch keeping her maiden name!
Mrs. Skeeter arrived ten minutes early, and Draco mused that her earliness might have been a tactic to catch her interviewees off guard. Draco took it in stride, and did quite well for the first part of the interview. Her Quick Quotes Quill barely moved when he discussed the charity but scribbled furiously whenever he discussed himself or the ball. She asked about his time in Azkaban before the trial (“Horrid and dark and a surefire way to realise the errors of your ways”), his mother’s heroics during the Battle of Hogwarts (“None of us would be here today without her sharp thinking and love for her family”), his budding partnership with Potter (“We are putting aside our differences for the good of Wizarding society”), and whether he had decided on his Hogwarts house for the ball (“I have not; you will have to wait and see.”)
It seemed as though Mr. Weasley, in Hufflepuff attire, was trying his best to steer clear of Draco. Harry and Draco had not yet discussed living arrangements, but considering the greatness of Harry’s estate and its ties to Harry’s family, Draco assumed that he would join Harry here to live. If so, he supposed he and Mr. Weasley had a lot to do to find common ground. But Draco would not worry about that tonight. That was a problem for Tomorrow’s Draco.
“Yes, I have already spent the morning in our gardens. It would have been relaxing, but the gnomes are quite feisty this year.” She looked at him in earnest. “Your note was really very kind, Mr. Malfoy. And unexpected.”
Bernard scoffed in disbelief before looking to Draco with raised brows. Draco shrugged and nodded; how was he to know how Luna Lovegood made decisions? His professor laughed and rubbed his hand together in glee, and his face was so jovial that Draco could not help but smile in response. “Thank you so much, Miss Lovegood. And Mr. Potter.”
It was an invitation to celebrate Potter’s birthday on July 31 at The Burrow. Warmth spread through Draco’s chest as if he had just downed a glass of Ogden’s. He put down the invitation and turned to the letter.
“Well,” Draco said, “it took a bit of persuasion, many tears, and a ritual spell performed by the man before you now, but Andromeda Tonks has been reunited with the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, and your godson is now the Malfoy heir.”
“Oh, I see. Well, I am sure Draco would be happy to take care of any statements or interviews on your behalf.”
He closed his eyes and clenched his jaw, knowing that responding to her in any way would open the floodgates of his misery.
“Of course,” Draco responded. He was always ravenous after a long flight and, though he hated to admit it, would welcome more time with Potter either way.
He thought of every moment they had ever shared together, from scorned handshakes to warm embraces, from riding brooms to escape fiendfyre at Hogwarts to catching snitches at Godric’s Hollow. He thought of their first kiss in the grassy field, the way Potter’s gaze would soften while lying next to him in the moonlight, the deep ache that Draco had felt while they were parted. The beautiful drumming of his pulse every time he saw him.
Draco did remember the burned spots, names and faces that had belonged to blood traitors who had dared to defile the family. “No, you are right.” He suddenly felt, as he so often did, the weight of being a Malfoy, a Black, a former Death Eater. The cruelties committed by his ancestors —
Part of him wanted to laugh because it was true. Mr. Potter was not subtle whatsoever, and it was one of the reasons he loved him. “It was not my intention to lead him on, but I know that I did.” She said nothing in response, and he was unsure how to move forward. “Should I remove myself as host of the ball? Should I not attend?”
“Merlin’s beard, Mother, that was the most insufferable social engagement I have ever attended, and we housed Azkaban-crazed Death Eaters in our home for a year.”
“I am quite sure,” she replied and walked arm-in-arm with Draco down the stairs and out the door of the manor. He heard Mr. Greengrass behind them, and Mrs. Malfoy turned to face him. “Thank you so much for your time and for convincing the ministry to let us visit. Please tell Mrs. Greengrass that I will call on her within the next few days!”
“Very well, darling.” She stood up and leaned over to kiss his cheek. “I will be visiting Mrs. Zabini this morning, as she is under the weather. We can discuss your meeting with Mr. Potter at dinner.”
He had hoped that it would disappear with the Dark Lord’s death, but there it stood, the lines as clear and black as the day he received it. And so his actions during those two fateful years would stay with him forever, no matter what he did to try to right his wrongs.
“No, I do not think I would be opposed though I would like to read further before making a decision.”
He turned to continue their walk, but she did not follow him. He faced her again with an inquisitive brow.
“It would not be much of a unity ball if you and Mr. Potter were not there in unity. Though, perhaps your family should cut ties with our charity once the ball is over.”
He descended the narrow stairs of the Bernards’ cottage, and saw Mrs. Bernard sipping a cup of coffee in the small sitting room. She was a rather thin woman, with brown skin, and her hair was covered by a soft green scarf, which complimented her yellow dress.
Miss Astoria smiled. “We were not well acquainted, but how could I forget such beautiful hair? It is lovely to see you again.”
“There are drinks there — butterbeer, punch, and ale. Oh, and there are hor d'oeuvres available until the meal is served. Mr. Potter is—” she stood on her tiptoes, looking around to find him “— well, he is around here somewhere.”
He returned her smile, and felt the pinprick of tears at the corners of his eyes. “I am proud of you too, for learning, for trying to do the right thing.”
He did not know how to respond to that, and so he deflected. “Well this version of Draco Malfoy would still like to ask for a dance at the ball if you have a spot available.”
. Would it not be beautiful, to have a life full of love and joy with the only person who had ever brought him happiness? To live together? To grow old together? But how could it happen when they lived in a world where Draco’s duties and responsibilities to his family would never allow him to love the person before him? No matter how much he loved him, Potter could never be the partner he so desperately wanted him to be.
“Then I shall write to Minister Shacklebolt at once to recommend an Order of Merlin for your effort.”
Draco could not see how that would be a ringing endorsement for his skill level, but his mother was looking at him expectantly. “I enjoy the game as well,” he said. “Would you care to join me?” He had more than earned an Order of Merlin, First Class, for his amiable and upstanding performance tonight.
“I recommend reading them in order. I believe you may already have the fifth one in the library here.”
“Erm, yes,” he said, suddenly feeling self-conscious. No doubt she had asked because of their public history of animosity, but he felt his own face redden. “Yes, one could say that.”
He eyed the fireplace on the other side of the room and asked himself the same questions he had asked so many times. Had the floo connection been disconnected? If he could not have Harry, could he perhaps have one last moment in the place they shared together?
“Of course,” Miss Lovegood responded. “It is a worthy publication and the world deserves to know of your findings.”
“I can see very clearly why you might be tired, darling, but is that any way to speak to your mother?”
Potter laughed again and grabbed his shoulder. “It is still very fun to tease you, even if we are making amends.” He was standing so close and his eyes were so green that Draco momentarily forgot to breathe.
They walked for several minutes until she spoke. “I have been meaning to write you. I have been reading some philosophy works lately, one of which has interested me a great deal. It discusses the possibility and ethics of providing magical potions and remedies to muggles. Are you familiar?”
“Draco, darling,” his mother interrupted. “We do not want to bore our hosts with academia! Let us instead discuss your upcoming piece in the
Draco had spent much of his life considering muggles with nothing but contempt, but life in France had been different. He had rented an apartment near the university from a muggle family and he had frequented muggle cafes and businesses. He had, without purpose, surrounded himself with people who had not an ounce of magic in their blood, but he had never thought to what he might have easily offered them through magical assistance.
Her eyes met his, pained and glossy with tears. “Our losses,” she said shakily, her mouth quivering. “Our losses are not enough.”
“Yes. Yes, gods, I’m sorry, I should not be here.” He turned around and started to descend the stairs.
“Good evening,” he said, “We are honoured to have you here. We have come together tonight to raise funds in order to promote unity within our society: unity between houses at Hogwarts, and unity between all magical beings. We added a bit of competition because we know that Hogwarts graduates enjoy friendly games, but I hope that this exercise encourages all of us to think of the world around us from the viewpoint of other people, especially those less fortunate than us.
“Oh,” his mother said. “But that cannot be the case,” she laughed nervously. “Surely you are mistaken.”
Mr. Weasley opened his mouth to speak but Draco beat him to it, in hopes that they could put it to rest for Harry’s sake. “Do not worry, Mr. Potter. If I took offense at everything your friends said about me, I would live a rather miserable existence.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Obviously, Potter,” he replied in aggravation. He would know that buffoon’s voice anywhere. Leave it to a Weasley to interrupt such a moment.
“Harry you injured?” The giant asked politely keeping the pink umbrella trained on Vernon and Petunia so that they couldn’t hurt the child again.
Kieran could feel her magic threating to boil over and grabbed her and pulled her into his arms before she could break something. He figured Regulus wouldn’t enjoy coming back to finding his office a mess or find something of importance broken because of Bellatrix’s magic.
Regulus gently placed the phial into his pocket before reaching for Harry’s hand. “Harry fight. I promise you there is so much more to life than this. Trust me when I say you have a family that loves and cares for you already.
Arthur laughed quietly at his boys who had their chins rested on his head. Arthur loved them so much that it felt like his heart was constantly ready to burst. They clung to him like koalas as Arthur finished cooking, finally letting go of him to carry the food for him over to the table. They sandwiched him between them, eating in comfortable silence.
Remus was sitting forward, Sirius barely staying in his mates lap but both listening intently. “Really?” Remus asked raspily, voice tight and worried.
Harry was still focused on the grounds outside, more so on the abundant number of Juliet roses. Petunia had kept a magazine on the most beautiful gardens in the world on the coffee table. Harry had often snuck glances at the pages inside and he distinctly remembered seeing that particular species of rose before because of the lengthy article that mentioned just how expensive the plant was.
Remus couldn’t help but sigh, wishing Sirius had not said it like that but knowing that if they weren’t absolutely clear that nothing of the like would happen Harry would be worried about this forever. “Harry, while what Sirius said was rather vulgar,” Remus shot a dirty look at his mate over Harry’s head, “What he said is true. Touching your penis, no matter for how long, won’t cause it to fall off.”
“You were younger when we met, at least you get to know him before Harry does.” Anna scoffed rolling her eyes but still undoubtedly fond of her young mate.
“I, James Fleamont Potter, presently of Godric’s Hollow, England, hereby revoke all former testamentary dispositions made by me and declare this to be my last Will.
Bartok was peeking out between his wings watching and listening. His scales had flared down, going from their angry blood red back to their normal chocolate brown as he heard about the oath and Lyle read the letter. Bartok ducked his head back down, watching Harry stare up at him trustingly. “We are sorry about the misunderstanding, Harry. There was quite the display of magic when you bonded with your new wand, and none of us were expecting it. We thought you were in danger and the one to give it to you was trying to hurt you. That was who Issy cursed. She loves you very much and thought you were harmed.”
While Percival loathed child abuse the thought of being held captive was still a sore spot for him. So for a man who many magicals looked up to do both made him want to rage. To fly off and rip and tear and destroy.
He stood there, observing the woman’s every move as she conducted the packing like an orchestra. Severus knew that if she wanted she could easily take him down, wand or not. Minerva, like her namesake, was a warrior to the bone and needed nothing but her mind and willpower to take down anyone.
Harry was about to go on the attack but he was stopped by the sound of his Godfather laughing, he looked down, Sirius rolling around under his feet, smile wide and eyes bright. The laughter was like the barking of an overly excited dog. Harry frowned, and looked over to Remus who had a hand over his eyes while his face was red. Harry looked back at Sirius who was now wheezing between laughs, yelling that if it didn’t stop he would piss himself.
Percival Graves was his mentor while he was working on his criminal law apprenticeship. He still looked as young as ever, even though he was already well over a hundred, slicked back dirty blond hair, piercing light grey eyes and face as stoic as ever.
The reason I haven't gotten much writing done is that I can't take my Adderall so it is hard for me to focus. Along with that my depression has gotten worse, I will be going to get my anti-depressants upped, and so I have been sleeping a lot and feeling unmotivated. Along with the heart meds making me sleepy in general.
The rest of the family got seated quickly, Augusta gracefully stealing the leather chesterfield armchair that Harry had only seen Bartok use. “We have a lot to talk about, but first we need to discuss the wrongful imprisonment of Lord Black.” Augusta’s face had gone stony for a reason Harry couldn’t determine.
Lastly was Lyle, he also had freckled, but they were lightly spattered across his nose, much like David. He was clean-shaven with long fingers cradling his strong jaw. Eyes as dark as coal, lite with the inner fire of mischief. At first glance, one might think him ordinary, but it was the light in his eyes that changed all of his features.
“Wake up, you dramatic sod. We both know the enchanted sleep was broken the moment I entered the inner chambers.” He couldn’t help the smile that spread across his face, expression fond.
Arthur had regained his composure, he had only one last question to ask before he would be sure about what to do. “Does the idea of Harry dying bother any of you?” They all shook their heads and all the Weasley’s faces went hard as stone, eyes like daggers.
David nodded, “There aren’t many infected werewolves in Terradore so we are having trouble sourcing blood to test, but I am sure we will eventually-”
Lastly, Dorea went over both male and female pregnancy. Harry was shocked to learn that certain men could get pregnant when Sirius saw his confusion he was quick to pause the memory once again.
Bartok sat on the edge of his seat, hands clasped together, “Yes, I noticed that as well. Obviously, we will have to get into contact with him, not sure how though, and do our best to help him.”
Harry looked over to his Daddy who had his mouth hanging open in shock, Harry wasn’t sure why but Lyle didn’t offer the information and just left the room with a thoughtful look on his face. Harry just went back to reading, ready to put down the weirdness to the stress of moving.
Harry relaxed back into the pile of bodies reveling in their warmth. It made sense that he and Neville had formed a bond of friendship like the one his Fathers shared. Before Harry could ask any more questions, a giant black dog came racing into the room, claws clicking against the wood floor as he did.
“How did you get all this back so quickly?” Harry asked, completely bewildered. Harry started looking over the list but wasn’t really taking it in.
Neville was up early that morning, Harry still sleeping against his side with an arm and leg wrapped over Neville's body. He wished he could just stay in the soft bed and enjoy his mate’s comfort. But Anna and his Grandmother scheduled an appointment with his parents’ healers early this morning to discuss their findings and what they planned to do to help them. Augusta had given Neville the choice of whether to go or not, but he had quickly insisted he wanted to go with them.
Lady Magic. If you break Oath one of your worldly possessions will be taken in repayment, usually. What is taken is usually equal to the sort of promise you break. So say, Lyle here, promises not to laugh for one whole day and breaks it, Lady Magic might take something like a favored book. Nothing extremely valuable, rare or of sentimental value. I advise you to not make Oaths on trivial things, as if you do it too often she might take away your ability to swear on possessions for the bother you have caused her. An example of when this type of Oath would be better used is if say, your enemy promises that you will come to no harm from them while you are at their house or they forfeit something equal to the damages you suffer. This was used in times when nations or families were still warring to help guarantee safety during peace negotiations.
“No thank you, Anna, I don’t drink while on the job.” And with that Percival took an at ease position behind the couch Harry was situated on. Wand clasped in his hands behind his back, ready to cast at a moments notice.
At the time of its founding, this was more so no governments or outside forces could gain a hand in the school. They had never believed such an evil man would become Headmaster so hadn’t planned for such occurrences.
“Issy, this might be my childhood home, but with Britain going the way it is I don’t want this to be my children’s childhood home. Besides, we all like the manor in Terradore better and with Harry beginning to court soon we will need more room so he can have his own clan wing and the Garden Hill manor is perfect.” Bartok made sure not to let his sadness fill his voice if he did he knew his mates would try to convince him they could make everything work. But Bartok knew they couldn’t; Harry was very powerful, and the rooms they had him in now just wouldn’t work. Not to mention Bartok didn’t want to risk Harry’s safety by staying on British shores.
When Harry first stepped foot onto the Hogwarts grounds, he knew what the child would be to him. Could hear his intoxicating magic calling out mournfully to him and all he could do was sing back, reassurance in every note.
The box was wrapped in a sky blue paper, clouds drifting lazily and a snitch fluttering around. Harry’s hand darted out before he could stop himself, reflexes attuned to catch any snitch near him, from hitting the paper. As soon as he did the paper unfolded to reveal the box within. Harry gasped in delight, loving the novelty of the wrapping paper, and he swore to keep it.
“I can understand farmers, I assume it is used as a humane way to kill animals, but I don’t understand why healers would need it.” Harry’s face scrunched up, while he could understand it that didn’t mean he liked the thought of it.
When they reached the front gates she enfolded him within her deceptively strong arms, reaching up on her tiptoes to press a kiss to his forehead. Severus was startled, unsure of what to do. But she soon pulled back, hand open and waiting for him to return her wand. Severus pulled out the fir wand, looking at it for a moment before returning it, handle out.
She scoffed, arms crossed over her bosom, “He is no son of mine. All he would ever be good for is his money, and maybe his fur as a lining for a robe.” Molly’s face was almost completely unrecognizable with how cruel it looked.
A sharp intake of breath comes from above his ear, but like always Salazar acts like nothing has changed. That this news doesn’t shake his world like it has Godric. But he knows, just as he knew the moment Harry set foot into the Headmaster’s office that they were meant to be, Godric knows that Salazar is shocked to his core.
“There is something else we need to talk about,” Arthur spoke up, his eyes a little puffy from crying. Bartok’s heart went out to the man, for the first time since they entered the room did he really consider just how stressful and earth-shattering the past few days would have to be for all of the Weasley’s. Before this moment he had been too focused on his son’s safety to even consider what the others were going through.
Sirius sighed, looking over at Remus who was now even redder than before. “We were… Well, when people love each other very much… Well…” Sirius looked around wildly trying to figure out a way to explain this.
He was currently with Bartok and Lyle down in the ward stone chambers. It was a show of great trust that the two had let him down into the room with no hesitation. He and Lyle were currently working on checking and strengthening the existing wards with Lyle adding a few more on top.
“Worry not Godric,” The oldest painting in the room spoke up. “You know what we truly are and that we are not loyal to the old man.”
Sirius reassured his pup softly that nothing bad would happen if he explored his body. Remus was much more careful now that he knew Harry had such a dysfunctional relationship with his own body. Remus gently explained that there were spells to clean your bottom if he wished to explore anal stimulation. When Harry questioned why anyone would do that, Sirius cautiously explained that some people, including himself and Remus, really enjoyed it. And that it was part of one of the main acts of sex between gay men. They were also careful to make sure Harry knew that if he didn’t like it, he didn’t have to participate in that act and that there were many other ways to achieve pleasure alone or with partners.
“Harry please, call me Remus or Moony, like you, did when you were a baby,” Remus hesitated to add that last bit. He had been too worried he would be ripped from Harry again to let them get too attached to each other. Although he didn’t know why considering the whole reason he said yes to becoming a Professor was to see his cub. His wolf spoke up, that quiet growl of ‘Liar’.
“Yes, Harry, and I think you have misunderstood what the charms on that bracelet are for. If you will notice, the Longbottom charm is the only platinum crest on your bracelet.” Remus pointed out as he lifted Harry’s hand. Harry looked at the charm as if noticing this for the first time. “The charms for families you are born or adopted into are always gold. Platinum charms are for those you are married into, so by offering you the Longbottom charm in platinum, he wasn’t asking you to be his brother, but his husband. I am sure if he realized you weren’t sure of the meaning he would have waited until you knew to ask you.”
Harry stumbled, suddenly in an unknown room, everything around him was slightly off. The edges of the room quivered as if at any moment the walls would crumble and the colors of everything desaturated. As Harry turned to look at more of the room he saw Sirius and Remus silently sitting on a settee at the end of a large bed, much smaller than his own, that had what would be garish red coverings if it weren’t for how washed out all the colors were.
Godric nodded, and even though he was much older than the woman in front of him, she reminded him too much of Rowena for him to not automatically defer to her. Godric had a healthy fear of angered witches. “Yes, Ma’am, I felt the bond that formed earlier and wanted to know what was happening. I assume by your presence Dowager Lady Longbottom, that the bonding I felt earlier was between Harry and your Grandson?”
It was Augusta to speak up, “The only reason I can think of is if she was never married to Arthur… but I distinctly remember attending their wedding.” Her worry was barely contained, the unease of the unknown clear to any who paid attention.
He quickly got dressed and headed out of the room to find Anna leaning up against the wall, her long red hair up in a twist and her clothes more professional than he had seen so far.
“As you can clearly see, Minister Fudge, Harry’s removal, and our Guardianship was necessary to his well-being. And it is in his best interest to remain with us.” Anna looked over to the Minister who seemed to have come to a decision, but before he could speak, Dumbledore interrupted. But Fudge just used this time to further analyze the situation.
The trance was broken, and suddenly he heard the commotion his family was making. He looked up into Issy’s wide, terrified eyes. “Mummy? What’s wrong?” Harry started to panic in the face of his families terror. Head spinning around as he looked into each of his parent’s face. They all look like they had just seen someone be mauled, and Harry didn’t understand what was going on.
Harry was quick to act, running into a leap and launching himself at the werewolf with a battle cry. Remus barely moved, Harry was much too skinny to move him. Despite this Remus moved away in confusion, Sirius sat up, obviously just as bewildered.
When he finished he could feel a motherly presence looking over him, through him, to his very core. And then the search was over and with a tightening of foreign magic around him, like a hug, it was gone, a glowing roll of parchment in its place, sealed with wax that slowly shifted between every color imaginable, pulsating as it changed. An infinity symbol that shifted its colors from white to black but was mostly a shade of gray in the middle. One side holding a sun in gold and the other a moon in silver.
Severus had no plans of doing what the man commanded, he would force his shadow self to mess up potions, every once and a while throwing Dumbledore a bone when it seemed like the man might finally snap and kill him. But only small things like cutting out a step of a well-known potion.
When Neville got back to Harry’s bed later that day he collapsed in the bed and was soon snoring lightly.
Bartok looked down at his son, taking in the slightly unfocused eyes and mouth that was hanging open. He knew this was probably overwhelming, so he did what he could, leaning down to be at eye level with Harry. “Harry, son, do you need me to go and retrieve the painting?”
There was so much more than Harry could even take in, and he was overwhelmed, relieved to enter the bank. It looked the same as the one in Britain, so it was a relief to see. They were escorted back to Helix’s office, the Goblin sitting behind his desk with stacks of paper surrounding him.
“Now, Harry, first why don’t we call Tiptop to retrieve a calming draught?” The House-Elf popped in the moment Remus said her name, hand outstretched with a small vial in her long fingers. Harry took it without complaint, downing it in a quick gulp. “Thank you Tiptop,” Remus said, the House-Elf ignoring the two adults as she popped away.
Severus wasn’t as brave as her, he would never be and all he could offer her was the advice to make a pact with Pomona and Filius since they were the two other members of staff Severus was sure would be just as outraged by Dumbledore’s actions and both brave enough to take a stand. Severus had never spent any time with his colleagues, the bindings Dumbledore placed him under not allowing him to get close to anyone, so he didn’t know who else was trustworthy.
Sirius coughed to clear his throat, “Yes, a little pain during sex can be pleasurable. But that depends on the people involved. Some people enjoy it and some don’t. It’s just something you will have to try to see if it works for you.”
Hedwig was the one to finally break him out of his thoughts, obviously upset that he had ignored her for so long. Harry was quick to make it up to her, rubbing at her beak that was shiny with bacon grease. “Hey girl, have you been enjoying the new grounds?”
Remus directed them all to the couch, keeping Harry between them so that they could get settled in front of the pensive Remus retrieved this morning for Sirius. This pensive was only a shallow stone bowl, runes carved into its surface, the liquid in the basin swirling like smoke. “Now, Harry do you know what this is?” Harry shook his head so Remus continued, “This, Harry, is a pensive. A pensive is a magical device that you can place your memories into so that you can show them to others or review them.”
Severus' skin had been crawling all day, and he couldn't figure out why. Every brush of fabric against his skin set him on edge, raising his hackles.
Severus looked down at his trousers in surprise, his erection pressed tight up against the inseam. It had been years since Severus had last seen the organ filled with blood, the sight of it was surprising.
Under the slavery spell, his body had only needed food and water, anything else was blocked out. So while he saw his member every day, either while using the restroom, showering or changing he hadn't seen it like this since he was a teen, body still growing into itself. He couldn't even remember exactly what it looked like then, but he was sure it had grown since then.
Neville took his Grandmother’s hand within his own, looking for the comfort of her quickly squeezing back, letting him know he wasn’t alone.
The reason why Bartok was so irate was the hearing had been scheduled for tomorrow, and this had been planned for months now. But this morning, an hour before lunch, a letter arrived from the Ministry informing him of the change.
They kept their conversation light as they all sat tensely, Molly interrupting their talks, scolding them all in turns without even walking into the room. And even though Arthur had made plenty of food for all of them Molly was in the kitchen cooking, and she was outraged when they said no to more food. Coming into the living room to scream at them for not appreciating all her hard work. Arthur shooed the boys up to their room so they didn’t have to listen to their Mother’s screeching. An owl swooped through the kitchen window, dropping its burden right atop Molly’s head.
“What she doesn’t know won’t make her mad at us,” Lyle wheedled, David used his patented puppy dog eyes.
And that was when Sal asked to know more about Godric's mate. At first, Godric was hesitant in what he said, but the more he went on, the easier it was to talk about Harry. Salazar didn't seem bitter as he asked more questions. His curiosity real and the more he found out, the more Sal seemed to like Harry, at the end when he said he would really like to meet him there was nothing but true happiness in his words.
Time started moving again and they were running towards each other, Harry jumping into his arms and wrapping his legs around Neville’s torso. Their foreheads came to rest against each other, eyes both tearing up as a golden light burst from within them, surrounding them like a warm blanket, Its embrace cozy and comforting.
Harry invited Neville to have a picnic lunch with him after he saw the pure glee on his friends face when they walked into the breakfast room. His eyes lit up and his smile was blinding. Neville had barely acknowledged anyone else sitting at the table, hand tight in Harry’s as he scanned the grounds admiring the many plants that flourished there.
Sirius was distressed and yelled back, “I assure you, that isn’t true! Hell, if it was both Remus and I would have lost our cocks long ago!”
When the door to the room opened once more Remus turned faster than anyone, hackles rising at the thought that the person entering could be a danger to his cub. But it wasn’t, it was just another one of his previous students and their guardian.
When Harry finally spoke again, it was barely above a whisper, “I… I don’t know…” Harry looked up at them, looking like a lost little boy, looking for anyone to find him. Remus scooted closer, wrapping Harry up between them.
Salazar had sat and given Godric his full attention, gaze piercing. But now it was time to tell him about the most significant change that affected him, which was the shift in creature clans.
Tiptop had delivered a blanket and a basketful of food the moment they moved to sit, scolding them for grass stains they had yet to get. Neville sat close to him, skin flushed red from the sun, their arms brushing and fingers still tangled. They were relaxing back after they finished lunch, just enjoying each other’s silent company. Harry hadn’t felt this content in living memory. He had thought he knew contentment when he was safe in his new parent’s arms. But this was something completely different, something Harry couldn’t categorize if he tried. All Harry knew was that he never wanted to lose this feeling.
The man was shocked, realizing he had yet to introduce himself. “Oh, sorry, Godric Gryffindor at your service.” He bowed towards the Claremores, hair falling in front of his face, hiding their shocked faces from him. “I shall take my leave now, please take care of my little mate while I take care of what I need to.”
“Dumbledore of course, how else would we be so powerful and smart?” Ginny said a proud smile on her face. All the Weasleys were shocked, mouths gaping, unable to even process what was just revealed to them.
Harry couldn’t wait for the day when such things didn’t make him want to cry, but for now, he had to handle that this was his state of mind. Take this time to think over his whole life and deal with the emotions he had long suppressed. Luckily Harry now had a caring family who was willing to give him this time. Who were strong while he was so weak.
Dumbledore sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose, so the last two days had been an absolute mess. Sure he knew he could get everything back under control, but that didn’t mean Albus didn’t wish he didn’t have to. “I know Dedalus, we should have had that vote in the bag, but somehow those filthy creatures wormed their way out of justice.”
Bartok woke early the next morning, well before four am, but instead of his usual habit of getting out of bed and heading downstairs for coffee he stayed in bed with all his mates. When they tried to put Harry into his own bed last night he had only clutched onto David tighter, refusing to be let go. So instead they put him into their own bed, still clutched onto David while the Werewolf read. Once they were all ready to go to sleep they just curled in around the two, their bed being far big enough for such a thing. At one point Harry had woke slightly but Bartok was quick to ease him back to sleep.
born a Black, and even though her name had changed long ago she was still Black at heart. She was the one to show him how to poison someone’s tea, his Uncle Algie had never dared look at Neville again after that. It was one of Augusta’s favorite things to do, to offer Algernon tea, in her most expensive tea set, and see the instinctive flinch the man gave at just the word. Neville was convinced the only reason his Gran had the man over at all was just to offer him tea. To remind him of what she would do to protect those she cared about.
Harry walked around the room, scanning the sparse bookshelf, the old Quidditch posters, and knick-knacks that cluttered the many shelves. On top of the desk, sitting in a place of pride was a snitch on a pedestal next to a picture of three young boys standing with their arms slung around each other. Harry reached out to lift it, the strange feeling of having something in his hand that should’ve taken some effort to lift but was surprisingly weightless. He studied the picture, thankful Sirius and Remus were allowing him to explore for himself. The boy in the middle was obviously Remus, a vivid scar splitting his eyebrow that now, as a man, was only a thin white line. The boy on the left had to be Sirius, something dog-like about his grin even then. And lastly was a boy with curly hair that somehow proved to be messier than Harry’s own.
With all the guests gone, Issy seemed to finally have enough of holding her tongue. She began squealing loudly, causing Harry to jump from his place on her chest. But she was pulling him back in, Lyle and David joining them in the sudden group hug. Harry was very confused at their excitement, but she soon cleared that up. “Oh Harry, seeing you bond was spectacular! He is so handsome, and we are all so happy for you!”
Godric used the wand, his being locked in the chamber with Salazar, which even knowing it would soon be back in rightful hands still fought him. The most he could do was cast a spell used on children with nightmares to force them to sleep a full twelve hours. It was an ancient spell that went out of use because of its tendency to cause Sleeping Disease if overused.
“Yes, we have in fact adopted Harry, it was finalized a week ago with the Goblins.” Bartok fought to keep the smug look off his face when he saw how dark Dumbledore’s gaze had gone at the news.
Arthur stood up, towering over Molly, and as she tried to stand Arthur’s magic lashed out and stuck her to the chair. “What do you mean we aren’t married?!” Arthur screamed, the table shaking under his uncontrolled magic.
David sighed, popping his neck before continuing. “While it is true that the killing curse has a horror-filled history, it is technically not Black magic. It is, however, Dark magic, which is one end of the Grey magic spectrum with Light magic at the other end. The only reason we don’t classify the killing curse as Black magic is that while it can be used for harm, there are circumstances it can be used for good.”
Remus came into the room with bags clutched in his hand, apologizing for Sirius’ exuberance with an exasperated but fond smile. Tiptop popped in to take their baggage to the room they would be staying in, but before she could go, Remus leaned down to whisper something in her ear that turned his cheeks pink.
Harry had always had a secret urge to own nice things. Both because they were denied to him for twelve years but also because it was nice to own nice things. So this beautiful tail, luxuriously soft and tipped in what looked like liquid gold. Harry clearly remembered the desperate urge he felt when he first entered his Gringotts’ vault. The almost violent urge to throw himself atop the piles of gold and protect it like a mythological dragon with its horde.
David shook his head solemnly, and Lyle jumped up to go gather Harry’s presents. Harry was oblivious to the whole situation, too busy testing the myriad of cheeses on offer, Tiptop having gone to the trouble to put name places on each one. So far it seemed the soft cheese such a Brie and Boursin were his favorites.
“Then what was he doing?” Harry asked cautiously. If he needed to Harry would protect Sirius with everything he had.
Unlike his Father, Alice’s hair was still full, just limp and shockingly white. Augusta would come monthly to cut both of their hair as they had worn it…
Augusta went stiff once more, voice whip-like as it lashed against their skin. “Regulus has been dead for years.” Her wand was now out, grip tight and sickly green sparks jumping from the tip.
“He will die a slow, painful death,” Salazar hissed, grabbing onto Godric’s arm so they could flame into the wardroom. The fire enveloped them both, flames licking at their exposed skin as they quickly shot up many floors.
“Like the kind of bond you and Lyle have?” Harry questioned, unsure of what to think of the whole situation.
Sirius reached up towards Harry’s waist, pulling him down until Harry was sitting in his lap the older man’s arms wrapped around him.
Bartok could see how hopeful the twins looked, and luckily, Bartok had already bought tickets months ago for his family to go to the World Cup, but they had thought not to go now that they had Harry and not an extra ticket. It was either that or Bartok would stay home because, out of all of his mates, he was least invested in Quidditch as a whole. “I am sure Harry would love that, my family already has tickets so we could camp next to each other to get to know each other better. Harry has spoken highly of all of you and we would all like to get to know you.”
Remus' mouth was agape, but he swallowed and focused back on the man in front of him. “And what does that have to do with you attacking my mate?” The growl had faded until it was barely audible.
… features, his face smooshed up against the pillow. Harry tentatively reached over, fingers barely touching the skin as he mapped out the curve of Neville’s ear, the line of his jaw, the bow of his upper lip and the bridge of his nose. Finally coming to rest on Neville’s temple, nervously letting the full weight of his hand rest on the side of his sleeping friends face.
I leave to Severus Tobias Prince of Cokeworth, England, if he shall survive me, Vault 590. I have left a letter for you as well as some rare potions ingredients. Lily also added her gifts to this vault and approved of everything I have put into it.
“Really good, Mum! My ears don’t even hurt anymore, and I don’t need my glasses either!” Harry was excited about this development. Even with his glasses, his vision had always been blurry, so he had never really experienced just how detailed everything could be. Even the patterns in the wooden table were now overwhelming him.
Bartok relaxed back into his chair, he had asked his question in such a way that anything they might know would set it off. The money theft, abuse, or the contract. But since they had all been telling the truth his mind eased. He only had a few more questions he needed to ask to make sure that these people would be safe to have around his son.
“Don’t worry, I am sure Neville won’t push you to do anything you aren’t ready for, and if he does you come to us and we will handle it. And if you never want to be intimate in that way with Neville, you don’t have to.” Remus assured Harry, wanting to make sure his Godson knew that no one had the right to force him to do anything sexual if he didn’t want to.
“The Peverell family was known for their use of necromancy, soul magic, and their inventions. Now before you ask not all necromancy and soul magics are Black, and the fact that the Peverell line did not go insane long ago proves that most if not all members used their powers wisely.”
But this would be the old man’s downfall, as soon he made sure Harry was okay he work towards ruining Dumbledore for everything he had ever done.
“Shh, only true love’s kiss shall wake me,” Even after the millenniums of sleep his voice was as smooth as ever.
Arthur looked down, tears welling in his eyes, and the son next to him, took his hand and spoke up. “My name is Bill, and I am a curse breaker in Gringotts employ. My Father confronted the three, a truth serum slipped into their tea. Not only did we find out that Molly never married our Father and isn’t even our mother, but that Ron and Ginny aren’t our siblings. But what was most important to this situation is that we found out what their plans for Harry were. While my Father wouldn’t have disowned the two children for not being his, as he has raised them, what led to their disownment was the blatant theft and plans to force Harry into a marriage with Ginny where she would then produce an heir and kill Harry.”
A clearing of the throat, somehow stately, finally pulled their minds away from focusing solely on each other. They both looked over to see Madam Longbottom, appearing regal in her deep blue formal robes, watching them with the tiniest smile gracing her harsh features. “Well, it looks like your mothers’ were correct.” Harry’s eyebrows raised in confusion but the Dowager continued without having to be asked. “When you were both babies you were inseparable. You both screamed when visits were over. Both of your first bouts of accidental magic were even inspired by the other. Neville, your first sign of magic was when Harry was first starting to learn to walk, he fell on his behind, you were in your mother’s arms and once Harry started crying you apparated over to him. After that, you started conjuring flowers for him to make him smile. It was very adorable and we were all so proud.”
Neville took the charm in hand, Harry’s in the other, and attached the charm, running the pads of his fingers over the blemish-free skin so gently, the hair on Harry’s arm raised. Neville lifted Harry’s hand to his face kissing the back of it, lips lingering. Electricity passing between them.
When Arthur said this, too astonished by the revelation to hold in his answer. Bill gave him a searching glance, before gathering his Father into a hug, holding him tight. Arthur wasn’t sure why but he was suddenly crying, being held up by his little boy who was now so much bigger than him.
This was done with her permission and blessing. This story for the first few chapters will follow her story closely, I will be adding lore, interactions, and emotions to those chapters. The farther along my version gets the more different it will become. If you have read Nest of Love you will know all the Claremore family OCs and the OCs who are Harry's mates. I hope to do them justice but still add my spin on them along with at least one of my OCs. Lastly, I hope you enjoy my choices for Harry's canon character mates. Please read the relationship tags to see who I will be adding.
Augusta sipped her tea, looking over the rim with piercing eyes, “Mr. Claremore, I assume we will be welcome in your home for a while to allow the boys’ bond to settle?”
“Percival, you know all my mates, but I would like to introduce you to our son, Harry.” Harry choked back the lump in his throat from the pride so clearly displayed in both Bartok’s voice and face at the word son. “Harry, this is my dear friend and mentor, Percival Graves. Percival is a Head Auror in Terradore and is here to stand as a bodyguard for both today’s meeting and the Will reading tomorrow.”
Arthur was confused, but Molly had tucked the letter into her apron pocket so there was no way he could figure out what was wrong. He was worried about his children. But then, another three owls swooped through the window, dropping their letters in front of Arthur before zooming away. Each letter had the Gringotts’ crest, one addressed to Arthur and the other two to Ginny and Ron. He was confused about why the Goblins would contact his youngest two since they had no vaults of their own.
He took the broom from Harry’s hand and immediately went to work, abruptly ending the conversation and leaving no room for Harry to respond.
Harry was silent. He shifted uncomfortably in his seat and stared at McGonagall, crossing his arms over his chest.
Harry was frustrated. He sat on his bed with a scowl, pretending to read a book as he listened to Blaise and Draco talk. Draco had promised they would continue where they had left earlier, and now Blaise had been sitting in their dorm for what felt like hours. Well, not promised, but it was bothering Harry nonetheless.
“Although Ron is being rude,” Hermione said as she smacked Ron upside the head, “he is quite right. You don’t look…the best at the moment, Harry. Is everything alright?”
Malfoy huffed and rolled his eyes. “Alright, Potter. If I’m going to sit down and have tea with you, I’m going to do it right.”
Harry was suddenly next to Draco, so when the other turned around, he yelped, locking eyes with Harry.
If he was thinking about Draco before, now he was going to go crazy. Harry set down his work slowly, looking over everything on Draco’s side of the room. He picked up his silly perfume, smelling it was a small smile. He knew once the other was back he’d have to smell it every day. How
Harry handed him the broom while brushing the dust off his shirt “Sweep the floors, everything else is done.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. Even when he was a mess, he was still snarky. “Of course, Potter, I’m as dandy as a dancing dragon,” he said, his voice a hoarse whisper. He reached up and slowly pulled Harry’s hands off of him, curling into his blankets.
Malfoy then managed to fall right into a pile of cobwebs that covered him like a blanket. His whole body tensed and he let out a shrill shriek.
Harry was lost in thought, thinking about all of his friends when he felt himself crash into a person in front of him. He yelped as he stumbled over and his glasses were launched into the air as the person in front of him collapsed to the floor from the collision. Harry rubbed his head as he tried to search for his glasses when he heard a crunch.
Crabbe and Goyle both seemed to be fighting while Malfoy and Pansy stood off slightly to the side, Pansy looking especially peeved.
“This is precisely why you are spending a week with Mr. Potter,” she said, sitting back in her chair. “I have nothing more to say to you both. Go back to class now, and I will meet you two in the dungeons tonight”
It was incredibly awkward at first. Harry could tell Draco did not want to be here and was still crying slightly. But as Harry watched him get tired, Draco relaxed. Harry took advantage of this and shifted so the other could lay down while Harry rested a hand on his head, gently stroking his hair.
“Sorry, I don’t actually know. I was thinking we could find the easiest path to follow and just… look around,” Harry said, shrugging.
It wasn’t until the last night of their detention that Harry noticed that something was wrong with Malfoy again. He had gotten back from the dungeons later that night and had wanted to explore a bit. Plus, he got some alone time. When he returned, Malfoy was asleep, the small nightlight flickering in its corner.
When Harry walked into McGonagall’s office, he was greeted with commotion. Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy were all standing in front of him, who were all facing McGonagall.
Harry nodded with enthusiasm. He straddled Draco as he started to strip his own clothes, much less refined than the other. But his attention was on Draco the whole time. He watched as his pale skin was exposed with each button, his faded scars peeking through. What caught Harry’s attention was how pink Draco’s nipples looked against his pale skin. He pressed the other’s hips down with a strong hold and gently flicked his tongue over the blonde’s perked nipple.
When Harry finally came out again, he was still miffed, huffing as he sat on his bed roughly. His eyes burned holes in the back of Blaise’s head. Draco still paid no mind, finally finishing his game with Blaise.
“I'm sure you did,” Malfoy said with a small smirk. He poured two cups, passing one to Harry as he took his own. As he took a sip, Malfoy’s features relaxed, a wisp of a smile on his lips.
Magorian didn’t say anything for a moment before calling out to another. Two more centaurs suddenly seemed to appear next to Magorian; they had been camouflaged perfectly within the trees.
Draco huffed, tucking his hair as he went back down. Harry’s fingers tangled in his hair again, his head falling back into the pillow.
Malfoy stood up and glared at him. “I was hoping I had gotten here early enough to avoid you, Potter.” He turned back to grab a couple of things he needed for the night.
Harry looked down and his jaw dropped. Clear as day, there lay his clock on his wrist. His numbers were still zero of course, but they had appeared on his arms like they had never left. That, combined with the fact that Malfoy’s clock was at zero as well-
“What do you take me for? I’m not a prick, you know,” Harry huffed. “And like I said before, it’s just a little spider—”
Harry frowned. He knew Draco’s parents weren’t good people, but it was only until recently did he realize how truly awful they did treat him. He scooted closer to the other, their shoulders gently brushing.
“Oh, God!” he moaned, wrapping his legs around Harry’s waist. Draco brought him in deeper, feeling places that he never thought Harry would reach. All the while he felt Harry’s gaze on him, watching him come undone beneath him.
Harry was jolted from his thoughts and his head snapped up. He hadn’t realized that he had been completely absorbed into his own world.
Harry walked past the common room and into his dorm room, where he was greeted by a trembling Draco sitting on his bed. Draco’s eyes snapped up to meet Harry’s and he grimaced.
“I don’t want to go into it right now, but quite obviously they do. But when you live with an abusive, power-hungry father and a neglectful mother, you learn to cope.”
Slughorn came to check on the boys’ cauldron. “Well done! Now, bottle up your potion in these three vials and bring them to the front. After that, you are dismissed.”
Harry started to put his shirt back on as Draco made a face, scowling. “My shirt’s all dirty,” he grumbled. He still didn’t have his wand since the sixth years took it, so he couldn't spell his cum away.
Harry only shook his head. “It’s alright, I figured that was probably what it was. I’m just more curious about Malfoy’s clock now.”
Even with Blaise gone, Harry still didn’t say a word. He looked at Draco with a frown, pulling out his book again as he pretended to read once more.
“Harry, that would explain his numbers- and it explains yours as well! What if, because Voldemort used you as a Horcrux, it messed up your clock somehow? Then, Malfoy’s clock would’ve gotten screwed up as well! I don’t know how it’s fixed itself all of a sudden, though, maybe enough time has passed to fix itself naturally. Or you two being so close to each other recently could have been the catalyst. Were you there when his numbers reached Zero?” Hermione asked question after question, always excited to find out more.
He eventually did find them both in the dining hall, Hermione chastising Ron for eating too much, too fast.
Harry grabbed the phial and downed the potion finding it to lack any sort of fun flavoring. It wasn’t bad, but it was hardly the bubblegum or the blue raspberry flavored potions from earlier.
Also if you see a spelling or grammatical error I'm sorry I posted this chapter super early and I was getting to head off to sleep so I probably missed some things.
“Alright, I’ll be back with your meds.” She gave her husband a silent nod letting him know that she understood what type of potion and the dosage Harry was to receive. She left the room and instantly felt a paper airplane note poking against her hand. She grabbed the note and noticed an owl staring at her an envelope attached to her leg. She petted the owl and grabbed the envelope, which was written in her sisters’ elegant penmanship, it also had the Ministry wax seal for the Department of Magical Child Endangerment and Abuse or the DMCEA for short.
Harry watched the exuberant seven-year-old bolt up the stairs he was beginning to think Teddy liked the Weasley’s more than he did Andromeda, he figured their house was more fun than playing with his grandma. He understood he always did like spending time at The Weasley Burrow especially if the twins were there. He figured Teddy was the same way, he knew the twins were probably already filling him full of bad ideas to enact once he got to Hogwarts. Nymphadora, according to her mother, was quite a little hellion during her time at Hogwarts. Both hoped that Teddy would turn out to be more like Remus and not so much like Nymphadora.
Bellatrix watched as the child finished his dinner in record time; not even her own children could eat that quickly and at Rigel’s age he was starting to become a bottomless pit. She turned around a grabbed a flannel and ran it under the sink finding the child to have gravy all around his mouth.
“We know Molly was worried about my little accident yesterday that made me have a short detour to St. Mungo’s.” Harry explained as Ron landed hard on the floor behind him. “I swear that is third time this week that you have landed arse first out of the floor, you are worse than Teddy when it comes to the floo.” He teased helping the slightly irritated redhead from the floor as the four made their way to the cafeteria for tea.
“Would you like some tea?” Bellatrix suggested figuring that tea was a good enough excuse to have a conversation with Minerva. Besides, she’d rather take her chances in a locked cage with a Nundu then finish the conversation with Dumbledore.
Vernon and Petunia came running down the stairs with Vernon holding a gun. “Who the hell are you?” Vernon exclaimed pointing the gun at the giant that had broken down the cabin door.
Bellatrix sat the phial’s in her hand on the counter next to the delicious looking shake. “Harry, we are going to have to move you into another room, but first I think you can easily down a few potions and a quick shake.
“I think I’d like that.” Harry whispered but luckily the room was quiet, so Regulus was able to hear it.
“I’m going to go talk to Mediwitch Umbridge and see what happened.” Regulus said turning on his heal trying not to cry.
“Wait he’s Draco’s mate?” Regulus asked not getting that far into the chart before having questions regarding what was written.
“One problem Victorie is five and is rather short for her age, Teddy on the other hand is tall for his age.” Harry reminded he did not want to spend a day dealing with kiddie rides.
Harry sighed and placed the plate in the proper cabinet and pulled down his jumper sleeves so Vernon couldn’t see the tattoo.
“Nothing to apologize for Mrs. Riddle.” Regulus said flatly everyone in the room understood and that display would never be spoken about again.
“I feel the same way you do right now Trix. James and Lily loved that child more than anything in the world and Sirius was so happy to be named as the Godfather.” He muttered shedding a tear at the idea of his brother.
Kieran nodded and walked over to the cabinetry on the other side of the room. He pulled out a lime green blanket from the heating cabinet and draped it over Harry’s small body. “I know this a lot, but you are being very brave.”
Harry wondered what Ron’s announcement was, he bent down to Teddy’s level and pulled the child into his arms. “Be good for Molly, and remember that I love you.” He kissed his cheek before stepping back into the fireplace and yelling “Ministry of Magic.”
The trio sighed slowly separating themselves from their office chairs. Harry sighed seeing Ron and Neville’s expression. “Morning Theseus.” Harry said trying to sound like his usual self but failed since he knew they were all in deep trouble for failing a raid.
The three left the ‘cubical farm’ and headed down the long corridor to the elevator. “Well that was an awful morning, I have a feeling I might be needing some Firewhisky to get the sound of Theseus yelling. Sometimes, I think he is more terrifying than Snape.” Neville muttered looking down at his watch. “I just want to go home and snuggle Hermione.”
“Thank you.” He said looking over the chart and raised an eyebrow. “Harry Potter, really?” He questioned seeing that Harry was now an Auror and was injured in a raid. Draco knew that this case would probably be the same as the one from earlier in which a father had a meltdown at the idea of his son being treated by Death Eater scum, and how he should have suffered the same fate as his now dead father.
“I have a 10-year-old boy with a Brain Aneurysm on top of multiple prior MTBI’s. I need help with the Brain Aneurysm.” Kieran said trying to be quick in his explanation. He figured Adrien didn’t need to know or didn’t care about all the other injuries most Neuro Healers only cared about the brain and brain only.
Bellatrix quickly grabbed the supplies needed to get an IV line into the child and handed them to her husband while she left the room to go get the necessary potions needed.
Kieran watched the child down the potion and watch his wife reach for the next potion which was the nutrient potion. “The next potion which you will typically take with breakfast and dinner is a nutrient potion. It is like a muggle multivitamin; it is loaded with vitamins and minerals your body is currently deficient in. I know it is lunch but since this your first dose of these potions we are giving it to you with lunch, so you have two doses today.” He said before Harry could question why he mentioned taking it with breakfast when it was currently lunch time.
Harry ducked into one of the fireplaces lining the main entrance and flooed to Andromeda’s house to pick up Teddy. He landed neatly in her living room, he had long gotten used to not landing on his arse when using the floo network. “Hey Teddy.” He said watching his godson coloring. “Thank you for watching him Andy.” He said as a cup of tea levitated over to him as he sat down on the floor next to Teddy.
“I know you’ve been given a lot to process and to decide. Have you thought about a flavor of shake you would enjoy? I’d like to see you get down a protein shake and a few nutrient potions before your meeting with Regulus and Andromeda.”
“How is Teddy, when I visit Andromeda and Narcissa I see him on occasion he really is a cute kid.” Draco admitted glad that Harry was raising Teddy. “I can assure this next part won’t take that much longer.” He said grabbing his wand. “Take a deep breath.” He instructed running his wand along Harry’s punctured lung. “Another deep breath.” In what sounded almost like a coo, Harry had to have imagined that.
He walked the short distance back to his office and locked it with his magic. He needed a second to curse at the wall. “Fuck!” He exclaimed loudly looking up at the ceiling. It wasn’t until a few more explicit words that he noticed Bellatrix was cuddling her husband on the couch in his office.
“You could always skip the pie and I can make up another shake this time without the extra protein. Since he enjoyed my first one this time. Oh, what about a hot fudge sundae? Never met a child that didn’t love those.” Grant suggested happily.
Neville tucked his head into his robe sleeve to muffle his boisterous laughter. “I could almost picture Snape sneering that you missed a spot. Let’s get lunch, I’m hungry.” He muttered he was most of the way finished with his report.
“I could tell based on body language when I gave him the dragon that he had probably never been giving anything nice like that from his guardians. He seems deeply uncomfortable with the idea of physical touch. He also seems reluctant to trust adults to get him the justice he needs. He’s probably been in this situation before with trying to tell someone about his home life and it did not end well.”
Bellatrix rose from the place on the stretcher and went to read Kieran’s note on the dosage of pain potion Harry should receive. ‘
They found Hermione sitting in their usual spot eating her usual salad. Neville, Harry, and Ron went to the line trying to decide what they wanted to eat. Harry decided on a turkey and bacon wrap with guacamole and ranch with a watermelon flavored water from the fridge, ever since becoming an Auror he was all about eating healthy, Ron ordered a burrito with all the fixings along with some pumpkin juice, some things just didn’t change. Neville grabbed a small cup of fries along with a bowl of potato cheese soup, he too grabbed a flavored water, his however, was blueberry pomegranate.
Harry sat up and pulled his shirt back on and fought with his robes to lay the way he liked them to lay. He wished he could just wear jumpers and jeans to work and not the stupid robes they had to wear. He hit his head against the pillow trying dispel the thoughts he was having about a certain blonde healer. Damnit, it had been seven years since he had last seen Malfoy and all that he wanted to do was wrap his arms around Malfoy’s pale neck and kiss him. Like that would ever happen, it was Malfoy and he was Potter, or as Pansy loved to call him Potty.
Another freaky thing on the list of freaky things the hated him for. Plus, Draco was clearly a boy’s name along with being an odd name. The tattoo enraged Vernon because not only was Harry a ‘freak’ but the tattoo also meant he was a ‘fairy’. Vernon had threatened him a few times to show him what it meant to be a pillow-biter; but never did.
“Harry.” Kieran began trying to think how to word his next question of sexual abuse or inappropriate touching. “Did they ever touch you in a sexual way that made you uncomfortable?” He finally asked hoping that the child would say no to something.
He did think Draco was quite handsome, but there was no chance of that happening. Draco was probably straighter than an arrow, besides he could just picture the headlines The Daily Prophet could come up with if he ever did get together with Draco. It was safer with everyone thinking the Savior was straight. Besides he had yet to meet anyone who could stand sleeping next to Harry when he was having his nightmares. His brain was truly fucked since the battle. He was damaged goods and he didn’t want to subject anyone to that. He was also trying to raise a seven-year-old Teddy Lupin, since after all he was once an orphan due to war and he didn’t want Teddy to deal with the same things he had to deal with growing up. He didn’t know of many guys who would be cool with a seven-year-old kid; even if he wasn’t biologically Harry’s. He did however consider Teddy to be his son.
Bellatrix walked into the room carrying the phials of pain potion and peace potion. She sat down the pain potion down on the counter next to her. “I’ve contacted both Andromeda and Regulus about your case and to hopefully set up a meeting.” She sat down on the edge of the stretcher and grabbed the dark blue peace potion.
It warmed Draco to know that even if Harry had never known his magical family,  he at least had their home and history right here with him.
“You have nothing to fear.” He extended his arm in an attempt to both end the uncomfortable conversation and to steer them toward the house. She looked him directly in the eyes, as if measuring him, and finally took his arm to continue.
On Friday, Draco came downstairs for breakfast. He and his mother were to meet Mrs. Granger-Weasley soon at Inviting Invitations to pick out the cards for the unity ball, and Mrs. Malfoy was reviewing the final invitation list.
“Mr. Malfoy,” she said, causing Harry to look up and meet Draco’s eyes. He looked so beautiful, and Draco could not believe how good it felt to see him after a mere week. Harry smiled brightly and did not seem to care at all that Draco sweaty and flushed and a hot, melting mess.
“Thank you, my darling, wonderful, beautiful mother,” he replied with a kiss to her cheek, and called for Quelter to change the seating arrangements.
“It is an honor, Mr. Potter,” the professor said. Draco did not hear him speak English often, and he could not help but notice the lilt of his accent.
Quelter floated the chess board onto the second card table and poured glasses of wine and brandy for their group. Draco heard Mrs. Granger-Weasley suggest a game of Loo and smirked. His mother was quite good in that game, and Potter and Mrs. Granger-Weasley were in for a massacre.
Potter mounted his broom and glided into the air, turning around to wait for Draco. When Draco mounted his own, he shot into the air much faster than expected and his stomach jolted in surprise.
Potter motioned to land, and when they did, it allowed Draco to eye Potter closely for the first time since he arrived. His hair was wild from the wind and a few errant strands were damp with sweat against his forehead. He was breathing quickly from exertion, and when his eyes met Draco’s, his smile was so warm and bright that it made Draco’s chest ache.
“Good evening,” Potter said with a bow. “Mrs. Malfoy, Mr. Malfoy.” His dress robes were plain but fine, however Draco eyed his black and silver brocade waistcoat with envy. He would have to inquire about its origins.
Hermione Granger opened it, out of breath, her dark curls escaping her chignon. If he did not know better, he would think he had caught her in a scandalous predicament.
“Thanks. Would you accompany me to get some punch?” Draco looked down at the still-full butterbeer in his hand, but he was not going to let that keep him from taking the escape that Potter had offered.
“Good morning, Draco. You look quite handsome this morning.” Draco may have asked Fitzy to dress him in his finest daywear for his meeting with Potter and Mrs. Granger-Weasley, but he did not see fit to share that information.
“Draco—Draco,” Harry uttered between kisses. “I have oil.” Draco stopped and looked up at him. “If you want.”
“Her friendship with Harry Potter is her only saving grace. Her family is absolutely mad and always has been.”
. Our history is tangled and messy and has been since our first night at Hogwarts. Ignoring that cannot be wise, and does not even seem possible. It would only make matters worse in the long run.”
so that he could see the empty salon before him. Stepping inside, he thought of the moment when he had given Harry his present in this room, when they had kissed and held each other before making their way upstairs to be together for the first time. He had known then that their time would be fleeting, and while he regretted hurting Harry, he could never regret the small amount of time they did share together.
He was truly turning into the most awkward wizard alive. He used to alleviate these feelings with sneering and name-calling. Being amiable was difficult work, indeed, and no one ever seemed to notice his effort. What was the point?
The rest of dinner continued much the same way, with Mrs. Greengrass speaking thrice as much as anyone else and at a louder and louder volume with each glass of wine she consumed. She then demanded that Draco and Miss Astoria perform a singing duet when they retired to the parlour. Draco took a deep breath, wanting nothing more than to leave this charade and return to his quiet home to pine for Harry Potter in peace. He plastered the best smile he could and offered to play the
“It was a little scary, but once I got used to it, it was great fun!” He fiddled with Draco’s cravat. “And then Uncle Harry gave me an extra bit of cake for being brave.”
“Thank you, Fitzy. Please remind Quelter that our guests will be arriving by floo this evening so that he is ready to take their things.”
“Ron’s parents’ home. It is not much, but outside of Hogwarts, it is the first place that felt like home.”
He turned to see Rubeus Hagrid coming toward them from the other side of the field. Draco looked at Potter and gave a small bow. “I shall let you make your rounds,” he said, turning tail before he was forced into an inane conversation with a creature-obsessed simpleton.
“Merlin!” Draco panicked, trying to right his broom but it refused to yield to him. No matter what he did, he accelerated closer and closer to the ground. Draco could not change its descent even by the smallest amount.
When the pair exited the room, Draco turned toward Potter. “I am having tea with Miss Lovegood tomorrow.”
Draco rarely fell ill, so of course his mother assumed he had imbibed too much the night before. Well, he would continue to let her think so. This new venture felt too intimate to share with anyone.
End: Oof, I would say I’m sorry, but your pain brings me the slightest bit of joy. O:-) I promise to make it all up to you in the next and final chapter. It may be a bit late as I’m still working on it. <3
Draco had had plans for their first time; he had wanted to wrap his mouth on Potter’s prick, to feel him come, salty and warm, on his tongue. But their ministrations were over before he could even get that far, their hard lengths sliding against each other and Potter pressing kisses to Draco’s open mouth.
He shook his head. “I do not. And with a reversal of the Black family disownment, we would be family again, and Teddy would be my closest living relative.”
“I know,” he said with an embarrassed smile. “I am sorry, mother.” Mrs. Malfoy did not like to speak of Death Eaters or the Dark Lord. He could not blame her, since he would be quite happy to forget that chapter of his life as well. However, his mother never took the mark. It was easier to forget when one was not forced to see the Dark Lord’s brand each and every day.
“Mrs. Figg?” he said, knocking again. This time, Draco heard a scuffle and footsteps toward the door. When it opened, Potter stood in front of him, his left shoulder covered in floo powder.
His mouth was warm, bitter with the taste of ale and salty from the sweat of their broom ride, but it was everything Draco wanted. Potter brought his arms around him, bringing him closer, and Draco melted into him eagerly, awash with arousal and belonging as they kissed one another. He wanted to lie Potter down in the grass and peel away his robes. He wanted to press kisses against his golden skin.  He wanted to hear Potter beg for him again and again. He wanted—
Well then. He did not know if Miss Astoria was attracted to women, but he figured it was worth an attempt. He grabbed Miss Lovegood by the wrist and brought her to where Miss Astoria was standing. Mrs. Malfoy was already there greeting her.
Draco spent the following week in a number of charity meetings with cheque book in hand. He had never given so many insincere smiles in his life, which, as a Slytherin and former Death Eater, certainly said something.
Azkaban had not been kind to his father’s mental state, and he had taken his own life the previous year. The sickness in his mind had made him forgetful, violent, and paranoid. At times, he no longer recognised his own wife, and he had attacked her during one of her last visits. She had been frightened to return and, when they received news of his passing, had warred with guilt that she had not had the chance to tell him goodbye.
He followed the same trail that they had that night, and so many nights afterward, and climbed the stairs to the landing. The bedroom door was closed, and when he opened it, he saw that a candle was lit on the side table.
“I may need a moment to get used to its handling,” Draco said, cursing himself at the quaver in his voice.
The library was lovely, though smaller than the Manor’s (the lack of dark texts might have attributed to that). The cream-colored walls were lined with leather-bound texts in a variety of subjects. Plush chaises and armchairs were scattered amongst the room, and there was a very large window seat piled high with cushions. Two desks sat opposite each other: one neatly piled with an assortment of academic texts and the other in disarray, with Quidditch periodicals, defense texts, a few scrolls, and unopened mail thrown haphazardly on its surface.
Then suddenly, Draco’s descent began to slow. He looked up and saw Potter’s hand stretched toward Draco’s broom, and as his hand moved lower, the broom followed until it slowly lowered Draco to the ground. Draco fell to his knees, tossing aside the broom and trying to catch his breath. As his heart pounded in his chest, he heard Potter land and run to his side. He was so shaken from the incident that he thought nothing of the fact that Potter had not used his wand.
Draco grimaced at the thought, but also felt a pang of guilt and… absence. Longing. It was often lonely to be a Malfoy. How many more people would be a part of Draco’s life if his family had not been so concerned with blood purity?
“For as long as you will have me,” he responded. Draco chanced a look at Potter and saw a sheepish, shy grin. Then Draco was hit with sudden bravery, a bravery with which he was not generally familiar, if he were honest. He reached out and dragged his knuckle very, very slowly along the back of Potter’s hand. He heard a sharp intake of breath at the touch and looked up to see Potter’s eyes closed, his thick lashes fanned against his brown skin. Seeing him like that, so open and vulnerable to Draco’s touch, brought back his Slytherin-patented sense of self-preservation, and he dropped his hand. He also took two steps back for good measure.
“Of course,” said Potter. “Mrs. Granger-Weasley and I felt that while there was a great deal of charity work for physical restoration — such as reconstruction of buildings and businesses that were damaged in the war — there was not much work for interpersonal restoration and unity. The Patronus Charity will work to support new muggle-born witches and wizards in their assimilation to our world; to provide education to wizards on muggles, muggle-borns, werewolves, centaurs, and other misunderstood magical beings; to work with the ministry to mend relationships with those marginalized groups; to support elves working toward liberation; and to assist Hogwarts in promoting inter-house unity. We also have plans to provide monetary assistance to magical peoples who are unable to support themselves due to prejudice or other hardships.”
“Very well,” she said when she finished. “Kreacher, please take notes.” The elf snapped his fingers and parchment and a pencil appeared in his hands. “Before you are drafts of the menu and guest lists. Please feel free to add any additions to the guest lists by this Friday. We will need to order and send invitations as soon as possible. You will also see finalist lists for bands, florists, decorators, and caterers.”
Potter laughed in response, but then his face sobered. “Malfoy.” He walked closer to him. “I read the
“Yes, Mama.” He smiled at an attempt to diffuse her suspicion, but she responded with one raised, pointed eyebrow and shut the door behind her. He took a deep breath. She knew something was going on, and he worried that tomorrow’s delivery of the
As the party came to a close, Draco sat on a bench near the garden. The sun was still in the sky, but it was nearing twilight.  It was quieter here and it allowed him to catch his breath from the day’s activities. At least, that had been his plan.
“That is true,” Draco said. “The local muggles here believe that the Lady of the Lake despised Merlin and cruelly entrapped him under the tomb.”
In reality, Draco was in no rush to marry any woman, let alone Daphne Greengrass or any of her menagerie of sisters. It was the last item on his list for a purpose, and he had every plan to put it off as long as possible.
“I think that many purebloods would be very angry if this came out, and it might cause trouble for you and your professor. It would shake the very foundation of wizarding society.”
“Very well, thank you,” replied his mother. “Especially now that Draco has returned from university.” She and Draco were seated diagonally from one another at the dining table; Mrs. Malfoy was next to Mrs. Greengrass and Draco was crammed between Miss Greengrass and Miss Astoria. The family could not have been more obvious in their desire to make a match.
He led her to the drawing room, where she poured them both a cup of tea. They were side-by-side on the chaise, and she handed him a cup before taking one for herself. “I added valerian root to help you sleep,” she said. He nodded his thanks and took a sip. “Noxberries would have been better, but they are hard to come by in this part of the world.” They drank in silence for a few minutes. “Do you want to talk about it?”
“Would someone like to explain how a toy I know I personally gave one of the children staying overnight made it into this trash can?” He asked gabbing his wand in the direction of the trash can. He grabbed the plush toy and cleaned it gently with a spell. “No, looks like I’m adding that to my report as well.” He grabbed the stuffed dragon and his report and made his way back to room 505.
The Welcome Witch smiled politely she loved it when people tried to be pleasant towards her. A silvery owl sprung from her wand and went flying off in whatever direction Bellatrix was. Andromeda and Vivienne could have easily did it themselves, but it was less polite then letting the Welcome Witch alert Bellatrix that they were here.
Harry just shook his head in shame as he flopped ungracefully into his seat. He saw the report from St. Mungo’s over his injuries laying on his desk he flipped though it knowing Theseus got the same report. He was glad that it was devoid of Malfoy’s name, that was the last thing he needed to explain today.
Regulus levitated his notes over to his desk and looked at the tired healer. “I have an appointment in ten minutes, and I would like to get my mind composed and read up on our last session. So, I’m kicking you out. If you feel Harry needs me for any reason come get me, alright?” Regulus instructed getting up from his wingback chair and going to his desk to find his notes.
As much as Harry would have loved to give up being an Auror and teach Defense he just couldn’t go back to Hogwarts. He hadn’t been there since the battle, a place he once considered a home was now the biggest part of his nightmares. “I know I just really like being an Auror.” He lied he hated being an Auror, but it’s not like he had a choice in the matter, Kingsley practically dragged him to sign up for training after the battle. He wanted nothing more than a safe job where he didn’t have to worry if today was the day his luck had finally ran out.
Bellatrix came back five minutes later with Andromeda and Vivienne in tow. “Vivienne, you remember Healer Kieran Reid and Mind Healer Regulus Black-Snape.” She said politely the four of them had worked a few child abuse cases together, but none of those were as bad as poor Harry.
“The fact that you saw his abs pretty much confirms that you were his Healer.” Narcissa raised her wine glass to her lips and took a small sip watching her son. “That’s a very Slytherin tactic, so what’d he have to say to your invitation for drinks?” She questioned.
“Actually, they aren’t. Which you wouldn’t know that a patient you oversaw is now being tended to by two off duty St. Mungo’s employees.” He said bitterly to Umbridge before turning his attention to the other Medistaff also sitting around.
“You too sweetie.” Bellatrix said grabbing another blanket from the warmer. “In case you get cold during the night.” She placed the blanket at the bottom of the bed; but still in arms reach of the child. She knew St. Mungo’s could get drafty during the night.
Draco wondered just how much had changed in the seven years he was in America; he still couldn’t believe that Neville and Hermione were a couple. He grabbed his wand from his wand pocket and gently cradled Harry’s hand in his own as he ran his wand down Harry’s broken wrist. “Doing alright?” Draco asked seeing the pained expression in Harry’s green eyes. Merlin, could he easily get lost in those eyes.
“This wasn’t the first break to your wrist, was it?” Kieran asked his blue eyes meeting Harry’s scared green ones. “If there is something going on with your home life, we can help you.”
“Have fun at Alton Towers.” Draco muttered paying the bartender and leaving her a nice tip. He followed the Auror up the stairs leading to the restroom in the restaurant. “I had a great time tonight and come hungry I make great pasta.” He said with a wink holding the yellow door open for Harry.
“Use the excuse Kieran is one of the few Senior Level Healers around and that is why his request is denied. Although the idea of her husband giving the Headmaster some muggle stitches amused her greatly. Hell, you can probably ask the Welcome Witch to cast a simple Episkey at Dumbledore.” She teased softly walking away from the station the wheelchair following her.
Ron grumbled setting down his quill looking at Harry. “I think I’d rather be cleaning Snape’s cauldron’s, or cleaning up after Buckbeak, no wait cleaning the Slytherin dungeons with my toothbrush.” He absolutely hated Auror reports, he liked catching the baddies, but he did not like the paperwork.
“While are you doing that can you bring back a Draught of Peace potion and another pain potion for later?” Kieran suggested knowing the Draught of Peace would make the idea of the scan easier for the child it would also help sooth some of the obvious anxiety rolling of the child.
“That works.” Harry said entering the date into his phone. “I’ll see you Wednesday, enjoy your day off tomorrow.”
“I do. Knowing the full extent of your case will make it easier for me to testify and get you justice for those that hurt you. I swear on Hekate herself. Would you like me to contact my husband, Severus, to sit with you? He remembers you and I’m sure he’d be happy to see and sit with you while I coordinate with the rest of your care team. I understand if you don’t and just want to be alone too.”
Harry sighed knowing that the Healer was getting an up-close view of everything his was grateful that he wasn’t being questioned. “Thank you for your help.”
“Vernon and Petunia told me that my parents were drunks that hated me!” Harry exclaimed and then quickly tossed his right hand over his mouth to keep himself from speaking further. He realized he might have told Regulus something that he shouldn’t.
Draco stood up and adjusted the awful lime green colored healer robes and tucked the small file under his arm as he made his way down the corridor he was reminded of his small crush on The Savior. He wanted to kick himself for those thoughts, there was no way in hell was Harry Potter gay, or would he ever go for Draco Malfoy, Death Eater. He sighed and knocked lightly at the door.
“I expect better, now I want a detailed report from all of you about the failed raid, also you have all been temporally suspended from the field until I conduct my investigation into this raid. I would also like a copy of the memories of the failed raid. Now get out of my office.” He roared taking down the spell on his door watching the three adults slink out of his office like kicked puppies.
“I’m Harry.” Harry said meekly from his spot on the floor. He grabbed his glasses; it wasn’t like he could see that great with them. They were something Petunia had picked up from a rummage sale after one of his primary school teachers had told Petunia that he had a hard time seeing the blackboard.
“I thought you’d like to know that Albus Dumbledore just signed in at the Welcome Witch, he has apparently cut himself and needs healing. If you want my opinion that cut is so basic he could take care of it himself. I didn’t know if you wanted to move the kid, I get the feeling Dumbledore’s sudden healing need coincides with the meeting you and Healer Reid had with him. I didn’t want you to not know and have Dumbledore trying to sniff around the room. Can I help you with anything?”
“Since you offered; why don’t you bring it up to the fifth floor in say 30 minutes?” Kieran said walking towards the elevator. He figured the kiddo would appreciate more ice cream. After all the kid did need to eat and there was nothing wrong with bribing him with fatter foods to get him to eat and try putting some weight onto his brittle bones.
Grant poked his head into the room knowing that Kieran and Bellatrix were not going to enjoy what he needed to tell them. “Do one of you have a moment?” He asked politely.
Kieran sighed and got up from the couch looking at his watch wondering how much longer before Harry would want dinner and before he could go find an on-call room and promptly pass out. He would need to go talk to the Neuro Healers to figure out the best way of fixing the brain aneurysm. “Wait, I don’t suppose you know what Neuro Healer I should speak to regarding the BA?”
“Well, none other than Ginevra Weasley. It is almost poetic that Lady Magic would choose a redhead for Harry seeing as his mother was also a redhead.” Dumbledore laughed softly at the irony. “I’m sure if he was abused by the Dursley’s that Molly would love Harry like one of her own.”
They had done it to not draw attention to their neighbors since they did live in a rather muggle section of Croydon. For all their neighbors knew they were rich and successful and had added on an indoor pool. He turned on the hot tub letting it get warm and for it to start bubbling like an angry cauldron in potions class. While the hot tub was heating up, he changed out of his scrubs and into a pair of black swim trunks.
Harry smiled as he kissed him, reaching up to pull him closer for just a moment. Even when he pulled back, they still stayed close. Harry could spot the faint row of freckles again from where he was, and the flush of Draco’s cheeks. He could stare at him all day, really. Draco was the first one to pull away, adjusting his collar and huffing.
“Let me check it. I have to make sure you didn’t screw it up, Potter,” Draco said and took out the spoon, glancing at the clear sparkly liquid with a yellow tint.
Harry had pulled away slightly so he could watch. The other’s back would arch slightly every time he’d brush his tip. It was also very clear to Harry that Draco was trying to hide his moans. Little gasps escaped his lips along with the occasional moan. Draco would then cover his mouth and hide his face as he trembled.
Harry was left speechless. Why was Malfoy so infuriated about the kiss? It had surprised Harry too, but Malfoy’s reaction was clearly disproportionate.
It was quiet for a moment before Harry slammed something else. While Draco ignored it, Blaise looked up.
“W-what?” the other huffed. His eyes darted to meet his for a moment before blinking away, jolting as Harry’s fingers moved.
“Oh Harry, do you not have a seat, my boy? There’s one right here next to Mr. Malfoy,” Professor Slughorn said cheerfully. Harry didn’t need to look to know Malfoy was glaring at him.
“Well I’m sorry, you’re the one that failed to mention that you’re terrified of spiders. If you had just told me in the first place then I could have handled the webs and neither of us would have had to deal with this nonsense,” Harry said as he took off his shoes.
So a year later I am finally finishing this fic. Who would have guessed all it took was a global pandemic? Also, this chapter is pretty long in comparison, so enjoy~
This year, McGonagall decided that the seventh years could choose their own dorm mates, but only in pairs, seeing as the number of seventh years had dwindled.
“I'm teasing him,” Draco said before Blaise could ask, keeping his eyes on the board, moving his pawn.
Draco only shrugged. He didn’t acknowledge it, but the two were getting along. Borderline flirting every time they saw each other in the halls. He was honestly surprised the students hadn't figured out who Draco kissed yet based on all the flirting Harry did. It was, truthfully, very obvious.
Hermione sat there, trying to take all of this information in. She let out a small laugh, smiling at Harry.
“Why does somebody have a crush?” Harry teased he certainly had a crush, a crush on Draco Malfoy. Shite he had almost forgotten about his plans with Draco later tonight, it might have only been drinks as a thank you for saving his arse, but for some reason Harry was looking forward to it. What was wrong with him it was only drinks it wasn’t like they were going to a fancy five-star restaurant. It would be just like getting drinks with Ron and Neville after work, but instead of them it was a hot blonde healer. His mind reminded him.
“He was my healer, as much I hate to admit it he does make a great healer.” He grumbled sipping the sweet liquid trying to not let today’s failure get to him, usually if he failed during a raid the failure ate at him and caused even more sleeping problems than what he already had.
Harry sent a glace to Ron and Neville. “Well sir, it almost seemed like Yaxley was onto us from the start. Ron was the first one in the door and Neville and I followed, only to find out Yaxley was ready for us and already had Ron magically tied to a chair. I got hit with a Cruciatus and several blasters before we figured out a plan and we got the hell out of there and I apparated over to St. Mungo’s.” Harry said speaking for the three of them.
Kieran and Bellatrix didn’t miss what he had said and they both raised an eyebrow at each other. They both knew from his wordage that this was not a fresh break like they assumed that it could have been a few days old. The decided to ignore his little slip up figuring he’d tell them more when he was ready.
“Then we’ll dose them both with a 24-hour height potion.” Ron smirked. “So, what do you think my mates? It’ll be fun the three of us plus Fred, George, Victorie, and Teddy.
“Shit is going to go down if Andromeda looped Vivienne into the case of Harry.” Regulus joked. He had worked with Vivienne several times before and the Scottish wife of Thomas Riddle terrified him. They might have both been Slytherin’s, but the way Vivienne held herself was enough to make any grown man quiver in fear. She was ruthless when it came to child abuse cases and knew she was just the women to help Harry. He personally thought she would have a made a fantastic barrister.
“No, I do not think you are crazy in any sense of the word. Besides most behavioral and mental health conditions are nothing to be ashamed of. I’m just giving you someone to reach out to. I’ll have them come talk to you and the decision for help is entirely up to you. The word crazy doesn’t exist in my vocabulary and it shouldn’t exist in yours either.” Kieran said softly but sternly he didn’t particularly like the word crazy or any of the other words associated with mental and behavior health. “One meeting that is all I ask.”
“My plan is to contact a neurological healer for help regarding his brain aneurysm since that is out of my comfort zone. We hope that Harry will have weekly or twice weekly sessions with Mr. Black-Snape regarding the anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I’m going to keep Mr. Potter under the comfort of potions today, make sure he eats a proper dinner and then tomorrow I’m going to sedate him and repair everything listed on the parchment.”
