"Harry," Ron squawked indignantly.  "We can't just let them win."
HDHDHDHDHD
“Well, erm, I don’t know about that.”
Malfoy chirruped at his dogs as he led them down a staircase.  They had made their way back through the Queen’s chambers and towards the back of the castle.  Portraits shuffled on the walls and everything was gold-edged and gleaming.  Down the stairs and along a hall, past doors to the right and windows to the left, then Malfoy stopped at one of the doors.
"No legal proceedings were brought against Malfoy, none were deemed necessary."
Goyle looked at them seriously.  "We'd appreciate that."
Draco lit up.  “You have Bors and Ajax!”  He surged forwards at Harry’s nod.  Harry thought for a moment that Draco might hug him, but Draco stopped short, eyes wide.
“And the rest of Slytherin?”
“Today you will be duelling.  I expect all of you to treat this with the seriousness it merits, no carelessness or stupidity will be tolerated.”  He treated every student to a piercing look before continuing.  “In a moment I will be assigning partners, but first, a demonstration.  Mr Malfoy, Mr Zabini, if you would.”  Malfoy and Zabini stood and walked around their desks to the open space at the front of the room.  “These two have already had some years of duelling training, they are not in need of the same basic instruction that I am trying to bestow upon the rest of you.  Instead, they are going to demonstrate some of the skills necessary in duelling.”  He turned his hard stare on the two students.  “Or attempt to demonstrate.”
“I enjoy it.”
The portkey relocated them from Harry’s stables to the King’s, and Harry made the now familiar trek along the colonnade and through the enchanted door into the palace.  In the Gallery of Illustrious Men they were greeted by an agitated Condé.
Harry half wondered if they were speaking in some sort of code.
“Or,” Hermione smirked mischievously, “you could ask Malfoy.”
“Perfect.”  Condé turned back to Malfoy.  “Now, I have a message for you, Draco.  The King is waiting to receive you in the Salon of Hercules.”  The statue leant forward conspiratorially.  “I think His Majesty has missed you.”
Draco’s legs slipped to the floor, but he was still trapped by Harry between his legs. “You’re gonna have to move if you want us to make it to the bedroom.”
Harry looked over at Draco, who had kept silent so far.  He was watching the argument with wide, silver eyes.  Greg reached over and put a comforting arm around him.  Harry remembered that night on the Astronomy Tower.  At the time he had blamed Draco, but after much thought he had come to believe that most people would have done the same thing if their loved ones had been threatened.  Even then, knowing the consequences, Draco hadn't been able to murder Dumbledore.
"I can't wait until we bond." He said as he released Draco's wrists.  "We don't have to wait the whole two weeks, right?"
"What about Draco?"
He got up and made his way over to the door, arriving just as Ron threw it open.
Greg grinned.  "Yeah, maybe don't tell him I called him that.  He pretends not to like it."
"So this explains why Malfoy's been all weird?"
"May I, Master?"
“Of course,” Harry laughed a little, “they’re yours, Draco.  They’ve been missing you,” he pushed a little, “pining, I think.”
“How many languages do you speak?”  Harry asked him when he saw Malfoy at their next meeting.
"Master, Harry, I don't know how..."
The end finally came on a rainy afternoon in May.  The Order’s raids on the Death Eaters had been increasing in their frequency and ferocity, and Harry had put every available resource into pumping the Death Eaters they captured for any information about Voldemort or Draco.  The former had been much more plentiful than the latter, and Harry had found all he needed to know to destroy a large part of Voldemort’s troops and draw him out into the open.  As it transpired, the Death Eaters were far less efficient than the Order at gathering information, because they had a marked preference for killing rather than taking prisoners, and so they never had the level of intelligence the Order did.  Harry’s decision was made when they captured Rudolphus LeStrange, who told them, under interrogation, that he had been involved in the original plan to kidnap Draco, but Draco had disappeared months ago.  Harry knew then that Draco was either dead or not in Death Eater hands, and there was no point delaying their final action against the Dark Lord.
"They're beautiful, Master."
"Yeah, and how is she meant to have been so sure about all this?"
The friar stepped back.  “I don’t know if I can share such details with you.  This can be a place of sanctuary for some.”
"Then you are bonded in the eyes of the Goddess, may She bless your bond."
“There’s one too few beds,” Neville said with a frown.
Draco choked on air, then managed to whimper "Yes, Master."
"Harry-"
When Greg, Vince, Blaise, Pansy and Theo arrived back on Sunday night, they were immediately regaled with tales of Draco punching Ron.  The story was met with a mixture of amusement and concern, but mainly amusement after it was ascertained that no harm had befallen anyone but Ron, and he had deserved it anyway.
“Where are you off to, Draco?”  The Queen asked.
Malfoy did it again with only slightly dramatic consequences.  “I know.  It’s one of the reasons I’m not playing quidditch this year, I’m falling apart.”
Harry lay in bed contemplating how he should ask Draco if he wanted Harry to court him.  Should he go in guns blazing and be sexy and enticing as he knew he could.  Or should he be conservative and reserved.  Harry sighed.  He was being stupid, he knew what Draco needed.  He needed him dominant, calm and caring.  Draco was a Submissive, he needed a master.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, young sir.”  The statue addressed Harry.  “Your arrival is greatly anticipated.”
"I know, but I don't mind.  Unless you mind, of course, Harry."
Harry swallowed, wondering if he would ever get used to that.  "So, do you have homework to do or something?"
"Oh, Goddess, Master."
"You need to make him feel secure."
As the car parked up outside the doors, Harry felt his stomach drop.  Goyle was driving, Crabbe riding shotgun.  It seemed the Fyndfire hadn’t killed him after all.  He had stumbled out of the burnt out room of requirement hours later and straight into Goyle’s arms.  But it wasn’t those two who were worrying him.  Malfoy was sprawled languidly across the back seat, a cigarette held loosely between his fingers.
“There are six sons of Björn: the two of us, Gunnar, Grettir, Ragnar and Erik.  We were chosen over our brothers because our skills were deemed most useful.  But when the time comes we will all fight.”  Flosi’s eyes gleamed dangerously.
"Seal the deal with a kiss?" It was how courting was commenced.
"Harry." Draco's teeth gritted in discomfort.
“Thank you for what, sir?” Draco gently tried to right him, but he was a dead weight.
"And I should talk to him before I ask Draco?"
HDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHD
"Please," whispered Draco desperately.
"I'm sure it won’t be, but hopefully I'll be able to get some leverage with my name, however unsavoury the prospect is."
“Yes,” Draco agreed, “hopefully.  That’s why I'm here, actually.  He wants to see you now, Harry.”
“Who cares?”  Hissed Snape.  “They sent us his finger.”
Ron turned to her.  "How is it a joke?" He sneered.
“Because from the way you responded to it I don’t have to worry about making you uncomfortable anymore.”
Whatever response the King was going to make was cut off by a flash of light in the centre of the table.  They all jumped back, startled.
"I thought you must be related, no one can smirk quite like a Malfoy."
Well, that explained it.  Harry felt anger curl in his gut.  How was it fair that Malfoy got to sit drinking tea in his godfather’s office while Harry had barely had time to know Sirius?  Harry clenched his fists in his lap.  When he looked up, Malfoy was regarding him with his most expressionless gaze.
"One thousand eight-hundred Galleons." Harry grimaced and paid up.
"And how do these memories imply the defendant's innocence, Minister."
Theo, Greg and Draco, who were lying on Draco's bed, looked up in surprise.  Harry thanked Merlin that Blaise wasn't there, he was the most confrontational of the Slytherins.
“I see.”
They were interrupted, as they always were, by Snape’s entrance.  “You weren’t at dinner.”  He said by way of greeting.
“Right,” Harry’s voice betrayed his uncertainty.
“I might have mentioned it, yeah.”
“See, it sounds like the two of you had a perfectly civil conversation.”  Harry felt Hermione’s pointed gaze on him.
How did Draco look now, he wondered.  Was he still worn and worried, drained beyond his years?  Did he look worse now, after his time with the Death Eaters?  Or had he, by some miracle, made it out alright and found some peace and happiness in this house of God?  If there was anywhere Draco could find healing, it would be here, in this cold, beautiful place of prayer.  The informant who’d alerted the King to Draco’s whereabouts hadn’t said anything about Draco’s state of mind, whether he was traumatised by his captivity.  Harry didn’t know how long he’d been held before he’d escaped.  He didn’t even know if he had escaped, or if he’d been let go, or just forgotten somewhere after it became clear he was no use as a hostage.  Not every Death Eater had been sadist after all, plenty were genocidal blood supremacists without wanting to actively get their hands dirty.  There was a chance Draco had come out of his ordeal relatively unscathed.  Apart from the severed finger.  And the kidnapping, of course.
"And if we loose our souls somewhere between the torturing and the killing, it'll be fine." Lucius added.  "They can be casualties of war."
Malfoy returned her smile, and Harry could see the warmth there, even though he was too buttoned up to demonstrate it further.  “You have my gratitude, Your Majesty.”
"Yes, Master.  Thank you, Master."
Harry pushed into him fully without warning, finding his prostate on the first try.  Draco screamed into the pillow and bucked as much as he could with his hands tied in front of him and legs stretched behind.  Harry pulled out as quickly as he'd sunk in, starting a punishing rhythm.  Draco was moaning continuously, back arching and wrists tugging against the restraints.  A litany of pleas fell continuously from his lips.
“I won’t hunt tomorrow, my heart is broken.”  Montespan lamented.
“I thought they might have been killed by the people who took me.”
"What?  You just got chatting?"
As Draco turned to the desk, Harry left him and went to the common room.  Greg and Vince were there and looked at him expectantly when he entered.
"I'm not sure, sir.  Severus says that she didn't seem surprised when he told her what he heard.  Daddy says he thinks she had premonitions, that perhaps she already knew."
He took Crabbe’s free hand and the three of them sauntered over to where Zabini, Parkinson and Nott stood.  Their greetings were subdued.  They just exchanged quick kisses and nods.  Then McGonagall called them all together.
She thought for long minutes.  "Go to Voldemort, tell him what you heard."
“Nope.” That was definitely Ron. Harry loved it when Ron came to visit, it got Draco fluffed up like an angry cat.
"We're going to the Potter Manor, Draco."
"I invited you here, Mr Potter, because I wanted to apologise."
Snape shook his head.  “The wards are under attack, but I don’t understand, they could never hope to get through.  The wards here are stronger than those at Hogwarts.”
Draco stood.  “Good.  I’m going on the hunt today, the boys love to stretch their legs.”  On cue Bors and Ajax loped to the door.  “Alexandre will keep you company, perhaps show you the grounds once you’ve finished breakfast.  Stay with him until you’re summoned by the King.”  With that he left, leaving Harry to ponder the not particularly enticing prospect of a morning spent with the Chevalier de Montespan.
“You’re gonna come on my cock, baby. I’m gonna make you come.”
There was silence in the room for many moments as they all took in the horror of the situation.  Draco gone, taken by what could only be Death Eaters, and no way to find him without acceding to Voldemort’s demands.  Bors and Ajax put their bloody muzzles on Malfoy’s empty bed, and snuffled dolefully at the mussed sheets.  Then Ajax set up a whining, crying howl, and Bors joined him until Snape called them both to heel, and told them I know, but quiet now, that’s enough like they were people, and cleaned their muzzles with a spell.
Malfoy released the spell and helped Zabini to his feet.  Zabini winced as he touched the back of his head where he had fallen.  Malfoy brushed his hand aside and checked for damage himself.  There didn’t seem to be any blood, and Zabini muttered an ‘I’m fine’ to Malfoy, but Malfoy sent a wash of healing green light over the area.  Zabini rolled his eyes and nudged Malfoy’s shoulder affectionately with his own.
Zabini once again ignored her.  Malfoy answered instead.  “We put them up in the manor the summer before last.  All in one enchantments used to be very popular, but the conventional wisdom now is to have several separate enchantments that can be individually adjusted and won’t all fail at the same time.”  He was running the beads through his hands as he spoke, and they clicked anxiously.
“Oh, so where have you come from?  The chapel?”
"It's about Draco, sir."
Greg held up his hands in a gesture of peace.  "We never wanted anyone to get hurt, sometimes that's just the way things work out though."
Harry didn't think he would be if he understood the circumstances.  "It's okay, Dove, I'll explain what happened, I'm sure he'll understand."
Harry sat in Transfigurations two days later.  They were learning how to transfigure an object into a humanoid.  It was impossible to create a person with magic, but you could make a sort of robot/human thing.  It was just theory and Harry was bored by the third sentence the new professor, Leo Layley, had spoken.  Not that he was a boring teacher, he was better than McGonagall, but Transfiguration theory wasn't really Harry's thing.
"If you choose to court him everyone will know what he is, they will taunt him and degrade him in any way they can.  Is that really what you want?"
Draco didn’t answer, he simply stood at the window, glaring into the grounds.
“The magical community are notoriously conservative.  Even in England we don’t have anything approaching a democracy.  The Wizengamot choose the Minister of Magic from among their own ranks, there’s no public vote.  In France they’re even more traditionalist, I think the King rules more or less as an absolute monarch.”  At Harry’s confused express she elaborated, “That means the king decides everything.”
"Surprised?  Never."
Condé stepped aside with a flourish and let Harry and Malfoy through.
"A necklace or bangles or whatever.  But not a collar until you've claimed him." Harry had never considered putting a collar on someone before, but it did sound kind of hot.
“That’s Draco’s signet ring.”  Snape said.
"Can you fucking turn that down?" Ron yelled.
“They like you.”  Malfoy observed as Bors presented Harry with an ear to scratch behind.  Harry found himself relieved at that.  “That’s enough of that, come on.”  Harry wasn’t sure whether the instruction was directed at him or the dogs.  Malfoy started walking.  “Leave the trunk, Potter, it’ll be taken to your rooms.”
Draco gave his one-shouldered shrug.  “You’ve already won over the Queen, with her on your side it hopefully it won’t be too hard to convince the King.”
“Language, Mr Zabini.”  Snape cautioned.  “You may as well let him up, Draco.”
Pansy stood and smoothed her pencil skirt before picking up a sheaf of parchments. She shuffled the papers straight before handing them to Mr Potter.
"He has white-blonde hair, pale skin and grey eyes."
It was a finger.  A human finger, the fourth, Harry guessed, and at its base was a ring.
Finally everyone was assembled at the fireplace.  The trunks were piled behind them, ready to be flooed as well.  The six children were lined up ready to leave: Morgana and Nox who were seventeen; Circe who was fifteen; Lilith who was fourteen and Mercury and Salem who were eleven.  Three boys and three girls, the perfect balance, even if Harry and Draco were a bit outnumbered, not to mention outwitted.  The children each flooed to Platform Nine and Three Quarters in turn.  Draco took a handful of Floo powder, but Harry caught his hand before he could throw it in the fire.
“Finally you're here.”  Louis exclaimed.  Harry opened his mouth to give a platitude, but Louis sailed onwards.  “We’ve had news of great import.  A man who is known to the Court and well trusted came to us this morning with an astonishing claim.”  Harry cursed Louis’ theatrical tendencies internally.  “He said that he had seen our brother with his own eyes.”
She sucked her teeth.  “Is it some sort of political gathering?”
"Look," Greg spoke reasonably, "we don't want to fight.  We were all tried and found innocent.  Most of us took the Dark Mark before we were of age and all of us took it under duress.  Dove was only fourteen, for the Goddess' sake." This was news to Harry, he thought Draco had taken it before sixth year, but it sounded like it had been done after fourth year.
Malfoy tipped his head back against the armchair.  “It’s going to be exhausting.”
“I’m coming,” Snape informed Draco.  “I have yet to see his Majesty.”
"I have something that would make it even more obvious, sir.  It's a bonding gift from Pansy.  I thought she was being a little presumptuous at the time, but you can see if you like it." He reached into his dresser and pulled out a little velvet bag, emptying the contents into his hand.
Crabbe also surveyed the room.  "Vince,"
Malfoy scowled.  “When, then?  I’m quite busy, if you hadn’t noticed.”
“Why would he want us to have lunch with him?”  Neville wondered.
SLSLSLSLSLSLSLSL
“That’s the portkey?”  Harry asked.  It didn’t look like any he’d ever used; they were usually random objects.
"Do you accept this oath, Harry?" Pansy asked.
“Really Ron,” Hermione sniffed, “if that were true then they would be there.  They've been proved innocent.”  Things had been chilly between those two since they had broken up and Harry was sick of mediating.
Vince laughed.  "It's cause you're so pure, Dove."
"That's enough, Ron." Harry advised.  "I think you should go to the hospital wing, that nose looks broken." Ron snarled at Draco but allowed himself to be directed to the door.
He took the proffered glass and allowed himself to relax as Daphne guided him through the necessary small talk with rich purebloods. He had to admit that while he didn’t enjoy the publicity generated by bringing a date to a social event, Daphne was invaluable to him at times when it was important for him to make a good impression, and Draco couldn’t be there to guide him. He’d have preferred Draco to be there, of course, but it would have seemed odd to have his PA as his plus one to an event like this.
“They’re safely in the Great Hall with the other students, both are quite concerned for your safety.”
“What…” Harry tried to marshal his confusion into a question.  “Since when was there a King of France?”
“His brother is King Louis France.  Draco Malfoy is the Duc d’Orleans.”  The friar looked stunned.  Harry leant in.  “As you might imagine, His Majesty is extremely concerned with the Duc’s safety.  If Draco is here, you need to bring him to me.”  Harry didn’t mean to be menacing, but he could feel the dark tension within himself.  He needed to know if Draco was here, to see him with his own eyes and see if he was safe and well.
"Yes, Master." Draco's eyes remained lowered.
“I’ve never been to a palace before.”  Harry admitted.
The spoke for a little longer about the plan to free Lucius, then moved on to more personal matters.
Harry wanted to so much, but he knew he'd hurt Draco if he did it now.  Instead he pushed in another finger.  Draco gasped and thrust his hips as Harry massaged his prostate.  His back arched, long hair spread around him.
Greg gave him another of his crooked smiles.  "You like him, don't you?"
“Some in the French court claim that the name Jean-Luc was chosen to honour the King’s stepfather, Lucius Malfoy.  This continues the controversy over His Majesty’s close relationship to his stepfather that began when he ascended to the throne in 1993, at the age of nineteen, and requested that the Wizengamot return the Earldom of Wiltshire to his stepfather.  Readers will remember that the Wizengamot stripped Lord Malfoy’s title from him in 1979 for adultery, which was at the time still a crime under wizarding law, when he seduced Narcissa Black, the then Dauphine, away from King Louis’s father, the late Charles XV of France, then Dauphin.  As adultery has been legal since 1990, His Majesty’s petition was granted by the Wizengamot in spite of opposition from the Chief Warlock Albus Dumbledore.  His Majesty also revived the title of Duc d’Orleans, which he bestowed on his half brother Draco Malfoy in 1994.”
“Well we better get there, then.”
"Yes, sir." Draco murmured even more quietly.
“Perhaps,” Malfoy conceded, “if they want.  But they both have other options.  Greg’s great with animals, so he’ll probably take a place on the palace hunt at Versailles.  Vince is a talented cellist, there would also be a place at Versailles for him if he chose, but he could play for any orchestra he chose.”
“Really?”  Harry was shocked.
“You don’t have to stay,” he told his bodyguards, “there’s no sense in you wasting your evening too.  Professor Snape is supervising detention in the classroom next door.”
Draco nodded obediently.  Harry was struck by Draco's lithe body as he stood up.  Then his grey eyes caught Harry's for a moment before he turned away.  Harry felt like he might just fall into that soft grey.  He shook himself, he probably wasn't supposed to be thinking like that.
"Forbidden Forest?”
"Thank you, Harry."
Claude disappeared with Esther into the stables and Harry turned to his visitor.
“You grew up with Zabini?”  Harry was always interested in hearing about Malfoy’s childhood.
"Hermione, are you suggesting I break a Ministry order?"
Harry laughed.  "And you've just been waiting for me to wise up, right?"
Madam Bones sighed at the poor effort.  "Are there anymore witnesses to be called."
"And how am I going to explain to my friends that he'll be hanging around with us?"
“Even if they have someone to get them inside.”  Snape agreed.
“Then I don’t understand the problem,” Harry replied.  “War will come to him whether he looks for it or not.  If we explain that to him, surely he’ll see that it’s better to fight on his terms rather than Voldemort’s.”
Malfoy flinched a little at Voldemort’s name, but then his face contorted in anger.  “How dare you,” he hissed, “imply that the King would involve himself with the machinations of a common criminal masquerading as a lord.”
"Restrained?  What... You mean they'd hit you?"
“Monsieur and the Chevalier, history repeats itself.”  Lady Charlotte crowed.
The door opened and Ron entered, followed closely by Draco. “Will that be all, sir?” He looked exactly as Harry had envisaged, flustered and fluffy while trying to appear detached.
"Excellent.  Now that we've established that common knowledge cannot always hold the whole truth, what measures were taken to ensure the whole truth was discovered, Auror?"
"No need to thank me, Lucius is family.  And so are you now, I suppose." He held out his hand and Harry grasped it.
"We haven't apologised for the shit we did to them, either.  We've all just tried to put the past behind us.  Clearly, you can't."
“The Duc d’Oleans,” she said, as though it were obvious, “everyone calls him that because he has those big eyes, you know, like a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.”
We would be pleased if you would join us for Yule at our palace of Versailles.  We look forward with pleasure to meeting you and we are confident you will find your stay most comfortable.  You may make all necessary arrangements through our brother, with whom we have entrusted this letter.
“Merci, Claude.”
“Oh,” was all Harry could say.
"This is weird, I thought Malfoy told them what to do."
The King banged a fist on the table.  “And why would one of our own court turn against us?  Never could I have conceived of such a betrayal.”
“Some words, probably more than I’ve taught them.  But I think he was just responding to my tone.”
“This is my favourite view in the palace.”  Malfoy noted.
“The King simply doesn’t want to risk more lives on a foolish undertaking.”  Malfoy snapped.
Harry picked Draco up gently and laid him on the king sized bed which had replaced their separate ones.  Draco eagerly spread his legs, bending his knees.  Harry knelt between them and slipped his fingers between Draco's cheeks, stroking his tightly closed hole.  Draco moaned.  Harry raised a hand to Draco's lips and encouraged him to suck two fingers.  He did so and Harry brought them back down to play gently.  Draco's breath was coming in quick gasps now, and his face showed a little discomfort as Harry slipped a finger into him.  Harry kissed him gently and loosened him enough to slip in another finger.
Snape strode over to Malfoy.  “You’re alright?”
“Most agreeable, thank you, Sire.”  A man, presumably Blouin, detached himself from group and lead Harry out of the room.
Flosi grabbed Harry’s arm.  “We need to go.”
She looked up from her desk, perfectly plucked eyebrow raised. “Good afternoon, Mr Weasley.”
“How soon were you and Greg planning to elope?”
"No further questions, ma'am."
“Wait, weren’t they cousins?”  Harry studied the family tree before him.
“I was wondering if we could change the day, I have a meeting I can’t change.”  The Order was meeting to discuss the latest information brought in by their spies.
“I should still go and make sure there’re no cracks.”  Skarpheðinn left the way they had come, passing Snape in the doorway to the great Hall.
“Was he really going to crucio you in Defence?  Or turn you into a werewolf?”
“Nothing.”  Malfoy muttered.
"I know my place, sir." Draco was still studying the floor.
"I don't mind, I'll correct him when he needs it."
They finished looking at the rose gardens, lake and quidditch pitch, then went back to the entrance hall.  Draco gave the hall one last, awed look before flooing back to Hogwarts.
Snape stared at the King.  “Do you intend to abandon him, your Majesty?”
The King looked pale, shaken.  He met Harry’s gaze across the table.  “We go to war.”
Severus tucked a strand of blond hair behind Luc's ear.  "Don't worry, I won't let that happen to you.  I won't let anything happen to you." Vampires were extremely protective of their mates.
"He's Draco's Godfather, with Lucius not here he's the person to talk to."
Montespan looked a little disgruntled.  “You won’t walk with us, sir?”
“Er, I suppose.”  Harry replied uncertainly.
“We have heard much about you.”  The taller one said.  He had a trace of an accent, but it was unidentifiable.  He held his hand out and Harry shook hands with him, and then his brother.
“Blaise isn’t much for duelling, really.  He’s had the same training as me, of course, but he much prefers longer and more intricate spell casting, like the kind my cousins practice.  In particular, my cousin Grettir specialises in ancient rituals.  He and Blaise have often worked on them together.  That’s what he’s good at.”
"I'll never get angry with you for being yourself, Dove."
Mr Potter laid a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Draco, look at me.” Draco complied. “I’m not sorry I kissed you.”
As Harry held Draco gently in his arms, he reflected that he'd never really planned out his life.  He'd had vague expectations: that he'd join the Aurors, that he'd live with Ron until Ron and Hermione got married, maybe even that he'd marry Ginny.  He'd never planned though, he hadn't thought about how many kids he'd like or where he wanted to live, he hadn't even officially applied to the Aurors.  Now he could see himself living at Potter Manor with Draco and four, or maybe five, kids. While human men couldn't get pregnant, all magical submissive were 'receptive to their Master's seed' as Draco had so delicately put it.  They could have as many kids as they wanted.
“I’ll have to.” Daphne finished.
“How did you know?”  Monstespan asked.
HDHDHDHDHDHDHD
Harry sat in Advanced Potions early the next morning.  Who the hell thought potions first thing in the morning was a good idea?  Snape had yet to arrive.  He hadn't died either.  Apparently a snake bite didn't kill vampires.
Harry looked at the family tree Hermione had drawn for a few more moments before allowing himself to move onto the next question.  “So, why is Malfoy’s name all over the newspaper article?”
"I'm sorry for punching him, I know he's your friend."
"Yes," Vince spoke up again, "Draco can only eat from your hand and, you know, at your feet."
Harry entered behind Snape and stopped dead at the scene before him.  The rooms were in ruin, the bed linen in disarray, the table overturned, broken china and glass covered the floor.  On the floor beside the bed was a prone figure, Bors and Ajax standing over it, and Harry hurried over, but it wasn’t Draco.
Harry was a sucker for trust.  "Well, how much looking after does he need?"
The Church of Our Lady of the Snows was not currently in the snow, it being August, but it was still impressive.  It soared high above the surrounding buildings, its cream chancel walls rising in gothic splendour, broken by huge expanses of stone-lined window.  Harry entered quietly and sat in a pew.  The air felt muffled around him, soft and heavy.  He sat for a while looking at the alter in front of him.  It reminded him of Versailles in its opulence, with soaring gilt columns and brightly painted figures.  If Draco was here, he probably felt at home.
Hermione hit him playfully on the arm.  "I'm fine.  Rosie has everything she needs.  I'm not freaking out at all."
“Of course, Your Majesty.”  Malfoy replied for both of them.  “We would be honoured.”
Harry winced.  Zabini turned to Ron, eyes blazing. "Do you not know when to shut up?  Dove isn't even allowed to see his father before they do it.  It's like he's lost Luc already.  He's in mourning."
“So,” Harry broke the silence.  “What now?”
He turned to Harry, and gestured that he continue walking down the path.  “I trust you haven’t been too bored by the Chevalier.”  Snape said, some of his good humour from his discussion with Montespan seeming to remain.
"Love you too, Master." Draco all but sighed.  Then he was asleep.
"Right." Harry rallied.  "Well, what does Dove like for breakfast?"
"Reassure him, he'll be scared."
He ran from his room and out into the hallway.  There were others leaving their rooms and wandering into the corridor in confusion.  Harry followed the general flow of people towards the Hall of Mirrors.  It was strange to see the extravagant gallery filled with people in their nightclothes.  There were guards in red robes and plumed hats mingling with frightened looking nobles.  Harry quickly singled out Snape as one of the few dressed and not looking like a terrified rabbit, and made his way over to him.
Harry’s stomach was too knotted for him to feel particularly hungry, but he nodded anyway and sat down opposite Draco.
"Fucking Death Eater scum." Ron yelled.  Draco just stood in the centre of the room staring at his feet.  "No one wants you here, you should be in Azkaban.  Well, you haven't got your bodyguards to hide behind now.  You and your pathetic father will get what's coming to you." Draco's eyes flicked up to Ron's face at the mention of his father.  Ron continued gleefully when he got a reaction.  "That's right, your precious daddy is going to die.  Gonna cry about it, Malfoy?" Harry wondered whether he should speak up, neither of them had noticed him yet and he was transfixed with shock at his friend’s cruelty.  Dove still hadn't said a word but his eyes were now fixed on Ron instead of his feet.  "He deserves it, you know that right Malfoy?  He deserves what he gets, he deserves..." Ron was cut off by Draco stepping up and punching him in the face.
“The whole thing was weird.”  Harry announced.  “Malfoy got all distant and formal when he was talking about the palace.  Like he was reciting information about people he’d never met.  The King’s his brother, you’d think he’d take it a bit more personally.”
“Bloody hell, Harry.  What does this French bloke want with you?”
Severus gave a rare smile.  "It sounds like you know what you're doing.  Please take care of Draco for me."
"How are you, you look like shit."
Dove looked up at him with his beautiful wide eyes.  "Why would you do that for me?"
“I’ll give you a clue,” Harry held his hand palm down by his waist, “they’re about this high, hairy all over, and they can rip a person’s throat out in about fifteen seconds.”
"If you'll call me Harry, and I don't think they're really children anymore."
“You should, Draco.”  Harry assured him.  “You should choose for yourself.”
Harry and Neville made their way with some trepidation down the train until they found Slughorn’s compartment.  Harry hadn’t been sure what to expect when he entered the carriage, but what he was met with was an elderly, fat man in one corner of the compartment.  In another sat two boys Harry recognised as seventh years.  Next to them were two more familiar faces, Blaise Zabini and Draco Malfoy.  Harry knew Zabini only as a Slytherin in his year.  The boy had olive skin and strong features, and most of the girls in Gryffindor seemed to spend a significant amount of their time discussing him.  Next to him Malfoy looked disocncertingly pale, and there were dark crescents beneath his eyes.
“Just that I should be honoured at being invited, and that I should tell him my answer.”
Draco mock scowled at him.  "Funny,"
“You’re itching to get duelling, I can tell.”  Ron grinned.
"Draco, what did you mean when you said you didn't have to get into fights anymore?"
"Yeah, well, he's still a prick." Ron finally managed.  Hermione just looked distinctly unimpressed.
"Yes, Master." He snuggled back into Harry's embrace. "Harry..." He murmured tentatively.
Harry reflected that the ceremony couldn’t have been anymore dull if it had been conducted in Gobbledygook. Perhaps it had been, for all the attention Harry had paid it. He hadn’t exactly needed Draco’s warning not to tear up. They filed out of the pavilion in which the ceremony had been held and onto the lawn. They were in open parkland on the west side of Lake Windermere, muggle-repelling charms firmly in place around the perimeter. It had been a controversial decision on Marina’s part to have the wedding out of London, where all government business was held, but Harry was grateful for it. It was nice to be out of the hustle and bustle of the capital, and breathe some fresher country air.
"Yes, sir." Draco whispered.
Greg started the proceedings.  "I call the element of earth into the circle to preside over this bond."
“I don’t know.  I’m not sure I want to know.  I have more than enough to worry about already.”
Ron considered.  "Well, I did make Malfoy cry." He said finally, with some satisfaction.
“Indeed.”  Snape murmured.  He made his way to Malfoy’s chair.
Harry nodded and grabbed Ron's arm, guiding him out of the dormitory.  He sighed, it looked as though diplomacy had finally broken down.
“Yes, well, that wasn’t so unusual at the time.  Cousins marrying, I mean.  Anyway, they had a child when they were in exile, after Charles X abdicated, in Edinburgh actually, but they kept it a secret and raised him in the wizarding communities of the cities they lived in.  It was only in 1848, when Napoleon III abdicated, that the French wizarding community invited their son, Ferdinand, to be king.  His line has been on the throne ever since.”  She added Ferdinand to the tree.
Harry was taken aback by Malfoy’s admission.  It was unusual for the other boy to volunteer personal information.  He didn’t want to push his luck, but he had a suspicion of what the cause of the Countess’s ire might be and he felt he should disclose his knowledge.  “The Queen’s Maids of Honour mentioned something about a marriage arrangement.”
Harry didn’t stop, he pushed his tongue into Draco’s hole and sucked. Draco’s hips came off the bed as he shouted Harry’s name. Harry grinned as best he could and went to work. When Draco had been loosened sufficiently and was a whimpering mess on the bed, Harry slipped two fingers in next to his tongue and stretched him. Draco moaned distractedly and bore down on his fingers.
“Does that take up a lot of time?”  Harry was intrigued; Malfoy did not often talk about his own role in the French court.
“You know the answer to that.”
"How can I help you, Harry?"
"Dove wake up." Vince shook him.  "Come on baby, wake up."
Draco’s hands found Harry’s waist, and his nails dug frantic gauges into his back. He felt like he was on fire, every nerve-ending overloaded with pleasure. He brought his hips up to meet Harry’s downwards thrusts and moved a hand between their bodies to squeeze his cock. Harry pulled his arm away and linked their hands on the bedding.
Hermione shook her head.  "Harry, don't start this again."
Harry pulled  Draco to his feet, turning him around.  "You look beautiful."
“Precisely.  As soon as Mr Malfoy had found cover he had one.  You must remember to be aware of your surroundings when you duel, whether they can offer you safety, or” he looked straight at Harry, “danger.”  Harry thought, involuntarily, of Sirius falling through the Veil, as he was sure Snape had intended.  He wasn’t sure whether Snape was being cruel or simply trying to hammer his point home.  Watching him interact with Malfoy had confused Harry’s view of him.  “What else?”
Leaving his left hand with Ajax, Harry repeated the same ritual with Bors with his other hand.
"So I wouldn't have to sit with little shits like you." Harry finally was allowed to finish a sentence and shouldered past him into the room, pulling Draco along with him by the hand.
“Right,” Mr Potter’s voice came back slightly muffled by the spell, “show her in, Draco.”
“How is she?”  For some reason Harry had the impression that Narcissa Malfoy wasn’t well, but he wasn’t sure where from.
“Of course.  He’s the closest thing I have to a brother.”  Then Malfoy hesitated, and added.  “Aside from His Majesty, of course.”  But Harry thought the first bit was the truth.
“Because you’re the Secretary for Magical Unity and Togetherness, and Daphne’s parents are known to have had Death Eater sympathies, so you appear to be unbiased in your favouring of her, but they kept their hands clean enough for her to be a respectable date for you.” Unlike Draco’s own parents and Draco himself.
“Is that a good idea?”  Goyle asked.
“What kind of letters take the whole of dinner?  Couldn’t they wait?”  Harry couldn’t imagine any letter that would engross him to such an extent that he would miss a meal.
Harry laughed. “Draco, I wake up every morning and see you. Having you in my bed rather than next to it will only be an improvement.”
“Cru-”
She favoured him with a smile.  “Please, call me Lisette.”
"Oh.  Thank you, sir.  But if I may ask, why now?"
Draco looked away, his smile sliding.  “My brother sent you to get me.”
And then he leaned forward and pressed his lips messily to Draco’s. Draco wanted to push him off and tell him he was drunk and that they should both just go to bed – separately – but somehow that just didn’t happen. Somehow Draco was melting backwards and moaning into Harry’s mouth and trying to get their bodies as close together as possible. When they broke apart for air Harry smiled dopily down at him. “Now… bed’s a good idea.”
Draco reached Harry and began to undo his belt. Harry lifted his hips for Draco to pull off his trousers and boxers, his cock sprung free and Draco closed his hand around it. Draco savoured this moment, first contact. Harry’s cock was heavy in his hand, slightly above average in size and swollen with blood. He kicked a leg over to straddle Harry’s knees and dipped his head to lick the tip before sinking his mouth onto it. Harry’s was thicker than any other cock he’d sucked, so he had more trouble deep throating than usual, and the angle was awkward. Draco shuffled until he resting on his elbows, hands brushing Harry’s hips. He could take more in at this angle, and Harry’s hand came down to stroke his hair in appreciation.
"I wanted to talk to you about Lucius Malfoy's case.  I'm sure you know my submissive, Draco."
"If that's okay, Master.  You've worn me out a little." He yawned cutely, wrinkling his nose a little.
Harry wasn’t sure how that constituted avoiding maiming anyone, at close range the curse could easily kill.  “Recanto!”  Malfoy snapped.  The green light that emerged from his wand met Zabini’s and enveloped it, leaving it to fizzle in the air without reaching its target or deflecting dangerously.  “Slugulus Eructo!”
The Slytherins moved first, following her inside.  Malfoy got out another cigarette with his free hand.
"Its a joke because 'live fast, die young' is a muggle saying, I think it's an old film title.  And as for 'marry well', Malfoy's gay isn't he? I don't think that's the pureblood definition of marrying well." Hermione rolled her eyes and looked away from a floundering Ron.
"They haven't done anything to me." The Minister continued to look disbelieving.  "Come on, Kingsley, you know I can resist the Imperius curse, and someone would have noticed and informed you if I suddenly started acting oddly."
"It's okay, pet, just open your mouth for me, I'll do the rest."
"Punishing me when I needed it.  I'm sorry for disobeying you."
Draco looked uncertain and moved to sit at Harry's feet.  "Greg said you're gonna spend some time with me at the weekend."
“Of course,” Harry felt stupid, “it’s just that Malfoy, Draco, said…” Harry trailed off, unsure of what he was trying to say.
Hermione just shrugged.  “I don’t know. I don’t know what kind of relationship he has with his brother.  I suppose it would be a little far-fetched even for him to claim that the King of France is going to intervene in school-boy disputes, especially if he knows he won’t.”
“What did he say to you when he gave you the letter?”  Hermione asked Harry.
"Give him bite sized pieces of food.  You can use your fingers or cutlery, whichever is easier for the food."
“Er, no,” Harry replied, “he wasn’t too bad.”
“You’re not going to try and turn me into a werewolf, are you?  Like Zabini tried to with Malfoy.”  Harry asked when the Slytherin sat down beside him.
Malfoy already looked exhausted, and as he went on to outline the other preparations that would need to be made in the next few days, Harry understood why.  A tailor was coming from Paris to make sure both of them had outfits in the latest court fashion.  “So send to Gringotts, Potter” Malfoy said, “it’s going to be exorbitantly expensive.”  And there were gifts to buy for the King and Queen, and the new Dauphin, both to mark their arrival and to give on Christmas Eve.  “But I’ll pick them,” Malfoy assured him, “you just put your name on the card.”  They hadn’t even left Hogwarts yet, and Harry already couldn’t wait for it to be over.
"Potter, can you just muzzle your dog and get out of here please, at least until dinner."
“Empty classrooms?”
“There is a growing understanding,” Snape had explained at the most recent meeting, “that the Dark Lord is insane.  Many pureblood families, in spite of their political beliefs, no longer want to place themselves in such a perilous position.  They have seen what the Dark Lord is willing to do to members of his own circle, and while the may have no qualms about muggles and muggleborn being mistreated, they have no desire to see their children suffer the same fate.”
“Errr…” Malfoy had been turning to leave, but now he looked back at Harry.
"Thank you, sir."
"Sure, that's why you parade your Dark Marks around the place, making sure everyone knows about them with those ridiculous wrist ties." Ron just wouldn't give it up.
“I’m sure you know why I have asked to see you, Lord Dorchester.”
"Thank you, it feels brilliant." Harry swelled with pride at the words and the happy flush on Draco's cheeks.
"Lucius." Severus hurried over and wrapped his arms around his mate's waist.  Lucius rested his head against Severus' shoulder.  Draco took Harry's hand and retreated a little.
“If the wrong person hears him calling me ‘Your Royal Highness’ I’m going to be murdered in my sleep.”  Ajax growled softly behind them.  “Hush.”
"Yes, Master.  It's very... bright."
"No, I'm certain.  I want to do this now.  I'm just nervous, you know?"
Harry reread the paragraph several times in an attempt to understand the dynamics it described, but could only really surmise that Lucius Malfoy was the stepfather of a French king.  He was prevented from further perusal of the article by Hermione’s arrival.  She stepped onto the kitchen hearth and then over to the table where Harry had been having a late breakfast.
"No, it's not okay.  You bloody Slytherins are so full of it.  You come back here like nothing happened.  Showing off you Dark Marks.  Prancing around, taking over our dormitory.  You should all be in Azkaban with you're worthless parents."
“The problem is,” Daphne began their scheming, “that my parents really want the marriage to go ahead.”
“You and everyone else,” Harry muttered.
Snape took a cigarette for himself and returned the case to the sideboard.  “If he insists.”
Bors nosed it open and trotted in confidently, Harry followed with slightly less surety.  Draco was sitting at the table they had played cards at the previous day, and before him was spread an array of food.  He gave Harry one of his shy half-smiles and Harry felt his insides warming and tightening.  He swallowed and proceeded further into the room.
“Harry you didn’t.”  Hermione sounded scandalised.
“Tea?”  Malfoy offered.  He had replenished the pot only ten minutes earlier.
Harry pushed the door open and entered the dark room.  Snape sat at the desk but stood as Harry entered.
“Can I see them?”
“I was thinking Sunday morning, maybe, before the Hogsmeade trip.”
Harry had also taken the time to look at a map of England and find out where exactly Dorchester was.  In Dorset, unsurprisingly, but the Black family seemed to have lost whatever historic connection they had to the city.  He was now Harry Potter, fourteenth Marquess of Dorchester.  This gave him a whole slew of responsibilities, such as voting for the implementation of new wizarding laws put forward by the Wizengamot, and a seat on the Board of Governors at Hogwarts.  Luckily for Harry, he could not take any of these positions until he had come of age.  Given the return of Voldemort, and the prophecy Dumbledore had revealed to him the previous term, Harry wasn’t entirely sure he would live to see his seventeenth birthday.  If he did get the chance, Harry would have liked to honour Sirius with his political decisions, but as Sirius had never had the opportunity to exercise the rights given to him by his position, Harry did not know what he would have wanted.  Although his parents had not legally disowned him, and so Sirius had inherited on his father’s death, this had not occurred until he was already in Azkaban, and so while his title had not been stripped from him – there was no surviving family to demand it and no foreign king gunning for him – he had hardly been welcome in the Ministry.  Harry didn’t know what political stance Sirius would have taken had he had the chance.  He didn’t know very much about his godfather at all.  He know Sirius would have opposed anything discriminatory towards muggleborns, but he had never discussed his views on the economy or education or any of the other things Harry would soon be asked to make decisions about.
"Greg told me we could be good.  That we didn't need to get into anymore fights with the Gryffindors.  He'll be so disappointed."
That set Draco’s brain into motion again. He had been trying to get Mr Potter to go to bed because Mr Potter was absolutely off his face. And because he was absolutely off his face, this was definitely not a good idea. “No, Mr Potter, I don’t think that’s a good idea. I mean you should go to bed, but by yourself. You don’t want to do anything you’ll regret tomorrow.”
The students started moving more purposefully and Flosi was able to manhandle Harry past them and up the stairs.  They entered the Great Hall, which was empty save for a few startled looking Hufflepuffs who had already made their way up from their basement, and Harry shrugged out of Flosi’s hold.
“I’d rather disembowel myself.”  Harry assured her as Ron simultaneously said, “Urgh, Hermione, don’t be disgusting.”
Malfoy leaned in.  “What was that, Blaise?”
Harry moaned in arousal as Draco's body was revealed to him.  The smaller boy was completely naked now, and hard.  A beautiful flush coloured his pale skin and he quaked a little under Harry's gaze.  Harry stroked him gently, down his neck then chest, his stomach then finally his cock.  Dove whimpered under his Master's touch.  He'd never felt anything like it before.
Kingsley turned his attention to Severus.  "What have you done to him."
"You had to hate us before, and you don't now."
“Not if I can help it.”  Blaise Zabini had slipped into the chamber as they had been talking.  “Shift yourself, Potter.”  He chivvied Harry out of the way so he could get to the wall behind him.
HDHDHDHDHDHDHDHD
Harry had to pull himself together, stop examining the way Draco’s soft robes lay over his shoulders, the way his arms hung easy at his sides.
Harry threw a pillow at her.
Dear Lord Potter,
But all of Harry’s mental preparation, and all the coaching Draco and Snape had given him, were to be for nothing.  “Well, there’s no point drawing this out.  I want you to know that I’ve already made my decision.  We can't justify a costly and violent campaign in a foreign country.  I’m going to have let Britain resolve it themselves.”
“Sir,” he said in greeting.
They both got dressed, then Harry gestured for Draco to sit in the chair in front of the vanity.  Harry stood behind him and brushed out his hair until it shone.  Taking a piece of hair from the the front of each side, he plaited both about a third of their length.  He had asked Pansy and Hermione to teach him how to do it, which they had done with enthusiasm, all the time cooing about how cute it was that he wanted to learn.  Then he brought both plaits back to meet behind Draco’s head, clipping them in place with the clasp he had bought.  It shrank the fit the smaller size.  The plaits finished inside the clasp, so bellow it all Draco's hair hung freely.
Draco merely smiled.  “What else are brothers for?”
“Er, right.”  Harry said, unsure of whether Snape was serious or not.
Harry opened his eyes to sunlight spilling into the room.  They been a bit busy to close the curtains the previous night.  He was spooned behind Draco, his cock nestled between warm cheeks.  God, this was good.
No one else was able to say anything for the rest of the lesson because Professor Goldmann entered and refused to let anyone talk when they weren't answering questions.  Harry could still feel the stares, though; especially Ron's glare which was boring a hole in his back.
Ron left, yet again disappointed. Harry noticed some junior assistants giggling as they watched his auror physique make its way out of the office, and before he closed his door he heard Draco call in saccharine tones: “Hannah, Jane, you’d best make sure those pureblood to muggle-born marriage statistics are on Mr Potter’s desk by four, or I know how disappointed he’ll be.”
“But he’s the French king.”  Harry pointed out.
Draco broke the comfortable silence. “Is it going to be awkward when we wake up tomorrow and see each other?”
"I want you to understand why I don't want you smoking.  I don't care what other people do, they can smoke or not smoke, it doesn't matter to me.  But I do care what you do.  Smoking isn't good for you, it can cause all sorts of problems that even Wizards can't cure.  I wont have you get ill like that, I care about you too much.  From a purely selfish point of view, I don't want to kiss you if your mouth tastes like cigarette smoke.  Lastly if we have children, I won't have you smoking around them.  Especially while you're pregnant, it could seriously endanger the children, and if you won't give up now, then when?  Do you see my point, Draco?"
"It is I who would be honoured, Master." Draco gracefully accepted Harry's hand and allowed himself to be led onto the dance floor.
“I suppose nicking their Queen might cause some bad blood.”  Harry agreed.
“Whether your father’s handsome ward will be joining us for Christmas.”  Montespan lied smoothly.
“Perhaps it is just as well she is neutered.”  One of the other ladies, Marie or Claudine, Harry didn’t know, observed as they all watched the little dog make quite an exhibition of rolling onto her back in front of the Wolfhounds.
“Which he doesn’t.”  The Chevalier interjected.
“But you’ve got to make an effort now, Harry.  The King could be an important ally, and Malfoy’s your only point of contact.”
"Yes, of course, I'm sorry.  What did you want to talk about?"
Harry was so surprised he didn’t object.  He merely stood and followed Malfoy out of the compartment.  Malfoy slid the door shut behind them and motioned Harry to follow him out of view of the glass door.
They were rapidly approaching the end of the corridor, signified by a pair of busts flanking duck egg blue doors.  The doors swung open as they approached and Harry followed Malfoy into the next room.  He found himself on a balcony that had a railing along its length on the right and a wall with a single opening on the left.
“You know that, and I know that,” Daphne countered, “but my parents do not know that. Or at least they don’t want to know that. They’ve already released a press statement saying how happy they are for us and that they’ve always known we were perfect for each other.”
Goyle smiled his crooked grin around the room.  "Greg,"
“That much is obvious,” the Queen said tartly, but didn’t scold the girls further.  Instead she turned her attention to Harry.  “Well, Lord Dorchester, I apologise for your rather unorthodox entrance.  This is the Salon of Peace.  Won’t you come and sit with me.”
Lady Florence snorted.  “Please, the scene he made was so pubic, it’s hardly a secret now.  I mean really, storming into the King’s council room and demanding to know whether it was the King or Lord Wiltshire who had started arrangements for his marriage.  As if he has the right to demand answers from His Majesty.  Not that the King was particularly involved, I don’t think.  Then the Little Cavalier says that he won’t marry Louise de la Fare, even though it would be such an advantageous match for him, and storms out again.  Apparently the Earl still isn’t speaking to him.”  The delight was clear in her voice.
Vince laughed.  "Goddess, yeah.  Greg and I aren't getting married until Christmas and I'm terrified already."
“Tomorrow is an important day,” Enghein observed, “the Christmas Eve hunt and the ballet, you’ll join us for that, at least, won’t you, Dorchester?  Sorry, Harry.”  Another of his smirks.
“Harry,” Harry corrected for at least the fourth time.  The Duc smirked at him.
She received the news very calmly.  Asking simply: "How are we going to play this?"
“Where are we going?”  Harry asked as he hurried to keep up.
“Er, thanks,” Harry replied, thrown, “that would be great.”
"When are you planning on claiming him?" Greg asked.
Mercury interrupted his thoughts.  "Look, it's Aunt Hermione and Uncle Blaise."
"Kingsley, this is my father-in-law we're talking about."
Harry thought being deprived of quidditch was inhumane, although he expected nothing less from Lucius Malfoy.  “Couldn’t you just tell him to piss off?”
Down stairs, along a corridor, round a corner, and they were in front of Draco’s door.
“How on earth would I know, Potter?”  Malfoy snapped.  “Do you think I go around reading sealed letters from the King?”
"Ask Crabbe and Goyle."
“You like him a lot.”  Harry realised.
It was Theo's turn next.  "I call the element of water into the circle to preside over this bond."
The King turned his gaze to Harry.  Harry began to mentally rehearse what he wanted to say in his head.
Snape gave him his customary look of distain.  “Because if I call him otherwise in front of the wrong person I’ll be crucioed until I bleed from my eye sockets, Potter.  It’s not a habit I want to get into.”
"Hey, don't..."
Harry sighed.  "I have no idea."
"Good," Vince continued, "Draco was a spoilt child.  I know he seems submissive, and he is, but he's never had any rules to follow before.  He's on his best behaviour at the moment, but he's going to slip up a fair amount."
Hermione was now situated to the left of the entrance to Platform 9 and ¾ with the Weasleys.  Harry joined them and was quickly engulfed by a cacophony of greetings.  Between him, Ron and Hermione, they got their three trunks on board and into an empty compartment.  Then they went back onto the platform to say goodbye to Mr and Mrs Weasley.  Molly squeezed Harry as firmly as ever and cautioned them all to be careful.  Arthur told them to enjoy their sixth year, because their seventh year would be all about their NEWTS.
"That does not sound like Malfoy."
After classes that day Harry was sitting alone in the common room.
“We’re above the chapel vestibule,” Malfoy explained.  They approached the opening in the left-hand wall and Harry saw that it was in fact another pair of blue doors, decorated with gold and open to show another balcony beyond.  “That’s the chapel through there.”  Malfoy gazed out through the doors and crossed himself absently.
“And can I demand a public apology if people insult me?”  Harry didn’t want to spend the whole holiday being on the receiving end of implied slurs.  If he wanted that he could go to the Dursleys.
To Harry’s surprise, Malfoy laughed.  “You’re one to talk about favouritism.  He’s my godfather, Potter, of course I’m his favourite.”
Ron shook his head.  “No way.”
“Of course, but Blaise gets along.  He’s resilient.”  Malfoy’s voice was fond.
"Yeah," Vince continued, "Dove would understand if you wanted more time to think about it."
Soon, Harry began to guide Draco’s movements, increasing the pace and pushing Draco to take a little more. Draco moaned at Harry’s tender control and did his best to accommodate him. Just as the rhythm was starting to get the better of Draco, Harry gently slid him off his cock.
"We we have no questions for this witness, Madam." The prosecution lawyer already sounded defeated.
"None of us wanted anything to do with the Dark Lord," Vince continued, "but neither did we want to see our parents murdered.  You can't blame us for wanting to keep our families safe."
Harry watched Draco mix with the guests.  At the moment he was at his father's side, doing the pureblood heir thing; although almost every politician noticed and commented on the white gold collar around his neck, Draco just smiled and indicated his Master before continuing with his conversation.  Harry was proud to see his submissive so self assured and at ease among people who might very well sneer at him for what he was.  And Draco looked stunning.  He was wearing similar robes to what he had worn at their bonding, except the outer robe was a soft grey instead of silver, and wasn't as sheer as the silver one.  Altogether Draco didn't look designed for sex in the way that he had that night, he just looked dignified and beautiful.
Harry served himself a plateful of food.  "How do I do this?" He asked Greg quietly.
"Yeah, I think I'm starting to see that."
He turned away from Harry and delved into a pocket in his robes, coming out with a crucifix on a string of beads, which he handed to Malfoy.  Then he touched Malfoy’s hair, briefly, before he swept out.  Harry, Malfoy and Flosi were left alone for several long minutes, the only sound in the room the clicking of Malfoy’s rosary as he mouthed his Hail Marys.  The beads Snape had given him were a plain dark wood, varnished to a gleam.  They stood out against the pale skin of his hands as he counted out his prayers.  Harry felt some of the adrenaline leave him and he sat down beside Flosi on one of the sofas that inhabited the room.  Malfoy remained standing near the fireplace, his eyes closed.
“Yes, it came from the palace yesterday.  What were you expecting, an empty butterbeer bottle?”
Zabini smiled to show it was okay.  Then he looked around him.  "We should call each other by our first names." He announced.  The other houses looked sceptical so he elaborated.  "We're going to be sharing a dorm for the next year.  An anyway, when Greg and Vince get married at Christmas they'll both be Goyle-Crabbe and it'll just get too complicated."
Ron just snorted affectionately. “You really are useless, Harry. So what’s your favourite obsession got up his sleeve this time?”
Malfoy instructed him in the etiquette of the French court until just after nine, when they were interrupted by the door that led into Snape’s classroom opening.  Snape strode through and Malfoy broke off his sentence concerning the correct way to address the Queen and smiled at his godfather.
"What's going on with Draco?" Greg asked.
"Yes, he's writing his essay as we speak."
"What?" Harry was flabbergasted.
But Harry wasn’t scared of any of them, because Zabini’s voice cracked halfway through and the dogs’ tails were low between their legs.  All three of them warmed to Harry after that, and Zabini showed him a ritual that would cause an alarm to sound if a Death Eater crossed the line of a circle.  They cast it together around the castle, yet another line of defence.
Greg sat down next to Harry.  "You talked with Dove."
“You seem to know your way around.”  Harry wasn’t sure he could have found the tea in McGonagall’s office, let alone felt confident enough to rearrange the furniture.  For that matter, Harry didn’t think McGonagall would have been too pleased if he’d scheduled a meeting with another student in her office.
"Sleepy, sir." He slurred.
When Harry entered the dungeon room he was stunned.  The ceiling was high arches, presumably stretching up into the next floor.  The room was lit only by candles, arranged to mark out the circle.  In the east yellow candles described the circle, a wand of crystal lying among them, signifying air.  In the south red candles were placed with bejeweled athame lying with them, signifying fire.  In the west blue candles burnt next to a chalice, signifying water.  In the north green candles had been lit with a silver pentacle by them, signifying earth.  In the centre of the circle was an alter with purple candles burning atop it, signifying spirit.
He wandered off to do as he was told and Harry took a deep breath.  This was going to be a long weekend if he had to struggle to control himself around Draco the whole time.  He couldn't help it though.  The boy was beautiful, and the vulnerability and submission just added to it.
“You didn’t agree?”  Harry asked lightly.
"I've always thought it was to keep you alive, sir." It took Harry a second to realise that Draco's tone was unusually sharp.  He glared at him and Draco immediately dropped his eyes.  "I'm sorry, sir.  It's not my place..."
"So what is the plan?" Lily spoke up now, reiterating her best friend's question.
“He taught my father when he was at Hogwarts.”  Luna interjected unexpectedly.  “Maybe the Headmaster has asked him to come back.”
It was an unusual piece of initiative from Malfoy, and the Queen jumped on it.  “But of course, you must go.”  She assured Harry.  “You need to make friends with young men your own age.  I will see you both at dinner.”
Harry cautiously raised his hand.
When they slapped the magically reinforced handcuffs on him he thought that he probably deserved this. He had done a lot of harm in his life.  A lot of people had been hurt and killed because of him.  He knew that at this point in the war Dumbledore wouldn't be sticking his neck out to save him, not when he'd just been proved right.  Perhaps he deserved a stint in Azkaban, anyway.
“I think that if you want Draco back, your only chance is to defeat Voldemort.”
“Thank you, Pansy.”
"Funny, sir.  I meant am I allowed to wear it all the time, or is it for your viewing only?"
“But they’ll work for you when you’re older?”  Harry found himself perversely fascinated by the ins and outs of Malfoy’s elevated lifestyle.
“And is that how you want to spend you Christmas?  Chatting up politicians and royalty who just want to use your fame for their own ends?”  Harry had told her about Scrimgeour’s visit.
"Yeah," Harry frowned.  "He called me sir."
"Good.  Pretend to be fighting for the Dark Lord.  But if you see Potter, do not kill him."
“I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.”
But he didn’t have long to ponder his faux par.  A loud boom echoed through the dungeon and the castle seemed to quake.  Harry and Malfoy both jumped to their feet and Harry spilt his tea all over his robes.  Malfoy’s cup somehow ended up on the table without a drop leaving it.  The door burst open and Skarpheðinn ran in, Flosi at his heals.
“Of course it will help.”  Snape looked severe again.  “But you must also bear certain things in mind.  The King does not like flattery, so don’t waste your breath commending his virtues.  He is not a particularly religious man, so don’t speak to him of God’s will.  Don’t tell him about the Dark Lord’s evil, or all the innocents in danger.  Tell him only of his own gain, the safety of his people, the renown he will win if he delivers England safely.  That is the only way to win him.”
"Thanks." Harry knew he would probably be dead without Greg and Vince.
“He’ll be fine, Draco.”  Zabini said firmly, and then he too left the room as swiftly and silently as he had entered.
“No.”  Harry admitted.
"You don't need to, but giving the family some warning is the done thing."
"Yes, thank you."
“I know no more than you.”
“Death Eaters?”  Harry asked, and Skarpheðinn nodded.
"Its quite alright, Mr Potter.  I understand how delicate the courting process is.  If anyone enquires, I will tell them that Draco spent the morning helping me with a potion."
Beside Harry, Ron flinched.  “Protego!”  Zabini threw up a barrier and the curse bounced harmlessly into a wall without anyone vomiting slugs.  “Lycacomia!”
Malfoy be frowned.  “You may not like Professor Snape, but be careful about what you say about him at court.  He is also the King’s godfather.”
Malfoy’s cousins were terrifying.  Not particularly tall or even broad, but there as a wiry strength to them and their faces were weathered and sharp.  They were almost as fair as Malfoy, but their hair was a darker blond and the taller one was sporting a magnificent beard.  They both wore black robes and there was a hint of blue-black ink at their necks and wrists.
“I think, sir, that bed would be a better option for you than the sofa at the moment.” Draco reached out a hand to help the man up, but Mr Potter instead used it to pull Draco down next to him.
“Where is my brother?”  The King demanded.  “Where is he?  Bring me my brother!”
"When do you plan to claim Draco, Harry?"
"Snape?  Why?"
“I hadn’t thought.”
“And will they?”  Malfoy’s voice was tight.
Harry absorbed that for a few moments.  Harry wasn’t used to thinking of the Slytherins as individuals with skills and preferences.  Then, as his thoughts returned to the start of their conversation, an awful thought struck him.  “I don’t have to learn French, do I?”
Understandable, Harry thought.
Malfoy nodded and stepped away from him.  “Bors, Ajax, bedroom.”  He instructed, and the two hounds turned and trotted back the way they had come.  The doors they had entered the balcony through opened as the dogs reached them, and then closed firmly behind them.
"Stop squabbling." Severus ordered.  Lucius had tucked his head further into Severus chest, he didn't want to deal with people right now.  He wanted to sit quietly with Sev and try not to panic.
“Daphne’s going to meet you at the office to decide the best course of action, Mr Potter.”

"I'm not sure.  I understand what you're trying to say, but I'm not sure I believe you."
Ron started to mutter about not wanting to team-build with the Slytherins, but was drowned out by Zabini snorting and asking, "What, should we say which pets we have as well."
"You plan to give him a choice?"
She smiled a little mischievously.  “Since about the fifth century AD, I think.”  But at Harry’s frown she continued, “I take it you mean, why is there still a King of France after the revolution?”  Harry nodded.  “Well, there isn’t in the muggle world.  Since the defeat of Emperor Napoleon III in the Franco-Prussian War, France hasn’t had a muggle monarchy.  But the French wizarding community never declared a republic; they’ve retained a monarchy ever since.”
"Thank you, sir." Draco whispered.
"I will." Harry replied solemnly.
“Yes,” Draco replied, “but the Queen isn’t fond of the giant rats, so we’re having Swan Lake instead, and Sleeping Beauty on Boxing Day.”
"Today you will be making a healing draft.  Instructions are on the board.  Vials to be handed to me at the end of the lesson." His voice was tired.
“Yes, but her rooms are in the attic.”  Malfoy’s tone was neutral.
Draco drew in a deep breath as he imagined what they would do in the bed, how Harry would take him.  He could see himself tied to the grey wood headboard, or lying on his back among those pillows.  If he'd ever resented the sexual frustration he had to endure, it was now.
Feeling completely turned about, Harry took the letter.  After all, it had only been the previous term that Malfoy had been threatening Harry with dire consequences for getting his father arrested.  Now he was acting as messenger without a singe insult thrown at Harry.
“And how have you been?”  He asked her as she pawed at his shoulders and licked his face.  “Have you been a good girl for your Mamma?”
Harry snapped.  "Ron, shut up!" He yelled, surprising even himself.  "He's about to loose a parent, have a little empathy."
"Funny, Ana." Draco raised one pale brow.
"He's not really anymore, we've sort of drifted apart."
Harry bit his lip, he had been meaning to talk to Draco about this.  He didn't usually care about other people smoking, but Draco was his responsibility.  "I'd prefer it if you didn't Draco." He hesitated.  "In fact, I don't want you smoking at all, understood, Draco."
“Er – don’t call him that – that would be the rather expensive honeymoon I buy them very publically as a wedding present. Hopefully it’ll show my happiness at their nuptials. Then, when Dapnhe is Mrs Gregory Goyle, she can release the story of how I wasn’t actually proposing. God knows if anyone will believe it, but that’s not really important. At least no one will be able to say either of us has wronged the other, and that’ll be the end of that.”
They talked about lighter topics for few minutes, before Ron suggested that they both get back to work. Harry walked him to the door, having been well trained in office etiquette by Draco, and showed him out into the pen. Ron predictably stopped in front of Pansy’s desk.
“But from what?”  Snape murmured, clearly unwilling to further spook those milling around him.  “An infiltration of some kind?”
“Not particularly, it’s probably safer than Versailles from anti-monarchists and purists, and if Death Eaters get in here I don’t expect I’ll be their primary concern.”  Malfoy looked at Harry meaningfully.  “But others are.  The King has asked that certain precautions be taken.”
“But why haven’t we heard all about it?  I mean, this is Malfoy we’re talking about.  Forget ‘my father will hear about this’, I think ‘my brother, the King of France, will hear about this’ would be more impressive.”  Harry could hardly imagine Malfoy passing up a chance like that.
Draco's entire body went stiff.  His back arched until Harry was sure it would break.  His head lifted completely off the bed so it was Harry taking his body weight.  Then his body spasmed over and over again.  His eyes rolled back and he went limp.
Blaise continued.  "I call the element of air into the circle to preside over this bond."
As they stood chatting idly about the coming year, the low purr of an engine could be heard coming up the drive.  Moments latter a black convertible came into view.  Murmurs broke out amongst the students.
"Yeah, sure."
“And what should I call you?”  Harry didn’t particularly relish the idea of calling Malfoy ‘sir’.
"Hey!"
“Overwhelming,” Harry admitted, “everything’s so beautiful, I’ve never seen anything like it.”
Because of your own arrogance, Harry thought.
Finally Pansy spoke.  "I call the element of spirit into the circle to preside over this bond." Warmth flooded the room as the circle was completed, then Pansy continued.  "Draco, please make your oath."
"I'm sorry, I just can't.  Can you imagine what people would say?" Kingsley shook his head emphatically.
Malfoy huffed.  “Anyway, Swan Lake is the story of a princess called Odette who is cursed by a wizard to be a swan in the day and only a human at night.  She lives on a lake with other cursed girls.  A prince called Siegfried falls in love with her, which is good because the only way for the curse to be broken is if she is loved by someone who has never loved before.  The prince vows to kill the wizard and free Odette, but then at a royal ball, the wizard’s daughter comes to him disguised as Odette and Siegfried proclaims his love for her.  When the wizard reveals Siegfried’s mistake, Siegfried runs to the lake and begs Odette’s forgiveness, but his mistake has doomed Odette to life as a swan.  Unable to live without Odette, Siegfried joins her in committing suicide by jumping into the lake.  The final scene is usually them ascending to heaven.”
Harry groaned as he slid into Draco’s tight heat. He dropped his head to Draco’s collarbone and mouthed at the skin there. His hips found a steady pace of movement in and out, and he adjusted the angle until he found the spot that made Draco swear and arch off the bed. As he moved faster and harder, he raised his head to capture Draco’s mouth with his own and swallow down his desperate moans.
Harry smiled gently at him. “Well, you’ve been trying to get me into bed all evening. What are you going to do now that I’m here?”
“And you, Lord Dorchester, you must be tired.  My valet, Blouin, will show you to your chambers where you can rest a little, and then perhaps you might tour the castle.  If that is agreeable?”
“Might I ask,” the friar began tensely, “what your interest in finding such a person here would be?”
Harry smiled indulgently, pulling the covers over them.  "You sleep then, baby."
Hermione and Ron made their way to the prefect’s carriage, but Neville and Luna joined Harry in his carriage.  Harry enjoyed seeing them again.  They were both aware of the prophecy and had been part of what had happened in the Ministry before the summer.  Harry didn’t have to watch his words around them the way he did with other students, and they didn’t stare or trying to worm information out of him.  Instead, Neville coaxed him to talk about his plans for Sirius’ estate, which was something in which neither Ron nor Hermione were particularly interested.  Luna interjected with the occasional surreal observation about obscure magical creatures, but this was also soothing for Harry, as it alleviated the seriousness that had surrounded him since Sirius’ death.  None of them mentioned Voldemort outright, though his shadowed hovered over much of their conversation.  They chatted comfortably until they were interrupted by a knock on the compartment door.
“Blaise?  Yes, he gets that from his mother.  Apparently she was just the same when she was younger.  Had to be, I suppose, to disobey Alfonso Borgia.  I met him once, he’s terrifying.  She’s not like that anymore, though.  She's very cold.”
“What?”  Harry felt himself flush a little at being so transparent.
Harry frowned.  "Here with you, of course.  What makes you ask."
HDHDHDHDHDHDHDHD
Harry knew, because Draco had told him, that the French had their main Christmas meal on Christmas Eve, and also opened their presents that evening.  It was an odd concept to Harry, because the main events of Christmas Day had always been the food and the presents for him, and Harry wondered what actually happened on Christmas day if those had already been done.
“That would be good, yeah.” Ron was always supremely unconcerned by Draco’s cool tone.
Draco stormed into his room, Harry and Snape following closely enough to see the door smack into wall with enough force to damage the plaster.  Harry hadn’t seen such a display of emotion from the other boy in quite some time.
The Queen took Harry’s arm and led him out of the Salon of Peace, past the stairs Harry had descended and on to a pair of doors.  “I don’t suppose you’ve seen our Hall of Mirrors, have you, Lord Dorchester?”
Belle settled into Harry’s lap without complaint and Harry laid a tentative hand on her warm flank.  He wasn’t entirely comfortable with the fragile little thing in his hands, but his mind was on Draco’s words.  “Do you think I can persuade him?”
Harry knew what the girls were alluding to.  Hermione had mentioned the connotations of Malfoy’s title, and Harry had himself looked into Philippe I d’Orleans, who was generally called Monsieur, to satisfy his curiosity.  Although married twice, Philippe’s main romantic attachment had been to the Chevalier de Lorraine.  Hermione had wondered what the King’s intentions had been in giving Malfoy the same title.  If Louis had wanted to make implications to the rest of the court regarding his brother’s sexuality, he had succeeded.  As for the truth of the matter, Harry couldn’t guess.
That was true, Harry was sure she’d read it in a book.  “Ok, but how do you remember this stuff?”
Harry kissed him gently then led him into one of the sitting rooms.  It was as bright as the entrance hall, pale grey walls and cream sofas.  They went through to the formal dinning room.  The dinning table had a glass top and pale wood frame.  The chairs were cream leather and the walls were a pale coffee colour.
“Who?”  Harry asked, but he was already moving to follow Malfoy.
"Then we will reconvene in half an hour for the closing speeches."
Snape gave him a slightly fonder look than that with which he had favoured Harry.  “And hear about your most recent heartbreak?  Another time.”
They turned and went to dinner, Harry looked at Hermione.  "Gonna tell me what that was about?"
Harry heard a commotion across the hall.  Louis was there, his white nightgown covered with an ornate golden robe.
“Hey,” Crabbe threw a pillow.
"He just wants to serve you."
Harry looked at him askance.  “How?  He seems nice enough.”
"That is correct." Calcare confirmed reluctantly.
Crabbe's eyes slid away.  "Yeah, we thought you might have noticed that, you always had a thing for watching Draco." He looked over at Goyle, who nodded.  "We don't want this getting round, yeah? We wouldn't usually tell people, but we do owe you guys, and we figure we can trust you." Harry was startled, but tried to hide it.  "Draco's a magical submissive, turned on his seventeenth birthday."
"Well, I was thinking sometime later this week."
Great, Harry thought, Snape.
Harry frowned.  "Did she mention anything about Malfoy?"
The saleswoman retained her smile.  "Forgive my assumption, sir.  But I have something perfect."
Harry shifted a little.  This was slightly uncomfortable and incredibly erotic at the same time.  All his friends hearing the nature of his relationship with Draco, not that they didn't already know what Draco was.
Malfoy hesitated.  “You may have noticed that there has been some anxiety about my safety this year.”
"I'm not asking you to do anything spectacular.  Just look in the pensive and do what's right."
“I think that rather depends what it is.”  Harry kept his tone light but his words were guarded.
“What?  Who?”  Asked Harry distractedly.
Draco blinked.  "I thought Greg told you what I am, sir."
They were led to the third floor where their dorms and common room was.  The common room was done in carefully neutral colours, but was otherwise pretty similar to the Gryffendor one.  The boys were directed to a door on the left through which was their dorm.
"Innocence? This is Lucius Malfoy we're talking about, Harry."
“You can return to your common rooms,” she told Harry and Malfoy, “the Aurors have dispersed the Death Eaters in Hogsmeade.  The wards were not breached, thanks in large part to the help you and your brother have given us, Mr Bjarnsson.  You have our gratitude.”
“You’re that much better than him?”
Harry kissed Draco goodbye outside Snape's office.  Draco was going to spend sometime with Greg and Vince whilst Harry talked to Snape.  Harry had been ordered by the formidable Professor to visit after classes, so here he was.  He knocked on the door as Greg and Vince escorted the blond out to the grounds where they were going to spend the late afternoon.
Harry followed The Lawyer out into the hallway, holding Draco's hand.  He caught up with him quickly and attracted his attention.
"He was smoking when I asked him not to." Harry sighed.
“So we’re going to hide?”
Crabbe's turn to smile.  “Don’t worry, we know some decent silencing charms.”
Harry looked at them in shock, it was rare for the Slytherins to initiate contact out of the blue.  "Yeah, hey."
“An ally?”  Harry was disbelieving.  “He’s Lucius Malfoy’s stepson.  I don’t know why he would be my ally.  I assume he wants me dead, just like Voldemort.”
"I want to fuck you." Harry said hoarsely.
“Hold out you hand, let them smell you.”  Malfoy encouraged.  “Go on, palm up under Ajax’s chin.”
"Father," Salem tugged on Harry's robe, "I'm not going to be in Hufflepuff, am I?"
“Broom closets?”
"What?"
“Pansy isn’t that polite to anyone, sir. I really do think you should go to bed now.” Having Mr Potter practically on top of him wasn’t doing certain parts of his anatomy any favours.
"He was explaining why he had to make me hate Slytherins.  He did a pretty good job of it too, back then.  He was so annoying that I didn't notice what an idiot Ron could be.  It gave us a united front." Harry sighed, remembering old times.  "But this is better, I like knowing the truth."
Ginny was eyeing him shrewdly.  “You’re going to go, aren’t you?”
Draco groaned. “Your cock, Harry, I want your cock in me.”
“Right,” Draco said hollowly.
"Are you suggesting that Malfoy didn't commit any of those crimes?" Clacare asked in disbelief.
“Why are we in here?”  Harry demanded immediately.  He didn’t want to be shut in here waiting to find out what was happening while the rest of the school was out in the Great Hall.
"This Thursday, if I can prove that I care about him before then."
Snape held out a portkey rod, identical to the one Draco had used the first time Harry had visited Versailles.  Even though it had been eighteen months since he had seen Draco, those memories were still as fresh as ever.  Harry had the feeling that Louis would be none too pleased at Harry turning up in his riding clothes, but there was no way he was going to take the time to change.
Snape pursed his lips.  “Yes, Mr Potter?”
Today the courtship would start properly.  Harry had to prove he could be the dominant partner.  That meant giving him orders as well as physically dominating him.  The former he was pretty sure he could handle, but the latter posed a little more of a problem.  How could he dominate Draco without taking it too far sexually.  After all, Harry had read in his research that if a submissive was 'used' (the term the book used) before they had been claimed then it made claiming them impossible.
“Do you think she’d know what it is?”  Hermione asked absently.  “Ok, so, as you know, Louis XVI was deposed in the Revolution of 1792.”  She wrote L16 1792 at the top of the paper.  “Then his son, Louis XVII was sort of the king for a couple of years, but it was during the Revolution and he was only ten when he died, so he wasn’t very important.”  She drew a line down from L16, labels it ‘son’ and wrote L17 at the other end of the line.  “Then there was the revolutionary governments and Napoleon Bonaparte, who declared himself Emperor.  Then after the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 Napoleon abdicated and Louis XVI’s brother Louis XVIII was King until 1824.”  She drew another line form L16, looping it below L17 and labelling it ‘brother’.  She wrote L18 1824 at the other end.  “Then he died and his brother Charles X took the throne but he wasn’t very popular so he abdicated in 1830,” a “brother” line from L18 and C10 1830, “and a distant cousin, Louise Phillippe I, took the throne.  He wasn’t popular either so he abdicated in 1848 and Napoleon Bonaparte’s great-nephew was elected President, and then declared himself emperor.”  She draws a line for ‘cousin’ from C10 and labels it LP1 1848.
"Sorry, Zabini," Harry muttered as he accidentally knocked into him.
“Hey, Pansy.”
Malfoy smiled reluctantly.  “I didn’t.”  Then he huffed ruefully.  “My brother is the King and he was allowed to choose his own wife.  Queen Élizabeth wasn’t necessarily the most advantageous match he could have made, but they fell in love.  The stakes of my marriage are much lower, so I don’t see why I shouldn’t enjoy the same luxury.”
The Slytherins all turned to him immediately, squashing onto the bed.  Greg pulled Draco into his lap, murmuring apologies.  Draco's father was in Azkaban awaiting to Dementor's Kiss.  Harry remembered after the final battle, Lucius holding Draco to him and refusing to let anyone else near him.  It had been oddly touching, Lucius' fierce protectiveness.
"That'll still be enough for him to know it's you."
