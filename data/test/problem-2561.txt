Teddy sets his mug down and rests his elbows on the table. ‘Look,’ he says, dropping his chin slightly as he levels them both a look. ‘You two are incredibly important to me. You made sure that I never once felt unloved or unwanted. I’ve had a happier family life than most of my friends because of it. I’m always going to be grateful for that.’
They push into the shop, marvelling at the sudden rush of warmth after the biting cold outside. It’s not terribly busy, but there’s a bit of a wait as they stand in line to order their drinks. Harry squints at the menu while they wait, before giving up and pulling off his glasses to wipe them clean. It’s a bit of a bother not being able to just spell them clean, but he can hardly do that in a room full of Muggles.
‘At any rate,’ Blaise continues, ‘my sources say that Lucius took the modified Time-Turner with him to Brussels. My best guess is he’s kidnapped Draco in an attempt to drag him into the fold, same as before. I don’t know why though - Draco’s made it abundantly clear that he wants nothing to do with Lucius or his fanatic tendencies.’
‘Fuck Dumbledore,’ Ginny utters vehemently.
‘Of course, Potter isn’t offended,’ Pansy intercepts smoothly with a dismissive flick of her wrist. She glances at Harry briefly and arches her eyebrow at him. ‘He’s just anxious about not having anyone to take to Astoria’s wedding. After all, Draco’s booked up all the way until Christmas.’ She leans forward, smiling at Narcissa. ‘But Narcissa, I’ve been dying to ask,’ she says. ‘Draco tells me you and the girls are starting a Muggle book club. Are you really? How delightfully modern.’
Harry’s feeling a bit dizzy, so he nods. There’s a flurry of bodies pressing against each other, too many people and too little air, and Harry sort of loses track of things a little until Draco pulls him out into the brisk night air, and they lean against the damp bricks while Draco lights his cigarette with a Muggle lighter.
‘Look, I wasn’t the one conducting the interview,’ Proudfoot says, raising his hands defensively. ‘But there’s no way Robards would have approved that sort of thing unless it was absolutely necessary.’
‘Draco?’ Harry croaks, his voice raspy from disuse.
‘I was jealous of you, you know,’ Harry confesses. ‘I had it in my head that you’re… that this is what the Chosen One is supposed to look like. Not like me. Not…’ he trails off and waves his hand over the general vicinity of his chest.
It’s funny how selective the Ministry’s memory is - but they’ve always been a bit biased when it comes to Harry. For every year that he saved the wizarding world as a child, he’d been dragged through hearings and reprimands as though he was some sort of miniature Dark Wizard in the making. Then, after the War, they’d slapped a medal on him and made him an Auror before he could even think about what he wanted. He was damned good at it, too. There was talk of making him Head Auror, before he left.
Narcissa sips at her wine. ‘Go on,’ she says, gesturing at Blaise. It’s the same, strange, polite gesture Harry’s seen Draco produce a hundred times.
The window is slightly ajar, allowing a soft breeze to sneak in through the curtains. Tufts of cream-white clouds dust over the cornflower sky. There is a bird singing in the garden, and the sound of the city is a whisper beyond the walls and wards of Grimmauld Place. The air smells faintly of Draco’s citrusy shampoo and summer flowers, and wet grass. The cruel chill of Azkaban seems nothing but a distant dream.
Pansy grins wolfishly and flips him off. Her nails are painted midnight blue and filed to a threatening point. ‘Next question,’ she drawls. ‘Have you been consuming any substances - coffee? Alcohol? Dreamless sleep? Oh, I can answer that - coffee
, Harry thinks.
A dark look flashes in Draco’s eyes, and Harry reaches out to grab his hand in warning before he can launch into his usual tirade against Dumbledore’s
The drink is ice-cold, and the sweet aroma of liquorice fills Harry’s mouth. He used to absolutely abhor liquorice, associating it with the nasty, black sweets that usually sat, untouched, at the bottom of his bag of pick-and-mix. Draco was the one that converted him in the end, informing Harry that this was the
In that world, he uses a curse instead of a disarming spell, and Draco wears an extra scar beneath his robes.
Harry takes a swig of the champagne. The bottle is charmed to keep the alcohol as ice-cold as when it was first opened. He sets the bottle down beside him on the wet grass. The aftertaste of the champagne is a little sour, but the air around them is sweet with the smell of rainwater and the green and mud that stretches on all around them.
Harry pulls a folded-up piece of paper from his pocket and slides it over to them. ‘And what sort of product do you two offer that falls within this price range?’
They take each ride together as a large group. Hugo is hitting that infamous Weasley growth spurt, which means he can go on all the rides, much to his father’s disapproval (even after Rose points out that
‘Am I not loud?’ Draco asks. ‘I have a wand now. I did a spell just now.’
- who was constantly vying to get Harry in trouble. He knows the angry, dangerous boy from sixth year. And he knows the fear-wild creature from the War.
Acquafredda tilts his head. ‘Not at all,’ he says, smiling pleasantly. ‘It is a good metaphor. They cast a long shadow - let us, hm, let us see if we can shine a very bright light on them. For now, we may start with Mr. Liu’s documents.’
Draco’s smile fades and he narrows his eyes slightly. ‘But how did you find the room?’ he asks. ‘It’s hidden very well. No spell can locate it, modifiers or not. I’ve hired the best Cursebreakers to try.’
Proudfoot makes to get up out of his chair, his mouth already open to protest, but he is swiftly silenced by a single look from Kingsley.
‘Slave-driver?’ Draco guesses, cocking an eyebrow.
softness. ‘I knew you’d find me,’ he says. ‘You always find me.’
The party moves to a vast ballroom that has been decorated to resemble a midnight garden in full bloom. The walls are smothered in a dazzling tapestry of flowers. Each pillar and chandelier are threaded through with climbing vines. A heady perfume permeates the air, broken only by the cool night breeze rushing in through the open windows and balcony doors. The quartet in the corner of the room starts up, a modified Sonorous filling the room with music.
‘Er, yes,’ Harry says. ‘Speaking of, have you seen him lately?’
, Harry thinks, but he takes a gulp of his drink and pushes on, because he’ll finish this story whether or not Draco wants him to. ‘As I was saying,’ he frowns, ‘I managed to trace the money back to a Selwyn Thestral Stables. As in, Sylvia Selwyn’s side business for when she gets bored of playing pure-blood housewife. I checked it all against old receipts and it’s her signature on the payments alright. So, I send the summary up the line about Sylvia’s involvement, I do all the fucking paperwork, cross my t’s, dot my i’s - and do you know what Robards says to me?’
Potter finishes his ice cream and continues ranting, waving his spoon emphatically. Draco is a little out of his depth - Potter’s knowledge of defensive spells is somewhat beyond the scope of Draco’s apprenticeship and Hogwarts education - but he tries to keep up as best as he can. He retrieves Potter’s cup, fills it with more tea, and drops another scoop of vanilla ice cream in it. He should know better than to enable the Auror’s insatiable addiction to sweets, but he is a weak, weak man.
Harry sighs. It’s really hard to explain something this complex to someone who doesn’t have the context. ‘Time is both fixed and ever-changing. It works a bit like the water cycle,’ he offers, gesturing vaguely.
Harry’s stomach does a swan dive into his feet. ‘Alright,’ he says, trying not to sound too defeated. ‘Maybe some other time.’
Harry bites down on his lower lip. There is a precipice that he’s toeing here, and once he takes a step over the edge he might likely never climb back out again.
Blaise launches into conversation straight away -
He feels cold fingers press gently against his forehead, against his eyelids, his feverish cheeks. He smells faint scent of mint, lemon and cedarwood.
‘Shit,’ curses Prentis. She yanks her wand out of her holster. ‘
He lurches out of the memory as a hand tightens on his shoulder. Neville’s anxious face swims into focus, lit by the radiant glow of his wand.
Halfway through Teddy’s summer holiday, an owl comes for Harry - from McGonagall, of all people.
‘For a bit of chocolate?’ Draco asks, giving him a look of faint bemusement.
Far above him he can glimpse a narrow tunnel of light, a patch of blue sky. But it is distant - torturously unreachable.
‘What did Lucius want with you?’ Blaise asks.
‘He’ll come back to you,’ Luna promises, wiping his face with a handkerchief embroidered with tiny radishes. ‘He always does.’
Harry pulls away slightly, just so he can lift his hands from Draco’s ribcage to brace the base of his skull, so Harry can track his thumbs over the rise of Draco’s cheekbones, to feel the warmth of his skin and to know that he is alive.
‘I beg your pardon?’ utters the member of the Wizengamot, recoiling in shock.
And then she is done, and Andromeda takes her place.
Harry glances back at the model he’s been working on for the past four hours. ‘I’ve been busy,’ he says, sounding a little curter than he wants to be.
‘Draco spares no expense for my comfort,’ Narcissa tells Harry. ‘He spends so much money. Money he should spend on himself. He’s such a good boy, Mr. Potter. My Draco always says the Malfoy money isn’t his, so he may as well spend it on me here. He spends it so that I never feel afraid or alone. I love him more than anything.’ Then, she looks Harry straight in the eye, and enunciates each syllable with precise care. ‘Do you understand, Mr. Potter?’
‘Oh,’ says Hermione, struggling to her feet. ‘Oh, Daphne, your sister, is she alright? Her wedding, oh god, her wedding, it-’
She shakes her head, her fingers latching around his hand in an iron grip.
, like someone who could swoop in and save Harry, instead of the other way around.
(Professor Lupin packing up his things, a resigned slump in his shoulders, guilt a tiny, cold pebble in Draco’s stomach.)
‘Harry?’ he murmurs, lifting his head up from the pillow.
Acquafredda pulls a small silver flask from the pocket of his waistcoat and tips a tiny bit of it into a cup before handing the coffee to her. ‘I can go through it with you if you like,’ he offers.
Harry leans forward against the tiles and tries to remember how not to collapse beneath the weight of it all, but the world is a heavy, awful place and he is buried beneath the shock and the grief and the long, abysmal years of his life that will yawn before him if he is without Draco’s light.
‘Oh, whoops,’ says Teddy. ‘Sorry. I’ll leave you to it.’ He steps back out of the bedroom, shutting the door with a firm
‘Sorry Harry,’ Hagrid says, very earnestly. ‘You really aren’t very tall, are you? Well, anyhow, you
Harry kisses the top of Draco’s head affectionately. ‘Nah,’ he says. ‘Always thought you were too tall to qualify as a twink.’
Or maybe that’s not enough.
him already,’ Ginny groans.
‘Right!’ says Ginny, twisting her torso to face Harry. ‘If you’re using the nubile phone-’
‘Ronald!’ shouts George from the other side of the room. He waves his tea around, causing some of it to spill over onto the polished floorboards. ‘I’ve got a fantastic idea. It’s genius, really.’
(she’s starting her alchemy apprenticeship next Spring)
She flashes him a bright smile. ‘Of course.’ She tilts her head slightly, tapping her fingertip against her lips. ‘You have been to Mrs. Malfoy’s?
Yes. He visits his mother in Paris during the weekend - he gives me the forwarding address for urgent matters.’ She scribbles it down on a card and hands it over to Harry. ‘I have not tried contacting Mrs. Malfoy yet. Perhaps the Bureau has?’
Michelle’s expression darkens immediately.
was appropriate interrogation protocol?’
Draco looks like he’s going to cry. ‘Who are you comparing yourself to? I’m hardly a saint, Harry. I’ve got a tacky tattoo to prove it.’
‘Yes,’ says Draco -
‘How much does she know about what happened?’ Harry asks, setting down his mug.
‘I want to do more,’ Harry replies. ‘What can I do? What do you want?’
and then informs them of her disturbingly detailed plan of how she’d like to murder the two of them.
(See the end of the chapter for
Blaise nods gravely. ‘And therefore it will be out of my hands and back into the control of the incompetence of the DMLE.’
He’s done nothing to be worthy of Draco’s praise. ‘But I’m not
Mass, momentum, gravity - those are the rules of the universe. Even magic must abide by these laws.
Ginny snorts. She swings her broomstick up and over, resting the metal hilt of it against her shoulder. ‘Right,’ she says, shaking her head in mock despair. ‘If you lads are quite done with your little lover’s spat, would you like to head in and get the food started while I go have my shower?’
Pansy’s eyes narrow dangerously. ‘Nope,’ she says decisively. ‘We’re not doing this.’
A group of fourth-year girls walking ahead of them turn around. One of them turns bright pink as the other two burst into fits of giggles.
‘He’s been looking for you,’ Luna says, when they take a leisurely stroll through the National Portrait Gallery and marvel at how full of life these paintings can be, even though they never move an inch.
Narcissa laughs at this - a light, pleasant noise. Harry doesn’t think he’s ever heard her laugh like that. He wasn’t even sure she was capable of it. Blaise guides her down the corridor towards the living room, gently nudging her forwards with the sheer width of his shoulders and his ridiculous height.
He thinks he hears someone calling out his name but he can’t stop. He has to get outside.
While it can’t hold a candle to his greenhouses at Hogwarts, Neville’s back garden holds an impressive array of magical and Muggle plants, with a meandering stone path that works its way from the conservatory at the back of the house down to the stream that separates Neville’s property from the forest.
?’ Draco asks, the corner of his mouth twisting bitterly.
It’s too late by any measure of polite society to call on Narcissa, so Harry wanders aimlessly through the streets of Paris, lost to reminiscing.
‘Hermione,’ Harry says, reaching out to take her hand in his. He smiles warmly at her. He hates these interventions, but he adores her, and he loves Rosie with every last bit of his tired old heart. ‘It’s going to be fine.’
‘Yeah, side effect of having a Horcrux attached to me for sixteen years,’ Harry replies. ‘Lost the Parseltongue, gained lots of other weird stuff. I found out last year that I can Apparate wandlessly as long as I travel along ley lines.’
She paces back and forth on the hot pavement, her fingers pushing her bangs away from her forehead. She makes a short, gasping noise in the back of her throat, and whirls around at Harry.
‘What is it that you need to tell me?’ Draco asks, when Harry has recovered. He takes off his glasses, folds them and places them on the bedside table.
Blaise casts a series of wordless diagnostic spells. Lights and runes flash over Harry at a dizzying rate, too fast for him to make much sense of them. As the diagnostic spells run their course, Blaise’s expression transitions from disgust to horror. His lips thin into a pale line and his eyes grow hard and flinty. He ends the final spell with a vicious swipe of his wand.
Draco is torn between sunrise-bright love and ugly guilt. He teeters towards the latter. ‘I’m sorry,’ he says. ‘I’m sorry. I know we had plans-’
They pick a spot on the grass in view of the Towers. Between the trees, the grey buildings gleam in the afternoon sun. They share bottles of sugary lemonade and Harry rejoices in the ability to lounge alongside his boyfriend without having people come up and disturb their peace (with the exception of a young woman and her girlfriend, who briefly enrol their help in taking an adorable picture of them both with the rides looming in the background). He’s so happy he feels like he’s spinning upwards into the blue sky, up, and up amongst the scattered clouds. He lies back into the grass and feels Draco’s weight next to him, his magic sprawling outwards, feels the sun on his face and feels himself, at long last, spinning in time with the world’s axis.
‘Just try and stay alive, Malfoy,’ he growls, whirling on his heel and making for the exit. ‘I’m sick of watching people die.’
He looks down at his fingers and wiggles them experimentally. They seem fine enough, but maybe there’s residual curse damage from the last duel that didn’t get picked up by the Healers. It’s happened before.
At the reception, Molly gets horrendously drunk, so Arthur ends up dancing with Professor Sprout, who’s nearly as drunk as Molly but better at remaining vertical throughout. Teddy and Victoire both take turns dancing with Rose, because she’s absolutely determined to make this
‘What do you
‘I was hidden in the best magical panic room money could buy,’ Draco points out. ‘
Pansy clears her throat. ‘Have you slept more than five hours the past two nights?’ she reads.
‘Oh, Merlin,’ Harry utters, recalling the utter horror of Draco’s parole party. ‘Please don’t.’
Harry runs his gaze along Draco’s handwriting. He’s read so many letters from Draco that he knows the phrases Draco favours, the metaphors he overuses. ‘It doesn’t really matter,’ he murmurs. ‘It’s better this way.’
They sentence Lucius to life in Azkaban.
weekend, so now Harry
Harry thinks that maybe they’re still dancing, spinning out over the ballroom floor. He should say something - but he is too breathless to speak, too giddy to find the right words. Instead he leans forward and presses his lips to Draco’s. The garden in his chest is aflame with golden marigolds of happiness.
‘But,’ Teddy says, raising a finger, ‘I’d appreciate it if you started locking your doors if you’re going to get up to any of that business again. I have managed to avoid walking in on my dads shagging my whole life and I don’t wish to start now.’
‘You’re ridiculous.’
. This is going to work. This is actually going to work.’
, and
‘Right,’ he says, tucking his chin almost imperceptibly, as though readying himself. ‘So. I had this bizarre and clearly unfounded belief that you would be entirely inexperienced. I had myself entirely convinced that I would have to show you where everything was.’
Draco smiles - if you could call such a bitter gesture a smile - and cocks an eyebrow. ‘I should have expected nothing less,’ he remarks lightly.
‘We’re very fond of him too,’ Pansy interjects smoothly. ‘He’s our favourite brat.’
Draco groans again. ‘Ugh,’ he whines. ‘The next time I ask you to pound my arse into next Sunday, kindly remind me that I am no longer a flexible little twink.’
‘Thank you,’ he says, looking up at the lawyer. The taut wire of tension in his shoulders eases off somewhat. ‘This is incredibly helpful.’
Draco’s lips part and he takes a sharp breath. ‘Harry.
Daphne tucks a curling wisp of her blonde hair behind her ear and takes a nonchalant sip of her champagne. ‘It’s a force of habit,’ she says, unrepentant.
‘Why?’ Draco asks, because he can’t begin to comprehend

‘Bathroom duel onwards,’ Harry replies.
‘Good morning to you too, Blaise,’ Harry grins viciously.
Harry remembers the bite of sharp nails on his chest -

him, deep into the darkest parts of him.
Ron shrugs. ‘That’s more Hermione’s area,’ he replies. ‘To be honest, I can’t wait to go home and sleep for three days straight. I’m knackered. I don’t know how you’re still upright.’
‘The potions I’m on help a lot, but it’ll be three years left before I’m back to normal,’ Malfoy says, taking the cup from Harry. His wrist twists, and the cup tilts in the opposite direction. His eyebrows climb his forehead as he stares down at the undisturbed tea. ‘I say, Potter, that’s an impressive stabilizing charm. Weren’t you terrible at Charms?’
Harry feels a rush of sympathy for that small girl with the haunting eyes, of having a death sentence handed to you before you had even tasted life. He’s never lost anyone to the slow decay of disease. They were taken swiftly, brutally - he can't imagine mourning someone he loves while they’re still breathing.
The member of Wizengamot smiles in what he probably thinks is a pleasant manner. ‘How interesting,’ he remarks. ‘Wouldn’t you say Mr. Malfoy demonstrated the same level of barbarity on those victims?’
That was how they met - the bride and groom. Through flowers.
Apparently, it takes a whole day to arrange an international portkey to Paris, so Harry takes the afternoon train. When he was working for the Aurors, he could never do this sort of thing - slip effortlessly between his two worlds. They can be purists about this sort of thing, even if there’s no threat of breaching the Statute at all.
things like this, there is no distance left for Draco to keep, and he falls, and falls, and falls.
didn’t he tell us?’ she uttered, gesturing sharply with her hands.
Ginny drops down beside him, her feet bare in the grass, the backs of her heels turned an angry red from the tight straps of her shoes. She’s exchanged her ripped wedding dress for a dream of flowing, silver silk that comes down to her knees and exposes her shoulders to the cool night air.
Healer Thompson shuts her records and sets them on her lap. She pulls off her glasses, staring steadily up at the wizard. ‘I did.’
Draco hates and loves Potter in equal measure. When he does things like this, when he
‘Would you like some tea, Harry?’ Andromeda asks calmly.
Harry can’t find Malfoy anywhere, but his echoes seem to haunt Harry wherever he goes.
(Harry, complaining about paperwork and being shoved unceremoniously back into active duty, expression loose and warm from the whiskey sour in his glass, beautiful and young and wild as lightning branching over a storm-rough sea.)
Harry huffs a quiet laugh. Draco’s hair has come loose from its neat parting, and his fringe falls over his forehead and into his eyes. Harry pushes a lock of pale hair out of Draco’s face.
‘Nah,’ Harry replies, already setting off towards it. ‘Just fangs.’
need a key,’ he says. ‘What you need is a way into the Panic Room.’
It takes a lot of control not to kiss Draco. Draco is so beautiful, framed in the amber lights as they take their nightly walks down the canals through the city, a creature dipped in inky shadow and warm gold. But Harry keeps it together, because to do anything more than this (their hands intertwined, a gesture perhaps too intimate for people claiming to be friends, for a
Harry doesn’t know this dance at all, but he knows Draco. He’s been following the lines of Draco’s body since they were flying through curtains of rain struggling to catch a tiny golden ball hurtling through the air. It is second nature to mirror his movements.
Harry sighs, sitting down at his table with the Malfoy family ledger still clasped in his hand. She’s snatched his work straight out of his hands before, and he’s not about to let that happen with Draco’s life on the line.
‘And the spells from Lucius’s wand?’ Hermione asks. ‘Could you please tell us what they were?’
‘I am so fucking happy you’re not dead,’ Blaise says, each word thrown out like a punch. He releases Draco and takes a step back, shaking his head. ‘Circe’s fucking tits, Draco. Why is your life
inside of me, let it spread its sickness inside of me. He wanted me there in the darkness with him.’
‘I remember,’ Draco says, smiling slightly.
Victoire meets them next to a rollercoaster that winds and weaves through the woods, wearing a Minnie Mouse headband and a mustard-yellow shirt that reads
And then suddenly it’s mid-January and Draco is still there in the morning, curled up beneath the covers with his arm flung over his eyes, and Harry asks him why he hasn’t gone home yet, to which Draco replies,
Pansy sets the paper tray of food down on the table and pulls her sunglasses off, tucking them into the vee of her t-shirt. She scans the mess of scattered papers and the mugs of cold tea.
, Harry, that you would ever reciprocate.’
Lucius Malfoy gave him an armoury of weapons. It gives Draco a strange sense of satisfaction to use them against him now. His gift at letter-writing is some parts talent, some parts a very thorough education in diplomacy and bureaucracy.
‘Your Muggle family were bloody appalling, Harry,’ Draco points out. ‘You didn’t have to stay with people who didn’t want you. There were plenty of people who were willing to take care of you. Lupin. Hagrid. Hell, even Severus would have been a better option.’
and shoves energy bars into Harry’s pockets because he forgets to eat sometimes when he’s overstimulated.
It doesn’t make sense, though. He quit. He stopped doing stupid, reckless things, stopped overworking, and putting himself in dangerous situations. He’s got his Anchors and he’s got Daphne and he doesn’t blow anything up anymore.
‘Nothing,’ Harry says. ‘Nothing in Brussels, nothing in Paris. No one’s seen or heard from Draco in over a week, and there’s no sign of a struggle, no trace magic anywhere. And in my experience, there’s always
Draco’s propped up against the pillows, coloured in with ash and bone, but his eyes are open, and they are as bright as the universe's worth of stars.
‘You might have a warrant for an arrest, Elmer Smythe,’ Astoria says, each word a barbed sting into the Auror’s side, ‘but I see no evidence of a warrant to search for the symbol of ownership of the Elder Wand. Because that is what you’re really looking for, isn’t it? Ownership of Harry’s wand means ownership of the Deathly Hallow’
from his Auror days. ‘Yeah, same one.’
Harry suddenly knows, with horrifying certainty, that all those failed dates and awful lovers don’t even matter, because he’ll never fall in love with anyone else. But he can’t say it. He just doesn’t know how to put those words into motion, not when he doesn’t know if he deserves it yet.
‘You aren’t something to be put up with, Harry,’ Draco says. ‘And even if you are a little fucked up, you still deserve to be loved.’
. ‘There is a Muggle saying about power and its corrupting effects, I believe,’ he says.
,’ the Auror says. ‘It’s urgent.’
Harry wishes he was a little less sober. He’s standing in line to get into a Muggle nightclub with a pack of pureblood Slytherins, who are wearing Muggle clothes and talking excitedly about Muggle things, and it’s just so fucking
Draco makes that sound again, half sigh, half laugh, and he presses his lips to Harry’s.
(Some nights, even here, where the sweetest memories are drained from every last prisoner, Harry still dreams of a ballroom full of flowers. In those dreams, he dances in the circle of Draco’s arms, spinning and spinning and spinning until the world turns into a ring box filled with tiny chocolates. When he wakes after those dreams, Harry stands by his cell window and yearns for a warm smile and glittering, silver eyes.)
Draco’s smile is the bite of a midwinter wind. ‘Another coincidence?’ he says, his voice soft and sweetly mocking. ‘Ah, of course. I’m sure you’re right, Auror Proudfoot.’
‘I’ve been betrayed,’ Ron exclaims. ‘
Neville laughs at Harry’s expression. ‘Anyhow,’ he says brightly, folding his arms over his chest. ‘Harry, you know how Agatha Burns has always been a little excited about the grindylows?’
‘Granger,’ Pansy continues, turning to glare at Hermione, who drops a half-peeled satsuma in shock. ‘The whole fake story about you and Potter dating, and also the racism. That was all very wrong. I am sorry. Not that it’s an excuse, but apparently being an extremely closeted rug-muncher will make you do extremely stupid and aggressive things to girls you’re attracted to. Again, sorry about that. Also congratulations on the nuptials. Your children will be very attractive, I’m sure.’
‘Yes,’ Harry frowns. ‘To share with Teddy. Don’t change the topic. Why didn’t you just tell me what it meant?’
Auror Smythe comes to a complete stop in front of Harry. He lifts his wand and points it directly at Harry’s chest. Draco gasps in Harry’s ear at the blatant threat, but Harry’s spent enough years having curses flung at his head. He stares steadily at Smythe, keeping himself placed solidly in front of Draco just in case the young Auror gets any funny ideas.
He sits and watches Potter devour his cursed creation, listens as Potter reels off his latest strategy for weaving Grimmauld Place’s network of protective spells back together. He is viciously smart, and he has a talent for spells and charms that puts even Granger to shame. Draco suspects that many people underestimate Potter’s intelligence simply because he has the attention span of a rabid squirrel and a level of obliviousness that is physically painful to witness.
, Harry wants it. He’s always wanted it. This desire planted its seeds in him that Christmas after their first kiss, and he has a superbloom of stars in his lungs to prove it. He is
‘But,’ Angel continues, holding up a hand, ‘as American wizards operating a business registered under MACUSA, American wizarding laws apply to us.’
So he rolls up his sleeves, one by one, leans forward close enough to smell the detergent on Draco’s hospital gown, picks up Draco’s hand and sets it against the overlapping black curves of Harry’s Anchors.
Silence falls suddenly upon the room, its weight nearly tangible.
Harry smiles wryly, forgetting his own embarrassment for a second. Hermione is a force of nature on a normal day, but when she gets locked onto a cause - well.
be seen by any child.
‘Sure,’ Harry says out loud, because he’s messed up once already.
Harry’s jaw drops. ‘As in, fucked Oliver Wood into a three-day stupor, Blaise?’ he utters. ‘What - why didn’t I recognize him?’
‘Um.’ He’s not really been counting. ‘Maybe?’
‘How will they look at me and not see
but respond with something scathing. The tragedy of it is that he is forced to look upon the object of his desires, and once he looks, he cannot bring himself to stop.
him,’ she grits out.
‘I love you so much,’ confesses Harry, and kisses Draco on the cheek.
‘Aren’t you supposed to be at your apprenticeship?’ Draco asks, pushing himself up.
Harry lifts his shoulder in a half-shrug. ‘It was just some personal research,’ he says. ‘Nothing official.’
However terrible you think that racy drawing of Draco is, amp it up by a hundred. Now impose that on interviews of celebrities being forced to look at thirsty fanart.
Draco’s face, already so pale, turns nearly bone-white. He presses his clenched fist against his mouth, his eyes wandering towards the fire as his expression turns hunted. ‘I can’t say I’m surprised,’ he says softly. ‘My father usually gets what he wants.’
The forensic wizard takes a deep breath, then reels them off as quickly as he can. Even then, it takes him several minutes to go through them all. The Wizengamot requires another recess as a member of the audience is violently sick over the side of the gallery.
Blaise’s responding glare could cover the Sahara in frost. Before he can open his mouth to deliver a scathing remark, however, the hearth flares brilliant green, and Stephen Liu ducks out from beneath the mantle. Astoria follows not long after, her long hair pinned up out of her face in a low bun. She looks tired, her mouth tugging down at the corners as she dusts the soot off the hem of her robes.
Harry creates a private loop between his hearth and Draco’s. It isn’t the first time that someone has attempted an International Floo, and Harry’s work builds on years and years of experience, but in the end, he is the first one who succeeds in setting up. This way, they don’t have to wait for an international portkey or to take the Eurostar. On school holidays, Harry goes the other way, and spends his time at Draco’s flat above the chocolaterie pretending he’s living life as a man of leisure.
‘Then
They’re on break in the alleyway next to Fortescue’s, halfway through a sweep of Diagon Alley. It hasn’t snowed yet today, but the air is viciously cold. The Aurors received a lead last week that there might be another attack - but they’ve had as many false leads as good ones, and this chase has gone on for years now.
Harry slips away to the kitchen to make tea. They deserve some privacy. Harry fetches Draco’s favourite brand of Earl Grey from within the cabinet and thinks of the way Pansy cried on the street in front of Narcissa’s apartment, and he has to take a deep breath to steady himself. He doesn’t want to think about what might have happened if he’d been a few days later in unlocking the panic room - or if he’d never found it at all. If he’d never found Draco.
(Harry complaining about getting approvals for George to join a task force
Hermione smacks him on the shoulder with no small amount of force. ‘Ronald!’
Eventually Neville stumbles across him on a late autumn night, just before the cusp of winter. He moves to stand next to Harry, about a foot away, and he squints as he peers up at the night sky and its plethora of planets and stars.
‘I do recall peripheral vision being part of the average wizard’s biology,’ he sighs, when a witch happened to figure out Harry’s blind spot and used it to nearly incinerate his arm. ‘Congratulations on evolving out of such primitive things.’
‘Of course,’ Draco laughs, a little watery, and extends his arms. ‘There’s no one else I would pick, love.’
Harry bristles at the insult. ‘Christ. Merlin.’ He stands up and shoves Malfoy’s wand back at him. ‘I’m just trying to be nice,’ he snaps.
Harry feels like he’s in the middle of a very frightening, very confusing training programme and his fight-or-flight response is about to kick in. ‘Um. Apology accepted?’
while Draco reshelves the non-fiction section. His hair is almost too-long, falling into his eyes as he worries his bottom lip with his teeth.
Not that Harry’s complaining. Teddy’s treacle tart is sublime.
‘How may we help you?’ asks the short-haired man.
‘Oh,’ says Neville. ‘Well. I just thought maybe, with everything that happened-’ He sighs heavily, cutting himself off with a broad sweep of his hand. ‘I thought maybe you’d want to get as far away from England as possible. And, honestly, if you did - I wouldn’t blame you.’
Blaise grins. ‘Brilliant.’ He launches into a story about a plague of metallic beetles attacking his stepfather’s vineyard, and the man’s belief that it’s all a conspiracy by his competitors to ruin his business.
It’s become a comfort, a phantom hand pressed on the small of his back, an invisible embrace that shields him from the onslaught of the world’s pinprick-sharp magic. He learned, over time, how to adjust the intensity of the magical signature and make it a filter instead of a shield. It allowed him to pick up on spells and curses than the average Auror wouldn’t even notice - and it made him one of the best trackers on the force.
He does not know how to be good. He does not know how to be kind. No one has ever taught him how.
Harry grins. He loves Taco Tuesday.
Blaise, from his nonplussed expression, clearly never had to endure the banality of having to colour in a poorly-photocopied flow chart of cartoon droplets falling from clouds into a cartoon ocean.
‘You romantic buffoon,’ Draco says, sweet and quiet, but he doesn’t shake Harry’s hand off.
‘You don’t do sleepovers,’ Harry says brightly, earning himself a poisonous look. ‘You gave me a very tight timeline, Blaise, so sit your pretty arse down and cooperate.’
He wants to sit here, in this coffee shop with its sticky tables and terrible lighting, and he wants to look at Malfoy. Malfoy, who cracks jokes about death and torture, who likes to drink chai lattes and works in a Muggle bookshop, who dresses in loose sweaters and rolls his jeans up at the cuffs, who is soft and strange and new and hopeful.
Draco’s white-blond hair is clumpy and matted, and Draco’s breathing rattles in his chest as the blood froths at his lips, but somehow it’s Harry who is falling apart, like
‘Daphne,’ Draco says warningly.
(Harry’s stony anger as he says,
Proudfoot sighs again, heavily, and turns on his heels, facing Harry properly for the first time since he walked into the Great Hall. ‘I’ll give it to you straight, Potter,’ the senior Auror says. ‘Malfoy’s gone missing, and we’re pretty sure he’s up to something.’
Coming up next: Daphne-f**ng-Greengrass; playing fast and loose with Potterverse rules of magic; fluff; angst; Auror-bashing.
This time when Harry drops by Narcissa’s apartment, he brings lilies and a bottle of pastis. Narcissa frowns at the lilies, but visibly brightens as she catches sight of the liquor.
‘No,’ Harry frowns. ‘For
Draco nods. He ducks his head under Harry’s chin, his fingers curling between their bodies as Harry pulls him in close. He smells of soft mornings and Harry’s favourite coffee, this precious thing between them that is too new, too fragile.
Draco stares at him. ‘No, Potter,’ he says, resisting the urge to flick the other man in the forehead. ‘That is not how potions work.’
. Not after everything.
They’ve never really talked about it, not properly. Neither of them is very good at sitting down and talking about their emotions with each other, Mind-Healer or no, but they are rather excellent at understanding each other on some bizarre, subliminal level. Ron probably knew about Draco even before Harry did.
‘Keep this for me,’ he mutters urgently. ‘Don’t let anyone else have it. Don’t let them know you have it.’
Harry’s gut roils. He wipes his mouth, tears stinging at his eyes. ‘I can’t… I can’t tell you, Pansy.’
‘Really,’ Harry laughs. ‘I spoke to Michelle, I even met Acquafredda to look through your ledgers. That’s how I found the Lopez brothers and figured out that you’d installed the panic room in Narcissa’s apartment.’
Harry shakes his head. ‘I’m at the week’s limit for potions,’ he replies. ‘The sugar should help me. I think.’
‘Right, I’ve got bad news,’ Hermione announces, shoving the hamper at Harry. ‘I dropped by the Burrow to pick up food from Molly and ran into Percy and - oh,’ she says, cutting herself off. Her eyes widen as she takes in the other visitor. ‘Blaise Zabini, right? Slytherin? Are you visiting Draco?’
Later on, after Teddy and Andromeda have called it a night, Harry and Draco have mulled wine out in the garden and watch the snow drift down, feather-like. Draco steps close and leans his head on Harry’s shoulder.
Draco rolls over onto his back. His fringe falls away from his forehead, revealing the nearly-elfin planes of his face and the silver of his eyes. He frowns deeply as he looks up at Harry.
- but this time it’s more of a cologne smell than his usual faint perfume of mint, lemon and cedarwood. Draco’s not really keeping with whatever theme the Slytherins have going on, but he does look good -
Harry does love it in Ghent. He loves Draco’s apartment, because it’s just so
‘For you,’ Harry says again.
‘Harry,’ says Neville, staring at him pointedly. ‘You should see the way you look at him. You should see the way he looks at
Hermione rubs her hand over her eyes. ‘Ron’s taken the kids to stay at the Burrow,’ she replies. ‘A couple of people are coming over later to… to figure our next steps. I don’t want them to- I just want them somewhere safe.’
‘You are handsome, and clever, and despite perhaps being the most powerful wizard of our generation, you are humble, and you never look down on anyone. You save people, every day, and you never once ask for any thanks for it.’
‘He placed the knife here,’ she says, setting the tip of her nail against the soft, vulnerable place at her throat. ‘I was not afraid to die. But my son would not listen.’
Draco nods. ‘Duly noted.’
‘Have you heard from him recently?’ Proudfoot presses.
Blaise glances at Draco quizzically for confirmation, and Draco nods in affirmation.
‘Potter, you’re being incoherent,’ says Blaise.
phone,’ corrects Harry, wondering how Ginny’s managed to make it through this many years with Hermione as her sister-in-law with this sort of vocabulary.
‘He’s required to wear a very advanced cosmetic charm for work,’ Pansy explains, waving a manicured hand dismissively. ‘Anyways, enough about Blaise.’ She leans in close, narrowing her eyes. ‘Did you notice something odd about Narcissa?’
Pansy’s eyes flash in recognition, and she grins slowly. ‘That sly bastard,’ she says, shaking her head. ‘That was Blaise, Potter. As in, Blaise Zabini, procurer of the fancy champagne we always have for Draco’s birthday.’
The stars that hang in the sky above them are vast in number, incomprehensibly so, and each time Harry glances up at them in search of some kind of answer, some kind of direction, they just spin out above him in kaleidoscopic fashion until he is nauseous from the momentum.
Malfoy laughs, or at least, tries to. The sound is a hollow, jarring thing. ‘Circe, Potter,’ he says, his eyes too wide, too dark. ‘Didn’t you know? It’s all part and parcel of serving our Dark Lord. Torture and death. Death and torture. ’ He leans his head back, falling into the shadows beneath the sink, and he stares at Harry with those too-wide eyes. ‘I think I’ve had enough of the torture bit.’
. One month ago, all he had were memories and an aching, a longing. But here, in the dark, he can see their past and their future stretching out to either side, endless and wonderful - and it is almost
‘Oh, no,’ he says.
‘It’s always a little dark before the dawn,’ she whispers to him, her palm pressed firmly against the centre of his back.
Harry fetches the stemless glasses from one of the cabinets and pours the Merlot. Draco prefers white wine, but he always buys them red when Harry comes over, the same way he always makes Harry’s favourite things for dinner. They move out into the living room and sit on the sofa, Draco curling his bare feet beneath him while Harry lifts his feet up onto the footrest. They talk for a while, Draco rambling on at length about a new potion he’s developed that keeps hair tangle-free for weeks. He’s particularly proud of creating solutions to innocuous, everyday problems - it's what makes him different from every other Apothecary.
Stephen Liu was buying a bouquet off the side of Central Park for his sick aunt, and Astoria was looking for a collection of white roses to decorate her brand-new apartment, and they both recognized their school pins. Stephen’s was fastened to the lapel of his suit, and Astoria wore hers at her throat. They had a moment of solidarity over a cup of coffee, Stephen’s lilies laid out on the park bench in a wrapping of old newspapers. Apparently, Stephen had been sent abroad to Ilvermony as an attempt by his family to learn how to do better business with the Westerners - a suitable task for a second son. Astoria, too, knew what it was like being second child, second fiddle, in the shadow of her brilliant, wonderful sister. And she knew what it was like to be lonely, isolated from things familiar and comforting - having spent three years of her youth chained to a sickbed.
‘May I kiss you?’
‘I’m sorry I’ve been such a twat,’ Harry says. ‘I get so stuck in my head sometimes. It’s not an excuse, but.’ He sighs, leaning his elbows against the railing. ‘I’m sorry.’
Draco lives because a boy with eyes like spellfire grabbed him by the wrist and mistakenly thought him worth saving.
Malfoy looks away. ‘Don’t worry, Potter,’ he says, so quiet Harry almost misses it. ‘I don’t have anywhere to go anyways.’
Neville’s family were never truly quite as well-off as the Malfoys or the Blacks, but they were comfortable enough to buy an Unplottable space of land in Wales where neither the National Trust nor the seasonal tourists would stumble across them. It’s a lovely little cottage for a young couple, but Ginny assures Harry that it’s fitted with the right charms if it ever needs space for more -
And then he
at the owner before heading through a door marked STAFF ONLY and hurrying up the back stairs.
‘No, no you don’t,’ Hermione yells, descending upon them like a storm of righteous fury.
Maybe you have to round up Death Eater after Death Eater until they’re all locked up in Azkaban. Maybe you have to reinvent magical tracking, or maybe pioneer a new system for infiltrating Death Eater safehouses. Maybe you learn Cursebreaking overnight when the Ministry budget won’t stretch to give you that extra bit of help that, quite frankly, should be in the fucking budget, but we’re not counting straws here, it’s fine. Maybe you have a few harrowing near-misses with death and collect so many scars that you forget how many you have.
Draco’s fingers trace slow circles over Harry’s Anchors, then trail down to his wrists, to his hands, where he interlaces their fingers and holds tight.
‘She’s fine,’ Daphne interrupts, firmly but not unkindly.
Sometimes it bleeds like an open wound.
‘What are you really doing in Paris, Potter?’ Pansy asks, when they’ve finally managed to escape Narcissa’s apartment.
Draco smiles at his perfect, wonderful nephew. ‘Normal is fine,’ he says, and picks up his quill.
I miss Europe, can you tell?
‘Please,’ Draco sighs.
‘You weren’t a twat, Harry,’ she says. ‘
. God, the only reason I could be so
Harry gets a tip about the raid as soon as he gets back into the Ministry. He’s had a long, horrible day of counting corpses at yet another bombing -
Harry sorts through reports and papers and notes and records and long-form analyses, searching instead for the thin trail that will show him not
Normal people don’t get headaches from background magic. Harry’s supposed to be normal. He's supposed to be working on becoming normal. That’s why he goes to Healers and lets them poke and prod him and give him potions to take, even if they make him nauseous and jittery.
‘She said it wasn’t my fault we broke up,’ Harry mumbles, staring down his fifth glass of extremely nice goblin wine. ‘But it was.’
Astoria looks on the verge of flinging curses, but her husband steps in quickly.
Harry’s head snaps up. He recognises that name from long, mind-numbing nights chasing paper trails through endless records and receipts.
The body count makes Harry sick.
‘When are you headed to Brussels, then?’ Neville asks, turning towards Harry.
He takes a breath and releases it slowly through his nose. ‘How do you and Ginny figure out the long-distance thing?’ he asks.
Static prickles at the back of Harry’s neck and crawls all the way down his spine, where it makes his gut twist painfully. He eyes every corner, every opening of the Great Hall, and it’s all the same as it’s always been, safe and warm and full of fond memories - but something is coming up the hill on the winds of the storm and Harry can taste it behind his teeth.
One attack leaves him covered in harrowing scars down the back of his skull and neck. The wounds make even the Healers blanch, but Draco looks Harry straight in the eye, insults his hospital buzzcut and hands him a hair-growing potion.
her then.
Harry feels a sickening lurch in his stomach. He sits up and braces his palms on his knees, breathing deeply until his ribs creak with the effort.
alright, Harry?’ Teddy asks.
Harry swore he wasn’t going to cry at his own sodding wedding, but now Hermione is handing him a tissue and Ron is thumping his back and saying,
Teddy cries so hard he nearly drops the rings, but Hugo lunges for them in time and gets mud all over his trousers. Rose spells Hugo’s suit clean and then kindly hands Teddy a tissue to wipe his face with -
to want Draco anymore.  Harry sighs heavily and pulls further away from Draco, trying to ignore the magnetic drag of his desire.
There are tiny, scabbed-over scratches lining his wrists and forearms, likely from having baby dragons crawl all over him. Harry’s seen the same marks on Charlie’s arms and wonders if Teddy will also collect his own archive of scars, and if perhaps there’s no real way to keep your most precious loved ones from harm, only ways to worry after them.
Harry turns to frown at Malfoy. ‘Did you call me Harry?’
,’ Harry retorts good-naturedly. ‘You’d want to get sloshed too if you were forced to work with Robards.’
) and normally it should make him irritated or flustered or even a little amused, but right now it is a sick, cold stone sitting in his stomach, because despite everything, after this is done, Draco will go back to Belgium, and Harry will return to Hogwarts and his grindylow-loving students, and somehow Harry had forgotten all of that.
Harry’s head swims with relief.
‘You’re better at fame than I was,’ Harry tells him.
Then his eyes roll back in their sockets and he goes limp.
Draco lies in bed and does not, in fact, listen to his programs. Instead, he watches through the open door as the man he loves (unrequitedly) moves through his kitchen with careless familiarity. He listens to the kettle boiling on the hob, to the tiny curses that Harry utters as he burns his fingertips on something hot. He clutches the blankets tighter around himself and imagines walking up behind Harry, imagines burying his face in the nape of that neck, of letting himself soak up all that hot-water-bottle warmth from Harry’s cologne-scented skin. He imagines settling his hands on Harry’s stomach, and lets himself think of the way they would sway together in gentle tandem.
‘Yes. No. What I mean is,’ Harry says, feeling frustration bubble up in his chest to sting in his mouth, ‘yes. It has to be compatible for it to work, but there’s more. I’m sorry. I’m trying to explain,’ he sighs.
Everyone heads home at around ten, and Kreacher chases them out of the dining room before Harry and Draco can make an attempt at cleaning up. They end up sitting together on the sofa in front of the fire, leaning against each other as the night deepens.
The Greengrasses, it seems, hearken to a tradition older than even the stilted customs of the self-proclaimed pure-bloods. The wreaths that hang at each entryway sing with a magic that is wild and delightful and
‘Imagine if they’d got along in school,’ Ron says to Harry, nodding at the two of them whirling around the dance floor.
‘You’re going to regret this,’ Robards tells him with what is probably meant to sound like concern but ends up sounding patronising.
‘It’s in the oven,’ Draco says. ‘Pour me a glass of that,’ he says, indicating the open bottle of wine sitting on the kitchen table, ‘and we can go sit in the lounge while we wait.’
‘Minister,’ Draco says crisply. ‘I believe we had an agreement?’ He dips his head pointedly towards Harry.
Hermione taught Harry the diagnostic spells a while ago. The twitching is only one of the side effects of curse damage. If Malfoy is having a bad day, he can end up passing out - as Harry had to witness one particular evening playing with Teddy in the garden. Malfoy was fine one minute, then flat on his back the next.
‘Work faster,’ she orders. She slips her feet off his lap and heads over to the stove, pouring a frightening amount of coffee liquor into the pot. ‘This shit is too weird to mull over sober.’
Draco sniffles - he’s definitely crying.
The sky rumbles threateningly as the golden afternoon begins to fall into grey, dark clouds crowning over the sun. A balmy breeze sweeps in through the half-open windows of the greenhouse, bringing with it the scent of far-off rain. On the table, balanced precariously on a stack of upturned terracotta pots, the radio scratches out a belated warning of the oncoming storm. The first droplets of rain fall heavy upon the glass ceiling.
‘You’re working,’ Draco says, dropping his gaze pointedly to the papers piled up on the table.
,’ he whispers. ‘I’ve got you. You’re safe. I have you.
He clears away the little table on the balcony and takes his things back inside just as the first droplets start hitting the floor. There is still half a cabinet’s worth of files to root through. Harry knows they will be just as unhelpful as the first half, but he has to try.
‘Darling,’ Blaise greets.
There is so much blood. The floor is wet with it, the rug stained so dark it looks almost black, and Harry’s knees slip in it as he scrambles to his knees. He gathers Draco in his arms.
What the hell is that supposed to mean anyways? What could Ginny possibly be unhappy about? He’s worked hard for this position. He stuck through three years of training, of being yelled at and sneered at and learning how to wandlessly conjure fire in a fucking swamp being devoured by gnats, but hey, it’s all fine to just up and quit something he’s finally good at, right? Is he supposed to be playing Quidditch because it’s what
Harry nods. ‘I’ll be quick, then,’ he says. ‘Have you got any of the accounts for the Malfoy estate? Draco always keeps records - he’s obsessed with book-keeping.’
Hermione is the first of their friends to arrive. She drops by at seven in the morning on her way into work, bringing a coffee and pastry for Harry. He touches neither, transfixed by Draco’s quietness, his absolute stillness. He can feel the monitoring spells hovering above Draco, clicking away like the tiny gears of a hundred clocks.
‘I am a Black,’ Draco says. ‘This is the only way we know how to love.’
Neville smiles. ‘I think Malfoy’s pretty happy to let you use you as a crutch, Harry,’ he replies steadily.
‘Now I understand Icarus’s folly,’ he whispers into the crook of Harry’s neck. ‘I, too, would set myself aflame, singe my skin with molten wax and burnt feathers, to kiss but one divot -’ his hand sweeps down, fingers splaying possessively at the small of Harry’s back - ‘here at the base of your spine.’
‘What the bloody hell is
‘It’s alright,’ Draco murmurs. ‘Save your strength, love.’
‘Three litres of blood,’ he responds, when Hermione asks him how much blood he found in the panic room. He looks mildly nauseous, then, and adds, ‘There was more in the bathroom. Six litres, total.’
‘Meaning,’ Guy interjects with a broad grin, ‘for the purposes of cooperating with official instructions, we
Proudfoot frowns deeply. ‘We’re not accusing you of anything, Potter.’
Harry’s eyes widen as a jolt of realization strikes through him.
- and Molly makes Draco swear on his life that they will not have a winter wedding, or she’ll never knit him a Christmas sweater again. Fleur pours out champagne for everyone and they have a civilised little toast about it, and Hugo quietly informs everyone that he’d like to be the ring boy, please, if everyone’s alright with that, and Draco looks like he might cry a little.
Harry’s so happy for him. He’s sad, sure, but he’s also so happy it makes his heart ache in a nice, glowy kind of way. Ron deserves a life with his family. He deserves to go home at a reasonable time, to play with his kids and know that he’ll be around to watch them grow up. Harry won’t have to carry Dittany around so much anymore, now that he knows Ron’s safe.
is. He watches as a couple go spinning swiftly them, and is reminded of the rides at Alton Towers, and watching Teddy and Draco go round and round and round in contraptions of steel and rubber.
He loves Potter. He loves him and will always love him, even after death, even after they have both become ashes and atoms floating in the great expanse of the quiet universe.
He leans into the gentle hand pressed against the small of his back, humming happily as it slides over to his waist and pulls him close. Draco has gained most of the weight back, under Healer Thompson’s strict potion regimen. He is a solid, warm presence at Harry’s side, his magic a sanctuary amidst so many wand-users.
One of the members of the Wizengamot clears his throat, leaning forwards in his seat.
Things used to be awkward with Neville, when Harry first started working at Hogwarts. Neville was everything Harry had hoped he’d become: he was calm, reliable, stupidly handsome, and everyone liked him. Neville didn’t look like he woke up in the middle of the night sweating, trembling from vivid nightmares. Neville didn’t snap at people at the slightest provocation. And Neville was the one engaged to Ginny - and poor, lonely Harry Potter couldn’t even make it to the third date with someone before they went straight to the Prophet and spilled everything for a measly handful of Galleons.
,’ Lucius spits at the Unspeakable.
Harry whips his head around, staring at the Unspeakable. The man stands by the door with his hands tucked into his pockets, watching Harry with an unreadable expression.
Draco has some ice cream in the freezer, saved precisely for days like this, because he knows that Potter loves dunking a scoop of vanilla into his chai like an absolute
‘That’s because I’m not a hormonal teenager with an anger management problem,’ Draco replies with all of his usual snark and none of his bite. ‘And I’ve learned quite a deal of patience over the years, putting up with you.’
Harry knows the person Draco was. He knows the snot-nosed brat -
Harry climbs into bed, takes off his glasses, folding them as he places them on the bedside drawer, and extinguishes the lights with a wave of his hand. He turns over in bed so they can lie together in the dark. Beyond the translucent fall of the curtains, the moon is a butter-white disc in the sky. Draco’s fingertips are icy as they settle possessively over Harry’s forearms.
, the letter said - but Harry likes to cast a wide net before he starts following any leads properly.
‘Yeah,’ Harry says. He gets up, brushing off his jeans carefully. ‘Draco’s got a Slytherin reunion at some vegan restaurant in Soho.’
Harry stumbles across the room, relief cutting him at the knees and sending him careening into Draco, pulling him up into Harry’s arms as he buries his face into Draco’s shoulder, and even if Draco doesn’t smell like himself (bleach and magic and cotton and detergent and sleep) his magic murmurs beneath his skin in perfect tandem with the marks on Harry’s arms.
But Harry is so fucking happy anyways. He spends every minute so happy he doesn’t know where to put it all, so one evening he drinks a whole bottle of wine and cries into Draco’s shoulder because he’s just so overwhelmed with how he’s allowed to be happy now.
‘You interrupt me another time and I’ll hex your balls off,’ Harry says, pointing at Draco’s irritably handsome face.
He’s read the Auror reports three times. Unspeakable Zabini owled them directly to him after their meeting in Harry’s classroom. The leads are solid - Lucius
‘You look good,’ Harry says, because he really does.
Harry arches an eyebrow in reply. ‘Isn’t this what the Department of Mysteries hired me for?’
‘I’m afraid, Mr. Potter, that I cannot answer any of your questions directly concerning Lucius Malfoy.’ Marsters tears apart the third packet of sugar and pours it into his coffee. ‘There are certain magical contracts in place that prevent me from talking about the facts of the case, and anything else written down on the protected documents. I can’t tell you what Lucius was doing, the people he was involved with, or any of the schemes he had planned.’
Harry holds out his hands and lets the ledger fall into his palms. He gives its contents a brief once-over. The writing is printed by typewriter instead of by hand, each section organized chronologically and then alphabetically. It will be hard work, of course, given Harry’s shortcomings with numbers, but an organized ledger shaves off hours -
‘We signed Hilda today!’ she crows, pumping her fists into the air.
, he’s also six-foot-three and horrifically intimidating. Harry decides he can probably let protocol slip this once, seeing as it’s, well, Ron.
, Harry thinks, and shudders.
Neville chuckles. ‘Gosh, Harry,’ he says, slapping his hands down on the tops of his thighs. ‘Do you really want my advice on how to write saucy letters to your hot new fiancé?’
Harry strides over to him and digs the bar of chocolate out of his pocket. It’s Muggle, bought in a hurry at an off-licence as an afterthought for Ron to try out. He never thought he’d be handing one over to Draco sodding Malfoy, of all people.
There is still half a cabinet’s worth of files to root through. Harry knows they will be just as unhelpful as the first half, but he has to try.
‘Harry,’ Neville says heavily. ‘You’ve got to stop beating yourself up about this. You went through a lot.’
Draco’s expression is a wreck of grief and pain as the Aurors cast horrible, invasive searching spells on Harry’s body. He shouldn't have to see this, shouldn’t have to watch. Harry tries to breathe through it, tries to sink down and focus on the Anchors. Their magic
Blaise rises from his seat and offers a wide, too-perfect smile. ‘Lovely to meet you again, Mrs Granger-Weasley.’ He nods at Draco. ‘I should be going,’ he says, tilting his head towards the fireplace.
Pansy mutters darkly into her tea about
‘You can’t flirt your way out of every argument,’ Harry laughs, pulling Draco close. He slings his arms around the other man’s hips, interlacing his fingers and resting his hands against the small of Draco’s back.
‘This is a lot to process,’ he says at last.
Harry’s not sure if he wants to scream, laugh, or cry. ‘Merlin.
‘I don’t have a saviour complex,’ Harry complains, catching Draco’s wrist.
Harry will never tell him whose magical signature he chose. That would be too much like a confession, and Harry’s not quite sure he’s ready for that.
Harry chews on his lip. ‘Can you stop?’ he asks.
Harry thinks about Marie’s face, blotchy with a month’s worth of tears, and Prentis’s desk, empty but for a vase of wilting flowers, and the memorial they’re building out in the ruins of Diagon Alley. He thinks of Draco’s hand wrapped tightly around his, the overly clean smell of the intensive care ward. He thinks of the other people lying in the beds of St. Mungo’s, the families crowded in the hallways, too exhausted for tears. He thinks about the ones who didn’t wake up. The ones who didn’t make it to the hospital at all.
Narcissa blinks, and nods slowly. ‘Well, Mr. Potter,’ she says, her voice soft and light. ‘You may as well come in. It’s a nice day for entertaining guests.’
,’ he whines.
It’s stupid. It’s impossible. He doesn’t even know if the Order will give Malfoy sanctuary - not with the Dark Mark twisting on his forearm, not with the people he’s tortured, possibly killed. He doesn’t know if they’ll even make it off the grounds of Malfoy Manor. But he’s so fucking tired of being the Boy Who Watches People Die.
On sleepless nights, Harry finds himself returning to the letter. He unfolds it carefully and reads it at the kitchen table by the light of his wand, so as not to wake Ginny. It is the thing that comforts him when he wakes, trembling and sweating, from his worst nightmares - when all he can hear is that cold laughter and his mother’s scream.
‘Tuesday next,’ Harry replies. He spots a tiny dandelion spore on his jeans. He picks it off carefully and blows it off the tip of his finger. ‘I think we’re going to spend maybe a week in Brussels sorting out some stuff and then we’ll head to Ostend to catch the last of the summer.’
‘If your employers have any issue with this,’ she says, ‘I will ensure that Robards is no longer welcome at any benefit, gala, or ball for the next five years. I’m sure the Head Auror would hate to endanger his public standing, so close to election season.’
The anti-Apparition wards press in on Harry’s awareness as his magic soars outward, looking for any exit, any crack in the barriers. There are none.
Michelle’s forehead wrinkles. ‘Ah, no,’ she replies with a slight shake of the head. ‘I do not have it. But it should be with the Paris lawyer.’
‘I’m here,’ Draco whispers. ‘I’m here. I’ve got you.’
Harry puts the hamper down as Hermione paces up and down in front of the fireplace, chewing her lip anxiously. She stops, whirling around on her heel, and drags one hand through her hair.
Healer Thompson’s eyebrows climb her face. ‘I see,’ she says, nodding slowly. ‘So you believe a twice-convicted Death Eater is a good enforcer of justice.’
Draco looks unconvinced but says nothing to argue against Harry. He presses his teeth into his lower lip, taking a deep breath as though to steady himself. Harry reaches over and takes his hand, squeezing it in what he hopes is quiet reassurance. Draco flashes him a grateful smile, and Blaise rolls his eyes again.
’ she says incredulously. ‘You’re Harry fucking Potter. You can Apparate along ley lines. You had such a high case rate when you were an Auror that you broke the record. And even if you weren’t Boy Wonder, Potter,’ she adds, shaking her head, ‘you two are locked in an orbit that not even the Dark Lord could break. You were made to find each other. To be together.’
Proudfoot sets the ledger down on the desk, his gaze transfixed on the numbers printed upon its pages. ‘Chimera’s Flame,’ he repeats, barely loud enough for Harry to hear him over the crackle of the fireplace. ‘That’s - that’s what they used in the Diagon bombing.’
Luna puts on another kettle. Ron holds Hermione tightly as she begins to cry, tears dragging black tracks of molten mascara down her cheeks, her shoulders shaking with wave after wave of shuddering sobs, a dam finally rupturing after being filled to the brink, and this is how Draco knows that these are the first tears she has shed since they took Harry away.
‘You can marry into a new family,’ Draco offers Blaise, a smirk creeping onto his face. ‘The Weasleys are a rather progressive bunch.’
There are no dark colours here. Everything is made of pale wood, and the walls are all painted a pastel teal, decorated with bright, colourful paintings of lush, tropical jungles. Narcissa shows Harry all the clever things her kitchen is capable of, the cooling-box hidden in her pantry, the extension charms that allow her to store a cellar’s worth of wines next to her spices, and the cockerel-shaped egg boiler that Draco custom-ordered from George.
‘Oh, stop,’ Michelle laughs. She purses her lips as she sweeps her gaze over him. ‘Ah, so handsome.’
So like, where's Draco?
‘It could have been a lot worse, I suppose,’ Draco says faintly. ‘He could have discovered us in a far more compromising position.’
Harry brings up his hand to press against his bare neck. Even without the aid of a mirror, he knows that the tattoo is gone. Relief shudders through him.
Draco turns ashen, scrambles to his feet, and Apparates away with a soft pop.
‘It’s Harry, Narcissa,’ he calls back. ‘Harry Potter.’
His address.’
Harry’s blood pounds in his ears. He hopes he’s wrong -
Draco lifts his head, and with practiced fluidity, Harry slots his arm beneath. Draco’s breath ghosts Harry’s collarbone.
‘Fine,’ Draco sniffs. ‘I might tell you. But only if you drink this champagne. It’s not spiked, promise. I have valiantly protected you from Wicked Weasley’s antics.’
Draco only smiles and drinks his martini. Harry hates and loves that smug smile in equal measures.
‘I know,’ Harry replies gently.
British Aurors too - but he’s still stopped by to see Draco before going home to his family. Harry feels a rush of affection for loyal, lion-hearted Ron.
When Draco passes out one day at work, he comes to with Mr. Blake crouched over him, attempting to call the ambulance on a mobile phone that he definitely does not know how to operate. Draco manages to convince him not to call emergency services after all, explaining that this happens all the time, that it’s the same problem he has with his hands shaking all the time.
The wizard who spoke out makes a choked noise and sits back down, his face ashen.
Malfoy scowls at the chocolate bar like it’s about to sprout three heads and hiss at him. ‘What is this?’
P.S. I thought I was going to do full-on explicit smut but then I started reading these chapters out loud to my sister and I just… I cannot. -_- I can’t.
Potter doesn’t jump at the explosion of sound. He laughs. He is a man used to flying several hundred feet in the air in the middle of thunderstorms and blizzards and all sorts of apocalyptic weather - a man who runs into the line of fire, not away from it.
‘The longer you go back,’ he explains, gesturing at the cards, ‘the more cards you have, and the more possibilities for patterns you have. But a normal Time-Turner can only handle so many possibilities. Less patterns. To travel through time, properly, you need all the cards
Draco’s breath catches in his throat. His love for Harry has deep roots, and he feels them reach further down towards his core as he looks into those lightning-green eyes, pinned down by the intensity of that unflinching gaze. ‘Why?’ he whispers.
A pair of extremely shiny, patent-leather shoes step in Harry’s vision.
‘Three against one, then,’ Harry sighs, scratching Artemis’s chin.
Daphne looks at him steadily. ‘I know,’ she says. ‘That is why I was worried about you.’
‘Oh, Merlin, here we go again,’ Ron says wearily. ‘George has an idea, Harry. Let’s go save him from it.’
And then there’s Sundays at Andromeda’s. The first time it’s an accident - Harry’s just leaving as Malfoy walks in the door - but after that it becomes a regular thing.
‘I visited your mother three times a week, every week,’ she continues, ‘and I didn’t have a clue that you were in there. I knew she was behaving weirdly - I knew she was trying to tell me something - I should have
‘Su-ure,’ she says, and when he glances at her she’s got a smarmy little smirk on her face.
, who sat with him beneath the moonlight, who smells like lemon and mint and cedarwood, who is the centre of Harry’s universe, the master of the gravity that pulls Harry back to shore, again and again, no matter how far out he drifts.
She lets him press a kiss into her cheek, her eyes crinkling as her face lights up with a wide, genuine smile. ‘Blaise,’ she says, looking him over as they draw apart. ‘You look well. I’m so pleased you came to see me. And with Mr. Potter, too.’
Draco shakes his head slowly. ‘Even if you’re good at locating magical signatures,’ he says, ‘mine would have been so faint it would have been barely recognizable.’
There is a polite knock on his door. Harry turns in time to see Neville popping his head through the door.
‘Are you always going to be this insufferable?’ Harry asks his boyfriend, as the teenage park attendant climbs up onto the barrier and starts ringing the bell with all the strength he can muster with his chopstick-thin arms.
‘Aw, congrats, Harry,’ Charlie grins. He wanders around the table and slaps Draco on the shoulder amicably. ‘You mess this up, Malfoy,’ he says, a dangerous glint in his eye, ‘and I’ll feed you to Norberta.’
‘Now this,’ says Draco, twisting his wrist in a movement akin to a conductor’s flourish, ‘is my favourite part.’
she says, but he doesn’t deserve anything.
Harry brings in an absolutely lavish breakfast with a steaming mug of mocha, and sets the tray down in the centre of Draco’s bed. He gently eases himself down onto the bed, toeing off his shoes and crossing his legs. He picks the mug up with his fingertips, twisting the handle in Draco’s direction so he can take the mug without burning himself.
Hermione.’
‘I did promise you, Draco,’ Harry says quietly. ‘The same promise you made me at the Manor.’
‘But- but I want that to be different from now on,’ Harry insists. ‘I’d look after you forever if you’d let me. Make you as happy as you deserve to be. Is that- would that be alright?’ he asks. He leans his weight onto the backs of his heels and clasps his hands behind his head, nervous enough to run a few laps around the property. ‘I know I’m a bit rubbish at it.’
‘A ring?’ Harry utters, his heart fluttering in his chest, but before he can say anything else, Ginny tackles him off his chair and onto the ground, the force of it sending his glasses flying off his face and skittering into the kitchen.
‘I work for the Unspeakables,’ Harry says dryly. ‘That seems pretty self-explanatory.’
‘No,’ Harry says firmly, shaking his head. ‘Draco, you’re perfect.’
Harry nods, all out of words, swaying into Draco just enough that he has to catch him by the waist. They wander off the dance floor, through a pair of open doors onto a curved balcony. The party is just starting, so all the other balconies are quiet and empty - and it is just them and the night.
‘Yeah,’ says Harry, softly. ‘Yeah, of course we are, Gin. Sorry I was a twat about it all for a while.’
‘Easier than breathing,’ he whispers, and Harry realises that he’s tired of running from what he wants.
From across the table, Andromeda smiles at her boys fondly. ‘I’ll go see if Teddy’s ready to wake up,’ she announces, and glides off into the other room.
Harry raises an eyebrow sardonically at his friend. ‘You’re taking the piss,’ he says. ‘I look like an under-budget uni student.’
Draco takes his uninvited desire and places it deep within him, in a place he will not have to look. He keeps his head down and tries to be worthy of Potter’s outburst.
A bulb goes off from the stalls as a reporter snaps the scene. The room is silent but for the swift scribbling of quills against parchment.
Harry watches Draco’s face, thin and pale against the pillows, his body an array of motionless ridges and bumps beneath the hospital sheets. He hasn’t slept, hasn’t eaten, hasn’t managed to move an inch from Draco’s side. He clings to the meagre comfort of tracking the rise and fall of Draco’s chest.
Smythe laughs incredulously. ‘Who do you think you are,’ he scoffs, ‘talking to an Auror like that?’
of Draco’s heart hammering into Harry’s own rib cage.
exactly,’ Daphne says. ‘Just different. I am curious, though. Harry, would you indulge me in something?’
‘What is it you want with me?’ Harry asks, irritation creeping into his voice.
She sprints towards the front of the alley. Harry draws his wand, conjuring up a Patronus to alert the others.
my son has MS.’
‘Piss off, Malfoy,’ Potter says fondly, and this time he slaps Draco’s leg with the flat of his hand. ‘Come on, I’m getting hungry.’
‘I honestly don’t think so,’ Neville replies. He pulls his legs back up, planting his feet firmly on the ground so that he can lean his elbows on his knees. ‘Dangerous creatures are just a part of the wizarding world. You can’t wrap children up in a safety net and hope that they’ll figure it out when they graduate. Besides,’ he adds, ‘we went through far worse when we were their age.’
‘You’re not rubbish at dancing,’ Draco corrects, taking another step back. Their arms are outstretched now, linked by their intertwined hands, and it will only take one more step for Harry to be pulled forwards. ‘You’re bad at leading.’
Eventually, Hermione and Draco wander over to them once they’ve tired of dancing. Hermione is tucked beneath Draco’s arm, her cheeks pinked, her hair fallen free of its sensible knot.  Hermione spills into Ron, laughing delightedly as she kicks off her heels and stretches out her legs in the grass. Draco follows suit, sitting behind Harry with his shins bracketing Harry’s thighs. He pulls Harry back to lean against his chest, and Harry tucks his head beneath Draco’s chin.
‘Of course.’ Harry’s never forgotten that night in the tall grass, the wildflowers swaying in the wind, the thrum of the ley lines deep beneath him, and the sweetwater whisper of Draco’s magic.
‘Yeah, I said the same to him,’ Ron nods. ‘It might’ve been a while since I was on the force, but I still know Ministry procedure. He can’t talk to you unless an Unspeakable gives him clearance, which I told him, except then he was stupid enough to put his foot in it and file his application with Blaise.’
I see your Anchors,’ Daphne informs him, which is as close to a compromise as she’s going to get. She raises her eyebrows and nods pointedly at his forearms.
‘You will hand me that volume this instance,’ Daphne demands, ‘or I will ban you from the Yuletide Wizarding War Orphans’ Benefit this Christmas.’
He was weak and tired the first day he was taken into the DMLE’s custody. They did not let him sleep. Instead, they kept him up and asked him pointless, leading questions, probed his body with spells that were only just this side of legal, drained him of his magic until he was down on his last reserves, and then branded his neck permanently with a row of numbers and letters that would mark him as a criminal. It leaves him with a sick, ugly feeling, a feeling of being robbed of something precious that he can’t identify.
Neville leans easily across the space between them and bumps his knuckles into Harry’s shoulder playfully. ‘Aw, piss off, you old sap,’ he says fondly. ‘Oh, speaking of significant others,’ he says, and jerks his chin towards the forest.
But Narcissa keeps asking him polite questions about his work at Hogwarts and how Teddy is doing, and if he must talk, he can’t zone in on the background magical traces. He clenches his left hand into a tight fist and wraps his other hand around it. It feels as though there’s an invisible band tightening around his torso, squashing his lungs until he can’t breathe.
Unbidden, a memory comes to Draco: an argument, witnessed in the cloakroom of a pub; Ginny’s cheeks reddened with frustration, Harry’s face an iron mask;
Harry hears Ron’s yelling before he sees him come charging in through the doorway of his hotel room.
‘Get off me,’ Harry says. His pulse beats an errant rhythm against his eardrums. He knows he’s safe, knows that it has been months since Diagon Alley, knows that he survived - but the memory clings to him, threatening to take over again.
‘Ew, no thanks,’ she laughs. ‘Keep your saucy letters to yourself, Harry Potter.’
,’ he repeats.
The hand on Harry’s waist is an anchor - a firm presence that pushes and pulls and guides him through the swift rhythm of the song. Harry is aware of the trip of their feet over the floor, aware of the giddiness of the ceiling as it whirls above them, aware of each sweep of the music as it rises and rises - and yet, at the same time, he is elsewhere, flying through autumn-chilled air, far above the Quidditch stands, above everything and everyone, tilting his broom in preparation for the nosedive after the glittering wings of the Snitch. Draco lifts their clasped hands and turns him, spinning him out and then drawing him back in, never once falling out of beat. Together they perform a different type of magic, one where Harry
‘Why is it always
While the more traditional members of the Liu family don’t subscribe to the description of
‘It’s called gallows humour,’ Malfoy sighed, passing Harry a napkin. ‘My therapist says it’s a coping mechanism.’
Harry pushes his unruly hair out of his face and tips his head skyward. ‘Ah, it’s a long story,’ he sighs, ‘and technically I can’t even tell you half of it.’
Harry’s not alone, and he is with family. He sits in front of the Christmas tree and watches fondly as Teddy rips apart everyone’s presents for them, because apparently none of them can do it fast enough, and tries not to laugh when Teddy places the ribbons in Draco’s hair and messes it up horribly, only then Draco glances over at Harry with a lopsided smile, and Harry can only stare at Draco and fall deeper and deeper.
(The smell of wet grass and broomstick wax, and,
‘What is it you want with me?’ Harry asks, irritation creeping into his voice.
Narcissa takes the stand first, as the only person witness to the whole kidnapping. She sets one hand on the railing while the other clenches around an embroidered kerchief in her lap. In her silver-and-eggshell robes and with her hair pinned neatly back, she looks the perfect aristocrat.
‘Harry,’ Draco sighs. ‘Oh, Harry.’ His fingertips press gently into the nape of Harry’s neck.
. Ginny huffs out an angry sigh and pulls a letter from her trouser pocket.
‘I’m going to murder the first person who attempts that,’ Daphne says calmly. It does not sound like an empty threat.
He understands now, of course, that there was never anyone else. That Draco never
Prentis is gone.
I’m not being cryptic, I promise. All will be revealed soon.
‘Are you asleep?’
Draco’s apartment sits right on top of a Muggle chocolaterie. Harry
‘Not to my recollection,’ Draco replies. ‘Funny,’ he adds with a frown. ‘I don’t recall having abs that defined.’
That is what love is, perhaps. To be overjoyed even as one is pulled apart.
‘Everyone has reasons, Harry,’ Draco says. ‘Let me put it this way. If it meant saving the world, would you take Teddy away from Aunt Andromeda? Would you give him to the Lestranges? Or maybe a Malfoy?’
‘Oh, sod off.’
‘So,’ says Guy. ‘How can we help you?’
’ Harry says, mimicking Robards’s gravelly, rolling tones. ‘
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco shakes his head in exasperation, but the corners of his mouth are tugging upwards into a smile. ‘Well, Daphne?’ he says, glancing at their old classmate. ‘Are you pleased with your experiment?’
Draco arches an eyebrow in mock disbelief.
‘Harry James Potter,’ she pronounces, attacking each syllable with perfect accuracy. ‘I have a bone to pick with you.’
Hermione chews anxiously on her lip. ‘I don’t like it,’ she whispers.
‘Per-fect,’ the Healer says again, giving the chart one last tap. She pulls a small token out of her pocket, squints at it, and the line between her brows deepens. ‘Right, I’ll leave you boys to it. Do let us know if there’s anything else we can get you to make you more comfortable, Mr. Malfoy,’ she adds, flashing a warm smile at Draco.
They have a bit of a family discussion about it after dinner, which quickly evolves into the Black family inquisition against helpless Potter. Draco’s been pushing for this since, well, forever, and Teddy’s delighted at the idea of having his extremely famous, ex-Auror godfather around all the time to impress his friends.
(See the end of the chapter for
Pansy’s eyes narrow almost imperceptibly. ‘Yes,’ she says. ‘I’m sure Potter thinks Draco is just the picture of saintly virtue.’
’ Proudfoot groans. ‘You can’t say what I think you’re saying. That’s got to be a coincidence.’
Hermione’s keen eye sees the notebook, the nondescript clothing, and then the stack of papers on Harry’s kitchen table - Harry can see the cogs in Hermione’s brain turning as the pieces slot into place.

‘He has to take me to dinner first!’ shouts Charlie from the bar, and Blaise trips over his own feet, careening into a nearby waiter and getting red wine all over his expensive suit.
Harry glances up at her. ‘But you cured her,’ he says softly. ‘You saved her.’
Harry shakes his head. ‘Not the way I get angry,’ he replies. ‘I’m better at cooling down usually, but it’s so loud in there with all the spells and it being a wizarding inn and all the wands and just-’ he breaks off, feeling stupid.
, whispers a voice in his head.
‘You haven’t modified them,’ Daphne notes, sounding pleased.
The next few chapters are going to take a lot of choreographing, and it’s going to get a lot more graphic/gruesome, so I might have to change my ratings/tags. Bear with me, I promise there is sweet sweet sweet fluff on the horizon. Also, in this house, we use Chekhov’s guns - still more juicy juicy plot to come.
She winks at him. ‘Only on Tuesdays and Fridays. Where’s your weekend bag then?’
‘And why is that a problem?’ Draco presses.
’ he growls. ‘Bloody fucking hell, Malfoy. I told you to stay alive.’ Harry glances up the stairs. ‘Come with us,’ he says.
‘Don’t test me, Boy Wonder,’ she threatens, jabbing at him with her teaspoon.
Fortunately, he doesn’t have to wait to find out, because Draco clears his throat loudly, drawing all the attention to him.
‘Christ-on-Merlin,’ Harry whistles. ‘I bet we would’ve gotten the whole defeating-Voldemort thing done in four years. Probably broken a lot less rules though,’ he adds, almost mournfully.
Harry rolls his eyes. ‘I’ll close these, shall I?’ he asks, jerking his thumb at the open windows. A light spray has begun to blow in through the glass windows as the wind picks up.
After Ron’s had an appropriate viewing of the hybrid nightmare of the plant and uttered a few choice cuss-words at the thing, they circle back up towards the house. Ron flops down beneath the old oak in Harry’s garden and leans back against its gnarled trunk. Harry pulls off his shoes and socks, rolls up his trouser-legs, and drops down on the earth next to Ron.
‘I never meant to let myself get so close to you,’ Draco says, like it’s a confession, and maybe it is, but the meaning of it keeps slipping through Harry’s fingers. ‘You are a landslide. A veritable annihilation. I put my very best efforts into behaving respectably, and yet when you are in my grasp I lose sight of my intentions and all I have left are my
Harry throws his hands up. ‘And what, Pansy?’ he snaps. ‘Are you trying to tell me that I’m going to find Draco because we’re magical soulmates or something?’
‘Am I to assume you slept through your mandatory potions training, Auror Potter?’ Draco asks, folding his arms over his chest. ‘Or must I provide you with a personal training session so that you don’t inadvertently kill yourself
‘Do you remember the night I first called you Harry?’ Draco asks.
He doesn’t mean to repeat Remus’s words, but they fall out of him anyways. It feels right somehow.
Harry uncrosses his legs and lowers his feet to the ground. He presses his palms against the arms of the deckchair, drumming his fingers against the painted wood. ‘I’m not abandoning my students, Nev,’ he says seriously. ‘And I’m not moving away from all my family and friends. I won’t give anything up. Not anymore.’
He makes a wheezing sound as he stares at the floor and wonders if this is what it’s like to have a panic attack.
A relieved smile flashes over Draco’s face - a devastating flash of teeth and the corners of his eyes crinkling just enough to make Harry’s heart flutter - before he schools his expression into a calm mask. He stands to his full height, brushing his hands down the front of his immaculate robes. This is neither the vibrant, jubilant creature that Harry knew in Belgium, nor the soft, midnight secret who lived within Harry’s bedroom walls, nor is it the cruel-faced boy with a mouthful of razor-sharp slurs and insults. This version of Draco is new to Harry - and yet there’s just
There really isn’t anything dangerous in his classroom at all. The walls are covered in large, colourful diagrams that shift and change according to the lesson, and most of the items he uses to teach his practical lessons are locked away in warded cabinets behind his desk. There is an enormous terrarium of grindylows at the back of the room, placed behind the last row of desks. His fourth-years take turns feeding them. Next year they’ll be released into the Great Lake and Harry will find a new classroom pet to study and take care of - usually chosen by a vote across his year groups. Despite his reputation, Harry is hardly the sort of reckless idiot who’d put children in needless danger.
does? Because it’s what she wants for him?
- and his heart breaks for the man he loves.
‘I was fine,’ Harry retorts, steadying the bowl in both hands.
Harry flips his hand over and slots his fingers between Draco’s. They fit perfectly together. ‘He’ll be staying with us,’ he clarifies.
Harry Apparates directly to the hotel, deciding to put off dinner until he’s had a good look at the rest of the ledger. The payments for the redecorations start a few years ago and are all paid for in installments, but last year there was a large amount of money being reshuffled in the Malfoy accounts that far exceeds even the most generous of budgets. Draco was preparing to commission something extremely expensive - something that was intended to keep his mother safe even in his absence. Something that would have been unknown to the rest of the world, just like the existence of this leather-bound volume.
Harry nods. ‘Dragons and mermaids. Aragog.
As Harry approaches, he realizes that the only similarity between the tall witch and Luna are their wardrobe choices. Her dark eyes are hawkish as she looks Harry over. He’s reminded, oddly enough, of McGonagall.
Vague mentions of violence, mentions of injuries and blood. You can skip the trial entirely and get to Weasley chaos at “According to Molly’s infinite wisdom…”
Draco’s smile slips out of his face and his gaze is more intense than looking directly into the sun. ‘I want to build a forever with you too,’ he says. ‘If that’s something you still want.’
‘Please stop apologising,’ Harry says, grabbing him by the wrist. ‘Think about the number of times
Harry’s about halfway through his patrol down Diagon Alley when he realises he’s out of Dittany. Ever since the Dartmouth incident, when Ron got hit on the arm with a severing curse mid-duel and nearly bled to death, Harry’s made it a point to keep some on his person at all times. He spots Goldren’s Potions ahead of him on his route, so he decides to drop in and restock.
He opens his eyes and looks at Blaise.
Harry has no idea what he was running towards. He was probably running
After the War, Harry went to Andromeda to tell her what had happened to Regulus. It hurt him to have to hurt her, but she deserved the truth - just as Regulus deserved someone other than Kreacher to mourn him. He deserved to be more than a name on a tapestry, more than a school picture of a solemn-faced boy posing with his broom in his Quidditch leathers. When he told her about the cave, the potion, the Inferi - she buried her head in her hands and wept.
From her seat beside the bench, Hermione sniffs and brushes an invisible speck of dust off her pristine robes. Sometimes her mastery of the courtroom frightens Harry - she plays people like Ron plays chess, only with greater ruthlessness.
‘You okay there, dude?’ Singh bellows.
on his skin even after they’ve cast the last charm.
Harry doesn’t end up with everything.
But Malfoy is crying. His long, lean body curled over the sink, his body heaving with ugly, bone-crushing sobs, his knuckles white as he grips onto the sink. He’s sloppy when he whirls around at Harry, his voice shrill with desperation as he tries to get all the syllables out, but he’s slow, and Harry’s always been faster in a duel.
‘You like Pansy,’ Harry reminds him. He decides not to mention the other couple now entangled in a passionate embrace beneath the lemon tree, lest Ron have a complete meltdown.
There’s eggs and bacon waiting for them on the table by the time they reach the kitchen. Teddy watches them steadily as they sit down opposite him. He takes a long sip from the fantastically ugly mug Victoire gifted him on his fifteenth birthday -
‘It was someone working there, actually,’ Draco replies. ‘An apprentice. I don’t know the name.’
want to earn a place in this delicate new world that is growing out of the rubble - this place where a boy with a love for flowers might find a small corner and grow.
Draco’s eyes widen as he finally understands. ‘Why would you permanently brand yourself with my magical signature?’ he asks.
‘I didn’t drink a bottle of Ogden's, Pansy,’ Harry says, glancing up at her, ‘unlike some people.’ He looks down at the work spread out over the table. ‘I have to get back to work.’
that Harry wonders if he’s fallen into an alternate universe where there was never an army of bigots in fancy dress killing people.
Pansy kicks him viciously in the ankle, by which she means,
Harry’s never heard Draco speak of the War like this before - awful in its unflinching candour. It’s not that Harry’s forgotten about the dark stretch of sixth year, nor the awful, unforgivable things that Draco has done. He can’t ever forget Katie floating in the air above as though underwater, her cheeks as white as the snow whirling around her, the chilling pitch of her scream. And he’ll never forget Ron - Ron’s eyes rolling into the back of his head, Ron’s pulse fluttering hummingbird-frantic beneath his fingertips, the blind panic of nearly losing yet another loved one to something stupid and senseless -
‘I do,’ Harry says sorrowfully. ‘But I’ve already got honey parsnips and carrots. I can’t finish both.’
- and he has blood and human parts all over his boots. But then Percy runs into him, red-faced and sweating, and babbles out that someone’s filed a report about Draco’s apothecary -
Harry sighs. ‘I award points wherever I see exemplary spellwork and-’
A Horcrux is not something normally meant to fit inside of a living creature, let alone a person, but Harry lived with that cursed sliver of Tom Riddle’s soul inside of him for more than a decade. The only way that Harry’s magical core could survive the onslaught was to adapt, to follow ancient channels built into the blueprint of magic itself. He doesn’t have any dams or protections surrounding his magical core, allowing it to grow and grow until it overflows in all directions.
Luna sighs and takes his hand in hers. ‘You know that’s not true,’ she says gently. ‘Just write him something,’ she tells him. ‘One of your lovely letters, perhaps. I think he’d like it very much.’
- until Harry appeased her by appointing her head caterer.)
Pansy awards Harry with a clipped nod, apparently ready to move onto her next victim. ‘Thank you.’
Harry tries not to grin too widely. ‘Brilliant.’
‘Does it have tentacles?’ Ron asks warily.
He clenches his fingers and feels the Wispa packet still locked in the vice of his hand. He hears Draco’s voice in his ear, soft and sweet, like a trickle of springwater falling down through the rubble.
‘We’ve had this discussion - spells don’t work on my hair,’ Harry sighs, gesturing at the untameable mane growing on his head. ‘It’s either potions or doing it the Muggle way.’
‘I know,’ Harry says. ‘I know- it’s just.’ He swallows thickly around the jagged stone lodged in his throat. ‘I can’t lose him. I never even- I can’t.’
He’s a bit tipsy from the fancy champagne and the not-so-fancy firewhiskey Ron brought, so maybe he says a few things he shouldn’t. Things like,
Blaise comes to stand beside Harry.
But he tries.
He drops his phone by his head and pulls the covers over his chin. He listens to the wind batter the walls of the building and watches the snow fling itself against his single-glazed windows. He should turn the heating up but he cannot find the strength to move further than this safe cocoon of lavender-scented detergent and fuzzy socks. Artemis curls over his head and licks his brows in a valiant attempt to cheer him up, and it almost makes him cry harder because of how much this silly little creature loves him.
‘Very well,’ says the witch next to Smythe. ‘But we will be taking Mr. Potter with us.’
‘Not to you, it wouldn’t be,’ Daphne says, regarding him thoughtfully.
Harry huffs with quiet laughter. He eases his hand down to brace Draco’s lower back, feeling the muscles spasming slightly beneath his touch. He digs his thumb in slightly in an attempt to ease out the knots.
‘If you end here, then all you will have accomplished in your lifetime are the things your father wanted you to,’ she says, full of fury (but not against him,
Draco looks up at Harry. An ugly, purple-green bruise spreads over the rise of his cheekbone, and there is a cut at the top of his hairline, but he is there, in flesh and bone. Not dead.
‘I needed to- I want to apologise for that,’ he says. ‘For not being there. For not being able to take care of you when you needed it.’
He does remember Astoria, sort of, but she’s a dim smudge in his memory, a flash of dark hair and delicate cheekbones and haunting eyes, a quiet shadow at Luna’s elbow at the Ravenclaw table. He can’t recall seeing her at all in sixth year.
The perfume of the ballroom is less heady out here, sweeter, and lighter. The sky is ablaze with a splendid sweep of stars and the gardens glimmer below, fountains gurgling sweetly beneath the music as the quartet picks up a delightful waltz.
‘We can also provide you with leaflets explaining our products to you in detail,’ Angel adds, just as Guy slides open a drawer beneath the desk and pulls out a small booklet with the words
Draco smiles and lifts his arm, baring the gnarly, ropy scar that drags across his skin from where Buckbeak clawed him in third year. ‘Hippogriffs,’ he says.
He turns the volume around and slides it across the desk towards his lawyer. ‘Tell me if that’s what I think it is,’ he says.
but the awful creeping numbness that spreads within him.
She speaks in a calm, steady tone, but her eyes flash with cold fury. The unspoken statement is there, hidden in her words as she narrates the long weeks of being trapped at the end of her husband’s wand.
‘There will be

, and
Also, chaotic weddings are the absolute best kind, I love me a good, messy party. Gosh I love the Weasleys. I love them so much.
It was meant to be one chapter of Draco’s POV and now it has bled into two, agh. The upside, though, is that I’ve written/planned out the next chapter and just need to edit. Because I write un-betaed like the human flaming trash pile that I am.
Behind him, the Floo flares to life. He turns in time to see Luna and Daphne step up from the fireplace.
Draco plucks the cigarette from Harry’s fingers. His skin is so pale in comparison to Harry’s dark, summer-browned skin. ‘Our adults did a real number on us,’ he says quietly, ‘didn’t they?’
‘It is effortless to love you, Harry,’ Draco whispers. ‘Easier than breathing.’
‘Alright,’ Hermione replies, nodding primly.
‘This love for drama comes from your side of the family, you know,’ Harry informs Draco, while Victoire films Teddy’s meltdown on her smartphone, giggling helplessly.
Harry opens his eyes slowly and turns to face the source of Draco’s magical signature. There is nothing there but a wall - a wall that’s always been there, behind the sofa in Narcissa’s living room, no different from any others. Nothing to indicate the presence of an enormous, fortified room hiding behind it.
‘Will you promise me something, Harry?’ he asks.
Proudfoot grabs Harry by the elbow. By now, every last soul in the DMLE knows that Harry can wandlessly Apparate, but they both play along as Proudfoot twists on his heel and pulls Harry into a jarring Side-Along.
‘I have always loved you,’ Draco says, and Harry struggles to find his breath. ‘Only you.’
and his
expression. ‘Very nice to meet you, Blaise.’
‘This will be difficult to confirm,’ Acquafredda says. ‘Not without requesting the Selwyn accounts and alerting them.’
Malfoy hands Harry a drink that’s two parts vodka and one part lemonade. ‘Brace yourself, Potter,’ he says wearily. ‘It’s all downhill from here.’
strong, and I’m so proud of what you’ve become and all the good you’ve done. Now then, Malfoy, you weren’t always the nicest lad -’
She interviews one of the Belgian forensic wizards responsible for doing a post-incident sweep of Narcissa’s flat. His report was never submitted to the Wizengamot, so Hermione takes great care in making him inform everyone of his findings.
Draco bites down lightly on his kiss-stung lips. His eyes are the very fire that lights the stars when he looks at Harry, and Harry doesn’t know how
of the club.
P.S. In case any of you are wondering, Artemis is not living with Draco in Brussels because Artemis wasn’t exactly a kitten when he was adopted and passed peacefully at the ripe old age of 21 (at Draco’s best estimate) surrounded by lovely things and his favourite brand of catnip. Also, I’m gonna go back and edit Aretmis’ gender for consistency once this is all done because apparently I can’t remember anything, my brain is a sieve, wow.
‘I really don’t see how that’s relevant,’ Harry replies pleasantly.
Blaise only bares his teeth in a deadly smile. ‘There’s nowhere to run, Lucius,’ he drawls, lifting his wand. ‘No one can Apparate in or out of here - we’ve set up wards. You’re welcome to splinch yourself trying, of course,’ he adds.
Draco accepts this graciously with a shrug.
that once lived here.
These days Harry makes sure he has a pocket full of Pepper-Up potions and smelling salts in case that ever happens again, and he makes sure to cast the diagnostic spell on Malfoy each time they see each other. He wishes he could ease the tight coil in his chest, but Malfoy looked so fragile, lying there on the grass with his lips so pale they were bone-white.
Draco makes an ugly, gurgling sound in his throat. Crimson seeps from his lips, stark against the pallor of his skin. He peers up at Harry as though through a thick fog. Harry’s hands are trembling even as he begins to cast. He needs to move faster, to complete the countercurse before it’s too late, before Draco loses too much blood.
Blaise sends over the Department’s files on Lucius’s involvement with the Time Turner in a shrunken filing cabinet, delivered by one extremely irritated eagle-owl that looks to be Blaise’s personal bird rather than a Ministry-allocated one. Harry has to appease her with jellied mice ordered up from reception before she’s willing to stop pecking at his fingers.
‘The answer is yes, Draco,’ he says hurriedly - almost frantically. ‘The answer will always be yes. It’s always been yes.’
‘Last time I didn’t have Blaise Zabini in my corner,’ Harry says. He gets up from his table, the motion making him sway somewhat. He needs to eat, or sleep, or perhaps just drink something other than coffee, but first- ‘I have to make a call.’
As the light grows, his grief shifts within him, growing teeth. He stands, his knees groaning in protest. It is cold in this room, and he has been kneeling here all night. He pushes his hair out of his face and runs his hand over the multitude of wrinkles worn into his suit. He glances at the softly glowing constellation of stars hanging on Harry’s wall, and his heart aches for the quiet, unassuming way Harry loves him.
He knows, deep in his gut, why the Aurors have come.
When Harry looks up, Malfoy’s eyes are dancing with amusement.
. There are pieces missing from the puzzle - chunks of information that have been redacted or else not included. The documents keep referring to the records of the trial -
‘Yes,’ Draco laughs, pressing a kiss against Harry’s cheek. ‘I refuse to be out-boyfriended by you, Harry. It’s a matter of honour. Dignity.
Draco’s smile spreads and reaches his eyes, etching deep grooves at the corners. He shifts his grip and so that he can follow the spheres of the Anchors to the soft, delicate place just on the inside of Harry’s elbows.
Pansy’s smile is a knife-wound across her face. ‘They said that it was weird I hadn’t noticed,’ she replies. ‘They said I had to either be a complete idiot, or else I was involved with it, somehow. I told them that was stupid, and they told me that I had nothing to worry about if my hands were clean.’
Harry is about to reach for his quill again when he hears soft footsteps approaching. Draco emerges from the shadows of the house, a pale figure drawn in soft half-light.
Ron huffs a quick, short laugh. ‘Thank you, Blaise, indeed.’ He cocks his head to the side as he surveys Harry’s extraordinarily dismal appearance. ‘You look like shite. Have you slept any?’
Harry grins. ‘Merlin, Daphne. You had me worried there for a moment that the Sorting Hat should’ve had you for Ravenclaw.’
‘What’s wrong?’ Draco asks, wariness creeping into his tone.
‘Haven’t heard,’ Daphne says grimly, cutting Harry off before he can finish his question. She must be coming off a long shift. There are dark circles under her eyes, and he can sense the faint buzz of Pepper-Up in her veins.
Acquafredda seems to notice Harry’s expression of abject horror and seems to take pity on him. He waves his wand and spells a volume over to Harry. ‘This particular ledger will be of interest to you, I believe.’
So he finishes his espresso and gets up, striding out into the street. Above him, the colour of the sky deepens and Paris is aglow with silver and gold.
‘She is,’ Pansy confirms. She tucks her hair behind her ear and leans back into her seat. The groove between her eyebrows deepens considerably. ‘But then if it wasn’t some kind of Confundus charm, what the fuck was that? I’ve never known Narcissa to speak so incoherently.’
‘On what grounds?’ Hermione demands, more incredulous than angry. ‘Do you even have a warrant for this?’
Harry flips through his book as the cities and towns and fields fly past. Draco gave it to Harry on his twenty-fifth birthday as something of a joke -
‘Aw, bless. Gin, look,’ Neville says, nudging his wife with an elbow. ‘Harry’s being
‘Shall I tell you something else I noticed in that ledger there?’ Draco asks Proudfoot. ‘Each of those twelve payments perfectly match the cost of ingredients delivered to Selwyn Thestral - all save one. A payment made precisely one week before the Diagon Incident. And isn’t it funny,’ he adds, soft and dangerous like a knife kissing a bared throat, ‘that that last payment is probably large enough to buy a house in Surrey? Maybe, say, one like the house Robards bought that same year?’
‘Watching your valiant struggle with the most mundane of tasks never ceases to entertain me,’ Malfoy replies, reaching out for the box of chocolates. His hand spasms and he winces, but soon his expression melts into something lighter, more playful. ‘And the correct translation is life is
‘He knew,’ Draco said aloud. He opens his eyes and uncrosses his arms, leaning instead on the dining table as the others turn to look at him. ‘Harry knew this was going to happen.’
‘What did they say to you?’ Harry asks, surprised at how calm he sounds. Rage simmers in his gut, as familiar as an old friend. ‘The Aurors who interrogated you.’
Happiness is a fickle thing. It has a way of packing its bags and leaving in the middle of the night.
For Draco, he has to try.
They don’t talk about it, but that’s alright.
Proudfoot snatches the envelope out of the air and tears it open, pulling out a letter stamped with the seal of the Minister of Magic. The corners of his mouth draw tighter and tighter as his flinty eyes dart over the letter. Harry already knows what’s written there - he was in the room when the document was drafted. He just never thought it would mean
They lie together in the small, cramped bed with their foreheads touching, their hands clasped tight. There is a sweet stillness to the air around them, as though magic itself is holding its breath just to give the two some long-awaited peace.
heart is being ripped asunder. Draco feels as though he is made of ice - but they made a promise to each other and Draco can’t break it -
‘The what?’
‘Because Wicked Weasley’s not a qualified Cursebreaker?’ Draco asks. He’s listened to enough of Harry’s long-winded rants about Ministry bureaucracy to know where this conversation is going.
her friends.
Harry saw a portrait malfunction once, when he was still an Auror. It had been hit by a stray curse, and instead of reacting to the person standing directly in front of it, the wizard in the portrait kept repeating a number of answers to a person who was no longer there - as though he was trapped in a series of motions. In the end Harry had sent the thing off to a Cursebreaker for processing, but the damage was permanent. Harry never found out what happened to the portrait after that.
,’ Harry says fervently, and kisses him.
When he finishes, he turns the letter over and looks out past the doorway, into the darkness that stretches out in Grimmauld Place.
Harry laughs. ‘Christ, no.’ He runs his thumb over the band on his finger. He’s not quite accustomed to the weight of it yet, nor the way it startles him the morning with how cold it is. He’s yet to find a suitable ring for Draco, but Draco says there’s plenty of time for that. ‘We haven’t even settled on a country for the wedding yet,’ Harry admits, shaking his head.
Draco sits up in one quick motion, shifting so that he’s sitting cross-legged, facing Harry. ‘I’m saying you can drink your champagne, or you can kiss me, or you can do none of it at all and walk away from me forever, if you like, and I’ll still… I’ll still…’ he trails off, looking down at his bare feet. ‘I can’t force you to come to Belgium, not when you’re so happy here. But I can’t be a good person, not tonight.’
She leads him down the small corridor once more and into the airy living room. The bay windows are all open, and a lovely breeze sweeps in from the street, making the white curtains flutter gently. Someone is baking something sweet in the next apartment over, and Harry’s mouth waters at the scent. She pours them both a little pastis and water into delicate crystal glasses. She gestures for Harry to sit and passes him one of the glasses.
Pansy barks out a laugh and rolls her eyes. ‘If?’ she says incredulously. ‘You’re Harry fucking Potter. You can Apparate along ley lines. You had such a high case rate when you were an Auror that you broke the record. And even if you weren’t Boy Wonder, Potter,’ she adds, shaking her head, ‘you two are locked in an orbit that not even the Dark Lord could break. You were made to find each other. To be together.’
Blaise seems to give up his shuffling dance of nervousness and falls into the nearest seat with only half his usual grace. ‘Well,’ he says, biting out the syllable as though it has personally offended him, ‘it’s either that, or he can transfer from the Department of Mysteries to the DMLE to work as an asset for their new program.’
Draco closes his eyes, feeling suddenly overwhelmed by the mountain of emotions building up in this tiny room. He thinks of the silence of Grimmauld Place, a corpse gutted of its heart and soul. He thinks of the way Harry
‘I’m perfectly fine,’ Draco tells Teddy, his fingers still encircling Harry’s wrist. ‘A little weak, maybe. Nothing to worry about - nothing that can’t be healed.’
To which, of course, Harry says yes.
‘Not exactly,’ Harry replies. He glances at Pansy uneasily, but the witch’s face is a perfect mask of ice-cool composure.
Harry turns to look at Narcissa. She’s watching them both with a keen eye - they haven’t gone unnoticed. Her lips drawn into a tight, bloodless line. She arches her eyebrows questioningly. Harry holds a finger up to his lips. With his other hand, he slides his wand from its holster at his thigh. Narcissa’s face turns ashen, but inclines her chin in understanding.
Teddy rolls his eyes. ‘Nobody believes me when I say
Draco writes to each of them in reply (Draco was always good at writing letters, after all). He sits up into the late hours of the night, at the desk in Harry’s study, his brow wrinkled in concentration as he peers down through his glasses, his quill scratching away at parchment until Harry coaxes him to bed.
‘Please,’ says Harry. He leans on the counter, resting his elbow on the polished surface as he watches Malfoy pluck the small bottles off a shelf behind the counter. He wonders how long Malfoy’s been working here, and why they haven’t stumbled across each other before today - then remembers that he usually picks up his potions from the Ministry store, because Ron’s penny-pinching ways are now ingrained in him.
Draco sent him a leaf from an oak tree, preserved in its brilliant tungsten yellow-orange with a Stasis charm. Harry misses him like a lost limb. His teeth hurt from the aching.
Draco pointedly places the piece of chocolate in his mouth and elbows Harry gently in the ribs. ‘We’ve talked about the saviour complex, dear,’ he says. He is silent for a moment, his gaze dropping to the polished floor beneath his shoes, and then he looks up into Harry’s eyes. ‘Thank you,’ he says.
Proudfoot frowns heavily. ‘That’s a coincidence,’ he says. ‘And besides, how were we supposed to know about, er-’ he waves his hand in a broad stroke, ‘-the possession thing? Quirrell came back, said nothing was wrong. He seemed normal enough.’
Harry wakes up to the door opening. The world is a blurry smudge of colours - his glasses must have fallen off in his sleep - and he fumbles in the blanket blindly.
Draco smiles at him with heartbreaking tenderness, beautiful even in the cold, unforgiving light. ‘Oh, my darling imbecile,’ Draco says. ‘I’m not going anywhere.’
‘Yes,’ Harry replies. He has a sinking suspicion he knows exactly what’s going on with Narcissa, but he’d rather have confirmation before jumping to any conclusions. He’d learned it the hard way with Sirius - sometimes his instincts are just wrong.
?’ Harry exclaims, shaking the box at Malfoy. ‘Really? You couldn’t have just
drunk. She manhandles Draco away from Harry mid-waltz -
He has to find Draco before it’s too late.
It’s there in the ledger, sitting between two innocuous payments for furniture - a massive lump-sum payment to a party marked down as LLSS. Harry digs around in the ledger until he finds out that LLSS stands for Lopez & Lopez Secure Solutions, Antwerp Branch.
It was after dinner, in Severus’s private quarters, when Draco’s mentor first showed him how to treat gangrene.
‘You’re an absolute legend in the security business,’ Guy adds as he scans the paperwork in front of him with brutal efficiency. He rolls the parchment up and hands it over to Harry. ‘Your study on the efficacy of trigger-charms on safehouses? That’s our bible.’
‘I knew the Panic Room was in Narcissa’s apartment somewhere,’ Harry explains, ‘so when I felt your magical signature, I knew it had to be there - and that you were locked in there.’
They all stare at it for a while in stunned silence.
‘Commute?’ Neville repeats, sounding surprised.
The moment is broken -
From his seat, Harry watches him, beautiful and untouchable as a fallen angel. Draco’s pale fingers draw a stark contrast against the dark wood as he braces his palms against the edge of Kingsley’s desk and leans back against it, without a care for the fact that it belongs to the Minister of Magic himself, and stretches his long legs out before him, crossing them delicately at the ankles. His boots are polished to a shine. He looks like a weapon, and Harry suddenly remembers the quicksilver way Draco used to move when he duelled, and wonders if perhaps in another universe Draco would have made a rather intimidating Auror.
,’ Harry wheezes.
‘That was quite an impressive display, Potter,’ says Malfoy’s voice from above him, the usual bite somehow missing from his words. ‘Would you like to set the Department of Mysteries on fire next, perhaps?’
‘And your partner?’ Harry asks. ‘What happened to him?’
‘One week after each payment made by Lucius to Selwyn Thestral Stables,’ Draco says, ‘an order of ingredients are imported into England from an East Asian apothecary, delivered to Selwyn Thestral Stables.’ He tucks his wand away into his sleeve. ‘The ingredients seem harmless at first glance, but when all twelve orders are combined, it appears that someone has plans to brew fuel for Chimera’s Flame.’
Narcissa answers the door after a brief delay. She’s got a pashmina shawl draped over her, but Harry can glimpse the purpling bruises on her shoulders beneath the sweep of cloth. He thinks back to similar bruises glimpsed years and years ago, scattered across a teenage boy’s skin, and feels his stomach turn.
. He hasn’t modified his Anchors back to their usual levels.
‘Good god, Draco,’ Ginny says, her eyebrows shooting upwards. ‘Whatever happened to you?’
Harry reaches out and pulls Pansy into a tight hug. Her shoulders are so much smaller than they look, but that’s because she always stands taller than she really is. Pansy is a paper mache monster easily crumpled in the rain, but she bites as hard as she can so you never know how much she cares. Harry feels a surge of gratitude for this prickly, aggressive witch and the depths of her love for her friends.
‘I don’t suppose you tell me where the panic room is located in Narcissa’s apartment?’ he asks tentatively.
‘Stay alive, Draco, please,’ Harry whispers. He presses Draco’s body to his chest, his fingers cradling the back of his neck. So cold. So pale. ‘Stay alive. Please, for me.’
Harry’s on his feet in an instant, racing towards the elevators. His pulse drums a feverish beat as he charges down the corridors faster than he’s ever run in his life. He nearly collides with the Healer leaving Draco’s room. She says something to him, an explanation of sorts, facts and spells and medical terminology that he stows away for when he’s thinking clearly, and he responds as politely as he can, excuses himself, and then he’s through and in the room and Draco-
It takes every last ounce of strength left in him to stay awake, but he does.
It’s not really allowed, but the nurses and the Healers can’t seem to find the heart to separate the blond man with the chest wound and his dark-haired hero (the one that even the youngest apprentice recognises, the one whose face used to be in all the papers, the one that they’ve stitched together more times than any single person should have to be).
,’ he utters. ‘The Vanishing Cabinet. The fucking Vanishing Cabinet.’
Now, there is nothing.
The apartment needs to remain under Stasis, so Harry checks into a nearby hotel. He barely tastes the complimentary breakfast in the morning, throwing the tasteless coffee back as he frowns at his haphazard notes.
He spends most of his time in the Muggle world. He talks to his friends (the few that remain in this country, who have not fled their persecution following the trials). He picks up bartending. He goes for coffee with Luna and visits museums with her, and even when she tries to persuade him otherwise, he keeps his distance.
‘Should we keep the thing in storage or destroy it?’ Blaise asks, turning back to Harry.
Blaise reluctantly concedes, falling into the chair with only half of his usual grace. He casts a quick glance over the ledger on the table and winces. ‘Do you ever wish we were born to different families?’ he asks, looking up at Draco.
Harry lifts his chin and catches Draco’s mouth instead, delirious that he can do this now. Draco makes a soft, pleased noise at the back of his throat that is the most beautiful sound Harry’s ever heard. Harry pulls him down onto the bed with a flick of his wrist, flipping them neatly over. He hovers over Draco, forearms braced against the bed above his head.
confirm that a Lopez Panic Room was indeed purchased by one Draco Malfoy to be installed in the apartment of one Narcissa Malfoy.’
(See the end of the chapter for
Pansy has no idea what he’s trying to do, of course. He hopes she won’t ask too much about how far he’s gotten with the case. There are things he just can’t tell her - things that he’s had to keep secret as soon as he started working for the Department of Mysteries. Things about the black lines of ink tattooed onto his arms, and the other things he’s learned how to do.
Neville shakes his head, releasing his grip on Harry’s shoulder. ‘It just seems horrible, Harry. It’s awful that this is who you had to be - that is the life they forced upon you
‘That you’re not my first?’ Harry frowns.
It isn’t the done thing for anyone aged under fifty, but the old-medicine taste of pastis has sort of grown on Harry.
, Harry wants to say. He’s not obsessed. He doesn’t think Malfoy’s up to something. He just wants to give Malfoy’s wand back.
‘I’m sorry I’m such a burden sometimes,’ Draco mumbles, his mouth full of Harry’s jumper.
The storm howls as it strikes Azkaban and Harry drinks deep from its power.
Draco’s hands are not shaking.
Harry looks at Malfoy and thinks about a cupboard under the stairs, about bars on bedroom windows, and comes to the realization that perhaps they might have more in common than he’d ever known.
‘Are we alright, Harry?’ she asks, in that brutally sudden way she does when she’s attacking something difficult. Her forehead is wrinkled, all her freckles bunching up together beneath the sweeping fall of her red hair.
‘Hm,’ says Daphne. She puts her wand away. ‘But you’re still not sleeping enough. And you haven’t been eating properly.’
Harry narrows his eyes. ‘What’s this really about?’
Harry slots the stems of both drink glasses through his fingers and shakes Daphne’s hand. As soon as Harry’s palm touches hers, a shock of energy snaps up his arm like he’s been electrocuted. He yanks his hand away with a wince.
Harry smiles, a gentle, lopsided thing, and the deep roots of Draco’s love grow even deeper.
Harry rubs his swollen, tired eyes. ‘You don’t know that,’ he says.
This is a happy ending fic, I promise, but we're about to leave the gentle fluffy hints and get into the gritty stuff. I might have to change my tags. We'll see.
He is here to help, not hinder, so Draco takes a deep breath and says, as calmly as he can, ‘Harry has never been very good at sharing his burdens.’
Neville drops into his deck chair with a happy sigh. He stretches out his long legs in front of him, digging his toes into the damp soil. ‘I love my garden,’ he announces, and takes a long swig of his butterbeer.
‘Don’t be a sore loser,’ Prentis laughs, folding her arms over her chest. ‘You lost the coin toss, fair and square.’
Blaise drops his hand from the fireplace and rubs his hand over his face tiredly. ‘Right,’ he announces. ‘I am in sore need of coffee. Would either of you like any?’
He says nothing out loud, and Harry goes back out, returning with the wireless already switched on and tuned to BBC One. He props it up against Draco’s pillows, leaning close as he does, close enough for Draco to smell the faint amber hints of his cologne. Draco bought this cologne from Debenhams - saved up three months’ wages for it, too, like the lovesick fool that he is, and it was certainly worth it to see Harry’s face light up when he unwrapped the expensive packaging.
Blaise’s shoes click deafeningly against the wooden floorboards as he paces. Kingsley stands up from his desk, heading to the bar at the back of his study. He pours himself two fingers of golden liquor, downing it almost instantly, his throat clicking audibly.
Acquafredda waves his wand in a lazy semicircle above his head. Many black volumes fly from the floor-to-ceiling shelves behind him, and hover around him in a wide arc. Numbers are printed onto the front of each ledger in an indecipherable code, probably known only to the lawyer.
‘I already brought the ingredients over,’ Harry interrupts.
Their first trip mostly involved standing in queues. They queued to go up the Eiffel Tower, passing the time by chatting about Draco’s bizarre obsession with the mechanics of the Starship Enterprise. They queued in the snow to visit the Louvre, and for Notre Dame, and for the Musée d’Orsay. They stood in line for a whole hour in the muggy heat, waiting to get into the Palace of Versailles, before the heavens opened. Nobody else around them understood why two young men would find torrential rain quite so funny, but then they probably never lived in a world where getting rained on is a choice.
Are you having feelings yet? I’m having feelings.
Harry presses the palms of his hands against his forehead and tilts his head back towards the sky, fastening his gaze upon the moon and all the stars beyond. He fills his lungs with clear, cold air, and thinks of the strange poetry of all the things that tie him and Draco together - the grandeur of the stars, the rituals of Christmas and birthdays, the absurdity of confectionery. The years of fighting and squabbling and death and torture and delicate, wonderful hope.
Smythe still doesn’t seem to understand, but one of the witches behind him grabs him by the arm and shakes her head. She whispers in his ear what Harry already knows - what everyone even tangentially involved in Healing or Potions or has worked in any kind of magical laboratory knows.
(He hails from one of the oldest magical families in Barcelona, but - like Draco - he has long since drifted from his point of origin. He gave his enormous inheritance away to war orphanages and charities and married a Venezuelan wizard who occasionally likes to perform in drag at the local gay bar. He also has two sons, both adopted from Muggle orphanages that did not know what to do with their random bursts of accidental magic, and has named each of them after prominent scientists. Draco likes to attend their music recitals from time to time.)
Ginny opens her mouth to argue, but Draco is now within earshot. He drops inelegantly onto the grass between them, and by some miracle, does not spill a drop from the open bottle of champagne.
And just as suddenly as it came, the darkness is gone - swept away with tide, resting beneath the seabed.
The man lounging by the window pushes off the wall, striding across the room until he comes to a stop at Draco’s side. He mutters something in Draco’s ear, making the latter’s expression twist into something pained.
‘Then he shall be counted as a war hero for his sacrifice,’ the witch states with firm authority, ‘as Severus Snape was.’
Harry wants to shake Draco and yell at him. He wants Draco to understand that this isn’t the alcohol, or the sorrow, or even the burn of loneliness and abandonment. This is sunlight across the Quidditch pitches on a spring afternoon and the glint of the Snitch in the air. This is scraped knees and hexes flung and notes passed in classes, and chocolate and war and death and loss and grief, and a moonlit night in a field full of wildflowers and the gentle quiet of someone who tilts in harmony with you, and how rare and wonderful this thing between them is.
He’s a little upset, though, that everyone seems to have received a lovely letter from lovely Malfoy, and he’s still wandering around like an idiot trying to find that posh little git.
Angel shakes his head in response. ‘I’m afraid we can’t disclose private client information.’
Charlie shows up by the time half the pie is gone, looking weather-beaten and travel weary. He drops his suitcase by the umbrella stand and comes over to kiss his mother on the cheek.
They sit in comfortable silence for a while, watching the stream roll by. There are butterflies flitting over the sparkling water, a whole flock of them dancing over the water’s edge and skipping over shining pebbles. The wind picks up, and the treetops bend and dance in time. The sky is a feather-brushed array of brilliant blue, and the clouds are beginning to take on a golden hue as the afternoon grows old.
Harry wonders, faintly, if the hotel reception even understands the concept of privacy. First Pansy, now Ron - apparently anyone can waltz right into his room whenever they want.
‘I need a better angle,’ Ginny tells Harry gleefully. ‘I’m going to play this for George in the pensieve when I get home.’ She detaches herself from Harry with a peck on his cheek, claps Malfoy on the back, and heads over to stand beside Ron.
Acquafredda shakes his head. ‘There is no need,’ he says. ‘As a member of Master Malfoy’s family, you may take the ledger with you for inspection and return it whenever you are done with it. The ledger has a magical tracker, you see, which allows me to keep track of it.’
It’s been a good few years since he’s had to look over any paper trails, so it takes a while for the gears to start turning - but once he does get started, Harry ends up completely absorbed in it, barely noticing the fading light beyond the office windows until he feels Acquafredda’s hand settle on his shoulder.
He smells nice -
‘Okay,’ Harry says. He folds his hands in his lap, if only to stop from reaching out towards the other man. ‘But Draco? You won’t lose me. Ever.’
They have breakfast with all the windows open, and though the summers are as chilly and rainy here as they were in England, Harry never once feels cold. Draco sits with his chair drawn as close to Harry’s as possible, and they eat from the same plate. Draco is careless with his affections these days - more so than their days in the Cornwall house. He wipes a smear of chocolate off Harry’s lips and licks it off his thumb, and then drops his hand onto Harry’s sternum, where his shirt is still unbuttoned. He traces Harry’s scars every morning - the one that took his life in the Forbidden  Forest, and the one that reaches down his flank down to his hip, where a metal pole pierced through his body and remained there for the three days that he was buried beneath the wreck of Diagon Alley.
He hears a slight shuffling, a soft murmur, and then a series of sharp clicks sound out as the locks on the door spell open. The door pulls open to reveal Narcissa, looking a little paler than usual but every bit as beautiful as when Harry first saw her. She seems to freeze in the doorway as she stares at Harry.
And Draco is lovely and patient and beautiful, and he smiles like Harry is the most wonderful thing in the world.
‘I made a promise, after all,’ Draco whispers, his eyes fluttering shut.
Harry flings the filthiest look he can muster at his friend. ‘You used
‘War orphanage got attacked on Wednesday,’ Harry sighs. ‘It’s an exploding curse of some kind, but the spellwork is complicated. It’s got… levels and triggers. Third time we’ve encountered its sort. I’ve been petitioning to have George take a look at it. He’s done similar work - but Robards won’t have it.’
Draco feels a smile pull reluctantly at his lips. He glances towards the dining room, where Luna has managed to coax Hermione into a chair. He can hear the boiling of the kettle and the soft clinking of cups being set on the table.
is printed in white across the glass panel on the front door, and directly underneath, in smaller letters:
,’ Harry says exasperatedly. He’s running on empty at this point and he hasn’t got time for this. They used to have this argument all the time.
She grabs him by the cheeks and plants a smacking, wet kiss on his forehead. ‘About bloody time, you miserable cunt!’ she yells gleefully. ‘I thought you were going to die of stupid gay pining, you stupid, stupid
He pours water into the teapot, locates enough matching mugs for the three of them, and heads back into the living room.  Pansy’s face is scrunched up with frustration, streaked with dark tracks from where her weeping has melted her mascara, her eyes reddened and slightly swollen. Draco looks tired, dark shadows prominent beneath his eyes, his mouth twisted into a slight frown.
‘You saved me, you know,’ Harry says. ‘Under that rubble, I wanted to give up. To be done.’
