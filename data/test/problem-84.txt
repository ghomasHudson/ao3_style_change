Draco glared down at her, waiting for her smile to falter and for her to run off, crying or something. But she didn't. Instead she
“I’m having a blast, Potter. Even though nobody has asked me to dance, yet.” Draco was still smirking and Harry wasn’t sure if he was mocking him or if he really meant it. Draco raised an eyebrow.
Percy leaned down to hug her – a little stiffly but better than no hug at all – before he threw a glance over his shoulder. Molly followed her son’s eyes.
Monday started with double Potions together with Hufflepuff. Draco's favorite subject with his godfather as teacher. But on Friday when they had made their first potion, a cheer-up brew, he'd gotten paired up with a Hufflepuff.
He had a plan! Over Christmas he would get Malfoy to talk to him! And he would start with it right now!
Sadly, there were still enough people in this class who were clinging to his lips like he was some sort of invincible sorcerer or something impressive like that. It was painful to watch.
Hermione wouldn't have any of it. She just kept ignoring them in a rather loud way. Harry wanted to avoid her eye at any chance. He knew they had messed up. She was right, they had been very irresponsible. But the outcome could've been worse... probably.
After three cups of very sugary tea Harry made his way back to the castle where he joined Ron and Hermione for breakfast with a smile on his lips and probably a red nose from the cold.
When Draco left the owlery, after sending his owl home with his letter, it was way to early for breakfast and Blaise and Pansy were probably still sleeping.
She let her eyes wander over the people in the room. Then she suddenly pointed at a blonde second year who was reading a book while sitting on one of the window sills.
Either way, it meant that Harry was stuck at this Ministry Yule ball on his own and he’d prefer to find himself some pleasant company before a bunch of self-declared important people would start chatting him up.
When the bell rang Harry did not get up. He knew he definitely should. Hermione and Ron would be waiting for him.
“I’m not perfect. And my parents know that very well. Before we met each other again, while I was at university, I made a lot of bad decisions. One of them was to cut all contact with my family. One of my professors was a little weird in the head but at the time I didn’t see that. I saw a person who had accomplished things that I was striving to accomplish and made him my idol. And somehow, he convinced me that my “lower class” family would just hold me back in life.
, not caring about how close to curfew it was. A cup of peppermint tea was awaiting him on the table and he sat down on the couch in front of it while the door fell shut behind him.
Good thing he was rescued by Ron, Fred and George only three days into his punishment. There’s only so long you can survive on nothing but tinned soup.
As if it wasn't enough to distract him from the lesson, it had to be Draco calling him stupid names. Last time he'd checked they had been on good terms! Well at least he hadn't been insulting him anymore since Saturday. But having shared a dorm with the other boy for over two months (had it really been that long already) Harry guessed it was because of Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini and Parkinson. In evidence of Draco spending so much time with his friends, they had to be important to him. And Slytherins were mostly very prejudiced towards almost everything, including the other three houses. Maybe Malfoy wanted to prove that he's still Slytherin enough to be with them or maybe even lead them, despite him being a Ravenclaw.
Snapes office was right behind the potions class room, down in the dungeons. They went there right after breakfast on wednesday morning, after they overheard a conversation between Snape and a student, the latter who told him that Dumbledore wanted to talk to the professor.
And so they did. Then Mr and Mrs Weasley took Ginny through the barrier, leaving Ron and Harry to themselves. As their time was running out they decided to go together. They took up a lot of speed, the wall came closer and closer and –
Then something seemed to jump into place inside him because suddenly the perfect mask reappeared on his face and he said,
to get onto the Quidditch team. Sure, Malfoy had much more practice but Harry was doing it to make his father proud and this was the perfect motivation.
Giving in, the boy sat down on the couch once again and was staring in to the orange flames, which were licking on the bricks of the fireplace.
As a result, Harry currently had to spend every Monday and Thursday afternoon hanging around school grounds on his own. Handling boredom was not one of his talents.
"I'm Cho Chang. Second year. I've seen you sitting alone in the common room. Already thought about giving you some company but usually it's better to wait until the first years get to know each other better. You know, so they can find friends their age."
. He'd heard about that creature and according to what he knew, everything fit into the profile. First he wanted to proofread the page but then a mob of black hair and a lightreflex caught his eye. Potter was heading for the exit. He was going to see him. So he just ripped out the page in a hurry, put on his perfect mask and strut down the flight of stairs. The following encounter was a huge mess filled with a mix of some angry and some unreadable glares, insulting the youngest Weasle (a
Harry left Draco’s positively ruffled hair alone and used both his arms to hold Draco in a loving embrace. “Well, I wouldn’t know. But I’d rather have you tell me about your sexy dreams than talk about the fact that I’ve never had a normal dream in my life.”
With a sigh Charlie forced himself to turn away and shut down the worrying for the rest of the night. He could come by to check in again tomorrow morning. Now, his family was waiting.
Harry hadn’t dated anyone in a while. Neither man, nor woman. He had put himself out there for a certain period of time after his breakup with Ginny, but it wasn’t easy to find something that was working out for him, considering that he was The Saviour and all.
“Mr Weasley, this wand is not fit for any kind of spellwork anymore. I recommend writing to your parents and asking for a new one as soon as possible, we'd want to avoid any kind of serious injury, right? And in the meantime you'd better stick to theoretical practice, hm?”
But the reply was already muffled by the bathroom door. With a sigh, Draco started to get ready for bed. Dobby was a dead elf!
he greeted the blonde, who was reading on his bed. The other boy looked up at him and nodded, before turning his gaze back to the pages. Harry smiled to himself. No insults, no ignoring, no sneer. That definitely could be counted as improvement. Tiredness flooded him when he approached his bed. He changed into pajamas and as soon as his head touched his pillow he fell asleep, exhausted from the long and eventful day.
After taking a long sip of his drink and slapping himself mentally, Harry managed to remember his ballroom etiquette skills that he had somewhat achieved over his years at the ministry. He held out his arm for Draco, trying not to freak out entirely when he took it, and led him over to the dancefloor.
They started to throw at the troll with pieces of wood and insults relentlessly. When the beast still didn't react, Harry jumped onto its back and climbed all the way up until his arms were circling its neck from behind. With his hands he tried to hurt the troll in his face, aiming at everything in his reach. Stabbing into its eyes with his fingers or punching its nose. Anything to distract it from Hermione.
Charlie walked past all of the cages, checking if everything was as it should be. At the end of the hallway he stopped for a little longer. With concerned eyes he looked upon their newest arrival. An underfed german shepherd puppy. Now it was sleeping but it hadn’t been easy to get there.
That sounded a lot like Peeves. Draco considered her for a second. But helping little girls wasn't really his thing and even if he wanted to he wouldn't know how.
. Molly was the last one to join them. In her hands she carried a small pot of glittery black powder.
). The more he was satisfied when Langdorn turned her gaze to the ground and hid her face behind a curtain of long, brown hair as she saw him through the glass of the door. The satisfaction of being respected -or even feared- almost overpowered the other feeling.
, was stealing his first place in almost every subject they had together. After a few hours of reading he got tired and put the book away. Only a few chapters left to read but they could wait until tomorrow. His other roommates were in the bathroom getting ready for bed so he changed into his pyjamas and waited until they were back so he could have the bathroom to himself. Malfoy's didn't share.
They were just outside the office when they bumped right into Snape. Just what they had needed in this moment. The potions master said something but Harry couldn't hear a word as he was suddenly boiling with hot
Harry opened his mouth to complain – he hadn't known his father in person but everyone apart from Snape was talking of him in high tones and no one was going to insult him in front of his son – but in that moment the headmaster entered the room, accompanied by Professors Flitwick and McGonagall. Harry's mouth fell shut and both students stared at their feet, ashamed. Harry was not ready to wake up from this dream, yet, but it seemed like he'd have to.
Still his mind didn't leave completely off of his roommate. He remembered the last evening. It had been nice talking to him about Quidditch. Of course he wouldn't allow a conversation like this to happen if people knowing his father were around. But family was a strong priority amongst purebloods, which meant almost all of them had left over Christmas, and his father would never converse with anyone less than a pureblood.
Draco held onto her tightly, loving the warmth radiating off her body and being afraid to lose it again too soon. When they let go after a few minutes he saw his father standing behind her. He was wearing his 'ministry expression' like always in public but there was a light sparkle to his eyes. It didn't look angry, like Draco had feared, but delighted, and he held Draco's suitcase in his right hand, which the boy had dropped at some point. Relief washed over him and he couldn't help but give Lucius a small smile before turning to say goodbye to his friends.
"The Goyles will visit us tomorrow. I heard you were still holding close contact to Gregory and the others, despite the...
they were in the same house after all and he didn't want to lose Ravenclaw twice the amount of points they would lose if Potter got himself caught on his own.
"I warn you to not step out of line again. You're lucky your mother convinced me not to punish you. I expect best grades from you and don't make friends with people from unworthy families."
His heart warmed at the words and he couldn't hide his smile when he whined, "Don't call me that, mum! I'm not
, it would've been his fault. He had hastily shoved the feeling of guilt as for down as somewhat possible before scowling and joining in on the conversation.
Granger, Longbottom and Potter seemed a bit curious themselves about what was to come. Also Filch looked way too happy today. He even showed his yellowish teeth in what was probably supposed to be a grin but the expression was really more frightening than anything else.
! He's trying to gain his powers back! That's why Snape wants the stone! He wants to give it to him!"
As soon as Snape was out of the great hall the trio followed, but instead of going upstairs they made their way down into the dungeons. When they finally were out of everyone's eyesight Harry took out his father's cloak and threw it over their heads. Hidden like this they continued walking through the dark and chilly corridors. The only person who came across their way was a fourth year Slytherin walking in the opposite direction. Probably the Slytherin common room was down there, that would pretty much fit the house's image. Then they arrived at the potions classroom door. It was locked, as they had expected.
When the bell rang he would be the first one to leave the classroom and the last one to return to the Ravenclaw tower right before curfew.
Fast forward, fifteen minutes later Draco Malfoy came back down, his right fist clasped around the snitch and triumphantly raised into the air. His smirk was wider than ever. Cho was wearing an angry frown when she joined Harry in the bunch of wanna-be chasers.
Clearing his throat from all awkwardness he finally entered and went straight for the couch. If the room had changed even a little bit since last year, Draco didn't see it. It was all well-known, homely and comfortable. A nice cup of tea appeared on the small coffee table in front of him. He smiled briefly.
Harry caught himself thinking about how Draco’s legs must look below that veil of fabric. Immediately he tore his gaze away from his legs and instead let it settle on something a little further up. Only a small sliver of his pointy face was visible. His platinum blonde hair was pulled back into a loose French braid, some strands had fallen out and were softly framing his sharply cut jaw.
"Yeah, sure. That would be great actually. I'm sick of being laughed at by Snape and Malfoy. But only if you really don't mind, of course. You don't have to do it."
"I see. Let's do this: I'll sell you a box of living spiders and you can come back to get more if they are used up. If they die you can still feed them to your owl for the following three days
Warm pride filled Harry’s chest as he saw the corners of Draco’s mouth twitch upwards for a moment. He gave him a joyful smile in return.
Then he went to help Ron up, trying not to listen to exclaims of “animal cruelty” and “Where are their guardians?”.
When Granger and the Weasel joined Harry on the way to the Quidditch pitch, Draco left them to themselves. He'd wanted to watch the game with the Slytherins anyway but still his mood fell a bit.
Harry reached into his robe pocket searching for the smooth fabric but apparently he had left the invisibility cloak on the tower. When he pulled his hand out of the pocket again, a Knut got drawn out with it and fell to the floor, soundly bouncing up and down a few times before stirring to a halt in the middle of the corridor.
“That is good to hear. I recommend you take a look at what the cafeteria has to supply today before you leave.” Harry was confused. “I’ll see you on Sunday.”
"You're the heir of the Malfoy fortune and you always seemed to be eager for it. I'm deeply disappointed! You're lucky it's Ravenclaw. I wouldn't tolerate a Gryffindor in my house. And a weak Hufflepuff would be inherited in an instant. -"
When Harry woke up again he felt slightly better than before. His head still hurt like hell but he could easily move without feeling like vomiting. He sat up on his bed and reached for his glasses. Now able to see properly again he spotted a bowl of cold soup on his nightstand. The watch lying next to it told him it was about 4 in the afternoon but Harry couldn't be sure it still was the same day. He tried to remember what exactly had happened. One thing he was sure of was that he had been sick and that the Dursleys were very angry at him.
Draco ignored the in fact very scary memory involving a locked door from about exactly a year ago that came up at that.
And they set off, walking next to each other, not daring to talk about what had happened but also not daring to leave the other alone, either. They were the first ones to be in the great hall, neither Harry nor Draco's friends being awake, yet. They settled down at Ravenclaw table next to each other. It was a bit weird to sit with the person that had been offending him for the past two months right until just this morning, but feeling glad that he didn't leave you alone.
Draco rolled his eyes once again. Of course Potter would be the center of everyone's attention wherever he went. Even at the signing session of a wanna-be-famous author. Well, maybe Lockhart was quite popular and maybe also quite handsome but it didn't make him any less of an idiot. But with Potter in the shop everyone seemed to be even more excited and
And Harry didn't hesitate to agree. He'd shortly thought about just sending a letter but Hedwig angrily picked his finger bloody when he tried to open the cage. He really didn't want to let the Dursleys win. He needed to go back to Hogwarts. That's where he belonged. That's his home. And so they sat in the car, Ron behind the steering-wheel and Harry just remembered that there were Muggles around when they had set off the ground.
So Harry sighed and told the whole story. Well, the short form. How he and Hermione and Ron had found out about the
Draco was sitting in their usual corner, focusing intently on his homework. Harry took a deep breath. And then another one. And another one. And- Nope, this was enough. He was not a fucking coward. He could do this. With confident strides he walked over and sat down in the chair across from Draco, folding his hands together on top of the table.
"Nice to see you again. Too bad I haven‘t been sorted into Gryffindor. It would of been much fun. At least more fun than being stuck with Malfoy all year."
Ron seemed kind of pleased with that answer but Hermione gave him a doubting look. She didn't question him further, though. Instead she wished him a good night and headed off to the Gryffindor common room, Ron close behind.
Where chances were of a monster to be released by an innocent and unknowing school girl with a diary.
His mood was low again and he finished the lines with glaring eyes, waiting to finally exit this ridiculous class and to meet up with his friends.
She tutted, shaking her head. But instead of fixing them with a spell like she did on the train, she asked another question.
"I'm very sorry but Professor Dumbledore just received a letter from the minister this morning, summoning him to the ministry. May
They got detention. Polishing all of the awards in the trophy room on the following monday. Their smiles had faded when they had changed their clothes into dry ones and went down for lunch. Having skipped breakfast, Harry was really hungry.
It was too late; Professor McGonagall and Snape turned into the corridor and immediately spotted them. The four of them all ended up with detention on Friday evening and 100 points were taken from each Gryffindor and Ravenclaw. Then McGonagall took Hermione and Neville back to Gryffindor tower while Snape walked with Harry and Malfoy. Harry couldn't help but wonder whatever was wrong with Draco Malfoy. Sure, after Christmas he had returned to his previous arrogant-pureblood-self but following him outside after curfew? It didn't sound like him at all!
“Okay, keepers and chasers, easy game! I'll make two teams, you play a match, I'll switch out keepers every now and then. 30 minutes, then I'll choose the winners.”
The dishes disappeared and it was time for dessert now. They were all Halloween themed and looked extremely delicious.
"I've got some friends in Gryffindor. Can't blame the the other Ravenclaws in my year for not liking me. I'm losing lots of house points in potions. I think the teacher has targeted me since he first saw me. "
"It's a wise choice to want friends around you but it's not wise to choose your friends before you know them. You've got a lot potential but you may only gain wisdom - which you will most definitely need - in....RAVENCLAW!"
The following hour was mostly spent in silence, except for that one time when Blaise asked Draco to lend him an eraser. Every now and then Harry would be glared at but apparently Malfoy had realized there was no point in trying to convince Harry to leave. When the bell was rang to announce the end of afternoon classes, Harry grabbed his things and stood up.
Panting, Draco's awareness returned and he glanced to his right to see none other than Harry Potter standing next to him, leaning against the door.
Harry kept his eyes fixed upon Malfoy angrily. Or so he was telling himself. Even though he was very far from actually believing it this time. Because most of his mind was currently more freaking out about the fact that Draco Malfoy was wearing a dress and he was absolutely slaying it!
"Five points from Ravenclaw for being nosy, Potter, and another five for not concentrating on your assignment. Keep your eyes on your cauldron and whatever this is meant to be inside of it."
Anthony looked half furious, half relieved when Harry entered the dorm. Draco had been a little bit worried, too, although he would never admit that. Harry ignored the question.
himself and that a monster was supposed to live in it. Nothing more than a legend. And no reason to worry as long as it was closed. But his father had the key and he probably planned on slipping it to a school girl.
a dragon; It was Harry's cloak and Hermione was most likely to get them out of a tricky situation if one of that kind would turn up.
He left the compartment and made his way down the corridor. At some point he pushed a Hufflepuff out of his way who immediately ran off, almost crying, and he sneered at a few other people who either ignored him or rolled their eyes (
for a change), also insulting Harry's so called ‘friends’, Lucius joining in with insulting Granger's parents and having a weird conversation - actually they just exchanged like 5 words each - with Harry and then having a full on fist fight with Arthur Weasley, leaving the store in a real state. You don't want to hear the details. Anyway, they got picked apart and the bookshelves were restored with a few flicks of a wand. Mildly injured, both father's left the shop, taking their respective families with them and going down the Alley in opposite directions. And that was that.
Once he had rounded a few corners and found himself in a hallway that was barely used - even on regular work-days - he turned to look at Draco. The gaze that fell back on him was so intense that Harry was assured his feelings weren’t one sided. He stepped closer to the other man and placed his free hand on his hip. Harry gulped nervously. He could feel every curve and edge of Draco’s body through the soft fabric of the dress.
Caught off guard and confused by the last comment he actually wished her a “good night” and before he was able to take it back he received a blasting grin in return that made him want to smile as well. Then, her blonde head disappeared in the mass of other students and Draco bit his cheek to gain control over his facial expressions again. Getting up and out of the great hall he thought about sneaking off to
(Harry was sure she would get highest marks without even looking through her notes once but in this state it was impossible to discuss with her.)
On Monday afternoon Harry went to the library again. This time he found Malfoy already there. With Pansy. Harry’s heart sank. He was pretty sure the two of them had something going on. They weren’t officially dating but there were certain rumours going around. And he didn’t want to interrupt anything.
The captain appeared on the pitch, levitating a large chest and a bunch of school brooms. Lockhart kept talking bullshit.
After that, the rest of the day went by in exactly the same manner as every other day at Hogwarts in the previous year. It was incredible how everything just slipped back into place as if there hadn't been weeks in between. Draco spent the meals with his friends at the Slytherin table, moaning and drawling about incapable teachers, annoying first years and “fucking Potter”. At one point during dinner he felt someone watching them and after a few seconds spotted the culprit at the Ravenclaw table. Loony Luna had him fixed with her curious gaze, her head tilted to the right and her whole body slightly moving up and down in a constant rhythm, indicating she was swinging her legs again. It was an adorable picture.
He left the two small packages from the top, which had a far more expensive and nicer looking wrapping, for the end.
This stupid annoying prat! He should have let him face this scary creature on his own. Shouldn't have saved him.
“I don’t know, That’s all up to you. I will not accept these as a donation to the team, so, as far as I am concerned there are six high quality brooms in this closet that belong to the Malfoy family. Also, you are very lucky I let you participate in the try outs after this. I want nothing of the kind to happen ever again or you’re off the team, got it?”
. Her brown eyes and this shiny, black hair. So straight and sleek. Harry felt himself make a move to touch it. It felt as wonderful as it looked!
“As I told you last night, I’ve been crazy about you for the greater parts of our time at Hogwarts. And in the later years I had quite a lot of dreams with us being together. At first, I tried to ignore them, obviously. But I ended up hanging onto them so much that I hated every night that I wasn’t dreaming of you. In… in our sixth year I started taking dreamless sleep potions because… the dreams… you were too distracting. And after you… in the bathroom-“ Harry’s arms tensed slightly but soon he started lightly scratching Draco’s scalp to soothe him ”-I wanted to go back to hating you so bad. But after you left and I was stuck in the Manor with-“ Draco took a deep breath “-with Voldemort. I had nothing to live for. I stopped using the potion. And then I had you to live for again. The dreams made me believe there was still hope. And I liked escaping into them.”
Ron didn't share his opinion, apparently. The ginger boy looked terrified. Harry suppressed a laugh at his friend's ridiculous facial expression and set off towards the exit again.
Draco had tried his best to avoid the Scarface ever since. Except their detention of course. No Malfoy had ever been forced to do such disgusting, filthy house elf work before. He really was a shame for his family. Potter had worked a lot faster than him but he had looked like he hated it even more. There had been a moment where Draco almost felt sorry - No, there hadn't been a moment!
with a plea to send the books straight to the Manor along with a bill, just like they always had it with robes. Everything that had happened on their shopping trip just felt unreal. Like a weird dream. But Draco couldn't get it off his mind. All the things that had happened. And Potter. So cunfusing, that bloody git. Stupid, too. Draco sighed. He really ought to come up with some better insults if he wanted to keep that feud going. It was exhausting, really. Some days he cursed himself for sending Dobby on that 'mission'.
and the troll let go of his robes, swaying around uncontrollably. When he hit the ground the boy scrambled to his feet as fast as physically possible and observed the situation.
Somehow Draco's thoughts had drifted off. He hated the subject. Back when he was little his mother had shown him the star sign that he was named after.
“Fuck off, Malfoy. I was just-,” Harry wrecked his brain for an excuse, “ I was picking something up.”
It probably was a good thing that his father didn't witness this moment. Where was he anyway? He often left for a few days when he had work to do but still... This was his
Draco looked up and said with a blank face: “You’re like fungi. You think you’re finally rid of them and then they always find a way to come back.”
It was weird. A week earlier harry might have laughed at this. Or he would have been glad to be acknowledged at all. But this time it just… hurt. He sat there for a moment, not saying a word. Then he stood up to leave.
) and how they went past the three headed dog in the forbidden corridor and down the trap door, through different rooms with different challenges until he found Quirrell (
He said in a loud and clear voice and the last thing he saw before being sucked into the floo system was a glimpse of a black haired, small boy with a scar on his forehead who seemingly dreaded his return home so much that he looked like he was going to throw up. Draco's heart clenched at that and for a short period of time he felt like he couldn't breathe but actually these were probably symptoms of travelling with floo powder,
managed to get into trouble he would be the very first one to be attacked. He couldn't let that happen.
He had his head placed on Harry’s shoulder and therefore couldn’t see his face, but he could swear Harry was raising his eyebrow again. “Oh, really? About me?”
Harry was trying to process the fact that the boy he had just realized he had a crush on was holding his hand while he was doing his homework. Wouldn’t it be way harder to write that way? Did this mean something. All Harry knew was that Draco made him
And if you just so happened to leave a comment that would make me very happy and motivate me immensely to get back into a regular posting schedule for this fic :)
"What? You wanna eat this now? You really don't know about nothing, do you? I highly recommend for you to keep this one as long as possible. You probably won't get your hands on another one any time soon, Potter! It contains
upon Harry's glasses and soon they were off to Gringotts, right after Hermione had introduced them to her parents. When the Weasleys entered their vault, Harry was shocked. He’d known that they weren't particulary wealthy but he didn't epect that they only had a few galleons in total - which they all took to spend on school supplies this day, leaving the vault completely empty. Shame came over him when he stood in front of his own money, trying to hide the view of piles and piles of galleons and sickles and knuts from his friends. Somehow he wished he didn't own any of it and could just leave it to the Weasleys. But he knew they wouldn't take it. Hastily he stuffed a few coins of every sort into a small purse and then shuffled back out of the door. Relief flooded Harry when they finally were out in the Alley again but he still felt the shame prickling in his stomach.
Then Vernon grabbed a hold of him and forced him to his feet. Harry saw the room littered with tiny shards of dark glass punctuating his still bare feet which started to burn
but wanted to see the objects his father wanted to sell first. Also he wouldn't ever buy anything like
The youngest son just shrugged and walked towards the fireplace, grabbing a handful of the weird powder on his way. Mr Weasley put his hands onto Harry's shoulders from behind in a fatherly gesture which felt oddly right.
The black haired boy was still asleep, glasses resting on his nightstand. Then he spotted the presents. Draco's jaw dropped. How could it be that
When they arrived on Platform 9  3/4 Draco immediately spotted the white-blonde hair that certainly belonged to his parents. His heart gave a little jump of excitement.
This place was bloody creepy and in every other situation he'd have left but he felt like all power had been sucked away from him by this goddamned letter.
About an hour later they had finally made it to the top of the Astronomy tower where Harry took the invisibility cloak off of them and walked over to the edge to look out for a group of wizards flying towards them. He spotted them right above the forbidden forest.
And Ron had told him about all his older brothers being sorted into Gryffindor, so there was a good chance he would already have a friend there.
Before Harry could get confused about who was leading, Draco had placed both his hands on Harry’s shoulders. Once again, Harry cursed his uniform. While it would have been an extra distraction, Harry wouldn’t have minded feeling them through his unnecessary shoulder-pads.
By the way, the decorations in the hall were amazing. There were large carved pumpkins, hagrid sized, and living bats flying through the hall.
Knowing that he had to do this sooner or later he decided to get up and tell them he was fine again. As soon as his foot touched the ground he flinched back. Curiously he inspected the sole of his foot and found dried blood and some shards of broken glass sticking out of his skin. Pulling a face he cleared it from any pieces of medicine bottle before having another go at walking. Upon reaching the bathroom he realised it still probably was the same day because the floor was still the mess he’d made of it and Petunia would never let Dudley brush his teeth in a room like
It was nothing like any music he had ever listened to before. The first lines didn't even sound like real singing. Draco was just about to turn away when the Refrain came.
The troll's bat was lying on the floor between a lot of smaller pieces of wood and it's owner looked like he was about to fall over.
“Oh, it’s you.” Harry’s voice was thick with sleep, but Draco was sure he heard relief in it. A sleepy grin spread across Harry’s face. “G’Morning, gorgeous.”
Five minutes ago Draco would've thought that this day couldn't get any worse. Well, of course fate had to prove him wrong again. Now he was stuck up with Harry Bloody Potter, who had rejected his friendship-offer just an hour ago, for seven whole years. He was silent all the remaining time of the sorting (the stupid Weasley boy was Griffindor and Pansy and Blaise had been sorted into Slytherin, of course) and throughout the whole dinner.
When his left fist landed in the troll's eye, a huge hand grabbed him by his robes and lifted him into the air. Seemed like his plan had worked....kind of.
Then Harry also made his way to the Ravenclaw tower, up the spiral staircase and greeted Malfoy who was already trying to solve the door knockers riddle.
sitting on the ground. Blood rushed to his cheeks as Malfoy started laughing at him and even the more agreeable Blaise couldn’t suppress a smirk. Earlier he had been glad that the librarian was absent, but now he kind of wished she was there to shush them.
"Oops. You should've listened to me, Harry, sweetie! But, well, the spell will probably wear off in a few hours."
got in there, why didn't he? - and rolled his eyes at everyone who ended up in any other house. That was up until a little girl with long, dirty blonde hair, who had just been sorted into Ravenclaw, sat down right next to him. The girl was wearing radishes as earrings and a flower necklace. Well, they didn't lool like flowers usually looked like but he couldn't figure what else they were supposed to be. Her big eyes wandered over every inch of the great hall, taking in all of it, and inevitably landed on Draco, making her soft smile grow wider and her eyes shine brighter.
"Oh. Morning Malfoy. Have you seen Harry? I wanted to ask him something so I waited for him to show up but he didn't and I must've fallen asleep at some point."
"The school wards probably interfered with the radio connection. Try the tapes, they should be working!"
"Me as well. It looked fascinating how the players soared over the sky at the match. Must feel so much greater than having to fly in a height less than your own body height."
“Anyways, you came by to free Sirius Black. You came across my cell before you reached his and when I saw you, I walked straight through the bars and pulled you under one of the mistletoes.”
“I know how the machine works. If I wanted anything, I would get it myself.” The posh boy went back to reading.  “Besides, I’m not going to sully my body with filthy soft-drinks.”
hand, not the other way around. Draco had shortly thought about ignoring the rules and just sit with his friends at the Slytherin table but then he didn't want to get himself into trouble anytime soon.
Speaking of Padma, she was glaring at him with an accusing look on her face. As if he would lose all those points on purpose.
Strange. If anyone would have seen this door before, there would've clearly been rumours about it. How come he hadn't heard about it? And it also had never been mentioned in
As Draco glanced out the window a small smile played on his lips; the grounds were covered in a thin layer of snow. The Malfoy heir had always loved snow. His mother had used to go outside with him and help him building a snow-wizard. Lucius would watch them through the window and when the two of them came back inside, robes completely soaked, they would sit with each other on the green velvet couch by the fireplace and let themselves enjoy some hot chocolate with cream.
When Harry arrived at the cafeteria, he found them sitting at one of the round tables in the back. Draco was reading a book and Blaise was typing something on his phone. Harry made a mental note to thank Regulus on Sunday.
Besides, Pansy was probably even more of a bully than Malfoy was. Okay, maybe that was a bit of an exaggeration. But Harry could only imagine that in combination and close up with them, they would be a nightmare.
Wait, was he waiting for Harry to do something? Harry’s expression probably looked really stupid right then.
Ten minutes later, the last two members of the family arrived as well. Molly’s heart melted when Draco leaned down to hug her without her asking for it. She could feel how the poor, sweet boy finally became comfortable around her and this house in general.
She had finally found a book with information on Nicolas Flamel and they all agreed that that stone is what Fluffy was guarding. A stone with the power to make someone immortal and to transform any metal into pure gold. With all that information, why should she still do research?
“I’m sorry, Mr Malfoy, but all school brooms have to be of the same model and we need more than six. Also, these are racing brooms, designed for professional Quidditch players. I can’t just hand these to beginners.”
Draco just shook his head wondering what this girl could've wanted from Potter. Why the fuzz about him? After a moment of awkward silence he finally left the common room and the last thing he saw before closing the door behind him was Cho crouching over the leftovers of the ink bottle and pulling out her wand in order to clean up the mess.
. Taking a last glance at the clear blue summer sky, he hopped off the sill and closed the window behind him before making his way down to the kitchen. Another day in his living hell and it would be exactly like the last one and exactly like the ones that were coming. He just hoped that his friends could write soon. While he prepared breakfast he managed to slip one slice of bread into his back pocket as Petunia was calling for Vernon and
He hadn't done anything to deserve so much attention. But soon the happy atmosphere took onto him and he sat down on an empty chair (as far away from Malfoy as possible) with a huge grin on his face.
Despite all that, what was he supposed to do? Send him away? With what reasoning? It wasn't like he desperately wanted someone else to sit next to him. Of course, it would be the most preferable to work alone but sadly Severus usually wanted them to work in pairs so that wasn't an option. Also, doing things his father would approve of somehow didn't have the same appeal anymore. Therefore, he gave a shrug and set up his parchment and quill while Smith took a seat to his left.
This night Draco dreamed of speed and height and wind rushing in his ears and the feeling of the snitch fitting perfectly in his hand.
They spent all afternoon in Hagrid’s hut and talked about everything that had occurred so far. It showed that Hagrid already knew about their adventure of the last night which already seemed to have taken place weeks ago to Harry. Then the dog, Fang, started licking his hand and Harry suddenly remembered this morning's events.
in this forest! And what's with the thing that attacked the unicorn?! You'll never do this again, do you hear me?!
“So obviously we have to kiss. And we do until your annoying godfather interrupts us and reminds you of your mission. There are no dementors in this Azkaban by the way. Apparently, the prisoners just stay there because they were told to.”
Malfoy glanced up from his work to raise an eyebrow at him. “No thanks.” After several moments of silence, he averted his gaze again.
Some people started complaining and Harry was pretty sure Malfoy was one of them but the captain wouldn't have any of it.
Draco stumbled and almost fell onto his behind but the hand held him upright. Anyway this had created a loud sound and suddenly the three-headed creature lunged forwards and started to bark loudly.
“I’m coming over for lunch because your mother and I need to discuss some things about the presentation she will hold for my history 9th graders.”
Draco had never heard his father sound so small before and soon he heard footsteps coming closer. Silently he went into his room and lay down on his bed, not bothering to get under the covers, yet. It was too warm. There was a soft knock on his door. Then it was opened a split.
His voice was cold. Like absolute zero cold. Colder than anything Harry had ever gotten thrown at his head from him during all their years of intense rivalry.
After potions they had a double DADA with Lockhart. Draco really didn't get the hype about him. Yeah, fairly speaking the man was really handsome and his smile was dashing but apart from that the guy was just dull. What he wrote in his books was just as interesting as any special edition of the Witch Weekly's magazine and he sometimes literally nicked them from his mother to be able to fall asleep. How could a guy be so self absorbed that he started the class with a quiz about his personal pudding preferences and similar nonsense? Draco had been glad to find he hadn't been the only one rolling his eyes at Lockhart's comment of, “You should know, I was a Ravenclaw as well and now look where I am today!” As if Lockhart was a person to look up to.
when the alcohol of some kind of potion entered the small wounds. Overwhelmed from all the pain and dizzyness the world went black - this time for real. Harry was pretty sure he threw up again before he slipped into unconsciousness.
Harry agreed with him and started to argue that they should go back into the office again another day.
When he reached the Ravenclaw table, he sat down at the very end without caring who was sitting to his right or across from him.
Suddenly he was sitting upright on his bed, panting, eyes wide open, pupils blown wide, drenched in sweet. It had just been a dream. Just a nightmare. Not real. He didn't move. Just kept sitting there repeating it all over in his head.
Malfoy stopped laughing but the mockery in his face was still blatantly clear. “Oh, yeah? And what?” Harry tried and failed to give an equally snarky remark. Apparently, Malfoy didn’t feel like granting him a few extra moments for his brain to catch up. “Well, whatever it is, I doubt it will help you fix…” - he vaguely gestured at Harry’s body - “…all of that. Tell me, when was the last time you picked up a comb?”
They kept on discussing all the time during lunch. Harry had to admit, it sounded a bit ridiculous. A teacher trying to break into a guarded room inside the school? But after all, Snape didn't seem like any of the other teachers.
The hand didn't losen it's grip and so Draco was pulled into a run. They escaped the corridor and finally pushed the door shut behind them.
“Now, I want the rest of you to stand in groups, depending on which position you're trying out for.”
His mother had sent him another letter two weeks ago and assured him she was proud of him, although he'd been sorted into Ravenclaw.
“Harry, mate, some people are just assholes. His father is an asshole, so that’s probably how he inherited that shit.”
Usually Harry had at least an idea what the answer to the riddle could be and by now he even managed to answer most riddles correctly but
He ignored the voice. He had exchanged a few more letters with his mother since Christmas and she didn't once mention something like that. It would be okay.
They were standing in front of a small, cramped and dark room full of potion ingredients, potions and ancient looking books. In the middle there was a pitch black wooden desk and an equally black cabinet stood next to a black dresser.
Draco sighed and rolled his eyes for dramatic effect, but he never dropped his grin. Then he cuddled up with Harry, who was leaning against the headboard, and started talking.
"Please everybody follow your prefects back to your dormitories and stay close to each other. Slytherins, you will stay right in here together with Hagrid and and Professor Sprout, this will be the safest for you. The other teachers will please follow me to the dungeons. Stay inside your common room or dormitory until your head of house tells you otherwise. Go now!"
After an early breakfast on Saturday morning, Ron and Harry were strolling across the grounds towards the Quidditch pitch. The Gryffindor had insisted on watching the try outs as soon as Harry had mentioned it. He had tried to convince Hermione to join him, but apparently she wanted to get a headstart on studying. They had tried to tell her that she couldn't possibly have anything to study for on the first weekend of the year but she wouldn't have any of it. Therefore it was just the two of them.
He looked up at the other man’s face and found him smiling. Harry couldn’t recall ever having seen Draco Malfoy smile like that. It wasn’t like his polite and respectful and sometimes pitiful smiles that he wore at his workplace. It was… fond. Harry’s face started to warm up and he smiled back.
The whole group slowly set into motion. When Harry held one of the broomsticks tightly grasped in his right hand, excitement and nervosity set in at the same time. His heart rate sped up, it was like adrenaline was flooding his body and replacing the blood in his veins. He was totally focused on the wood in his palm and the ground under his feet. Cho, next to him, was rambling something he didn't quite gather as he threw one leg over the broom and bent his knees a little, ready to set off. And then the whistle blew and he was in the air instantly and it felt so good, so right and he loved being there.
Yawning he made his way back and entered the Ravenclaw common room behind his classmates. Most of them stayed down there until dinner but Harry just grabbed an interesting looking book and then headed straight for the dorm.
With a smile on his lips Harry entered and found everything in its place. His luggage was sitting next to his old bed. Hedwig's cage was empty. No wonder. She had been even more pissed off after their crash with the tree. Harry made a mental note to make it up to her the next day, right after he'd visited Hagrid. With a yawn he pulled his pajamas from his case and went to the bathroom to get ready for the night. Ten minutes later he finally sat down on his four poster when Draco stood in the doorway of their dorm. The following conversation was way too short and too similar to exchanges they'd had in the past that Harry didn't even bother interpreting Draco's mood swings. Right then he was way too tired for this bullshit.
"Dobby is very sorry, Sir. When he checked yesterday, the boy was still cruelly locked away, but as he returned today, he and his things were gone and the Muggles were very angry."
He had spent breakfast with his friends from Slytherin. His best friend Pansy who he'd grown up with, agreed with his opinion on the sorting.
With a wide grin on his face, Draco stretched his neck to steal another kiss from Harry. Then he made himself comfortable in the other man’s arms again.
He didn't want to spend Halloween silent and on his own, so why not telling her what she wanted to know.
from the depths of his trunk. He had read all of it before the start of first year, but he couldn’t remember it saying anything about a room that appeared as required. He figured that maybe he had just missed it the first time.
on the bundle of brooms and followed her. When everything was safely stored in a broom cupboard, Draco grew impatient.
But then first the handshake thing and then the sorting and he was just full of it and it was just their first real day here.
At this moment they were sitting huddled together with the Weaslebee in their corner of the Astronomy classroom.
A lump had built up in his throat while reading and he felt tears welling up as his excitement shattered into daggers, piercing his heart. His eyes watering, he turned around on the spot and rushed out of the hall.
Excited, Harry took one of the presents, a small one from the top, and ripped off the ugly, brown wrapping material. A note was sticking to the self made bonbons. It said:
Although the voice sounded rather inviting, the use of his name - his first name in particular - made a cold shudder run down his spine.
Once again Draco was at a loss for words. He just kept staring at him in disbelief. Eventually he too returned to his homework.
As if he, Harry, of all people should be the one person to know this stuff although nobody had ever told him about any of it.
The other students had stopped doing their thing and curiously watched the scene. Harry could've sworn he heard Malfoy snicker from the back but did his best to ignore it. Finally Professor Flitwick approached them.
Cho's face fell a tad and she looked like she was about to say something, but she got cut off before she was able to.
She led him to another broom cupboard and opened it. Then she stepped aside and suddenly all the pieces fell into place. His voice was croaky and tiny as he swore, “Fucking Salazar.”
Words written with white chalk had appeared on the blackboard and Quirrell nervously tapped his foot standing next to it supervising their work.
This was the first time Harry got an invitation. A warm feeling filled up his chest. He'd finally found friends.
Harry gave Padma, who had asked the question, a confused look. The girl just pointed at Ron and Hermione sitting next to each other, the former patting the latter's back. Of course, the two of them would have to sit out for a while.
Harry placed his books back in his locker. He didn’t actually need his homework done until after the weekend.
For a moment Draco kept hesitating, but then he gave in and followed Pansy into the bathroom. Maybe it was time. He’d bought the dress four years ago and up until now he had always chickened out last minute whenever there had been a fitting event. After everything he had done during the war… let’s just say it wasn’t so pleasant anymore to be recognized by other wizards or witches.
Harry didn’t think after this interaction he would’ve been able to get any school stuff done anyways. He did not feel bad for spending the entire time in the library letting his mind wander and letting his eyes take in every detail of Draco’s face.
"Of course they will. And if I fail something my father will pull some strips at the ministry and I'll be fine. He's more or less the minister's right hand at the moment. Fudge even trusted him with some top secret business which he had to attend to over Christmas. I asked him if I could help but sadly that couldn't be arranged so I had to stay at Hogwarts for the holidays. But he promised if there was a chance coming up in the future I will definitely be a part of the operation."
Back to the usual now apparently. A smile tucked at Harry’s lips as he watched the bickering unfold.
Ignoring his heart beating painfully against his chest he slowly pulled the door open and peered into the corridor. At first it was too dark to see anything. The only difference was that the snores got louder. He deeply regretted not trying harder to master Lumos last summer.
Yes, Draco found dark magic fascinating and he admired his father a lot but risking innocent lives was another thing completely. Also, Draco didn't have much to do anyways and he had a private library - a really big one - at hand, so, why not?
“Oh, you brought him with you this time? How lovely!” Then she opened her arms for Oliver who was just coming up the front steps. “It’s been too long, my dear boy! I’m happy you could make it tonight.”
His mother had bought it for him so he'd have something to read when he needed time on his own at school.
He gave a nod and Ron threw the powder into the fireplace which suddenly lit up in bright green flames. Harry almost screamed when Ron stepped into them, but the boy seemed totally fine and his clothes didn't even catch fire!
Crabbe and Goyle immediately believed his story as well. Only Blaise shot him a weird glance but the expression disappeared when Draco pulled off his trademark smirk.
(They decided to not bother about Quirrell for now because he seemed harmless and had probably been dragged into all of this by Snape anyways.)
he said with mockery in his voice before sitting down with a casual smirk planted on his lips. Potter didn't seem to be bothered by this nickname in any way at all.
Not even mentioning the letter he got from the ministry for performing magic outside of school in the presence of muggles when it had actually been some weird house elf called
that he almost didn’t notice the tiny man approaching the victim of Draco’s death glare. It was Flitwick and after the Charms teacher had exchanged a few words with Potter and the Weasel, they both wore exasperated expressions while the mudblood seemed to be happy and smug about it. It was probably about detention for the flying-a-muggle-vehicle-to-school thing, Draco figured. A smirk tugged at the corner of his lips. Whatever it was, it served the two of them just right. At that, he rose to his feet abruptly, dropped the rest of his bread back onto his plate and left the hall.
"He only used it on me once. I wanted him to play with me and ran into his office. I broke this weird and dark looking box and he got so angry. I don't even know why, there was only a book in it. And from what I saw when I was trying to pick it up there wasn't even a single word written in it. But he got so damn angry and he lost control."
Harry really didn't understand. But it hurt to see the blonde leaving him alone like that. Pushing it aside he put a smile on and made his way to his friends.
End of November came and suddenly everyone was in Christmas mood. Seemed like this atmosphere had even reached the house elves; the Ravenclaw common room was littered with branches of mistletoe, lametta and fairy lights, which eagerly illuminated books and parchments for everyone reading or doing homework at night.
He had just finished that thought when Malfoy suddenly swerved left. Harry was confused at first but two seconds later followed sue hastily. Apparently, in the heat of the competition, he had forgotten to count the rest of his laps. In the center of the pitch he finally set down. He looked at Malfoy, expecting him to use that opportunity to mock him but the other boy wasn't even acknowledging him. Instead he angrily glared at the only player who had already been waiting there. It was a relatively short but clearly muscular guy who was currently putting his long, ruffled, wavy black hair back into a bun, revealing an undercut. He was good looking. A strong jawline, a small nose and  dark eyes which were covered by eyelids that Harry was pretty sure were typical for people with Japanese ancestry.
that lingered around here, that he was superior to them in every way possible. Just like he had learned it from his father. The store that was their destination was definitely the most clean and safe-looking place there was in this Alley. Actually it was like a very dark verion of a Diagon Alley shop. Weird, unnatural, valuable, beautiful and scary objects were presented in the shop window. Finally they entered and Draco didn't take in Lucius' warning to not touch anything due to a distraction. And even though everything in this shop was fascinating and at least partially desirable, it was not what had distracted him. No, but in the far corner of the shop there was a tall, wooden cabinet and Draco could've sworn that he saw a movement over there just a moment ago. Then, the shop owner turned up and he decided to investigate upon that suspiscous movement as soon as his father was caught up in the transactions.
Oh. He contemplated the thought to just ignore her question and tell her, it was none of her business - it wasn't, after all - but she was right. He was tired. Too tired to stand up against her.
) but at least they didn't question what he was saying like Blaise sometimes did. The dark skinned boy had been sitting in the corner of the same room with Theo Nott, occasionally throwing weird glances at the three of them. After quite some time the portrait hole had opened to reveal Pansy and Daphne Greengrass. When they had spotted Draco in the Center of attention, the latter had scrunched her nose and excused herself to bed while the former girl had joined their group excitedly. In the beginning they had talked about how Dumbledore had been missing at dinner and thought up theories as to why that was. Soon they'd ended up only insulting their headmaster and this school in general and how Durmstrang was way superior. More than once Draco had stood up saying he needed to get back before curfew even though he'd been having loads of fun but Pansy had always insisted he should stay a little longer.
In the end the evening was very nice and Draco smiled while he was getting ready for bed. When he came out of the bathroom, damp hair and pajamas on, he heard angry voices coming from downstairs echoing through the halls of Malfoy Manor. Curious, he went towards the staircase to hear what they were saying.
Between the girls there were lying some notes, written in beautiful handwriting, and some ancient looking books were open on their laps, reminding him of Hermione when she was doing homework. Yet what they did didn't look like homework at all.
Narcissa's soft voice tore Draco from his sleep gently. Slowly he blinked his eyes open to be greeted by his mother's beautiful smile.
He should have expected something like that. But he really didn't want to tell them somehow. Especially Ron wouldn't be able to understand.
Oliver huffed a laugh. “You are a sap. And you have convinced me. But let me change into something proper first, alright?”
He searched his brain to the last corner but he didn't know any spells to enable him to open this door. In another wave of anger he just kicked against it with a loud
More like the kind of magic that filled the halls of Hogwarts. The kind that made the ceiling above his head look like the cloudy nightsky and made the candles and carved pumpkins float through the hall.
Surpressing his anger he shot a glance into his cauldron. The liquid inside had a sick orange color and thick clumps were swimming on the surface while it should be a clear deep red shade by now.
There's no chance his father would accept such a shame. That's what Draco was. A shame for his whole bloodline!
It's not very likely that two first years manage to defeat an adult troll. Each of you will receive ten points for their house. But don't expect to always get this lucky!"
The two fighting boys turned to look at what had caused the sound and about two seconds later the blonde one was eye to eye with Harry.
Of course he would end up in the hospital wing. Straitening his back he left the room asking himself as to why he had even been there but the truth was that suddenly a huge weight had been lifted off his shoulders.
He ended up putting them behind a couch table that was placed on its side and covered the whole thing by draping an old rug over it. Then he turned on the spot, burning the exact position into his retinas before making his way back out of the room. He didn’t need to look back to know that the gate had faded the moment it had closed.
“I’m just- I don’t know. What if they think I’m not the right one for you? I mean, we’re so different and… yeah. I know it’s stupid.”
His face lit up in a smile an he jumped to his feet exitedly. Harry put on his robes in a rush and made his way down to the great hall.
"It was my fault! I’ve read so much about trolls... I thought I could defeat one on my own. The two of them saved me."
only got six presents for Christmas?! And only two of them were bigger than a book! Suddenly he felt very sorry. He'd never doubted that the famous Harry Potter was loved by everyone and would surely receive a lot of presents. He himself had about twenty five. It was not fair!
Draco thought back to the events of the previous night and smiled. Full of hope he leaned forward, gently touching Harry’s waist with his right hand. Harry smiled back and met him in the middle. Their mingling morning breath wasn’t particularly pleasant, but the feeling of Harry’s lips pressed against his totally made up for it. After a blissful moment Harry broke the kiss and raised an eyebrow at Draco.
Cho smiled up at Harry, looking excited as well but in a more shy way. She was indeed a very beautiful girl.
Hermione Granger’s voice echoed in Draco’s head, permanently carved into his brain ever since she said those words. He probably didn’t deserve her kindness either.
are always staying late when you don’t have any afternoon classes. Waiting for some special friends? Enjoying my company immensely?”
Did she just call him by his first name? What an audacity! He was a Malfoy! She was to show respect towards him!
With fast steps he walked over to her and let her in, breathing in the fresh, chilly autumn air, which smelled damp and clear, due to yesterday's storm.
She named the positions while pointing in a different direction each and the players did as told. Truthful to Cho's word the majority grouped in the seekers’ corner. No one went for beater. The captain pulled her eyebrows together at that, but moved on fast.
This chapter is kind of a mess and I’m not sure I did the accent well enough so if you had struggles or thoughts while reading this, please comment!
He was supposed to be on top of every class! And then this mudblood came along, correcting the Weasel's pronounciation, and immediately performed it perfectly!
Percy smiled tensely. He did not mean for this conversation to come up right now. But apparently it had to be said now. It was probably long overdue after two months of dating. Gently, he took Oliver’s hand into his and kissed the back of it.
Harry walked over to her with his throat closing up. When he stood in front of her she looked him up and down. Then she opened up the chest again and pulled out one of the beaters clubs.
I hope you all are well and safe during all this pandemic stuff. I’ll try to have the next chapter up ASAP but no promises <3 Love, as always, goes especially to everyone who comments!!!
After a bit Harry raised his head and locked eyes with Draco. He immediately turned away, towards Pansy.
Harry turned around to find that Ron -or rather the whole Weasley family- were gathered a few meters in front of them. In an instant Mrs Weasley was at his side, fussing over him.
This evening Hedwig was a happy owl and Harry didn't even get scolded for taking so long. Turns out they had been at the swimming hall with some of Dudley's bully friends.
He'd drawn these conclusions from old newspapers and medical reports of attacks at Hogwarts. Most of them were about 50 years old, a time where there were rumours of the chamber being "active". Draco was really a little concerned as to why his father had copies of hogwart's medical reports of a time when he hadn't even gone to school but he didn't give it too much thought. Much rather he was happy to have the information and used it well for his research. While he was scanning about every magical creatures and beasts books there were in the shop, there was excited chatter and giggling travelling upstairs from the main event. It was annoying but Draco tried to fade the noise out to his best. It was working and he made great progress until there was a shout.
“I have you know, I used to play Seeker for Ravenclaw as well. That is why I came here, to see if the team is still as great as it was back then, with me to hold it up and together!”
Marietta, Cho's best friend, had spotted him and indicated to him to join them, where the two of them were sitting on a sky-blue love seat.
! He didn't have much time to be thrown off, though, because in that moment the delicious feast appeared on the platters. Draco realized he was practically starving and immediately tucked in. In an elegant way of course. Not like the Weasel with no manners at all. Talking of the Weasel; he too was nowhere to be seen. Only four redheads were stuffing themselves with food at the Gryffindor table. His gaze fell on the brunette girl next to them. Granger looked lost and restless and she was nervously fumbling with her red and gold tie.
It was then, when Harry had spoken, that he realised that he was surrounded by all four of his roommates. Staring at him in shock, with white faces. Feeling exposed he snapped,
Exitedly he sat up and reached for one of the smaller packages on the top. These were most likely sweets. Before he ripped it open though, he glanced over to the bed next to his. It had grown to a bit of an habit to check on H-... Potter.
When she had finished she smiled at him and reached into the pocket of her robes. Out she pulled a small pocket mirror and held it out to him.
Finally back in his dorm he let himself fall onto his bed and reached for the book on top of the stack he had neatly piled on his bedside table.
The silence that followed was heavy and persistent. It was a relief to hear the bell ring, announcing the end of classes for the day. At the same time Harry was reluctant to leave. He didn’t want to lose all that progress that he’d made. It wasn’t like he had much of a choice though.
by naming the dots representing stars. They now had their Astronomy lessons right after dinner at 7pm when it was already completely dark outside to make use of what they had learned in their theory lessons. Their assignment was to copy down one of the constellations they could make out in the night sky above them and to label everything correctly. Hermione was already finished at this point, ten minutes into the lesson, which earned her ten points for Gryffindor. Ron and Harry had only just started off with some dots of ink seemingly randomly placed all over their parchment. They weren't as skilled in multitasking as Hermione was and this conversation was pretty important in their opinion.
Someone from inside must have let him in! He looked up and opened his mouth to share his theory when he remembered his fathers words.
Harry couldn't remember ever being sick before in his entire life and suddenly he really wished he was back at Hogwarts again. He could just go to Madam Pomfrey and in no time he would be perfectly well again.
“I-,” Harry started but he wasn’t sure how to complete that sentence. So, he gave it another try: “Since there’s no one else here, I was wondering if I could keep you two some company?”
Harry nodded  and she went to the back of the shop before returning with a box the size of maybe a watermelon.
And what he found wasn't pleasing at all. There weren't many books about said chamber. The only information he got was that it was a hidden chamber in Hogwarts, built by
“Professor Lockhart! You are very welcome to watch the try outs but please clear the field and join the other spectators in the stands. Thank you, Professor.”
. Exactly what he needed. An outfit like this made it so much easier to fulfil his father's expectations.
Draco sneered, probably thinking he had won this round, and followed Blaise to a table in the farthest corner.
“But we are different. You know, you are you and you are amazing and you have a good job and you always do the right thing and I’m just that guy who’s good at volleyball. What if- what if they think I’m not good enough for their perfect angel?”
The following weeks all went in a pretty similar fashion: Waking up, making breakfast, doing chores, avoiding the Dursleys and so on.
Harry was about to snap back when he remembered his mission. He raked a hand through his messy curls. What was the best way to go about this?
So they did. Draco threw a handful of the dark powder into the fireplace and easily stepped into the cold, green flames.
Harry’s hand found Draco’s naked shoulder by accident and instinctively he broke the kiss to leave a trail of pecks and maybe one or the other hickey all along Draco’s neck, down to his collarbone.
Everytime his fingertips brushed the expensive parchment he felt a rush of confidence and happiness going through his body.
Professors McGonagall, Snape, Quirrell and Flitwick were also standing in the corridor, eyes moving from the three students to the unconscious troll on the bathroom floor.
Draco settled down between a fourth year and a sixth year. They were the least likely to start a conversation with him. Everytime Potter looked at him with concern after what had happened, he felt the strong urge to just tell him everything or let himself being hold by him.
Harry dared sneaking a glance at him. Possibly a mistake. The look in his eyes was paralyzing. The cold colour of his irises nicely complimenting the reddish hue on his cheekbones. In that moment Harry didn’t have the mental capacity to wonder about that. He gulped and forced his mouth to form words.
Draco's heart lurched. Harry's family was even worse than he'd thought. Would he be fine? He shook his head to come back to senses. Better than if he returned to Hogwarts. Much safer at least.
Memories of Blaise, Theo and him sneaking away from stupid dinner parties, of his mother reading to him, of afternoons with hot chocolate after playing in the snow...
After dinner Harry hurried to return to the Ravenclaw common room to finish some essays they had been assigned to do over the holidays. Maybe if his roommates saw him putting some effort into his potions work, they would change their attitude towards him.
He came up blank. The only movement visible on Draco’s face were his unnaturally beautiful grey eyes tracing the words in his book. A good minute passed in which Harry simply continued staring. Then Draco slowly raised one of his eyebrows and even though he didn’t look at him, Harry knew it was directed at him. He turned away and gulped. Why was his throat so dry?
glasses. In a High School cafeteria. Whoever had come up with that genius idea.) he hesitated. Then he shrugged to himself, grabbed two and went back to Draco’s table.
That's what Harry did to make living here a little more bearable. Every day he set his alarm clock for right about dawn so that he could enjoy a few hours to himself in peace before the Dursleys would wake up. He watched the sun rising higher and higher, lost in the moment, when there was an intense knock on his door. Closing his eyes he let his head fall back against the wall and sighed.
With that, she directed an advanced levitation spell at the huge chest and started walking off the pitch. Scowling, Draco cast
“And even if he was wearing nice clothes, his hair would ruin everything,” Draco finished his tirade.
Someone was saying his name but he didn't care because it wasn't Cho. Then someone appeared right in front of him.
As he didn't know the other two, he came to the conclusion that they weren't pure bloods. At least not part of the sacred 28 families. He gave Boot a short nod and then walked up the staircase,  reaching their dorm first.
"Of course, master Draco, Sir. Dobby didn't have the right. Please forgive Dobby for being so impolite."
had realised this and had started to tell him jokes. A lot of jokes. Bad ones and good ones but somehow all of them were funny. And Draco had laughed and school had been forgotten. When he climbed the stairs to their dormitory he heard voices behind the door.
It was only on the next morning that he realised that Hedwig hadn't had anything to eat that day and he made a mental note to himself to buy some bird treats from the 5 pound note he had gotten for Christmas as soon as he came across an animal store. A supermarket would probably do as well.
. Afterwards they travelled back home and Draco took his new broom outside to fly a bit about their grounds while his mother was watching him fondly but also sadly. He could've sworn he also saw a glimpse of anger in her eyes.
So he had to explain everything, though he left out the part that Malfoy had been involved. That wasn't his story to tell. Anyway, he wondered why Malfoy had been there himself. When he'd finished it was quiet.
, after all he didn't seem to be a person who was enjoying their life. She hadn't found anything, yet. Neither had the two boys been successful.
He closed his eyes in anticipation and took a deep breath to calm down. The less sleep he gets, the shorter his temper. And he hadn't slept at all in at least 22 hours. Draco raised his foot and looked down at what used to be an ink bottle. He was about to leave it be and continue his way to the door when he heard a soft but high voice speak up.
The one on monday had been enough for the next couple of months. It had reminded him horribly of the time at the Dursleys where he had to kneel on the floor to clean something and was either being ignored or insulted. Yeah Malfoy was back to that again, as well. Harry really couldn't remember to have made a mistake. The second present from Malfoy he'd put into his trunk without unwrapping it. There it lay next to Hermione's book, the cloak and the note that had came with it. It didn't bear a signature but it said that the useful item had once been his father's. Therefore he'd sworn himself to always look after it and never, not in a thousand years, lose it. The only good thing that came from that detention was, that he had found a special trophy in the room. Dedicated to James Potter for scoring 25 goals as a chaser all by himself in one single match with less than 2 hours playing time. In this moment Harry had decided to do
But it seemed like neither of them were feeling like answering. Anger was boiling inside Harry and he turned towards Malfoy, ready to question him about why the hell he'd been following him, but when he found the other boy pale and staring blankly at the door knocker he just couldn't.
Smiling like a madman and also kind of nervous he crossed the entrance hall and walked through the huge doorway.
. Suppressing the urge to cry and scream he settled for kicking his bed post instead. He groaned in pain. This was the first and probably last time he’d ever thank his parents for forcing him to always wear shoes - even in his own bedroom.
or only throw a questioning glance at them and then receive an answer by a few raised fingers. They wouldn't exchange any more words (though she kept babbling about random things while she was working). They would only help each other out in potions. They were certainly not friends. First of all, he didn't even know her name, only that her last name was Langdorn because that was what Professor Snape called her. And secondly, his father would not at all approve of that and there was no doubt that he would find out if either Severus or any other Slytherin would catch on to that relationship.
“But I’ve never done anything to him. I just want to know why!” He slammed his own locker door to underline his words. Hermione glared at him and he would probably have apologized if it wasn’t for Ron.
And, when he thought about it, a castle where hundreds of pupils lived, should be safe enough to keep out a stupid troll, shouldn't it?
) and how he then got the stone out of the mirror of Erised and Quirrell attacked him and he fainted before Dumbledore got him out of there.
And that damn dress absolutely broke down all of the walls Harry had built up. Before he could talk himself out of it again, he started walking over to the table of the three with a quick step. On his way he grabbed himself one of the lilac drinks. Some extra courage wouldn’t hurt.
The last two players landed next to the crowd and Darcy clapped her hands again, calling for silence.
Oh and her voice. It was like angels singing a symphony. Like pure magic. Something was squirming in Harry's stomach when Cho grabbed his hand, pulling him towards the boy's staircase. Before he had caught on to what was happening she had pushed him inside his dormitory with a muttered "sorry" and closed the door behind him.
“So, you’re just casually wasting two hours of your day because your scared of walking home on your own?”
Exams were finally over and Draco was pretty sure he did very well in all of them. Well, except for astronomy maybe but who cares for that nonsense? He had also managed to treat Potter and his friends the way his father would approve of even though every insult that came back from
"Tha's Fluffy! He's mine! I borrowed him to Dumbledore so he could guard the... I shouldn't have said that! I should NOT have said that! See, is almost dinner time, you lot gotta go now!
“I have a list and my list says this is the movie for tonight. Tough luck if that doesn’t fit your wishes. Not my fault that your mother insisted on Bridget Jones last week.”
Once again, Draco was disappointed. The only options for lunch that day were meat loaf and tomato soup. Draco hated meat loaf. And tomato soup. So, he glared at Potter and his friends, who were just then entering the hall, while Pretending that Pansy, Blaise and even Crabbe weren’t throwing him curious glances. He didn’t exchange a single word with them, only nibbling on a slice of bread and sipping some pumpkin juice, his glare relentlessly fixed on the Ravenclaw beater. The idiot didn’t deserve to be that good at it on his first try. He was so fixated on
He found the painting on the seventh-floor corridor with the guy dancing with the trolls and paced back and forth a few times. Sometimes it took a little for the light brown wooden door to appear. But the door that finally appeared, wasn’t the one he usually found there. Instead, there was an ancient, tall gate with heavy and dark wing doors. Taken aback by this turn of events he lost his focus and six black brooms cluttered to the ground. Slowly, Draco stepped forward and pushed against one of the wings. It opened easily.
Harry sat on his bed, gaze fixed upon the book in his lap. He turned the page and found yet another picture of his parents. This time they were standing in the snow and a blonde woman was with them. All three of them seemed to be about 17 years old and they were waving into the camera happily.
First Harry didn't know who to sit with, so he chose to sit down alone at a table in the second row.
She waved it off and took the money while Harry stared at her in wonder, about to complain. He wanted to pay for everything!
Slowly Draco raised his hand and softly caressed Harry’s face with his fingertips. Just to make sure he was actually there. Harry stirred and his eyes were wide open in a matter of seconds. Damn it.
? Even if Draco could concentrate on stupid planet positions, he still wouldn't bother to pay attention. When the bell rang he left the classroom with an empty parchment.
The brothers he all knew from school already, except the very oldest one. But neither Bill nor Charlie were in town as they both worked abroad so Harry didn't get the chance to meet him. He also would've liked to thank Charlie for his help with a certain Dragon Problem. Seemed like he had to do that another time.
The first lesson of the year was Charms with the Gryffindors. As the students filed into the classroom Professor Flitwick was already waiting behind his desk, probably standing on a stack of books. Hermione attempted to pull her friends to the front but Harry and Ron struggled against her and the trio eventually settled for the third row. Harry happily took the middle seat in between the two Gryffindors and waited for the lesson to begin. The moment Flitwick cleared his throat a last student tumbled into the room. And of course it was Draco Malfoy. He didn't apologize, he just went to sit in the last free chair in the very back corner and Flitwick let it slide, simply pretending nothing had happened at all. Maybe because it was the first lesson of the year or maybe because he didn't want to take points from his own house as his first act of the year. Harry didn't know, neither did he really care about the answer. The question he was wondering about instead was, what had Malfoy been up to already? What could he have been doing? Because he was very certain he hadn't seen him at breakfast. While all of this Slytherin friends had been there.
It took Harry a solid five minutes to realize he wouldn’t come up with anything better, before he crossed the room as well. He pulled out the chair next to Blaise, sat down and waited for their reactions. Malfoy looked at him as if he were an alien. Blaise raised one of his immaculate eyebrows and then simply went back to work with an amused expression. When Harry turned to Draco again, he was still staring. Harry felt embarrassment crawling under his skin.
He was currently lying on his bed, reading, while every now and then throwing a glance at Har- Potter. The black-haired boy seemed pretty nervous. He was always looking at his rather old and ugly watch, obviously waiting for something. Suddenly he jumped to his feet, pulling something out of his trunk. Then Draco recognized the silver material. It was the invisibility cloak Harry had gotten for Christmas. Draco almost smiled in memory of that morning but soon enough he remembered in what it had ended and got angry at Potter again.
Hedwig hopped onto Harry's outstretched arm, flapping her wings slightly and let him take a short note out of her beak. Then she went to nibbling his earlobe affectionately. The note, judging by the unruly handwriting and the huge amount of misspellings, was from Hagrid, saying that he'd like to meet him after the Quidditch game and that Harry should visit him with his friends in his hut.
Harry had failed his self-set task miserably. He had not gotten Draco to talk to him again, instead he had only made it worse - he didn't even know
The sound of coins rattling against metal walls and a can of coke clunking to the bottom of the machine were irritatingly loud in the quiet of the cafeteria. He took his purchase and remembered that the stuff here wasn’t even cooled down. With a sigh he came to terms with having to drink room-temperature coke. There were worse things. When he walked past the table offering tab water and glasses (
Soon he was tucked in soft sheets and he didn't know when exactly but he drifted off into dream filled slumber. Dreams of sleek black hair and soft skin touching his hand.
He sneaked a glance at Blaise’s textbook. Astrophysics. Harry was glad he didn’t take that. It looked really complex. There was apparently a ridiculous amount of maths involved. Not just pretty pictures of planets and galaxies with latin names.
"So you saw the door open and decided it would be a great idea to just check what in there could be so dangerous before closing the the door?"
He was so stunned that he totally forgot why he was here in the first place. Until the door fell shut in his back and he suddenly got aware again of the letter which was still clutched in his right hand, the expensive parchment crumpled. Draco gulped and slumped onto the couch facing the crackling fire.
There was the sound of rustling and pictures being taken and applause and Draco just tried to ignore it all. Just as he was about to give up he found something. A
Harry left the library with a feeling of triumph. He couldn’t wait to tell Hermione and Ron about this.
Harry felt like the luckiest boy alive. He was still here. After all that had happened, not only the day before but throughout the course of his life, he was standing here, a young, learning wizard in a magical castle, surrounded by (mostly) friends.
Finally the train arrived at Kings Cross and Draco walked over to his parents, suitcase in hand, without granting his friends a goodbye. Something in his mother's expression was expectant but Draco turned his attention towards his father first.
Draco bit his lip and rolled his eyes. He loved rolling his eyes with a passion. “There might have been a few sexy ones, but I’m definitely not going to tell you about them.”
them out loud! Once he had caught himself really actually doing just that while taking a shower and almost banged his head against the nearest wall to punish himself like a house elf. Yes, that was how pathetic he felt.
They had Transfiguration with the Slytherins and although McGonagall was pretty strict and kept her classroom silent most of the time, Harry could hear Draco and his friends whispering insults towards him and sniggering every time he failed to transfigure his match into a needle.
Nononononono! This couldn't be happening. It was his first day at Hogwarts and everything went wrong already.
Percy had explained that you only have to sit at your own table at feasts like Halloween or end of year.
Everyone would be in danger. Except the Slytherins. If this chamber had been built by Salazar he surely wouldn't hurt the students of his own house. And Draco was sure that he himself would be safe as well as his father would never set something free that could be hurting his only son.
A sob escaped his throat and he pressed a hand against his mouth to stifle it. With all willpower he forced the tears back down.
After he had downed the drink he moved into the least crowded corner of the ballroom and leaned against the wall. He would have slouched but that was hardly possible in his stiff uniform. That damn uniform! It wasn’t even practical! It looked impressive and every now in then the special protection was strong enough to hold off a curse he didn’t deflect in time but apart from that it was just stiff and itchy and way too tight around the neck. He couldn’t wait to quit this job as soon as another opportunity would open itself up.
Harry also wished them a good nights sleep and made his way up the Ravenclaw tower. Surprisingly Malfoy was already up in their dorm. He'd seen Terry, Anthony and Michael sitting together in the common room, probably studying and eagerly ignoring him.
Draco stared at the light brown wood of the door way longer than he should've before carefully lifting the door knocker and letting it do it's job. If felt weird being back here after those months. But
“Okay, fine. You’re not on probation. But get these out of my sight and talk to your father, alright?”
The following week Draco kept to an ideal plan: no rule breaking, insulting Harry and his friends as often as possible, not talking to anyone except his Slytherin friends.
"Calm down Ronald. He won't get into this school. Dumbledore is here, and everyone knows that Dumbledore is the one wizard whom
“Yeah, haha. Well, I think I guessed I would see you here. You weren't exactly shy about your love for the Tornados.”
“Great. Everyone, grab a broom and get started. Ten laps, set off on my whistle, when you're done come back here and wait for the rest. Got that?”
She raised her wand and Draco hadn’t had the power to complain. He still mistrusted her magical hairstyling abilities a bit, though.
Curious, Draco spun aroun and looked after his godfather. Yes, he definitely was injured on the left leg. Shortly the thought flicked through his mind, to just ask the Professor about it after class but he shook it off in no time.
"Parvati said she's crying there. Harry, she didn't leave the bathroom since Charms! She doesn't know about the troll!"
Suddenly a thin hand softly squeezed his in a grateful gesture, took the glasses and pulled back again. For about a minute Draco just kept standing right there, frozen in his tracks but all warm and fuzzy on the inside. Then, pushing these sensations to the back of his mind, he continued to take in all the magical artefacts in the shop until his father calles him to go.
For several minutes after that he strolled through the castle aimlessly, wrecking his head for a solution. Somehow, he ended up in the entrance hall, where his stomach immediately reacted to the amazing smell of food wafting over from the great hall. Was it lunchtime already?
Imma try to update as often as possible so that soon I’ll be able to post new chapters on here at the same time as I post them to Wattpad. I’m going for about 3 every day.
It seemed like it wasn't forbidden to sit at different house's tables. Harry could make out some of the older Hufflepuffs sitting at the Ravenclaw table.
He kept staring at her, mouth agape. But Loony didn't seem to mind all that much. Not having received any reply, she just went back to watching all the people at the different house tables, swinging her legs happily. When Draco realized he'd been staring for more than a minute, he shook his head and opted for paying attention to the ceremony instead. It was almost over and soon the last girl was to be called up.
"What the bloody hell were you talking to Malfoy about, mate? And since when do you two talk at all?"
And so they did and soon the Hogwarts Express caught up to them. Now they could safely go back up above the clouds and just check if the train was in sight every once in a while. All in all, the flight was nice. The landing on the other hand was a total mess. They'd been already above the grounds when the car decided to give up. It was just their luck that they ended up in a tree. A very aggressive tree at that. From the moment they had spotted the castle to where they now sat in Snape's office they had went form the most euphoric to the most miserable they had ever been in the span of one hour. In the chaos Ron's wand hat been snapped in half, only held together by a last string from the core. Both of them had several bruises all over and the Gryffindor had a bleeding nose. And on top of everything they were probably going to be expelled. Harry didn't want to go back to the Dursleys!
This was so strange. The voice sounded neiher male nor female, nor could he locate where it came from. Draco considered questioning
Kind-of-introducing-my-OC-in-this-chapter-but-actually-not-really-but-yeah. I love her so be excited for more.
It's been more than a whole ass year and i deeply apologize for that. I graduated from Highschool and am now going to University and I am getting into a new routine of sorts, so I hope you won't have to wait all too long for updates from now on. I know I may have lost a few readers but that doesn't matter. If you are still here and enjoying my writing, I hold all the love in the world for you!
While the others started discussing Harry's whereabouts during the troll attack in low voices, Draco reached for some parchment, ink and his quill on his nightstand to write a letter to his parents. He knew his father would probably make a big fuzz about a troll being able to get inside Hogwarts but sooner or later he would find out anyway.
nobody would be looking for him in a place that they didn't even know. With confident steps he strode towards it and tried to push it open. It didn't move a bit. With a second glance he examined the door further. No handle, no key hole. Only the inscription and a simple, circular door knocker.
But Harry, without paying any attention to the curious and expecting glances from the others, went over to his trunk, grabbed his pajamas and disappeared inside the bathroom.
The room was giant. Grander than any other room Draco had ever been in - and he had been to the Ministry of Magic before. The walls were so far into each direction, it seemed to have none at all! And it was filled with piles over piles of everything.
This boy sleeping on the bed next to his own had saved his life. He'd mostly treated him with respect and sometimes even care while he'd been insulting him for months.
A few things, he'd shared with his friends but none of them had an idea what had happened to his godfather's leg. Most of the thoughts he had to keep to himself.
That sounded ridiculous but Harry had always studied in the company of his two best friends. And he did not actually intend on changing that now. The reason he was on the way to the library was because he had a mission. A challenge he had set for himself, driven by curiosity and boredom.
Their potion didn't get any better in the remaining half an hour -if it hadn’t even got worse- and Harry was truly relieved when the bell rang and he was finally able to storm out.
When the first sun rays lit up the room Draco stood up and went to the bathroom in order to get a cold shower so he could survive this day of classes. Then he brushed his teeth and made his hair before sneaking down to the common room, leaving three snoring figures behind in their respective beds. As he entered the room he saw some black hair sticking out over the back of the deep blue couch by the fireplace. Draco's heart jumped. Maybe it was Harry who came back late and immediately fell asleep on the first soft surface he saw because he was so tired. But a second glance proved him wrong. The hair was long and straight and not at all wild, curly and exciting like H-
When she looked up again, teary-eyed, Harry held up two thumbs at her and she gave him a smile in return.
Hesitantly he took it and let it fall back against the door again. It didn't even cause a sound. The door just opened a crack.
The question consumed Draco's mind and drowned out any other impressions. Usually he loved shopping but right now he couldn't focus on the robe Madam Malkin was fitting on him for even a mere second. Actually being in this dressing room just made it worse. Here was where everything started. Here was where he’d met
Then he let himself lock eyes with Draco and immediately had to take a shivering breath. This was a terrible idea. Malfoy would make him look ridiculous in front of everyone. And it would be so easy for him as well.
He nodded again. She left. Draco desperately wanted to hex someone, to blame someone for his misery other than his father. With all his anger he glared at the tag attached to the bundle of
“Oh, Percy. Stop it. You’re perfectly on time. Draco and Harry are still on their way. Come on, get in there. Don’t leave poor Oliver alone with all your siblings and your father!”
Harry as well had spotted Snape's injury. He even could have sworn to have seen a drop of blood running down the Professor's left shoe. But before he could take a second glance, Snape hid it with his robe and snarled,
In an attempt to finally discover whatever was sleeping in here, he stepped further into the room. Suddenly he stopped in his tracks.
The next weeks Harry spent a lot of time with Terry, Michael and Anthony, as well as Cho Chang. Terry continued helping him in potions which forced Snape to give him at least acceptable grades and lead to Malfoy having one reason less to insult and laugh at him. Malfoy did this a lot lately. But at the moment Harry had more important stuff on his mind. Norbert the baby dragon had grown so much, that he, Ron and Hermione had started trying to avoid visiting Hagrid's hut as often as possible because they feared to leave it with singed hair. They had come to the conclusion, that it was best to somehow get that dragon to Ron's brother Charlie in Romania. Now the only problem was to make Hagrid agree with them. While it was Harry and Ron's job to convince him on that matter, Hermione was busy with studying for the end of year exams -yeah, she had already started with that- and with doing research on the philosopher's stone.
So instead of reading, he settled for tearing into every corner of his brain in hopes of finding an answer to this impossible riddle. A basilisk seemed like the perfect answer, but how to Salazar would it be able to travel unseen? He spent hours writing down options and crossing them off again. When he was finally pulled out of his bubble by the squeaking noise their door always made, it was already past midnight and the other boys had gone to sleep long ago. Draco peeked out from behind his curtain to find Harry leaning against the wall next to the door.
The blond's head snapped towards him, sporting a surprised expression. When he opened his mouth the words escaped as a whisper.
They were running late. Of course. Getting six kids all packed up and into the car was a huge mess. They were just about to leave when Fred ran back inside again to fetch some joke articles. He came back and Mr Weasley had already started the engine when Ginny shrieked, claiming she'd left her diary – her brothers teased her about that during the whole ride. After that they were finally able to go. They took the flying car, even though they didn't fly (“Molly, we'd be so much faster!” - “I said no, Arthur!”), but Mr Weasley had enlarged it on the inside so the eight of them would all fit without a problem.
It was Cho Chang, waving him over. He gave her a wide smile. He hadn't had much of a chance to talk to her since the start of term. It was nice seeing her again.
Who did Potter think he was to eavesdrop to this conversation (If you could call a Howler a conversation...).
All this time there had been a voice nagging him in the back of his head and somehow he had managed to ignore it while reading. But having nothing to distract himself with, fatigue made his walls break down for a second and that was when the voice screamed at him:
“I mean, it is common knowledge that the seeker is the most important and therefore most popular player of the team.”
One would think having a ghost-teacher is fun. Professor Binns looked like he'd never heard of the word 'fun' at all (let alone laughed).
Life at the Wealseys' was super fun. Ron always complained about the chores they had to do but Harry found that that bit of table setting and garden degnoming with the other boys was fun, too.
He entered the hall and sat down at the Slytherin table. Maybe some food could bring him enlightenment.
Draco was just about to take it off again when Pansy barged into the room. He would definitely not wear it tonight.
Draco raised an eyebrow at him. “Being indoors all the time is bad for my flawless skin. Try not to be late, Potter.”
“I-. My classes are over for the day and I’m just waiting up for Ron and Hermione. And I put my stuff in my locker because I wanted to study with Malfoy and Blaise but they’re not in the library, so I put them back here and I’ll do the homework with Ron and Hermione over the weekend and. Yeah.”
“I generally wake up early on some days. It’s a habit from my Hogwarts years that somehow stuck with me. I always used to get up really early at least twice a week to have the quidditch pitch to myself for a few hours.”
Harry entered the great hall and took a seat next to a reading Hermione. Automatically he glanced over to the Slytherin table to find Draco's friends sitting there as usual. But a certain Ravenclaw was not amongst them. Further, Parkinson and Zabini looked rather worried.
a Ravenclaw and his father had forbidden to make friends with anyone fitting into either of these categories.
The war inside him kept Draco awake and out of habit he sat up to catch a last glimpse of a sleeping Potter- just to realise that he wasn't there.
to be a cruel joke, right? But Draco was yet to let go of his hand. Harry sat back down and was rewarded with a small, grateful smile that made his heart skip a beat.
McGonagall's voice brought him back to reality and he made his way up to the chair. With every step the whispers around him grew louder and he got more nervous.
When Harry had told his parents about the whole thing his dad had reacted pretty similarly to Ron and Hermione. His mother had been more supportive of the idea. The proud smile on her face when she had said “that’s my boy” was stuck with Harry. She would probably be disappointed as well, finding out that he wasn’t able to continue his scheme.
The rest of the ride continued rather uneventfully and in a similar manner to the past ones. After a few hours Draco was sick of Pansy's high pitched voice and Crabbe and Goyle's enthusiastic nodding to literally everything he said. Suddenly he wished for the soft, calm and intelligent voice that was
Drifting off in thought his eyes caught platinum blonde hair reflecting the sun which stood high in the enchanted ceiling. Malfoy's eyebrows were drawn together in something that looked like a mix of concern and curiosity as he was talking to his friends. They still hadn't exchanged a word since the... incident.
The troll stood in the center of the mess and its eyes were fixed on one of the porcelain sinks in the corner.
"Wanna go down to the lake with us after Astronomy? Fred and George have Quidditch practice at five so we could go to the pitch and watch them afterwards."
Finally his eyes landed upon Malfoy who was sitting alone with an empty parchment in front of him, staring right back at Harry.
Thank god. He was so relieved to see his godfather that he hugged him. He knew, Malfoy's shouldn't show their feelings like that but he couldn't help it. This time it was all just too much. The sorting, his fathers anger, Potter and on top of everything this monster or whatever this thing had been.
was the better term. Harry opened his mouth as if he wanted to reply but then he shook his head and lay down on his bed without changing or brushing his teeth. Draco didn’t get much sleep after that.
He had the strong urge to punch something and almost hit Hermione right into her face when she put her hand onto his shoulder.
Relieved, he let out a breath and complied with his father's orders. Swallowing his disappointment he straightened his back and pridefully strutted the rest of their way, showing all the
Relieved, Harry let out a breath he didn't know he'd been holding and smiled back at the guy with the thick London dialect.
"I'll join you tomorrow when you visit him again. Maybe after all Snape hasn't got anything to do with this."
After the hat's song and all Draco had bragged about, Harry had been so sure that Malfoy was the most slytherin boy in this school. What on earth would make the sorting hat put this guy into Ravenclaw?
