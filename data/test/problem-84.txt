“I’ll handle that. You think we’re ready? The spells, all the layers? D’you think I’m ready?”
“Go on lad, she’d probably appreciate a break from all the paperwork.”
Pulling off his glasses, Harry rubbed at his eyes and sighed slight disappointment. “Guess we should get to sleep.”
“Cheeky prat.” Draco nipped the pulse point on his throat. "Are you hungry?"
“Have I made up for calling you a whore yet?”
Harry nodded. He supposed she had more reason than most not to trust books from Malfoys.
“Ah yes. He might’ve mentioned something about that… but Father’s wand aim has always been awful. Do you remember the way?”
Harry liked Draco’s soup much better than he expected, and said as much, though Draco dismissed the praise.
Draco cut off mid-sentence.
Harry had hoped for an easier week, but it turned out to be exhaustingly grueling.
.” Harry hissed Parseltongue right against the sticky sensitivity of his arse.
“But...” Harry trailed off in hesitant confusion. “You did come, when I asked.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
The friction was purely overwhelming, and in time Harry lost a battle of wills with his stamina, and came very hard. He let out a soundless sort of cry, tensing through his ecstasy, as Draco kept up a rubbing pressure with his cock, unrelenting and quickening, until he spilled in the tangle of sheets between them, adding heat to Harry’s mess with a throaty moan.
“You’re really fucking sexy when you’re coming,” Harry breathed incoherently.
“We’re not doing them all in here then?”
When he returned, he held a dusty and rather ancient-looking bottle of firewhisky in one hand, and a cut-crystal tumbler in the other.
“I suppose I ought to feed you again.”
“So then…we’re bait,” he said slowly.
“It looks so much more straightforward when she does it,” Harry complained slightly.
“You could always sneak in another time,” he teased a bit, now trying to decide which door would be a better choice.
“Well anyway, I’ve given you all I have for now. I think we’re well past even for our little…tour—”
“What’s all this?”
“Yeah, until you get caught out alone in London with a death cloud of Dementors after you,” Harry pointed out. “I mean, maybe I could—”
“I assumed as much. What do you want?”
“Yes, fucking hurry,” Draco ordered, lusty and quiet.
“Hey, I—”
Harry was confused for the long stretch of uncomfortable silence it took to dawn on him—Draco had actually used the Protean Charm before, to communicate with Madam Rosmerta, when he’d had her under Imperius. Harry recalled her testimony at Draco’s trial, and while he might not’ve harmed her physically, Imperius was a violation of will on a profoundly disturbing level—there was a reason it was Unforgivable.
“What is it?” Harry sat down carefully.
“To start with… a single location—wherein we secure all the premises. Under the proper spells we could disguise it however we like—that’s not important, but this way you could control how far the magic goes, and wrap the whole lot up in wards. It will protect them from being targets for the Dementors, and it stops the Ministry detecting any of our less than legal enchantments. If our first attempt is effective, then we could probably consider expanding the idea to include more locations.”
“You sound awfully confident about that.”
there, that was hard to argue. Not that he really wanted to argue in the first place, he'd only gone out there for some fresh air, and to be alone. What was he meant to do about an irritable Draco Malfoy?
“Not as if it isn’t warranted.”
“Shut up, Malfoy, yours is before mine,” Harry complained, and started nipping steadily at his neck, until Draco was breathing a little unsteadily. “How long did you say you had?”
“I said your name.”
Malfoy huffed at him impatiently. “Don’t make me ask again. Do you want the spell to work or not?”
“You might’ve fucking said that from the start!”
He closed the small distance between them, rubbing hard at Harry’s cock through his jeans before he was pressing flush to his front, locking their lips.
When she went away for long periods of time, she would occasionally owl Harry to meet for tea or drinks, if she had the time, but she’d warned him this time their captain was expecting total focus, and no distractions. It was all something to do with team unity and shared experiences apparently—which sounded pretty legitimate to Harry.
“I'll need you to fuck me until I can’t remember my own name.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“That’s the idea, yes.” Draco extracted the blackboard’s twin from the same drawer, and tapped with his wand, charming words from its tip in neat chalky cursive.
“What if I asked you to make another exception?”
his mind suggested.
“For fuck’s sake,” he complained while Draco laughed at him.
“Why not?” Harry flashed a flirting sort of half-smile. “I’ve already had my tongue up there.”
However there was one issue that needed immediate addressing before he could go any farther with his questions.
Distracted enough to let himself be led out to the ballroom, so that they might make use of all the mirrors again. As strange as it was to have Draco Malfoy suddenly determined to dress him, he didn’t really care enough about his clothes to bother arguing over it—at least, so long as they were comfortable.
“What do you want?” Harry whispered while they caught up on breathing.
“Think I might grab something to eat at Hagrid’s then. Maybe you’ll go get the latest on what everyone’s been up to for me?”
Malfoy’s laugh was lower and throatier than Harry rightly remembered. He couldn’t tell if the potion was playing with his perception, or if Malfoy’s voice had always sounded so much like sex to him.
“I also have a lot of work to do if we’re going to be ready for this week. But for now, I’ll let you wash off the honey you’ve insisted on smearing all over me, and if you change the sheets after I might consider getting back into bed with you.”
“It would,” Ginny agreed a bit gravely.
A part of him registered the potion had started to fade—though it might have been an hour ago or five minutes for all Harry knew—another part registered that his cock was throbbing sorely in his trousers, pain and a precarious sort of need.
Draco scoffed at him. “You don’t really believe that.”
Harry has a long week before his meeting with Draco on Saturday
When he did open his eyes they locked cautiously with Harry’s, who was quite close.
She could also be seen on a number of occasions laughing in entertained exasperation as Harry went off for another round of drinks.
“Malfoy.”
“I’m sorry about this, but first I’ll need to ask you not to say anything to anyone about my being here. Not even your sister.”
“You fuck all your pets then?”
I’m afraid I’ve heard quite a lot about you over the years. Erm, I’m not a witch myself, but—well you know.”
Harry wondered if Lawrence minded terribly that his new wife had Gryffindor friends, but not sensing any hostility, he allowed his guard to relax a bit more.
Harry’s Transfiguration skills were far from perfect, but weaving so much into the Extension Charms had sharpened them in the last several months. The effort of turning sheets to curtains was not as taxing as he might’ve once found it—though his first attempt had come out a bit wonky-looking for some reason.
Harry let up on the hair-stroking with an awkward smirk. “On the table behind you.”
It was a relief to see him out and about again, even if it had to be at a formal event like this one.
He could hardly sleep at all, and when he did it was almost always the nightmares. A few times he thought he’d dreamed of Draco, but it was so shadowy in his memory it was impossible to tell if he wasn’t only remembering a different dream. Lately he was grateful for the dreams about Draco he did remember, for the break of them, even if it never lasted and the nightmares always came back.
“Both if you like,” Draco countered, smirking. “But only one at a time.”
always?”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“And you’ve called
Harry caught grey eyes watching him then, and drew in a tight breath when Draco leant in to brush his lips just at his jawline. Then he very carefully, somehow still gracefully climbed to his feet, gathered up his robes and began heading back the way they had come all those many hours ago.
“Bag’s empty. Should we get started?”
He hadn’t been lying there very long—his eyes drifting closed in the bright afternoon sun—when it began to feel as if the ground under them were waving gently, as though an ocean rippled just beneath the surface.
“It’s risky, isn’t it? Without knowing if the Muggles will ever want it back.”
“Er. We also have a few more questions about the situation on the ground—so to speak. If you don’t mind.”
Harry wanted him to stop talking, before he mentioned anything else about that night.
“Whatever would your freckled fiancé say?”
She fixed him with a searching gaze regardless, seeming to make her own assessment on whether or not he was really okay to be drinking with Draco Malfoy. Harry tried to offer a reassuring smile, but Ginny seemed to remain mostly trepidatious.
“No?” he prodded, hushed and taunting.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Nevermind the fact he had absolutely just called Draco a whore, or the part where Draco had no idea what he'd said last Saturday, because he'd said it all in Parseltongue—he was not prepared to examine his extraordinary levels of hypocrisy at the moment. All he could think of was Zabini in Draco’s bed, hearing him moan the way Harry always did.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry shuddered and Draco murmured a spell, undoing every button on them all at once. He worked Harry’s trousers down a bit, but only just enough for his fingertips to trace the line of Harry’s hips.
He must’ve been getting closer, but when Draco curved one knee up over the high arm of the chair, Harry got a bit sidetracked.
When Draco moaned around him it took a lot of Harry’s willpower not to simply thrust into Draco’s mouth until he came—however—
Seated at the worn wooden bar of The Hog's Head, Harry opened his mouth to object, but someone beat him to it.
“There isn’t time.”
“The scandal. Not Perfect Potter breaking rules his own department is meant to enforce."
“…I believe we might’ve broken your bedroom door.”
It took them nearly twenty minutes to get from Harry’s house to the paddock, which was hidden enough from town that they could fly unnoticed. Ron spent most of that time catching him up on the latest high jinks at the shop.
Through the mirror, striking silver narrowed under the wispy cover of pale lashes, locking with the hungry spark of Harry’s green before drifting downward. They both watched Harry’s hand slipping into the open front of Draco’s trousers, exposing a shock of light curls as he rubbed over Draco’s cock through his pants, pushing down at the front of them to expose more of him to the mirror.
“Potter?” Malfoy finally sat up, snapping long fingers in front of Harry’s face. “Have you been Stunned?”
“I’ve had some thoughts, I’m not so sure you’ll like them.”
“You were speaking Parseltongue,” Draco cut to the chase dryly. “You mean to tell me that wasn’t on purpose?”
, Harry I’m about to come."
Harry went a bit flushed as he hurried to try doing up his trousers by hand and simultaneously scramble to his feet. It wasn’t going well. He tried to ignore the way Malfoy was watching him—only for him to offer Harry a hand.
“Careful, Malfoy. Don’t get distracted, you might get a bottle to the head.”
They had no sooner got out the doors than Draco was quirking an eyebrow at Harry.
Harry didn’t quite manage to get all the mess, but he spent a few seconds curiously licking his fingers clean. When he glanced up again, Draco was staring in slight astonishment.
“I should probably sort it myself.”
Muttering a fairly unintelligible 'evening' Harry was momentarily very absorbed in not thinking about any of the words Malfoy just said. Somewhat desperately, he reached for the books instead, pulling one down from the top of the pile to examine the cover and the binding until whatever uncomfortableness he was experiencing had passed. He absorbed absolutely none of what he was looking at.
Harry coughed entirely false innocence. “Honestly I was thinking about your mirrors.”
After checking it over thoroughly, Malfoy decided to try a second time. The results, if there were any, were quite negligible.
His cock throbbed in Harry’s grip, shooting several slow splashes up his own front, and Draco choked off a cry when Harry’s thrusts sped up, drawing out a maddening high of ecstasy—until Harry finally joined him, tensing as he painted Draco inside with a few more hot spurts of come.
“I thought we were trying to accomplish something here—now you want to talk about
Draco’s quiet cough sounded suspiciously like a laugh to Harry’s ears.
“Your decorating skills need work,” he drawled, eyeing up the abundance of tartan and paisley patterns, and the mix of them together, that Harry had created. “Otherwise…I suppose it’s quite cosy.”
Harry nodded, writing down everything he could. His hand was cramping, not used to ballpoint pens after so many years of quills. Hopefully he would be able to read the scribbled mess later.
“Honestly I could use it,” Harry admitted. “Hermione sent me some reading, but it’s pretty advanced and I’ve never done it before.”
Draco smirked, seeming to enjoy watching him try, and not bothering to fasten his own just yet. “I’m not complaining. Did you still want to go up there?”
He felt a flutter of panic even thinking about telling anyone all that had occurred between them that evening. He made an attempt to keep his anxiety internal, but he wasn’t doing a very good job of it.
He tried to keep steady until Draco found his feet again.
“This is where you’ve been working then?”
“What?” Harry muttered fuzzily into his neck. “What’d I do?”
Fumbling with his fly one-handed, Harry pushed him brusquely forward against the mirror, until his cock pressed tight to the glass.
He also thought of the last and only time he had set foot in Malfoy Manor. Did he really want to go back there?
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Well you’ll never get rid of all the Dementors in London, you know—misery, part of the human condition I think.”
Thinking back on it, Harry found himself frequently irked at Malfoy’s behaviour that solstice night—with all his smooth talk of deals and satisfaction—despite knowing he was ultimately just as responsible himself. He’d had a choice, and he’d made that choice.
It was hot enough that Harry was struggling not to come every time—which appeared to be the point. Almost painful, perfectly pleasurable.
“I can assure you they are, but whatever. Only remind me to change them in the morning.”
“Potter?”
Not that he planned on wandering off into the depths of the manor, but he could check the potions lab for a start. He better remembered the way now, and it took him far less time to find the reverberant glass atrium.
Harry had to stretch to reach for the tea tray and carefully pull out the spoon he’d left sitting in the honey jar, hurrying to hover it over Draco’s stomach, up his chest and back down, swirling about his navel, and lower yet.
“That all makes sense, if you think it’s possible.”
“We’ve forgotten the windows.”
“Careful getting home, Potter,” he warned, already fading into the darkness. “It’s dangerous out here at night.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry gave up and apologised to Cassie for him. “He’s—”
Harry’s shirt was left on the floor of one of the narrow curvy corridors when Draco pinned him there to remove it, biting forcefully along the top of his chest.
Harry probably should’ve been in a hurry. He shouldn’t’ve been doing this during work hours at all—but the way Draco’s low moan filled the tiny room when Harry guided the tip of his cock past the tight ring of Draco’s arse... it was very hard to care about anything else.
He didn’t expect an answer right away, and after several seconds of watching just in case, went out to the kitchen to find something worth eating in the cupboards. He came back a few minutes later with a bit of magically reheated chicken and dropped down on the settee to check the board.
When they finally forced themselves to separate, as the potion’s effects began to abate to nearly-normal, Harry nevertheless immediately felt a void of something fundamentally missing—an ache that grew and was only really satisfied when he gave up trying to do up his trousers and dragged Draco back down on top of him.
’d at it softly.
Harry pulled the sheets back to take Draco in hand, whispered a quiet lubrication charm—then switched to hissing again, quickly realising he could get away with saying all sorts of things this way.
Draco nipped at his cheek, where the faint line of a still-healing curse cut across Harry’s cheekbone.
“Harry! Are you home?”
Harry made it through another busy week, but when the first Saturday of August arrived, his concern over whether or not he’d been a bit of a prick to Draco got the better of him before he had even finished his morning tea.
“Not fair?” Harry laughed, while Malfoy scowled at him. “Fine, whatever. I’ll try the paper bag then.”
“Just a small matter regarding the lighting. I wanted to get your input on possible solutions.”
Before he stood however, he gave the soft rise of Draco’s arse a strong smack, and his subsequent moan echoed resonantly through the library.
Adjusting the chair, Harry gave it a wandless shove and sent it sliding to a stop in front of one mirrored wall. He raised his eyebrows questioningly, waiting for a connection, or an approval.
“Both,” Harry muttered obstinately. “Ready now?”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“You want to maybe…come back to my place?” Harry queried casually instead.
“Potter…you’re not listening, are you?”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Have a pleasant evening, then,” Draco drawled.
Draco’s response was a very deep moan that Harry felt all through him.
“It’s a matter of time, Potter. As in, the time it would take for me to create an altered jinx that functions properly. It appears possible on parchment, and I have nothing but time. It’s an intriguing challenge.”
Harry swatted away the tip of his wand when Draco started pointing it at his head.
Harry sighed. It was a lot to ask, for a goal that might ultimately be total folly, or even outright harmful. The work Draco had already done was a lot to ask, and apparently all in exchange for a half-arsed drunk Ministry tour and a clumsy hand job.
He snorted a laugh. “Honestly, if you’re going to insist—”
Harry blinked blank surprise. “You’re serious?”
“Malfoy.”
“Not yet,” he teased sardonically, rolling over to start nipping small marks along Harry’s collarbone. “I’ll be certain to let you know when you have.”
Draco followed him out the kitchen’s back door.
“Alright, Harry…tell him we all say hello.” Ginny smiled a bit sadly and hugged him tightly before she pulled away. “Just don’t accept any rock cakes.”
That he cared enough to want to hide it was more interesting.
“Evening,” he muttered roughly, rubbing the jean-clad stiffness of his cock on Draco’s very naked arse.
There was a note of strong protectiveness in Cassie’s voice then that Harry completely understood. “Many of our regulars have taken up on a small bit of cover near the edge of the riverbank, but we value the privacy of our people here. I’m not sure I’m comfortable telling you where exactly—What are you planning to do about them? They’ve been through a lot, and many of them don’t have terribly good experiences with authority.”
When a searching hand slipped back to swat insistently at his hip, Harry quickly interpreted it as a request to fit warmly to Draco’s back, hooking an arm around his middle to pull him just a touch closer.
With a desperate noise, Harry pushed up and gave him the space to roll over, and Draco was already whispering spells as he pressed his perfectly pale, undeniably flawless arse up, and back against the length of Harry’s cock.
“We don’t—have a potion this time,” he pointed out behind a badly stifled groan.
Once they looked like normal non-magical lamps, it became a matter of finding a good method of enchanting them all to light as if they were real Muggle lamps. This turned out to be not so easy a task as they might’ve hoped.
Harry sighed quietly as he reached the end of it. “I’m sorry. For this.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“At least one, possibly even two of which we’ll need for setting up in London.”
“Are you watching, Malfoy?”
“Malfoy, if—when we get in there, don’t touch anything. If we touch—”
“I guess I should’ve known you were a whore, all that practice you’ve had.”
If it seems like I've dropped some plotlines I promise it should all come back around further in. There is a vague plan. In the meantime, enjoy!
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Thanks for the vote of confidence,” Harry said wryly.
“Keep practising the Extension revisions, look over the books I set aside for you. I’ll be in touch when I’m ready to walk you through the warding enchantments.”
Harry could not quite meet their worried gazes, and hoped they would assume he meant the less than legal aspects of the project.
Draco smirked, catching at Harry’s cock to tug him toward his last tent, past the kitchen table with their abandoned firewhisky, through the sitting room, and straight to bed.
He'd caught a curse to the face during one investigation gone awry, and spent more than half a day being Healed for a nasty cut beneath his left eye. Harry didn’t think it would scar but it would probably take a while to heal properly.
A week or so later he took the time to scrawl out a proper owl to Malfoy.
“Must be, for you to care that much about the cost of it,” Harry considered aloud.
His eyes narrowed immediately on Harry, sulking in his armchair.
He knew, somewhere in the mist of rage covering his thoughts, that Draco wasn’t about to abandon all their work now, and that he probably shouldn’t have called him a whore.
“Sorry for being a massive prick.”
The smoke didn’t appear to concern Draco at all, he didn’t even glance at the tables either, and stopped instead at a fancy looking wood cabinet with coloured glass panes in its doors.
Harry didn’t know for sure what this was about but—
Harry took in as much as he comfortably could—given Draco’s cock was actually quite long.
“Do you still want me to fuck you, Draco?”
Harry was a bit frustrated. “I don’t understand, why hasn't anything broken for you?”
He never got around to talking with her about Draco either. When he’d come down for tea, they’d chatted for an hour about the new Weird Sisters album.
“…cast a Patronus, is the end of the sentence.”
Watching the other man writhing and coming beneath him, Harry decided then he would need to invest in a Pensieve, soon.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“It is
“Alright. I think so? Sounds as convoluted and mismanaged as our Ministry, actually.”
“And what’s happened to ‘One night only, Potter’?”
It was at once heart-breaking and infuriating, and Harry found himself asking so many questions that he even managed to wear on Savage's normally good mood, more than once. He supposed he would have to do his best to be less overbearing—only without Hermione around to speak up, he felt somewhat obligated to do it himself.
“Honestly, how do you not strangle him every time he opens his smug prat mouth?” Ron queried conversationally.
“Not nearly, no,” Draco admitted immediately. “There’s lots to do, but it will have to wait until I’ve had a chance to look over some things back at the Manor and—I think I might need to meet this Cassie woman. I have some questions, and I’d like to make my own assessment whether we can trust her not to go spouting off things that might get us both arrested for breaking International Wizarding Law. If we’re
“That is good news,” Harry agreed, sucking lightly at the spot he’d just been biting, feeling the quiet moan Draco tried to stifle.
Fighting off a smile, Harry swallowed. “Sorry. What’ve you been thinking then?”
“Would tell the whole of everyone we know before morning tea. I think not. The very last thing I need is my father hearing about any of—whatever it was. More to the point, it’s obviously over now.”
In a creaky little house on the edge of Ottery St. Catchpole, Harry tossed restlessly beneath the heavy quilt which blanketed him and the bed he shared with Ginny.
As Malfoy pointed his wand, Harry spent a moment appreciating it for what it was. It had served him quite well in the final battle, its unicorn core un-corrupted, even despite Malfoy's somewhat forced turn to darkness those last few years.
It came to him in a flash of inspiration, reading through one of the books Draco had left him on passive magic. He’d come across a few sections regarding the Protean Charm—what Hermione had used on the D.A.’s coins—and it occurred to him then that something similar would work perfectly as a way to keep in touch with her magically, without her needing to be able to use the magic herself.
“This was for many years my father’s desk.” Draco smirked insolently. “But it’s mine now.”
A quiet silence stretched on between them, until Harry finally broke it.
“Potter. Fucking go, you prick.”
He moved as quietly as he could down his creaky staircase to make a pot of tea, and in the kitchen he rediscovered the door to the back garden hanging open.
“You’re really not fucking her?” Draco inquired doubtfully, just brushing the fabric with his words.
“What about Muggles, Harry?”
He was sort of looking forward to going home though.
Ron had also clearly had a few drinks.
Draco considered him even more closely, the narrow of grey very nearly predatory.
“Honestly, I’m excited to see what you’ve been working on. You always seem so enthusiastic about it.”
“It does make me nervous her sister’s with the papers, but Cassie seems trustworthy enough.”
“If we’re going to do it any time soon, then we ought to before Ginny gets home, this is the longest stretch of time I’ll have to myself for at least a month…we’d have to start this week. I’d need a few days off work—”
Harry shrugged. “It’s just a cubicle, really. I’m still in training.”
“I’m fine,” he verified somewhat unconvincingly. “Let’s get the fuck out of here.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry only found less and less reason to complain as the night wore on.
Despite his wry tone, Harry glanced up to consider him earnestly. Draco only arched an expectant eyebrow, so he got on with skimming the letter. In no time at all he was smiling a little soppily at the parchment.
“It’s near enough.”
“Don’t be ridiculous. My parents shared; I was allowed my own...for privacy reasons.”
“We should start quite early, an hour before dawn at least, two if possible.”
The stony stairs spiralled up, opening to a larger arched corridor, lined with wooden beams and a number of remarkably violent magical tapestries.
It took him longer than he would later admit to find the library, but he did.
“Alright, I have been tolerating quite a lot from you, but
The rest of his day was somehow a lot less torturous than it had been at the start.
“Harry you really need new shirts—you keep losing your buttons somewhere, and I can’t mend them all if I don’t have the buttons.”
When the last of their energy was spent, Harry was probably the second-stickiest he had ever been, and so exhausted he was completely fine with it. His limbs tangled with Draco’s, who was sprawling out on top of him to pass out, his face pushed close to Harry’s throat—and Harry was completely fine with that too.
? Now?”
Instead, he reached for the front of Draco’s shirt and pulled him up and closer—which was all the prompting Draco apparently needed to walk right into him and crush their lips together. They slid their tongues together too, and Harry hummed a low sort of satisfied noise as Draco broke the kiss only to bite tauntingly at Harry’s lower lip then, trying to pull him into another—
“It was guilt, really,” Draco said bluntly, frowning. “I quite liked Dobby, and she—well. It’s over now.”
Malfoy took out his wand then, casting a privacy ward around the clearing. Likely a good idea—as Harry couldn’t think of a single person he would have wanted finding him tripping on potions with Draco Malfoy at such a somber event.
Curiously, Harry pulled off Draco’s cock long enough to whisper a wandless lubrication spell, and press his fingers into Draco with slow exploration.
Draco immediately rocked down harder, and Harry’s rough groan was much louder.
Now Harry laughed outright. “Don’t take it so personally, Malfoy. I hadn’t meant you specifically."
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Malfoy appeared rather pressed at the notion of eight people in one tent.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“I’ve worked in a Tongue-Tying curse, that’s the whole
"But I’m talking about practical solutions, it’s not as if their problems aren’t affecting us too. There’s Dementors all over London now, how long until they’re on the Ministry’s doorstep?"
“Oh, I see…” Cassie didn’t sound as if she did see.
Harry—”
Draco.”
“This place is disgraceful, Potter.”
Harry was about to set off up the hill when something glinted bright and blond under the sun across the narrow end of the lake, catching his eye.
Malfoy moved around the table far too gracefully for as many drinks as they had already consumed. Harry tensed a bit when he leaned in to speak more quietly. He was quite close.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
There was a pause wherein Harry let out all the air he had been holding in, and promptly felt his heart stop when Ginny spoke again.
,” Draco gasped, arching back lithely when Harry finally found what he was looking for.
Hello! Thank you for continuing to read if you are, I appreciate you! The feedback is awesome and its nice to know I'm entertaining someone besides me. I've been taking longer between chapters but I've also been trying to go through and fix some errors I missed the first time round. If you've been saving it off as an entire work definitely give your file an update.
“And while you’re at it, heal your neck. You’re looking a bit defiled.”
Harry mounted and kicked off from the ground hard. The rush of air and the joyous swoop in his stomach was as exhilarating as it ever was.
I was going to wait and save this chapter to release with the next one but I'm happy with how it came out so I'm just going for it. Enjoy!
The note of panic in her voice was familiar, as there appeared to be a new Harpies crisis every week or two.
Ron and Hermione had taken he and Ginny out to celebrate, and just happened to have told most of their family and friends where they would be going. It had been loud and chaotic, but Harry hadn’t minded it too much—though he never really enjoyed being the center of attention.
“Shit, I hadn’t even thought about the lights.”
“So you say, but I’ve seen the dashing robes and the fancy holsters you lot get. All a bit over the top, if you ask me.”
But Harry didn’t think Ron would ever agree to be involved in a talk about how Harry wasn’t marrying his sister fast enough. It had taken him long enough to get used to them living together in the first place.
Thank you all so much for reading, and for the kudos and commenting! I'm excited for where things are going. I've got a good 40k more written and I'm almost certain it'll go even longer than that, so there is more to come!
, enough Harry felt emboldened to rock himself right in between Malfoy’s spreading legs. Now when he spoke, his lips left a damp impression against the base of Malfoy’s throat, tugging his shirt open just a little—
He started off thinking it over in his head, but ended up voicing his thought process aloud.
They caught each other up on work. Ron shared some great shop stories, Hermione did her best to summarise her progress on the new legislation she was so engrossed with, and they discussed the Aurors’ latest raids—a rounding up of the few Death Eaters with any traces left to find after two years, and anyone implicated in some of the more recent trials. Trainees weren’t allowed on raids, but Harry still had some interesting bits of inside information to share with them.
It was Harry’s turn to moan loudly, his cock twitching dangerously close—but he didn’t stop. Panting with effort, he bumped his lips into the soft edge of Draco’s ear, speeding up as much as he could without losing the hard hit of his cock.
“Passable.”
Harry watched him work curiously. He rarely bothered cooking with magic. Having learnt to do it the Muggle way at Privet Drive, it was the only way he knew. There were times he had seen Ginny use her mother’s recipe spells, but she had only ever cast the steps one at a time—never all at once like this, with ingredients mixing themselves all along the table.
The boys discuss some important things, avoid a few others, and spend most of the day disinclined to get out of bed.
“You asked me to come, Potter.”
It was an elaborate affair most years, though this year far surpassed the last.
“Punish me, Harry.”
He sucked at Draco’s tip for a long time, tonguing at it too, and only let up when Draco started trying to push deeper.
What they found instead was a queue. Stretching up the narrow alley and onto the main road, it was impossible to see where it began, but Harry estimated there must’ve been nearly fifty Muggles just from the end of the line to the corner they disappeared around. And it seemed he had been very wrong about the sort of people he expected to find drawing so many Dementors to London.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
It was loud and echoey, what with all the moaning and the wet impact of heated skin in the few inches of water still left in the bottom of the bath.
Harry didn’t think he was really looking for an answer—since the answer was clearly
“Hard.”
“The atrium?” Harry checked.
“Now you mention it, I could’ve sworn I felt their awful bloody cold the other night outside the flat.”
. Harry couldn’t shake the fear he might lose most of the people he cared about if they discovered the full extent of his involvement with Draco—and the thought of losing any of them was absolutely terrifying, more even than his Gryffindor bravery could entirely overcome.
“Fine, be a mess.”
Harry watched Draco wrapping up the last few syllables and wand-waves, and as he lowered his wand the blond swayed precariously on his feet.
Malfoy had quickly taken a step back, and seemed to be very absorbed in staring at the bubbling liquid in his glass, and anywhere else that wasn’t at the two of them. Harry felt a pang of sympathy he didn’t fully understand.
“He was taking advantage of my wardrobe, and my shower, for a date that was not with me. I haven’t fucked Blaise for over a year, you
And with that matter sorted, they were finally as prepared as they thought they could be for the next morning.
But then he was gone.
to you?”
He swallowed down a nervous flutter when Draco made immediately for Harry’s cubicle.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
He was definitely flustered. Which Malfoy appeared to find very amusing.
“Any children are too many children, but there’s a much larger number of elderly people as well. Then of course there’s people with substance abuse problems, people in need of mental health services, people in need of legal help—”
“I’ll make every effort to avoid murdering him,” he drawled after her.
Catching the annoyed narrow of grey eyes in the mirror, Harry smiled a bit cheekily, but then Draco smirked back at him—and deliberately took even longer shifting about delicate platinum strands.
He was curling them to rub at the right spot when the stiff twitch of a long cock pressed to his arm and Draco lifted off. He didn’t need to ask if he was ready, not the way Draco’s arse started chasing the tip of his cock.
“You’re still staring, I see. You never learn, do you?”
Ginny would stay in touch with him of course, but wasn’t expecting to be home until the 4
“Draco, that’s great.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry busied himself pulling one of several sleek black dining chairs out from the table, and slouching into it with a quiet groan. He stretched a bit as well, and only just happened to catch Draco watching him go about it.
Harry shook off his thoughts and took back the tumbler Draco was trying to pass him.
He only seemed to realise several beats later who it was that had just questioned him when Harry snickered.
“Er, not exactly,” Harry hesitated. “He’s come to London a couple times.”
He was too busy shielding his eyes from a particularly bright pendulum, hyper-reflecting the bell jar’s light directly into his eyes, to notice that Malfoy had stopped—until he walked right into him, and immediately received a sharp elbow to the stomach.
“Then it was nothing urgent after all,” he drawled, turning a look of faint annoyance on the owl.
Draco made an attempt to redirect him. “What do you think of this one then? It’s…well it’s not dry now obviously, but it’s not completely flooded either. It looks flat enough. What does your little paper have to say about it?”
An idea was tumbling about somewhere inside his barely-sober brain that Harry was trying to catch hold of, something of his dreams, just out of reach. He wouldn’t manage to catch it that night but it would come in time, and with it bring a sea of change crashing right to Harry’s doorstep.
Draco smirked. “Well done. That’s the correct answer.”
“Harry, we’re concerned.” Hermione blinked at him earnestly.
Changing the subject, Harry nodded at the long scrolls of parchment scattered across their table.
“Eyes open, Potter.” His words ghosted over ever more sensitive skin, so close and not close enough. “I know you like to watch.”
“How was shopping?”
be certain of.
Harry couldn’t help thinking they never would have worked so well together in school, but the more he thought it over, the more he had to acknowledge they were never really given the chance to try. They might’ve worked well together. Perhaps they could’ve even discovered how bloody fucking attractive they found each other sooner.
“Erm,” said Harry. “Things’ve…changed, a bit. Since the war and all. You know. He’s helping me with the case.”
“Doing the books at the Solstice Ball?”
Draco moaned lower, and again even more frustratedly when Harry switched back to Parseltongue.
Harry snorted and tossed a throw pillow at him. Draco redirected it with a wandless shove, and it landed on the floor instead.
Harry goes in search of some answers, and finds a few.
Then, given Harry was presently taking up the majority of the bed-space, Draco collapsed half-atop him with a low groan.
It was likely a good thing he was going to see Ron and Hermione tonight, for a proper chat. Even if Harry was slightly dreading it, it was a reason to get out of the house, and stop replaying Draco’s every touch in his head.
.” Draco’s moan rose to a higher volume. “Do it, Harry. Make me come—”
A brownish vine of thorny white roses climbed a lot of the walls, though they didn’t go all the way up. Toward the back center of the atrium was a great stone fountain, perhaps a meter in depth from the looks of it, with a spiralling serpent statue that rose several stories to spurt a continuous fountain of water from its mouth.
He’d obviously known exactly when Harry meant to arrive, and was surely nearby for a reason.
“Home,” Ron grunted.
But perhaps Draco was just tired. Harry certainly was, the exhaustion only weighing on him more as the day wore on.
“…so, this was your father’s desk?”
Pale strands of blond hair brushed the pages of his book when Draco’s head tipped forward
Harry panted through the speeding slam of their hips, and Draco went on moaning hoarsely, arching under Harry’s rougher touch down his back. In the undertow of heat between them, Harry was well beneath the surface, too deep to hold anything back.
Knelt at his feet, Draco started tracing the tip of his wand very lightly along the inside-leg seam of the too-tight trousers he was wearing. Harry cleared his throat a little restlessly.
When he wandered out of Draco’s bathroom to find his clothes, Draco was sitting in one of the dark chairs by his fireplace with a mug of something that smelled of chocolate and cinnamon.
“Good?” Draco drawled, throaty and knowingly smug.
“I’m not sure I understand, you’re helping Muggles in London with Malfoy? What help could he possibly be with anything non-magic? And you
“Are you planning to tell him we’re not actually fucking anymore?”
Nodding to the paper, Harry quirked a small smile. “Nice front page.”
“Ah. Well, about that,” Harry hedged.
“Have you actually tried?”
It was stilted, but Harry could tell he was trying to be polite, a rather unprecedented occurrence in itself.
It was a mad push of magic and inspecting as the evening wore on, but they did finally come to the end of the spiral, and even before midnight—though only just.
“Right then. Let’s see what he has to say for himself.”
Harry was trying not to gag or choke, but interested to see how far he could push it, if he could make Draco feel as good with his mouth as Draco’s mouth felt on him. But Harry also really wanted to fuck him, and his fingers traced up between Draco’s thighs to slide between his arsecheeks and rub at the soft pucker of his entrance.
Harry chewed his lip a moment, as Draco went on unbothered, and preoccupied considering the length of his arm.
Draco went on smoothly sucking through the aftershocks, until Harry shook a little under the overstimulating caress of his tongue and he finally pulled off with a rather wet pop.
Harry flushed, and Draco laughed quietly, propping himself up a bit.
Harry plopped down, but rather than read the cover, he looked up at Draco with questioning green eyes.  “Any thoughts on Cassie?”
“Harry?” drifted echoey and concerned from the floor below, barely audible over the sound of running taps.
“How am I meant to fit into your clothes? You’re all—” Lost for words, he gestured at him instead “—you.”
“Of course. You wouldn’t want any Weasleys hearing what all you’ve been up to.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
When Harry went in to brush his teeth, he watched his cheeks tinting with warmth in the mirror, as Draco appeared to have no compunctions about nudging up beside him to share the bathroom sink.
Harry's week is productive, but his weekend takes a rocky turn, and Draco challenges him in more ways than one.
“Or, we could not talk at all.”
He was genuinely hurt at the rejection, but there was a lot of residual anger thrumming through him. He shoved back, harder than necessary—and Draco furiously closed the distance between them anyway, gripped into Harry’s hair, and pulled until he was hissing pain.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Draco sat up then, shifting closer to nip sharply at the ball of Harry’s shoulder. “Don’t be a prick, Potter.”
“Oh, shut up,” Harry complained weakly.
Forty-five or so minutes later he was still brooding when the fire in his hearth flickered and sputtered, and Draco Malfoy dropped out into his sitting room in a swirl of grey soot. He’d changed out of his pyjamas.
“If she gets any smarter, the Unspeakables are going to haul her off to study her brain,” Ron bemoaned.
“Well don’t use this one—I’ve already stretched it a bit, it’s not fair.”
Draco kept biting, steadily harder, until Harry broke into a gasping moan.
“Have you spoken with Cassie about possible locations?” Draco queried, breaking Harry out of his reflection.
Draco chuckled, shifting to let Harry's cock slide out before he was stretching onto his front the wrong way across the bed. Harry immediately climbed up to lie atop him. He nestled his spent cock in the crack of Draco’s arse, kissing at the curve of his neck.
Cassie was surprised to see him when Harry popped his head through her office doorway, but as usual, she seemed grateful for the interruption.
“Nevermind that. Watch me, I know you know how to do that, and pay attention. I’ll be certain to let you know when you’ve done something wrong. For instance, stop fondling the forks, you’re smearing the silver.”
“A few times.”
Draco’s huff cast a fog over the glass. “Fucking hurry.”
Then Harry had plopped himself down on the sitting room settee, and closed his eyes, going over again in his head the complex pattern of wand movements he would need to commit to memory if he was going to understand Draco’s spell well enough to cast it properly. It would not be an easy task, but Harry thought he might be up to the challenge.
“No matter,” he sighed. “At least the absinthe is tolerable.”
“Well you can’t touch them. We’ve basically come all the way in here so you could ogle the pretty lights.”
“Careful,” he drawled low, fucking slowly over Harry’s tongue for a few thrusts. “More.”
When Harry turned to head back to the tent, he discovered Draco was standing just behind him. He nearly ran him over, although he wasn’t exactly complaining to find him so close. Unfortunately, Draco had other reasons for hovering.
If either of them were any closer he might’ve started throwing punches. He could’ve had his hand on his wand in seconds, but he restrained himself. Mostly.
Malfoy seemed to take the question as some sort of challenge, throwing his weight into rolling them, straddling Harry’s hips and aligning their cocks in one smooth rock of them. Then he thrust forward, and Harry saw stars, an aching hardness trapped in his trousers, caught under a demanding friction when Malfoy began rubbing down on him in slow, steady thrusts.
“Isn’t it?” Draco concurred, crawling up to straddle his thighs.
“No, I’ve brought it up because it’s completely unrelated,” Draco drawled sardonically, rather lazily unbuckling his belt, until Harry stopped him.
When he’d finished stretching and yawning, Harry stumbled out of bed—which Draco immediately went about charming to make itself, effectively ensuring they would not be crawling back under the covers any time soon.
Everything Draco said sounded perfectly practical, and Harry couldn’t think of a reason why this wasn’t as good a first step as anything he’d considered. Although—
“Sorry,” he apologised. “Busy day, busy week. I ought to be heading back now, I’m just on my break—but I’ll talk to you soon.”
“As luck would have it,” Draco drawled slowly. “You might’ve just uncovered my greatest weakness.”
“Good work.”
“Fuck’s sake, Potter. Stop talking.”
Harry kissed him quite hard as he pulled out, and was surprised at how much Draco’s moan then turned him on, despite what they had just finished doing. But Harry somehow found the self-control to do what any reasonable person should, and started looking about for his pants.
Harry was only a series of quick faltering thrusts behind him, grinding down flush on his arse as he came, too hard.
Curling in away from the night air, his mind began to wander off in whatever direction it wanted to go, and inevitably the direction it headed was sleep.
“You’re joking.”
It was also becoming apparent to him that, for whatever reason, time spent with Draco held the worst of the dreams at bay, for a little while. Harry didn’t know what to do with this new information—it wasn’t as though he could ask him to stay over every time he had a bad dream, that would be ridiculous, not to mention impractical when his fiancé inevitably came home.
He’d taken to stashing Malfoy’s letters in the attic, locked securely in the hidden pocket of his old school trunk, and for now it was where he kept the key as well.
“I might’ve been in Slytherin.”
He was certainly
Malfoy gave a muffled groan that sent him off rhythm all over again.
“What on Earth are you doing here?” she prompted immediately. “Aren’t you an Auror now?”
“No patterns or special fabrics on the curtains then?” Harry enquired in an attempt to keep up.
“We can’t risk Apparating any closer. We’ll have to run for it.”
Anyway, Malfoy had said it himself.
“In the kitchen!”
“If I
“Spit it out. I’d rather not spend the rest of my evening sat here listening to you stutter at me.”
“Yours is pretty good too.”
Malfoy looked at him as if he had three heads.
A blue shimmer took hold around the area he’d mapped out in the meadow.
“That was the idea.” Draco leveled him with a rather piercing look, and a knowing smirk. “What are you proposing as an alternative?”
Harry’s first thought was that Draco wore the Muggle look quite well—for someone who spent so much of his life hating them.
“Fuck,” Harry groaned, near simultaneously with Draco’s matching sighed curse.
He hadn’t cast it all together yet, and Draco was working diligently to add on even more, but Harry kept going over what he did know of the spell’s casting complexity, drilling it into his head so many times he didn’t think he could possibly forget any of it now. He hoped not, in any case.
“I won’t wear a tie,” Harry insisted immediately. “I haven’t since school, I’m not starting again now.”
Harry found himself smirking, until Malfoy caught at his hand again, forcing it beneath troublesome layers of fabric to wrap around his cock. He gripped tentatively—having never tried this for anyone but himself before he was in decidedly unfamiliar territory, but he was pretty sure it all worked the same way.
“Must be the wine,” he excused, taking another slow sip.
“It’s fun-potion, Potter.”
“Like a—like a one-time thing?” he found himself asking.
“You haven’t got all the spells ready yet, have you?”
“If I fuck it up, I can always try it again.”
He did eventually find the atrium.
“You might have a bit of trouble finding us at first, but theoretically so long as you know what you’re looking for the enchantments should allow you to see through the illusions. This will be a bit of a test actually, if it all works as intended even for…non-magical people, then I’ll have done my job properly.”
Nearly two hours later found them both in Harry’s attic, though the evening was not going as he had originally planned.
That was a horrifying thought. Harry imagined his humiliation might reach fatal levels.
Harry thought she must’ve seen the slightly trapped look in his eye and he tried to straighten up a bit. “I’ll be down if I can—I need to make the rounds, and I want to check in on Hagrid.”
On Wednesday afternoon Harry was working through an essay for his Poisons and Antidotes class at his cubicle, when he felt a little delirious, and had to stop for a nap in one of the interview rooms—but even there he dreamed of dark things and dead faces and too much pain.
As they joined the end of the queue, he shoved lightly at Draco’s shoulder, muttering a quiet ‘wanker’ when Draco only snickered at him. Then Harry was snorting a laugh as well, watching him surreptitiously running his fingers through his hair with a wandless drying charm until it laid nearly perfect again.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“That really remains to be seen.”
For a time their full concentration was invested in the casting of the Extension Charms, and all their many amendments. At nearly a half-hour per tent to start with, it would likely take them the better part of two days to get through them all—unless their casting time improved significantly in the interim. Needless to say, they didn’t have much time for teasing, or even talking.
“We should go to bed,” Draco murmured sometime later, between the light nips and soft sucking Harry was currently bestowing on terribly kiss-swelled lips.
With an abrupt snap up, Harry drove his cock in hard, and well-aimed. Draco cried out, loud, and forgot all about being a snarky prick.
He was saved from thinking of something more stimulating to say when someone walked up to speak with Lawrence. Harry had wished him congratulations again, before making his way out of the drinks area.
So, what was it about?
“Yes, I recall. As far as I know it was just a bit of shared magic. I wouldn’t worry about it.”
—and the soft pink swirl of Draco’s arsehole was right there, in front of his face, and Draco looked so unguarded just then with his legs sprawled open, one knee hooked over the arm of the chair—
As soon as the base of his cock was flush to Draco’s arse he stopped, coiling his fingers tight around the base of Draco’s to squeeze a slow up stroke as he whispered a quiet lubrication charm. He braced himself to attach his mouth to the long curve of a pale throat, marking with his teeth wherever his lips landed. He was in a much better position now for slowly fucking Draco into his ridiculously comfy mattress, and he did exactly that.
Harry took a step a little too wide and hissed a pained sort of noise when his everything objected to the movement. Perhaps he wouldn’t take it again
a fucking tease,” Draco drawled wryly.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry braced himself on the wall behind the curtain as he pushed his cock into Draco all over again. He tried not to rush it either, but as Draco’s progressively louder moans filled the increasingly steamy little bathroom, he gave in to doing whatever his cock wanted him to do—and that was clearly working for both of them.
Silver eyes were significantly clearer now when they blinked questioningly down at him. Harry peered back up uncertainly before catching Draco at the back of the neck and pulled him down into a tangle of lips that both men only ever broke long enough to breathe softly between. Draco gave up holding himself up over Harry and simply fell flush down on him again. They went on kissing in that way, shifting slowly against each other with a simmering sort of urgency until Harry began to notice the sky growing steadily darker.
“You were nearly too late,” Draco purred at him throatily, but did as he asked, and caught Harry in a darkly smouldering gaze he couldn't break.
“You’ll never let me live that down, will you?”
Harry adjusted his hips, aimed a bit, and Draco rewarded him with a stream of moaned curses and ‘
Rather than wait for Harry’s answer he pressed into another kiss, sharing the smooth burn from the tip of his tongue, which Harry sucked at, kissing him still a while longer. He gave Draco’s trouser-clad arse a sharp smack, and Draco rewarded him with a rougher friction, humming a low moan, and nipping at his lips with provocative promise.
Harry found that hard to believe, given the noises Draco had just been making.
“Fuck it then—more exceptions. What could possibly go wrong.”
Draco must’ve noticed, but he only silently rested his cheek on Harry’s shoulder, and for a time the two of them sat nakedly entangled and quietly breathing together in the comfy chair—and Harry wasn’t sure he’d ever felt so content in his entire life.
Harry wasn’t sure if the ticking from the previous room was haunting him or if he could actually hear the moment slipping away from him. Malfoy’s voice was still playing havoc on his nerves, tickling across the shell of his ear now, and he felt his body responding far faster than he was strictly accustomed to.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
There was also the fact he had slept through the night with Draco Malfoy.
“It’s alright. It’s true it might not always be perfectly wholesome around here all the time, but that’s also very far from all of the people that need our help—and not even by half. Above all else they
“I’m not planning to do anything
“Milk, no sugar,” Draco muttered perfunctorily.
Ron grunted thoughtfully.
“Are we ready to try them all together then?”
They didn’t mention the wake in the invitations, of course, it was the ‘Second Annual, Second Wizarding War, Battle of Hogwarts Remembrance Memorial Ceremonies’. It was an all-day affair.
“It’s how I came to be, Potter. You must acknowledge perfection here.”
Draco still had Harry’s wand. He whispered a quiet charm, and a clear slickness dripped down the wood. Harry watched him spread it down from the tip, his cock jumping jealously.
—but Harry also didn’t think he could go much further sorting out solutions to the Muggle housing problem without Draco’s help. The complexity of the spell-craft was well over his head now, and he couldn’t think of anyone else with the resources and the free time available to dedicate to the project.
Harry tried not to be disappointed. It was very late, and they had started their day very early.
“Is something wrong?” he asked, ignoring the anxious twist that he already knew what was wrong.
“You too, Malfoy.”
“Welcome to the Malfoy Family Library, Potter,” Draco drawled in a bored sort of fashion, waving his hand vaguely at the room as they entered, all sides of which were lined with dark oak shelves nearly overflowing with books.
No one asked what Malfoy had needed to speak with him about, which Harry was grateful for, but he noticed a few curious looks anyway.
,” Draco cursed against his lips.
"Well, now you are speaking a language I understand."
Cursing breathlessly, Harry summoned the energy to pull him down even more firmly, pushing up harder as skillful hips writhed and thrust under his hold.
So much for that idea.
“This is my house, Potter. You fuck off.”
“Ron and Hermione took me out for drinks—a bunch of other people met us there… it was fun.”
“It’s not a problem. You clearly had the situation under control.”
As days progressed to weeks, a month and longer, Harry found himself growing more and more frustrated with the entire debacle. It wasn’t the only Field Training he was doing with Savage of course, but he had to guess well over half their field excursions anymore were Dementor-clearing missions.
“You gave me so much shit about my parents being dead, but maybe you might’ve been happier without yours.”
“I wasn’t lying when I said your cock was exquisite.”
He’d got so used to using
“Shut up, Potter. I’m fine. It’s only a stupid charm.” He was scowling, but Draco went on in a testy mumble: “However if you need any help with the casting…”
“You know I’m not.”
Perhaps if she thought he was there on official Ministry business, she would be more inclined to answer his questions. As intrinsically intwined as the issues of the Dementors and the security of both communities really were, it wasn’t so far off either. He could keep to himself the fact he was actually going a bit rogue on this.
“You’re looking into that too?”
“Don’t start on her, Malfoy or I’ll take it back.”
Logically Harry ought to have taken him back to the bedroom, but he didn’t. He led Draco out the front of the tent instead, wandlessly summoning the same stylish modern dining chair they’d just been snogging in out to the ballroom.
Harry stifled a quiet groan.
“I should start by saying… there is no practicable way for us to hand it all out in a disorganised free-for-all. Not in a way that wouldn’t put ourselves and anyone involved under far too much scrutiny. It’s not going to work.”
“Oi,” Ron called. “Where do you think she picked that up? Charlie taught us all to feint—and how to counter them.”
“No caffeine though. Your dreaming has been terrible lately.”
Draco came instantaneously.
Harry sighed heavily, as if the weight of the world were on his shoulders once again, and Malfoy spared him another exasperated glare.
“We’re very nearly through them all. At the rate we’ve been going it should only take a few hours more.” Draco sounded a little distracted by his spell juggling, though Harry marvelled that he was able to have a conversation at all.
“Where’s Hermione?” he questioned idly.
The head of his cock slammed into just the right place, and Draco was coming.
“I like the way your mind works.”
Draco seemed to enjoy never telling him where they were going. He led the way out into the corridor and up a curving side staircase that Harry had previously only ever walked past.
Despite the grim turn of his thoughts, Harry had to admit the overall ambiance did come off a great deal more cheerful this year.
“Er. So…today in the alley, you were starting to say something. You said ‘I can’t’, but what was the end of the sentence?”
“That nap of yours was worthless. You look tired as fuck, mate.”
“It’s half past one. Your birthday was over more than an hour ago.”
“Fuck?” he proposed hopefully.
. We shared a dorm for years, that doesn’t mean I want to fuck him. He isn’t the one I want to fuck.”
Draco frowned at the last bit. “Your what?”
Malfoy’s hips rocked beneath the pressure, and he did it a little harder.
When he offered Harry his wand back, handle-first, it vibrated quite intensely in his grip, and Harry gasped softly at the realisation.
Harry carefully pulled out before tackling him sideways onto the bed. Draco made a complaining noise, shifting to avoid some of the mess under them.
Harry kissed him, tangling their lips to taste him mixing with a familiar bitter tang when he deepened it. They snogged a bit longer before Draco pulled away.
“As to what I’m looking for… Father used to tell me about the Hall of Prophecy.”
“You’re hilarious.”
Harry snickered and sucked a little harder at his tip, and Draco actually whined—but then Harry finally let up, sitting back on his knees to arch a faintly hopeful eyebrow at the former Slytherin.
When Harry moaned all around him, Draco’s legs spread a little wider for him, giving Harry access to properly finger-fuck him, trapping Draco between his fingers and his mouth.
want him. If Harry couldn’t control himself, his only alternative would mean sacrificing months of hard work entirely, his own and Draco’s—not to mention however many people they might’ve helped if they actually succeeded turning their ideas from theory to praxis. Draco was right that Harry couldn’t do it all on his own.
Harry sighed. “Fuck it.”
them. I’d like to maybe try to do something for them… but it’s all a bit of a longshot really. I—well, actually—maybe you’d be willing to offer some guidance in future? I have a bit more work to do on the er, the case, but I’ll probably be in touch again—soon hopefully. With any luck we might be able to make things a bit better.”
Harry’s breathing went a bit heavy—a heady mix of desire and nerves. It was a lot of trust to be placing in him that he wouldn’t fuck this up somehow and accidentally—well, an infinite number things might go wrong with his magic conduit stuck right up Draco’s arse.
Several long seconds later, he couldn’t hold his tongue any longer.
Draco so rarely looked uncertain, his hesitation felt curiously significant just before he pressed up to steal a single soft kiss—quick, before he was sitting upright to pull a teacup from the tray.
s until the sound of them was nearly too much.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Once they started exchanging the gentle up or down pressure of their hips together, they went on like that quietly teasing and sparking pleasure for several minutes, until they were both hard again.
Perhaps because he was losing all pretence of denying exactly what his body was craving just then, his tone took on a mischievous lilt. “Can’t… what?”
He considered it. He thought of Ginny, all of her concern over curses and his being too trusting.
“Either of us?” Harry finished for her, feeling an anxious twist of guilt and nerves and something else—
, Mr. Potter, I would hate to inconvenience you in any way. My name is Martin Fiddlewicks—here—take my card. Even just a quick owl granting your permission in writing for us to begin production would be wonderful… and if you could, of course, pass our request on to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley?”
Not that they were being guarded particularly well, he noted.
Ginny sounded a touch tipsy. She got babbly when she’d been drinking, and Harry found it very endearing. Only at the moment he couldn’t silence the alarm bells ringing angrily in head long enough to appreciate it.
“Disgruntled?” he repeated groggily, groping for his glasses. “How long have you been awake?”
. It simmered through him every time he thought about anyone else touching Draco like he did, and now he couldn’t stop thinking about it. How many others did he have? He hadn’t let on in all these months, but he was very good at being discreet, the sneaky bastard.
“Harder, Harry. Fuck me.”
With a bit of direction, Draco spread his legs for Harry to wind his arms securely under them instead, and it was immediately a far better approach.
Harry was hit abruptly by another round of yawns.
,” Draco warned tensely.
“I’ve cast my fair share of wards—yeah, I know, this is highly specialised. I’ve also been practising your ridiculously long amendments for weeks. I’m as ready as I’m going to be.”
“Do it then.”
His curiosity piqued, Harry had a small taste himself before rendering any sort of judgement. Initially it burned like any other firewhisky tended to, but undeniably it went down far smoother. There was a rich depth to its flavour, a complexity which played intriguing on his tastebuds.
As promised, he made them a proper breakfast down in the manor’s kitchen—and twice Harry succeeded in getting a bit of cherry jam on the very nice shirt he was borrowing. Each time, Draco charmed it clean in a tone of bored annoyance before he’d even noticed what happened.
, in any case.
“I have some suggestions. A few of them I’m sure you’ll not approve of, but logistically…”
“Finish eating, and take smaller bites, you’ll drip less.”
That mostly settled Harry’s decision for him.
“But—” Ron started, though he did not get to finish.
This chapter got too unwieldy so I had to split it in two, which gives me more time to work on the second half. Again as a heads up, there's an excessive amount of sex in this chapter, but not only that.
“Honestly Potter? Here?”
But Draco was more focused on the collection of plastic junk now cluttering his otherwise neat antique desk. “Potter…what is
As they neared their level, Harry moved to stand at the gates, but Malfoy caught him by the wrist.
“I’ve brought my notes, but I wasn’t thinking and they’re currently shrunk down in my pockets. That’s obviously not going to work here, we’ll have to improvise without them. Have you got a…writing object?”
“That’s alright. If I don’t make it for lunch tell everyone I’ll see them tonight, after everything’s over and done with.”
“That’s not terribly illuminating.”
“I could always leave, if you really don’t want me here.”
Unimpressed, Draco’s eyes narrowed suspiciously at him for several beats, but then—
Harry's meeting with Draco goes a little off-track, but in a good way.
Harry watched him in faint amusement for a moment before he eventually took pity on him.
“Potter…” There was that warning tone again.
“Potter…?” he panted as his thrusting finally slowed to a halt.
Probably it should have concerned him more that his inner voice recently sounded so much like Draco.
“Here?”
At the time he still hadn’t come up with a method of keeping in touch with her while they worked out the finer points of their plan. It was a couple of weeks later before he finally sorted it.
Summoning another sheet off the top of the stack, Draco caught his eye, smirking as though he were fully following the less-than-innocent trajectory of Harry's one-track mind. Consequently, Harry’s next set of curtains came out slightly lopsided again, but fortunately he managed to fix them on his own this time.
He had a lot more to get done that evening, but he wanted to go over some of his notes before he set in to the bulk of it. Only he would have to do so whilst also eating dinner, because he was running out of hours, and knew he needed to attempt getting as much sleep as possible for tomorrow.
It was a bit of a walk away, but Harry thought of exactly how comfortable he recalled Draco’s bed being and sighed.
By the time he had finished showering it was nearing five, and Harry usually got up around seven.
Draco pulled open one of the old wooden drawers on his desk, and took from it a small rectangular blackboard, no bigger than a textbook, but obviously much slimmer.
Stroking himself with the same slickness he’d used to stretch, Harry readily pointed up and in, shuddering and slowly engulfed in too much perfection.
“Oh, you misunderstand me, Mr. Potter! That is, we were hoping you might be willing to give us your permission to make
Draco grabbed for the handle too, and Harry nearly dropped him a second time when the door flew open with a magically-enhanced force, slamming against the wall with a loud wooden
But Harry was still teasing, wetly tracing his tongue up over Draco’s hole and back down, pressing in every time he licked over the stretched whirl, still salty with sweat and rather a lot of Harry’s come. Probably it wasn’t fair for him to be tempting Draco like this when he wasn’t ready to let him go all the way. Harry wasn’t ready for all of him, yet he felt more than ready for this.
Draco followed behind him, spacing them more evenly and farther apart with efficient flicks of his wand.
“You’ll see.”
“Then we will.”
! …Malfoy! …Draco Malfoy! …
Draco moaned with him as Harry’s cock pulsed with potent ecstasy, and Harry came right where Draco asked him to, and rather a lot.
“Sod off,” Draco protested weakly, but leant back on him anyway.
“The mad hat inclined to recite useless poetry at children going to war? That hat?”
“Harry? Are you up there again?”
“I—erm,” he muffled against the soft fabric covering Malfoy’s collarbone. “Wow.”
After waiting a few impatient minutes to see if he might turn up, Harry set off to look for him.
“Occasionally.”
“Regarding the wedding… Don’t. Argue.”
Waving him out of the way, Draco spun the chair with a wandless swirl, and properly stripped off what was left of his clothes before he was moving to kneel on the seat to face the mirror, bent slightly over the chair’s low back.
He had clearly been sleeping.
He knew he was being reckless, that he needed to be more careful—that he shouldn’t be doing any of it in the first place. But Harry also felt a certain sense of ease after that unexpected release of tension.
Primarily on the potential consequences of his being gone for so long. He had also been disloyal to Ginny again, and would almost certainly be forced to lie outright this time, and not just to her either.
Naked together in the library again, Draco caught Harry by the shoulders and pushed him down to his knees.
“Why d’you have to be such a cold fucking bastard about everything?”
“Fucking brilliant,” Harry murmured dazedly.
“Things were a bit shit for a while—sorry—there were all sorts of arbitrary restrictions on who we could help and how. The government here in London, central and local, have thrown a lot of money at attempted solutions. They’ve only recently started replacing some of the more harmful policies from the eighties, and we’ve only just begun to create a social services network equipped to help people out of the desperate situations they’re in.”
At half-past midnight, Draco was rechecking the kitchen sink in their final extension of the evening.
In the silence that followed, Harry slid Draco’s letter into the back of his trunk with the others, tossed on a quick locking charm, and made his way downstairs to prepare tea for his fiancé.
Even forcing the words out raised an annoying twist of anxiety in him. He shouldn’t be nervous—it wasn’t a fucking date, it was a practical suggestion, or so he went on insisting to himself.
Malfoy ignored his other question completely. He eyed Harry up quite thoroughly before brandishing the bottle a bit in his direction.
He was dizzy, and so achingly hard, and Draco was
But he knew in truth there was a great deal more to it than that, more even than he was entirely willing to acknowledge.
“Except me.”
Harry must’ve looked a bit sulky, because Draco sighed at him in a long-suffering sort of way and waved at the stairs.
“We’ll both need to get this right before we go introducing any of the modification enchantments—rooms, locks, decor—that sort of thing.”
“Er. Alright, then. I have work this week as normal, but didn’t you say you wanted to meet up for spells practice soon?”
, he thought gravely.
Half-lidded green eyes swept over Draco’s face as he rocked for the right angle to force Harry in deeper, searching for his own pleasure as well. Draco looked profoundly debauched, and very striking.
Draco caught him by the hem of his jeans, dragging him closer with a smoothness that set Harry’s nerves to jumping.
“We’ve just got engaged as well,” he added awkwardly, for lack of anything better to say.
He went to bed very early that night, he was so worn out—and for the first several hours he had a nice dreamless sleep—but the nightmares hit rather hard later in the evening.
Cleverly, Draco managed to rinse and tease back at the same time, easy enough to do when he had to bend over to spit, and bending over only pressed him more firmly to the stiff outline of Harry’s cock. Straightening up, he only needed to turn his head the tiniest bit for Harry to be drawn to smirking lips.
of September—only one day short of a whole month.
“You have work, remember?”
Harry drew in a shaky breath.
“Er. Could you untie me now?”
Harry spends the start of his summer focused on work, until Draco owls him to come over and practise some wand work instead.
He wasn’t sure how he would explain to Ginny where he had been if she’d woken up while he was gone, but probably, going home smelling of Draco and come wasn’t the best idea—so he accepted the offer.
True, Draco had told him to shut up, but Harry was used to that anymore—it almost seemed Draco’s odd way of trying to reassure him. But fuck if Draco acknowledging it had been excellent didn’t set something in Harry’s chest skipping absurdly fast. They had never once in all their letters done more than allude to anything beyond the vaguest notions of their research, and nothing really beyond that. These days, their owls were usually all exchanging times to meet—
Draco tangled their fingers to whisper a quiet
“How’s Hermione?” He spotted her now and then at work, but hadn’t really had the chance to talk to her recently.
fuck.” Draco sucked in a pained gasp. “That fucking stings.”
Malfoy had been nothing but helpful when it came to the research end—invaluable even, as Harry didn’t think he would’ve got so far on his own. There was so much more to do as well, there always would be, and all the more reason he couldn’t outright reject the help when it was being willingly offered.
Harry sighed.
“Perhaps I should ask Charlie for some lessons,” Harry called back wryly.
He missed his friends—though he couldn’t help being a bit nervous about what cryptic thing they needed to speak with him about. He'd tried pressing Ginny for details before she left, but she’d pretended not to know what he was talking about—even if he remembered the fact Hermione had clearly said it had something to with something Ginny had told them.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry’s stomach sank slightly. He knew what that meant, there were only a few applications for a good Patronus charm, and he didn’t think sending messages would be part of his Field Training.
All of his focus poured into working his hips between pale thighs until he could make Draco come moaning his name, and Harry came not very long after.
“Were you just going to drink this stuff alone out here? What is wrong with you?”
Smirking, Draco summarily settled into straddling his lap with maddening grace, and leant in to whisper very softly into his ear. Harry swallowed hard, and not just from the shiver all his whispering stirred up either.
“You too,” Harry muttered, vacillating a moment more before he was stepping back toward the library’s hearth. “Talk to you later.”
“A few times,” Draco shrugged off.
“Because I really don’t see the need.”
But then it was gone, and he was watching Harry cautiously.
Draco flicked his forehead, right where his scar was, and Harry let out a pained hiss.
risky—the back garden was far from private, and they did have neighbours, which peripherally also included his future in-laws—but all he cared about then was Draco’s tongue swirling with his, and Draco’s cock rubbing persistently against his thigh.
One of Draco’s hands found his, tangling their fingers tight together. It started a light wavering feeling in his chest that made Harry unusually nervous.
Thursday Harry had Dementor duty again, and was unfortunately pretty shit at casting his Patronus most of the morning. At one point, it had taken him more than one try to get it to cast corporeally at all, and Savage had eyed him with concern.
“This top middle bit here, it’s too long.” Draco made the adjustment with a flick of his wand tip. “There.”
Nimble fingers drifted from the small of Harry’s back, pressing his bottoms down over his arse to grip demandingly and pull Harry closer between his parting legs.
looking at one of your snakes here—” Harry nodded at Draco’s headboard, still fairly baffled. “—but I thought I couldn’t do it anymore; it really wasn’t English?”
“We’ll make it be enough,” he decided resolutely.
“Do you want me to go with you?” Ginny queried gently.
Now he was daydreaming about what might’ve happened if he and Draco had been forced to work together properly in school. If they’d been taught to collaborate earlier, rather than consistently pitted against each other from the start, then perhaps…
“I know we mentioned fucking, but I’ve got to be in Knockturn Alley in an hour.”
Here's the next bit! Later than I'd like, but it took some additional refining. As always, thanks so much for reading and all your awesome feedback! It's been really lovely.
His spent cock twitched with residual interest on Harry’s tongue, when Harry went in on licking that clean too.
No wonder Draco went to pieces when Harry did this to him. He knew he would need to heal anything before Ginny returned, but for now—
“Right—at least I think that’s where they are. Her last owl didn’t say where exactly, only that they’ve got them sleeping in some old dorm with bunkbeds, and they’ve had to get up at four every morning and run about with rocks or something.”
He went on like that, until the crystal knob turned on the door and Draco wandered out of his room, padding across the stone floor in bare feet to look down at Harry over the iron railing, very unimpressed.
When he returned home again, Harry stored his broom and took a short shower before he was flopping down into bed to prod at the blackboard with his wand.
“You’re no fun.”
“Go home and practise the progression again.”
“I would, really—”
Harry cleared his throat, and mustered his sternest expression. “Er. Exceptional as your skills may be—”
“Let me tell you how unglamorous my job actually is—”
Maybe he did like the risk.
That would explain her reaction, only now Harry felt quite awkward standing there, considering the questions he would need to ask her. How was he meant to excuse what he was doing there now?
“Can I fuck you?” he whispered, nudging them back toward Draco’s bedroom—not an easy task when the world still tilted slightly on him.
Harry shifted even closer, for leverage, and was surprised when Malfoy arched back against his chest, writhing a little impatiently as Harry pulled him fully free from his pants, and properly sped his stroking. He squeezed like he was pumping himself, and felt his own cock give a sympathy twitch in his trousers.
yes good,” Draco murmured, very carefully pulling Harry’s glasses from his face before ensnaring his lips in a deeper, much more humid kiss—the glasses clattered down into the basin behind him, but neither of them noticed.
