It was a combination of things that sent him off the deep end.
"I'll tell you a trade secret. This brand here, they got the mallowmarsh recipe, copied it right out. But they've kept it under wraps, yeah? Don't want a lawsuit. This is what you want, the one with the blue logo. Er - toothpaste-free, I promise."
The kitchen was silent with the exception of a few passing remarks from the boys. Monty grunted his approval for some dishes, but otherwise the meal was spent in relative quiet. Remus felt the tension in the air like a vice on his head, getting tighter with each blank, curious, or polite look he received from Harry.
In the pandemonium - strangers grappling him, voices shouting over each other, the meager light of a grim sky burning his eyes - he latches onto one discernible fact: It's day. Not night. The sun is obscured, but that's fine because
When the boys returned, they sat quietly at the table, exchanging meaningful glances but nothing more. Monty snatched up Arthur's letter and handed it to Harry, who scanned the words carefully once...twice...three times he read the letter before moving on to the supply list, eyebrows nearly reaching his hairline. He carefully folded the parchment and placed it back in its envelope before handing it back to Monty, who passed it back to Arthur, who studied the address intently.
Draco frowned at him rather dramatically, as if he'd started speaking Parseltongue, and then peeked over the edge of the table. Snatching up a couple of rags, he put them on the ground to rest his knees against. Harry couldn't imagine how woodstain-soaked rags could be better for his trousers than a dusty floor, but he wasn't about to correct him. Draco settled more comfortably on the ground just off of Harry's ledge, then met his eyes in a way that seemed utterly without pretence, but was still a mystery to him.
James pulled a face and a tear spilled over. He swiped it away quickly and managed a quick nod, throat burning.
Harry took the broom up to his porch instead of trudging up the stairs, feeling too full and sated. Christmas Eve dinner was an intimate affair at Blupin Frottage - just Sirius, Remus, Draco, and Scorpius - but his stomach was full and his eyes were itchy with sleep. Tomorrow, they would find out exactly how many Weasleys could fit in his little cabin.
James gravitated at once to the antique settee across from the fire and Draco almost sat beside him by habit, until the boys crammed themselves there instead. He chose the loveseat, perpendicular to the settee, with his mother. His unblinking father sank into the wingback armchair, his perfectly straight back to the fire.
"I don't know what you expected of this, Weasley," the Healer snapped. "Your own wife can tell you this is a process, and an imperfect one at that."
Harry wriggled around on his bum with barely contained glee, his legs hanging over the edge. They were so high up, it almost felt like flying! No, even better - it was the closest he'd ever managed to recreate the feeling of escaping the bunker. The sort of blissful, pure, natural euphoria that only comes about once or twice in a lifetime, and he'd somehow found it again - and
The voice feels like a physical blow to his heart and he clenches the edge of the metal sink, willing it to fade or...or, keep going. He wonders who his addled brain has conjured this time. It doesn't sound familiar, which is brilliant, so brilliant. He's just decided this disembodied voice can stay when he hears furniture scrape across the concrete on the other side of his door.
"The ones
he said.
"You're right!" Remus admitted, suddenly desperate. "You're absolutely right. Things got very dark in our world for a few years, I won't lie. And Harry and his friends bore the ugly brunt of it. They were children growing up in a war, but they fought for a better future and they won it!" He cleared his throat gruffly as fifteen years of emotion bubbled up to the surface. "Hogwarts - magic - it's all so wonderful, Harry went on and on about how much he loved it, how much he felt like that school was his home. He gave everything he had to see it through the war and he disappeared just as we were coming out the other side. H-he never got to see it, but everyone else has… Twelve years' worth of students have come to Hogwarts since then, they've played Quidditch, won the House Cup Tournament, done homework by the lake. All those things that Harry loved, even in the middle of a war, our students get to enjoy now without fear."
team?" Arthur asked.
, James angled himself to sign so that both boys could see, but Arthur's eyes were spinning in panic and he didn't take it in.
"Since we've all got such pleasant memories of Malfoy Manor."
They ride together to the edge of the forest in quiet reverence…until Potter starts babbling about breadcrumbs, Draco chides him for wanting more food at a time like this, and the kindling catches once more.
unless they were recently returned from the dead or from studying orangutans by immersion.
"Take off your trousers."
Blaise snorted, barked a laugh, and then snorted again, doing a wonderful impression of a kneazle with a cold. "How's that working out, Mr. Malfoy?"
"Cos Dad
Harry and Monty had written once or twice on the Malfoy Mess. Monty was jealous of Harry's attention, Harry was feeling simultaneously lonely and smothered (though Ron had required Hermione to crack that code because Harry was still rubbish at expressing himself, even on paper). Ron and Hermione both thought they were being dramatic and uncommunicative, but now Ron could sort of see what Harry was talking about:
“Has it got windows?” he asked, and though he couldn’t see it on their blurry faces, he could hear the pity in the answer:
"No," he answered readily. Of course he wasn't. But he
Yesterday marked the 30th birthday of our beloved Boy-Who-Lived and Man-Who-Conquered, who disappeared 12 years ago, and shoppers at Diagon Alley were astonished to see our hero walk the streets again! Mr. Harry Potter was accompanied by two children, an unidentified man, long-time friends Auror Ronald Weasley-Granger and Unspeakable Hermione Granger-Weasley, as well as a small contingent of undercover Aurors who came forward as the crowd became more excited.
forcing - what's it,
James threw the pillow across the room and dragged himself out of bed again. He tried the door, then had to turn around and retrieve his wand to unlock it. He swung the door open and came face to teary face with Monty.
“Oi, you!” Potter cries out suddenly, looking over Draco’s shoulder. Draco swings around. The old crone is peering at them through a little tinted window-slat mounted in the iron door. “Open the door!” That slight tremor from before returns to Potter’s voice.
James shook his head, standing up to stack the plates. He started to limp over to the sink.
"Ma'am, Voldecorp didn't
him to keep his wand on him! I told him - "
"Because it fucks your magic?" Potter's trying miserably to clean his glasses on his sweaty shirt, but it's only making a smeary mess. His hands are already bruising from his assault on the door.
"Waffles!" Arthur shouted, bursting out of the loo and leading the stampede down the stairs. James wasn't sure he would live to regret teaching them how to make waffles from scratch, but he was glad they were out of the room. With a lurching movement, he rolled back toward Draco, unwrapping himself as he went. Everything seemed, well, less
“Alright, Malfoy, what’s diversity then?” Harry snaps.
James nodded slowly but didn't respond. Monty tried not to take it personally… James was always hurtling into things at breakneck speed, and it was a testament to how out of it he was feeling that he wasn't already plunging into this idea.
Minerva waits, but no other description is offered.
Harry fumbles and drops the Pop-Tart in the sink, his heart skipping a beat before slamming his eyes shut. This is not the first time he's hallucinated, particularly after a long time without Fin's wretched company. He screws up his face against the deep, desperate voice calling his name, trapped behind the door and reality - because it's most definitely not real.
"Then what is this?!"
"Y'alright?" Monty asked, poking Remus in the shoulder a bit harder than was strictly necessary.
"At least three seasons out of date!"
If he had to face the music, he'd at least bring the boys along to soften the blow.
4:30pm
Arthur shuffled through the teeming pile of letters on the kitchen table, finally landing on what he thought was the start of it all.
, James explained, watching him examine the little buttons. Draco pressed a button experimentally and recoiled slightly when the mobile emitted a loud beep. James had been staying at the Manor all week while "a discrete and certified team" dealt with his kitchen. As he watched Draco flip the phone closed and open, closed and open, he dreaded to think what damage a team of Ministry wizards would do to his tried and true Muggle appliances.
Even if Harry was dead, he deserved more than to simply disappear into oblivion. He deserved his last moments to be known. Ron would find those answers, he would find Harry if he was out there, but at the very least he would find what happened to his friend.
“Sure am glad Corporate is takin’ away ten percent of me hard-earned paycheck in the form of reduced hours!” he continues, practically shouting. The entire group of suits is clearly listening, but trying to appear as if they aren’t. “Was dangerously close to openin’ up a savings account, I was. Now I won’ have to deal with that

something building between him and Draco. Something more than friendship.

I won't run off to Draco and Obliviate him..."
"It just doesn't sound like Monty..." she said after he recounted a particularly vicious row in their kitchen some weeks ago. "He's never - he's never hurt you, has he?" she asked suddenly, her heart sinking at the implications.
do this. Arty stopped screaming long enough to take a breath and start screaming again, looking a little less terrified and a little more excited. If Arty was doing it without passing out or falling off, Alec could too!
He asked. James nodded.
"Mr. Potter will recognize the invitation as an attempt to assuage - "
Alec sucked air through his teeth but still didn't step back. Good. He'd make a Gryffindor out of his brother yet.
Determined not to fly off the handle like a teenager would, Harry tried to be proactive and think of what Kim might say to him in their next session. She'd probably say he was being stupid by giving her the credit instead of recognizing that he'd learnt a thing or two about the human psyche in his life. Or she'd take all the credit and order herself a trophy.
, he explained.
"Behind us."
Harry began signing again but McGonagall interrupted.
, he should have toned down the shine, why did he try to show off his temper skills at a time like this?!
"How'd you think I knew how to get you home? Our date - ah, that is to say, our night out."
Draco swallows heavily. A bead of sweat drips from his hair into his eye, stinging and blurring his vision. He blinks rapidly, staring down at his wand in mounting horror.
to carry on with his chocolate. And Malfoy had insisted that it would be an abomination unto mankind if he were to abandon his work, so James shoved the feeling aside and carried on with the mail-orders.
“Let’s get you settled, dumplings,” the old sorceress coos. Her withered hands are strong as she helps them up. On their way out, Potter strokes a lamp shade and giggles serenely.
Now was the moment of truth. Now he would stop pretending these could possibly be two separate people. James Charming was Harry Potter, there was no denying it.
Harry's mouth went dry.
"James's unpackin' the food now, have you eaten?"
"I'm manager of my department," he explains. "Jewelry Wholesale & Consignment."
Dad said.
James exhaled heavily, his worst fears beginning to take form. Monty really had no idea how difficult this would be.
) for their lightning-fast beta work! What a Drarry squad we have, where I can put up the bat-signal and get two betas on my work within minutes.
"I-I'm sorry, I thought you were - " Remus stammered. Didn't this man call them
and not the no-doubt-just-as-stubborn-and-annoying-as-ever
Harry eagerly launched into a long series of signs, his nimble hands flying through the motions so naturally. Ron wondered if he would ever catch up, once he started learning. Because of course he would be learning how to communicate with Harry; now that he had him back, nothing would keep him from his friend.
That was true but it wasn't what he wanted to say. His words were failing him and it only frustrated him further.
Didn't even realize, just said something about how he's soft and warm and sweet on the inside but hard on the outside - "
"Just like our sessions this past autumn," Malfoy said, "I'd like you to lay it out as a narrative. Don't concern yourself with whether something may or may not be important to Weasel. Just talk me through what happened."
"I - well,
"Er, you probably didn't notice me. I had a few years to go by the time you left."
“Come on, don’t be shy.” He smiles benignly around the room, seeming to really enjoy himself while Bellatrix is barely managing to hold back a snarl. “Harry, my boy?”
"So he's like a celebrity?" Arthur grinned over at his dad. "Cool!"
Charming started signing something slowly and Draco was interested to see his mouth following along with the signs, a silent pronunciation meant only for himself. Gibbs sounded it out as Charming spelled: "Exp...ell...iarmus,
, but he can't be sure. He can't bring himself to ask. Draco follows the angle of his body to peer across the nest. He can nearly see the shadow of the Dark Lord, even now. He can nearly hear the roar of the Killing Curse, can nearly watch it sinking into Potter's firm chest, can nearly witness his Mum's unwavering courage as she lies to a mad man's face.
"Springs," he says. Draco stares at him. "Mattress springs," he goes on. "The metal kind. Coils."
. The ultimate rehab. Once he was on his feet again, he never stopped.
Harry dropped into a chair that was cushier than it looked and caught Malfoy's wince as the leather creaked and squeaked with water. He offered a half-smile, half-smirk in answer and Malfoy took his own seat, pulling a notepad and quill close.
He shivers and makes to cast a warming charm, but Potter grabs his hand to stop him. Right. They've had enough warming charms to last them a lifetime. He eases back against the torn leather of the backseat, willing himself to stop shivering like a berk. He concentrates on all the layers of clothes keeping him warm. A gentle, non-threatening warmth. Potter hasn't let go of his hand.

Sirius wrinkled his nose and barely opened his mouth before Harry interrupted.

, Mr. Charming," Draco repeated loudly and pointedly. "At the very least, you'll hobble out of the examination with Healer's orders to eat something other than chocolate." And wasn't that the crux of this mess, the fire behind Draco's foul mood this week, that the brilliance behind Charming Chocolates came down to
He closed the shop an hour early. It would have been two hours early, but he didn't have Monty's booming voice to usher people out so he had to settle for gesturing stupidly at a few customers during a rare lull.
Gryffindor and Slytherin tables are on opposite sides of the Hall, but that doesn't keep them from their morning round of taunts. Draco hardly knows what he's saying sometimes, the cutting words are automatic. He only knows that he never feels properly hungry until he’s screaming across the sea of students at Saint Potter, the God of Gryffindor. And then he wants a heaping plate of greasy sausages.
“Hermione?”
James blinked, then nodded slowly. He started to sign something but then changed his mind.
"I'm - Well, that's sort of a blessing and a curse, isn't it?" he said gently. "I lost my mum when I was a baby, too. But, I still miss her."
In hindsight, Draco saw the signs. At the time, however, he was distracted by Charming's letter.
He stared at it dumbly. Four pages, signed D. Malfoy. Each paragraph was a rousing review of the chocolates he'd sent on Monday. From presentation to taste to Shipping & Handling, Malfoy had an opinion on everything.
Or to ensure the explosion.
Al and Ar were coming home in a couple weeks. They could push this off until after the holidays. Until then…
James blinked.
"More tea, Mr. Char - I mean, James?"
“Immortality?” Minerva is not impressed, but Albus makes a quiet “oh?” of interest.
Not knowing what to say, she bent her head and kissed his fingers.
and I can take care of myself!" His voice cracked at the end, which was really poor timing. Just one more round of puberty potions, he reminded himself. He wanted to break something, but settled on picking up and throwing down the Daily Prophet again.
right?" Harry clenched his hand into a fist and took it off the table, away from prying eyes. "Your fifth year, there was a corrupt ministry official who came to teach. She had it out for you, what with the war picking up and politics not being pure as the driven snow… She gave you detention, had you write lines with a blood quill, which left you with that scar."
Vague memories flashed across Ron's mind - playing Quidditch obsessively for days and days at the Burrow. The sun shone bright all week. The sky was clear. The ground was dry and hard, providing a good kick off -
, in a way that he didn’t feel quite as burdened with his past when she was around.
Harry watched in detached fascination as Malfoy scooped some ice from the Muggle freeze box into a little plastic bag before applying it gently to a seemingly random spot on his son’s leg. The men in the corner of the kitchen were giving him significant looks, but he had no idea what they were signifying. He shrugged at them and they went back to giggling at each other.
"Did you say something, Scorpius?" Daddy asked him, for all the world to hear.
Footsteps approached tentatively and all too soon, Draco's legs appeared next to him where Harry crouched under the table like an oversized block of wood, which he might as well be with his useless brain. This was no steel bed bolted into the ground; he was still exposed, still within reach, and Draco had all the reason in the world to drag him back out.
"Please—" Potter groans lowly.
“Don’t.” His voice was cold and hard, stubbornly unyielding in the simpering face of this shattered man who, wonder of wonders, actually conceded. He pulled his hands away and left them floating in the air between them, fluttering anxiously. Harry closed one eye and squinted with the other, taking in a face he once knew. “Sirius?”
"Yes, that! What is that?" he said again.
James said simply. Abbott looked uncomfortable.
"Potter," he sneers. "What do you have to say for yourself?"
Between? Between what?
“It seems like the sort of thing I’d do. Especially to you.” There. That was close enough, he reckoned. James scowled, sighed, set his mug down, and ran his hands through the bird’s nest on his head. Draco couldn’t see his face with his head ducked down like that, but he was willing to bet there was a glare in place for him.
Harry gave a pleased sort of smile before turning to Ron.
"Dimensional travel is different from time travel, actually, there's a whole subsection of - "
What we don't have is boys playing nice with each other.  Draco is a little hung up on some things, and Monty is pushing again, and James is confused.
They fell into their usual conversation, like they always did when Draco came over. Except it felt a little more special, a little more like a proper date, because Draco was a little more dressed up today. He wore sharp black trousers and a thin black belt, paired with a sleek blue shirt that made his hair practically sing. Overall, he looked more...pointy, than usual. But a good pointy. Like when James managed to suck a candy cane down to the finest point -
Static.
He settles for shivering on the floor instead of returning to the bed, and remains there for much of the remaining Lenny Days. But when Lenny starts carding his fingers through his hair while he tries to sleep (as if such a thing could be comforting!), Harry hides under the bed instead. Lenny can't reach him here. He can't see him either, but still Harry keeps his hands chaste. Lenny has a way of knowing Harry's misdeeds even when he isn't around to watch.
, he signed immediately, his hands fumbling around each other.
“Well, best get to it. Lots of paperwork this week.” He nods politely at the others before pushing through the door, which only opens halfway before crashing to a stop. “Mr. Malfoy! Are you quite alright? Did you need something?”
that McGonagall woman had said. He did count it. He counted all three as perfectly valid reasons to keep Al and Ar away from that mad world.
The door remains locked. Draco meets Potter’s gaze. The room seems to shimmer with magic, but they can’t grasp it.
“Oh - cancer!” Draco realized, recalling the month he’d studied strictly Muggle illnesses. “You thought I had Muggle cancer?”
"Well. Maybe it's best. If they'd stuck round to help, maybe Dad would never've met Monty," he said, trying to sound a bit more chipper than he felt at the moment. He wondered if he could find his long lost grandparents online... Minutes ago, he would have wanted a happy family reunion and the promise of more presents on his birthday. Now he just wanted to give them a piece of his mind.
he amended, nodding at the customer.
, he tried. As soon as he said it, he knew it was the wrong way to go. Malfoy barked a laugh and flipped open his schedule book. Clearly he thought James was pitying him for being sick.
he signed gently, letting his eyes soften a bit.
This was the core of their issues, of their constant bickering. Monty didn't just love him, he
They were talking about work, mostly. Scorpius tried to keep up. Somehow it had to do with school, which wasn't the same as work, not according to Mummy. Mr. James's wand was spewing out smoke a mile a minute.
he said after he'd set up his wand. She tried not to rely on the translation as much as possible, but he signed so fast and she couldn't get her eyes to stop reading.
James snapped his fingers almost on reflex and Arthur pulled a face.
“There’s all sorts of boy and girl mannequins in couple-y positions,” Seamus insists. “I wanna see the men holding hands for once!”
Draco was about to cut off the blubbering idiot when Charming himself elbowed him into silence.
"You're rebuilding boundaries and you've suddenly been thrust into adulthood," she said now as they strolled through the massive, wild field behind Blupin Frottage. "This is going to be a deeply personal process, one that no one else can understand."
James blinked, shaking his head frantically. A sick feeling in his stomach told him that it was over now, that this incident was the source behind Draco's constant undercurrent of ire against him, told him that James couldn't fix what Harry had done.
"Have you noticed…?" Ron trailed off, nodding across the room. Hermione could barely contain her grin.
“Transferred, s’what I heard,” Seamus murmurs, leaning on his elbows into the tight circle gathered at the table.
Harry shrugged. He was completely out of his element. "I don't know how, but I know I do. My heart misses her even if my brain can't remember." Draco was going to murder him.
Potter can warm any room.
Potter laughs at him, dropping his hand. Flushing, Draco bristles. The match is lit, the kindling catches. The familiar fire between them roars to life.
over his head at the woman.
He wondered if he should traipse upstairs to save Arty's life now or give it another few minutes. He didn't hear anything, but that didn't mean James wasn't up there signing furiously or flinging some poor feline out the window.
[Voicemail: Message from Saturday, January 22nd, 1:21pm]
. Alec squeezed back.
“Like a racist,” Potter croaks in apparent agreement as he slurps his stew directly from the bowl. Draco peeks over the arm of the chair and thinks he’d rather suck the stew right from Potter’s plump lips. The leather of the arm dips and the strange design grabs his eye again.
"Put a warrant out!" Ron barked at Rachel, who turned her entire body in order to give him a Look. Right. Too aggressive. "Sorry. Er - Theodore Nott, Romilda Vane, and that Montague bloke."
“Everything alright?” Remus peered at him over his tea, looking as comfortable as he ever did at the little table in the breakfast nook - which was to say, not at all. Harry was the one who insisted they use it. If he sat with his back to the rest of the house, it was almost like being outside. The alcove was warm with plenty of light and a spectacular view of the mountains. Somewhere between the wild back garden and the distant treeline of the Forbidden Forest sat an old, abandoned silo he had yet to explore. Perhaps he would make another trip across the field today. He could do whatever he liked.
Scraping sounds came through the radio as chairs were presumably pushed back from the table. The voices were fading away, overly polite goodbyes and stiff words leading their magical guests to the front door, far away from the walkie-talkie hidden within a hollowed-out book on the table. Alec dropped his arms and jumped down from the bed, depositing the radio on his large desk. Arthur climbed up to perch on his own desk - which was an old door mounted on two saw-horses. Too late he remembered the small puddle of paint he had left on its surface…
in Draco's mouth. For some reason.
“Thank - thank.” That was what his brain decided on. Brilliant. James bit his lip to smother a grin and nodded decisively. When they moved on, they seemed to...move on.
"Alright?" he said, sitting on the edge of the mattress in the space behind Arthur's knees.
The light fixtures hanging overhead were scarce and the illumination they provided under green glass shades was scant. A hippogriff of a jukebox stood proudly centered at the back wall, blaring something just this side of screeching, which Sirius would love. The floor was dominated by a billiards table with worn, grease-stained felt, and booths with padded benches packed every inch of space along the sides.
[Voicemail: Message from Sunday, January 2nd, 11:33am]
, I meant it
Potter can warm any room.
Silence reigned in the kitchen once more.
Even a tomb can't be as stale as the air in this room.
Monty scrunched up his face, making him look simultaneously twenty years younger and twenty years older.
Harry shot a glare at a half-distraught, half-elated Sirius and then continued pacing the length of Ron and Hermione's shared office.
"But yer usin' yer wand more," Monty went on. It was one thing to see Hermione set a tea kettle to boil instantly or Ron to repair the facing on their front counter. But nowadays he was watching James summon his potion from down the hall, or light his way to the loo at night, or even keep the bathwater hot for hours while adding all sorts of goopy potions to the bubbles... Monty's little bird doing magic was an odd sight.
"Oh, er... a cannae tell ye that," he mumbled.
. Ugh, it's tedious and uncouth and bloody well necessary if he doesn't want it to end here, on this sofa.
The boys weren't giggling now, they were staring at the professors with something resembling horror. Harry and Monty were equally shocked. Too late, Remus realized his mistake as Harry began signing.
"Yeah? The mind does like to play tricks on us in solitary confinement. Do you still, sometimes?"
, Arty signed back, pale and twitchy. It was James's turn to smirk. Maybe he could get McGonagall to demonstrate her ultimate transfiguration skills.
, he began. Of course, back then his exact age had been an approximation. They said he was eighteen when he woke up in hospital, back strapped to a board, leg in traction, hip reduced to grit. They estimated he was thereabouts anyway and the paperwork was easier if he was of age. July 1st became his new birthday.
"Oh -
James could remember a deluded time in his life, just after the war, when he imagined nothing else for his future than to crush the three year Auror training program, graduate with an honor or two, and work forever with Ron at his side. They would wear the blood red robes with the shiny gold clasps, sporting matching badges and custom wrist holsters. He’d marry Ginny, wait a few years before having kids, and spend every Sunday at the Burrow. He certainly never thought he’d be a humble chocolatier as Ron ran himself ragged to keep him safe while his Auror partner - some Ravenclaw James barely remembered from school - vanished without a trace.
"More chocolates?" she asked.
“Mr. Flamel…”
The door swings open and the camera backs up rapidly as Cedric steps out. He freezes upon seeing the camera before flashing a dazzling smile. Behind him, Arthur claps a hand on his shoulder.
"Stow it, Malfoy," she said. He stowed his words, but he could brood as much as he liked. "Cut it off now, one way or the other. It's usually possible to mend a potion before it combusts."
with a madman. Two days wandering the British countryside until he made it back to Hogsmeade was, quite literally, like a walk in the park. "I am an adult and I don't need you lot telling me what I can and can't do!"
"Yer da' an' I've been building forts all year while you've been away," he said loudly. A thumping sound came from the boys' bedroom; did Dad drop a trunk? "Movies and popcorn, Doctor Who every night in our fort," he went on, practically shouting. Alec frowned at him in suspicion.
“What?” Potter grunts, sounding more like himself.
"Two wizards with no children," Ron mumbled. "Not aggressive, but there's no reason for them to be here." The tension in his voice shot straight to James's spine. He wanted to hover over his kids, to cover their vulnerable bodies with his own until they were on the train, and he would tear apart anyone who so much as looked at them -
“Yep,” he confirmed around a bite of toast.
"What did he say?!"
"Draco," Potter says seriously, peering up at him with his huge green eyes. Gods but Draco wants him to look up at him like that with his mouth around his—"Don't be a cock about this, just listen. There's this story, see, and—" But Draco isn’t listening.
"He's not so scared, really," Arthur insisted.
He missed his catch and fell back too far, landing on his bum in the grass before he could get his uncooperative legs under him. Kim joined him, sitting with her back against the ladder and blocking him from his play.
"Hedwig...?"
in that cauldron?" he asks incredulously, forgetting his manners in a state of plain shock.
When Ben's hand comes to rest on the back of Harry's head - on a non-mushy part - he doesn't pull away. He leans into the touch, then painstakingly shuffles closer until he can fit his head on the man's bony hip. Ben's hand hesitates, then carries on stroking his hair. More tears leak out without his permission, but he doesn't care. He blinks up at the storybook, but can't get the words to focus. He's not sure if that's because his glasses are missing or if it's got something to do with the pounding of his brain.
"Have you had a physical examination yet?" Draco asked blandly. Charming shook his head and furrowed his brow in a question. "I'd like that to happen today. If you're amenable, we might be able to do something for your hip and your voice."
"You're a cheeky one, aren't you?"
Daddy ruined it by snorting and laughing, though he tried to smother it with his napkin.
"Let's talk price range, and then we can look at some options," Malfoy said amicably enough and Harry allowed himself to relax.
Draco could not stop thinking of oral and it was all James's fault. Potter's fault. He was Potter when he was mad at him. Charming when he was feeling frisky. Never Harry - a dull name, total romance killer.
he thought, bristling.
A wide and true smile spread over Draco's pointy face, bigger than any smirk or shit-eating grin or pinched laugh he'd shared before. His eyes squinted from the force of it, nearly disappearing between pink cheeks and furrowed brows. Draco laughed himself hoarse, hunched over and still cradling the travesty to his chest as if it were precious.
James hesitated.
"Short one, for the love of god..." Al muttered, sinking his face into his hands in a way that made him look like his father.
"Who's been in a relationship with a petty Mind Healing berk, you or me?"
Harry takes him to bed and Draco protests all the way, offers to sleep on the cursed sofa, offers to give him his space. He doesn't want to crowd. He doesn't want to be where he's not wanted, and he's clearly not wanted in bed.
Draco's carefully coiffed locks slipped smoothly from his head to the floor, leaving him bald and looking like the merfolk of Black Lake. And cold. What he wouldn't give for Charming's warm knit cap at that moment.
“I’ve got a job.”
"And blingin' stress is bad," he summed up from many previous sessions. She popped her thumbs up into finger-guns.
"James and a've been together for two years now," Monty explained, clearly thinking to clear up her confusion. "Known each other for a spell before then too - "
"S'not really decent, is it?" Staring straight ahead, he was captivated with the way the rungs of the ladder got bigger as he swung forward, then smaller as he fell away, then bigger, smaller….
Remus thought his heart would surely stop if he didn't get some answers soon. Of all the questions, Harry had to go and ask one that denied his own identity at the same time…
, Potter," Severus S. says. As a manager, he wears a vest - rather than a tunic - that is pinstriped silver. His name-tag, like Draco's, is gold. "Whatever would we do without your...attention?"
know...that he was just trying to wrap up this process as quickly as possible to get Harry Potter out of his hair.
He just hoped Hogwarts could handle them.
"What'd they see?" asked Monty, lagging just behind James.
"I'm pleased the Amortentia I bathed in this morning is having such a subtle effect on you."
us to school?!"
"You bastard!" he hissed, chest heaving as he took in the sight of his murdered tresses. Could a hair growth potion work against that particular curse? There were so many factors to consider when using those potions, and they never managed to regrow anything quite the same as it was. He would be ruined. He would never hear the end of it from the real Blaise!
"He's gotta push you to do more, be better - "
, James went on carefully.
of a woman - "
he said, only just fully realizing the truth in his own words.
"Because she's a young, pretty Pureblood girl," Draco said flippantly. "They like to see her at those posh academic galas in dress robes with her hair nicely done, but they won't bother to read her work."
"What?" Potter jolts, but remains crouched next to the door. The old crone examines the room eagerly but she must not be able to see much through the slat, for her eyes return to his after just a moment. Draco is rooted to the spot.
Hermione clambers to her feet, fixing her blue tunic with a huff. A plastic finger is stuck in her bushy hair, but she doesn't notice as she stoops to retrieve the fallen book.
This had all been his choice, not anyone else's.
. Now was the time for hysterics! All he wanted out of today was a lazy morning, a late breakfast, maybe some flying, and to catch a show after supper at his favorite restaurant. Instead he was led on a wild niffler chase all over the northern hemisphere. In
to see you again, my boy."
He wanted Charming's penis.
He lifted his left hand, which was still holding the absurdly huge wrench, and only just remembered to drop it in his lap before bringing his closed fist to his lips and
And then Potter went and got himself killed. The world mourned ostentatiously while Charming was born. Charming still managed to stumble into trouble, albeit a lot more quietly than Potter ever did. He became a single father, worked for every Knut, centered his whole life around providing for two children. And he gifted the world some damn fine chocolate. It was hard to begrudge someone any of that. Potter was surly, even when he had everything going for him. Charming was - well, certainly not chipper, and thoroughly broody sometimes, but he was not a jabbering idiot that was always itching for a fight. Not like Potter. Not yet, anyway...
"Come on, Harry," Ron went on, stepping over to allow Remus and Teddy inside. "Remus teaches Defense, he'll be in the compartment with them the whole time. And there's a team of Aurors next door, so you don't need to worry!"
Dad snapped back to reality when Ginny approached him.
"Well...it wasn't something I really thought I

of how much he was missing. Sense and understanding flooded in with each session.
Alec wondered.
, Dad requested, getting to his feet.
, James retorted, annoyed. What other choice did he have at the time? He couldn’t afford bus-fare every day, there was no underground nearby, and cabs were out of the question even if they would come to their neighborhood.
"Nice hair, Potter! Do you even own a comb? Pass the sausages, Pansy…"
"What? Who?"
The chapter title SHOULD be "Crash and Burn" or something less stupid, but.........
Unknown hands, strangers' hands that are so exquisite, so different from his own or Fin's, help haul him to the surface when his trembling legs threaten to give out on the steep ladder-stairs. He bangs his elbow on the trap-door, but doesn't feel it.
"I'm not tired." Ben smiles with such sickening love that Harry springs to his feet and hurls the book at his face. "I SAID NO!"
"Green light, lotta green light, dragons, a bad fire, flying on brooms, the white owl and orange cat, you, Hermione, an old man wae long white hair an' a beard, some tetchy blond git, an actual
Things were going well nowadays. Running smoothly. There were no fires to put out, Malfoy had even called it quits and declared that James was fighting fit. But without a battle to fight, James was restless and stressed.
"It's a good name," was his defense.
"Oh ma god," Monty's voice boomed out from the platform. "James, ye Richard!" James reached behind his back awkwardly and fumbled the window shut, muffling Monty's latest rant.
could fix.
"We knew that."
There's mud soaking through his jeans, wet grass between his fingers, and for the first time in fourteen years, he chokes down a breath of fresh air.
Potter is on good terms with it.
James sighed. That was another thing they'd agreed on two weeks ago - they wouldn't dig themselves any deeper until after the holidays.
Arthur and McGonagall turned their attention to the Thing while Harry sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. The whirring increased until it was as loud as a tea kettle's whistle. Remus winced at the noise but couldn't keep his gaze from Harry for long.
"Been readin' up on it," Monty said proudly after a long pause. "Got myself some books week before last. S'all right here, ready tae go, ye won' have tae plan a thing! S'all worked out!"
Pushing back from the counter, she turns to head back to her department, bypassing the Belrose display without a second glance. There’s a distinct lack of sway to her hips.
To his eternal shame, Monty called Ron and Hermione.
Heaving the roast over to the table, James slammed it down, missing the trivet by a mile, and hurried to close the window just as -
"You go," Alec said, nudging his brother toward the door. "You need to find Leo anyway."
Arthur seemed determined to avoid his brother's accusatory gaze and instead looked anywhere else - eventually noticing Remus.
It was a fraction of a dose, but it calmed the shaking in his limbs and that was enough. She returned the bag of candy to her plain black robes - which seemed to be passing in the dark light of the evening as a modest Muggle dress - just as they reached their destination.
"But you didn't…?" Draco's too distracted by Potter's lovely jaw to piece it together.
With a sigh, Charming started signing and Gibbs spoke, albeit softly: "Thought a was under attack, people were chasing me. They caught up when a went down wae ma hip busted." Draco stopped breathing. This had to be
"Harry?"
, he said urgently, hoping to finally speak his piece. Communicate, Hermione had told him. Monty had always been a baker at heart and they had talked about expanding into baked goods before. James was always up for a challenge but adding a bakery unit was just too much for their dynamic.
"It's a wonderful problem to have, don't mistake me," McGonagall sighed from behind the Headmistress's desk, handing over a long piece of parchment. No less than three dozen names were listed; a quarter of the names had sharp little checks next to them. "We haven't had this many Muggleborns on the register in nearly a century! But I only have so much time to make these visits, and Filius won't return for another three weeks, Hagrid is still in Romania, Neville can't be spared from Greenhouse Ten... I'm afraid I have to start cutting the holidays short for the rest of our staff if we're to get anywhere with this list before August."
"I'm not alone," Harry argued.
. Words he should have reconsidered:
Harry balked - who in their right mind named a child Scorpius?
Now he just had to get James to accept Harry.
A young man in a plain grey tunic sighs, tucking his inventory cart into a little-used dressing room alcove. He can hardly see over the sea of clothing racks, but he spots a shock of red hair and hurries over.
Potter grabs the waistband of his pants, nearly ripping them off, and together they tear out of the room into the sweet, cool corridor. From the ground, Potter throws his feet against the door. His trainers sizzle and bubble, the rubber soles burn and fill Draco's nose with a smell as nauseating as their own smoked flesh. A shadow from within the room moves—flies forward with incredible speed—and the door shuts just as the witch throws herself against it.
"James?" The name sent a new wave of static through his brain as he stared at the fidgeting boys.
would be a good rule too. Ron shared a look with Hermione, who drew her wand as well, and they cast in unison:
"What happened?"
The witch says nothing, but she’s staring at them with an eagerness that's unsettling. Potter’s ready to storm over and blast the door off its hinges and Draco reaches out to steady him, catching his forearm before he can insult their host and land them outside all night in the dead of winter.
He made an offer?!
"One hour," Alec repeated with a grin.
It isn't until three days - he can count them now - after his rescue that he learns his captor's actual name. But he finds it doesn't even matter. It doesn't matter. None of him matters to Harry anymore. He wonders how much of his curiosity over the years - trying to solve this mystery, to suss out any clues as to his identity, his history, his motivations - was survival and how much was just trying to fill the cruelly empty void.
Monty prompted him to continue.
Malfoy clicked his tongue, but didn't say anything. Harry suddenly got the feeling that he was being looked at like he was a madman who shouldn't live unsupervised.
"I try to help everyone here, which is an awfully big job, of course. Harry's the same, but he's happy to visit his family in all the other departments. If you spot a redhead, they belong to Harry."
Draco barely raised a brow, choosing to turn to Scorpius instead. Draco was a guest at Scorpius's tea time. He would defer to the little gentleman.
Wednesday, Draco and Scorpius seemed to sense some silliness in the air as well; they were both in a bright mood and the trio only checked one house before detouring through the city zoo. And later that day, of course, after Sirius and Remus asked why he smelled like fish and he told them about the penguin exhibit, those two gits spent the rest of the evening waddling around and kissing each other like penguins. Did penguins kiss? Harry had spent half the afternoon in that exhibit and still didn't know.
"Nott's finally happy with his deal. Gave us six more names this morning," Rachel said, sending another list over to smack into the wall next to the first. "They've nothing to do with Potter, but they're in the same operation. Higher ups who don't get their wands dirty. They stood to benefit the most by syphoning Potter Cottage."
And that was one of the oddest things he had experienced these past twelve years. Even odder than getting hit by that car, which Arthur had darted in front of, and walking away without a scratch… He had finally met someone who didn't just look faintly familiar, but
James felt the pressure in his heart ease momentarily, but then Monty continued.
“Did you hear what
He woke to a cold compress, a pot of ginger tea, and Sirius's furrowed brow. Harry avoided his eye and tried to quell the flood of shame that rose up as he sipped the tea. Remus brought him a potion once they deemed him able to keep it down, and he was left with only dread and humiliation in his stomach instead of cramps.
"We dunno where they got her but they'd painted her up an' she was all dizzy from the fumes - " Arthur's voice shook and his lip trembled as he clutched the cat to his chest. James felt his own eyes prickle at the pitiful sight and
And then Potter whirls around to look at the bed, and Draco nearly faints.
James ran his hand through his hair again, not knowing how to deny that. He did like to be busy...when it was his business, his recipes, his kids keeping him busy. And now, sure, his old friends and his new politics. And Monty, of course, when he wasn't being difficult.
And then there was George. He was seated next to the twins, who were crammed together onto the end where Helen used to stand. George Weasley seemed as delighted by Arthur and Alexander as the younger boys were by him; he was already deep in conversation about magical pranks and sweets. James could almost hear the sizzling power of mischief among them. The inevitable disaster tonight would involve that end of the table, he was certain.
"Well, here's your lead!"
be a - a proper twenty-nine-year-old wizard."
Harry's eyes fluttered open of their own accord to find Draco watching him, mouth parted, eyes bright, brows slightly furrowed.
And indistinct mumbling came through as static flared. Alec lifted the contraption a few inches off the desk, which seemed to calm it for some reason.
And so he found himself, with his own just-barely-post-pubescent facial hair valiantly trying to fill in those patches, sitting cross-legged on a cushion while Draco's partner in real estate led him through a
Monty shot Remus a mysterious look before using his own hands to reply to Harry. But then Harry spotted Alec watching from across the table, where McGonagall and Arthur were deep in conversation; Harry pulled Monty's hands down and ducked his head closer so Monty could whisper in his ear instead.
"Your tartan beret."
His heart dropped into his stomach.
"Yes, well." Draco sniffed imperiously. "I hate to leave you to all the heroics, is all. Goes straight to your head."
. Montgomery Gibbs grew up translating for his Deaf parents and looking after his younger sister, who now lived in Kent with her new wife. James had met him about a year after his elderly parents caught a nasty flu and died within a few weeks of each other. A life like that was a recipe for an affectionate, demonstrative man who sometimes let fear and jealousy get the better of him.
"I've always been scrawny."
Hermione examines the note on the gift carefully.
"As a matter of fact, I do. An animagus form is the ultimate transfiguration," McGonagall explained. "I wouldn't think to hire a transfiguration professor without the ability."
Arthur laughed out loud at that but Draco didn't see what was funny. They went on and on like that, back and forth, until Arthur tripped up and added two things instead of one:
He crawled stiffly to the bedroom door in lieu of standing. He would stand after he took his potion.
"Why not?" She hated this. Was she helping the situation or making everything worse? She desperately wanted them to work it out. If anyone deserved a family, it was Harry - well, James.
Astoria shared a look with Draco, who smiled into his teacup, and obliged.
A withered old crone stands in the doorway and he falters at the edge of the stoop. Her long nose is crooked, her willowy hair is snow white, and her skin has a distinct blue tinge to it. But, he reminds himself, he does not judge
"But..." Draco scrunched up his nose in a way that would've been endearing if Harry wasn't too busy bracing himself against the table to avoid being...hexed, or grabbed, or screamed at or something. "But I already knew all that."
"Did ye see the Prophet?" Monty asked, rifling through the stack of discarded magic newspapers at the end of the table. He pulled out yesterday's copy and flipped it to the editorial page, where a long letter was submitted by one Marietta Edgecomb.
The idea of it had always intrigued him: it featured in all of the best (in his opinion) bedtime stories that he read to his boys and it was a popular theme for their shop at Halloween. Witch hats and brooms and cauldrons decorated the shop nearly every October, except last year, when Arthur finally convinced him to go with a superhero theme instead. (Which proved to be much more popular than James would like to admit.)
[a large block of scratched out ink]
. Er, people. You know?"
As an Auror, Ron was a keen observer of human behavior. He could see that, throughout the night, Harry was nervous and jittery, excited and jittery, frustrated and jittery, and a bit jittery. Ron could see that he was trying very hard to make it look like he was not watching Monty like a hawk throughout the night, and coincidentally that's what Monty seemed to be watching Harry for. Watching him to make sure he wasn't watching him watching.
"You can't root around inside his head if you're looking for something more," she went on in a decisive tone, as if they'd already arrived at the next course of action. "He's not a crup and you're not his trainer."
came Mr. Lupin's eager voice.
Apparently there was no response for that, even from a trained Mind Healer. Malfoy blinked rapidly, swallowed once, twice, three times. He was exceedingly uncomfortable and James didn’t know how to fix it.
He was at a loss as to what he could say. Who was supposed to apologize here? Who was the victim? He knew the man was out of control yesterday, he knew it wasn't right for Monty to treat anyone like that, much less his boyfriend. But he also knew there was an undercurrent of truth to what had been said. A strong undercurrent. The guilt was churning his stomach and yet he still didn't feel right about apologizing. Or about forgiving.
While the entire bookcase was overflowing, the collection was meticulously organized and entirely free of dust, just like the rest of the flat. Words flickered through his head -
"Ye know a wanna bake," he snorted as he wafted a baking sheet over the cooling cake. He wanted to get the frosting on before bedtime. If he timed it right, he would have enough time to tend to James's nerves in bed, make sure he got a good night's rest. "It's a natural extension to a candy shop. We'll take over this side of the city in confectionary goods!"
was, he wasn't there anymore. He was here, stealing wands and hexing people into the wall and leaving it up to Alexander to bring him back. He was here, with Ron and Remus and the Aurors. He was here, with his boys and Teddy staring at him through their compartment window.
"Tea?" Mum offered in her warmest hostess voice.
"Patient contract," he whispered, flinching when sparks flew from the wand.
He turned away from the bookcase to find a stack of Muggle stationary on the writing table. Envelopes torn open, each letter read and replaced, then stacked up where the table met the wall. Spotting the name in the return address, Draco couldn't resist opening a few at random.
Harry Potter's friends spoke to Monty through the phone while James shivered on the sofa in his wet joggers and t-shirt, feeling too much like a little boy who had wet the bed. Within minutes, Hermione was knocking quietly on their front door and Monty was leading her up the stairs. James heard them laughing softly on the stairs. He knew he should feel annoyed. This wasn't funny.
This charming antique cottage has been magically expanded to accommodate pets and creatures of a larger variety. Reinforced doors and shutters for added security. The spacious kitchen is supplied with an ice box full of takeout containers and a rarely used breakfast nook. The office serves as a small library in addition to the built-in shelves in the sitting room. A shed, added in 2002, for the aspiring Muggle mechanic. Conveniently located on the outskirts of Hogsmeade. The Forbidden Forest borders the massive back garden with picturesque mountains in the distance.
Potter's hands come up, fumbling with his undershirt, running over his slick back. Draco's tongue follows a crease across his chest, just under his pecs, then down. He shifts back to taste more. Potter's hands drift into his hair again, no doubt smearing the mess of blood and sweat into a bird's nest to rival his own, the spiteful git. Draco closes the distance—his tongue drags across that sweaty, salty brown skin—his chin scratches against a promising trail of hair, the lean line of muscles under his tongue jumping, twitching, fluttering as he moves down, down, down…
Those letters were taunting him.
"Draco, I'm serious!"
"Blaise…!" He dropped his face into his hands before pushing them back through his fuzzy hair.
Or something.
"I'm feeling much too philosophical for my liking, Potter," he grumbles. "Like a bloody frostbitten Ravenclaw." Potter snorts and sits up, leaning one of his broad, bony shoulders against Draco. Draco feels sinfully warm.
Hagrid
"Because you're not denying it."
complain."
"They're known for reacting reasonably to situations such as a man opening a compartment door on a school train - "
“I figured, if you let them in,” Draco heard the other Auror mumble to herself as they made their way up.
"Oi Honda Civic, get yer caboose back here! It's ma turn tae wash up…." Monty rushed over to snatch the plates from James, steering him back to the table while he started the sink. "How're the appointments goin' then?" he asked lightly. They hadn't discussed the topic since the huge fight last month.
"You're full of it, Haz!"
His hands were shaking.
"'McGonagall' did ye say your name was?" Monty asked as they finished their last bites.
He threw the covers off and made his way to the loo to shower, leaving his godfather to clean up the tea in merciless silence.
he said carelessly, maintaining his grip even as he signed.
“No, son, it’s not - “
Dad shot him an annoyed look that was softened by the ghost of a smile. Their dad wasn't a foul-tempered man by a long shot. He had a temper sometimes, sure, but Monty was far more likely to go off. And yeah, Dad would get frustrated when Arthur tried sneaking yet another new drawing to the wall downstairs without framing it first, and then rearranging everything to make enough room for it (two inches of space around each frame, that was the key), and then dusting it all again for good measure (apparently for the health inspector's benefit but they would be hard-pressed to find any dust in their living space either). But Dad's slight neuroticism was just a quirk, really. Easily overlooked when you considered the crippled mute amnesiac as a whole.
"Da' - "
Except James had never been able to settle on an exact cut-off age for what was considered a “newborn” and had refused to take the boys on a bus for several years after that.
"Do you have one on you?" To his surprise, she offered him a dainty mesh bag of all-too-familiar lemon drops. He chuckled to himself as he popped one in his mouth. Trust Dumbledore to lace his candy with potions…
Draco sneered. "He's not my patient, if you recall. I haven't seen him officially since - "
"Yeah," he snorted. "We thought he was more like Hawkeye but Da's apparently the wizard-Hulk!"
"Doesn't always work..."
"Not his Mind Healer, pal," she reminded him, tucking the blossom of a wildflower in his hair before tossing the stem in his face. He grinned sheepishly and patted the flower to secure it.
He relinquishes his hold, stepping back.
Also, yes, I KNOW ((now)) that Mr./Ms. [First Name] is strictly a southern-US thing, so just consider it a regional spice from your dumb author. I've adjusted the twins' speech later, but Scorpius's scene is just funnier to me now so I'm leaving it as-is.
James released the squirming boys and smacked a hand to his chest, heart hammering. Merlin's toe, that robotic bitch was terrifying up close. With a shaking hand, he pointed under the far bed that held up one side of their blanket fort.
"Have a biscuit, Remus."
“Did you hear what I said, Potter?” Draco finally asks, leaning down slightly to try to catch his gaze.
he admitted after a moment of hesitation.
It was just as well that Dad always conveniently
"Jewelry sales have skyrocketed, alongside Beauty," Arthur's saying now, "and everyone is always well stocked.
Except for that reprehensible part when he handed over the letter.
"Yeah, well," huffed Ron, then stretched in a grand, self-mocking way. "I reckon you've done enough hero work for one lifetime. Only took us a decade or so to return the favor."
Dad signed, balancing his cane against his leg to free up his other hand.
"Paperwork."
"Go on then," he prompted, feeling a flare of impatience with Blaise's dramatics.
"He doesn't actually...know...that I'm
Harry narrows his eyes at Draco before seeming to arrive at a decision. Nodding to himself, he remains silent as he finishes his sandwich. Draco watches, waiting, as Harry starts to work on a tupperware container of cold beans, tossing liberal amounts of salt and pepper over it.
There’s the tell-tale click of the intercom hanging up, and the music resumes.
James met them in the sitting room while Auror Rachel No-Surname and Auror Red Weasel retreated downstairs. Blaise lasted all of three minutes while James prepared the tea - adding two heaping sugars to Draco’s - before the uncomfortable silence became too much for the always-speaking Unspeakable.
"Daddy, remember? I'm your daddy," the man always insists. And Harry insists on mishearing him every time.
The first night of Harry's disappearance was oddly calm. Ron figured his friend was staying at Grimmauld Place for the night and would return to the Burrow in the morning for breakfast, or maybe lunch. He sent an owl to check on him, but after what must have been an emotional visit, Harry apparently wasn't in the mood for a chat and the post was returned undelivered. That was alright. Sometimes Harry needed a good brood. Ron resolved to go to Grimmauld Place to snap him out of it if he hadn't visited by lunch the next day.
' was what he meant, surely. Signing was often short and blunt. James just phrased it poorly. Another reason why this translation spell would be a disaster for James, his lovebird just didn't understand -
“Mm.” He’s in pain. That’s a pained sound, Draco’s sure of it. Of course he’s in pain, he’s been half-broiled on a giant shitting oven-rack!
On his other side, Malfoy jabbed an elbow into his side and sent an inquiring look. James mouthed,
Unable to summon an answer, he nodded once. That didn't seem to be enough, so he added, "I will apologize." All of this fuss for one flippant comment about saving his damsel from the mad Muggle...
"To move out of ours."
, he tried to explain to Monty. It felt flat and weak.
made a judgement based on skin—except Marietta Edgecomb, that bint hasn't washed her face since they Vanished the afterbirth."
Susan Bones had arrived that Monday morning to deliver her nephew Robert, and she and James spent the morning catching up while Monty entertained the boys. She worked for the Ministry now, following her aunt's footsteps, and seemed extremely sympathetic to the werewolf issues that James was pursuing. She was brilliant, really, she knew the ins and outs, who to charm and who to call out. James was able to mark down plenty of notes to go over with Hermione later.
“Do you think you can manage for another hour, Scorpius?” Malfoy asked quietly as he hefted him onto a tall stool at the breakfast bar. Harry shuffled his feet, thoroughly regretting not taking his leave earlier. He couldn’t leave now, could he? Then it would be obvious that he should’ve left already.
in an oven!"
to use that language."
Except he hadn't been alone. Two years, Harry and Monty had been together. And the boys would be off at Hogwarts as first years now, so they had to have been born just a year after Harry's disappearance. Ever the survivor, Harry had found himself a family and built himself a life in these past twelve years. Remus remembered another period of twelve years that he himself had spent lost and alone...in that time, he hadn't done anything that could compare to what Harry had accomplished without even knowing his own name.
, freezing cold, his clothes are already damp from it -
"Not now!" he snapped, adding a drop of goblin water to the vial. The solution turned pink briefly before returning to its original blue. Clean. Next vial.
once or twice.
Heavily favoring his hip and feeling his own face grow more pale with every step, James limped from the room and hauled himself upstairs.
Mr. James looked like he was about to say something and Scorpius started in on him before he could.
- " A particularly meaty slug slipped up his throat and out his mouth, the trail of slime clinging to his uvula and making him gag. "Stop!"
“I’m not lonely,” he insisted. “I’ve got you both, and Hermione and the Weasleys, and - “
"So a started bakin' for three an' threatened tae turn his rail in tae child services if 'e kept pushin' off his share on them.
"Potter!"
James forced a smile as he greeted the others. Remus's face broke into a wide, happy grin that James couldn't help returning. The man looked decades younger like that. George clapped him on the shoulder and slipped him a small bag of suspect candy. Hermione had brought their five-year-old daughter, Rose, who immediately started lecturing Scorpius on the best colors of sprinkles. James dropped heavily into a seat between Malfoy and Monty, taking in the incredible view.
“Godspeed, man.”
he said, apparently in full agreement.
James's heart was full and his stomach warm when they locked up that night and trudged up the stairs. He hardly noticed the pain in his hip and he wasn't nearly buzzed enough to credit the alcohol. No, he chalked it up to a near perfect night. For once. After months of stress, weeks of fighting, days of pushing each other to the edge, he felt content and at ease and his hip was granting him a pass for it.
her, but he did… You know… Er, and then she died."
“Ron Weasley, twenty-five, been here seven years. My family’s all over Voldecorp. Well, Fred and George are still trying the entrepreneurial thing. But Mum’s in the deli, Charlie’s in Pet Supply, Ginny’s in Women’s, Dad and Percy are Corporate tossers, and my oldest brother Bill drives the armored van that takes the money away every week. We
Long believed to be dead after an apparent attack by dark wizards in Godric's Hollow, Mr. Potter appeared to be in good health, though he walked with a cane and became noticeably uncomfortable with the excitement of the crowd.
"For once in your miser'ble -
"Are you ready, Haz?" he whispered, suddenly very close, his hot breath tickling Harry's ear. Harry lost his words and nodded. With a whispered finite, the spell lifted. Harry blinked and squinted against the brightness of the clear sky shining against the snowy field. A tall, familiar structure stood before them, and he gasped.
[enclosed: small box of crunchy hazelnut praline snaps, small box of salted caramel fudge]
They’re led deeper into the cottage.
"Well..." she started, taking great care in placing the mug to her side and nudging it here and there. "To be honest, no, it never occurred to me until..."
"Yeah, I, er… Well, a friend of mine, Luna Lovegood, or I guess she's a friend of a friend, actually the girlfriend of a friend - anyway, she's in the circus and I went to a show once - all the aerialists use standard racing brooms. So I did some research, made some prototypes, and now I'm, er…" He glanced up - Terry still seemed interested - and cleared his throat. "I'm working on my first paid commission now for a stunt broom, and a few more have put in their orders as well."
"That you had a confession to make, that your real name isn't Haz Blue - mind-blowing, that revelation - it's Harry Potter, but that you - " Draco cleared his throat again, going pinker, " - you like it better that I call you Haz. I thought it might be a...deadname situation, or something, to be honest."
"Sorry!" he said, fixing his hat firmly in place by habit, then peered up through his glasses at the man. "Oh, bugger--erm, butter," he corrected quickly. Draco Malfoy looked as Malfoy-ish as ever and Harry could think of no one else who would subject an innocent child to such a name as Scorpius.
He was proud of Monty. Sure, he was a bit stiff tonight, not his usual friendly self, and he had a brief row with Ron's portable Wireless. And yeah, there were a few embarrassing moments - one incident with the chair that left James mortified - but overall, he didn't stick to his side like glue, didn't pick a fight with Malfoy, didn't even sulk upstairs like James suspected he might. He was coming around. The rush of hope he felt at that realization told James that perhaps he had been far more concerned about their relationship than he had even admitted to himself. He was well and truly hopeful that this was the first solid step toward working past Monty's control issues.
"No - "
Monty stayed up all night watching telly anyway, who was he to tell Dad when -
Scorpius tucked into his lunch and Harry mouthed
"Please stop talking about your hand."
And Kim, during their session Thursday, wasn't much better with her goofy leering and winking, which made Harry want to die, which made Kim want to talk seriously about...well, things he couldn't catch himself thinking about.
"We can't just - "
James had never felt so invisible in a crowd, but he couldn't stop his own staring. His boys, stubborn proponents of dressing themselves ever since they were old enough to open the wardrobe, had never managed to look as mismatched as they did today. Arthur was almost himself, but his skin was significantly lightened and he looked ethnically ambiguous. His hair was charmed into a copper color that nearly blended in with his new skin. Under these changes, however, the same bone structure and green eyes remained.
“Not now, Sirius - “
James shook his head.
His inspiration didn't stop there. After returning the ladder and cleaning up the supplies, he stopped for a cup of tea in the kitchen, where he found Anne. While stroking her feathers, he found himself picking through the notebook that held a load of recipes and ideas he was still working through. Hermione had told him to make gestures of goodwill to both Monty and Malfoy. The gesture for Monty was massive and life-changing and they would have a lot to talk through tomorrow to get the kitchen ready to handle a new supply of baked goods. Perhaps the gesture for Malfoy could be a bit more contained…
"Do you know," Remus grinned broadly, "it'll be my first proper visit? Found them in a Muggle mail-order catalog at the Hogsmeade post office."
"When you woke up?"
The Healer started to leave, muttering, “I’ll give you three some privacy…”
“The Healers will get you back on track,” offered Remus, and Harry nodded. They’d explained his recovery plan and he’d listened to every word, despite their belief that he was still in shock. It was simply that he’d had enough of the same two voices and wanted to hear someone else speak for once.
know I don't subscribe to that nonsense anymore, right? I haven't for a long time... My mum helped set me right, and Astoria was a dream, she opened a whole new world for me, and I have a son now, so I - I intend to do better by him. Half my clients are Muggles, for fuck's sake!"
"Potter!"
"If you showed up bald to the Quidditch match, I certainly would have asked what had befallen you to cause such a travesty. Or miracle, in your case."
"Wha', really?!" Alec said, sitting up straight. Arthur was bouncing up and down in glee.
James soared into a sitting position, the air feeling impossibly cold and wet compared to the hot dry heat of his dream - nightmare - memory?
"People can
he finally said. Arthur snorted, muttered something under his breath, and flipped to a new page of his sketchbook. As he was turning the page, James remembered:
They arrived at the house and Harry marched - as well as he could with Scorpius clinging to his back - right up to the door, rapping sharply with his knuckles. They waited.
“Bit weird to misspell the name of your own pub,” Harry observed drily at Draco’s guffaw. “Maybe it was a new employee?” Draco glanced at him with wide eyes and tilted his head in a skeptical,
“Brilliant weather lately,” Arthur claims.
Sharp angles surged up into a peak, and a strong, thick beam of pine cut across the widest part. A humble chandelier hung overhead, three teardrop swoops of iron cradling several candles. But it was all nearly lost in the clear expanse of sky. Huge windows in the angled ceiling lit up the room spectacularly, like perfect rectangles of that singular blue that he adored so much.
“Sorry,” Pansy says, poking lazily through a rack of bras just feet away from Hermione’s precarious situation. “I’ve got some zoning to do. Can’t showcase a sloppy department with the Board puttering about.”
"Someone was called 'dung'..." Charming's signs were slowing down now and his brow furrowed as he tried to recall every detail. "Whoever it was, they argued tae obliviate, no' kill. Someone else wanted tae kill me an' be done it. There were a lot of them, dunno how many." Gibbs was looking pale and sickly now as Charming wrapped up. "He says, a was hearin' a lot voices at once, no sure if it were the a-u-r...the Aurors or the others."
"We're putting them on the train now," Ron muttered, gazing somewhere off to the side and nodding at someone James couldn't see.
“And you shouldn’t speak with your mouth full, but I suppose if they can’t afford enough etiquette lessons for their own baker’s dozen, they won’t spare any on the strays.”
, he said.
"Convenient for the house-arrested," he laughed delightedly. "Mail-order chocolate. Brilliant."
James nodded firmly, sending Monty a glare that told him to stay out of it. But he was never too good at that, not when he knew better.
"He's gotta be persistent - "
The son of the man currently leering at James as if he were a Ministry pardon.
Minutes pass and the unicorns disappear. The last rays of sunlight are fading fast and Potter still hasn't moved his pert arse. Draco clasps his hand—it's ice—and takes him away. They have to carry on.
"Are you injured?" Malfoy knelt down, examining the boy's face and limbs, and Harry wondered if he should just...back away, leave, escape before he had to make
"I think you made the right call."
their crushing disappointment. It was cruel to push this farce on them! Far kinder to leave Harry Potter among the dead.
“Quill acquaintance,” Remus translated automatically. Harry blinked. He would be sticking with penpals, if he ever went about forging that ridiculous plan. Hedwig was one old friend he hadn't been reunited with, having disappeared shortly after he did...he wondered what had happened to her.
Harry froze.
"Please, Harry, you don't know what it was like when you didn't come home - "
"You've done enough with your words, son," his mother scoffed, glancing briefly at Dad.
“Albus!”
"He has flashbacks," explained Alec, looking up at Ron with urgency. "That's what it was, right, Dad?" James nodded numbly, watching the Auror climb back to his feet. Alec stooped down and snatched up the stolen wands. "Here," he said, holding the two wands out to the trio of wary Aurors. "Just, maybe don't point it at him."
Dad laughed, throwing his last card down. A Curse!
"There was a war, years ago, in the magical world. It started picking up in Harry's fifth year," he tapped the photo, "and by what should have been his seventh year, Harry and his friends dropped out of school to help in the fight." How to explain that Harry Potter was at the center of this war? He couldn't do it… His voice was on automatic and he barely thought about what he was saying. "May 2nd, 1998, the war was won, largely by Harry's efforts. And his friends. But Harry dealt the final blow."
"And you, Mister! You're tattling too! A lot! And you're still all slouchy and you still haven't said thank you!"
"I just don't know what I'd do with all this space..." for the massive place that Scorpius seemed rather taken with.
This chapter was originally supposed to include Christmas, but it was turning into a monster.  So much introspection.  I threw in a lot of letters and texts to make it a little easier to swallow.  Excessive introspection, character growth, relationship dynamics...it's all part of the recipe!  But it was getting unwieldy so I cut it off before Christmas got involved.  And finally, I added the nightmare scene to help ground myself in this chapter...it might look like James trying to ground himself in his current life, but really it's your humble author, trying to breathe and gather the courage to post this beast of a chapter.
James assumed it was okay to pry now, since Malfoy seemed hurt that he had never asked before. Despite all the signs! Bloody hell. Of course he was sick. He was pale and peaky, there were circles under his eyes for weeks after that Quidditch match because he was obviously losing sleep over worry and fear and -
Rachel arrived in the doorway at the same time that Anne appeared at the window with a bundle of letters. Rachel - chest heaving, hair wild, and a nasty stain spreading across her perfect robes - flicked her wand to let the owl inside.
But instead of seeing the whole picture, the esteemed, affable, and distracted Healer Malfoy picked it apart and went for the cheap shots:
Anthony planted himself barely a foot behind him, gripping the back of his neck to hold him in place for his execution, and James knew his wand was tucked away in his front pocket, just out of sight.
"That was the grocery."
"You an' Dad watched Doctor Who?" he said incredulously. "Without me?"
"But that's not how it works," he said, leaning forward over his own mug of tea. "I mean, my parents are brilliant together but they don't
“Mr. Flamel.”
"How did you even come to be in contact with Harry Potter?"
"Er, so that's a yes, right?" Harry asked, then promptly gagged. He retched slightly and spat out a lump of muck. A brown trail of spittle hung from his chin. Disgusting. His fiancé was disgusting.
James said incredulously. They weren't even married and Monty felt entitled to his life savings for a second fucking shop that he didn't want!
"In the wardrobe - "
"Take a seat, Dragon," Nott ordered in a low voice.
Harry snorted and muttered, "Talking..."
"Potty, stop. I mean it. You're drunk. Stop...stop moving around over there. All swirly and...and yappy. Flappy. Like a drunk squid, is what you are."
Draco loses his train of thought—shame, that—and stares blankly at the nutter with whom he's apparently negotiating a bed tonight.
[enclosed: large box of soft burnt caramel truffles]
you about these things. To see how you're doing! To check in!" James frowned.
"Cannae jus' leave 'im like that..." he muttered to himself.
Arthur went on, his voice cracking. He picked up the cat and cradled her to his chest, running his fingers over her back. "She died giving birth! How's that his fault?!"
"Look at her go!" Arthur whooped loudly, high-fiving Alec.
Arthur set his charcoal aside and blinked at him.
"When did you realize you had been Obliviated?" Robards launched right back into the questioning, the Quick Quotes Quill on his desk scribbling away.
Arthur and Alec stared at them with wide eyes as they waited for someone else to speak.
. Harry wasn't adverse to emotions, exactly, he was just tired of drowning in them at the drop of a hat....
"James?" Monty called out, leading Remus to a seat next to the Thing. He nervously pulled out the chair but couldn't bring himself to sit, lest he find himself eye-level with that expressionless painted face. "There ye are..."
She grimaced. "He rings sometimes, late at night," she said gently. James turned his head away, scowling, and Ron frowned at her for spilling the beans. "He asks for advice - I've only told him to stop being a caveman and start communicating with you properly. The same as I've told you, so stop giving me that look, James Potter!" Ron snorted and James blinked at her, his expression morphing into something closer to bemusement. "Charming, I mean. You know who you are."
They spent the brisk walk not talking except to brush up on Harry's warming charms. Apparently it was more in the grip than the movement - it also helped when he forced himself to focus, shoving away all thoughts of abandoning his poor godfather for half-baked plots of independence.
The report in Potter's classified file was seared into his mind, screaming at him to give it all up, tell this person everything he wanted to know so he could get home to Scorpius. "Please...I really can't. I want to help - "
"Think on it, love," he said mildly as he gave the frosting another stir. "A just wanna give you something to do besides pine over Malfoy."
stereotypes exist for a reason,
James let the smile fly free this time and Draco felt something in his chest ease.
James started to object and Monty barreled ahead.
He searched, but there was no date. It came from the top of the stack so it may have been quite recent. His stomach churned.
"Alexander and Arthur Charming?" he croaked, blinking rapidly against the bizarre image of
"He's gotta get on your level, whatever it takes - "
The lock clicks and the door opens inward, pushing Harry back. And it isn't Fin.
"If there's nothing else you'd like to work on, I feel it is best we call these sessions to a close."
marshmallows, but it's not a brand itself."
Potter takes a breath. Until now, sweat has been pouring out of his hair, down his neck, off his nose, over his trembling hands…but no longer. He's soaked to the bone, grey and panting, but he appears all sweated out as he squats and considers the next step. They can't afford to stay here much longer, waiting the old woman out while they get nice and crispy. And she might never leave the window! They have to act. Potter squares his shoulders, looking as if it takes all his strength to do so.
"Mr. Charming, is it?" McGonagall finally spoke. Harry nodded.
. I daresay the lavatory isn't decked out in edibles." He shivers despite the heat, then wonders whether he should pound on the door to request a trip to the loo. Then he could get Potter out of here. He isn't looking so fresh.
(CW: Brief scene involving cigarette-smoking.)
, because he's
James stopped that train of thought right there, blushing furiously. He was a pervert, that's what he was, a sick perverted bastard with some sort of candy kink. He'd have to change the sign on the front door from
McGonagall took over from there. She delivered the letters to the boys - when had she lifted those from Remus's pocket? - who read them with all the usual shock and awe and disbelief that always came from Muggleborns. She demonstrated a few simple spells: Arthur and Alec gave identical squeals of surprise when their chairs began floating, and then Arthur became disturbingly well-adjusted to the idea and attempted to stand up while the chair lifted him toward the ceiling.
James slowly rejoined the waking world. He couldn't say when he first opened his eyes - was it before or after he noted how quiet the street outside was? before or after he felt someone's elbow digging into his bladder? - but when he finally blinked himself back into reality, he was faced with the devil himself.
Remus felt his face flush under Harry's cold gaze.
Tune in next week for Episode 4!
"Well," she heard herself speak. "What shall we bring?" Ron didn't answer, he just kept staring at the scuffed hardwood floor under his feet. He had another hour to go before he had to report to the Auror office, but Hermione would have to leave in the next five minutes if she wanted to be on time. Granted, Unspeakables were never the most punctual lot, but she had her own standards to maintain. "Ron?"
Monty threw back.
"Oh - do you need me to go, then?" Draco shifted back, preparing to depart. "Shall I get Sirius?"
"We've accomplished your goals," Draco explained as he referred to Charming's file. "You yourself claim that you're managing your empty nest much better now. You're using magic again and coping well enough with your nightmares without my input. We've covered self-care and you've improved on that front to the level of a basic functioning adult. Kudos." Charming scrunched his face up in that Potter-way, the one that told Draco he had said something annoying.
, he said.
He asks. He immediately regrets asking, because Harry doesn't lower the book, which means he wasn't even reading in the first place. Just using it as a prop between them.
Draco leaned back in his chair, observing the stunned-looking man before him. Had he really thought it would be so difficult to step back into magic? Identity and memories were one thing, but waving a stick around and using second-year defense spells could hardly be considered an obstacle.
Arthur screamed. Alec clutched his arms from behind to keep him from signing, his fingernails digging into his forearms in a way that only served to remind James how small his boy's hands were. Alec and Arty's nails were so sharp when they were babies and they hadn't dulled all that much over the years. When did fingernails begin to dull? Would they live long enough to find out?
"Always under the name 'J. Charming'?"

Without waiting for an answer, she clapped twice - softly, elegantly - and a full arrangement popped into place on the low table between them.

"Get off the train, you nutter!" Ron laughed from the corridor. Remus and Teddy arrived at his side, peering into the compartment curiously.

"Go on," Draco urged.

Alec jerked violently and the contraption slipped through his fingers and hit the desk. Static took over and started rising in volume while Arthur leapt to his feet.
Potter’s back is burned to hell, large matching rings of angry, peeling, bubbling skin spaced evenly across it. The smell of burning skin and hair hits Draco like a train and he feels woozy again. Vince’s screams are ringing in his ears. The room tilts. Potter grabs his elbow, his hand sliding in the slick of Draco’s sweat in a decidedly less sexy way than just moments before, and drags him close. Potter frantically gathers their cloaks and the single thin sheet from the bed, throwing it into a haphazard pile on the floor. They stumble together onto the pile, huddling close, Potter’s arms holding Draco’s back tight against his chest. It’s a welcome reprieve from the heat of the brick floor, but now Draco’s all too aware of the rising temperature.
"I don't want to hurt you, Draco," Blaise said, his voice dropping into a lower register.
"PUNISHED!" Lucius screeched from the stairs. Draco focused all his attention on calming the poor creature in his arms while his father's voice drifted away. He wondered what Scorpius would have to say about his grandfather's awful manners today.
he asked as soon as the door was closed.
Harry offered another small smile and gestured again for them to sit as he took the seat across from Remus. McGonagall sat primly and Remus fell into his seat, scraping the chair on the tile. When Harry leaned his cane (which was painted in a hundred dazzling colors with tiny, seemingly random brushstrokes) against the Thing, an alarming whirring-noise started up from within the Thing's depths. Harry shot it a quelling look and Remus was even more alarmed when the whirring settled back into nothing.
, Monty frowned.
, the weapon!"
. Harry Potter is not
"Oh yes, right. My right leg is broken, Daddy." Malfoy nodded seriously and tapped his little khaki trousers at various points, earning a dramatic hiss from Scorpius.
He packed up the game dejectedly. It wasn't even eleven, they could stay up until midnight on weekends. What a waste of a Saturday. Dad hobbled away behind him and fiddled with the boombox mounted on the far counter.
"It'll be on your terms," she added. That much they could agree on. James needed to regain some control.
"Draco, I swear to—"
"Let me call Monty and see what's going on," she said soothingly, already planning five steps ahead. "I'll send a letter to your Dad right now, see if I can't invite myself over after dinner tonight. Don't worry, Arthur," she added. "We'll get it sorted." Curse James and his temper anyway, the man was a father!
"Alive, and yours?"
he asked, lip curling.
James bowed his head and glared at the kitchen table.
Harry nodded dumbly. "Much better than my hand."
"Muggles don't have access to feathers? Or straw?"
"Meant more like a proper investment," he needled. "Marge next door is lookin' tae sell the boutique..."
"Shut up."
Harry wasn't drinking at first, and while Ron couldn't fault him for being a miserable host on such short notice, he was glad to have dragged Tony along as a backup guard, awkward though he was in casual settings. With a proper Auror on duty, not drinking, Ron was free to bring out every Weapon of Mass Intoxication he had in his arsenal. Drinking games, frivolous challenges, whatever got Harry's competitive spirit roused enough to get those first few shots into him. And then the next few happened, and one or two after that, and eventually even the translation spell couldn't make sense of his wobbly signs.
"And ultimately he's held accountable by the - "
Draco watched with a carefully blank face as Charming absorbed his words. The man was wearing that hideous yellow jumper again, the one with stains and discolored blotches all over. His baggy, tattered, paint-stained trousers were the worst Draco had seen since Potter himself was traipsing about unchecked. His hair was ruffled from the wind - surely he hadn't left the house like that - and his eyes were comically huge as he took in Draco's meaning.
was listed in the file, they'd long since assumed it was an attempt to keep him quiet. Harry shook his head. "So why - I mean, does it still bother you? Does it still hurt?" He brought his hand to his own throat, pressing against it in the way he'd seen Harry do sometimes. Harry ducked his head, scrunching his face.
"He said he believes us, he just doesn't want anything to do with us."
"No, that's me," Alec practically whispered, eyes darting to McGonagall uncomfortably. James frowned. Then why did Arty -
Draco quirked his head when he spotted the offense. Slowly, his neck seeming to creak as it turned, he peered back over his shoulder at James, who remained frozen on the spot, staring dumbly out into the alley, into the chasm of death itself.
), he moved on.
, he signed shortly to a shocked Alec.
He retreated to his bedroom - leaving the door open, as always, as if it didn't even exist - and read. As he read, his lips spread into a slow, wide smile that grew wider and wider until his cheeks hurt with the force of it.

There, that should do it. They'd dust, sweep, and mop the shop while he joined Monty in the kitchen. He grabbed his cane from the corner, resolving to use it after all. He wanted to keep his energy up tonight and it wouldn't do to pass out on the sofa at 8:30. He heard Al and Ar's footsteps trudging down the stairs just as he was pushing through the door into the kitchen.
“Mm. I’m rather fond of that shade of yellow, actually.” Draco balked. “Oh don’t worry, I won’t be subjecting your poor eyes to my
"Then it should stay between them."
"Erm...nevermind." The signal changed and Harry gestured rudely at a driver who stopped right in the path, opting to walk behind his car rather than step into the intersection. "How old are you, Scorpius?"
"He's yer therapist no' yer friend."
"You're just using big words to sound right, you pretentious—"
"Monty needs to be needed," Hermione insisted.
"When a racist cops a valid argument, it doesn't nullify the validity of the original fact!"
he signed apologetically. One of them was meant to translate, but Alec couldn't bring himself to do it. He stopped Arthur with a look and turned pleadingly to Dad.
“Quidditch can heal just about anything." James would give him that one. He felt on top of the world when he flew. He wondered how a professional Quidditch game would compare to football on the telly…
He pushes his shins down into the bed to gain leverage, pushing against Potter's firm chest until he gives. Potter lies back and Draco tips forward, and then they're in an all new position. A brilliant position—all Draco's doing, really—that allows him to pick up the pace.
"I lost it. I'm sorry." His voice was breathy, like he couldn't quite harness his voice. His chest lay against the table top and he looked...gutted. James tried to pull his hands free, to tell Draco
"Gibbs said they had a huge row about it last year when he went looking on the computer for missing persons reports," Ron went on in that same flat voice. "James told him not to bother. Gibbs assumed he was just sore about being challenged with technology and who
With his boys home and James's smile reaching his eyes again - not just when he was chatting with Malfoy - Monty grudgingly admitted to himself that it was a wholesome night...even if it
Not the best defense, but he was quite done with this bullshit.
"So if you die, the method dies with you," Nott said, satisfied.
"Realtors," he answered. The word felt foreign on his lips and it occurred to him that he'd probably never said it out loud before. Remus paused minutely in his stirring before continuing with an air of nonchalance.
"Was? Oh... Is she gone?" Scorpius said, coming closer. Harry took a deep breath and tried to answer, but his voice caught in his throat. Stupid sawdust. He nodded and took little Scorpius by his mittens, squeezing encouragingly.
James let Anne out the window and turned around, expecting to feel a familiar rage, expecting to fight it out and rip Monty a new one, maybe throw some things. But upon seeing Monty's heartbroken face, James suddenly felt all the anger drain out of him. He
James closed his mouth - Monty briefly wondered if it had gone that far, if he'd actually sucked the git's cock - and looked away, his face completely devoid of expression. When he finally answered, he said:
The Days of Lenny are filled with cold skin and aching bones, and the only privacy to be found is when he crams himself under the bed, feigning sleep.
"I spoke with Monty today," she confessed. His head jerked up, eyes wide. "Just to get his side of the story. He… Well, I don't think I've ever actually heard him swear before, no matter how worked up he can get when we phone. He sounded - "
"Your parents fond of scorpions then?" he huffed, waiting for the crosswalk signal to change.
"That doesn't permit you to yap at our heels endlessly with your inane questions! I won't hear another word of this frivolous gossip! Don't you have footage to fire?"
, he signed, but the boys only rolled their eyes in unison and didn't translate, the little shits.
and Harry was itching to get started. His eyes darted to the fireplace again.
Draco snorted in a very non-Draco way, taking another sip of the fine Elvish vintage. His hair was loose, the gel or serum or potion or whatever he usually used to coif it carefully was wearing off now as night approached morning. James thought it looked nice. He thought it might be soft if he touched it. He set his own glass aside, feeling plenty buzzed and not looking forward to the side-along Apparition home. Auror Rachel Mendel was glaring sleepy daggers at them from the far corner of the Manor's kitchen but James couldn't be arsed. He hadn't asked for a body-guard.
James hesitated, unsure how to continue.
Even if Potter's busy being a hero, Draco has the sense to force him to put his damn shoes on. He'll have to wax poetic about the state of those trainers later, because as soon as they're on, they're stuffing their hot wands in their pants—he wishes that were a euphemism—and shuffling toward the door. They keep the clothes on the floor as an added buffer—Potter mumbles something about melted rubber soles and Draco adds it as a point against his egregious choice in footwear—and pass over a sea of hot red bricks. Draco tries not to think about the fact that what he's smelling is
"He'll be home in an hour with take-away," Arthur said, his Scottish accent much lighter than Monty's but still very much present. Frankly, it was surreal to hear that accent from a Potter clone.
“Tell me about your habits,” he prompted. His fingers twitched to take notes but he resisted, thinking it wouldn’t be well received. “Sleeping, eating, working, going out, and the like. What has life been like since your reintroduction to magic last month?”
don’t even wanna know, so they keep tearing after each other like they’re arch enemies or something. Hermione says the best thing to do is just lock ‘em in a dressing room overnight, let nature run its course. But I think they may actually kill each other if they have half a chance, sexual tension or not.”
Lupin had said that Lord Voldemort once tried to kill Harry Potter as an infant, even before that war picked up. Did these people think it was acceptable to leave dark lords running around, slaughtering infants? Why was it left up to teenagers to put an end to the madness?
His wand was in his hand, spewing water madly, like a broken fire hydrant.
I couldn't find a graceful way to insert the traditional detailed-description-of-Draco's-hair, so I took care of that problem.  Also October 21st 2010 is when I started dating my then-boyfriend (who later became my husband on that same date in 2017).  So including that date is just a little shout out to us.
Alec thought incredulously.
Monty stood at the hob, cooking up a feast. That wasn't too unusual. They switched off on dinner duty and Monty tended to go overboard when it was his turn, leaving them leftovers for days. Which of course made it easier to claim he'd taken care of dinner on his other nights.
“My point is, if you’re looking for
With a hideous thunk, the penis was finally deposited onto the table and in one motion, Draco - the smooth, sticky bastard - grabbed James's hands and pulled him in for their first kiss.
"Yes, I believe we can work on that," Draco said, putting on his best soothing voice. Apparently he overdid it because Pott -
"Why do you think?" he asked, swallowing thickly against the slime coating his throat.
James protested.
Draco blinked rapidly, his mouth gaping for a moment as the potion tried to force him on a single answer. "Healer Hannah Abbott assisted once with the transcendence charm but she doesn't know the potions required. One of them is my own invention, no one else has the recipe."
Alec sighed and pulled something out of his pocket. Dad's latest mobile phone. He was supposed to have it with him whenever he left the house - like earlier, when he went out to run an errand and pick up the take-away - but really he just used it to text the others and send dumb pictures to Monty. And of course, the boys had to have their mobiles on them at all times.
10:55am
catch me, but I was too clever for them, I got away.” Draco sucks in a deep breath to calm himself. He smiles, looking quite giddy, even proud. Harry bites his lip, apparently trying to hold back a laugh.
“He’s happy here, Remus, you don’t need to keep an eye on him at Hogwarts, too.”
"H-hot," Draco chokes out, swallowing back tears. Nothing like being grilled alive to knock around one's sense of pride.
"Killing Curse," Weasley grunted, looking pale under his freckles. "He dodged it and tried to keep him away from the kitchen and the stairs, to keep him from the boys. He didn't have his wand - I

anything, weren't buying any of it. Just walking around. Looking. They did less than the exhibit pieces themselves, which moved and creeped along with the crowd through the winding corridors.
"Why are you whispering?"
that dark part of James whispered.
"Yeah, sometimes."
“Malfoys don’t apologize,” Draco recited almost automatically. He’d repeated this mantra at least a dozen times this afternoon but suddenly, under James’s cool glare, it seemed a frail argument. Which was a pity because until now it had seemed airtight.
He did not ask himself why Monty had been staying with his sister.
funny.
he nudged the man insistently as Alec began picking up the pieces dejectedly. "Still gotta customer."
"Yes - wait. You didn't take that mystery potion that showed up a few weeks ago, did you?" James pursed his lips and looked aside. "When?" he snapped.
Potter makes a big show of stepping out of the trousers pooled around his feet, then he toes off his shoes and socks clumsily, nearly falling over.
based on appearances. From the corner of his eye, he sees Potter smack his own forehead before stepping out from the meager cover of the pillar, standing resignedly at Draco's side.
"Who's Fred?" Monty asked. From the seat directly behind them, George startled.
"A home with a view," Malfoy confirmed, taking note. He seemed to be avoiding Harry's gaze, but then suddenly lifted his eyes and pinned him with a searching look that had Harry squirming loudly in the leather chair.
Monty's heart dropped low into his belly as he read on. Four pages. James had been sleeping with a four page Ode to Romantic Chocolates from his blond whore. Four pages, tucked under his pillow like a little schoolgirl. And
Hermione thought sadly.
on board with...with this whole...thing."
Three grown wizards in dark robes leapt up with their wands drawn, aiming right for James's chest.
"Give up the Point Me spell and you can do your own bloody warming charms," Draco suggests, casting the charm anyway.
There are no electrical plugs on his end, nothing to pick apart and use to start a fire. Not much to burn, anyway, except some old storybooks, some meager bedding, and his food supply. That certainly wouldn't be enough smoke to filter through their shared vent and incapacitate the man - and what would be the point, with Harry still locked in on his side?
"Well, Prince Haz of Above Ground Windows without Trees - shall we explore this palace?"
Harry fluttered his fingers in a parting wave as Sirius scampered from the room.
"And how did you end up as a test subject?" There was an excited edge to his scoff.
"Not on my life," Harry said sincerely. The man was brilliant. Florean awarded him a roaring laugh, and they were free.
Draco didn’t want to be there, but he didn’t have much of a choice after confessing to Blaise that something awful had happened last night. Something that resulted in him waking up, half dead, with bits of chocolate crushed and smeared in the folds of his rumpled robes. Shouting, there’d been some shouting, he relayed Blaise at lunch as he nibbled on a bit of dry toast. A hangover potion could only do so much for a thirty-year-old who’d consumed a shallow pond of liquor. That was why he only had dry toast for lunch, and why he’d been overpowered by Blaise’s outrageous demands for apologies, and why he now found himself escorted by Blaise and Weasley to the front door of Charming Chocolates.
beside him, whether in terror or joy, Alec couldn’t tell. The broom felt too thin and small to hold him up. Death was imminent. He clutched the handle and prayed to the laws of magic-physics. He was trembling, shaking, his feet kept sliding off the hooks behind him. He just wanted to land, he could ask his questions from the safety and comfort of the ground!
"Fudge, indeed," was all Malfoy said.
"Bundle up out there, you two!" Pansy called cheerily after them as they stepped out into the brisk October air. Harry wondered what nonsense Terry had told her before leaving for their new job at Hogwarts; Pansy looked like she'd been shopping at the same shop as the former receptionist - a shop that only sold the smuggest of looks. Draco shot her a rude gesture just as the door closed.
"Fuck off, I've work to do." He shoved the random bits of parchment into a random folder and stood imperiously. "Always a pleasure, Zabini. You know your way out."
"No, wait - Da'!" Arthur cried out, and James felt his heart stop. Tony grappled with Arthur while James surged to his feet, blood thundering in his ears, and then the Auror put a wand to Arthur's throat.
Draco spluttered. "I can't force him to - "
been another kid before him. He tries not to speculate.
he thinks desperately. He holds the old woman's gaze challengingly. Well, he holds it, at least. He's not sure how much fight he has left in him but he can stare an old tart down if it means she doesn't spot Potter.
"I could lend some assistance," he continued, creeping to the edge of the pallet. James cocked his head in mock-curiosity, and couldn't help but notice that Draco was keeping his share of the blankets firmly in place over his lap.
Scratch that, his shoe was on
"Er - tha's an expression, right? 'For a spell'? Did a get it wrong?" Monty turned to Harry who smirked and nudged their shoulders together in answer. "Not much of a reader, but am sure tha's a saying."
"Who's t'say it won't happen again?" Monty interrupted.
He says nothing.
"You're practically a potions master," Nott said snidely to Draco, still on the floor under his mother's hunched figure. "Three drops will do. Open up."
Monty insisted.
Potter shrugs, squaring his shoulders and lifting his head but still not looking at him. "They're not fond of…of things that’re different. Freaky."
"Spells," McGonagall corrected.
It was one for the history books!
James replied.
"If anyone needs a Mind Healer right now, it's you," his boss grunted shortly. Ron snapped his mouth shut. It wouldn't do any good to argue.
Harry's muscles jump and quiver in protest of the cold floor, but, as with the scratches on the walls, he welcomes any fresh experience, even the painful. He stares at a crack in the ceiling, wondering if it's grown, wondering if there's a fault line nearby, wondering if one day the ceiling will crumble down on top of him. He finds he doesn't even mind the thought, as long as he catches a glimpse of the sky before he's crushed.
"Good golly, Molly!" he says, drawing a line under the first list and adding
he signed.
James smiled gratefully and Monty breathed a little easier to see it.
"You're both rude," he announced. "Daddy, you better not tattle or say bad words no more, or I'll tell Grandmum on you."
"The last day, we skipped out early..."
Grandfather was always quick to bark. Scorpius shuddered and sneaked a peak at the door to ensure the grumpy old lout wasn't around.
Harry's head connects with the metal frame and everything goes black.
Potter was arrogant, always thinking he knew better than everyone, suspecting Draco and Severus and all the Slytherins were up to something. Granted, they were up to some things at the time, but giving them the benefit of the doubt could've saved a lot of fuss. All Draco was up to at the time was protecting his family. Potter would have done the same in his situation, but instead he got to play the hero and Draco got to stand trial.
James hesitated, waiting to see if Draco would revert back to his Healer self. They were one in the same, he knew, but that didn't mean he wanted to be picked apart. But Draco simply waited for him to continue, so he did.
he admitted.
It had been a long, emotional night, and neither of them had slept. Ron didn't answer the landline in the kitchen on the best of days, and this morning did not find either of them in peak condition.
Then he stalked back into the kitchen and shut the door. Numbly, James reached over and pulled the window shut.
"Stop it, now," he murmured into James's hair. "S'alright, ma little fish... Jus' a bit of water, cannae do
Your comments mean the world to writers who are needy for validation.  :)
Running steaming-hot tap water over the sealed package of a Strawberry Pop-Tart does wonders for improving the taste. Warm strawberry-adjacent flavored goo is far superior to bunker-temperature. This is as close as he gets to cooking, as the hob is trapped behind a locked door. In Fin's room. He's only been in that room once: his very first day down here, when he passed from the steep ladder-stairs to this prison cell.
"Draco - "
"That's faulty logic," Draco countered. "Severus would be terribly disappointed."
Charming grimaced, apparently not looking forward to the Auror report submitted by Weasley on September 1st. It was the type of incident report that was full of information but said nothing at all. A lot of names (four Aurors, five civilians), a lot of re-iteration of those names in a vague and unbiased description of the event (Charming snatched a wand that Auror Idiot had pointed at him and then he apparently used that wand to send Auror Moron into a wall), a lot of stamps and signatures at the bottom that signified Auror Weasel had done a fine job of tattling on his old friend.
, James insisted.
They stared at him, and he stared at the sky. Gods, it was so touchable, so
When he woke on Christmas morning, the sunrise nearly within his reach, he found one guest had already arrived. She was perched on the window overhead, ruffling her aged but familiar feathers, pecking the glass and tilting her head.
he signed heatedly.
"What could be natural but deviant at the same time?"
he continued, a hollow feeling in his stomach. A thump on the ceiling over his head told him the boys were still rough housing, but he barely registered it.
"Daddy says Haz makes brooms!" Scorpius chimed in and Harry flinched at his insistence on saying 'Daddy,' but nodded. Terry looked intrigued and Harry took a chance. He always felt a bit like everyone was just humoring him about his brooms, encouraging him to have something - anything - to do. But Terry didn't know who he was.
"Hi serious, I'm -
"Erm..." Harry's eyes darted up at the too-much chandelier over their heads and Malfoy smirked, giving him a conspiratorial wink and nod.
"I don't actually care, you know," Blaise sighed. Draco swatted him with the newspaper they had been pouring over just minutes ago.
"What's the choice then?" Arthur translated, earning an arm pressed against his windpipe. James twitched as Arthur choked slightly, but he seemed to be able to breathe for now.
Perfect.
"Only a Gryffindor would think a stroll through the Forbidden Forest is a sensible alternative to class."
It's abandoned. Frost covers every nook and cranny of the surrounding trees and roots, lending an air of death to what was once teeming with bustling, scuttling life. The ground is frozen over. Icicles are forming on the branches and Draco idly wonders if that's how the Malfoy line will expire—by an icicle dropping on the head of its young heir. How droll.
"We're buildin' an extension, boys," Monty answered, still watching for a reaction.
"Nobody sees me when I have this cart. I call it my Cart of Invisibility!"
"If I stay low, you can use me to trip her up."
Bit strange, overall.
"What?"
"Can a have yer old torch?" Alec asked immediately.
And it's another long while after that that the light comes back on.
Arthur shouted.
And he had to let them go.
The picnic was Ron's idea. The location was Harry's. The time - dawn - was Hermione's.
"I'll thank you not to repeat them at tea," he said with dignity, though he was burning with curiosity. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if Mr. James told him those words outside of tea time…
"Aye," he confirmed somberly. "Took the 'hard tae get' game seriously, what wae the boys. An' tae tell the truth, a think Aarti goin' out when she did messed 'im up more than he lets on."
"Why must you be so difficult, Adam?" Ben asks, sounding uncharacteristically bitter.
He couldn't speak, so he nodded instead.
"I'm to retrieve him." Lucius Malfoy's hair was brushed and pulled back neatly in a ribbon at the base of his neck. He sipped regally from the goblet, looking every part the Malfoy legacy Draco was raised to emulate. Scorpius saw and promptly attempted to lift his glass with one hand, slopping some of the pumpkin juice onto his cuff.
, James said, glaring daggers at him now.
"She's hairless!"
have anything to worry about, under his regime..."
Of course, the next day Harry didn't come by and Ron didn't find him at Grimmauld Place. He was only curious then, not worried. The Aurors had been tailing Harry since May for his protection. He was surely fine, just not where Ron could find him.
“Your point, Ms. Patil?” Bellatrix says in a dangerous voice. She’s holding the capped marker before her like a whip, ready to crack.
The sick feeling in his stomach turned into something a little more tolerable, like the wonderful feeling he got when he was in a car that went down a sudden dip in the road. He might do this again one day. He
Harry hesitated. "N-no, just the brooms for now..."
"I'm not my father, I don't—"
Cheeky blighter. He stretched the navy blue velvet cap over his head, reveling in the silk lining that would keep his hair smooth. It was ridiculous - luxurious and tacky at the same time. "How do I look?" he laughed, striking a little pose. Mum should've laughed - it would have made him feel less stupid - but instead she smiled knowingly. Ugh. Mums.
"He wouldn' say what. Just said he an' Monty are goin' through somethin'. Said they're tryin' to work it out but it's just hard cos they're both thick."
James hunched down even lower under Tony's gasping, twitching body and the curse hit the Auror on the shoulder, blasting it to pieces and setting off a ringing sound in his ears. James felt the sheer force of the spell knock into him and he was sure he'd either be hit with the next one or pummeled into the floor under Tony's body if he kept using him as a shield. He rolled out from under the bloody mess, getting caught against the firepoker in Tony's chest. He twisted free, his hip was screaming in pain, and lifted his wand -
because he'd given him his memories back along with a few coping mechanisms after six weeks of therapy. That mattered, but the magnetism was there outside of it all. Despite it all.
"Lack thereof."
“One must
It wasn't the ideal way to end what was already a not-ideal week. As Draco pondered what had led to this less-than-ideal dinner with Scorpius, Astoria, and Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy, his mother went on with her pillaging:
"A memory game. I start with a number an' a thing, then you repeat it and add yer own..."
James's hands blurted out before he could think. Monty blinked dumbly at him and after a moment, James decided to go on. He was in too deep anyway.
She was clearly too far gone for sensible thought.
In which Harry takes the scenic route, discovers the meaning of thatch, and opens a door by closing one.
After three miserable, brooding days and two vaguely probing letters from Draco, Harry decided to never speak of the night again, and if Draco couldn't handle that, then too bad. To be fair, Draco's letters struck a balance between concern and exasperation, and while there was no mention of Harry Potter, Harry couldn't bring himself to reply, to offer some sort of explanation for his meltdown in the tunnel, for fear of giving himself away.
"I'm not always at Hogwarts," Potter says easily, popping a shiny truffle into his mouth. Draco envies the truffle.
read the plot description not even five minutes ago, after all, before Malfoy Side-Along Apparated him here. Before the puddles distracted him. "I thought you might use these coops to your advantage in your business. Any one of them could easily be refurbished as a crafting shop."
"You wanna talk about it?" Sirius asked, his voice uncharacteristically soft.
He presses down against the tent in Potter's pants, drawing simultaneous moans from both of them. He can't quite convince himself that the heat in the room is a bad thing anymore when the best of the heat is
“She won’t turn Sirius in,” he explained, irritatingly soothing. “He’s safe. Just like you.”
Sealing up Charming's file and banishing it to the Ministry, Draco idly noted that he would have to find a new source for his chocolate supply. Potter had tainted Charming Chocolates after all.
Ohhh bugger… Harry's cheeks heated enough to fog his glasses and he whipped them off, wiping them on his wool coat.
"It's a standard disarming spell. If you put a little force into it, it can provide a decent propulsion of the target. Generally harmless but a good means of defense."
Last night, under Scorpius's watchful eye, he had sent a hasty thank you note (on his fourth-best stationary) for the new Central America Variety Box that had arrived around dinnertime. This morning, Draco thought that maybe he should have had this morning's brilliant idea last night, to save on stationary, decorum, words, and yes, a bit of pride. It was not prideful to write a second letter in the span of twelve hours for the sole purpose of inviting oneself over for boozy chocos.
He read it again, drinking in every word, every punctuation mark, every terribly-formed letter G. This was what he wanted, wasn't it? Another chance with Charming...and this time, it would be without that Gibbs fool breathing the same air. And an exhibit! Harry Potter wouldn't have been caught dead visiting a dragon art exhibit - perhaps destroying it with an actual dragon, Draco could see that happening, but to appreciate it? Never.
"What did ye say?!" the man suddenly said in a booming voice that instantly cut off the boys' celebrations.
"Their other father," Monty returned quickly, smirking in a way that was nothing less than a challenge. The boys narrowed their eyes, a united front, and Remus suddenly felt warm around the collar.
McGonagall interrupted.
"Oh yes,
Front door secured and potential customers sufficiently let down, he limped back to the counter, his hip twinging. He could make it short distances just fine without his cane and today hadn't been particularly hard on him. No long treks through the city, like yesterday. Just an average day in his little shop.
The Aurors had gone, after promising to send over their most sullen guard, Auror Mendel, and ordering Draco to keep the savior safe for a few hours in the meantime. James soon declared his head buzz-free, indicating that Draco's special combination of potions and charm had worn off.
"What?" Harry croaked.
"It's only eight," his brother said defensively. "There's plenty of time for another game. S'long as it's no Mun- "
It was close to midnight when James saw their guests leave, each with a small box of Charming Chocolates. Monty placed a hand behind James's troublesome hip, helping to ease him up the stairs. It wasn't the worst he had felt, but it took the bannister, his cane, and Monty threatening to carry him bridal-style to bed before James made it upstairs.
"I thought he were a ghost!" said Ninian Jerome, a witch from London. "He didn't say anything neither, seemed jumpy if you ask me. I suppose that's to be expected, what with all the excitement."
"Seemed like they were doing alright to me..."
Rain was pouring down and Harry was without an umbrella, but he was positively giddy as his clothes went soggy. He stamped in one puddle, then another, then nearly drowned in a deceptive lake on the corner. He laughed in the face of a peeved looking woman who gave him and his antics a wide berth. M & P Realty was just two blocks down from the Leaky and in that short distance, Harry managed to thoroughly soak himself in the rain.
"Ah."
he said.
What could go wrong.
James cut in, waving to get his attention, but it was useless.
“The reduced hours were just the start, Draco,” Harry murmurs, no less alarmed. He tears off his wet glasses and cleans them on his grey tunic. “It’s happening!”
Potter’s screaming now, his shoulders are pulled taut and he’s trembling. Draco can’t see his face as he pounds on the door but the sight of a plainly terrified Gryffindor is enough to irk anyone.
Unwrapping a large frame, James took one glimpse of the portrait inside and laughed so hard his stomach hurt. It was a painted portrait of Arthur seated in a huge leather wing-back chair, holding Leonard on his lap while he stroked her, reminiscent of an evil supervillain. Portrait-Arthur actually looked quite life-like, and he moved and smirked evilly, but Portrait-Leonard looked even more like a goblin than usual. James pulled Arthur in for a hug and told him they'd hang it up front-and-center in the sitting room. It was perfect and James wanted to look at it every day.
“Did you - did you run here or something?” Harry asks, bemused.
normal. Who was Harry to say otherwise? No experience with children, after all. Draco seemed to have forgiven Harry for blowing off their appointment a few days ago; he hadn't even asked why. Maybe it was normal to blow off appointments with real estate agents? He had no plans to do so again...he rather liked the man his old school rival had grown into. So now he carried enough gold for a trip on the Knight Bus.
There was a long silence and the room felt tense. Harry realized with a jolt that he had no idea how to end a conversation like this, with a stranger, or rather someone who was meant to be a stranger. But he didn't want to be found out for the unsocialized freak he was.
She ushers them into a quaint sitting room crammed with mismatched, obviously transfigured, mostly leather furniture interspersed with bits of antique ivory. The odd collection of furniture is perhaps more than is suited for someone living alone in a tiny cottage without regular visitors, but it lends the room a certain cosiness. Almost like they aren't alone. He half expects the squashy armchair in the corner to start talking. A massive iron cauldron boils away in a fireplace three times larger than the common room fire. It's clearly too large to accommodate a standard Floo network connection, but Draco isn't about to begrudge an old witch her privacy. A medley of spices fills the air and the warmth washes over Draco like a hot bath.
"Yes!" Oh Merlin, this was the part when he got the brilliant idea to mimic the git. Something about the schoolyard curses made him respond to the torture like an actual schoolboy.
"All's well - don't want you dating some pervert before you're done with your puberty potions." Sirius said it lightly, but his eyes didn't match his tone.
Monty started slowly, but James cut him off.
But Draco appeared out of nowhere for them. It was slow for James, starting in therapy and progressing from there (and then regressing to their Hogwarts years as he regained his memories - the timeline was all screwed up). But the boys had only met Draco over the Christmas holidays - during the Monty fiasco, no less! - before returning to Hogwarts for the spring term. They no doubt caught the speculative Prophet articles, but they didn't see or hear from Draco again until the disaster that was Easter hols, and then suddenly it was summer and James had to stumble through The Talk with them.
His breath catches and then he falls apart in a whole new way. He's not sure if he's laughing or crying. He thought he'd won this one, but of course Ben has found a new key to unlocking his madness. He truly is sick of seeing the room, though, so the laughter wins over.
Scorpius answered, "Mummy," just as Daddy said, "I did." Now Mr. James was hiding his laugh.
the liability of carrying a weapon that sparked and flared when he wasn't in his right mind. But lately the wand was never far from his hand.
Malfoy snorted. “
"Jealous?"
, he signed, not knowing what else to say. Malfoy looked perplexed now.
There was a tunnel they drove through, he could recall that much. Orange lights on the concrete walls slowed until they were at a stand-still, underground. Harry's chest tightened and he couldn't breathe properly. Draco's voice was muffled, as if on the other side of that blasted iron door, and despite a constant stream of
"Where are they staying tonight?" he interrupted, still facing away. There was a long pause. Scorpius was looking between them suspiciously.
"Because he was so charming?" Remus asked, getting sidetracked.
Monty laughed loudly and fully. There was a pause - Dad was probably signing - and then Monty said:
They took a Portkey directly to the stadium box. Ron insisted it was the safest way to travel; he insisted loudly and often. They arrived safely enough inside the box, where the others were waiting. But James was disoriented and nauseous, and he couldn't get the image of his graveyard nightmare out of his head. Green light. Figures in masks. Red eyes, pale skin...Voldemort. His cane slipped out from under him, jerking him back to reality, but Malfoy caught him before he could crash into the ground.
"They do. Springs are cheaper. Cleaner. Last longer." Potter's not quite back to sounding dazed, and he's not quite panicking, but the conversation has taken a weird turn. They're sitting on a tiny bed, locked in a possible oven, trouserless. And Potter's talking about mattress quality.
"Who are you?"
was the one trying to save his arse... "Those three young ones you mentioned, we don't have anything in the file matching their descriptions. Could be that they got away before the collapse, when you heard those Apparition pops. And we've got more to go on for the blond assailant so that's where we'll start looking until it's safe to use a pens - Tony, for shit's sake, stop fussing with it!" Tony dropped his hands away from his robe, clutching them together in front of him in a white-knuckle grip. "Merlin's bollocks, go home and sleep!" Ron ordered.
"You won't because I gave it back to Potter." Draco gave his best dignified sniff as he poured himself a glass of water. "It was a matter of urgency. I wasn't about to go out in Mum's vintage tartan beret!"
James simply said instead of explaining the concept of entitlement to the git.
"Shut up!"
"Yer rememberin' more," he observed.
"W-what - I'm - I'm sorry, I shouldn't have - " he stammered. He was a right prat.
"Potter,
, he said, changing the subject and gesturing to the oven.
he signed, tossing his cane carelessly against a cupboard.
"I don't want to Apparate!" he protested. He didn't know if that was true. He hadn't even considered learning or not learning, but agreeing to lessons now just felt like admitting they were right.
She shrugged, but her grin slipped free and Ron made a sort of drawn out sighing, snorting, gagging noise.
“Oh?!” She gestures at large to her many bangles and pendants.
"Could be," Potter whispers, eyes wide and unseeing, the stupid blind git.
But Potter - ugh, Charming, whatever - was a parent, and empty-nest syndrome was a powerful force. Besides, Draco wouldn't mind learning all the juicy details of how the Golden Boy had ended up a teenage father. And that was almost certain to come up if they pursued this goal.
"If they can't understand, then why can't they just shut up?" Harry grumbled. His hand grazed the tall grass and he pulled bits of it up as they strolled along, wrapping it around his fingers.
signed Monty, his hands short and curt.
"Da' - "
Malfoy was coming. He was bringing some wizard twit too, hopefully as a date. James had already sent out notes to Ron, Dean, and Seamus to give them a heads up about the incoming Slytherins. Asking them to play nice and not choose this week to cancel. He didn't ask Monty to play nice and not cancel. He
"Oi," Alec said, lighting up with an idea. "Get the big blue sheet from the linen closet."
“Jesus Christ,” Dean croaks.
Arthur thought darkly.
James flinched and Draco curled his lip while he made a mental note to look into a new tone-evening cream. His usual lot wasn’t doing him any favors, obviously.
"Doubt that very much," Harry snorted, then added earnestly, "But, thank you. Do you fly much these days?"
"A could run a whole side hustle!" Arthur realized. Oh Merlin.
"Just weeks ago, you see, a certain friend of mine voluntarily went to a Quidditch match with a certain Man Who Conquered," Blaise carried on. His expression shifted into something more considering, calculating. "Have you finally gotten your handshake, Mr. Malfoy?"
James nodded agreeably and Draco rallied himself to finally steer the conversation to more pressing matters.
"Is there anything else you'd like to work on, Mr. Charming?" He waited while the question was considered. There was certainly plenty to unpack in the case of his long lost Gryffindor rival. He hardly knew where to begin.
“Myths and legends aside, there's not another set like it - ”
"Are you looking for anything else in a home besides space for your work?" Malfoy elaborated slowly. Harry scowled and bit back a retort. How was he meant to answer questions properly if they weren't asked right in the first place?
"Potter!" Draco throws his arms around him. Potter's sweat isn't as tantalizing as it was just moments ago; now it's slippery and making it hard to just hold
"Mum, it's fine," he hissed as she climbed to her feet to follow.
he shrugged.
"There's an opening at Hogwarts," Harry blurted out, mind whirling. Luna had told him about someone in the circus who she referred to as 'they,' and he supposed this must be like that. "Hooch is retiring, or taking leave or something. You should apply. You were a brilliant flyer at Hogwarts!" When he -
for consignment.”
to M & P Realty and call the whole thing off!
James huffed a surprised laugh.
They closed the shop at nearly nine o'clock that night. Having no kids around to cook for meant that Monty could just get take-out while James minded the shop a little later than usual, then James could use a bit of quick magic to tidy up and shut down.
"And do you permit yourself a diddle?"
"That's to fatten us up!" he cries, slinging out an arm to indicate the picked over desserts. "She said to stay in here while she prepares breakfast!
"Harry, they're Aurors! What's gotten into - "
"Nott," he panted, glaring at the intruders from under his mother's arm. "Theodore Nott! He meant Theo, Mum, not Tank!"
His voice has risen with each alliteration and they see a light flicker through the syrup-swirled windows. Potter hauls him off the front porch and they duck behind a peppermint pillar, which isn't nearly large enough to properly hide them. Potter has his arms around him and he smells as delicious as the gingerbread.
half the night, for shit's sake, but James couldn't spare Monty half an hour last week to hash out their own issues? They might as well have fed each other grapes off the stem with the way James was hanging onto every over-pronounced, multi-syllabic, posh cunty word from Malfoy's mouth. It made Monty sick to his stomach.
Malfoy's business card had revealed, after some prodding with his wand, how to access the magical side of the building. He felt a little silly holding the doorknob while muttering the password, but then found himself - shoes dry, clothes dripping - in the clearly magical lobby of a small set of offices. The reception desk was manned - or womanned? - by a handsome - or pretty - person whose gender Harry couldn't quite place. The nameplate read Terry, which wasn't particularly helpful.
Today the sky was both overcast and blindingly bright with the promise of a storm in the far distance. Harry hurried from the Leaky Cauldron, adjusting his pageboy cap and wishing there was a less conspicuous way to floo out of Hogsmeade. He wasn’t sure how he felt about the clothes Sirius and Remus had collected for him over the months: a strange blend of the two men’s tastes. The distressed burgundy trousers, cream button-down, and thin leather waistcoat felt too dressy when all he did was work in a shed, play Quidditch, and lounge about the house. Then again, anything was better than the childish clothes he had been forced to wear before.
"Oh." Harry licked his lips. "No." Sawdust coated his glasses, a heavy monkey wrench he didn't remember ever seeing before was clutched in his left hand while his right braced his weight against the nearest leg of the table.
James asked Abbott.
Like a bull. Or rhino or horse or something. What was a hippogriff?
"You're on a cushion on the floor of this space," she went on. "Find what that floor might be. Is it a luxurious carpet? Perhaps a rug on a hardwood floor? Or textured stone, or smooth tile?"
"Paperwork?"
, he had signed, that challenging spark in his eye that told Monty he was ready to fight again. Because of course he was, when
"I have it!" Potter shouts into his face, resting a steadying hand on his shoulder while brandishing a long thin metal wire. "We need to get to the door!"
"Carry on, then. The rubbish bins won't inspect themselves."
“But you said—“
That was why Monty pitched a royal fit when James stopped bringing him along to therapy. Merlin. Things were making sense for the first time in
On top of increasingly violent Prism raids, a rising blood purist movement in the south, and anti-werewolf rhetoric turning into dozens of cases of harassment, the Ministry now had to contend with disappearance of Auror Anthony Goldstein.

Alec rolled his eyes at the all-too-familiar love story, moving to stand on top of his bed and raise the radio high in the air with determination. Now the voices were coming through clear as day.
"Gibbs?" he choked out.
"You'll compose the invitation post-haste," Mum corrected. "I'll take care of the rest."
"If your name's Haz, she's got to have a good name. Haz's Mum..." Scorpius mulled it over in his head. "Hum!"
"Program?" Alec asked.
Ron tried very hard to choke back a laugh. Harry chose to ignore it.
. He was meant to trust James, but the sight of his little bird fluttering around in a tizzy all of yesterday and today was driving Monty up the wall. He kept smiling for no reason. Well, obviously for a reason, but no reason he had any business smiling at if Monty was meant to be trusting him.
"You think you've changed, but you're just as racist as ever!"
He heard Sirius come in this time and rushed to look busy, knocking over the open pot of stain on the bench. He growled. He could do precisely
But he rather hoped Draco wouldn't just leave him behind again.

his boyfriend. The boys hadn't given any...any declaration of approval, or permission. They'd simply gotten used to Monty over the years.
“It’s hot,” he adds usefully. Fuck, but it’s hard to think. The heat is everywhere, pressing in on them from all sides. The air is heavy, hard to breathe. There’s an awful tingling sensation in his legs and he chances a glance down. His knees and shins are blistering before his eyes in angry red circles that match the ones on Potter’s back.
Mr. James added.
, Monty asserted, feeling slightly sick at the insinuation that he had pressured a starving man into a relationship. But that wasn't how it happened and they both knew it. He got James better first, that was always the priority. Those comments and flirtations weren't serious. That was just Monty being Monty. His main concern was to help James, and when James was better, he came to his senses and saw what Monty had to offer beyond food and groceries.
I am an Unspeakable, Draco. I can respect obligatory reticence, but I simply cannot let this mystery rest."
"Actu'lly, it's for my ears only."
Two young boys stood to the left and slightly behind Potter. Draco didn’t miss how his hand - the one not gripping the cane with white knuckles - came out in front of them protectively as the group was jostled by the crowd. They didn’t look panicked, but rather in awe of what was happening. Draco tried to imagine what it would be like at the epicenter of a Potter-riot. Actually, they looked like they were having fun...
prescribed?" Monty grunted, not feeling particularly charitable toward her anymore. He handed over some fresh vials from James's supply.
- on bloody students!"
Draco watched with no small amount of petty jealousy as James played some sort of signing game with Scorpius. He wondered if his own father had refused to play with him as a child - who, with a soul, could deny a child their play? - or if Draco had simply forgotten those early memories.
"No thank you..."
"An awful lot of hand-holding lately, isn't it?" she said.
he protested.
Alec thought it was hilarious when people called Dad by that name, it was so weird! Almost weirder than being accepted into magic school, in a way. Of all the crazy names and personas that he and Arty had invented over the years for their dad’s mysterious past life, Harry the Wizard-Hero was just hysterically funny.
“This one!” he cried without indicating right or left. Harry took a guess and placed his hand gently on the right leg, earning a fresh wave of wails. He snatched his hand back and looked around for help, but no one was near.
James asked sarcastically.
Alexander Charming was not an athletic boy by any means, but he liked to know how things
Oh. Monty hadn't been staying up to watch telly. He had been kipping on the couch.
James gestured to the folder.
"Right. Brute force."
something, but he's lost in a way he hasn't been since the disaster with Pansy. Harry speaks like he's got Longbottom's toad in his throat. He wants,
"Have I made you, ah...uncomfortable?" Harry frowned at the man, confused. "Discussing Rolanda's position, I mean. If it's really something you don't want to do, of course you - I only - I suppose I am pushing you, but I never meant - "
"Well, do it then!"
Tony flinched and went for his robe's buttons again. The old photos taken by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement forensics team had been a grisly sight. Five bodies were left in the house after Fletcher was rushed to St. Mungo's. The bodies were crushed and broken by the collapsed house, oozing in horrible ways, their flesh riddled with the old nails that had once held Potter Cottage together.
Arthur grinned back as Dad rejoined the table and started shuffling through the stack of books on the end near the wall. He laid out a few of his old sketchbooks, gesturing to them. Arthur flipped through a few before landing on an inked drawing of a vintage-style Batman surrounded by villains. He tossed it back over to Dad, who opened the box of colored pencils. He found a few empty pages at the back of another sketchpad for himself and sat back down to work.
“Oh, are you on break, Pansy?”

company-wide image permissions,
Odd duck.
James signed. Draco nearly dropped his tea.
“Elegant choice,” Draco declared, dry as sand, and Harry’s heart dropped. It was lively enough; the billiards table hosted a group of women around their age, and there were more full booths than empty ones. Harry darted a glance at the bar before dragging Draco over. “You’re - “
, no less—and end up in this state.
"Oh, 'man up'?!" she scowled, feigning - or perhaps not feigning - offense. "No
They do.
Weasel darts a hand into the box of chocolates that Mum prepared, but Potter fends him off valiantly. He pops a truffle into his perfect mouth, sucking on it whole and glaring over at Draco as if in challenge. The Gryffindor table descends into roaring chaos:
James gets an owl and she does her best to keep up.  We're checking in all over the place, folks.  Did you think I forgot about my precious characters?  Stick around because we've got owl post, twin shenanigans, texts (remember flip-phones?), excessive water is featured TWICE in this one, and there are names aplenty for the cat and owl.
Another quiet Christmas at Malfoy Manor. Or as quiet as it could get with his father raving at the top of his lungs in the east wing and with Scorpius belting out Christmas songs with the house elves in the kitchens. Tone-deaf buggers, the lot of them, Scorpius included. Astoria fucked off after lunch to visit her parents, leaving Draco to sedate his father and entertain his mother.
"You don't want to invite it back in when it's already forcing the door open."
“I think—” Potter hesitates, then releases his hold on Draco. He leans back slightly, unsticking his chest from the back of Draco’s shirt. His hands hover anxiously to either side of Draco. “I think it gets hotter each time we touch.”
"It's not necessary," Ron argued.
Harry's face looked ready to split in half.
"It's him, Minerva," he insisted for what felt like the hundredth time in an hour. "You'll see!" He hadn't lost that manic feeling since he saw the photo on the wall. He could hardly feel his feet as they carried him closer to the shop. To Harry.
him. Every bit of him. And he couldn't have that unless he had control.
Haz Draco figured him out?? (get it?)
"I'll write you two, in fact," he answered cheekily.
revealed to have cast the Cruciatus Curse. They learned that Harry had asked for a moment of privacy from his DMLE guard, a moment to himself to visit his parents, a moment of peace. And that was the last anyone heard from him for twelve years.
"Someone
James finally asked.
"Did your blind house elf dress you this morning or are you following Potter's new vagabond trend?"
"Even Mummy doesn't go to buy her own," he said. "They've a mail-order system." Enough said. Or it should have been, but he was in the presence of Blaise -
[enclosed: Invisibility Cloak]
“Only that it's all blood-diamonds, shoddy gems, and general crap,” she replies flatly.
James smirked, looking positively...Slytherin. He repeated the sign slowly, eyes sparkling. Draco recognized it as very similar to one of the alphabet signs: his left pointer was extended with his right pointer and thumb curved into it, forming a visual approximation of the letter D. But then the right hand made a small leap forward off of the left.
"I remember." Draco waits, but Potter avoids his gaze. He goes for another truffle, moaning sensually. Blood rushes south and Draco forces the conversation forward before he does something else. "Why is that?"
They said nothing for a long time. Then:
"LOOK AT THESE!" he screamed, spotting a particularly vicious looking dragon on the cover of one of the design catalogues.
Malfoy nodded once but his lips tightened, going as pale as his skin and blending in with his chin.
"...stealin' ya brother's gadgets all a'time! And jus' where were'ya goin' in such a hurry, curry? Runnin' from Alec, no doubt!"
. Even Dean and Seamus were catching on to Harry's rising temper, but Malfoy remained blissfully unaware of the danger until Harry snapped. Literally - he snapped a huge bar of chocolate into bits and started hurling the pieces at Malfoy's head from across the kitchen. Ron was starkly reminded of when Harry threw a Potter Stinks badge at his forehead in fourth year, except this showing was much more pathetic. At first Malfoy laughed, but then the bits kept flying and Malfoy resorted to throwing them back just as ferociously. Both of them being drunk off their arses, not a single piece hit the mark, but the message was clear.
Remus gasped and swallowed a truffle whole, promptly choking.
"It's one in the morning, Weasel," Draco grumbled as he descended the stairs, resisting the urge to rub at his itching eyes. "What brings you and your freckles to my parlor at one in the morning?"
"James?" he croaked. His voice was scratchy with sleep, not panic.
Dad said, limping over to snatch the parchment out of his hand. He turned away to smash the letters into a haphazard pile, shoving them away from prying eyes.
, he answered, not feeling as much shame as he thought he would have upon remembering this moment.
of thunder tore through the kitchen. His ribs reverberated with the force of it. The light fixture overhead popped, raining down glass, and he ducked his head under the open oven door, pulling Rachel down with him.
“Draco would like to apologize for whatever happened last night,” he said, tending his own tea with no little amount of showmanship. If Draco didn’t know any better, he’d say Blaise was managing to take offense at the fact that James couldn’t possibly know how he took his tea. He was one glib comment away from an official insanity diagnosis.
"Traitor!"
The shop looked completely different when it was deserted: modest in size, it featured several narrow display cases crammed together in the middle of the room, showing off an enticing array of shiny chocolates, cheerful gift-boxes, and brightly colored foil. Behind the long front counter was a door with a gold hand-plate on it - presumably to push through to the kitchen - and a doorway that revealed a lopsided set of stairs leading up.
James limped out of the room, leaving his cane behind.
"Why?"
Potter holds firm while she claws at the door. She's
"I graduated with honors," he said in the special clipped tone he reserved for the truly inferior. "Honors earned in the field of memory recovery."
"I wish I could take a photo," Ron began in an inspired, important voice. "And then send that photo back through time - round sixth year, I'd say. Before all the ugliness, you know? Maybe it was just sexual tension back then."
"I want to close this case," he said after a long pause.
"No, no, not at all! It was just a convenient base - hormone blockers and accelerators, when they're prepared properly, they're very expensive because they take months to make. But this was more like an instant-recipe, provided you could afford a basic love potion. Apparently it's tricky to add anything else to the potion regimen, even a Pepper-Up, not without severe interactions - so it's not a popular long-term choice for people who actually
"Are you alright?" Remus asked gently.
"Poppycock." James tried again, but Draco carried on: "You split with your Muggle and your boys are feeling a reasonable amount of grief," he said. "It doesn't mean your family's broken."
"Am goin' tae bed," his brother said around a huge yawn.
A loud series of crashes and bangs foretold the chaos downstairs. With a synchronized eye roll that only parents could master, they both clasped hands and hauled each other to their feet. By the time they were washed and brushed and dressed, they were greeted downstairs by three perfectly angelic boys, which was most incriminating, and five plates of waffles with messy edges, which was a welcome consolation prize to what had been interrupted.
Fuck. He definitely had a headache now.
staring back at him curiously. He stepped forward and cleared his throat, running nervous fingers along the envelopes in his hands. "Is your mother around? This is usually a conversation best had as a family."
Draco snorted inadvertently and looked away, firmly clamping down against the smile that tugged at his lips. He would
He heard the boys' door open.

. They don't, and marshmallow isn't even a brand. Look, they're on the bottom shelf - there's different brands
, he said.
"Oh," Draco said, eyes sparkling. "My mistake. I've a friend in the Department of Mysteries, shall I call on him to investigate this pervasive illusion for us? Or shall we go upstairs?"
“Hey, Harry!” Her voice sounds oddly loud in the women’s clothing section; the ebb and flow of noise is muted by the fabric. Her pink employee tunic sports a sleek silver name-tag that reads
“ - right in the sweet spot between starving and saving.
"Yes, and I imagine you read that in the supplies list yesterday, you were quite thorough," McGonagall answered, looking at Harry knowingly. He seemed to force a smile before he continued signing:
"Stay low…" he murmurs, trying not to move his lips. He's not sure how much she can hear through the door, through the ventilation holes. "Keep working."
But they find their perfect fit again. There's something awkward about it, something...expectant. Draco's expecting something, Harry's clearly waiting for him to
"Wha' fire?!"
, he acquiesced. Monty looked ready to go on and James waved him down.
[scratched out ink]
Dad shifted in his seat, running his fingers over the grain of the table. Alec bit into the waffle and a string of syrup clung to his chin. The bite stuck in his throat and he washed it down with milk. Everything tasted like rubber. Who was it that usually made waffles, Dad or Monty?
"Here here!" Scorpius toasted, raising his green and silver teacup ceremoniously. Daddy toasted too, but Mr. James didn't, which was - "Rude..." he grumbled under his breath.
Harry launched out his seat and joined Draco by the massive window on the eastern wall. There was a bundle of rope and fabric hanging from the window ledge, eye-level. Draco's hands - he'd removed his own gloves at some point - were trembling slightly and Harry gave him what he hoped was an encouraging smile. Draco unclipped part of the bundle and stretched it out over to the pillar, clipping it into place there. Harry gaped at the hammock. It was beautiful - striped, aged canvas, smooth under his fingertips, with soft rope and tassels on either end. The blankets and pillow hadn't been visible when it was folded up, but it was all there, looking as cozy as a nest.
A horrible twist is building up in his thigh and he tries to ignore it in favor of the brilliance going on between them, but it claws and coils and forces its way through his bliss. He hurls himself forward onto Potter’s chest, winding the oaf, as he stretches his leg out behind him.
This was a common question people posed when they learned about Dad's amnesia. It was a fascinating topic, of course, but everyone else got the vanilla version of the story. Alec, Arthur, and Monty, however -
Harry sent Monty a withering look and started signing agitatedly. Arthur and Alec startled slightly at whatever he was saying and then Monty cleared his throat, looking chagrined.
Alec closed the door behind his brother and perched on the stool at his desk, waiting with bated breath. They'd noticed something was off with Monty and Dad lately. They hardly spoke to each other since the boys had come home. And Monty, Arthur pointed out, hadn't touched Dad once all week. Not a hug, not a nudge, not even a friendly pat. Nothing. Something was wrong.
Hermione shuffles in place, darting a glance at the murdered mannequin.
“Where’s your husband now?” Potter blurts out, like a git.
"This is personal humiliation, Draco!" she cried, lifting her face to stare at him incredulously. "They blasted his business for the world to see and you threw it back in his face with a shit comment and one of your little smirks!"
But Ben is already closing the door behind him as he retreats to the other side. And then the light - the only light source in the room, a stark bulb behind a protective metal cage above the door - goes out.
. And then more words came out of his mouth, ones that he had no business screaming at James, or anyone, but which escaped him when James kept staring at him with wide, blank eyes:
It was a stunning sight on their sitting room floor, one that should be painted by a master and displayed in the History of Magic corridor for posterity. Draco and Harry, leaning against the wall next to the hearth, were totally engrossed in each others' hands yet again. She couldn't think of a time these past three days when they weren't holding hands, or fumbling through oddly tactile and cooperative sign language lessons, or finding some other way to touch.
Alec sighed melodramatically. "You underestimate yer own brother..." He pulled out a modified clock-radio with a super-large antenna and the bottom half of a walkie-talkie strapped to it. He plugged it in and cringed at the loud, piercing feedback, before adjusting the knobs. At first all he got was static, then some music and a French radio station. Once he remembered to disable the actual clock-radio side of the contraption, he got the walkie-talkie to feed into the larger speaker of the radio, and the voices from downstairs began to drift through.
"Nothin' else gets through yer thick skull!"
Diversity Training
As Tony approached with the vial, Narcissa snarled in a way that clashed strangely with her exquisite dress robes, but Nott gave Arthur a wrenching twist that had him crying out in pain. Draco pushed himself up, out of his mother's reach.
"When I want to." Harry was very much
Harry grinned widely and M-- Draco checked his watch, a flash of regret in his eyes dimming the effect of his suddenly pink cheeks.
The boys saved James's gifts to them for last because they were
"My mistake, Weasel."
“Downsizing?” he repeats blankly. “They’re laying people off?”
, he explained shortly, uncapping the pen with his teeth and chewing on it with vicious intent.
Every holiday brought business but Christmas was ridiculous. The customer flow never seemed to stop that Wednesday but James still found time to wriggle and dance behind the counter. The Daily Prophet that morning had detailed the Wizengamot's final ruling on werewolf/non-lycanthrope adoption. Three weeks ago, the Muggle girl had been reunited with her adoptive parents and the family sent home with an apology, seeing as there were no laws currently on the books barring werewolves from adoption. More than that, however, was the decision that took place yesterday. James went with Hermione to the protest, leaving Monty to tend to the mail-orders.
"So…. Malfoy?" Ron asked slyly not five minutes into dinner. There was a beat, and then he and Hermione were practically falling out of the booth.
James found that he was looking forward to his next appointment.
know you're right," his godfather said, holding a finger up. He sounded strained. He tried to say more, but failed to produce anything besides a sort of growling-sigh.
Arthur creeped down the stairs and pushed the kitchen door open, only to find the light on and Dad at the stove, idly stirring something in a tall pot. Part of him knew he was caught, but the other part wondered what the hell he was idly stirring in the stainless steel pot that was reserved only for chocolate because it certainly couldn't be chocolate. Dad never tended his chocolate absentmindedly.
For the first time in years, James's fingers were fumbling over the words. He couldn't think of the signs fast enough to reply to Monty's rapid-fire accusations, not when he was quaking from head to toe and barely able to keep from throwing something.
But no. James went on to explain every little chore that Monty insisted on doing for him, every little moment Monty thought it was necessary to supervise him, to tell him how he should do it instead. She listened as he told them about waking up at dawn just to have some time to himself. He told them about discovering Harry's invisibility cloak in the trunk and using it just to carve out a modicum privacy. She listened in stunned silence as he told them, in his own way, how Monty made
"So," Harry said, scurrying over and hopping to land with two feet when he came up even on Malfoy. "What's next, Malfoy?"
up," he corrects, preening slightly. "I keep myself in fighting form, you see." Not that there is any discernible difference in their physiques, but Draco thinks he can argue a bit more health to his frame than Potter. And some inches. And tamable hair. Pity about the shoulders, though, Potter has a splendidly broad set shoulders that complements his rugged jawline, and even the glasses aren't—
Shit hits the fan, goes down, splatters everywhere.  In author-terms, this is the "turning point" of the story.  So buckle up for the next 16k.
Monty was dissolving into snorts and giggles, Alec was covering his entire face to keep quiet, and Arthur was in his element.
"What is that?!" Alec gasped.
"Draco..."
James could already see the panic in Monty's eyes and he gave him a sharp look.

(Is this enough slow-burn heat for you Drarry fans?  Yes/no/kinda?  They're idiots and they're not fully cooperating with me.  They want another three chapters but that's not in my contract.)

for a glimpse of Harry. The world had given up; the Aurors and Minister Shacklebolt had given up; Remus, Minerva, Mum, Dad, even Hermione had given up. But Ron had given up on Harry before, in the Forest of Dean, and he couldn't do it again.
