“No, Potter, I just love it when you sully my clothes with your big Gryffindor hands. I thought I’d put my outfit all he way back together just so you can do it again,” Draco says, grabbing his jacket from the chair, then picking Harry’s off the floor and smoothing it out.
Harry falls asleep because he’s never had any sexual encounter that wasn’t an overnight, that wasn’t breakfast in the morning and cuddles, and a shared shower. But of course when Harry wakes up Draco is nowhere to be found. Not in his room, not the kitchens, not in any of the various other rooms Harry wanders into while the guilt is setting in.
Draco takes his time removing his socks. Harry lifts his foot exactly three inches off the ground and doesn’t make any move to help beyond that. It’s probably childish but he’s always enjoyed having someone wait on him that way. Sometimes the next day, if he can get Draco to stick around until the next day, he’ll let the other man dress him in the morning too. Draco always obliges arguing that he “barely can” on his own, and “it’s really quite sad you don’t seem to own anything that isn’t your school colors,” and of course “Merlin, if we got a little product in that nest of yours you really could be a knockout.”
His head has been on the bed for maybe three seconds when he feels fast fingers on his belt. Draco is undoing his buckle with the same determined swiftness he takes to making coffee in the morning. Harry shifts his hips up to let Draco slide off his pants and trousers.
Harry walks down the stairs to the seats he had gotten, no one seems to notice him, too engrossed in the game. Which is fine by him. Harry spots Draco easily, his white blonde hair sticking out like a beacon, Harry slides down the aisle to his seat next to him. Draco doesn’t turn.
Draco’s eyes are big gray beams. “Like I would ever pass up an opportunity to fuck the savior of the Wizard world himself, are you kidding me?” His tone is so level and serious Harry almost doesn’t comprehend the words. Key word being almost, he felt his face break into a grin. He grabbed Draco’s forearm rubbing his thumb up and down the inside of it.
aspect of him and Ginny’s marriage and he wasn’t sure how helpful he’d be in discussing Draco anyway. He had considered asking Ginny but he wasn’t sure how he would react if she came to him asking advice on shagging another bloke. That left  Hermione who was always the sensible one, and her advice while it made sense to Harry, never seemed to work on Draco quite the way he had planned. In fact no strictly logical advice seemed to work on Draco. Also it was hard to stay vague with identities on someone as curious as Hermione.
The fifth year comment is news to him and  Harry has to lean up to check just how serious he’s being. Draco’s of course not looking at him, attention set on the fingers going in and out of Harry’s ass. Brows narrowed and eyes foggy. He increases his speed and Harry falls back down. It’s one way to avoid questions.
“You don’t understand. Luna he’s not like- I can’t just..." he takes a pause, "Talking to him is different.”
Draco just snorts, “I wasn’t aware we were normal people, Potter. The prophet would be all over it the minute we stepped out within 500 feet of each other. I can see the headline now
When he removes Draco’s clothes it’s fast, different from Draco’s slow undressing of him, they’re just obstacles in the way of what he really wants. Harry doesn’t have the most experience sucking dick, but as he does with everything he approaches it with an earnest naivety, that you can’t help but want to encourage. He pulls long strings of words from Draco.
“Well it’s not an entirely new feeling no, but it’s gotten so much worse! I can’t concentrate on anything, everything reminds me of him. And I’m always thinking about him, what he’s doing, how he is, who he’s with. And I can’t say no to him. No matter how hard I try,” Harry admits before looking up at her, “What should I do?”
“Yes, well we all have our faults,” Draco rake’s his eyes over Harry’s body, all reptile, “Mine are apparently aging boy hero’s, with bad hair and good hands.”
“Boring you already?” He says shifting off of Harry’s lap and Harry can tell he’s concealing more than a little bit of hurt from the comment.
“Hello Harry,” she said sitting on the large chair in front of the love seat the twins always brought him too.
He found himself extremely thankful that Ginny due to her employment with the publication had been on top of framing the story strangely enough, as a joke saying the kiss was a public protest, a mockery of the prejudices that had once separated them.
“Well, it’s not like you’ll go out with me in public any other way. You didn't give me a lot of options, Malfoy,” Harry says.
“Oh, Potter,” he says mouth brushing Harry’s ear, “I thought you knew? I can only get off from your utter discomfort.”
The man keeps staring at Harry for a few more moments as Harry feels increasingly more and more uncomfortable, he does occasionally deal with fans of Ginny’s and he has always considered it a step up from his own fans, who he doesn’t really know how to address. At least he can relate to Harpies fans, for he too considers himself an admirer of Ginny Weasley. The man finally looks away.
“Were you saying something?” Draco says. Harry turns his head to the side burying it in his arm, because one way or another Draco Malfoy is going to be the death of him and at this moment he’d honestly prefer the duels to the teasing.
Draco let out a short breath that wasn’t quite a laugh, “I still can’t tell if you getting off on insults is hot or repulsive.”
“Merlin, who’d of thought he had it in him,” Ginny says, wiping away tears from her eyes, as she sits next to Draco on the couch, a pile of letters in her lap and on the coffee table.
He’s still laughing and it’s all quite unnerving. Harry approaches him linking Draco’s fingers in his own.
“Can you really not go five minutes without the whole ‘I died for your sins’ spiel,” Draco hissed, “it’s not half as cute as you think it is.” He did finally dig his nails into Harry’s back. His annoyance seemingly powering an increase in speed. Harry practically purred.
is what it was supposed to be, Harry thinks. It was always this, all the misplaced, emotion, the obsession, the dance. Everytime he finds himself locked inside the wave of Draco Malfoy he’s reaching all over again. Draco’s mouth is full and wet and as he pulls off to lick a stripe down to Harry’s stomach, he feels as if he’s going down to his very core.
It’s a process, Draco putting his long fingers to work. Harry letting the sensations rush over him, but after a while he just wants what he came for. Impatient as ever he breathes out, “You ever going to get around to actually fucking me, Malfoy?”
Still Harry came back persistently every week with a new problem and Luna always seemed happy to see him and inform him of a newly discovered animal, or a magical health tea, or show him a rash on her arm and ask, if he knew what it was? And if he thinks she should go to a hospital? She was like a really inexpensive relationship therapist with no boundaries and child secretaries. More than that she was his friend.
By the time Harry gets home he is greeted by the Prophet. The kiss of course was plastered on the front page, an endless loop of him and Draco meeting while Quidditch fans looked on in varying states of shock and awe. Harry didn’t want to read any of it but the Prophets story was the least offensive. The headline was far less obscene than anything Draco would have pitched
Harry stares eyes wide, since he and Draco began hooking up they had never seemed to move past blowjobs. Harry finds himself eager to push past nodding as Draco looks on with his attempt at neutral expression, mouth quirked, concerned eyes.
Draco felt an answering smile wanting to tug at his lips. “Thanks, Potter. For telling me all this. I do feel better.”
Peeves started advancing towards him, and Draco took a hasty hop backwards, but the stairs behind him cut off any further retreat.
He arranged one crutch under each arm and stood up. The crutches were exactly his size - they nestled neatly into each armpit, with a cross-bar for his hands to hold at just the right height. He carefully leaned his weight on them and swung his right foot forward. It was easy, and his left foot never had to touch the ground at all.
His mother frowned at his father. “You know that it doesn’t work that way. He owes Draco less than nothing. In fact, Draco owes
. Here he had been so caught up in how far away he was from the Wizarding world and the war had made it here too, into the heart of muggle London. He couldn’t decide if that was reassuring or not.
“Yes.” And now he was going to tell Potter about his powers, and there was nothing he could do about it. Draco felt stirrings of panic. This was worse than Veritaserum. At least a truth potion let you be evasive. “I can get wood to grow in any way I want, even dead wood. I should be able to affect water too, because I am also descended from a water spirit, but I haven’t had a chance to test that power yet. Did the tree actually kill my - him?”
“Oi! Hey! They’re doing blood magic!” The someone from the other table had started to shout. Draco registered a flurry of movement as people stood up from the benches around them.
Draco squeezed his eyes shut. Lestrange used the hand squeezing Draco’s chin to slam Draco’s head back against the floor. The rag-rug softened the impact slightly, but the pain still bloomed across the back of Draco’s skull.
In the last five or so hours, that serene clarity had already faded as if it had never been. Only the hands gripping his kept him from detaching completely from his own body. He welcomed the numbness, though; some part of him knew that this exhausted fog was going to be preferable to whatever emotion came next.
Draco stared up at the ceiling and wondered if his parents had been transferred away from the Hogwarts dungeons yet.
“Potter…” McGonagall looked like she was struggling to decide which words to use. “Are you - quite sure you wish to offer Malfoy your hospitality? He has the means to rent temporary accommodation.”
Draco felt himself go cold. Living back at the Manor… He licked his lips, mouth suddenly dry. “No. I would… prefer an alternative.”
He slowly swung across the room and lowered himself onto the armchair on the other side of her desk.
right behind him nearly made Draco fall over again. He forced himself to remember his leg and managed to spin round relatively deftly, to see a tall male Weasley standing under the tree, arms crossed.
Draco lowered himself back to the armchair while the doctor rolled back around to her side of the desk, reaching for a notebook and beginning to scribble into it. Draco heard her muttering, “… perhaps eighty percent muscle loss…”
There was the family villa in the south of France, but he had to be in the country to continue on the Path and atone to his victims.
“Okay, let’s get this broom in the air. You can’t just down a whole bottle at once you know, you have to pace yourself, so we need to get started if you want to pass out before midnight.”
He stumbled through making himself breakfast (another first). There wasn’t much to eat, since Potter had never actually done any food shopping last night, so Draco was reduced to eating some left-over plain rice from the curry. However, there were a few tea bags still left in the cupboard, and at least Potter had shown him how to use the kettle.
McGonagall’s eyebrows rose. Pomfrey coughed. Draco could feel his face burning. Gods, he hated honesty. Still, Potter had only asked him so that he could help Draco avoid being coerced by Shacklebolt.
“Got your father’s looks too, didn’t you, pretty boy. What a waste. Bet you’ve never even been touched, have you?”
His friends… Parkinson? Zabini? Nott? They would all have their own problems happening around now, and Draco doubted they’d be interested in having anything to do with him in the current post-war political climate. He didn’t blame them.
Potter barked a laugh as he flopped down onto the bench, and Draco felt a small flare of victory in his chest, and had to suppress a smile. He hopped up onto his crutches and swung himself into the tiny kitchenette as he kept talking.
Draco grabbed it and didn’t let himself think as Potter pulled him up onto his one working foot. He was surprised to find that he actually could stand up.
“Which is a form of ancient elf magic. It works for me because my family are descended from wood-elves.” Draco stopped. Once again, he hadn’t meant to say that last part. Apparently the magic had decided that ‘explain yourself’ meant revealing family secrets. Shit.
“Anyway.” Potter looked awkward. “I thought the Path of the Penitent thing stopped people from hurting you?”
Potter rubbed at the back of his neck with one hand, looking miserable. “Sorry, Bill, I - I want to, but - I, I can’t right now. I just can’t.”
) just as she bent down, twisting a memory off her wand and into the channel at her feet. The memory poured down smoothly towards the natural pensieve - until Draco had to crawl over that same channel, the cloak dragging through the silver liquid, and McGonagall stood abruptly. Draco’s shaking hand landed right in it, and he felt the slippery, sacred memory coating his fingers and had to stifle a panted sob, and McGonagall turned her head sharply towards where the cloak was probably no longer fully concealing him -
Winky hesitantly touched his forehead. Draco felt the low-level headache that he had almost stopped noticing starting to ease. He opened his eyes and saw Winky flinch back, as if expecting Draco to strike her for daring to touch his face.
The doctor was looking at him shrewdly when he surfaced. “You don’t have to tell me how you got injured, Mr Malfoy, only in what ways it has limited your movement.”
Madam Pomfrey crossed her arms. “Well, first of all, as I keep saying, the Baron is protecting you.” She nodded up at the ghost, who became more visible for a moment. Draco met his eyes. The grim Slytherin ghost never talked to any of the students and he didn’t talk now, but his haunted gaze met Draco’s and he gave him a short nod, before turning back to face the rest of the ward.
Draco gritted his teeth. He wanted very much to get angry at this upstart muggle. Who did she think she was to tell him, Draco Malfoy, what he could and couldn’t do? He took a breath through his nose, then another one, glaring across the desk at the doctor, who didn’t look nearly as cowed as she should. In fact she was looking at him with - was that
He was almost happy to see the same taxi driver man again, and he had a strange urge to tell him about the appointment, and the exercises he was supposed to do twice a day. Fortunately, he was too terrified by the movement of all the cars around them to open his mouth. He did, however, remember to arrange for the man to pick him up again for his appointment next Tuesday.
For a moment Draco could vividly imagine the terror of the Snatchers crashing in, of being dragged out by the hair, tied up and brought to the Manor to be tortured and killed. Someone, surely Granger, had done that stinging hex on Potter’s face - how could she have thought of that, in the same moment as their sanctuary was invaded? Merlin. There was being intellectually quick-witted, and then there was having nerves of steel.
“Mr Malfoy, thank you very much.” Madam Pomfrey was practically beaming at him. “This will let me do more than just the minimum. I’ll be able to take some pressure off St Mungo’s. I must go write and tell the Head Nurse…”
Potter gave him a relieved smile as he jumped out of his seat. “Okay. I’ll be back to tidy up - like I said - er, yeah.” He was already backing out of the tent as he spoke, and stumbled as he turned away.
No, Gods, no, he couldn’t do that, not here. With a huge effort, he prevented himself from moving any further forward. It felt a bit like the times when he had tried not to say what the spell wanted him to explain to Potter - like a pressure, building behind his eyes and tongue, and he knew that in moments it wouldn’t be possible to resist -
“Of course I am, Potter. I don’t want to turn down the chance to reciprocate on doing you a favour.”
“Hold on a minute, then.” And Potter was up and in the bedroom, kneeling over by the drawer beneath the bunk, muttering a spell. A moment later he held up his handiwork for Draco to see. The sweatshirt was now a midnight black.
Draco shook his head, a little shocked. He’d had no idea about any of that. He had never thought to think about how any part of his body actually worked. He supposed that if he’d thought about it, he would have said it was magic. But that was idiotic; muggles existed, and
Potter covered his whole face with his hand and shuddered, his sobs becoming louder and less controlled. It didn’t last very long, though. Within two minutes, Potter had got his feelings under wraps again. It seemed that Potter wasn’t used to letting go, even with alcohol loosening his inhibitions.
Draco took them from the man and arranged them between his legs. The man closed the car door, causing Draco to startle yet again, and walked around the car to his own side, which had a lot of complicated-looking dials and wheels and levers.
, at least he had some breathing room… but not enough. Draco thought back to his father’s arrest at the end of fifth year. The Dark Lord had broken his father and the other Death Eaters out of Azkaban again before there had been time for the hearings to start, but before that, the Malfoy solicitors had warned Draco and his mother that the trial could last for months. And now that the war was over, there would be dozens of cases to try. Would that make the process faster or slower? Would they rush all the Death Eaters through, or would they leave some of them waiting years? Either way, Draco doubted he’d be front of the queue. They’d want to try the most serious offenders first, that’s what the public would demand, and Draco had never killed anyone. Thank Merlin.
They sat in silence for a moment. Despite the vulnerability making his skin feel itchy, Draco was surprised to find that sitting here talking with Potter was a lot easier than he would have expected. He didn’t think Potter was going to call the Aurors over, and Draco was almost sure that Potter had decided this consciously and not just failed to realise the implications of Draco’s disadvantage.
The stairs were a new challenge with the crutches, but they weren’t too hard. He was breathing hard by the time he reached the top, though.
Draco slowly opened his eyes. His eyelids felt heavy and gritty, and Draco recognised the fogginess in his head as an after-effect of Dreamless Sleep. He blinked, gradually surfacing.
Risking a quick glance, Draco saw Potter looking down into his lap where he held the whiskey tumbler. It was pretty clear that he was trying not to cry.
She reached out hesitantly and drew a hand above the line of buttons on Draco’s shirt. They neatly undid themselves and his shirt folded back from his chest. She made short work of his bruises, laying her cool fingers on each in turn until they faded to nothing.
“I still should be getting punished worse than I am, though. I’ve got out of having a proper trial, of serving time in Azkaban. I - I would have faced it, Potter, I
“Oh, right.” Potter walked away, and came back shortly with Madam Pomfrey, who was holding a pair of wooden crutches much like the ones Draco had made for himself. She measured them against him and cast a quick Elongation Charm to make them the right size.
“Prudy is feeling fine now, Master Draco, the Matron is healing Prudy very well - but Master Draco is not fine! Master Draco is hurt, Mr Potter is saying the poltergeist is throwing huge rocks at Master Draco!”
Draco scooped a hand under the tiny whirlpool and raised it up to hover closer in front of his face. He imagined what he wanted, putting as much detail into the image as he could manage. It seemed a little more difficult than when he’d formed the cobra, possibly because he didn’t have much water to work with, but still the water immediately stopped spinning and reshaped into the shape of a broomstick - with a tiny Potter riding on top of it. You couldn’t really tell it was Potter, of course, the face was too smooth, but there was an indication of quidditch robes.
Potter brought his wand out and flicked it a few times, spelling the plates clean and then back into the cupboard, and vanishing the empty takeaway boxes. There was, once again, enough rice left over for Draco to eat it in the morning.
“What do you mean?” Then Draco remembered. “She said you owed her a life-debt, but… I can’t imagine how she would have…”
Myrtle was halfway through a rather bloodthirsty story of taking vengeance on her former childhood nemesis, when
Potter looked down, scuffing his foot along the floor. Then he gave a tight shrug. “What happened, happened. I just have to - have to accept that.” He looked up and gave Draco a nod. “See you tomorrow, Malfoy.” He turned and left.
Draco looked wildly around the Hollow, trying to see if there was any other way to prevent the imminent disaster. His gaze skated over a cluster of familiar people standing a little further along from Hagrid, and instantly everything got worse.
With a smirk of triumph Draco set it loose, sending the model to fly over and circle round the real Potter’s head, dive-bombing his face in a flawless Wronski feint before pulling up and hovering at Potter’s eye-level so that he could take a closer look.
, and he hadn’t had Potter look at him like that since sixth year. It was ludicrously comforting to see it again.
Draco spared a moment to feel grateful that this man was clearly restraining his curiosity about why Draco didn’t know how to use a seatbelt, but the next moment he was once again occupied by the terror of the car moving out into the new, busy road. By some miracle the driver avoided all of the other hulking metal machines, and it was less alarming once they were in line with the others, all moving the same way, but still, the cars on the other side passed them by mere inches. The muggle man seemed to notice Draco’s death-grip on the seat beneath him and once again proved his worth by not attempting to speak to Draco for the rest of the journey.
Madam Pomfrey’s stern manner cracked slightly. “Mr Malfoy, I can assure you that you are safe here. The Bloody Baron is not going to leave your side. But of course, I do not blame you for feeling jumpy. I have been a matron for a long time, and I thought that after seeing a literal battle take place within the school walls that nothing could shock me any more - but for that poltergeist to have - to have actually
Every move cautious and calculated, Draco successfully negotiated the shower rim and getting towelled off. He wished he had his wand for a quick drying charm. He contemplated his stinking clothes and curled his lip. He wished for his wand again so that he could banish the ruined clothes, but instead he just left them where they were and grabbed his shoes, swinging himself naked along the corridor, into his room, and over to his trunk on one crutch.
Potter’s mouth twisted in disdain but he backed up a step, indicating to the others to do the same. Draco was not surprised to see the two Aurors obeying Potter instinctively.
Draco’s chest still felt warm with anger. He wasn’t sure what he was about to say; indeed, he was quite tempted to tell the Ministry to go fuck themselves. He opened his mouth and let the spell lead him. “To an extent, yes. Provided they didn’t want me to turn on my parents, or put myself in danger, or bankrupt the estate, or distract me too much from completing the tasks for the Path. Also they would need to treat me with a modicum of respect. I know it’s more than I deserve as a - a Death Eater, but I am not a generous fool and I won’t do favours for people who treat me like dirt.”
“Harry - ideally yes, of course; but this is a rare opportunity to gain the full cooperation of a Death Eater. Lord Malfoy’s help could prove invaluable.”
“I - I appreciate the offer, Prudy, but I’m not sure it would be wise to just leave. The Aurors would be quite annoyed to have to come and get me again.”
Potter summoned a couple of tumblers from the cupboard and, after wrestling with the bottle for a moment, poured them both a generous measure.
Draco flinched back even further, and Weasley shoved him off in disgust. Draco groped for the wall, hardly seeing it through the swirling grey dust, and sank down against it, until he was sat in a ball, pressing his side hard against the ancient wallpaper. His breaths were quick, shallow gasps that rasped in his throat. And the spell wanted him to start talking.
His father held the knife in his left hand, so he could press the blade into the meat of his right palm, under the table. Not even a flicker of discomfort marred his father’s impassive expression as blood started to trickle down his fingers from the deep gash in his hand.
Madam Pomfrey’s lips twitched. “Fortunately, physiotherapy is not the same as surgery. And they don’t just cut people open while a patient can feel it, by the way. The muggles have some very clever techniques for blocking pain.”
He knew his voice sounded rough with emotion, but he felt too warm to mind. He looked over at Potter and didn’t even try to stop himself from beaming. “Thanks for telling me, Potter. It means a lot. Obviously.”
a twelve-year-old took out a basilisk. I was in no way justified in being sceptical about that.” He rolled his eyes. “And the spell wants me to tell you that was sarcasm, in case you couldn’t guess. Fuck. I can’t even be sarcastic.”
Potter nodded, clearly still uncomfortable. “I’ll, er - I just need to show Malfoy the tent and then we can get started.”
Draco heaved an involuntary sigh of relief, his eyes fluttering shut as he allowed himself to sink back onto the bed. It wasn’t him, it wasn’t Peeves, they were not about to die. He tried to will away the sick waves of adrenaline as they curdled in his bloodstream.
“You’ll be staying here until the new Fidelius charm is done. It’s safer for now. I’ve done all the spells and wards we used while we were on the run. It got a bit trashed by the Snatchers and I only just went to fetch it this morning, so it’s a mess. You can start cleaning it up while Bill and I check the house over.” Without even waiting for an acknowledgement, Potter strode back towards the tree. Draco watched as a slight shimmer indicated the moment Potter had stepped through the wards.
Lestrange knelt down over him, and Draco felt spittle land on his face as his uncle continued in a much angrier tone. “Well, it’s all gone to
Potter looked at him for a moment. “Right. I’m making you a cup of tea.” He turned around to the ruined kitchenette and sighed. “This may take a little longer than normal.”
He didn’t see Goyle. He did see his cousin, Nymphadora Tonks, and her werewolf husband. He felt a stronger clench of sadness for this Tonks, someone he had never and, now, would never meet, than he did for his own aunt Bellatrix.
The old, familiar rage sprang to life in Potter’s face. Malfoy recognised it intimately, felt a moment of satisfaction at having elicited it, and then remembered his vision and felt sick with himself.
Draco’s stomach twisted in disgust. He was no stranger to saving his own skin, but turning on his own father?
“Not really, Potter, I wish I didn’t need your help.” Draco sighed and took it anyway. Potter braced and easily took his weight, which was a good thing as Draco had to rely on him rather a lot to get up using only one leg and one crutch.
He kept almost doing a double-take at the sight of Potter. He’d been gone for so long, become a myth. Having Harry Potter sitting in front of him - on a green velvet armchair in the middle of the Slytherin common room, no less - was surreal.
“Of course, Madam Pomfrey. Thank you, Lord Malfoy. I believe what you have told us will save some lives, and finish the last of this war that much sooner. I may call upon you in the future with more questions, if you are willing.”
so I’d be ready to use it on Dumbledore. Fuck.” He couldn’t stop his voice from breaking, the words thickening with tears, and he
be that thick, Potter.” The spell immediately rebelled. “All right, what I actually mean is that it seems completely obvious to me. It’s the damn Mark, I don’t want anyone looking at it.”
Potter gave him a look that was almost sympathetic as he put Draco’s wand back into his pouch. Draco exhaled sharply, clenching his fists against the irrational surge of disappointment. Of
Draco nodded, letting himself relax a fraction. They were probably still in cells just down the hall somewhere, but he knew Potter wouldn’t confirm that.
Once he was clean, he leant back against the wall, trying to take some of the weight off his right leg. He regarded the stream of water speculatively. Reaching a hand out, he tried to access the Old Magic like he had with the wood, by imagining what he wanted the water to do -
Draco whipped his head up. Potter was drawing his wand, and he looked serious. He stood up and extended his empty hand towards Draco, eyebrows raised in challenge.
Potter took a large step towards the tent entrance, then buckled, one hand going to his head and one to his mouth. He turned abruptly and ran in crouching steps to the tiny bathroom. Draco heard the ugly sounds of retching and his own stomach tightened in disgust. Draco took a few deep breaths to keep himself under control. Rusty as he was, he still had more practice than Potter at dealing with a hangover, and there was only one loo.
For the next two hours Shacklebolt and Draco discussed every Death Eater not yet dead or captured, followed by everything Draco knew about the location and defences of various Death Eater safe-houses, as well as Malfoy Manor and what traps may have been set there. McGonagall took her leave immediately and Madam Pomfrey soon left them to it, coming over now and again to bring Draco a drink of water that he had to sip through a straw, or silently cast some diagnostic spell over him. Potter listened avidly to every detail of the conversation, but did not once ask Draco anything, although he obviously wanted to several times. He had not known Potter was capable of such restraint, and felt surprised that Potter bothered to spend the effort summoning it for
“Death has taken our loved ones, but he will not take their stories from us. Let us share those stories now, so all may know how their lives touched ours.”
The cane tore chunks of moss as he limped along. Draco’s leg was really starting to burn as he passed beyond the point where his ancestors had started having portraits painted. The oak trees were becoming larger and older with every step. He gritted his teeth; there was still just as far to go again.
“I didn’t want this, oh God, I didn’t want this, I didn’t want to take his parents away, not so soon… oh Merlin, he didn’t even have one whole fucking month with them, even I had a
Hands were tugging gently at Draco’s arms. He cringed away; at this moment he couldn’t even handle breathing, and now Potter wanted him to cope with more sensations? With interaction? With
By some miracle, or some hasty castle repairs, the showers still had running water. It was even warm. Draco laughed and praised the Gods for the fantastic sensation of sloughing off all the dirt of the past few days. The water winding towards the drain was grey with ash. As Draco reached for Goyle’s hair potion (his own phial was always in the prefect’s bathroom) it could have been a normal school day, except that a mess of bruises were blooming across his body and his right leg felt wobbly from the strain of keeping him upright on the treacherous, slippery tiles.
He turned back hastily, and Potter caught his eye. Draco’s shoulders rose as he braced for the confession he would have to give. But Potter carefully didn’t ask, didn’t even look curious, and Draco relaxed as he felt no urge to start talking.
from a wood-elf and a water-spirit, which is supposed to be a secret, by the way. That’s where the bark came from - my family tree.”
He sucked in a shuddering breath as he was finally permitted to fall silent. He kept his eyes closed and wiped the tears away angrily. With an enormous effort, he forced himself to calm his breathing and open his eyes. He would
Draco nodded and turned to his right. Several shiny black arm chairs were arranged with perpendicular precision around a very square, glass coffee table. There were a couple of wide windows looking back out onto the street, and two handsome wooden bookcases filled with various muggle medical texts set into the far wall.
Draco’s stomach suddenly felt cold. “The Manor was not a place where I could let my guard down, Potter. A summons could come at any time.” Unbidden, his right hand came up to rub at the sleeve covering his bandaged left forearm.
The wood immediately became insubstantial, like swirling smoke somehow taking the shape and colour of a door. Draco awkwardly hopped forward, keeping his left arm raised, followed closely by the Weasley and Potter nearly tripping on his heels.
your fault. You were coerced. I don’t think it counts if you used Unforgivables under threat of an Unforgivable yourself. That’s all on Tom.”
He felt much shakier now that he had admitted it out loud. It was so horribly weak to be ruled by his fear like this. And to have to tell someone on top of that, and for it to be Potter, of all people, who had faced the Dark Lord not five days ago…
Draco urgently brought his finger to his lips, flicking his eyes between her and the ghost floating above them.
“Yes. That’s right. I’m afraid that is the reality that I am here to help you face, Mr Malfoy: there is no complete, nor instant, fix to this problem. I don’t believe in sugar-coating things like this, it doesn’t help. You have a disability now. That means your abilities are more restricted than they used to be.”
Potter huffed a breath and bit his lip. His eyes darted from the ground, to the tent wall, to Bill’s face. “Er - yeah. Yeah.” His voice sounded a bit husky.
Draco had just registered the shape of a dim hallway as some gas-lights flickered into life, when an angry and vaguely familiar voice growled, “Severus Snape?”
She continued moving her hands above Draco’s skin in small deliberate circles, and despite the fact that she wasn’t touching him, Draco could feel her magic tingling across his chest where she passed. It felt soothing, and he realised that she was helping to dispel the deep ache that the old magic had left clinging to his bones.
“The Fiendfyre. A griffin got a bite out of the back of my left calf while I was climbing those desks.” Draco reached down and pulled aside the tatters of his left trouser leg, and Potter leaned in almost reluctantly to look. He winced.
Draco sniffed, pretending to look offended. “Yes I did, Potter, and we both know that’s because I’m a clueless, aristocratic prat.”
Draco reached for his glass of water, which was still a third full. He passed his palm over the top of the glass and then turned his hand upwards and closed his fingers, as if he had taken a handful of air. He pulled upwards and the water rose obediently out of the glass, floating in a loose ball. Draco opened his hand and began to circle the water with a finger. The water started turning, getting faster and faster until it had formed into a tiny miniature whirlpool, spinning like a top.
Potter jumped up from the armchair and started pacing in front of one of the fireplaces. Draco felt a disorienting surge of bitter envy that he could no longer do the same thing.
Potter cleared his throat. “Looks like Tom added his own little something to the security. Only someone with the Dark Mark can get through the doorway.”
He rubbed his eyes, then rolled over and felt under the bed for his pocket watch. Some bleary squinting later, he determined that it was quarter past eleven.
Walking with the crutches was easy, but everything else required a lot more thought than normal. He nearly fell over when he started taking off his clothes, and hopping over the tiled rim at the base of the shower cubicle was awkward. He leaned the crutches against the wall outside the cubicle, then steadied himself with his hands as he balanced on one leg inside.
Prudy shuddered once, but she gradually uncurled herself until she could peek out at them both. Her eyes were scrunched up and red as if the light hurt her. Draco’s heart clenched, and he could feel tears prickling again as he spoke.
Anne Liston seemed to be able to read a lot of what he was feeling on his face, which was embarrassing. He wasn’t acting like a Malfoy at all, today.
“Madam Pomfrey - please… could you help me cover this up?” He kept his gaze trained on a vaulted corner of the ceiling.
Draco let out a slow, silent breath of relief through his nose. He never let his glare falter for an instant, even though Potter’s own eyes (always a brighter green than he remembered) were much more piercing from a distance of barely two feet away.
He grabbed up the crutches from the floor by the bed and made himself stand upright. His bad leg twinged but mercifully didn’t cramp.
Potter laughed, a trace of bitterness in his tone. “I don’t really either. And I’ve been thinking about it for most of this year.”
Draco fought the urge to squirm under her gaze. He had a nasty feeling he had just made a serious faux-pas.
Potter came in, followed by Weasley. Weasley looked around with his eyebrows raised. “They gave this place a right going-over, didn’t they? Hey, this is old Perkins’ tent - I gave you another, Harry, why are you still using this one?”
“Oh, come on! Freshening charm, Stomach Settler, Sobriety Hex? Everyone in Hogwarts knows them by the end of fourth year!”
He could sit down, he supposed, but what if a crutch slipped from beneath the cloak? And what if he needed to move away quickly? It would take him far too long to get up again.
Potter turned away abruptly. Draco flinched, but relaxed slightly when Potter threw a parting remark back over his shoulder.
He managed to operate the simple red button to release his seatbelt, and he even figured out how to pull on the metal handle to open the door, but getting up and out onto the pavement was intimidating.
he could have changed its eye-watering colour into something halfway acceptable, but as it was, no. With a sigh, he reached into his school trunk and unearthed his least-elaborate summer cloak, a light, plain grey with a tasteful green trim at the very edges. He would probably look odd to the muggles, but even though it was a warm day, it was still Britain, and he wasn’t taking the risk of going anywhere in just this thin T-shirt without being able to cast an
“I’ll be careful,” said Potter. Draco wanted to make a snide comment about the likelihood of caution and Harry Potter ever being found within sight of each other, but stopped himself.
He sat up straighter and took pleasure in dipping his quill in the ink, tapping it deftly on the side of the glass to clear the excess. In the top right corner he wrote the date - it took him a moment to figure it out - and in the top left, his name, so the professor would know whose work it was. Then, neatly, in the top centre, he wrote the title:
Draco sagged onto the bed, struggling to calm down. It wasn’t his uncle, of course not. The relief was strong enough to flatten the alarm of finding himself once again at wandpoint. After all, he knew that the Aurors couldn’t do anything to him.
“He’s the one who Greyback injured, when I - when I - when I let the other Death Eaters into the castle. I… don’t know why I’m not kneeling on the ground right now begging for forgiveness.”
Professor - no, Headmistress - McGonagall stepped into Draco’s field of vision near the foot of his bed, followed by a tall, bald, black guy, who was presumably Shacklebolt. His undeniable presence made it seem as though he had been Minister for Magic for years rather than a few days. Draco slipped the twig under his covers and wished very much that he could sit upright to face them.
So they both sat in silence for a good while, making it through another couple of fingers each. They appeared quite well-matched in drinking speed, although judging by the flush beginning to rise up Potter’s face, Draco easily took the lead in holding his alcohol.
“Oh, well. No-one’s asked about the murder tree, I think maybe they assumed that Malfoy Manor is just like that. But I said that you used accidental magic to make that lattice-shield. They seemed to buy it?”
Potter laughed. Draco could feel himself blushing and he glared at the ceiling. He had thought the task ‘Explain yourself’ was non-lethal, but he’d likely die of embarrassment well before it was over.
After the post had delivered the second crutch, it twisted itself back into its old carved spiral shape, looking almost smug. The only difference now was that it had lost its dark varnish, and two knot marks indicated where it had grown the crutches.
The tent flap opened behind him. Draco started and pulled off yet another fast turn on his crutches.
Draco’s first instinct was to look at his inner left forearm, hoping that the Dark Mark had disappeared, but it was the same as ever. Now that the Dark Lord was gone, perhaps it would fade over time… And at least it would never burn again.
“Oh, there you are.” Potter set down a bag he’d been carrying on the dining table - the bag was made of that weird Muggle stuff, was it called plistac? - and dragged an ugly armchair to the centre of the tent to sit near the bed. He groaned in obvious pleasure at getting off his feet. “House is fine, thanks. Took all afternoon, but Bill checked every room over thoroughly and he’s satisfied he’s disabled all the traps. It’s still absolutely full of dark objects, of course, but it always was. I think the Death Eaters did me a favour by looting some of it, but actually there’s a lot less damage than I expected. We figured maybe your aunt had a thing about preserving her family’s heirlooms?”
He could have kept playing with the water for a lot longer, but the stream from the shower was becoming rapidly cooler and his right leg was getting quite uncomfortable. Reluctantly, he let his hand drop and the water snake in front of him immediately lost its form, splashing to the ground.
The next few minutes were spent in awkward silence, eating the delicious, spicy, greasy food. Draco was glad to see a bit of colour coming back into Potter’s pale, brown cheeks as they finished off the last of the chicken korma.
The hospital wing was on the far side of the castle, on the first floor. He turned right and started back along towards the cells, trying to place his crutches quietly onto the stone. Before he got to the corner that would put him in sight of the Auror on guard duty, he turned off into a corridor on the left, which led to some stairs up to ground-level.
Draco hadn’t heard his father sound so calm in a long time. Despite his stringy silver hair and puffy, bruised eye he had an air of authority. Draco ached to see it.
However, three weeks was a paltry amount of time. He couldn’t just wait for the hearings to come along. He’d had some half-formed idea of pleading to the court, of weaving a piteous tale of a terrified and coerced child, all while being a model convict, meekness personified. But he didn’t have time for any of that. He’d have to throw his political weight around - ha, what political weight? No. He’d have to do as his father had suggested. He’d have to sell everyone else out, as quickly and thoroughly as possible, even though he would most certainly be making his father’s situation significantly worse. Draco swallowed, feeling ill. Then he took a deep breath and forced himself to accept his father’s logic. His father was already going to Azkaban for decades at least - what was the difference, really, between thirty years and life without parole?
“There we go, nothing to it.” The man was beaming at him from a bare metre away in the sunlight. Draco couldn’t help but give him a small smile in return, which seemed to please the man immensely. Draco realised how lucky he’d been to get such a nice muggle as his driver. Just as the man turned to go, Draco managed to get his voice to work.
Draco took a breath and was surprised by how much less tight his chest felt. “Okay, good. Let’s go, then.”
He jerked his gaze down towards his body as movement caught his eye. Standing with her hands hovering, palms downwards, above his bare chest, was the oldest house-elf that Draco had ever seen.
The spell did not let him hesitate. He was almost grateful that it was taking control, because he personally felt paralysed. He got himself into a kneeling position, a corner of the invisibility cloak getting caught under his leg and almost making him fall. He tore the cloak from over his head. There might have been shouts, even some screams, but all he could do was crane his neck - he had to meet their eyes - there, not so hard to get their attention when everyone was already staring at him, first Hagrid, then Longbottom, Granger and Weasley -
“Mm.” nodded Draco, his eyes travelling around the pitch, finally resting on the messy black hair of Potter, he knew why he’d sought him out immediately - the world and it’s chronic unfairness
"Mum!" another child screamed, bouncing up and down at a shop window. "Look, look!" The small boy looked no older than twelve, bright eyes and an expressive face. 'Wait til you get to my age,' Draco thought, a slight smirk gracing his lips. 'You'll have absolutely nothing to be excited about, you heathen.' "Oh that's lovely dear, do you want one?" The child, who now looked like he was fit to burst, nodded enthusiastically and ran through the doors of the shop. Draco raised an eyebrow. Nothing interesting.
Unspeakable Wilson had taken the perp in question to an interrogation room immediately, accompanied by Unspeakable Zabini who’d scowled at Lavender as he entered. Lavender didn’t like Zabini much - she’d spoken to him maybe two times and it was usually at Dean and Seamus’ annual reunion. The man seemed pompous and irritating at the best of times, something she didn’t care for.
Seamus could feel his heart hammering in his chest, adrenaline kicking in. He had no idea how they were going to get out of this one. From the distance he could already see at least six of the Celtic Serpents gaining. He shook his head in dismay.
Draco stood up and wandered over to him, looking at the offending article. He laughed. “That’s Granger's handwriting, I’d recognise it anywhere.” Harry nodded. “How is it you’re so good at that?” asked Harry, he tapped a finger against the side of his head, thinking for a moment before he turned his head to the other man. “There’s been a string of crop circles around England, mostly beside forests.” Harry said lamely.
“Draco!” Harry shouted, running as fast as he could to his partner. Harry had been in an intense discussion with Lavender about her findings when his wristwatch went off, he’d walked out to an empty room. Not even Endelton or Henderson were present. He’d found a report on Seamus’ desk and tried to apparate to the coordinates. When it rebounded, himself and Lavender had been looking up maps to find areas nearby they could apparate to.
“How far have you gotten?” he asked, turning to face Draco who looked about neck deep in parchment at this point. “Well we can rule out that the sticky note and the report filed yesterday were not done by Lockwood, so either he changed his writing habits, masked it or we have someone else working for the Celtic Serpent within the department.” he sighed. Draco looked frazzled, it was only early in the day too. Harry sighed. “Do you want some coffee?” he asked, a pained smile on his face. Draco nodded, returning the smile. “Please.”
The door to their office swung open and in entered Henderson, looking somewhat frazzled. “Sir,” she greeted, nodding her head towards Harry who’d turned to frown at the woman. He hadn’t expected that they’d get clean up done this quickly but after a glance at the clock he realised he’d been sitting there wallowing for close to four hours, no wonder Draco had been worried.
“Sure,” he finally said, wandering over to the television. Pressing the large button, Draco chewed his lower lip as he flicked through the different channels, resting on a movie he found familiar. “Oh, it’s Alice in Wonderland!” he exclaimed. Draco was always happy when he got something muggle right, Louisa called it an ‘endearing trait’ which he’d always assumed was code for you’re a bit of a plonker, aren’t you?
“It’s what, Potter?” Draco sighed, picking up his cup and saucer, he made no effort to wait for Potter once again, before exiting the Cafe to sit at his usual spot outside for another daily dose of people watching. Potter quickly sat down beside him however, a deep frown marring his forehead.
“Hey can I get a delivery please?” Harry asked in to the white, rectangular phone in his left hand, held up to his ear. Draco really didn’t get along with Muggle technology all that well, when Harry had insisted he order the last Chinese takeaway Draco had spent that much time figuring out how to use the bloody thing the other man had gotten frustrated and just did it himself, which caused an argument that lasted until the guy knocked on their door with food.
“S-She, well, my father was, he was put in Azkaban, my mother, she hated the Manor so she bought a cottage and I was helping her plant some flowers, but because nobody really likes us anymore, with us being well, you know,” he said awkwardly, the discomfort was evident on Draco’s face, he shifted uncomfortably in his seat, knocking against Potter. “I-I she has some health issues, so I’ve been brewing her potions, and I-I read.”
It had been six hours since Draco was admitted to St Mungos. Harry had paced up and down the corridor, consumed more coffee from the lackluster vending machine than he should’ve and had several visits from different people. The first being Lavender who’d come straight to the hospital from the Ministry.
“Why do they always have to choose the creepiest places?” moaned Harry, running a hand through his wild hair. Draco raised an eyebrow. “Oh yes, Potter, they’re going to operate in the middle of a beautiful meadow filled with butterflies, rainbows and the occasional fluffy Crup,” Draco said sarcastically, rolling his eyes.
When their reports were filed and everyone had cleared off, Harry held out his hand for Draco, who blushed lightly. “Chinese, tea, bed.” he smiled. Draco took his hand and smiled in return, before Harry side-alonged the two of them into the middle of their living room.
“Oh yes, because we don’t read articles about the tosser every bloody week, or his party antics?” Draco said, rolling his eyes. “I know how many blokes he shags, he’s probably got more crabs than Christmas Island.” Draco scrunched his face up. It wasn’t that he was a prude, Harry Potter was
“Did you find anywhere suitable yet?” asked Draco, who’d now walked over to his desk. He’d left all the Celtic Serpent cases to the top left of his desk in a neat pile, ready for transporting to whatever facility Harry chose as their base. He received a grunt in response, but didn’t press.
He could feel Potter shifting around behind him, the only thing Draco heard after was the rapid beating of his heart.
“Sir, I have a memo here from Kingsley.” Endelton smiled, handing the piece of parchment over to Harry, who smiled in return. He began to scan the file in front of him, a frown appearing. After, he looked to Draco and nodded towards their office, thanking Endelton.
Lockwood didn’t stifle his laugh this time, he went into a full on laughing fit, enough so he started to cough. Hermione could hear the man was dehydrated, his throat sounded croaky and painful as he did so.
I know that but today mother turned up at Grimmauld with a crib! Apparently it was mine when I was a baby, she said “Any Malfoy deserves to sleep in this, it’s a family heirloom you know!” As if I didn’t already know that, considering I’m sure even
Once he’d arrived outside Kingsley’s office, he looked to the left and noticed Lavender talking to Henderson, he hadn’t realised they were friends. “Jean, do you fancy going for a drink after?” Lavender asked casually, leaning against the wall. Her hair was covering the side of her face that was scarred, though it didn’t seem to be off putting to Henderson, who smiled. “Yeah, I’d love to.”
Don’t be so worried Harry, I know exactly what is in Wolfsbane. Daphne has agreed if I find myself pregnant she would handle the more dangerous ingredients as I did when she and Theo had Odette. Although she’s a pain in all of our arses as well as being a greedy bitch I don’t half love her.
her the proof, but as fate had it, Louisa’s older sister Bethany was a muggleborn witch, it was evident she loved her sister with her whole heart, Draco sometimes wondered what it would be like to have a sibling, or maybe someone who loved him as much as Louisa loved Bethany.
He didn’t really eat a lot these days, but he did enjoy the occasional food binge now and again. The last time he’d done it he’d gotten a sugar rush so intense it took three hours to come down, Bethany had never stopped laughing the entire time. They’d decided to watch Willy Wonka and Louisa stated you could
A glimpse of green light had Harry immediately draw his wand from it’s holster, alerting the other two who followed suit quickly after. “Did you see that?” Harry whispered, inching closer to Draco who nodded. “Seamus, left - I’ll go in first, Draco to the right.” they all nodded in unison and Harry began walking forwards, quickly disappearing through the trees. Seamus walked off to the left and crouched down, eyes scanning the forest floor. He began casting for spell traces again, his eyes landing on a steady flow of magic leading further into the forest. He inwardly groaned as he stood up, quietly walking in to the forest clearing.
Draco cringed and sat down after Harry had taken the cup and began to sip. “Scruff.” Draco chided, shaking his head. Harry just grinned goofily at him and shrugged his shoulders. After they’d finished the pizzas, Draco scoffed down the cookies and groaned, rubbing his stomach. “You always do that, eat the bloody cookies and feel like shite after.”
What he didn't expect to see though, was Harry Potter stalking around a street corner with quite a lot of concentration and intent etched onto his features. He'd bulked up a lot, his muscles now more noticeably defined through the tight black v-neck t-shirt. He was also wearing a pair of extremely tight black jeans and some beat up looking trainers. 'He'd look smart if it wasn't for those trainers,' Draco thought.
Draco shrugged his shoulders, his hands gripping the steering wheel hard enough to turn his knuckles white. “Probably not,” sighed, up ahead a roundabout sign posted for Edinburgh North stood at the side of the road, he turned his indicator on and waited for the traffic to clear. “I haven’t seen him for a long time” he admitted.
“Yeah, so? That’s 10 galleons that is one hundred percent mine.” he grinned. Nobody could take this moment away from him. Dean turned his attention to Lockwood, who Endelton had bound with an Incarcerous. “Good work Josh.” he said, nodding his head. Endelton wasn’t his cup of tea, the man was just far too irritating for Dean’s taste and that was saying something.
“Sounds like a horror movie.” mumbled Seamus, who looked a little green at the prospect of a scary cabin being in the middle of the forest. “Oh god, I hated that movie.” Draco moaned, shaking his head. Himself and Harry had rented a dvd from a nearby muggle video store called “The Cabin in the Woods” which scared Draco half to death, Harry on the other hand had laughed at his reaction and stated all horror movies were essentially the same plot. Draco was having absolutely none of it at the time though.
After they’d finished their cake, cleared up the place Harry had disappeared into the bathroom the soft sound of water trickling. Draco smiled. He entered his bedroom and quickly got changed to a smart black three piece dress robe. He was fixing his cufflinks when Harry entered his room, towel slung around his waist.
Draco nodded, he was so engrossed in reading he’d completely missed Harry’s question regarding handwriting, after he’d finished he jogged over to the filing cabinet beside the door and yanked it open, sifting through it in a very un-Draco-like way. “What’s up?” Harry asked, his eyes rested on the sticky note memo, he wondered if Draco could tell who wrote this particular piece of evidence.
“Hello.” Louisa said shyly, sitting down beside Weasley. “Alright?” Weasley smiled, he kept his gaze on Louisa for a little longer than necessary - before catching the glare from Draco. “Oh sorry, is this your girlfriend?” Weasley asked, his cheeks pinking.
“Well this was actually nice,” Potter commented as they exited the Hungry Horse, he shoved his hands into his robe pocket. It was funny, Potter wasn’t really getting that many odd looks for his choice in clothing, when Draco first wandered down the street in London wearing his robes they’d looked at him as if he wasn’t right in the head. Draco looked up at Potter thoughtfully for a moment, before nodding in agreement. It was true, it was unusually nice. Turning his head towards Louisa, who was completely engrossed in a conversation with Weasley once again.
Your poor owl, Draco. If bird’s faces could show shock or surprise then I think his would do so right now. Hercules knows that something had changed, lovely. He’s flapping about in a very agitated manner. As for me, I’m going to have a very strong coffee, tell Ron our fantastic news and then I’m going to compose you a real reply that isn’t just the inane, foolish ramblings of a wizard that has just been given the best news of his life.
) and if you were pregnant it could hurt you and the baby. As for Daphne: that greedy witch puts the average Niffler to shame with her love of gold and shiny gems. I have no idea how Theo puts up with her.
“I’m as surprised as you are.” came a voice from beside him, Harry turned his attention to the doorway, a small smile gracing his lips as his eyes rest on Lavender. “Hey, what are you doing here?” asked Harry, he began chewing on his lower lip. His immediate thoughts went to the Serpents they arrested, he began to frown. “Did something go wrong?”
“Ah, Potter.” Kingsley nodded, gesturing towards the empty chair beside Dean. Harry crossed the space of the office and quietly sat in the chair, resting both arms on the armrests. “Kingsley.” he greeted, nodding his head in return. Dean turned his head towards Harry and grimaced, Harry frowned. “What’s happened?” curious, Harry turned his attention back to the Minister, running a hand through his hair.
“Your face, it’s -” Harry trailed off when the witch behind the counter handed them two scalding cups of tea, Potter had specified he’d like quite a lot of milk, however she’d not listened clearly. Perhaps Draco had imagined Potter asking, he wasn’t quite sure where his brain had wandered off to.
After exchanging pleasantries, they checked out of the Premier Inn and made their way down the street towards a small Cafe named ‘Luxe’. Once inside, Draco took the window seat, Potter sitting down opposite him. At least when the man was beside him he didn’t have to constantly look at him, it seemed fate really intended to conspire with him. Louisa sat down next to Draco, opposite Weasley.
“Err, yeah, can I get the smoked chicken too?” he asked, biting his lip. A smile appeared on his face and he nodded, although nobody but Draco could see it. “Yeah, cheers mate, see you.” he said, before clicking the button on the phone and tossing it down gently to the end table at the side of their sofa.
Draco smiled sadly at Harry, he wrapped his fingers around Harry’s hand, which was still resting on his cheek and closed his eyes, leaning in to that touch. Draco was terrified, he knew he was a good Auror, he’d worked incredibly hard to get where he was. He’d done it all with Harry, who made him strong, brave and better. Draco often regretted the decision to avoid a Mind Healer, he’d announced to everyone he planned to do it himself. Neither him nor Harry had attended.
“I didn’t realise you bought into all that bullshit, Potter,” Draco said dryly, narrowing his eyes. It seemed logical really, Potter was just the right amount of nauseating idealistic buffoon for the sentiment. Harry shook his head in disbelief, he stared at Draco for an uncomfortable amount of time, causing the blond to shuffle around on the spot, as though he was on display. The dark haired man looked thoughtful, like he was trying to piece together the enigma that was Draco Malfoy, before turning his head back to Weasley. “Well, I suppose not.” he finally said, stepping forwards. “Better go Ron, we have an early match tomorrow.” he said. Taking that as his queue to leave, Draco moved towards Louisa, linking his arm through hers. “Hotel then drive home, I suppose.” he mumbled. Louisa nodded her head and waved goodbye to Potter and Weasley.
“Another day in the life as Head Auror.” Draco smirked, nudging Harry with his elbow as they walked. “Yeah, ‘Spose.”
“Right you are.” Seamus nodded, turning his head to Dean who smiled at him. Harry often wished he had the relationship they shared, he wondered sometimes when he was laying in bed if one day he would have that with Draco, but he was really too scared to make the first move. Their friendship was comfortable and he didn’t want to do anything to ruin that. Nodding, Harry wandered off back to his office, closing the door behind him. He needed to get the necessary paperwork duplicated and right before he headed down to the Department of Mysteries. Although he knew Hermione wouldn’t protest, Unspeakable Wilson drove him to his wits end.
Once the four of them had returned to the Ministry, Harry was immediately called in to a meeting with Kingsley. He was surprised to see Hermione and Unspeakable Wilson in attendance. Draco had been asked to attend also, Harry was sitting on the high back armchair, Draco perched on the arm of the chair. Ever since they’d witnessed the scene, Draco had never left his side. He’d even asked Harry if he needed the toilet, to which Harry immediately said yes - not because he actually needed the toilet but because Draco had never asked him this before, it was as if he already knew the blonde did not want to be alone.
“Oh yes, he’s very handsome,” she commented again, not taking her eyes off the billboard. Draco knew Louisa preferred redheads, but the thought never occurred to him she’d be attracted to Weasley. Draco wasn’t even sure Weasley was single, he knew he had broken up with Granger, who was now with Viktor Krum. It seemed Granger really had a thing for Quidditch players, it was certainly an awkward conversation when he’d asked Granger to send his apologies to Weasley, for as he so ineloquently put it ‘Bad shit I did wrong’.
Harry nodded and sighed. “I think we need to talk to Kingsley about this.” Draco could only agree. “I’ll be back soon.” he mumbled, before exiting the office leaving Harry to his thoughts.
For a moment, he could still hear the crackling of the fire, still see the orange glow - then, mercifully, his perception shifted and he realised that someone had lit a fire in the grate nearest to the sofa. He was lying on a thin rug, one of many placed over the stone floor of the Slytherin common room. It was completely dark outside and the fire was the only source of light.
Draco spent the rest of the day pottering (ha! Pottering) around the tent. He was at a bit at a loss, but on the other hand, it felt nice to have some space and time to himself with nothing to do. After his attack earlier, he didn’t feel capable of achieving much. He spent a while alphabetising the books that Potter had returned haphazardly to the shelf. He was slightly bemused by the range of topics Granger had seen fit to bring with her - everything from muggle survival guides, a complete set of crumbling potions references, Skeeter’s biography of Dumbledore, and, for some reason, a very old copy of
She pursed her lips. “I really do think this is the best option, Mr Malfoy. But if the physiotherapy fails to help and the pain interferes too much with your daily life, there is always the option of amputation below the knee, and replacement with a prosthetic. That is not something any Healer would do before exhausting all the alternatives, however.”
They didn’t speak all the way down the driveway to the gates. Just before he stepped out of them, Draco turned back and looked at the castle. He sucked in a breath. Hogwarts was visibly wrecked. The Great Hall and Entrance hall had already been repaired, and the grounds cleared of the most obvious debris, so he had actually forgotten that this was what he would see. The walls were blackened, pock-marked with impact craters, gaping open in places. Whole towers were missing. He had wanted to take one last look in case he could never return, but this wasn’t how he wanted to remember Hogwarts.
A few minutes later, someone from their left slid a piece of parchment and a quill and a bottle of ink towards them. Draco reluctantly let go of his mother’s hand to allow her to reach for them.
Potter’s eyes widened in understanding. William Weasley, however, raised an eyebrow, looking amused. “Oh, please, don’t let me stop you, Malfoy. I’ll treasure the memory. It’ll be a story to tell the grandkids, a Malfoy actually apologising.”
and Draco had been crushed in the corner near the door to the Entrance Hall, holding his breath with the rest of them as he attempted to follow each revelation.
“What? Oh, come on, Potter - it’s just a little cut and a few drops of blood, once a month. That’s all I have to do, and all I’m asking my descendants to do. Is that so much, for a chance at eternal life?”
Potter stormed past the tree and Draco realised that, somehow, in the next second, he had to stop him. If Potter got between him and the table then he could stop him getting to the mug of bark tea, and it would all be over. So he did the only thing he could do.
. Who gets rid of the Elder wand? If I’d known I was its master this year, you had better believe I’d have used it.”
, then, with the murderous tree growing in the middle of your kitchen? I thought that didn’t fit with the rest of the decor…”
He gingerly sat up, one hand holding the back of his head as if that might help stop his skull coming apart. He struggled for several moments to get his breathing under control. He was used to pain (he knew far too much about
By the time he reached the final tree at the back of the room, his wonder had been worn down by pain. He sat heavily with his back against the enormous, wizened trunk, gasping. After a minute of resting with his head back, he felt somewhat better, and opened his eyes.
“No. In fact, I am now officially embarrassed, Potter, because I have to tell you that I had never, until this very moment, even thought about what people in India might eat.”
“I see. Magic, I always forget. So the skin itself looks to be well-healed, although scarred. I presume it’s the loss of muscle which is causing problems?”
Frona nodded, satisfied. “Frona is doing what Frona can for your other wounds, but they is being cursed, Master Draco.”
He had seen pictures of the Hollow in his books as a boy, but for over twenty years the Hollow had famously hidden itself. Draco imagined teams of witches and wizards walking through this very same gap again and again, and finding only stubborn moorland to greet them.
Draco tucked the right crutch under his other arm and grabbed Potter’s left arm just above the elbow. Draco wondered if Potter felt as awkward about touching as he did. Probably, because Potter wasted no time before turning and dragging Draco into the darkness.
The whole thing was beginning to take on a nightmarish quality, heightened by the ethereal golden light. His chest was closing in like it did when he had a panic attack; he couldn’t catch his breath.
He allowed himself to let go of his legs and uncoil. The movement brought back all his previous aches and pains, especially in his leg and the back of his head.
Potter let go of his arm, hissed “Follow me,” and took off in the opposite direction. Draco turned and saw a particularly large boulder - Draco thought the correct word might be a tor - a handful of yards away, looming darkly in the sunlight.
The memories kept replaying in his mind; the images were so fresh and recent they didn’t even feel like memories yet. This morning, just a few hours ago, Harry Potter had stood
His chest felt empty after all that crying, and the toast was not very appealing. After a slice and a half, he gave up. His stomach was still too small to eat much anyway.
He scooted over to the armchair on his bum. He remembered the tray being delivered yesterday, but it was as if through a haze. When the house-elf came he had pulled himself tighter into a foetal position on the sofa and held his breath until they were gone, so that they wouldn’t hear him hyperventilating.
get to tell you what to do, no matter who you were. And she certainly seemed to know a fair amount about the human body. If she said he would be disabled for life, then he probably would be.
They drank the rest of their tea in silence. Draco didn’t feel cold any more, but he was reeling. He had recognised early in sixth year, of course, that his mother had been right: the Dark Lord had meant for him to die in attempting his task, as a punishment against his father. He knew how much of a fool he’d been for ever thinking it was anything else. He’d never considered that Dumbledore had been using him as well.
Draco snorted. “Well, it’s tasty, but I don’t know how people in India do it. I swear, that curry was trying to kill me.”
Potter’s voice was a bit weak, but Draco was delighted to have elicited this much interest from him. Perhaps Draco could return Potter’s kindness with inane, distracting babble.
Potter was standing by his bed, flanked by the same two Aurors who had been in Malfoy Manor. Both the Aurors had their wands out and pointed at him. The female one looked particularly stern.
"Who set off Fiendfyre, Harry?" Hermione panted as all three of them headed off together down another aisle. Harry wasn't sure it went back to the entrance, but it at least went away from the fire, which was still leaping up the mountains of objects as it pursued them, and formed disturbing shapes of snakes, dragons, and chimaeras as it devoured everything it touched.
Ginny shrugged. "Apparently some fourth-year girls were experimenting with wardrobe spells and he walked by when one of them misfired. Madam Pomfrey said the spell would just have to wear off on its own."
Ron gulped, turning to Harry with wide eyes, and Harry couldn't help but be slightly fearful of what his best mate was about to say.
Harry tried not to react to the name, but he couldn't help a shudder of fear. The Stinging Jinx wouldn't help him at all. Malfoy would know it was him, and all he needed to do to confirm it was touch him. Then his name would be fixed on Malfoy's wrist for all to see, and Harry had no doubts that Voldemort would be Summoned very quickly after that.
He grabbed his bag and scrambled out of the library, away from his friends who were making absolutely zero sense.
Draco’s mother said that snakes only understood people who spoke Parseltongue, but Draco was almost certain Ophis understood him most of the time. Right now, however, it didn’t seem like Ophis comprehended a single word, because he slithered off with a flick of his tail, probably to find another patch of sun somewhere.
He tugged his sleeve back down over his wrist as he went, although he knew it wouldn't make a difference. The same five letters — the same name — would still be there when he looked again later, unchanged.
His outfit (and everything he attempted to put on his body) immediately turned undeniably feminine. Draco's shirt now had a scalloped collar and delicate floral embroidery, his green tie had a paisley pattern, his pressed trousers had transformed into a knee-length pleated skirt, and best of all, his face cream had turned into a subtle, shimmering, silvery-green highlighter that accentuated his cheekbones perfectly. It was completely unfair, Pansy thought, because even in girly clothes, Draco still looked incredibly hot.
, and quite suddenly Harry was being thoroughly snogged. The rest of the night passed in a haze of kisses, and Harry didn't even mind Ron and Hermione's entirely too smug looks when they finally found him again.
“He’ll be the best father you’ve ever had!” Seeing as Draco had never known another father, it wasn’t a very high bar.
Draco slowly opened his eyes and looked down, only to see that the boy was not looking back up at him but was stroking his hippogriff as it napped in the grass. Draco relaxed a little bit. Now he could see that the boy had a defined, square jaw, full lips, and bright green eyes behind his spectacles – wait.
"Potter's not here," Draco said, when she emerged from the crowd around the bar with two glasses. "Was Blaise having me on?" He looked vaguely disappointed as he took a glass from her.
"Fine!" Pansy snapped, feeling her eye start to twitch. "I'll go down and bring you back dinner, but you owe me!"
,” his mother said, with an odd inflection that made Draco instantly suspicious. What had the Dark Lord been about to say?
Harry hesitated for a second, but he was worried about Ron and Hermione, wandering around somewhere in the Room and not knowing about the fire, which was spreading incredibly quickly. He turned to the stone bust and snatched the diadem off of its head, and then ran off down the twisted path between the piles, shouting for Ron and Hermione. Luckily it didn't take long before he heard them shouting his name, too, and then he practically bowled them over as he rounded another corner.
But there was no way out of it, at least not that Draco could think of. He was at their mercy, trapped in his tower with no one to—
"Yes, I know, Draco," Pansy said, turning to look at him with a smirk, "and I think I can work with it."
"That they're totally gay for each other?" Harry agreed, still not seeing where this was going. "Yeah, and they're together and happy now. What's your point, Ron?"
Harry's romance with Ginny had died as quickly as it had flamed into existence, and when he thought about the name that was going to appear on his wrist this morning, he almost dreaded it.
She tapped Draco's shoulder to pull his attention away, and half-yelled into his ear, "I'm going back to the bar, do you want anything?" He shook his head, and Pansy moved away, dropping her pretense of going to the bar, and hoping that finally those two idiots would get their act together.
"Just, y'know, I know you took losing Dobby the hardest out of all of us, but it seemed like… like, I dunno, something's bothering you?"
alone. He did have his pet snake for company, but Ophis could leave the tower anytime he wished to go hunt for food, slithering up and down the tower walls as he pleased. And Ophis couldn’t talk to him, so he hardly counted.
"So, uh," Ron started promisingly, "you know how Dean and Seamus were? And we could always kinda tell, y'know?"
"My mother's," Malfoy said conversationally. "It's not particularly cooperative, but I'm making do."
"No," Harry said, the word dragging itself out of his mouth slowly. He was abruptly grateful that his shirt sleeves were long.
Draco tried not to shiver beneath the Dark Lord’s full gaze. He hadn’t asked a question, but Draco was sure he was supposed to say
"Hear what?" Harry asked, speaking on behalf of everyone else within earshot. Seamus looked left and right, ensuring he had everyone's attention before leaning forward to spill the tea.
"I must have dropped it!" Harry cried in horror. It was probably while he was distracted by Malfoy's hands in his jumper, he decided, not that he was going to tell Hermione that, but Hermione was smiling.
Draco being himself, of course, he'd whinged about his clothes up until the moment before they entered the Great Hall for breakfast the next morning, at which point he seemed to decide that he was just going to own it. He straightened up and walked in like it was one of those Muggle fashion events. He made a beeline for the Slytherin table, too caught up in his aloof act to notice the rest of the student population's reaction, but Pansy was not.
And then Lestrange had swung one leg over him, was straddling him, pinning him down, grinding their groins together. Lestrange’s hand had moved up to Draco’s hair, yanking his head backwards, jamming a wand into his exposed neck. Draco whimpered, hating himself for his weakness. Helplessness coiled with disgust in his stomach, curdling into despair, but he still didn’t want to let this brute know how scared he was.
Potter was standing frozen a little ways off to the right, looking at him, mouth open. Draco managed to glare at a spot just above his left shoulder. He really, really hoped Potter and the bloody Aurors might leave him alone now. He had barely eaten or drank or rested for days. He felt as if the confessions had gutted him, ripped him open for Potter to see every horrible thing he’d ever done. He was starting to shake. He needed this to be over, but he wouldn’t, he
He flailed about, trying to get the crutches underneath him and get himself upright as fast as possible, but his leg was still cramping and the crutches were too long to get leverage on the ground.
Draco obediently lay down on the sofa, and Winky snapped her long fingers and was suddenly holding a small wooden stool. It looked a bit like Frona’s. Did all house-elves have stools they could magically conjure?
him?” Draco couldn’t help the slight tinge of hysteria in his voice. He remembered the crunch of the boulder against his chest, his body’s instinctive understanding that he was close to death. In the whole war, the only other time he’d suffered injuries of that severity had been Potter’s
“Oh, Draco!” Her wide eyes filled with dramatic tears behind her glasses. She swooped over him to the other side of the bed, clutching at her chest and letting out a sob. “I heard all about it! It’s too dreadful! You nearly
But now Potter knew that Malfoy had no leverage; he had to answer Potter’s questions whether he wanted to or not. There was no reason for him to keep the Aurors out of it. Draco tensed, waiting for him to dismiss the privacy charm and call them over.
Draco was already over halfway to Hagrid. He wished he could move slower, wished the Hollow was larger… There were only two more levels of people below him. The spell was driving him forwards to a spot just at the edge of the basin, roughly midway between Hagrid, Granger, Longbottom, and Weasley, where they would all see him, and where he could face them all. Behind him, he could hear Andromeda continuing with the next part of the ceremony.
, when he had let himself believe that the killing was over… He was so stupid. He had thought he was safe.
Draco breathed a sigh of relief. No-one was injured, no-one new was dead. Potter looked frantic, however.
, barely up to his chest. How did muggles get in and out of these things with anything resembling dignity? With his hands occupied by his crutches, it was a lost cause.
Draco’s eyes flew open. A man was looming over him, shaking him - his uncle - Draco shouted and hit upwards, shoving at the man’s chest as hard as he could. The man staggered back a step, releasing his shoulder, and Draco rolled away, half-falling off the bed. He cried out as his left leg tried to take his weight, ignored the cramp and somehow managed to right himself. He grabbed his crutches from on top of the bed covers and backed up blindly until he came up against the pillar of the next bed over, brandishing the wooden crutches in front of him like weapons.
“It’ll be fine, Malfoy. There’s only a couple of Aurors out there right now, and they’ve been briefed on the situation. Now’s a good time to make a move, actually.”
“Yeah, of course, Harry. Give me twenty minutes and I’ll have this ward down and you’ll be able to get back in.”
Couldn’t Potter see how wrecked he was? He couldn’t do it, he wouldn’t be able to do it, the tent was so far away…
The Auror was bearing down on him, wand raised. “Get back in your cell! How did you get the door open?”
They re-materialised on a small hill of tufty grass in the middle of rolling moor-land, dotted with boulders of granite. This moor must normally be wind-swept, but today the blue sky remained serene and huge above them. About a mile away, Draco could make out a quaint little village, tucked in the lee of the hill on the opposite side of the valley, at the edge of the moor. Nothing looked familiar.
Potter shaking his arm got Draco to lurch into motion. He followed Potter towards the centre of the scrubby square. In between one crutch-swing and the next, a small tent appeared.
“Yes. Every head of the family, right back to when we were an actual oak tree, continues to live in me and in that room in the Manor, as long as I replenish their spirits every new moon. We’ve kept the line unbroken for over two thousand years. This is all also, obviously, a family secret.”
Draco took the man’s suggestion and found the ‘seatbelt’ came much easier, and the latching mechanism was surprisingly intuitive to work out. Another clunk sound and the strap was in place, and the man nodded to show his satisfaction.
He retrieved the letter from his uniform trouser pocket, and smoothed out the too-thin not-parchment. He read the details through again, although he already had them memorised: Dr. Anne Liston, 3pm, Phoenix Physiotherapy, Harley Street. He frowned at the address. How did this muggle woman know about phoenixes?
“You’re welcome,” Potter mumbled. His eyes looked bright, greener than usual. “Malfoy, I just realised something - both the first time and the last time I faced Tom, I survived because of, well, because of a mother’s love. Mine, when I was a baby, and yours, last week.”
” He turned on his chair and leaned over to pull the sheet of parchment from under his pillow. He thrust it into Potter’s face.
“I know. As for the tradition side of it, it’s strange in a way, but there are some parts of magic which are so ancient they don’t really require any special ritual or ceremony. When my father passed on the inheritance to me, for instance, all it needed was a mingling of our blood and for us both to state our intention. Some of the old magic is even more elemental than that - the kind that came from your death, or your mother’s, for instance. It’s a type of magic that flows directly from people’s actions, or who they are.”
As his grogginess receded, the reason for being in a hospital bed slammed back into him with an almost physical shock. Shit. He brought himself up onto his elbows and looked wildly around the walls, panicking, expecting Peeves to emerge from one at any moment.
Draco waited to see if Potter would go off on one about blood magic and old magic and how evil it all was, but his thoughts seemed to be going down a different track.
Shacklebolt began to move away, but Draco looked at the phial by his bedside and suddenly remembered something. “Wait!”
Madam Pomfrey had lost the last of her hostility, and looked at Draco with open sympathy. “Also, Mr Malfoy, I wanted to discuss your leg injury. Mr Potter said it was inflicted by a Fiendfyre creature?”
“Look at me when I’m talking, worm!” His voice had gone rough and breathy around the edges, and his eyes were raking across Draco’s face and then down Draco’s body. “Someone should - should really teach you some manners, eh,
Draco stared at her. He wanted to say ‘You can’t apparate in Hogwarts,’ but of course, house-elves could. They did it all the time.
“Dumbledore, he was - well - I cared about him. Obviously. I still do. And I know he cared about me too, or whatever. But, turns out, that didn’t stop him from using me the entire time. He never told me everything. He let me know just enough, and only at the last minute, to manipulate me into doing what needed doing. And I think I sort of get it. I don’t completely blame him. I can’t even say that it would have been nice to know that I was a - that I had to die, because even knowing for fifteen minutes was too long.”
. So, now you’re well enough, you’ll have lunch and then there are some people who want to talk to you.”
His mother finished reading, then passed the parchment over to Draco. Draco blinked, getting his vision to focus, and scanned the page rapidly, anxiety clenching his insides.
Shacklebolt nodded. “I don’t think the house is beyond reach, although it will take a lot of work to restore it. I can spare a curse breaker to help you reclaim it, and then I would be happy to help in dismantling the previous Fidelius Charm and casting a new one for you.”
Draco adjusted his sweaty grip on the crutches and endeavoured to keep his panting silent. The sun was nearly directly overhead, and Draco was half-stifled under the cloak. His heartbeat started to pound painfully behind his eyes, and he recalled that he hadn’t had the time to apply any of his usual hangover charms to himself. He was distracted for a moment by the memory of casting spells again, of feeling his magic channelled through Potter’s wand, before the misery of his current physical situation brought him back to the present. He licked his dry lips and wished he had some water. It was not unlikely that he would pass out from heatstroke before the end of the ceremony, and then everyone would trip over his invisible form as they walked back up the spiral path.
“Oh, well, thank fuck for that. One Malfoy at a time seems like plenty to me.” Potter looked over quickly, as if he expected Draco to be offended, but Draco only snorted.
“I don’t think I can take going to another funeral, Malfoy. But I can’t not go. I can’t. Maybe for some of them I could - but I have to be there, what the fuck am I thinking? They fought for
“So, hold on one moment, Potter, let me see if I understand this. She broke up with you at her brother’s funeral? At
The next moment heat kicked the back of his throat, his tongue was bathed in flames, and he was spluttering for breath.
Draco felt a growing pain in his chest to add to his collection, but he knew this pain wasn’t caused by physical injuries.
He had to tell Prudy. He wanted her to hear it from him. Yesterday, Potter had said that Madam Pomfrey had been taking care of her, so probably that meant she was in the hospital wing.
Draco almost moved the leg in question, but remembered just in time that he was supposed to be staying still, and that the muscle would seize up.
“It will never be as strong as it was when it was whole. However, I am confident we can achieve meaningful rehabilitation here. If you work hard, you’ll be able to walk again without crutches, although there will still be some level of limp, and you will probably still use a cane for support. I doubt you’ll be able to run much, but a lot of other forms of exercise will be open to you.”
“Then fine. Can’t lie to me, right? So get on with it and cast those spells.” He gestured blindly towards Draco with his wand, one hand still clutching his head.
“We had to put you under several complicated Stasis Charms to induce a magical coma. We finished fixing you up at about dusk, and you’ve been under an extra-strength Dreamless Sleep potion until now. So all in all, about twenty-eight hours.”
“No way. Head hurts. Can’t think about new spells. Here.” Potter thrust his grubby, grey-white holly wand towards Draco.
Draco shuddered. ‘Clever techniques’ probably meant dosing someone with alcohol and then knocking them out with a firm uppercut to the jaw. The idea of letting a muggle get close to him made his breath start to come short. He almost said, ‘My father will hear about this,’ but bit that back and substituted with a weak, “I am not at all pleased with this.”
“Anyway, look, Malfoy, I should probably be getting back to Hogwarts for the night. But all I’m saying is that you’re not doing anyone any good if you go around beating yourself up. Sure, absolutely, go ahead and do these tasks to pay penance, it’s certainly got some poetic justice to it, but you’ve got to
Potter laughed. “Why am I not surprised? Look, I’m not much better, to be honest - I have a tiny bit of an idea, but I’ve never eaten Indian food either and I
“I know, Prudy, but you need time to grieve. I’m not sending you away, okay? This isn’t a punishment. It’s just for a week.”
“How are you feeling, Prudy? Are you completely healed?” Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Potter take a seat in one of the transfigured chairs from earlier.
“I was not aware you had come into your inheritance.” Shacklebolt’s deep tone of voice was impossible to read. Draco knew he would be thinking of the lost reparations that they would no longer be able to force his father to pay.
Draco took a deep breath, planted his right foot against the ground, and seized the muggle’s hand. It was dry and warm, and in one smooth movement the man had pulled him up and out.
He had thought he’d already accepted that as a fact, but it wasn’t until now that he realised that he was hoping this muggle would supply him with some miracle solution. He just didn’t know how he was going to cope, living like this forever.
He bowed his head, and let the tears fall. They cried together for several minutes. Draco had never felt pain like it - a bitter, stabbing regret. If only Dobby were alive, he would certainly have been among the seven people the Path would have sent him to. He could have made amends, atoned by doing Dobby’s task. And now, instead, he somehow had to live with himself.
Draco’s head came up sharply. The last of the numb fog was draining from his mind, leaving the familiar tang of terror.
Draco nodded. The man was sitting so close, but his attention was on the road in front of them. He manipulated a stick in between them and did something with his feet, and all at once the car was moving.
Draco stopped. Peeves floated three feet above the floor, glaring at Draco. A smile twisted across his features with no trace of his normal glee.
Although, of course, in Draco’s case, it didn’t matter how much warning he had about the topics, he would still have to tell Potter anything he asked. Draco’s chest tightened at the prospect of more of those forced confessions. Perhaps Potter was just messing him around with a bizarre double-bluff.
“We are come,” the crowd intoned softly. Draco moved his lips soundlessly over the response, recalling them from funerals years ago - a grandmother here, a great-aunt there. He noted with surprise that Potter also knew the response, when he never seemed to know anything about wizarding culture. How many funerals had Potter already been to over the last week?
Draco adjusted his sweaty grip on the cross-bar of the crutches and did as he was bid. He was still hyperventilating, still over-sensitive to everything, but he fixed his eye’s on Potter’s back and somehow followed him back out of the door, down the steep steps, across the road, over the grass and back through the tent flap.
The last time Draco had been in here, he had seen a low-ceilinged, dark room with a tiled floor. The tiles, in fact, were the room’s main and only feature. The entire floor was made from a detailed mosaic, showing static pictures of the Malfoy family tree going back seventy generations.
At that the woman finally blinked and got over herself. She looked down at a large appointment book in front of her and ran her finger along the entries.
had his father apologised to him. He dropped his gaze to the table and gave his father a brief nod of acknowledgement, not trusting himself to speak.
He had only taken one step - well, swing - forward when he saw Potter give a nod, and in unison, both the Aurors and Potter raised their wands higher.
Draco had a sudden memory of Wormtail’s silver hand. He balked at the idea of deliberately cutting his leg off, but that hand had worked perfectly for Wormtail - until it had strangled him. It was still worth looking into; he needed to speak to his father, he might know how the silver hand was created. Surely he would be permitted to correspond with his father in Azkaban, even if he couldn’t visit?
“I accept the mantle,” Draco said quickly, just before a hand grabbed his shoulder and wrenched him away from his father.
Myrtle suddenly cackled, the crying forgotten, and executed a quick loop. “Ha! I’m glad you didn’t die this time, Draco.” She looked down at him with a glint in her eye.
” Lestrange growled, and ropes lashed around Draco, binding his arms to his sides and his legs together, the cane trapped uncomfortably between his right hand and his thigh. He overbalanced and landed on his side, half on a rag-rug. He twisted desperately over onto his back to keep Lestrange in view.
Shacklebolt looked at Potter, at Draco, then back at Potter. Draco could not interpret his calm expression.
Potter was staring at him as if he had never seen him before. Draco supposed that it was exceedingly strange to hear himself apologising, especially to this particular person. Then Potter sighed.
Shacklebolt smiled. “Thank you,” he said, and offered his hand. Draco shook it, a little taken aback. “I will instruct the Aurors to retrieve them and pass them along to Madam Pomfrey.”
He didn’t know what to do with the dirty plate and mug afterwards, so he stacked them on the kitchen counter and went to have a shower. The bathroom was tiny and the water lukewarm, and the high side of the bath was exceedingly awkward to step in and out of with only one good leg. He ended up sitting on the rim of the bath and pivoting to lift each leg over the greyish porcelain.
The sun shining strongly down from the enchanted ceiling confirmed that it was already well into mid-morning. They had sat there for hours, and apart from accepting some water and sandwiches from a tray carried by a house-elf, they had interacted with no-one else in the room.
He could not stop himself from staring at the place where the Dark Lord had fallen. He was gone. They were safe. Both his parents were here, right here, still alive.
started to trust that the driver wouldn’t hit anything with his car when he eased them out of the flow and stopped by the edge of a pavement.
The pull on him quadrupled, and there was no way to fight it any more. Draco could feel his heart going more than twice as fast as it should, and his breathing was coming in sharp pants. Oh Gods, this was going to be horrible. He stepped off his circle of granite and onto the grass. The grass descended steeply between the levels of the spiral path, and Draco knew he couldn’t do this on one foot. He lowered himself to the ground, discarding both crutches and continuing on his bum like a deformed crab. He angled himself downwards and to the left, manoeuvring between the standing people, the invisibility cloak still over him, dragging through the grass and tangling with his legs. He could at least delay his appearance until the last possible moment - he knew the spell demanded he be seen as well as heard, but he could make the disruption as short as possible -
“Excellent. Right. Welcome back to the household, Prudy,” Draco said, feeling faintly ridiculous about doing this from a prone position on the floor, but determined to show good manners.
The next moment the man was walking around the front of the car towards him. Draco froze, but, barring a bit of an odd look at his cloak, the man didn’t approach closer than to operate the unfamiliar handle on the car door and open it with a soft clunk.
“Oh, man.” Potter wiped at his eyes. “I needed that. I haven’t laughed like that in - I can’t remember when I last laughed like that.”
“Listen, Draco. Your mother will probably still have to serve some kind of sentence. My hope is for a large fine and house-arrest, for only a few years. You may receive a similar sentence, if the new mudblood regime is merciful enough to take into consideration that you were a child during most of the war. However, we cannot count on it. This war has been too bitter. They will want revenge. They will want to see the Malfoys suffer. They will want to see us stripped of everything we have.”
Draco wondered if he’d ever get used to hearing himself addressed by his father’s title. “I am glad to be of help, Minister.”
. And tomorrow - tomorrow is - fuck. Tonks and Lupin. Oh, Merlin. And guess what? I get to meet my godson! Little Teddy.” Potter’s breathing became distinctly uneven once more, and he brought his knees up and leant his head down on them, wrapping his arms round his legs. Draco didn’t think he was imagining Potter’s slight rocking motion back and forth.
Shacklebolt stood up. “Harry, I will go and brief Robards and the Senior Aurors with this new information. I’ll call you when we begin to discuss plans, if you like?”
Draco’s smile faded. “I thought you already had. I seem to remember him coming off worse in that fight you had at the Ministry.”
His father gave him a small smile, approval radiating from him. Draco tried to drink it in, tried to store it away so it could sustain him after he could no longer have his father.
He focused on the blank parchment and the feel of the feather in his hands. He found himself stroking it gently, over and over, and let his mind calm down.
“Malfoy, I know I said I wasn’t going to ask questions, but I need to know what the hell you were thinking.” Draco braced, thinking of sixth year, or just last Saturday, trying to drag Potter off to his death. “Where were you going? Why didn’t you stay in Slytherin? You said you would!”
“I meant to go to a corner shop to get some groceries but then I saw this Indian takeaway place on my way there, and I honestly couldn’t be bothered with cooking anyway…”
Still, just from listening to those sat around them, they had picked up the pieces of news that came filtering in from across the country. Everyone who had been
Eventually he recovered enough of his presence of mind to look around. The pavement here was much wider and cleaner than at Grimmauld Place, and the buildings rose regal and imposing and white. Draco was grateful to spot his destination almost immediately, just a little way along the street - a large free-standing black sign declared in gold capitals, ‘Phoenix Physiotherapy’ with the names of six or seven different muggle healers listed underneath in smaller writing. It also had a stylised picture of a bird rising from a gold flame. Draco swung himself over to it, and saw Dr. Anne Liston’s name first on the list, followed by a jumble of letters that perhaps equated to some kind of muggle titles or qualifications.
“Okay. Well, if you wouldn’t mind trying to stand on that leg? You can hold on to the desk so you can stay upright and I’ll be able to watch the muscle from here.”
Draco nodded slowly. It made sense. Just - Merlin - eight hours ago he had been clutching Goyle, sure he was going to die, and now he was about to become head of the family? He wanted to say he was too young for this, far too young for the responsibility, but he stopped himself. He had to do this.
Waiting for Potter’s return was exceedingly boring. Draco had never realised how often he wanted to move until he had to lie entirely still. He passed the time by watching the rich afternoon sunlight catch on the dust motes and refract through the Bloody Baron. He thought about trying to engage the ghost in conversation but didn’t want to show his guardian any disrespect.
Lestrange leered at him, his yellow face framed by his lank dark hair. He looked even taller from Draco’s position on the floor.
“My what, sorry?” Draco was proud he had managed to speak, although he would admit his voice sounded breathy.
Draco sat, purely because Potter was in a frantic hurry and he didn’t want to slow him down. Potter ran up to him, dropped the shoes, and ran back into the bedroom, shouting, “Get those on - I’ll get you a jumper - ” Draco obediently started lacing as quickly as he could, gingerly easing his foot into the left shoe without putting pressure on his leg, but his foggy mind had finally caught up enough to protest.
The Aurors, a man and a woman, both glanced at the tree growing out of the floor and its grisly fruit, but Potter wasn’t distracted for a second.
Draco heaved himself up off the floor again somehow, using the side of another armchair for leverage. He gathered his crutches from where they had fallen and swung over to stand in front of Potter.
Peeves appeared at the top of the stairs, holding another big chunk of stone. Draco cried out, or tried to, and his right hand planted his crutch against the floor. The Old Magic made his shattered bones grate together as it thrummed through him at top speed. In the time it took Peeves to soar down the stairs, the crutch had burst into a network of branches, forming a protective cage over Draco’s body.
bodies couldn’t be tied together with magic, could they? Suddenly, he realised how complicated his body was, and he was burning with curiosity. But he didn’t want to reveal any more of his ignorance to this muggle. It didn’t seem right for him to know so much less than her.
His anger abruptly collapsed into anxiety. This woman may be a muggle, but she was also a healer. Healers
The woman was too rude to break the silence and do her job, so Draco would have to do it for her. He moved forwards towards her desk and said, “My name is Draco Malfoy, I have an appointment with healer - er, with Anne Liston?”
Potter jumped out of the chair with a lot more energy than before, and took off towards the tent flap. Draco had barely blinked and Potter was running back in.
you. You need to get a bit of perspective, Malfoy. You’re only human, and you were in an impossible position.”
Draco jumped, but didn’t have time to react further before a rush of cold air moved over him, and he felt his tongue roll back against the roof of his mouth. A flutter of panic rose in his chest, but the next moment, his tongue was released.
Draco fumbled for his money-pouch, pulling out a handful of crumpled notes and random coins. He stared at them for a moment, before the man seemed to realise that he needed help with this too and plucked one of the notes from his hands.
Once the pain had faded back to the normal background ache he finally looked up. Potter looked slightly concerned, and the spell immediately demanded he explain. “Leg, Potter. It has a hole in it. Remember? Not enough muscle left, so it cramps up, leading to embarrassing lapses in my ability to remain upright.”
Draco fought the urge to back away as the Auror and Potter rounded the pillar of his bed and approached him. He did not want their hands on him - he wouldn’t let them drag him away - if the elf magic failed him then he still had his crutches, the wood felt friendly beneath his hands -
“It’s the Bloody Baron - he has been standing guard over you ever since you were brought in. He won’t let Peeves anywhere near you. Now you just relax while I finish my examination.”
“My grand-daughter was hoping that young Master Malfoy would take Prudy back into service,” Frona said.
Draco bit his lip, but the look of naked disappointment gathering on Potter’s drunk face was too much to stand.
“Stop!” Draco cried, and the tree froze, as if it had grown naturally in this position. Lestrange went limp, unconscious. Draco’s breath grated in his throat, his mind wiped blank.
And joy rose in him before his brain had even fully understood why. Even as the Dark Lord put him next on the list to die after Potter, he could only feel relief. Never in all those miserable wandless weeks would he have thought he could be so searingly grateful to see his wand clutched tight in Potter’s hand.
Oh, no - oh, no - the pooling of memories had begun. And unlike the slow passing of a pensieve in the funerals he had known before, again Godric’s Hollow seemed innately designed for this. Running from each person’s plinth was a narrow granite channel in the ground, leading down into the central basin. All around him, people started bringing their wands to their temples and drawing out long strings of liquid-smoke memory.
And Potter just kept crying this time, great heaving sobs that went on and on, and no amount of Draco making gentle circles on his back with his hand seemed to help at all. Finally, Potter raised his head off his knees and turned his head to look straight at Draco, his whole face swollen and his eye-lashes clumped together with tears.
He closed his eyes and held tighter to the crutches, letting the smooth touch soothe him. He let a little of the old magic out through his hands, sensing the essence of the wood. He could outline the shape of the crutches without looking down. The wood was long dead, but Draco knew that if he asked, it would come alive again for him, grow for him, defend him. It was good to know that he had some way of protecting himself; he had already fought off both his uncle and Peeves, hadn’t he? And
“I’m not familiar with the way muggles live, Potter, but this doesn’t seem like a very savoury area. Why would the Blacks choose this as the location for their ancestral home?”
Potter beamed, and Draco couldn’t resist smiling back. “Yes, but we both know you’re not as prattish as you used to be, Malfoy.”
“I would rather stay here. I - ” Damn. “I don’t think I’d feel safe at a hotel. It wouldn’t exactly have the best security against vengeful Death Eaters when they learn that I’ve sold them out. Anyway, a wizarding hotel would probably refuse to have me, and I wouldn’t feel comfortable at a muggle one. Also…” Double damn. Deep breath. “I would get - lonely. You’re pretty much the only person who’s willing to talk to me at the moment.”
Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Using magic again felt amazing, but it was also tiring to do so many spells at once while still suffering from his own hangover.
“No, wait, Malfoy… it’s only your leg, right? Surely there are modified broomsticks to help with the balance?”
Weasley frowned, sighed. “Harry - hey, it’s all right. I get it. But look, you are going to come to Fr- to the funeral tomorrow, yeah?”
The minutes passed with excruciating slowness. He wanted to get out his pocket watch, but he had a feeling it wasn’t a very muggle item and he was too embarrassed to reach for it. He could hear the tick of a clock just above him on the wall, but he didn’t want to crane around to see it, he would look stupid if he did that. He settled his crutches against one side of the arm chair and gripped his hands together tightly. They were getting sweaty. He could feel sweat beginning to prick at the edges of his hairline too. Oh Gods, why was he here? These muggles couldn’t help him! If magic couldn’t fix his leg, how could a muggle? More likely they’d cut it off, yes, and they would have to hold him down while he screamed from the pain, and it would take ages, because they would have to cut through every part of his leg slowly with a knife…
Potter spoke to the foot of the bed, avoiding everyone’s incredulity. “Oh yeah, um, of course.” Potter quite obviously wished he’d never said anything. “That’d probably make more sense, you know, Grimmauld Place is horrible, even I don’t want to stay there much.”
“I’m sorry, Winky.” Draco’s eyes stung and his throat felt thick. “Dobby was - was a very brave elf. I saw him, Winky. He fought a whole room full of his old masters to save Harry Potter. He saved everyone.”
Draco grabbed one of the crutches off the floor, and with that under one arm and his other hand against the desk, he got enough leverage to hop up onto his right foot. He turned towards the desk and the doctor rolled herself behind him, where she could finally get a clear view of the hole in his leg.
No house-elves. Frona had made it clear that her goodwill extended as far as telling him about the Path of the Penitent, but no further. And Prudy - with any luck, Prudy was receiving proper medical care right now. Draco’s chest clenched at the memory of how light and limp she had felt in his hands.
, and he let me put the DA at risk during your raid. I’m sure he did care about you, he probably agonised over it and wished he could help you, but you were just too valuable a tool to spare.”
Draco looked up, and grinned at Potter’s wide-eyed expression. “Any requests, Potter? I’ve only tried with water once before, but I think it’s the kind of thing that doesn’t need much practice.”
He gasped as the water stopped falling abruptly at his hand, and started filling the space in the air above his palm. It looked almost as if he was holding a large, invisible bowl, except that the water became a pulsating sphere, like a dew drop as big as a quaffle, growing every moment as more water poured in from above. He pulled it gently out of the way of the shower’s stream, and turned it this way and that, admiring the way the light refracted. Then he imagined what he wanted again and laughed as the globe of water immediately twisted upwards, lengthening and spiralling until it took the shape of a cobra, rearing and displaying and spitting in his face.
He checked the pocket watch again. The delicate gold hands told him it was barely nine thirty. Potter had ordered him a muggle carriage - a car - no, a
He turned back to the tent. The only times he had been camping were as a seven-year-old sleeping in his enchanted treehouse in the orchard at the Manor, and at the Quidditch World Cup every four years, when their tent more closely resembled a portable palace.
On the word ‘Fred’, Potter’s voice finally cracked, and his breaths hitched into quiet sobs, his head bowed and his shoulders moving with each gulp of air.
“Anyway. I think he cared about you too, but, well, if I was you, I would be livid. He used you, Malfoy. He knew damn well what you were up to that year, Snape must have told him straight away. He could’ve offered you and your mother a way out right back in the summer, the Order could’ve hidden you, but it was all too perfect an opportunity for him to stage his own death in a way that let Snape stay at Hogwarts. So he let you suffer, and stumble along, and nearly kill Katie and Ron. And he let me stumble around after you until I nearly killed
was what was meant to happen - in the funerals he had attended in the past, the beams of light had simply dissipated in the air. Draco had thought that was what was meant by ‘lay bare our loss to the sky’.
Draco wanted to say something cutting to show Lestrange that he wasn’t intimidated, but he could barely even breathe. He felt light-headed.
“I’m not going to use anything against you, Malfoy. Well, I did agree that I’d ask you about the other Death Eaters, and you’ll need to explain the Path thing properly to the others, too, but I - I didn’t tell them about the wood-elf thing.”
There was a sound from Draco’s left and he turned his head, to see another, much younger, house-elf who he very much did recognise.
Draco chose the chair that kept his back to the wall so he could keep an eye on the receptionist. He noticed a stack of magazines (why was everything so shiny around here?), with strange, stationary photos plastered across the cover.
They walked along just below the grassy rim of the bowl until they were nearly directly opposite where they’d entered. Draco cringed at the sound of his crutches on the stone, but although plenty of people looked up to watch Potter go past, the cloak seemed to be mercifully effective. When they came to where the last person in line stood - it was someone Draco vaguely recognised from a couple of years ahead of him at Hogwarts, possibly a Ravenclaw - Andromeda took up the next available circle, Potter the one behind her, and Draco the one after that.
He turned towards the door to the living room and frowned. A slight, silvery light was coming from in there, although it was barely noticeable against the sunshine. He gripped his crutches and swung himself as fast as possible towards the living room, his hangover forgotten; that light looked like a -
As soon as he stopped crying, Potter tipped his head back and drained his glass down in one, without even flinching. Then he held out his hand. Draco passed him the bottle.
Nothing happened, of course. Draco hadn’t even thought to look for Lestrange’s wand on his way over to Prudy.
“And the effects, in summary - correct me if I’m wrong - are to prevent you from being locked up, to clear you of all crimes in the eyes of the law, and to require you, under pain of death, to complete by the end of seven lunar cycles an act of penance for each of the seven people you have most wronged?”
warily. He had never read it, but he hadn’t been able to avoid the other Slytherin students quoting the most salacious parts of it all year. Gingerly, he took the book off the shelf and looked down at the cover. At least the eyes twinkling up at him weren’t empty and sunken like the dust-Dumbledore’s had been. He took a shaky breath.
Potter laughed, refilling his glass for the third time. “I know. I know. I just couldn’t help myself, I was curious…”
If this was Pansy, or even Blaise, Draco would have already moved to wrap his arm around them, let their head fall down onto his shoulder. It would have surprised his parents to know how touchy-feely he was with his close friends, although never Crabbe or Goyle. He half-wished he could muster the courage to do it now, simply because Potter so clearly needed a hug. But it wasn’t Draco’s place to assume such a role.
your fault, but I can still kind of see how, if I’d been brainwashed into feeling superior, it might have been easy to act like an entitled little git.”
Before even saying a word, Potter handed over a sturdy, dry twig. It was about the length of a forearm and felt almost like a wand in Draco’s grip. The Old Magic hummed happily in his belly at the touch.
Frona peered at him from her stool, and Prudy was wringing her hands again in sympathy, looking concerned. Her pity made Draco sit up straighter. It wouldn’t do to let his house-elf think he couldn’t handle himself. Although, perhaps it was a little late for that - she had seen him at his most helpless, after all. But it was different now he was Lord of the Manor. This was a fresh start, or at least he could pretend it was.
A few minutes later, Potter was standing in front of him, holding out the cup of tea. Draco cautiously unwrapped his arms from his chest and didn’t feel at immediate risk of falling apart. He took the tea - it was in the Chudley Cannons mug - and let the warmth seep into his hands and comfort him.
Draco flinched a bit when he stepped closer, but to his credit, the man pretended not to notice, instead holding his hand out patiently. Draco was a second late in responding, but then he made his arms move and passed the crutches over. Now that he could use one hand on the roof and one on the open door, it was easier to twist around on one leg and lower himself in, although he still dropped the last few inches into the padded seat with a bit of a
“Begging your pardon, oh most Potterful one. I was just doing what any decent soul would do, your Chosen-ness, sir!”
It was the first time Potter had deliberately used his advantage over him, and Draco didn’t know why he was surprised: he deserved the suspicious tone. He kept his chin up and forced himself not to mumble.
Shacklebolt looked at him levelly for a few long seconds, until Draco couldn’t help but blurt, “Of course, I am grateful to the Ministry for taking the necessary steps to secure the Manor, and I am happy to allow the Aurors full access to the premises to support them in so doing.”
“How about curry?” Potter slid another box over towards him, which was full of some kind of pungent stew of an unnaturally orange variety.
Madam Pomfrey sniffed. “No. It was badly hurt - I mean, it sustained severe structural damage in the battle. We lost our entire supply of healing potions, I have had to borrow from the emergency store at St Mungo’s. So unfortunately, I haven’t been able to be of much use, at a time when I am needed the most.” Draco could see that her eyes had started to shimmer with tears of frustration.
“No, Master!” Prudy covered her mouth with her hands and gazed at him with eyes full of horror. Draco kept his back straight, with difficulty.
Potter winced and hunched into himself. Apparently he cared about this house a bit more than he said he did. “Kreacher’s going to be devastated.”
He felt his breath begin to speed up and closed his eyes. No, no, he needed to calm down. He needed to not be a wreck when Potter came back. He took slow, deep breaths and tried to come up with any sort of positive angle on the situation. Well, that was easy, he could be dead. He could have been maimed somewhere more visible and lost his excellent Malfoy good looks.
He averted his eyes from the rest of the list, not wanting any more names to jump out at him. Instead he reached for the quill and ink, and, with handwriting that was much more shaky than usual, wrote
“… and then she took off running to the professor, all snotty and crying, but - you!” Myrtle span around and flew right up to Potter, jabbing an icy finger into his chest. “You should have been expelled! Why are you here? You
Potter brought his head up and squinted at him. He looked strange without his glasses on. Draco turned and scooped them up from the mantelpiece, where he had placed them last night. Potter took them without a word, put them on, and squinted up at Draco again, more successfully this time.
He had hardly managed to get himself to his feet (foot) before the young receptionist was back, followed by an older woman wearing a neat red cardigan and loose grey trousers. She was tall, solid-looking, white, and had her hair cut shorter than his own, even though she was probably older than his mother. Draco couldn’t help but stare a little. He wasn’t used to seeing women wearing trousers, and the only woman he knew with a short hair-style was Madam Hooch.
Peeves screeched and hurled the stone down onto him. The branches splintered but held, and continued to thicken, weaving themselves across the remaining holes.
Frona stopped circling her hands above Draco and sat back on a tiny stool behind her with a deep sigh. “Frona has done all that can be done, Master Malfoy. How is you feeling?”
The driver had mercifully pulled the car to a stop just before they rolled right out into the oncoming traffic, and was looking over at Draco.
“I’d rather have been brave than rational. But I was intending to take your mind off things, and now I’ve fucked that right up, so let’s eat. It’s very important to have a proper supper before getting black-out drunk, you know, Potter.”
Draco stopped at a green-and-silver sofa, and lowered himself awkwardly onto it. He didn’t think he’d been asleep long. From the lake-light coming in from the windows, he’d guess it was still before midday. He arranged the crutches on the sofa next to him and tried not to shiver as he waited. It was damp and cold without any fires lit down here, but at least half of his shakiness came from the adrenaline still coursing through his system.
Draco wished he knew what else to say. He could go off on a rant about the Weaselette, but he didn’t know how much leeway Potter would feel comfortable giving him. Potter’s stupid sense of nobility would probably force him to speak up in her defence. And Potter needed the space to vent about her if he wanted, not defend her.
He reached up and wrapped his hand around the post nearest his head. The touch of the polished wood instantly made the old magic reverberate through him, and he felt a fierce joy at possessing a form of magic that was bred into his bones, and could never be taken away from him.
Draco opened his eyes. The muggle had leant over and somehow caused the window to open, and Draco could see a man’s wrinkled face, his features somehow akin to Potter’s in the shade of his skin and the black of his hair, with a hint of concern in his dark eyes.
Draco bristled, but he couldn’t argue. He’d never thought of himself as a bully before, but it was the right word, wasn’t it? And beneath the reflexive offence, a part of him was desperate to believe Potter’s words.
The thought almost made him whimper. He really didn’t want to start thinking about it. He had spent most of every day, when not actively busy trying to survive, deliberately trying not to think about it. But he had to, didn’t he? He had to face it so he could move forwards on the Path.
His breath was coming faster and faster. He wanted to retch, he felt dizzy, he was shaking. He clung to his knees. His chest was getting tighter and tighter, the pain building. He knew he was doomed and he could only wish that he could muster enough backbone to die with some fucking dignity in front of Potter. But no. He was too damn
Potter sucked in a surprised breath, and finally seemed to see him properly. “You didn’t kill him, Malfoy,” he said roughly.
“Huh. Saving the world really put a crimp in your being a teenager, didn’t it? Or was that being friends with Granger?”
“No! No, Master Draco, sir. Prudy is being so happy you survived. Prudy th-thought we is all - all safe. But it was being a war, sir. We cannot all survive.”
“Because your ghost would have been flat as a pancake!” She cackled again. “Urgh, seriously though, imagine it. All squished and shattered… ew,” she shuddered, “no
Draco could hear his own breathing. It made a horrible, rattling, gasping sound. His whole left side felt warm.
Draco didn’t think this was the full reason. He was not going to mention that the Path of the Penitent was exclusively house-elf magic, and the only reason he could use it was because his inheritance had connected him to his wood-elf heritage. “You want to approach them first so you can brief them on what to ask me to do, right?”
Potter ignored him, instead half-turning to give the Aurors another nod. The male Auror held back, keeping his wand pointed straight at Draco, while Potter and the female Auror stowed their wands up their sleeves and started moving around Draco’s bed.
He returned to the common room by way of the bathroom, picking up his old clothes with a grimace and throwing them without ceremony on the common room fire. The flames were nearly smothered but recovered gamely, and Draco watched, pleased, as his clothes were slowly destroyed.
ed me, and them, on and off for a few hours, until I tried to do it, just to stop them being tortured any more. But I couldn’t. I said the words but it had no effect. I couldn’t - couldn’t mean it enough. I was too weak.”
Probably not reassuring at all, actually. If this woman had been involved in the war in even a marginal way, it wouldn’t have been on his side. “How much - er, how much do you know about the war?”
The Auror stopped a few steps away from him, obviously wary. Her eyes flickered to his hand, still resting against the wood of the door, and Draco knew she was wondering how much Draco had to do with Lestrange’s injuries.
He passed the knife to Draco. Draco’s heart had started beating faster already in anticipation of the pain, and he wanted to kick himself for being such a coward. After everything, was he really afraid of a little
, it said at the top. There was a key declaring the colour code: red for Potter, orange for Weasley and blue for Granger. The list of chores started in Granger’s writing with things like
Draco took a breath. The thought of being able to see Hogwarts again was surprisingly soothing. But… He looked into McGonagall’s worn face. “You’d let a - a Death Eater come back to school?”
“Of course it is. It’s, er, kind of you. I was just trying to muster the courage to go find it myself. I didn’t expect you back today.”
for Gods’ sake! A couple of charms and no-one will have any idea you’ve been drinking all night, trust me.”
He looked over at where Potter was sitting. The Malfoys were probably the only people in the hall who hadn’t tried to approach him since the battle ended. He looked as exhausted as Draco felt, his eyes still bloodshot from the smoke of the Fiendfyre. How couldn’t the others have noticed that he just wanted to be left alone?
” and gulping it down. Before Draco could find his voice, Potter grabbed another glass, filled it, and thrust it towards him.
think I was going to die when the taxi started moving. Would it hurt the other drivers to keep their cars just a little further away? I swear there was barely a foot between the cars on the left side and the right side of the road!”
After a short age, Potter and the Aurors emerged from the dormitory corridor. The Aurors moved away to the exit wall, but didn’t leave, instead turning to stand guard. Potter threw himself into an armchair opposite Draco.
He turned and swung himself towards the door, where Potter was waiting. As Potter went through ahead of him, he saw where they were going. It was the Great Hall - the temporary hospital wing had been set up in the room behind the Staff Table.
“Look, I had some time to think it over, Malfoy, and I don’t want to use this enforced honesty thing against you. It wouldn’t be fair.”
Draco swallowed, thinking of Dobby. “Well, to be precise, the seven people I have most wronged who are still alive, sir. And if any of the tasks are incomplete after seven lunar cycles, I have one final lunar cycle to finish them, while getting increasingly ill.”
No medical care for him, of course. They were all busy attending to the survivors from the winning side of the war.
“I thank you for my life, Madam Pomfrey. If there is anything that the House of Malfoy can do for you, my door is always open.”
Draco sat shoulder to shoulder between his parents on the familiar bench, looking out over the Great Hall. Under the cover of the long dining table in front of them, Draco held tightly to his father’s hand on his right, and his mother’s on his left. They were not a touchy family as a rule, but this was definitely time for an exception. Since they had found each other at the end of the battle all three of them had kept as close together as possible. The firm press of his parents’ shoulders against his own felt like the only thing keeping him upright at the moment.
Draco pulled the armchair holding his breakfast closer to him and ate some toast mechanically as he thought about what to do. He had told Potter he would stay put here in Slytherin, but this was important. He had until ten in the morning before his interrogation, which he estimated was still in an hour or two. He wished he could cast a
It was about seven in the evening when Potter came bursting into the tent. Draco was sitting in the chair trying to count the remaining muggle money; he was getting his nerve up to go and buy some food from somewhere, but his hunger had not yet got worse than his reluctance to face the muggle world twice in one day.
Over the next few days, Harry and Draco got together to carefully plot out their plan to stake out the warehouse. They’d found it on the first day after following the man's colleague Mandy, she wasn’t exactly very covert, the sound of her high heels echoed throughout the entire alleyway. If they were
Biting his lower lip, Draco opened his eyes and let out a sigh. He'd already been here for a couple of hours. Lifting himself off the seat, he slipped the iPod back into his jacket pocket, leaving the headphones in his ears. He was used to the strange looks, or the glares, but people were much easier to cope with when he couldn't hear what they were saying. He began to walk down the cobbled street taking note of the passersby, a tall bearded man wearing an expensive set of robes. He'd seen the man a few times this week and had noted the man always went into Gringotts around 11am.
I’m hoping that our Auror team can go in, all wands blazing and make our arrests either later today or in the early hours of tomorrow. That gang deserve Azkaban and, as you know, I’d
Potter let out a low laugh, turning his head towards Draco. “That, Malfoy, is the noise of shagging,” he said, clearly hiding none of his amusement. Draco scowled, he should’ve known that,
“So, yeah I guess so,” Potter nodded. “I don’t think he’d care that Louisa is a muggle, nor your best friend.” he added, as though it was a silent question. Draco smiled.
“I couldn’t care less about my father.” he replied simply. Unspeakable Wilson pursed her lips, before nodding and turning her attention back to the Minister.
Draco held his breath, staring up at Harry with such intensity. When Kingsley had explained the details Draco had clammed up immediately. His thoughts wild, intense and terrifying. There was nothing scarier than the threat of Voldemort, especially for himself and his parents. But now everything had changed, the only person in the world Draco wished to protect was the man in front of him. Nothing else mattered but Harry. He’d come to this startling realisation when they’d entered that house, he shivered at the thought.
“I’ll have that one.” she smiled, pointing at the mess of red hair, freckles and pearly white teeth smiling back at him. Draco cringed, turning his head towards his best friend - the look of disdain evident on his face. “Are you serious,
Draco let it go and sat down beside him, smiling. “Well I know it didn’t seem like it, but we’re getting somewhere.” he said, trying to diffuse the tension. “Yeah I s’pose.” Harry sighed, glugging down the rest of his tea and discarding the cup on the coffee table in front.
“Whether they can do it is questionable, but we do intend to stop it. We know they only have a group of eight, but if they manage to recreate then they will be an almost unstoppable force with only eight.” Unspeakable Wilson said, and for the first time a flicker of emotion passed her features. It caught Harry off guard, if even Wilson was worried this was serious.
Draco let out an exasperated sigh and nodded his head. He knew it was absolutely pointless trying to get through to Louisa when she was idealising someone, he was absolutely sure she had some sort of personality disorder but he’d never actually admit that to the woman, she’d be sure to bat him across the back of the head for the insinuation.
“Right, well…” Draco muttered, he really didn’t want to be here longer than he had to be, even if Louisa seemed to be hanging on Weasley’s every word. They’d started up a conversation about the Quidditch match, beside him, Potter groaned.
I thought since you’re away, we could write letters to each other. I talked with Hermione today who told me your mission could be extended? I know you try to floo call but it’s not always possible.
Deciding not to pick up the note, he waited a few minutes until Harry had apparated into the office and bit his lower lip. “Harry, you know how you’re only meant to send the Ministry memos?” he started, his eyes wandering towards Harry who slumped down on his chair with a huff. “Yeah yeah I know.” he waved his hand and nodded.
“Hey.” Harry sighed as he walked through their office door, Draco’s head rose and he bit his lower lip, waiting for the other man to speak. Sitting down at his desk he filled Draco in on the meeting he’d had with Kingsley, after he was finished speaking Draco was rubbing his chin thoughtfully. “Lockwood hm?” he frowned. “He was quiet, but I never expected that of him.” Harry nodded in agreement, his eyes resting on the corkboard. “Well, we have the warehouse, the murder scene, the crop circle/forest cabin and Lockwoods desk now.” Harry noted, standing up he stretched out and rolled his neck, trying to relieve the building tension. His shoulder made a loud clicking noise and he grunted in response.
Harry held back in the office for another few moments, composing himself before he exited the office and walked towards his Auror team, gathering Endelton, Seamus and Dean. “Right, I need you three to sort out that cabin, I trust you to do a thorough investigation. I’ll ask spell damage to assist as well, just in case they’ve left any nasty curses there. I want a full report on my desk in the morning.” He looked over to Endelton, who was nodding his head a little more eagerly than Harry could stomach. Joshua Endelton had been a part of Harry’s Auror team for about two years now, he’d aced training and he was a very competent Auror, but he was one of the most irritating Auror’s he’d ever come to know. The man really didn’t know when to shut up, his humor was inappropriate at the best of times and he was a chronic oversharer.
“You were right at least.” Draco smiled, looking up into Harry’s eyes. “We’ll get them, don’t worry.” Harry looked back, they maintained eye contact for around fifteen seconds, before Harry broke contact and cleared his throat. “I know, we’ll do it together.” he whispered, walking towards the Ministers office.
After a month of stalking Potter, Draco had decided to find out where he was before he came to Diagon Alley, so he started standing beside the Leaky Cauldron at around 1:30 to see if Potter left the premises. His calculations were right; at exactly 1:32 Harry Potter left the Leaky Cauldron, started down the road - looked around suspiciously and eventually at 1:50 he was near Thistle Do Nicely. He then entered the alleyway at 1:52 and never emerged, Draco even waited until 2:30. Sighing, Draco turned around, maybe Potter just really liked stalking alleyways creepily.
"Did you hear?" Seamus asked, joining the rest of the eighth years in their section of the Gryffindor table.
"C'mon, mate, bar's this way," Ron grabbed his arm and pulled him in the direction of the long wooden bar that took up one side of the room. It, too, was packed with people, and Hermione and Harry hung back as Ron gradually worked his way up to the bartender and ordered. Harry was never more grateful for a drink than he was when Ron at last returned – he was beginning to feel overwhelmed by everything. He took a large gulp of the drink Ron had given him, and immediately felt tipsy.
"Yes, it is!" Draco moaned, flinging an arm across his face dramatically. "It's like an ah-pocky, a pock-lisp, an — oh, whatever the Muggles call it!"
Harry frantically tried to think of something clever to say, but instead what came out was, "You look so hot."
"Apocalypse," Pansy said dryly. She had paid attention in Muggle Studies this year, thank you very much.
Malfoy looked up at Harry with wide eyes when he held out his arm, wrist up, and behind him, Harry could hear the Wizengamot start whispering again. The chains on the chair rattled in annoyance as Malfoy carefully lifted his arm. Harry reached out, and after a nod from Malfoy, pulled off the glove that had been on Malfoy's hand ever since that day in the Manor.
The Dark Lord just looked at him for several long seconds, and Draco dropped his eyes, not wanting to seem belligerent. At that moment, Ophis slithered out from beneath a pile of Draco’s hair and began to wind his way up and around Draco’s leg, providing a gentle, comforting pressure.
Malfoy's usual white shirt was now decorated with subtle white floral embroidery, and the collar's edge was cut into delicate little scallops. To Harry's eyes, his robes looked pretty much the same, but his trousers… well, they had been turned into a skirt. It was pleated and made of some shimmery material that fell to his knees and caught Harry's eye as he walked across the Hall. Harry couldn't recall ever having seen Malfoy's calves before – not that he'd ever had reason or opportunity to – but he couldn't help thinking that they were very nice, good-looking calves, and wasn't it a shame that the skirt didn't go just the littlest bit higher, because he was sure that Malfoy's
Pansy glared at Blaise, who cringed in shame. With his help, and Theo's, they dragged Draco out of the castle. He stopped putting up so much of a fight once they were out in the corridors, but insisted on sulking the entire way to Hogsmeade, even though Daphne and Millicent had brought along a thermos of something that was definitely stronger than Firewhisky.

Once you were aware of the existence of the club, that was usually easy enough to find.

Harry slouched in disappointment, catching Ron and Hermione exchanging a glance as he did so, but he steadfastly ignored them.
Harry sighed as he sat up, resigned to looking now and getting it over with. He'd had conflicting feelings about the entire concept of soulmarks ever since he'd first heard that witches and wizards got them. Sure, the idea of someone that was meant for you was nice, but it also felt like a lot of pressure. Harry had enough pressure in his life already.
"And that's why I was watching him on the Map, Hermione! I'm sure he's doing… something!" Harry gesticulated wildly, hoping this would somehow help Hermione understand that he was totally justified in stalking Malfoy on the Map, but her gaze was still flatly unimpressed.
His mother’s announcement left Draco unable to concentrate on any of his usual distractions. None of his books could hold his attention, he could only poke listlessly at his piano keys, and when he practiced his spells none of them had nearly as much precision as usual. Draco finally gave up at trying to do anything productive with his evening and crawled into bed, falling into a fitful sleep.
