Harry was happy to be back with them, but he couldn’t help but feel removed. Not much had really changed at Hogwarts. In contrast, he felt so much had changed for him. He didn’t know if he’d ever feel normal again. It certainly didn’t happen by the time dinner rolled around.
“You know, this was Belly’s favourite curse before she mastered the cruciatus curse,” Rodolphus reminisced, sounding fond. It took Harry a moment to realize that ‘Belly’ was Bellatrix. He would have laughed at the nickname if he didn’t have such a vivid mental image of the woman cursing a bunch of men to feel the pain of labour and then cackling at their misery.
“My hair has never been cooperative,” Harry explain.
“We were… preoccupied,” answered Nott.
“No, I’m ok. I mean, I stopped him before he could-” Harry realized that he had not stopped the man before he could inflict some damage, but he still felt like he should reassure Mulciber. “I’m not bleeding or anything.”
“Congratulations, Mr. Potter,” Hale said with a smile. He pulled Harry up from his chair and gave him a firm handshake.
“Vidanima maxima,” Draco said from Harry’s side. He didn’t move to Harry’s previous spot as he suspected his husband would need him close by.
“You were all there…” Harry started.
“Welcome back,” she said and moved to sit on Harry’s other side. “You look tired,” she said bluntly, but there was worry on her face. She lifted her hand towards Harry but stopped short. He winced when he realized she’d been aiming for his Azkaban number before she stopped herself from touching it.
Despite being prepared, it was difficult for Harry to talk about everything. Especially the part where he decided to bring Sirius in. Harry wasn’t comfortable using his godfather as a tool for his own release, but he did want retribution for Sirius. So, when he spoke about the ministry locking him away without a trial, it was easy to remind the world that the ministry had a history of doing this. Since no one was telling him anything about scheduling a trial, he was starting to believe the ministry planned to keep him in Azkaban indefinitely no matter how unlawful it was.
“What if they step into the cell?” asked Lestrange. It took Albert and Avery a moment to adjust the plan, but they eventually declared they’d tie the wards to blood magic. Only the prisoner keyed into the ward would feel the additional warmth.
“Hello,” Harry said cheekily.
“It isn’t,” Draco said softly. He grown accustomed to state of Harry’s soul, and it no longer caused him a visceral sort of pain to see the damage. There was still so much beauty in it. Harry, on the other hand, still struggled with it and the many questions left unanswered. “You need to believe it, for James’ sake if not your own.”
“The... his cousin was killed by a muggle. He wasn’t... too fond of him,” Harry decided to state. It was something Albert had told him about near the beginning of his imprisonment, when Harry defended muggles as a whole group. All of the Death Eaters had similar stories, and Harry found it hard to defend those muggles. He knew there was a long history of muggles hunting and killing witches and wizard, and that carried pain and anger from one generation to the next. But he’d seen the other side of it too and wizards hurting muggles or portraying muggleborns as less valued or deserving of their magical gifts was not a good response to that. Harry still didn’t believe all muggles were bad; they shouldn’t suffer if wizards sought their revenge for deeds done by someone else. But he’d be lying if he tried to claim that their arguments hadn’t worked on some level. He hoped the wizengamot felt the same.
Despite no longer viscerally feeling the dementors by their proximity, Harry held his breath and clenched his fists to stop his hands from trembling. It felt like it took them ages to approach Harry’s cell. It was only the whimpers and moans of the non-animagus prisoners that let Harry know the dementors were moving in his direction. The delay gave Harry enough time to second guess whether or not he should ask them for answers. He got the feeling that he wasn’t going to like whatever he learned. It was only seeing the peacock and porcupine in the cells across from him that gave Harry the resolve to push forward. If the two death eaters were forcing themselves to remain relatively close instead of cowering in the corner, then Harry ought to have the same strength to face his new reality.
.” Burke said as he held Harry down. “And you’re trying to make
“It’s hardly witty,” muttered Lucius as he rolled his eyes.
Harry wasn’t sure how much he should share. He didn’t want to lie, but the truth wouldn’t comfort Draco. Plus, he didn’t know how much Lucius would want him to say. Lucius had always been Draco’s hero. Harry didn’t want to tarnish that by inadvertently giving the impression that the hardships of prison made Lucius weak. If anything, it was the opposite, but it was hard to explain the man’s strength without acknowledging what he was surviving through.
“Now, you can take the rest of the afternoon to get your bearings. I’m sure Professor Flitwick and Professor Snape would understand if you don’t join their classes today,” he sounded amused, knowing that Harry wouldn’t be in any rush to rejoin Snape’s class nor would the professor be to have him. “I hope you’re feeling up to attending your classes tomorrow?”
“Great,” he said morosely. He opened his mouth a few times as he attempted to add something to that, but nothing came out. A small blush started when he saw that Draco was staring at his mouth, noting Harry’s struggle.
“He came to see me. Once,” Harry said. He cupped his hands around his teacup to absorb some of the tea’s warmth. “He said he’d let me go if I told everything the ministry was doing a good job,” Harry frowned at the memory. He instantly regretted saying anything as he felt Dumbledore’s stare intensify on him. Harry looked into the depths of his mug as if it was the most fascinating thing in the world.
“What’s that now?” asked Albert innocently as Burke came to a halt by the man’s cell door.
Once they were all satisfied with the outline – though Harry was still very nervous – Harry did help Nott with Defense. It worked well considering it gave Harry ideas on what he could include in his own assignments for Snape. In return, Nott and Harry briefly went over the introductory alchemy Harry picked up from Albert. Nott promised to give him a couple of books to help him continue with his studies. Seeing Harry’s less than enthusiastic expression at book learning, Nott promised to go over the content with him as well. Harry happily agreed and was even looking forward to it despite being overworked while he caught up on his missed school assignments.
Harry grasped for any reasonable answer, and eventually settled on, “perhaps because once Burke was kissed, I moved away from him. I was as far back into the cell that I could get.”
“Oh, Ron, don’t be rude,” Hermione reprimanded. Harry didn’t think it was for Crabbe’s sake, but more of an automatic response.
Harry clenched his jaw but didn’t respond. He couldn’t exactly be happy with Dumbledore’s decision because it meant that all of his professors would now watch him closely and wait for him to screw up.
“Potter, with this kind of magic, it wouldn’t just
giving Potter financial reward for his crimes,” Runecraft asserted.
“But you have to understand. Please, Draco. You said you wouldn’t hate me,” Harry despaired.
“Er,” Harry once again felt the need to check his surroundings for eavesdroppers. “It’s probably best not to say how.”
“Yeah,” confirmed Harry. It surprised him how happy it made him to see Crabbe smile. Harry hadn’t thought much about Crabbe jr. even though he’d early on realized that Crabbe sr. would love the opportunity to use the mirror as much as Lucius and Albert.
“You can’t threaten me,” seethed Burke.
“They have alarm and monitoring spells on the books to prevent exactly that,” Nott warned.
Harry was surprised by how upset he was to learn about the Malfoys’ imprisonment. It was partially because he knew Andromeda was correct and Azkaban was extremely detrimental to one's health. But he was more upset that none of his friends had spoken on their behalf. Logically, he knew they might have questioned Draco's supposed reluctance to be involved. He might have taken the dark mark, but Harry felt Draco had done what he could to prevent harm from befalling Harry on multiple occasions. As he considered it, Harry began to feel it was necessary to do the same for Draco. He was less sure about the fate of Lucius and Narcissa, but the more Andromeda spoke of her sister, the more Harry thought he should extend his benevolence to Narcissa. He could only hope he wasn't too late to prevent them from the worst of Azkaban’s harm.
“The ministry hasn’t done anything to them, have they?” Harry fretted.
“I didn’t think he did well in any subject,” Ron said.
“No!” Ron and Harry said at once while the girls laughed. From the corner of his eye, he saw Dean give Ginny a disgusted look.
Harry heard the sound of the door opening at the end of the hall, but none of the pitiful whimpers from the prisoners which signaled that it was the guards again rather than the dementors. How crazy Harry’s life at gotten that he preferred his biggest fear to visit him than some guards. Harry idly wondered if a boggert would still turn into a dementor should Harry ever face one again.
They had to end their reunion when the prisoners heard the guards entering their block to pass out meals. Harry could have spent the whole night talking with them, but still felt satisfied overall.
“There aren’t many guards to tattle. Plus, they’re careful not to push
Harry snorted as he pictured Burke tied up to one of the D.A’s practice dummies.
the reason the ministry had gone after the Weasleys in the first place. If the twins found a way around it, he was fine with them using his name.
“Then why?” he asked softly. “Why are you so resistant to the possibility that James is only your son? You say you want it to be true, but you won’t let yourself believe it.”
As a rule, brewed lube was preferred over the conjured variety. Still, Harry doubted there was a single boy in Hogwarts that didn’t know that spell. Harry had been taught it by Fred and George. The twins had burst into the dorms one day and claimed it was their solemn duty to teach Ron essential life spells. Harry and the rest of the dorm were given a front-row seat to Ron’s humiliation, but everyone ended up learning quite a few useful spells. So, it was exceedingly easy for Harry to fill the bottle with conjured lube.
“When we’re ready, we will look at our options,” Draco said. Harry simultaneously realized that Draco did want more kids, and it was something they probably should have discussed before now.
Burke spelled the cell door open with a flourish. The man was noticeably in a better mood. His eyes tracked Albert as he painfully made his way back into his cell. The prisoner was slightly hunched over. Once his arms were no longer tied behind his back, he held one arm close to his side. His posture made it clear that there were more injuries under his clothes.
Malfoy flinched but Harry didn’t know if that was due to the news about his son or from Harry stating Voldemort’s name.
Harry flinched at
“And you should find someone who meets that,” he added softly. “Draco, you deserve-”
Of course, Harry had to be more upfront about the Dursleys when he eventually rejoined his friends. Ron, Hermione, Neville and Ginny all trailed him to the dorm room for some privacy.
” was the response.
“Shut the fuck up! You don’t know anything! Your bitch of a wife deserved worse!” Harry panted.
“Leave it,” ordered Nott. He was watching Harry, but his eyes kept trailing down to Harry’s neck and the new prison tattoo. Self-consciously, Harry rubbed at the area. It didn’t hurt and was partially covered by the thin shirt, but Harry felt like it was as noticeable as a giant scarlet letter.
Ron and Hermione traded looks, both noting the ‘we’ Harry had used. Ron shifted uneasily as he didn’t want to advocate for harsh punishments when it was his best mate that suffered through them.
Harry eventually nodded in agreement. He wasn’t convinced he needed a mind healer, but he supposed it wouldn’t hurt to read some of the material Hermione had given him. McGonagall looked at him so intently as she tried to gauge his sincerity that Harry would have worried about legimency if it had been Dumbledore or Snape.
“Harry, I’d like you to meet your son, James Prewett Potter,” Mrs. Weasley said as she placed the baby in his arms. Harry thought he was small, even though he was already a few months old.
“Parkinson actually left without you?” Harry asked Draco.
“Great taste, Potter,” complimented Avery while McNair hummed in agreement.
“About your stay in Azkaban?” asked Nott.
eaten other food. People food. Well, not other people but food appropriate for humans,” Harry had to force himself to stop babbling. He took a deep breath and tried again. “I’m not, er, digesting it like you would. I don’t know if I’m digesting it at all.”
Harry nodded and Hale stood up. He hesitated then turned back to Harry. “After my interview with Albert, I plan to head directly to the ministry. I’m fairly certain they are finally willing to schedule your trial. Some members of the ministry are being bullheaded enough that they do not want to drop the charges, so a trial looks unavoidable. I’m not worried. I never make these sort of promises, but I promise you that you will be out of Azkaban in less than a week,” Hale vowed. His certainty gave Harry hope.
They eventually came to a fork. Mounted on the wall was a sign that read ‘Block A’ with an arrow pointing towards the left and ‘Block B’ with an arrow pointing towards the right.
“Of course, we have to make sure it’s permanent. Not easily removed by a spell or whatnot,” Burke continued. He uncorked the potion and poured some onto the cloth. “You know, make sure the message really sinks in.”
“Word of caution... don’t sneak a peak at them. You’ll be scarred for life,” Harry said.
“Unless... what if the horcrux doesn’t take half your soul like I thought. Maybe it just takes a small piece, like the size you’d get if you added up those scars,” Harry proposed.
“I don’t know what they are talking about,” Harry said. Malfoy looked at him carefully. He must have believed Harry because he eventually nodded.
Nott snorted at that. “Walden will help with magical creatures. Avery could help with ancient runes-”
Tuesday was a better day for him. Another one of Lance’s articles was published, but Harry was merely quoted in it along with various others. That one was focused on the need for a medi-witch or wizard to be assigned to Azkaban on a permanent, daily basis. Lance provided statistics on the deaths that had occurred in Azkaban over the past decade. One of the people he’d interviewed implied that some of those deaths could have been avoided with proper medical care. There were no statistics on the injuries that occurred in Azkaban, but Lance used Harry’s quote about prisoner’s injuries being left untreated. Lance stressed the need for the guards to get some basic medical training (though Harry knew that wasn’t the full reason as to why they didn’t tend to prisoners’ wounds). The article ended with a comparison to three other wizarding prisons that had an on-site medi-witch. While their injury and death rates were still too high, they were better than Azkaban’s.
When Harry didn’t respond, Burke smirked in triumph.
Harry created a photo for Crabbe as well. That picture was a combination of the man’s son and Goyle, since all of Harry’s memories of the other boy had Goyle in them as well. Crabbe cried quietly when Harry gave him the photo.
“Did Draco also have dragon footy pajamas?” wondered Harry. He was mentally picturing a young Draco dressed as a dragon and chasing his father’s transfigured dragons around the room.
“I know. It’s ok,” Harry tried to reassure.
, and now wasn’t the time to get into all that.
“Nah, this isn’t on you mate,” Ron said. There was a slight pause before he added, “sales have increased since then. I think people wanted to support you through the shop,” Ron added.
Harry and McGonagall stayed a little longer at the trial as they initially planned to leave when the court adjourned just in case Harry was called back. Harry assumed they would once they got their bearings back, but they never did. The rest of the testimonies went quickly and were more subdued than those that occurred before Harry’s. Consequently, Hale was able to lead the questioning to best support his case. Harry was surprised to learn Hale was not only trying to say Albert had been an unwilling participant the night he was arrested, but that he was also an unwilling Death Eater. Hale claimed Albert was forced into it initially and been trapped ever since. He was rather convincing. Enough that Harry might have believed it himself if he didn't know Albert supported most of the Death Eaters’ goals. By the time he and McGonagall left the ministry, Harry started to believe Albert had a chance. He just hoped Voldemort wouldn't be feeling murderous at anyone publicly denying the glory of being his bootlicker.
“Can you tell me why you’re so convinced James is your horcux?” asked Draco.
“That wasn’t very nice,” he said.
party. Basic healing spells should be taught to the guards, though that would be less important if the guards were not permitted to injure prisoners in the first place. And, there should be more humane living conditions for the prisoners,” Harry stated. As relieving as it was to know he wouldn’t have to go back to Azkaban, he feared what would happen to Lucius, Albert, Mulciber and the others once the public eye wasn’t on the prison as much.
“I’m not suggesting adding a spa,” Harry snapped back. “But warmer clothes would be a good start,” he suggested in a calmer voice.
“For the most part. They, er, your dad, and er, the others, aren’t completely unaffected. But they do better than those that can’t... you know,” Harry explained. He left out the part where a dementor told him they can still sense smaller animals, but mostly left them alone because they were less appealing as meals.
Nott helped him research the rest of the day, thought he was careful to hide that fact from Hermione once she and Ron returned. A couple of hours later, Harry recalled that Lucius had to keep his mirror small most of the time so the guards wouldn’t find it. Harry didn’t know if that would prevent a connection or at least make it harder to hear when Harry tried to call. He slipped a note to Nott explaining this potential complication. He got another raised eyebrow in return, but Nott went to collect a book on shrinking charms. Hermione thought nothing of it, but Harry didn’t know if that was because she didn’t care what Nott was up to or if she, understandably, did not see how it was connected to Harry’s current research interests.
“I’m not sure Volde- er, You-know-who cares how young someone is,” Harry shrugged. After all, Voldemort had attacked Harry as a baby and has been making similar attempts since Harry found out about the magical world. He also didn’t care how old Cedric had been before he had him killed either.
Unfortunately, Flitwick cut their meeting short with enough time for both of them to have a quick meal before their next class. Harry had no desire to follow the man to the great hall, especially after he spotted two Ravenclaw girls lingering outside the classroom. They weren’t as stealthy as they thought they were. Harry pretended he needed to use the bathroom as an excuse to veer away from the professor’s steady march to the great hall. Harry briefly considered going to the kitchen for lunch, but changed his mind when he realized he wasn’t that hungry. Azkaban’s meals were small, providing the minimum needed to keep the prisoners acceptably healthy. Harry was confident he could skip lunch and not feel too hungry before supper.
“So I’m told. Probably because my horcrux was draining her energy,” Harry said bitterly.
“I can help with that!” exclaimed Crabbe.
more. The potential of new life adds a sort of glow. You on the other hand... you
“Well yeah, but...”
“What is it?” Harry asked, once again poking at the mystery meat and trying to ignore the fact that he’d likely be murdered if any of his fellow prisoners got out of their cells.
“The good news is that your case is playing out favourably in the media,” Hale said jumping right to it. “You were starting to lose some support. Dumbledore’s... failure to have you released immediately was lending credibility to the ministry’s unorthodox approach. After speaking to Mr. Nott, I had enough information to steer the media into looking into last year’s ministry-approved detentions. Reporters have been interviewing students non-stop these past couple of days.”
magic. He did not mention blood magic outright, but Harry suspected that was what his professor was referring to, and he was hopeful knowing it was possible.
I didn’t want to go through writing up a long trial, so I made Hale do most of the legwork offscreen... mostly because Harry technically is guilty so it would be tricky to work around that. My vague justification for his release is that Hale managed to cast so much doubt on the ministry that it questioned the authenticity of their proof that Harry was guilty. Because the trial went on without Harry present, Hale was able to pick and choose parts of Harry’s testimony that never openly admitted his guilt. So, just imagine Hale being a badass putting the ministry in their place while painting Harry as the wizarding world’s angel despite his crime.
“I’ll arrange it during my next meeting,” promised Nott. Harry nodded and felt a weight being lifted from his shoulders. It wasn’t much. It might not even help. But it was a plan. A step forward. Even surrounded by concrete walls, Harry suddenly felt a little less trapped.
Despite the glorious comfort of his bed, Harry couldn’t sleep any easier than he had in Azkaban since eating Burke’s soul. He laid in bed for a long time, only partly comfortable bundled in his comforter. He felt hot but was unwilling to get rid of the comfort of his blanket. He stuck a foot outside his sheets and hoped that would help cool him down. Harry wanted to sleep, he really did. Unfortunately, he felt wide awake no matter how still he forced himself to remain. Try as he might, he couldn’t calm his thoughts either. He worried there would soon be noticeable consequences for how long he had remained awake. He vaguely recalled that someone, probably Hermione, once told him that sleep deprivation caused hallucinations. Harry had enough problems without adding that to the mix.
“You’re the only perv here,” Harry threw back good-naturedly. As tempting as the opportunity might be, Harry wouldn’t violate someone privacy like that.
“True, but I wouldn’t mind the review,” said Harry.
“You once told me I looked pointy,” Draco explained.
“I don’t know,” Harry answered.
“Thank you,” Harry said shyly, though he couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride with all he had accomplished. He wondered if this was how Fred and George felt every time they created a new product for their shop.
“I’d like to see my wife,” Lestrange said wistfully.
“As in
“Right, now that that’s all done, I’ll just take him to his cell,” announced Burke. He made his way over to Harry and gripped his arm.
“Actually...” hedged Lestrange. Harry found himself creating two more bottles for the Lestrange brothers. Just as his blush receded, Lucius cleared his throat, causing Harry’s heart to skyrocket.
The rest of the carriage ride was spent in silence, but the speed they traveled at made the overall journey very short. Harry was surprised to find a nondescript house their destination rather than the ministry.
“I’m sure he’ll go through that bottle before your transfiguration resets,” Albert snorted. Despite agreeing with Albert, Lucius was not one to squander the learning opportunity. He gave a quick overview of 3 common methods wizards used. Lucius suggested Harry perform the easiest one on the bottle given it was unlikely to be traced back to him. It was also the easiest of the spells to undo, but for the purpose of creating a bottle of lube, Lucius suggested it was sufficient.
Harry was careful of Lucius’ letter as he put his uniform back on.
“Stop,” Harry gasped.
“Everyone should think of one or two simple spells in their area of expertise that we can show Potter in the afternoon,” said Malfoy once the guards had left the hallway. “Though perhaps moving forward, it would be easier to focus on one or two subjects per day.”
At his response, Harry noticed movement behind the dementor. He glanced into Malfoy’s cell. A white peacock was watching him. Harry glanced towards Albert’s cell, but it looked empty. He thought he saw something shift under the cot and assumed the man was an animagus as well.
After they were returned to their cells, Albert thanked them and went to lay down again. The others went back to conversing as quietly as they could. They felt it was getting too late to continue with lessons, so the men quietly told him about their lives before Azkaban. Harry tried not to but he felt some pity for the Lestrange brothers. Most of their stories were about their teen years or early 20s. The majority of their adult lives were wasted in Azkaban. The only ‘happy’ story Rodolphus shared of his later years was when he was briefly reunited with his wife. He still thought she was as beautiful as always. Harry would have found it a sweet story had it been about anyone else. Anger still boiled in him when he thought about Bellatrix, but Harry was slowly warming up to Rodolphus. Harry found he had to constantly remind himself of what the man did to Neville’s family in order to keep an emotional distance.
“Yes,” Harry said and got lost in the memory of how it felt. “It was easy. Too easy to just guide someone’s soul out,” Harry said as he remembered the rush he felt as he did it. The memory of coaxing Burke’s soul from his body was tied to an almost euphoric relief that he had stopped the man from hurting him. Harry wasn’t sure he would be able to convince himself that he ought to feel remorse. Harry was confident that if he had to do it again, he would still pull out Burke’s soul to stop him. The only downside was what came after. “I don’t think I should have eaten it though,” Harry admitted.
Draco hesitantly held out Harry notes, but Harry shook his head. “Keep them,” he offered.
Scrimgeour gestured at the guard that had led him to Harry’s cell. The man seemed reluctant to leave, but eventually did so. Scrimgeour glanced at the nearby cells and seemed unhappy that he couldn’t dismiss the other prisoners.
“It’s not that,” responded Harry. The last time the prisoners were allowed a shower, it was because Albert was seeing his judicial-wizard. The guards wanted to make sure he looked presentable to give the impression they were doing a good job. Harry couldn’t help but wonder if today’s shower meant good news for him. “Do you think all this means that Hale finally managed to set up a meeting with me?” he asked.
Burke gave Harry a look so foul that not even the Dursleys could hope to match it. Harry knew it wasn’t smart to antagonize the man. Burke had already shown he was willing to hurt Harry. He wouldn’t be satisfied until Harry was broken and miserable. But there was a part of Harry that couldn’t back down even if it was the healthiest, safest option. He hadn’t done so for uncle Vernon, aunt Petunia, or Dudley. Snape had tried with limited success. Hell, even Voldemort would be able to tell Burke it took a lot more to keep Harry down. So, while Harry stared at Burke’s blotchy face, he determined that this pathetic man would not be the one to break him.
“No, Harry. I
“No. I asked him to help me,” Harry said cautiously.
“I don’t know minister,” Harry said, doing is best to keep is voice pleasant and even. “It’s going to be awfully hard to be your mascot when your employees insist on displaying their corruption on my body. Between my hand and my neck, I’m starting quite the collection. I’m sure it’s not exactly the message you want to send.”
“They didn’t stop Burke from doing the other stuff,” he said.
Harry and Draco exchanged a glance, before they both moved to follow him. Harry purposely walked slow hoping they wouldn’t catch up to Theo so that he’d be able to speak to Draco for a bit longer.
“I bear the guilt of Nymphadora’s death too. I told her to stay home, that she had a child and shouldn’t be involved in the fighting. But she said she needed to make sure the world was a better place for him, and I didn’t stop her. I should have, but I let her leave and have regretted it ever since,” Andromeda admitted.
“Potter... was- the papers said my father was injured,” Nott brought up nervously.
“We do see blue. I rather like the colour blue,” added Ishanders.
“I recall that. Draco moaned about it in his letters home. He was quite upset with you in particular,” Lucius reminisced with a fond smile.
“Draco, aren’t you going to hug Potter too?” teased Zabini. Harry was almost certain the other boy had caught on to Harry’s crush.
Except something went wrong. It had taken him months to wake up, and in the meantime, Neville had been burdened with the responsibility of vanquishing Voldemort. And Ginny, his beautiful Ginny had died in childbirth. It didn’t feel real, and Harry held on to the hope that the medi-witch had been mistaken up until the point the Weasleys arrived at the hospital.
By the time the guards reached Harry cell, they looked annoyed. Fortunately, Burke was not amongst them. They passed Harry his tray and he was surprised to note that it was the exact same meal as breakfast.
“It worked, but...” Harry grimaced at Bellatrix’s manic expression. “It’s not the most flattering picture,” he explained. Harry had to use a memory from the night of the ministry fight in order to have strong enough impression for the spell to work. The memory of Sirius’ death was too painful, so Harry focused on the moment right after he tried to crucio her.
“Get off of him,” Crabbe’s voice called out. For a brief moment Harry was relieved, thinking that perhaps Burke would stop this madness if he knew the other prisoners were awake.
“Dad!” a happy voice called out before Hale was jumped by a first year Gryffindor. The two said their hellos before Hale introduce his youngest, Regina. It surprised Harry more to learn Hale had a daughter in Gryffindor than to realize he’d named her after himself.
“Draco?” he whispered. He wondered if this was finally the moment Draco realized Harry wasn’t good enough for him. They had solid proof now.
Harry’s hand snapped back to his neck covering the tattooed area.
“My uncle... he didn't want me to know magic was real, so he kept saying I was lying about just suddenly appearing on the roof. He said if I couldn't stop lying on my own, he'd make sure I wouldn't be able to. He...”
“Listen here you little-“ Burke started to angrily respond but cut himself off and glanced nervously towards the end of the hall. A moment later Harry noticed that it was getting colder which likely signaled that a dementor was on its way.
It was tense as everyone waited for Burke to decide what he was going to do. The man glared at Harry, letting him know what his preference would be, but eventually snarled “this isn’t over,” before spitting in Harry’s general direction. Harry was too far away, so Burke’s glob of spit landed harmlessly near the foot of the bed.
“Well, it’s not like he can condone Potter torturing his wife,” a new voice cut in. Harry was pretty sure it was the other Lestrange brother. “Considering she’s your sister-in-law, you probably shouldn’t be encouraging the boy either.”
“Shut up. It is. You’re beautiful,” Harry said. He skirted around the projection, so he could marvel at it from different angles. When he neared Draco, he crowded at his back, wrapped his arms around Draco’s stomach and watched the slow movements from over Draco’s shoulder. They stood there for several minutes and just watched the beautiful light. When Draco finally cancelled the spell, Harry couldn’t help but feel bereft.
“Why? I’m nothing special,” Harry said.
Harry reluctantly shuffled over to the black curtain. Anton made his way over and handed him a plaque. It contained the serial number that was written on the folder.
“Why didn’t you say anything?” asked Zabini. Draco shrugged. He kept glancing at Harry but looking away as soon as Harry returned his attention. It wasn’t the reaction Harry hoped for, but at least it wasn’t antagonistic.
is mostly trying to do it on his own. I overheard Snape offering his help but Draco… he thought it was best if he did it himself…”
Harry stared at Lucius, who looked earnest yet encouraging. Harry wanted to accept what he was saying, but it sounded almost too good to be true. Harry craved acceptance but had learnt to be wary of it all the same. He had grown close to these men over the past couple of weeks, but that didn’t erase all the negative history that existed between them. Harry watched Lucius and tried to figure out why the man would be keen to encourage the boy who once tricked him out of a house elf. Even if Lucius had forgiven all past transgressions, once they left their Azkaban bubble, new problems would arise. Voldemort was gearing up for a war that would pit Harry against them. Lucius encouraging Harry to pursue his son seemed foolish, unless...
“But it can happen. It happened with me. Volde-sorry, You-Know-Who didn’t mean to make me his horcrux, but it just happened anyway,” Harry pointed out.
“What?” he asked.
“Move along Jugson,” said Lucius in a tone that was classic Malfoy superiority. The man didn’t even bother turning around to address Jugson when he spoke.
“Even celebrities have to answer for their crimes,” said Bradley.
With that, the minister turned and left. Harry listened to his limping gait as he made his way down the hall. As the door closed behind him, Harry sagged.
“Of course,” Hale said, though he did not ask how Lucius had gotten his hands on parchment and a quill. If the guards were being kind and considerate, it would not help either Harry or Albert’s cases.
Unfortunately, Harry saw the moment surprise turned to suspicion on the dour man’s face. Snape struggled to undo the damage. Harry didn’t feel much better when he chanced a glance around the room. Nott was watching Snape work with a thoughtful expression. Draco appeared worried as he kept glancing over to watch Harry. It made Harry’s stomach churn unpleasantly. He didn’t want to look unstable. He could feel many of his classmates’ stares on him for the rest of the class, which intensified when Snape finally gave up on fixing the wall and left some noticeable lines. When they were finally dismissed, Harry had to hold himself back from running out the door. He tried to look calm and collected as he packed up his things. Harry had mixed feeling when Nott complemented him with an “impressive” as they passed each other on the way out.
“If it would help. I know the ministry isn’t keen on accepting memories as evidence,” Harry said.
Despite these comforts, Harry was weary of what Dumbledore wanted to talk about. He didn’t think Dumbledore would expel him after all, but he expected some reprimand. So, it completely shocked Harry when Dumbledore opened with “I’m sorry.”
“Hard to say. Azkaban has been much the same now for many decades. Prisons get away with many unsavoury acts and conditions because it’s hard to get the general public to sympathize,” Dumbledore observed. He had a faraway look, and Harry had to wonder if the headmaster had any personal experience with the unsavory conditions he spoke of. Harry internally scoffed as soon as he had the thought. He couldn’t picture anyone arresting the professor.
“Harry?” was the confused response.
(See the end of the chapter for
“We’ll bring him after Potter is returned to his cell-” the guard started to say but was cut off by one angry judicial-wizard.
He felt horrible when he woke up in the morning, but noticed a hangover-relief potion waiting for him on the nightstand. There was also a change of clothes left out for him. Harry could tell from the style of the robe that it was from Draco’s closet. He felt odd wearing something clearly very expensive, but found he liked how soft the fabric was against his skin.
“Obviously not,” Harry sassed before he could sensor himself. There were some titters behind him. He thought he saw Hale suppress a smirk.
It was a lot of information for Harry to take in. While he was glad that Burke’s soul hadn’t merge with his own, that relief was outweighed by a horrible realization.
“Horcrux,” Harry interrupted.
Harry was quick to slip on the trousers next. It might have been his imagination, but he felt like too many eyes were watching him. It became apparent that at least one set of unwanted eyes were focused on him when a voice spoke from directly behind him.
“Unforgivable curse,” Harry admitted then launched into an account of what had happened. He was careful to avoid mentioning that he actually cast the curse and instead started his story from the moment the aurors had stepped into the great hall. He paced back in forth in his cell as he told his story. When he got to the part where they had arrived at Azkaban and he was told he’d stay here to wait his trial, Harry finally allowed himself to vent his frustrations and called the aurors a number of derogatory names.
“The state that Azkaban keeps their prisoners in is something we can use to garner sympathy, but for now we want people to focus on a specific thing. If they’re too busy staring at your hair, they won’t be focusing on the tattoo,” Hale explained. He was surprisingly gentle as he worked to untangle Harry’s hair. After a few minutes he leaned back and frowned.
“Kind of you to say, but it’s not,” McGonagall insisted. They watched each other awkwardly for a moment as neither were the overly emotional sort. Harry very much wanted to leave, but didn’t want to be rude.
It hurt. It was the worst pain he’d ever experienced. The pain he felt in proximity to Voldemort was the only thing that remotely came close, but this was so much worse. Harry almost threw up several times, but forced his body to go through the motions. He used muscle memory that wasn’t even his, but somehow it worked to guide him through the ritual.
“What if you gave a memory of the event?” asked Harry. Having spent a good portion of the year reviewing others’ memories, it seemed like an appropriate solution.
I had to endure that smell,” Burke promised ominously. Lucius hissed at that. When Harry looked over at him, Lucius was glaring powerlessly at the guard. Harry didn’t know what Burke meant, but Lucius’ reaction was enough to tell him he wouldn’t like it.
Harry waited until none of the guards were close to him before he angled his body to see into Avery’s cell. He activated the wards that had been set up earlier. They flashed as they activated, causing Harry to suck in his breath in fear. One of the guards turned in their direction with a frown. Harry held his breath for two nerve-wracking seconds, before the guard decided nothing was out of order and turned away.
“Right...” Harry said and fell silent. Ginny placed her hand on his arm, not rushing him, but reminding him she was there for him.
“Oh sure. You gaining baby weight is my biggest concern. It’s not like anything worse could happen to you,” Harry said sarcastically. He knew it was an immature way to handle the conversation, but he was terrified that Draco would insist he carry their child.
“It’s... he’s still, well, I don’t know how he was
. He is only worried about his own image,” sneered Burke.
“You know they’ll just bother you in the common room,” Ginny pointed out.
“She had to listen to me practice this enough times, she won’t want to hear you say it again,” Draco said, but he did go through his speech so that they had an PG version to share that left out the innuendo, and the subsequent follow through as Draco did get Harry to follow the rose petals to the bedroom. Their friends would be curious, but not
“Do you mind making the cells a bit warmer?” asked Crabbe. “If it’s not a strain, I mean.”
To pass the time while he waited for the others to finish eating, Harry brainstormed spells that would improve the quality of life around Azkaban. When Lucius swept his tangled hair away before it fell into his beans, Harry grew inspired to create the man a brush. He engraved the back of the brush with etchings of a couple of dragons. He used the same mind magic he learnt for the pictures to create realistic dragons based on his memories. Harry tried to tell himself the design was chosen because Lucius would appreciate it, but he knew that wouldn’t fool anyone anymore.
“Oh,” Harry glanced at his hand.
“What?”
The other prisoners were interested in what other hijinks Harry had gotten into over the years. He didn’t want to mention anything that might still get him or his friends in trouble. He also thought it best to steer clear of anything that directly involved Voldemort. He settled on telling them about the time in first year when Draco had caught him out after curfew. Only when he went to tattle on them, McGonagall ended up giving him detention as well.
“I don’t know how to feel either. There’s a part of me that’s hurt and angry and feels like Azkaban is exactly what they all deserve... but Narcissa is still my sister. The thought of her living in a constant nightmare brings me no joy or sense of justice. And her son, he’s even younger than my Nymphadora was. I can’t imagine what that place will do to them,” Andromeda said sadly.
they’d created a child.
Harry struggled with finding appropriate gifts for the other prisoners. McNair’s gift ended up being connected to his subject as well. Harry used the same magical theory he used for Crabbe’s gift, only McNair got an ever-changing figurine of animals. It reformed into a different magical creature every few seconds. Harry included all of the animals that the man had brought up during his tutoring, minus one that Harry didn’t know what it looked like. As a replacement, Harry included a hippogriff. He also made “hippogriff” the password to enlarge or shrink the figurine. He couldn’t resist, though he hoped that the man never realized why Harry found that particular animal so amusing.
something. Something real. If you’re going to arrest someone for being a death eater, maybe make sure they really are a death eater. And take a closer look at your employees. Get rid of the ones that-”
“How specific can the spell be?” wondered Harry. “Could I charm my glasses to let me know if someone was using Polyjuice, for example?”
“Perhaps you also want to stay in solitary,” said Burke. He tilted his head as he surveyed Harry, and all three men could practically see the wheels turning in his head. Burke was clearly hatching a new plan to get to Harry away from prying eyes.
Also, I’m not sure when Slughorn told Harry about that fish. If it wasn’t supposed to have happened yet, let’s just pretend it had for the sake of the plot. He doesn’t resist the idea of blood magic because he assumes his mother was proficient at it. Which I think was likely. With a best friend like Severus Snape, she probably knew all sorts of things a “good” witch shouldn’t know.
The man stopped at the open door and took in the occupants of the cell with a look of shocked horror. He slowly made his way into the cell.
“Yes,” Harry said after a slight pause. He hoped everyone interpreted his reluctance in relation to the subject and not his own guilt.
“As the ladies and gentlemen of the wizengamot are proving, you cannot fault my client for expressing anger against these particular muggles,” stated Hale.
the guards were gone. He felt like he should relax, but couldn’t because the feeling of Burke’s soul was still present. Without the distraction, that too-much feeling returned.
“Oh... I hadn’t considered a career in law...” said Hermione, but she looked pleased by the offer.
“Who knew Harry was secretly a genius?” Theo asked. He let Draco take Harry’s notes and calculations.
It looked like Malfoy wanted to say something more but instead he shivered and glanced in the direction the dementor was coming from. Without comment he turned into his peacock form and backed up in his cell. A glance in Nott’s direction revealed that he was in his animagus form as well.
Ron’s response was cut off by a seventh year Ravenclaw shushing them. Ron grumbled but opened his textbook instead of continuing to argue. When Harry looked up at the shh sound, he noted that the library was considerably more packed than normal. He doubted it had much to do with studying for exams, especially since people kept glancing their way.
Apparently, other people did not have the same reservations.
“Minister,” Harry responded somewhat hesitantly. He didn’t bother getting up from his cot. Instead he sat cross-legged, facing the man.
“It’s alright. Good actually. Though a bit jarring since the taste and texture don’t match,” Lucius said but scooped up another sporkful quickly.
When Ron left, and their sense of desperation and despair increased, one insidious thought kept creeping in. If Harry was the only one that could kill Voldemort, he had to make sure he didn’t die... at least not permanently. And Harry knew of a way to make sure of it. He knew he could provide his friends with a way to bring him back if they needed to.
Harry hesitated at the waistband of his jeans. He’d changed around his dorm mates and the quidditch team loads of times but this felt different. Harry glanced at Anton but the man appeared to be busy writing down and packing the articles of clothes Harry had removed so far. Perkins seemed to be staring at Harry’s shoes. Bradley was standing behind him but when Harry glanced at him, he noticed that he was watching Harry and his wand was still trained on him. Burke seemed to be watching him even more intently than Bradley which made Harry rather uncomfortable. Burke waved his wand in a ‘go on’ gesture so Harry removed his trouser and quickly grabbed the Azkaban ones. He was glad there weren’t special Azkaban pants too.
“Raspberries,” said Crabbe immediately. Harry thought it was an odd choice but was more than happy to provide. All the other prisoners were equally grateful despite remarking on the disconnect between the sight and smell, and the taste. But they agreed that it was best not to chance the guards seeing any accidental leftovers that didn’t look like Azkaban’s standard meal.
Draco had Harry explain as much as he was comfortable sharing. Harry gave a vague account of when it happened, how he knew what to do, a PG version of when he gave Ginny the ring, and finally how he’d woken up from the coma to be handed a broken ring and a new baby. Draco wasn’t as certain as Harry that James was his horcrux, but he couldn’t offer any alternative theories before he researched soul magic. He promised to keep Harry updated on his progress.
“Merlin, I remember that,” moaned Malfoy. “The stench lingered for days.”
“Of course, I do. When you’re ready,” Draco reassured.
“You really think Harry is going to want to go beyond handjobs if he’s constantly reminded that his boyfriend’s dad taught him the sex spells he’s using?” asked Mulciber.
“It might not, but I figured it won’t hurt me to try. If I can’t use anything you say, then I’m no worse off. But if there’s something there, well, to be blunt, your word will go a long way right now,” Hale explained. Harry still wasn’t seeing how anything he said would help. It wasn’t like Albert could pretend he didn’t have dark mark. Still, he told Hale he had no problem with it and gave permission to record his answers with the same quill that was used when he’d been interviewed in prison.
Harry knew he was blushing, but that was a fantasy he had entertained before. Perhaps they’d fight about quidditch, or Draco would insult his friends, or Harry would push to find out what Draco was up to in the room of requirement. Whatever it was, they would argue, possibly try to curse one another, but as they drew closer, their fight would become physical. Only, instead of punches, they would find themselves kissing. What happened next would depend on how the fantasy started. If they had been in a deserted hallway, Harry imagined some heavy petting. Even in his own mind, Harry didn’t want to risk Snape catching them and seeing him naked. But when Harry entertained thoughts of confronting Draco near the room of requirement, he allowed the fantasy to go further. Without the possibility of being interrupted Harry imagined how Draco would feel in his mouth or arse; what he tasted like; what he’d feel like if he allowed Harry in him. Harry wanted to try it all, but assumed that they would only ever happen in his mind.
“I think they broke some quills and a sneakoscope, but mostly they just made a mess,” Ron reassured Harry.
“Potter,” said one guard as he passed over the tray of food. “Burke shouldn’t have-”
“I don’t recall that being part of Hogwarts curriculum,” stated Avery.
Luckily, his new tutors didn’t seem to notice. They insisted Harry review the wand movements and magical theory behind each spell he mentioned. They would help fill in gaps on his grasp of the theory. Whenever he wasn’t sure about the wand movement, either Malfoy or Nott would demonstrate. Occasionally this was complicated by the fact that neither men could recall themselves. It became somewhat of a game of magical
“You are a rather odd puzzle,” Asherath continued. “Able to contain a portion of a soul without consuming it. It seemed like a waste, but still fascinating.”
His companions stuck close to him. The walked beside him and took up the stalls around him. Even with this demonstration of unity, the other prisoners kept blatantly looking at Harry. The longer it went on, the more Harry started to recall the attack. Consequently, Harry scrubbed vigorously at his body until Lucius reached over and placed a hand on Harry’s arm.
"Is your animagus form a sugar glider?" Harry asked. He had trouble picturing one of the most notorious death eaters as a cute and cuddly sugar glider.
“I believe you. You know the worst parts of me, and still somehow see the best. I don’t get it, but I’m not going to fight it. I’m going to be selfish and keep you with me for as long as you’ll have me,” Harry said.
“Look over my Defense work?” Theo asked and passed over a scroll. Harry dutifully read it and was amused when half-way through he found a note addressed to him.
“Why only you?” asked Hermione. Harry shrugged and pretended he didn’t know.
“The way he flies,” Harry admitted quietly. “Even in our first year, it was just so… elegant. Which is ridiculous because when he plays quidditch he’s so far from sophisticated. He cheats, and tries to knock me off my broom – he once pretended to see the snitch
“What are those?” asked Theo.
“Basilisk fang?” asked Albert.
“Just a cautionary suggestion,” responded Nott with forced levity. “Given the criticism the ministry is under, you don’t want to be the person to add fuel to the fire.”
“Only because they’re shit and it’s just another way to torture us,” Crabbe interjected. Despite his complaints, Harry could hear him scrapping this plate for every last bit of the meal.
“Expecto patronum!” a voice yelled. A second later a translucent wildcat chased Asherath away. A wounded noise escaped Harry as the dementor was forced away before Harry could ask how he could remove the unpleasant feelings. He didn’t feel any better when it was Wiblin that quickly approached his cell.
“I swear that man was raised in a barn,” Lucius said, exasperated.
“I told you to get out of here,” Burke snarled. Asherath remained hovering where he was, not bothered by the guard’s anger. Burke shivered and started fumbling with trousers, seeking his wand. It wasn’t the man’s sudden panic, or fact that he went from fully erect to limp painfully quick that clued Harry in. It was the full body goosebumps that broke out across every visible inch of his skin. Harry was doing it. He was calling to Burke’s soul the way a dementor could. Harry propped himself up on his elbows but didn’t dare try to escape in case it broke his concentration.
Even though Harry was handed back his school robes, Hale gave him fancier dress robes to wear.
“Nah, Puddlemere United is the only one worth their salt,” announced Crabbe.
Fortunately, the guards were merely handing out dinner and not there specifically for Harry again. Once they got to Harry’s cell, he refused the food. One look at Wiblin holding the food tray caused Harry to lose what little appetite he had.
“It sounds like a horcrux,” Lestrange answered honestly. Even though it was the conclusion Harry had come to, it hurt to have it confirmed by the others. Especially from men who were well-versed in dark arts and thus more likely to know for sure.
“So... Potter, do you want to be with me?” asked Draco.
“In that case, is there anything else you need to know?” Harry offered. He doubted the positive sentiments towards him would last long, but he hoped it would be long enough to get him released from prison. Harry didn’t mind if it also got some of the other prisoners released or a reduced sentence. He knew Ron and Hermione would be horrified by Harry willingly helping several death eaters, but Harry didn’t care. He wanted to help them if he could.
“I thought those robes looked familiar... you know, I didn’t really believe you and Andromeda when you said Malfoy had grown up... but maybe he isn’t as much of a prat after all...” Hermione decided. She didn’t like the idea of Harry feeling like he couldn’t come to her, but she was intelligent enough to recognize she was too close to it. Ron even more so. She’d been glad that he struck up a friendship with Andromeda, though she’d been uneasy when that friendship began to include the Malfoys. Until last night, Hermione had her doubts about Malfoy. She would never be his biggest fan, but was mature enough to recognize he helped improve Harry’s overall wellbeing.
“The first time, well Dumbledore said something about a mother’s love. It’s not that simple, obviously... I have some memories you can see, if you think it will help,” Harry offered thinking of what he heard when near dementors, as well as Snape’s memories.
It had been hard to let her go. He’d felt cold and miserable but didn’t know if that was a side effect of being separated from his horcrux, or just the bleak reality of the war.
“What sort of task?” Malfoy asked, bypassing the issue of speaking Voldemort’s name.
“Just focus on the memory you want me see,” instructed Hale. Harry tried to only think about the memory he was willing to share. He prayed that no memories associated with Burke’s soul got caught up in the extraction. Harry suspected that even if it did, his secret would be safe with Hale.
“I don’t know what Dumbledore has been filling your head with-” he started but Harry cut him off.
“What’s the first spell you’re going to cast?” Hale asked out of curiosity.
“Is it?” countered Harry somewhat hysterically. While he didn’t want his worst memories replaying on repeat, it didn’t seem like a good thing to have the dementors’ curiosity focused on him either.
“Just don’t use it on anyone who is pregnant as it might induce labour,” warned Rabastan Lestrange after Lucius confirmed that Harry had the proper stance and wand movement. “Unless that’s the outcome you’re hoping for.”
Harry felt his stomach drop as his cell door suddenly opened. He was grimy enough that a shower was long overdue. However, all the other prisoners’ cells were also open. It made him nervous.
so I wouldn’t fall behind in my classes.”
Harry snorted. “Well, the summer before my third year, I accidentally blew up my uncle’s sister,” Harry stated and was amused by the intrigued expressions on Lucius’ and Nott’s faces. Nott even looked impressed until Harry clarified he meant blowing her up like a balloon and not into little pieces. Still, he complimented Harry’s fast thinking in using an alias when he went on the run.
“Malfoy, Harry,” Hermione answered.
“It’s beautiful,” Ginny observed.
“I already am,” Burke gleefully stated and went back to working on the second rune. Harry tried to struggle, but the chains already held him tight and only constricted further the more Harry struggled.
Mr. Runecraft turned towards Harry and asked, “Do you deny casting the unforgivable curse?” His words sounded innocent enough but Harry felt a touch of maliciousness it in.
(See the end of the chapter for
game. Only the premise was about sending a niffler into your neighbour’s yard to look for buried treasure. Harry wasn’t sure how they kept track of where their treasure was or where they searched. Unless the bar of soap left enough residue on the wall, they must be keeping track all in their heads. Or they found a way to smuggle in stuff.
Needing a distraction while the other prisoners slept, Harry once again turned to the rocks that lined his cell. He spent a good five minutes just rolling one between his hands as he once again debated whether he ought to perform magic when he knew it was using up Burke’s soul. Every time he glanced at the mirror that he made, which rested on his bed, Harry felt nothing but pure want. Magic was a part of him. He wasn’t going to give it up, consequences be damned.
“Maybe… doesn’t mean I’m going to risk coming back here… if I ever get out that is,” Harry answered.
“Please don’t ask me for a bottle,” Harry turned horrified eyes to Lucius. Harry didn’t know what to do if the man asked for a bottle, let alone used it while he was in the cell across from him. He was certain his accidental magic would cause the floor to literally open up and swallow him whole.
“Er, right but...” he couldn’t explain why he felt he shouldn’t move on, so he lied and told them “there’s no one I’m interested in.”
“Er, Reginald?” Harry said. He felt awkward interrupting their conversation, but was too hopeful to walk on by.
?” asked Pansy.
“What for?” asked Harry. He knew it was because Nott was sticking up for him. Harry didn’t think Nott deserve Burke’s pettiness. He tried to bring Burke’s focus back on him even if it made Harry’s stomach queasy to do so.
There was an uncomfortable silence for a few minutes. John’s question had Harry wondering the same thing. For the first time he realized that neither Kingsley nor Tonks had gone to Hogwarts to arrest him. Did they even know about it? As the silence stretched on, it became clear that no one was going to say who arranged this whole event.
“Quidditch doesn’t count,” argued Rodolphus. “A little bit of violence is expected to make the game interesting.”
“I want to tell you, but I can’t,” Harry said. He looked away from Draco, but didn’t pull away physically.
When supper arrived without Albert rising from his bed, Harry’s concern slipped from Draco and back towards the beaten man. It was only as Harry was lying down for the night that he realized neither of them had been called for a meeting with Hale despite be given the opportunity to shower.
“Harry,” Lucius sounded serious. He waited until he had Harry’s full attention before continuing. “I don’t think my son would want me to say this, but since your interest seems genuine I’ll intercede. I’ve suspected that Draco has liked you for – well, let’s just say awhile.”
“I figured. You wouldn’t be this torn up if it wasn’t bad,” Draco said.
“Unfortunately, no,” Hale commiserated with him.
“Ah! But it speaks to Potter’s character and his previous delinquent behaviour,” stated Runecraft. Harry bristled at that. How could saving himself and his cousin count as delinquent behaviour? It was Umbridge all over again. Harry wondered if she is the one responsible for sending the ministry after him now.
“They sure are restless today,” the captain said. The other passengers on the boat nervously observed the growing number of dementors that came out to watch them. More than one patronus circled them, so none of the dementors could get too close. Harry was sure that Asherath was the one hovering at the forefront of the group. With everyone’s attention off of him, Harry decided to risk giving Asherath a small goodbye wave. As much as he’d grown to like the dementor, he hoped he wouldn’t see him again anytime soon.
“Harry,” McGonagall said once they were back at Hogwarts and away from potential eavesdroppers. Harry tensed as he waited for her to berate him for supporting a known Death Eater. However, when McGonagall finally found her voice, it wasn’t Harry she berated.
“Er...” Harry debated how to tell the man that he wasn’t taking the subject either.
“It feels wrong to say this, but I’m actually looking forward to Snape’s class tomorrow,” Harry said once he finished copying the last spell in Hermione’s defense notes. It sounded interesting.
“Ugh, what is my life?” Harry moaned. A wave of self-pity engulfed him. “I really don’t think humans were built to hold an extra soul,” he whined. He didn’t know what to do, but it was clear that he couldn’t just let Burke’s soul take up space in his own body.
“Just hold this up… and look towards me… now look to right…” Anton quickly snapped a couple of photos then took the plaque back.
Harry thought it was sweet that Crabbe mostly told stories about his son, though it was clear that the man thought his son to be far more intelligent than he was. Harry didn’t burst his bubble. Since a lot of Crabbe’s stories inevitably included his son’s closest friends, Lucius jumped in to talk about Draco as well. While Lucius likewise spoke highly of his son, he seemed more aware of Draco’s flaws, so Harry didn’t question the validity of each tale like he had with Crabbe.
“Then it actually is pretty remarkable. Very few people can get a reaction - no matter how short-lived - on their first try.”
“We should try to add wards to the showers as well,” he suggested. Unfortunately, there was no easy way to draw the needed runes without attracting the attention of the prisoners. Harry worried he could not hold a large illusion with so much scrutiny on him already. They returned to their cells without putting anything in place.
His meeting with McGonagall unfolded in a similar manner as his meeting with Flitwick had. Harry was eager to show her that he was ready and willing to catch up. At first McGonagall was pleasantly surprised at Harry’s progress, but grew suspicious rather quickly. It annoyed Harry, but he couldn’t really blame her. Even before Hogwarts he hadn’t been the studious sort. One of his teachers had called him intellectually lazy. Most of his teachers had been annoyed with his spotty record with completing homework. It was a bit tough to do when locked in a dark cupboard. Harry tried to do as much as he could during his lunch hour at school. More often than not he had to rush through it to make sure he was able to hand in everything. Needless to say, Harry never developed any useful study habits. The Dursleys didn’t care about his grades beyond the fact that he had to do well enough so they wouldn’t be called in for a meeting with teachers.
“I’ve always rooted for the Harpies,” announced Lestrange.
“Your wife,” Harry snapped. It was a juvenile response but it did make Harry feel better.
“Now, don’t be like that, Pots,” whined Mulciber.
“Merlin, no,” Lestrange said. “I wouldn’t subject my love to this place again. I just wish I could see her.”
“It’s my fault she died,” Harry said apropos of nothing, several weeks into their newfound friendship. He had no intention of telling her about the horcrux, but it was the most honest and upfront he’d been about Ginny since his initial reaction to the news of her death. He could sense she was about to offer some platitudes, so he cut her off before she could. If she repeated what the Weasleys had been telling him, he’d lose his nerve. “I know everyone says it’s not, but it feels like my fault. I’ll never get rid of that feeling.”
?” Harry hissed. “Bellatrix is the one killing off her family members. If anyone is a blood traitor, it is her.”
Ron and Neville recounted how the aurors came back a few times and thrashed their dorm. It only stopped once the newspapers started talking about Umbridge and criticizing the ministry. One reporter had caught wind of the aurors’ constant visits to the school and wrote an article claiming the ministry was harassing Harry more by destroying his stuff.
Harry grew increasingly antsy while they waited for the other prisoners to finish up and get in line. He was practically vibrating by the time Albert rejoined them.
“Potter, whatever you had to do during the war... stop beating yourself up over it. You were in a war. It was justified-”
“I made a mirror to go with your brush,” Harry told him and held up the mirror. “If you hand me the brush, I can add some shrinking and enlarging charms so that the guards will be less likely to notice it,” Harry offered.
“I appreciate that sir, but I shouldn’t have a problem in your class. You always make potions so interesting. I wouldn’t want to miss anything,” Harry said. He knew he laid it on thick with Slughorn, but the man wasn’t be suspicious at the flattery. With Harry’s other professors, Harry was more subtle when hinting that he liked their subject enough that it wouldn’t be too strenuous for him to catch up. So far, his professors took him at his word, believing he shared their love and enthusiasm for the subject regardless of how much Harry might have shown in the past. He did have a renewed interest in learning all magical fields, but he certainly embellished for their benefit.
“Get some rest dear,” she told him.
“Could you pull down the collar of your shirt?” Hale asked as he set down the comb and picked up the camera. “Great. Now, tilt your head... Perfect. Keep that expression.”
“Fucking Jugson distracting us during the only time we get any warmth,” Lucius grumbled. Harry figured the man must be upset if he was resorting to crude swear words instead of the more Shakespearean ones he claimed signified his cleverness. Despite Lucius pointing the finger at Jugson, Harry knew his own reluctance to undress was what really delayed them.
“And it worked?”
“I’ll be ok,” Harry insisted when both Lucius and Albert looked reluctant. To prove his point, Harry decided to finally put on his clothes. He didn’t want to move, especially if it would expose him again. To his surprise, he only had to look at his trousers while wishing to remain stationary, and they flew at him as if summoned. In shock, Harry let go of his sheets to grab the clothes as they hit him in the chest.
“I think you have left the man in pain long enough. I will take my pictures immediately, so that he can be healed. I will then continue my meeting with Mr. Potter. Once that is concluded, I will meet with Mr. Nott,” Hale countered. Harry admired the sheer confidence the man had. The guard looked as if he was going to deny Hale’s request, but he must have heard the ‘or else’ warning in Hale’s tone.
“And I can help with alchemy,” concluded Nott.
‘Take a chill pill’, ‘cool your jets’, and ‘keep your shirt on’ are the more 90s sounding slang that Harry probably would have used given the timeline, but I couldn’t resist the more vulgar ‘calm your tits’ since he’s saying it to Mulciber. I kind of hate the expression ‘calm your tits’, but it’s something Mulciber would get a kick out of so it snuck in there.
When he finally felt like he wouldn’t pass out, Harry relinquished his hold on his sheets and opened his eyes. Burke’s vacant stare greeted him. Instinctively, Harry lashed out and pushed the man away from him. Burke’s body toppled off the cot and on to the floor with a slight thump. The body landed facedown and the wand that had been loosely held in Burke’s hand rolled away. Harry vaguely registered the sound, but his eyes remained on the unmoving body. With Burke’s pants bunched around the knees, the legs remained in their bent position, which resulted in Burke’s arse lifted slightly in the air. It might have been a comical sight if Harry wasn’t so traumatized.
“My son doesn’t handle rejection well. You’re one of the few his age that has refused to let him bludgeon his way into getting what he wants. As such, you’ve gained his anger, but also his respect. Unfortunately he now feels too vulnerable to outright ask you for another chance at friendship or more. He’ll try to impress you and when that doesn’t seem to work, he’ll act out to anger you. Whatever gets your attention to validate his worth. He wants you to see him, but he won’t risk the potential further rejection of outright asking you for more,” Lucius said.
Conversations sprung up around Harry, but they were soft enough that they were mostly background noise. Harry appreciated it as he could eavesdrop from one conversation to another instead of being alone with his own thoughts. Crabbe, Nott and Avery were talking about the first meal they wanted to have once they got out of Azkaban. As far as Harry could tell, only Nott was trying to appeal his sentence, but it didn’t stop the others from reminiscing about the days when their meals contained variety and flavour.
“No. You’re staying with me tonight,” he said and helped Harry make his way to Mrs. Weasley to say goodbye.
“It’s perfect,” Harry said again, because it was exactly what Harry would have requested if he’d been awake at the time. Despite his reassurance to Ron, Harry was a little hesitant. It was the second time they told him Ginny had chosen something because she thought Harry would have wanted it. He hoped she’d wanted those things too.
He spent some time levitating rocks again, but this time paying attention to how the magic felt. No longer feeling desperate, Harry grew bored of this task quickly. He took a self-indulgent break to stare at Draco’s picture using the mildest lumos he could cast. It eventually dawned on him that his behaviour bordered on creepy, so he focused on creating pictures of his friends as well. As the memories came to him easily, he produced vibrant photos of them. It was bittersweet to see Ron, Hermione, Neville and Luna, but it was the photo of Ginny that made him pause. He still felt a flutter at seeing her smile. He still thought she was beautiful and strong. The thought of her with Dean still left a bad taste in his mouth. But all of those feelings paled in comparison to the longing he felt moments ago while looking at Draco’s photo.
Harry blinked. He was surprised by the first overt show of support, especially since it was coming from a Death Eater. Someone Harry assumed was a Death Eater anyway.
“You’re not as clever as you think, Potter,” Burke responded angrily. “Doesn’t matter which way you twist it, we’ve got
“Go back to your post for now,” the guard told Wiblin. “You’ll have to make a statement, but for now...” the man gave a tired sigh. After one last glance at Harry, the man walked away. Wiblin dutifully followed.
“I know it was you and you’re not getting away with it,” Burke vowed before ordering “hands against the wall!”
“He’s healthy. As I said, it was a difficult birth, but he’s a fighter... just like his dad,” the woman said kindly. She continued to say more, but Harry stopped actively listening as he cast his mind back to when he’d last seen Ginny, and the terrible reason he’d asked to meet her. It was something he hadn’t told anyone else. He couldn’t, because it was the source of his greatest shame.
“Your dad talked about you,” Harry said. Draco made a face, so Harry quickly added, “nothing embarrassing.” Except that wasn’t quite the truth. He wondered if Draco would be embarrassed to know Lucius spoke about his cute footy pajamas. It was the sort of thing Hermione or Ron might get embarrassed about. Harry just thought it showed how much Lucius cared about his son.
“My thoughts exactly,” Harry responded.
memories are likely to get passed without question. People are increasingly reluctant to speak against you at the moment,” Hale stated gleefully.
The others tried to brainstorm options, but none had suggestions that were feasible and many were deemed too risky. Harry couldn’t vomit the soul. It was probably dangerous to try to coax the soul out as they couldn’t be sure they wouldn’t coax Harry’s soul instead/as well. The prisoners found themselves restricted as they couldn’t access their personal libraries and do some research. In the end, Harry resolved to ask Asherath if the guards let him return when they believed he was the one that ate their co-worker.
“You don’t need us to teach you that spell, do you?” Mulciber teased. “I thought you said you knew sex spells.”
Both Malfoy and Nott were regarding Harry curiously. Harry could tell that Malfoy wanted to ask what the deal with the dementor was.
Harry's efforts had been enough for the Malfoys’ lawyer to contact him. After listening to what Harry had to say in their defence, the man felt he had enough to try appealing Narcissa and Draco's convictions. Kingsley had tried to dissuade Harry once he'd heard, but dropped it after Andromeda spoke to him privately. Harry didn't know what the woman said to him, but afterwards Kingsley was content to let it play out in court without actively trying to sabotage their efforts.
“I can’t think of anyone who would deserve it more,” Harry answered.
! He shouldn’t have had to. I was already all twisted up. It wouldn’t have made a difference to my soul. But it was for nothing. Nothing. Because Neville saved us, and I killed Ginny. I wasn’t justif-tif-right. You had reasons. I did bad things because I was sel-selfish. But you had reasons. You were a death eater.”
“And Theodore? Has my son been aiding in these… events?” asked Nott.
“OK,” said Harry even though he had no intention of doing so.
“Scars?” Harry questioned and looked back towards his soul. He supposed calling the almost empty spaces scars were as close as they could get to explaining it. The thin strands moving from one section to another did seem to be trying to stitch itself back together.
“They still wouldn’t work without having the other mirror with you,” Nott said.
“Oh,” Harry said. “That makes more sense than what Bellatrix said… she said I’d have to mean it.”
“I... alright...”
“I’m not going to beat around the bush,” Draco warned once his house elf served Harry breakfast. “I meant what I said last night. I will help you figure out what happened to your horcrux.”
“We need to know what happened,” said Wiblin, though he wisely did not move any closer. Harry really didn’t know what to say. The ministry had locked him away for casting crucio for one whole second. He didn’t want to know what their punishment would be for stealing someone’s
“How do you feel?” Asherath asked once he was hovering in front of Harry. Next to him was another dementor. Harry thought he was getting better at identifying them, so he felt certain that it was Ishanders with him.
“You seem to come out of it unmolested. I feared that a bunch of criminals who haven’t gotten off in ages would not be able to resist a tasty morsel like you,” Burke stated crudely. Despite his words, Harry could tell the man was more disappointed than worried.
Harry spent most of the reception moving from guest to guest and thanking them for attending. He barely got to eat any of the food Draco had painstakingly selected. Before he knew it, the night was over, and it sunk in that they were now Mr. and Mr. Malfoy-Potter.
“Thanks,” Harry said. He didn’t want to ruin all of Hale’s hard work with the press.
“That’s why you have us,” Hermione reassured him.
Harry tried to glance down but couldn’t see the area that was in pain. Noticing this, Burke summoned a mirror that was at the back of the room. Burke arranged it so Harry could watch as he worked. Before Burke returned to his task, Harry was able to see a black line on his neck.
They were quiet as they sipped their teas. Harry bit back the instinct to apologize in return. As he sat comfortably at Hogwarts, it was hard to recapture the terror he’d felt in Azkaban. However, he only had to think of the other prisoners still in Azkaban, and his stomach churned. If he had to make the choice again, he would still ask Hale to be his judicial-wizard. He didn’t want to hurt the headmaster, but that was one choice he did not regret.
“You’d best finish washing up,” Lucius advised. “The hot water won’t last much longer.”
“Only what I know,” Harry said. They others were quiet as they could all guess Harry had shared his suspicions about Draco being a Death Eater.
“It’s less impressive when you also get a basilisk fang stuck in your arm,” Harry countered. “Though that did turn out to be a handy weapon. Got close to the diary and stabbed it with the fang. Figured if I was going to die, I might as well take him with me.”
Perkins lead him towards a shoddy dock. The wood was uneven and creaked as they stepped on it, but ultimately held their weight. The boat docked and Bradley greeted the men on it with a show of affection that had been absent from the man so far.
"I've got a stone of a porcupine and peacock. Is anyone else an animagus?" Harry asked.
In the rubble that used to be his house, Harry chanced upon a ring. It was a dainty thing but had a fairly large ruby in the center. Hermione, ever cautious, had run a number of diagnostic spells to determine if it was safe, before she allowed Harry to pick it up. Finding no magical spells, dark or otherwise, she didn’t protest when Harry pocketed the ring.
to cast as he normally would.
“What are you hoping to get out of this, Potter?” asked the witch sitting next to Madame Bones.
“I hope so,” Harry said. He placed his empty cup on the desk. He didn’t know how much he should say to Dumbledore, but Harry didn’t feel good about leaving Lucius and the others in those conditions.
“How could I know?” Harry said, somewhat defensively. He let some of his bitterness bleed into his voice when he added, “you never came to see me.”
Theo stood up and everyone was quiet as Crabbe passed off the mirror and Theo went into the classroom.
“Did you give any interviews?” Harry wondered.
“And Lucius? Did he act the same way as Bellatrix?” asked Hale.
“Ugh,” Harry groaned loudly as if Mulciber was seriously inconveniencing him. In reality, he was just really embarrassed. Harry selected one of the larger rocks in his cell and transfigured it into a bottle.
“I’m fine. I’m going to go get some books from my room and start on the assignments I got today,” he said. He took a few minutes away from them to calm down, but was still annoyed that Ron and Hermione immediately cut off their conversation when he rejoined them. It didn’t take a genius to know they’d been talking about him.
Ron and Hermione took a similar stance. They were confused when Harry started defending the Malfoys, and neither were keen to aid Harry’s efforts. Fortunately, they didn’t try to dismantle his progress either. Hermione had assumed he was doing it for Andromeda, even though he told him he would have done it anyway. It was the right thing to do. They didn’t exactly agree, but didn’t hinder him either.
Harry had no photos to offer the others as he did not know their immediate family members.
“If your friend, Hermione ever wants to pursue a career in law, tell her to contact me after she graduates Hogwarts,” Hale continued amused. “Since I’ve taken you on as a client, she has been owling me past court cases she thought would help your situation. She even started sending muggle ones! Even academic texts on the psychology behind the temporary insanity defense, and brain development that impacts decision making skills in adolescents. The ministry isn’t likely to put much stock in muggle laws or theories, but I have found them to be fascinating reads.”
Harry eyed the box, knowing he wouldn’t like whatever was in there.
Before he could catch his breath, Burke started moving his wand again. Immediately, pain blossomed from the area where wand and flesh met. A black mark appeared following the path the wand took.
bound two souls together. I suspect I will have to order more books - from overseas as mine and mother’s day-to-day lives are still scrutinized by the ministry and journalists,” Draco said.
“It rather does when you insinuate things about my character,” Nott countered.
Harry’s eyebrows had flown up at that statement. Lucius wasn’t sure if it was talk of poisons or the ridiculous nickname that did it, but he decided to address the former.
“Draco’s a big boy. He can make his own decisions about whether or not he wants to go somewhere private with Potter,” Zabini said. Harry didn’t know if Zabini was trying to be suggestive, or if Harry’s mind naturally turned in that direction when it came to Draco, but he pictured a few other reasons for why he and Draco would go somewhere private.
The other students were still in class when Harry left the office, so he was able to make his way to Gryffindor tower unhindered. Harry practically ran to his bed and flopped on it with a small sigh. He took several minutes to just snuggle with his pillow and bask in the feeling of a comfortable bed.
“As if you aren’t curious,” Asherath said defensively, “a human able to wield our great magic-”
Supper in the great hall was as awkward as Harry expected. It was a good thing Dean and Seamus had found them in the dorms and asked their questions then, as they provided more of a buffer between Harry and the other students who wanted to ask him intrusive questions. Being surrounded by Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, Dean and Seamus kept the rest of his nosy housemates away. Occasionally someone would ask a question as they passed by, and a few yelled their questions from their seat, but after Ron implied he’d use his prefect status against them if they didn’t piss off, the other students generally gave up asking him questions. It didn’t stop them from staring and gossiping about him. He caught at least five students openly gawking at his tattoo.
“I can ask one of your classmates to be a study partner,” she proposed.
Harry wasn’t completely convinced the plan would work. He knew the minister was desperate to gain public support. Since Harry made it clear he wasn’t going to help with that goal, the ministry would likely fight back by painting him as a delinquent. There was no guarantee that people would believe him over the ministry.
"It's the form my patronus takes," Harry said. He debated for a moment but decided to tell them it had also been his father’s animagus form.
“What happened to the less we know the better?” asked Zabini.
All three of the dementors then turned away from Harry and continued down the hall. The sound of a door opening indicated that they were leaving but it took a while for the mood to get lighter and truly indicate that they were gone. Despite not feeling the full effects of the dementors’ presence, Harry desperately wanted chocolate. He doubted it would be provided when lunch showed up.
“You ought to thank me, Nott,” Burke gloated as Albert’s cell door closed once more. Albert tried to snort incredulously at that but what came out sounded more pained than anything else.
see was guard after guard refusing to heal him,” snipped Harry.
“I’d known your relatives weren’t... the good sort, but I had not imagined they would resort to... well, I should have made more of an effort to check in no matter how busy life got,” she said.
“How do you feel?” Asherath’s voice managed to penetrate through Harry’s panic.
“That one might be a bit hard,” observed Nott. Harry agreed, but wondered if he could ask some theoretical questions. Snape had never been clear, preferring to berate his students for not automatically knowing. And Slughorn assumed Harry had an excellent grasp of potions. Harry feared that posing too many questions would give him away. However, Harry discovered a new-found appreciation for the subject ever since discovering the half-blood prince’s book.
“Did you cast crucio on Bellatrix Lestrange on June 18
“I did. I made a horcrux. It hurt so bad, Draco,” Harry said. He tensed, waiting for Draco to walk out in disgust now that he knew exactly how horrible Harry was. Instead, Draco  eventually resumed running his hand through Harry’s hair.
are those?” asked Hermione defensively.
The tone of voice the two of them used made it seem as if they had been threatening Harry with the curses for the past hour instead of teaching him a few. If Harry hadn’t already been warry of Burke, the smirk he gave at Malfoy’s answer would have done the trick.
“Found him, just, er, hold on,” Harry said. He magically packed his books and notes in the bag, but left the map and mirror out. It was probably safer to cancel the spell on the mirror until he and Draco were in a safe space, but Harry feared that he wouldn’t be able to reconnect. So instead, Harry hid the mirror up his sleeve. He also kept the map activated as he would need to confirm which direction Draco moved in once he was back inside. He would have to rely on his wandless magic to cancel both spells if he was caught.
“No,” Harry replied and he tried to prevent Burke from pulling him any closer.
“Oh, God. That really happened? I thought I just dreamt it,” Harry said, horrified to realize he really had told Draco about the worst thing he’d ever done. Draco gave Harry a moment to absorb the new state of things.
“James?” Harry questioned with a wobble in his voice. There was no question the child was his. Not with his father’s messy black hair, and his mother’s green eyes.
“I actually have a lot in common with him. Too much,” Harry admitted.
Harry feared it might not be working as Burke fumbled with his own clothes as if nothing new had happened. The man pushed his own pants and trousers to his knees before moving to settle over Harry again. Burke gripped Harry’s leg, moved it to his satisfaction, and then just stopped. The man frowned before turning to glare at the dementor still lingering at the door.
“With your permission, I would like to photograph your hand,” Hale said as he observed the hand in question. “And the tattoo you were unlawfully given by Azkaban’s guards.”
?” asked Zabini with a raised eyebrow. He sounded like Ginny had when she’d questioned Harry’s use of Lucius’ first name.
“It’s much more than that,” Lucius countered as he admired his own gifts. “Any wizard would be able to cast these spells with enough practice. Few would think to use them to create such impressive objects.”
Harry stood frozen there for a long time, only snapping out of it at the sound of a stomach gurgle. After one last glance at the room, he turned and made his way to the kitchen.
Lucius looked annoyed but allowed the subject to be changed.
“You think I don’t know that you went crying to the minister about your well-deserved tattoo?” Burke sneered. “Did you think you would get me fired? Well boy, I have news for you. It doesn’t matter who you know, or how much money you have, it means nothing in Azkaban.”
“I don’t take ancient runes,” interrupted Harry.
“Yeah. I mean... you seemed interested, so you can study them some more, or whatever,” Harry said awkwardly. It made Harry happy to see Draco hold his messy notes as close as he held the mirror.
“You went to Slughorn’s party with Luna, right?” asked Theo once the girls left.
“What kind of things?” Ron asked suspiciously. Harry knew better than to admit dark arts were part of it.
“Well, why aren’t you having hate sex with him then?” asked Mulciber nonplused. Lucius harrumphed and glared at the wall separating him from Mulciber.
The hallway lead to a changing room. It looked like the quidditch locker rooms, though there were no actual lockers. Instead the prisoners were expected to place their shoes along the wall, while their dirty clothes were dumped into one communal hamper.
Draco knew Harry would enjoy the food more than the decorations. Draco had not cooked it himself; he was willing to admit that wasn’t one of his many talents. So, he got his house elf to make gourmet versions of all of Harry’s favourites. He asked Mrs. Weasley to help with a couple of side-dishes because he knew from experience that Harry felt no other could compare to her cooking. But the heart of the meal was the desert. Hidden in a scrumptious treacle tart was an engagement ring.
“It’s how I destroyed the other horcrux,” Harry said.
“If you want to keep it high-brow, just call them peasants,” suggested Nott.
Harry glanced at Burke but knew that the man was probably purposely leaving him with death eaters who hated him. The smile Burke gave him as he unlocked the empty cell next to Crabbe pretty much confirmed it. There was a maliciousness in his eyes that made Harry think he’d actually feel safer once the cell was locked and Harry was able to get some distance from the man.
Harry knew it was too much to hope that Burke would be too embarrassed to ever return. Yet it still managed to surprise him when Burke stormed towards their cells. He didn’t expect the amount of anger Burke was displaying. It was a sharp contrast to the mood that the prisoners had been in just before.
They had a pretty decent outline by the time they stopped for supper. Which made Harry feel better when he received a letter from Hale saying the interview was set for Saturday.
“I’m not really eating it though,” Harry did his best to explain based on the knowledge Asherath shared with him. “It’s sort of just sitting there. Dementors just automatically digest souls like we would a chicken. They don’t think about it any more than we would. Their bodies just do it. I don’t know how to make my body actually eat a soul.” Harry would rather not eat someone’s soul, but the too-full feeling was borderline unbearable.
“Join the line, Potter,” Burke ordered. Harry weighed the pros and cons of refusing. As nice as the Death Eaters had been, Harry wasn’t sure if that would last once they could reach him. Harry was especially nervous as he could now see the Lestrange brothers. In fact, most of the men he could see were looking at him curiously now that they could finally observe him. It was a nerve-wracking experience. With a deep breath, Harry moved out of his cell.
“I supposed it’s now time to discuss my client’s compensation,” Hale stated loudly before everyone was dismissed.
“Surely the boy couldn’t have successfully cast the cruciatus at his age,” tried professor McGonagall, which brought Harry’s attention back to the ministry workers.
“Is that what that smell is?” asked Albert as he made a show of leaning closer to Burke, exaggerated a sniffing noise, then wrinkling his nose. “Oh dear,” he continued, “it seems like you didn’t wash it all off.”
Hermione helped him plan a few talking points for the interview. Harry was worried since he couldn’t possibly remember every policy and relevant law, but Hermione assured him that he didn’t need to for that interview. The reporter was more likely to be interested in Harry’s experiences. They just needed to plan which ones related to the problematic policies.
“This is rather detailed,” observed Mulciber.
“Er, in that case, I can pass on a verbal message for you,” Harry offered. Crabbe was the only one that immediately took him up on his offer, though he asked for some time to consider what to say.
“Did he write about me often?” wondered Harry. Harry felt his cheeks heat up immediately and hoped that Azkaban’s poor lighting hid it. Lucius still have him a knowing look.
Harry figured the man was probably planning how he could still enact his Jugson plan. Harry assumed that regardless of his own behaviour, Burke would find a way to get Harry into the showers early. Jugson would probably be the only other prisoner that was rewarded for so-called good behaviour.
They had trouble finding definitive proof, but together they came up with possible theories. The one Draco thought the most likely was Harry, being the Master of Death, was given the option to come back after he’d died. However, because he had created a horcrux – which was still intact at the time of his death – his soul was divided and confused about where to go. One piece could not enter the ring, and the other could not leave and return to the body. Harry had been stuck until the two could reunite.
“I know it is a lot to ask, but I was hoping you could discreetly give this to Reginald Hale the next time you meet. I am hoping he is willing to mail it to Draco,” Lucius said.
“Just saying I’d like to know why they keep stopping by. The rest of us aren’t getting much sleep. Perhaps if they want the boy-”
“This way,” Burke started leading him down the right hallway. But they stopped about half-way through the hallway at a door marked ‘Block D’. Harry wasn’t sure what happened to Block C but it was clear Burke plans to bypass that entirely.
With an exaggerated eyeroll, Theo called out “supper.”
“Breakfast? Tea?” Draco asked.
“I would. I might have said it between insults,” Harry mused.
“Yeah, well, not everyone decided to get drunk, did they?” asked Harry self-deprecatingly.
Harry hesitated, not sure if he really wanted to talk to these men, but he wasn’t sure how long he would be stuck here. It was going to be a long stay if he didn’t talk to anyone.
“What?” Harry asked confused.
“It’s easy to spiral,” he said after a pause. “I don’t know how Sirius did it for twelve years,” he added quietly. Especially since Sirius had been alone, without the support system Harry had.
Mulciber started laughing. “Well damn, Rodolphus! Are you actually thinking of taking him on as an apprentice?”
“Alright,” Harry agreed.
Rodolphus Lestrange was clearly obsessed with his wife, so Harry figured his gift should somehow be related. Unfortunately, Bellatrix was not a pleasant thought for Harry. She did not inspire creativity beyond planning ways to get revenge. In the end, he merely created a sign with her name on it. Every so often, a silhouette that resembled the woman would dash or dance across the letters. Somewhat reluctantly, Harry also added the occasional spell casting movement to Bellatrix’s silhouette. It wasn’t a secure password, but Harry used “Belly” as the trigger to enlarge the sign.
“Yes,” Harry agreed. Even Snape’s class had to be better than actual prison.
“I’m the one who should apologize to you,” Harry admitted.
“Me and Luna? No, she’s just a friend... I knew she’d make Slughorn’s party more interesting,” Harry said.
Harry found out that Draco’s mother had bought him dragon footy pajamas afterall. Being the spoiled brat that he is, Draco had pulled a tantrum because he wanted puffskein pajamas instead. Narcissa had searched five stores the next day until she found a puffskein version. Draco had ended up wearing both sets until he outgrew them. Harry told himself that his appreciation for the story was because he could now tease Draco about his love for puffskeins. It had nothing to do with how endearing he assumed a young Draco looked in footy pajamas.
“So, what did I miss?” Harry asked. He knew they wanted to ask him about Azkaban and the trial, but Harry wanted to put off that discussion as much as possible.
“That’s rich coming from
Aside from resuming their regular tutoring sessions, the other prisoners encouraged Harry to learn occlumency. He told them he was rubbish at it, but they insisted that he had too many secrets not to try. They were leagues better than Snape as a teacher as they took the time to explain the theory behind both occlumency and legilimency. Each man tried to teach him the methods and tricks that worked for them. Sadly, Harry had trouble applying them to his own mind. He couldn’t meditate with Burke’s soul making itself known whenever Harry was still for too long. He couldn’t empty his mind from all thoughts. He couldn’t hold a mental illusion long enough to serve as a barrier. Throwing about random unrelated thoughts and memories in order to prevent someone from easily finding the memory they were looking for worked for awhile, but eventually he lost control over what the person invading him mind could see. This unfortunately meant that both Albert and Lucius saw more than Harry wanted them to see.
Despite his lack of progress with Kingsley, he still made enough waves to get noticed by the ministry workers and start a wave of gossip that eventually landed on some journalists’ desks. And despite his general distrust of reporters, Harry agreed to an interview where he explained he hadn't been able to provide testimony on behalf of Draco and Narcissa due to his coma. Now that he recovered, he wanted to rectify it.
“Many of the clan thought you had somehow stolen our knowledge and were just playing dumb,” added Ishanders. “A few even proposed your immediate death so you would be unable to share this knowledge with others if your kind,” Ishanders paused here as if he was waiting for Harry to gasp in horror... but Harry was already there, for the truth was worse than whatever theories the dementors thought up. Seeing no change in Harry’s expression, Ishanders continued, “you’re lucky Asherath has taken a liking to you.”
“So, you mentioned your stalking habits,” Nott said. Harry blushed. Even if they didn’t know about his crush, stalking someone was questionable behaviour.
When Harry turned back around, Lucius was watching him with a raised eyebrow. The man clearly wanted to ask what that whole scene was about, but the guards started moving them back towards the cells.
Once they got to the locker rooms, Lucius moved close to help. They hit a snag when Albert tried to undress. He couldn’t remove his shirt without considerable pain. Eventually one of the guards stepped in and cut the shirt from his body. Harry briefly hoped the guard would also heal Albert, but he didn’t.
“Just do it,” Burke insisted while pointing his wand at Harry. The other guard also had his wand trained on Harry and didn’t seem inclined to answer Harry’s question. Harry got up slowly and reluctantly turned his back on both men.
“I don’t...” He had been about to say that he didn’t want people to know. Unlike with Umbridge, it wasn’t under a false assumption that it would somehow let Burke win. But it was still too new. Harry was embarrassed by it. He didn’t want to acknowledge it. If he let Nott tell his judicial-wizard, it would be in the papers and everyone would know. If he ever got out, people would look for it almost as much, if not more, than they looked for his scar.
Eventually he couldn’t take the constant guilt, and nervously told the Weasleys it was time he and James moved out. He wouldn’t take away what they saw as their last piece of Ginny, so he assured them they could visit whenever they wanted. He also told Mrs. Weasley that she could babysit him whenever. In fact, he’d probably ask her to do so frequently. It was the least he could do for the good of the whole family. Especially James.
“No,” Harry said loud enough to make everyone else flinch in surprise.
“Are you ready?” Draco asked. He felt Harry tighten his hold on him for a moment before he let go.
So, Harry did the unspeakable.
George snorted unexpectedly. “She didn’t give us details about
“But... would it be so bad talking to a mind healer?” asked Hermione. “Not to get to kicked out, obviously, but to talk about what happened...”
“Did he – was Burke – fuck –” the other guard stuttered.
Hale looked a little awkward as he revealed, “Albert Nott has already covered my fee.”
“Hey!” Zabini said with offense, then he considered it and amended, “yeah, ok, that’s fair.”
After his pockets were emptied, Burke once more reached into each pocket. Harry initially assumed he was just being thorough, but as the man groped closer and closer towards his groin, Harry grew more and more uncomfortable. He glanced at the others in the room, wondering if anyone would notice or comment on how long it was taking Burke to search him but none of the other men seemed to think Burke was being inappropriate.
“Oh, hi Stan,” Harry said as he breathed a sigh of relief that Neville wasn’t in here with him. Harry couldn’t imagine how Neville would fare if faced with Burke’s tender mercies.
“I don’t think you want to risk Lestrange finding out you read her personal mail,” Nott cautioned.
“Yes,” answered Harry, slightly perturbed. And that was the problem with Harry asking them questions in turn. It would unavoidably lead back to discussing souls. When Harry had stupidly asked them what their favourite food was, he was reminded that they only ate one thing: souls. When Ishanders added “the younger the better,” Harry decided he would stop asking them questions. He didn’t want to know.
“I’m not sure you should keep hiding it,” Draco said. He raised one hand to Harry’s face and wiped the tears from his cheek. “If it’s causing you this much pain, you should speak to someone. It doesn’t have to be me, but you need to let it out.”
He left the others to their essays and went searching for the beginner rune books Hermione suggested. Fortunately, enough time had pass that those that had followed him to the library were now genuinely focused on their homework or reading. Very few people bothered to look his way as he made his way to the Runes isle.
