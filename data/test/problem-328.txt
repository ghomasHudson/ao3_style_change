With a short crack, he apparated them from Harry’s Oxford home to Edinburgh, or more precisely, the concierge’s office in Draco’s apartment building, abandoned for the night. The sound of apparation would have Mrs Cambell knocking on his door within moments, no matter the time of night, and he wasn’t in the mood to entertain small talk. Draco cast a spell over Harry, so he drifted along instead of being dragged. Draco took a moment to catch his breath, there was more muscle mass on Harry than he’d expected, and that stirred a curiousness inside of Draco that he wouldn’t admit was anything but platonic.
“That’s... Lovely. It’s good they have a way to show the current students who fought for their school.” She still got uneasy when Fred’s name was mentioned. “I heard the same from Draco, actually. Apparently you two managed to reconcile last night. Took you long enough.”
"Edward..." was all his grandmother had to say to stop his hand mid-air. Harry laughed when Teddy's eyes cautiously met Andromeda's, estimating his chances of getting away with grabbing the book anyway.
He stepped outside, closed the front door and Apparated to the Ministry, swiftly walking along with the throng of people on their way to work. He stepped into an elevator, and stepped back out on Level Two, where he encountered Luna. She smiled sheepishly, "Hello, Harry. How are you today?" she asked in her usual soft tone, "Did you have a good morning?"
Ginny must have seen them through the window, because Albus and James came running down the drive and into Harry, who picked them both up and spun them around, both tight to his chest and their laughs and delighted squeals echoing through the street.
“I thought he would have married that Parkinson girl he was always hanging about with.” commented Neville, “Though I understand why he didn’t. She wasn’t a very nice person, really.”
Harry opened his mouth to protest, to apologise, he wasn’t sure, but he closed it when Ginny stood up from the table and held up her hand, tears now falling freely, asking him to say no more. She wished him goodnight in a broken voice, and went up the stairs to bed.
Ginny giggled, “Oh, Harry Potter… Only you would want the complete opposite of living through someone vivaciously.”
“Good evening everyone. I trust you all had safe travels up here. We’re very grateful that so many of you are here to attend this evening, and even though it is a sad day, I hope we can all remember our dearly departed in the best way possible. This anniversary marks the years that we have spent in safety and peace, and we owe so much to the people who gave their lives for that cause. We can’t bring them back. We can’t erase the memories we have of war and destruction. But we can hold the ones we miss in good spirit, remember them at their best times-”
“I see. Hadn’t expected that. Although this evening has been full of things I didn’t expect, so far.”
‘If he wasn’t, I’d be worried,’ Harry thought, but shook his head, “It didn’t come up in conversation last night. I don’t think arranging centerpieces makes him gay, though.”
They both stood up, and quietly walked side-by-side down the stairs to the front doors. On the last step, Harry suddenly stopped, one foot hovering in mid-air.
Ginny nodded understandingly, knowing Andromeda liked to have time at the beach to reconnect with little Teddy. "You'll be extra popular today then," she said, moving the topic of conversation onward, following him into the kitchen where he had produced the biscuit tin, and set it on the counter top.
Having none of Harry’s modesty, Draco insists his praise, “Even so, raising children is a skill that you seem to be very good at. No surprise there, but co-parenting is arguably even harder. Communicating with each other in a way that doesn’t distress the kids, sharing time on busy and irregular schedules… Worrying about whether you’re there often enough for them to know that you’re still their dad and will still be there for them, or if you’re there too often and infringe on how much time the other parent can take of you sitting about and interacting with the kids, wondering if they’re being silent because they are wishing that you’d leave, or actually listening to what you’re saying, and if they think what you’re saying is acceptable or not, if they are the right things to say, the right answers to the never-ending questions…”
“Because you’re all taking these two,” he pointed to Seamus and Hermione, “Home to my house, but I’m staying a little longer.”
“Malfoy, you’ll always be petty. Not that I know you all that well, but I know you just wouldn’t be you without pettiness.”
Draco smiled, and Harry knew exactly the feeling that Draco had in that moment, the warm and fond feeling of thinking of the giggling face of your children, something that would make any parent smile.
Ron shrugged and reached for a dish of peas, “Dunno. ‘parrantly, Malfoy’s rather a creative chap, clever, too. He’s created a couple'a spells or somethin’.”
“Fantastic! Or, fine... Whichever.” Harry cleared his throat and drummed his fingers against the table. “Anyway, I should go home.”
“Yeah, being all shy though and staying inside the house,” Ginny answered in an aloof tone, slowly losing interest in the conversation as guests started accumulating under the marquee.
Harry shook his head, “The case was brought to us by a member of the muggle law enforcement, a muggle wife of a wizard. She asked us to have a look, because they couldn’t identify it as any muggle-known substances. Sure enough, Appare Vestigium showed traces of magic, but not any kind of magic that we know. It’s new, independently invented, not taught.”
"Yes, yes, I'm aware... Whoosh, gone, no more calling it back. I'll still read it though..." She trailed off, furrowed brows and pursed lips.
The grin on her ex-husbands face had Ginny mock a disappointed shake of the head, before caving and smiling with him. She returned to the seat she was sitting in before Harry's arrival, the chair he'd heard scrape across the floor as she'd stood up. It was half-painted, with a light teal, uneven coat, presumably because Ginny had been distracted while doing the little job. She was reading The Daily Prophet now, the sports section. "Gin," whispered Harry, still smiling, as he was hanging his coat up, earning him not much more than raised eyebrows and a questioning hum of attention being paid, "You know you can't edit it anymore? It's gone, whoosh, printed. Already on everyone's kitchen table. No point re-reading your own article-"
As expected, the letter from Hogwarts was on his doormat, and he opened it to read nothing different than what Ginny, Draco and every other combatant of the Battle, had read. He couldn’t stop thinking about the castle, and every moment encased in its walls. At some point, he had stumbled into a not-so-very-amusing game that compared a regular, happy memory of a place at the school, to the memory of that space during the battle. From a cupboard, he chose a bottle of liquor, and poured a brilliant crystal glass half full. With the glass at his lips and pleasant burning down his throat, he stood at his kitchen window, looking up at the sky. He was there long enough to watch the moon slide across the sky, at a painstakingly slow pace.
Harry busied himself with setting oats and milk out, then found bowls, spoons and a plate. He eyed the fruit basket warily, "Was it apple or banana those two misfits are refusing to eat at the moment?"
“No, I know that, I’m just wondering if I’m going to get in. I gave them my keys. D’you think they’ll wake up if I bang the door hard enough?”
Shifting the now passed-out Hermione from his own arms into Ron’s, Harry produced his keys from his suit pocket and handed them to Luna, who seemed to be the most sober of the six of his friends. She stood for a moment, keys in hand.
“That painkiller you brewed for me works wonderfully, so well that I’ve managed to sleep a full night for the first time in years,” she chittered, taking out a knife and slicing the cake.
Amongst Scorpius’ retellings of climbing a tree to save a snail, eating pancakes and falling over in the mud, Draco didn’t interject, relishing every moment he could listen to his bubbly little boy ramble on about a tree branch as if it was the most magnificent thing in the world.
The next morning, with sun streaming into the flat, Harry pushed himself up to sit with a heavy groan. He stretched, but stopped mid-yawn when he failed to recognize his surroundings. He blinked a few times against the sunlight to his left, through the windows he could see the buildings of a city he couldn’t place, and when he looked around the room over the back of the sofa, he was even more confused. He reached for his wand, but realised he wasn’t wearing his jacket, which was over by the dining table. He got up, intending to retrieve it, but the headache that split its way through his head had him grabbing the sofa for support. He groaned again, and marched his way over to the dining table, where he could see through a doorway into a kitchen, where Malfoy was nonchalantly standing, coffee cup in hand, reading a newspaper. Harry’s brow creased,
He was abruptly cut off by the group that Harry had lost, which had just entered back into the Great Hall from outside. Seamus and Hermione were stumbling, and both bore the traces of recent tears, all red and puffy-eyed, clutching each other tightly, but both smiling in between irregular sobs and gasps for breath. Ron was guiding them both by their shoulders, Neville was doing his best to be assuring, Luna supplying an addition to what he was saying here and there, while Dean was simply bringing up the rear. Harry stood up, concerned, and strode towards them, to which Draco rolled his eyes; 'Always swooping in to save the day…'
“Are you kidding? I was rather a mess. Couldn’t keep anything together for five seconds while I was here. Mind you, I haven’t much improved.” 'Shit. Why would I say that to Malfoy? Now I’m going to get it, big time. Anybody else want an invitation to make fun of my life?'
Wand in hand, Harry charmed a knife to chop an apple, hoping it was bananas which his sons had decided to reject for a while. Really though, it was James who was very picky, and once he had decided that something was not worth eating, Albus would unquestioningly go along with him.
As if he’d barely noticed he was wearing it, Ron looked down at himself and started knotting the waistband, eyeing Harry suspiciously, “Why are you dressed like a pretentious snob, mate?”
Harry smiled, stuffing his hands into the pockets of his trousers, creasing the fabric. “You certainly haven’t aged a day, professor.”
“And why should I have paid attention to the boy in Slytherin who so obviously hated my friends and I?”
“That’s very kind of you, Malfoy, but honestly, I will be fine. Already looking forward to the guilt-waffles that Dean might make tomorrow morning for me.”
All eyes were back on Harry, who quickly shoved his hands in his pockets and hunched his shoulders with a shrug, “I, erm… Borrowed them…”
They looked from each other, back inside, then both started frantically knocking against the glass. Not a budge from either of the men inside. Harry moved to the pigeonhole and started shouting their names through it, Draco still knocking on the glass.
Malfoy nodded, “You just proved you can hold a conversation for more than a few seconds. Impressive. Not unalike to how you look tonight. I hardly recognised you. Well, the scar helped.”
Malfoy laughed, thinking that Harry was joking. When he saw him being serious, he rubbed the back of his neck and cleared his throat again.
“When you say it like that, you just make me look bad. No, I can’t wait for him to go so he can experience Hogwarts. I know I loved every minute of it. Alright, nearly every minute.”
“I’m going to help him learn to do the patronus charm. And he’s going to assist on a case at work, do those count?”
Harry shrugs and pulls her into a hug instead of answering the question. They don’t pull apart until someone walks out with the birthday cake, and everyone starts singing. Victoire blows out her candles, people cheer and the cake is cut.
However many times Harry looked at the clock, it seemed to never get close enough to nine o’clock. He had decided to get through a large amount of paperwork during the morning and afternoon, then spend the evening studying a case involving four anonymous young adults with an affinity for making metal in public muggle places melt in the night, but it had only just gone a minute past seven and he had barely made a dent in that pile of paperwork.
Draco tutted at Harry’s distasteful assumption, “Such violence, Potter? They are philosophers, not Beaters on a Quidditch field. I meant that alchemists like to prove their point by citing past research and tests.”
Finding the whole thing rather funny, Draco looked from Dean and Seamus to Harry with a growing smile, “Do they…”
By circumstances, he meant his trainwreck of a marriage, that now had him so grim about life that only his son could bring him happiness, and as much as he hated to admit it, that was also something holding him back from bettering his life. He couldn’t go back to Africa anymore, not until Scorpius was old enough to understand why his dad was gone for several months, and waiting that long was becoming more unbearable by the week. Only recently had his new collaboration with Geoge managed to alleviate some of his hopelessness, but there was still so much about Alchemy that he had to learn, so much more knowledge to be acquired, if only he could travel back to his acquaintances in Africa.
Harry pulled a face and settled his elbows back down on the table, “That’s what people said before the second wizarding war came along…”
She nodded, and hugged him tightly, and so did everybody else, before they started to walk out of the castle, to where they could apparate.
“Did I...? Oh, Merlin, I did.” The image in his mind and the memory of what he’d said slowly trickled back, embarrassment and regret with them, though they were gradually overpowered by the fireworks of feelings that his action had evoked. He cautiously met Malfoy’s eyes again, “Didn’t I?”
Not moments after he'd mentioned them, two pairs of feet came thundering down the stairs. Well, that is to say, one came thundering down while the other squealed for his brother to wait for him, to no avail. James ran through the hallway and practically launched himself, with a battle cry of "Daddy!" into Harry's arms- prompting a winded 'Oof' from the recipient of a two-going-on-three year old rocket. The younger Albus, still whingeing about being abandoned halfway down the stairs, waddled into the kitchen with a severe case of nearly-two-year-old pouting going on, which his father couldn't help but laugh at. Putting James down and scooping Albus up, Harry pointed out the tin of flapjacks to them both, which cured Albus of his sticky-out-y bottom lip, and made him wiggle out of his father's arms to rush over to the counter. Ginny had gotten up from her chair, now had one foot on the first step up the stairs, but had paused to watch the three of them interact. When Harry turned to see her still there, she placed a hand over her heart with a wide smile, then went up the stairs to get ready for her day.
Pleased to see him, Ginny waves, “Harry, there you are! Could you bring me a glass of punch, I’m in dire need of a drink.”
“Closure can be different for everyone, and if George thinks he can find it here, then I believe that he’s very brave to be back.”
Harry’s voice was gravelly and hoarse, and he had to clear his throat a few times- although Draco wished he hadn’t, before he spoke again.
Dean and Seamus went off to where George was standing, Neville and Luna joined Rolf Scamander by a half-decorated table, and Harry stayed with Ron and the other Weasley siblings to assist in the hanging and spelling of decorations. He was about to charm a stick into a garland, before he hesitated, wand mid-swish. Ron noticed, and finished his spell to enchant the ceiling of the marquee to walk over to him, “Y’alright there, mate? Have you forgotten the spell?”
Harry found himself looking at Draco in a way that one would look at someone who just hit a punch bag so hard that it swung right back, squarely into that someone’s face, “Wow, Draco… I don’t know about her wishing that I’d leave or how much of what I tell my kids is acceptable or not to Ginny, but I agree with the never-ending questions part. Sounds like you’ve got a lot on your plate. I didn’t realise you had kids?” He cast aside the tidbit of gossip that had crossed through the conversation last night, which had in fact let Harry know that Malfoy did have a son, deciding to start anew with the direct source instead.
Knocking on the door to mimic a nursery rhyme, Harry took a step back when he heard the scrape of a chair and shuffle-y footsteps behind the door. "Good morning," he smiled, as the wooden door was swung open, something that was becoming slightly more effort by the day, because of the cascading deep green vines, entangled with pops of purple and bright pink flowers, which had grown down to hang in front of the door. He held up the bag he was carrying, "Brought fresh flapjacks."
“You offend me, Potter. As if I’d let you discover me while I sabotage a party.” Draco said with uncharacteristic drama, but with his trademark sarcasm. Harry chuckled, stuffing his hands into his pockets and looking down, unable to deny the flutter of his insides at the sight of Draco in a crisp white shirt, top buttons undone, and navy slacks. He clears his throat,
His school year abroad had been followed by some advantageous apprenticeships with powerful witches and wizards in Uganda, Mozambique and South Africa, and the sheer enjoyment of being with like-minded people who shared his interest and fascination made him wonder whether he would ever want to travel back home. It took an insistent letter from his mother, expressing how much she missed him, for him to finally return, and when Draco had arrived back in the UK, circumstances managed to wrap him up so much that he stayed.
Draco wobbled his hand so-so, “We’ll call it a colleague circle, friendship with alchemists that you work with won’t last very long, it’s easy to disagree on ingredients or methods, and those arguments can get heated when both parties start pulling out books.”
Heavy breaths finally tore the kiss to an end, foreheads rested against one another as they basked in the sunlight and mutual lust for each other. When Harry finally opened his eyes again, he met the pale blue irises that were barely visible around Malfoy’s wide-blown pupils. Harry chuckled, the situation seemed obscene and was ethereal at the same time. Malfoy didn’t manage to stop his cheeks from lifting into a genuine smile as well, and all Harry could think was that he could stare at that smile for years and years.
Teddy nodded again, this time less sure of himself, and clutched Harry's sleeve. Harry told him to take a deep breath, then apparated to Ginny's house.
Draco laughed, assuming he’d painted a face on a pinecone, and looked inside the bucket as well. He nearly jerked back at what he saw, but instead held the bucket up, “That, my dear boy, isn’t a niffler.”
“You’re both doing better now, then?” Harry asked cautiously, as Hermione had struggled with finding her footing in motherhood, what with there being so few books on the subject for mothers in the wizarding world and her being so book-centred.
Draco stands up and watches him for a few moments with a loving smile, then turns to Harry when he disappears out of sight.
Malfoy looked over at the table to the side of the hall, where drinks were lined up for the guests. A second later, two of them disappeared and instead stood in front of Harry and himself. He raised his glass to Harry, who was rather impressed by the magic, and quenched his thirst with a satisfying gulp. Grateful for the beverage, Harry downed nearly half of the beer before putting it back down. He then eyed the drink, wondering if it was his fifth or sixth of the evening. Or seventh? He shrugged and thanked Malfoy again, who smiled, and politely nodded in response before looking about the room again.
“Please, everyone knew, Fred and George had everyone placing bets on you two. You might want to talk to George about getting a slice of the winnings.”
“If it’s alright with you, I would like to get to know Ted a bit better. I know I told you about Scorpius and it might seem like-”
"I knew those flapjacks would shift the odds in your favour, but I didn't think they'd swing so far your way..." she mumbled, winking at Harry, who pumped a fist in the air, "I should bake more often!" He kissed Albus' head, then picked James up and tossed him into the air, the boy giggling with glee, until Harry planted a kiss squarely on his nose. Protesting being back on the floor, James squealed "Again!" and jumped, throwing his toy. Harry picked it up, and crouched down to him, "Dad's going now, I'll throw you again this evening, okay?"
Malfoy played with his cufflinks for a few seconds, pursing his lips. Harry’s mind was whirring, though quite slowly due to his intake of alcohol.
“Can’t. Hermione enchanted my house against opening spells. And Neville usually silences his entire house from outside noises before going to sleep.”
Draco looked up, smirked- to which Harry’s lungs responded by stopping for a moment, so Harry could cough to regain his breath.
Several minutes later, Harry handed glasses full of smoothie to the people who were awake, now also including Luna and a miserable looking Hermione.
“Seamus and Dean are passed out on top of each other in my living room, d’you think we can wake them?”
“I think you and Ron should stay at my house tonight,” offered Harry, knowing Hermione rarely drank any alcohol, and would feel terrible in the morning, physically as well as being ashamed for letting herself get so drunk, and since Harry could expect no early rising from her hungover husband, he should be there to support her himself. Hermione never really wanted nor needed help, so when she did, he would either make sure that Ron knew it, or that he himself was there to offer his assistance.
Ron’s eyes seemed to bulge as he looked at all of the food, “Blimey… As much as I love eating at home, nothing beats a good ol’ supper at Hogwarts.”
“I think it’s good that George is here.” said Luna, for the first time she’d addressed the group as a whole during the evening, up until then she’d only talked separately to Neville and Harry.
Harry's eyes slid from the contact they were holding with Malfoy’s, to the stone floor. With a witty response lacking, Malfoy’s smile fell, with eyes squinted and eyebrows creased in confusion.
Harry smiled to himself as a rabbit dashed through the dew that glistened over his unkempt back garden, which had grass at irregular lengths, weeds, common flowers and a few bushes growing throughout the sizeable piece of land. He really must get around to tidying all that wild vegetation up... If only to be able to sit at a small table, in his back garden, fresh dawn air surrounding him, while he sipped his morning tea. Another smile, another thought skipped through Harry's mind, one including two young children giggling as they ran through daffodils that he could picture growing right at the back, in the left corner of the garden.
Re-focusing his glazed eyes when he heard the vague sound of a voice, as if he were underwater, he stared at the shopkeeper, who seemed to be getting increasingly nervous and confused, exaggerating the grey puffiness under her eyes. He tore his stare from the robes and turned heel down the street. His heavy coat billowed behind him as he kept a stiff march, passing through one street after another. His erratic corner-taking and sudden decisions to change direction betrayed the fact that a certain destination was not on his mind, but a lot of other things were. Rain now reduced to drizzle clung to every inch of him, he slipped more than once, but the water running down his face disguised his tears and the brisk walk was clearing his head, giving him a chance to think his life over in a rapid albeit less distressed way.
"I should've known," Harry said, berating himself for being so unbelievably stupid. If only he had told someone where he went.
"Ah, Harry, I see you're awake!" Madame Pomfrey said. She was holding bandages in her arms, and she immediately made him lay back down.
"I plan to do this." she suddenly grabbed his collar and spun him around, so he was the one facing the edge. With a great push, he tumbled to the edge, his arms flailing as he tried not to fall. Just as he had admitted defeat and let his body fall back, Pansy grabbed the front of his robes and pulled him close, staring into his eyes with glee.
"I know he's a git, but to leave home?" Ron ran a hand through his hair exasperatedly. "He hasn't slept for a week!"
The two had had an earth-shaking argument before the school year had ended, leaving the Golden Trio scattered and divided. Hermione had tried to fix their relationship, but the broken pieces of Ron's heart had formed a shield in front of his mind, cutting out any love he had felt for Hermione. It had ended in tears and madness, and Draco still shivered when he thought about it.
"Completely barking," Malfoy repeated. "Her father is offering to give her support, and here she is, complaining about it. She has some nerve."
nice, Harry. For me, that is," Draco said. The sound of his name coming from Draco's mouth was intoxicating. Not that Harry would ever admit it. Instead of giving in to his urge to blush, he rolled his eyes and continued to fill his plate with food.
Hermione entered Harry's office with a file in her hands, startling him. He had been staring into space once again, so he took a bunch of papers and started rifling through them to look as if he'd been working. The Minister frowned disapprovingly as she took in his disheveled state.
"Alright," she relented, letting him jump out of the bed. "Just don't forget to come back when you get a headache!"
"We'll get past this," Harry said soothingly, repeating Draco's previous words. "It's just a silly crush. She'll get over it."
"-An apology I will gladly accept," Malfoy carried on, smirking. "As long as you promise not to do it again. We're a team now, Potter."
“I’ll go make you some tea, alright?” she said gently, smoothing the hair out his eyes. Harry nodded, and watched her as she got up from the couch and made for the kitchen.
"Then don't give up," Malfoy said softly, resting a hand on the shorter man's shoulder. Harry's heart caught in his throat.
"Her children certainly aren't making matters easier," Harry chirped in. The woman reappeared again and opened the door wider for them to come inside.
Harry pouted a little. Draco leaned in to kiss it away but snapped his head back when he heard Slughorn approaching them. The professor had two vials and gave one to Harry and Draco.
A few minutes later, the pair found themselves in front of the familiar wall. Harry concentrated and paced around outside, and the large doors presented themselves. Harry and Draco pushed them open, entering with identical expressions of relief.
"Obviously you'd think that," Draco said, rolling his eyes. "Which is exactly why I didn't want your ass to know."
"I came here to say that I love you back," Draco whispered in his ear. Harry gave him a shit-eating grin.
”I-“ Harry thought long and hard. “I- I don’t know. I haven’t given it much thought-but I know I do want to give it a chance. Give you a chance.”
"I hope you know, Smith, that homophobia is a form of discrimination. And we do not allow discrimination in our school. So if you know what's good for you, leave."
"You weren't supposed to survive, Harry," the Slytherin hissed. "You were supposed to die, along with all those other useless witches and wizards!"
"I'm so sorry I'm late!" Harry panted, bending over and resting his hands on his knees, trying to catch his breath. Henley glared at him, subtly glancing down at his watch.
"Well, find one quickly," Hermione said. "This murderer is cunning; no doubt they'll try to leave the country soon."
"Since now. Now hop to it," the brunet said, winking. His face slowly flushed red and he quickly hurried up the rest of the stairs.
we tell Granger?" Draco groaned. They walked through the doors and went to sit at their regular table. Draco hesitated.
Malfoy looked surprised but considered it nevertheless. "He is a rather rich bloke. Maybe someone wanted in on all that money."
Harry nodded slightly. Professor McGonagall took out her wand, gave a flick of her wrist, and out came the Pensieve from where it rested in the corner of the room.
Harry sighed and set her down. Draco wrapped an arm around his waist. "Stop spoiling our daughter, Harry, or she'll start asking you for piggy-back rides!"
"How's your hand? Are you alright?" Draco said, taking Harry's hand in his and looking at the burns with anxiety laced in the lines of his face.
"One would think, as Minister, you'd have more pressing matters to attend to, Granger," Malfoy said lazily.
"Well, she can bloody well choose who she wants to screw, can't she? If she had feelings for you, she shouldn't have strung me along! She should've let me go if she really loved me!"
"Why are you in the girl's bathroom?" he asked, coming inside and wrapping his arms around Harry's waist. Harry leaned his head against Draco's chest.
The man in the photo had long dark hair and black, hooded eyes. But that wasn't why Harry was shocked. He was talking about the fact that the man had been convicted of rape thirty years ago. He got a seven-year prison sentence.
"I did. But Draco slipped his own into my pocket when I started to step forwards," Harry admitted, blushing. Everyone looked at the blond, but he paid them no heed. Rushing forward, he took Harry's face in his hands.
"Agh!" he clutched his scar and fell off the bench, blacking out as the pain blinded him and took control.
"I don't like him. You need to stop hanging out with him," Harry said with an irritated tone. The blond’s eyes widened in incredulity.
"Let's ask him if anyone ever showed interest," Harry said, whipping out his phone. He dialed Henley's number, and a soothing male voice greeted him on the other end.
"A new house, hopefully," Harry grumbled, before taking the doorknob and jostling it, trying to open the door. Malfoy pushed Harry's hand away and whipped out his wand.
"I'm not letting you leave until you tell me," Draco said bluntly, resting his back against the door. Harry glared at him before sitting down on the bed submissively.
Hermione cringed into Ron’s arm at the outburst, who promptly put himself in between Harry and Hermione, looking frightened.
"Someone lives here?" Malfoy said disbelievingly. Harry rolled his eyes at the blond and went up the stairs.
Later that night, Harry's head was filled with paranoia, and the imprint on his mind feasted eagerly on it.
"But he comes with me," she said, shaking Dylan for emphasis. Dylan swallowed largely, large tears running down his cheeks. She walked back into the house, and Harry followed her with his hands up. He could feel dozens of worried and concerned eyes on him, but he couldn't bring himself to care. The only thing he cared about at that moment was seeing that man away from Molly.
The pair sat down on the top end of the table, far away from Hermione. She sent a sad glance their way.
"They aren't very grand to me!" Henley said, an amused sparkle to his eyes. "I don't want any, kiddo. It's not much to wrap your head around."
Harry and Draco took their seats at the stands glumly. As the two couldn't be apart from each other without tearing their chests open, they had to give up their places on their teams. It was Gryffindor versus Hufflepuff, and Harry had a shrewd suspicion that his house wasn't going to do too well, as it consisted mainly of first and second years. Ron, who was now team captain, was the oldest by far.
Malfoy wanted to date Ginny! The thought made bile rise in Harry’s throat, and rightfully so. The thought of someone like Malfoy laying even a finger on poor, precious Ginny made him shudder in disgust.
Draco and Harry stood at the platform, watching as countless children boarded the train. They watched as Scorpius boarded the train with teary eyes. Lily tugged on Harry's robes.
The old woman sighed. "Professor Slughorn has told me it is because of the infusion of wormwood that was added in the Veritaserum. That, added with the unicorn horn and flobberworm, created the possibility of making the Juramentum Dolor potion, also known as the 'oath of pain'. I believe Professor Slughorn told you to wear gloves while handling those ingredients?"
"It must have to do with the bond between you two," McGonagall mused. She walked forward to lend Draco a helping hand, which he took gratefully.
? Wait..." realization dawned on her. "You mean... you... HOW COULD YOU, MALFOY?" she screamed in horror. Everyone dropped their wands at the shrill noise and turned to watch the pair. Professor Flitwick all but flew to their table at the back.
"Wait- wait," Draco cut in. "How did you find this? I thought all the books on Horcruxes had been removed from the school library?"
"Oh," she said disappointedly, coming over to sit in a chair by Harry's bed. She ran an anxious hand through her thick curls. "I'll understand if you want me to leave, by the way."
He and Draco had become good friends in the past few weeks. Always being around one another had formed a reluctant friendship between the two boys.
She spun the bottle, and as it started to slow to a stop in front of Harry, he flicked it away, and it landed in front of Hermione. Everyone laughed.
, then," Malfoy said, his pale face slowly filling with color at his moment of weakness. "Let's use that. Any reasons she could have been feeling
Molly came back with a thick piece of parchment in her hands. Malfoy took it from her outstretched hands, much to Harry's protest.
"Why do you always have to be so dramatic, Potter?" Draco said, rushing forwards and crushing Harry's head to his chest.
The blond's eyes slid open, and he sat up, his disheveled hair hanging like a curtain over his eyes, which widened slightly as he remembered the events of the previous day.
”I was showing the new employee around,” he explained. “She’s pretty nice. I’ll have to introduce you guys sometime.”
"I know," Harry murmured tiredly. He stretched his arms and yawned. He was so exhausted, and he had a pounding headache. But he wanted answers.
"Peter," Draco replied nonchalantly. He walked over to where Harry was sitting on the couch and bent down to give him a kiss. However, the brunet was leaning away, eyes narrowing.
Harry and Malfoy walked side by side behind Professor Sprout. She led them to the Headmistress' study, the same study that Dumbledore had once resided him. Before...
"Why not?" the Headmistress asked. "Draco here told me, while you were unconscious, that you've been murmuring in your sleep. And you also have trouble sleeping, do you not?"
They continued their walk to the Headmistress's office, but Harry's mind was still burning with questions.
"I lo... you," Harry mumbled, before slacking against Draco. The blond's heart sped up as he grabbed Harry's wrist and pressed, trying to get a pulse. He relaxed when he felt the pulse, however faint it was. The doors to the Great Hall pushed open once again, and numerous students poured out to circle Draco and watched him weep. Draco glared at them.
”Oh, Ron, don’t be so dramatic. It can’t have been that bad. I heard those two, Pansy especially, have really changed since everything that happened.”
Harry grinned gratefully, but his stomach tightened a little in worry. What if he took too long? Would Draco go and find someone else?
Harry clutched at his abdomen with trembling fingers as the Slytherin before he cackled, arrogance flooding his image.
"For fuck's sake, Malfoy," he gritted out, willing his voice not to shake. "Get rid of this damn curse!"
"The commitments, the responsibilities. And don't forget those devilish little blighters they make after themselves," Henley said. Harry raised an eyebrow.
Lost in his thoughts of gratitude, Harry hadn’t realised he was running dangerously late for Potions.
Rob tried to shake his head, visibly trying to fight against the influence, but his mouth betrayed him. "Lola would often beat her up out of anger. Molly was frightened of her mother, but she thought she knew best. Lola wasn't right in the head, either."
Harry, who was laughing, brushed it off of Draco's face, his expression looking considerably traumatized.
"You mean to say you're making us your lab rats?" Harry growled. Draco put a soothing hand on Harry's back, making the brunet flinch. Draco's hand stiffened, and dropped down into his lap.
Draco shrugged and proceeded to follow the two. Harry followed reluctantly but didn't say anything. They went over to a secluded corner of the room filled with their classmates.
Harry entered the office and gave a shriek of surprise, stumbling, and spilling caffeine all over himself. Malfoy looked at him, unimpressed. Harry cursed him, grabbing a wad of tissues off the desk and wiping scalding hot coffee off his clothes.
Harry nodded, tears filling his eyes. "Everything's gone wrong, Draco! Hermione was supposed to be my friend! I don't want our friendship to fall apart."
"What do you want?" he asked, hating himself for the shake in his voice. It was the place his mentor had died, after all. The memories of that night still haunted him in his dreams.
"It's only twenty words! You're not going to find anything from it!" he said, looking at the pair as if they were demented. Malfoy chuckled.
"Think of them, then!" Harry tried again. "What would they think of you? They're supposed to look up to you!"
Harry lay on the ground with his limbs at odd angles. His glasses were askew, and blood was dribbling out his mouth. Draco's mouth stretched open in a torn cry as he went to crouch down by his lover. Harry's eyes were fluttering, tears streaming down his face.
"You don't look fine at all. God, you're as pale as a sheet!" Draco quickly made his way over to Harry and pressed a light hand to his forehead. "And you're boiling! Come on. We're taking you home right now!"
When the trio didn't respond, she spoke again. "Let's assume this is the correct theory, for now. Potter, you must take note of any new symptoms. I'm trusting you to do that. Any ones that don't fit the ones listed must be given in to Madam Pomfrey."
"Mama, Lucy won't share!" the old woman sighed in frustration and smiled apologetically at the two young men, before disappearing promptly.
They scurried out of the Wing and left the matron to tend to her blistering headache. They both scowled at each other when they came to their joint room. They hadn't slept in it yet, and they weren't looking forward to it.
When he Apparated back inside him home, he saw Draco sitting on the couch with his head hidden in his hands. The blond looked up when he heart the familiar
Harry sighed and walked through the small group of students towards Slughorn, ignoring Ron's pitying gaze. He brushed past Malfoy and went to the supply cupboard to get the ingredients for the Veritaserum. Once he had his arms filled to the brim with the ingredients, he gingerly made his way back to Malfoy's table. He all but smashed them onto the table, and Malfoy flinched.
"Hey! What- what the fuck is going on?!" Draco shrieked, looking at where Harry's and his' conjoined hands were glowing brightly. McGonagall's eyes widened.
"Thank you," they said, bowing their heads slightly, filing out the room once she dismissed them with a nod of her head.
"Harry! Oh, Harry!" Hermione exclaimed, rushing to the back of the classroom where he sat. "Are you okay! I went to visit you in the Hospital Wing but you weren't there! Harry, you should be in bed right now!"
Harry gave Malfoy one last glance before letting out a breath he hadn't known he'd been holding. He held out a reluctant hand.
Ron paced the boy's dormitories with tears glistening in his eyes. Harry looked at the floor with guilt prominent on his face.
"It'll never be alright! It was my fault! I should've gone through it while there was still time! I never should've gone to the Ministry on my own! I never should've-"
"Fine, Potter. You can hold the shiny case file," Malfoy said, rolling his eyes, perking himself on the edge of the desk, and trying to look over Harry's shoulder at the writing.
Draco stole his lips and all remained forgotten except the fact that Draco Malfoy was an excellent kisser.
"That's hardly my problem." Nevertheless, Malfoy turned over to face Harry, his blonde hair shining silver in the moonlight that slithered through the curtains.
"Harry, I hope the fact that Albus Dumbledore is human doesn't shock you," the Headmistress said gently. Harry didn't say anything.
"Are you saying an innocent woman's life isn't worth the effort?" Malfoy asked, his eyes cold and hard. Harry felt a stab of shame well in his chest.
"In our fifth year," Harry began slowly. "I would dream of the Department of Mysteries. I would try to get through the door that led to the Prophecy. You know, the one that said I was destined to defeat Voldemort and shit."
"But, Harry. Why this guy? What's so special about him?" Ginny asked, giving Draco a questioning look.
"I feel bad for the poor woman," Draco said suddenly. "Her mother just died and there is no one to comfort her."
"I am Sirius, Harry," his godfather smiled warmly, his eyebrows furrowing slightly in concern. Harry backed away.
”Shh, I have you,” he said, sounding a little bit confused and wary, but also extremely concerned. “I’m sorry.”
"The guy raped someone! You think he's fit to receive kind treatment?" Malfoy said, a little outraged. Harry put his head on his desk and shook his head minutely. What Rob had done was unforgivable. But still.
"I thought you might be able to erase it! There's something seriously wrong with him!" Madam Pomfrey said, looking between her patient and the Headmistress. She had never felt more useless.
"Leave it, Potter," he snarled, snatching his arm away and exiting the cafe. Harry looked on with longing and guilt.
"Why not?" Harry asked. "Why should you decide? I like you, and that's not going to change, you git!"
"Yes! I don't want them to think I'm some idiot-" suddenly, Draco had wrapped his arms around Harry's waist and pulled him into his chest.
Rob looked to Harry, silently asking for permission to divulge what had happened to his friend. Harry shook his head slightly. "Oh, nothing really, just wanted to ask if you'd like to go again."
"You don't return my feelings," Hermione said, giving him a small smile. She ducked her head to look down at her shoes. "And I'm just another girl that has fallen head over heels for Harry Potter."
Harry sighed gratefully. They let go of each other's hands and went into the Hall. Harry went to sit down next to Ron, across from Hermione.
"Happiness," Hermione said with a patronizing tone, already falling back into herself. "Anger, sadness, just normal moods one would feel every day."
Draco stiffened beside him, but Hermione chirped in. "I mean, he hasn't called me a mudblood this year at all."
Harry gave her the look. He had been giving it to her quite regularly now. One of his eyebrows rose as his mouth tightened in a grim line.
He saw the blue ticks next to his message, but the blond sent no reply. Harry set his phone down on the nightstand and changed out of his clothes, clambering into his bed with exhausted limbs. He managed to muster up enough energy to send one final text.
"Potter! Potter come quick!" he heard. Harry bounded down the stairs but Malfoy was nowhere to be seen.
"We're not doing this for Ron," Hermione said, anger entering her expression. "We're doing this for Fred Weasley."
"Oh, come on, mate!" Ron tried to reason. Harry glared at him through the peephole of Grimmauld Place.
"What face?" Harry asked obliviously. He looked up at Draco and gasped when he saw the blond's eyes.
"While Slughorn was testing out new ingredients to substitute the old plant, he stumbled across a combination that brewed quicker than he could have ever hoped for!" Hermione said, her eyes all but shining with happiness.
That made Harry's face erupt in a smile. He pulled Draco back by gently tugging on his hair and wiped away his tears.
"Merlin... this is harder than I thought," Harry said dejectedly. The portrait swung open and Harry and Malfoy gaped at each other.
Harry thought about it for a moment and concluded that he probably shouldn't answer Malfoy's question since the answer was
"I've been looking for you for ages!" Draco exclaimed dramatically once he had caught up to the pair. His arms made a motion as if they were going to wrap around his boyfriend, but they fell limp at his sides at the sight of Ron. Ron noticed.
Harry walked through to the fireplace of Grimmauld Place and looked around appreciatively. To him, there was no place like home. He dropped himself onto the couch and flung the files onto the coffee table. He flinched when his phone rang.
"You can't blame us, mate!" Ron protested. "We're so happy! I knew it was a mistake letting Zander on the team..."
"They're able to share their energy with their mate," Pomfrey explained. "He will heal himself with your magic."
"Ah!" Draco shrieked as a fake spider fell from mid-air and landed on his nose. "Get it off! Get it off!"
Harry looked at Draco as if he was expecting him to flinch or interrupt. Draco said nothing, however, urging Harry with his eyes to carry on.
Draco sat down next to Harry and gave his hand a comforting squeeze, bringing it up to his lips to give it a soft kiss too. He saw Harry mumble something incoherent before tugging his hand out of Draco's grasp. It fell off the bed and remained there, limp. His lover sighed.
A cough made him jerk back, pulling out his wand with narrowed eyes. He flushed when he saw the familiar blond standing in the doorway. Malfoy glared at him.
"Oh, Harry, don't cry." That only made him cry more, wailing like a child into her shoulder. When he finally pulled away from her, he saw that she was slightly pink in the face.
Professor Flitwick called over to the two from where he was talking with the Professor Sprout. "Boys! The Headmistress is asking for you!"
"Potter... you are testing my patience," he said lowly. Harry clutched his head and leaned against the basin. "What the fuck is wrong with you?"
"Calm down," he whispered in Harry's ear. Harry gasped heavily at the feeling of Draco's breath against his skin and relaxed considerably, becoming limp in his arms. Draco stepped away from the window, pulling Harry back with him.
"You're eyes!" Harry exclaimed. This was unreal. Was Draco pulling a prank on him? The only people who had eyes like that were-
Harry's jaw dropped to the floor. Hermione burst into tears and quickly ran out of the bathroom. Harry tried to process what he had just heard, but his brain refused to believe it.
Harry flipped through his potions book hungrily, trying to find the page with the instructions on how to create Veritaserum. Five minutes later, Malfoy snatched it from underneath him and turned to the correct page in less than a second. Harry gaped at him, and he sighed.
They entered the classroom to find wide eyes staring at them. Professor Flitwick was watching them apprehensively; he knew first-hand how much Harry and Malfoy fought. Having them seated together was like begging for a World War III.
"Oh no, I'd never do that," Harry chuckled. The laugh didn't quite meet his eyes, and Ginny frowned.
”I’m allowed to have a life outside our relationship, Potter,” he says. Harry tenses. “You don’t get to decide who I talk to. I certainly have never told you to stop talking to someone because of petty jealousy.”
"Alright, Potter. You are going to cut up these flobberworms while I crush these unicorn horns," Malfoy said dismissively. Harry was affronted.
Draco Malfoy was a fucking hero. After all, he was the one who had thrown Harry his wand when he needed to kill Nagini. He had also saved Harry Potter in Malfoy Manor by lying to his father when he was asked to identify him.
Harry was indifferent. “Even if they have changed, it doesn’t change the way they used to treat us.”
"Ah, Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy." The door opened fully to reveal a woman in her mid-thirties. She had dark brown hair and dull eyes, and a small child tugging at her clothes.
Harry lurked at the back of the classroom with Ron, praying to God that they would be paired with each other.
Harry and Ginny stand at the edge of the Weasley’s orchard in comfortable silence, watching Bill and Fleur greet the arriving guests on Victoire’s behalf, and casually commenting on their clothing choices, until Harry turns to her with a confused crease in his brow,
'If only Dobby had been here to experience this!' Harry smiled at the image of Dobby in potions class, or charms, probably turning pieces of parchment into birds.
Draco glances over his shoulder at Harry with a barely contained smirk, a simple look conveying a simple, ‘Really?’.
“There shall be more guests arriving soon, you might be more comfortable near the entrance. You’ll be surprised how relieved some of your peers will be that you’re attending this evening, mister Potter.”
“I said to Ginny, y’know, when the invitation had arrived, that there are a lot more good memories of Fred here, than bad ones. I guess she just…” Harry broke off, wondering how to phrase what he wanted to say, “Maybe she thought that the bad outweighed the good...”
The crack of dawn- the promise of a new day, accompanied by the vivid pink and orange of a sunrise, reflected in the trademark round glasses that sat upon Harry Potter's nose. His kitchen window had the most breathtaking early-morning view he'd come across, even if he may say so himself, especially since he was drinking a cup of steaming tea while soaking up the first golden rays of the day.
“So, from what I can gather after that little exposition, it’s a bit tense between you and Scorpius’ mum?”
The latter gratefully took the glass from him with a half-hearted smile, and Harry patted her shoulder, letting her know everything was okay.
He suddenly turned to Harry, a flush of red to his cheeks from the all of the buzz around him, "Can we Apparate to Ginny's house today?"
Harry and Ron laughed, and the trio chatted on, until a clinking stilled the conversations in the entrance. Everyone turned to face the far end of the hall, where a couple of teachers had gathered, professor McGonagall at the centre.
At the far end of the Great Hall, another figure was keeping her eye on the proceedings, until her calculated gaze fell on Harry. She started marching in his direction, robes billowing out around her, pointed hat bobbing with every step.
Once home, he puts his sons to bed, and after a few attempts to read a page of a book, Harry gives up and settles into sleep as well, wiped out after the day.
The arrangement that Harry and Ginny had come to suited them both as a perfectly fine solution to a relationship that had gone unattended and ultimately fizzled out, something that had saddened them both greatly but didn't hold against each other. Busy schedules from high-demanding and time-consuming top careers, mixed with a close and large family that was regularly visited, left them with few moments to spend, just the two of them. A rocky start to a last year's Quidditch season on top of an already stressful day job and the resulting lack of sleep for Ginny didn't improve her irritability. The joint decision to terminate her third pregnancy in its early stages was something that Ginny felt grateful for, however sad it was to lose a child. She felt better now, knowing that it had been the right choice. She couldn't imagine any of the steps that she and Harry had taken to end their marriage would have been very pleasant with a newborn involved, and she had never wished to bring another child into such a tense and unhealthy environment.
He ended up sitting in his velvet high-backed armchair, tumbler with gin on the side table, turning the letter over and over in his hands. Finally, with a heavy sigh, he broke the seal and pulled the letter out of its envelope.
When he looked around the castle again, from where he and his former professor were standing, it was as if a lens had fallen over his world. Everything was eerily green-blue tinted, dusk-like in a way, and an ominous tone distantly rang, as if he’d just come back to consciousness after being whacked over the head, hard. Debris scattered the floor, holes were blown through walls, stairs and arches, the dust still hung in the air. Dark puddles and crumpled heaps; people, bleeding, their wands still gripped in their cold hand.
“No, Harry, you don’t understand,” Hermione interjected with a huff, “Rose recently became a little bit picky, and she lost the tiniest amount of weight, and now Molly simply will not relent in constantly feeding my children! She says she won’t have any grandchildren of hers being bony little scamps. Hugo’s not even six months old yet and she’s worried about him growing up skinny, for goodness’ sake!”
“I’ll have you know that Uagadoo teaches advanced alchemy, and that I owe my career, and by extent, my life to that school.”
Harry didn’t much like the amount of enjoyment that Malfoy seemed to be taking in this, though he couldn’t deny liking the look on his face when he took a few steps closer, now barely inches away from him. Harry attempted to apologize, running a hand through his dishevelled hair, but Malfoy stopped him with a hand on his arm.
“It’s wonderful to see so many people together for a good time, young Victoire is lucky to grow up in such a large family that loves her. I’m grateful that my cousin can experience the Weasley's warmth.”
A few moments of silence passed, both of them lost in thoughts too intimate to tell, until finally Harry picked up on something Malfoy had said and he had overlooked at the time.
Barely following what she was saying, he looked at her as if she were on the other side of an opaque window, “Are you saying that you knew I liked him in school?”
“Yes, well, you can’t escape dropping into conversation completely when you bugger off to some mountain for potions classes.”
Harry nodded, as there were remarkably many of them bustling about, even though the law had proclaimed all elves as ‘free from enslavement’. They were also all fully clothed in proper garments, something Harry had never witnessed.
You yourself were present during the Battle, and thus to you we extend this invitation to attend the Memorial of the Samaritans, to remember our dearly, inequitably departed, and their sacrifice for what they believed in.
“You know, you’re actually not that bad. Well, back in the portrait gallery, you weren’t. How can it be that we never got to talking before now? You're very easy to talk to when you're not being snarky or otherwise busy saying my last name as if it's some contagious disease. I'm confused as to why we were never friends during our school years. "
“Yeah, but that’s not a party conversation,” Draco murmurs, as he’d become increasingly aware of the nosy glances directed at their way.
Harry half-expected Malfoy to slap him after that comment, so the moment that their lips met again was a relief, if not confusing at worst and complicated at best. Harry managed to drop his thoughts though, and slide an arm around Malfoy, pulling him closer, as Draco tilted Harry’s chin up with his hands. When Harry went to break apart, Draco placed a hand firmly behind his neck, bringing him back in, sliding his fingers into the mess of hair, and Harry melted in the grasp Draco had on him.
As you may be aware, the tenth anniversary of the notorious Battle of Hogwarts is anon approaching. To our great sorrow, many of our dearest friends gave their lives to safeguard our school and conserve our liberation during that time.
He looked over at the suit that was hanging on the door, chosen for him by Luna for the evening's occasion. It was tastefully black, but was fleetingly highlighted in a deep red sheen as the fabric moved under lights. There was a black button-up and waistcoat to match, but no tie as Harry disliked the things. His cufflinks were miniature versions of Hogwarts’s seal in gold, the quartet of tiny gilded house animals idly flicked their tails and turned their heads, flapped their wings or slithered into a coil, enrapturing Harry as he held one of the cufflinks between his fingers. He put it back in the box next to the other and looked at the clock again; three past seven. With a sigh, he forced himself to focus on the document in front of him.
He picked up his drink and wandered on after Harry, curious as to what the upset was about this time.
“Oh…” Unable to stop the subconscious action, Harry, looks over at the Burrow. Ginny notices his staring, and gently nudges his arm,
A gusty breeze taunted him on his wander up to the castle, so Harry charmed his hair back into place once he had arrived at the gigantic front doors. They were swung wide open, welcoming the evening’s guests, though Harry seemed to be the first guest there, as far as he could tell. His wrist clock informed him that it was twenty-five to nine. Harry looked up again when the sound of footsteps caught his ear. Inside of the great hall, house elves were pottering about, charming flowers and candles in a flurry of light and colour. Yellow, purple, pink and white plants all braided into garlands that hung along the stone walls, while wreaths covered in blue, pink and red spiralled together around clusters of candles as centerpieces on the as centerpieces on the immense tables, as well as on tall, smaller tables dotted about the entrance space, crowded around and dispersed throughout the hallways down to the front doors. Harry watched in awe as the flowers bloomed in mid air to the house elves’ careful motions in orchestrated perfection.
Draco managed to make it to his bed, only to lay awake with butterflies in his stomach, pondering the evening’s events, going over and over the conversations he’d had with Harry, and… Their incident in the living room. He permitted himself to wonder- not hope, just wonder…
Malfoy didn’t answer immediately, he simply looked at each of the faces for a few moments, then at Harry. His voice was distant, more disconnected than he’d been during the minutes prior.
She rolled her eyes, “Oh Harry, you’re hopeless. Malfoy wants you. There, is that put plainly enough for you?”
“I heard you get back home, and since it’s raining terribly out there, I was sure you’d need something tasty to lift your spirits.”
“Oh, well… She didn’t want to come tonight. Made up her mind the night the invitation arrived, and you know how headstrong she is. It’s sensitive, you know? Didn’t want to push her…”
"I don't sense any evil entity inside of you, Harry," she murmured after a few minutes, letting him go again.
Harry's eyes widened. If he died, Draco would probably die too, as they were bound together. By soul or by body was unknown.
"What? We followed all the instructions! We did nothing wrong!" he said. "What could we have done wrong? I'm going to go and ask Slughorn!"
"That's not the point," Harry said quickly. "We are interrogating you, not looking for other suspects. We need to know what you were doing on the night of the murder."
"Is there a problem?" Molly asked, looking in between the two with furrowed brows. A deep flush spread across Harry's cheeks, and he shook his head. Malfoy smirked smugly before turning his attention to the letter. Unfolding it, he read the contents aloud.
"Now, Harry," she said. "We think this might be because of an underlying illness. Did you ever experience any unexplained physical pain when you were young?"
The two walked to Slughorn's office and knocked on the door. It opened, and Slughorn's large belly poked out.
"It'll be fine," Harry reassured him, putting a hand on his shoulder. The whole situation felt ironic; shouldn't he be the one consoling Harry? And why would they be comforting each other in the first place?
"Honestly, Potter. Can't you read? It says the page number on the board, you dipshit!" Malfoy muttered to him. Harry craned his neck, and, sure enough, the words
"Sorry," he mumbled sheepishly. Draco didn't say anything. His eyes were pure gold, but it looked like everyone else was too drunk to notice.
"Well, something ripped through your abdomen. You had a big cut across your stomach. I got a cut on my chest, and I started crying tears of blood for some strange reason," Malfoy said wonderingly. "You didn't put anything in the potion that you weren't meant to, right?"
"I have to change your bandages, so stay still for a little bit," she said, chiding at him when he flinched away from her hand. He let her pull up his shirt, trying to ignore Malfoy's flaming gaze as she took off his current bandages.
"Look. Molly was diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder a few years ago. She'd been prescribed anti-depressants and anti-psychotics. What if she'd been skipping her medication, say?" Draco said, eyes widening slightly.
"You're forgetting the part where we're mates, Ron," Harry said exasperatedly as they walked towards the Great Hall. Ron shrugged.
Harry hurriedly left the room, not wanting to be on the receiving end of Draco's wrath. He leaned against the door to try and overhear their conversation, but it was useless. It seemed that Draco had cast a Muffliato.
"I doubt you're going to get through to Ron," Harry said. Draco gave him the look. It was the look that meant 'don't question me, or I'll make it your worst regret'.
"You have no idea how much I've fucking missed you this past week," he sobs, wetting her hair. Alarmed, she patted his head.
"No," Harry said. "Don't apologize. We can't let his death ruin our good memories of him. We won't let him be forgotten."
The two spells met in mid-air, casting a bright green and red glow in the dark caverns of Harry's mind. A wave of pain shook through Harry's body, and his arm shook violently.
Draco abandoned his food and ran to the Hospital Wing. His stomach screamed at him to slow down, but he didn't listen. He needed to know if his Harry was alright.
"No. Although the infusion of wormwood and crushed unicorn horns played a part in creating the potion, they didn't create the potion we thought they had," she explained.
Hermione flushed angrily. "I'll have you know, Malfoy, I can fire you and make your name so radioactive that not even Borgin and Burkes will offer you a job."
someone over a crush?" Jemma said incredulously. Harry shuffled his feet awkwardly while Malfoy shrugged.
Draco cut in. "Why are you protecting her, then? Why didn't you tell us that Molly was potentially dangerous?"
In a moment of bravery, Harry leaned forward to brush his lips against Draco's. Grey eyes stared into his own, and he smiled.
"Dad, can we get ice-cream," Lily asked. Harry chuckled and reached down and set her on his hip, trying to distract her from ice-cream. She squealed, attracting numerous odd looks.
Harry was astonished. He was so shocked, he nearly forgot how to breathe. Because Draco's eyes were... mesmerizing.
"Is he alright?" Draco said worriedly. Harry had stopped breathing a few moments ago, requiring him to be given a large amount of magic from Draco to receive energy and keep his blood pumping.
"Mind explaining why you were betting on your friend's love life?" Harry asked dryly. Hermione and Ron didn't have an ounce of shame.
Harry walked with Draco through the corridors of Hogwarts. It was late, and they were being careful not to get caught. The night seemed to be the only time the two could be together, now that they didn't have to luxury of their own room.
"Alright, alright. I'm just wondering how Lola missing her ex-husband got her murdered!" Malfoy exclaimed. People looked over to him from their tables, and Harry smiled apologetically at them.
Harry sat up and looked around. He was in Kings Cross again. Well, the cleaner version of it. But this time, he was clothed, and there was blood pooled on the floor where he sat. He touched his head to find that it was wet.
He tried not to facepalm when he saw the first year Chaser, Elliot Nile, mount his broom with the back facing front.
The Gryffindors were holding a Halloween-themed party in honor of their victory. Russo had become quite popular among the Gryffindors. The rest of the team, excluding Ron, looked on with malice and envy as countless students clapped the first-year on the back.
Harry groaned, covering his face with his hands. "What if Hermione's right. What if that is what this voice is? The part of Voldemort that never left me?"
"We're uh..." Hermione's voice faltered as she stared at Malfoy's bored expression. "We're working on Cheering Charms."
It was evening, and Harry and Draco were once again headed to the Room of Requirement. Once they had entered, the two sat down on the cushions by the warm fireplace.
Madame Pomfrey clucked at Draco disapprovingly. "You've been hogging his bed ever since the poor boy was admitted! Go and have a nap while he rests a little." when he refused, she moved another bed next to Harry's one and pushed Draco onto it. "Move it!"
"Nothing's wrong with them, Potter," Draco said defensively. As soon as he said it, the gold disappeared from his eyes and they were back to their normal silver. "It's my inheritance."
"When will he wake up? This is agitating," said a cold voice. Harry turned towards it slightly, and he felt someone flinch on the bed.
"If it wasn't, then he would still be alive, Hermione!" Harry pointed out exasperatedly. Hermione thought for a moment.
Malfoy left Harry's side to go to Slughorn's side, but as soon as he did, Harry felt a sharp pain in his abdomen, as if someone had sunken a knife through him. He doubled over and heard  Malfoy faintly groaning from somewhere in front of him. He fell to the ground, and everything faded black.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. "Merlin, Potter. How did you defeat the Dark Lord? One would think you would've given up after the first Horcrux!"
Light beamed through his eyelids as he blinked them slowly. He felt something wet and think pooling around his stomach, and he instantly reached down to touch it. But his hand was already occupied.
"I mean, as long as you have no problem with me fucking guys, sure!" they shook hands, and the boy's dormitories door opened at that exact moment. Ron stood in the doorframe with his ears red while Draco sauntered over to Harry, not a hair out of place.
"I told you, I don't know anything!" Rob cried, thumping his fist down on the table violently. Harry glared at the man and pushed the vial of Veritaserum before him.
"You think they hadn't already tested her for rape? There were no pubic hairs or traces of semen on her body," the blond said. Harry frowned.
He woke up the next morning in tangled limbs. His neck stung slightly, and his lips felt swollen. Harry smiled at the memory of the previous night.
"Look, Hermione, Draco, I'm going to fly!" Harry squealed excitedly. Hermione lurched forward but Malfoy was quicker. In a flash, he was by Harry's side with an arm wrapped tightly around his waist. Harry tried uselessly to escape the blond's strong arms.
"I don't live there, you dinguses. That's where I used to live until my mother died," Jemma said like it was the most obvious thing in the world. "No one has taken care of it for years. I only go there to take a break nowadays. It makes me feel calm. My magic goes haywire when I'm drunk."
"Their father is off with a whore right now, probably," she giggled. Harry looked stricken. "Well, I had to make money somehow! I had forgotten to take the pill, and voila! Twins! I would be damned if I got rid of them as my father got rid of me, so the pimp threw me out."
"I know... I'm just not very patient," Draco chuckled. "But I stand by what I said. I'm never going to force you into something you don't want."
"Oh come on, Harry!" Hermione said exasperatedly, taking out a book and skimming through it hurriedly. "When has that ever worked? We were always the ones fixing the school's problems! You had to fight a basilisk, for Merlin's sake!"
Molly nodded slightly. "He sent me a letter a few days ago. I haven't opened it yet; I didn't want to."
"I don't know why you'd waste time fighting a losing match," the Slytherin Harry taunted. "I guess love makes you do stupid things."
"As some of you may know, Tobias Henley has been murdered a few hours prior," Robards said gravely. "The main suspect is his daughter, Molly Reeds. She has abandoned her children and fled her home. I'm dividing you all into groups to search for her. Potter, Malfoy," he addressed the pair directly. "I'm going to need you to look through every record of Molly Reed's existence. Every single one."
"Me and Lola? Lola despised me," Rob laughed. "She thought I would rape her daughter, but I was the only other magical person she knew. Lola didn't know where Tobias had gone off. She was so happy when he gave her a letter that she dismissed me without a second glance. She thought Tobias would come running back into their lives. I think a part of her truly loved Molly, though, because she never left her for Tobias."
Malfoy whipped his head around, and Hermione giggled. "Well, that's understandable." she smirked knowingly. Malfoy rolled his eyes.
"Anyways, let's get this over with," Harry said. He downed what was left with the drink in one gulp and set it down on the table. He braced himself for Malfoy's questions.
McGonagall had invited all the previous seventh and fifth years to retake their OWLs or NEWTs the year after the war, since students had been too worked up to focus on exams. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had accepted eagerly. Harry was immensely thankful for such a caring Headmistress.
Harry frowned, and Draco tried to peek at the letter once he got up from the ground. Harry immediately took his wand from his nightstand.
Harry opened his mouth to answer, but Hermione beat him to it, “She seems to have decided against coming weeks ago. I wish I would have known, Hugo and Rose could have stayed with her, instead of being stuffed like Christmas turkeys all evening.”
“I know, but now when Ted goes, he can tell me what things are like without all of those disasters going on.”
“Ah, yes…” Malfoy chuckled, “Quite pleased about that, it’ll be interesting to see how it works out. Listen, Potter, I was not a very pleasant person during my school years, and I can only apologize for my arsehole behaviour.”
Seamus elbowed Harry, “Nah, she wasn’t. Remember when she said we should surrender ye to Voldemort, Harry? Right nutcase, that lass. Also, me mam says Malfoy’s got himself a son now ‘n all, but his wife was a bit of a gloomy person. Threatening to off herself, she was. In the end, they got divorced. Sad really.”
“Oh, I know. Pounding away-” Harry cut himself off laughing, and gestured for Malfoy to follow him just outside. Regaining his breath, he let Malfoy hold his arm, before he apparated them both to his house.
Carrying his jacket and bag, Harry patted Ted on the back, "C'mon you rascal, best not get in trouble over a book about the intricacies of knitting a pattern of the Gryffindor lion into scarves." They all stepped out of the office, both adults chatting while Ted stared around with wide eyes, as if this wasn't his umpteenth time in the Ministry.
Teddy’s eyes light up, “Really? I thought I didn’t have any cousins, I didn’t even know mom or dad had siblings.”
“Coming back to Hogwarts would have been miserable after the Battle. Epecially after I crossed the courtyard and seemed to join Voldemort. But we’re getting off-track. I finished a re-sit of the seventh year in Uganda, and I was taken on as an apprentice by a renowned witch. She taught me a few more advanced brews, but I wanted to learn more, so I ended up being referred to a different witch, and through her I met a couple of wizarding people who were all very obliging in teaching and even working with me on a few potions of my own invention, mainly against hereditary illnesses amongst muggles.”
Draco was brought out of his thoughts by a soft snore, to the serene image of Harry Potter, sound asleep against the brick, head lolled onto his shoulder at an odd angle. Draco winced, he couldn’t imagine that sleeping position to be comfortable. He dropped down to crouch next to Harry and tapped his chest a few times, to which Harry barely responded. With a sigh, Draco took hold of Harry and, after several attempts, managed to get him on his feet. It helped that Harry had stayed lean, and that he was a bit shorter than Draco.
The room went quiet for a moment, until Dean wolf whistled and the room exploded into opinions and mild shouting. Ron felt he had become a nice chap, Hermione was pointing out all of his shortcomings, Luna defended his actions as a Death Eater while Neville countered them, and Dean and Seamus simply sat nodding with big smirks and winking at Harry, as if they could tell by Harry’s unwillingness to let all of this on, that something significant had happened.
Harry cringed, "Good solids," he clapped Ted on his back, "Aim at some grass, if push comes to shove. Or food comes to fly, in this case, I suppose."
"Yes," Luna lifted her eyes after a few moments of studying Harry's flushed face, "I should think one might be a bit on edge after receiving some negative critique on one's work." She pulled one file from the stack she was carrying as Harry led her into his office, "Here, all the information we have on kappas. It wasn't easy, you know, finding all of the relevant old archives. Some of them are nearly one hundred years old, and no one's done any research on them since then..."
Ginny came back down the stairs just as Harry was wiping porridge remnants off Albus' face, after having dressed them both in dungarees over red t-shirts. "Well, would you look at you two! Aren't you just dashing?" she exclaimed, clapping her hands together.
Without a second of pause, Harry takes Draco's hand and leads him out of the house, pauses just outside the door, then strides through a few groups of people, until he halts Teddy mid-run, letting Victoire tag him and run off again.
Harry crouches down to ruffle both boys’ hair, then smiles fondly at her, “It’s alright Gin, I’ll take over now. I need to get these two home, are you alright to have Ted over with you tonight?”
“No. We shouldn’t. I have made my peace with Fred’s death. He’s remembered everyday, his candle still burns on the mantelpiece, his pictures are still on the wall. As they will be, for years and years to come.”
Suddenly very interested, Ted beckoned Draco closer so he could whisper, “What were you removed for? Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone.”
Hermione took another sip, then turned to Ron, “We were just talking about Ginny. Did you know she wasn’t coming tonight?”
Harry started pacing the room, gestures large, “Gin, Hogwarts wasn’t just the place he died. It was the place he lived, too. It was where he sold students his jinxed sweets, where he tried to join the Triwizard Tournament with an aging spell, where he rebelled against Umbridge, where he trained to fight Voldemort. There’s so much else of him there, so many special moments. Not just death.” He turned back to face Ginny, and his arms dropped to his sides.
“Do you remember…” began Malfoy, before trailing off without finishing his sentence, following the grooves in the wood of the table with a finger, as he dwelled on whatever memory he’d wanted to bring up.
“Perhaps.” Draco repeated, pulling his jacket straight. “At the very least, let me assist in trying to rouse your friends? Two pairs of fists are better than one.”
Professor McGonagall raised her eyebrows, “There will be no need for flattery, Potter. Although I must say that I am relieved that you solved the mystery that hair combs seemed to pose to you throughout your time here.”
Picking up their conversation again, Harry and Hermione, oblivious to the others’ dubiousness, took their drinks and sat down next to each other at the nearest table, which happened to usually be the Ravenclaw table. Ron took a seat opposite Hermione, and was joined by Luna and Neville moments after. Seamus and Dean materialized from the crowd as well, and excited catch-up small talk exploded from the growing group. The rest of the attendants seemed to relax, and simply took seats that were close to where they were standing, just like Harry and Hermione had done.
He nearly pulled the door off its hinges in his rush to get back inside. Standing in front of the hallway mirror, he pulls his fingers through his fingers through his hair that now reaches past his upper back, and gathers it with a black ribbon at his nape. He stuffs his equally dark button-down into his trousers, decides against a jacket, and steps into a pair expensive-looking dress shoes. He takes a breath, then follows the powder he just tossed into the fireplace, swallowed by green flames.
Harry chuckled and swatted the back of his head, "You've been spending too much time with the Weasleys. Just 'cause you apparated for the first time, doesn't mean you can swear, young man."
Tragically, the spell ends prematurely when Molly bustles up to Draco asking about the punch, and he disappears with her into the house. Harry didn’t even have a moment to process the thoughts and revelations that he’s just gone through, because seizing the spot just opened up next to him, Hermione moves to stand next to Harry, conspiratorial glint in her eye and all.
James nodded and wiggled to be set down so he could career off again, and Harry was joined by Ginny, who transferred Albus into his arms, “Yes, they’ve both been very good this morning, they were wondering where Dad was though. Yesterday, not so good.”
“Touchy, touchy… Done any of that yet, maybe?” Seamus made a point to obviously eye Draco up and down with a smirk, then at Harry, “Malfoy looks stiff as a board, I’d say he could use a pair of hands on his-”
“Harry, your Hogwarts experience was a train-wreck. There was a disaster of some kind every single year.”
“Uagadou, Neville. Africa’s wizarding school.” Hermione nodded, “It’s in the Rwenzori Mountain range.”
Applause erupted, Harry, Ron and Hermione joining in. The teacher who had supported McGonagall stepped forward, and the applause thinned out to let the professor, who Harry now recognised as professor Hooch, his former Flying Instructor and Quidditch coach, speak to the crowd of former students,
“I never thought I would have to assure you of the fact, I thought I would end up defending myself against the idea that I might have ever had feelings for my rival. But here we are.”
Draco stuck his head out of the door, checking that there was no one wandering about, though at this time in the morning, he doubted it. He walked out of the office, guiding the floating, somehow still asleep Harry, by his back, towards the elevator.
“I’ve just realized something. I have six drunk, exhausted, nearly-thirty-year-old friends passed out in my house.”
Harry's face scrunched in confusion and looked away. A minute or so later, he looked at Malfoy, repeatedly taking a breath to talk, but deciding against it at the last moment, until he could fully form a sentence again.
Draco scoffs, bet not without looking pleased with the compliment, “I should hope so, it is essentially my area of expertise.”
Harry watched Draco from across the room, until it seemed he was going to look up, so Harry darted his eyes to George to avoid making eye-contact, downing the dregs of his beer to appear as uninterested as possible.
Harry simply nodded vaguely before falling silent for a few moments, re-running what Hermione had said in his mind, “All the other could ever want, eh?”
As expected, the house was silent, and so was the street. None of the lights were on inside, and there was no movement to be seen. Harry walked up to the front window and shielded his eyes to look inside.
Some awkward laughter rumbled through the evening’s attendants, as everyone wondered where to take a seat in a flurry of low mumbles.
“You know, McGonagall said something similar earlier. That she was thankful that I had found out that combs exist.”
Harry seemed puzzled by the last, so Draco nods and elaborates, “Ted’s grandmother is my mother’s sister- Andromeda is my aunt.”
“Ron, it’s nearly two in the morning, you can’t disturb your parents at this time of night. Besides, there’s no room for two more bodies at the burrow, Bill and Fleur are there with all three of their kids, so are George and Angie with their two. I’m certain that Ginny is over there with Jim and Alby as well.”
Harry turned to walk back to the table where he’d left Malfoy, but halted when he saw him sitting barely a step behind him, leaned back against the table on his elbows, long legs elegantly crossed.
Teddy looked Draco up and down, then holds out his hand and Draco shakes it, “Hello Ted, it’s great to meet you. My name is Draco, we’re cousins.”
Harry sighed, looking at the letter, still on the table. He folded it up and slid it back into the envelope, then left it next to a picture of Fred in the living room. Ted had fallen asleep on the sofa at some point, so, with a little bit of effort, Harry managed to carry Ted into the green flames of the fireplace and onto the sofa in his own living room.
The joy that became him when the owl had landed in the garden, holding a piece of parchment she dreaded every day, wasn’t something she could bear to diminish. Scorpius had watched her, standing on his tippy toes to see her write her reply, then followed as she gave it to the owl and it flew off. He turned to her, eyes wide and drenched with hope, “Say Daddy can visit?” and she’d nodded, then watched the widest grin she’s seen him wear in weeks appear on his face as he raced to sit in front of the fire.
To Harry, Malfoy being nice to him, and himself being pleasant back, felt strange and unnatural. He was always so used to being on his guard around Malfoy, because he expected everything he said to be mocked. It seemed as though Malfoy had kicked that annoying habit. As if he could read his mind, Malfoy picked up the conversation on the same topic.
Harry’s eyes fell back onto the painting he was looking at before he’d been interrupted, and Malfoy followed his gaze. The mood chilled, and Harry noticed Malfoy looking at the faces on the painting.
After what had turned into an afternoon tea, and mrs Cambell had wandered back down the hall, Draco sat down at his elaborately carved and perfectly laquered desk, quill hovering over a piece of parchment as he attempted to still his mind, searching for the right thing to write. He took a deep breath, smiled to himself and started a thoughtfully worded letter to Astoria, asking her to, please, let him see Scorpius. Every letter perfectly swooped into the next as he tiptoed around words and phrases that might offend her. Under the short paragraph, he looped his signature, and let a drop of ink splatter beside it, like a secret code to assure Astoria that it was really him writing to her. He re-read the letter a few times, then folded it up, sealed it, and gave it to his owl.
“Has Malfoy come tonight?” Harry asked, after looking around at the faces in the Hall, but to no avail.
Despite his best efforts, Harry's attention still wandered, and by the time the clock read a quarter past eight, he had convinced himself that arriving early at the memorial wasn't that much of a big deal, so he got up, collected his necessities and apparated home. In the living room, he flicked his wand to change into his handsome evening outfit, and fastened his cufflinks while examining his hair in the hall mirror; to comb, or not to comb? It was no longer the bird's nest mess that it had been in his schooldays, and to put his best foot forward in front of his former peers, he decided to brush his pitch black hair through, and even break out a spell to fix it in a classic pompadour. Proud of his appearance- tidy stubble, healthy colour to his face, smart suit, wide smile, he took a final glance at himself before apparating to Hogsmeade.
For the rest of the afternoon, Harry involves himself in party games with the kids and Ginny, and doesn’t get a moment to talk to Draco for a while. Ending up at the buffet table at some point, he fills a glass with punch, and goes looking for Draco, who he finds next to Angelina. She politely excuses herself, and Harry raises his glass at Draco,
On his mother’s request, Draco accepted help from Jean to move into the same building that she was a resident of, assured by both women telling him that rich and pretentiously self-centred muggles would have little interest in his odd comings and goings after a few weeks. Mrs. Cambell, who had succeeded in persuading him with this argument, obviously had missed the irony in the fact that she herself showed escalating interest in Draco’s activities. Her interest was one reason, among others, that he no longer brought “activities” home from pubs.
“Well, I don’t know about that,” Hermione cast a quick glance around and lowered her voice, “She’s clever, knows how to direct herself around people. Wouldn’t be a bad interrogator, actually, I’m sure she could squeeze every ounce of knowledge out of people.”
“Please take your seats for dinner, sorting yourselves into your houses per table will not be necessary this evening.”
Trying to contain the smile pulling up his cheeks, Ted wandered over to the shelves as Harry started organising his papers, deciding to take a few home with him. Ted was reaching for a slim, red, leather-bound book, with gold lettering on it's spine, until a stern voice stopped him,
They finished jazzing up the marquee, just as Ginny came out of the burrow, carrying a sleeping Albus and James running ahead of her at Harry, who crouched down with a wide grin to catch him. “There’s my Jimmy James! Have you been a good boy?”
Harry spluttered on his mouthful of food, and started coughing, so much that Hermione started thumping her hand on his back. It took him a full few minutes to regain his breath, teary-eyed and flushed.
Ron started piling cuts of meat, potatoes, carrots, gravy and the like onto his plate, everyone shortly copying him.
“Perhaps I could give you a couple of names, I know a few people who… Experiment with spells. Funny you mentioned my work with George, because that’s what we are doing. Nothing as complex as metal reduction, just a few things for his business.”
Harry looked at Draco with a half smile, as if he were really considering the idea, glad to have it proposed at all, but Draco was let down by his response.
At some point, he ended up safely in his bed, flashes of memories both good and bad on his mind, still thinking about that moon.
“Well, it wasn’t all me, not even close. Andy- Andromeda, is always there to pick up my slack, Ginny too.”
Upon closer inspection, his eyes hadn’t been betraying him; in the painting, was Remus Lupin, smiling with that knowing smirk on his face, and next to him was Tonks, laughing happily, their arms around each other. Unable to tear his eyes away, Harry scanned the rest of the painting. There was Fred, winking at him, and Lavender Brown giggling inaudibly, Cedric Diggory sent Harry an understanding nod, and he couldn’t help the tears that stung his eyes at that. Colin Creevey smiled brightly, Harry half expected the enchanted picture-version of him to produce a camera, but a sudden amount of light made him look up, shielding his eyes.
"Because I fell in love with her," Rob said in the same calm tone. "With Molly. I didn't want her to go to jail or one of those god-awful mental institutions."
"Hermione, we burnt him ourselves. We watched his body go up in flames!" Harry clutched his head, pulling at his wayward hair manically, attracting a few stares from the nearby table.
"So what if I do? I didn't mean for this to happen! I don't want this kind of blood on my hands!" Smith panicked. Draco let out a gasp filled with disgust.
The two whipped their heads around to see Madame Pomfrey standing in the doorway to her office with a glare directed at Smith.
"I know," the brunet mumbled against his lips. Draco laughed, the deep vibrations making Harry shiver.
"What, like you and Viktor are planning to have?" Draco teased. Hermione smacked his arm, blushing furiously. She unconsciously placed a hand on her swollen belly, rubbing it lovingly.
"What are you saying? I already am who I was meant to be!" Harry said, trying to hoist himself up. His golden and red tie was choking him, and he struggled to breathe.
”I can bloody well see that. What was it about now?” the ginger asked, plopping down into the space next to Harry. The brunet shrugged.
He was so lost in thought, that he walked straight into a wall. Draco chuckled beside him. "We're here, Harry."
"I'll tell you later," Draco waved his hand dismissively. "Harry, I need to know who pushed you off that Tower."
"Stop shoving me around everywhere. I'm not your barbie doll," he said. Harry didn't respond. Draco sat next to him on the bed.
Scowling at the owl that had perched on one of his bedposts, he picked the letter up from his lap and stared at it with blurry, sleep-filled eyes.
Draco sighed. "Harry, no one was as affected by the war as you. You were carrying the world on your shoulders, you know."
"Don't you have to say it back?" the blond asked, cocking an eyebrow. Harry pushed his shoulder gently.
"I know," Draco said glumly. "But actually being here is different, you know. It makes things so much more real!"
Harry and Draco had resigned from their position as Aurors two years ago, after encouraging each other to pursue their true dreams. Harry became a Mind-Healer, and Draco was now a Curse-Breaker.
Blood was pouring out of his body, but there was no wound. Blood soaked through his body like water through a cloth.
"It's complicated, Neville!" Harry said exasperatedly. Neville clapped him on the back sympathetically.
Harry muttered something incoherent before exiting the warmth of Draco's chest. His boyfriend tried not to whine.
Madam Pomfrey looked up and answered hesitantly. "Now... I wouldn't have suggested this if the Headmistress hadn't convinced me it was the only way but... we may need to extract memories from your mind and look in a Pensieve to see what it was about your childhood that was so... horrifying to you."
"Yeah, but she isn't," Ron pointed out. "I forgive her and then what, she goes and starts developing feelings for Neville!"
"Well, so are people like you!" Smith fired, making Draco recoil. "People like you and Potter are fucking gross! Going around and flaunting your sins-"
“I won’t care either!” Draco yelled, getting up as well. “He’s a lot better than your annoying arse, you controlling little shit!”
"I'm thirty-seven, a piggy-back ride won't kill me," Harry snorted. Lily took Draco's hand and forced him to crouch down on the ground to look at her.
"What took you so long?" he asked, raising an eyebrow. He gestured for Harry to sit across him with his hand.
Harry blushed at the last comment and hid his head in Draco's chest once the two were seated at the Gryffindor table. He heard one or two people coo at the sight.
Harry gave her a grateful smile. He knew she must be feeling extremely hurt, and felt gratitude towards her for being supportive of his and Draco's relationship all the way through.
Hermione hurried over to where they were sitting on sat next to Draco, heaving a large book onto the table.
”you shouldn’t blame everything on yourself.” Harry sighed at the feeling of his hair being carded through by long, slim fingers.
"Who was that just now?" Harry asked in an accusatory tone as Draco came back into the living room, shutting off his phone.
Harry didn't say anything. He stared at the ground and let Draco and the Headmistress discuss different possibilities. The voice kept taunting him, jeering at him, muffling all sound around him.
"You fought the Dark Lord but you think a middle-aged couple is scary?" Draco asked, amusement clear in his eyes. Harry huffed, turning away from him.
Draco, thoroughly nettled, grabbed Harry's hand and pulled him up so that he was standing. He leaned in.
Harry and Malfoy looked at each other sheepishly. They had only read the first line on the board: the page number. They shook their head, and the Headmistress smiled lightly.
"Apparently everyone here knows of our 'friendship'. So I used it to my advantage. You Gryffindor aren't all that bad," he said with distaste. Harry smirked.
An owl swooped through Harry's open window, and he looked away in disinterest as it dropped a letter on his face, cutting his nose. Morning light shone through the windows, and Harry rubbed his eyes as he sat up, yawning widely.
Harry's heart started to pound in his ears at the intensity of Malfoy's stare and he cleared his throat, backing away from the blond.
Lavender stood up and made her way over to Draco, who looked apprehensive. The kiss was chaste but not sloppy. When the two pulled away, they looked disgusted with the other. Draco wiped his mouth.
"Wait! When the potion spilled on us, I felt something cold spread through here," Harry said to Madame Pomfrey, gesturing towards his gut. "It was like it sank into me!"
"Hey, don't worry," Draco said, stroking his cheek, misunderstanding his discomfort. "I'm not mad. I promise."
Suddenly, he was in Draco's crushing embrace. The blond hugged Harry tightly to him, pulling him off the bed entirely and onto his lap. Harry let Draco stroke his back. Draco let Harry soak his robes.
Draco shuddered next to Harry before coughing to mask the moment of vulnerability. But Harry could see right through the facade.
Malfoy’s face darkened as he stiffened. “There is no need to bring up his name at the table. You of all people should know that. And for the record, Pansy’s parents were being held hostage at the time. She only wanted them to be safe. And that required handing you in. Wouldn’t you have done the same?”
”Ron is allowed to have other friends, Harry,” she explained gently. “And he’s never given me a reason to not trust him before. It’s not my job to tell him what he can’t do or what he can. It’s my job, as his partner, to be there for him when he needs it. Just like he’s supposed to be there for me.”
Both Harry and Draco glared at each other, willing the other to surrender in a battle for dominance. Harry melted at Malfoy's burning gaze.
"You think I was going to be a dick about what species you were after what happened with Remus?" Harry said, affronted. Draco shrugged delicately.
Hermione, who seemed to be glowing with pride at solving the mystery, faltered under McGonagall's patronizing gaze.
Harry spoke up. "Professor, we understand that the potion definitely had something in it that shouldn't have been there. But what was it?"
"Oh, Harry!" Hermione flung himself at him. Harry tried to breathe in her vice-like embrace. Ron, being merciful as ever, merely clapped him on the back.
"Does this help?" Malfoy gestured to his arm. Harry nodded shyly. Malfoy proceeded to pull Harry closer and dozed off to sleep with an irritated look on his face. Harry smiled contentedly and nestled deeper into Draco's arms.
Neville helped himself to a few slices of toast and started to butter it. "I can't wait for Herbology!"
“Uh, Harry, we’re making the Draughty of Living Death, (again) so, uhm, how about you crush these beetles-“ she pushed the bowl of beetles towards him. “And I’ll deal with the Gillyweed?”
"That's nice," Harry said, smiling up at him. He leaned up to kiss him gently and Draco smiled into the kiss.
"Anyways," Hermione said hastily. "I found something that sounded pretty similar to what you're... going through."
He heard a high-pitched scream in the depths of his mind and knew it was his mother begging and screaming for him. But there was no one there to save him this time.
"So, that's it? We're boyfriends now?" Harry asked with wide eyes. Only the day before, he had been single and care-free.
"You stay on your side, I'll stay on mine," Malfoy repeated, laying back into the bed comfortably. Harry tried to relax into the sheets but he was too tense to sleep.
"Potter, if we were ever to do any fucking, I would be the one on top," Malfoy said, not bothering to look up from the papers he was reading at Harry's desk. "And I texted you, but you just didn't bother to check your messages."
"Well, I wanted to hide it because I didn't think my friends would have a good reaction to it. But now Ron and Hermione know, I don't care what anyone else thinks," Harry answered truthfully. Draco rested his chin on the top of Harry's head.
"Oh! I know!" Harry groaned. "Harry, come on over! Stop sulking! I'm sure you two will be able to work with each very nicely!"
Hermione looked up from the book she was rifling through. "Like with Voldemort, you mean? When he possessed you-"
Draco caught his eye from across the room. He held up a thumbs up like it was a question, and Harry nodded.
Harry had been under the impression that Draco hadn't seen a thing on the letter, but Draco had seen two words.
"Fine," Harry said, reluctantly filling up the cup with the potion with the Veritaserum, which was a satisfyingly clear color. As he was about to drink it, Ron surprised him by coming up behind him.
"Hey," he said. Draco looked at the two of them with jealousy burning in his eyes. Noticing this, Harry took his hand and squeezed reassuringly.
Draco moved away from his mouth, making Harry whine from the loss, and proceeded to whisper sweet nothings as he moved down the brunet's neck. Harry could only pull him closer as he began to form love bites all over his neck.
Harry and Draco entered the Room of Requirement with jubilant expressions. Well, Harry was jubilant. Draco was irritated.
The Slytherin version of him crouched down in front of him and pulled him up by his hair. His tie tightened an impossible amount more, and he felt his eyes roll to the back of his head.
"Obviously, we're friends!" Harry said nonchalantly. He tried to shake Ron's hand off his shoulder, but the ginger wasn't as dumb as others perceived him to be.
