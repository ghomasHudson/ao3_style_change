"Fuck," I swear, hand reaching down to squeeze my morning wood through my pants.
Something snaps in my head, and I stumble back, finding myself staring at Potter.
reads the date in the corner.
his deceptive appearance at odds with what he is capable of.
"Why didn't they just kill you?"
Welcoming. He was holding a wine glass, absently tracing the stem with his fingertips as he listened to Ron. I struggled to bring my breath under control.
"How do you feel?" He asks, taking his glasses off.
"Is it a gift?"
"I mean..." I realise how it sounds. "My friends would never do that in the first place; they wouldn't find such a thing funny."
"No!" Ginny Weasley is not prepared. She doesn't believe him... fool. She rushes forward, but her father catches her arm and drags her back.
mad at you anymore."
He nods. I help him to sit up, and his face crumples. Looks like he doesn't let himself cry only because I'm here.
"Don't worry," he says, "I'll tell you how." He sits back.
that sometimes feels so tangible and real. Other times it is probably just my own wishful thinking.
"Hi."

is filled with our letters with Noir, laid out scrupulously, according to the dates. My letter-his reply-my letter-his reply. For the whole of Wizarding Britain to digest with their morning tea.
A spell. I saved him out of the fire, but
The old staircase creaks under my feet.
I stride into the hall... No doubt they thought I was deliberately standing there all along, getting off like a pervert. I turn the corner and head down the steps to the basement. When I enter the kitchen, Potter is there at the table with his face crimson and bewildered eyes.
"Sorry, Ron," you threw over your shoulder. "Go buy it for Hermione, I'm sure she'll be glad."
in my absence." Father threw the magazine on the coffee table.
"Well done, Draco. Well done." He bestows me with one of his best smiles and turns away.
I returned the favour.
I almost could hear McGonagall's voice saying in my head.
He's right. I wanted to be left alone, just... He was the only person that wouldn't be unwelcome.
He gasps.
said! It's unsafe for us here."
"Did you see his Patronus?"
"The snake," I repeat stupidly.
it. No. He makes a show of stepping aside, opening it wide with a flourish that he knows sets my teeth on edge.
"Sorry, darling." She pouts. "I haven't smudged it, I promise."
"Master," croaks the voice, "young Master Malfoy is been eavesdropping outside."
I close my eyes.
"What are you talking about?" I stare ahead.
But some parts of it had stuck with me:
She laughed. "Why do you ask?"
We had our last kiss in the Room.
"Yes, thanks, Ron." I take the first step. "Thanks. I'm fine. Go back. No, wait… come here."
His words make me laugh. For the first time in ages. I don't really remember the last time I smiled or even wanted to.
A glowing figure appears out of the swirling mass.
I slide my palm down his stomach - down, down, his belly is smooth - until it touches coarse hair and hot flesh.
"Really? You forgive me?
I dream of Draco Constellation written along his forearm, and no trace of the Dark Mark.
“Fuck, sorry.” I tug at his arm. “I’m an idiot, I didn’t mean to.” We start walking. “Though you know,” I add. “I’d really like to see it.”
He grins, wiping his chin and mouth, and then rubs his palm against his jeans.
"I don't know...but it
giving it all back to me.
"You are a hell of a kisser, Harry!" The moment is broken, she giggles, and I grin to the sound of my frantic heart.
So when Friday night finds me in front of the information board in the Common Room, I snap. Swearing, I tear down the moving photo-collage of me and Malfoy. It's arranged like something out of a fucking scrapbook, with hearts and shit, making us seem like we're in love.  My face looks at me, cut out from the old newspapers, enclosed in a huge red heart, next to Malfoy's.
" He gestures at the box, full of round chocolate biscuits.
"Reasons," he says, "I just... I broke up with her, to keep her safe. It's dangerous to associate with me. For anyone, let alone my 'official' girlfriend." He makes quotes in the air. I guess I hear the bitterness in his voice.
It will seem an eternity will pass… and when our lips finally meet in the lightest of kisses, the fireplace behind us will flare to life, lighting this old house up with the hope of its golden glow.
He is beautiful.
"So, here it is." There's a sound of him placing something on the bedside table. "Visus Reddo Integria."
"Okay... if you want to... okay."
You refused to think of his sleeping face, of his hair spilling over the pillow, of the way his shoulders felt under your palms when you came up from behind to run your hands over their hard, square frame.
"What?! Absolutely not."
"With your
You trace the platinum band with your finger, feeling as the ridges of the intricate crest with the capital 'M' in the centre graze your skin. This thing is holding you here, hostage to your Father's will.
"No."
“I’m cold,” he says, tugging at the blanket to cover us both.
He nods, and nods again, looking down at the folder.
I open my eyes to stare right into Potter's glasses.
," he said and shifted beneath me to look between us, “inside.” I still hadn't pulled out. "And you are inside." He reached down and touched his cock - half-hard, resting against his belly.
“I know, I mean…” It hurts me to think about it, of what awaits my Father… I don’t presume Harry would ever want to help him. I would never dare to ask. “Where’s he?” It strikes me that he might be dead for all I know, and Mother conceals it from me. “Is he?...” I stare at her.
The sound of my shoes against the stone is loud in the empty entrance hall. It's only when it breaks into the run, I realise that it is I who is making it.
He approached the table. There was something malicious in his deliberate gait. "I'm still here. But you two carry on."
I slid off Draco's lap. He made a movement to stand up.
His voice made you flinch. He almost never used your given name.
"The Deathly Hallows," I repeat, "Weasley, surely you must know that." I look at him over my shoulder.
“Already?”
Order members and Death Eaters in battle look very much the same.
"They are going to do it for as long as it gets to you."
When I sit and he straddles me, his fingers undoing the buttons of my shirt, I realise I am shaking.
The world crashes down on my head.
"No," I reply and stand up to leave.
I’d had no idea. I don't think I'd ever considered Potter to be out in the first place.
The glow of fire makes his face look different, softer, less gaunt, less hard than it usually is, than it has become. Something sharp stirs in my chest. A pity for the boy he is talking about: a small underfed child starved for affection, for things, for anything
And we go.
His hands are on me - on my sides and stomach and chest - everywhere.
He hesitates, then undoes his fly.
Not anymore.
A rustle behind me makes me jump; startled, I turn. Potter. He stuffs something in his pocket. I spring on my feet with my wand drawn. He steps forward and draws his. Slowly, we circle each other, the bench between us.
He comes close.
My heart jolts. I never expected Malfoy to address it.
He pulls lightly, and I obey.
"I don't know… the house."
“It’s just… all the other desks are already occupied.” He moves closer.
I grab the loaded tray, saying
In a flash of green light, Dumbledore reels back, his hands thrown wide as he grasps the air for support, falls over the railings and is gone.
I took his hand. “No one gives a fuck."
“Have you broken yours?”
Just a moment before I thought that nothing can add to this brightness. I was wrong.
You couldn't see your Mother's face in the dark room. Having been lying in bed all day long, you hadn't bothered to turn on the lights.
I step in front of him. Taking his face in my palms, I kiss him, slow and hot, and our tongues finally meet, our breaths urgent. I am so hard.
"Stand
Everything is the same. But it's different. People avoid me. Whisper behind my back. Part of them still thinks I came back from the dead. Though for me it's the other way around: I'm dead
"How can I help you?"
"Draco Lucius Malfoy, for the hearing 020698-3!"
I would close my eyes and listen, your bright image in the window light still etched under my eyelids.
"Fred!" One of the Weasley twins screams across the Great Hall and rushes to her side.
"Then the debt stands until it does."
It was only a matter of time.
"You go, I'll be there later...
At a loss, I dropped into my desk, my mind racing... When Zabini approached and flopped the folder in front of me.
You didn't know what made you pause, but your hand was already reaching for his jacket. The dark green one. The one he was wearing yesterday for the meeting with his mother.
With a flick of her wand, she throws Granger on the floor and unties her wrists.
My heart thudding, I step behind him and lightly touch my fingers to his locked wrists, saying a simple spell.
I shake my head.
I look up, and there's Malfoy, hovering above me, his white hair gleaming golden in the sun. Not looking at me, he is grinning to himself, and I have a chance to give him a thorough once-over. Well, if not for the fact that it's
"Forgive me, Harry." He steps back and leans against the railings. His breath is laboured. He looks so old and frail
The funeral crowd recedes, groups of people moving to the gates.
"Do you have anything to say?" Father's voice was almost a whisper.
His hand finds mine and gives it a faint squeeze. My head is so heavy. I put it on his chest and close my eyes, listening to the drum of his life under my ear.
"Expecto Patronum!" Our voices say as one.
"You are to depart tomorrow morning. Have the elves pack your things for you. You are to stay there as long as it takes to get you back to normal. It is a Muggle facility, so your Muggle clothes and knowledge," he spat the words in distaste, "will serve a good purpose for once."
"Mr. Filch!” McGonagall announces. "You arrived just in time. I would like you, please, to lead Ms. Parkinson and the rest of the Slytherin house out of the hall."
His arms wrap around me. "I can't believe it," he whispers.
"We should go there!" He sits up and falls back with a grunt, as the fabric of the sleeping bag yanks him back.
"Who the hell do you think you are?" Your face was murderous. "Embarrassing me like this in front of my friends."
I stop so abruptly that he nearly trips. “A broom ride?”
"Potter's friends."
. To a family like ours.
"Watch it, Potter," he warns.
I double over with laughter, trapping his head with my hands.
Before Harry could try to think of a response that wouldn’t gain a sneer from Malfoy, a Healer walked over and looked past Harry (a notable event, given the usual status quo) and her glare shot daggers toward Malfoy.
“That means I love you despite your past, despite the way you’ve been treated.”
“Malfoy!” he called, breaking into a jog to catch up with the pale head that was pulling the hood of his cloak up.
And Draco knew without a doubt that he meant it.
It was then that Harry realized he’d made a fool of himself by forgetting the morning’s events; when he had arrived at the ministry, the Malfoy trial was being prepared.
“What aren’t you telling me?” He said, less out of anger than of curiosity. He looked at Draco, but Draco was still ignoring his gaze.
Malfoy managed a sneer before he turned away despite the tears still brimming in his eyes, and turned away, yanking his hood down as far over his face as he could manage.
Harry Potter would not be responsible for any more hurt.
The healer’s face changed as she turned to Harry, lifting immediately with half of a polite smile. “I’m sorry you had to see that, Mr. Potter, but really, for the sake of our patrons--”
“I dated someone named Michael before you and I met again at the bookstore.”
Malfoy was nearly out the door now, and the stares from the waiting patients filled Harry with apprehension. “You’ll go against the minister for the sake of prejudice? Isn’t this the exact same idea that Voldemort built his ideas on?” Harry said, evoking more than a few gasps from the crowd that was now watching. The healer was frowning now, glancing backward for some sort of backup.
No, Michael hadn’t loved Draco. Not really. That was clearer than it had ever been now.
“I’m sure it isn’t, but you’re quickly becoming an expensive risk. Anyway, you’re free to go. Suppose I’ll see you next month?” the Healer offered, and Harry replied with a sheepish smile.
The place where Malfoy’s finger had dug into Harry’s skin left a phantom echo of Malfoy’s touch, and Harry began to realize that everything the blonde had said was true. He was burdened with a crippling savior complex, and Malfoy surely wouldn’t be the last he tried desperately to save.
The public was angry with Malfoy, and his injuries now made much more sense.
“Pass the wine bottle?”
Harry was briefly frozen, shocked by Draco’s uncharacteristic show of affection, but the tears he felt on his shoulder brought him back to reality. He embraced Draco tightly, carding his fingers through Draco’s hair.
Malfoy spun around so quickly that Harry nearly crashed into him again.
The tears began to spill from Draco’s eyes, and he wrapped his arms around Harry.
“St. Mungos has the right to refuse service to Death Eaters, no matter how innocent the ministry wants us to believe they are. Leave,” She said harshly, and Malfoy took a step back. Harry could see Malfoy’s hesitance to stand down, his pride willing him to defend himself. But Malfoy said nothing, and with a scared glance around him, he began to back away.
‘Wait, let me help! I don’t care what names you call me, you’re hurt and I--”
Draco bit his lip as he laid his head on Harry’s shoulder. He couldn’t find the words to reply without letting out the sob he was trying in vain to ignore.
Harry was frozen, immune to the shoulders of passersby in a hurry who gave him stares half filled with recognition.
For the first time since he’d taken in Malfoy’s thin frame, Harry glanced around them. Every witch, wizard, and healer was staring (or pretending not to be staring) at Malfoy with hatred in their eyes.
Harry thought, unable to do much more than fumble with his words.
“Are you alright?” Harry managed to ask, and Malfoy clenched his jaw and swallowed hard.
Draco dragged himself out of his thoughts and nodded. “Everything’s fine. Just got lost in thought.” He wasn’t sure he even believed himself.
Draco tore his gaze away from the fading amber light of the sunset. He leaned forward and passed the bottle to Harry, who gave him a grateful smile. Draco returned the smile, but quickly returned his gaze to the sky. Harry’s voice held no malice, but the sudden statement sent a chill down Draco’s spine.
Harry didn’t either. He’d known for a while that there was something Draco wasn’t telling him, but every time he’d tried to ask, he was met with defensive anger. Tonight, Harry was intoxicated enough that his thoughts left his mouth before he could apply any of this logic to the moment.
savior,” Malfoy sneered, wiping blood from his lip from the back of his hand.
“I love you too.”
“Right, I’ll be finding somewhere else the next time I need healing. Good day.” Harry pushed past the audience he’d attracted and went after Malfoy’s quickly disappearing form.
“It was fine until everything became my fault, until he started holding my past against me,” Draco said, painfully aware that his voice was rising in pitch. “And I let him, I--” He bit his lip. As the sky began to blur, he willed the tears to stay at bay. He wasn’t supposed to cry, he wasn’t supposed to be so emotional.
Malfoy didn’t seem to have registered who he’d run into until Harry spoke his name, and the realization made the blonde’s eyes flood with tears.
Nausea washed over Draco, and he knew it wasn’t from the alcohol. He’d been with Harry for five months now, and up until now he’d managed to bury any questions like this one. Draco’s grip on the stem of his wine glass tightened as Harry set his own glass down on the table.
Harry rubbed the back of Draco’s hand.
“I’m sorry he hurt you,” Harry said, resting his head against Draco’s. “Thank you for trusting me enough to tell me about it.” His words were genuine, loving. But the voice in Draco’s head reminded him of a voice that had once confessed its love for Draco with consequences.
“Forgot what?”
“So I’ve been told,” Harry said, wanting to scratch his eyes out.
“The Muggle-lovers. Revealers. New Blood people, you know.”
“I suppose.”  Draco hitched a shoulder carelessly.  “If that’s all you can make.”
Harry quickly checked Mister Malfoy’s face, but he didn’t even look a tiny bit mad.  Shadows licked up the side of his cheekbones, making his skin gold.  “I’m fine,” Harry said, realizing Mister Malfoy was waiting.
“Yes,” Draco said breathlessly. “Yes.”
“The Level Ones who aren’t blood supremacists,” said Fuentes.
To find out where the mind-control potion was coming from, he set up tracking spells on all his suspects—Robards, Vance, Savage, Ron.  The first few nights turned up nothing, but on the fourth night, Harry tracked Vance across London to a warehousing district Harry knew of no reason for Vance to visit.  Apparating so that he was a few blocks away from Vance’s signal, Harry followed his wand to a warehouse on Colville Road.  Apparently, Vance was inside.
Harry thought of Malfoy, his lacklustre hair, cut so that it was short in back but fell into his eyes, now. All of those too-loose, too-worn jumpers, falling off the shoulder. His rodential jaw. His still pointy nose. The bags and shadows under silver eyes, the splotchy skin. “I don’t know,” Harry said, feeling strangely wounded by this. “His Boggart was his Dark Mark. He’s tried so hard to overcome it.”
The next day the cover of the
He still had the one from Grimmauld Place, Harry realized with a start.  It still had stagecoaches and dogs and cabbages on it, though now it also had blood.  Draco hadn’t bothered to clean it, which seemed unlike him.  “What happened?” Harry said, edging closer.
“Not everyone.”
“Oh,” Harry said.
“Oh, yes,” said a low, laconic tone.  “We wouldn’t want me to get sacked because of Harry Potter.”
“Mum’s getting out,” Draco said, taking out a slide and pushing in another.
Malfoy moved to stand in front of Alby, face to face with Harry.  “You should leave.”
“I don’t! I think of him as someone who’s failed my class!” Harry paced the length of the Chamber of Fires, which was in the centre of Leck Hall. The hearths built into every wall made it an ideal meeting room, no furniture filling the centre of it so every direction could be faced. Wizard leaders of the world had once communicated via this Chamber, when Cambridge had been the seat of the Ministry just after the Statute had been put in place, and other magical groups around the world began to implement similar wards to separate them from the non-mag world. Now the Chamber was merely used for meetings of Board members who were too privileged and lazy to Apparate to Cambridge on a dreary day in April, when the trainees were off for three weeks to study and practice for examination.
“Are you sure that’s really necessary,” said Ron, but really it was more like a sigh.
“Er.”  Harry didn’t know what to say.  “I need a number for a taxi.”
Looking miserable, Draco shrugged.  “I thought I could give it up.  I meant what I said—it’s not as important to me as my mum is.  I thought that I could stop, for her, but I couldn’t.  I just—want it, sometimes.  So badly.”
“Those ones are the most recent,” Harry said, pointing to a box.
31 years
“Good. My office. After classes.”
“You’ve asked more of me before,” Harry pointed out, then wished he hadn’t. Malfoy looked distinctly uncomfortable, as though he would rather forget any sort of embarrassing confession he had ever made. Perhaps he just didn’t like to talk about it, but perhaps, with the change of his Boggart, he was finally learning to grow beyond it. “Anyway,” Harry added, in a bit of a rush to change the subject, “I never asked for the coffees or Notice Me Nots or sandwiches, but you do them anyway. Let me do this for you.”
“I’ve broken in?”  Harry felt his eyes go large.  “But you said it’s the wizard government!”
“Oh.” A frown creased Penelope’s small brow in her sharp little face. “But you’re gay too, aren’t you?”
“I’d love you as a vampire,” Harry said.
“We should go inside,” Harry said abruptly.
“How could he?  I never met him.”
Harry put his head back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling, willing himself to remember how much he liked Draco when he grew up.
“He could,” Ron agreed. “Do you think he will?”
“How horrible,” said the man—her husband, Harry was pretty sure.  “Having the same name as him.”
Sometimes when Harry thought about the kitchen table, serving Vernon and Petunia pot roast, he imagined the car, the flash of lights, the abrupt jolt, a swift black and then a silence. Sometimes when he thought of Voldemort now, Harry could feel the Aveda Kedavra, the flash of green. The scent of wet pines in the Forbidden Forest. Narcissa Malfoy’s white face among the trees. He could feel it now, the jolt, what it felt like to die.
“I suppose you’re still young,” Mister Malfoy said, sounding uncertain.
Mister Malfoy’s jaw went tight, like he was clenching it.
“And.”  Draco tipped his head to look up at Harry.  “And you don’t think I’m a freak, do you?”
“There was a man named Voldemort,” said Andromeda, setting down her cards and picking up her tea.  “An evil, arrogant individual who felt that Muggles and people who associated with them were inferior.  He amassed power and a group of followers and began killing Muggle people.”
Ron turned to look at Kavika and the woman in blue. “She’s a Greengrass. I think.”
No one was expelled.
“Is that from Icarus?” Harry said, nodding at the paper in Teddy’s hand. “I’m glad you’re keeping in touch with Hogwarts friends.”
“Lewd Jaw?”
“I was a cruel child.”  Draco went on eating his salad.
Teddy walked along the garden path, letting the silence of their speech broadcast the sound of their steps.
“But who is it?”  Reluctantly, Harry took Draco’s hand.
“Andromeda told me,” Harry said.
“And tell Dudley—tell him Mummy loves him very much.”
The bedroom was very cool, despite the same wood-panelling.  It had posters up, and the people in the posters were intimidating, but in a cool way, with Mohicans and pink hair and rings in their noses.  They were holding things like guitars and drumsticks, and they looked like they might be screaming, but you couldn’t hear them.  The chest of drawers was covered in stickers, and on the floor was a rug that snarled when you stepped on it.  The bedcovers were silver, but changed colour when Andromeda turned the coverlet down.
“I don’t think I could.”
“Reveal is only safe with a Deal,” Nyala said.
“I don’t know why everyone’s so gaga about him,” Nyala added. “I never liked him much. Sorry, Harry.”
Harry floated between then and now: Robards, who saw crimes only when they threatened his status quo; Proudfoot, who ardently believed the protection of non-magical people meant forgetting they existed. Ron, who still thought he could be an Auror and do the right thing; Hermione, who still thought that she could be in the Ministry and do the right thing. Shacklebolt, who still thought that he could form a coalition; Greengrass, who was waiting to see which way the wind blew; Lucius Malfoy, who thought he could act like he had no position while secretly working to fund the opposition. Teddy, who still thought he could be a hero in this world.
Harry looked in the cabinet, which had chicken, flour, sugar, bread, and an assortment of vegetables in it.  “That takes hours to cook,” he said, because even if he could transform the chicken, the rest wouldn’t work out.
“You mean you saying you could do something because you’re Harry Potter?”
“Yeah.” Harry uncrossed them. “Neat trick.”
“No,” Draco agreed.
“You wanted me to pass a failing student last year.” Harry turned to Fudge. “The only difference now is the
“All you need to do is watch the memory,” Yin said. “Nothing besides that. Do you want me to come with you?”
Behind his eyes, Harry could still see her—Professor Burbage, begging Professor Snape.
Malfoy laughed. “Aren’t you meant to be strong? Can’t you get out of it yourself?”
“You would never kill a house-elf,” Harry said, feeling exhausted all over again.
“It’s poison I’ve made, just for you.”  Malfoy sounded annoyed and impatient, but not necessarily unkind.  In fact, he looked a bit amused.  “Go on.”
In this man, Harry could see the child Draco had been—the pink cheeks, heaving chest, and abrupt defensiveness that came out of nowhere like a slap in the face.  “All right,” Harry said.
“Fuck,” Malfoy said again.  His voice was soft.  “I’ll bet you would.  Harry Potter, saviour of the fucking world.”
“It’s not ever going to go away,” Kavika said in her low rasping voice. “You know this. I’m very sorry, Harry.”
“Potter.” The way Malfoy spat the word felt old and familiar. “If I could either eliminate all Muggles or that mangy bastard, I’d have a tough decision before me. I’m sorry for what he did to you,” Malfoy added, touching Travers’s arm again. “I’ve thought of it often.”
“How is this—in any way—normal?”
His face had gone livid, just after Harry had been thinking that his face wasn’t as pasty as it had been.  It had filled out a bit since that first time Harry had seen him here, and even if it was still thin and yes, pale, he still had the same features he’d had in school.  Where Harry hadn’t realized he was good-looking.  Twisted with anger as it was now, Malfoy’s face didn’t look so good.  Harry forgot what he’d been about to say.
He didn’t.
“Pardon?”
“You mean he told you? About trying to get Hagrid fired?”
Some of the hardness fell away again, leaving Malfoy looking a little naked. His face was so much softer this way, kinder almost. There was a sweetness in the shape of his mouth that Harry hadn’t noticed before. “You would quit, rather than pass me?”
“I miss you,” Draco said.
“It’s nice,” Harry said.
“Oh.” Harry rubbed the back of his hand. “I think I might have had enough drama.”
was written in dripping blood.
Harry left him alone to make his potions.
“Obviously, he’s changed.” Turning back around, Harry flopped down onto the chair facing the couch, where Hermione was lounging and Ron was leaning forward with interest. “He’s trying to be an Auror, isn’t he?”
“Yeah, see? That’s the problem.” Harry’s hand closed into a fist around the shrunken magazine. “He
Harry shuddered in surprise.
“Draco,” Harry said, because at some point, Draco was going to remember about Narcissa—but Draco was tipping back the bottle again, drinking the rest.
Andromeda was magical too, so she didn’t think he was a freak, and she didn’t have any cats.  That made her much better than most adults, even though Harry didn’t like the way she teased.  She seemed to tease quite a lot, but he was never sure that she was doing it, and usually when it happened he was pretty certain it was him she was laughing at.  Harry, who was very used to being teased in a mean way, didn’t find it funny.  Draco hadn’t teased him a lot, but when he had, Harry had always felt in on the joke.
“What?” Malfoy’s voice cracked, but the words seemed to have broken through the haze.
be trivialized?” Moskowitz. “Shacklebolt. If the Council honestly goes for his deal on Reveal—”
Malfoy’s eyes flashed at the dig, but he didn’t say anything else bratty.  Instead he said, “Do you remember that time you asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up?”
Because this is what it means.
"Astoria," still not looking up, he said in a quiet resignation.
I don't know what to say to that. There's the thought, nagging at the back of my mind, that if our positions were reversed, I would have probably done just that - thrown him out of my house, not thinking twice. Because it's Potter, and I hate him... or at least I'm supposed to, right?
"He had handed them down to the
I would love those nights. Your worried eyes and fake light-hearted jokes. A little bit too tight a grip of your arm around my chest. I would cherish them and hold them close to my heart. Soon, I would try to make them happen more often. Soon, I would cease feeling guilty about it.
Writing the note, focused solely on what Noir may think, I hadn't considered all this. I hadn't thought that the entire school would be present. I hadn't thought that for that very reason he may not come.
I shriek, trying to kick him in the shin. My voice is shrill, and I fail to control my face, to make it appear normal. I despise myself, but I can't stop, can't hold it back anymore. I sag to my knees, dragging him down with me, and howl.
"Great!" I say cheerfully to Malfoy. "I'm useless. You are going to do all the work."
I fall on my knees, the world blurs in my tears.
I hiss right into his ear, my lips grazing his skin.
"Where did you learn?" He approaches.
He is mumbling, and it's ridiculous... I feel so bright, so simply happy like I haven't felt in a long time. Just because he's sitting next to me.
I reply,
"I didn't mean to..." He stares at me. "I was going to say...
"Hermione told me," he said, "as you asked." His face was solemn.
"Hey," I would say, grabbing for my chair.
Eyeing him sideways, I take a sip from the bottle. Dry and crisp, the wine tastes nice and gets to my head quickly. Our situation seems less grim to me with every passing second.
"But Harry, you were cheating on Ginny-" Granger begins.
It's what we are doing now, right? Is it really dating? Are we
[15] – Draco Malfoy to Goyle, not letting him kill Harry Potter in the Room of Requirement, from “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows” by J.K. Rowling.
The wand in Malfoy's hand shakes in the dim light of the lanterns on the walls. It's not the wand, I realise, it's Malfoy. He is shaking with horror written across his face.
With a thud, Alecto and Amycus Carrow hit the floor below the dais, as the Weasley twins give each other high-fives.
"You see, when he - hmmm - hit you with the Killing Curse when you were a child, he unintentionally ingrained a part of his soul into the scar on your forehead--"
"Dunno." You shifted behind him to take a better look through the bush. "Looks good."
“Y-yes,” he says after a brief hesitation.
"What?" The word is stuck in my throat. I am an idiot, but every time, in  moments like this, I think you are going to say
"Penelope Clearwater," Granger replies so naturally that if I hadn't known otherwise, I'd believe her.
Potter catches up with me and grabs my wrist, turning me to face him. When I try to wrench free, he grabs my other wrist.
I have nothing left to do but leave.
"Think about it,

And safe.

"Is this okay?" I ask.

You close your eyes, drifting along with the music. Music that makes you want to cry and smile, rendering you sad and happy, stinging inside your very heart with hope.

"I'm like... what?" I ask.
He is dressed in all black: plain trousers and a shirt open in the middle, halfway down his chest. Well, not plain, as in 'simple.' Because his version of plain is usually called something else, I suppose, like... some fancy word, like...
"Do you have a self-writing quill?"
"No…" I sit up again. "I… yes, I guess I do."
"Draco."
There's a sound of a movement from Ron's direction, but then Hermione whispers: "Ron."
Music is deafening, and my head is swimming, and people are moving around in flashes of colour; but the only one I see clearly is Malfoy. A black figurine in the middle of the motley crowd, he is wiping Parkinson's scarlet lipstick off his lips and chin, grinning down at his red stained fingers. All I can see is him.
“A trainee desecrated Academy property,” Pillwickle said from his own hearth, his voice—as ever—silky. “What was it you demanded a few years ago for similar destruction of property, Potter? Expulsion, was it?”
Six days later, Harry was at Rombe Pickle for Sunday brunch. Brunch was over. Andromeda had rushed off to another pottery class. Harry sat there with his coffee. It was almost gone. Teddy sat there too, tall today and unmistakably blond. Teddy’s features were more delicate than his own, almost feminine. He looked how Malfoy would look if Malfoy were pretty.
Mouth twisting, Harry set his coffee down. “I think Malfoy told him not to make it worse for me.” When Harry looked up again, Kavika had on this calm, placid look, which Harry thought she sometimes did when she was secretly interested. Most of the time she was so genuine with him, but she never shared everything;
Meanwhile, Harry’s nightmares worsened. He worried about Fudge, about the Board, about Teddy, about Reveal. At least classes at the Academy were uneventful. No one had followed in the blood supremacist footsteps of Travers, and the remaining three members of the board had not yet made a move against Malfoy. Teddy was excelling in Level Two, and Nyala Zabini was making passing marks.
Malfoy looked him up and down.  “Well?  What’s happened?  Why am I in these clothes?  You’re an Auror, aren’t you?”
“I imagine he wouldn’t have wanted you to know.”
Guessing Draco wanted to go over to the basket where their lunch was, Harry followed again.  “Can we go look at it?”
“Wait.”
They both pointed their wands at the bed, transfiguring it in short order into a very cool bunk bed.  Instead of splitting the coverlet, though, Andromeda went and got another one, and Draco made Harry take the pyjamas and go into the loo to change.  “What did she mean about me not liking bad things said—”
“Don’t.” Malfoy jerked his arm away.
“I just need you,” Harry said.
“Were they nice?” Harry asked, even though he already knew they were.
Besides the three individual portraits, the page had two other pictures of the three girls.  In one of them they were posing nicely for a portrait, Draco’s mum smiling prettily and the black-haired one rolling her eyes.  In the second, the brown-haired one and the black-haired one were turning to each other and drawing their wands, looking as though they were yelling.  In that picture, Draco’s mum was still smiling that same pretty smile, but even though her mouth didn’t change her eyes did.  They looked as though they were slowly freezing into ice, becoming a point of stillness with the action all around her.
“Of course,” Malfoy said, the response immediate.
“I’m going to help Draco solve the mystery,” Harry said.
Harry kissed him. “I love you.”
Harry was terrified that Malfoy knew exactly what was wrong with him.  He didn’t even know himself.
This time Harry heard the gasp, followed immediately by, “Dad!”
A shimmering golden cloud rose out of the flowers, which Malfoy directed with his wand to the mark on his bared arm. The cloud sank into the mark, glowing on his skin. Then Malfoy pointed his wand at the flowers again. “Avada Kedavra,” he murmured, and the flowers immediately wilted, black and dry. Malfoy pointed his wand at his arm again, then cast another spell. This would be the one that would make the mark respond to a call. Pointing his wand at the ceiling, Malfoy cast a final spell. A magic flower made of light hovered on the ceiling, a mark that would call to any corresponding mark. Malfoy held up his arm to reveal the glow on his arm, responding to the call. Now that the mark on Malfoy’s arm had gone thick and black, Harry could see that it was in the shape of the flower.
gossip columns, but this was unfair. He shouldn’t expect Duggins to ignore his fame on the one hand and know everything about him on the other. Kavika had, but she had been the wife of the Minister of Magic. She knew better than most what this kind of life was like, and Harry shouldn’t blame Duggins for being ignorant of it.
For a moment, Harry fully convinced himself that Draco had fainted from hunger, but then he remembered what Draco had been like last time Harry had interrupted Draco while he was reading.  “Draco,” Harry said more loudly.
“He didn’t tell me,” Harry said.
Though Kavika looked touched, she said only, “You may sit, Harry. I will make the coffee.”
“You know Draco,” Harry said.  “Imagine him slaughtering anything.”
“There was a point where I thought I wasn’t going to have a family again.” Malfoy’s words came in a tumble. “To hear her say that—for her to call me that, her nephew—this whole night—it was just—it was a lot for me.”
That wide-eyed, startled look passed over Malfoy’s face once more, then tucked away again, like a mist that had never been.  “When?” he said, but his voice wasn’t so steady as before.
“Help me find him,” Teddy said, “and I’ll explain.”
“Because some kids aren’t nice.”
“Oh,” Harry said. “You meant Malfoy.”
Harry expelled a breath, relieved they weren’t talking about Malfoy anymore.  “Fine.” Then he really thought about it. “Good. Teddy will be back.”
On the desk sat a cup of steaming coffee.
Draco’s lips quirked again.  “It’s an in-between birthday, remember?  You get a present each day and anything you want to eat.  And a bed to sleep in,” he added, sounding a little angry about that.
“You didn’t know you had people in high places who wanted you to pass?”
Perhaps Draco had adjusted his tastes for Harry, making more common dishes he thought a child would like.  Probably young Draco was used to eating very posh things, only Harry didn’t have much experience making posh things.  “Fettuccini alfredo?” Harry suggested, because at least it had a fancy name, and he knew that he could make it.
, because with you, I wanted—I wanted.”  Draco’s breath hitched, which seemed to cause his whole expression to change, breaking down. “I—I don’t want to live in a world without my mum in it.”
“But, um.”  Harry was trying not to pry too much, because he still remembered Draco saying he wasn’t privy to every detail of Draco’s life, except Draco had said that he was in love with him.  “You said,” Harry said, trying to think of a way to remind him of it that didn’t put Draco in a corner.  “You said you—felt differently.  Than you’ve said.  Before.”
Harry hurried to catch up, following Mister Malfoy, who lit up sconces on the wall as they went down the stairs.  “They have big machines,” Harry said, hopping down the steps.  Though he was downcast he hadn’t been able to convince Mister Malfoy to let him stay, he was very interested in the prospects of a magic lab.  “And they have lots of glass things with things bubbling and test tubes.  And they have a bed with straps and a way to get lightening.”
“Malfoy,” Harry said, turning to Malfoy. “You’re doing well.”
“Shh,” Draco murmured, his lips on Harry’s now. “I know what you need. I’ll be everything you need; I’ll be so good for you.”
Draco—wearing Harry’s eyes—raked his gaze over Harry—wearing Draco’s body.  It didn’t feel very nice at all, and Harry wondered whether his eyes were always so piercing when he grew up.  “Very good,” Draco said, taking the beaker from Harry.  “You’ll have to give me your glasses, Harry.  I had no idea his vision was so bad.”
Harry didn’t know whether Malfoy made the attempt. The reporters had already tried to corner him, but Harry had become good at evading them—and ignoring Malfoy, apparently. At first, Harry hadn’t even noticed Malfoy among the trainees when he introduced ADADA and Wandless Combat, only eventually becoming aware of the dull head that rose a good two inches above any other of the trainees. Still lanky and absurdly bony, Malfoy had not got any fitter.
“Okay,” Harry said.
There was a pause, and Harry looked up.  Draco quickly turned the page.  “I’m not sure.  What sort of punishment do you mean?”
Draco stared at him, and Harry realized that maybe Brazil seemed random.
“Would you like to give her a treat?” Draco said, beginning to open the package.
Harry should fix this.
“You thought I would think you were the wrong sort.”
“Yes, Harry.  This is a sleepover.  Without the sleeping part.”
“The war is over!” Baggot raised his hands.
“You had better go,” Harry said, opening the door.
“I was trying to, actually,” Harry went on, “but you couldn’t seem to stop sucking my cock. Not that I’m complaining. You’re very good at—”
“I’m not going to remember Heloise and flying and—the dragon frozen in the sky, and everything?”
Harry hadn’t even really meant it as an insult, but he could tell Malfoy had taken it as one.  Instead of retaliating, however, Malfoy just kept clearing the table, putting the ingredient back in jars, scraping off the cutting board.  Since Malfoy had just helped him, Harry felt a bit badly about having said it, even if it was Malfoy’s own fault that he had taken it personally.  Coughing a little, Harry said, “How did you do it so fast?”
“Yes, Harry,” Draco said.  “You’re allowed to eat it.”
“You do?” Draco looked pleased, but then said, “Well.  Of course.  Everything looks good on me.”
“He wasn’t.”
Kavika had done exercises with him.
“I’ve liked it when you read to me.”
“It’s my favourite kitchen,” Harry said, because it was.  He liked Molly’s kitchen almost as much, but this one was so small that it was cosy, and it usually had Draco in it.  “How about a sandwich?”
12 years
was once seen with
Then Draco’s mouth was on him again, this time for real, warm wet heat so decadent and tight around Harry’s cock that Harry had to close his eyes. This was perfection; this was heaven, and then the mouth was tightening for him, sucking, pulling on it and off it with a perfect swirl of wet muscle at the end, Draco tongue. Then Draco was back on it, going down farther this time, farther, nudging the back of Draco’s throat—which could hurt him; Harry tried to keep his hips still—but it didn’t hurt him. Draco didn’t choke; he took it beautifully, the warm, wet sleeve of his throat wrapping silkily around Harry’s cock like Draco’s throat had been made for cock, starving for it. Harry wished he could touch it in Draco’s neck, feel the shape of his thick cock forcing Draco’s throat to open wide and fill his neck.
“Well what?”  Harry suddenly felt exhausted.
He knew now what he should have done, when he’d found Draco this way after his mum had died.  He should have touched him.  He should have held him.  He should have called him darling, because he was.
“It takes its toll. Here you are, Harry.” Turning from the side table, Kavika brought two cups, handing one to Harry and keeping on for herself. Seating herself opposite Harry, she was silent for a moment, allowing them both to take a sip.
“Who would you tell?”
“I’ll miss ten-year-old you, but I miss thirty-year-old you.  I miss him right now.”
sat between them, something poison between them; Harry didn’t want to look.
Malfoy’s jaw hardened, and Harry turned back to the rest of the trainees.
Harry nodded even more vigorously.
“Oh,” Harry said, resisting the urge to glance over his shoulder, back at the crowd. “That’s not good.”
“The ledger said the radius would be increasing with my years.  It also said the interval between my steps in age would be increasing, which we’ve seen.  You’ve heavily implied that whatever caused this accident poses some kind of threat, and the ledger said you’d have Auror business.  Hadn’t you better go take care of that?”
“My perspective?” Harry asked, feeling a little confused.
Harry hadn’t wanted to tell them about Malfoy’s Patronus. Every time he thought about it, his stomach wrapped over itself and over itself as thought hurriedly tying a knot so tight that he couldn’t sick up, even though he wanted to.
“Well.” Draco tossed his head.  “That’s different.  He’s in wizard magazines.”
Harry felt guilty that it was just about the hottest thing he’d ever seen.
The smile faded a bit.  “Someone who isn’t magical.”
“Only a few.”
“I wanted it to be black and white,” Teddy went on. “Find some Death Eaters. Stop them from hurting people.”
She had helped him find those memories, those thoughts. Together, they had looked at them one by one. Harry had gradually filled that empty space.
“Ah.”  Malfoy looked at him, his expression inscrutable.  “Then would you mind telling me why you’re shaking like a leaf?”
“That’s probably a good thing,” Mister Malfoy said, ending the spell and making a note.
Draco nodded miserably, his face still half hidden in the pillow.
“Why?”  Only afterwards did Harry remember Draco saying he thought Harry would be satisfied.
Malfoy inclined his head. “And that would be different from the last three years . . . how?”
Harry laughed.  “Does that usually get you what you want?”
Harry turned at the sound of the new voice, already knowing who it was.  “Teddy,” he said, his whole heart filling up.  “I thought you were coming back tomorrow.”
“Yes,” Harry said faintly.
“Harry,” Draco said, low and eager and affectionate in Harry’s ear, and then his hand was wrapping around Harry’s cock again, this time slick with lube.
“What about my—”
Harry looked around for more magic, but had to duck when a small pot, a roll of paper, and a feather came sailing out of the room behind him.  The items stopped in the air in front of the man, floating there at a wave of the man’s stick, which he again slipped into his sleeve.  Opening the pot, the man dipped the tip of the feather in it, then took it out, closed the pot, and slipped the pot in his pocket.  The feather and roll of paper he plucked out of the air, and then held out to Harry.  “Write down the name of your cousin.”
“It’s going to last
Even though Draco looked wretched, he still rolled his eyes.  “I’m a selfish
Lifting himself up, Harry moved above Draco so that his cock slid along Draco’s milky white hip bone—again, and again.
have all gone to Azkaban. After the war—”
“I thought what you tell your therapists is between you and your therapist.”
“It was the best House,” Harry said.  “You want to come upstairs?  You can show me more of that magic you know.”
Harry didn’t know what to say.
“I thought I was doing something good,” Teddy said finally.
“For me?” Harry said, taking it in surprise.
Nyala’s presentation was perhaps the most impressive. She hadn’t cast spells for almost an entire week, which had proved a problem in some of her other classes, but this repression of magic allowed her to create a tiny dark shadow out of thin air. It wasn’t an Obscurus—too easily subdued for that, and not something that could cause damage, but the demonstration of knowledge was still impressive. Harry found himself wishing that Malfoy had thought of it, because surely he would have been able to create such a thing with a history of repression of Occlumency skill, and Harry very much wanted him to succeed.
“Shoulders down,” Harry said. “It will help with your breathing too.”
“What do you mean, the end of the world?”
“Oh, here we go,” said Savage.
, but Harry didn’t know how to explain that he thought it was terrible that Narcissa and Lucius had encouraged Draco to hide himself.  The worst part of it was, Narcissa and Lucius had wanted to protect Draco, and that was understandable.  They’d even been trying to make Draco get along with people better, and in some ways that went hand-in-hand with being a good person—but it wasn’t the same.  Harry didn’t know how to say all that, so what he said was, “I’d say you’ve been indecorous.  Yeah.”
“That’s nothing.”  Draco tossed his head.  “
“I don’t care what you think about me,” Harry said, furious. “It’s him you’re putting in a dangerous situation.”
The scritch scritch scritch of Duggins’s quill filled the mostly empty office. Harry didn’t want to have to wait ten minutes for a follow up question, but he also wasn’t sure he wanted to confide in Duggins to begin with. Still, these sessions were protected by Unbreakable Vow, and Harry needed someone to talk to about it. He’d already talked to Ron and Hermione, but there was only so much talking about Teddy they had time for. He didn’t want to keep burdening Andromeda with his worries either.
Not knowing what to do, Harry squeezed Draco’s shoulders tighter.  He didn’t know what had brought this on at all.
It tasted like Mafoy’s spells, mild and familiar.
“I am afraid there aren’t big machines,” Mister Malfoy said.  “Nor beds with straps.”
“All right,” Sibanyoni said again, his tone exactly the same. “Okay. Too intimate. Too invasive. Too woo-woo.” He waggled his fingers, demonstrating woo-woo. “Not all things are for everyone.”
The door opened, and Harry found he couldn’t say anything.
, Harry realized belatedly, as Malfoy turned and walked back to the end of the queue, and then the Boggart was already turning into a non-mag rifle. Henrietta Bones, Harry noted, looking at the trainee, but she was Susan’s daughter, and probably more aware than most of actual dangers non-magical people could present. Her father was non-magical. Bones cast
“Draco.” Harry held him tighter, then kissed the back of his neck. “Yes. As long as we get to do it again.”
“He was imprisoned,” Draco said.
“Living homeless, snatching crusts of bread from rubbish bins, that sort of thing.”  Draco went on idly doodling over the book, which was slowly repairing itself.
“Didn’t your father tell you?” Rodolphus said, drawing back.
boots.”
“What—what colour will it change into?” Harry kept his shoulders straight, even though he was a bit worried about having a differently-coloured thumb.
Harry gritted his teeth again. “What, you think that justifies it? You think that justifies someone who would do that to a witch—a nineteen-year-old witch, just because she’s dating a non-magical bloke?”
“Shocked,” Malfoy muttered, but he didn’t sound as amused anymore. His face angled away.
“They didn’t stop that,” Teddy pointed out. “You did.”
“Of course not, Auror Potter.”  Alby was beginning to look alarmed.
“You said a mobile was a telephone,” Harry accused, confused enough that he forgot all about the green cloth.
“Well,
in touch with his feelings; maybe a healthy person would be upset that Vinicius had left him.
“Why-ever not?” Malfoy asked. When Travers made a face, Malfoy went on. “We were friends. Or we would’ve been,” Malfoy added quickly, “had I been the friends-having type.” When Travers seemed unconvinced by this, Malfoy said, with all the triumphant grace of someone who had thought up something clever, “You invited me to the pub!”
“He’s not here to stop me now,” Harry told Alby, still pointing his wand.  “Is there an antidote?”
“Where did you come from?” asked an elderly man, rushing up to Nyala.
Draco had a terribly distressed look on his face.  Maybe Harry’s table manners really were just that bad.  Or maybe he wasn’t allowed to have the bacon after all.
“I’d heard no word of you since the war. You’re saying Father has seen you?”
“Malfoy.”  Harry didn’t know why he was so relieved, as though something frantic had be pushing him this whole time, and only now did he feel like he could breathe.  Sinking down to the ground, Harry sat next to him, broom cast to the side.
“What do I need to bring?” Malfoy said at last.
how much I should eat?”  Malfoy’s voice was low and furious.
“Have you thought about,” Hermione began, but then couldn’t seem to finish.  “I mean, when you say, ‘messed up’—”
Harry had been folding the parchment and tucking it into his robe, but now he couldn’t help himself.  He smiled.  “Gawain Robards.”
“Then why are you trying to get me to talk about it?  It’s in the past.”
“Nothing,” Draco said, opening another door.  Inside was a bedroom covered in a fine layer of dust.
“Why isn’t that happening?” Lee asked, holding out his own microphone.
“Why, Potter,” Malfoy purred.
“Draco,” Harry said again, his voice strained.
“What?” Malfoy said, blinking.  “Of course, she does.”
Scowling, Harry rubbed the back of his hand. “Say what you’re trying to say, Ron.”
“Love.”
“And can you, er . . .” Malfoy hesitated. “Can you tell me again? What to do. With the memory. I think it—it helped.”
Harry glanced up at her. “Or yours?”
,” Draco said, pointing at one of the robes.  “Put this on,” he said, handing it to Harry.  “It’s cool outside and we can’t Apparate directly to your house.”
Harry didn’t know what incorporeal meant, but he thought it sounded nice.  “So, she can’t . . . I can’t, um.”  Harry sort of wanted to pet it, but he already knew that was stupid.  Draco had just said she couldn’t feel it.
“Are you afraid for your godson’s life?” asked another reporter. “Magical law enforcement is dangerous career choice.”
“Wh-what do you mean?” said the man. “Who
“No one’s ever been like you before,” Malfoy said. “I just wanted you to know. No one will be again.” Opening the door, he walked out of it, snapping his sleeves down with a spell as he went.
“It usually works.”
Draco sounded so concerned, to the point where he was beginning to sound like one of those nice teachers who said bad things about him.
“Harry.”
“Er.”  Harry didn’t know what else to talk about.  “How?”
because you’re too much of a—”
Tentatively, Harry put his arm around Draco’s shoulders, and Draco just—melted, going boneless against him, face pressing into Harry’s chest.
“Malfoy,” he said.  “I’m asking.”
“I had hoped that the Order of the Phoenix would keep him busy,” Harry said, half expecting to be asked what the Order of the Phoenix was. Kingsley and Kavika had announced the resurrection of the Order directly after Kingsley’s resignation, repurposing the Order into a public-facing political organization rather than a secret team of guerrilla spies fighting against militant coup. Duggins, however, didn’t ask about the Order, and Harry went on, “But when I told Teddy the Order needed volunteers, he said he was ‘busy with other things.’ I just don’t know
“You do hear what you’re saying? Bigoted death cult.” Harry held out his hand, palm up. “Name-calling.” He held out his other hand, balancing the two as though they were scales. “Murder,” he added, looking at one hand, “not giving him a chance.” Harry looked at the other hand, still weighing. “Imperius, torture, bigoted slurs, did I mention
Grabbing his orange juice, Harry took a sip to swallow the lump of scone in his mouth.  “Do you fly—with your arms?”
Harry grit his teeth.  “Lorica Ludville.  The person I arrested yesterday for possession of a highly illegal brew.  For some reason, she’s already been transferred out of Azkaban.”
“A bad person,” Draco said dismissively.
“Which is why you’re going to do it again,” said Robards.
“It’s named after someone,” Harry said.
The Ministry of Magic was reached by a public toilet in London.  They had to flush themselves in, which Harry thought was a joke at first.  Once flushed, they arrived into a large hall, which had a fountain with statues in the middle.  Harry wanted to stop to look, but Draco was striding on toward a set of golden gates at the other end.
“I shouldn’t have.  I was—confused.”
Finding the Life Water was easier than Harry had thought it might be, mostly because it was in the cabinet next to the potion that had fallen on him.  After confirming it was the Life Water through one of Draco’s diagnostic spells, Harry grabbed a bottle of it.  He then  cast a Ward Record on the Seeing-Eye Ball so he would be able to see whether anyone came in or out of the room.
Harry put out his hand for Draco to take, and then they were squeezing through the cold black, straight into Draco’s laboratory.
“Why wouldn’t I be?”
Harry looked at him, feeling as though a chasm separated them and Harry was frozen.  He couldn’t even move to reach across.
“I’m not an Auror any more,” said Harry.
“I don’t ever want to see you again!” Draco yelled down after him, then slammed the door.
is,” Harry said, his voice still kind.
Duggins’s quill went scritch scritch scritch, and Harry waited. He waited, and he waited, and he waited. “What do you think?” he asked at last.
“And . . . a cousin?”
“Yes,” Malfoy said again.  He lifted his chin.
Malfoy looked stunned at this, his eyes absolutely wide. “But,” he began, then started again. “But—I tried to be an Auror; I wanted to prove I—I—I’m trying to be someone different; someone you could—”
The words came out before Harry knew what he was going to say, and then they were there, and he couldn’t take them back.  “I’ll snog you.”
“I—” Draco choked.  “I would,” he said, and then began to cry.  “I would!  I would!  You
“Malfoy—”
Harry Summoned a glass of water, then made it cold, because that was nice. “Here,” he said, holding it out to Malfoy, but Malfoy didn’t drink it. Harry Summoned chocolate next, because they were nice as well, but Malfoy took it and didn’t eat that either. “What can I do?” Harry said, squatting next to the chair, so he could be closer to eye level.
“Then there will be more than three?”
“Inventory for a potions apocalypse?”
Jesus, Malfoy.
“I read that in the
“Calm down, Potter.”
“With all the voices.”
“I’ve already forgiven him,” Harry said, feeling a little defensive. He’d talked to Doctor Yin about this a lot.
Slowly, Malfoy’s eyes opened. “I can’t understand you.”
“How’s that working for you?” Harry said at last.
“Sorry,” Harry said.
The driver went on like that, mostly making conversation while Harry occasionally agreed to things.  He’d had to ride in a cab once before when the Dursleys had forgot him at a Tesco, but that time the Tesco people had helped him call the cab.  Uncle Vernon had been angry because he had had to pay the driver when Harry had got back to Number Four, and Harry didn’t really have an idea of how much a taxi cost.  Still, he had to get to the warehouse, so he could find the criminal, who might or might not be Cecil Vance.
“Like this,” Draco said.  “Gather the water suspended in the air around you—” He showed Harry with his wand—“and
“I’m not as interested in Draco Malfoy as

the wizarding world isolate the UK. There are so many benefits to magic—have you seen non-magical medicine?”
For a moment, Harry was caught off guard, and then a sudden silence fell. The eyes of the other trainees turned to them—Harry could always feel it, the way he could always feel when the tension in the room became about him being Harry Potter instead of an instructor, the way everyone watched to see what he would do in a way they watched no one else. He remembered what Malfoy had said:
“I would never tell anyone anything about you that you didn’t want me to share,” Harry said.
“You’re not going to teach me?” Harry said, taking the wand and trying not to sound disappointed.
“Is it Draco Malfoy?” asked another—Walter-someone, Harry remembered, the reporter for
“My reflexes are too fast,” Malfoy told the class loudly. “And I’m too tall. That’s something for the history books—Auror Potter likes shorter partners. You heard it from me first.”
“You did tell me that, actually.”
The faint smile came back.  “Yes, Harry.  With customers.”
, Harry.  When you’re eleven you’re grown up, and no one reads to you unless you’re pathetic.  I always have to teach you things, don’t I?”
“My mum would never have fought the Dark Lord,” Malfoy said, pulling away and dropping back down to sit on the couch.  “She’s much too smart.”
“Seriously,” Malfoy went on. “How are we all doing? Bored, yet? Worried? Tired? Hungry?”
“Will you leave the Academy?” asked another.
“And who are you, anyway?  You never answered me.  You’re extremely uninformative for an Auror.  Who’s your boss?”
The door to the lift opened, revealing a long corridor with doors on either side.
just like a prayer.
Draco’s smirk softened a bit.  “It’s okay, Harry.  I won’t tell anybody you can’t read.”
“Yes, please,” Harry said, since he was just finishing off the beef.
The restrictions were the reason illegal potions trade was booming.  Potions could be brewed with little to no magic, and their effects could be quite magical indeed.  Thus, in order to wield the power to which they had once been accustomed, some of those placed under magic restriction turned to brewing.  Draco Malfoy had got ten years of restrictions.  He still had six years to go.
“Does it hurt?” Harry felt himself begin to panic; Draco’s voice had sounded so—”
, and
Years ago, Malfoy had been talking to his group of friends, sharing his ideas, absorbing their reactions. Later, the group had moved on, and Malfoy had stayed behind. He had noticed Harry, waited for him. Then he had stepped on his face, leaving him invisible, bleeding, vulnerable.
Draco was coming over to them, still holding the phial of Imperius potion.  His lip curled, and Harry wondered whether Draco was going to want to do something to Alby.  Draco had said he wouldn’t, but maybe he was going to do something small, like spit on him or a Bat Bogey Hex, and Harry wasn’t certain he should let him.  Harry understood why Draco would want to, but it wasn’t justice; petty revenge wasn’t something Harry often let get the better of him, which was why he was glad Draco had stopped him from choking Alby harder.  Even if Harry had just been doing what was necessary to get information out of him.
“Don’t!” Harry said, nearly dropping the bowl.  Rushing to the couch, Harry put down the bowl and got on his knees.
Harry let him, anxiously waiting by the door.  When Draco came out, he let Harry take him back to the sofa and help lay him back down.
“Oh, Draco.”  Harry pulled him close again.  “Shh,” Harry murmured, stroking Draco’s hair.  “Shh.”
“I just didn’t expect it,” Harry said.  “Do I always dress that way?”
Kavika put her chin in her hand, contemplative. “‘Non-mags are weak and helpless. We’re practically their parents; we must shield them from our world.’ Those ideas?”
31 years
A sound filled the silence, the creak of a door. Wrenching his eyes away from the body on the ground, Harry looked up to see Malfoy slipping out of the door. Then Harry quickly turned back to his trainee, who had apparently been roused by the sound of the door as well.
“He’s fine,” Harry said, still trying to make his voice sound deep.  “I really need a number to call a taxi, though.”
“You don’t have to.” Malfoy’s voice was as light and quick as ever. “You shouldn’t have to. I was the one that—” Finally, he looked away. “I’ll go. I can drop out. I thought we could—I don’t know what I was thinking. It never would have worked.” Malfoy turned neatly, slipping his hands into his pockets, heading for the door.
“Malfoy.”
“Edgar?” Malfoy said, sounding surprised. “I say—Edgar Travers?” Now he just sounded ridiculously posh. Who said “
“Because people often want things that might be dangerous for them,” said Doctor Yin. “For some people, that’s part of the attraction. For others, it presents a serious conflict.” Standing up, Doctor Yin came beside him, close, but not touching. “Consider this, Harry. To love, to desire—these actions make us vulnerable. Friendship, sex—they are about opening yourself, letting someone else inside you. Of course, there would be a part of you that would be reluctant to do that with someone who has hurt you.”
Slowly, Draco turned his head on the pillow to face him.  “I think it’s something very powerful, Harry.  That means counteracting it is going to be complicated.  The solution I’ve devised—there are several parts to it.  To make sure it sticks.”
All the House colours, Harry supposed.
Draco held him down and fucked him harder. “Now’s your chance.”
“I just thought you could try it,” Harry said, feeling almost as though he had done something wrong.
“It’s fine to not know what you want,” said Doctor Yin.
Harry laughed, but quickly coughed—Malfoy wasn’t laughing. He was looking away, biting his lip, scarlet beginning to curl into his cheeks. Harry hadn’t meant to embarrass him—or he had, a little, but not like this. “Malfoy—”
He was drifting slowly, like a feather, and Draco was there, strong and warm.  “Harry,” Draco said, setting him on his feet—on the ground, but not splattered like a bug at all.  Perfectly normal.  “Harry,” Draco said again, sounding frantic.  He was touching Harry’s shoulders, his face, his hair.  “Are you okay?  Did you hurt anything?”
“What are you doing?” Draco was standing directly in front of him, hands on his hips as he looked down at Harry on the sofa.  “Why are you looking at that?  Why aren’t you paying attention to me?”
Malfoy stared at him.
Draco made the antidote, and their whole world opened up.
“My dance card’s full,” said Teddy.
Mutely, Harry shook his head.  “You’ve never—I’ve never even told you that I am,” he said.  “We’ve never talked about it.”
“No,” Harry said.  “I guess I don’t.”
,” Draco said, but he was pointing it into the empty hearth, and the fire that sprang to life there was quite normal.
Apparate them, the crowds could get too large. I suppose we could show them pictures of places and people.”
“Nothing like that.  He thinks I’m . . .” Draco bit his lip again.  “He just got the wrong idea about me; that’s all.”
“What’s a Floo?”
“I . . . don’t know.” He thought of Ginny. He thought of Andre. He thought of Fiona, of Vinicius. They were all good-looking. Gorgeous, really—well, except he hadn’t thought Fiona was gorgeous at first. Her looks had grown on him. Why had they grown on him? She had been witty. Intelligent. Thoughtful. Extremely ambitious, and good at what she did. She had been a Healer, and watching her work had always made him a little hot. Like Ginny playing Quidditch. Like Andre building wizard houses. Competency. Was that something you could be into? “I like it when people are good at things,” Harry said at last.
“Oh.”
“But aren’t you—I thought you’d be happy,” Draco-in-Harry’s body said, finishing lamely.
“I suppose we can only ever change as far as we extend.”
Just.  The thought of Draco being open enough to be with someone like that made Harry want him more.
“Oh, is Ron available?” asked Vinicius, looking interested.
But when Harry went to question Ludville again, Savage held up Ludville’s thumb, and it was cerulean.  That meant she’d taken Wood-Eye Lye, and none of her statement was admissible.  She would have to be questioned again once the Wood-Eye Lye wore off, and Savage took over her case from there.  Harry turned to figuring out why Ludville would falsely implicate Vance, who—when Harry questioned him about it—claimed to have never heard of her.
Harry took a deep breath.  “Draco—”
“Slapped him,” Ron supplied, affably.
Harry thought his expression was enough of a reply, but then again, Malfoy wasn’t looking at him. He was strolling about Harry’s office, looking at the shelves, acting as though he owned the place.
“How could you not know they. . . ?”  Mister Malfoy shut his mouth.
23 years
Harry gave her a look, because she knew he never wanted to discuss anything again. Swallowing a sigh, he did it anyway. “They don’t actually know me. The people who fall in love with me. I mean, besides Ginny and Andre. Maybe Sarah. No, not Sarah. Fiona.”
Harry looked around, noting the bright patches of colour that dotted the countryside.  It all looked so fresh and innocent, just like a painting.  Paintings didn’t have insects either.
always hate you; you’re a liar.”  Draco’s crying had sounded gut-wrenching before, but it was even worse now—he’d cried so much already, there weren’t even tears now, just these mutilated sharp sobs that wracked his body over and over again.  “You’re a liar,” he said.  “I hate you.”
“In-between birthday?” Harry asked, distracted as Mister Malfoy pointed at the cake and said something.  An
Harry wasn’t haunted. He could rest. He was allowed to rest.
“Do you expect me to cry about it?”
“I’ve only thought about what I might feel,” Draco said firmly.  “I didn’t understand how—how opening yourself up could possibly be difficult for you as well.  I thought everything had to be so easy for you.  I only thought about myself.”
“Malfoy,” Harry said, frowning. “Why would you choose that memory?”
“Interesting,” Hermione said. “Do you think he’ll tell us what happened after the holiday party?”
After another minute, Malfoy came over to where Harry was applying the cream.  He carried the bottle of powder, setting it down on the table next to Harry.  “You don’t need to put it on your clothes,” Malfoy said.
Harry opened his mouth, but Malfoy looked honestly confused. He didn’t remember, Harry realized, then closed it.
“I don’t see you,” Yin said.
“My therapist.”
“You told me he was Dudley,” Kavika said, her voice sinking quite low, “only thinner and more posh. You’re allowed to feel the same as you did before. You’re allowed to be angry.”
The blood was drying sticky on Harry’s uniform, in his hair.  He could feel it in his fingernails, on the hand that had been holding Draco’s.
The silver stag had sprung from Harry’s wand, and Harry spoke to it. “Get Minister Shacklebolt. Tell him Harry Potter has an emergency in Wizengamot Administrative Services.”
Taking it, Harry looked at it suspiciously.  “What is it?”
“Look how many there are,” Harry said, gesturing to the cabinet.  “Besides, I don’t want anyone to know we’ve been here.”
“We were kids,” Harry said, turning to Ron. “I thought that meant when we grew up, we could be better. That we would be better.”
Harry knew that. They’d talked about it before. He’d talked to everyone on the list, about the things that had happened in the war. Kavika had told him to.
“Right,” Harry said.  “What if you want to do something that’s important?  More important than whether people are nice to you.”
“In warm-ups?”
Draco beamed.
“Sorry,” Harry said, too distressed about how Malfoy looked to actually feel sorry.
“It’s not sexual.”
The blond hair was lank, lacking shine.  The shoulders were spikier than Harry remembered, and the clothes were quite notably un-posh—but Harry would know him anywhere.
Harry made himself shrug.  “I don’t know him.  I guess it will be sad later.”
“But it’s a part of you.”  Harry took another step closer.
“So you decided to duel Fenrir, the infamous Death Eater werewolf?”
“I’m flattered,” said Kavika, “but you know you can find other ways to see me.”
to pay for his little wizard-fight lessons?” Greengrass looked amused, sharing this bit of gossip. “He hasn’t a penny to his name.”
“Don’t say boy-lover,” Harry said.
is better than hearing about Weasley and
“No, you need to be there,” Draco said.  “I’m not sure Auror security will allow me through, but the wards will recognize you, even if you’re young.”
Harry looked down at his hands, the scar.
“Show you what?”
, Potter. Don’t you think I know that?” Malfoy came closer. “They killed women and
Harry had just set down his notes, picking up his wand to try a new experiment, when something caught the corner of his eye—a flash of silver. It flashed again, then moved closer, a shimmering little cloud at last near enough to identify: an insect. Specifically, a round, fuzzy insect, with wings that barely seemed big enough to carry its plump little body—a bumblebee, in everything but colour. This was because the bumblebee was a Patronus.
“Harry Potter?” asked the woman.
It made the tears prick right through Harry’s eyes.  He pressed his face hard against Draco’s chest so that the tears wouldn’t come, and he wanted to kiss Draco back—on the cheek, on the forehead, like Draco had kissed him.  Harry had never done anything like that before, and it was weird, and awkward, and embarrassing.  He didn’t know why he wanted to do it; it just sounded nice.  It sounded so nice, like maybe Draco wouldn’t leave him again if he kissed him.  Maybe Draco wouldn’t ever leave him, but when Harry pulled back enough to try it, his mouth was full of mucous from crying and his teeth were clenched so he wouldn’t sob, and he didn’t know how to pull Draco’s face down to him, so he didn’t try it.
“I’m hilarious.  You told me so.”
feature ‘Draco, Disowned’ poofing about with—”
“And I’ll bet he wanted to go back to the Manor as well,” Hermione said.
proceed without a Deal—”
“Vinicius,” said Sibanyoni. “Boyfriend. Auror. Boyfriend who is an Auror. Was a boyfriend, is an Auror. How did that make you feel, breaking up?”
“Oh God.” Harry gulped, relieved Draco had let him go because he was overwhelmed; it was overwhelming; no one had ever done this to him before. He didn’t even know whether he liked it, except that he did—he did like it; the way Draco was touching him made him want more and more and more of him, the way his kisses did, the way everything about Draco made him want more.
“But I still get into Slytherin,” Draco said in a rush.  “Not Ravenclaw.”
,” but despite the fact that the situation was superbly terrifying there was still no effect, which made the man’s next stick-swish and words more moderately terrifying.  “
Draco pressed against him. “I’ll think about it.”
Harry searched for words.  “You’re bad at interpreting my expressions.”
“Dumbledore was a manipulative moderate who
Her question triggered memory, and Harry found himself blurting, “Malfoy brought me coffee.” Looking up to see her reaction, Harry saw an expression of sympathy, which was all wrong. “There were reporters,” Harry went on, rubbing the scar again, “at the Pallas Arch, and Teddy had to disguise himself from them. Then inside—Penelope wanted to commiserate again, about Malfoy, I mean, and then Spragg wanted to put his two Knuts in about Reveal, and Gareth wanted to tell me how terrible all the press is, and the coffee was just waiting there, on my desk. Malfoy didn’t say anything; I didn’t see him. He just left it.”
“Then Draco hasn’t told you,” Andromeda said, playing a card.
“Gran,” said Teddy.
“I’m not really talking about forgiving him,” Ron said.
“He’s a trainee at the Academy.”
“New leaf.” Doctor Yin took a sip. “Leaves. He’s like a tree. How did he make trainees asking you questions feel different?”
“Fine,” Harry said, taking out his wand to Apparate away.
Uncle Vernon never remembered to be careful of Harry’s glasses when there was too much funny business.
It didn’t seem to work on Parkinson. “Sod off.”
“No!”  Malfoy held onto the parchment, which pulled him up on tip-toe as it strained toward Harry’s hand.  “What is it?  What’s going on?  Where are my mum and d—”
“Here,” Draco said, drawing it out of his sleeve.
“Those are their surnames.”  Draco frowned at him.  “But you must know that.  Don’t you know that everyone uses surnames in business?  No one calls Father ‘Lucius’; they all call him ‘Malfoy’—except for Mum.  Except Mum doesn’t call him Lucius; she calls him—” Draco cut himself off.  “Anyway, business associates use surnames, and our professors will use surnames.  So, in school, I plan to start using surnames.  I imagine we call each other by surnames in school—and still do, in public.  I bet in private we . . .” Draco darted a look at Harry, pretending he wasn’t doing it.
“Harry,” Mister Malfoy said again, even more softly.  He paused for a long time.  “I’m going to fix this potion as soon as I possibly can.  But until then . . .”  Taking a deep breath, he leaned forward.  “Until then, you’ll stay with me.  Do you understand?”
of his body was going to change into Draco’s.  Turning bright red, even though no one could see, Harry quickly put on the pants and trousers.  He wasn’t going to look at anything under the clothes, or anything.  Except for the arm, so Harry left the cuff-buttons on the shirt open.
“Oh,” Harry said again.  Thinking that sounded sort of sad, he played another card.  Maybe if Draco won the game, he would be happier.  Or at least less distracted.
“I’ll be back,” Malfoy told Rune, as Harry got out his own wand to cool down his water. Malfoy’s voice was low, but Teddy and Nyala were so quiet beside Harry that Malfoy’s voice carried to him.  Then Malfoy was standing, and Harry remembered the little breeze Malfoy had cast on him that night in October—half a year ago, now.
Pressed up against the wall, Harry stayed very, very still.
“You think that’s funny, do you?” Draco said, feigning offence but in such a preposterously high voice that Harry smiled even more.  Pointing his wand at his nose, Draco said an incantation that made his nose hairs begin growing out in ringlets.  “No laughing!”  Draco said, his high voice making the ringlets jiggle.
“What do they look like?” Harry asked, trying not to sound too excited, even though he was.
“They’ve got it wrong.”
in my league. Possibly even a notch below it.”
Harry entered his office, and there Malfoy stood, back to the door, limned by the drab dreary light through Harry’s window. His hair looked almost silvery, and Harry’s heart tightened in sympathy. They had not really talked since the mission, not privately. Trainees had interview him; students had talked to him and about him. Malfoy had returned to take his remaining exams, but that was all.
“Potter,” said Harry.
Malfoy didn’t move. “You weed the non-magical way, don’t you. Gives you something to do with your hands. Focus your mind.” Sliding his hands into his pockets, Malfoy went on, “I have the same thing with cooking. Never did it when I was younger; we had . . . . It helps. What do you do in the winter?”
“I’ve longed to meet you for a while,” said Rune Photsi, and he was even better-looking up close. About Harry’s age, he was lean, with a thick set of shoulders on him. His mobile lips were pulled into a smile that lit his whole face, below bright dark eyes and messy dark hair. No wonder half the wizarding world was obsessed with him.
“It’s disturbing how many kids have bought into it,” said Penelope. “I understand Granger’s case about going slow and getting a plan in place before we do the Reveal, but I’m beginning to think whoever’s destroying the secrecy wards has got the right idea. Just theoretically, of course. Why not just rip the wards off? Like a bandage. At least then Concealers don’t get their way.”
But Malfoy didn’t come back, and after a moment, Harry let himself breathe again. Well. Well, that hadn’t been as awful as he had felt so sure it would be. That had been almost—easy. Maybe Malfoy hadn’t even followed him into the men’s; maybe he’d just had to use the toilet. Maybe no one had noticed Harry escaping—except Hermione, and probably Ron, and they had seen him like this before anyway. They knew what to do. They gave him his time alone. Sometimes they stayed close and brought him water, but they listened to what he said he needed and didn’t do what they thought he needed instead. They didn’t touch him. They didn’t try to tell him he would be okay.
“Thanks,” Harry said, tucking the phial away.  “I’ll just be going, then.”
“When we were kids,” Ron said, “we had to do a lot of fighting alone. You in particular, Harry.”
“What is it?”
, when you said you could never . . . I—I lost myself, all the things that drove me forward. I had to start over.”
me. The way he wants me it’s—I know him. I know him, when he wants something it’s total; it’s complete; he wants . . . He’s marrying her just because he needs to be a pure-blood and make pure-blood babies. What if he’s gay? What if he only likes men? He can’t be. He’s not
“Excellent,” Mister Malfoy said.  “Would you like to come with me into the lab?”
Harry closed his eyes: rain and dirt and leaves. Growing things. An early hint of honeysuckle.
“Do people like you use hospitals?  Isn’t there some kind of—” Petunia’s voice went disdainful after all.  “Spell?”
“It doesn’t say anything about a Patronus,” said the teenager.
Mister Malfoy was still clearing the table, so Harry couldn’t see the expression on his face.  Once all the jars were out of the way, he’d laid out a parchment with a quill beside it.  Finally turning back, he said, “I’m going to do a little magic on you, Harry.  It might tingle, but it shouldn’t hurt.”
“It was a joke,” Hermione said.
Harry scanned the crowd, finding Malfoy easily enough. He had on a sleek three-piece grey suit—so much for his new style of women’s shirts and threadbare jumpers. He was dancing with Nyala, who had on an absolute cake of a pink dress and looked as though she positively glowed. Not far from them, dancing with Penelope, was a bloke in gold and red, deeper than Gryffindor red, but still striking, setting off brown skin, an extremely expressive face, and wavy black hair. Harry felt he recognized the bloke from somewhere, and he wondered why Vinicius was not talking about
Then Harry remembered the Malfoy who stepped on his face, when he was petrified under his cloak on the train. Malfoy had done it deliberately. “That’s from my father.” Harry remembered the Malfoy who had cast Imperius on Madam Rosmerta, the Malfoy who had, in the end, tried to sacrifice Harry to Voldemort and got Crabbe killed in the attempt.
“Let me tell you what I’d expect.”  Andromeda had eyes that always made him feel like she was looking at a part of him that he didn’t know he had.  “I didn’t get to meet my nephew until after she was sentenced, but I knew Cissy.”  Harry realized she meant Narcissa.  “She was the quiet one.  Even when Bella and I were screaming at each other, Cissy was placid and lovely and polite.  She did everything Mum and Dad ever told her to, except for when she married Lou.  Every emotion she ever had she wound inside herself so tight she never looked like anything except the prettiest little picture you ever saw.”
“I care what happens to you,” Harry said, just in case Draco didn’t get the point.  “It’s—it’s
“It’s all right, Harry.”
“Smile,” Ron said, putting his hand on Malfoy’s shoulder, then turning toward the library’s doors, which burst open.
“They have a good mission,” Harry agreed.
Draco shut his mouth.  “Yes.  I—you needn’t worry about my in-between birthday, Harry.  I’m thirty-two.  That’s too old for in-between birthdays.”
“Don’t even get me started on
A witch in violet blocked the view. Harry craned his neck, and the latest guests swept into the Grand Foyer. Harry’s mouth abruptly went dry.
Harry frowned, unsure of why Malfoy wasn’t afraid of mouthing off against the supposed Hero of the Wizarding World, but against a mean-faced gnome-man he was apparently pale and tongue-tied.  “It’s already done,” Harry told Alby.
she had said.
“Why not?”
“And was
“What . . . ?” Harry hadn’t expected this either.
Harry had a moment to experience fear, before his lower abdomen began to tighten, and his cock became heavier. Thicker. Oh fuck. Harry could almost feel the blood being drawn into it—was that what Draco was doing? It certainly looked like it, a long slow movement of the wand above the skin of Harry’s stomach and then a flick over his dick, another long movement above Harry’s thigh, and then a flick to Harry’s dick, like Draco was drawing blood from other parts of Harry’s body to fill his cock. Harry’s cock was hardening without the necessary feeling of arousal, but watching it rise all on its own, feeling it thicken without the consent of his own arousal—it felt like being turned on by rote force.
“Oh, right.” Fuentes turned to Bennet. “He joined V. Morty because he wanted to cherish and protect Vulnerables.”
After lunch, Draco asked Harry if he wanted to help, so they went back downstairs to the lab, and Harry helped with potions things.  A few hours later, they had a potion that was white with glimmers of silver.
“Yep,” Malfoy said, as Harry’s hand slid around his waist. Malfoy fell silent after that, strikingly stiff against Harry’s arm and chest.
“I’m sure you’ll meet him one day,” Draco said gently.
Harry worked it, arching his back as he slammed his arse back, then releasing to rock forward, then slamming back again. His mouth was filling with drool.
said in big block letters: MALFOY SON DISOWNED AFTER SCION’S SHOCKING REVELATION.
“Um.  Okay,” Harry said, hesitant, because his head felt full of snot and his eyes ached from crying, and his mouth was much too wet with tears and mucous.  He didn’t actually much feel like snogging, but it was Draco—his Draco—and he felt like he’d wanted to snog him forever.  He set the portrait of Sirius down, then leaned in toward Draco.
Harry realized. He hadn’t given it back. And Malfoy had been bragging about his failures, which wasn’t exactly bragging, come to think of it.

“I don’t have to tell you.”
“You mean you think
“Non-magborns coming out to their families and dropping the wards in a single wizarding village were already proposed in the Deal,” Teddy was saying. “Why is it any different now?”
Harry thought about the smudges under Draco’s eyes and the way he had stayed up all night brewing things, and then the way he had said,
Draco shuddered again, but he still wasn’t crying—not exactly.  Somehow it was worse, the way he was shaking.  “I’ll tell you what to do,” he said.  “I’ll tell you what to do, if you’re so fucking clueless.”  His tone was almost savage, but he was still holding onto Harry so tightly, Harry wasn’t sure he could have got away even had he wanted to.
“Mate,” Ron said.
Harry washed his face, drank some of the water from the tap. Flicking the lights off with his wand, he removed the Notice-Me-Not and followed Malfoy out, back to his family.
“And you think
Harry watched them for a few moments. They seemed young and so happy, Nyala’s puffy pink dress and Teddy’s long green robes making them look like a flower plucked from spring time. Elsewhere on the dance floor, Vinicius was dancing with Malfoy, who was definitely not the fitter of the two. Nyala had a point about the dancing, however; both Vinicius and Malfoy virtually floated, like faerie lights. Vinicius was quite possibly the best-looking bloke there, except for perhaps Ron and Rune Photsi.
“Much more impressive than a fox,” Draco said.  “Lots of foxes are scavengers, you know.  They don’t even fight for themselves, not like dragons.”
“We don’t know what it contains.”
Andromeda looked down at him, her brown eyes measuring.  “I suppose,” she said finally.  “If it means so much to you.”
“I believe I’ve already said.”  Draco went on searching the desk, pulling out drawers.  “I’m working on a case.”
“I don’t get sick,” Harry said, because he didn’t.  He just felt bad from time to time, but not like other people.  He’d never even been sick when he was a kid—not like Dudley, helpless and crying and getting his bogies everywhere.  That just never happened to Harry.
Malfoy picked up his coffee and held it out to him. “Here.”
“Oh.”  Harry put his head back on the pillow.
“More. Allies.”
“That doesn’t sound right.  Why couldn’t I just get the ingredient myself?”
“Do you think someone’s attacking the Academy?” Teddy went on, brow furrowed. “Do you think it’s like . . . a Death Eater?”
“Banish them.”
Doctor Yin flapped their hand. “I know your bio. You only have to explain what’s not printed—I’m sure there’s a lot; I just mean, I know all the acronyms.”
“Hermione says the same thing. Somehow, though, I think if I’m the one responsible for the two of you—well. We’ve got the whole world covered.” Sliding off the desk, Ron stood, moving across the room to examine the Ward Bores and leaving Harry to his work.
not Minister for Magic, is he?”
“Poor doll.” Draco stroked Harry’s hair, then waved his wand with his other hand. “Accio green toy.” He dropped his wand, and a green toy popped into his hand.
“—and have owls deliver them,” Bennet added.
“The only thing you want to keep safe is your precious
“Whatever stupid potion you want ID’ed,” Malfoy said.  “Just give it to me.”
“I guess Severus did as well.”  Draco stared into the fire.  “He killed Dumbledore and it didn’t even do anything.  Dad is still in Azkaban.”
Penelope and Savage weren’t members of Teddy’s Order. They hadn’t agreed to teach classes about the magical world to non-magicals, or anything like that. Somehow Malfoy had got them to do it, and Harry felt overwhelmed, like this new world was worth it, like this new world was possible with people like Malfoy in it.
“But don’t you . . .”  Draco bit his lip.  “Don’t you want to question me?”
“I wasn’t in danger,” Harry said.  “You were there.”
“And I would think advocating on behalf of his son would be beneath you,” Harry pointed out.
“I am.”
“Draco Malfoy.  Now what’s your cousin’s name?”
“Yes,” said Harry.  “Congratulations.”
“Since when did you become a semanticist?”
“You don’t have to,” Harry said.  “But I thought . . . if you wanted to get back to normal, you could.”
“How do I get more?” Harry asked.  “Of the indicator solution?”
“Harry,” Draco began, then stopped.  “Yes,” he said finally.  “They were fun.”
“You need?” Draco said, tone patient.
Draco had Harry stir some powders, then pull some wings off some dragonflies.  The worst part was the sound they made if you didn’t pull them out just right; you could hear them crunch.  Harry accidentally broke the head off one, but when he glanced quickly up at Draco to see whether he’d noticed, Draco was waving his wand.  A small aquarium tank appeared, complete with fish swimming in it and a tiny squid.  As it turned out, they had to scare the squid so they could get some ink from it.
“Or it can be used as mosquito netting,” Teddy was saying, holding some of the tulle. “Possibly bandages.”
“My father—”
Draco’s chest puffed up.  He looked so pleased.
At a bit longer than chin-length, Harry’s hair was only just long enough to pull back.  When he did, tying as much as he could back so it wouldn’t sit on his neck and overheat him, the bits in front usually escaped, hanging around his face.  He’d been meaning to cut it, as the annoyance of having it in his face outweighed the annoyance of having to get haircuts—and make nice with the haircutting people, who all wanted to hear what it was like to be Harry Potter.  Oh well.  Pointing his wand at his head, Harry cut the whole back part off, then tried to take it over to Malfoy.
with you?  Do you exist to make my life miserable?”
“We’re training
Harry, who had been turning away, turned back. “What?”
“Thanks,” Ron said, as Harry continued pulling him away.
“Right.” Nyala gave a jerky nod, then smoothed a lock of hair behind her ear.
“I just meant,” Harry went on, “that after the war . . . it didn’t matter so much if people thought non-mags were helpless idiots. Even if the Death Eaters didn’t get what they deserved, all of them knew it was a very bad idea to go about massacring or enslaving or touting any Grinde-mort type theories. But now with Reveal . . . It was what Grindelwald wanted, right? His whole thing was he wanted to end the Statute.”
“Yes, exactly.” Then Draco spanked him again, shocking and hard, and as Harry arched under it Draco’s cock pushed in. Ploughing familiar territory, now, it wasn’t a slow slide in; it was a harsh, solid fuck, and Harry moaned.
Harry had told the Level Ones to find a partner they could work with for the next few weeks, same as he did every year when Wandless Combat progressed into hand-to-hand. The trainees had all been moving about; Harry hadn’t really seen how Malfoy and Teddy had ended up together—whether they had been the only two left, whether Malfoy had actively sought Teddy, whether Teddy had been reluctant to join Malfoy or indifferent. Harry probably would not have been able to tell. Teddy always looked indifferent.
“What do you mean, it didn’t work?”
Though Draco’s voice was gentle, Harry couldn’t help the way his shoulders slumped at this news.
“—do you want to be a classical musician, and OD on nothing but mushrooms and piano strings?”
“Nudity?” Harry glanced at himself incredulously in the mirror. He’d intended to Banish the sweat from the vest and put it back on, but just for that, he’d leave it off. “Because I don’t dress like a nun?”
“La Reve’s milk is too sweet,” Harry said.
,” Malfoy repeated.
“No!” Malfoy’s voice was strained. “I need to be left alone. I mean, the scar does. I can be—sometimes I scratch old wounds, you see; they never heal.”
“Harry, do you think mini-Malfoy is hot?” George called after him, but Harry and Ron were already leaving.
Harry looked up at it, thinking maybe Draco was going to pop them upstairs with the magical appearing spell.  Instead, when Harry took his hand, Draco pulled, helping Harry to his feet—but then he didn’t instantly pull his hand away, and Harry tightened his grip.  Petunia held Dudley’s hand all the time; sometimes friends did it at school, but no one had ever done it with him.  Draco didn’t seem to mind it, however.
“Careful,” Malfoy said coolly.
“No, I’m meant to—I’m meant to teach them to protect themselves.” Harry stirred in the algae, suddenly frustrated by the gentleness of them, the ambient warmth of the water. “That’s what I’m meant to do; only, that’s not what Aurors are for—staying out of danger. How is it any better than sending a child to war?
“But you see how hard it is to find good help!” Alby said in his most placating way.  “You understand my worry.”
“Yes,” Malfoy said again. “Warm-ups. I’m—cold.”
After checking in with Fairchild, Harry went to find Teddy. Word of the other incidents had already long since spread among the students, partially aided by Harry himself, who wanted the trainees to be aware of what was happening in their own training facility. Spotting Harry, Teddy waited while all the other students left his First Aid and Minor Magical Healing class, then approached Harry in the corridor. “Hey,” Teddy said, in typical Teddy fashion, sounding perfectly unruffled. It did not mean that he was unruffled.
“Er.”  Harry ground his teeth.  “I’m talking.  To you?”
“For fuck’s sake, Malfoy,” Harry said, angrier than he had thought he could be at Malfoy’s homophobia and his obvious memory of that stupid fucking kiss.  “I’m not going to molest you.”
Harry’s brain was already too crowded to think about this; there had been too many people. He was already dreading the post-graduation celebration. “Right,” he said, stopping in the corridor near the stairs. “Listen, you go on without me, okay? I’m going to pop up to my office and square things away before the pub.”
His eyes are dark and vulnerable, and without the glasses they are even more intense. We are of the same height, or maybe he's shorter a half of an inch, I don't know. He is staring at me, unmoving, and I realise he is holding his breath.
deserves that, and neither do you. Having been there myself... what am I supposed to do? Throw you out of my house, knowing full well what would happen?"
"I like your face." Gingerly I touch his eyelids, feeling a flutter of eyelashes as he blinks.
"But how did you find us?" Harry finally glances at me.
She was tall, your eyes at the same level. Long dark hair and elegance. Her face looked familiar. A light-grey dress. You looked up from her bright blue-jade shoes on the stone steps of the porch and met her eyes.
There’s a
In fact, I haven't. It's just being carried away, caught up in Noir, I've stopped thinking of Hermione as someone important for me enough to share my thoughts with, while she's always been there, as she always is, caring for me all along. No matter that there’s no question of life and death or saving the world anymore - she is there for me, any time when I need her. I am a shitty friend.
Weasley got on his feet. “He’s right, I'm leaving." He strode to the bunk and grabbed his bag. "Are you staying, or are you going with me?" He turned to Granger.
The cheerfulness of her tone made you look up. She took Father by the arm, pulling him towards the staircase. But there was something about her face, as though she’d shut down everything free and genuine and alive that had been there only a day before. It was exactly how you felt.
"Okay." I head to the door.
"Do you want to date her? Make a move!" His voice is cruel. "Ask her the fuck out! Or do you want me to have a word with her about you first?"
"It was most stupid of you indeed, Malfoy," Pomfrey snaps, "it has dislodged your broken ribs in the process. Lie still, don’t move."
. It's ridiculous to even have these thoughts, but I realise I feel safe in Potter's presence. I just do, there's no help to that. I breathe in deeply with my eyes closed, savouring the warm scent of the wool and
In an hour Malfoy beats me to the Snitch, abruptly ending my endless hovering. I let him. My heart is not in it anyway. It's going mad in my chest, waiting for what is to come once the game is over.

We say nothing for some time, then: "Do you have a girlfriend?" Potter asks.

is it?"
I kiss him, and he opens up, meeting my tongue and melting.
I cross the Great Hall and take my Mother's hand to the applause of the Dark Lord himself.
"Here, young man." She brings a vial to my lips, and I automatically swallow.
He's grown so thin and haggard. Stubble covers his jaw, dark circles under his eyes make him look ill; he looks so unkempt and exhausted... only his eyes... bright and hungry, they have this feverish unhinged glint to them that speaks of his dangerous unyielding will.
He looks up. "And if not?"
He doesn't. He is standing with his wand drawn, looking between us.
"Yes, maybe..." I force out,
"What's going on?" I ask. I feel ill. I know what. I know.
... And I am falling, falling, falling...
"I always give her books." Ron made a face. "Everyone gives her books. Everyone will, even you, no doubt. I need my present to be special."
I stare at him.
Oh, what a relief that would be to pass this task to someone else. To Snape. He is strong and always knows what to do. Unlike me, he is not a coward. I am weak and tired. So tired. I would stay in bed forever so that I wouldn't have to do anything, and maybe eventually the Dark Lord would forget about me. Snape would probably accomplish it for me. He would. He’d made a Vow, he said.
He wasn’t wrong.
"I can't do magic properly," I bristled.
Only when I pick it up, it
What do you want from me?
“What?”
"Yes, I saw her, she's alive. She's well," I lie.
I sit down, my heart thudding heavily.
"I missed you," you will say into the side of my face, your lips soft against my stubble. "But I can't…
Hell if I know. "Until it fully dissolves, I suppose." I peer at his face, looking for signs of fever, but can see none.
"Make yourself at home, I'll be in a minute," he said, handing you a glass.
I would launch at him and squeeze him in my arms and kiss every inch of his face and never let go, but there is no time for that, every passing second is the point of no return.
Fumbling helplessly in the dark
"She's in Slytherin, 7th year. Daphne Greengrass' younger sister. She's quite pretty."
The reply comes only late at night, when I'm about to fall asleep.
My face is hot. My palms are prickling, and I feel the urge to run my hand through my hair. Although our suits are almost identical, I most certainly look like a simpleton, compared to his elegant grace. He looks at me, but
"Blaise is a jerk," he says, looking at the ceiling, "Pansy and I'd fucking rattled him. What he’d done was low even by his standards."

"Fuck off!
"I'd heard you from the shower. Your screams. I just... wanted to wake you up."
To blind me without mercy.
She resumes scribbling in her essay, and I look for a while at the neat rows of equations appearing from beneath the quill.
Her dirty face is streaked with tears, twisted in a silent grimace of grief.
"Oh, well… good to know." He shuffles his feet on the rug. I don't know why he isn't leaving.
We sleep.
"Come in!" The voice shouted when I knocked at his door sometime later; someone else's voice.
Obediently I followed her. "Maybe you're right," I said. But we both knew she was doing it for me not to be alone.
We slide together, our cocks trapped between our joined palms. I move, and he moves, and I move. Until he's reaching for my lips, my gasp meeting him in the middle, until a perfect torture of his touch melts me against him in a surge of heat… I breathe into his neck, into the hot skin and fluttering pulse. I lick it. And again, making him shudder all over.
I want to follow, but Goyle next to me draws his wand: "Avada..."
I write back.
"Through
he whispers lovingly, very, very close to me.
We sit in silence for a long time.

Good.
in Harry's arms shifts, turning into someone else... Waist-long hair, feminine curves, she is much shorter than him, and he lifts her off the ground. She wraps her legs around his hips. She is... she is his girlfriend. Weasley's sister. I can't breathe. Her bare breasts press against his chest, and he bends down to kiss them. She arches into his touch, her hair flowing to the ground...
"You look like shit." He doesn't release my hand. "Was it any fun?"
"My friends would’ve never done such a thing, to anyone.

And that's what differs
I shook my head. It was so awkward, so many things had happened, wild things he'd been a part of. A lot of them I'd still want to go differently or not to happen at all, but some of them - certain things in particular - I would have never changed.
I do.
"I saw him on the porch and hid in the kitchen, and the coin...he didn't even see me, I swear, I-"
"But in a lot of things I haven't...” I drop his sleeve. "Look, Malfoy... I don't want things to get back to shitty." I wave between us. "I’ve fucked up, but I'm sorry."
"Good idea!" Gin said, "Come on!"
"Thank Merlin, you're not in robes," he says, when we are seated at the table, "Kreacher assured me you'd arrive dressed to the nines; so he insisted that I should put on my formal set of robes." He wiggles his eyebrows at me, making me laugh.
At the edge of your vision, Mr. Vice hangs by the wall, scribbling something in his tiny notebook  he always carries around.
"Gonna throw up," I utter, swallowing the bile down. I spring on my feet and dash to the loo.
"Hi." You push yourself off the doorframe and head to the coffee table by the small sofa to put the glasses down. "Composing?"
at him.
- use my wand these days, but the wards around the room are designed to recognise my magical signature.
Sliding my palms down his sides, my fingers brush the hem of his T-shirt.
"Why, pray, I was never aware of that?"
"There's just one problem." Potter scratched his nose.
He clicks the switch on the wall. "Oh… I woke you up."
I expected. The fool that I am, surrendering to Dumbledore’s mercy, I was sure it would be different. I thought that he’d hide me somewhere and find a way to sneak my parents out of the Dark Lord’s clutches. I thought he would say that I needn't worry anymore; I thought he would take my burdens away. I thought he would relieve me from the Dark Lord’s task. I thought it would be different, I thought it would be the end - of my fears, worries, danger. Little did I know, it was only the beginning. I went to him for help, but instead, he gave me another task that was different and the same as the Dark Lord’s.
"What does it have to do with this?" I nod at the folder.
I think I won’t be able to sleep, but I pass out instantly.
in the place where Harry has just stood.
I sit down on the stool and close my eyes. I haven't played for years, and I think I have probably forgotten everything, but as soon as my fingers touch the keys, my hands know what to do. The melody returns to me, alive and vivid, the airy notes of the old Wizard Waltz filling the room as my fingers grow confident. I realise I am grinning and swaying to the music with my eyes closed. When I open them, I know what I am going to find: every lantern and lamp in the room is glowing, all the candles in the ancient chandelier are alight.
"Okay." Gingerly, I rotate the spoon in the bowl.
It's someone else.

She shouts in Granger’s face, grabbing a fistful of her hair.
He drops into the armchair, and only then do I realise that the Room has taken the appearance of a cosy single bedroom with a narrow bed, an armchair, and a bedside table. There is even a little door on the back wall, very much like a bathroom door. A window on the wall shows a moonlit lawn and a grove in the distance. An illusion no doubt, as we are deep within the castle.
