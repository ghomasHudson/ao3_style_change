Well. There was no point being maudlin. This was a brave new world, and he was going to find his new place in it. Beginning with unpacking everything, which took an extraordinarily long time because Hermione had made his trunk Expandable, and his didn’t quite have her knack for finding everything in it. It was dark by the time he was roused from his packing by a knocking at the door, and when he checked the time he found it was just past seven. It was probably Hermione, here to make sure that his room was organised in the most efficient way.
“Your mother said that to you?” said Harry wonderingly. He tried to imagine Molly Weasley saying something like that to Ron. It would probably have been the end of Ron’s attempts at dancing or love-making, possibly forever.
She looked pale and fragile, curled up on the bed. Harry took pity on her and scooped her under his arm.
Grimmauld Place had felt haunted when Harry went back for two weeks over the summer. It was haunted, obviously, but –
“You can’t!” His voice cracked. He stared at Harry with boiling anguish. “Please, Harry. This friendship with you – it's one of – I wake up in the mornings and I roll out of bed and see the face of a horrible rotten bastard in the mirror, and I want to die. But then I think
There are many things that Harry regretted in his life, for example, listening to Hermione’s bloody idea and landing himself in this mess.
Potter was in a similar state, except for an annoyed expression that Draco was sure was what he had on his face, he was puzzled. Draco waited for the question.
Draco was confident in not getting hit by any spell for the two seconds he spent looking at the clock, but how wrong he was.
“That whoever kissed Malfoy must be either imperious-ed or out of their mind!” Ron seemed to want to carve this as a fact into everyone’s mind.
As soon as the words left Harry’s mouth, he regretted it as Malfoy flinched violently and took a few steps back.
But now that Draco has already confessed himself, even though it wasn’t his own intention, it still broke walls restraining both boys. Pansy doesn’t care about holding back anymore. She is fully in scheming mode.
They were in the ROR, decorations hung on every wall, candles blazed with light, soft music rang through the room, creating a peaceful feeling. The delicious scent of treacle tarts drifted into Harry’s nose, and it would make his mouth water, if not for the twenty or so students sitting around Malfoy, waiting for an explanation.
With the pain interrupting his senses, he could only stand there and watch as the ropes soared towards him and clung onto his body.
Harry really didn’t want to hurt Draco, even if he was such a sneaky bastard sometimes. Whatever Draco is planning to do, he must stop him before the damage that’s too late to reverse happens.
“Harry, tell me the truth. That wasn’t all he said right?” Hermione looked calmly at the boy who lived.
He fought against his wishes and instead of comforting him, he stood behind Draco, and said those words that he’d regret later on with all his life.
Harry thought that well Malfoy had confessed his crush, why not take the chance, and go for it? What could be a loss?
They were planning something; Harry is just almost positive about it. Although he still wasn’t sure if Malfoy had anything to do with it.
Harry had known about the crush those two had on each other for a while now, and he wasn’t worried that they won’t get together in the end. Ron was dense but Hermione wasn’t if Ron really didn’t make the first move, Harry was sure as Dumbledore’s left kneecap that Hermione would.
“Oh, he’s*hic* no one.” Draco laid his head on his hand, “Just an arrogant prick that does not know anything other than the fame going to his head.”
“-you alright?” Harry only caught the last few words of the sentence that Hermione was saying. Only then did he realise that he was deep in thought, about Malfoy.
Yes, it was hotter than anything, his body was on fire and his mind was running at 20 miles per minute. He tried to think, who did this and how could he possibly get out of this situation unharmed. But the more he thought, the more blood rushed to the south.
Harry rubbed at his eyes, fondled around on the ground, looking for his glasses, and when he found them, he saw an empty broom shed, with no blondie insight.
They swished back to the source of the sound and Harry caught a glimpse of platinum blond hair before the person dashed off the other way of the corridor.
“I’ll…being going now,” Draco muttered after the silence turned too awkward to handle. Duh, who sits there doing nothing after confession with the person that you confessed to for half an hour? Waiting for their response? Merlin NO! Draco does not want his heart crushed hours before his grand escape.
Draco’s mask wavered, he gave them a tight smile, “Thank you, I’ll be heading to bed now, we have double DADA tomorrow.”
“Ew! Who in their right mind would want to kiss that ferret!” Draco peered around the corner and saw Weasley sticking his tongue out, “They must have been forced or something!”
The broken windows let in the dimmed lighting from the setting sun, if he ignored the broken furniture in the room and the fact that it’s Malfoy that he was talking to, Harry could almost imagine this as a romantic scene.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck, his mind was blank, what should he say? Tell the truth? He considered that for a moment, Hermione seemed to be easy enough to talk to. But replaying all the scenes of Hermione with Malfoy, it didn’t really seem appropriate.
Draco closed his eyes waiting for the feel of freedom once again when nothing happened, he peeked open an eye to see a very confused Potter and a pissed off Snape.
“How could you say that Harry! HE bullied us and made fun of us for years!” Ron exclaimed; eyes were blown wide at his friends’ reaction.
“I-It’s not funny, Potter, better scram back to you’re stinky Gryffindor nest before I take house points off you for- “
The intrusion was hot and uncomfortable, especially when it swept across the top of his cavern it would always tickle. But the sensation was so new and…lewd, he couldn’t help but let out a small moan, that only enlarged Potter’s self-ego.
Oddly, Malfoy had also only drunk once. Which meaning he was not as dirty as Harry thought, or maybe he just had more meaningful secrets.
Still deep in thought, but his mind slowly switched the topic to Malfoy, while hie eyes are subconsciously drawn to his lean frame, Harry vaguely notices that a hand shot up next to him.
The memory of the dark mark burned his mind before he could relive that horrid moment, Draco snapped out of it and turned towards a worried Potter.
“Didn’t Malfoy kiss a Gryffindor? Do you have any idea who it might be?” Hermione switched the subject, Harry let out a sigh.
A body was lying on the ground, twitching. The mob of blond hair confirms that it was Draco Malfoy, currently lying on the ground, chest bleeding fast and unstoppable.
“I-I’m not! I’m just saying that if we blackmail him, we’d be doing the same thing he’s doing, which makes us just as bad as him.” He tried to reason with the redhead.
Harry knows clearly why Hermione is talking for Malfoy. And he really likes it. But Hermione can come around this, however, it might never appear to Ron that Malfoy can change. Harry doesn’t blame him, the Weasley’s and Malfoy’s have been at each other’s throats for as long as he could remember.
“H-how dare h-he *hic* say that t-*hic* to me!” Draco slurred between hiccups. He often went to this bar, to get his mind off his ignorant crush. Not many people here knew him since he was always under a false name, Dave.
Harry didn’t know if Malfoy had read his mind or something, but the next second Malfoy was already running through the door, slamming it behind him.
He slowly pulled away, leaving Malfoy stunned in silence, slightly trembling, with Harry’s hand still on his waist.
He thought that Potter at the least didn’t hate him, if he dared, he could even trick himself to thinking that Potter liked him.
With that depressing thought in mind, he sat down next to Potter, who was already down on his golden arse.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about, Nott.” Malfoy pulled on his façade and said coolly. Or as cool as he could be, blushing a vivid shade of red.
Draco’s legs gave out, he whimpered and fell to the ground, his hands rose to grab a hold of something. Unfortunately, his whole body was bound. He could only pant as he dropped to the ground, trying his best to keep his thighs together and not falling over.
He watched as the Horcruxes were destroyed, one by one, with each he felt the Dark Lord weakening. Lastly, the shock of Snape’s memories, his love to Harry’s mother; the truth of Snape’s past; and what Harry had to do: destroy the last Horcrux—himself.
“That whoever kissed Malfoy must be either imperious-ed or out of their mind!” Weasley exclaimed, while Draco just covered his mouth with his hand to stop himself from laughing.
“But that bravery he seems to gather out of nowhere, and that luck that kept him alive all these years really amazes me. He should just change his nickname to ‘The Boy Who Just Wouldn’t Die’!” He exclaimed, not noticing the frown on the boy next to him. “Despite all his stupid Gryffindor personalities, it’s actually very hot when he pulls his hair when he can’t solve a question; he likes to scratch his cheek when he’s embarrassed; and that biting on his quill should be banned! Sometimes I think God made this guy just to torment me.” Draco ended his ramble with a sigh.
“Stop acting like some three-year-old you two, Draco has news for us, just sit down and listen, love.” The last part was directed towards Pansy.
“As expected from the top girl,” Pansy smirked, trying to lighten the mood. This has been the most civilised conversation she’s had with any Gryffindor ever.
He knew he wasn’t going to do anything else except tear himself apart physically and emotionally if he stayed any longer. Ignoring the gasps from the golden trio, he sprinted down the corridor as fast as possible from sight.
“I said I’m fine! I don’t need your pity, although if you could release this kind of magic, I expected the Dark Lord to be gone already.” Harry could make out a little sneer through the dust on Malfoy’s face.
Harry wants to point out that he IS the bloody saviour of the world (not that he’d ever admitted it properly), and that he does NOT walk around Hogwarts as if he owned the school. But in case drunk Malfoy tends to find the urge to hex him before Harry got the juicy information from him, he decided to just shut up.
Sighing, Draco picked up the new cloth beside him and began to wipe the spilled tea that lad overflowed.
Then he just sat there, stunned, as the others also stared at him, unable to process the fact that Malfoy would ever kiss a Gryffindor.
“Yes, I know. But he was just following in his father's footsteps! He was taught to be like that!” Harry was also yelling now. How could Ron not understand? It wasn’t right!
There was Potter, or Harry, as Draco liked to call in his mind. Even after everything he still couldn’t get that idiot out of his head. He had to admit, that stupid schoolboy crush never subsided.
Harry had looked everywhere—even the broom shed—but he was nowhere to be seen. He even went up to Parkinson and she didn’t know. How was he supposed to talk to someone you can’t even find?
He told himself it was because of the confession. Harry never had any love as a kid, and because of that he valued love greatly, he wouldn’t blame anyone entirely for their actions if it were because of love. He couldn’t bring himself to hate Malfoy for his actions over the course of the years at Hogwarts.
Every time when he thinks of the Golden Boy, Draco imagines him being surrounded by pretty girls, it was revolting, but he just couldn’t stop. Because he knows what he really desires is to sit next to him, as his partner.
That voice that had haunted him for years, turning him into a wreaking mess, and the image of who it belonged to sprang into Draco’s head.
Draco was confused as to why they let it go so easily, it wasn’t like them. But ignoring the throbbing in his head telling him that something bad is going to happen, instead he also bid his friends good night and laid back on the bed.
“Well…” He wracked his brain for some kind of excuse. But soon dismissed the idea because Hermione would just see right through it.
They were both living with muggles, not using magic unless in urgent emergencies. This way, the other wizards would think they’re dead because they can’t detect their magic signals. Or rather, Draco didn’t even have his wand. After Potter snatched it in the battle of the Manor, he’d never seen it again.
He slowly opened his eyes and saw that everyone was looking at Millicent, expecting her to finish her turn. The only ones that paid attention to him were Hermione and Neville. Neville just stared at him weirdly, or maybe out of sheer curiosity, but looked away fairly soon. However, Hermione kept on checking him from top to bottom with something in her eyes that said: You, me, talk later.
Harry couldn’t believe that McGonagall trusted him to stay out of trouble after everything his existence had caused.
He’s never told anyone this, but Draco is actually afraid of the dark, maybe it was from staying in the manor for too long, the emptiness and pitiful darkness always got to him.
“Draco’s a Malfoy, he’s never had many emotions in his life. All purebloods do that, they don’t show affection, not even to their kids.” Pansy sighed, thinking about her own childhood, “They are really sensitive to things like feelings, that’s why they’re always sharp towards others, they don’t know how to show emotions, nothing but negative ever finds their way through their masks.”
Draco peered a little closer to the man in front of him, he somewhat looks like Potter…wait…no way….
And so, every day, Draco would pick fights with Potter with every chance he got. Then at night, back at the Slytherin dorms, Pansy and Blaise, being the only ones who would accept Draco’s crush, had to listen to him ramble about “Potter this” and “Potter that”. By now, every time they see the Gryffindor, their brains would automatically check out Potter, see if his eyes are really that green; or his cheeks really look that chubby, or his hair seems so soft. It is really killing them, and if they cannot get Draco over his obsession with Potter soon, they will die from the word ‘Potter’.
She doesn’t know why she’s telling Granger this, but from how Draco had said she’d stood up for him yesterday, Granger wasn’t that bad after all.
Currently, the Golden trio is waiting in the DADA classroom, early of course, due to the insisting of Hermione.
The sound startled Harry and he jumped from his chair, with his wand in position. And let out a sigh of relief when he saw the brown owl outside the window next to his bed.
He watched as his limp body laid in the forbidden forest, the death eaters laughing, Narcissa Malfoy standing over him and announcing his death. Harry couldn’t have been more grateful. Then there was the dream or heaven. King Cross station in white fluffy clouds, the shivering body beneath the bench, and what Dumbledore had said.
But seeing as today they could go to Hogsmeade’s, Harry decided to leave the Malfoy thing for a little while longer, and have some fun, just in case his head explodes due to overstressing before he even had the chance to seduce Draco and kill the Dark Lord.
She slowly lifted open her heavy eyelids, it felt like someone had done a ridiculous prank and stuck lead to her eyes.
Granger nodded in understanding. She’s probably learnt a lot about pure-blooded wizarding families from books, was Pansy’s guess.
He didn’t know if he and Draco’s relationship counted as ‘dating’. On one hand, he wanted to feel the urge to reach for his glass of fire whiskey, because that would mean Draco had come to terms with his decision, and they’d be official.
Draco only wanted to drink until midnight and think about how annoying and oblivious Potter is. But the fates apparently didn’t like that.
Sometimes he’d call out Potter’s name in the dark, listening to it echo in the cold apartment. He wished he could say it to the actual person, but Draco did not live in fantasies. He knew that as the defeater of the Dark Lord, the saviour of the wizarding world, Potter was far beyond his reach.
Everything would be way easier if you’d just died the first time!” The Slytherin sneered, but his posture seemed to relax just a tiny bit.
“This is strange…” Harry murmured to himself, as he was the only one in the dorms at this time, everyone else had gone to dinner.
Draco was feeling quite proud of denying Potter’s wish when he felt something rough grab him from behind and gasped. The boy used the opportunity to shove his tongue forcefully into Draco’s mouth.
“What? Didn’t like the domination taken all out of you?” Harry snickered; Malfoy looked so…so…. delicious when he was flushed all over. Harry wanted to see more of that side of Malfoy.
He didn’t know what to do, his main concern was having a proper talk with Malfoy, all the Voldemort thingies are buried in the depths of his mind.
“You agree with me, right?” Weasley growled, “That git doesn’t deserve to kiss any Gryffindor, they probably just wanted to mess with him.”
“Well, he has these stupid emerald eyes that you could always get lost in; those wrinkled clothes that he never irons or changes; that tuff of messy hair that pops up all the place; and those amazing lips that you just want to desperately have a taste of them.” Draco sighed into the air, eyes and mind drifting away to a certain Saviour of the Wizarding World.
When Draco was drooling over Potter’s lean body, he sighed and suddenly the ropes tightened. Draco couldn’t help but let out a squeak at the contact, especially when the heat is still there and his hard-on was in plain sight.
When he was going to use plan Z, a place popped into his head. What about the Room of Requirement? Malfoy should know about it since he and Umbridge did catch them in fifth year…With that thought in mind, Harry sprinted towards the seventh floor.
Now it was Harry’s turn to become speechless, he’s never really thought about what would become of them after they confessed, would they count as boyfriends? That word just sounded weird inside his head. He’d always expected Malfoy to bolt off and never show up again.
The darkness engulfed his vision, as he walked along the grounds. He’d used a dilutional charm to sneak out of the dormitories, even if the knight on the painting did scowl at him for disturbing his beauty sleep.
“I- “Draco was choking on his own words. IT WAS ALL HIS FAULT FOR BEING SO STUPIDLY ATTRACTIVE! It wasn’t like Draco didn’t want to get over Potter, a stupid crush that’d never work out, but every time he sees him, he just wants to sit there and watch him, drooling all day.
“What?” Draco cocked his head towards the man who calls himself Harold, “I’ve never told you my name! Also, I don’t love you!” He exclaimed.
“Lucius and I had a great big disagreement because he refused to let Draco wear the ancient Black robes. Obviously, I didn’t want him in the Malfoy robes, so he was the first babe in many centuries from both families to have his own set,” she says, with a small chuckle. The usual whenever Lucius gets mentioned in my presence. A forced lightness, a fake need to mention Lucius like he’s no one, really.
It’s early, Draco feels like he’s had enough sleep for once and his boyfriend is on top of him snogging the living daylights out of him first thing in the day. So it’s not really his fault that all blood rushes South quite dramatically.
It was learning how to be numb, how to not feel, how to keep everyone out of his mind and away from his thoughts, it was the paralysing terror of crawling around in the shadows, the bone-deep dread of dropping leftover bread rolls on the floor by the bars on the dungeon and kicking them swiftly into the other side, where they kept his classmates. It was sneaking a blanket or two down and saying to himself, “If they find out…”
All while he rubs himself against Potter, shamelessly. All while he lets Potter ravage him, touch him all over, kiss his mouth, his ears, his neck.
“— it’s just, it’s all been so busy, and time goes by so quickly with the babes, and I didn’t realise the Solstice is on Monday, but I was wondering if you have given the Saining any thought?”
isn’t one I’d say I possess. But right in the moment, I suddenly become much more my mother than my father.
The woman is standing there alone, in silence, her hands shoved deep into the pockets of her coat. For a second, Draco thinks she must just be a fan. He knows Harry’s grave is always covered in flowers and gifts his admirers leave for him, even in death. She’s too tall to be Hermione, not ginger enough to be Ginny. She wears a cream coloured coat and her deep brown hair cascades down her back in soft curls. Soft curls that — Draco realises — he once held between his fingers, almost two decades ago.
It strikes Draco so intensely, every single time, that Draco always follows suit within seconds, no matter what. Harry comes panting, his mouth open wide, eyes shutting tight. He comes with a low, long cry and with long stripes of come painting his own chest or Draco’s or their fists.
Potter bites his lip, a row of white straight teeth sinking under his bottom lip with such force Draco leans forward and runs his fingers over Potter’s mouth until he relaxes his mouth again.
“Christ, you’re burning, Draco,” Potter says, a gentle hand pushing his damp hair off his face before relief comes in the form of a wet flannel and Draco laughs and laughs and laughs until he’s sick. Luna Lovegood is a Healer these days. She comes by and looks at Draco with a sad but kind smile. He hears her telling Potter he’s doing “really well,” and isn’t sure if she means Potter or himself, but he doesn’t think he’s doing well at all because he keeps repeating the Apparition coordinates to Daryl’s place because Daryl is the one who would always give Draco the good stuff at the club, and would never ask for anything in return.
“You want this so bad. You want me, don’t you? You keep coming back. You can’t help it, and time and time again, you end up in my bed.”
Draco wants to speak. He wants to say “I am dying, I don’t want to die without telling you,” but he has no strength. His thoughts are going faster than the newest Firebolt as he hears Harry tell whoever else is in the room (Ron?) to leave. He wonders if this is it. This what they show you in the films: your life flashing before your eyes right before you die.
Draco makes a show of it. Unlacing his brown brogues, taking his belt of, pulling his shirt up and unbuttoning every single button slowly. When he’s down to his underwear, Potter is panting in front of him.
dead. The voice never sounds like this in his dreams, though: disembodied, frantic, quick. Draco catches half words, half sentences, half conversations that don’t make sense. A different voice is saying “just do it” and “you’re powerful enough” and “sod protocol” and “I am his partner, I brought him here.” The voice from his dreams responds with things like “unstable” and “I don’t know” and “can you please try” and a “I can’t get in touch with her” and “not without consent forms” and a louder, angry “he’s not going to d—“
Harry decides not to tell Draco yet about the destruction of the land in Yorkshire, even if he knows Draco will be pleased his father’s possessions are gone.
Draco lets his hands explore, going straight for Potter’s peachy bum, pulling him closer into himself. Draco is on the verge of coming already, the friction of denim against denim and his trapped cock against the heat of Potter’s turning out to be too much.
We unhook the net, sharing a look between us, preparing for the worst. The thing doesn’t seem dangerous. Not like a shark, or a whale, but I can’t be sure until I see it properly. The net falls open and I can’t help but gasp when the beautiful bright-eyed siren tumbles out among the fish.
Without prompting, she starts, “I see. He hasn’t actually explained anything to you, has he? That wicked boy.”
“Don’t try to open your eyes, don’t try to talk, don’t try to move, okay? We have stopped the bleeding for now, but we’re still trying to reverse the curse.”
When I think of the lighthouse, I am reminded of how lucky I am to have been born a Malfoy, that my father is in the good graces of Mr. Riddle, for better or for worse. Rumour is the lone soul that tends to the lighthouse is a Gryffindor turncoat who betrayed his loved ones to try and deliver The Boy Who Lived to Mr. Riddle. Peter, his name is. No one ever sees him, but the fire in the lighthouse is always there to bring us back home.
about magic, I don’t think. I imagine Gryffindor is largely abandoned now, although the history books describe it as a magnificent part of our country, covered in beautiful architecture and enormous trees heavy with fruit.
“More or less,” he says with a shrug, climbing onto the bed and over Draco for a kiss that Draco never allows him to deepen enough to satisfy him. “No dead bodies, no Obliviation required, this time,” he says against Draco’s lips.
“Sorry, Malfoy,” he says. And then, still only a few inches away from Draco, “I thought you said you were tired after training. Didn’t think you’d be out.”
Tonight Harry speaks to the sea air, the salty wind. And he tells Draco about patterns of self-destruction and something his Muggle therapist calls PTSD. He talks about being worthy of being desired and experiencing joy. And that not everything that brings pleasure is inherently bad.
It’s as much of a blur as our own wedding. I’m starting to realise I’m just not good at big emotions, at these big moments in life. Maybe because they make me think of what could have been, of what has been lost, of those who never had a chance to be here for all of it. I wonder if I could have had this with Teddy. Teddy, who’s now taller than me.
Narcissa comes through the Floo halfway through Saturday, carrying the most gigantic wicker basket I have ever seen. It looks older than life itself, like it’s about to disintegrate.
He’s hard as a rock, but if he wants to make this last, make it good for Potter, he’ll have to wait. He uses both hands to help Potter out of his trousers, and sighs at how much he wants to dive straight in and suck him off until he’s crying. He won’t though. Not yet.
Draco has done it before, he has. With people he probably trusted less, people who definitely shouldn’t have trusted him.
They’ve done this before, of course, that one time at the club. Draco hasn’t forgotten. Draco wishes he had, but it’s all he thinks about when he wanks. All he thinks about when he closes his eyes, really. But that was a year ago. And they’d never discussed it after that night. Just because it happened before it doesn’t mean it’s something they do.
Unsurprisingly, sprawled on the middle of the enormous bed in the main bedroom is how he finds his husband, white shirt undone all the way to his bellybutton, tight grey trousers still on, gorgeous, slender bare feet hanging off the edge of the bed.
Draco doesn’t know what Potter’s game is at this point, not that he’s complaining. But if Potter wants Draco to break him, he will.
I don’t know if it’s the lack of sleep or this whole ceremony thing appearing out of nowhere and into my life, but I suddenly feel the familiar prickle of tears behind my eyes.
Seeing the shake of Mavis’ hand makes Ron move quicker and as soon as he reads the note, he’s barking orders to anyone in the close vicinity of his office. “Stevens, get me the head of DMLE, ASAP. Tell them I said it’s urgent.” “Richardson, I need you and a whole squad from the Investigation Department.” “Mavis, before you say anything to anyone, for Merlin’s sake, find me Harry.”
With a few quick moves of my hand, both Crabbe and Goyle are asleep. I search the very back of my brain for the right words, hoping I get them right. I whisper “Obliviate” twice and any memory of the oddly heavy net and of the merman currently staring at me is gone from both my friends’ minds. I turn to face the siren, then.
“I don’t need you to tell me how to be a Slytherin thank you very much.” He snapped, and Harry could tell that he was about to explode. Just like everyone else, Harry did not want to be in that scenario.
But all these thoughts were blown away when a disarming spell was shot his way. Out of instinct, he raised his wand and cast a shielding charm. He backed away a few steps and waved his wand, a stinging hex.
He watched as Draco made his way to the other side, a sign that he’ll never be free from his wrong choices. The despair on his face made it so unbearable for Harry, as he knows that it was not the right time He watched as all his friends mourned his death, he’d never forget the hopeless look on Hagrid’s face as he carried Harry into the Hogwarts grounds. And Neville, oh Neville. No one was as brave as that boy, standing up to Voldemort, pulling the sword of Gryffindor and letting it shine as the last hope for all goodness.
“What!” He snapped, trying to draw Potter’s attention from his pants. But Potter’s smirk just grew wider.
Two seconds after the magic had drained out of him Harry immediately regretted what he’d just done. What had he just done????
Since Draco’s table was facing the door, he could see everyone that walks in. And maybe it was just a coincidence, but he swore he just saw Potter enter the bar.
He looked around the place as he arrives, nothing too special about the place, except for the fact that it’s a bit cramped, because of all the brooms in there. Draco wasn’t sure if he should wait inside, in case of traps, but he quickly changed his mind as the nightly wind blew past him, sending shivers down his spine.
Startled, Draco turned around so abruptly that he tripped over a broom that was lying uncivilly on the ground, falling right into Potter’s awaiting arms.
“I’m sorry Potter, but your existence, in general, is a rotten smell in the air that’d never fade.” Draco taunts back, although he meant the exact opposite in his heart.
By the time Professor McGonagall came back, Potter had already cleaned the whole classroom by himself and they were waiting by one of the tables.
Harry’s heart sped up at the thought of having to face the git in battle. Would he be able to point his wand at him again? As an enemy?
Draco couldn’t help but groan at the scent of his so-called arch-nemesis. After the kiss, he was always longing for Potter, and that did not make his attempt to cut things off with Potter any easier.
Now, when Professor Snape tends to get mad, it’s best to stay away, but from the years Draco has spent with him, he knows that his dear godfather isn’t actually mad, it’s just doing this for reputation. That just pissed him off so much more, knowing that this was all planned.
Everything relaxed inside Harry’s head. He finally said it. It’s been nagging at the back of his mind for ages now, but now that’s he’s finally said it, it seems more realistic than just a thought in his head.
He had learnt to glue on his Malfoy mask at a very young age, he was told to never take it off, unless in front of the Dark Lord, but Potter was an exception. He’s risked breaking himself once and for all by somewhat agreeing to date the chosen one. But if Potter really was playing with him…
Harry didn’t expect anyone to not notice their argument. But merlin curses him—out of everybody of Hogwarts, it had to be bloody Malfoy who heard their insults. Especially when it was directed towards him, plus, Harry can’t even say if their relationship is just a snip of emotions. And now he’s ruined all chances with him.
“Voldemort was responsible for that, I think.” Harry let the name slip before he even recognised the fact that Lucius was a death eater.
Harry didn’t know if it were him who could see through Malfoy’s acts, or Malfoy is just a horrible actor, but he knew what Malfoy was thinking. Or maybe it was his thought too.
But the strange emptiness reminded him that it was only those few hours, and Draco must have left rather early.
Harry carefully untied the parchment from the owl’s leg, as watched for a moment as it again flew out of the window into the air, before focusing back on the actual letter.
“I-I do hate him,” Harry said smoothly, Hermione narrowed her eyes, “But Hermione why are you standing up for him?”
It would be nice to think that Potter was worried about him, but Draco knew when to get his hopes high, and when to let go. Right now, is obviously the latter.
“It was just a simply duel! How could you two turn it into an invention of a new spell that no one knows how to counter? Heavens above, you two will be serving detention for the next month! Also, since Mr Potter is also at fault, I suggest you two go wait in the abandoned classroom that we will lead you to and clean up everything without wands since the binding charm on Mr Malfoy is very likely to wear off in the next hour.” The old hag had said.
Unfortunately for Draco, they just happen to bump into The Golden Trio halfway through the corridor.
“Malfoy…loves me…huh…” Harry muttered, trying to get the piece of information through his thick head.
“So, what happened, I assume whatever it happened last night as you were out at the bar.” She stated, her brown eyes staring right through Harry.
“Then take back what you just said, Potter.” Harry knew that the sentence was weak and held no power within, it was almost as if Malfoy didn’t want him to take it back.
Since it was still class time, no one disturbed his pity sleep. It wasn’t until after dinner when everyone came back to the common room did the two other Slytherins of the silver trio notice that Draco was back.
They taste like apples and cream, probably his shaving cream, but it was exactly what he’d dream of. Lost in his thoughts, Harry was pulled back by the squirming of the body under his hand.
He imagined many scenarios where he’d made up to Malfoy and they had some heart to heart time. However, there were also some depressing scenarios that showed how Malfoy would never talk to him again.
“What do you think you’re doing, Potter!” He half-whispered, half-yelled. He’s probably too flustered to think properly, that thought left a satisfying smirk on his face. However, that just seemed to anger Malfoy even more.
He sighed. Slowly stretching and rising to a sitting position, making sure that the silencing charm is still effective, he began retelling the events of this afternoon.
Maybe in that sense, he was kind of similar to Harry Potter. He was the boy who lived, destined to save the world. Ever since infancy, he was weighed down on the responsibility to defeat the evilest wizard of the century, only because his mother had sacrificed herself for him.
Harry wasn’t the type to give up, but given the current circumstances, and the war still going on, Malfoy, whose father was still in Azkaban? He wasn’t so sure anymore.
He was the enemy of the love of his life. Or maybe he always was, just that these two week’s interactions had given a sparkle of hope—that surely wouldn’t last long.
Potter went silent after Draco’s explanation, he looks as if he was concerned for Draco’s health, which Draco doubted.
There probably will be a sequel to this, hope you've enjoyed the story so far. I know it's a bad habit to leave cliff hangers, but I just couldn't help myself ;)
Harry sighed, it sounded easy enough in his head, but actually trying to get Draco Malfoy to sit down and talk civilly over a cup of tea was like trying to get an Outstanding in potions with Snape around.
Now? There’s nothing left for him to break. Potter broke his heart, so Draco will break their chances of winning the war.
Harry wasn’t in a good mood as breakfast went by in a rush, as he didn’t see a certain Slytherin at the green table full of snickering kids.
The heat engulfed him whole, it lit all his senses up. Potter slowly traced his bottom lip with his tongue, asking for access. It was his second kiss damn it, of course, Draco wasn’t prepared for the French kissing! Thinking about it, Potter probably had a lot of practice from the Chang girl and Weaslette. It only made him more frustrated, and he sealed his lip, ignoring the wet licks on his lips.
Spells and hexes were flying everywhere, the sinks broke, the toilets exploded, mirrors shattered. Harry let his magic take over, returning all the jinxes in a matter of seconds. Mist clouded his mind; he couldn’t reply to his brain anymore. Harry didn’t know who he was fighting, of why he was shouting spells, but the only emotion that he felt was rage and frustration.
So, Draco just sat there, watching as Potter swung the broom back and forth on the floor, layers of dust flying around, causing Draco to cough, from one end to another. He noticed how Potter’s arm automatically holds the broom in flying stance, how when he sneezes his whole body goes rigid.
“Was it one of the Patail twins? Was it the Brown girl? Was it Granger?” Ron snorted, “Was it...Weasley?” Everyone shouted ‘Ewww’. But Nott won’t give up, “Was it Potter?”
“Huh? I didn’t do anything?” Seeing Potter was just as puzzled as he was, Draco’s rage all leaked out, as he slumped onto the floor.
“Harry, are you sure?” Hermione asked again, with a glint of unsure in her eyes, she acted clam, but Harry knew that she was just surprised as Ron was.
Frankly, it wasn’t Potter who had cast the spell, Draco didn’t know who, but he just knew that it comes from the audience, presumably one of his Slytherin friends.
“Just tell me what last night was all about, and I’ll leave you alone!” Harry couldn’t stand this any longer as he shouted.
Harry almost blushed at the cute pout, but the smell of alcohol stopped it. “I-I’m not Potter, whoever that is, my name is Harold.” Harry quickly corrected; he didn’t want anyone to know just yet. It was fine being someone other than the famous Harry Potter sometimes.
“Harry! Big news!” She grinned, “Tonight I managed to get Professor McGonagall’s permission to host an inter-house party in the Room of Requirement! Most people from all the houses are coming, I already have the food and drinks planned, I only need you guys to help with the decorations.” She took a deep breath.
Two different thoughts were thrashing around in his head, he didn’t even notice his hand reaching out for the cup seated in front of him.
“It's us Potter, Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, it’d never work out!” Draco gave a frustrated stomp.
Harry had drunk once because he’d been in the prefect’s bathroom before. But other than that, everything was going smoothly. But he had to admit, the Slytherins were being a little too cooperative tonight.
Finally, Malfoy glared at Hermione, who was next to Harry, but completely ignored Harry as he went on to glare at Ron. Understandable, Harry thought, if he was in Malfoy’s place, he would’ve barged out of the bloody room already.
“You’ve been avoiding me lately.” A voice drove him back to full alert, and only did he relax again when he realised it was Potter who had asked the question.
The silver trio was walking to the Great hall for the breakfast Draco had been dreading since he woke up this morning, replayed the scene from last night in his head, told Pansy, who told Blaise and was dragged out of the dormitories to breakfast.
Potter just stared him puzzled. Sometimes he just wants to slap this idiot, how can someone be so dense?
“Well, I’m sure you don’t want to sit like that for the next hour before you could do it yourself right?” A tingling sensation sparkled through his spine.
Harry was stunned, the first bit of the sentence seemed reasonable since he never ironed his clothes or gave the effort to tame his wild hair, but what was up with that last part? A taste of his lips? And it’s coming from Malfoy? THE Draco Malfoy of all people? Harry feels as though someone had just turned the world upside down, and Voldemort no longer exists.
Draco huffed and shuffled in his uncomfortable position. What he forgot was that he still had a rage on. How would someone forget that they’re hard? Draco has no idea, or maybe he’s just weird. Probably the latter.
“Exactly! And do you know what that means?” Ron grinned like a twelve-year-old girl, “What?” Harry tried to act innocent, while Hermione gave him a look.
He watched as the unforgivable curse was cast, ‘Avada Kedavra’, Dumbledore’s spineless body falling through the air and out of his life. He watched, replayed the scene too many times to count, nothing he could do. Even though he knew that Dumbledore had raised him up to die, he was still a fatherly figure in Harry’s heart.
Back to topic, Potter would never love him. He was a Slytherin, a Malfoy, who were the enemies of the Weasley family for who knows how long. He had bullied them and made fun of Potter and his friends for years, even if he was only trying to get his attention. Potter would never forgive him. They had no chance together; the world would only break them apart.
His calloused hands had somehow found their way to Malfoy’s waist while still kissing him lightly. He subconsciously squeezed his hand a little, and Malfoy squeaked, like literally squeaked.
Gosh, I’m falling for him! Draco shook his head, I can’t do that, father and mother would never approve, besides, he wouldn’t ever love a death eater scum like me…
Draco sneered his best sneer while his face still being beet red, and plopped himself back on the table.
“Mate, I know you hate Malfoy, just tell Hermione how wrong she is! That prick will always be a pain in the ass!”
They were both concentrated on each other, determined not to let the other win, Draco flung another spell at Potter, and used the few seconds of advantage to catch a glimpse at the clock. From Draco’s speedy calculations, he figured that they’ve been at each other’s throats for nearly an hour now, no wonder why Draco was running out of hexes even though he had a whole gallery of them in his brain.
“Tell us what happened mate, you know that we won’t judge.” The ginger said gently. But that was the problem, Harry knew that Hermione had a chance of understanding the situation he and Malfoy had both been in during the war, but Ron wouldn’t think about that. Draco Malfoy had bullied the Weasley’s family for as long as they remember, criticising them for being ‘Mudblood Lovers’. He doesn’t think Ron would accept this calmly, instead, what Harry is afraid of is that his best mate since he knew about the wizarding world would use that piece of information against Malfoy and end up badly. The worst thing is Harry doesn’t want to see Malfoy sad or miserable.
Draco tried to think about other things to cover his obvious boner, but it doesn’t seem to be working. Whatever that spell was, it had something to do with Aphrodisiac because the heat surrounding Draco just wouldn’t go away, and the ropes aren’t helping either.
Weird animal noises that Draco did not want to know what creature they came from were the only things that could be heard through the cold silence. He regretted coming as soon as he set foot on the grounds. The broom shed is annoyingly near the forbidden forest, and trust him, Draco did not have many good memories there after first year.
No words could describe how much Harry’s heart ached at that moment. How he longed to wrap the crying boy into his arms and comfort him with a gentle kiss on the head. Although he knew that the stubborn blonde would never let him make him feel so vulnerable.
The windows in the room that Harry didn’t even notice shattered and the slim figure of Draco Malfoy flew back and hit the wall with a pained “Oof!”
“Woah, careful there!” Potter hushed as he grabbed hold of Draco’s upper arm, with Draco’s face buried in his shirt.
Blinding pain hit him, his skin felt like it was burning off his flesh, something along the lines of a creature ripping his flesh out. His senses were gone for some time, the pain seemed to last forever, but quickly disappeared when he felt something else on his skin.
“Are you crazy? Don’t you remember? Potter hates me, to the guts!” Draco shouted, ears turning red, “Besides, by now the whole school probably knows that the Great Draco Malfoy is gay, and for bloody Harry Potter, the boy who lived!” He ranted.
Her quick strides make her seem pissed, but when no one could see her expression, she let out a small smile.
Harry could see Malfoy’s hesitation at this point, the pain of being thrown into a wall clearly didn’t help much in keeping his Malfoy mask up, because harry could hear the gears in his head-turning. There were a few minutes of utter silence, and Harry could see Malfoy’s shoulders tense up, meaning he’s come to a decision.
He expected the same warmth to hold him, but the sharp stab of cold tiles against skin snapped him out of his sleepy trance.
It’s the first, and last time he’d be doing this, but this could be his chance, to have a taste of freedom just before he has to crawl back into his cage.
Draco gritted his teeth, “It wasn’t a simple binding spell Potter, a normal binding spell doesn’t make your legs weak and gives you a full-on boner.” As soon as they were out, Draco wished he could swallow them back.
They were broad and fit, muscles ripping through the fabric. Draco always played quidditch but had never gotten such fit before.
Everything was fine at first, everyone was happy and even the Slytherins were enjoying themselves and not hexing everyone’s balls off. But it all started when Pansy Parkinson announced that they were going to play ‘Never have I ever”.
“Flying isn’t the only thing a broom can do, Malfoy. Unless you want to sweep the floor with your expensive robes, I suggest you shut up.” Potter said, with his back still towards Draco.
“Pansy Parkinson, she’s one brilliant schemer.” Hermione chuckled, “In fact, I’m not afraid to tell you, that night when you and Malfoy were in the broom shed? Yeah, we set that up.”
Also, the reason I decided to made a sequel for this is because the sequel will be about one year after the war, which is a whole other story, that's why I think it shouldn't be in 'The Drunk Accident'.
“Then…what...?” Harry asked, even more, confused than before. He knows that even he went and asked Parkinson and Zabini, they wouldn’t tell him shit.
Before Harry could figure out their grand plan, a black swirl of fabric blocked his view and Professor Severus Snape was at the front of the classroom. Soon after Professor Snape came in, the rest of the year 6 Gryffindors and Slytherins joined them.
“My types…Malfoy said he preferred blokes my type.” The golden boy sighed, as soon as he said that a flood of relief washed over him, he finally got it out of his chest.
Draco didn’t care, it seemed like when Potter was with him, everything would fade, into a world only with the two of them.
Deep down he knew that Harry was lying, but he couldn’t let this moment go. It was too precious for him.
He watched himself leap out of Hagrid’s arms, the expression on his face like someone’s torch relit itself in a haunted house, an ‘Incendio’ out of his mouth, aiming at the snake. The shock and happiness on Draco’s face when he saw Harry alive and kicking.
The silence wasn’t awkward, even a bit peaceful if you ask Draco. Of course, as peaceful as two rivals since eleven can get.
Pansy turned to Blaise and smirked, Blaise returned it. They’d be finally getting rid of the daily basis rambling.
Who would barge into a small apartment? Unless the rumours about a nearby thief were true and he just happened to be so unlucky?
Everything seemed to be in slow motion, Draco slowly pulled out his wand and yelled a spell. Out of sheer instinct, Harry dodged it as it hit the wall behind him.
“Shhhh” Madam Prince hushed them as Harry, Hermione and Ron walked into the library. He was devastated, what could he tell his best friends. That Malfoy loved him for more than four years and accidentally confessed to him?
“People can change!” He heard Granger yell. He poked his head out a tiny bit. Potter’s back was to him, Granger was too busy staring at Weasley to notice and the Weasel was just yelling his arse out.
“Looks like you need to lend Weasel here your glasses Potter.” Draco sneered back. Blaise and Pansy both rolled their eyes, here he goes. The truth was, Draco did not hate Potter, in fact, he felt to complete opposite. You see, Draco here had been pinning over that Golden boy for like, who knows how long.
“Yeah.” It wasn’t a lie though; he just didn’t know all. Of course, he wanted to know what Malfoy had meant the night before, but the person himself doesn’t seem to want to admit Harry’s existence.
Harry doesn’t know if Malfoy thought about what he said last night or not, but he knows as a matter of fact that the blond boy has not yet accepted Harry into his life. As a friendly way.
“Tell her Harry, tell her how Malfoy is a disgusting worm.” Weasley seethed. To Draco he looked like a complete idiot that doesn’t know where his own brain lies.
Harry looked despairingly at Ron, hoping that his best friend would help him out. Ron gave Harry an odd look but still changed the subject.
He heard Potter growl from his throat, the sound sent shivers down his spine, and Potter began nibbling on his lip. Draco couldn’t help but let out a little whimper at the action, but still refused to open.
The apartment was nothing compared to the Manor, but despite it’s broken looks on the outside, Draco had managed to keep everything nice and tidy on the inside, so that it actually looks like a home instead of a rubbish dump like it was when Draco first rented the place.
Blaise had already seen enough and knows that tonight would be a long night indeed, so he keeps on walking, under the raised eyebrow of a very suspicious Hermione.
Pansy and Blaise shared a look, they were going to make the Gryffindors pay, no matter what. Even if it means going behind Draco’s back.
But as soon as Draco’s hand touched the door, a spark of electricity shocked him, and he quickly sprang back.
“Your cute reaction, like how you squirmed under my grasp, and how you have a sensitive waist.” He teased. Harry’s intention, which was to make Malfoy as flustered as possible, was achieved quite easily to say.
Harry didn’t know what to do, he wanted to help, but what if he hurt Draco again? So, he could only stand there and stare like an idiot as Professor Snape strides out of the room, leaving him with a last glance, saying something like: You’ve done enough.
Draco raised his head and saw that idiot staring right at his pants, and quickly reddened. He thought Potter had already forgotten it, guess he was wrong, again.
“That Malfoy has kissed a Gryffindor before! This is brilliant blackmail material, guys!” He yelped.
“Haha…yeah…They probably hate him for even touching them already…” Harry felt his heart clench as those words flooded out of his mouth.
But Hermione ignored him, instead, she kept glaring at Harry, maybe because he hadn’t finished his transfiguration essay and it was due today?
“You two should be ashamed of yourselves! You shouldn’t be saying things like that behind anyone’s back. Harry you of all people should understand that!” She huffed, and Harry really felt the anger behind those words.
Harry was not surprised this year when Professor Snape, probably his second least favourite teacher—Umbridge comes first of course—became the DADA teacher. There are rumours all around Hogwarts saying that the place is cursed, which lead to not many teachers willing to take the spot. Professor Snape had always applied for the DADA spot, that is probably why he’s the DADA teacher for 7th years.
They stared at each other, Draco contemplated the idea of starting another conversation, but quickly dismissed it as Potter turned to the brooming cupboard on his left and took out a broom.
After a while, the dreams and hallucinations have gone barbaric, but in the end, they were still dreams, dreams that could never come true.
He’s currently sitting in the ruins of the Great Hall; it didn’t seem so great to him at the moment.
Draco on one hand just wants to keep this to himself, only to avoid being embarrassed horribly, but on the other hand he really wanted to rant about Harry freaking Potter right now, and the perfect person for that is right in front of him.
“So, who is this Potter?” Harry asked, curious of why Malfoy would be thinking of him, other than how to hex him to vomit slugs for eternity.
“Oh…you really think so? Why? I heard that you hated him, weren’t you two some sort of… arch-nemesis?” Harry asked carefully.
“Malfoy, we both know that you fancy me, so can we please stop this nonsense? I already told you that I was just insecure about us, that’s why I agreed with Ron.” He rasped; Potter seemed twenty years older in the dim moonlight.
Harry’s desperate, he doesn’t want to lose any of his friends. Or Malfoy. But what can he do? He likes Malfoy, Hermione might get over it one day, but Ron? It’d be a luxury to ask of him not to hex Malfoy’s bollocks off.
So that’s why they’re along in the classroom along with the three royals from Slytherin, including his new boyfriend, Draco Malfoy.
And he was just a lowly death eater, running from his crimes and decisions. Draco would never be worthy of the Great Harry Potter, not that Potter would remember him anyways, Draco thought bitterly.
Draco turned around and shifted under the blazing gaze of none other than Harry Potter. The heat radiating off it is kind of disturbing, as he’s never had much skin on skin contact with anyone. Not even his parents.
He carefully opened the window, as the owl was not familiar and looked pretty fierce. It’s eyes pierced into Harry’s, it sent shivers down his spine. But then the contact broke as the owl flew in casually, landing on the perch made of sticks next to Harry’s trunk. And from those two seconds of eye contact Harry knew that whoever’s owl this was, they must have trained it well.
But he did make their lives at Hogwarts miserable for years, he does have a reason to hate him. Draco had to admit, he was a git.
“I-uh don't think that’s any of our business, I also don’t think it’s right to go public with this Ron,” Harry said, staring right back him.
Normally Draco would analysis the scene and their facial expressions, but this time he was too emotional to think properly, let alone understanding why Potter had said that.
Draco felt tears gathering at the rim of his eyes, no one’s ever told him this. Not even his own mother.
Since Draco wouldn’t shut up about Harry Potter since third year, they already knew the Golden Trio’s time table by heart, they also knew that Potter, Granger and Weasley will be either heading towards the Great Hall or already at the Great Hall by the time they get there.
“What do you want from me?” Malfoy glared directly into Harry’s eyes; unwavering heat rushed over both boys.
“We don’t have to take two three month old babies to bloody Stonehenge at four in the morning, do we?”
“Hello, Potter.” And then, because curiosity killed the cat but satisfaction brought it back, he asks, “What’s in your bag?”
And I say nothing because my stomach flips at the way he says my name. I say nothing, even though I mean to say
It’s not a conscious decision, but Draco knows as Harry’s back arches off the bed that he needs Potter to fuck him. Tonight.
He finds a Boggart inside a drawer in Blaise’s bedroom. No one can get rid of it, and while the Zabinis aren’t exactly regarded as the scum of the earth — not like the Malfoys are, anyway — Blaise can’t get a Curse-Breaker in no matter how hard he tries. Draco looks his fear in the eye and realises just how deep it is as the Boggart struggles to keep to one form. Draco’s terror is so deep and so heavy that even the creature can’t pinpoint exactly what it is. Draco’s fear wears many faces:  his own parents, the Dark Lord, Greyback, aunt Bellatrix. Sometimes it takes the faces of the dead. Vince. Greg. Sometimes it takes the face of the victorious. Potter. Sometimes it takes the face of the innocent. That first-year he’d Crucioed under Amycus’ watchful eye. More often than not, when Draco looks at the Boggart, he stares at his own face and weeps. After, a tall man with dark hair and beautiful eyes pushes him against the bathroom door at someone’s house (he can’t remember whose or how he got there) and smiles the most dangerous looking smile as he holds up a little baggie full of white powder. Draco finds relief like this, for a few hours.
“Too much?” Draco asks, and strokes his hand over Potter’s thigh in one of the gentlest touches they have ever shared.
A sudden, weird feeling numbs his mouth and he opens one eye in time to see Harry put his wand away.
, but the wind makes itself felt, blowing the wisps of hair that have managed to escape from under my hat in my face.
To anyone outside the small bubble of anger that is Harry Potter, the pure, dripping anxiety of Ron Weasley’s rapidly diminishing patience, and Mavis’ worried elevated heartbeat, it happens almost in slow motion.
It’s definitely the sudden realisation that an infant Sirius once wore the robes in front of me, that the very ritual we’re planning happened to him, in this very house, in the garden he left to me.
Potter moans at the threat, but lowers his hips back down and lets Draco resume his earlier job of slowly fucking himself on Potter’s cock.
He doesn’t know who moves first or why or exactly how, but he knows that Potter’s tongue tastes beer-bitter, his lips are as soft as they look and Potter is hard against him as Draco presses him further into a dark corner in hopes they won’t get disturbed.
I couldn’t say what it is, exactly. What his tells are. But I’m still yawning away the sleep in my eyes (of which there is much, because Scorpi is hungry all the time and Jamie is colic-y — or is it the other way round?) when I see him through my blinks and I know he’s in a mood.
“Pull harder,” Potter says, and fucking hell, if Potter isn’t a kinky fucker with his off-hand requests to get choked and get his hair pulled.
We’re barely all showered and suited up and semi-awake, when Blaise walks through the Floo, smiling way too much for the time of the day, carrying enormous branches of juniper with him.
Despite it all, Draco burns. And it does the job, for the most part. There’s something about it. The music drowns out the cries of grief that play in his brain on a constant loop, the whiskey (he’s no longer fussy; at first he hated anything that wasn’t Firewhiskey, but now even bourbon will do) loosens his body, the drugs clear out his mind. It’s easy to lose himself for a few hours in the attention and the hot touch of random men.
Draco’s only rule is no repeats. He knows himself. The way he loves patterns, spirals too easy to fall into, desire paths that have been travelled so heavily and so often they’ll never grow grass again, rabbit holes in which either
Potter isn’t nice to Draco at work. The scowling and sad smiles are long gone, though. He’s not nice, but he’s not…
So Draco does it again, something akin to prayer running in his head. A litany of worries, a rosary of inventory (“
Point being, here I am, a half-eaten bit of peach between my thumb and forefinger halfway to my mouth, looking at my own husband with an expression I reckon is as dumbfounded as the expression I had at eleven when I asked Hagrid, “I’m a
I know better than to lie. I have made my bed by betraying everything I was taught, by doing magic, by deciding to stand by him instead of the people I grew up knowing, trusting, loving.
There is only one person in the world I would wake in the middle of the night for. Only one person I’d attempt to squeeze two small babies into intricate robes before four in the morning for. And he’s currently giving me a face that says “if you’re not out of bed in thirty seconds, I’m gonna drag you out of there myself,” so I get out of bed and check on the babies: still asleep, because
The thing is, I, well, I don’t feel more or less happiness right now than I do when Jamie wraps his tiny little fingers around my thumb or when Scorpi giggles delightedly. This isn’t more important to me than when Draco comes home late from work and insists on using me as his personal human hot water bottle, or when he makes me a cup of tea that is just right, or when he says “Hey, Saviour, get out of your head” which really means “I know you’re overthinking. I love you.”
He finds a pile of letters at the bottom of his Hogwarts trunk he hasn’t touched for years, addressed to everyone he has hurt. An endless list of names, a bigger list of sins. He wishes he didn’t remember every single wrong thing he’s ever done. He can’t fault his brain though, that’s a lot of memories to retain. There’s nothing left of what once was his childhood bedroom after Draco is done with his letters. It’s often this way, when Draco picks at the little things, when he can’t control the fire from catching, from being carried by the wind to the dried wood of everything around him. In a blink of an eye, it’s all gone.
Despite it all – despite everything Riddle has done, all that has changed in Hogwarts – it seems that the Gryffindors are still well aware of what’s going on.
“Potter, what exactly do you want?” He asks, and trails his fingers up from the coarse hair around Potter’s cock, up his chest, and into Potter’s open mouth. Potter sucks on Draco’s fingers with a wild hunger, like they’re coated in honey. As if Draco himself is the Ambrosia the gods promised.
“I like everything you do to me,” Potter replies in that way that is so quintessentially him — both honest and disarming, all at the same time, and Draco’s pulse quickens.
And Draco likes that. He’s nice enough when he’s like this, straddling Draco in his bed, holding something behind his back that Draco can’t see. When he tells Draco, “I like that you don’t let me come sometimes. I like that you have control over that. And I come so hard when I fuck myself at home and I think of you.”
I do learn that we don’t even have to leave the house — tradition requires an open space big enough for a bonfire and where you can watch both sunset and sunrise from, the closest possible to the house where the children are to grow up. Luckily for us, that’s our garden at Grimmauld Place, which has apparently seen centuries of Black children’s Sain rituals.
Unexpectedly, her hand wraps around his gently. This is the first loving touch Draco has experienced from someone who is not his son in years.
I was on baby duty last night, which means I get a couple hours in the morning and Draco sorts breakfast. There isn’t one thing out of place, so it isn’t that. The bread is sliced and waiting for me to throw a toasting charm at it, and the coffee is brewed, perfuming the whole house. There’s freshly squeezed orange juice and slices of fruit on a little platter. The kind of shit they have in films — I refuse to believe this is how normal people have breakfast, even if it’s how my husband makes breakfast. How he has made us breakfast for the past four years now.
“I know,” says Astoria, and turns to face Draco. She’s older, he realises. She has little lines around her smile, crinkley marks around her eyes, a few grey hairs shine in the yellow light bathing everything. Draco had always thought those would look amazing on Harry. That Harry would grow handsome and happy, and Draco wouldn’t age as gracefully but just as happy. Things didn’t pan out quite as Draco had imagined.
And now Narcissa is showing me the two sets of robes, the ancient linen one with the embroidered black trim, and the cleaner looking one — satin and lace, Draco’s.
Mavis tries to smile, but it comes out all wrong, all teeth and panic. “Auror Weasley wants a word with you, actually,” she says. Behind her, the bullpen is noisier than ever. She doesn’t remember anything like this, ever, even during the war.
“I come to see Harry a lot,” she adds. Harry’s name in her mouth feels a bit like the space left behind a lost tooth and Draco wants her to say it again, wants to dip his tongue in that space not yet healed until the discomfort becomes real pain.
He keeps one hand in Potter’s back pocket and brings the other one up to Potter’s hair and is surprised at how soft it is, which just makes Draco want to touch it even more. His fingers find the back of Potter’s necklace as Draco plays with his hair, and he can’t help but pull a little, play with the small beads between his fingers, see what happens.
“I love you. You know that, right?” Harry says to the fire pit burning in their back garden one night. And Draco nods. Because Draco never says anything when Harry speaks to him without looking at him, but he listens.
But first, coffee and toast. Being faithful to your schedule is the most important part of life as a fisherman. Even if you’re a spy for the resistance.
before — more times than he probably should have— in the locker rooms at work. But never like this. Never this close. He mourns the lack of the small pearls around Potter’s neck and decides he’ll have to make do with what he has, letting his open palm travel over Potter’s abs and chest to finally settle low on his neck, squeezing gently. Potter gasps and a feeling of euphoria settles comfortably over Draco, just from the simple fact that he knows what Potter likes.
You learn to love the mornings, in my profession. Not that I ever had a chance to pick this profession, or even consider what else is there out in the world. But despite it being destiny and not choice, I appreciate the quietness of the world before dawn. There’s something about the routine that I enjoy. The dichotomy of having that routine on land when the rule out at sea is to always expect the unexpected.
Ron Weasley rises from the chair in his office at his full name being used, and runs out the door without his robes on, which isn’t really unusual. Ron isn’t one for uniform codes. It’s a miracle every button on his wine-red waistcoat is done up.
He looks up at Draco like he knows what he's thinking, like he wants Draco to be watching him, glasses still perched atop his nose, wonky and half fogged, choking on Draco’s dick.
Harry wraps his legs around Draco, and traps him into that shallow thrust that’s perfect for a morning fuck. Just Draco’s hand putting a little pressure at the base of Harry’s neck, on his collarbone, and Harry running his nails down Draco’s sides. Draco kissing Harry as he fucks into him again and again and Harry whispering against Draco’s lips “fuck, yes, God, yes, Draco, so good, so fucking big, I love it when you fuck me, oh God, oh God, oh God, right there.”
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake, Harry. The initiation rites! The blessing. You know, the ceremony where you get your godparents.”
Draco doesn’t know what a lightsabre is but, truth be told, he doesn’t know what Potter is on about half of the time.
She clears her throat at the threshold, nervous and most unlike herself, and all eyes are on her immediately. Harry flashes her a charming kind smile and says, “Mavis, my dear, is my husband using you as an errand boy now, getting you to fetch me? That’s too low, even for him, the lazy fucker.”
Draco has twelve years of catching Harry up on his life, on Scorpius and how he’s grown to be the smartest child Draco has ever met. But the wind stops and the yellow light
Draco watches me from above his cup of tea and takes one long sip. The baby in his arms wriggles a little and then settles again against Draco’s chest.
“What is a kidnapping if not a non-consensual holiday?” Draco says, dismissively. And then, “I know, love. You did good, though. You’re so good, Harry.”
“Fuck Potter, wait, I’m— shit, I’m gonna come,” he says, and Potter pulls back, sits prettily on his haunches and
He’s got Scorpi on his lap, all milk-drunk and sleepy-eyed, her sweeting little curls matching Draco’s perfectly. And Jamie is in the Moses basket on the floor, fast asleep — how I wish the precious bastard had been like that a mere five hours ago — looking like an angel.
“We don’t have to. I really want you to, though. I trust you. I want you to know I trust you. I have never—“
They’ve not spoken about it since the day Potter showed up at his, drunk and wanting his hair pulled and his face covered in Draco’s spunk.
And Potter lets Draco drag him to The Attic sometimes and their bodies fit together just as well on the dance floor as they do in bed (or in the shower, or the sofa, or the stairs, or the kitchen table), and all eyes are on them, because no one else touches Draco now, no one dares risk the thunderous look that crosses Potter’s face if they try to get Draco’s attention.
And Draco doesn’t know what happens, how it happens, when it happens, but his cardinal rule is forgotten. He keeps waking up in Potter’s bed, eating ripe fruit off Potter’s fingers, complaining about the shit instant coffee until one day there’s a tall cork-lidded-jar on Potter’s kitchen counter full of fragrant coffee beans.
Bright and crimson as hell itself, Harry’s blood. It’s only a little line, blood bubbling to the surface like lava in a volcano, but Harry moans when he looks down.
“They’ll never fire you, Golden Boy,” he says, as he grabs a knife from the kitchen counter and starts slicing the cake. “You don’t have to worry.”
It took them months of fucking for Draco to finally witness Harry coming, but Salazar was it worth it.
He thinks of Harry shaking his hand after his Auror graduation ceremony. “Well done, Malfoy,” he’d said. He thinks of that first time he’d been invited over to Ron and Hermione’s, a few weeks after he became Ron’s partner, and Harry had laughed at his stories, lips wine-red and plump, eyes kind like he’d never expected them. He thinks of every moment of
and sometimes that’s all it takes to convince me the lack of sleep and general tiredness is worth it, after all. That feeling doesn’t last long but it’s lovely nonetheless.
Their feet and hands are washed with the seawater, first by Draco and I, then by their respective godparents.
Potter enjoys rummaging through the little trunk at the bottom of Draco’s bed, full of toys, rope and leather. Draco lets him.
“Is this what you wanted, Potter? Is this what you came here for? You want me to keep you, I know. To use you whenever I want, isn’t that right? Your arsehole, your mouth, your prick. All mine. Like your orgasms. Mine. Mine to have, mine to control.”
Draco runs the dull side of the blade against Harry’s neck and he moans. He runs it down Harry’s shoulder, all the way down his arm. Draco knows how that feels. Just the knowledge that the blade is that close, is enough to have one’s skin break into goosebumps. The expectation, the thrill. The cold of the steel against the warmth of the skin.
Draco leans back against the pillows, and makes no effort to start undressing, which only makes Harry more desperate. “Let me guess, then. Mavis found my note, Ronald almost popped a vessel, you played protective husband with a thirst for blood, set up a false trail and came running to me.”
“Any issues?” Draco asks, eyes never leaving Harry’s hands, watching him shed his waistcoat, and his shirt, then his watch, his boots, trousers and socks.
And Draco would cry if he had the strength, he would say yes to all those plans and more, but he focuses on the feeling of Harry’s magic sinking into his body and he holds on, just like he was told to. He holds on, even if he doesn’t know exactly to what. And he thinks maybe he’ll get lucky again, and he’ll stop picturing himself dead like he’s been doing his whole life. Harry’s magic feels like love, like poetry, like cascading words of affection whispered into the space between his ribs, it feels like hope. And Draco holds on and thinks to himself, as loud as a thought can go, “I am
By Draco’s box, Harry means the trunk upstairs with all the sex toys and other paraphernalia. There isn’t a lot that Draco doesn’t have in that trunk and that piques his curiosity.
Neither come that night, although Harry is in near ecstasy when Draco cuts a small shallow line across his chest.
“Make me feel good, Malfoy,” Potter says, and kisses him. Draco lets him. “Please, Malfoy,” he says again when they break apart. “Like you did that night.”
Harry never speaks to him directly about the important things. The serious conversations, Harry has them with the wind. He’d said it once, that he’d forgiven Draco. That time, he’d been talking to the breeze in his back garden, the one that tickled the hair on the back of Draco’s neck. He’d asked Draco about moving in, a long while ago. That time, his words had been directed at the beam of light shining straight through the bathroom window and creating rainbows on the bubbles on the water between them.
Not long after Potter is begging, little hiccoughs falling from his reddened wet lips. Draco rolls his hips back and forth, relishing in that feeling of fullness and just how hard Potter is inside him.
The blues turn into pinks turn into oranges turn into yellows and then, when the wind blows a little hard, I don’t feel the need to pull my flannel shirt closer around my neck anymore. The sun feels good, and I’m already dreaming of the nap I’ll have when it’s high in the sky shining through my bedroom window and warming my bed just the right way. It’s early spring, which has my favourite sunrises. Cold, but not too cold. Soon enough the sun will be harsh and bright all day long and I’ll be looking at a tanned, freckled face and impossibly blonde hair in the mirror, every morning. I can’t deny I look forward to the days I can leave my hat at home.
I have with Pansy. But Blaise is a, well, for lack of a better term, a less intense type of Pureblood. He understands how lost I am most of the time. He’ll mock me for it, relentlessly. But he gets it.
Draco does go all soft and apologetic. He doesn’t have to (again, it’s not my fault I don’t know shit, but it’s definitely not his either — in fact, he’s the reason I know as much as I do). I appreciate it nonetheless. I round the table to put the empty plates and mugs in the sink and stop to kiss the top of his head.
Draco is aflame. The war is over and fate has decided he’s allowed to live. Live to tell the story and, most importantly, live to roam free as if he’s deserving of it. Redemption is worthless and overrated. Forgiveness is the word of the day, of the month, of the year. He hears it so much and so often his ears bleed. Draco discovers quickly that other people’s forgiveness doesn’t mean that much when he can’t forgive himself.
Potter isn’t sober, but Potter is begging. And that weighs greatly in Draco’s decision making abilities right that second.
Draco must be reading my mind when I approach him by the fire, because the back of his hand brushes mine reassuringly. “I feel a bit odd that Pansy isn’t here,” he says. I smile.
Potter has the audacity to look sheepish. He runs his hand through his mess of a mane and Draco wants nothing but to lick him, right there on all that exposed skin, navel to jaw.
Gryffindor… well, I don’t know about Gryffindor, really. Gryffindor used to deal with magic. But that was until Riddle came to rule all of Hogwarts. Before the whole thing with the Boy Who Lived happened. We’re not supposed to talk about magic. Not supposed to even
In Hogwarts, everything comes down to the plate fate served you when you were born. I was born in Slytherin, to Slytherin parents and Slytherin grandparents and actually a really long list of Slytherins from all sides of the family. There’s my mother’s cousin, of course, who decided this life wasn’t for him. Every family has a
Harry reaches a hand out and touches Draco’s chest. Draco is wearing a long sleeved jumper but he recognises the pattern as Harry traces it. Collarbone to nipple. Top rib to belly button. Navel to hip.
The Boy Who Lived hates his many titles, but in moments like these, it’s very hard to forget about the scar on his forehead. Harry doesn’t go back to his desk, doesn’t grab his robes. He doesn’t put his cup of tea down, the liquid sloshing about as he shouts, splashing on the floor. He is lightning striking down a tree, and before anyone can stop him, he snatches the small note out of Ron’s hand as Mavis gasps, and disappears into thin air, leaving his mug to smash across the checkered floor.
Potter tries to keep fucking into Draco, pants growing faster and lower and Draco says, “Don’t you dare come, Potter. Don’t you fucking dare. If you come I’m going to take this,” he holds up the sex toy from the bed, “and I’m going to use it on you until your brain is fried, until it smells like charred meat in this room.”
Once the ceremony is completed, we wait for the June sun to be up in the sky fully, and Scorpi falls asleep on Neville’s lap. Jamie won’t settle without Draco (a common occurrence), and I retreat into the house to make everyone a well deserved cup of tea.
Draco has to try very hard not to come in his pants, like last time. “Get on your knees,” he says, letting go of Potter and climbing off.
“Don’t worry,” I tell him. “You just caught me by surprise, is all. I didn’t even know it was a thing. Let’s do it.”
Draco doesn’t know what his face does then, but he knows what his dick does — going from 0 to 100 in no time whatsoever.
The gate creeks ominously — open, then closed — and Draco’s polished shoes echo in the silence of the cemetery, against the old stone of the stairs that lead to the corner where Harry is. Draco doesn’t know what to expect, but it’s definitely not the tall figure standing in front of the grave.
that looks so out of place, bright and stark against Potter’s skin and the dark shirt, that it’s… so
Why is Potter telling Draco this in the middle of the workday in the Ministry loos? And why does Draco like it so much?
I have been thinking of Sirius since Draco brought the Saining up. Since Draco said, “Well, you must have had one, too. I imagine yours would have been in Godric’s Hollow. You were born in July so you most likely had an Equinox Saining.”
Harry’s eyes never leave Draco’s hand as he cuts the cake. One slice, and then the other. Draco watches him back: eyes wide, surveying every movement of Draco’s hand.
And it certainly didn’t escape Draco’s notice that the last time they were made to duel, he’d ended up on the floor, with Potter’s hard prick pressed against his thigh.
He passed the joint to Seamus, who had gone as red as a tomato, and set off towards the house. Dean, Harry noted, followed his movements with interest, his eyes fixed firmly on – well, his arse.
Of course, as if summoned by Harry having a flashback to the war, Malfoy strolled in. Harry felt Hermione grab his hand.
Well, apart from Draco and Blaise, who kept up a steady stream of beauties. And Hermione. But that was only four out of fourteen, unless you counted Hermione’s binder of potential boyfriends. Well, Hannah seemed to have an off-again on-again text affair with a boy from her lectures. But that still left –
It all made sense, when he put it together. Malfoy had been cut off by his parents. Malfoy was working in a Muggle pub. Had he challenged his father? Had he genuinely fought with Lucius Malfoy?
Susan gave a sad little laugh. “And say what? That he said some dirty things on a date with me? Nothing happened.”
“Only potentially. One of the Ilvermony lads in my lectures – George, second year, you’d like him – is having a house party and he told me to invite “literally everyone I know.” So that’s what I’m doing. What do you say? Booze, bad music, scandal, possibly drugs – it has everything.”
Michael went down like a stone. Harry had his wand out instantly, trying to work out whether to point it at Blaise or Michael. Blaise was stepping away from the wall, hands in his pockets. He casually kicked Michael in the side.
“And second,” said Draco, refusing to be put off by Theo’s face, “secondly – yeah, fuck everything that happened. It was awful, Theo, but it wasn’t their fault – and it wasn’t ours, either. Not much, anyway. Definitely not yours.” He drank. “Maybe a bit mine. But we can let that be the rest of our lives, and hold those memories sacred, and just live out the remaining century or so we’ve got clinging to a few things that happened in our late teens – or we could live. And drink. And have fun at this party. And you don’t have to do the first thing – I can’t force you – but you do have to do the second and third.”
Harry, because who else would it be? There was probably a limit on the number of horrifically awkward conversations on your doorstep you had to endure per day, right?
“Do you think this is funny for me, Blaise? Having you flirt with me all the time? It’s fucking excruciating.”
“Hermione, I know, but please don’t ruin this for me. Sometimes, you just have to let your inner fifteen year old out.”
“Fine! Just do it, then –“ But Harry had started moving on fine, and he cut Draco off with his lips.
“It was an honour, my dear,” he said, bowing dramatically. She rolled her eyes, and swept out of the room. The second she was out the door, all Blaise’s gallantry melted away.
Malfoy covered his face. “Merlin and Morgana both, Potter. It was supposed to be a joke, you can’t tell me you actually don’t – ugh, whatever. Utilitarianism  is the belief that whatever makes the most people the happiest is the right thing to do. It’s simple maths. One life – yours – for the lives of two-hundred and eighty students in that school. Do you understand? Pansy was trying to do the right thing.”
A shorter chapter than the last monster. Originally, I wanted to break chapter 1 into two chapters and make it a bit more even, but I couldn't work out where to put the break. This one does feature more Slytherins, and also Draco's point of view (and Dean's! Poor Dean.)
The trick was just to hang on. To dig his nails into this friendship and refuse to let go through all the pain and hardship. Eventually things had to get better. They had to. It was actively impossible to be this miserable for his entire life.
- and Hannah Abbot was doing a wonderful job of distracting Seamus from glaring daggers at the Slytherins, but especially Blaise. He was, Harry noticed, not sitting next to Dean, and Dean was carefully not looking at him.
Blaise was still talking about the trials of Muggle supermarkets, but all the noise in the world had cut out, because Harry had just seen Draco again. He was over by the drinks table, laughing with Seamus and Terry. Harry strode towards him. He just needed to –
“Yeah,” said Padma. “That was me. I’m a bitch, sorry. Evil twin, you know the drill. Parvati’s pathetically in love with you.”
“Say, Harry,” said Terry. He had smooth dark hair he wore in a brilliantined wave and a blazer that probably cost more than a nice broom. Harry could never quite shake the feeling that Terry might call him
Harry flipped him off. “We’ll leave that as plan B. Can you explain the rest of this shite to me? The utilitarianism bit was very useful, thanks.”
He tossed his head back. “Yeah, but on me it’s elegant. And a sign of good breeding. Like a horse, or a really fine dog.”
Michael was, unfortunately for them, breathing, so Harry released Nott once they’d gotten the door opened and dragged Michael up instead.
He popped in, hugged Ron and gave him a whispered explanation, getting a thumbs up in return. He waved at the Slytherin’s, breezily ignoring their wails to stay and Draco’s knowing look. When he came outside, Dean was rubbing his thumb across the chalk of the specials board.
“Haven’t we all,” said Draco, rubbing his back. Harry grimly crouched down and put Nott’s left arm around his shoulders, and then the three of them set off towards the grounds in a silence that was stiffly awkward.
“Sure,” said Morag, and let her grin grow wolfish, her eyes dark. Her hand hovered at Daphne’s tiny waist. “I can show you a real good time.”
“Seriously,” said Ron. “There’s nothing evil left for him to do. The only thing he could do to upset you is fight with you, and if you ignore him – sorry, I know, but she’s
The party was beautiful. Blaise had really outdone himself. There were twinkling candles floating above the guests, wrapped in ribbons and holly and the occasional sprig of mistletoe. The shitty walls were hidden behind carefully placed baby firs, or magically charmed fires with chestnuts levitating above them at the perfect state of toastedness. Fairy lights transfigured into the shape of actual fairies decked the ceiling in shimmering strings of loveliness. There was, thank god, no band.
“Thanks. Um, I suppose I’ll owe you that favour.” He turned to walk away, and she grabbed his sleeve.
Blaise turned and sputtered at him. Terry looked like he was choking on his coffee and Morag, the cow, was laughing at him. “I’m sorry. What?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Harry, we’re both queer. We have something in common. I am attempting to build rapport.”
“Maybe – stop doing that?” she suggested gently. Harry’s look made her wonder if her tone had not been as gentle as she thought.
“Hey, Hermione,” said Anthony Goldstein, grinning. He shifted the books he’d caught into the crock of his elbow and straightened up, grinning. “It’s been a while.”
“Girl in the corner in yellow,” said Susan. “Very tricky colour to pull off, especially with her complexion. I should know. Those damn Hufflepuff ties were the bane of my life.”
She looked at Parvati’s dress against her own. The way Parvati had insisted they go together. It wasn’t about the dresses matching. It’s that they were here together, and not as an accident – more as a fact of nature.
Later, she could never say who kissed who first. There was a lot of teeth, and a lot of tongue, and it was yearning and desperate and overall completely terrible. They pulled back, and Hermione held her breath.
“Well, that was weird,” Harry said to the empty air, and resolved not to think about whether that was about Hermione or Pansy.
The music was too loud, and the drinks were shit, and almost everyone here was an American. A lot of them kept coming up to him and
Ron was gaping at him. Harry tried to drink as much of his pint as he could without making it look like he was steeling himself.
They had fucked a dozen times. It wasn’t like he left his shirt on in bed. Potter had seen it, and hadn’t cared. Hadn’t even commented. Like it was nothing. He already knew, he’d factored it into all his calculations, and he just hadn’t given a damn.
“How was everyone’s night?” said Harry, and received a ringing silence in response. Dean was staring out of the window, Terry and Anthony falling asleep on each other’s shoulders, Parvati fiddling with the strap of her dress. Morag glanced around and raised an eyebrow.
They sat down. There was a leaden silence. And then Draco said “Oh, I suppose I need a drink, don’t I?” and Hermione said “Yes, I’ll help,” and then there was just Harry and Pansy Parkinson.
“We’ll go upstaors to mine,” said Harry, grabbing her hand. Malfoy was here, and who knew how thin the walls were? “I’ve got bacon. And tea.”
“I’m glad one of you has a normal name,” said the barkeep, coming over with their change. Draco gave him a look of poorly concealed-contempt.
The next morning, Harry opened his eyes and saw Draco Malfoy. Well, more specifically, Draco Malfoy’s comically shocked eyes.
“I should fucking coco,” said Draco, eyes closed. He looked like a very smug cat, which bought disturbing McGonagall related images to Harry’s mind that he really didn’t need in the wake of sex, thanks. “And this never happens again. Crystal?”
“Wait.” A terrible, terrible idea was gathering in her mind, but it was one that would have no consequences.
She shrugged. “I’m being philosophical about it. Which means that I don’t want to hear about it, and neither do Seamus and Dean.”
Blaise shrugged. “He was bemoaning you and Dean with Seamus last time I checked. I know I’m supposed to be on his side, but you and Thomas would look lovely together. Do let me know if you’d like a third.”
Parvati. There was something off about her whenever she was friendly to Hermione. Something that suggested she thought she was being
The problem with going to the London Stone, thought Harry, was that once everyone had heard it was a shithole, everyone wanted to go there. Including, somehow, the Slytherins. All the Slytherins, not just their university crowd. When Harry turned up on Sunday with Dean and Seamus, there was Draco and Blaise and Theo, of course, but also bloody Parkinson (ugh) and Gregory Goyle, and a blonde girl that Harry would have guessed was Daphne Greengrass, and  -
“They certainly are,” said Dean. Seamus was jumping around the room delightedly, and Blaise was laughing.
“Pity Ron’s in auror training – ow!” Dean had elbowed Seamus in the side, and was looking at Hermione in a way that was meant to be stealthy. Seamus, never one for subtlety, elbowed him back. “What was that for?”
Cormac McLaggen. He wouldn’t let me go back to my dorm without a goodbye kiss, and then he kept saying each kiss didn’t count, that it hadn’t done it properly. He was backing me against the wall. I kept kissing him till he let me go. I didn’t want to do the wrong thing.”
Susan was still trembling. “I don’t know,” she whispered, words slurred, but she let go of Michael when Nott gently pulled at her and let herself be peeled away.
Harry’s grin was upsetting on so, so many levels. “Brill. I’ve got to Ron – I mean run. I’m meeting Ron. I don’t have to Ron. Anyway, I should – I’ll see you around, yeah? Maybe tomorrow.”
Hermione lost her composure then, and had to quickly turn her giggle into a cough when the three girls turned round and stared at her, but Harry couldn’t find it funny. He wondered if there would ever be a time when a mention of a black dog – not even a man turning into one, just
“We have to do something,” said Ron. “I mean, can you imagine what a disaster it would be if she started dating Malfoy? We’d have to be nice to him for the rest of our lives, Harry. Every Christmas, he’d be there at the burrow, poking at the food and asking if this is how poor people eat.”
“I might now,” said Greg, looking at her as if he’d found religion. Ginny and Harry shared hysterical looks. Draco came to settle at Harry’s shoulders, pulling him tight aggressively. It wasn’t as if the Weaslette was likely to want him back, but there was no harm reminding her that she couldn’t.
“I really need to go,” said Harry, squeezing between two very angry women. Draco was still at the table.
“No,” said Blaise. His smile had far too many teeth. “We Slytherins all already knew how, having been raised in the civilized world. Can we help you, Harry?”
“Yes, actually. But it would be worse with you.” He stopped, biting his lip as though he wanted to chew it off so it couldn’t reveal any more.
“You dramatically fucked up, mate,” said Harry, pouring a bit more vodka into his cup. “Calling yourself a catch? That was a pretty dick move.”
“It’s just – he kept on buying the drinks. And when I said I didn’t want one, he’d tell me I was a pretty poor date if I would make him drink alone. But he was having beer and I was having cocktails so – I shouldn’t have gotten that drunk, that’s all.”
“It… It…” It just felt important, somehow. There was some alchemy there, in Malfoy’s change and his big expressive eyes and the way Harry had felt as they debated. “It means I don’t have to worry about him doing something evil this year.”
He was nearly out of the door when Harry blocked his way with his arm. “No. No you don’t. I’m too hungover to play silly buggers.”
They were, but not because of the break-up. They were awkward because Ginny was crying a lot now, and Harry didn’t know how to deal with that, didn’t know if he had the right to. They were awkward because someone would always end up glancing to Fred’s hand on the clock, permanently pointing to
“We weren’t having drama,” said Ron. “We were having a mature, adult conversation. Right, Hermione?”
“Nope,” said Susan. “They need to have this conversation. I can’t stand this much teenage angst any longer. Also shh now, I’m snooping.”
What the fuck does that even mean? Seriously – I have been going over that all day. I cannot do this passive aggressive girly stuff, ok? Just – just tell me what you mean and be done with it!”
He asked Dean about it when they went up to the bar for their next round – Susan was insisting that everyone paid for at least one, which meant that they were going to end the night barely upright – and Dean leant against the bar, downing the last of his pint.
“Hush, Hermione, they’re different flavours. We’re going to mix and match. This one is quince, and this one is elderflower, and this one is a tomato one that Padma bought me as a joke. Every time you say something terrible you have to drink some of that as punishment.”
“She has twenty-eight piercings, Harry. Some are in places I can’t name without squeezing my legs together. The woman has endured pain none of us can even imagine.”
They made out in the bathroom, leaning against the sinks. Someone shouted something rude and Jordan hexed them without taking his mouth away from Harry’s neck. Everything was warm and nice and blurry. At one point he thought Blaise was talking to him, but he didn’t pay much attention. Maybe he should take Lee home, let him fuck him. Maybe –
“Nah,” said Harry. “I imagine the Slytherin common room was just like this all the time. Everyone being cryptic and repressed until you’re not even sure what you’re fighting about.”
“It means I like men and women. I swung both ways. Very liberally, if that interests you.” He winked at Dean. Harry expected a scoff, or a polite brush off. But Dean just smiled, in a way that he had definitely never smiled in the common room. Smiled with intent.
“Don’t worry, Potter, there’s no need for murder today. This is just a friendly chat about Michael’s future at university, right?” He kicked Michael onto his side. “You have two options, Michael. Option one, you are going to tell the university that you have come down with Dragon Pox, and immediately leave to stay with your family while they nurse your back to health. While you’re there, you’ll have a sudden realisation about your future and put every possible second of your time into transferring somewhere that is
“What if he starts on the both of them? I mean, Pansy’s not at uni. He could conceivably have them both on the go. I should have listened to you in sixth year, Harry. He’s Malfoy. He could be up to anything.”
“Oh.” Parvati was regaining her colour. “You remember that the guy thing is all you, right? I told you about – “
“You think this is making history?” Parvati raised an eyebrow, and Hermione sighed. “Yeah, yeah. You got me. I’m sorry.”
“We’ll only be a minute,” said Blaise, as he steered Michael towards the back exit. “Potter, hold the table for us.” He bent low, dropping to a whisper. “Meet me outside in ten minutes.”
Harry shifted uncomfortably on the hard kitchen chairs. “I mean, you’re inviting everyone from both flats. It’s a bit rude to leave him out.”
There was Harry, walking back from a lecture with Granger next to him fussing over something the lecturer had said, how he was totally wrong and that kind of thinking was
Draco just shivered, and let Harry wreck him. Harry gripped at Draco’s shoulders, back, ran his hands through his hair and pulled them together. He kissed Draco’s neck, nipped at his ears.
“Probably,” said Harry. Except that Malfoy had been hanging around like a sad-sack, that day in the kitchen, and it had made Harry feel worse. He’d been shaking. And even if he wasn’t up to no good, there were still questions floating around him. Why had his parents dropped him? Why had he lowered himself to working in a Muggle pub? For seven years, Harry had thought he knew pretty much everything that Malfoy was thinking, and now he didn’t have a bloody clue.
Susan, apparently moved beyond words, paused for a moment and then let out a shriek. Blaise reached out to grip her by the shoulders and then stopped, frozen in the air, as Susan moved away from him towards the door.
“Hey Pans,” said a soft voice, and then Ron slid in next to her and handed her a glass of white. “I don’t know what dry means in terms of wine, so I just asked Draco which one was best.”
“The Ravenclaws totally stole our idea,” said Dean as they settled onto a (distressingly sticky) table. “They’re doing a Last-Hurrah-of-Ravenclaw tonight.”
“When have I ever behaved like that? You’ve been spending too much time with Gryffindors, you’ve forgotten how normal people act. Anyway, the two of you are so angular. The baby would get his nose and your cheekbones and end up piercing its way out of the womb.”
Harry looked down at the tabletop. “I guess it feels like it doesn’t matter as much anymore. I mean, I died. That’s a pretty good excuse for a fresh start.”
Harry took one sniff of the sambuca and had to hold his breath and count to ten before he spewed all over the table. “Nope. Pansy?”
“Ok, my favour. I’m going to ask you a question, and you have to answer absolutely honestly, and you can’t tell anyone that this ever happened.”
“I haven’t got the heart to tell him. I just feel like I’m different people with all of them. I’m trying stuff out, you know? With Michael I get to be this pretentious arty intellectual, and with Anthony I get to be academic and sexy and political – we’re going to a protest for Centaur Rights, which – “
“Fine Art,” said Dean. “I can’t believe Hog – uh, school never taught us much about it. I mean, I always knew how to draw in the
The evening was surprisingly pleasant. Hermione and Pansy were cautiously circling each other, but in a friendly seeming way. Like dogs sniffing each other’s bums or something. Draco and Pansy kept trying to one up each other with embarrassing stories. The appletinis were flowing. Life was good.
It had seemed simple at the time – go to university, meet new people, befriend new people, possibly (definitely?) have sex with new people. In her zeal for understanding all that life had to offer, she’d forgotten one little problem – people, generally, didn’t seem to want to have sex with her.
CD Player,” said Dean, and after thirty seconds the room was filled with the sounds of punchy guitars, and Seamus tipped back his head and howled. Dean was laughing and Blaise – who Harry had been worried about – was laughing too. There were a few tears in his eyes that he wiped away discreetly, but his happiness looked genuine, and Harry let himself relax into the champagne, and the music, and Seamus’s aggressive dancing. Blaise taught them all Kings, a game where the primary rule seemed to be “get absolutely fucked up,” and Seamus and Dean nearly knocked themselves out diving to be “thumb master,” which happened every time someone drew a five.
They made their way to the back, Hermione and Parvati close behind, to find Ron waiting at a table behind a rope with Pansy Parkinson who was – well. She was wearing what looked like a lacy bra, and a skirt so short that Harry had to do a double take, with a leather jacket over it that could give Morag’s closet a run for it’s money in terms of projecting “don’t fucking talk to me.” She caught sight of them arm in arm, looked censoriously at Draco, and finished her drink.
what’s wrong. I’m behaving like a love-sick fool who – “ He broke off. “Fuck. Granger, you’re a sensible girl. Is there an – an – anti-amortentia? Asking for a friend.”
“Oh, do you want to borrow my ugly jumper too? I mean, you already seem to be trying to get my Weasley.”
“So how was Thomas?” said Draco, ambushing Harry as he came out of the campus coffee shop. He had something with whipped cream in his hand, and he looked far too happy for anyone’s sanity. “Good points? Bad points? Marks out of ten?”
Harry looked at him sideways. Draco was bouncing as he walked, smiling aimlessly. “You’re, like, ridiculously happy today. Did you take something from Blaise?”
“I know that, but she doesn’t know it. She needs someone who gets her, you know? Someone who isn’t going to force her to be the pureblood wife she doesn’t want to be.”
That was fine. On cue, Parvati appeared on the other side of Hermione with metaphorical precision, and Hermione turned towards her, face lighting up.
His eyes flicked up and he caught sight of Harry watching them. He realised too late what a pervert he probably looked like, standing there shellshocked. A complicated tangle of emotions crossed Malfoy’s face, until it settled on anger.
November was a time of stress and deadlines and throwing herself back into all the extra-curriculars that Hermione hadn’t had time for what with the boys and the Parvati of it all. Not that she wasn’t still finding time for her friends. Probably.
“No!” said Harry, images flashing across his vision of Blaise luring away his rivals in love and then burying them in shallow graves. He couldn’t die here. It would be a shit place to be a ghost. “I mean, yes, I care about her, but I’m not, like, into her – “
“Ok, ok,” said Draco. “Stop for a second. First, aren’t we a bit old to be all house-rivalry about this? I’m a Slytherin, and I’ll always be a Slytherin – and so will you, and I don’t plan to ever be ashamed of that. But the core of Slytherin is ambition, and cunning and loyalty. Not hating the ‘other side’. For god’s sake, weren’t Salazar and Godric rumoured to be, uh – you know.”
“So what?” said Harry. “They all know you’ve been cut off. It makes them like you more, if anything.” From Malfoy’s grimace, that had not been the correct tack to choose. “And I won’t tell them,” he said quickly. “Honest. I’ll say I just helped you carry them out.”
A door opened somewhere in the apartment, and they jumped apart, guilty and twitchy and, in Harry’s case, confusingly half-hard. He thought vigorously of Filch and Umbridge making out, and prayed Malfoy didn’t look down. Theodore Nott came down the corridor, whistling aimlessly. He stopped when he saw the two of them, lurking guiltily in the kitchen doorway.
“I didn’t say she was right,” said Malfoy. “I’m just saying – she wasn’t blindly trying to save her own life. She was doing a calculation.”
“What would you know about style, Granger? Oh I forgot – Patil’s dressed you up a few times and now you feel like a real girl.”
Her face had dropped, and she’d stormed out and left him to make a mess of his own life. Which he had. With aplomb.
Draco called him Harry now, but only Potter when they were in bed – unless Harry was fucking him, when he forced him out of it. He asked Draco about it when they were lying there in the afterglow, legs tangled around each other.
Hermione grinned and twirled. She was wearing a dress of deep red with a neckline that plunged down to her navel. It clung tightly to her hips and thighs, flaring just above her knees and giving her the kind of silhouette that Harry associated with Marilyn Monroe. Her lips were an even darker red, bright against her dark skin, with a pale gold shimmer on her eyes and cheekbones. Around her neck she wore loops and loops of filigree cold chains so delicate that Harry worried they would be pulled apart with one touch. Her hair had began to grow out from it’s close crop into the close corkscrews that he associated with her, and he was glad she’d decided to forego Sleakeazy’s.
Harry was sweating by now, Hermione wasn’t being any help by looking at him with a knowing look in her eyes.
Following Draco up to the third-floor bathrooms, where Moaning Myrtle was, Harry watched as Draco ripped off his sweater, and started sobbing.
At the statement, Harry froze, utterly petrified. This time he knows for a fact that Parkinson did this on purpose. This was evident by the horrified look on Malfoy’s face as he resisted the urge to drink. Harry blamed Malfoy if they were discovered.
“Did you really mean that confession, last night, at the bar?” Now that shattered all confidence that might have been gained in the past few seconds.
Draco broke the eye contact as he twisted his head so that Potter couldn’t see the blush on his face. But he underestimated Harry Potter, as Harry could clearly see the tips of Draco’s ear reddening.
Draco doesn’t know what to do, his arch-nemesis plus crush for years had just listened to him confess his love.
“It’s been an hour already; don’t you think Professor McGonagall would be back soon?” Draco snapped.
Katie Bell had been cursed, right in the middle of the pathway, the culprit was a piece of jewellery. But Harry had long learnt his lesson of looking down at jewellery.
Taking one last glance at Malfoy, Harry reluctantly stood from his seat and strode towards the stage. He only turned around when he was right in the middle, standing as though he was ready for a fight, which was true, and watched as Malfoy walked towards him, never breaking eye contact.
Typical Hermione, leave it to her to organize an inter-house party right after he and Malfoy duelled and had detention yesterday.
I can’t hide my smile. She does this a lot, my mother-in-law: referring to Draco like he’s some kind of misbehaving five year old. It brings me some stupid kind of joy every time it happens.
Approximately ten minutes after the loud crack of Apparition echoes through the entire fifth-floor of the Ministry, breaking through all the wards, every single person in the DMLE knows these facts for sure: The Head Auror has been kidnapped.
He expects Potter to deny, to pull back then. The man loves a challenge. But he doesn’t, not this time. He lets his body sag against Draco’s the tiniest little bit and says, “Yeah. Make me feel good, Malfoy.  Please.”
May comes and goes and everyone is talking about that day. Pansy’s eyes are rimmed red when she sees him and she mumbles — unintelligibly, in between sobs — words that sound like “anniversary” and “I thought” or “I feared” and “gone,” “like Greg.”
It is simple. I don’t eat until we’re back. I know some people do, but it feels too early. I may be awake, but my stomach isn’t. Tea keeps me going until we’re back and once the fish is passed to the women to take to the market, I come back home and finally make myself a coffee and thick slices of buttery toast.
He gets a rush when Harry looks at him, something wild and fiery at the pit of his heart. It’s almost as good as cocaine euphoria and he likes it. He allows himself to like it, he lets the burn slow down but not go out. He’s no longer a wildfire, he’s a hearth in midwinter, he’s a bonfire in the height of summer, he’s a bluebell flame floating inside a jar in the night.
Their fingers brush when Draco reaches out for the lit joint and he lets Harry fall back onto his chest and maybe that’s the first time in nearly a decade that Draco feels peace.
He alternates slow long licks over Potter’s rim and fully fucking him with his tongue. Potter’s grunts and the way he desperately grabs at the sofa cushions have him going wild, and it’s not long until Potter gasps, “fuck, I can’t, Draco, I can’t, I’ll come if you don’t stop.”
Draco closes the door behind him and says, “What can I do for you, Potter?” thinking a healthy bowl of pasta and a glass of water may be in order. He may even have a sobering potion in the bathroom sink cabinet upstairs.
“Don’t come,” Draco says again, with a mean little twist of his wrist that Potter repays him with a whine.
Potter likes it. Draco doesn’t know why he’s so surprised, Potter has liked most things so far. He’s not massively into being restrained, which Draco doesn’t mind. He’ll try anything though, Draco’s convinced.
Waking up before the sun is up is unnatural. It’s unnatural at any stage of life, even if neither of my babies agree with the fact.
And when the waves come rushing in — tide high and unrelenting — and he misses the buzz of the drugs, it’s into Potter’s bed that he sweats and weeps.
He seals the office as he would a crime scene, with sure, practiced slashes of his wand — every procedure correct, no mistakes — and only then does he allow himself to put his head in his hands and whisper,
“Have you been wanking to the thought of me?” He presses further, testing the waters. Seeing how gone Potter really is.
“I am dying,” he says, and Ron makes a noise that can only be described as half agony, half agreement.
Exactly thirty-seven minutes pass between the moment a gloved hand leaves the note on the Head Auror’s desk and the shrill voice of Mavis, the Head Auror’s secretary, calls, in a panic, “Deputy Auror Weasley!” and then, almost immediately after, “Ronald Weasley!”
Draco is now what he had always wanted to be at Hogwarts. The most desirable, best looking thing. A prize to claim, a trophy to have; and every night men are drawn to him like Icarus to the sun.
the one time we want them up in the middle of the night would be the one night they’re sound asleep.
The wand slides out of my sleeve seamlessly, with ease, as if it’s been waiting for this moment all its life. All my life. All our lives. It feels comfortable to hold, just like it did when I was six, when my mother made it for me. Hawthorn, ten inches, unicorn hair. I still remember the way my heart had leapt inside my chest at hearing my mother say “unicorn” outside of a fairytale context. Unicorn, like something that exists just like myself and her.
“Is this what you wanted, Potter? What you’ve been thinking about?” He asks, and Potter nods, vigorously, eyes unfocused and mouth slack.
And he keeps waking up in Potter’s bed, and eating his meals, and seeing his friends, and the next time he sees Pansy she smiles and she doesn’t call Potter any names.
Draco takes his time teasing him. Zapping him with the wand, and then licking the area right after. Stroking Potter’s cock, and sending a jolt of electricity through him when he's sufficiently distracted.
Narcissa talks me through everything we need to get ready by tomorrow night, and by the time Jamie cries from their cot, I feel like I have some idea of what I’m getting myself into.
And it dawns on him. Draco tries to look down but it’s all red. The burgundy of his robes, the sticky dark red of drying blood on his hands and the fresh and vivid blood still pouring out of his chest. He’s not gonna make it to St. Mungo’s, he’s never going to make it
Potter hadn’t suddenly become kind or any nonsense like that. He scowls at Draco all day long, a sad little frown on his handsome face — there so often it almost looks like it belongs. But Draco sees him, like this, when they’re not at work. Draco knows that at night, Harry Potter replaces that frown with a shy smile and hungry eyes.
Draco notices there’s still something at the bottom of the bag when Harry pulls out the square white box, but he doesn't say anything. Harry flips the top open on the box so Draco can look inside at the brightly iced cake that reads
Vincent and Greg’s families have always been fishing people, too. Their fathers before them and their father’s fathers before them. Just like me. It’s just the way it is in Slytherin.
Draco had his suspicious Potter would be a size queen, at this point. Or hopes, maybe. Who knows, really, at this point? Who would have a spare thought in their brain when
Draco squeezes Potter’s neck rhythmically, squeezing tight and letting go, and doing it again, watching for Potter’s reactions as he continues to suck on Draco’s fingers. Draco lets go when Potter pulls his head back and says, “Fuck, Malfoy. So good.”
“What are you doing?” Draco asks, but doesn’t pull back. He asks it against Potter’s lips, a prickle of nervous energy buzzing under his skin, all over.
He doesn’t know how long it passes, but Potter is washing him and telling him he’s eating much better now, that it’s good he has an appetite again. That they can go running together when Draco has the strength, that they can go dancing if Draco doesn’t think that’s playing with temptation too much.
He tells me to steer the boat away from the coast, and despite my best instincts I do as he says. This is it now. There’s no going back. For better or for worse, I’m at the mercy of the man they used to call Harry Potter.
They’re not dating, not really. At least it hasn’t been discussed. Pansy says they are. Pansy may have a point. Thing is, they’ve not discussed it, so they aren’t.
The cake is forgotten. Harry, and the blade in the box, are dragged into the bedroom with an urgency Draco has never felt in his life.
For what it’s worth (not much, Harry’s still dead), the stone is exactly what Draco had ordered, and seeing the carved
Which he resolves quickly by wrapping his hand around Potter’s cock, making him raise his hips up in unconscious response. “Relax,” he says. “You want this, Potter. You came to my house, at this hour, for me to make you feel good. Let me.”
The sun is getting lower in the sky, casting a sickly late autumn glow on everything. Harry would find a way to romanticise it, call it
“Sit down, Harry,” she says, gesturing to the chair in front of me. Not one to disobey a Malfoy (or a Black, for that matter) when they use that tone, I take a seat.
Draco has no ground to stand on, at all. But Potter doesn’t need to know that. He doesn’t need to know how much Draco wants him to keep showing up on his doorstep. To keep looking at him across the bullpen the way he does, to keep accidentally touching him at the pub — subtly, softly, making Draco’s pulse quicken and cock stir awake.
He remembers saying it after being thrown on his arse by the family Abraxan. He’d been very little, then. Five or six, maybe. He’d cried, big fat tears running down his face, and when his Mother finally managed to pull his tiny fists down and stop him from hiding his crying behind them, he’d announced, “Maman, I am dying.” She had assured him he very much wasn’t. They’d had scones with big heaped spoonfuls of clotted cream and raspberry jam in the garden and he’d soon forgotten about his fall.
And it turns out Harry Potter holds stars in his hands, and they spark all over Draco’s body as Potter pushes him against the damp brick wall outside The Attic, pushes their bodies together over the softest bed Draco has had under him in a while, pushes into Draco with a gentle touch Draco is not used to. They flare all over Draco’s body, as Potter’s hands cradle his face, as they meld together like wax dripping off the side of a forgotten candle, as Draco spills his adoration into Potter’s mouth, over his lips, his chin.
Harry lands somewhere in Yorkshire, at the very edge of a large property that is mainly overgrown land and a couple of trees on the Northeast side. To the left of him stands a small stone building, a little too big to be labeled a shed, but not much more than that. Harry knows exactly what’s inside it: farming tools that look older than Hogwarts itself, the carcass of a sheep that didn’t make it through winter, and a locked trunk full of Dark artifacts Lucius Malfoy had collected along the years.
“No, they don’t. Not with my maniac husband on the case,” Draco says, and finally, finally lowers his hand to cup Harry’s hardness through his boxers.
But under my father’s own roof, my mother taught me everything I know. And the moment I see the siren, I know what to do. I know this is the chance I have been waiting for – the nugget of hope I’ve been holding in my heart. The only way Hogwarts can ever be itself again, beautiful, thriving,
That’s when the most surprising thing happens. Potter launches himself at Draco, grabbing the back of Draco’s neck with a wide cold hand that makes Draco shiver, and makes to pull Draco down into a kiss.
Draco isn’t sneaking around; he’s loud enough that she must know he’s there but he doesn’t announce himself or greet her before he’s right next to her, both of them facing the tombstone, side by side.
Draco isn’t often lost for words. In fact, he doesn’t quite remember the last time he didn’t have something rude or self-deprecating as a quick answer to something. But he truly doesn’t know what to say. He just looks at it, between them.
It doesn’t help that Draco keeps getting partnered up with Potter since Weasley walked out. He doesn’t want to complain — no one else in the Auror Training Program so much as tolerates him. Potter is his best option. And they’re well matched. They’re well matched working case files, they’re well matched interrogating, and Salazar, they are well matched dueling.
He does it whenever Draco looks down at whatever fruity cocktail Pansy is making him drink, or when he’s leaning into her to hear her say whatever she’s bitching about now. Draco isn’t listening to Pansy. Mostly because he’s looking back at Potter. Catching him
“The sun will be up soon,” he tells me. A whisper. A gentle caress of his lips against my skin. I lean into it. He looks at me, then at the basket, then at the people we have chosen to take care of our children should anything happen to us.
When the first rays of sunrise climb over the horizon line, Neville and Astoria are standing very close together on one side of the fire with Fleur and Blaise doing the same across from them. The Juniper branches smell rich and inviting as they burn, and the crackle is almost as comforting as Draco’s hand in mine. The babies are passed over the fire three times. One. Two. Three. Scorpi first — big grey eyes curious and focused on the fire, then Jamie — crying at the top of his lungs.
I approach the net and look down, but can’t tell anything out of the ordinary from inspecting it. The usual, under the rippling water – bright shimmery scales. It gets increasingly obvious we can’t go on like this the further we go. I pull on the net once, then twice, three times. I am not weak, not by any means – you don’t really get a chance to be, in this life, but I can’t haul it, can’t even bring it slightly closer to the surface for a better look. Whatever is stuck in the net, it’s bigger and heavier than the loads of fish I’m used to pulling all day long.
At age forty, I like to think I am well aware of the workings of the Wizarding World. Sure, I didn’t know it was even a thing at age ten. And at twenty… well, I didn’t really care much for anything at twenty — things were hard then. And then I was a prick for a good while, but Draco sorted me out, for better or for worse (it’s mostly better). I eventually learnt about magical inheritance rules, and about Pureblood courting traditions (not to mention
He could come right there, just from looking and he squeezes the base of his cock a little too hard just to keep his cool.
He ended up in Gryffindor, I believe, for a while. And then out at sea. Not like me, not like the other Slytherins. Not free, in our boats. He ended up in the island they send our prisoners to. Azkaban. A desolate rock full of nothing but despair.
He’s alive, and that in itself is a miracle. He’s allowed to live. And live he does, even if Pansy doesn’t agree with his concept of living. For all her qualities she can be quite blind when she wants to be. She coddles him, asks him casually why he doesn’t charge if fucking is all he does, why he doesn’t take a full time sugar daddy. He doesn’t want to have to explain that it’s not money he needs. It’s the attention he wants. The eyes that fall on him with love and lust and need. The eyes that don’t see how ugly he is inside. Under the rose-tinted sunnies of a drunk stranger, Draco is a dream. And only Draco gets to go home and laugh himself sick about how Wilde had it right. In The Attic, Draco is Dorian Grey come to life; he is the shiniest, plumpest piece of fruit on the tree that no one knows is rotten and full of maggots under its unbroken skin.
I often think my mother does have something in common with that cousin who left and ended up rotting in Azkaban. Only she’s quiet about it, she’s resourceful. Because Mr. Riddle has broken my father through fear and threat and evil. And my father does his bidding, works for him, relentlessly, day and night. It’s much more than fishing, it’s ensuring no one ever speaks of it, no one goes against Riddle’s agenda. No one thinks of all we used to have in the beautiful world we live in. No one thinks of
Draco comes in his pants, suddenly and hard, heart beating in unison with the music, when Potter says “fuck, yes, fuck, I’ll be thinking of you, please, Malfoy.”
“You want to, but you’re not going to. You’re going to get on your knees like the pretty thing you are, and you’re gonna blow me.”
Traditions are funny, in my eyes. I never had any, until late in my life. This is very much like the Order of Merlin ceremony (for which Hermione’s voice repeated in my head what I was meant to say and do), or my wedding (for which Draco’s voice repeated in my head what I was meant to say and do).
And he’ll die and won’t ever get the chance to tell him, to kiss his handsome, stupid, precious face, and it aches — it hurts almost as much as that spot just to the left of his breastbone where the Curse had hit, where he was profusely bleeding from not long ago.
What really matters is what happens on the fourth Victory Day, as it’s known now. On the second of May 2002, a horribly wet and cold night, Draco bites into his slice of lime, sucks the juice into his mouth and washes away the tequila and his eyes meet the eyes he had least expected to find in The Attic.
Harry Potter feels like a violent storm brewing. Heaving and roiling above Draco, leaden and ready to burst, on a bright warm late summer’s day.
“We need to stop doing this. This is no way to take a holiday,” Harry says, but sighs contentedly when Draco slides off him and starts taking his trousers off.
“You were in love with him the whole time, weren’t you?” And that is the Astoria Draco has known most of his life. Straight to the point, sharp as a knife.
Potter kisses him after a while and Draco strokes him slowly to ease his guilt at his torture. He keeps telling him, like he did that first time at the club, “You’re gonna stroke yourself for me tomorrow, aren’t you? Gonna come thinking of me. Of my cock in your mouth and my tongue in your arse,” and Potter begs him to stop before he comes, again.
There are boats out at sea already. Only a couple. Small trawlers like mine. The bigger vessels do full day trips, even upwards of 30 hour round trips, and when I think of them I’m struck with gratitude for my small trawler and my three people crew. The bigger boats, the kind my father works in, will be leaving after us or coming back after we do. Most are just dark shapes across the horizon for now, fishing further out, where the only reminder of land is the lighthouse’s fire burning bright.
The first time Draco sees Harry’s tombstone is nearly twelve years after the funeral. The service was on an unbearably hot day, everyone sweating in their black robes. What is now an impressive grey slab stone was but a mound of dry crumbly dirt that a very small Scorpius — unaware of the unspeakable loss that had just shaken his family — tried to put in his mouth by the fistful.
He pushes himself off the pillow slightly and his hand pulls Harry’s green robes closer until their lips meet, clumsily and hard — Harry not expecting it, Draco waning from the efforts of pulling Harry closer, but Draco will die knowing he’s kissed Harry. And if there’s no later, at least he’s done it. At least Harry
I can’t stop looking. I try, but for every second I am looking him in the eyes, I spend two staring at his forehead.
“I had a feeling we’d meet here one day.” She sounds like a villain in a bad film, the kind Harry used to like. Draco doesn’t say anything — what is he even meant to say to that?
God, if he exists, is a cruel and pitiless being. After twelve years of mourning, of raising a son alone in hiding, Draco comes back to find his two exes in the same place. One overground. One underground.
It was the persistent horror of knowing you don’t believe in what you’re doing and knowing you’re damned if you do it and damned if you don’t. Between the ages of sixteen and eighteen, Draco would lie in his bed at night — his own at home, his own in the dorms, Pansy’s in the girls’ dorms when it got bad, and he would say it to himself, hoping it would become true, “I am dying.”
Time passes stunningly quickly, Draco’s fire flickering away, unbothered, flame undying like a votive candle drowning in a sea of wishes and prayers.
. He’d say the wind was whispering softly and rustling the leaves. The wind is giving Draco a headache.
Potter undresses when he’s told to. He fits over Draco’s knee like he belongs there. Draco can feel Potter’s hard cock — both a distraction and a reward as his hand delivers blow after blow on Potter’s perfect arse.
I realise that seeing as you’re never invited to one of these unless you’re a parent or godparent, this would be the first time Blaise and Astoria have ever been to one of these. Neville and Fleur look a lot more at ease with what they’re doing, and I realise all their children must have had one of these ceremonies too.
May comes and goes for a third time and, as if it’s not a day of mourning, an owl drops an invite to Theo and Daphne’s wedding (and what a joyous occasion that will be), and Draco spends his hours fucking Blaise into oblivion, wondering who it hurts the most, after all. Is it arson if they’ve both asked to be burned?
Potter is stupid enough that he thinks it’s a genuine accident when Draco walks into his path and Potter has no time to stop himself from slamming face-first into Draco’s chest.
Chaos descends onto the Auror Office at an unprecedented speed, a swift domino effect that topples out of the office door and soon the whole DMLE is in uproar.
I like Blaise. He was the last of Draco’s friends to warm up to me in the end, which was surprising, considering all the…
“Fuck,” Potter practically moans and Draco wonders if he’s drunker than he thought he was because there is no way this is actually happening.
Potter does, in one of the most devastating displays of submission Draco has ever witnessed. Draco sits on the sofa, spreads his legs and undoes his trousers just enough for him to be able to get his cock out.
Something very warm and very bright suddenly makes its presence felt very deep in Draco’s chest. He chooses to ignore it and aims his prick at Potter’s waiting mouth.
Potter gasps for air when Draco’s hand wraps around his curls, now so much longer than they were a year ago but just as soft. “Malfoy, please,” he says, pulling his mouth off Draco’s cock and lapping at the head.
Draco drags him over to his sofa, pushes him down. It’s odd, really, this Potter who doesn’t fight back. It’s odd because there’s no loud music, and they’re not in a rush to get off in a dark corner of a club, surrounded by a mass of bodies and lit by a kaleidoscope of dancing colours. And it’s odd because it’s out of place. Because Potter is in his house, begging for Draco.
“Are you happy, Draco?” She sounds like a cheap therapy session, like a Floo call with Hermione, like one of the self-help books Blaise buys him for his birthday.
Potter goes very still and looks at him with very open eyes, like a rabbit trying to throw off prey.
“Draco, please,” Harry says, and Draco bites his lip. He drags the blade a little harder against Harry’s thigh and gasps, just as Harry does too.
I help him dive back into the water and promise to meet him at sundown, when there are no boats around anymore. He reaches for my face, a gentle caress on my cheek with a wet hand – something I’ve never gotten from anyone, other than my own mother.
He doesn’t know why it’s like that but when he sinks down on Potter’s cock, Potter’s eyes locked on his, he knows that this is about to be the most intense shag of his life.
He’s not a man, though. Not really. He’s a beautiful and inviting smile, he’s wet skin and a sparkling scaly tail, as shimmery and as bright as his eyes. I wonder if his singing would get me to do his bidding, get me to follow him into any and every situation. But there’s no singing. There’s only his bright smile, the kindness in his eyes as he asks me about my life, about who I am.
Until now, that is. This time he’s pretty certain he won’t be afforded such luck. He feels the curse hit him square on the chest. It’s his own fault, really, for not realising there was someone already in the room he entered. He’d been too busy throwing a rather flourished Incarcerous across the room at the two potions dealers he’d been running after for the past five minutes to notice the third man.
“Hello, Draco.” Cool as always, almost as if she expects him to be there. Not likely, since Draco hasn’t been in the country for over a decade.
, she thinks — doesn’t seem to notice. He doesn’t notice her unusually anxious attitude, doesn’t notice the chaos as he walks behind her all the way to Ron’s office, his too-milky tea not spilling over the cup only by miracle.
He can’t help but keep spreading Potter’s cheeks open, making him wince in expectation, but never following through. Potter gasps when Draco slaps his sore arse and then whines when Draco digs his nails in just a little too hard.
He really doesn’t fancy getting kicked out of one of his favourite Muggle clubs for indecency but there’s no way he’s stopping this — not when it might be his only chance.
Draco keeps a tight grip around Potter’s neck as he wanks him, slow and hard and watches as Potter’s breaths get shallower and shallower. Draco knows he’s made a mistake almost immediately in not freeing his own cock, because the pressure is torture but he doesn’t want to let go of Potter just yet.
Trawlers need maintaining, need looking after, but mostly, they do their own work. We set the net for the desired depth and we let the fish get themselves caught. I like to think the waiting is not idle, but we often take turns having a kip in the cabin while the other two keep watch. But that doesn’t mean that we don’t get a little while to enjoy it when the sun finally pokes its bright tendrils over the edge of the horizon, marking the start of a new day.
, she’s a stubborn fuck no one can get rid of. The day she was told point-blank she was no longer fit to serve as an Auror she’d announced immediately she would be staying on as someone’s secretary, she didn’t care whose. But she would only leave the Auror Department in a coffin, and that was final.
The last time, Draco had only hooked his pants just under his balls and let Potter go to town. The look on Potter’s face this time is one hundred percent worth getting fully undressed for.
Harry reaches for the vial of oil on the bedside table and grins down at Draco. He pours a little onto the palm of his hand and strokes both their cocks, coating them in the lube.
The kiss they had last night was soft and gentle, and mostly because Draco hadn’t really paid attention to it since he was still in shock of Potter stealing his first kiss.
Malfoy gave him a polite nod before heading off to the dungeons, from the way his footsteps bounced a little, Harry knows that even though Malfoy wouldn’t admit it, but he was probably the happiest throughout the whole conversation.
After a few moments of blinking her eyes and adjusting to the light, she realised that she’d fallen asleep while writing her potions report. She’s currently sprawled across the table in the Slytherin common room.
Draco bore the dark mark. He was a part of the Dark Lord’s army now, serving under his name as evil servants. There was no turning back ever since that day the blazing pain had scorched his arm.
Besides, not after everything Potter’s made Draco suffer, the disappointment from his father; hatred from the other house just because Slytherins were evil, compared to their golden saviour; and the taste of heartbreaking.
He didn’t know why Potter would want to have a secret date at midnight—correction, a meeting—unless he has something urgent to tell him.
Pulling himself back together, Harry made some promises and bid his goodbyes. He is officially retired from war and death, now he’s going to go get his man!
By now, Draco’s heart was pumping at an inhuman speed now. What did he mean? On one hand, he was afraid, was he going to say he was disgusting? But on the other hand, why would the golden boy just stay back to tell him that, that just didn’t make sense. Unlike the muffin-headed characters in the novels that he’d read, Draco Malfoy wasn’t dumb, in fact, if it weren’t for Granger, he’d be top of the class for most subjects.
He saw Malfoy murmur something under his breath that sounded suspiciously like ‘sweet merlin’, but he soon raised his head high, posed himself and opened his mouth.
He shook his head, he hadn’t even told Pansy and Blaise about his task, it was best to stay low for now. Or more of it just wanted to keep bloody Potter safe even after all he’s played with him.
“Because it’s wrong to talk about anyone like this behind- “Hermione was cut short when all three of them heard a loud crash from the pillar behind Harry.
“PoTtAh!” Harry’s ears perked up at the voice, his whole body warmed up, and there was nothing else in his mind then the snarky face of a blond Slytherin.
“Huh? Oh, sorry…” Draco frowned, and walked back to his seat with Harry behind him, “You just look like someone I know.”
Harry felt a lump at his throat when he imagined the conversation, he and Hermione would have later in the night but brushed it away as it was Parkinson’s turn to choose.
After they’ve had a few rounds of that embarrassing game, Padma admitted that she was still a virgin; Neville had revealed his crush on Luna and was making out in the corner, and Ron had told them that he had Hufflepuff themed underwear.
As a result of his very short holidays, he was soon back in the castle with a very frustrated Snape and annoyed McGonagall.
Draco’s brain tells him to run, leap out of the window, escape as fast as possible. But his instincts argued against it. Part of him wanted to never see the man again, but another part craved the man’s presence.
“You! What did you do!” Draco exploded, he did not want to be stuck in here with Potter for one more second, whoever did this must be wanting a death warrant.
“I-I do hate him,” Potter said, Granger narrowed her eyes, “But Hermione why are you standing up for him?”
He used this time to wonder what Potter’ intentions are, sneaking a letter into his dorms just to meet at night.
Maybe it was his Gryffindor traits that had gotten him in Gryffindor rather than Slytherin, his rush of emotions that always results in a near-death experience, but the words just rolled off his tongue before he could even think about taking them back. Not that he intended to take anything back.
Hogwarts is an island itself. I forget it because of how big it is. Because I’ve read about it in books like it’s some fantasy made-up world, instead of the place I live in. Long before the world was what it is now, Hogwarts was divided into four separate kingdoms, with their own history and their own values but still under the rule of Hogwarts. Slytherin has got the largest slice of coast, so fishing became our duty. The Hufflepuff, in the valleys, deal with cattle and agriculture. Ravenclaw, in the mountains, are the kingdom of knowledge, where the universities are, where they invent things and explore the world outside Hogwarts.
“Well same here, it was on top of the drawer when I got back.” Draco huffed. Unbelievable, another trick?
At this point, Harry already felt like he was dreaming. And now, he just knows that this is a dream or nightmare.
“Oh, so now you’re pretending nothing happened after running from this whole morning?” He just couldn’t help it, the anger and magic lashed out at the boy in front of him.
She giggled and kept walking. Leaving a confused Harry and a scared Ron, as the sudden smile surely meant something is being planned in Hermione’s brain.
But Draco Malfoy, the boy who had no ways of showing affection for someone, since his parents never showed him any, could only think of one way to hide his crush towards the Chosen one. Hatred.
And so, when he realised, he was about to confess to Harry freaking Potter, a second time, not drunk, it was a bit of a challenge. Then again, Malfoys never back down from a challenge.
“Oi! Wait Malfoy! I need to talk to you!” Draco heard Potter yelling faintly in the background as he ran the opposite way.
Now he was stuck with some immature but super famous boy in an abandoned classroom for who knows how long. The thing is, Draco still hasn’t given his answer to Potter’s confession, and he doesn’t plan on doing so. And this, he could tell, is going to be the breaking point where he will be forced to admit everything.
He didn’t know why Potter had said those things if he wasn’t only messing with him, but the thought that Potter can’t even
He had no choice, he had to either run away and become a criminal of both sides, light and dark, watching his parents die after being tortured; or it was to save their lives for a little longer, with the price of his own freedom, future and sanity. He never had the right to choose.
“If you don’t have anything to say, then I’m leaving, I need my sleep for tomorrow.” Draco turned around, reaching out for the sliding door.
After the shock, Harry seemed to adore the idea of him resting on his shoulders, as he hesitantly brushed a hand through Draco’s neat blond locks.
Still, he’d expected Malfoy to be more discrete about this, as it concerned both the Malfoy heir and the Boy Who Lived.
Harry watched as Malfoy let the thought travel through his mind, how his nose scrunches up in either disgust or disbelief, Harry dared to hope it was later, and putting back up the Malfoy mask of utter coldness.
“Oh, of course, I don’t, ask Pansy or Blaise, they know best!” Draco exclaimed, somewhat annoyed at the person’s constant questions.
“I said it’s none of your business!” Malfoy stood up, leering at Millicent. Perhaps Millicent just had very slow reaction time because she finally shut up and looked to the ground. Malfoy stood there, panting from anger, and shifted his gaze around the circle. Glowering at everyone who even dared to have an interesting look in their eyes.
“Mate, I know you hate Malfoy, just tell Hermione how wrong she is! That prick will always be a pain in the ass!”
Draco was so scared. He doesn’t want to hear what Potter has to say next, because it is surely words of rejection and disgust. He could hear his heartbreak. He just doesn’t want to shatter it.

Sadly, everything good must come to an end. In this case, Draco broke the kiss when he felt the ropes loosen and drop to the ground, he quickly backed away, panting.
“I promise I won’t let you down! I’ll protect you with all my life.” Potter patted his heart, as a sign of promise.
Harry wanted to dash to the body and perform all the healing spells he knows, everything just to make sure that Draco is alright.
Harry was shocked to hear this, he was raised in the muggle world, and because most gay people were excluded and made fun of because they were different, he was surprised to hear that wizards actually don’t mind.
