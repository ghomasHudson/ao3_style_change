“What happened to them? Was it an accident?”
“He said he needed to catch up with the others,” Blaise explains. “I take it you were too distracted to notice? Accio Joggers!” The whirl swooshes down the hall and a pair of dark blue joggers fly into the room. Blaise catches them and tosses them to a stupified Draco. He can’t quite wrap his head around the fact that Potter’s best friend left. For what? Scenic views and a well-assembled prosciutto and cheese plate? Draco would know, he put the picnic basket together.
Potter’s features had furrowed and his mouth was agape, as if in pain. “Is something wrong?” Draco immediately asked and glanced at his shoulder.
Draco eyed them both. “It’s late, let me see if…” He stared down the hallway and wracked his brain for a way to calm and comfort them. He needed to put them at ease, and he had no idea why he felt so obligated to do so. “I think Padma is still here. Why don’t I have her bring you two some coffee? The good stuff, not the shite in the cantina.”
“You don’t agree?”
“Even you can’t jump headfirst into an enchanted lake without repercussions.” He smiles at him, and his eyes travel down Potter’s body. Draco remembers that Potter needs clothes. He turns to tell Blaise as much, but his gaze falls to Potter’s naked lower body. Draco shudders and his mouth drops open involuntarily. Potter’s muscular legs are perfectly sculpted masterpieces and the treasure that sits between them…
“These hips are fire!” Weasley shouts.
They make their way up a slight hill to a large cluster of old trees. Potter leads Draco up to the top of a rocky incline, with a fallen tree bridging the gap over a ravine.
...and Draco appreciated Blaise’s joke, but Potter didn’t need an oratorical potion. The man needed actual help. He briefly considered getting up and going over to him, but suddenly Ronald Weasley appeared and dragged Potter away from the group, taking him in the direction of the exit.
“Join the club.”
“Sorry, mate,” Blaise said as he shuffled through a mountain-sized stack of paperwork. “It’s been a crazy day, what with the raid.”
Potter huffed and raised his right hand. He moved so fast, Draco had no time to anticipate what he was about to do. Potter splayed his fingers against Draco’s chest and pushed him so hard he fell backwards through the kitchen doorway and into the hall.
“A bit.”
Healers.
“If you’ll just drop it there,” the clerk pointed to an empty space near a corner. “I’ll sign for it.”
October proved to be the busiest month yet for the Trauma Ward at St Mungo’s. Due to professional and intramural Quidditch overlapping, he saw all sorts of injuries from collisions to brain contusions to broom impalement. The weekend prior, the convention center at Diagon Alley had hosted an international Potioneering workshop, which ended with several individuals having seared something, severed something, or been exposed to some form of magical toxicity or poison. Needless to say, Draco had been kept on his toes for the better part of the month.
Of course, Harry Potter lives his life, a life full of friendships, relationships, celebrations, and like everyone, the occasional setback. Draco watches these events from afar. He sees Harry a few times a year at various fundraisers, auctions, charity events, or Ministry galas. They acknowledge each other with the simplest of nods, a cursory greeting that in no way could ever convey the breadth of their past relations.
He would keep the scars a thousand times over if he could erase half the things they represented.
“No, it’s not.”
For all the years Lucius had steered him wrong, it had taken Draco almost the same amount of time to set himself back on course. His mind flashed back and forth between a mild rage and a childish apprehension that now he had no choice in the matter. He had to confront his issues with Lucius because surely his mother wouldn’t let the topic go unspoken and fester between them. He’d have to make a decision soon, even if that decision was a solemn continuance of the status quo. Everything would still be different. Knowing his mother was somewhere on the path to forgiving Lucius meant that Draco was even more alone in his enmity.
But the auctions were something a bit different. He was able to see the responses of the casual observers, the wannabe art collectors, the serious and the disturbed, and to his utter amusement, sometimes even Harry James Potter.
“I know that!” she said, flustered. “It’s your first day and I don’t want you to—well, we’re probably going to be working together a lot, and I wouldn’t want us to get a shoddy start.”
“Do-it-yourselfers.”
Harry blinked. “Malfoy!”
No matter how much he willed it out of his mind, when Draco stepped under the spray of scalding water, the flurry of images and emotions flooded his head and his hand fell into a frantic rhythm around his throbbing cock. He didn’t want to feel this way, but at the same time, he wanted it so badly the desire to get it was tearing him apart.
“Oh?” Draco feigned ignorance.
Draco places a hand to Potter’s stomach and shivers at the frigid contact. In his fantasies, their touches would burn him to his core. He blinks and wills any thought of them away, banished to the darker, deeper recesses of his mind. Blaise reaches up and unfastens Potter’s belt.
A lot of it.
He walked out of the room without a second glance.
He first caught sight of his mother, her figure sliding into the chair facing in his direction. And then his eyes rose to the man behind her, the tall familiar figure helping her push her chair in.

in his desk. By the time he made it to the Trauma Station, the analysis of Muggle substances had come back, and both he and Masker put forth a simple treatment plan to detoxify Potter’s system and keep him sedated and stable. When Draco signed the bottom of the chart, Masker raised a brow. “And the
“We didn’t talk about anything important,” Draco lies, his mind reliving each and every moment the two of them were naked together.
Harry had fallen in love with him. He’d felt it in his bones, in every glance, every touch, every drunken whisper they’d shared under the hazy dim lights of that pub on the water.
It hadn’t been half bad if he was honest. The show received mixed reviews. In fact, he revelled in the unexpected comments that congratulated the theme of accidental mishaps, going so far as to connect the daily faux-pas to much broader instances of one’s own undoing. Of course, Draco’s shock was replaced with mild contempt when he spotted the comments from show-attendee Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived had been there with friends, apparently, and when asked to give his thoughts on the works, merely stated,
Draco closed his eyes. He could feel the emotion building up in his throat and the tears welling up in his eyes. He’d already been crying in the shower and the barrier had been broken. He gulped down hard and nodded. “I’ll be there in a minute. I need to send Blaise a note.”
Harry comes, jerking his hips and writhing under him, grasping Draco’s shoulders in a bruising grip. When Draco slowly unwraps his fingers from Harry’s softening erection, Harry lifts a hand and caresses the edge of Draco’s jaw.
, and willing to help Potter in any way that he could. He craved vindication, for the terrible assumptions that were layered underneath each and every question asked to be unequivocally proven false. He hadn’t yearned for validation on these levels since he’d been at Hogwarts, and it briefly made his stomach turn to think that it was Weasley who was making him feel this way.
Draco scoffs. “Reconciliation? Orion stays on as his assistant. He still saves his life countless times on countless occasions.”
“No, Merlin, Malfoy, I’m just—” he stopped and stared up at Draco. “I’m impressed. I wouldn’t have expected that.”
He ends up sitting beside Lovegood and having a lovely conversation about arctic hobblesnicks and how to properly harvest their horns for the treatment of stomach maladies.
Draco finishes himself off in record time and dresses quickly. He’s out the door and about to call out for Blaise when he almost runs smack into a thestral at the steps of the cabin. “What—”
He sketched.
“Really.” Draco said, unbelieving.
Draco wasn’t a General Healer. He typically didn’t see patients again after their treatment ended. He wasn’t a Mind Healer, either, and he certainly didn’t have the experience to handle someone with addictions or dependencies. But he didn’t think that was what plagued Potter, and he couldn’t for the life of him explain why. He closed his eyes and sat back in his chair, unable to stop his thoughts from supplying the image of Potter before him in his kitchen, his body tense, his eyes so green and so, utterly

nook and cranny.”
“I’m guessing Blaise will get Longbottom and Ginevra to join him in the other one.”
Draco glances around and fails to spot a single strand of red hair. “He’s left?”
“If you say so,” Longbottom replied.
“Shall we take another caller, Harry?”
Draco stared at the ground.
, you can’t believe you actually agree. You catalogue Harry’s gaze, the pride and amusement and subtle hints of lust, and it’s the first time you’re unequivocally happy.
Spinnet could barely get her words out between laughs when Pansy tried her hand at it. “You sound—like—half your tongue’s gone numb!”
Weasley held his arm out for a Side-Along. “We’re going to Twelve Grimmauld Place.”
“I think we should each take a wall to concentrate on while we cast it out.” She cocked an eyebrow and turned to Alicia. “Thoughts on the proper casting ritual?”
Draco almost sneered but closed his eyes instead and pretended he was speaking to a true invalid. “Did you hit your head?” he asked in as neutral of a tone as he could.
fresh strawberry and Mauritian vanilla sponge with strawberry meringue buttercream.”
“You’re not laughing, are you?” Draco asks.
“Since I decided to seduce a pureblood git.” Potter leans in and captures Draco’s lips. Draco thinks he should be numb to the heat of it, but it’s exquisite and intoxicating. Potter’s caught him in one swift action,  and all Draco wants is to get lost in it. He can’t figure out why it feels so perfect, being trapped by Potter’s arms, his lips, his entire being. Potter’s caged him in, and yet, Draco’s never felt freer. It’s all he’s ever wanted, and it’s only a kiss.
“Weasleys’.” “Absolutely not.”
“Many,” Harry tilts his head, “Many,” and captures Draco’s lips in a kiss. “More.”
Two hours later, Draco stands in the grand foyer of the Black family residence after taking off his cloak, keenly aware that it’s the first time in over a decade that he’s been alone in a room with Harry Potter. Once he gets over that fact, it’s polite inquiries and awkward pauses and before he knows it, he’s upstairs peeling away the drop cloths from half a dozen frames and inspecting the canvases.
Harry offers him a coy smile. “Because there’s no mistaking,” Harry takes a step toward him, “what two dozen red roses mean.”
“Oatmeal raisin.”
Nine hours later, Draco stood outside Operating Room Five, completely and utterly fucked.
Something snapped inside him. He lurched forward and grabbed Malfoy’s tweed suit by the lapels, and pulled him close until they were a hair’s breadth apart. Malfoy’s eyes were wide but his mouth had curled into a devious smile, which Harry was definitely
“Your—” Blaise started and then laughed. “Well, fancy that.”
“Guess,” Weasley stepped forward and frowned.
“Wow,” Blaise stared at the table. He bit his lip. “Feel better, mate?”
She’d steered the conversation to work and by the time they sat at their table, they were too busy commiserating about paperwork to notice the table next to them leave and be reset by the waiter. Draco ordered a bottle of wine,
Draco shook his head. “I don’t know. I’m not here every night, and I don’t spend much time there apart from when I sleep.” He thought about some of his sleepless nights, of waking up drenched in sweat and full of an unexplainable anxiety. It wasn’t like that every time he slept there, but enough times to make him wary of an outside force. “I wouldn’t say it’s constant,” he added.
Draco pinches the bridge of his nose. “Not one of you read the brochure, did you? ”
“Neville,” Draco nods, still finding it the slightest bit difficult to call him by his given name.
“Mister Malfoy, your order was signed and dated by both you and Mister Potter. You agreed to pay thirteen hundred galleons for a gold and green mashrabiya five layer cake.”
Blaise laughs. “I’ve done Potter a few favors over at
He closed the mirrored cabinet and stared at his reflection. His hair was still tied back but almost half of it had come loose to rest around his face. His pupils were blown and his lips were stained red from the wine. He let his gaze fall to the pale scars that ran their way down his neck, chest, and stomach before finally allowing himself to acknowledge the half-hard cock between his legs.
“You can’t be anything other than what you are,” Harry whispers and kisses Draco softly. “And that’s the man that I love.”
Draco scowls. “Finnigan? You put him in charge of managing fire?”
Harry threw up his hands and rolled his eyes at Malfoy’s smug smile and his smooth, stupid pink lips. “So I’m guessing we’re doing this again?”
Potter stands before you, his eyes glowing green in the dim light. He’s a mess, but the jinx distorting his face cannot mask his unmistakable tells. He smells of dirt and sweat and desperation, and you can quantify all the lines of his body and his face and his stupid unruly hair in a matter of seconds. You even recognise the ridiculous way he ties his shoes. You hear his voice in your head asking you to help him. Challenging you to be the Saviour in this scenario…it feels wrong. You feel wrong. But it isn’t you, it’s the side you’re standing on.
There was a long stretch of silence before Harry heard Draco whisper
In the quiet of their absence, he relaxes and settles in, claiming his spot on the window seat. The cabin is cozy enough, and he’ll admit the view is picturesque. Large, green trees and striking mountains, it’s quite the winter getaway. He can picture the others out there struggling to hike up through the snow. He brushes off the guilt at having left Blaise to picnic alone with them.
As soon as the door closed, Malfoy pressed himself against Harry’s back, wrapping his hands around him. They trailed over Harry’s chest and came to rest on the edges of his cloak before he peeled the fabric back and over Harry’s shoulders, tossing it haphazardly to the side.
The skin around Malfoy’s eyes wrinkled as he gazed between their mics and stared at Harry, a look layered in amusement and hunger. “Harry and I have much to divulge, but I would be remiss not to start with this week’s biggest news.”
Weasley blinked at him. “Yeah, uh—thanks.”
“I think it would have gone in another direction,” Potter smiles, and Draco can’t tear his eyes away from it. There’s something inspired in Potter’s expression as if he’s imagining the scene. His eyes seem to brighten at the thought and Draco’s left breathless.
“For fuck’s sake,” he breathes and whispers the spell. At this rate, he needs to learn it wandlessly and silently if he’s ever going to function around Potter again.
Draco loses sight of what happens next. He only knows he’s never felt anything like it before. When Potter finally comes up for air, he grabs Draco’s face and kisses him hard and fast. Draco can taste himself on Potter’s tongue; it leaves an ache in his chest thinking of the way it got there.
lowering his eyes to stare at.
Harry shivered. “Erm—Hi everyone.”
A sting of disappointment hits Draco as he realises they’re going to fuck for the first time facing away from each other. But when Potter’s cheek brushes against his arse, Draco realises something else entirely.
“Alone,” she confirmed.
“Good,” Draco nodded, “Now may I get you to lie flat so I can perform your scheduled check-in?”
“Agreed,” Pansy nodded.
Potter cleared his throat. “I knew a few Hufflepuffs who were braver and stronger than most Gryffindors.”
Raising his eyebrows, Blaise gives him a lazy smile. “This has been such a fantastic trip.”
Draco wanted to share his thoughts if only to show Weasley he was capable,
“Me?” Draco baulked. “Well, maybe. Where?”
“This has been the first time we’ve ever shared a meal,” Draco offers.
After opening every cabinet and drawer in the bathroom and finding nothing, they searched the bedroom. The first thing Weasley did was walk up to the four-poster and cast a
The door to the room swings open and Ginevra storms in. Draco’s eyes bulge and he thinks it’s finally happening. This is the end, the dream has become a nightmare and he’s about to wake up.

Draco pales. “No. Why?”
Draco licks his lips and turns to gaze into Harry’s eyes. “Just another...one of many more to come?”
Draco shifted his focus. “And...Alicia…?”
He frowned but did as he was told. They had their routine since he’d started training in Paris. Once a week at least, Narcissa insisted on cooking him breakfast. It had been a learning experience for them both as neither had spent much time in a kitchen without house elves. But after the first few months of trials and mistakes and charred pans, they both managed to get quite comfortable around the kitchen.
was what was most important above all else. It was his father’s voice that told him he was better than everyone else, that blood mattered, and the Malfoy’s deserved power and prestige. But it was Narcissa’s voice that always echoed Draco’s his mind, calmly reiterating that family was independent from everything else, it was strength and resilience and the only thing that mattered.
“Keep going,” Pansy said. She crossed her arms. “It’s almost as if you don’t want Draco to stay.”
“You do?” Draco raised a brow.
Potter licks his lips and grins, and Draco’s certain he’s never been able to stop time before but that moment lasts forever. Potter bracing himself with one hand on Draco’s side, the other guiding his cock to his entrance. He’s biting his lip and pressing slowly, tearing his gaze away from it to stare into Draco’s eyes.
Unable to pinpoint the exact reason why this information drives him to distraction, he sits there teetering between a sort of silent rage and mild, apprehensive yearning.
She set a cup on his desk and sat in one of the extra chairs, taking a slow sip from the other coffee. Picking up the cup, Draco eyed her. “It’s not poisoned, is it?”
“Oye, Harry!” Thomas calls up from the bottom of the slope. “Where are you going?”

The truth was something Draco didn’t want to hear, but Salazar knows, it was what he’d needed. It was truth he sought with every stroke of his brush, and truth that he yearned for when he decided that one day their roles would be reversed. One day it would be Harry Potter on the spot, and Draco would have him on trial for the things that he’d done and he would show the world — and show Harry —
“Of course I’m happy.”
“Did he buy the trousers?”
Blaise smiled and asked, “Where are you living?”
Harry had heard enough. He twisted his shoulders and shoved his hand down so he could feel around for his wand. As soon as he wrapped his fingers around it, he Apparated back to the cake shop.
When Draco returned to the hospital, he realised he and Weasley had been gone almost three hours. Before anything else, he immediately tasked Intern Masker with getting the analysis done on the Muggle substances. Draco used the excuse of changing back into his Healer’s robes to lock himself in his office and have a few moments to process everything he’d just seen.
He’s not the least bit surprised that Potter’s bare chest is an exquisite masterpiece. Beneath the collection of soft curls, the tanned skin tells the story of a reckless junior Auror learning to exercise restraint and balance his ego. The scars across his body are like trophies of his successes, some perhaps painful reminders of his failures. Draco can’t help but feel both honored and insecure in the presence of someone so courageous. Draco has his own scars, some by Potter’s hand, but nothing from his past brings him anything but darkness.
Once in his room, he rummages through his luggage to find something more suitable for the blistering heat of the main room. He settles on a thin, dark green henley. When he goes to the bathroom to splash some water on his face, he doesn’t expect to see flushed cheeks and swollen lips in the mirror. He can understand the rosy complexion, the heat in the other room is almost unbearable. But his lips? Had he been biting them and not even noticed? He shakes his head.
Though he has great trouble removing the feelings those eyes inspire.
art show because surely he went to all sorts of events all over town. But something churns in Draco’s chest when he thinks about the other paintings, the reverence Harry seems to have for Draco’s work, and the way he’d said,
“I suppose I never pictured their relationship in that way.”
His eyes flew open and he shook his head. “No, Mother, I don’t—” He sighed. “You got to choose him, on some level. You chose to love him and be his partner and have a life with him.” Draco couldn’t stop the tears forming in his eyes. “I had no choice but to trust my father and believe in him...believe he knew what was right and he was going to take care of me.” Draco wiped his cheeks. “He was supposed to take care of me. But…”
Harry bit his lip as Malfoy nosed at his neck, breath warm against his skin, the heat of which distracted Harry from Malfoy’s errant touches at his sides.
Was Draco losing his mind?
“No, we aren’t. Haven’t been for a long time.”
“But what about all the sketches and paintings,” Draco pulls back.
That is what he had been doing on Saturday night—an ungodly amount of paperwork—when an intern sent their basset hound Patronus to alert him that a new patient had arrived. Draco made his way to the Trauma Station, a bit of excitement in his step, eagerly wondering if there was a surgery for him in the near future. The enthusiasm faded as he made out the figures of a tall redheaded man and a petite woman with dark curls.
They made the trek up two flights of stairs to the third floor where they found the room destroyed. Draco observed over the overturned wardrobe, a broken bedside table, and the far window shattered on the ground.
“With that, it looks like we are out of time,” Malfoy announced. “Thank you for your interesting questions. From everyone at the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, stay safe and if you see something, have your wand ready and take a closer—”
“I really enjoyed this,” he says, and his voice is low. He’s quite close to Draco. “Us. Having dinner together.”
“Like what you’re doing right now?”
He pushes Draco and makes him lie flat on his back.
“I look exhausted,” he offered.
“The room you said you could only use for
Opening the doors to Draco’s room, Spinnet and Pansy stepped inside and immediately cast a Shield Charm around themselves. Pansy turned and quickly shot a sealing ward on the doorway before heading to the far wall by Draco’s bed.
Draco scowls.
Draco turns around to start unbuttoning his shirt. He closes his eyes, unable to stop the string of images he’s savored from the last time Potter was naked in front of him. Draco gulps and disrobes. By the time he gets to his pants, he’s heard the splash of Potter lowering himself into the water.
Blaise scowled and pointed to the stack of books on Draco’s nightstand. “Who comes on vacation to read?”
He lifted his glass to try the wine for himself. But he hadn’t learned about wine in France, he’d learned from his parents. “Actually, I—” he started to say but faltered when his eyes locked onto the figures taking their seats at the table beside them.
“Hmm,” Draco offered her a nod.
“People die of hypothermia!” Draco cries at Blaise strides toward the cabin’s front door.
“Green

been there, was he spying on Draco? Did he think Draco had been doing something illegal? Was Potter just there for an inspection? Did he drop in after handling the raid in Diagon Alley? What reason did Potter have to dash away without saying a single word?
“The lake was not part of the plan. But the books were. I knew you would love them and we could talk about them, and maybe, eventually, about us.”
“I told you, they belong together.” Potter’s stare turns from wistful to compelling. He clenches his jaw and levels Draco with what feels like a challenge.

When Granger quotes some ridiculous adage along the lines of
“Should we go ahead with the IV Dreamless?” Intern Masker asked.
He remembers Potter’s regret, his apologies—all sixteen of them. Some delivered over piles of study materials during eighth year, others slurred over drinks at the Leaky, and then there was the one late night Floo-call when Draco was back from Paris on holiday. Sometimes the thought of Potter’s regret only made Draco burn hotter, even if it was knowing he’d only been in Potter’s head as a mistake.
He helped Potter up and sat him at the kitchen table. Draco paced back and forth trying to decide what he should do or say. His mind was a flurry of stress, excitement, and shock, all combinations of the night’s events up until that point, and all
need me, then?” he bent over and went to grab his bag.
The memory grounded him and he felt a bit more at ease. Draco walked up to the till counter and explained he was there for a delivery. A rather disgruntled looking clerk nodded and waved him behind the counter and through a beaded curtain. The shoppe’s backroom looked like a bomb had gone off. A dreary sort of purple fog hung low on the ground as a stack of boxes and books rose up to the ceiling.
“Raid?” Draco asked, concerned. “Here?”
She turned and waved him over. “Oh Draco, thank you for coming.”
Harry grins. “Point.”
“Mind the stasis spells!” Draco calls out as he settles in on the couch and sips his red wine. The fire still blazes strong, and the overwhelming heat embraces him again. He looks around for his book. That’s when he sees it: Potter’s toiletries bag open and sitting on the side table, the lubricant bottle sticking straight up for all to notice.
Draco eyes him. “You thought about me? And touched yourself?”
“I love you,” Draco whispers into Harry’s ear, then bites down on his neck.
“I mean, he catches my mistakes,” Harry explained. “It started when I had just become Head Auror. He would point out all my errors and even tell me to use different forms because the ones I’d submitted didn’t actually ask for what I needed.” Harry bit his lip. “But then I started to think about him every time I filled out a request and I made even more mistakes. He started to get a bit…” He tried not to picture Malfoy’s self-satisfied smirk. “…smug…after that.”
To clarify his point, Draco added, “So we can know for sure.”
He found a pair of jeans and a shirt and hastily put them on. He didn’t have much time if he was going to brew the special Dreamless Sleep. Most sleeping potions took less than an hour to brew, but his formula needed to simmer for eighteen hours for the Brilhante Berries to properly permeate it. With two days off from the hospital, he would barely have enough time to prepare it and get it to Potter.
“But I swear it felt like…” Pansy bit her lip.
He knew the future could be something special, but as he sat down behind his desk, the day’s events came rushing back to him.
Both Blaise and Weasley stay silent and stare down at Potter’s motionless form.
Harry — overheated, anxious, and starving — couldn’t stop himself from shouting, “Open the box, Draco!”
for the position.”
“That will be all,” Malfoy said. The door closed and Malfoy turned back to Harry. “Now then, where were we?” “As much as I’d like to stay,” Harry swallowed, “for the rest of—er—your instruction, I’m supposed to be leaving on vacation this afternoon.”
Draco realised that his barriers, the things that kept him in control and kept him grounded in medicine, had somehow been broken down. He’d never hesitated to run tests before, and he certainly had never felt

The sound of even an innocuous command from Potter’s lips stirs Draco’s blood. For a moment he panics until he remembers how flushed his cheeks already are from the heat. He’s relieved but also mortified that Potter’s words caused such a reaction. Merlin, the slightest commanding tone from the man and Draco’s a blushing, aroused mess. Though, in all honesty, it’s really anything from Potter these days, and he’s turned to a blushing, aroused mess.
“Do you know what this does to a person’s muscles?” Draco shouted. “Do you know what it can do to their brain?”
He changed the subject to the review of their patient’s chart and the Post-Op check-in they needed to complete. Once he stepped into the patient’s room and started the assessment, a switch turned on inside him and the disquiet within fell away. Draco was able to go about his job with ease, his mind clear of any and all distractions.
“They—” he began to ask, but when Weasley and Granger turned around to look at him, Draco’s eyes fell to the patient behind them.
Draco leaned forward and met Potter’s eyes.
When their mouths crashed together, all Harry could think about was the glorious sensation of finally knowing what Malfoy’s lips tasted like. It was frantic and warm and both their tongues pushed into each other’s mouths with searing need. Harry didn’t register that Malfoy’s hands had lifted his robes up until a hand shoved his pants down and careful fingers started stroking his throbbing cock.
He can feel Potter smile against his thigh just as the hand lets his cock fall back against his belly. It feels like ages before Potter’s tongue presses against the base of Draco’s cock and licks up the underside of the shaft.
“It’s not so bad,” Potter laughs, but Draco hears the tick. It’s fake, like half the laughs Potter offers the dull and useless worshipers that try to get his attention.
“You’re delusional,” Draco waves his hand at Potter. It’s the other man’s last ditch effort to defend Oliver Wood’s Arrows with some obscure fact. “But I’d expect nothing less from you.”
Draco used the Aurors’ emergency spell to give his owl haste.
The memory of Potter standing in his kitchen sent a rush of adrenaline through him, and Draco bolted up and out of his office toward Potter’s room. Nothing had changed in his absence and he offered up his silent thanks that he didn’t have to talk to Potter just yet. He wasn’t sure what he would say. As his Healer, he only had questions. As his—as a person with their history and shared relations, he couldn’t put into words what he wanted to express: bitterness, jealousy, frustration, desire, obsession,
“Is he
Blaise rolls his eyes. “Draco, you are one of the smartest people I know. How is it that you can’t comprehend this? How can you not see how much he wants you?”
“Don’t stop, Draco,” Potter breathes.
Standing up straight, Draco focused his attention back on the assessment. “You know, they say Healers have to cultivate a good bedside manner, but no one ever discusses how completely rude and abhorrent patients can be.”
Harry unbuttoned his uniform robes and settled in on the barstool. It was a Friday evening and the Leaky was packed. Harry had stayed late at work rewriting his last six reports for H.U.M.P. and by the time he and Ron made it to the pub, their usual booth was taken. Harry adjusted his position on the barstool and sighed into his pint. “It’s Malfoy’s stupid lips—I mean his smirk. I see him every time I go to write my expenditure reports!”
” and led her silvery magpie Patronus around the room, relishing in the spectacle of the feathered spell pulling Dark shadows of magic from the walls and ceiling. Spinnet was right behind her firing banishing spells, containment orifices, and advanced charms in quick succession, obliterating even the smallest wisp of darkness in the room. At one point, they stood back to back, turning this way and that, attacking any and all errant shadows of Dark magic with precision. He’d never seen two Curse-Breakers more in sync, anticipating each other and the threats in equal measure.
Greg leaned forward and smiled at Draco. “How is the hospital, by the way?” Draco offered him a smile, thankful for the subject change. “It’s going well,” he said in a raised voice so it carried over the music. “As well as can be expected, what with it being
Potter pauses in the middle of uncorking the bottle. He nods.
“You know we can help you with the Manor,” Pansy said. “I work with Theo and Alicia in Curse-breaking and half the time we’re called out to help with people like you.”
“Draco, you feel so good,” he says, and Draco thinks his eyes have gone totally black with desire. “Let me make you feel good.”
“That was two years ago!” Harry shouts.
“What else can we do to help?” Weasley leans in.
“I can’t believe you’re my Healer.”
“This is inappropriate,” he finally managed to say.
“Clearly,” Blaise crosses his arms, “He’s gone for you as well judging by the fact that despite all your oblivious rejections of his quite obvious advances, he keeps trying. I knew Gryffindors were stubborn but I can’t believe he hasn’t given up by now.  I mean fuck Draco, he must be getting desperate, he had Ron throw him into an enchanted lake just to have an excuse to be alone with you.”
“What kind are they?” Draco peers down at the bowl of dough.
“No chance,” Pansy replied. “Wireless One is repeating that Viktor Krum interview.” The mention of Krum catapulted the two women into a fervent discussion of Eastern European accents which resulted in them both attempting to mimic noteworthy individuals’ voices.
Pansy pursed her lips. “She said you had, and I quote,
the order.”
His heart instantly dropped as he pictured his cousin Teddy with any number of potential injuries.
It had almost been three months since Draco’s first day as Healer-in-Charge of the Trauma Ward. He would love to say that it had been easy, that all his years of hard work and sacrifice had given way to a smooth transition into the elevated position. But it had been hell. He would never say those words aloud, knowing full well things could always get worse. However, he could admit that around every corner, if there was something that could go awry, chances are it did.
“I’m sure he’s there somewhere.”
When they got back to the booth, Theo had vacated his spot on top of the unnamed man and was sitting on his own having an animated conversation with Pansy. Draco considered Theo for a moment, idly allowing himself to wonder if the rumours he’d heard a few years back were true. Was he still working with Lucius? Were they close? Was his father in Britain? He suddenly had so many questions and he didn’t particularly like the curiosity springing up inside him.
“You said you needed something in the chart redacted?” Draco offered.
“What?” Draco feigned surprise. He glanced down at the chart. “This says you’re Father Christmas!” He turned to the intern who’d been watching the both of them with wide eyes. “Get me this man’s actual chart.”
Draco held the gaze for longer than was comfortable and sighed. He grabbed the wineglass and slowly emptied the bottle into it, his mind full of all the various ways to savour and explore those things which are complex and worth understanding.
The night passes in hushed confessions and tentative touches that turn into loud moans and the rough press of their bodies together. At one point, Draco presses his fingers against Harry’s chest, remembering how cold and pale his skin had been the day he fell in the lake. He’s flushed and panting as Draco jerks him off and holds him down. When his eyes glance up and meet Harry’s, he can’t help the words that tumble out of his mouth.
“Yes,” Blaise drawled, “wouldn’t want them to judge him, now would we?”
“Let me do a quick assessment,” Draco offered and stepped to Potter’s left. He cast the spell and examined the area around the lung that he’d drained and repaired. Everything appeared to be doing well, and that fact somewhat startled him. “It’s looking good,” he said slowly. “Too good.”
Potter’s icy fingers wrap around his own.
Potter let out a long breath. “I didn’t say that.”
Draco didn’t consider the looks, or the whispers, or the different ways it might prove harmful for him to return to the United Kingdom. He thought of his mother’s smile when they’d step through the double doors into the Manor and all that could be made right — perfect — if given the chance. Somewhere buried within him, he chanced a small hope, one that he’d never dared to acknowledge before the letter, that perhaps one day he might mend his fractured soul. Through his service, and dedication, and perfection, maybe he could find his redemption.
Draco follows. “Before? Before what?”
Draco kept his gaze glued to the counter. “How was dinner?” he managed to ask.
“What do you mean?” Draco blinks.
walk into that store.”
Draco scoffed. “Pansy!”
“Suit yourself.”
“Well, just last week,” Pansy explained. “Alicia and I were getting treated for a Snivelling Hex and the paperwork to get back into the field was longer than the N.E.W.T.s!”
Patil smiled into her drink. “That’s a
“Okay,” Potter said and rolled his eyes.
Draco’s mouth drops and his gaze falls to the table. He’s sure his heart is about to leap out of his chest. He’s trying to come up with a reply, anything, something, maybe a taunt about Harry’s eyesight, but his mind and body and soul seem to be at odds deciding what the proper reply should be.
The night before, he’d run his fingers over the embroidery on his robes. He laid them out, pristine and perfect, just like him. He had never had any doubts about becoming a healer. His mother had always told him he had all the token traits of a good one — a great one — and the profession would suit him. He soon found that his cunning, his stubbornness and his determination pushed him past the ranks of his peers. When he was faced with a problem, with something to fix, Draco wouldn’t stop until it was perfect.
He tossed his bag on a nearby bench and headed toward her voice. “Had a long surgery,” he said as he entered the kitchen and smelled bacon. His mother was standing over the stove in an apron, still in her pyjamas. It was still a pleasant shock to see her so domestic, as the memories he retained from childhood clashed with the image before him. He approached her and smiled, leaning down to leave a soft kiss on her cheek. “I left after my Post-Op check-in.”
Harry hasn’t the slightest clue that Draco has catalogued every shade of green cascading through his emerald irises; he has no real notion that Draco spends hours and sometimes days sketching and painting images of Harry. He has no idea that Draco started doing such things in service of a malicious therapy; that his implacable resolve to once again even the score with Harry Potter inevitably resulted in the illumination and enumeration of the darker parts of his heart. In his quest to depict Harry Potter on the canvas, to show him truly as he was, Draco discovered his capacity for kindness, mercy, and to his utter shock, his own twisted version of heroism.
“You’ll be the death of me,” Draco says as he clutches the hem of his knitted jumper and stares down at Potter.
“Stroll?” Draco cries. He eyes Potter as he wipes his mouth with a napkin.
After spending most of his week finishing up the Auror Department’s yearly expenditure report, Harry had planned on taking a long weekend to the south coast. Alone. His latest gift from Hermione, the bestselling page-turner
Harry stared at his tidy desk.
Surely, he can leave him alone for a few moments? Draco rises and makes for the hallway, intent on a change of clothes. He doesn’t wait another moment and pulls the jumper over his head, relishing in the relief as his bare skin breathes in the open air of the cabin. He takes one more glance at Potter asleep on the sofa and then heads down the hall.
“So?” Draco grabbed his glass of wine and took a long sip.
“I haven’t the faintest,” Draco drawled.
It’s a flurry of thank yous and the gathering of his cloak and his messenger bag and Draco rushes to get to the Floo and avoids meeting Harry’s eyes. But Harry is there every step of the way, an annoyingly attentive and charming host — is there a limit to things that man is good at? — to Draco’s utter dismay.
Harry’s mouth watered as he stared into bright grey eyes. He licked his lips. “Yeah. Sure.”
The entire process was over before Draco could pick his jaw up off the floor. “Phew,” Pansy exhaled. She wiped her brow. “Thought that last one might get through.”
“What is it?”
Draco scoffs. “I haven’t been waiting for anything, Blaise. You don’t wait for something you know is never going to happen.”
The next few weeks are exhausting as Draco adjusts to the rather unfortunate increase in contact with the man that he tries to tell himself isn’t actually that attractive. He reminds himself that it’s all business, a simple transaction and a favour to
Draco paused as he raised his wand to cast a Neural Cerebrus Assessment. While it wasn’t even remotely as definitive as some of the more invasive Mind Healer techniques, it would breach Potter’s mind and hopefully shed light on what was going on. Draco stood there, suddenly filled with guilt. He knew it was necessary to get feedback on Potter’s brain activity, but it was also so thorough that it would provide Draco with insight into what Potter might be feeling emotionally, if anything at all. For a moment, Draco doubted himself as he considered the charm and how it might violate the modest amount of trust that Potter had afforded him. Which was ridiculous. Why did he care?
“Nancy?”
Harry laughed. “I don’t know what to say.” He paused and then went back over Draco’s words in his head, trying not to think about the honest admission at the end of the list. “Wait,” Harry tilted his head, “Can you explain the Oxford comma to me?”
see a pair of green eyes every time he dared close his own.
“Potter,” Draco gasps and rushes to the door.
“Why are you doing this?”
“I’m sorry, but I can’t accept this.” Malfoy picked up the file between his thumb and index finger as if it were somehow tainted and dropped it on the counter in front of Harry.
They take over and start transferring the plates outside.
“Spinnet.”
Between walking in on and Finnigan sucking Thomas off in the kitchen one morning, to seeing Potter bake brownies and make love to the batter spatula with his tongue, Draco’s cast at least six disillusionment spells on his crotch. He’s starting to think the spells are contributing to his arousal as he wanks in the shower to thoughts of Potter’s tongue licking the underside of his cock.
“Compromise, Blaise.”
“No problem, sir,” the clerk sighed. “Just the third time he’s changed it this week,” he added under his breath.
“This is helpful,” Draco said, suddenly certain that morphine had been the unidentified compound. “I think we found what we needed.” He took one of the vials and put the other two back on the table.
He paced back and for twenty minutes before inevitably packing a satchel and apparating to the French Ministry’s Portkey offices. He knew Harry would never come, so he’d have to go after him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re awake,” Draco raises a brow. He takes a few more steps forward and stands next to an oversized armchair.
Harry heard the door open and felt the box lower to the floor.
“In the middle of an open field? What is this, Monty Python?”
You’ve never been more relieved in your entire life.
“You have five minutes to get ready,” Granger smiles and walks back into the great room.
“How nineties,” she frowned and Apparated away.
Later, when he was alone with Pansy, he’d told her how amazing she had been.
“Let’s just find what we came for and get back to the hospital,” Draco offered.
“Hmm,” Draco shook his head as he digested the information and scans. “This is a closed, non-displaced oblique fracture of your right tibia shaft. There is no neurovascular compromise.” He paused.
Draco heard Potter snort behind them on the couch.
“It’s what I do,” he shrugged.
,” he added. “Enjoy the rest of the wine. I have an early shift in the morning. Please excuse me.”
Potter laughs. “It’s been a slow progression since we were fourteen years old!”
When he pulls the quill back to admire his work, it brushes across his lips in a feathery light touch. He closes his eyes at the sensation and revels in the tease of it. A gasp sounds from across the room. Draco’s eyes snap open. Potter is staring at him from the other side of the counter, his face flushed.
Draco continued to lightly pat his leg with the gauze. “I see a lot of patients who come in with crazy injuries and stay conscious for most of the treatment, you know, if surgery isn’t required.” Draco sat back on his heels. “Enough of them were saying
Finnigan raises a brow and glances at Potter. “Are you now…”
Draco’s fingers find their way to his flies which he unzips as fast as he can. Potter steps back as Draco drops his trousers, kicking out of them eager to return to Potter's embrace.
It was Granger. “A
Draco knew exactly who Potter thought he was—he was—he—
The office secretary smiled. “Robards had them reassigned to clear up your afternoon.”
He wandered behind a tall, ancient-looking room divider and left Draco alone. He stood there for what seemed like ages before his boredom got the better of him and he turned around to observe the rest of the shoppe. On the surface, not much had changed in the eleven years since he’d been there, although he did notice the distinct absence of the darker, more brutal and occult objects that had been the trademark that distinguished the shoppe from several others further down the alley. That’s when he saw them.
Draco dismissed the intern and closed the chart, letting his arms fall to his sides. He fixed Potter with a serious look and tried to seem as considerate and neutral as possible. “What seems to be the issue?”
“You don’t think this would take away from the character of the room?” Harry asks, holding up a pale grey sample to the wall.
“It should feel warm, but not painful,” Draco explained.
Draco opens his eyes and levels him with a challenging stare. “And what is it that I always do?”
“An eyelash, I think.”
“What are you doing?” Draco asks, stepping into the snow.
“Minority opinion, that,” Theo butted in and winked.
“I love you, too.”
In his third week, a potions accident in a private lab brought eight badly burned individuals into his ward, three of which he lost on the operating table. And despite having ample experience dealing with similar cases in Paris, seeing the charred skin, smelling the burning flesh, and recognising the look of pained terror on the victims’ faces never got any easier. No matter how much he tried to compartmentalise, he inevitably saw Vince reflected in each and every one of the burn victims he treated. When he couldn't save them all, it crushed him on both a personal and professional level.
His mother set the pitcher down and approached him. “What is it?” He stayed silent and she grabbed his face. “Tell me.”
While Patil offered her company and council at St Mungo’s, Pansy and Blaise forcefully reinserted themselves into Draco’s life by showing up at the Manor unannounced several times a week. They stayed for tea, or for supper, or even to help clear the gardens of matured mandrakes with Narcissa on a balmy July afternoon. Sometimes when Draco was at the hospital, his friends would Floo over and entertain his mother with their news and antics.
“Wait,” Draco stops and tries to remember the room where he’d found the bag. He had already searched Ginny Weasley’s room, he recognised her broom next to the door. “That’s your bag?”
, and the other half is begging Draco to be rational about how much Potter may have had to drink, or how much it might hurt him seeing everyone else paired off for the majority of the trip. Or tripled off, if you’re Blaise.
“They knew I was in good hands,” Potter smiles. “Is that the third Phaeden Blanchfarx? I love that one.”
“You like that?” Potter says.
“What’s this?” Blaise asked. “It’s addressed to you. To both of you.” There were footsteps and then silence. Finally Blaise said, “What’s wrong? Aren’t you going to open it?”
for doing what was necessary to serve the interests of the patient. He’d never cared about their feelings. He cared about solving their problems—about saving their lives.
“Draco?” Pansy called.
Harry exhaled slowly. “Inappropriate…?”
and the warmth of it gave him the strength to stand up and walk out. Less than ten minutes later, she met him outside the door and handed him a takeaway bag.
and making preparations to start at St Mungo’s, you may imagine how it slipped my mind to owl you.”
“Fuck, that’s hot,” Potter breathes. “Fuck.”
He would rise to any challenge and he would do it with perfect and unparalleled ability.
Draco eyes Finnigan with suspicion, cautious not react. “Serving spoon,” he answers and turns to Weasley. “Plates, utensils...for those civilised enough to use them.”
You can’t even stop the stupid grin that takes over your face when you agree with Granger.
and to his utter dismay,
But what truly surprises him is the ease and flow of their dinner conversation. They talk about Harry’s current caseload, the state of things at the various Quidditch clubs, the news of new shops and old ones around Diagon and Hogsmeade and — a subject they both share most passionately — Teddy’s preparations for school.
Draco made it back to his office and collapsed behind his desk. He rarely felt the need to dose himself with stimulant elixirs, but Potter’s emotions had sunk into him. He’d had no idea they would be so powerful, and he could only guess how long their residual effects would last. Draco didn’t think he could shake them easily, and as it was the final hours of his double rotation, his own exhaustion was imminent. He unlocked the bottom drawer of his desk and pulled out a lemon flavoured
Draco groaned. “Harry and I are not classic! We are a singular coupling not seen this side of a thousand years.” Blaise braced himself for a repeat of the incident at the tailors. “We ordered a cake that will match our level. Something extraordinary, heavenly, enchanting—”
“I just wanted to ask—did you and Harry get in an argument?”
He raised the crystal to his lips and paused, ever so slightly shaking his head to inhale the intoxicating scent of black currants, blueberries, and fresh violets. He closed his eyes and pictured the white villa and the stone paths, the orchards and the vines, and the bright sun kissing his skin. He took a sip and let it christen him, full-bodied and powerful, yet elegant, enough to be cherished and enjoyed—enough to satisfy him in this single moment. He lowered the glass from his lips and opened his eyes.
“Draco, you are the biggest sodding git I’ve ever known. The man was just on his knees for you.”
to Draco Malfoy unless he wanted them to.
“Once I’m settled,” Draco said, “we can find someone to come in and take care of the rest of the restoration.”
Thomas snorts. “As opposed to regular Wizard’s Chess?”
As Blaise turned, Draco pushed him out the front door and slammed it shut.
“Sure.”
“Not sure what else we could’ve done,” Draco frowns. “Our hands were tied with the charmed water.”
Draco dressed himself quickly, throwing on a faded blue t-shirt and a pair of old jeans before grabbing his medical supply bag. He rushed to the Floo and didn’t look back, shouting his aunt’s address and stepping into the flames.
Potter nods. He leans forward and grabs the other cup of tea on the table and hands it to Draco. Their fingers touch and Draco almost drops the cup. “Oh,” he quickly throws his other hand forward to hold the bottom and accidentally caresses Potter’s wrist.
,” the medic frowned. “He was hit with
Harry looked for any trace of him but found nothing. Perhaps he’d stepped out.
Potter watched Draco cross his legs and frowned. “I’m here,” he stated flatly.
By four in the morning, the energy elixir Draco had taken was wearing off and his exhaustion began showing itself in the form of sore muscles, aching feet, and an unidentifiable weight of anxiety in his chest. His rotation was scheduled to end in two hours but he couldn’t leave until he’d at least put a treatment plan in place for Potter. He welcomed the scenario where he could leave without having to speak with him.
“We feel it’s necessary to block out at least a few days a month for you to concentrate on your department’s administrative affairs,” one of the board members had stated. “And perhaps give yourself a few days with lighter workloads.”
Draco knew how to live with his demons.
“All the time,” Harry explains. “Every time, actually.”
Blaise stares at the closed door. “This is the moment you’ve been waiting for.”
“Surprise!” he shouted as he pushed through the trap door on the top tier. Covered in pink icing and white cake, Harry stood in front of Draco and sighed. “I didn’t know what to get you for your birthday,” he said. “So I got you this.” He glanced across the room at the unopened box containing the first cake. He pointed. “And that.”
Unrolling the scroll, Draco scowled at Blaise’s reply.
Potter launches into a defense of his friends, which leads to his passionate support for Ron’s Quidditch prowess. Draco practically dies inside when they start arguing about the Appleby Arrows’ last season, and while Potter knows his Quidditch statistics, he can’t analyze them for all the money in his Gringotts vault. His gift was always raw ability on the field and a talent for putting together a good team and motivating them, never strategy and analysis of the other teams' weaknesses. Maybe that was the difference between the Gryffindor and Slytherin approaches to the game.
the bloodwork comes through.”
Luna stares at him, and Draco has to look three separate times to make sure his Disillusionment charm had worked, not that he’s the least bit hard after Luna’s questions and Blaise’s glares. The conversation dwindles, and Draco’s thankful to get back to the cabin where he can throw himself into his room and hide from everyone. He takes a nap and emerges ready for a glass of wine and some lunch.
He concentrated on finishing the reports, eyeing his packed bags in the corner of his office. He had no idea what he would do with no itinerary or plans for four whole days, but as the minutes passed, he found himself getting more and more excited at the thought.
“They already think we’re fucking.”
“I think I would have liked Beater.”
“So?” Blaise asked.
Draco paused as an odd feeling crept its way into his chest. He pushed the feeling aside and pointed to Potter. “Before you go to bed, you need to ice your shoulder and take an anti-inflammatory potion.” He shook his head, and kept pushing whatever was twisting inside him away, adding, “And don’t ever come here expecting medical treatment again.”
“Draco?”
Draco sighed and looked over Blaise’s shoulder. “They’re leaving without you!”
“Draco,” Narcissa called to him from the hallway.
Theo pressed a hand to his chest and pushed him against the back of the booth. “Shut up,” he scolded. “
He couldn’t remember the last time he’d applied a Trimming Charm. He thoughtlessly raised his right hand and ran his fingers through the soft hair before reaching for the green ribbon at the nape of his neck and pulling it loose.
Find me on
Draco realised.
“Holy fuck,” Draco almost screams at the contact. Potter’s cock brushes against his own aching erection, and he’s suddenly desperate for more. For anything. For everything. He clings to Potter’s shoulders and grinds his crotch down again, bathing in the vibrations against his chest as Potter stops kissing his scars to let out a long, deep moan.
The dancing continues as the songs change. People mingle and talk, and Draco ends up watching from his seat, appreciating the happy sounds of laughter and love. He’s only had a handful of moments like this since the end of the war, and he wants to catalogue and savor it.
“I’ll say,” Harry agrees. He reaches for the bottle of wine and pours himself another glass. “I remember when I saw you at that first Battle of Hogwarts Remembrance feast. I barely recognised you.”
Spinnet put her hand up and tried to catch her breath. “Nothing was getting through our wards,” she managed. After a few deep breaths, she turned to Draco. “And thank you.”
“Quidditch accident,” he replied. He couldn’t tell her it had been an England National Team player, due to Healer-Patient confidentiality, or that he wasn’t certain if they’d ever regain complete function of their legs again. He just assured her, “They should make it through just fine.”
Draco fumbled for the pallet in his pocket and set it on the ground with care before charming it back to its normal size. He pulled the invoice from his pocket and got the signature from the clerk.
It wasn’t as if he hadn’t been expecting it—his mother seeing Lucius. The man was the love of her life. Draco could never fault her for wanting to go to him. He’d suspected she likely had on a few occasions when parts of her stories hadn’t matched up over the years. Just like him, Narcissa had been through Hell and back. She could and should do whatever she wanted, and he knew she would as long as it didn’t hurt Draco.
“Yes,
Draco immediately recognised the desperation behind them. He’d seen it that night at Borgin and Burkes. The moment he made the connection, Potter’s head jerked to the doorway and his face shifted to something completely neutral. “Mrs Malfoy,” he smiled.
“Are you sure it’s for Harry? I mean, it’s
On the other side, a shift in magic leaves Draco feeling electric. The forest is more vibrant, charged with something beautiful and simultaneously terrifying. Draco can feel it in his blood: Fae.
“Healer Grisham retired two weeks ago.” There was a heavy sigh and then, “So who operated on me?”
Draco held up a large green bottle with small script engraved down the side that had caught his attention. He needed someone else to confirm that it was in fact what he thought it was. “Do you know what this is?” he said through gritted teeth. He read the inscription aloud. “
“You’ll be rehanging these around the home?” Draco asks, a hint of surprise in his tone as he casts a glance at some of the undignified medieval depictions of Muggles.
Draco quickly sobered up at the realisation that the man had reset his shoulder on the first try, which rarely happened unless it had been dislocated before.
“I wish they’d given you more time,” his mother had said over Sunday afternoon tea. “Monday is so soon. And you will be working those long shifts. I’ll hardly see you.” She pursed her lips and glanced away, her eyes drifting toward the East Wing. “There are things I would rather not…”
Draco felt as if he needed to ask permission before he could begin searching for substances and drugs amongst Potter’s things. He glanced around, unsure of where he would even begin.
“You owe me.”
Draco paused and asked for suction before resuming his mending spells. “Why is that?”
It may have started from a place of malice, but the more Draco painted, the more he understood the other man. And that’s when understanding turned to something a bit more inconvenient.
He opens the doors to everyone else’s rooms in turn and mutters, “Accio Pepper up!” In the second to last bedroom, someone’s bag finally flaps open, and a small bundle of toiletries flies into Draco’s outstretched hand.
Blaise cleared his throat. “That’s a really big box.”
Potter smiles. “Why don’t you come with us and make sure that I don’t?”
Harry wasn’t sure exactly how much time had passed before he heard voices coming from the hallway.
“Another cake?” Blaise questioned.
“I wanted you to fix my shoulder,” Potter explained. “But since you’re unwilling, would you kindly move out of my way?”
Malfoy smirked. “The state of their clothes? Why, I’d never seen pirates wearing designer threads straight from this season’s runways in Milan.”
He carried the packages out by their strings and rushed to the designated Diagon Apparition point, his thoughts a tangled mess of anxiety and doubt. Had Potter really been there? Draco could’ve sworn he’d been standing not ten feet from him. If he
“Merlin,” Draco closes his eyes. He’d be daft to let this moment slip away. He takes a deep breath and stands up. He glances at himself in the mirror, runs a hand through his hair, and leaves his room before he can talk himself out of it.
Draco sits clutching his wine, trying not laugh as Weasley attempts to out boogie Thomas to the Weird Sisters.
Draco clenched his jaw, feeling the silent doubt and underlying concern that lingered behind Weasley’s question. Healers didn’t just go around prodding at people’s magic, and Draco hadn’t ordered the test lightly. He couldn’t decide if Weasley and Granger were generally unsettled because of the nature of the test or if they were suspicious because he had been the one to order it. Draco calmly collected himself and stated, “We won’t get that test back until morning.”
The most maddening thing about Harry Potter, Draco had found, wasn’t that he never combed his hair, or finished his own paperwork, or that he always rolled up his sleeves and left his robes hanging open. No, the worst thing about him was his unyielding compassion, his heart, his soul; the lengths to which he’d go for the ones that he loved, the depths that love could reach and consume him.
As the days flew by and Draco fell into a routine, he grew thankful for the events of his first day—that they’d thrown him and Patil together. She never became less abrasive, but she listened to him, she offered advice, and she trusted him with her own personal and professional confessions. And of course, there was the Spell Damage station coffee. When she brought him a cup from her ward, his day was made instantly better.
The request surprises Draco, but he nods and claims a spot in the armchair across from the couch. As he settles in and picks up where he’d left off earlier, and the room is filled with the sound of his voice and the crackling of the burning fire. Draco gets through four chapters before he looks up to find Potter asleep, the blanket a heap on the floor.
“Point,” Draco nods and quickly changes the subject. “Lunch, then?”
Draco stops and thinks about it.
“He was
“What—” Draco had started to say but suddenly the unnamed man sat forward and interrupted him.
“I believe the correct term is
It all felt familiar and yet still so unknown to him, but in a few short years, the togetherness became an intrinsic part of his happiness.
Potter noses Draco’s cock before he spits and puts a hand to it. “I want your cock in my mouth,” he whispers. “Is that alright?”
Potter—the patient—made it through the gruelling nine-hour surgery with no complications, and at least Draco had
“Still can’t quite get warm,” Potter explains.
He finished writing and threw his quill down on his desk. “The Auror Department’s yearly expenditures are of the utmost importance, Potter.” He licked his lips and eyed Harry from head to toe. “It is my duty to make sure you’ve thoroughly completed them to the letter of the law.”
Draco shakes his head. He grabs Potter’s spectacles, folding them neatly and placing them on the side table. He fingers the bottom of the jumper, takes a breath, and prepares himself. He pulls the grey jumper up and over Potter’s head and casts it aside.
Something happened to Malfoy when he rolled his chair up to the mic and carefully slid the earphones over his head; a sort of weight seemed to fall from his shoulders and give way to an odd gleam that shone in his eyes; when he leaned forward and said, “Hello citizens of Britain, it’s your favourite heroic duo,” his voice carried a deeper timbre that sent shockwaves up Harry’s spine. It also sent a few sizzling electric currents of arousal elsewhere as well.
“Merlin, is it this again? Draco, the season tickets were for you! This is probably for
Pansy scoffed. “He is
Draco stared at her. His eyes dropped to the embroidery on her scrubs.
back on the air. Not after what you said last time.”
“Sometimes,” Draco says, “it still feels like it was yesterday. But other days…” He stares at Harry. “It feels as if we were completely different people.”
“Yes, hello,” Draco said, eyeing him warily. He didn’t recognise him, not that he’d known anyone other than Mr Borgin. “I’m sorry, I don’t think we’ve met. I’m Draco Malfoy.”
“It’s fine,” Potter soothes, “It’s fine. I knew it was there on top. Look, I’ll take the Pepper-Up now.” He opens his eyes as Potter digs through the bag, pulling out a familiar red bottle which every witch and wizard intimately knows.
was the first show of paintings Draco did publicly.
Draco leans in and examines the painting. It was from his first public show all those years before, one of the more complicated scenes he’d done of a man placing a bowl on a countertop, not realising it will fall. Draco’s eyes fill with tears as he takes in the simple, elegant frame, as he traces his fingers over the gold plaque at the bottom.
Draco smiles, “Your favorite.”
“Don’t bother,” Harry mutters. He turns pushes past them and heads to his bedroom at the end of the hall.
Harry turns around. His face is a blank canvas — unreadable — and pale and empty.
He stopped mid-step and turned back to the mirror.

“Fuck,” he breathed.
on the Quidditch Pitch is innocent.”
When he reached the entrance to the shoppe, he didn’t even take a second look. He took a deep breath and pushed open the door.
what you said the other day.”
“It’s my job,” Draco insisted. “And it’s my duty to tell you that you most definitely
“Hnng,” Draco replies just as Potter begins massaging his balls. “Do whatever you want, Potter, just put your bloody mouth back on me.”
“Trust me,” he said. “It will light you up.”
“Weasley left,” Blaise says.
Instead, he looks away and takes a sip of tea.
“Is that what this is?” Draco puts his hands on Potter’s shoulders and pushes him away. “You think you have to shove my cock in your mouth as thanks for being a decent human being?”
hanging front and center in the main room. There’s a whole story to be told. I can’t just skip over the parts I don’t like.”
“What’s wrong?” Potter approaches him, concern shrouding his brow.
“Can’t believe you went to all this trouble,” Finnigan says as he eyes the kebabs and various other dishes.
“Hmmph,” Spinnet smiled at Pansy, quite pleased with herself for the reaction she’d gotten from Draco. “If it’s the Dark Lord’s handiwork, we’ll have to use a Patronus Deductio.”
He manages to get the joggers on after taking a moment to recite a few potions recipes in his head. He stays busy casting Warming Charms on throw blankets and couch cushions, then makes two cups of tea and puts a Stasis Charm on them should Potter wake. When Draco finally finishes tucking Potter in, he wipes his brow and realises he’s been sweating. Between the blazing fireplace and all the Warming Charms and Potter’s bloody girthy pleasure rod, Draco’s begun to overheat.
“Me?”
Draco blinks. “You had a lot riding on the chance that I was a Phaeden Blanchfarx fan. You’re lucky Blaise gave them to me for Christmas.”
Find me on
And now Blaise would never let him forget it.
“Classic,” the clerk smiled.
“Harry, it’s Luna,” sang a voice in his ears.
All through his internship in France, Draco surprised even himself with moments of clarity and resourcefulness. In the harrowing life or death situations in which mere seconds could change the course of someone’s life; when everyone else was stumbling, falling over the precipice of mystery, Draco would cross the threshold of clarity with a steady and practised hand.
“He hasn’t woken up?” Draco rushed forward and examined Potter’s appearance. He was wearing a baggy t-shirt and boxers and had scrapes and bruises all over the exposed skin of his arms and legs. Draco leaned down and lifted his eyelids, casting a
“Sickle for your thoughts?”
“Hmm, has he?”
Potter bursts out laughing.
. But it wasn’t the sort of desperation Draco had fantasised about, it was a heartbreaking silent agony, followed by the frank statement,
“Honestly, temperature charms are the first thing you learn.” He pushes Weasley out of the way. That’s when Draco sees that Potter has stolen a spot near the edge of grill, smiling at Finnigan and Weasley, he’s shaking his head. When his eyes meet Draco’s across the smoky scene, Potter slowly lifts a bottle of butterbeer to his lips and offers him a sultry look.
“I can take care of myself,” Draco replied. He pinched at the hem of his long-sleeve undershirt and then forced his hands in his lap. He knew exactly where Blaise’s mind had gone. His old friend was thinking of how Draco would be treated because of his past, his crimes, his family. “If St Mungo’s had a problem with me,” Draco said, “I wouldn’t have been offered the position in the first place. Rest assured, there isn’t a single thing I haven’t considered or anticipated.”
“I’m fine,” Draco replies. He tilts his head and decides to ask Potter how he knew about the veil. “It wasn’t in the brochure,” Draco adds.
He whirled around. “I just can’t believe they’ll let
Narcissa nodded as she sliced a loaf of bread and began buttering the sides before tossing them in the pan to crisp up.
“For fuck’s sake, if that pyre hadn’t already been on fire, his gaze alone would have set it ablaze. He was half hard all night sitting there staring at you.” Blaise steps close and lightly slaps Draco’s cheek. “Do us all a favor and give the man some relief, yeah?”
Weasley dropped his gaze and nodded. “Is he alright?”
“You resent it,” she said.
“We had something like this a few years ago over in Essex,” she explained. “Trust me, I
“Hmm?” Potter starts eating again. “Well, it’s what I meant to say.”
They bundle up and put their boots on, meeting Granger, Weasley, and Thomas in front of the cabin. Draco follows behind Thomas as the group wanders toward the densely forested area of the valley. The sun is bright and the glittery white snow reflects its brilliance all around them, illuminating the even shadier parts of the forest floor.
Draco rolls up his notes and shoves them in his briefcase. When he turns around, Potter’s come to his side of the counter with a look in his eyes that Draco would say is no longer mild satisfaction but heated desire.
is really my thing,” Draco said flatly.
Patil spit out her coffee. “Are you mad?”
“Fair point,” Malfoy nodded. “Thoughts Harry?”
Nodding his head, Draco steps forward and kisses him softly. “Yes,” he says, followed by a shaky, “Please.”
Narcissa Malfoy has always been a proud and protective wife and mother, but her view of herself seemed to expand after the war. She set an example for Draco in so many ways, but first and foremost in the acts of reconciliation and forgiveness. With the foundations of blood purity all but demolished, what remained was simply blood — family — and the memories that bound them all to each other.
“Oh, Draco,” Pansy sighed.
Blaise pushes Weasley aside. “We have to get him out of these wet clothes.” He bends over and unfastens Potter’s boots. “Draco?”
“Five days is plenty of time.” Pansy sipped her coffee.
Draco rolls his eyes. “I wouldn’t let you,” he says. “I like my life.”
“Luna,” Harry started. “Do you remember—”
So Draco painted them.
“Multiple curse blasts to the chest,” a Ministry medic shouted.
“Draco,” Blaise says with a warning tone as he notices Draco staying inside the carriage.
A moment later, the door to the office opened and someone gasped. “What the—”
Narcissa laughed. “You know the one. He hasn’t been around all week.”
“—to be so coiled with pleasure that the only thing you can bring yourself to scream—”
Potter sort of half smiles and focuses on the water between them. “That’s good.”
He clutched the note and threw open his bedroom doors, rushing to the foyer to find their eagle owl.
“Is that so?” Draco narrows his eyes.
He knows Blaise doesn’t need him, but Slytherins prefer a partner when in the presence of other houses. They can share secret, judgmental looks and revel in the sharp, stinging replies they throw at their companions. Draco wouldn’t want to miss any of Blaise’s witty retorts, but he suspects his friend tones down his cunning when in the company of a certain desirable Herbology Master. Draco begins to doubt Blaise even cares that he’s absent from the outing.
“We paid for all five,” Potter says, pouting his lower lip out.
“Draco!” Pansy’s hand shot out from the table, her napkin dangling between her fingers. “You’ll get stains on your scrubs before you even start.”
Blinking, Draco offered her a tentative smile and crossed the room to greet her. “Mother, I retrieved the jewellery boxes from the shoppe.” He stopped in front of her and leaned down to kiss her cheek. “I saw,” she smiled. “I wasn’t expecting you back so soon.” She eyed his casual attire. “You look quite handsome.”
Draco rolls onto his back and stares at the ceiling, desperate to hide the swell of emotions he’s feeling. It’s all so much at once, and at the same time, he’s convinced he’ll never get enough of it. He turns his head and looks at Harry. They share a tender moment as Harry’s hand comes up and rests on Draco’s thigh, stroking it lightly, lovingly, almost possessively.
Blaise interjected, “You’re
As Harry’s third partner since Goldstein had been murdered, Draco knew more than anyone how loose of a cannon Harry had become. That’s why he’d been on desk duty—why they had been benched—why Draco had moved to Paris to be closer to his mother and find work with a partner who didn’t make Draco simultaneously want to slap his stupid face and kiss his stupid lips at the same time.
Andromeda finally chimed in, “Your mother was in Hufflepuff, you know.”
“This way,” Potter trails his hand over Draco’s shoulder, stepping in front of him to lead the way. A few minutes later and they’re at the edge of a clearing where the veil between the Fae and the mortal world opens.
“Mmm?”
?” Draco snorted. “As if my wedding were a mere afternoon tea.
He hoped a few fingers of firewhisky and some peace and quiet would help relax him. It almost felt surreal to be alone in the Manor, sitting where his father used to sit, the more worn of two leather armchairs in front of a large marble fireplace. Draco had always imagined himself sitting in the armchair opposite, joining Lucius for a nightcap and discussing politics or trade news, and yet now, that entire scenario seemed unthinkable. Never in all his youth did he ever suspect he’d be where he was. Alone.
“I’m sorry, Head Auror Potter,” Malfoy shook his head, pursing his lips. Harry was
“I’ll only accept chocolate dipped strawberries fed to me as my Haider Ackermann silk robe falls open and champagne drips down my—”
Potter’s breath hitched. “You’ve barely looked at it.”
” Patil said with the barest hint of derision. “What is the surgical plan here?”
You can perhaps understand that my hands have been busy attempting to rid the place of the dark magic and curses left to fester for the last decade. I am neither prepared nor qualified to expunge or cast out such magic, and having spent the last five days there, I am uncertain if I even want to try.” He inhaled and continued, “I can hardly tell if it’s me that doesn’t want to live there or if it’s merely a conscious effort of the Manor pressing me to leave. Either way, between
The next morning he woke and didn’t revisit the previous day’s events again.
“It’s going to be alright,” the young mother offered the man. It was the fourth time she’d rushed her partner in for a finger reattachment. “They’re really good here.”
“It’s the perfect size for that space over the mantle in the upstairs sitting room,” Harry Potter said to Neville Longbottom as he approached the auction claims desk at the end of the event.
Draco had been so terrified of what might be said, he didn’t attend the gallery opening and hired an attendant. He mulled about and sulked, eyed the
Potter had been chewing on his lip, eyeing Draco’s hands. “What?” he said.
“Potter, what are you still doing up?”
“I suspect some of them are,” Draco nodded.
and actually mean it.
“Does that say what I think it says?” Blaise laughed.
In the instant between when Potter’s lips downturned into a frown and then formed his blunt question, Draco decided to take a page from Patil’s book. If they could be brutally honest, why couldn’t he?
He’d rented a small gallery in Diagon Alley and arranged the entire thing himself. It had been a testament to all his hard work doing figure sketches for months and agonising over the angular details and lines of his own hands. The paintings focused mostly on the various mistakes one can make with their hands: writing something and crossing it out, getting a parchment cut, not wearing protective gear near a hot cauldron, getting a splinter from an old broom. Draco had grappled with including his other paintings, settling on a few figure portraits, a vague interpretation of his own form doing ordinary, everyday things.
Potter rolled his eyes. “I don’t believe this…” he muttered under his breath while Draco sanitized and put on his personal pair of Medical Grade Dragonhide gloves. He opened a pack of gauze and started dampening it with the elixir. “This looks like a simple fracture, and because there is no neurovascular compromise, we can treat it conservatively.” He held up the gauze. “This will work as a numbing agent but also clean any cuts or scrapes,” Draco explained. “Do you consent to treatment?”
“Pupil dilation is normal.” He turned to Weasley. “Has he had any recent head trauma?”
Potter fixes his cup of tea and grabs the kettle. “They were obviously fucking.”
“Hmm,” Patil sipped her drink. “So, fuck anyone lately? You seem different.”
on himself and the table. A bit miffed, he returned his wand back to his pocket and said, “I’ve been sleeping much better since they helped me.”
“That explains a lot,” Potter mutters and takes a sip of tea.
“But they never go back to how things were before.” Harry stands up and heads into the kitchen.
“Hmm?” Draco focused on casting a Vitals Charm.
On the one hand, he was thankful for the time to himself. He’d had an exhausting three days at the hospital and was eager to unwind and attempt a good night’s rest. While Pansy and Alicia’s work had cleared his bedroom of the malevolence from without, there was no easy set of spells or rituals to remove the darkness from within. The last few days, Draco had been plagued with vivid nightmares. It didn’t matter if he was in his own bed or getting an hour’s nap in an on-call room; the vivid and alarming images were waiting for him each time he closed his eyes.
“Is he here
Draco snorted and waved his hand, taking a seat at the kitchen table. “So go to Mungo’s.”
He’d clutched the parchment so tightly it crumpled in his hands. He’d scarcely been able to breathe or stop the flood of tears that fell from his eyes.
Harry brought his pint to his mouth and thought of Malfoy’s perfect, plump lower lip. “This is definitely not like it was in school,” he said and gulped down half his beer.
“What?” She stared back at him expectantly.
Fourteen hours later, he gives up and throws a drop cloth over the canvas, beyond frustrated that he still can’t get the right colour of green to highlight Harry’s eyes. A few minutes later, an owl comes billowing in through his open studio window and he recognises it immediately as his mother’s eagle owl. He gives it a treat and snatches the letter. It’s an invitation to a final luncheon for Teddy before he leaves for Hogwarts.
He helped Potter up and offered him an arm as they made their way back to the house.
“Ergo...” Potter leans down and skirts his lips over the sensitive skin just below Draco’s jaw, right over his rapidly pounding pulse. The contact sends a surge of heat straight to Draco’s cock and he holds back a groan. When Potter lifts his head back up and meets Draco’s gaze, Draco can only make out a sliver of green around his pupils. Potter says, “I can’t think of a single reason we shouldn't be fucking. Can you?”
As Head Underwriter for Magical Pedantry for the last eight years, the man jumped at every opportunity to reject Harry’s reimbursement requests. It wasn’t as if Harry was lacking experience filing paperwork; he'd worked for the Ministry for over twenty years and been Head Auror for nine. But Malfoy’s office had a ridiculous policy for visits by appointment only and Harry had waited
Malfoy narrowed his pale grey eyes. “If by
Teddy smiled, “Just like my dad. Just like Harry.”
“Should I put it in his chart?”
Draco sighs. “Potter, it’s impolite to sneak up on people in the middle of a conversation.”
He arrived early, before seven, eager to settle in and get to work. The administrators set an introductory meeting for ten o’clock, giving Draco ample time to orient himself with the hospital. He walked the halls and spent his first few minutes at the main station in the Trauma Ward getting familiar with the current patients and procedures. Little differed from Notre Dame, with the exception of the Emergency Auror Receiving (E.A.R.) apparition point against the far wall of the waiting room. The French Aurors had their own hospital and team of Healers, but the Ministry used St Mungo’s for all its medical needs.
“And you wonder why I asked if it was poisoned…” Draco smirked.
“Not everything worth looking for is in a brochure,” Potter smiles back at him. “Sometimes...sometimes the things worth finding are buried in the rough.”
he had shared it with.
“Draco,” Potter’s head falls and rests on his chest. “You feel—”
“We found him thrashing around his room,” Weasley said. “He’s injured himself but he won’t wake up.”
Narcissa placed a hand on his back and Draco turned away from the touch.
“Since when—since when do you use words like
“These are very old,” he says as he examines the levels of dust and grime clinging to the surfaces. He can already safely assert that at least half of them were done before the Statute of Secrecy based on some daring depictions with Muggles and the various styles and strokes. A few have water damage, others spell damage, but with the exception of a charred tapestry, there isn’t anything Draco feels he can’t fix.
“Yes, well, allow me to dwell on the positives, alright?”
Malfoy leaned forward and licked a stripe up Harry’s neck and nibbled on his earlobe before whispering, “Can you blame me?” He was panting and moaning right along with Harry, and the sounds he was making were about to push Harry over the edge. “Potter, I’ve been hot for you for the past thirty years.”
He took another look at himself and shivered. He hadn’t felt this way—this
“What? Come on!”
“No?” Weasley said, his voice unsure. He stepped into the room and grabbed the bottle out of Draco’s hands and let what was left in the bottle swirl, revealing its contents to be a thick, silvery opalescent liquid. “Is that…?”
“There isn’t,” Draco says, eyes wide. “Is there…”
Ronald Weasley had thanked
He readied himself for bed and tossed and turned for hours before falling into a fitful, uneasy sleep where he searched and searched but never found the green eyes he was looking for.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You,” Draco breathes, unbelieving, “saw an eyelash from all the way over there?”
in it despite the Workplace Ethics and Training classes they’d been forced to attend after the last incident. Harry did not want to attend W.E.T. classes again, let alone with a man who took every opportunity to make innuendos throughout said mandatory classes.
Draco stood off to the side and watched them with interest. At first, it amused him to see Pansy interacting with Spinnet; he’d never anticipated the pair of them getting on so well. But after a few moments, the howling and the laughter made him ache for the days when he’d had friends like that, times when he’d laughed so hard tears streamed from his eyes, the days when someone would drop everything they were doing in an instant to come to him when he called.
Malfoy’s hands flew forward, one gripping the back of Harry’s neck and the other pushing his chin up. “Tell me you want me to kiss you. Tell me you want my lips on you. Tell me you want this.” Malfoy was practically panting. “Tell me, and it will be yours.”
