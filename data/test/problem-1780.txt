Naturally, this was all information that Hermione Granger was fully aware of. When she heard about Draco’s pregnancy during his second trimester in December 1999, she did what any self-respecting Healer would do and researched it. The only other person she had shared her findings with at the time had been her fellow Healer-in-training Luna Lovegood. Obstetrics and gynecology weren’t her intended specialty, but it was Luna’s; so at the time, it didn’t seem surprising that Luna wasn’t completely unaware about the information Hermione was so
Greg’s gaze traveled over the planes of Harry’s face, as if he could read the smaller man’s thoughts or know whether the seasoned Auror was telling the truth. Perhaps Greg could do those things. Harry had made the mistake of underestimating Draco’s friends before. A small smirk tugged at the larger man’s face before he nodded. Harry’s mouth dropped open when the man simply turned and made to move away. But then he stopped and tapped a hand against his leg, as though he were debating on saying something.
“Goodbye, Harry,” I whisper to you.
“I don’t want this place to turn into a tourist trap! Besides, I think they’ll see my name in association with the place and we’ll see even less people than before.”
“You have James and Al with Ginny, right?” Lavender asked, her voice giving nothing away. Harry nodded. “How is she?”
“She’s a good kid. Never met her, but I’ve heard all about her from Vic. From what I know, Draco did a good job raising her by himself. Or he got really lucky.” Charlie laughed at his own joke.
“It’s so good to finally meet you,” she said, her voice soft and a little unsure. Harry raised his brows, having expected the Malfoy kid to be as confident as the man had been when Harry had first met him.
“I’ve been asked that question a lot lately,” Harry laughed. Greg rolled his eyes and dropped his arms to his sides.
The third time had been completely intentional.
“Hey, little fella,” Harry greeted softly, dropping to his knees so he would be eye level with the boy. “It’s Vince, isn’t it?” The boy, thumb still in his mouth, nodded. Harry grinned. “My name is Harry. It’s very nice to meet you. You know, I used to go to school with your mum.” The boy’s already wide eyes somehow widened even further.
like, and was suddenly glad that they had a parent like Lavender. But then, Lavender
“Yes, alright, what can Auntie Pansy do for you?” she drawled. Teddy smiled, rubbing at the back of his neck in clear nervousness. Now that she thought about it, Pansy wasn’t sure she’d ever spent time alone with the boy. He was almost always accompanied by a blonde.
“You know how Lily is into that muggle musical theater?”
“Ready, mate?” he asked instead, and the redhead grinned, slinging an arm around the girl at his side. Hermione made a sound of exasperation, but Harry didn’t miss how she let herself be tucked into her boyfriend’s side.
“When did Kalokairi get dragons?” Harry asked.
“Yeah, I thought you knew?”
“Mr. Malfoy–”
“Oh, you are too much!” she said.
“Do you like them as shoes, or do you like them on Malfoy?” Parvati teased and Harry somehow just turned redder. The rest of the group burst out with laughter and giggles at his nonverbal reply. Perhaps they had all had quite a bit of drink that night.
“Your dad and Uncle Dray were two peas in a pod,” Harry told him. The boy leaned forward excitedly, pulling away from Draco’s arms. Harry glanced up, green eyes meeting gray and promptly blushed. Draco was gazing at him with such intensity, such
“–band in all its grown-up wrinkly glory!”
Luna Lovegood’s office was a small, cramped space tucked away on the seventh floor of St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. It contained a desk covered in medical files, scattered pieces of parchment that experiment data or new ideas had been scribbled onto, and a variety of eccentric paperweights with a solid oak chair that spun in circles and housed another pile of medical files and well creased books. Behind the desk and on either side of it stood four tall bookshelves that were crammed from floor to ceiling in books, crafts, and indoor plants. A few of the plants had begun to grow across the ceiling and in between the bookshelves, but their owner either didn’t mind or didn’t seem to notice. With Luna, one was never quite sure. Across from the desk was a small stone hearth and a wide, very comfortable, very well-worn armchair covered in a garish yellow and green plaid pattern. Next to it sat a small side table with two empty teacups and one full cup of rapidly cooling tea. The place gave Hermione Granger a small heart attack every time she visited, but Luna always felt quite cozy and right at home in the office she had occupied as an attending for the last eight years.
“Luna will be there too,” Hermione said with a nod and Harry smiled. He would always be fond of his eccentric friend.
“Tell me something about my dad.” Harry’s gaze snapped back to Lily. He thought of his gut feeling that Lily was hiding something when he first got here; that feeling only doubled now. And yet, Harry was far too pissed to address it. Instead, he couldn’t quite hide the dopey smile at the thought of Draco.
The little boy lay curled up beneath a pile of blankets and pillows, his breathing finally slow and coming out in soft puffs. His father stood in the doorway, leaning against the frame, and smiling softly at his son’s sleeping form. It had been difficult getting the boy to go down tonight. They could hear the music from the taverna through the open window, blowing in with a gentle summer breeze. Vince had been vibrating with excitement,
Before she could respond and question his intentions with her father, however, a long loud horn sounded across the ocean. Everyone looked up as the Kalokairi ferry zoomed over the waves, moving quickly in their direction. Harry and Lily stood up so they could join the queue with the rest of the waiting cast.
“Dare,” Malfoy said immediately, when Parkinson had turned towards him. Her responding smile was absolutely feral, and Malfoy flushed a light shade of pink. Harry wondered if he was going to change his mind, but Malfoy just lifted his chin higher.
“I don’t need your money, Pans. We get by just fine, thank you very much. Besides, Lily has this idea for putting us on the why fly interweb.”
“I’m sorry, I’ve been busy,” Lily squeaked, unable to speak properly with her face smushed against Victoire, but her arms snuck around the curvy blonde anyway and she hugged her friend back tightly.
“Ronald? Honey, are you home?” Hermione called as she floo’d into their living room. Ron, bless him, stepped into the doorway, a dish towel over his shoulder, and a large grin on his face.
The crowd of young women went wild, Teddy’s very recognizable, very deep voice rising loud above them, and music began to play from the speakers. It sounded familiar, but Harry was somehow on his third drink and couldn’t quite place it. Before he could even start to, three figures marched from backstage and Harry was torn between laughter and having his breath stolen away.
,” Malfoy groaned again, his hips arching up off the bed as he scrambled for purchase at the sudden envelope of heat around his hardened length.
They turned a corner into a small ballroom and Lavender came to an abrupt halt, throwing her arm across Harry’s chest to make him halt beside her. He opened his mouth to ask why they had stopped, but then his gaze caught the couch midway across the hall and the words died on his lips. Lying down across the couch, silhouette brightened considerably with the glow of sunlight streaming through a window, was the same blonde Harry had been thinking about all day.
“Getting over…?” he asked carefully, but Lily just shook her head, turning her gaze to the ground.
“Good morning, Auntie Daph,” Lily greeted with a smile, and then waved to Vic beside her. “You remember Vic.”
“Why haven’t you been back until now?”
And because luck was never on Draco’s side and of course Benny would always have terrible timing, a very familiar mop of black hair popped up in the window opposite the door. Walking in Draco’s direction.
“Fuck!” He ignored the heated glares of passing parents and elderly. The boat was pulling out, he had missed it. He threw his duffel to the ground with an angry sigh. “Fuckity fuck fuck FUCK!”
“The fuck?” a voice from the room broke through Draco’s struggle with the bird, reminding him who he was hiding in the closet from in the first place.
Even though the girls had only spent a handful of days growing up together, playing whenever Lily was in England and Uncle Ron was responsible for everyone, no one had really expected them to bond quite like this. But then they started Hogwarts together and even though they were in different houses – Lily in Hufflepuff and Victoire in Slytherin – they were assigned a number of class projects together their first couple of years. By the time they were thirteen, they were practically inseparable. They had even taken to spending school breaks together a majority of the time. Even though their parents had made their peace more than a decade before, it had still been rather awkward for them at first. Lily and Victoire wouldn’t say their parents were exactly friends, even after all this time, but Lily’s father had put them on the guest list before she had. It was a moment she had celebrated over with Victoire.
“How are you? How’s the room?”
“You don’t want children?” Charlie’s grin faltered a little as he looked at her face, as he looked at the freckles speckled across her nose that reminded him so much of his mother.
“Well, no…”
“Oh no, not him. Parkinson already told Greg about him.”
The second time had been on a dare.
“You’re pathetic, Potter,” Draco hissed.
“Yes. Well, this one had been in Romania for almost eighty years. She was old. But she was my first dragon. I got attached. When she died, I was…I was devastated. Getting over her was the hardest thing I ever had to do.”
“It’s been twenty years. Yeah, we’re doing this.”
“If I was, would you be receptive to it?” Charlie just grinned. “Well anyway, Daphne would kill me if I was.”
- - -
“Then who, Lavender? I don’t have time for your games.”
“Do what?” Luna’s smile brightened.
He continued to mouth his way up the inside of Malfoy’s leg, lowering himself down between Malfoy’s legs. With one leg hooked over his shoulder and the other spreading out, Harry leaned his head down and pressed a kiss to the head of Malfoy’s prick. Malfoy moaned and arched his hips up. Harry smiled and then swallowed the blonde down.
“I’ve, uh, well, I’ve got

No happy endings yet. I couldn't help myself! But next chapter, there will be much much more.
Five years together and no matter how much we had changed, no matter how much we had grown, we were still so unhappy together. Our love was a desperate affair. I think we held on so long because we were both afraid to let go, both afraid to admit that love just wasn’t enough.
His relationship with Theo had been complicated over the years. The pair had ended their on-again/off-again relationship at the end of eighth year, but Draco had grown up with Theo. He couldn’t exactly keep him from his life completely, especially not when Pansy and Blaise were still close to the raven-haired man. There had been periods where the two kept in touch regularly and Draco made a point of seeing him whenever he visited London – however few and far between that had been over the years – but eventually, usually when Theo was seeing someone, their correspondence would fall off again until the next time Draco went to London and ran into him at one of Pansy’s little soirées.
Please leave kudos and comments and tell me what you think!!
You threw your head back and laughed at something he said. You looked as light as you did when we first ran into each other in that cafe five years ago. And my heart shattered all over again.
“Does Alex know?” Victoire asked carefully and Lily’s face flushed a bright pink.
forget any of his time with the blonde.
“And the sun protection potions. And our hats and sunglasses are in the backpacks.”
I also pulled some lines directly from the musical Mamma Mia! so if you recognized them, you aren't crazy. I hope you liked this as much as I enjoyed writing it. Onto the next chapter to finish it ASAP for you! Thank you again for bearing with me.
“Nico, you can’t just let her–” Charlie began, pulling his wand out, but Nico tightened his grip on Charlie’s other arm and cut him off.
“Ah, but I’ll be seeing you Friday and you called me. So what is it that I can help you with?”
“Based on my research, I think it highly likely, yes.” Hermione looked down at her lap and it was then that Luna noticed she was fiddling with a letter in her hands. She leaned forward and held it out.
“Parts of it?” Lily breathed, her eyes widening and her face paling. Vic almost winced when Lily grasped her hand under the table and squeezed. Almost.
“Is it?” They all four exchanged a look.
“What does he do?” Harry asked, eager to refocus on the conversation.
Harry laughed, pushing himself to his feet and dusting himself off. When he looked up, Draco was leaning against the doorway with his arms crossed and an almost fond smile on his face. It lasted only a moment before Draco remembered who they were and where they were. Then the blonde straightened up, pushed Harry back another step, and stepped out into the hallway. The door fell closed and then they were standing in the empty hallway alone.
“How do you always do that?”
Draco froze in the doorway, his hands just settling on his towel cart. He glanced back into the room at the Gryffindor. Harry stood in the same spot; he hadn’t moved from it even once. He stared back, his green eyes piercing as he raised one hand in a small wave farewell.
“Wonderful, that’s wonderful,” Draco said, his voice tight as he clenched his hands into fists at his side. He could feel his heart trying to pound its way out of his rib cage, could feel the bile begin to rise in his throat. “Will, uh, will Mrs. Potter be joining us?” Harry’s mouth dropped open.
“I know, I’m sorry,” she said. “I haven’t been able to get away what with Dad and the wedding.”
“You can have all of it,” I say and your eyes widen. Your gorgeous, glowing, green eyes. The eyes I swore could always see right through me.
“Right. Egor. Are they still together then?” Greg whirled around, his eyes narrowing and his hands curling into fists as his side. Draco hadn’t been with anyone in over a year, but the Slytherin in front of him didn’t need to know that.
The man waiting for them at the building’s exit was one Charlie knew well. He was shorter than Charlie, though that wasn’t saying much considering he had inherited the Weasley height, and he was very stocky. The man’s skin was dark from his time in the sun with matching dark features and a lot of dark hair. The man’s beefy arms were coated with coarse hair and his long, thick curls were pulled into a messy bun on top of his head. Age hadn’t really touched this man, save for the crinkles around his eyes and the smile lines around his lips. Charlie grinned and waved at his older friend, but the man’s attention was firmly on the blonde hurrying her way over to him.
~ ~ ~
“I’m sorry, it’s just to hear that you married that…that…that
Harry pulled out the two bottles of lager and opened them, passing one to Charlie. He sat down on the bench closest to the steering loft, picking slowly at the black label on the bottle.
“You must have; I saw the invitation.” Draco tried to recall the guest list, but it was difficult to remember every one of the two hundred and seventy-four envelopes he and Lily had painstakingly addressed by hand. Figures his kid would want such a large wedding. With another groan, he dropped his face back into the pillow and vowed to smother himself right then.
“Has it really been that long?”
Lily froze. Nico kept moving, Daphne close behind and beginning to ask questions about the Skrill. Only Charlie seemed to notice she wasn’t keeping up with them anymore. He stopped and turned back, looking at her in sympathy.
“You’re not supposed to be here,” she giggled against his lips, and Alex’s grin just grew.
An empty stage at the opposite side of the taverna suddenly lit up, followed by a booming voice from the speakers.
Taking a deep breath, Harry resolved himself. He was a bloody Gryffindor for Helga’s sake! Squaring his shoulders back, Harry stopped directly in front of the door and lifted his arm to knock. And then the door flew open, hitting him in the chest and sending him toppling to the floor.
“It is my office,” she said in what she thought was an agreeable tone, but Hermione’s eyes just narrowed. Luna sighed and dropped the pile of files in her arms onto her desk before dropping into the creaking seat behind it. “I’m very glad you’re here. Did you get my note on the patient in five forty-three B then? It’s a most curious case. I haven’t seen a purple rash like that since–”
“Are you telling me that if one of your parents was out there somewhere that you would ever stop trying to find them?”
“She’s not yours,” Draco said quickly. Charlie’s eyes narrowed just a touch and he crossed his arms as he studied Draco’s face. It was impassive as ever. Finally, he sighed and dropped his arms by his side.
“I’m aware of what an idiot I’ve been. But as stupid as I am, I wasn’t the right person for her. Now I am. Vic’s the love of my life. It’s always been her. And whether you see it or not, I’m ready to give her the world. I’m going to ask her to marry me and prove that I can be the man she deserves every day for the rest of my life.” With every word, Teddy straightened his back, his chin tilting up. If Pansy were being totally honest with herself, his declarations reminded her quite a bit of her second husband.
“What on earth are you wearing?” she snickered, and Draco looked down with a frown. His trainers were a little worse for wear and one sleeve of his jean overalls had fallen off, showing the smudges of soil and grass stains on his white undershirt. Twenty years ago, he would have been horrified by his appearance. Twenty years ago, he also wouldn’t have ever dreamed of working with his hands instead of his magic on such a regular basis either.
Harry opened his mouth to speak, to try to fill that silence, to beg for another chance, but the sudden clearing of a throat interrupted them. The pair turned to see Greg carefully watching them both, arms crossed over his broad chest and a single brow raised in silent question.
“Draco, wait!” Harry called out, running after him. Draco either didn’t hear him or didn’t listen, but as he was suddenly picking up the pace Harry thought it was the latter. “Can’t we talk?”
“You have not been here in too long, little flower,” Nico said softly, offering her a small smile. “Last summer, we acquired another young male. Ladon. He and Gina are expecting.”
“Circe’s tits, Draco!”
“You obviously don’t know Dad, then,” she laughed and Harry tried to ignore his heart sinking, his smile faltering at that.
“And why should I believe you?” Pansy asked. Teddy sighed and looked out over the water.
“Who’s coming in today?” Harry asked. The blonde turned to smile at him and his heart lurched. She looked so much like Draco, especially when she smiled, and every time Harry thought about all the years he had missed with his favorite blonde.
He took a long, slow drink and then slammed the glass onto his desk. He felt suddenly tired, like he’d been in the field for days despite having not been for years. He sighed and pushed the heels of his hands into his eyes. This was not the first time he was hearing about Malfoy’s daughter. How could he have missed it after years of hearing about Teddy’s favorite cousin? After hearing about how she all but threw Victoire into Teddy’s arms? But this was different. He’d never even met the girl, let alone seen Malfoy in nearly twenty years, and now the blonde from his youth was inviting him to her wedding?
Draco lay on his back, his arms held straight up in the air so he could hold open a book and read it to the small figure curled up in on his chest. Between his arms, lying on his side completely on top of Draco, was a chubby little boy with a mess of brown curls hiding his face from view. All Harry could tell was that the little boy was sucking his thumb with one hand, clutching a worn out stuffed bunny with the other, and listening intently as Draco animatedly told him the story of a little boy who wanted to be a mermaid and his abuela taking him to a festival all dressed up. Draco seemed entirely comfortable, like this was a regular occurrence. Based on the fond, affectionate expression Lavender was looking at them with, Harry supposed it was.
Harry laughed. It just sounded so adorable. He wondered if Draco felt the same way or if the Slytherin was as overprotective as Harry always imagined him to be. He wished he had been there to see it, wondered if he would have had to talk his snake down from anxiety. He swallowed back a sudden lump in his throat, suddenly wondering if Draco had had someone else to talk him through it.
“Teddy and Vic were with her.”
He stood a small distance from his goddaughter and her two best friends, standing with his arms crossed and silently watching her twirl his son about. Greg had always been the silent type – was
“Yes, we share a birthday actually. She was a little late, so I was just
“I don't know. Did you watch those memories before you invited him?”
“Is he out there then?” Daphne called and Draco turned to frown at his friend.
is quiet now, that they’re all looking at me. I finally look at you.
. He released the breath he was holding and grinned at her.
to say.” Draco tried to clear the sudden lump from his throat. “The idiot left and we’ve both moved on and that’s that. Now drop it.” Draco abruptly sat up, dropping his feet to the ground so he could properly glare at each of his friends. They exchanged a look he couldn’t quite decipher, but seemed to silently agree to drop it.

“Not here,” Draco whispered. Harry’s knees almost buckled. The blonde’s voice held such promise. He reached out and grabbed the pale man’s wrist, turning and tugging him along as they navigated the empty halls.

with the man, but there wasn’t really anything right about him either. That was the problem. Nott never felt strongly about anything or even took a stance on something. Greg might have been dead wrong about all his beliefs before the war, but at least he hadn’t been just vague enough about the whole thing to survive no matter who won. It somehow felt worse at times. He had actual things to repent for and mistakes he could never make up for, would always be marked for. But people like Nott would go on, their inaction unnoticed forever, even if their silence made them just as complicit in the face of oppression.
“Charlie, are you going to see the dragons while you’re here?” Vic changed the subject before Harry could keep talking or before Lily could blurt out what Vic was
Confident someone of age would look after Vince, Greg turned to greet the men unloading his kitchen’s food. The cool sea breeze blew over him as he mechanically worked through the order, taking quick inventory and delivering quick instructions before sloppily scribbling his name at the bottom of the page.
to understand, Lupin.”
“I was walking by and saw you.” Draco didn’t have to see it to know Harry was shrugging. His chest tightened further, and a tear escaped. Or maybe he was wrong; he didn’t know this man.
“Nico!” Lily cried with delight, throwing her arms around the man’s neck. He laughed and hugged her tight.
The fourth time was completely intentional too. And the fifth. And the sixth.
(See the end of the chapter for
Lily was short, much shorter than her father and grandmother and shorter than both of her best friends, though she had the lean Malfoy frame. There were some days where folks would tell her she looked just like her father and other days they were surprised to hear her last name. She was almost as blonde as him, though her hair was more golden in color and was a long, thick, mess of curls, a stark contrast to her father’s thin, easy to style hair. And while everyone in the Malfoy line seemed to have some shade of gray eyes, hers were spectacularly green. She was okay with this because she felt it made her and Victoire look almost like sisters. The taller, curvier girl had the same shade of golden blonde - a magical combination she said she had gotten from her mother’s white blonde hair and father’s red. Victoire’s eyes were a brilliant sea blue, not quite the same green, but the matching brightness coupled with the endless freckles speckling their faces always convinced strangers they could be sisters. Her father used to change the subject whenever she brought it up. Looking down at the box in her arms, she thought she might know why.
“Lily, I’m only going to ask this once, so I need you to be honest with me, ok?” Lily nodded. “Are you trying to Mamma Mia your way into finding out who your other dad is?” Lily bit her lip and looked down.
“I just thought it might be a nice surprise,” Lily continued, and Harry looked at her as though she had grown two more heads.
“I’m sorry to drag you away,” Lily said, her voice a little hoarse. She was swaying a bit and Harry wasn’t sure if it was from the music or drink.
!?” Harry froze, his hands hovering above the basket and his mouth hanging open as he gazed on at the most unexpected woman he ever expected to see on the island.
inviting Theo.”
“We both know you’re not here on vacation. So either you’re here just to assuage your guilt so you can die in peace or you’ve finally decided to man the fuck up. Which is it then?” Harry opened his mouth and Greg leveled him with a grave stare. “No jokes, Potter.”
“So fix it,” he said, and began to head towards his room. A strong grip on his shoulder pulled him back and spun him around. The ragged scars were redder than before.
“Then who else? Theo? I know he’s coming too.”
“The room is perfect. I can’t believe what you’ve done with the place, Dray…Aunt Adrianne would be so proud. Of all of it.”
“But Charlie’s not leaving until Sunday,” she said, her voice wobbling a little and chest tightening. She knew Charlie’s invitation was real, but that didn’t stop this from hurting.
“Come on,” Charlie said, slinging an arm around Lily’s shoulders and starting to guide her back towards her party. “Let’s get back.”
“Okay,” Lily finally managed to get out, Vic rubbing her back soothingly.
“You have a kid?” Harry breathed in awe. He tried to picture what that kid might look like, what that kid would
“Have you got any children, Charlie?”
“Do you know them?” Harry asked. Vic turned to look at him and narrowed her eyes. He seemed so…
that she is,” Draco said.
“Harry! Funny seeing you here,” Lavender beamed, her smile wide as she gathered up the rest of the flowers and shoved them into her basket. Harry stood with her, still staring on in shock as she paid the vendor patiently waiting for them.
Malfoy was all lean muscle, but Harry was still stronger. He tucked one arm beneath the blonde and using the other one to brace himself on the bed, scooped Malfoy up against him and propelled them both further up the bed. Malfoy moaned into his mouth and bit down on Harry’s lip. Harry laughed softly into the kiss and then pulled back.
So, steeling himself for the possibility of actually having to talk to his roommate in almost a week, Harry gently pushed open the door and immediately froze. It was clear that Malfoy hadn’t heard or seen him, his back still turned towards Harry. Malfoy was standing between his desk and his bed in his pajamas, not that that was an unusual sight despite it being the middle of the day. What
“This is why I’m here,” Charlie said from the back.
“It is for Lily.” Greg glared. “And for me.” Greg grunted again and turned away.
“I heard you really like my heels,” Malfoy drawled, dipping his head so that his lips grazed Harry’s ever so slightly. “What about them is it that you like, Potter?”
Harry paced back and forth in the empty hallway, not quite sure what he was waiting for. For all he knew, Draco would stay with Lily for the rest of the night. His only options were to knock on the door and force his way in to the love of his life and their daughter – and fuck if that wasn’t a weird thought – or go back to his room and pace there all night long instead. He wondered if this was something that happened to Lily a lot or if Draco was as panicked as he was. And if Draco was panicked, then surely he should be in there comforting the other man, right? Right.
“Well, what has your dad said?” Charlie finally turned to look at her, at the young woman full of hope and fear and yearning.
“Hey! Hey there!” he called out, coming to a halt on the edge of the dock. The man in the steering loft stuck his head out and the man on the dock’s mouth dropped open. “Charlie?”
“Actually, Aunt Daph, Lily’s going to see the dragons with Uncle Charlie today,” Vic piped up.
“She’s a great kid,” Harry said softly. “You did a good job with her, Draco.”
“You mean, I know how you got Lily into that muggle musical theater,” Greg corrected with a wide grin. Draco rolled his eyes.
“Are you just going to stand there and look pretty all morning?” Draco asked, his attention still on his work. Charlie startled, unaware the younger man had noticed him. Draco finally looked back at him when he didn’t respond, a sly smile gracing his face. “You can come closer, you know. I don’t bite…anymore.” Charlie laughed, his arms falling to his sides as he straightened up.
Put back together as though nothing had ever happened, Draco straightened his back and spun around, leaving before Harry could figure out how to make him stay. Again.
“You’re a love, Lavender.” She grinned at him.
Draco cursed his absolutely terrible decision a moment later when footsteps told him Harry was walking into that room. He heard his old classmate mumble something about the door being open before a distinctly familiar voice called out, “Hello?” Draco, as smart as he ever was, kept totally quiet.
The boy was small for his age, and not close to being as broad as Goyle had always been, but he was chubby. His hair was a mop of curly brown hair, rather than blonde, and his eyes were as brown and bright as Lavender’s. The boy had the same round face, the same rosy complexion, and the same open expression on his face. He was definitely Lavender’s little boy– Vince, Harry remembered– but the way his weight was set and the shy, reserved manner was all Goyle. It was a rather good combination, Harry thought.
Harry had no idea Malfoy would be so vocal in bed, but
“Is who out there?” Draco asked, sticking his chin out and narrowing his eyes. Daphne just rolled her eyes.
“No. She…just read it.” The letter sailed to Luna with a wave of Hermione’s hand, settling down in front of Luna on her pile of folders. “I just want to be sure about Lily before I do anything.” Luna pursed her lips in thought as she read, before finally looking up at her friend.
“Should we tell him?” Greg finally asked the question they were all thinking, but the expressions turned on him told him they weren’t quite sure how this fit into their plan. Yet.
“Yeah. She lives on the island. She’s married to Greg.”
“Give it up for Draco aaaaand theeeee Dynamooooos!”
What really caught Harry’s attention this time around, however, was that Malfoy’s face had been made up. Harry didn’t know much about makeup, but he knew the slightly bronze shade over Malfoy’s cheekbones and jawline had been done intentionally to make his face appear even more sculpted than it usually did. His lips had been painted a shade darker than his heels and the magenta eyeshadow matched his painted nails. His lashes were darker and looked longer due to the presence of mascara, and his eyes were lined in a smooth black that winged ever so slightly at the edges. The pink complemented Malfoy’s pale skin and artfully tousled white-blonde hair perfectly. He looked absolutely gorgeous, Harry thought.
“Do I always have to do everything?” she mumbled, grousing about Hufflepuffs as she made her way back towards the hotel. Teddy just bounced along behind her.
“Chiquitita, tell me what’s wrong,” a loud caw cut through the chatter of the kitchen before Draco could say a word and they all looked up to the African gray perched comfortably on a tall kitchen shelf.
“Merlin, Harry, yes,” Malfoy moaned against his lips. “Please, Harry, more. Don’t stop. Harry. Harry.
“Why are you here?” he whispered.
“Do you care about nothing else?” Draco mumbled. Harry’s brow furrowed as he squeezed Draco’s waist.
“Charlie isn’t from Romania, he lives in Romania,” Draco corrected, finally forcing himself to sit up on the couch. Pansy dropped into the seat beside him, wrapping a long thin arm around his shoulders as she did so. “And no way could Lily pull off a scheme like Mamma Mia. She’s a Hufflepuff.”
“You’ve been to Kalokairi then?” Lily asked and Harry turned to look at the curly blonde. He could feel his heart leap every time he looked at her. The similarities between her and Draco were striking. Especially when she was looking at him like
“Greg.”
“Don’t, Ted.” Teddy gaped. She hadn’t shorthanded his name like that in ages. His gaze softened and his grip tightened instead. She was feeling vulnerable and he didn’t want to let her go.
“Yes, well, we hardly see you on the island,” Draco scoffed in return, swatting at Oliver’s fretting hands. The man was like a mother hen and sometimes, Draco had no idea how his old teammate had ended up with his quidditch rival, but they all knew Draco’s soft spot for the Gryffindor was endless.
“You,” Harry blurted. Draco froze. Harry took a step forward, pressing in until Draco was trapped between him and the door. He watched Draco’s Adam apple bob as the blonde swallowed, watched as a bead of sweat rolled down the taller man’s pale expanse of throat. Harry could feel himself sway, wondering how upset Draco would be if he just licked it off.
“Nothing!” she squeaked, but Alex’s eyes just narrowed even more.
“I don’t know.” Charlie didn’t know why he was playing dumb, but he was still trying to wrap his mind around it. This was
“Because you really have no idea or because you know your desires are outweighing reality?” Lily looked up then to glare at her.
Harry chanced a glance over at his temporary drinking buddies. Charlie and Nott were both looking on in awe, distant looks on both their faces as though they too were wrapped in nostalgia. Harry felt his stomach clench and tried to push the feelings of jealousy down. He didn’t know their recent history with the blonde; he just knew he didn’t have any right to feel this way about it. But he did. He swallowed down the lump in his throat and turned back to the stage.
“Oh? Any that I know of?” Theo laughed.
“I don’t know. It’s been a while since they’ve talked.”
“Yeah, there are three.”
"Potter’s here.”
“Alex, do you remember how I wanted to find my other father?” Lily finally asked, a little tentative. Alex barely heard her over the music, but he just bent his head down and held her tighter.
Greg’s eyes narrowed and his jaw clenched. He couldn’t help it; he had never really liked Theodore Nott. There was nothing specifically
“Isn’t she…you know?”
Harry could hear the unasked,
“I need your help.” Pansy barked out a sharp laugh and closed her eye again. But when still the shadow didn’t leave, she realized the boy was actually serious. With a sigh, she opened both eyes and reached for her sunglasses, sliding them on with another dramatic sigh.
“No, I mean why did you come back to Kalokairi?”
All the music mentioned in this chapter belongs to ABBA. In order the songs are:
“And a stiff drink,” Pansy concurred.
“I had to go back at the time, I wasn’t ready to stay.” Draco scoffed and looked back again, able to glare this time. So, they were really doing this.
“She is?” Charlie wondered aloud.
I couldn’t help myself. This chapter was done and gone over by waywardstoner. No promises that the rest will come as quickly, but I am already working on chapter 3 and I’m in quarantine for the first time ever so. We’ll see!
“Lils, who are you leaning towards?” Vic asked and Lily immediately looked down, picking at her muffin.
“I guess we’re all crumbling a little in our old age, eh?” More laughter followed.
. Skrill weren’t known to mate for life like some other dragon species, but Gina and Geronimo had never known anyone else. Lily didn’t realize how heated she was getting over the idea until Charlie gently placed a hand over hers. She turned to look up at him with a questioning expression, but he wasn’t looking her way. He was gazing further into the cave.
“James and Al are so jealous that I’m here with you,” Harry told him before pulling back from the hug and pulling Victoire into one. The blonde sighed in annoyance and rolled her eyes at him, but she hugged him back anyways.  “Are your parents here yet, Vic?”
“It’s definitely Theo.”
“I mean, three different men fucked me right around the same time and the healer could never quite pin down a conception date, so I have absolutely no idea who Lily’s father really is.”
He paused at the door again. There wasn’t any music coming from inside, but light was spilling out from under the door, so he knew Malfoy was still awake. His heart was already beating faster, his stomach already fluttering as he tried to tamp down the nerves. He didn’t know
bad, after all. Really, she was just disappointed she’d most likely have to reheat her tea again.
“You in here, Malfoy?”
“Thank you. That means a lot. Really.” They stood then, staring at each other in silence. Finally, Theo cleared his throat and turned away, moving to unpack the rest of his suitcase.
“Well, what do you know?” Draco grumbled, his gaze firmly locked onto whatever table of people he had found.
“Yeah, but you didn’t start fucking him now, did you?” Harry started choking on his beer and Charlie looked at him a little too knowingly.
“Huh.”
The thought of his beautiful wife and the second bundle of joy they were expecting (and keeping secret until this whole wedding business was over and done with) made his heart expand even more. So lost in his own thoughts was he, that Greg belatedly noticed the boat docking and emptying. Vince’s piercing squeal of excitement – something Lavender
Harry never got over that weirdness. Ron hadn’t gone back to school with Harry and Hermione for their eighth year. He had taken up with George in his shop, so he had never quite become as friendly with Malfoy or the other Slytherins as his friends had. Ron had later taken to watching his niece Victoire for Bill on slow weekdays and because of Harry’s relationship with Andromeda after the war, he had ended up taking on Teddy at times too so that Andromeda could run errands or have time to herself. When Andromeda and Narcissa had begun to mend their fences almost a year after Harry had taken his NEWTs, and Malfoy’s daughter had started spending time with the grandmothers, Ron had ultimately ended up taking the little girl as well. After all, she was Teddy’s
Draco pulled his hair up into a messy bun as he walked, grumbling about how unappreciative Pansy was of the work he had been putting into the hotel in favor of discussing his fashion sense.
“Draco, guess who just checked in at the docks?”
“Dammit, Malfoy!” a voice from the distance cried out and Luna bit back her laughter. She did always love these children. And she had a feeling she knew why they were seeking her out. She did still talk to Harry. Very often, in fact. Almost as often as she spoke with Draco.
“Oh Merlin. Dad’s going to be pissed though.”
Lily sat beside her, humming happily away as she sipped on juice and nibbled at a muffin. Vic took the time to really look at her best friend. Their first class together had been Potions, and despite all the time Lily had spent being raised by
I sit facing the window. My lawyer is vicious, cunning. And yours is bold and unafraid. It’s fitting, really. The first meeting we were quiet to start. They had to call security by the end. And at the last meeting, you refused to budge on anything. So did I, so I can’t really begrudge you that. Security was ready though. My lawyer’s been preparing me for court ever since.
, did he love how responsive the blonde was. Malfoy bucked up against him and then suddenly he was coming, striping their stomachs and their chests white.
He began to press open mouthed kisses to Malfoy’s neck, tugging at the t-shirt Malfoy wore and pausing in his ministrations only to pull it off the blonde. Then Harry pressed their bare chests together and they both groaned at the feeling. Malfoy wrapped his arms around Harry’s shoulders again, pulling him back in for a kiss, and Harry obliged until they had to break away for air.
chapter 3: dragons
chapter 1: what’s the worst that could happen?
Very suddenly, a swarm of young men were filing in through doors and windows. The young women squealed in excitement. Lily jumped out from under Charlie’s arm (and what was that about, Draco wondered only fleetingly). With one last grin over her shoulder, she began to push her way through the crowd towards the only man perched high on someone’s shoulders. Alex wore a paper crown and directed his human steed towards Lily as he spotted her, his grin growing as wide as hers. Charlie felt his heart warm at the obvious love the two felt for each other. He barely had time to focus on it before hands were grabbing him again and pulling him into the throng of dancers. At least one of them was kind enough to press a drink into his hand. Even if it was a vibrant pink.
“It’s just, she always said she would only give the place to family…Lily, how old are you again?” Theo’s brow furrowed in thought.
“Potter, what are you doing here?” Draco said coolly, lifting his face so he could look down his nose at the boy – man, he corrected himself. Because fuck, of course the boy of his childhood was now the most spectacularly gorgeous man Draco had ever seen. Taller than the last time he had laid eyes on the scrawny boy, the man before him now stood with broad shoulders and lingering muscles down his arms and back. His stomach was perhaps not as flat as it had once been, but it just made him look comfortably fitted in his casual jeans and red t-shirt. His thick black hair was the same as it ever was, albeit long enough that some of the curls fell over his eyes and Draco had to hold himself back from reaching out and tucking it back. Damn it all to hell that he was still so pathetically besotted with the speccy git. And of course the bronze man’s glasses were now a stylish square frame that fit his face and covered the ever the same intense green stare.
“Two years ago. We waited until both of the boys were at Hogwarts before we separated.”
Harry had gotten over that weirdness years ago. Victoire had spent a little bit of time with the Malfoy girl when they were younger, but the pair had bonded quickly being in the same year at Hogwarts. Even if they had been in separate houses.
“I know I’m rushing things,” Theo continued undeterred, “but just tell me, does your dad know that I know?”
at him with the heat of a thousand suns.
“Are we getting rid of the Skrill?” Lily asked, turning to Nico with wide eyes as he climbed out of the Jeep. He looked up at her with a side smile.
“It’s not that easy, Daph,” Draco whispered as though reading her thoughts, his gaze finally seeming to land on one spot.
“Aunt Dromeda will be here, I think you know her,” Lily said and Harry bit back a laugh. He had practically lived with the woman all during wedding planning. She had been his escape, his sanity, and (what he thought was) covertly his source of information on Draco when she started corresponding with her sister for the first time in almost thirty years. “Vic’s folks are coming today and most of the wedding party and their family.” Here, Lily’s eyes lit up. “And Alex is coming in with his parents today.”
There’s a conference room on the thirty-seventh floor where we meet with the mediator and our lawyers and we fight over what goes to whom. This is our third and final meeting before it goes before a judge and I’m just
I think that about covers everything I wanted to say!
“I, uh, I was invited to the Malfoy-Wood wedding on Kalokairi,” Harry said, running a hand through his messy hair. “I kind of just missed the last boat.” Charlie threw his head back and laughed, the sun brightening his thick, shoulder-length hair.
“When did they stop talking?” Lily started to shrug again, but then paused with her shoulders halfway up, her brow furrowed in thought.
Every time I walk into this building, I feel like I’m drowning.
Malfoy was directly across from the door, leaning back against the desk with his arms across his chest and a smirk lighting up his face. He had removed his makeup and had changed into a pair of pajamas (a pair of short cotton shorts and a tight t-shirt), but he was still wearing heels. Except, they weren’t the same heels. They were a pair of black strappy stilettos, thin straps crisscrossing over the top of his foot and wrapping around his ankle. For a moment, Harry stopped breathing. Seriously, how many pairs of heels did his roommate own?
“End of September,” Harry said. He took a big sip of wine in the silence that followed. It was good, but he wished he had brought his whiskey.
Draco and Theo had always had an odd relationship. They weren’t regularly involved in each other’s lives, one or the other disappearing every now and again. Teddy had always assumed it was because of the distance, even if Draco had managed to keep in regular touch with Pansy, Daphne, and his grandmother. Now Teddy knew they had a different kind of history. He hummed in thought and then turned newly green eyes towards his cousin.
” Harry wasn’t sure he heard her right. Draco had no idea he was there?
“I already went,” Harry said roughly and forced himself to look away from Malfoy. “Truth or dare, ‘Moine?”
“You’re kidding.”
“Potter,” Draco breathed in surprise, Harry finally coming to a stop in front of them. He averted his gaze from surprised, curious grey ones in favor of looking at the boy who was shyly gazing back.
“I’m nineteen!” The math was quick and then Theo’s brown eyes widened, but before he could say another word Lily was being whisked off into the throng of dancers around them and someone was pulling on Theo’s arm and pulling him away.
“What?” Theo looked at Draco in puzzlement and the blonde wondered for the first time in forty years if perhaps, Theo didn’t understand him anymore.
Harry and Draco had originally come to the island on the suggestion of Theo, whose aunt and uncle ran the little hotel. It had been passed down that branch of the Nott family since its first opening in 1821. Adrianne Nott had been incredibly welcoming to the pair the moment they showed up at her door. Her Italian life partner Georgio had been unusually reserved, so Harry hadn’t really gotten to know the quiet man. But Adrianne was a bright presence, a warm mother figure to every single guest, and extremely hard to forget. She reminded him a lot of Molly.
“Dear Merlin, I’ve got it!” a voice boomed from beside her again. Lily whirled around, her eyes widening. “Talk about slow on the uptake. I’m your other father!”
The trio on stage began to sing together again,
“Fifteen years now.”
“What happened to Lily?” Greg asked, trying and failing to keep the concern out of his voice. It was all he could do not to rush out of the room right now.
“Geronimo, right. Lily told me last night. Is that all you’re here for then?” Charlie’s grin faltered.
“How could he not? It was all over the papers.”
Draco told Theo all about Lily’s milestones anyways, just in case. He sent a few pictures, wrote letters or flooed him when something major happened (like when he found out Lily was a
“They didn’t. There’s a conservation on an island nearby,” Charlie answered. Harry frowned.
“You work with Draco?”
“What?”
“Those are beautiful, Draco,” she breathed, clearly admiring the shoes while Harry was trying not to clearly admire Malfoy. “Are they Blackwood?”
what he was expecting when he came here.
“So are you regretting staying away so long?” Harry furrowed his brow and looked around.
“Speak for yourself!” Pansy’s voice was loud and clear this time; Daphne continued to ignore her.
“Morning, Uncle Harry,” Vic said with a grin, sliding over and patting the seat beside her.
~ ~ ~
“What?” It comes out as a whisper, a breathy thing like someone suddenly has you round the throat. Maybe I do.
“It’s always going to be him, isn’t it?” Nott grumbled, the irritation evident in his tone. Greg couldn’t help but laugh, reaching out and patting the thin man just a little too heartily on the back.
“I did not come here to discuss the patients, Luna,” Hermione interrupted harshly. Luna winced and looked down. She wasn’t quite ready to face the music. “I thought you were Harry’s friend.”
, Lily thought, wincing a little at the fact that the idea
“Ok, I can do that. I can send you something from me and my dad now. For the other dads, it might take me a bit; can we get them to you one at a time?”
“How did you end up here?” Harry broke the silence again. He couldn’t see Lavender’s expression from where he trailed behind her, but for a brief moment her shoulders tensed and then they seemed to relax as she straightened her stance. Harry was wondering why she was readying herself for a fight until–
24 September 2019
. Surely a conversation couldn’t be that hard?
He found the blonde in the courtyard with the best view of Kalokairi and the ocean beyond. He could feel the light hum of the magic opening the space beyond its initial means, could taste the smoky crackle of spells as chairs and decorations floated by him to their destination. In the center of it all stood Draco, tall and strong and as messy as the morning Charlie first met him all those years ago. His hair was piled on top of his head, his jean overalls falling off one shoulder and barely staying on the other. Watching the muscles in his arms and back ripple with his movement, it was hard not to remember that night and early morning back when they were young and far more flexible.
“Do you remember when I was your beard?” Pansy asked and Draco smirked. They had always been on the same page – it’s why she had made such a good beard those two years in the first place. Not that anyone close enough to the pair had believed it, but to everyone else... It gave her status at a time when no one knew who she was and it gave him a break from the older Slytherins ribbing him for being so uninterested in girls.
~ ~ ~
Then Harry sat up and looked down at the nearly naked man before him. There was nothing artful about Malfoy’s tousled hair anymore and his face was pink stained and open, his pupils blown wide as he gazed quietly up at Harry. He was breathing hard, his chest heaving and his abdomen quivering under Harry’s gaze. And then Harry’s eyes trailed down further, looking down at Malfoy’s long lean length curving upwards from a small patch of white-blonde curls. A pearl of pre-come beaded at the top of Malfoy’s pink head and Harry licked his lips again. Slowly, agonizingly, he wrapped one hand around Malfoy’s prick and give it a single firm stroke. Malfoy’s eyes fluttered closed and his head fell back as he let out a long, low moan.
“Why do you ask?” Harry replied.
“I still can’t believe what your dad has done with the place,” Theo said more to himself than to the curly blonde in front of him, his gaze still looking at the intricate trim over the stage.
Charlie leaned against the archway between the courtyard and the hotel itself, arms crossed as he admired the view and Draco’s spell work. The space was being set up for the reception, Charlie guessed. Tables surrounded an open wood floor, a small white marble fountain depicting Ariadne wading in the water and reaching skywards had been moved to a corner, and a platform just before the edge of the cliff boasted a powerful web of protection against falling off the cliff for the less sober guests. Sunflowers, zinnias, and snap dragons weaved their way around the arch he leaned against and across the top of awning that provided a covered space. Bouquets of the same flowers adorned each table, giving the bright Greek space a British autumn feel. It all seemed so quaint and cozy.
The heels were a beautiful cherry red (almost a Gryffindor red, really), a color that surprisingly complimented Malfoy’s pale skin. The slim heel on them was easily six inches, stretching Malfoy’s lithe frame even higher than Harry thought possible. A one-inch thick strap looped over Malfoy’s toes and connected over the top of his lean foot to another, more ribbon-like strap tied around Malfoy’s thin ankle into a bow at his heel.
Theo and Charlie were good companions. They were also the only other men in the place. It seemed the taverna had been taken over by Lily’s bachelorette party and the curly blonde stood several tables away, surrounded by friends. Harry actually recognized many of them from Hogwarts, a few of them girls Teddy had brought home in between his dating Victoire. Harry was surprised Teddy wasn’t allowed in, but the unfamiliar, purple-haired, nonbinary looking person pressed to Lily’s side made Harry briefly wonder if his godson hadn’t found a way in anyways. With a grin, he turned back to his conversation partners.
“How is he then?”
, but Harry was distracted by the black marble Dionysus spinning a matching Ariadne in his arms and the poem he knew lay on the other side. He felt his heart twist again, but even he knew it wasn’t for the end of his marriage.
“Why would she do that?”
. Adrianne had wrapped him tightly in her arms and made him promise to come back and stay again. He didn’t manage to fulfill that promise in her lifetime, something he regretted the day he read her obituary in a little Greek newsletter he specially ordered in London. Being reminded of that now made him feel that loss again, made him wonder what that loss must have been like for Draco and if the man had had anyone else to get through it. And before he could force his mind away from the blonde again, Harry wondered how many of the hotel’s changes had been Draco’s ideas.
“Don’t play stupid, Draco.”
The woman in front of him was clearly older than he remembered, but very much the same person he had gone to school with for six years. Her face was still round, her hips still wide, and her curly dirty blonde hair was pulled up into a high ponytail. The woman had more lines in her face, a hardness to her skin from time in the sun, a fierceness in her brown eyes that hadn’t been there at sixteen, and four ragged scars that ran from her temple down to the middle of her neck; but there was no mistaking Lavender Brown.
“Err…I don’t know.” Pansy scoffed and spun on her heel.
“What do you mean?”
~ ~ ~
The dragon fell forward onto all fours, its wings crackling with energy as they came around to cover its body. But then the dragon leaned its head forwards and breathed in deep. It opened its mouth and Charlie clutched his wand tighter, suddenly sure that Nico was wrong, but the dragon just let out a deep breath and suddenly the crackling stopped.
“Lily!” Teddy said with excitement, and then bounded over to pick his still favorite cousin up and spin her around in a hug. She laughed. When he set her down, she was immediately pulled into the arms of her other best friend.
“Did you finally talk to your dad then?” He felt Lily sigh against him.
Skrill were one of the most difficult dragons to keep in captivity. They were large, powerful dragons rivaled in force only by the Hungarian Horntail. Most people saw them as dangerous, protective dragons but Lily knew they were nervous, anxious creatures. They were hard to find; even harder to catch. Kefáli tou Drákou had only come by them fifteen years ago thanks to Nico, who had found a pair when one of them – Geronimo – was injured. Unable to continue on in the wild, Geronimo became a permanent fixture. And unable to continue on without her mate, Gina had come with him.
“I am a Healer, Hermione. I consulted on Draco’s pregnancy. I couldn’t say anything.”
“He looks so young.” The awe was audible.
“I like him,” Greg’s soft voice floated from nearby and Daphne looked up to see him approach with an armful of vegetables. He dropped them onto a nearby table, in front of one of his line cooks who immediately began to prep them, and then he approached his old classmates, wiping his hands on his apron.
Nico led the odd trio to his Jeep, where Lily climbed into the front with him and the pair chatted amiably as they drove along. Charlie turned to look at Daphne, just a tad curious about the woman who had interjected herself into their (rather impromptu) trip. Charlie had never heard much about the Greengrass girl, even when his youngest brother had gone to school with her, but she didn’t really seem like the dragon type.
The closet door swung open and Draco stumbled out, the bird twisting its way out of his grasp. Benny ruffled his feathers wide and bobbed his head at Draco with a particularly offended squawk before flying over to perch on the towel cart. Draco cleared his throat, straightened his
!” Vic cried, her mother’s accent slipping through with the French. Charlie laughed. “What am I, then?”
“Yes! Yes we absolutely do!” Lily shouted, pushing Victoire back aside and taking her spot in front of the fire again.
“Long night?” he sighed.
“She named him,” Nico said to no one in particular. Daphne, still fighting her panic, didn’t even seem to hear. Charlie’s brow rose as he turned his head to look at his old friend. Nico was looking at Lily and her dragon with nothing but fondness. “She was four. Her father had started taking her here not long before we got him and Gina. I am still not sure how to this day, but she managed to get away from the tour. We found her sitting wrapped up in Geronimo’s tail telling him a story. Her father fainted from the fear.” Nico laughed at his own story. Charlie grinned. “She kept calling the dragon Geronimo. And here we are. It is good that you brought her along today. That will make this so much easier. They are very attached to each other these many years now.”
“No, never. I’ve never even seen a dragon outside of the ones from that tournament fourth year, and only from a distance.”
“Other dads? Them? One at a time?”
Harry traced the underside of Malfoy’s prick with his tongue as he pulled his head back up, and just before the length popped out of his mouth completely, he hollowed his cheeks and dropped his head back down. Malfoy tangled his hands in Harry’s hair, and Harry let him guide the pace as he licked and sucked. He pulled his mouth off only for a moment to murmur a lubrication spell and then he was swallowing Malfoy back down as he gently traced Malfoy’s entrance with a slicked-up finger.
“So who are they then? When do they come? What can we do?” Teddy asked as they began to calm down. Lily looked at them both with such fondness.
Truthfully, even if it wasn’t his place, Greg could have forgiven him that. But the man’s lack of standing for anything extended to something much more personal. Greg was almost certain that Nott had at least suspected, if not downright knew, that he might be Lily’s other father. And yet, the man had taken Draco at his vague word, despite knowing the younger Slytherin better than anyone else. Nott hadn’t questioned it, hadn’t seemed to even think about it beyond that single conversation nineteen years ago. Greg couldn’t help feeling some type of way about that, even if no one else would.
“I don’t want any of it.” I shrug. Your face falls.
Malfoy was wearing a pair of fitted black slacks tonight, so the lean lines of his legs were still visible though not nearly as they had been that November afternoon. This time, however, Malfoy was sporting a pair of cerulean blue pumps. The heel was thinner, sharper almost, than the red pair had been, though still six inches tall. However, the rounded toe was platformed, so his foot wasn’t as arched as the last time Harry had seen him in heels. For a brief moment, Harry wondered just how many pairs of heels Malfoy owned.
“Door’s open, you know,” a voice called out just as he raised his hand to knock. Draco startled, then grinned and pushed the door open.
“I’m restocking towels,” Draco said, waving to the pile of towels that sat on the table beside the closet as though it were the most obvious thing in the world. He decidedly ignored the fact that he had come out of the closet hugging a bird. “I
“He’s been taking classes online in graphic design and computer science. He wants to design websites. He’s even making one for Dad! Business is really going to pick up here once he does.”
“Nothing. No reason. You know, it’s surprising to see you here after all this time. What brings you to Kalokairi?” Charlie’s grin grew at the slip.
she was hiding, what Vic and Teddy were helping her hide, but he was already here.
“Oh, I don’t think it’s really for me.”
Lily and Vince absolutely loved Nott, their Uncle Theo. Even Lavender found him charming. So Greg forced himself to relax and reminded himself to square off only a little bit when he strode forward to make sure the coward wouldn’t rub off on his son. Vince wasn’t going to be like Nott or even like his dad, if Greg could help it. Vince was his brave, beautiful mother and Greg would ensure the boy was nothing less.
“Hey! Everyone thought it was real,” Pansy sniffed. Draco snorted.
“–and he’s always talking about reconnecting with his old mates. It’s just, Dad’s done so much for me and I thought, ‘wouldn’t that be a wonderful surprise, for him to see you all at my wedding.’”
“Sorry, you just look so much like your father when you do that,” Harry finally explained, motioning to his eyebrow to demonstrate what he meant. Lily smiled wide, leaning forward eagerly.
The bickering couple turned their glares away from the other and onto the blonde staring them down with her hands on her hips. Teddy’s expression softened and even Victoire’s shoulders relaxed and she rolled her eyes.
“It’s never too late.” Charlie laughed with his head thrown back, his grin widening as he looked down again.
“I got an invitation too,” Charlie said with a shrug. He took his hand off the steering wheel to point towards a cooler nearby. “I have some Piraikis in the cooler. Pass me one.”
“You don’t know that! How could you know that? Look at it!” Daphne exclaimed, the panic evident in her voice. If Draco found out about this, he was going to
~ ~ ~
“Well, I’ve narrowed it down, anyway,” Lily corrected herself, reaching in and taking out the glass vials. She handed them over one at a time to Victoire, who frowned down at the labels. There were five in total.
“I found something,” Lily said before her friends could go on. Victoire raised a perfectly manicured brow at her. “I, uh, I think I know who my other dad is.”
“Freeze him?” Daphne asked, torn between confusion at the situation and amazement at the scene in front of her. With one last scratch of Geronimo’s head, Lily stood up and stepped back, looking at her godmother.
“From our year at Hogwarts. A Slytherin.”
you are talking about. He is an absolute love – has always been, even when I have no right to it – and he is the best father I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. You don’t know either of us enough to say a word about it so I will mind you to kindly keep your insults to yourself.”
it’s Charlie.”
I would like to deeply deeply apologize over and over again for taking so so long to update. I promise I haven't abandoned this story. I'm only just officially divorced as of last week. It's been a long road and I've been too sad and heartbroken to write anything happy. I'm aiming to finish the last couple of chapters and have this all done up soon for you though! Thank you for bearing with me. As penance, please accept a ridiculously long chapter with the smut you've all been waiting for.
“Patients are allowed to bring someone they are comfortable with to appointments.” Hermione glared at Luna. She couldn’t help it. But the blonde just stared firmly back, her hands folded in front of her on the desk.
“I haven’t had a lot of time off,” Harry lied, shrugging. Lily scoffed.
“Well, you have sons, don’t you? Albus and James, right? They’re still at Hogwarts.” Harry looked at her in surprise.
Harry was so busy forcing thoughts of his kids to the forefront of his mind that he stopped focusing on where he was going. He was present enough to evade any significant accidents, twisting around Greek and foreign visitors alike, until his luck finally ran out. His shoulder collided painfully hard with someone else’s firm arm and suddenly, red and yellow rained down around him. Dahlia flowers littered the ground around his feet and a wicker basket bounced against his head when the person he bumped into leaned down for the flowers at the same time as him.
This was the Gryffindor that had signed up for the DA without hesitation, that had stood up in the Final Battle with barely a break in her stride. Now she was a Gryffindor used to fighting for the man she loved and their…child?
“Malfoy sent Harry an invitation to Lily’s wedding,” Ron said nonchalantly as he dropped onto the couch beside his wife. He set the wine bottle onto the table and then leaned back, wrapping his arm around her shoulders. Even as Hermione looked at Harry with something akin to worry, she settled right into Ron’s side and the sight made Harry’s stomach drop.
“No you don’t. He was only lovely in photographs. Remember how irritable you were by month six?” A barking laugh broke through the magicked silence of the room.
“That was brilliant,” Harry said as he laid back down against Malfoy and wrapped an arm around his waist. “You’re brilliant.”
“He’s from the island. He was adopted. Dad knows his parents from school, they’re very close. They traveled a lot for work, but they spent the off season here. I didn’t see him as much when I started at Hogwarts but we started writing. I think I’ve been in love with him since I was six.”
Harry didn’t usually begrudge his friends their happiness. He was glad that even after all these years they were still so in love. But on nights like tonight, it made him think of his own failed marriage and why it failed; and he just ended up feeling lonelier than ever.
Pansy had grown her sleek, black hair out over the years. It hung loose down her back despite the heat, curling slightly at the bottom. Her muggle style clothes were always high class and fashionable, though she rarely ever strayed from whites, blacks, and grays. Her outfit even now lacked color. The woman was almost as tall as him, her body just as long and lean, and he thought it always made her look sharp and dangerous. Daphne beside her was the complete opposite. She was short and a little heavier set, her long, honey brown hair pulled into a messy bun on top of her head. Her clothing style was still very nice, though more comfortable than Pansy’s, and she almost always wore bright colors. Today’s outfit was a very loud turquoise color, complemented with matching jewelry and shoes. Even her makeup was loud. His heart soared at the sight of them both. He was happy on this island, truly, but it could be lonely at times. Nothing staved off the lingering darkness like a nice long stay from his two best friends.
Teddy dropped the box. Lily managed to stop its fall with a levitation charm at the last minute. One of the photographs floated out of the box and drifted to the floor, but no one seemed to notice. Teddy was too busy staring with his mouth wide open and Victoire was looking down at the vials as though she could see into the memories without a pensieve. Her lips were pursed in thought and Lily knew if she gave her friend a minute the girl would piece it together.
“Lily is a little more than nineteen years old, right?”
“You’re right. But what you never understood was that I didn’t have the luxury of chasing
“Well, you’re in for a treat. We can leave after breakfast, yeah?” Daphne nodded.
,” an indignant voice rose above the rest before its owner pushed through the crowd to stand before Draco, hands on her hips and lips twisted into a sneer. Draco rolled his eyes, his lips twitching as he bit back a smile. Four long scars trailed down one side of her face, pulsing an angry red to match her irritation. Draco had always found it just a tad endearing. It was just so…Gryffindor.
“Yes.” Hermione’s throat tightened.
She cleared her throat and stared at the gap between Teddy and the wall. He took the hint and stepped more to the side so she could move around him. Just as she was about to leave their own alcove, Teddy reached out and snatched her wrist. She turned back to him with a glare.
“Bill and I write each other. I keep up on Vic.”
A few chairs were pulled over to the exposed side of the table, but most of the students pushed into the booth anyways. Before he knew it, Harry was sitting with Hermione close to him on one side and Malfoy even closer to him on the other. He felt nothing but heat where part of Malfoy’s leg was pressed against his and every time Malfoy moved his legs, he could feel the blonde’s heel brush against his calf. He bit his lip and picked at the label on his bottle of stout as he tried not to hyper focus on the sparks lighting him up with every brush. Naturally, he was completely unsuccessful.
“So don’t put your name on the website,” Pansy said simply. As if it were that simple. Draco scowled again, but Daphne must have noticed the tension in his shoulders because she immediately changed the subject.
At this, Draco brightened exponentially and the beautiful, charming boy Charlie had met that one summer was standing in front of him. So it didn’t occur to Charlie to ask why Draco already knew what he was going to ask.
him,” Lavender corrected. Harry stared at her in amazement once again.
There were a handful of small glass vials, each containing a thick swirling mist that would faintly glow every so often. A few odd souvenirs had been stashed in the box – an empty box of chocolates, a napkin from a restaurant in Naxos with a fading sketch of a dragon moving about on it, a pale blue seashell, and a movie theater ticket stub for

Lily was about to blurt out.
His elbows dropped to the desk, his face still buried in his hands. He wondered briefly if it was a mistake. The envelope was addressed to him, but the handwriting wasn’t Malfoy’s. Perhaps it was just like all the other wedding invitations over the years – folks inviting a “celebrity” just to say they had, or in the hopes of a gift or a signed photograph. He should just decline right now.
“Hey Hermione,” Harry greeted a little sheepishly. He knew his friends were probably enjoying their last night alone before their kids returned home for the summer, but they still had their clothes on. They could put up with him for a few minutes. “Sorry to bother you.”
“How could you keep this from him?” At the sound of Hermione’s voice breaking, the blonde looked up.
“So you didn’t give them the chance because you were afraid of
“No, I’m regretting I never knew what could be.”
“And I think you already know Charlie?” Lily said tentatively, waving in his direction.
Lavender hadn’t come back for eighth year – hadn’t been allowed to, as Draco would later find out. It seemed Dumbledore was the only one capable of going to bat for werewolves, no matter the Order of Merlin Lavender had received for her part in the Final Battle. So when Lavender ultimately came to visit them, things between her and Draco were incredibly awkward. They hadn’t yet aired their grievances. But then she met Lily and Draco told her everything and now he had two permanently local friends to pester him about taking care of himself for the rest of his days.
The book Draco is reading to little Vince is “Julián Is a Mermaid” by Jessica Love. It’s a very cute, very colorful children’s book that sheds some amazing kid-level light on trans/genderqueer folks. The main characters are also Latine. 10/10 would recommend.
“Is he still with, uh, what was his name? Egra? Ergora?” Greg ground his teeth together. Sometimes, he really hated Slytherins.
“So…what are you going to do about Vic?” Teddy groaned; Lily laughed.
. She was, wasn’t she?
mostly empty mugs of tea from the day before still on the table next to her, Luna began to think that she might be in trouble.
“She definitely is,” Daphne followed up immediately. Greg laughed.
The gates opened upon their arrival and they were quickly escorted into a long, squat building that stood between them and the sanctuary. Their visit was checked in and then they were led past several large windows that allowed them to peer into (mostly) empty holding stalls, which Charlie knew from experience were to temporarily house injured dragons until they were safe to return to their enclosures, and a few hatching stalls where eggs and their mothers could be safely and routinely monitored. Not all endangered species were due to human involvement; some dragons could be particularly violent towards eggs that didn’t belong to them. While most sanctuaries chose not to interfere with the dragons’ natural instincts, especially as it often posed a great risk to their keepers, Kefáli tou Drákou was especially involved in conservation efforts. In its two hundred years of existence, the sanctuary had single handedly managed to save over forty different dragon species from extinction.
We were different people when we re-met that second time around. No more childish games, no more petty grudges. The war changed us, irreparably, and I think I was better for it. You said I was better for it. I’m not sure I was ever convinced you accepted all of me, though. I held onto that, wore that weight until I grew bitter. That was my own fault, though.
With a small smile, Luna sat back in her chair and cast a warming charm on her tea. She had a little bit before Hermione would show up for dinner.
“It’s bad luck for the bride to spend the night before her wedding with the groom!” Victoire’s voice could be heard crooning and Alex was back to grinning at Lily again even as the crowd began to fill in between them.
Malfoy tumbled backwards as soon as his legs hit the bed and Harry fell down with him, neither of them breaking away from their kiss. Malfoy wrapped his arms around Harry’s shoulders and brought his legs up to wrap them around Harry’s waist, crossing his heeled feet at the ankle to lock them behind Harry’s back and trap him against the blonde. Harry moaned as the heels pressed into him through his shirt and he pushed his body even closer to Malfoy.
“She’s best friends with a Slytherin though,” Pansy warned Draco, but Draco just scoffed.
“You’re right. But here we are. So do you want my help or not?”
~ ~ ~
“Le Couteau, actually,” Malfoy said smoothly and if Harry didn’t know any better, he’d think the man was preening from the admiration.
“I know,” Lily whispered, suddenly fighting back tears. Alex sighed and pulled Lily close again.
“It’s not uncommon in young Skrill. The males can be pretty territorial. Nico wrote to me and asked if we could take Geronimo. It’s not safe for him here anymore and they want to focus on breeding Gina and Ladon if they can. Increase the population. We have room for him in Romania. I told Nico I was going to be nearby anyways; said I could stop by and take him with me when I go. They should have the enclosure ready by the time we get there.”
anything to say. Twenty years and he has
“There is no mom.”
“Then what’s wrong?”
“They did turn out pretty alright,” Harry agreed, gazing back up at Draco. The blonde looked almost…fond. Harry’s breath caught in his throat. God, he was
friends? They’ve been practically glued at the hip since the end of first year.”
“What would give you that idea?”
His sashay came to an end right back where he started.
Charlie Weasley had always been a morning person. Even before work with the dragons had him up by four in the morning, it was simply as though his body didn’t know how to sleep much past six. It used to drive his mother crazy. Now six was “sleeping in” and Charlie liked being up this early. It seemed to be a small percentage of the magical population that agreed, which meant the Hotel Ariadne was quiet and the property was nearly empty. Only the workers seemed to be awake, and even they moved with a tired sluggishness through the halls and across the lawn. Charlie could only think of one other person happily awake and puttering around somewhere.
“Yes, Greg?” Draco’s voice was watery, a little tight. Greg respectfully ignored it, his gaze narrowed in on Harry.
The door to the suite flew open and a raven-haired witch stumbled through. She kicked off her heels and let out a cry of delight at the feeling. Lavender laughed. Greg, on the other hand, was used to Pansy’s dramatics by now.
“What?”
“I could never stay away, knowing you’re nearby,” he murmured and Lily nearly swooned. She pressed herself closer and rested her head against his chest. Even as the frantic music swirled around them, threatening to swallow them up, Alex guided them in a slow, swaying turn.
“Lily, there must be a reason he didn’t want you to know.” A reason he didn’t want Charlie to know, even if he couldn’t think of one right now.
“So this is what you flew and sailed and portkeyed all those miles for, is it?” Draco snarled, his voice quiet. He ground his thigh against Harry and the Gryffindor gasped, his hips arching forwards.
The restaurant inside the Villa Ariadne was known for its buffet. Locals would come spend meals here. As Vic filled her plate up with breakfast foods, she couldn’t help but wish Uncle Ron were here to see this. With out of country wedding guests starting to fill up the rooms, Draco had outdone himself with the sea of offerings. There were three different styles of eggs, three varieties of pancakes and waffles, four different kinds of meats, twelve different breakfast pastries, potatoes cooked six different ways, fresh hotel made toast and muffins, and fresh squeezed orange juice. Vic was sure her friend was going to have to move in with her after the expenses on this wedding. But one bite into the fresh island fruit and she wasn’t complaining.
he listen to his uncle’s song. And Greg had been quite unable to tell him no. The man was sure he would forever be wrapped around his children’s fingers.
“Are you hurt?” Draco asked and this time the woman rolled her eyes, reaching up to brush curly blonde hair from her face.
“Even harder than getting over–” Lily clamped her mouth shut. Charlie furrowed his brow and frowned.
“A little, I guess. They were barely there when we left. I don’t think I’ve ever had a proper conversation with James, but I’ve talked with Albus a bit. He’s in the same house as Vic. He’s a good kid.”
“Yes.” They fell into silence then, both slowly picking away at their plates
Harry realized he had forgotten his potions book and decided to detour from back to his dorm to pick it up before he went to lunch. The eighth-year common room was empty and his stomach was grumbling, so with nothing to distract him, he took the stairs two at a time to the second floor.
And they were new, Harry could tell. On top of Malfoy’s desk was a box Harry recognized as the one that had been delivered to Malfoy that morning at breakfast. It had been slightly enlarged and it was open, tissue paper spilling over the sides. The heels must have come out of the box, though Harry wasn’t sure who had sent them.
“Did you pack the sunscreen?”
~ ~ ~
“No, but you did raise a Hufflepuff.” Draco groaned.
“Cute?” the boy asked. Harry looked back down and nodded, biting back a laugh.
~ ~ ~
Harry could feel himself grow hard at the rough tone in Malfoy’s voice. The blonde was already flush against him and Harry could feel the blonde responding to their proximity. Their feelings couldn’t be clearer. Now was not the time to be nervous. Now was the time for his Gryffindor bravery.
“You’re home early,” he said, moving forward to greet her with a hug and a kiss. Hermione beamed at him, leaning against him for just a moment before she remembered
“Don’t remind me,” he huffed, turning to look out the door again. His frown deepened for a moment before both brows rose. “Daphne, I need you out there now.”
“Back left corner by the buffet. Harry and Weasley just sat down with Lily.”
We exit the building together. Still not a word between us. I can see him waiting across the street, waving at you with a coffee in either hand and the biggest smile on his face. I look at you again and you’re already looking back at me. Maybe you never stopped.
“What are you up to today, Benny?” Draco asked as he unlocked door number twelve, pushing into the darkened guest room. It was spacious, with a large king bed taking up more than half the room, the rest occupied by a desk, a small fridge with a coffee maker above it, and a sliding glass doorway to its balcony. The hotel had a few suites, but the majority of the rooms looked just like this one, some perhaps with two queen beds in place of the one king. Draco snagged an armful of towels from his cart and headed to the closet outside the bathroom. Benny followed him into the room.
Pansy’s smirk only grew.
“Sometimes, but not for why you think. I’m the hotel manager.”
“Healer patient privilege,” they both said at the same time. Hermione nodded and leaned back into the chair with a sigh, rubbing the fatigue from her eyes. Working in London as two of the best Healers in their fields, there were many moments like this where they knew something that would affect their friends before that friend found out. It was part of the job. Logically, Hermione understood that. It just wasn’t always easy to be logical, especially when it came to Harry.
“I’ll write them in the morning,” Harry decided. Ron and Hermione shared a look that spoke volumes to them, but which Harry only understood to mean that they were concerned about him. Some silent conversations he could pick up on, but he had never quite picked up on the ones they shared about him.
“I understand, no need to apologize. I am very much looking forward to it! You will make such a beautiful bride.”
“He won’t talk about the past. He doesn’t understand. But I need to know.”
“Draco Malfoy, are you flirting with me?”
“That’s that green and yellow feathered dragon, right?”
Well, that wasn’t strictly true. Sometimes he came up in conversation when Andromeda or Teddy came to visit. The last twenty years hadn’t been a completely Potter-free world. He’d heard bits and pieces. He hadn’t been allowed to forget, no matter how much he used to hope for it. But Draco was older now and wiser now and he had more important priorities to focus on.
“Just wait,” Parkinson practically sing-songed. Not a moment later, Malfoy reappeared at the top of the stairs and everyone fell quiet.
And then Harry was kissing Malfoy properly. Their lips slotted together and when Malfoy moaned against him, Harry took the opportunity to slip his tongue into the blonde’s mouth. Malfoy met him with equal intensity, dropping his hands from the door to Harry’s face in order to better angle the shorter man’s head so he could deepen the kiss. Harry slid his hands back around to Malfoy’s hips and used the opportunity to push Malfoy back and guide them over to the closest bed – Harry’s.
Tracing his father’s lineage had been what took him to Greece all those years ago in the first place. He hadn’t had many opportunities over the years to go and see the few family he had found, but they often kept in touch by owl. Maybe Hermione was right. Even if the wedding went tits up, seeing his family would at least sweeten the ending.
Charlie found Lily across the Taverna, by one of the exits. He grinned at her, his face warm with drink.
“Did you talk to Ginny?”
The open market was crowded at this time in the afternoon, but Harry found it easy to slip through, pausing to sample food or peruse the locally made soaps and oils. He watched as regulars greeted those running the booths, as a local vendor teased another with friendly competition. He wondered if things had gone differently, if he might be the one to tell them there was plenty of room for two cheese shops; if in another world he was securing them both for a large event. Harry swallowed around a lump in his throat and forced himself to turn away. It had been so easy not to think like this for the last fifteen years. He pushed away his what-ifs in favor of a swirl of memories focusing on his teenage sons. The two reasons why it had been so easy until now.
Except, Harry could not stop thinking about Malfoy’s long, shapely legs and wondering what it might be like to see Malfoy take longer strides in those heels. Or, more embarrassingly, to have Malfoy wrap those legs around his waist and press his heeled feet into Harry’s arse as they– Harry flushed a cherry red and pulled the curtains on his bed closed.
It took two full weeks of being more ignored than usual, but when Malfoy seemed to realize that Harry wasn’t going to taunt him or spread the news over the school, the blonde started to relax. They hadn’t been very friendly to start with, so it was a little hard to tell when they had gone back to their usual, chilled routine, but one morning Malfoy was still in the room when Harry got up and that seemed to be that.
“Nevermind. Just tell me how things are.” Theo seemed to consider him for a moment before nodding.
“It probably will be, but I can’t stand another twenty years of ‘what ifs,’ mate,” Ron said with a wince. Hermione turned a glare on him.
“Oh no,” she muttered to herself. Hermione’s head snapped up at the uttering, her gaze finding her friend and coworker and pinning her to the spot.
“Dragon man. I like that. Have you ever been to a dragon reserve before?
“Lily, I won’t beat around the bush. I know why I’m here,” Theo said. She turned to gape at him, but he continued before she could interject. “And let me tell you, I think it’s brilliant. I’ve always wanted a little girl, and a big one’s even better!”
Teddy knew that Vic was certain that Harry was Lily’s other dad and that Lily was talking herself into being certain that Charlie was her other dad. Teddy also knew that they would both be wrong. He could see the appeal, sure. But after last night, Teddy was absolutely certain that Lily’s other dad was Theo. When Teddy asked Lily how she thought using the plot of her favorite musical as a real life ploy would be at all inconspicuous to Draco, the curly blonde had replied that her dad was sure to give it serious consideration and then promptly consider it to be too obvious, if not beyond her capability, and ignore it. It was just so…
“Oh, for Godric’s sake,” Daphne huffed and Draco heard her shift to lean forward in her seat. “Potter’s been fighting for you since he got here.” Draco scoffed.
“I’m still a little upset I was never considered,” Daphne piped up, dropping into a reclining chair across from them. Draco and Pansy both laughed.
Harry had no idea where they were going. The hotel was so much bigger than he remembered. But Draco seemed content to just follow. Until he wasn’t. Until suddenly Harry felt himself being spun around and backed into an alcove. Draco pressed up against him, his thigh sliding in between Harry’s legs. Harry gasped.
Lily began to gasp for breath, to reach for the bar to keep herself standing. The edges of her vision began to darken and the music seemed to be fading faster than it actually was. A few people nearby seemed to notice something was happening because suddenly a couple of her friends were approaching with looks of concern.
“M-my shoes,” Malfoy managed to get out between strokes. Harry grinned and pulled his hand away, his grin growing as Malfoy whimpered at the loss of touch.
“Uncle Dray,” the boy told him, dropping his wet hand to his lap. Harry smiled and nodded.
“Maybe for the holidays, you know what the British winters does to my joints,” Marcus grunted and everyone laughed. Draco held the door open and escorted the men in, Theo coming over to greet them.
Malfoy was wearing a pair of cotton shorts that had been rolled a few times at the top, which gave Harry a clear view of his long, lean, lightly muscled legs that somehow looked even more shapely with the heels lifting them up. Harry didn’t know Malfoy’s grooming habits, but the smooth skin of his legs wasn’t new. Harry didn’t know if it was natural or intentional; he had never asked.
dreams. I was just trying to live, and I guess I just so foolishly hoped you might want to be a part of that life. Even if your dreams didn’t include being with me.” Draco deflated, his eyes burning again. But he couldn’t stop now, couldn’t prevent twenty years’ worth of pent-up emotion from spilling out. “You were my best friend. That’s the worst part. You just left and you didn’t even send me a letter.” Harry was taken aback.
“Not all of it, but a lot of it,” Greg said, folding his arms across his chest as the men behind him began to move the now organized boxes. “Where are the kids?”
“Really?” Charlie mused, sounding a little distant as he passed Harry his duffel bag.
“So how’s business? How’s Britain treating you? Do they laud the noble Nott name again?” Theo rolled his eyes this time.
“Come on, Nott. You’ve known that since we were eleven years old.” Nott sighed again and Greg grinned at him. “Go on and get your bags. I’ll show you my kitchen.”
“When does Theo get here?” Teddy broke the evening silence and Lily looked up from her book to smile at him. The pair were sat on the slanted roof above their shared suite. Normally they’d room separately, but with the influx of guests there simply wouldn’t be room. Vic was with them too, but where she was now he didn’t know. He tried not to think about the fact that he wasn’t allowed to know anymore.
“Sometimes, Draco, you kind of are,” Pansy’s exasperated stage whisper was heard back. Daphne seemingly ignored them both.
Hannah was the first one to speak.
“I’ll see you at the alter!” Alex’s voice called out, but anything else he said was swallowed by the music.
“‘Mione and Ron got over Draco, and he was way worse,” Harry said before taking a long swig of his lager.
“On the contrary, I think we just know you well. You’re lucky, then, that Draco knows you best. He won’t see it coming.”
“You’re a bloody wanker, Daph.”
my fathers. You can’t tell Dad though.”
“No, they’ll be here Thursday,” Victoire said. She turned to hug Charlie much more willingly and Harry feigned offense. Then Teddy cleared his throat and Harry turned to look at where the now-blue-haired boy was standing with his arm around the other blonde.
The beaches of Kalokairi were world renowned. With warm, crystal clear water, it was swimmable all year round. The sand was white and soft, shells far enough away from each other that it was safe to walk. Pansy always felt right at home laying out on her beach lounger. So it was with great irritation that she found her sun suddenly being blocked out. A tall shadow passed over her and then stilled. She frowned, but refused to open her eyes, hoping whoever it was would get the picture and leave her alone. It wasn’t her stop-Mamma-Mia shift for another hour and she was going to enjoy that time dammit! But when still the figure didn’t move on, she let out a very audible, deep sigh of frustration.
The mid-afternoon ferry brought most of the cast down to the docks, waiting for the boat of familiar faces to make its appearance. Harry found Lily sitting on the edge of the ferry dock, her legs dangling over the water, with Vic and Teddy standing just behind her in their own private conversation. They all three looked up at the sound of his approach and he waved heartily to their enthusiastic greeting.
? That’s not my bloody job!”
Though not as big as the dragon sanctuary in Romania, Kefáli tou Drákou was known for its conservation of endangered dragon species such as the Wyrm, a species that looked remarkably like a very docile basilisk, or the Indian Naga, whose human-like face played a role in the uncanny valley phenomenon that still plagues the human species to this day. Kefáli tou Drákou was situated on an island between Naxos and Kalokairi and could only be reached by boat or broom due to its extensive anti-apparition and even anti-portkey wards. Charlie had always wondered at the story behind that, but every dragon keeper seemed to have heard something entirely different from another so the original ages-old tale was lost to history.
If Harry didn’t know any better, from this distance the little boy could have been James when he was that age. The idea made Harry’s stomach flutter and his heart twist all at once; that at some point he might have come close to that very idea being a reality made it very hard to push away all those ‘what ifs.’ Harry wondered if Draco would have been like this with James and Albus, if he had been like this with Lily, and felt his heart break. Harry would never regret Ginny– she had given him their boys– but he would always regret leaving Kalokairi when he did. There was nothing for it now, though. All Harry could do was move forward, and he knew the day before that the moment he laid eyes on the blonde for the first time in twenty years that he would do anything to make sure he moved forward with Draco. So pushing Lavender’s arm down and staunchly ignoring her inquisitive stare, Harry began to step forwards.
“My fiancé. You’ll love him, he has such a good heart. He’s just so kind, you know? I don’t know if you know this, but my head’s a little in the clouds at times. He grounds me. Keeps me sane.”
“Charlie,
“That wasn’t talking. There’s nothing to talk about. We’ve had a bit to drink tonight and that’s
Charlie’s brows rose as he looked at Lily, but slowly he broke out into a grin. Harry just gaped.
~ ~ ~
“I can give it to him,” he offered instead. Andromeda rolled her eyes and then smiled softly.
“What would you prefer I call you then?” Draco drawled.
“Why are we stopping here?” Lily asked as Nico began to pull over.
Lavender just hummed in response, her expression turning thoughtful as they entered the hotel. Harry should have turned right to get to his room, but for some reason found himself turning left and continuing to follow his old schoolmate. She had said the flowers were for the bridal bouquet; maybe Harry could learn more about the bride. Or about the other blonde he could never stop thinking about.
“The penny’s dropped now, good and proper. That’s why you sent me the invitation. You want your other old dad here to walk you down the aisle. Well, I’m not going to let you down. I’ll be there!”
“And what about you? What do you want to do?” Lily looked away at that, turning her gaze back to the water gently lapping against the dock.
I hope that you loved this chapter as much as I loved writing it. Please leave kudos and comments and don’t hesitate even a little to share your thoughts!

“Pansy!”
“Now all we need is for that Romanian Weasley to show up on the island and we’ll have a real Mamma Mia situation on our hands,” Daphne joked, referencing the Broadway musical the old hotel owners and subsequently Lily had been obsessed with.
“Draco,” Pansy began, a little tentatively, and Draco quirked a brow without opening his eyes. “That’s…we’re not…”
Nico drove the odd trio past a variety of dragons – the sand and snow wraiths, both of which excelled with blending in with their surroundings; a large gaggle of dwarf dragons, a small species that lived in hives like bees and were often found scavenging shiny objects instead of food (a huge part of why they found themselves on the endangered species list); the world’s only known living Ka-Riu, a scarlet colored dragon that often looked as though it was made completely of fire; and one of Lily’s favorites, the Knucker, a leathery brown dragon that lives in damp holes, spits purple venom, and reminds Lily a bit of a salamander.
Draco took a moment now to look at his Executive Events Coordinator – his only events coordinator, really, but Lavender had
“Alright.” Draco smiled and Charlie smiled back. “So…show me what you’re doing here.”
“Internet,” Daphne corrected. Draco rolled his eyes.
“Thank Godric you did,” Harry said with a deep sigh and a faint smile. “It used to be a quiet island, this.”
Both Victoire and Teddy raised their eyebrows at that and then turned to the other with a meaningful look. The couple had been split up for almost a year, this time. Their relationship had had a lot of passionate starts and angry stops since Victoire was fourteen and Teddy sixteen. The pair’s relationship had been nothing less than tumultuous over the years, but they always managed to maintain some semblance of friendship in between their breakups. Lily was usually the one to bring them around. And after all the pair had been through, it was almost as if they could communicate without talking. Lily hated it. Even if the three of them could often convey a wordless conversation, the private moments between the two when they were clearly silently talking about her annoyed her to no end. She wished every time she had just let their friendship wither away.
“You know how he is.” Nott hummed thoughtfully.
“Marcus was a bully. Wasn’t easy for Percy to get past.” Harry frowned.
“No one. Nothing. You were saying?” Charlie looked at her for another moment, then shook his head as though trying to clear it.
. You feel it too. I
Harry’s hands fell to his sides, his head lolling back against the wall behind him. He could feel the trickle of Draco’s magic as it washed over him, cleaning him. His magic smelled like vanilla and oak. It tasted like white chocolate and green apples. It felt like home. Harry hummed with happiness when he felt those nimble hands do up his trousers. They were so gentle. Far gentler than he deserved. And then a gust of cool air hit him and Harry opened his eyes, realizing that Draco was stepping away. Instinctively, Harry reached for him. But Draco just took another step back, his face blank. Harry could already feel his chest tightening. No. No, no, no.
“Yes,” Harry agreed, his hands coming up to clutch Draco’s waist. Draco planted his hands on either side of Harry’s head and leaned in close, his eyes studying the shorter man’s face before landing on his lips.
on the kitchen doors. Draco glared at the bird again.
“Narrowed it down?” Victoire repeated, narrowing her eyes at her friend. Lily began to look a little sheepish again.
an idiot. “Draco…”
“What are you reading?” he called out. Draco started, sitting up before he suddenly remembered the boy tucked into him. The book fell to the floor with an echoing tumble in the spacious room and Draco wound his arms around the boy to keep him from meeting the same fate.
“Good luck,” Lavender laughed and the three women shared a smile, melting the tension away again.
“I’m not,” he said, shrugging and taking a long sip from his beer. “I didn’t know you were friends with him either.”
They lay tangled together afterwards, both of them still catching their breath and winding down.
“Me? I, uh, run a cosmetic company, actually,” she confessed, her cheeks flushing a faint shade of pink. “It’s called Luminesce.” Charlie’s brows rose.
“Ah, little flower, it has been too long!” Nico crooned, his Greek accent as thick as his English was flawless. Lily pulled away with a rather sheepish smile in return.
“You went to school with him, right?” she asked and Harry nodded, his smile faltering a little.
has to talk some sense into Draco.”
“Ron!” she chastised him, smacking him on the arm with the back of her hand, and Ron just grinned a little sheepishly and shrugged. Then Hermione turned back to Harry and offered an apologetic smile. “He’s right, though.”
“Charlie!” Lily called out. “Charlie, please wait!”
Harry was still standing in the doorway, mouth slightly agape, as he took in Malfoy’s tall, lean figure. Harry had admitted to himself back in fifth year that Malfoy was rather attractive to look at, and his opinion on that matter had only grown once they were back at Hogwarts and sharing a room together. This, though. This was a new feeling entirely. His stomach flipped and his heart raced and Harry was sure a flush was starting to creep up his face as he appreciatively watched Malfoy model his beautiful footwear. And then Malfoy finally caught sight of Harry on his next spin, and this time the blonde immediately froze.
“What!?” Teddy cried, pulling open the top. He frowned down at the contents.
But the words were swallowed by Draco, the blonde’s lips crashing into his once more like the waves drawn to the shore. One stroke, two, three, and then Harry was digging his nails into Draco even harder as his hips stuttered and he came. Draco snarled at the feeling of come splattering over his hand and his own cock and followed with a long, drawn-out groan.
). When he was really lonely, he could almost pretend he was telling Lily’s other father about the things he missed while she was away. Even if it wasn’t the man he wished he was telling all about her.
Charlie had gone back to the dragon sanctuary again today and was telling them a little bit about it. And then Harry had managed to get Theo to tell him about the first time he had met Lily when she was three years old without quite realizing that Harry was fishing for information. It was as Theo was recounting the tale of the very brave toddler that the lights dimmed and silence fell upon the taverna.
“No,” he said and then fell silent. Something close to relief began to creep into Draco inch by inch, but the longer Harry went on saying nothing the heavier his heart felt.
“Not often. Right.” Theo’s smile seemed to turn sad at that. Draco just felt guilty so he pulled his friend into another hug. It seemed tighter than the last one.
The door clicked softly behind him and it was like a switch had been flipped. In a few short strides, Malfoy was across the room and crowding Harry against the door. He pressed his body flat against Harry’s, his hands coming to rest on the door on either side of Harry’s head. Malfoy was already taller than Harry, but with the extra height from his heels Harry had to crane his neck to look into Malfoy’s face from this angle. He didn’t mind even a little bit.  The grey of Malfoy’s eyes was slowly disappearing, the black of his pupils swallowing it as they dilated. Harry licked his lips again, groaning out loud this time when Malfoy’s gaze dropped down to watch.
“So? Did they get into a fight?”
“Don’t you
“You mean looking for a fight,” he muttered and then squawked indignantly when Pansy smacked his leg.
Malfoy went right up to their room when they returned. Harry made to follow, but somehow Ron roped him into the conversation (or argument, really) that he was having with Terry about the Cannons and almost an hour had passed before he was able to pull himself away and make his way upstairs.
“Yes, we wouldn’t want Saint Potter to die with a heavy conscience now, would we?”
“Are you coming?” Nico’s voice suddenly called to them. Charlie laughed and slung his arm over Lily’s shoulders.
“Then what are you waiting for?”
“I dare say, she’s not your type, Dray.”
“I thought it was very clever.”
“Hey!” Harry protested, but he couldn’t stop the laugh. This is what his friends were for. They were always honest, even if it was for their own benefit, even if it did really suck to hear.
Harry turned to look at the blonde as Malfoy instead began to brush his foot lightly up Harry’s calf. The blonde was deep in conversation with Parkinson beside him and Hannah across from them, paying Harry no mind at all. Harry was just thinking that perhaps the whole thing was an accident when Malfoy’s hand suddenly settled on top of his thigh and the pressure of his heel against Harry’s leg increased.
Eventually though, Draco learned to wait to announce it until it was something
“Oh, alright. I’ll do it.”
“Well, you’ll have to speak to him.” Despite the fact that Draco had kept this from him for twenty years, Charlie couldn’t just break the younger man’s trust. He really hated being such a Gryffindor sometimes.
, what are you doing in Kalokairi?”
Malfoy was wearing a pair of extremely tight black jeans and a snug, thin, pale pink long-sleeved shirt with V-neck that would normally button closed but had been left loosely open to reveal an expanse of smooth, pale collar. Malfoy was just pulling on a faux fur cloak that completed the ensemble.
Harry didn’t know anything about fashion, but he had listened to the Gryffindor girls in his year talk enough to recognize the names of the high-end brands. Hannah’s eyebrows rose at Malfoy’s response and Harry realized that Le Couteau must be one of the top high-end wizarding brands.
“So that would make Lily…”
“Goodbye, Draco,” you whisper back.
“Skrill hibernate in ice,” Lily explained. “Honestly, it’s probably the only reason why they live so long. Their bodies slow exponentially, and they age very little when they’re frozen. It’s also the best way to preserve them for transport. They’re not anxious that way and to them, it feels like no time has passed at all.” Lily looked down at Geronimo, who was still lying down and curiously gazing up at her from his position on the floor. “He might be a
Lily found Theo by the stage. He had managed to get out of the dancers and away from them ever so slightly. He was looking at the stage, new since he had last set foot here, and examining the hand-carved details he knew Draco had always been so enticed by.
“Right…Listen, Draco, you should know I–”
So naturally, this was exactly when Harry sat down beside him.
, with an expression that told Harry she knew the answer and was fishing for more information. He smiled and bit back the reminder that she should know if Draco really talked about him so much. Harry didn’t know
“So?” Draco whirled on his friend with an irritated, incredulous expression on his face.
“Guys, that’s
“Nothing! He’s never mentioned you.”
I can’t stop the tears from coming then, but I can’t look at you either. And when we pass the eighteenth floor, you tug on my arm and pull me into yours and I bury my face into your neck and I sob. I can feel you shake against me, feel you tighten your fists into my shirt. Once, I might have been angry that you’re ruining my Oxford, but now I’m too tired to be angry anymore.
Lily made her way to the bar as the bachelor party began to filter out the way they came. She could feel buzzing in her veins pumping to the beat of the music and she wasn’t quite sure which way was up. She opened her mouth to ask for something, when a body slid into the space beside her.
“Greg tells me you and Egor broke up.” Draco scoffed and rolled his eyes.
“Er, yeah. I thought you said he talked about me?” Harry raised both brows at her. Lily flushed a little and cleared her throat, sipping at her juice to collect her bearings. Vic stifled a laugh from beside her.
“What if it’s a mistake?” Harry asked.
Before Harry had a chance to respond, to find out more, Charlie was suddenly pressing on the horn and the loud, rich noise the boat produced was muting everything else. Harry stood up to look out over the island as Charlie began to pull into the port. It had been twenty years since he had last set foot in Kalokairi, and his heart twisted with the influx of memories. The island remained mostly unchanged – still white stone houses built up among the green, rolling hills with the hotel perched at the top of this side of the island. But the place seemed busier now, more alive. And even from here, Harry could see that the little hotel he had spent three memorable weeks in had grown significantly from the last time he saw it. His smile as he looked up was wistful, a little bittersweet. He was such an idiot back then, Harry thought.
“That’s still ridiculous!” Charlie shrugged.
Hannah and Parkinson arrived at the top of the stairs first. They were practically glowing with excitement as they came down, both trying extremely hard to contain their glee. Only a few moments later, Malfoy appeared, and Harry felt his heart try to leap out of his throat.
It turned out that Draco Malfoy owned thirty-two pairs of heels. And Harry loved seeing him in every single one.
“Hard to put it all together when you don’t have all the information available,” she growled. Greg bit back a smile. As conniving as she was, he sometimes forgot that Lavender was a Gryffindor.
“Don’t tell me you have a secret twin sister.” Charlie could feel his heart pounding. He didn’t know if what he was feeling was terror or excitement. Both, probably.
“Truth or dare, Abbott?”
“I knew you’d show up sooner or later.” They strode forwards at the same time, coming together to hug and clap the other on the back, before taking a step away and taking the other in. “I feel like I haven’t seen you in ages.”
“Let’s change and get back. I could use a drink!” Daphne announced, standing up and stretching.
“I’m here for– erm, that is,” Harry stumbled, looking suddenly nervous as he ran both hands through his hair. He took a deep breath and seemed to steel himself, dropping his hands to his side. “I’m on vacation. I’m here for leisure.”
“No. I don’t think that I have.”
“Of course not,” Draco snapped. “No one wanted to be associated with a Malfoy back then. I would have been left raising her alone anyway, better to just get on with it.”
The warm breeze ruffled his long hair, tousling the strands that had fallen loose from his ponytail, and though he might have once been frustrated with how the weather affected his hair, he had already spent the morning ruining it with sweat-inducing labor, so he really didn’t think twice about the wind. He welcomed it instead, rocking back and forth on his feet as he waited for the boat to come in. It was quick to depart, but it always took its sweet time docking. He knew how unpleasant the rocking could get as the motor turned off and the boat glided just a little awkwardly through the shallow water. He could just imagine his friend squawking loudly through bouts of nausea about how undignified traveling by boat was, how he should have taken her up on her offer to just buy him an island and let her pay to connect it to the international floo.
“Oh hello, Lily Luna,” Luna greeted her namesake with a warm smile. “Shouldn’t you be getting ready for a wedding? I never imagined you’d have time for me.”
“Why don’t you come through? I’ll summon another glass,” Hermione said, but she was already waving her hand for the aforementioned glass before Harry could protest. With a sigh, he stepped through.
“I didn’t mean anything by it. I just wanted to know if she was ok.” Draco narrowed his eyes and crossed his arms.
“How did you know?” Teddy’s shocked timber voice filtered in from behind Lily somewhere.
was approaching the open door to the room Draco was currently stood in, Draco did the only thing a person with everything to lose could possibly do. He snatched up Benny into his arms and shut themselves into the small, dark closet.
“Never,” Teddy declared firmly, a frown tugging at his lips. He always said it was cheating when Lily used that argument. He’d tell her she belonged in Slytherin. But before he could say anything else, she was shoving a box towards him. He looked down and read the neat, cursive label that was starting to fade,
she had come home early.
“Draco, is she –”
Harry felt his orgasm building and as his thrusts began to grow erratic, he slipped a hand between them and wrapped his fingers around Malfoy’s prick. He gripped him firmly and began to stroke him in time with his thrusts, brushing his thumb over his slit with every upwards slide. Malfoy melted beneath him, pressing his heels into Harry’s arse to push him in deeper and urge him onwards as he clawed at Harry’s back to keep him as close as possible.
“When did he buy the Villa Ariadne?” Harry tried to sound cool. He thought he sounded cool. Based on the look Lavender levelled him with, he definitely didn’t.
of all places.
“What?”
“So how’s Lily? Is she excited?” Draco was never more grateful for his friend. At the thought of his daughter, he smiled.
“I talked to Theo before I left,” Pansy began delicately, looking down into her very strong drink as she spoke. Draco turned his head to look at her, frowning as he waited for her to go on. “We talked about Lily’s wedding. He’s coming. Isn’t that a little fucked up, even for you?”
“Your da? Well, your da was iridescent. Still is. An absolute ball of energy. Well, I’ll tell you something, it was him who inspired me to find my family. We took a trip to meet them together and afterwards, he took me to this island.”
It was the second night of winter break and the eighth years that had remained behind for the holidays had all decided to spend a cozy night in with the bottles of peach whiskey and coconut rum that Zabini had pulled from his trunk. They were all several drinks in, pleasantly warm with pink cheeks and bright eyes, when Lisa had suggested they all get to know each other better with a little game of truth-or-dare. Buzzed as they all were, it was almost unanimously agreed upon. Even Hermione had said that it could be fun.
“And don’t worry about Draco. He doesn’t scare me…much!”
“Greg?”
With a sigh, Luna turned around and smiled as sheepishly as she could manage. She didn’t feel
to get her out of me.” Draco laughed, but Charlie’s brow just furrowed.
“You’re not funny!”
inappropriate!”
“Wait. You said your dad never stops talking about his friends from the old days. What’s going on, Lily? Why am I here?” Lily’s eyes widened, realizing her mistake.
The dragons were inspired from many sources, but the Skrill specifically are from one of the “How to Train Your Dragon” movies. I haven’t seen it myself, but I loved this dragon and it’s on my to-watch list for sure.
“I’ll feel like a proper bride if I can walk down the aisle with
“Let’s not, that being what got you into this mess and all.”
She had been in
“You know too, don’t you?” Lily finally said, her voice soft and coming from directly next to him.
-Voulez-Vous.
“About her dad or us?” Teddy called out, but only silence greeted him.
~ ~ ~
“And when she contacted you the other day, that was what?”
“Yeah, I know that. I guess Vic and Lily are good friends.”
“Oh my Godric, she is,” Teddy gasped, a strained giggle forcing its way past his lips. He lasted only moment and then he burst out laughing. Beside him, Victoire began to laugh too. Lily looked up to glare at them and then before she could stop herself, she was collapsing into giggles too. Her plan was straight out of a playbill; it all seemed so ridiculous. And yet.
“I didn’t know that.”
When Lily and Charlie caught up, Nico and Daphne were already standing in front of a pacing, obviously anxious dragon. A magical barrier stood between them and the dragon for safety; the pacing dragon was sparking with electricity. The dragon was a deep purple in color with a light gray underbelly. Black and dark gray spikes covered the dragon’s head and trailed down its back to the tip of its sharpened tail. Its eyes were black, endless pits and its wings were large and bat-like. It paced back and forth on its large hind legs, its front claws part of its wings. Currents of electricity seemed to spark down the length of its body over and over again, almost as if the dragon’s anxiety was becoming literally palpable.
~ ~ ~
“Are you alright, sir?” a tentative voice called out to him. He looked up and met the anxious gaze of the teen ticket attendant, nervously managing the stand by herself. He looked down and saw the sparkle of the teen’s name badge, the little boat on it sailing across her name, and he knew he could ask her about the Kalokairi schedule.
“No one,” she squeaked. Theo flashed her his trademark smirk.
“See what you saw? Yes, you thimble.” Vic scoffed and rolled her eyes, pushing the taller man away from her. She reached down to straighten her pants and pull down her skirt, the mood long since effectively killed. She heard movement from in front of her implying Teddy was doing the same, but Vic couldn’t look directly at him just this moment.
on the title. Her scars had faded with her annoyance to a soft pink, nearly blending in with her flushed skin. She still had the round face he remembered from school, the same curvy build and handsome features. The differences now were in the years of weariness of her shoulders and the lines of age in her face. She was as fearless as she ever was, though, and for the last thirteen years her strong, authoritative demeanor had been really good for Greg and Draco and the Villa Ariadne. She had been a positive influence on Lily too– Draco wasn’t exactly comfortable asking his mother to have “the talk” with his daughter, after all.
Daphne, Draco, and Pansy stood in that order, wearing white, long-sleeve, bell-bottom and bell-sleeved jumpsuits. The collars and cuffs were lined with a frilly blue material. Their outfits glittered and glowed with their movements, reflecting the multicolored lights from above them. Despite being a little tipsy, Harry was very sure that whatever material the jumpsuits were made of were covered entirely in sequins. The trio on stage were each holding a microphone and as the tempo picked up, they sang in unison.
Before Lily could speak, Harry was already turning around and marching off. She watched in horror as the Head Auror stumbled towards a familiar blonde. And then as if she was sent by the gods, Pansy was suddenly intercepting him and pressing a pink liquid into his hand, guiding Harry in the opposite direction. The raven-haired man seemed too confused to protest. Lily let out a sigh of relief and turned back to the bar just as another drink was set down before her. She picked it up and threw it back in one swallow.
~ ~ ~
“Alright,” Draco cleared his throat, suddenly broken from the trance. He stood and placed Vince onto the ground, forcing Harry to stand and move back in order to avoid being stepped on. “I think your mother needs your help, Vincent. You best be off.”
“Nico, this is one of my godmothers, Daphne,” Lily introduced. Nico grasped one of Daphne’s hands with his and pressed his lips to the back of it.
The taverna raged on. The men were divided, pulled in different directions, and circled by much too excited young women dancing along to the music. All three felt a little uncomfortable, but the young women had been drinking and were clearly just excited to cause a ruckus. So throwing caution to the wind, they began to dance. When in Rome. Or Kalokairi, rather.
overalls, and turned to face the stupidly better dressed Golden Boy.
?” Daphne looked at him with disappointment and Draco groaned, burying his face into the pillow.
“So you just stayed together for the kids?”
“I’ve got you, babe. Always.”
“So, he really sent you an invitation?” Hermione asked and Harry nodded. “And I take it you’re not sure if you should go?” Harry nodded again. Hermione pursed her lips and swirled her glass thoughtfully.
“And that Slytherin is still a Weasley,” Draco drawled, even though they all knew he loved Victoire like a second daughter. She had spent too many school vacations on the island with them for her to not have grown on him. Daphne just laughed, but Pansy silently pursued her lips in thought.
“You weren’t asked to consult on this case.” Hermione glared again. Luna held firm. Hermione sighed.
“Well, you know what comes next.”
“Do you work with flowers usually?”
“Yeah, I saw that crack in the atrium,” Theo said. “What’s that about?” Draco just waved him away.
“I love you, Ronald.”
“You absolutely should have,” Harry said, smiling down at the man as he tucked him into his side. Tentatively, Malfoy smiled back.
“I was expecting this,” Luna admitted. “I must say I expected you a lot sooner, but the timing makes sense. Mamma Mia?”
“Mmm.”
“Is Gina going with him?” Lily asked as they slowly made their way into the cold, iced cave. Nico cast a warming charm over the group, looking at Lily sadly.
~ ~ ~
The game moved on without any more remarks about Malfoy’s shoes, even when Malfoy crossed his legs and his heeled foot dangled in clear view. Harry, however, was unable to think about anything else.
“I don’t
“You got what you came for, Potter. Now you can leave.”
“Cause that’s all we’ve got the breath for,” Draco added in. Harry could hear Pansy attempting (and failing) to stifle her laughter.
At the sight of the dragon, Lily bounced away from Charlie and approached the barrier with a wide smile on her face. Charlie reached out to stop her, but Nico held out an arm to prevent Charlie from approaching. Nico’s other arm was wrapped around Daphne and keeping her from chasing after the young woman as well. He seemed to be the only one completely unconcerned about what the agitated dragon could do to someone as small as Lily.
“She’s a Malfoy and I’m a Weasley. It would go against everything my family stands for.”
“What about that picture?” he suddenly piped up and all three heads turned to him. He felt his face flush and with his free hand, he rubbed at the back of his neck. “Er, I mean, has he gotten it yet?”
“He’s really turned this place into a dream, hasn’t he?” Theo turned to look at her when she spoke and offered a small smile. She really did look so much like her father. It never failed to keep him on edge when he talked with her.
“Now, now, ladies. We’re all on the same side here and more than happy to have anyone who can help,” Andromeda chastised them. Greg gave Lavender a reassuring squeeze and dropped a kiss to the top of her head again.
“That sounds wonderful!” Daphne cooed. “You know, I’ve heard so much about your dragons. It’s about time I see them for myself. Surely you have room for one more?”
With as much alcohol as had been flowing through them, the group was easy to distract. But Malfoy didn’t tear his dark grey gaze away from Harry and Harry couldn’t quite keep his own gaze anywhere else for long. And every time he caught a glimpse of Malfoy’s bouncing heeled foot out of the corner of his eye, he couldn’t stop himself from wondering if the skin of Malfoy’s ankle would be soft beneath his lips or of the idea of tucking the heel just over his shoulder while Malfoy lay spread out in front of him. Harry was
“Er, Auntie Pans?” Pansy groaned. Not a perfect stranger, then.
Harry just watched the exchange with interest. Lily seemed almost nervous and Vic was looking at Daphne with the same narrowed eyes the brunette had studied him with earlier. Harry knew Lily was up to something. Now, he wondered if Draco might be too.
“Well Luna says Hermione finally figured it out. I sent her a letter this morning, but she’ll likely be here before her reply.”
playing Mamma Mia, you have to get out there and stop her!” Before Daphne could protest, Draco was pushing his friend out the kitchen door and into the dining room. Benny used the opportunity to soar through the open door.
When Harry had last been on the island Kalokairi, the population had been roughly two thousand. With the growth of its vineyards and tourism over the last twenty years, the population had more than doubled and was now far closer to five, or so the young Greek bloke manning the Villa Ariadne information desk had told him that morning. Surprised as he had been at the time, the increased number of unfamiliar buildings and homes had confirmed the news during his journey around the island. It had been nice to get lost among the new streets, to let the feeling of the island’s magic wash over him in a way a muggle neighborhood never would and yet without the interruption of strangers only Muggle London still brought him.
“What are you doing here?” Draco asked at the same time as Harry inquired, “How’s Lily doing?” Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed.
“It’s totally fine–
“So…the Dragon Tamer went and tamed our dragon, did he?”
“You’re shitting me.”
big, like Lily’s engagement. Because he noticed a pattern with his on-again off-again friend – every time Lily reached another milestone, that seemed to be about when communication would decrease and ultimately fall away. Draco couldn’t fathom why, except that maybe Theo was hurt because Draco was still lying to him. He always waited for Theo to ask again when they started talking, but he never did.
“Really? You mean that?” Charlie grinned.
Vic was almost certain that Harry didn’t know. Charlie’s answering smile was almost knowing. Almost.
“I showed Nott to his room. I thought you might want to say hello.” Draco cleared his throat.
.” Vic ran her hands down her sides, making sure everything was straight, and then squared her shoulders. She glanced back at Teddy with narrowed eyes. “Don’t you dare tell Lily about this. I wouldn’t want to get her hopes up.” Then she looked forward and began striding back to their suite.
, he thought.
“Harry,” the darker man whispered this time. Draco scoffed.
“I dare you to put on your favorite shoes,” Parkinson had practically purred. Malfoy’s face had flushed a deeper shade and Harry had to look down at his lap as, unbidden, images of Malfoy in nothing but those red heels came to mind.
“Nope!”
“Not quite worth what it’s doing to my hotel,” Draco drawled and everyone laughed again.
“Blue since the day we parted,” Benny crooned as he swept his wings along the door.
“You’re no bother, Harry. You know that. What’s going on?”
“You must be so happy to have us fighting over you again,” Daphne sighed and Draco smirked.
. The box also contained an old wand that looked like it hadn’t been used for years, a few newspaper clippings, and a scattering of photographs from when Lily’s father was pregnant with her.
“No, Oliver and I were never really that close. Even if we did play together on the quidditch team for a few years, he was always closer to Percy.”
Malfoy’s grey eyes nervously scanned the gathered students of the common room, before settling on Harry. He must have seen something in the way that Harry was drinking him in because the blonde’s gaze grew dark and hungry. Harry could feel the fluttering in his stomach, could hear his heart beating loudly in his ears, and even though he and Malfoy had still hardly talked this semester (though that was starting to change), he wanted nothing more than to drag the blonde back up those stairs and into their shared room.
“I don’t know.”
“Homemade Bolognese, your favorite,” Ron told her as he walked back to the stove, stirring the sauce. “You know, the kids are with mum. So that means we have the house
“Benny, shut up!” Draco hissed, wrapping his arms tightly against the bird to keep his wings still.
“It wasn’t that simple.”
“Well then don’t pretend you understand the choices that
“I was more afraid they would try to take her away,” Draco muttered against the pillow. “I didn’t want…I couldn’t lose her. I couldn’t.”
“Me? You’re buying flowers. In Greece!”
What the hell are the men doing here?” Draco’s voice echoed into his microphone, suddenly breaking the connection between them. Harry blinked and stood up from the bar, making to move forwards or
“I know,” Pansy managed to get out between giggles. A few more bursts of laughter and she managed to get herself under control. She wiped the tears of laughter from her eyes and smirked at the bright red boy standing beside her. With a gentle shake of her head, she stood up from the lounge and pushed him aside. She began to gather her things, slipping a lace cover over her bathing suit.
“Yes. We’ve talked, but…”
“That’s not an excuse,” Victoire huffed, finally letting her go. Lily grinned up at her, green eyes sparkling.
The Villa Ariadne hosted a large kitchen with enough cooking and prepping space for a dozen chefs, even if it was only Greg and his two line cooks. It was a hub of activity most of the day – magic flowing over the tables and between the ovens as vegetables chopped themselves and pots stirred on their own – but even more so now with the impending wedding. Greg was busy hustling around his kitchen, only pausing to give one of his cooks instructions, while Daphne sat in a chair out of the way, her attention divided between her business emails and her blonde friend who was currently glued to the dining room doors. Draco was peering through the window, his gray eyes continually scanning the growing breakfast crowd. Daphne set her phone down in her lap so she could really look at her friend. He was dressed in a pair of jeans and a pale blue button-down shirt today, his long hair pulled back into his now trademark messy bun. Daphne watched her friend chew on his bottom lip, his brow slightly furrowed, before he turned his head to her and opened his mouth to speak.
“Is this all for the wedding?” a voice broke the silence. Greg looked up, holding the clipboard out to the gentleman from the boat.
“It’s been twenty years. We’re really doing this?” Draco watched Harry shrug this time.
Harry said his goodnights and then floo’d back home. He still had to set up the boys’ rooms and route his way into London for pickup. But his whiskey glass was still full. So with another sigh, he sat back down at his desk and began to trace the delicate gold lettering again. The boys wouldn’t be home until the late afternoon, after all.
“No, it’s not that…You know, I’d have loved a daughter. I’d have spoiled her to bits.”
“Hello, Daphne,” Harry spoke into the following silence and Daphne turned to him with a small smile, her gaze narrowed slightly as she studied his ragged appearance.
~ ~ ~
“You’re right,” he said. “But I’d like to.” Lily’s brows rose in surprise this time. Then her eyes narrowed as she studied his face.
“I’m just here for my book,” Harry said quickly. He snatched the potions book up off his desk where he had left it and then immediately spun around, practically running from the room.
“Why? You’re Uncle Theo.” Greg turned away to survey the movement as Nott came to a stop beside him.
“Do you even know if he knows about you?” Alex asked, his body tensing. Lily reached up to set her hands on his, twining their fingers as he clutched her shoulders tighter. “I know how important this is; I’ve
“She’s still trying to find her ‘something old,’ but she’s never been happier. I can’t believe I’m saying this, but that boy may actually be okay.” Daphne and Pansy both laughed. That was high praise coming from their blonde friend.
“Well, I reckon he probably feels as though he didn’t,” a voice interrupted them and the table turned to look up at the easy smile of Charlie Weasley. Lily scooted in closer to Vic, but the redhead dropped two full plates to the table and pulled up a chair instead.
~ ~ ~
“I’m not
“What’s he told you?”
Teddy laughed and pulled his cousin into a hug, ruffling her hair as his curled to match. The pair leaned back after and looked quietly up at the stars. Lily was the first in the Black family line in generations to not be named after a constellation. When she was six, her and Teddy had made one up. The flower looked down at them now and Teddy smiled into the comfortable silence.
“Give you away?”
“Can I take my shoes off now, Potter?” Malfoy mumbled into Harry’s shoulder and Harry laughed. He managed enough strength to lean down and pull the heels off, giving each of Malfoy’s feet a gentle squeeze as he did.
“Did you pack your bathing suit?”
“Never!”
When Draco was six months pregnant, he finally told Theo. He hadn’t wanted to say anything even then, but it was getting harder and harder for Adrianne to keep the news to herself when most of her life was being impacted by it. Theo had been shocked speechless, but he still seemed to have done the math in his head because his first words out of the fire were, “Is she mine?”
, he thought with a huff.
,” Nico cast, and the odd trio watched in amazement as a gentle flow of ice swirled out of tip of his wand and began to surround the now docile dragon lying calmly on the ground. Slowly, but surely a thick block of ice formed around Geronimo until he was completely encased. When the spell was finished, Lily reached out and pressed her hand against the ice in front of Geronimo’s snout, a sad smile on her face.
The next week and a half passes by in a blur with Draco focusing on nothing except for pottery and Pansy. Soon, Draco is on his 6th lesson with Harry, and he’s feeling much better about his own pottery. Even though nothing has been quite perfect yet, he has some creations that are pretty damn close.
“I’m absolutely awful, Pansy. I don’t know how many times you need me to tell you this until you finally understand.” Draco has been ranting to Pansy ever since the two of them woke up after their night at The Hog’s Head.
As Draco nears the shop, he catches sight of someone smoking out front. He’s never had the urge to smoke before, but he has always had a strange fascination with watching others smoke. He stops at the corner of the street, watching the smoker, barely out of their sight. He watches as the mystery person brings the cigarette back up to their mouth before breathing the smoke back out. Draco stares for a little while longer before looking down at his watch and realizing he should head to the shop so he can look around at Harry’s pieces before his lesson with Harry actually begins.
So that's what brought him here to Potter's Pottery. He can’t help but roll his eyes at the shop’s name. The owner was an artist, and aren’t artists supposed to be artistic and creative? Nevertheless, he continues into the shop. Draco makes his way around the shop slowly. He wants to admire all the pieces of work that obviously took a long time to create. He drags his fingers across some of them, admiring the artwork on the outside as well as the structure itself. He goes through pretty much the entire shop before he continues to make his way towards the empty counter at the back. Draco looks around for a minute, checking to see if there was anybody here that could help him. He hadn’t seen anyone during his self tour of the store, so he finally decides to ring the bell that’s sitting next to the register.
“He did.”
“Nine am tomorrow, sir,” she chirped. His face fell. He supposed he could get a hotel for the night, get here bright and early instead. But he was so excited, so eager to get to the island and…meet the bride. The ticket clerk must have seen something in his face because she pointed towards a small boat still docked and only just starting to get ready to leave. “You can always try him – said he was going to Kalokairi when he rented the whole boat.”
“Since when did you know so much about genetic magic?” Oh bother.
Harry wasn’t sure how, but one moment he was dancing very poorly with his arms in the air and the next a small hand was clasped tightly around his wrist and tugging him to a vacant area by the bar. When Harry looked down at who was dragging him away from the throng of party goers, he was surprised to find that it was none other than Lily looking up at him with a grin and wide green eyes.
“You’ve been scanning the door, haven’t you?” Draco asked as he laid eyes on his friend. Theo just smiled at him and shrugged, tucking his wand away.
“What about the–”

“Is everyone ok?” he asked, approaching the group. They looked to him and all began talking at once. He let out a sigh of relief. They were all perfectly fine.
Draco stood apart from his backup, Daphne and Pansy swaying behind him in time with the music. When Draco closed his eyes and smiled, Harry was certain that his heart stopped. He knew when he left Kalokairi twenty years ago that he was making the biggest mistake of his life, but he felt it most acutely tonight.
