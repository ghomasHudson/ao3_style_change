And the older teenager turns slightly, tears streaming down his cheeks, but a wry smile on his pretty face. His robes are open, but with no shirt inside, revealing the ropey scars left by Harry in the bathroom.
Harry doesn’t need to be persuaded to save anyone, he’s already running. The teenager clutches the broomstick between his fist and scrambles to reach the astronomy tower, the staircases arranging themselves in help. He trips his way up the last staircase, his haste bruising his toes. Harry bursts through the astronomy doors, and into the sun. There is an artificial sun gleaming in the sky, only visible from the inside of the tower, bathing the balcony in light.
Draco’s eyes glitter as he dances with his amazing partner. They both smell like gingerbread batter, the dried batter on their clothes. The apartment smells like Christmas, the large green tree shines in the corner of the house room and stockings hang beside it. Draco tells Harry later that he wished he could’ve take a photo of his life at that moment. That he'd never been so lucky.
It took two weeks for Harry to realize that there wasn’t a lack of girls pining after him. Every corner he turned, there was another girl, big eyes watching his every move.
Breakfast is easy without Draco. They almost never ate the first meal of the day together. Draco would leave the house earlier than Harry, grabbing a cup of coffee from the cafe around the corner, and Harry would eat a bowl of oatmeal and leave half an hour later.
Draco waits for his name, head tilted as he watches Pansy be paired (with Granger), and then Blaise (with Smith), and finally, “Malfoy and Weasley!” Vargas orders. Draco watches as Weasley groans, and Potter pats him on the back before joining his own partner.
“What?” Draco says, immediately confused. “No, he’s not. He looks like a drowned rat half the time.”
and a new one! it took me a little longer to write because i lost the thread, but that's alright! it's here. if u left a comment, that would make my day :)
He doesn’t tell Pansy or Blaise about it. It was embarrassing enough that Potter knew he needed tutoring, but Draco thought he’d never survive the shame of telling his friends. It simply didn’t matter that the two of them had seen him at his worst (crying after multiple nightmares), nor that they’d seen him fail in class, but the fact that
been months since everything went down. And I’m sure he’s trying to move on. I can’t see you two being friends, though.”
Harry smiles back and it reaches his eyes; tiredness or not, Draco’s smiles are the highlights of his day and he would do anything to keep them on his face. Draco hops off the island counter and makes his way towards Harry, and when Draco reaches Harry’s slumping and tired figure, he simply runs his knuckles across Harry’s cheekbone. Draco takes the bag off Harry’s shoulder and the suit jacket off the other, used to the late nights and what Harry needs. Draco whispers to him, “There’s pasta on the table, take a shower after. If you’re still up, I want to hear about your day.”
“I’ll go first then. My godfather died six months ago. He was all I had left. He’d promised to take me from the Dursleys, but that’s moot point now. My parents are dead, but I guess that’s old news. I’ve got a prophecy that says I can't live if Voldemort's dead. If I’m not jumping off, I don't think you can.” Harry's out of breath in the end, his chest hurting and eyes wet.
And there’s more tears. Draco bawls silent sobs, and Harry is at his side in a flash. Harry's arms envelop him, and Draco's crying uncontrollable sobs into Harry's chest. The last time they’d seen Narcissa, she’d made Coq au Vin. That was three years ago. Narcissa had died suddenly, a heart attack in the bathroom late at night, no goodbyes. It had been hard for Draco for a long time, and he’d only bounced back a little over a year and a half ago.
“Pansy? Seriously?” He hisses, jerking his chin at Draco. Draco stares confusedly at the two of them, as Pansy rolls her eyes and plops down beside Draco on his bed.
, I’m just not going to waste my time with you!” Draco snarls. His loud voice attracts the attention of some of the corridor, immediately starting whispers. Draco glances around at the stares, grabs Potter’s arm, and drags him into an empty classroom. Potter’s eyes widen, but allows himself to be taken, stumbling as he goes.
Holding up his hands, Harry says, “wait here. I’ll be right back!” Malfoy crosses his arms and glares. Harry jogs out of the empty classroom, feet hitting the ground as he goes.
“You’re probably right,” Harry says, laughing a little. He waves to her and leaves the common room, waving to a few giggling girls in the corner. They blow him kisses, and he mimes catching them, pressing them to his heart. The girls squeal as he exits the room, and Harry has to hold in another laugh when he hears Hermione’s groan.
this fic is very loosely based upon the song ‘heather’ by conan gray. i’m a sad writer and honestly tried not to make this too sad, so bear with me as i try to create fake happiness :)
Draco frowns at his friends, unsure of what to say. Blaise is disinterested, as always, and Pansy has too much interest.
Pansy snorts and pats Draco on the shoulder comfortingly. She turns to Blaise, “good job with that. So subtle.”
Draco spins to face Potter, minutely shaking his head at the younger student. Potter eyes Draco and then Vargas, glancing back and forth before biting his lip and nodding.
He’s dissolving. He doesn’t realize it, but everyone else does. There is nothing they can do. Draco was his life line, his life force, his sun. Without Draco, it’s all Harry could do to wilt in his absence.
And then Harry has an idea. Draco’s mixing batter for the cookies and Harry grabs the wooden spoon from him. It drips batter on the floor and Draco sputters at Harry.
He finds her surrounded by people, laughing loudly, her hair a mess from a little third-year braiding it.
Weasley sends the first spell, it’s fiery and aggressive. Draco throws a Protego to halt it and can feel the wrath of Professor Vargas already on him, “Malfoy! use the counterspell, not Protego!”
“Mr. Potter! What have you done?” Slughorn exclaims as he hurries over, wand out of his robes, and points it at Harry. He makes a few slashing movements with it, and the boiling liquid vanishes from Harry's face, leaving only burn marks. The ruined skin sits above Harry’s cheekbones and around his lips, dug into his cheeks and forehead, the skin red and tender. his brown skin is wrinkled and already itchy.
Harry slices his finger with the knife and blood begins to leak from the shallow wound. Ron glances over at him before tossing the recently chopped beetroots into the cauldron. Wincing, Harry picks up his wand and touches it to his finger, closing the wound with a quick spell. It’s then he realizes that the roots he’d been cutting his knife were bloodied, and then thrown into the cauldron. He leans over the cauldron, face above the fumes as if to see the roots thrown in. He breathes into the pot. Harry feels almost responsible for what happens next.
Draco looked down at his checklist. “Booking the room, the invitations, decorations for the tree and room. And music.”
“What are you doing here, Malfoy?” Harry asked, annoyance clear in his voice. He gestured in the direction where the other Aurors had departed. “We were in the middle of something.”
It had been a long time since Draco had contemplated a romantic relationship with anyone. But him and Potter? Why would people believe they were a couple? Especially anyone who knew their history. Unless Granger knew more than she was letting on. Had Potter really told her it was a date? Did Potter want to go on a date him?
Draco watched as Harry sliced his fish and took his first bite. He barely moved his jaw before he was licking his lips and cutting another piece. Harry looked back up at him and Draco realised he was staring. Quickly he picked up his own cutlery and started to cut his steak. “How's your fish?”
Ron fetched a gold coin from his pocket. “Unofficially, Harry’s been checking in with us, well Hermione and I, via these. He has one that is linked to this with a protean charm. They’re set to display the same date and time. Harry’s been changing the date and times to his expected check-in when he’ll update the time again. Sometimes it’s been every day and other times there have been a few days between changes. It’s not much, but it’s enough to know he’s alright.”
what he was writing about? Although, maybe he should he tell Draco he was planning to testify for him.
“Well then, how about I give you a few extra lessons over the holidays so you can practice a bit more?”
“Yeah, but that was just civilised conversation, small talk. How would he have learned anything from that other than that while we both follow the leagues, we have very different opinions on who is good and who isn’t.”
“It’s nothing to do with my family, is it?” Draco couldn’t help himself. It wouldn’t be the first time Harry had investigated something connected to the Malfoy name.
“It was only on the cheek, but I see your point. She probably forgot we were still in public and was just excited you’d agreed to move in with me. She knew how much it meant to me.” Harry smiled fondly at the memory.
Draco spent the first half of Sunday writing the invitations for all the Muggle guests as well as for his colleagues. The second half of the day he spent sorting through all the old Malfoy Christmas ornaments. He cleaned or transfigured them, then practiced arranging them on a Christmas tree and around one of the small lounge rooms in the Manor that was roughly the size of the pub’s function room.
Albus dumped his bags in his room upstairs before coming back down to use the fireplace. Harry wandered into the kitchen to give him a bit of perceived privacy, but was keenly listening in to see if he was mentioned.
“How many times must I ask you to call me Minerva, Harry?” McGonagall asked as she finished off what she had been writing and looked up at him.
Harry found himself in Hermione’s office the following afternoon at their regular monthly catch-up meetings.
Working around the pulsating member, he licked down the side of Harry’s groin to find his sensitive inner thigh and pushed his legs apart to gain better access. Holding the other man’s knees, he explored with his mouth, enjoying the desperate sounds and involuntary twitches he was causing. Looking up at his partner, he was pleased to see the strong arms had stayed where he’d left them and it appeared as though Harry had been gripping the armrest to anchor himself during Draco’s assault.
When he asked at the desk on the Third Floor, he was met with, “I’m sorry Mr. Potter, but Healer Malfoy is extremely busy right now. Maybe you could come back during his dinner break.”
Draco recalled all five function rooms they had seen that afternoon. (There had been two in one of the pubs.) The first one stuck out the most in his memories. “I think I favour the first location,” he told Potter. “But I’d like to taste their food before I make a commitment. Care to join me for dinner?”
“Narcissa saved me given the opportunity. I don’t think Lucius would have done the same. He deserves whatever he gets.”
Harry made himself look away from Draco and the other wizard and back to Ron. “No, it's okay. We can finish our tea.”
“You are when it comes to computers,” Potter stated matter-of-factly. Draco glared at him, but Potter didn’t seem fazed. “Don’t worry, there are a lot of Muggles who don’t know much about computers.”
“Yes. And Draco seemed very disheartened by that prospect when I approached him about it. So… I was wondering... is there any way to..err...soften the blow?”
“Now that you mention it, I hadn't really noticed any difference in the decorations,” said Harry. “Only, there was always a lot of mistletoe at the wizarding celebrations I was invited to after leaving Hogwarts.”
Draco lent forward, closing the gap between their faces so their noses were touching. “I wouldn’t dare.”
Draco schooled his face and pulled out his wand. "You can hardly blame me, Potter." He gently placed the tip of his wand at the top of Harry's dislocated shoulder. "Now, there will be a sharp pain as the bone slides back into place, but it should be over in a second or two. Also, I'm going to need you to let go of your arm."
They turned left twice before they reached the first pub on Draco’s list. He pushed open the door and made his way to the bar. Harry followed his lead. Draco caught the bartender’s attention and removed his gloves and scarf while they waited for the bartender to make his way over.
The morning of Christmas Eve came and went without any news of Harry from the Ministry. Draco was debating with himself about whether to go to Harry or not. Maybe he should owl Ron directly for news? No, that would take too long. And what if an owl was already on its way to him?
But part of him knew it wasn't really that easy between them. There was so much history, not to mention what the rest of the wizarding world might think if their saviour wanted to shack up with a former Death Eater. Their time together on Saturday had been rather amicable and Draco would go as far as to say it had been enjoyable, but it hadn't been a date… had it?
“Since you trust me,” Draco smirked. “And since she saw me eyeing you while the two of you were dancing before her speech.”
On Monday, Draco’s first and only priority was delivering the party invitations. He left envelopes with the invites on each of his colleagues' desks before leaving the Ministry to visit the Muggle guests at the British Library and the Daily Telegraph. He personally delivered their invitations as he wanted to securing their RSVPs as fast as possible. Most of them were delighted and while a few already had other commitments, they thanked him for the invitation.
He hadn't seen or had any words from Harry by Tuesday and he was starting to worry. Passing by Hermione’s desk on his way to lunch, he decided to ask her for any news.
Harry lowered his mug and his face held a begrudging smirk. “Madam Malkin’s still not back from her holiday then?”
Panting softly from the effort, Draco leaned on Harry’s back, listening to Harry catching his breath as well.
Madam Malkin returned with a navy blue fabric that looked like what may make up the lining of Harry’s Auror robes. She sat down again to sketch out the pattern from the measurements her tape gave her.
“Hmm… That’s not such a bad idea. He does owe me for covering his arse, after all. Since Weasel would be useless in this case, I’ll have to think of another way for him to pay me back.”
“I’m aware of that, Potter. No need to state the obvious.” Draco had become more and more irritated at his own lack of knowledge about the Muggle way of life as the day had gone on. He was sure Potter was using every opportunity he found to rub it in his face. Draco continued to remind himself that Harry had grown up as a Muggle and knew far less about the wizarding world than he did.
This time Harry’s taken aback. He hadn’t expected a response like that, rather just a clear answer. Weren’t girls supposed to be easy to talk to? Granted, Hermione never was, but Ginny had always been like refreshing water after a dry day.
“You read,” Draco responds flippantly, and buries himself in his own Potions book, attempting to prepare for the next day’s material. Potter is quiet, and out of the corner of Draco’s eye, he sees the other boy frowning into the book. A few minutes pass, and while Draco’s highlighting sections in his textbook, it seems as if Potter hasn’t read a single word. Draco can hear Potter muttering under his breath, but the other student hasn’t flipped a single page.
this is the first of many parts. because the chapters are short, i may think about combining the whole story into one long chapter to make it easier.
“Because you’re pretty, and I’d like to get to know you,” he responds, relishing the pretty pink blush that spreads over Su’s cheeks.
And it goes on like this, just as it had before. Malfoy casts a spell, Harry casts the same, and Malfoy tries again, injecting as much power into the spell as he can. Sometimes it goes badly, but sometimes it works.
“I’m not nervous,” Harry says defensively and pushes Hermione’s legs forward so he can sit at the edge of the couch. “I haven’t taught anyone since the D.A. and, well, I don’t want to do a shit job.”
He’s got two hours until Defense tutoring and Draco is nervous. He’s not sure why, but he thinks it’s got something to do with the fact that Draco is so terrible at Defense. Even the thought of raising his stupid (borrowed from his mom) wand, seems to send a wave of nervous energy through his bones. And he knew he’d done a shit job “tutoring” Potter, but he hasn’t been able to muster anything better. Hopefully, Potter would do the same tonight and relieve Draco of any leftover guilt.
“How did he defeat the Dark Lord if he can’t even make a simple potion?” Pansy whispers harshly at his side. She continues to mutter in Draco’s ear as he chops his own beetroots. He rolls his eyes at her, “You’re just jealous because he won’t speak to you after you botched your apology.”
Harry’s head snaps up, “Right!” He accios, “Draco Malfoy’s wand,” and it comes flying out of the trunk, landing in Harry’s outstretched hand. Nodding, he thanks Ron, ignoring his prior words, and dashes from the room.
There are two steaming bowls on the dinner table, and the music has been turned down. Harry Styles plays softly in the background. Draco’s sitting at the table already, bobbing his head to music and typing on his phone. He doesn’t glance up when Harry gets to the table and continues to rapidly type out some message. There’s no need for any theatrics, they’ve been together long enough for Harry to dig into the food as Draco types.
Harry looked at the clock on the wall. He supposed Ron could handle things in the office for another hour or two. “Err… I guess I shouldn’t keep you waiting any longer.”
“Draco Malfoy, please stand,” said the Chief Warlock. “While you are guilty of being a Death Eater, the evidence points to you being a minor at the time of induction as well as under duress. Taking other events into consideration, it has been decided you need not spend any time in Azkaban but shall be given a good behaviour trace and serve a years community service, to commence after your graduation from Hogwarts.”
He was sitting in his usual spot at the tea house on what was a busy Friday morning when he next saw Draco. He watched him walk in and straight to the counter to order his usual before going to sit at the window with his back to Harry.
“What do I get Harry for Christmas? I know he doesn’t really value big expensive gifts and he seems to have everything he really needs or wants.”
“I could let you borrow my laptop. It has all the music on it and I suppose I can teach you how to use it if you want,” Harry offered. “It's not too hard.”
“Yes, a week,” Draco repeated. “Granger pointed out you have sufficient experience with Muggles, so--”
“I better do it since we have to use Muggle money.” Harry pushed his chair back as he stood, then strode over to the bar.
He felt Harry’s lips crash down on his mouth. His eyes fell shut as he returned Harry’s kiss. Their lips moved together as if they were kissing for the hundredth or even the thousandth time. Finally, Harry pulled away. It was the best kiss Draco had ever experienced.
“What position? Seeker, like you were for Slytherin?” Harry asked, obviously ignoring Draco’s snide remark.
“Well, I was there and it wasn't a date.” Draco walked off. He didn’t not want to debate the matter with Hermione.
“Hmmm, definitely doesn’t.” Draco was a little shocked they were agreeing on something. He looked back down at the parchment. “What’s today’s date?”
Draco could hardly believe it. “Honestly, Potter?” he asked. He refused to believe Granger had told him the truth. He needed Harry to say it.
"You've been obsessed with each other for years, which I'm sure that list can attest to, but the way he is looking at you has changed."
“Ouch,” said Draco, placing a hand to his heart in mock pain. “No need to keep bringing that up. I wasn’t asking for details, just what’s in the paper.”
“No, it doesn’t,” Harry said firmly. He lifted his head off the couch to offer Draco his green eyes and his expression was tired and pleading. “Now, will you please drop it already?”
A Daily Prophet dropped in front of him and he automatically unfolded it to see what garbage it was sprouting that day. There had been articles on many of Voldemort’s supporters, including the Malfoys, for several weeks after the end of the war and while some of the information in the articles was factual much of it was exaggerated and based on assumptions. At least they had ceased to be front page news, with articles on the trials now within the first few pages. Two pages in, Harry spotted an article titled "Malfoys set to face the Wizengamot".
As he progressed in preparing Harry, Draco leant down to capture his lover’s lips and was overwhelmed by the passionate force behind the kiss. It made him yearn to be thrusting inside Harry as he was snogging him for everything that he was worth. Draco wanted to have his dick where his fingers currently were and there was only one way to make that happen.
“I’m sorry Mr Malfoy,” Avalon said, maintaining her calm. “I assure you we will inform you when Mr Potter has made contact.”
Their tea came and Ron began debriefing him about a case he'd recently closed. They finished their first cup and the topic changed to updates on family and friends. Harry poured himself a second cup and heard the door open as he replaced the small pot on the table. Looking up he saw a brown haired wizard he didn't recognise followed by one he knew all too well.
“Umm…” Harry gave a slight look back towards the Headmistress, who was obviously listening to the conversation.
When Draco thought Harry was loose enough, he spelled more lube onto his throbbing erections and gradually pushed his way inside until he was fully seated. He knew Harry was ready for him to move when his hips nudged back into his own and heard Harry’s whispered, “Please, Draco.”
The sixteenth came and Harry arrived at the Ministry early for the trial. He had his invisibility cloak in his bag so he could hide under it in the stands and not be disturbed after he had given his evidence. As the first few hours of the trial past and he waited to give his evidence, Harry kept reminding himself he was doing the right thing and that, while Draco might not appreciate it straight away, he would thank him someday.
As it came towards Harry, it was flying a bit too low for comfort and everyone was ducking or moving out of its way. Harry stepped back and his foot landed in a puddle of punch making it slip out from under him, causing him to fall back and hit the back of his head on the bar. He blinked and felt his body hit the ground before everything went black.
“Oh come on, Weasley. You can’t expect me to just keep sitting around hoping Harry is okay when I know you have more information than you’re telling me. Now, what’s happening?”
At the start of the school year McGonagall had surprised Harry when she’d announced to all the teachers that the new Potions Master would be none other than Draco Malfoy.
Draco's eyes looked shocked, but the rest of his face was schooled into nonchalant. He gave a couple of slow blinks as he seemed to study Harry. Then he finally looked away and almost whispered, "You’re right."
The next morning, Harry made sure to don the invisibility cloak before getting into the elevator to go down to the courtrooms. He wasn’t sure how much more evidence still needed to be heard. As the day unfolded, Harry began to understand just how many people were aggrieved with Lucius Malfoy. He watched as the fight in Lucius slowly withered away while Narcissa and Draco seemed to be preparing for the worst. By the end of day four, the Chief Warlock declared they had heard from all the parties that had come forward to testify and the Wizengamot would adjourn to give their verdict the following morning.
“I kept thinking of you camping out somewhere in the cold while you were away. It’s hand-knit using a hand-dyed alpaca and silk blend, so it will be warm and soft on your neck.”
Once he thought the last child had left, he quietly opened the door and stepped inside the classroom. He took a step forward and stopped when he heard sobbing coming from the front of the room.
Hearing Potter say his given name was rare enough but hearing it said in such a polite tone made Draco glance sideways to confirm it was in fact Harry Potter who had spoken.
With the Christmas holidays fast approaching, I’d like to extend an invitation to our celebrations to our Muggle friends at the Daily Telegraph and The British Library. I need you to organise the invitations and a strictly non-magical celebration to be held on Friday 15th December. I’ve attached the guest list for you.
Draco finished making up the small pot of tea and turned in Harry’s arms, lacing his hands at the small of Harry's back. “One thing I’ll never understand about you is your reluctance to be promoted.” He leant in to place a quick kiss on Harry’s lips.
“Shut up, Malfoy.” There was no malice in the words like there used to be. Instead, Harry seemed embarrassed and almost playful.
Ron shrugged. “Body language. The way you look into each other’s eyes or are constantly checking him out. You’re staring at him right now mate, it’s not exactly subtle. I’m actually surprised no one has speculated about it in The Prophet yet.”
“So… I'll let you know Thursday morning if I found anyone to deal with the music for the party,” Harry said as they rose from the table.
“Ah, good.” Draco had expected Potter to choose the chicken, but it was important that they checked the quality of the fish..
“So far, so good. But we still need to see about the food and the options for decorations. We can’t have the room looking this plain. And then there is the matter of the entertainment,” Draco was glad to be able to talk about something he knew. “A band might be too much for this small space. Gramophone perhaps?” Why Potter was laughing? There was nothing funny about what he had said.
“So what if I am, Potter.” It was Draco’s turn to look away. There was no hiding it now. “Nevermind. Forget I asked.”
He tried to busy himself by decorating around the house and wrapping the present he'd had actually made for Harry to help pass the time. The things you could do when you were trying to keep your hands busy and distract yourself. But with every minute that ticked by, Draco's fear of something happening to Harry and not being able to spend Christmas with him increased.
Draco turned back to the half decorated Christmas tree and his bag of ornaments. He enchanted them as he had practiced in the Manor. The tree was finished in a few short minutes. Even the lights had been untangled. Draco turned his attention to the rest of the room.
Harry was determined to give evidence at the Malfoy trials. He had saved Draco from the fiendfyre for a reason and he wasn’t about to let him wither away in Azkaban because of his parents choices. Harry believed actually becoming a Death Eater and seeing first hand what it entailed had changed Draco’s perspective on the propaganda Lucius had filled his head with while he was growing up.
Hermione gave him a pointed glare, then shook her head and turned sharply on her heels and walked out.
A few minutes later, he heard rustling coming from the grass. He looked down to see indents forming and disappearing in the shape of footsteps. Harry was pacing.
Draco held back his instinctive objection, because he knew that Potter wanted him to object.  Instead he asked, “Did you want to order or shall I?”
“As you wish.” She got up and pulled out the top drawer of the filing cabinet to the right of her desk. Draco watched her flick through the folders inside for a few seconds before she pulled out one of them. She perused the parchment inside. “Well, I can confirm that your relationship with Mr Potter was verified by a Ms Granger and a Mr Weasley, so that is all in order. However the Office is yet to receive any correspondence from Mr Potter, classified or otherwise. It doesn’t seem like he’s made contact at all since he left.”
Harry didn't respond. It was a little too close to the truth. For whatever reason, he'd always found some enjoyment in watching Draco and was intrigued by how he did things. Plus, he had a bloody good reputation as a Healer. He supposed having known him since he found out he was a wizard also added to the level of comfort he felt. It had nothing to do with the fact that he harboured feelings for the pompous git.
“You owe me,” Draco stated bluntly, remembering he didn’t really have time to waste, either, no matter how fun it was to play with Potter’s head.
Draco stopped thinking and closed the gap between himself and Harry, then he smashed their lips together. The kiss was brief. Draco pulled away before Harry could fully register what he had done.
“...Thanks once again for a wonderful year and I look forward to the one to come. Now please enjoy a taste for the fireworks that will help us bring in the New Year.”
“But she was a Huffle-hey!” Harry had kicked him harder this time and Draco had almost spilt his tea. He was about to berate his partner when recognised the stern look in his eyes. He bowed his head. “Sorry.”
“If you expect me to tell you what to get your own boyfriend for Christmas then think again. He’d spot a gift I thought of a mile away. You need to find one on your own.”
“Oi,” exclaimed Ron as he slapped his hand on the table and pushed himself up from his seat. “You better not do anything stupid to jeopardise the case or Harry’s safety.”
Draco had to remove five clusters of Dark magic residue; three from different areas of his torso, one from his head and the other from his wand hand.
Harry sighed. “We’ve been here nine hours. According to our sources, she was supposed to receive another shipment of ingredients this morning and all the evidence so far has been linked to this location.”
“I should not tell you things more often,” Harry whispered into Draco’s neck and punctuated it with a kiss.
“Might have been his day off. He won’t like missing the opportunity though. He keeps telling me healing burns was one of the first things he wanted to master when he was doing his training.” There was a small pause before Scorpius continued.
After their plates were taken away, Draco finally gave up and removed the small speaker from his ear. “Thank you, Potter. I can see you have a large selection of Christmas music that would be suitable for us to play at the party. There is only one problem. That’s
By now there were only two days left before Christmas and Draco was desperate to know if Harry was okay and if he’d be home soon. He had hoped it wouldn’t have to come to this, but he had to try.
Draco rolled his eyes, then remembered Harry couldn’t see him. He scanned the area around them. It was a quiet village with one main road leading in and out. The storage shed was near the outskirts, down a narrow winding road. Draco had rigged the area so his wand would tell him if anything came within a thirty foot radius of the shed. He’d also cast a spell that would alert them to any magic being used within the radius. So far, in the nine hours since he’d cast the spell, his wand had remained basically lifeless.
"Do you really believe…?" Hermione left her question unfinished as she followed Harry's line of sight to the Slytherin table, where Harry had found Draco in an animated discussion with a few second years. If he knew about the trial date, he wasn't letting on.
“I really don’t understand what Harry sees in you,” Ron said, continuing to avoid eye contact with Draco, “but somehow you’ve made him happier than I’ve seen him in a long time.”
“Sure, Draco. That’s sound good. I’ll meet you outside then.” It wasn’t the first time they’d used each other’s first names, but it wasn’t very often that they did. Their dinner the week before had been very relaxed and, although Harry wasn’t sure he was ready to let his guard down yet, he was beginning to entertain the thought that Draco might be ready to move on.
“You plan to investigate a magic matter in a Muggle town in your Auror robes?” Draco asked. His question made Harry look down at his attire. “You should probably take the robe off,” Draco suggested. “I presume you have some Muggle clothes underneath?”
“Oh, right.” Draco languidly pulled himself up and out of Harry so he could stand. When he did, Harry turned to face Draco and pulled him into a loving kiss.
Harry started to play nervously with the hair at the back of his head. “I’m sorry. I guess I didn’t think about how worried you would be and I got so caught up in the case. I’ll try to remember to check in regularly the next time I need to go away. But I managed to crack this one this afternoon, so we can go home for Christmas.” Harry grinned and pointed to his packed bags near the doorway.
“So, how many people have you snogged under the mistletoe?” The question was out of Draco’s mouth before he could stop it.
“So you keep saying.” She peered at him through her spectacles, making him feel rather uncomfortable. “How can I help you, Harry?”
“And I don’t understand why she isn’t!” Draco all but shouted. He looked down at the table between them and tried to control his tone, his hands curling into fists. “Given that there has been no word for over three weeks I’d have thought you’d both be mad with worry. Unless…”
“Alright fine. Let’s go Malfoy,” Harry waves his hand at the door behind and leaves the room, sighing all the way through. Malfoy follows, albeit with a little less sighing.
“Bloody hell, Harry, don’t die on me now,” Ron murmurs in Harry's ear, prompting a smile from the struggling boy.
“Okay. Li & Thomas, Longbottom & Macmillan,” Vargas rattles off pairings, making sure to choose people from different houses. This year, only 16 Eighth years had come back. Some classes, like Potions, they were grouped with the Seventh years, but others, like DADA, it was just them.
“Potter. Harry. I need the pain to stop. I need, I need, I need you to save my parents, Harry. They can’t die. They’ll die if you don’t save them.”
Draco looks at the brown hand reaching towards him and sways forward, unsure about his decision now. He'd been so determined, so determined to pitch himself off this tower, to stop that voice in his head from eating him alive. But he’s unsure now, the kindness of his enemy (was he really the enemy?) unsettling.
Ginny bursts into more laughter, and so does Harry, the irony of the situation hitting them both. Entangling their fingers, Harry places their hands on his stomach and sighs.“Thanks, Gin.”
“Alright then. The library for potions tutoring. Let’s see how this goes,” Harry mutters to himself, prepared to complain to Ron and Hermione in the next few minutes.
Malfoy pulls a face, “what an observation. I had no idea,” he spits, already tired of Harry’s company.
“Malfoy!” Weasley shouts as he sees the blond boy fall face-first onto the hardwood floor, missing the mat by inches. Blood spurts from Draco’s nose as he slowly sits back up, pale face flushed a deep red in shame. Professor Vargas looks down at him, disappointed at his lackluster performance.
But Harry pushes past the cloudy exhaustion at the front of his mind and pushes open the crusty apartment door. The strumming of guitar and loud bass meets his ears, the Arctic Monkey’s “Arabella” playing in the background of his apartment. He sees his boyfriend perched on the kitchen island and behind him, a completely clean kitchen. Some days Draco has bursts of energy and goes around cleaning and organizing the apartment (those days are the best for Harry's mental state). A steaming bowl of pasta sits on the counter beside Draco, obviously waiting for Harry. His boyfriend rapidly types on his phone, head bobbing to the rock music all around him. Draco swings his legs to the beat, the swishy fabric of the plaid pajamas he wears following. Draco reaches up to tuck a loose strand of hair behind his ear, and Harry sees Draco’s standard chipped nail polish. Draco paints his nails every week, but they seem to chip a few hours in, leaving him with perpetually old looking nails. This time, they’re a dark orange, contrasting with his pale skin tone. Draco looks up as Harry enters the apartment, a smile gracing his aristocratic features.
Harry approaches the girl and grabs his glasses, setting them on his nose, “this is the… second time I’ve forgotten them?”
Harry laughs too. He hadn’t meant to go off on a tangent, but it seems that Malfoy brings out something in him. Settling back into Ginny’s arms, he says, “His presence isn’t disgusting anymore. And I’m not sure what to do about that.”
“Well, I’m not sure I can answer that,” she says. “But I know that you’ve enough skills to be alright in the world outside of this dusty castle.” She smiles and bumps his shoulder with hers, “and if you don’t, the Muggle world won’t know what’s about to hit them.”
Draco grabs his hand and snatches the spoon from Harry, throwing it into the sink. Draco puts both of Harry’s hands in his own, and they begin to dance. The music envelops them, and there is almost as much laughter as there is music. Harry dips Draco back and spins him around, and Draco does the same to Harry, almost dropping him as Draco dips him down, his hands splayed out on Harry’s back.
“Are you going to tell me why you’re standing there?” Harry pushes, his mind scrambling for a solution. He could send a patronus to McGonagall, but that would spook Malfoy, and Harry decides against it, once again taking the weight of the world onto his own shoulders.
“Harry, there’s truly nothing you can do. Malfoy here has offered to tutor you, and I am happy to have you learn,” Slughorn advises gently.
Ron snorts, “Of course I can. You used to look at him with disgust every day. At least, until he volunteered to tutor you. That’s strange, by the way. So why would you have given his wand back? And Harry, accio the damn wand, you’re a wizard.”
“You may not need the Defense NEWT to pass eighth year, but I’m sure you’re looking for a competent job after Hogwarts, no?”
Harry wakes to the feeling of sunlight on his face. The bright light settles upon his eyes, burning into him. He breathes in the smell of the room, familiar. He curls to the side and pats his hand towards the other side of the bed, attempting to find his lover. Empty sheets and pillows is all he finds. Harry is confused at first. Where has Draco gone? And then it comes back to him in a rush. Harry opens his eyes and sits up quickly, whiplash on his neck, and knees cracking with the speed. Tears gather in his eyes for what feels like the thousandth time and he digs the bottoms of his palms in, as if that would stop the outpouring of grief from his eyes.
Potter smiles a little and begins to explain, “Snape had this potions book. I borrowed it for sixth year by accident. And Merlin was that one of the best ideas I had. Shit’s the only reason I passed Potions.” He snorted, “This reminds me of that.”
“Just a day after the first?” Potter crosses his arms and lifts his brows, openly making fun of Draco’s choice. Draco scoffs and leaves the room, silence following him. It seems a repeat of the day before, Draco leaving Potter behind, fed up with all this conversation with a person he’d never like. Merlin forbid he had a civil conversation with Potter, Draco wasn’t sure what the world would come to.
And as Draco was reaching for the last vestiges of his sanity, he hears a quiet shriek and a giggle from one of the bookstacks. There went his sanity. He knows exactly what the students got up to in the Library stacks (excluding himself, of course) and has no want nor need for finding out which student is huddled back there with their partner. Standing, Draco makes for a quick exit, carefully averting his eyes from what he’s sure to find. Unluckily, he hears a gruff voice shush whatever girl made the giggle, and the familiar voice stops him in his tracks. Draco knew all about Harry Potter’s female conquests, but in the stacks? Really? Draco dips his head past the first stack and immediately eyes the couple, pressed up against the dusty History of Magic textbooks. Potter’s face is buried in the girl’s neck, and she arches up, letting out a soft mewling sound, her face recognizable. Draco leaps back, carefully keeping out of sight. Padma Patil claws at Potter’s back, letting out little noises at
Letting out a shaky breath, Draco refocuses on the book in front of him, circling an ingredient and crossing out the next, listening to Potter breathe as he reads his own textbook.
favorite activity. Although he was terrific at Charms, at Transfiguration, and at Potions, since the end of the war, Draco couldn’t get a hold on any spells in Defense Against the Dark Arts. (he presumed it was because Draco could never have any defense against the dark arts, it was too prominent in his bones) (Pansy promised he was wrong).
Harry nods, “me neither. But if I’ve got to be around him for hours, alone, the wanker and I have to be civil, don’t we?” Letting out a dramatic sigh, he flops onto Ginny’s lap.
And Draco wants to answer now, he wants Potter, Harry, to understand why he wants to throw himself off this godforsaken tower.
Draco wanted to lie. He wanted to deny everything that had happened—he wished so badly that he could rewrite the past.
"Aaand then the two of you snogged each other's faces off," Blaise said knowingly, and Draco flushed. "Ha! I knew it! God, Draco, it is scary how well I know you."
But before Draco could ask any more questions or demand any further information, a heavy hand suddenly clamped down on his shoulder, startling him and causing his head to automatically whip around in surprise. Glancing up a lean body clad in familiar Muggle denims, his wide eyes snapped up to meet the furious green gaze of Harry Potter.
, for Merlin's sake! He sighed as he wondered if people would feel more or less encouraged to continue trying to slip him love potions if he and Ginny had actually gotten back together at the end of the war.
For some reason, that statement stuck in Harry's mind more than the others. Why was that word so bothersome?
! Fuck, please don't stop," Draco babbled mindlessly, knowing he was only seconds away from exploding. In the next breath, he clenched his eyes shut tight as an overwhelming wave of pleasure crashed into him, swept over him, submerging him beneath its heavy weight as he twisted and moaned, Harry holding him in place as his mouth slid to the very tip of Draco's cock, sucking softly as Draco bucked his hips before finally sinking back into the mattress, panting breathlessly. "Fuck, Potter," he murmured, feeling his pulse race as he attempted to catch his breath.
"I can't believe it either," Harry admitted. "I keep wanting to pinch myself to make sure it's not just a dream."
Draco's voice caught in his throat. No, he couldn't tell Seek the truth. He couldn't tell him that Seek already knew exactly who Fenrir was—not only knew him but had fought him that very day as well.
"I'm more soberer than I've ever been in my entire life," Harry proclaimed, holding up one hand in promise and nearly smacking Ginny in the face with it, who laughed even as she punched him on the shoulder again. "Ow!" he cried, rubbing the spot. "Your sister is violent, Won-Won!"
"Don't worry, Potter," Draco grinned, "your future Auror career is safe. Granger and I won't let you get anything less than an O in Potions."
"What does the bike look like?" Draco asked, changing the subject. He did not care to discuss his lack of worth with a stranger, no matter how good-looking the stranger happened to be.
"Relax," the man said, chuckling to himself. "I can handle myself. Besides, I should be in and out before they even realize I was here."
"You think you can just fuck me and everything will be fine again?" Draco pushed at the man's chest, attempting to keep his breathing slow. Panicking would only make everything worse. "Now get the fuck off me right now, Blaise, I fucking mean it!"
"That's not all," Draco whispered, deciding he may as well confess to everything. "I'm seeing the man who dislocated Wolf's arm. He's the same one who stole Wolf's truck. I was there that day; I was the one who let him take it. That's how we met."
"You're not the one in charge here, Potter," Malfoy growled, biting down harshly on the skin between Harry's neck and shoulder, and he cried out in pain and surprise. "I've already told you what to do if you want free."
"Seek," he nodded back, one corner of his mouth tugged up in a rugged smirk, and Harry felt something in his gut tighten at the sight. He knew that he should not be looking at his brothers in such a way, and yet, there was no denying that Oliver was a damn attractive man. Leaning over, Oliver sent the same expression in Ron's direction. "Red."
"You have no idea," Malfoy breathed, staring into Harry's eyes and hypnotizing him with his gaze, "how happy I was to see you walk into the dining room the night of the party. You have no idea, Harry, how happy I was that you accepted the invitation. I was terrified that you would refuse to accept it, or that you would laugh and rip it into pieces. I'm not even sure how to describe the feeling of relief that came over me when I saw you enter the room."
Feeling blank, he walked on numb legs to the armchair Ron had been sitting in and dropped heavily down into the seat, gazing up at them in hollow-eyed expectation. Ron and Hermione exchanged a glance before taking matching deep breaths and sitting on the small sofa across from him.
"Fine," he grumbled despite the fakeness of Potter's expression, wondering just when he had lost the ability to remain angry at Harry-aggravating-Potter.
Steeling himself, he stepped out from behind the bookshelf and marched over to Harry's table, sparing a second to be amused as all three Gryffindors jumped when he suddenly pulled out the chair beside Harry with a loud screech and sat heavily in it, wanting to sigh as three glares were suddenly fixed on him.
"Maybe not a friend," Hermione shook her head. "Maybe it's a connection of a different sort. Maybe a childhood acquaintance, or even a common enemy."
"God, you are definitely not boring," Potter chuckled, squeezing him tighter. "I didn't mean to insult you, Draco, I really didn't. And I definitely didn't mean to embarrass you."
Harry was barely even aware of falling to his knees, only noticing a sharp pain as they connected with the hard floor. "What?" he asked, in a voice that he did not even recognize as his own.
"Okay, yes," Caelix nodded, looking relieved. "I'll see you later, then, P." And with one final lingering glance, Caelix turned and strode away. Harry watched his figure get smaller and smaller until he rounded the corner that led to the grand staircase and he was gone.
"I dunno, Fen," he said, struggling from the man's hold and climbing to his feet. "I really am tired. I haven't been sleeping very well."
Malfoy tilted his head and studied Harry at an angle. "Why not?" he asked finally, and Harry shrugged again.
"It was necessary," Greg shrugged with a glance toward Daphne, his face darkening. "She was barely alive anyway, rotting away in this house every day, afraid of everything, refusing to leave. She died years ago."
"Find out what?" Malfoy breathed, staring at Harry with the most intense pair of eyes Harry had ever had gaze at him.
would be more preferable to the hell his life had become. There had certainly been times he had wished for death, wished the Dark Lord or one of the Death Eaters who had delighted in using him as curse practice would finally follow it with the killing curse. The one Dark spell that Draco could remember not having ever been used on him, and the one that he had nearly prayed for at times.
"No," Crabbe whispered, shaking his head slowly from side-to-side without removing his gaze from Harry's. "No, no, no…no…my son…no…"
"It's no longer your house, I'm afraid," Draco gestured around himself, "this is. This is your home now, Father. You are no longer the head of the Malfoy family, not whilst you're in here. And I do not believe that Harry and I will immediately move into the Manor. At least, not right away. There are still too many negative connotations and bad memories associated with the place. But perhaps one day, we will decide to live there. Or perhaps we will choose to close the entire estate and allow it to remain empty and collect dust for the rest of eternity. Either way though, it is not up to you. Any decision we make is made solely by us, and solely for us. You are no longer even a factor, I'm afraid."
"Malfoy," Harry could hear an edge of panic in his voice, "what the hell happened to you? Who the fuck
"Of course not," Draco glared at the newspaper on the table. "That paper and all its articles are evil. And libelous. And probably mean."
"Um…" Draco said in confusion, pulling open the strings of the bag to reveal strange coins and a small wad of weird folded paper. "What is this?"
Seek pressed a gentle kiss to the corner of Draco's mouth. "I really don't believe that you're as owned as you like to say you are. Nobody could ever truly own someone like you, Draco. You're far too much your own person to ever allow yourself to be so smothered."
"Haven't told him…" Staring at Blaise's vacant expression, it suddenly hit Draco like a slap to the head. "Oh god, you've Imperiused him."
Blaise tilted his head as he considered Harry with a serious expression. "Would it have been better if it had never happened? Would you have preferred if I had never come up with the plan or ever convinced Draco to go along with it? You know that he would not have approached you without it, Harry. You know how unwilling he is to actually connect to his feelings, even at the same time he's absolute shit at hiding them."
"That it didn't mean anything to me?" Harry guessed, wanting to scoff at the ridiculousness of the previous night not meaning anything to Harry. Of course it had meant something to Harry, it had meant something very important to Harry. He just wasn't quite sure what.
Dragging in heavy breaths, Draco forced down another sob threatening to break free. Seek was right. Draco
Seek hummed, reaching out to play with a lock of hair that had fallen free from the messy bun atop Draco's head. "Are you saying you're dangerous, Draco?"
"I s'pose we should go get the others," Harry said, shoving his hands into his pockets. "I'll go get the Slytherins, you go get the rest of them."
"I'm sorry, Draco," Harry whispered, clenching his eyes shut as the memory of that horrid night in the East Tower swept over him. "I'm so sorry."
"Yes, but when you're finally ready to admit such truths to yourselves, you know where to find us," Blaise said. "We're here whenever you two need a laugh."
Blaise said nothing, staring at Draco with a blank look that sent a shiver down Draco's spine. What the hell was wrong with the man?
p.s. If anyone was wondering, the poem Draco recited is a poem by Christina Rossetti, which is a name that anyone here who has read my previous murder mystery will hopefully recognize. I do so treasure her poetry ♡
Neville sighed again, shrugging. "To be honest, Harry, I don't. So if he's not in there and he's not on the ground floor, that leaves only the first floor he could be hiding in."
Turning back to Malfoy, Harry noticed that the man was paler than normal; there did not appear to be a single drop of blood left in his face. "Are you okay?" Harry asked, reaching out to touch Draco on the arm.
"I don't blame you," she shrugged, dropping into the seat nearest him. "I keep telling Daphne she overcooks everything, but you know how easily offended the girl is."
"And you know it, don't you, Malfoy?" it continued nastily. "You understand exactly how much you're worth, which is FUCKING NOTHING!" it roared without warning, causing the lamps to inadvertently flare to life, lighting up the large room lined with empty beds. A tall, lanky boy was momentarily highlighted, hair the color of straw hanging over hooded eyes, seen in a flash before he was suddenly gone, swearing profusely as he doused the lamps with a series of quick spells fired from the wand clenched tightly in an angry fist.
Glancing up, their gazes locked as Draco drew in a shuddery breath, shifting his hips and nudging Harry's chin with the tip of his stiff cock, silently pleading with Harry to do something with it. With a smile, Harry smoothed his hands over Draco's thighs, stroking in comfort as he continued to lick and nibble across the more ticklish parts of Draco's stomach. Draco thrashed and giggled unexpectedly, making odd squeaking sounds as his body jerked and gasped. No matter how much he wriggled around, however, his wrists remained crossed loosely over his head, the muscles of his arms tensing before the limbs relaxed back into position draped across the springy mattress.
Harry returned the shrug with one of his own. That information didn't surprise him at all. "I had to cook for my relatives when I was a kid. And Sirius was a bit hopeless in the kitchen, so I usually always made dinner for us when I moved in here."
Draco stared at him in confusion. "Well," he said slowly, gesturing around the two of them with one arm, "this is a Muggle street. And those are Muggles," he pointed at several strangers passing, "and those things are dangerous Muggle weapons." He indicated the strange windowed boxes on wheels that he was still convinced were using magic to move that fast. He had always known Muggles were such liars—not having magic, honestly.
Striding to a black leather sofa, Harry sank down onto it with a grateful sigh, glad to no longer be sitting on a stone floor. Draco had probably just gone to the kitchens and would be back soon enough, where he would enter and unknowingly lock himself in with Harry and then they would talk—Harry was determined. They would talk.
to save his life. Because Harry Potter was too annoyingly heroic for his own good—he couldn't look a person in the eye without trying to save them from something.
"Would you…" Harry felt a fierce blush spread across his face and was sure that Draco could feel the heat from it, "would you, er…" Oh, god, how did he ask someone something like that? He hadn't asked anyone on a date since fifth year with Cho.
"Oh, Master Draco! I is so sorry!" the elf shrieked, wrenching his arms free from Malfoy's hold before throwing himself at the man's feet and crying even harder. "Master Draco, sir, you is okay, you is alive! Pibby is trying, sir, trying to answer! Master calls for bad, bad, Pibby, and I tries, sir, Pibby tries so hard, but I is not able to go to Master Draco! Bad magicks is in the house, sir, and they is holding Pibby trapped and is not letting him go to his master!" Tears were streaming down the scrunched face of the creature and snot was dripping steadily from his bulbous nose. "Pibby is sorry, Master Draco, sir! I tries, sir,
"I realize this isn't the best place for this conversation," Draco said uncomfortably, fidgeting in his seat but falling silent when Hermione held up one hand.
"I'm sorry," the other man apologized quietly. "I know that I said I would give you time and that I wouldn't add to all the pressure being piled on you, but I like you, Harry," he said, turquoise eyes piercing into Harry's own. "I've liked you for a long time."
Harry shrugged. "I just don't want to dismiss him as an option. There were only two other people in this room last night."
With a helpless shrug, Harry kept his gaze fixed to the floor. How was he supposed to answer him? How was he supposed to explain everything—especially in front of Caelix? Harry knew they needed to talk about everything and he had every intention of being honest with the man, but it was a talk he would really rather prefer not to have in front of Ron.
"Noted," Blaise vowed solemnly. "I promise. No more lies." One eyebrow rose as he turned to the redhead beside her. "Take notes, Weasley.
"Hey," a soft voice interrupted, startling Draco from his thoughts. "What are you thinking about?" As he spoke, Harry slung himself over the back of the sofa to land next to the blond with a grin, settling himself into the cushions with his head resting in Draco's lap.
His heart started to pound as a sudden idea sprang to mind. Cautiously, he exited the portrait hole and pulled the map from his bag, heart hammering faster and faster the more he scanned it, wondering where the blond was…he smiled as he finally spotted Malfoy's dot, all alone in the boathouse.
Harry snorted. "I would like to think I'm a bit better than that at being able to tell when someone is trying to manipulate me, Draco."
The cement was ice-cold beneath his feet as he jogged down the steps and toward the gate, needing as much distance from the clubhouse as he could get. Once he felt far enough away, he pulled the phone from his pocket and dialed Seek's number with trembling fingers. With every ring, Draco could feel his muscles tensing, his heart hammering faster, and he wondered how much stress and panic a person could survive before their body gave out from it.
, Draco thought, suddenly envious of the girl. If only he could fall from reality as easily, submerge himself into her whimsical subconscious and see the world through eyes that still believed in magic. And not magic in the sense that he knew day-to-day magic to exist for wizards, but the magical way in which his beloved Muggle authors wove their pretty fairytales—where everything was fascinating, everything was extraordinary and mysterious
"So, erm, where should we do this?" Harry asked awkwardly, regretting his question when Malfoy stepped away from him. Bending low, he picked up his fallen wand and, smirking at Harry, hopped up onto the desk, sweeping aside the textbook, notes, and leftover ingredients onto the stone floor of the office.
His heavy steps slowed as he laughed bitterly to himself. He was nobody's hero, and if the world knew the
"I'm not saying they're not," Blaise said with a shrug. "But I'm telling you that Potter is the type of person who would willingly allow himself to be hurt before allowing anybody he cared about to be hurt. Were you not there when he walked into the fucking Forbidden Forest to
Harry wanted to stamp his foot at those words. He was not accusing Malfoy of becoming the next Voldemort, only implying that the blond was slightly more than your average, everyday evil. He was his own kind of evil. He was platinum blond evil.
The bigger of the two lines was snorted and Wolf leaned back with a grin, waving Gargoyle off without looking. "Here," he said, offering Draco the straw, and Draco quickly shook his head. "Come on," Fen said, a vicious tilt to his smile as he stepped behind Draco, pulling Draco's long hair back in one hand and pressing a wet kiss to his throat. "It's a party."
There was softness. Light. A warm hand was wrapped around his own and that was nice. A happy sigh escaped Draco as he weakly squeezed the fingers entangled with his own cold digits, noting how nice it felt to hold hands with another person. It was not something he had done very much of in his life. Perhaps whoever's hand it belonged to would like to hold hands with Draco more often. He knew that he would certainly like it.
"What was it that you found?" Draco asked casually, lifting his glass to take a small sip of his lager but regretting it when his hand shook as he lowered it back to the table.
Fenrir sat up slowly, eyeing Draco like a hungry snake about to strike. "It's not a bother, Draco. If your car needs fixing, I'll fix it."
him, then, if you're so convinced!" Pansy sighed in exasperation, refusing to open her eyes as she lay back on the grassy hill, soaking up as much autumn sunlight as she could. It wasn't as warm as Draco would have liked, but he had cast some warming charms over the two of them and they could at least pretend that it was the sun keeping them warm instead of the fact that they had cheated nature by using magic.
"I wanted to ask you about that, actually, Malfoy." Hermione's voice sounded behind Harry, and he turned to look at her as she stepped next to him. "I noticed when I was in the library earlier that it only has one entrance, correct?"
But Draco shoved the thought away, reminding himself about his promise to his own mind not to allow it to wander along that particular path.
"Cae—" he began, taking a deep breath. "I'm so sorry. Really. I'm so fucking sorry, I never intended any of this to happen. But I can explain," his words started to come faster as his voice became louder and more earnest, "I swear I can! Well, maybe I can't, really, so much, 'cos I seem to be complete shit at explaining myself, but I can
Harry opened his mouth to speak but Draco silenced him with a pointed look. Deciding to skip politeness and pretense, Draco cast a silencing charm around Gregory and himself. He did not want an audience listening in as he explained the recent horrors that had befallen all their old classmates. The more he told Greg, the more horrified the expression on the man's face became, until his eyes were impossibly round and his mouth was hanging open in disbelief.
The knob twisted easily and the door swung open to reveal an irate Caelix, but his expression smoothed the instant he noticed who it was.
Harry's head jerked up, staring at Blaise with wide eyes full of disbelief. "What the hell does that even mean?"
"Draco…" Harry said, feeling nonplussed. Did he really intend for them to have a picnic? Just the two of them? In a beautiful forest miles away from any prying eyes?
"I checked the other doors like you wanted, Hermione," he said quietly, glancing back the way he had just come from, "and the wards are all still there. You said you only took down the one ward, right? To let us out of the room after we found her?"
It was cold and covered in shadows, the room dimly lit from the grey moonlight pouring in through the large window carved into the wall opposite him. Draco Malfoy sat perched on the wide ledge, swinging his legs and sighing, and Harry watched as he pulled out a large expensive-looking pocket watch, flipping it open and sighing again before snapping it shut and tucking it away.
“They’re...um...are you going to use a charm? Maybe I can try with my wand?” He continued to stare at the floor.
“Please don’t remind me,” Draco cut in, putting his elbows on the desk and resting his head in his hands.
This was the first time Harry heard his name on Draco's lips. His arousal went straight to his head and he slowly put a finger inside Draco. Harry sucked in his breath and froze at the feel of the wet heat around the skin of his digit.  He wanted to feel him even deeper.
“You didn't do anything wrong and you're not a freak! You don't owe anyone an explanation either. Ever. In any situation. And non of what happened was your fault.” Potter's voice changed at this. He sounded like he himself was offended.
Harry’s mouth dropped, followed by tears that became sobs. Harry covered his face with his hands and started to bawl. His body was shaking, moving Draco and the baby along with him.
As soon as Harry was gone, Draco got out of the bathtub, unstopped it, and wrapped the fluffy white towel around himself. He wiped off some of the steam on the mirror to look at his hair. It looked immaculate. He needed a haircut but there wasn’t a single piece of hair that looked damaged or out of place. He ran his fingers through his damp hair, remembering how it felt when Harry was doing it. He didn’t know whether it was his newly diagnosed heart condition or Potter’s generosity that made the thumping in his chest go a bit faster.
“No, that’s alright. I only work every other Saturday, so I’m off tomorrow. Do you have to go in early?” He kept his eyes on Draco, who was looking at his drink.
Harry pushed another inside and looked into Draco's eyes for any signs of discomfort. Draco crashed his lips back to Harry's, kissing him hard. Harry moved his fingers in and out, speeding up with Draco's movements, both moaning into each others' mouths.
“You're free to go. Next time, don't bother so much about former Death Eaters. I never asked you to risk your job.”
Harry sighed. “He's not my type. I want to check your legs and stomach. I know we destroyed your clothes last night, so here,” he said, taking the orange paper bag from the table and handing it to Draco.
“Its a muggle term. Muggle healers, doctors as you already know, wear white coats. Some patients get anxious, even get higher blood pressure in a clinical setting. So I decided to not look like a healer. If you're ok with with.”
Draco nodded. “I’m grateful to have Frida, for those days where a potion might be an absolute disaster and fuck with me massively.” He turned back to polishing the money register.
Long into the late hours that night, Draco was huddled again in front of the bin in his back room, throwing up liquid and small bits of food. Frida was holding a cold rag behind his neck.
The floating candles instantly took Harry back to his past once again: to Hogwarts. This wasn’t as grandiose or as ornate and almost felt like a home with wooden displays of shelves and cabinets holding various bottles of potions and herbs in four corners of the room. Right in the center back was a cashier’s table with a glass display on the wall behind it. The bottles here were categorized alphabetically and locked away neatly. There was a wooden door that was left open right next to this display. Maybe some sort of storage, Harry thought.
At least the hideous, lime-green St. Mungo's healers' robes were outrageously loose and covered his erection. He was sure Malfoy hadn't noticed. He never felt sexy nor comfortable in clothes like these. He threw off his coat, grabbed his wand, and decided to take a shower.
“I’m just saying dear, you deserve someone special, that’s all,” Frida was genuinely smiling at him, her voice comforting and soothing. Draco looked at her.
Great. They couldn't do the later part of the “9 -11 am” time slot. He needed tea. And a shower. He skipped the bathroom and walked downstairs, tying his robe around himself as he reached the last stair. Potter stood in front of his fireplace, looking disheveled, yet composed at the same time. Draco swallowed as he stared at Potter's muscular arms and legs, covered by a tight-fitting crimson jacket and trousers. Harry swallowed back, deepening his frown and looked down; kicking pieces of ash off his black, polished shoes.
“I am not!” Draco shouted, immediately realizing that he did, in fact, get into denial as she had predicted. “I mean….umm….that’s a bit extreme, Frida. C’mon!”
“Uh, yes. Yeah. Real terrible ones.” Harry wasn’t sure why, but Malfoy knelt down and seemed to be rummaging through something behind the counter. He took out a small cotton pouch tied with string and handed it to Harry. He also grabbed his wand from the same place and locked the front door with a loud ‘click.’
He read the note, over and over again, not being able to decide if it was too much, or not enough. He finally folded it neatly, put it inside an envelope, and sent it out with his owl.
The thrusting sped up, and Harry was hitting his spot every single time he rammed into him. Draco was seeing stars.
had been closed for a few hours, Harry sat on the sidewalk near the shop, with a bottle of butterbear in his hand.
“I wouldn't fight you, Harry. I'm not a muggle you picked up at the gay bar Merlin knows where. Those I choose to fight with, even, have to be worth my time.”
Draco was silent. He willed himself to not feel, to not cry, to not push Potter off his chair and run out the door. Even if he had to crawl.
“Ahhh….fuck….” Draco’s moans got louder and heavier. He was grabbing tightly onto the sides of the sofa, his body completely in Potter’s mercy.
“We're going to take you to Spell Damage, where I normally work. You'll need to practice walking again and I'd like to make sure you heal correctly.”
“Sorry, I’m sorry,” Potter slurred his words, resting his head on Draco’s chest. “We can stop if you want.”
Harry looked deeply into Draco's silver eyes. He wished he had met him under different circumstances. Instead they were here, in a hospital room, playing healer and patient, and struggling to keep their distance. Still, this was a job. A job he had to finish. He took the oil and went back to Draco's stomach.
“No, Frida, it’s really not. I may like him, but it’s not mutual, alright? He had sex with me because he was drunk. I could've done it sober to be perfectly frank, and that’s the difference. We both came out to one another as gay, and he saw an opportunity to have sex with a bloke. Lots of guys do that. Then you never hear from them again. You know how many men I had in Paris?”
“Please sit down Malfoy, just need to grab one more thing.” Harry set the platter down on the coffee table and went back to get the drinks. Draco was wearing the same clothes he was in earlier at the shop. Navy blue trousers which were snug around his hips and thighs, and a white jumper which sat loose around his collarbones. Harry noticed that he had combed his hair a little neater than usual, completely away from his eyes. He had long, dark blond lashes and beautifully arched eyebrows. Harry swallowed thickly as he sat down on the sofa next to him, leaving some space between them.
“Faster breaths, Draco. Breathe through it.” Peter’s voice came from the other side, who was getting some blankets and hot water ready.
I held my breath and my heart must've stopped for a few seconds. One of Draco's pupils was about twice as large as the other one. He parted his lips.
“Let me get the tea.” Harry needed a reason to leave for a moment. He didn’t completely understand why but, all of a sudden, he had an urge to protect Draco. His bit of anxiety made him want to further take care of him, comfort him, and shield him from any possible harm or danger.
I don’t even know where to start, I don’t know her surname. I guess I could just search for ‘Vasilia’ section by section.” Draco sounded irritated and exhausted.
“You taste amazing. You're so fucking gorgeous.” Harry spread Draco's inner thighs carefully with both hands and worked his tongue inside.
Peter leaned down next to Harry, his presence calm and gentle. “That’s actually perfect. There’s a spot here,” he pointed to a place in the middle of Draco’s lower back, “if you apply pressure, it gives some natural relief. Use your knuckles.” Harry did what Peter demonstrated, looking around to see how Draco was reacting to this. He looked beautifully peaceful. Letting air out of his mouth and keeping his eyes shut.
Harry smiled in excitement and carefully removed his fingers from Draco. He gave Draco a hard kiss right on the lips and pushed himself off of him.  Draco noticed Harry rubbing his hard cock in preparation, which was already wet from a lubrication charm he’d likely used wandlessly.
Draco's hands were shaking as a struggled to pull the black pants up to his waist. His legs felt like there was lightening going through them. Fucking Potter. He loved and hated him for this at the same time. No man had ever gifted him anything, much less something so thoughtful. He had tried to replace what he had, going all the way to Hogsmeade in his busy hospital schedule. He hated that he couldn't say more. He wanted to say more than 'thank you' but it wasn't going to come out right. Potter made him feel weak and strong at the same time. He was afraid of the vulnerability lurking right beneath his tongue if he spoke too much.
He was pushed onto his back on top of the bed that was only half-covered with wrinkled, grey sheets. The husky male grabbed both sides of Draco's head, almost covering it entirely, and crashed his lips hard against his. It was warm and wet and Draco suffocated under the heavy, sour breath. He struggled to breathe and let out a desperate moan in his throat. The man pulled up and stared intently into Draco's eyes.
“I didn’t want to come back, you know. The French Ministry of Magic denied our request to stay longer. I had studied there as an apprentice with a potions master. We barely understood one another but I picked up on it eventually. I did more than I was required so she wouldn’t sack me. Cleaned and polished her store, the floors, stayed up longer to finish formulas and woke up earlier to organize everything. She was sad to see me go and I was sad to leave.” Malfoy took a bite of a cucumber sandwich as he continued. “So….here I am. Back in England.”
“A prescription for a strong pain potion. I’ve never seen one before. Said I have to make sure the seller signs it and mails it back to them.”
A strong pang of nausea suddenly hit the pit of his stomach. He put down the rag and the bottle, buckling over in discomfort.
His face, paler than usual, was patched with dark blue and purple bruises, blood seeping through the cotton guaze on his left cheekbone. I slowly laid my hand on his forehead and swept away his hair sticking to his moist skin. His swollen eyelids and wet lashes twitched with my touch, and I couldn’t help to softly put my lips to his temple.
“I guess,” Ron replied, nonchalantly. “Try seeing if he has this potion.” He handed Harry back the prescription. "Seems the type to dabble in rare and controlled substances." It was hard for Ron to hide the slight animosity from his tone. "It's called Eagle Elixirs. It's where Frida's Fabrics and Lace used to be."
“That’s my own herbal mixture,” Malfoy nodded to the object inside Harry’s hand, polishing some glass bottles with a white flannel as he spoke. “Since it works through smell, it goes straight to your head and the effect is immediate. It won’t replace the potion though, which will last much longer in your system.”
“Don’t be silly, dear! You know I can handle the shop all on my own,” she said, giving him a dramatic wink.
“You’re going to deny it, so I’m not telling you,” she said in a playful manner, continuing to smile.
“You were found at the emergency entrance behind the hospital. You were cut in fourteen different places all over your upper legs and lower torso in what was likely the Diffindo spell. You were bleeding very heavily and could've died. Another healer and I had to take off your clothes to mend the cuts, stop the bleeding, and check for all other damages.”
I would've said everything in my heart and in my dreams if I had known that this would be my last time speaking to him.
The evening had drastically become darker as Harry stepped into the cold, night air. The sky was moonless but scattered with a thousand stars. As he made his way towards Magical Menagerie, he noticed a small millinery shop right next door. To the left of it was what Ron had described: a former fabric shop now turned apothecary.
Harry placed the tip of his penis against Draco's opening and pushed in, very slowly, enjoying every second of his entry into Draco's beautiful body.
“And what? Right now we’re here. We can mention the past when we need to or when we have to. We can’t deny it. But right now, we’re here. I don’t want you to feel awkward about it. What happened to you could have happened to anyone. What the Ministry did was wrong. I know I’ll lose my temper when I talk to them, so I’m going to have to plan this and do it at the right time. They’re not getting away with it.” Harry took a sip of his water, looking at Draco.
“I’m so proud of you, Draco. You’re incredible. I’ve never witnessed such strength and power.” Draco's cheeks were stained with tears as he listened to Harry’s words.
It was now close to 3 o'clock, and he has been here for over two hours. When I was called in to be notified of the criminals involved, Ron took charge of their capture, locating the tracing spell that was still in place on Draco's wand. The bloodly stupid bastards had stolen it from him, and to our advantage, made our job easier. While I feel some relief knowing they'll be rotting in Azkaban, my heart is angry and hurting for Draco. I know why they did this to him. I know it wasn't a coincidence when I remembered The Prophet's story about him being seen with another wizard at the Parkinson's Valentine's Ball a week ago. A muggle-born wizard. I was proud of him. It was a brave thing to do for a pureblood who was expected to be with another pureblood. A witch.
“Ahhhh…...make it stop, please.” He squirmed against Harry’s body, and Harry held his hands even tighter, trying to relieve his pain. “Harry….please….ahhhhh…..Potter!!”
“Ahhhhhhh….uggghhhhhh.” He fell back against Harry’s chest, panting in pain, crushing Harry's fingers.
He still saw Potter as arrogant, stuck-up, and cocky. He couldn't give any examples of course, but it suited him just fine to paint a different picture of Potter than the rest of society. He hated hero-worship.
“No, lad! Go now! Forget the store for a moment, I will handle it. I promise you if I need something, I will ask you immediately. Don’t you worry.” She smiled confidently at him and floated through the door.
There was no other way to look except up. The sky was moonless and clear,  with a handful of bright stars to give some light to the blackness. Harry closed his eyes and took another deep breath, letting all his senses drown upward into the heavens.
Draco didn’t go into work the following day. He bought more things for his baby and cleaned his flat. As eight o’clock was nearing, Potter came to his mind. He thought maybe he’d be visiting at this time. He was tempted to go downstairs and see, but quickly changed his mind. What if he didn’t come tonight? What if Draco was getting hopeful again, which always led to disappointment. He sat down at his dining table, taking out a quill, ink and parchment. He decided to write to him instead.
“I think you’re absolutely beautiful.” Harry kept his eyes on him. Draco squeezed his hands harder and Harry squeezed him back.
.” The windows on both sides of the entrance door were long and narrow, and Harry could see the candlelights from inside the shop flickering against the glass; illuminating the darkness of the streets.
Fumbling with his wand and going back to his lower region, he nervously spelled the wounds back together, stopping the bleeding. Modley joined him, saying nothing about Draco's body or gender. He applied the dittany to the closed cuts and Harry gently covered him with a clean, white sheet. Modley nodded to him as he usually did in a job well done. He turned around as he got to the door, saying, “You might also want to check her for rape. Just in case.”
“No,” she answered. “They're not dating anymore. Please don't try contacting him, Draco wouldn’t want him here.”
“Hi sweet little baby,” Harry softly spoke. He looked down Draco’s body and noticed Vasilia pull something large and reddish purple out of Draco and drop it inside a flat metal pan. The placenta. He remembered seeing this in the book. Then, she took out something small and sharp, with some sort of thread hanging from it. When Peter cast a numbing spell, Harry realised what was happening. They were taking care of Draco’s tears. There was a pool of blood below his legs and bottom, on the white sheets of the bed. He cupped Draco’s head in his direction, trying to distract him from what they were doing.
“Sorry, here. You can do it if you’d like. I thought it might be hard to see and I don’t have a hand mirror.”
“So...how long have you had your shop?” He decided to jump right in, not knowing how else to break the ice.
“I don't mind. You do a good job. I don't want to see these lines. They're always going to remind me of what happened and I don't want that.”
and a little something to give his godson and felt the need to pay Draco what he owed - no matter how much he was pushed away. He is Potter after all, and Draco knew he was a kind man no matter how much he resented his feelings for him.
He saw the empty sofa with the crumbled blanket laying serenely on top of it. He felt his heart sinking down to his toes, keeping him frozen on the spot. He didn’t feel hungry any longer.
It took Draco a good thirty seconds to move from his position. His head was still bent over, looking down at his lap.
There were a few customers at every corner, chatting among themselves quietly and pointing to whatever struck their curiosity. There wasn’t any sign of Malfoy or anyone else overseeing the store.
He heard a chair being dragged against the floor near him, and knew Potter was sitting down. It was much less threatening than having him stand. It was also less threatening that he was using his first name, having called each other by their surnames all throughout Hogwarts. It didn't make him feel any less abashed and he continued to keep his face hidden.
Draco's breathing was rough and labored, even with the help of spells and charms placed around his nose and chest. I was told he'd still be in some pain, as the potions given were only strong enough to take care of the major damages.
“She was killed during the start of the war.” Harry turned his face around, clutching the bottle in his hand.
“Well, to both of you, but mostly you,” he winked at Malfoy when he caught his eye. Harry took another drink and put an entire sandwich into his mouth.
“Can I kiss you?” Harry whispered against Draco’s lips. Draco nodded, feeling his entire body tremble. He licked his lips, in an attempt to ask Harry not to wait too long. He was afraid of changing his mind.
“Because maybe it’s true. Take the potions and go. Get some sleep,” he said gently, turning his piercing gaze back to Harry. “I hate pain. I’m sure you do, too. Goodnight, Potter. It was nice seeing you.” Draco went back inside the small room where he had come from. He shut the door behind him and lights appeared from the bottom gap.
Draco froze. “Oh…..I see. I don’t see the point, though that’s very nice of you. We’d just pretend nothing happened and forget all about it the very next day, I’m sure.”
I remember wanting to kiss more than just his temple. I wanted to cover his face with a hundred kisses and I wanted him to open his eyes and smile and see the stars that I was seeing and tell me that they looked like they were dancing and I wanted to tell him all my dreams about him and all my thoughts and everything in my heart but I was beaten and he was beaten and now everything's broken and I'm here sobbing and screaming and looking into his eyes, more beautiful than any star in the black sky.
One evening when he was sitting in the living room, reading his book, he was startled by a knock on the door. It was followed by a familiar voice.
Harry was looking at him with bright, emerald eyes. “I didn’t either. I kept coming to see you because I was attracted to you. I invited you over to get to know you better. I didn’t use you for sex, Draco. I wanted a relationship with you. I was interested in you. Still am. Even more now.”
“I’ll do it,” Draco groaned. All articles of clothing were now a heap on the floor, entangled and wrapped around together. Draco noticed that Harry had an erection as well. He could stop now, put an end to this, apologize for drinking more than his fair share, be the level-headed, rational man that he’d always been, and get inside his own warm bed in his flat, and feel safe away from other people. That had been his reality for years. He’d kept his deep, subconscious desires at bay by re-focusing his mind on other matters, on his job, his inventions, his creations, and not stepping out of line in legal matters. He’d behaved well, kept his boundaries within reasonable limits, disciplined himself to be civil and distant. That was all before Harry Potter showed up and fucked with his head, opened up that secret chamber inside of his heart and managed to unlock the one place he’d suppressed for so long. He knew Potter didn’t feel the same way back, there was no way. There was no way he could have the depth of attraction and passion that Draco had felt for him all these years, only to intensify once he saw him again. He decided he shouldn’t care. It did not matter. Right now, he was going to enjoy this lustful moment with Potter, even if they never saw each other again.
“I didn't.” Harry looked up. “I know how to play their game. I'll speak when I think things are unfair. Its been seven goddamn years. I'd feel miserable as a wizard not being able to use all my magic. Its not out of pity. Its about justice and bloody common sense.”
“You’re in love with him,” she quickly said, studying her fingernails as a way to avoid eye contact.
“Modley, where's Draco?” Modley raised his eyebrows in surprise. “He didn't tell you? He left a few hours ago, it was barely sunrise.”
Draco's eyes had stopped moving. He took his last breath as he stared into mine. I shouted at the top of my lungs for someone to get in the room. I couldn't let go of his hand. I had told him I'd never leave his side. I still didn't want to.
“Where do you get these jasmines?” Draco’s voice stopped him from walking. He turned to face him again.
“Fuck Malfoy, you look so hot right now. I want to make you come so bad.” Harry made his way onto Draco as Draco released his knees, resting on top of him. He grabbed Draco’s face with both hands.
Harry got closer to the display in order to read the names on the beautifully crafted bottles. At the very top of every label was the logo “
“I'm sorry mate, those looked expensive but your life matters more.” Modley sounded genuinely regretful as Harry carefully peeled off the fabric from Draco's legs. His pants came off with them, the spell cutting through all the layers of fabric but sparing his skin. Modley started to unbutton Draco's shirt, saying, “We should check the rest of his body.”
The day had fallen into night. Draco had asked to get out of the water and was now back on the floor of his bedroom on all fours. Harry was rubbing his back, and continued to squeeze his hands when his contractions hit. Vasilia was checking his progress from behind.
Harry looked down, blushing. “I don’t think….it’s not a big deal at all. It’s just common decency. I can be better, I think.”
“Thank you, lad.” She put all three bottles inside a paper bag; using a satin ribbon to tie it elegantly into a bow.
“I have, apparently,” he said proudly, squashing the hurt deep inside his stomach. “After all, you are here, the saviour of our world, sitting in my own living room, doing me a great, tremendous favour by returning my rights to practice magic without constraints. How did I become so lucky?”
Draco waited for her to continue, genuinely interested though his tired body betrayed him from expressing it.
“No, I can't. I'd give too much of myself away and even my closest friends don't know. Its not that important. Plus, we have a patient/healer relationship now and it would be very awkward.”
Vasilia leaned in front of him, “It is okay, Drakon. Do not be scared, okay? Do not fight, that is very important. Let it come.”
“I...I have this prescription for a potion from St. Mungo’s,” he tried speaking efficiently with his auror professionalism. “Would you happen to sell it here?”
When class ended, Harry shoved his books and the list into his bag with enough time to follow Draco out the door. "Hey Malfoy...err, Draco?" Harry said from behind the blonde.
“So what’s your problem?” Draco asked. “If we can plan out what we need for the celebration tonight, we will have less to do during the week.”
In Transfigurations, Harry struggled to concentrate on the task of transforming a robin into a mop. Each time he tried, the robin ended up as a sleek black handled broom with white bristles.
“Although, I suppose your idea would be worth a try,” Draco mused aloud and grazed his lips over Harry’s neck, before licking a line up to his ear and nibbling softly on his earlobe.
Draco shook his head. No. It had been business. He’d successfully coerced Potter into to helping him with the Muggle side of things for his department’s Christmas celebrations, nothing else.
He had been so excited about going to Hogwarts that he’d babbled on and on. Harry had barely gotten a word in and Draco had barely noticed his odd responses. He had been determined to befriend the great Harry Potter on the train and was heartbroken when he realised Weasley had gotten there first.
He hadn’t been this close to Harry since after the Battle of Hogwarts three years prior. Draco had forgotten what it felt like to be this close to the person that had set his world on fire, figuratively and literally during that battle. Harry’s affect on him hadn’t changed after all this time.
“Definitely complaining,” Draco declared. He thought both answers were probably accurate if he was truthful, but he wasn’t about to admit that to Granger. “I would have thought you’d given them a lecture about it by now.”
He watched as Harry Adam's apple moved. He took a step closer, teasing. Now he could see the small beads of sweat forming on Harry's face. He wanted to lean in and lick the sweat from Harry's jaw, before the droplets rolled down his neck and vanished underneath his black shirt. Harry did not say a word, just watched Draco.
“Auror dress robes,” Harry answered nonchalantly and raised his arms as Madam Malkin’s measuring tape started whizzing around him this time.
Harry unwrapped it to reveal a long infinity scarf that had tones of red, green, a golden yellow and a silver grey all artfully mixed together.
“There’s no doubting his dedication to the job,” Draco sighed. “Do you think he’ll be back before Christmas?”
A few minutes went by as they drank their tea in silence then Harry reached over to placed his mug on the side table with a grimace.
Harry folded the paper and placed it on the table, then turned in his chair enough to wrap his arms around Draco’s chest. Draco felt his warmth and instantly melted into Harry, abandoning his breakfast for the moment. He turned his head and was met with Harry’s lips on his. The heat in their kisses, even after four months together, still surprised Draco. Harry pulled away sooner than Draco would have liked, but he knew there would be more where that came from later that night.
On Wednesday, Draco confirmed the final numbers of the party guests and worked on the seating arrangements. When he left the Ministry in the evening, he still yet had to hear from Harry. He had promised to tell him by Thursday morning who would be in charge of the Christmas music and Draco trusted he would keep his word.
“Wait a minute.” All the absurd scenarios Draco had played out in his head the previous day were suddenly becoming very plausible. “You didn't deliberately chase known Death Eaters into Muggle areas on the off-chance I was sent to the scene, have you?”
Draco took a deep breath and used all his restraint not the sneer at him again. It was nearly Christmas, after all. “Thank you, Potter, for pointing that out.” He tried to keep the sarcasm out of his voice but was not wholly successful.
It was then that he finally touched the throbbing erection before him, wrapped his fingers around the base and drawing a long exclamation from his lover. “Fuuck! Draco, please.”
“I’ll meet you at the Howling Wolf Cafe at one tomorrow. Louise will check your vitals in thirty minutes.
Harry automatically went to shrug and immediately regretted the action, cursing under his breath. Draco gave a small laugh. "Glad you think it's funny. Do you mind doing your job now?"
“I felt like a nice lunch out, and this place isn’t really Ron’s style. I thought you would appreciate it, even though it isn’t run by wizards. And you should know that Ron and I are followed in the Alley just like you and Harry are, we just don’t do anything newsworthy most of the time. So it’s much more relaxing when you don’t have to worry about being watched while you eat lunch.”
Harry leaned across the table. “What do you think you're doing? Put that stuff away now. You can't use
Letting go of Harry’s wrist to step back, he pulled his wand from his pocket and spelled lube onto his fingers. Anticipating Draco’s next move, Harry shuffled back and bent at the hips as he leaned against the wall. Please with Harry’s eagerness, Draco didn’t hesitate to cover his hole with lube and start working his finger inside. Harry gasped at the first entry of Draco’s digit but was soon leaning further forward and moving his hips back.
They waited in silence for a minute or so before Harry spoke again. “So, does this place meet whatever criteria you have?”
Ankles crossed atop his desk, Draco lounged back in his reclined chair and reflected on a successful end to his latest assignment.
“Hello Malfoy,” Harry said calmly, seemingly not phased by the sight of his childhood enemy, then went to stand on the platform across from Draco as the Madam directed.
The next morning, Draco was still no closer to figuring out what he should get or make Harry that wasn’t overly expensive or useless. The whole present thing just seemed unnecessarily difficult so he decided to pay Avalon Ainsworth a visit.
He Accio’d the bag that had held the decorations and peered inside. It was empty. Surely he hadn't left the star at the Manor.
Harry went to tilt his head for a kiss, but Draco pulled back and looked at the clock on Harry’s bedside table. “How does your head feel?”
The Ministry's end of year parties were always fairly rowdy. Harry was dancing with Hermione, glad the year was finally over. “I think you have an admirer, Harry,” Hermione shouted into his ear over the loud music.
He watched Draco's smirk grow and the next thing Harry knew Draco had switched their positions so he was now pinned against the wall by Draco's body and being given a proper snog.
"It works better if we remove the pieces of gravel first, Mr. Potter." She tried to coerce him to straighten his leg again so she could continue. He hugged his leg and examined the wound himself. He'd never studied healing spells in great detail, but he was sure that Madam Pomfrey could have handled the extensive graze up the side of his leg and knee in a few seconds flat.
When Draco walked back into the lounge room with their mugs refilled, he found Harry with his head tilted back on the armrest, eyes closed. The expression on his face told Draco he was in deep thought. Setting the mugs down on the side table, he moved behind Harry’s head, placed his hands on Harry’s shoulders and began to massage them through his robes. Harry opened his eyes and looked quizzically up at Draco. “What are you doing?”
Draco laughed and then waved his wand a few times. Harry’s hives began to disappear. First from his face and then from down his body. He watched as his skin returned to normal before looking back up at Draco, this time with a smile on his face. “Thank you.”
Draco couldn't help the smile that spread across his face. “Wonderful. All right, I’ll go and book the function room now.”
Draco lowered his wand and Harry made to get off the bed. "I'm not finished with you yet, Potter." He searched the trolley and picked up what appeared to be a small cushion and a potion vile. "Can you cough for me, please?"
As he stepped into the room, McGonagall looked up over her glasses at him, eerily like Dumbledore. “Hello Mr. Potter. How may I help you?”
He sighed. “I know. I’m sorry. I'll try to remember better for next time. Though, I still think it would have been nice to know before McGonagall made the announcement.”
Their drinks arrived along with some bread and butter and the waiter took their meal order. Draco pondered his next question as he buttered and ate a slice of fresh, warm sourdough.
“Thank you", Harry said. "I’ll have to discuss a few things with my friend before we make a booking, but we will be sure to get back to you later today.”
Ron rolled his eyes and sighed. “Sure. Follow me.” He led Draco to what he presumed was a meeting room and closed the door behind them. Ron gestured for him to have a seat at the conference table and then sat down himself. “This is about Harry, isn’t it?”
"But how did you know I was even here? Only a few people in the Auror's Office knew and…" Draco saw the thought and then the confusion in Harry's eyes when he seemed to figure out who told Draco where he was. "You went to Ron?"
Feeling a hand roaming his leg and trying to find its way between their legs, Draco grabbed at the wrist and then entwined his fingers with Harry’s. He brought the hand above his partner’s head to pin it on the armrest and continued his assault as he searched out the other hand to join it. “You didn’t think I was going to give up that easily, did you?” Draco asked as he kissed along Harry’s jaw and behind his ear into the dark hair, rolling his hips to create the friction the hand had been searching for.
“Do you know if Harry will be communicating with anyone in the Auror Office while he’s away? He didn’t mention owling me and I assume that won’t be practical, but can I at least get updates from the Office?” Draco thought getting updates about Harry being safe would help get through the time apart a little easier.
“Not like I have a choice.” Harry’s gaze followed Draco’s hands as he unbuttoned his own shirt and discarded it before continuing on to his trousers.
McGonagall stood up. “Oh, I’m starting to get used to it. I get the feeling it will be a few years before people stop popping in to speak with the previous two Headmasters. I’ll just head down to the staff room for a cup of tea.”
They spent the next hour going over all the events Harry had listed during class and evaluating their worth as evidence. It was agreed that the strongest evidence Harry could give was when Draco saved his life by lying to his Father about not knowing if it was truly Harry under the welts from the stinging jinx when he had been captured by the snatchers and taken to Malfoy Manor.
“Lucius Malfoy, we sentence you to ten years in Azkaban, with a review of your case to be held after five.”
“Thanks Weasley,” Draco said with a huge grin, then stood up. “I should have known I could count on you to slip up.”
It wasn’t long before they were at Harry’s usual table with Ron seated to the side, half facing the door.
Harry noted Draco was doing a little better than he was with the task at hand, although the colours of Draco's mop were a bit off compared to the one the Professor had demonstrated. The handle of Draco’s mop was a pale wood and the mop head was jet black, while the Professor’s example was warm brown. It would seem he was on Draco's mind too.
“You’re welcome, Mr Potter. I just ask that you inform me when you’re finished.” She picked up the parchment she’d been reading from and made her way out the door.
Draco just shook his head at Harry’s poor reasoning. “But you admit some were deliberate attempts to see me?”
“Was it really that surprising McGonagall asked me?” Draco managed to sound both hurt and curious at the same time.
The next thing Draco knew, he was standing in a dingy room, with a bed in one corner and a desk with a lamp against the side wall. He could feel the heat of a fire burning behind him. The grip on his arm released and he looked around to see Harry removing his invisibility cloak.
When Harry arrived home that night, he barely acknowledged Draco. Instead heading straight for the bedroom directly from the fireplace. Draco did a double take. His mouth opened to greet Harry as he came in, hopefully with a kiss or two, now hung wide with surprise at being completely ignored and walked past.  He steeled himself and followed Harry up the stairs. Reaching their bedroom, he found Harry had already accio’d a suitcase onto the bed and was directing clothes into it with his wand.
Although he was still shocked when younger people didn’t recognise Malfoy, Harry knew it was a good thing. He smiled and said, “We have a lot of history.”
Harry took a large swig of wine this time. “One,” he answered as he set his glass back on the table. “But only because I caught her under it. Wasn't long after that we decided to go our separate ways.”
Watching Potter remove his coat and accessories before sitting across from him at a table in the corner of the first pub they had visited, it occurred to Draco this was possibly the longest amount of time he had spent alone with Potter voluntarily. He was surprised to find he hadn’t loathed company for the most part, especially when he thought back on their relationship, or rather the lack of one, only a few years ago. Harry knew more about Muggles and it did get up Draco's nose, since it was now a part of his job, but he could live with it.
"You're welcome, Potter. Now, if you'll excuse me, there are others that need my attention." And Draco turned to leave.
Draco wandered into the kitchen of Grimmauld Place to find Harry sitting at the table perusing the Daily Prophet.
Potter was dressed in similar attire to Draco’s; long black coat, dark denim jeans, dark grey woolen gloves and a burgundy scarf with a matching beanie covering his usual mess of black hair.
do it." Harry looked up to find Draco standing in front of him. He felt a slight flutter in his stomach and the pain in his shoulder was suddenly more bearable.
Draco turned his head to find Harry standing only a few feet behind him. “Now, was there anything else I’ve missed or that you think I should be doing? Perhaps placing myself beneath the tree with a big red bow around my neck?” Draco teased. He remembered the first Christmas song Harry had played for him.
“Oh, right,” Harry said, glad he didn’t have to explain but wondering what Draco had said to his son about him.
He couldn't keep from putting his foot in it, could he. “I dunno. I guess I wouldn’t have been so surprised to see you here… at Hogwarts... in the staff room. Especially when I didn’t think I’d be seeing you for a couple of months.”
Harry didn't need his glasses to know it was Draco who had come to treat him, but he tried to search for them anyway. He wanted to see what Draco was going to do to him.
It seemed a little absurd to think the saviour of the wizarding world would want to date him. He’d been a Death Eater. He'd tormented and teased Potter every opportunity he got, both inside and outside of Hogwarts. Harry had rejected his friendship in their first year, but he had also rescued him from the fiendfyre and defended him during the trials after the battle.
Draco obliged, almost on instinct moving to the same platform he’d stood on as a child. As soon as he was settled a measuring tape shot to his side from a shelf at the back of the room and started taking his measurements of its own accord.
“Show-off,” Draco said under his breath and flicked through the pieces of paper. It seemed all the things he had written on the parchment were still intact.
Draco pushed Harry back so he sat on the edge of bed then slid down onto his knees and began working at the trousers Harry wore under his robe, finally releasing the hard cock from it’s confines. He wasted no time engulfing it in his mouth resulting in a satisfied gasp from Harry and hands running through his blonde locks. Working his mouth over the large member, one hand on the base and the other on Harry’s inner thigh, it wasn’t too long before he felt Harry trying to thrust up into his mouth and then cum shooting down his throat.
They looked into each other's eyes and for a moment all was quiet. Then the doorknob creaked, loudly. Draco's attention snapped to the door. He could see the knob slowly turning.
“Are you serious?” Draco asked. This made Harry burst with laughter, falling back onto the sofa, his glass still in his hand, shaking along with his body as he laughed.
As Potter made his way towards the counter, Draco started to aggressively polish the brass money register with the old rag.
There were now quite a few people queuing in front of her. Harry joined them, taking out his folded prescription from his pocket.
Draco was smiling warmly at Frida’s festive retelling of her memories. “She sounds a lot like you, Frida.”
“Yes, it normally is. But he said he had an emergency and really had to leave. I checked him over, and though he was still walking very slowly, he was able to apparate. I didn't want to force him to stay, Potter, he was very distraught. You were sleeping in the quarters and I didn't want to bother you, either. I checked over his file and read all your notes. My judgment was also largely based on what you had written.”
“What the fuck! Where the fuck is your cock?!” Draco remained silent, his heart beating frantically inside his chest. The man grabbed him again; this time with an intention to hurt him.
"There are a few places in Diagon Alley where I noticed them. I never did before, and….I don’t know why I didn’t….but anyway. I can bring more if you like them.” He gave Draco a shy smile.
“Thank you. For everything.” Draco felt his face flush. Both from the heat of the water and the warm smile on Harry’s face.
“I just can't trust medical people, Potter. I'm not sure you'd understand. Thank you for finding me and saving my life, but besides the few muggle doctors who did my chest surgery and helped me with hormone replacement therapy, I've had very bad experiences with everyone else. I can't even have a broken bone or the flu, things that have nothing to do with my private junk, without them making a big deal and somehow relating it to gender identity. Very few people know that I'm a transsexual. And I intend to keep it that way.”
When he arrived at his shop the following morning, he saw a long branch of jasmines laying down on the counter. Potter’s graciousness made him smile. He took the flowers to the back room.
After half an hour, when the last customers had left the store, Potter was still near the fireplace, squatting near the flames. Frida gave Draco a look of surprise and Draco nodded, acknowledging who she was referring to. She flew to the back room and Draco took out his white flannel to clean some empty bottles. Harry walked up slowly to the counter.
“So the man you slept with,” Harry’s heart tightened with envy he didn’t realise he was capable of, “he doesn’t care about you?”
Just then, Blaise and Pansy slowly made their way into the room; sad and serious looks on their faces.
“You feel incredibly warm, Potter.” Harry quickly took off his jacket, throwing it on the floor and gently pushed Draco flat on his back, getting on top of him. He kissed him hard on the lips.
“Nah, I don’t care. More money or less money won’t change him if he’s already changed for the better. I hope you’re right and that he has. Meanwhile, get rid of those headaches alright? That’s what I care about more.”
“Mmmm…..cold, are we?” He said, smiling, his lips plump and red from the kissing. He touched Draco's hair again, sweeping it back tenderly from his eyes. “Let me warm them up.” He gently pulled up Draco’s undershirt over his head, and took one of Draco’s nipples into his mouth, sucking gently. Draco didn’t have a second to think about his exposed body. The alcohol in his system made him lose all inhibition and Potter’s mouth was simply amazing. He felt his cock getting hard.
After some time had passed, Draco was still absent. Harry told himself to wait just a bit longer. There were more people now walking into the shop. He kept hearing the front door bell frequently. He heard a particularly loud man talking a few feet away from him.
. Harry kept telling himself as he prepared to see Draco Malfoy in the nude. Both guilt and embarrassment crept inside of him. Malfoy had no idea what was happening and this bothered Harry immensely.
Draco was confused. “Yeah, sure.” He brought out a chair for them both and placed them side by side in front of the counter.
“And the paperwork? Will it say female?” Draco asked, feeling anxious and exhausted at the same time.
“I'm hoping they will with time and more dittany.” He picked up one of Draco's legs and slowly bent it back toward his stomach. “Let me know if it hurts too much and I'll stop.”
“I’m so sorry,” Draco said, and he meant it. Harry faced him again, with a small smile on his face and glossy eyes.
Harry swallowed in heartbreak and disappointment but feigned indifference when asking, “I didn't release him. He was under my care. Isn't that the rule?”
“Nice to meet you. I am Vasilia, Vaso for short. This is Petraki, my assistant.” Peter gave a smile and a quick wave. “Vee vil go to the bedroom through the kitzen.” Vasilia and Peter walked around, carrying some items in their hands.
“Yes, Draco?” Then it happened. If he had mistaken Potter’s hand on his shoulder as just something friendly, then there would be no confusion about what came next. Harry carded his fingernails through Dracos’ hair, running them all the way to the back of his neck. He rested his hand there, pressing his forehead on Draco’s. They both kept their eyes open.
Harry shut his eyes in defeat. He looked at Draco, who looked like he had passed out from exhaustion.
“I have something, actually." He turned around to open the glass door of his locked potions cabinet and took out a corked bottle with a bright orange liquid inside.
While the water was boiling on the stove, Harry decided to look through the booklet and potions with Goodridge’s instructions. He walked to the cupboard to grab a box of pasta, still holding the booklet in his non-dominant hand and continuing to read.
“You see, dear,” she cleared her throat as she continued, “Emotions know how to swim in alcohol. You’re not really concealing them. You are in fact, heightening them to some degree.”
Malfoy doesn’t deign Harry with an answer, instead choosing to walk away, his boots clacking as they hit the floor. Harry watches him go, bewildered and confused at the exchange. Everything about Malfoy was confusing now. Ron had broken his nose, by accident, in Defense, and there hadn’t been a single outburst or dramatization, and now? he volunteered to tutor harry? It was beyond strange.
The first month back at Hogwarts was the worst. Harry didn’t know his place in the castle: was he the hero that every student in the castle looked up to? Was he supposed to be scary? Was he supposed to corral the children? Prove that Dumbledore was right about him? That he
McGonagall had invited him back to Hogwarts on two conditions: he pass a set number of NEWTS, and he didn’t step a
Harry reaches up to touch it, “Merlin, that hurt,” he says, eyes wide and adrenaline pumping through his veins.
“Are you serious?” Draco hisses at Potter immediately after they leave the Defense classroom. Draco can’t believe his luck. He knew he was bad at Defense, and he knew he couldn’t improve, no matter what Potter or Vargas did. Draco had hoped he could coast through the class, scraping by with the worst of marks, and failing the NEWT, but it seemed in vain.
Harry stares at him, eyebrows furrowed a little, “save them with me. we’ll make the pain stop,” Harry promises, a hand outreached.
“Neville didn’t have confidence in his spells. You don’t either, Malfoy.” Harry says, crossing his arms over his broad chest. “It’s an easy fix, though. Just practice.”
“Malfoy’s not an arse anymore,” Harry groans. “Well, he is, but not all the time. And now I’m tutoring him in Defense, and he’s supposed to be tutoring me in Potions, but he’s not doing a great job. And it’s not an issue for me to be around him
Harry's impulsive and once again forgets that not all people can be saved. He watches as the swatch of platinum hair tips off the side of the tower, and Harry lunges forward, no logical thought in his head except to save this boy. and he jumps off the edge of the tower, hurtling through the air.
understand what she’d said wrong to lose his interest in the moment. Maybe it was the meds from the hospital wing? maybe.
“Yes, I get it! My eggnog isn’t the best, but that’s why we bought extra from the store. Shush.” Harry laughs at Draco, and a warm feeling passes through Draco as Harry smiles.
She smiles a little, won over, and sits back down, patting the ground beside her, “come, I’ll tell you what I’m reading about.”
This week it’s Sophie Roper, a pretty Gryffindor girl. She’s tall, almost taller than Harry (he had a growth spurt this past summer, just a couple inches). She’s got this beautiful blonde hair, always tied back, the few stray strands framing her usually smiling face.
“Hey, Potter, you too, stay,” Vargas says gruffly, finally looking up. Draco’s jaw drops open, intending to state his disapproval of the situation. Vargas holds up his hand.
Shaking his head, Draco focuses on the current situation, suddenly aware of how Blaise and Pansy are manipulating this situation. Both of his best friends are smart, maybe smarter than Draco in a lot of ways, but this time, Draco caught on.
“Harry, Harry, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you,” the words are whispered and Harry does not hear them, but Draco chants his prayer at the beautiful teen for trying. For trying so hard to catch him, to save him. He’s lost hope, waiting for the ground to hit him, the sun blotted out by the clouds above him, and simply shadows below him.
Harry lifts his wand watching Malfoy as he does so. Malfoy flinches at the wand, and Harry stumbles back a few steps.
, seems to skyrocket. He throws them easy smiles, shoulders relaxed as the school seems to breathe in tune with him. Two years ago, the girls’ eyes would’ve felt like danger, like they burned holes in his skin, but now, he relishes in it. All it means is he’s safe, he’s cherished, he’s
“Shush, Harry,” Hermione interrupts, “Pomfrey’s going to take a look at you. Let’s go. Professor Slughorn, do you mind if I take Harry down to the Hospital Wing?”
His hands clutch the broomstick he’d made sure to take as he’d jumped off the tower and Harry leaps onto it, a move he’d perfected over the summer. Harry leans forward on the stick, attempting to go as fast as he can to catch up to the other boy as he falls through the air.
“Potter. You, you’re sure about this, right?” Malfoy asks, a little taken aback at the easiness in which Harry had agreed.
exercise,” and winks at him. The two teens burst into laughter as the rest of the hall watches them laugh.
Draco's face twists as he watches Potter shrug and fall into the chair beside him, loose-limbed without a care.
Draco leaves Harry in the entrance to the apartment, taking Harry’s things with him to their singular bedroom.
Harry loves his boyfriend, he does. He loves him with every fiber of his being, but some days are harder than others. He's tired. Too tired to listen to Draco chat about his day, to listen to him ask questions about Harry's day, to hear the politics of the city and the problems they may face in the upcoming year.
“For you, Harry? Always.” Ginny replies. She waves away the young girls sitting at her feet, a collective groan coming from them. “Shhh. I’ll be back later! Go do some work, I’m sure Slughorn’s assigned you some.” She says, shooing the girls away.
Vargas holds up a hand and levels Draco with a serious gaze, “I seriously don’t doubt you’re a smart kid. You know your stuff, and it’s obvious you’re scared of this class,” Draco opens his mouth to interrupt, glancing surreptitiously back at Potter, but Vargas shakes his head, cutting off any attempt of Draco’s.
Hogwarts didn’t have rain. But today it was cloudy, the sky was angry, and the castle’s magic was grieving. The castle had loved Sirius Black, his laughs and antics beloved by the magic, a harmony that soaked the tapestries. His loss, coupled with the upcoming slow death of the Headmaster crippled the castle’s love.
“Listen Potty,” Draco spits, “I can figure it out myself. I’ll tutor you in Potions, but I don’t want your help.” He scowls at Potter and watches the other boy wrack his brain for a sufficient answer.
“I-, I’m not sure that’s needed,” Harry intervenes, a little perturbed by the thought of learning from Malfoy.
Slipping out of the library, Draco heads for the dungeons, his thoughts scrambled by the sight of Potter. He bursts into the Slytherin common room, the eerie quiet of it unsettling him. There is a lone girl in the corner, head buried in some thick tome. Draco doesn’t remember her name. Before Draco even has time to open his mouth, the young girl, who’s a fourth year, Draco’s sure of that much, says, “everyone’s down at the pitch.”
“I’ll take him!” Pansy cries softly, wrapping a manicured hand around Draco’s bicep. He keeps one hand on his nose as it aches, and shoots an angry look at Weasley. The other student raises his hands, “Hey! It’s not my fault. I didn’t know you were this
“Like a man? Like a man?” Malfoy repeats, almost swallowing the words, “I’m not a man. I’m a boy” he spits. “I am sixteen years old. I’m a kid, Potter. Not a man.”
“Hey. Li? Su Li? Is that you?” Harry watched as the pretty girl in the back of the bookstacks stood from her cross-legged position, her face obscured by a sheet of dark hair. She pushes back the strands and smiles toothily at Harry, albeit a little taken aback that he’s spoken to her. Harry Potter had always been
“You need potions tutoring, Harry,” Slughorn says bluntly and glances at Malfoy, “and Malfoy here is one of our better students. He’ll tutor you.”
Harry rubs Draco’s back as he cries, whispers soothing words to Draco, letting him get all the tears out. They aren’t criers, but when they do, their other half is always there to support them through it all. Draco gasps a little in an attempt to control himself, and he sits up, his grey eyes red-rimmed.
“Class! Split up, each house in one corner.” The defense professor orders, a tall, scarred man from Spain, his accent thick. Professor Vargas was… difficult. He had little patience for students with attitude, and students with any connection to the Dark Arts, so Draco was immediately branded as his least favorite, and Potter? The favorite.
Ginny pats the seat beside her, eyes bright from laughter. Settling down in the seat, Harry leans a head on Ginny’s shoulder, and she wraps an arm around him, their easy embrace a constant in Harry’s year. Even though they’d broken up, Harry can always count on Ginny to be
"Hmm, Harry. once you get looked at by Pomfrey, please come speak to me,” Slughorn says, looking at Harry with those worried eyes that every adult had given him throughout his time at Hogwarts; the pity mixed with worry for Harry's mental state.
The little sparkle in Harry’s eyes when he casts a spell, the lip bite when he struggles with a potion, it was all the little things. It hadn’t started out that way. At first, Potter's fidgets in class and muted groans after a failed spell felt like spiders crawling up Draco's spine; he wanted to swat them away, and when he couldn’t, the anger grew. It was rare that he would speak on these feelings; he feared the wrath of the entire Gryffindor house, not willing to submit himself to anything more than glares and shoulder shoves in the halls.
Harry creeps closer to the boy, careful to keep quiet, “I'll tell you why I'd want to jump off the tower, if you tell me.” Harry says suddenly, sure that this exchange of information would tempt bully malfoy.
Harry’s eyes widen slightly, and the shy smile on Malfoy is a bit unsettling. Harry immediately wants to get rid of it, feeling more comfortable with a sneer.
“I think the castle told me you were here. I looked up, and I just saw you. Maybe you could come down and greet me? Like a man?”
Draco’s not sure why he closed down the conversation, but he has a feeling he couldn’t take anymore talk about Severus. Even thinking about his dead godfather made him feel like his emotions were going to snatch his leg and lead him into a downward spiral. He wasn’t sure if it was anger or sadness, or maybe a mix of them both. Anger because Sev had been a spy and never told him and had gone and died alone, or sadness because Sev had been a spy and never told him and had gone and died alone.
He finds himself staring at the empty seat in front of him, hands trembling on the empty table— the day’s troubles usually leave him with little appetite and little energy to eat at all.
Looking away, Potter shrugs. “It was an accident, not like he gave it to me.”  Draco can’t seem to process what Potter’s telling him. Severus had been an extraordinary potioneer, but annotating a potions-making textbook? And letting it fall into Potter’s hands?
Harry kisses Draco on the forehead, “Nothing to apologize for, my love. Let’s visit your friends this weekend?”
This catches Malfoy's attention, and the boy turns again, just his head this time. His jawline sharpens against the blue sky, and Harry can only see half his face this way, but he continues talking, too scared that Malfoy would turn back around.
Lifting his wand, Malfoy carefully casts the spell, the shield shimmering strongly ahead of him. Within a few seconds, however, it seems to shudder and fall as Malfoy loses confidence in his spell. Harry’s interested. He has Malfoy run through spell after spell, each showing the same strength for a few seconds, and then spectacularly failing, even the offensive spells.
It loved all its students, some more than the other, but today, it was grieving, and could not bear to lose another student widely beloved by the castle's magic. A few wisps of magic reach out, alerting another, another beloved student, one who the castle’s heart beat for.
many people out there to teach us about everything. I love you, and I know you love me, but how can we know we’re the best for each other when you’ve never experienced otherwise?”
“Are we talking about Draco’s obsession with Potter, again?” Blaise swings his arm over Draco’s shoulder, his dark skin a beautiful contrast with Draco’s pale complexion.
“Do the first part,” Draco replies, “but I don’t need you messing up my food!” He laughs a little at that and turns back to the kitchen. Harry doesn’t watch after Draco, instead walking to the shower.
“Piss off,” Malfoy mutters, and raises his wand at Harry’s face. Coming to a sudden realization, Harry pauses.
“Well obviously, Harry! A boiling potion exploded in your face! Why can’t you ever be more careful!” Hermione has a worried look on her face, berating him.
Potter had been healed by Pomfrey and sent back to class, and looks excited to be in the one class he excels at.
Draco turns his head, almost turns his body, and stares at the other teenager. He watches the other boy watch him like he’s a scared cat.
Slowly, Malfoy reaches down to pick up the wand, and whispers, “Lumos.” The tip of the wand shines, almost blindingly. A smile breaks across Malfoy’s face, and he holds the wand close, cradling the wood to his chest.
“I don’t need the Defense NEWT. It doesn’t matter if I pass or not,” Draco says stubbornly. He hikes his bag further up his shoulder, hand gripped at the strap.
“Draco! Why do you look like that?” Pansy said, bounding into his room, Blaise trailing behind, head down untangling some necklace his mother had sent him.
"Oh, I probably should have mentioned," Pansy smiled angelically, "Blaise and I did cast a compulsion charm on the drinks before you lot got here. There's no lying in this game, darlings."
Neville shrugged. "Maybe that's why he threw a party for so many people. Maybe he wanted the Manor to seem less empty."
"Excellent questions," Wescott said. "Ones I have no doubt you'll find the answers to. However, in the meantime, there's been a change of plans regarding the case."
Draco stilled, feeling a hot swoop of guilt sear through him. He couldn't tell Potter the real reasons why Pansy and Blaise had been so okay with the two boys being together from the very beginning; he couldn't confess to Harry that it was them who had pushed him to first seek out the Gryffindor for less-than-moral purposes. He couldn't ever tell Harry just how manipulative and self-interested the three Slytherins really were, despite the fact that they really all genuinely did like Potter; even Weasley had become less of a wank-stain than usual as the night had gone on.
"It's fine, Harry," Hermione said gently, placing a warm hand over his own. "It's understandable, pulling away like this, after everything. We just want you to remember that we both love you and we're always right here." Ron nodded vigorously beside her and Harry smiled a sincere smile at them both.
"Um," Draco began uncertainly, unsure how to respond. Was this how Potter had felt the previous night when Draco had first approached him out of nowhere?
"Good. That—that's good. Boyfriends are definitely good." Potter colored further and Draco decided it was a very good look on him.
"None of them deserved it, Draco," Harry whispered, kissing Draco's closed eyelids. "They didn't, and you certainly don't. I know there's still so much mistrust and prejudice and suspicion in this world, and that things are still so intense and polarized even though the war ended years ago, but they're all wrong if they think things are so simple. The war seemed to put every single person into this 'either/or' mentality, where people still can only see things in such harsh extremes and ugly absolutes, still seeing the world split into Mudbloods and Death Eaters and Muggle-borns and purebloods and Gryffindors and Slytherins and good versus evil, but that kind of thinking is what led to the war in the first place. Slytherins and Gryffindors are both just as equally capable of doing horrible things. After all, Voldemort had both Houses in his inner circle."
"It means that they're still with McGonagall," she said, clasping her hands in her lap as she eyed Harry carefully. "I took them immediately to see her before they could actually go through with any of their awful plans, but before I did…"
, Ron," he snapped, feeling anger and pain sweep through him at the memory of the Hospital Wing. "You weren't there, okay? You don't know what it was like, you don't know what happened!"
," Blaise explained. "But you will, love, you will, because I'll prove to you that you can. I love you, Draco, and I'll prove to you that I love you. Just let me show you." As he spoke he rose smoothly from the armchair and took a step toward Draco, who instantly shot to his feet and began backing away. "I love you," Blaise repeated in a serious voice, continuing to stalk closer to the blond.
"I promise, my dearest Pansy, if things go well tonight I shall spill all," I vow, pausing to cast several teeth whitening and breath freshening charms before smiling widely and spreading my arms. "Yes?"
"Perfect, huh?" The mattress creaks slightly as she rises and saunters across the room to stand behind me. "So who is this mystery date, then? Is she prettier than me?"
Does Draco play what? Turning his stare from the wall and breaking his own rule set in place not even two minutes ago, he turned to look at Potter. "Play?" he echoed questioningly.
"Padma! Goddamn it! Just fucking—" he reached out to clutch at her, swaying forward on his feet, and for a moment Harry was worried that he meant to shove her away, but with a wild gasp he collapsed against her, sobbing bitterly into her shoulder.
"Whatever turns you on, Harry, I make no judgments," she laughed, swinging their arms. "And speaking of evil people and the dating of them…"
That brought the slightest of grins to Harry's face and Malfoy smiled in return. At the sight of that smile—that
"Yes. This land is on my family's estate." As he spoke, he turned away from Harry, as though wanting to hide his face. "It's not anywhere near the house, I promise! It's just that—I know this land, so I know all the best spots and I know that we would have total privacy, and the forest is magically charmed to remain green like this. All the other forests I could have taken you to are all cold and dead and wintery, and I didn't want some ugly, dead forest for our picnic. So, I brought you here, but…I-I suppose I really should have asked if that was all right first, shouldn't I?" Draco shot him a nervous look before sitting up and pulling his hand free. "Fuck, Harry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for this to be a bad surprise. I know that this place doesn't hold good memories for you…"
Harry trusted in the man he loved, and nobody would ever make him doubt either Draco or what they had between them.
Draco closed his eyes, praying for the strength to get through that encounter. Christ. The entire time he had been panicking about the upcoming meeting, he had never imagined that
For several seconds Malfoy did not respond, but eventually, he glanced up to stare at Harry with an odd expression on his face. "All of these are, you know," he gestured around at the shelves.
