I was so focused on Malfoy’s worried face, I didn’t understand when he turned his face and stared at me. I stared back at him, frowning, and he nodded his head in Flitwick’s general direction. I frowned harder, and looked at Flitwick. The professor was looking at me too, as was the rest of the choir. I hated being in the spotlight, and I didn’t get it why everyone was looking at me.
It had also been a month since they had touched each other sexually. Harry didn't ask, and he knew that even if his body woke up excited, he wouldn't be able to ask for it seeing Draco's sad face. He was losing a battle he didn't know how to win. He didn’t know the rules or what was expected of him.
Harry didn't question him. He didn't want Draco to be uncomfortable and he knew that this moment wasn’t simple. Draco felt guilty for what happened, and even though Harry told him it was nobody's fault, Draco didn't seem convinced. Harry tried to make Draco understand that he had his full support, but several times he heard him crying in the middle of the night.
“Aren’t you a smart arse?” Harry smiled at him, and Draco smiled back, rolling his eyes and going to the bathroom to shower.
They fell on the bed, and Draco scooted back so he was in the middle of it. Harry placed himself between Draco’s legs, kissing his neck and shoulders, going down and finding a nipple with his mouth, sucking lewdly, biting and rolling it with his tongue. Draco moaned loud, the cold night forgotten with the fire within him. Harry sucked on it hard one last time, before kissing down his ribcage, stomach and groin, breathing in Draco’s scent.
“We were trying to warn you... The island has... Many coral reefs, and many strong currents around. It is impossible to get in or out.” Draco replied, and the man looked at the remains of what was left of his boat. A few wooden boxes floated to the beach, and he shook his head.
, which made the boy stand up straighter and look up to the chandelier, widening his eyes when he saw it was gone.
“We might have, but I’m not sure if he screamed before or after. And anyway, when I spell the photograph it will probably show his scream.”
. Of course, Draco never stopped being the spoiled brat he was, and he loved Harry’s attention. But the baby… Well, he just wanted to hold a baby and take care of them and be a good father, while having fun on the process of making one.
“So you want me?” Draco asked, and Harry flushed, not knowing if it was weird or not to reveal his most dark dreams.
I thought to myself. Indeed, we were closer now than ever before. I mostly just teased him to make him laugh nowadays, after I discovered he thought I was funny. And, that naughty little fox inside of me who wanted to roll and show its belly for our mate was incredibly insistent that I just accept the offer. It would give us more time with Harry –
“What do you mean?” Harry frowned harder. He didn’t really want to be anyone’s nanny, but he couldn’t help but understand why she picked him. Harry knew any other person would most likely not care enough or do him harm, or not be taken seriously.
“I just told you I’m a genius and I design big arse machines, but the money part is always what sticks, I guess…”
At the end of the day, Draco had a new team, and they came up with a plan for their training. Harry couldn’t see them, of course, since of course, they were on opposite teams. So Slughorn volunteered to observe them as they trained. On that same day, Goyle approached Harry, breathing in hard before talking to him.
“Dracy... It's a girl... We have a girl…” Harry said, still in disbelief, and placed the baby in Dracy's arms. She was small, with a wet tuft of black hair on her head - or very dark hair, since the light from the flames didn't let them see right. She was crying loudly, but soon calmed down when Dracy placed her against his chest.
“Give her to me, Harry. I want her with me.” Dracy said, the manic look still in his eyes. Harry didn't like that look, but he handed the baby over anyway.
Draco smiled, feeling that pleasure coil in his lower belly. After they got married about a year ago, Harry confessed he had a kink after a couple of firewhisky cups. That surprised Draco because Harry was the most vanilla lover he had ever had. It didn’t mean they had bad sex, no. Harry was a thoughtful lover and Draco had never come so hard before he was in Harry’s hands. However, other than the regular positions one would fuck in, Harry wasn’t really into pain play or dominance or binding him, like other guys Draco had sex in the past did. No, Harry
“House elves can only find people to a certain extent. A house elf would not be able to enter a place protected by Secret Keeper. Whoever captured Malfoy and Potter hid them very well... Or, they're not even alive anymore.”
Hermione scent changed as well when she presented at fourth year. Me and Ron hadn’t presented yet, so it was a bit… Weird for both of them. Hermione was a blossoming young woman, and Ron was… Well, technically a pup. He didn’t even know he was alpha yet, and all his family thought he was going to present as beta. Seeing his mate being snatched by an older alpha broke him somehow, and he didn’t even know how to act around her, because although he liked her, his brain was still of a child’s. Mine was as well, and I couldn’t even notice she was having dates with someone. When he presented the next year, things were strained, although they both new they were mates by then.
They walked side by side to the Great Hall and walked to the Gryffindor table. Draco immediately lowered his head, walking one step behind Harry. Harry sat in front of Ron and Hermione and Draco sat by his side.
Deep down, Harry also felt guilty, so he wanted to please his lover even more, every day. He didn't know where the feeling had started, but at the moment he realised his love for Draco, his need to make him happy at any cost only grew.
“I... I came to a conclusion,” She said, and Harry nodded for her to continue. “Being Lucy is also not... Exactly what I feel.”
“Because I spoil you rotten and I have a 10 inch cock.” This was Harry’s turn to smile smugly, and Draco couldn’t help but kiss his smile.
I should think he was hideous. But my steps failed me, and I could feel my whole body responding to his presence alone. I could feel my hole slicking up in excitement, and I hoped no one would smell my arousal. Once I stopped near him, though, his nostrils flared, and the green of his eyes was tainted with a yellow colour.
And then I felt it: small hands in mine, grey eyes looking up at me, and the softest smile. That magical jasmine and mint scent surrounded me, and I could finally breathe.
“This is Aries. See? There’s an A under his left foot,” Harry showed said foot to Saturn. “You already know your letters, don’t you?”
“Should I convince you to stay with me?” Harry asked, putting a strand of my hair behind my ear and pulling me up so he could give me a kiss. I moaned softly, and he ended up convincing me well as I rode his cock while he grabbed my tits from behind, torturing my nipples as if milking me. I came as hard as the first time, even when my body was already tired.
We walked hand in hand to the Great Halls so we could have our Christmas supper. The fairy lights were shimmering, the trees tall and beautifully decorated on the sides of the halls, and the food was smelling delicious. Before I could actually take the courage to release his hand so I could go to the Slytherin table, Harry stopped, turning to me.
“Yeah… As long as I could before it was too much to handle,” Harry said, kissing him on his temple. “What do we do now?” Harry asked, a pinch of insecurity in his voice.
“It will sink. We need to get him to go around,” Harry announced, and Draco nodded. He knew that from that distance whoever was on the boat - which was a medium-sized one, probably for small loads - had seen them both at the beach.
“The photographer should be here any time now. I expect you all to be on your best behaviour,” Harry said to the boys. Sirius rolled his eyes, his fist squishing his cheek as he laid his head on it. “Don’t roll your eyes at me, boy! It’s just a picture.”
The slashing, pulling, and throwing had taken the same speed as his breathing, and he was already pleased when he heard a shriek from where Draco was. Worried that he had hit a coconut in his head, Harry got down as fast as he could, watching the pile of leaves Draco had separated, along with some twigs. malfoy was squirming a few feet away and didn't seem to have a concussion.
“Actually... I have a plan. It's crazy, but it’s our only way out of here,” Harry said, turning to him and crossing his arms over his pecs. “First... We can start trying to apparate without a wand. Which is far more dangerous than any other plan.”
They stood there, awkwardly looking at any other direction except each other, their silence heavy in the confined quarters of their room. Harry bit his bottom lip, then decided to break it.
The days passed slowly. There wasn't much to do but explore the island and wait. Every day, they woke up early, ate some fruit and headed for the forest to continue exploring. After a few hours, they headed for the clearing and Harry bathed, while Malfoy just watched. Harry felt strange because he knew Malfoy was looking, but at the same time he felt egocentric because Malfoy
Malfoy sat on the sand, spitting water, and before Harry could say anything, Draco sobbed, a desperate cry coming out of his mouth.
Dracy pushed the placenta a few minutes later, and Harry cut the umbilical cord with two fingers and magic fire, cauterising the cut immediately.
A half an hour later, Harry returned with his shirt wrapped around six small fish. Near the fire, he wiped the fish off their gut with his knife. Malfoy was almost throwing up beside him, grimacing and holding the skewers where they would put the fish. Harry washed them with coconut water and left them baking on the skewers. They didn't really talk that night. They were both worried about what would happen to them at that location, and if anyone would find them. They ate in silence, and finally sated, the tiredness of the day began to weigh heavily. Draco retreated into the small hut they had made, just enough so that they could lie side by side away from rain and wind, and then slept. Harry still spent some time staring at the fire, his eyes and body tired. He wondered what he would do the next day. He needed to find out if they were civilisation around. It didn't seem to have, but it didn't cost anything to look for some human presence. He needed to know whether they were in an island or part of a continent.
“Well, maybe as soon as my cunt feels the regular size again,” Draco shrugged, and Harry laughed a little.
“So… Are you going with me? I promise I’ll talk to the Weasleys before I drag you there with me, and I'm calling you Draco anyways.”
With the holes ready, Harry went to the water, taking a good amount of clay and throwing it into one of the holes before taking one of the logs he had cut - the correct size of the hole - and stuffing it in there, pressing with the down as much force as possible so that the clay embraced the trunk inside the hole. After that, he filled the remaining sides around the trunk with sand and clay, pressing it to make it as firm as possible. He repeated the same process with the other holes, standing in the middle of them with his hands on his hips, watching his work.
“You’ll be with me, right?” I asked Pansy, who was dressed in white, just as me, but in a much more modest way. Her gown didn’t have any lace or form, because she was just a maid, and not a prince as I was.
At that moment, he was thinking that maybe he shouldn’t have trusted Harry that easily. What was done, was done now, though. There was nothing he could do about it now.
“I’m going to talk to Ron and Hermione. Do you want to go anywhere, or…?” Harry started to ask. From now on, he was responsible for Malfoy’s safety.
He stretched to the side of the bed where his jeans were, and grabbed his mobile phone. He opened the camera and gave it to Harry.
“You’re so beautiful…” Harry whispered, and Draco’s eyes widened, his mouth dropped, and his cheeks got pink.
“She’s a girl?” Was Ron’s first question, and the man beamed at them, at the same time that Hermione hid her mouth with a huge smile.
“You've been here for a long time, haven't you?” Roberto asked, and Harry and Draco nodded at the same time.
“You’re going to do well. You were great at the rehearsals.” He assured, and tried to take his hand from mine, but I squeezed it, not letting him go. I needed the comfort from my mate, and he didn’t try to leave.
As she said those words, plates and plates of delicious food appeared in front of them, and Harry stared at the younger faces, how they were delighted and enraptured by the sight.
had changed, and although he still teased Harry, it wasn’t like he was trying to prove Harry was inferior, but as if they were… Friends. Draco was also very smart, and his notes were neat and colour coded, perhaps even more organised than Hermione’s. Even in Harry’s classes, Malfoy paid attention, genuine rapt attention. Harry thought that, maybe because the shadow of Voldemort wasn’t over their shoulders any more, they could really focus on doing what a student should be doing in the first place.
He looked outside, the weather getting worse, the snow clashing against the windows. Inside their home was warm and comfy, the Christmas tree perched in the corner near the wall. Harry’s idea, of course. He and the kids had decorated the tree December first, while Draco supervised with Scorpie on his hip. It was way too soon to have a Christmas tree, but that hadn't ever stopped them before. Here it was in all its glory.
“You were sleeping so good, I didn’t want to move and wake you up,” he said, and I looked up at him. His eyes were again green, and his smile was white and pure. I couldn’t help but trust him completely.
“Yes, Draco,” Harry promised, kissing their baby girl’s hair while hugging his husband, their boys around them smiling and planning all the ways they could torture poor Mark again. “We’re taking a new photograph.”
being pureblood families when they were excluded. So it meant they had old money. And by old money I mean, Estates, houses, house-elves, so on and so forth. My family doesn’t have Estates simply because we didn’t have money to buy those, but my mum has inherited a house from the Prewett side of the family when one of her aunt’s died.”
Happy New Year, guys! Once again, thank you so much for your support. I hope you enjoy this new chapter!
Harry moved slowly against Draco’s mouth, and Draco followed his movements, swallowing down to the base, moaning lowly every time he had room to breathe.
"Morning, princess," Harry teased, and Draco rolled his eyes, flipping him the two fingers. Damn, Draco Malfoy was cute. "Come on, we have a long day of learning to go by today."
“You and me, Seekers game,” Draco teased Harry, holding Castor on the side of his hip, and making Harry smile.
“What if one gets in my ear? In my mouth?!” Draco asked, scared, and Harry threw the caterpillar away, picking up the leaves and dragging them to a firm, dry spot where he could set up camp.
“I don’t want to try anymore,” Draco confessed, his voice hoarse and small. His tears fell down his cheeks, and he tried to hush and clean them before Harry saw it, but it was too late. Soon, Harry was hugging him and putting him on his lap, kissing his hair. “It’s so frustrating, Harry. We’ve been trying for almost a year, and it didn’t happen. I took my potions, I ate healthily, we did it like rabbits and still…”
He couldn't control himself much longer, pouring his hot liquid into her tight entrance, filling it with his seed and feeling an animal pleasure in knowing that it had already taken root inside her womb, and that soon her baby would be showing itself bigger and bigger in her belly.
“Even if he is my mate, which he may or may not be, I’m not… This is not the reason why I want him to go with us.” I explained, and Ron nodded with a grin as if he didn’t believe me but was playing along. “I’m telling the truth!”
Finally, Malfoy’s song had ended, and Flitwick asked us to sing the chorus once again, fixing the tune of the sopranos and tenors as we practiced the same two lines over and over again, until we got it right.
They didn't expect the doors to close and the lights to go out. Wands in hand, they tried to go the other way, find the other door, but apparently that had been orchestrated.
“Malfoy’s going to walk with us, he’ll eat with us and do stuff with us. He’ll have to adapt to Gryffindor schedule, I suppose, or I’ll have to adapt to his schedule. Or both. I’m not sure. Aaaand… I’ll have to go to another dorm with him.”
He was so self-conscious that he noticed way too late Draco’s wide eyes locked on his cock, his mouth opened in surprise.
It really wasn’t far, just a few minutes behind. They crossed a large gate that closed tall brick walls, covered in snow. Alongside the walls, there were tall pine trees, with the peaks white and heavy. The whole ground was also deep in ice, except for the road they were on now, probably cleaned by the same man.
Ron and Hermione were waiting for the call for a while, and once Draco’s water broke, Harry had called them to watch the boys. They arrived with Rose and Hugo, with their overnight bags, congratulating them on the new baby.
What kind of shifter was he? Probably something big, maybe a deer, like his Patronus? It wasn’t uncommon that shifter animals were the same as the Patronus of the wizard.
“Two or three?” Harry asked, finding his wand in his back pocket and conjuring some lube on his hand. He slicked his fingers and pressed them between Draco’s arse cheeks, and his boyfriend sighed softly, pressing his forearm against the wall and his mouth over his forearm.
Harry awkwardly repeated that, and because Draco knew that Harry would do the same to him, he said ‘we can do it, Harry. I don’t think I’m ready for a baby yet, but as long as we’re using a contraceptive spell, you can pretend you’re getting me pregnant anytime we have sex.’
Harry looked at him, the water falling over his shoulders, over his pale chest, pink nipples, soft belly. Draco had a normal cock, which was soft, and he was practically hairless, different from Harry who would have said he was a little bit too hairy if anyone asked him.
“We should make cookies for him tomorrow…” Saturn said, nodding vigorously despite being sleepy. “Can we do it, daddy?”
Summer being the least dangerous one, they had time to think about what it would mean. Draco wasn’t a fan of being hot, so he would constantly sigh and whine about how hot his office was. Harry made fun of him, but he also didn’t like the 25 Celsius Degrees of that place. They were cooking every time they tried to be there with their coats on.
“Malfoy… Politicians, right? I know that name.” Harry said, and raised one eyebrow, the one cut by the lightning.
“Oh, come on, Harry. You’ve seen me naked for months now. You must know I don’t care.” Draco looked at Harry from the shower while he shampooed his hair, not even caring that Harry was there.
Draco hugged me tight, and I hugged him back, before we moved to stare at the crowd clapping. All the other people from the choir were now side by side, thanking the public. His hand never left mine, and I couldn’t help but look at him again, his beautiful smile shining like moonlight.
“Honey and sausages are delicious, I don’t care what you both think,” Draco said, defensively, and Harry only smiled at him.
“My car is stuck in the snow, I can’t move,” Draco said from the inside, and the man looked behind Draco’s car to his own truck, the wheels well prepared for deep snow. The car was tall and powerful, and Draco knew that here was a man who came prepared to help.
“This is so good…” Lucy commented, and Harry smiled, kissing her forehead. They were slowly on the right path.
Harry seemed to relax his body now, but he was shaking from head to toe, his jaw and head aching with tension.
On the next day, as Draco arrived at work, it took him about 10 minutes to open Harry’s office’s door. He was clearly relieved when he saw all his things to one side of the office, and looked back at Harry, his shoes a bit wet.
The movements progressed faster and faster, the sounds of the bodies clashing loudly, mixing with the groans of both. Harry took his other hand from Draco's waist, holding his small cock with his forefinger and thumb, masturbating it to the rhythm of penetration. With so many stimuli in his body, Draco let out a loud groan, his entire body shaking with the strength of his orgasm. The pressure around Harry made him reach his orgasm too, filling Draco with his seed until he felt completely emptied and satisfied.
“What? I have eyes.” Draco raised one of his eyebrows, and Harry didn’t really know what to say to that. He heard that before, of course, but none of those people was
. He was right. My family wasn’t even here to take care of me, after everything they’ve put me through. I didn’t dare look at him anymore, but I couldn’t hold back the tears that fell from my cheeks. It was embarrassing – crying in front of people, of Gryffindors of all people! – but it was also freeing. I dried my cheeks with my hands and nodded.
“And... And... Mango?” Talitha pointed to the fruit, and looked at Harry as if waiting for the compliment.
It didn't take long for Dracy to come, his body arching beautifully while the orgasm made the milk in his breasts leak even more. Harry felt his cock throb, and watched with delight at the image of Dracy in his most sublime state.
He went to the bedroom, and the first thing he noticed was that the room smelt like honey. He looked at Draco, who was sitting on his bed and reading what looked to be a wizarding romance, the same type Mrs Weasley liked to read.
“Yes, just…” Draco walked a little closer to the calendar rock, noting the day they set early when they woke up. “It's May 19th…”
They parked the car and the truck inside the garage. Draco took his bags from inside the car, checked if he had his laptop case and phone with him and walked with the stranger to his house.
friends. Sometimes they would sleep late on the weekends, just talking or playing. They had so many things in common, other than Quidditch. Harry discovered that Draco also loved eating as much as Harry did, although he didn’t do it often in the past. Draco talked to him about the novels he read, and Harry talked to him about the video games he played when he was outside of Hogwarts. They also had Teddy in common, and both of them loved the kid so completely. They made plans of what to do after school, maybe visit Andromeda and Narcissa, go out in a park with Teddy, play Quidditch in Andie’s backyard.
“Of course, daddy! I’m the best at school! I already knew my ABC’s before I even go there! Papa teached me!”
And maybe it was the potions messing with his emotions, he couldn’t tell, but there was a day where he lost all the hope, finally.
After they had breakfast, the school day began. Harry and Draco were glued by the hip and sat beside each other in every class. It felt very odd, not sitting beside Ron and Hermione, but it was also very natural sitting with Draco, strangely enough. Draco
“Draco... It's not your fault. I was there when we had sex, I should have known too.” Harry kissed him in the middle of his forehead, hugging him even tighter. “And if you are really expecting a baby, I will love and care for you and the baby with all my heart.”
“I think we’re doing something wrong. Maybe it’s not really related to me.” Draco said, grabbing an apple and analysing it. “They are so pretty, though.”
I wanted to bring the subject for weeks, but every time I tried, something made me stop. I didn’t know why, because I was used to say everything to Ron and Hermione. Maybe I was scared to be judged, to feel casted aside. I could only have theories, but the truth was, I really wanted to open up about it somehow.
Dracy did not resist. He took Talitha by the arm and held her close to him, kissing her entire face, the joy inside him almost making him forget about Harry beside him.
“I’ve never cared much for Christmas. The parties at the Manor were always grand and beautiful. I also loved them if I ever was at Hogwarts at the time, so I don’t think we’ll need a Christmas celebration.” Draco mumbled, more to himself than to Harry, but the Auror was listening anyways.
I lowered my head once I saw Weasley’s dark stare, and played with the hem of my robe. He was right in not forgiving me.
“And, you don’t need to worry, Mr Potter. I’m sure Mr Malfoy here can help you with the theatricals,” Flitwick said, and although me and Malfoy tried to slither out of it, professor Flitwick ignored us completely.
“What bet?” I asked before I could stop myself, and when Ron’s cheeks turned pink, I raised my hands. “Don’t, don’t say it. I don’t wanna know.”
His host then showed him the house, telling him to make himself at home. It was still early in the day, around eleven AM, although the sky outside of the window was so dark it almost looked like it was night. The sky was even darker than before, and Draco looked at the windows, the cold outside preventing him from really seeing anything.
“Of course I know that, Potter,” Draco caressed Harry’s hand, making circles with his thumb. “Thank you for being an amazing alpha.”
The day was sunny, as usual, but it had rained considerably the night before, which made the ground wet. That was good, since Draco was planting some roots in a vegetable garden he had built next to the cabin. They were giving seeds and Draco knew that this was the only way to get new roots to grow. He needed to plant them while there were still roots available so they wouldn't run out of food. Considering their situation, they were quite provided with food. There were many, many fruits around, fish, oysters and crabs at will, and many roots for them to eat. Draco was sad to have no cereals available, but he was happy to have what they had. He just needed to keep growing those items so they wouldn't run out of food.
staring at us already, and I’m sure they were either waiting for us to punch each other or to kiss each other. Maybe both, if they had a wild imagination. Besides, he was my
Harry cleaned her up with the lake water, removing all the goo that was still on her small body. He didn't care that all of his clothes were wet. Looking at his daughter -
The next half an hour was a struggle, trying to hold Cygnus down and calming down Castor. By the time the toddler was quiet enough for a picture and Cas wasn’t crying anymore, Aries had dropped a shit ton of marbles on the floor, almost making Mark slip all over them again. Sirius and Aries picked up the marbles very slowly, and Harry got a bit worried when he saw a vein pop on Draco’s forehead.
“Yes. Let's go home, Harry.” She said, sighing and pulling him by the hand. “Everything will be fine. We'll be fine.”
The next morning they woke up more cheerful. Lucy seemed more awake, more active, the dark circles around her eyes were gone. They put their clothes back on, going out to take care of their morning routine as usual. After they had showered, relieved their bladders and cleaned their teeth, it was that they realised Roberto was missing.
“I love you, my Tali,” Dracy murmured, kissing Talitha's head. Then he lifted his head, holding Harry by the chin and kissing him on the lips. “I love you, my Harry.”
“I can film me fucking you if you want.” Harry offered, and Draco moaned, his slightly less horny body started to get into full horny mode again.
“Fuck, Draco, I’m going to… Hnnn… Give you all… Your arse is so tight… So wet for me… Tell me you’ll be mine! No one else, just me!”
“I don’t think I’m ready for it yet.” I was honest. My mind was a turmoil, I was confused and feeling guilty. This was
I was trying so hard to control my feelings that I didn’t back away when I felt his arms around me. His alpha scent engulfed me, and I felt nothing but
“Hey, guys! We’re having an early tea today! Would you want to come over?” Ellie, the Department of Secret’s secretary spoke from the door, not even fucking knocking before interrupting them.
“Yucky! Yucky! Yucky!” Cygnus kept screaming, and threw all the beans on the floor, trying to clean his mouth with his robes.
When he walked to his bed, he noticed Draco looking at him with the corner of his eyes. He tried not to think about it. The next day was going to be a very busy day for both of them, and he needed to sleep.
Draco giggled, and it turned into a moan when Harry pressed his cock into Draco’s, making his eyes roll backwards.
Draco turned around when he heard Harry coming, carrying oysters in the bag made with his cloak. In his hands, he carried one of the pots full of salt water. He put everything on the floor next to the fire pit and started making the fire.
“We can try,” Harry admitted that he didn't know, and Malfoy sighed. For the lack of protest, Harry supposed he didn't know anything about making boats either.
A few weeks after Talitha learned her first magic, Harry was cleaning up some roots and placing them in a pot over the fire to cook them when Dracy felt beside him. Talitha was playing with her doll under the hammock, and from time to time she looked in the direction of the fire, as if to verify that Harry and Dracy were still there before starting to play again.
“Summer…. There are little animals, but they’re not eating anything yet.” Draco said, and Harry didn’t stop himself from caressing his back. Draco almost melted in his arms.
“No, Malfoy, it’s okay. You can talk to me, it’s fine!” Harry tried to say, but Malfoy refused to look at him even after they were given their penalties: Community work in a muggle orphanage for a year, for Malfoy. And for Mrs Malfoy, community work in a muggle hospital for a year as well.
That late afternoon, they were looking for small sea grapes that had been dragged to the beach. They tasted like the ocean, but were delicious when mixed with freshly baked fish. Harry was concentrating, squinting to see the contours of the sea grapes when he hit Draco on the back. He lifted his face, frowning.
“Sirius struck again. There are traps in the house, just dismantled one. He might have coached his brothers on it too. Be careful.”
“Yes, Harry! Yes! I want you to make me pregnant, fuck me and come in me until I’m full with your come…!”
he was. My leg was nervously bouncing up and down, and I took a moment to speak, but Minerva didn’t push me and waited until I was ready.
“Terrified. We can... We can die. At the sea. Alone. Without food. We can be devoured by sharks even before we get halfway there. There is so much that can go wrong. But staying here... Staying here is even worse.,” Harry turned his face to his companion and bit his lower lip when he noticed Draco was crying. His body trembled and the dim moonlight that came through the shelter opening illuminated his tears. “Do you still want to try?”
“It feels weird, being here alone with you watching me,” Draco said, opening his blanket cocoon and inviting Harry in.
“Zippity zoppity my mouth is closity.” Harry mimicked zipping his mouth and Draco rolled his eyes, sighing.
“Okay, Draco, so the spell is botched and you were trying for something different. But I need you to stop and breathe, okay? We’re going to fix it,” Harry said, holding Draco’s arms and running his hands up and down them.
“It’s impossible, we tried everything. And I haven’t felt any morning sickness. I think I’d know if I were pregnant!”
Grudgingly, he separated from the other man some time later, leaving the shelter. He grabbed a side piece of coconut and filled it with water to wash his face and mouth, searching for one of the mint leaves they had found a few days earlier in his pocket and chewing. It tasted bitter but left a freshness in the mouth. Despite being ready to leave that island, they had already acquired a routine, and Harry followed it as usual. He separated some fruits, caught some fish and opened a coconut to drink the water and eat the meat.
“He is alive,” Harry stated, running towards the man's contours, while listening to Draco's screams behind him. He didn't understand what he was saying, nor did he have time to try to understand. He threw himself into the water, swimming towards the man, trying to recover from the thud, and pulled him out of the water, swimming as fast as possible to the beach.
Dracy grinned at Harry, approaching and kissing him on the lips. With a sigh, he touched his forehead to Harry's.
“I told you,” Harry said, a bit angrily, turning on the water and showering fast, trying to ignore Draco behind him.
“I don’t waddle,” Draco would reply, and Harry would hold little James’ hand, point his little finger at Draco and pretend he was the baby talking.
Harry cleaned himself fast and tried not to hold on too long to his cock. With Draco being right there, he couldn’t just do it without feeling self-conscious. He finished his shower and towelled himself dry, dressing with the clothes he had brought to the bathroom. He picked his dirty clothes, putting them in the clothes bin near the sink so the elves could clean them, together with the towel.
Harry discovered that Draco wasn't a morning person. Harry had gotten used to wake up around 6, and he did the same the next day. He stretched after he left the bed and opened the window curtains. He heard a small whine from Draco's bed because of the light, although soft, and the Slytherin hid himself under his sheets. Harry rolled his eyes, walking to Draco's bed and pulled his bed curtains closed.
“Your friends, yes. You’ll have time today after you settle.” McGonagall nodded, standing and asking them both to follow her.
“It was... Just a kiss,” Draco said, a slight smile in his voice. Harry pulled his hand away, feeling his whole body on fire, his cock incredibly hard with just that kiss. He wanted to ask if Malfoy was hard, too, but held himself. It was just a kiss.
“Okay. Thank you for warning us, Mr Donahue. Now, do you want to finish off today or should we find a substitute?”
I must have slipped off to sleep at some moment, because when I woke up, my head was on his chest and he was caressing my back. I was sleeping on my stomach, my legs slightly parted and my arse completely exposed.
Other people had solos, too, one of them being Draco. If Harry hadn’t known the arsehole, he would’ve thought that Malfoy was an angel disguised as a wizard. His high voice was soft and angelic, and it was also fitting, especially when he tried on his outfit for the day, a white silky gown that flew as he moved. Maximillian was the narrator, and he had the last song of the show, a duet with Malfoy, each of them at one side of the room as Zabini and Luna met in the middle, finally the Sun and Moon together.
willy,” Harry chuckled and Draco snorted, deciding it was time to get up and put Scorpius in his crib for the next half-hour of his nap. As he walked to the nursery, his mind came back to that moment, nine years ago.
“Yes, I mean… After you protected him at the trials I wouldn’t be surprised if you tried to be friends with him. But that’s not what you were trying to say.”
Oh, yes, I was a king now. I’ve forgotten about that because I was thinking about a thick, long, monstrous alpha cock slicing me in half.
Flitwick considered what Max was saying. I knew, from hearing the conversations between the other members of the choir, that Maximillian’s alpha father was a casualty of the war. He was alive, but he had lost his arms in a werewolf attack, and therefore couldn’t exactly help his omega with the baby for long periods of time. Besides, being only six months after the ending of the war, Maximillian’s family was probably still adjusting to the fact that his alpha father has lost his upper limbs. I couldn’t imagine what it did to Max’s father. It was in our alpha nature, to take care of our omegas and our babies. It was ingrained, like it turned a button once we presented. He must’ve been feeling horrible if he couldn’t help his omega, and I knew Max was going to be needed there, especially now.
I didn’t know what was happening to me. Even though I had come twice, my cock was still hard, my whole body in fire. I needed his knot
Maybe my body was already thinking about Malfoy. I couldn’t be sure, but I knew very well that I was completely obsessed with him on sixth year, to a very unhealthy extend.
At the end of his work shift, Ron headed home. It was late, and Hermione was sitting in an armchair in front of the fireplace reading a book. Rose was playing with some blocks, and her little girl’s face lit up when she saw Ron.
“Damn... Draco... Your mouth is so hot... And wet…” Harry put a hand to his hair, just holding it, without forcing him. He let Draco take control of his movements, and his eyes rolled as he felt his cock press against Draco's throat. “Fuck!”
“So, I suppose you’d like to know who I am.” Harry started, showing him a bench on the kitchen island. Draco sat on it while Harry sat on the kitchen counter, facing Draco. “I’m Harry Potter, and I have a machinery business. I mean, I manufacture and sell big machines for several different industries. Not me, me, but my company. I live by myself, but my family lives down the street. Like… Members of my family own every single house. It’s… a very big family.”
In the end, it didn’t really matter. Here I was, wearing my whitest white clothing, a long and delicate gown that hid me from neck to toes. It had lace on my wrists and neck, and although it had some sort of shape in my waist area, it was mostly made to hide my goods. My hair was worn short, as was traditional for unmated omegas like me, and I had no jewellery on me.
“I vow to serve, to love, and make you happy every day of my life, only stopping once I’m away from you because of my own death.”
“Your connection with me. You have a birthmark, right here in your arse,” Harry touched the place he was seeing the mark, and Draco tried to see it, but it was impossible on that angle. “It matches the one in my groin… I mean, it aligns. When I’m completely deep inside you, they’ll be touching.”
Of course, he didn’t trust himself to tell Draco about these feelings, but he’d never stop being his best friend when his blond little kitten needed him. No way.
“Oh, Madame Hooch was very vocal about your amazing bass voice when in the showers after the games. Besides, you don’t really have an option, Harry. You’ve been picking fights in the Quidditch field, and I thought that
“I think I’m broken,” Draco said after four months of trying, and Harry shook his head negatively, holding him by his arms.
“We’re having classes together, right?” Harry asked, to which Draco replied with a simple ‘hm-rm’. “Do you have any classes that I don’t?”
“Yes, Dray. Eat something. You haven’t been eating properly lately and I’m worried about you.” Harry admitted, and Draco looked down, grabbing a pear to disguise the fact he was embarrassed.
“Well, I suppose if it’s not clear in the main picture, we can take another one with just you,” Mark said, and Draco nodded. Harry sat at his side, putting Castor in his arms and reaching for Cygnus, who didn’t want to take the picture at all.
Harry’s breathing was fast now, and he looked at Draco like he was seeing an angel, his arms tightening around his lover, pulling him together.
Now that they knew what triggered the seasons, they tried another approach with Winter. On the day after the Autumn Episode, they sat at the Ministry’s cafeteria, drinking tea and trying to figure out what Draco would’ve wanted – or needed – related to the season.
Zabini started his solo, looking at Luna as if he never saw someone so beautiful in his entire life. I’ve seen it many, many times, but it was always breath-taking, especially when they were dressed in beautiful, flowy robes, his golden, hers silvery.
“I was just trying to make the temperature different. It wasn’t supposed to be like this. So many important docs have been destroyed, and the autumn tree is destroying my books, and—“
“You’re telling me, the great Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World, likes to suck cock?” Draco asked, his voice a little too loud.
They spent the first day trying to talk to it. They asked it to leave, they told the tree they didn’t need it, they tried to sing to it, dance around and even shooing it. Nothing worked, but the tree actually got angry with the shooing, slapping Draco on the face.
Harry turned to Draco, who was finishing another rope. Draco looked up, watching his partner's work.
Harry moaned again, doing what Draco asked. He had never fucked a bloke before, although he had kissed a few. He started with two fingers, because of the spell Draco had used before, and finger fucked him while playing with one of his nipples with his free hand, rolling it between his fingers. Draco moaned loud, rocking against Harry’s fingers.
“Yes, mango! Delicious! Yum!” Harry licked his lips and rubbed his stomach to illustrate, making Talitha laugh. He did not expect Talitha to raise a hand to the fruit and, concentrating as hard as she could, she made the fruit drop from its branch and float towards them.
According to his notes on the stone, it was May 9th when the cabin was finally finished. It was raised from the floor, and a log staircase gave access to a balcony. There was a door, which Harry and Draco made by braiding jute strings, branches and coconut leaves. It was a sliding door, and as they already saw that there were no large predators on the island, it was enough to keep the most insistent monkeys out of the house. Inside, Harry decided to make three separate rooms. One was a room with considerable space for them to sleep. They covered the bed - which Harry had made with some logs, to lift them off the floor - with soft leaves sheets covered by a braided layer of jute that resembled a long sheet of straw, but Draco was planning to make a mattress out of cotton as soon as he had threads and enough balls. They also made a low table so that they could have some comfort while eating. There were two windows in the first room, which could be closed by doors that fit the hole and were leaning against the wall during the day. Draco's current project was to make curtains for the windows. There was a window in each room, also following the same pattern. They were currently using the second room to store the materials Draco had managed to collect, such as cotton and jute fibers already separated from their leaves. The pots and pans they made with clay were in the area next to the table, and they remade the fire next to the house.
After spending so many days sleeping in leaves and straw, that bed was incredibly comfortable. Harry quickly took off his clothes, and Draco soon followed him out of his own. Harry lay down on the bed and Draco sat on his lap, one leg on either side of his hips. Draco touched Harry's stomach and chest, kissing up from the man's abdomen to his neck.
“Defeated by a fucking tree. Who would’ve thought?” Harry said, sitting under the tree and sighing. A few apples and pears fell to his side, and Draco sat at his right, the fruits between them.
“Great. Me neither. Let's try not to break things around here,” Harry said, and Draco smirked, grudgingly. Harry lit the fire inside the small hole with a complex movement of his hand, the depth preventing the wind from extinguishing the fire. “Rest, ok? I'll find something for us to eat before the light goes out completely.”
“You taste so sweet… But I know where you taste sweeter,” Harry mumbled, and his mouth lowered, his tongue touching his wet hole, making Draco’s eyes roll back. He spread his legs even more, Harry sucking on him, circling his rim with his tongue, pushing in the tip and kissing, his saliva mixing with Draco’s own slick.
“So… Are you guys really staying for the play?” I asked, and Ron raised his head from the parchment he was writing.
“Oh, shush! You were talking to me back!” Hermione smiled at him, and then looked at Draco. “I heard you were going to take Magical Theory again. Do you mind studying with me? You know how these two thick heads are.”
“Well... It's just…” Dracy stood up, turning on her side and running a hand over her belly. There was a round shape there that hadn't been there before, and Harry felt his eyes burn with emotion, his heart pounding and a smile taking over his face even before Dracy spoke. “I'm pregnant.”
Despite his resolve to stay awake, Harry woke up hours later, with a start, as he had not realised he had fallen asleep. By the light from the window, it was still very early, but he felt a terrible urge to throw up when he didn't see Dracy by his side.
The walk was no more than ten minutes, but when they were leaving the woods and stepping on the white sand, Dracy's water broke.
His beard brushed her skin, tingling her as Harry tasted the salt on her skin. He went down, giving little kisses on the mound of her belly, going down between her legs. He made a move to remove her underwear, but saw that she wore none. He smiled.
“Are you offering?” Harry asked softly, and Draco nodded. They had nothing to lose. Either they were trapped on that island forever, or they would die trying to get out. What would a kiss change in that situation? It would probably leave them less lonely.
“Nice to meet you, husband. I can’t wait to fuck that pink little omega-hole of yours and make you come like you never did in your life.”
didn’t ejaculate from her penis, yet she got hard and sometimes released pre-seminal fluid. His theory was that she had no testicles, which was possible with an unconventional anatomy. Still, the amount of lubricating fluid that ran between her legs was enough to make up for the lack of another fluid.
Draco didn't respond immediately, his tears streaming from his eyes toward the mattress. He took a deep breath, thinking of a simpler way to say it. There wasn’t one.
I blushed again, but when I looked up to Harry, he had this utter adoration gaze, like I was something other than a scrawny pale boy with a dark past. I felt Granger’s hand on my shoulder and looked to her. She nodded in agreement to her friends, and somehow, I felt whole. I felt like I shouldn’t doubt myself as much anymore. If these Gryffindors – if these
The first couple of months were amazing. Every time Harry came back from the Pet Shop, they were at it. Draco worked from home, making magical art for a number of clients, but every time Harry arrived, he was naked and ready. Their role play only intensified, and soon they were coming more than they ever had before. Sex was always fun and they never had problems getting into the act, but two weeks later when they did the tests to see if it worked… Frustration always came with negative results.
They set everything up on the next day. They pushed Draco’s office settee to the winter area and grabbed a lot of blankets and pillows from their houses. Harry made some hot chocolate for them, then sat Draco on the settee, putting pillows around him and some blankets over him. Draco looked so comfy when Harry gave him his mug, and Draco sipped it, moaning softly with the taste.
“Fuck me, Harry…” She moaned softly, her hands pulling him by the arms, thumbs pressing against his protruding muscles.
James Draco Potter came into their life as a light in the dark. He was, of course, spoilt rotten by his parents, uncles, aunts and grandparents. He got so many presents Harry and Draco didn’t have space in his nursery, so they decided to donate some of the toys to the foster home that helped them meet little James.
Draco worked where he wanted, whenever he wanted. He had a flat in the capital, but he admitted he liked the countryside better. Less noise and less people. He was actually born in the countryside, but had to move because of his parents’ work. He just never came back. Never had a reason to.
Omegas in the whole world vowed to serve. Of course, giving was the nature of the omega, but now that I paid attention to my new alpha’s words… It sounded almost as if
Potter walked towards her with that stupid alpha confidence, and I had to look away. I hated him, but even I had to acknowledge that he was hot. Probably because he was eating properly now and he had that fucking leather and caramel smell to him, that used to drive me completely nuts. It still did, but it also made between my legs get hot and I just couldn’t give Potter the pleasure of knowing I was attrac—no, better to not even say that word.
. He was glad he had a bathroom of his own – or at least, that he had just another person to share it with – because he saw other boys in the shower, and he knew he was… different. Way too big. He talked about it with Ron once. His best friend was very tall, and he supposed he would have a huge cock too, but for Harry’s surprise, Ron was pretty normal. He said he was 6,7 inches, and although Seamus said
“Well, it was just the first try. I hadn’t even taken the hormones. We still have a lot of time to try.”
“I loved the debut of our new house.” Harry commented, and Draco laughed, lying down next to him without being too bothered by the fact that his legs were a little sticky.
It was two days before the play. Everybody was nervous, Flitwick was being terrible and we were all training our arses off. Pansy had a breakdown because of stress in the middle of the rehearsal over her dress that had a hole in it, and it took us at least half an hour to remember her she was a damn
Harry guided Dracy to the cabin, holding him by the shoulders. He didn't know what had happened at that moment, and he didn't know what was going on in Dracy's head, but he soon sat him in the hammock under the shade, removing the cloths that were wrapped around his daughter, and helped her find Dracy's nipple.
“And after that, I’ll come in you… I’ll fill you up and you’ll get so full of my come you’ll for sure get pregnant. You’ll carry my baby into you… Fuck, you’ll be so beautiful all full with my child…”
Later that night, Harry helped him with towels, soap and toothpaste, and they stopped at Draco’s bedroom door.
. I trusted he would protect me, I trusted I could let go and he would be there for me. I hugged him back, tight against me, and sobbed on his shoulder. He was strong and his smell was so good. I hid my face and let him hold me as long as I needed, allowing myself to not feel guilty because I was being selfish.
“I’m glad you found me today.” He came closer to Harry, and soon, their chests were touching. Harry leaned in, his lips touching Draco’s softly. That lightning sensation took over his body again, and he had to hold Harry’s shoulders in order not to fall down, his knees weak.
He sucked hard from the first second, and he heard as Draco’s muffled moans filled the small alcove. He hummed against his hole, pressing the tip of his tongue into Draco, grunting as he noticed he was already relaxed and a little stretched. Draco possibly prepared before the party. He circled the puckered skin with his tongue, pressing against it over and over, feeling as almost half of the wet muscle breached the slick entrance.
“Sirius, Scorpius, Aries, Cygnus…” Harry counted the boys, all of them in the middle of their living room looking bored out of their lives. Sirius, their eight-year-old, was sitting down moving his feet, looking like he was about to commit murder with how bored he was. The boy had Harry’s dark complexion with Draco’s light eyes. Scorpius was their pale six and a half year old, who was currently trying to entertain five-year-old Aries and three-year-old Cygnus, both dark-haired with green eyes, with a game of toy aurors. He looked around, missing someone. “Where’s Castor?”
Harry took out his wand carefully, wanting not to bother Castor in his arms, and flicked it silently, disappearing with the bucket. He looked at Sirius and gave him
just thinking about it, I’ll fill you up with my babies, fuck my come in you until you’re full with it and then I’ll see your belly grow with the proof we did it.”
Harry slicked his cock with his wet fingers and helped Draco position himself on top of him. He angled his cock head against Draco’s relaxed hole, and Draco started to slide down, his eyes rolling back while he took Harry’s whole cock.
particular voice, was making my shifter animal go banshee inside of me like we had to snatch that man right this second or else people would get him from us.
“Oh, Harry. Of course we are okay. It’s your family, we want you to know everything about them. And if Malfoy is willing to help us… Well, I guess we can try and leave our prejudices behind.”
"Harry, I understand that after everything that's happened, you've been feeling... Nervous. Purposeless,” Minerva’s eyes were fixed at me as if she was talking with a small child, “but I thought that your troublemaker days were over.”
Gradually, both Dracy and Harry began to learn small spells that helped them to have an easier day. Dracy was able to know with his fingertips whether his garden needed more water or nutrients, and Harry was able to levitate fruit for himself instead of having to climb trees to get it. The need made them begin to explore their magic in a more natural and intuitive way, different from how they had learned at Hogwarts. Gradually, Dracy managed to teach Harry the basics of healing, and Harry managed to teach Dracy how to conjure water. In turn, Harry was able to do more than just conjure water now. He was able to transfer clean water from the clearing straight to the pot to bathe Talitha, without having to go into the water with her if he didn't want to, as well as emptying some small puddles on the beach if he wanted to catch a fish without much difficulty.
. Still, I really wanted to give her a name as powerful as her grandma. A name that would remind her that someone incredible is looking after her, but giving her own personality. Also, we didn’t want to upset grandmére Narcissa. So…
It was Tuesday, a normal working day. He was sleepy because he had slept badly. The latter case had exhausted him, but the night before, he and Ron had finally managed to solve it. Robbards had given Ron two days off, which was well received, because Hugo had been born recently and he barely had time to be with his newborn son. Harry had no one waiting at home, not even a cat, so he decided it was best to trade the two days off for the possibility of waking up two hours later on those two days and working as usual.
Draco couldn’t stop the yelp that left his lips as soon as Harry put him over his shoulder, taking him to their bedroom. He put Draco on his bed, and started stripping, making Draco laugh.
“Marvellous.” McGonagall clapped, looking at the Gargoyle in front of the Headmaster’s staircase and said, “Pixie Dust.”
He didn't usually cry with happiness, but seeing his little girl develop made his heart fill with joy.
When Harry got there, he soon remembered he wasn’t going to be able to get in. He didn't know the password, and he sighed, rolling his eyes and settling down to wait. It wasn’t long until Dean appeared with Seamus beside him.
Harry watched as Dracy nursed the two-month-old girl, and huffed, raising a hand and smoothing her black hair.
Draco smiled around his erection, sucking it in with a little more force before pulling away. Harry was taking a deep breath, his body limp and his cock twitched a little with the pleasure he felt.
It wasn’t as easy as Draco thought. They found out the Autumn tree responded to their talking, but it only sprouted more and more apples and pears. It even appeared to giggle when one of the apples fell on Harry’s head, which made Draco fall on the floor, cackling.
Noticing Harry was trying to hold back, Draco turned on his stomach, resting on his shoulders and holding each side of his arse with his hands, opening himself to Harry, offering his hole.
“Malfoy’s back. He’s going to finish the year with us and… McGonagall has asked me to be his bodyguard,” Harry said, and before any of his friends could say anything, he added, “I said yes.”
After planting all the seeds, Draco stood up, touching his chest with his fingertips and making a face. His breasts were still very sensitive, and the tank top he was wearing no longer made his chest flat, as it did before. His small breasts were considerably larger, and they hurt. Draco thought this was due to his menstrual period being close, but the day had come and gone and the little monster had not arrived.
“I promise, daddy,” Sirius said, hugging him again and staring at his parents when they got in the fireplace so they could floo to St. Mungo’s.
The king held my gown by the opening on my neck and ripped it open as if it was made of paper, and soon I was completely exposed. My nipples were hard and red, and he didn’t waist any time before opening his mouth and sucking hard on one of them, his hand kneading the other one, thumb and forefinger pulling hard at the nipple. His tongue was circling my other nipple, and then he sucked hard on it before biting it. I was afraid I was going to come even before he fucked me like he promised.
Harry didn’t know why he moved. He knew he wasn’t supposed to do it, but the moment, and Draco’s face and the feelings inside his chest… He moved forward, his eyes almost closing. Draco’s mouth opened a little, his eyes closing, inviting Harry in…
“Well, I asked McGonnagal how our school schedule would be. I have the one with both of our classes in it.” Draco fished the parchment from his backpack and grabbed his new wand, spelling a duplicate of it and murmuring the spell between his lips. “Here.” He gave Harry a copy and continued with his morning routine.
“Potter. I just wanted to say… I mean, I paid for what I did, too. Just like Draco. Three months of Azkaban, seven months of community work… What I mean is…” Goyle swallowed hard, looking again from Harry. “I’m sorry. That’s what I’m trying to say.”
And try they did. Draco was taking his hormones regularly, and all the vitamins he needed. They tracked when Draco was ovulating and had sex every other day. It was, of course, nothing difficult for them because they just loved it, and it was even better to imagine Harry’s seed had taken root after one of their moments together.
“Harry,” Draco said in return, and they smiled at each other. Perhaps this would be a new beginning of sorts, then.
“You’re… Not a freak. Really not.” Draco said, but Harry didn’t want to listen to him. He shampooed his hair in record time, washed it off and grabbed a towel, practically flying out of the bathroom.
As soon as he got in the headmistress office, Harry saw Malfoy, looking at one of the shelves filled with books. All the trinkets that once were Dumbledore’s were substituted by McGonagall’s, and the sight somehow made Harry’s heart lighter.
“If it is to do what my body wants me to do, I need to go to the sea, Harry.” Dracy said, and Harry nodded, even though he was scared. He took a torch, and helped Dracy walk towards the beach.
He also noticed the stares and the insults. McGonagall was right. If Harry weren’t there, Draco would probably be bullied nonstop.
Harry came back to the bathroom and headed for the shower, putting his shampoo and soap on the designated spaces. They were a few rock shelves on the wall, separated a bit from Draco’s honey shampoo and soap. He took off his clothes and checked if he had closed the door. He had.
Their days became busier with two babies, but for Harry, it was all worthy when he rocked James to sleep and watched as Draco gave Lily the last feed of the night before putting her to bed. Late in the night, Harry would ask to make love to Draco, seeing his milk leave his swollen breasts. It made them even hornier if it was possible, and Draco insisted they came back to the protective spell. Yes, it wasn’t as good with it, but they already had two babies. They could wait for the third one.
“Is that what my girl wants?” Harry asked, hoarse, and to hear Lucy hold her breath, a low moan in her throat.
Harry looked in McGonagall’s direction and saw her talking quietly to a house-elf, who was dressed in a flashy neon-blue dress. The elf nodded, disappearing quickly before McGonagall started eating her food.
Fuck. He was definitely a bass singer, his voice low enough to grab my heart and twist it like it was a physical thing. I knew that being an omega, I was going to be attracted to an alpha, that’s just how things went, but knowing
“I didn't learn, ok? Repairing things?” Draco tossed the empty coconut away, letting the air out of his mouth.
Almost as soon as they crossed their front door and Draco put the booklet and the potion on the table on the side of the door, Harry pounced on him, pressing him against the door, holding his waist and kissing him deeply.
“Hn… Draco, you took me out of a panic attack in the middle of a stage while we sang to the entire school. We are standing hand in hand in the middle of the Great Hall. To be fair, I think this boat has sailed.”
“Shut up your mouth, Potter, or I’ll have to call the second-grade punishment on you,” Draco said, and Harry shut his mouth tight. He didn’t want to spend a whole month without blowjobs. At least it wasn’t as bad as first-grade punishment – meaning, no sex at all.
Draco bit his lip. He was late, and that wasn’t a good sign. His healers always told him that it would be very difficult, maybe even impossible, for a pregnancy to happen, but the signs... Draco felt his eyes swell up with tears, and he didn't know how to deal with it. There was a possibility that he was just running late, of course, but what if it wasn't that? If it wasn’t because of the island life’s stress? He turned, running to the cabin and lying on their bed, which he had finally covered with a fluffy layer of cotton and feathers after he managed to make a kind of pillowcase the size of the bed and fill it with the fluffiest items that he could find. It was comfortable, but it had taken so long to be done... Draco touched his hand on the rustic fabric, feeling some cotton threads come loose, but without dismantling the whole process.
“I… I start working and I lose the notion of time. I forget to eat sometimes, and when I notice, it’s time to go already.”
Harry retrieved the little car, putting it aside and getting for the picture. Mark fixed them as he wanted, and then proceeded to go to the camera, so he could take their picture. Harry could hear Cygnus chomping down on his sweets, and as Mark clicked the button that fired off the camera, Cygnus screamed so loud it made Castor cry, then made gagging sounds, spitting whatever was in his mouth all over his little robes.
He jumped out of bed, not caring that he was still naked, and ran out. Neither of them was at the lake, and Harry ran to the beach, finding no one. His whole body was shaking, and he headed for the other clearing, where he found Dracy sitting in the middle of it, the baby in her covers on the floor between her legs. In Dracy's hand, there were several red berries.
“It’s okay, Goyle. We’re fine.” Harry clapped him on his shoulder, observing that although Goyle was still muscular, he looked much thinner than he was before. Maybe it was Azkaban, maybe it was work, but he too looked very different. “Thanks for talking to me.”
They were having dinner with Ron and Hermione – who was pregnant with the couple’s second child – and Rosie to celebrate a whole month with James. Ron had baby duty since he was the one who ate faster, and he snorted as he rocked his nephew up and down.
He washed his hair, smelling his shampoo first. It smelt like some kind of tree, he couldn’t identify which, and he shrugged. Malfoy smelt good enough for both of them, he guessed. He washed his hair twice, just to make sure it was properly clean, and then soaped his body. He felt weird even holding his own penis because he was so aware of how big it was in his own hand. When he and Ginny had shared their first sexual experiences together, she didn’t let him fuck her properly, she was too scared. Harry understood, and only pushed in half of it inside her. She said she felt good, but he was so aware of how easily he could hurt her, that he didn’t manage to have an orgasm while having sex. Harry knew he was bisexual by then, and he knew it wasn’t that he found her unattractive. Ginny was beautiful. He could actually have orgasms when she was sucking him off because he didn’t have to worry about hurting her then. The problem was when they had penetrative sex. It felt like an insurmountable issue and Harry knew it was one of the reasons why they broke off.
“I think they'll just miss us tomorrow,” Harry said, hugging his knees to his chest. “Two workaholics. Great.”
“You hold yourself in very low esteem. You are the best Unspeakable of that place. Why do you think I always look forward to work with you?” Harry asked, turning his face to look at Malfoy, who looked even redder. His sunburnt was probably getting worse.
“That’s… That’s what it looks like, isn’t it? You randomly save me, you have my snake… I get stuck a few meters away from your house… There’s a lot of coincidences, don’t you think?”
It was a beautiful show, I had to admit. It wasn’t as horrible as I thought, and I actually enjoyed being there. I was part of something, I was contributing in putting together something beautiful, I wasn’t expected to be the centre of attention and, better yet, I didn’t feel like I was falling behind when Ron and Hermione were doing their best.
“Other than writing a mechanic character once, I don’t think I have anything that relates me to you…” Draco said with a bit of disappointment. “But… The snake is enough, isn’t it? I mean, we both have it.”
After way too much food in my belly and my body ready to rest for an entire week, Weasley addressed me again.
“Potter!” He heard a shout, and Malfoy was shoving something into his hands and everything went dark.
In just under half an hour, the small family crossed the fireplace towards Grimmauld Place, now Harry Potter's home. The place had been renovated during the years after the war, but even now, with its creamy and brown tones, white walls and the light that came from the streetlights outside, the house looked dead without its occupant. There was a fine layer of dust on top of the furniture, since, after Kreacher's death, there was no one to do the cleaning while Harry wasn't around.
Harry couldn’t help but look at his face, so innocent and calm. He kept looking at him until it felt uncomfortably hot. The Auror looked around, seeing that none of the snow was there. Actually, the room was split in two now, and they were covered in blankets in the middle of
“I’m ready,” I said, and I walked through the doors of the small area of the Potter palace I was put into to wait for the ceremony. I haven’t talked or seen my future husband yet. His right hand, a knight called Weasley, was the one who received me and directed me to these rooms. They would put all my belongings in my new area in the castle and I could fix it to my preferences later if I didn’t like what the servants did to my things, but I would only enter the Solar Castle once I was a Potter, too.
When we were all in our places, and Professor Flitwick magically moved the lights so they showed Luna and Zabini in the stage, each of them in opposite sides, I started to speak.
“I haven’t. I wanted to know if it was okay with you before I tried to ask him.” I confessed, and Hermione smiled at me as if I was her 2 year old child.
“Please, Harry, please do. Please fuck me!” Draco begged, trying to get Harry to fuck him, but the man didn’t bulge.
“What are the wandless spells you can do?” Harry ignored the acid tone of Malfoy's voice for general well-being. They were stuck on an island for Merlin knows how long. They needed at least not to kill themselves.
He was also there when Draco started to select people for his team. Strangely, his old colleagues at Slytherin came to him first. Gregory Goyle was the first one to approach, looking at Draco in the eye.
“This is the meeting schedule. I hope you don’t do anything stupid, like trying to get away from it.” She said with a smile, and I just breathed in deeply as I pocketed the piece of old paper.
“Are you sure?” Draco asked, and his stomach grumbled loudly. Harry looked at him, to his small face and pointy features.
The whole ordeal was fast for a royal marriage. Their priest, an old man with a long, white beard and twinkling blue eyes, talked about how the union of an Alpha and an Omega was sacred. Of how the Omega would do everything in their power to serve, love and make their Alpha happy, and how the Alpha would do everything in their power to protect, love and surrender to their Omega, giving their Omega everything they had in order to make their Omega happy –
“I absolutely stink!” The Slytherin screamed, and Harry couldn’t help but laugh, taking Draco’s clothes and entering the bathroom so he could put them in the washing bin. “Hey, why don’t we shower together? It’s late, I bet you want to get rid of your stink too.”
“Magical Theory and Advanced Potions. And you have Advanced Defense Against Dark Arts and Muggle History, which I don’t. But they don’t clash so we can be with each other anyway.” Draco said, putting on his tie while looking in the mirror.
Harry could barely see them with the tears in his eyes, and he didn’t care when they fell, crouching down and caressing her little cheek.
Harry decided, maybe they ought to have some fun. He made them use light clothes, made some cold beverages and brought them some games. It didn’t work, really. So then, they decided summer meant seeing friends and being around people, so they asked Ron, Hermione, Pansy and Millie to play twister with them.
Draco looked completely embarrassed, and he soon took the crown out of his head, getting up quicker than Harry could say
Draco nodded and followed him through a corridor on the left side of the living room. Harry opened the third door, showing him a simple room with a double bed, covered with clean white sheets. Across the bed, he spied a small dresser and a mirror. There was a toasty radiator near the bed, and beside the beige carpet and white curtains, the room was bare.
Way too soon, we had to walk to the stage in front of all the other students and the teachers, and Draco released my hand. All the narration I was going to do between the other basses, so I wasn’t as nervous in the beginning. It was the solo part that terrified me.
Harry didn’t wait for a second invitation. He took off his shoes and jeans, slipping behind Draco under the covers and hugging him from behind, kissing his neck tenderly.
The smaller man soon finished another one, putting on his own head. He moved his head, looking directly at Harry’s eyes.
Before Harry could move, however, a loud cry could be heard coming from the next room, and Harry sighed. Dracy smiled, getting up and going to Talitha. He returned with the girl in his arms, who quickly calmed down when she found a nipple, drinking hard. Dracy sat on his and Harry's bed, leaning against the wall to make himself more comfortable.
Harry watched him for a few seconds, impressed but disappointed that they hadn’t taken the same course. Draco's powers wouldn't help them that much at the moment.
“Oh, Draco, you’re not going there anymore. Not now, not ever. I promise you.” Harry hugged him tightly, caressing his back. Draco cried on his shoulder, and Harry closed his eyes. He didn’t say anything, although his heart was screaming the words in his head.
Looking around was making me highly embarrassed, but Pansy was excessively excited to change to their type of clothing. I hope I didn’t need to. My body was a treasure to my husband and myself only. That’s what I grew up believing.
“Oh fuck, Harry! I’m gonna come, I’m gonna co--!!” Draco came untouched all over Harry’s chest, thick ropes of come landing on his skin. Harry couldn’t hold back anymore, thrusting all the way inside of Draco and coming inside him, his own eyes closing in ecstasy, his moans loud and wanton.
Harry was damn handsome, and he didn’t look like he was gay at all. He didn’t even sound like he was gay. His house gave nothing away. Draco looked at his hands, but he couldn’t see any rings there. Maybe Draco was without any action for way too much time, he wasn’t the type of guy to obsessively wonder if a person was gay or not, but here he was, wishing and hoping that  Harry was gay.
The mediwitch nodded, smiling as she wrapped the baby after cleaning her up, putting her in Draco’s arms. Draco looked down at her, and unwrapped her body, looking at the baby’s naked form. He counted all her fingers and toes, he checked her ears and little nose. He caressed her little mop of dark hair, and between her legs just to be sure.
“You’ve got a small cock?” Draco asked, looking at him. “Really, it’s pretty normal to have a small cock. I have a small cock and I think it’s quite alright.”
“I’m an arse type of bloke. But yeah, I do like cock, and also cunt, and tits. I pretty much like everything.”
Harry was lying on the floor, an entire arm in the hole, and with his hand full of dirt, he stood up. He had made a big pile of dirt on one side, looking at the arrangement of the four holes. During the days when Draco was without energy and in pain, Harry decided to collect the materials to make the cabin. It was a long and tiring process, and his shoulders ached with the effort, but he had knocked over several logs with his stone ax. After a few days of trying, Harry managed to adapt his fire magic to sharpen the ax, making it tough and sharp. He tied it to a firm stick with one of Draco's ropes and went to work.
The whole choir were good with the harmony, and I sneaked a peak to where Malfoy was in the front stage, smiling and dancing as if he was on Broadway or something similar. I couldn’t help the damn smile on my face, and I tried hard to still my mouth and be serious again. I had to remember Malfoy wasn’t a friend, he was the enemy. Yes, I vouched for him on the trials. Yes, he had sent me a meter long letter that basically said ‘I’m sorry and thank you’, and YES, he was probably my mate or whatever bullshit Hermione read on her books – even though she was talking about Amortentia and her relationship with Ron -, but he was still Draco Malfoy and we still hated each other. Right?
“… Did you just tell me you’re a multimillionaire?” Draco asked, frowning even harder, and Harry rolled his eyes.
“Horny,” Harry replied, throwing his shirt somewhere in the room, now taking off his shoes, socks, belt and jeans. “You’re not taking your clothes off.”
“Hello, Harry. Hello, Malfoy,” Hermione greeted them, and Draco looked up, saying a soft ‘hi’ to both of them before putting some fruit salad in a bowl with yoghurt. Harry decided to make himself a sandwich too. “First day of proper schooling. I can’t wait for it! I could barely sleep!”
“You’re my soulmate, Harry. We belong together and destiny brought me here, to you. I know I have a romance writer’s brain, but I have to be here. My flat isn’t my home. But you…” Draco said, and then he also got insecure. “Unless, you have someone…”
“Hm…” Harry cleared his throat before speaking, his cock stirring alive because of the vision in front of him. “I’m… I’m a bit different from the other blokes so I feel…”
“What about something hot? Do you feel cold constantly?” Harry asked, and Draco looked up, trying to remember.
Harry came back to the present when the first Gryffindor student was sorted, and the people around him cheered. He started clapping before he knew what was going on, stretching his neck so he could see the small kid coming to the table. It was the smallest eleven-year-old girl Harry had ever seen. She had brown, fine hair and soft brown eyes, and she was shy when she sat at the table.
“We travelled for months to this hot as hell place. I don’t know how we can survive in our gowns here in Gryffindor, but I assure you, Prince Draco, I didn’t travel this far to fall back on you,” she said, and I smiled. I had yet to meet my… Well,
“It’s incredible. Can you believe we did it all without a wand?” Harry asked, and Draco smiled at him. Draco's hair was reaching almost to his chin, and Harry couldn't resist touching him on the back of the neck, the tips of his fingers entering his hair. He got closer, kissing Draco slowly. Draco hugged him by the shoulders, leaning his entire body against Harry's, standing on his tiptoes so that he could touch him completely.
He put on deodorant and dressed on his black slacks and white shirt. He went back to the bedroom and saw Draco sitting on his bed, sleepy, his hair mussed and his lips pouted.
Harry held him by his hips and started to move, trying not to go too fast or hard because of the sounds, but his body was moving against his better judgement, and soon enough, he was pounding madly into Draco, that had a hand on his mouth, biting hard on his fingers. It was fast and messy, and exciting and delicious. Soon, Draco was coming all over the wall, his eyes turning behind his eyelids, his mouth open, and a thread of saliva running from the side of his lower lip.
They talked and took pictures, and once they were getting ready to take the boys home again, so Draco could relax a little bit before coming back home after being released, Draco looked at Harry, his eyes wide and begging.
When Harry returned to the lake, Dracy was staring deeply at the baby, who was ominously close to the lake, the water covering his body, just her little face out of the water.
It might have taken eons or just a few minutes, but soon Draco was resting against Harry’s shoulder, Harry’s cock still shoved deep inside him.
It didn’t take long for Saturn to fall asleep, and Harry left quietly his room, walking to his own bedroom, where Draco had been sleeping for a while now.
Draco almost howled, pulling on Harry’s hair and coming between them. Harry looked at him, and he felt his orgasm coming without control. Draco must’ve felt him jerking inside of him because he hoarsely moaned:
“You are so fucking tight I might come if I move,” he said, and my cock jerked at how strained his voice sounded. I was stuffed full, his hairy crotch glued to my arse before he started moving out. He moved slowly one, two, three times, giving me time to get used to it, but although it was burning, I needed more.
Once he opened the door, though, Draco opened his eyes. He was still pale and tired looking, and Harry walked towards him, sitting beside him on the bed and quietly kissing his omega’s forehead.
And before he could swim out of the water, he felt a tug that made his whole body spin and all the air out of his lungs. He swallowed water, his lungs burning.
When Ron and Hermione arrived with their boys, they were in their best behaviour. Cygnus and Castor were placed on Draco’s bed. Aries went to Harry’s arms and Scorpius and Sirius stood beside the bed, looking at the small bundle that was the baby in Draco’s arms. Rose and Hugo went to Harry’s side, also curious.
As the moment of delivery approached, Harry became more and more worried. He made a point of always adding some vitamins that came in Roberto's boxes to Dracy's food, so that neither the baby nor he was deficient in anything. Alone, he made preparations to make the pregnancy easier, thinking about what would be the best option for that moment.
you as you are. And what you are, is exactly how you feel. You are a man, and you are a woman, and there is nothing wrong with what you are. You are beautiful, sexy, and every time I see you I feel like my heart grows twice its original size. I love you. And I love you in whatever way you want me to call you.” Harry said, touching Dracy's face. He meant that he also loved that baby in his womb, but he bit his lip. He didn't want to cause an extreme reaction in the middle of a serious conversation.
It didn’t help, though, because Cygnus just started making faces at Scorpius, who couldn’t help but making faces back at him.
“Draco…” Harry whispered, and Draco smiled, opening his mouth and engulfing his cock’s head with his mouth. Harry had to bit his free hand, trying not to moan aloud. He could’ve cast a
Neither could eat much. They prepared the supplies for the trip, and Harry was thankful for being able to use wandless aguamenti, or they would be dead before they left. As long as they had drinkable water, they could survive.
Lily Narcissa Potter was born four months before her big brother turned one year old. She had strawberry blond hair and light green eyes. She was a tiny thing, even for a newborn baby, but she was perfect. They decided she would sleep in the same room as her brother, to make things easier and have James get used to being around his little sister. She was, of course, as loved as her brother by her family, especially by her grandma with whom she shared a name.
“Draco?” Harry asked, just to be sure. He didn’t think she was talking about Lucius Malfoy but it didn’t hurt to ask.
Those words stuck into my brain. I’ve heard it before, of course. The marriage vows weren’t very different from kingdom to kingdom, and a lot of omegas hate the words they had to say. Still, when the phrase went past my lips, it sounded… Different.
Thirty minutes later, having fucked Draco against the wall, they were finally ready to fall into their bed and sleep. With Draco happily dozing with his head on his chest, Harry looked up to the ceiling.
He slicked his cock with the lube on his hand, and lined it with Draco’s hole, pressing into it in one slow motion. Draco tilted his head back, resting it on Harry’s shoulder, his mouth open in a silent moan, eyes closed in pleasure. Harry had to bite his lower lip so he wouldn’t moan when he saw Draco press his teeth together and breath through them, thing he always did when the burn was
I was expecting his enormous cock to fill me, and it was so big, hard and delicious that I could see it even with my submissive position. He stroked himself, looking at my hole as if he had never seen an omega’s arsehole before. Instead of fucking me, though, he held me again by my hips and closed his mouth around my hole, making me scream in pleasure.
Draco was braiding another jute rope while Harry made a fourth hole deep in the floor. His fingers were red, but Draco was no longer so uncomfortable with the braiding. There were calluses on his hands now, and although he didn't like the look of it, he admitted that the diminished sensitivity helped a lot as he made ropes and ropes for their new endeavor. Fortunately, his period was over and he felt much more willing to help Harry build the new house.
“You mean… Like… Raw fucking and… you know, coming inside and all?” Harry raised his eyebrows, surprised green eyes wide behind his spectacles.
The writer sighed, looking around and pressing his car horn again and again. Draco looked around, waiting for someone to help him. He cursed, feeling the chill of the weather seeping through his body even though the heater on his car was working. He really hoped he didn’t have to dig the fucking snow with his bare hands and push the car just so he could leave – and be stopped again only a few meters ahead. The snow was getting deeper and the sky heavier with brooding clouds and falling snow.
Potter chuckled, getting up and nodding. We trained for one hour more, and by the end of it, I knew Potter was trying his best to keep up with me. Still a little awkward, and he still looked too much at my feet or his own feet, but I felt a new wave of respect for the oaf. Especially when he smiled broad and bright because he got a step correctly.
“Nice game, Harry,” Draco said when they landed, and Harry couldn’t stop himself. He was so happy he hugged Draco right there, in front of everybody. Draco hugged him back.
“I’m still fat from this one. Maybe when he’s walking and talking.” Harry’s arms hugged him around his waist, and Harry kissed him on his neck.
“Harry...!” Dracy groaned in a whisper, slowly spreading his legs. Harry ran his hand down his body, holding the small penis between his fingers and beginning to gently masturbate it.
“It… Feels amazing… I feel so full…” Draco mumbled, holding onto Harry’s shoulder. He slowly rocked against Harry’s cock, and both of them moaned with the pleasure of it.
Draco didn’t say anything. He took the pear to his mouth, biting it gently, so different from Harry, and the fruit juice made his lips shiny. Harry had to look away from his lips so he wouldn’t stare.
we’d be singing, Melinda started with the piano. I had to focus on the paper and absolutely not look at Malfoy so I could sing my part.
After they were all clean, and the nest was also clean, Draco lay there with their four puppies, Harry barking and growling at anyone who came near them. A part of his brain became way too protective of his babies, and he only ever allowed Saturn to enter the room, in wolf form too, to smell his baby brothers and sister.
What began as an innocent, delicate kiss was becoming increasingly needy, as if the expectation of what would happen the next day was dimming the reason at that moment. Harry was so lost in that kiss, the taste of Draco's lips and the feel of his soft body against his, that he was almost startled when Draco gripped his wrist, moving Harry’s hand away from him. Harry's hand was going up the other's chest, and Malfoy held it when it was almost where Harry wanted, which were Draco's nipples.
As they sat in the clearing on one of the cotton sheets, eating quietly while Dracy and Harry took turns giving each other small pieces of fruit to Talitha, something unexpected happened.
“And don’t forget that intense sensation, I’m sure it meant what we think it means…” Harry said, excited, and smiled more openly. “Are we really soulmates?”
“But your old house is destroyed. There’s nothing left beside the lot,” Hermione said, frowning, and I nodded.
They decided to travel the next morning, So they were rested and fed before the process that could be their death or salvation.
Having babies was always a plan they both had, but it took Draco a long year of being with Harry to notice he might be good enough to be a father. And weirdly, while he started giving in to Harry’s fantasy because it was the least he could do to his devoted lover, after a couple of months he was looking forward to those moments. Harry would tease his nipples until they were sore, hold his stomach tenderly as if there was a baby there already and fill him with come to the brim – at least, he would if they weren’t using the contraceptive spell.
“We have tried to track their magic, without success. We searched with owls, and we never get anywhere. Not even house elves can track where they are,” Ron said, looking at the Unspeakable Chief, who clicked his tongue
your daughter! Is that what you want? Do you want to murder her?!” Harry shouted, starting to cry too.
Draco stopped, and Harry looked at him. The man had a thoughtful face, and after a minute, Harry couldn’t wait anymore.
I couldn’t help but fidget. Ron and Hermione were sitting beside me on a table at the library, and we were trying to study for the last exams before the holidays. I had two weeks before the Christmas play, and I felt a bit nauseous every time I thought of that. But at that particular moment, it wasn’t what was bugging me.
“It was nice because it was me against you,” Harry said, getting away from Draco. The Slytherin was blushing hard, biting his lips. He turned back to his team and hugged Goyle too, congratulating them on the amazing game.
“Hey, mate, what’s wrong?” He caressed Saturn’s back, and the little boy started crying harder, bending down and kissing his baby brother’s forehead.
I was nervous, so I looked around to calm myself down. The bed was big, with golden trim and red cushions. The room in itself was very practical, with a closet and a decorative sword collection on the wall. I assumed we would have separate bedrooms, so I wasn’t too concerned about the decoration, although I’d change one thing or another – maybe everything – if the bedroom was mine.
“Shh... Shh, it's okay. It's all right. It’s passed. It won't happen again, will it?” Harry asked, stroking the baby's chubby cheek with his index finger.
“I’m fucking sorry, Draco, but this is too hot. I have to take it off,” Harry said, taking his t-shirt off and trying to create some wind around himself with it. His body was covered in sweat, and his body hair was practically glued to his tanned skin. It felt so much better that he stopped for a moment, his body cooling before he noticed Draco looking at him with his mouth open and a vacant stare. “Dray?”
After a while, he took Aries back and put the sleeping baby back into his cradle. Aries immediately looked for his brother, and Harry helped them to get closer together. Maybe, after so long hugging each other in the womb, they still needed that closeness to feel safe.
“No. I want her with me.” Dracy said, and Harry nodded. He didn't know why, but he had a strange feeling in his chest that told him not to sleep.
“I have one tattoo.” Harry said, opening his jeans and pulling it aside with his pants, making Draco blush hard. He didn’t show anything other than his happy trail, but near his hip bone, there was a snake tattoo. “Does it mean anything to you?”
And what made it harder was that I was sitting right beside Malfoy, because I was so attuned to his almost-soprano tone that my voice would go immediately higher to match his. I had to pay much more attention to Maximillian Donahue, the bass Hufflepuff at my side, so my voice was as low as we needed to the song.
“Find the states? Potter, even I know one of them. I can’t access it, of course, I’m a Malfoy, but it’s general knowledge. The Potters are a damn rich family, they had a whole damn hair products business. How much do you know about your family?”
He turned to Lucy as soon as he was finished, and frowned. She had some red berries in her hand, and her eyes had taken on that shadow that had haunted them since discovering the pregnancy.
looking. After that, they would look for more food, Harry would catch some fish and they would wait and wait
During construction, they paused to eat, bathe, rest and have sex. They learned a lot about each other's bodies during the weeks of building the cabin, without worrying about being carried away by the wonderful sensations of being in each other's arms.
“Now, I’ll stay here with you. I have to go back to my flat in the big city so I can get my things… But you won’t get rid of me, Harry Potter. We’re stuck now.”
After the first words, Talitha never stopped. 'Papa' was her next word, and others followed whenever there was a need. Soon she was speaking small phrases, following her parents and pointing.
“Great... Now let's bathe and eat... I'm starving.” Draco said, getting up and heading for the pond. Harry sighed, a smile on his face, following close behind.
“Is everything okay, professor?” Harry asked, walking beside her. It was unnerving, being taller than her now. He still felt like a small little boy under her hard observation.
“I'm sorry... I should have known…” Draco started to speak, and Harry shook his head, holding him under his chin and lifting his face so that Draco looked him in the eye.
Of course, Harry was sad, too. He was. But he didn’t want to show that sadness when Draco was crying on his shoulder out of pure frustration. They kept hugging each other until Draco stopped crying, but didn’t get away from Harry. He had his eyes closed, his breathing even, and Draco’s hand played with Harry’s fingers, circling his wedding band, touching his knuckles and every part of his calloused palm.
“Then fuck me,” Draco replied, and proceeded to take off his shoes and socks. Then, he opened his jeans, moving his hips so he could squeeze out of it. He did the same with his black pants, and stood completely naked in front of Harry, bar the snake hanging from his neck. A drop of precome started to ooze out of his uncut cock, and Draco swallowed hard at the sight.
He kissed her neck, nibbling as he went down to her chest. Quickly, he helped her out of the white tank top, wasting no time before capturing a nipple in his mouth and sucking hard. Lucy moaned softly, not wanting the sailor to hear what they were doing there, probably, but Harry didn't care. Perhaps, if they were in London, he would have been a little more modest, but that island had destroyed whatever remnant of shame he had.
Draco put his bags on the floor near the door, and his laptop case on top of the bed. He then took off his black and long coat, putting it on top of the bed too. He was wearing a black, long sleeved jumper and skinny black jeans, and it somehow made him self-conscious. Harry was big, broad and muscular, with a rock band tee shirt and sturdy jeans and hiking boots. It made Draco feel small, but what weirded him out the most was the fact he wanted to jump on Harry and ask if he could hold him in his arms.
Draco’s labour took a bit longer than the other ones, and Harry didn’t leave his side, feeding him ice chips and whispering sweet nothings on his ear, although Draco was squeezing his hand so hard he thought his fingers would break.
Harry’s hands were all over Draco, and their lips together in a messy kiss, sighs and whispers and smiles between them.
“Let’s try a little more,” Harry suggested, caressing his husband’s arms and kissing his cheeks. “Even if we don’t get pregnant, it will be fun. I’m not in a hurry to have babies. I mean, I’d love one, but I can wait.”
“It’s not the singing part I’m worried about. I have three left feet and I don’t do well with public stuff.” I explained, and Malfoy snorted, crossing his arms in front of his chest. I just ignored the git, looking at Flitwick. “Just… Can’t you choose someone else?”
until nightfall. As they retired to sleep, Malfoy would wait a few minutes for Harry to appear to be sleeping and go out to take his own bath. Harry wanted to follow him once more, to see what he couldn't see the other day, because Malfoy always watched him when they were in the clearing, but something inside him didn’t let him muster the courage to do so. As much as he wanted to, there must be a reason why Malfoy didn't want Harry to see him. Harry was thinking about sixth year. Maybe Malfoy had Sectumsempra scars, and Harry didn't want to see them. At least not at that moment.
“I just put four logs on the ground.” Harry sighed, approaching Draco. He was covered in sand and grass, but Draco rolled his eyes, giving him a peck on the lips.
“Draco… Fuck, Draco… I love you so much,” Harry whispered, and Draco looked up at him, his hands on Harry’s chest, his cheeks red and lips looking thoroughly kissed.
Harry sighed, removing his clothes even with a hard-on. Well, Draco said he didn’t care, didn’t he? Still, he was careful not to be turned to Draco as he removed his clothes, throwing them in the clothes bin too. He took off the elastic band holding his hair and walked to the shower.
He was angry with himself for letting Draco talk him into it. He knew he was a freak and he didn’t need his friendship to be ruined because of his absurdly big cock. He dressed in his sleep clothes and sat on his bed, pulling his curtains closed and trying to sleep before Draco finished his shower.
“I want to suck you off. You have the hottest body I’ve ever seen… And fuck, you have a monster cock. I want it all shoved inside me.”
It was late when Harry remembered that they had to eat. Outside was still cold, the snow even higher, and they had warm tea and cheese toasties with a side of reheated tomato soup.
When they returned to the cabin, they decided to open the boxes that were left by Roberto. Harry felt guilty for not feeling remorse while opening those three boxes, but he knew it was a feeling that couldn’t last. After all, Roberto was dead by his own hands and there wasn't much that he or Lucy could do that they hadn't already done.
“Charlie and Lola it is,” Harry picked the book and sat at Saturn’s side. Before he could start reading, though, Saturn held his hand, looking up to him.
“I know you do, you kinky bastard. But let’s enjoy ourselves with our imagination for a while. If it was up to you, you’d have me pregnant my entire life.”
“I need you to be a good big brother and watch over your little brothers, Sirius. Can you do that for me?” Harry asked, hugging his older son. Sirius nodded, his light grey eyes serious.
When Talitha took her first steps, she held Harry's fingers while Dracy called out a little further. The girl was strong, her curly black hair waving in the wind, her green eyes intense and a smile on her lips. Dracy and Harry felt their whole body vibrate when they saw her walking for the first time, and Dracy couldn't control the tears that were streaming down his face.
After that, it went almost violently. Draco could just feel, the pleasure just getting bigger and bigger inside him as Harry fucked his brains out. He felt when both of Harry’s hands grabbed him by his hips and fucked him with all his might. Draco held on the pillows and let the pleasure take over him, his whole body tingling with the intense sensation.
is a more appropriate name,” they both smiled at that, and Harry waited for the rest of the answer. “Then... I don't care if you call me him or her, but I want you to treat me like a man and woman at random.”
“I’m yours, Harry! Only yours…! Please, mark me… Come inside me, make me yours!” Draco was about to see stars. Harry’s cock was pressing his prostate, and a puddle of precome was already forming underneath Draco. He just needed a little push…
Hello, lovelies! I hope you had an amazing New Year. Here's another chapter. Thank you for all the support, you are incredible people.
person.” Dracy shook his head, sighing and hugging his own body. “Besides, I like the feeling of being recognised as both. That's what I am, Harry.”
Saturn looked down at his brother, their black hair matching, and he sniffled. It took Harry a few seconds to notice Saturn was crying.
The room was full of people, who threw rose petals at me as soon as I stepped on the red carpet who would lead me to my new husband.
“And I’m not a jerk,” Harry replied. McGonagall nodded and left them alone, closing the door behind her as she left.
“Harry... Everything hurts…” Dracy said, and Harry didn't waste any more time. He put an arm under Dracy's legs and one behind his back, lifting him out of the water so they could go towards the cabin.
Having a soulmate was something everybody expected one day in their lives. Many people were happy to find someone they loved and be happy with them. Some people crossed the world trying to find their soulmates. Some people, like them… Just found it.
“You’d like him to come with us. It makes sense.” Hermione said, nodding her head. “Have you asked him already?”
When the moon was high, illuminating the entire clearing in white, the pain was unbearable. Dracy was on the floor, sitting on the grass, moaning and crying with horrible pain, and Harry didn't know what to do but hold his hand and tell him to trust his body. To do what it wanted and to not think with his head. His body would do it naturally.
After putting Draco to bed and making some sandwiches for him to eat under a preservation spell – Draco’s pantry was sadly empty, and Harry hated how little his friend ate these days -, Harry came back to the Ministry and emptied Draco’s office, transferring his things to his own office. Draco would be mad because things weren’t alphabetically organised and colour coded, but at least they wouldn’t be destroyed by the weather.
I literally couldn’t move, and my brain was screaming at me that it was my turn, I had to go up there and sing! My blood seemingly stopped flowing, and I felt lightheaded. I was going to faint, and everybody in the damn school was looking at me.
“I’m going to fuck you until you’re pregnant. I’m going to fuck a baby into you, you fucking southern slut, I’m going to fucking mark you with my spunk so you smell like me forever,” Harry growled, and it shouldn’t be so hot, but it was, and I screamed as I came again, clamping around his cock.
“It’s just an apple, Dray. Calm down,” he said, swallowing it and taking another bite. “It’s really good. I can’t feel any bad magic in it.”
“I know, Harry. That’s why I assigned you to be part of the school choir. They’re in need of a bass singer and you—”
After that moment, the days seemed easier, even though Dracy's relationship with his pregnancy continued to be one of distance. As his belly grew, more effort was made by Dracy to ignore it, and whenever they had sex, Dracy stood on his side, in a position where, while not having to make a lot of effort, he also didn’t need to actively look at his belly.
I was being low profile this year, trying not to be noticed and trying not to get in trouble. If I wanted a job after Hogwarts, I needed E’s in almost everything to manage any kind of job, even as a salesperson. I couldn’t go back to the Manor, my parents were in France and I was basically alone and moneyless after I left Hogwarts. So I breathed in, held the need to punch Potter in the face, and focused on the rehearsal.
If there was one thing that Harry knew was most damaging to someone's mind, it was leaving it empty. The thoughts came like a storm, destroying their willpower and joy.
Harry didn't know what to do. He felt useless and helpless. His only function in that place was to provide Draco with a happy life, and he had been failing that for days. What he could do was encourage Draco to continue looking after his garden, which the blond did slowly and unwillingly, feeding him most of the food to make him healthy, giving him simple tasks like washing oysters and collecting fruits and branches, so that Draco wouldn’t be alone and think nonsense.
“You would kill her... Since when are you planning to kill the baby?! Is that why you didn't want to talk about pregnancy?” Harry asked desperately, and Dracy continued to shake his head.
“I… I know you don’t believe in me, and I’m not even sure why I’m telling you this, but… I hate being the centre of attention. It just… I hate being there, in the spot light. When Max was singing, I was completely happy to do my part. I was actually enjoying being in the choir. It’s different from everything I’ve ever experienced so far. I get to participate in something but I wasn’t the main show, you know? It’s not like Quidditch. I love being seeker but I hate that all eyes are on me. It was easier, though. From up high, you can’t really see who’s looking at you or not. But at the stage…”
The blonde groaned, clenching his teeth in the little pain when he felt the mouth suck his milk for the first time, but soon tears were streaming down his eyes.
Harry wanted to collapse on Lucy's body, but resisted, not wanting to hurt her belly. He got out of her, lying down beside her and pulling her into his arms.
“Draco, can you come here?” Harry asked after Draco put on his pyjama shirt, and Draco nodded, jumping on their bed and making it bounce. Harry laughed, hugging his husband and kissing his smiling lips.
Draco did, his eyes so full of tears that they’d be falling any moment.  “What are you seeing? Look at me and tell me what you’re seeing.”
Draco nodded, and Harry crooked his head a bit to look at his face. Draco had his eyes closed, his mouth in a pout as he was breathing softly.
The days followed in a stable routine. In the morning, they woke up, ate and went to the clearing to continue building the cabin. It was a slow process, which depended a lot on their patience and strength. While working, Harry was solely responsible for building the cabin and treating the fish before it was cooked. Draco was responsible for finding fruits and roots, as well as catching fish from puddles on the beach corals. Every day they wrote down the current day on the calendar stone, trying their best not to get lost. It was one of the first things they did in the morning, almost ritualistically.
“No. And you and I are going to have a talk after this. I know you did it on purpose,” Harry said, lowly and threatening, making Sirius shut his mouth and scurry over to the settee, sitting on his designated place.
“And this is your opportunity, Harry. It’s your turn to name one of our babies,” Draco said, laughing, and Harry laughed back. Although Draco had thought of him when he named their first baby, Draco was the one who’d name the boys and Harry, the girls.
“I know it would be strange for the Muggle to know that you are a man, and I will definitely use the name you chose…”
It was the best orgasm in my life. Or I thought it was, because merely seconds in my pleasure high moment, he bit hard onto my neck, piercing through my skin, and knotting my tight arsehole to its absolutely limits.
He sucked on my slick, licking around my passage and pressing his tongue inside, fucking me with the wet muscle. I couldn’t control myself and my whole body shuddered as I came, hard, my hole clamping around his tongue, my come wetting his bed. He didn’t stop fucking me with his tongue, and even put his hands down so he could pinch my nipples and pull at them as he tongue-fucked me.
“Our anniversary is tomorrow. Thank you for finding me in the snow, Harry,” Draco said, and Harry kissed his lips softly.
Lucy grabbed him by the hair, and Harry felt her come, her cunt twitching around his fingers, the lubricating liquid dripping from her entrance. She didn’t come from her cock, which Harry didn’t think was strange since, although he didn’t realise it the first few times, as the months went by and the number of times they had fucked, Harry noticed that Dr-
Eventually, Talitha went back to sleep, and naturally released Dracy’s nipple, her small mouth open in an ‘o’ shape. Dracy got up, taking the little girl to the next room, before going back to the couple's room. Harry was still sitting against the wooden wall, and Dracy sat straddling his lap, holding him by the shoulders.
That day when he saw Draco smile, however, it was when he had a spark of hope that eventually things would be okay. The night before, they had forgotten a papaya near the fire. When they woke up in the morning, there was a mother monkey with her baby eating the papaya. Her baby was clinging to her neck while she ate and eventually raised a hand with a piece of fruit to stick in the little monkey's mouth.
Malfoy snapped his tongue, running his hands through his incredibly straight and silky hair, even though he hadn't shampooed in a week.
my husband in me, I wasn’t nervous about the marriage at all. It was all political, and I knew I’d be treated like a true preciosity. If anything, Gryffindors were known for their honourable hearts, and the King saved so many people, even at only 25 years old. I wasn’t worried about that at all.
Living in a blurry world had already become customary, and he needed to hunt to support his family in any way, which may have made his vision improve a little. He still needed Dracy's help to catch fish faster, but it was true that he managed to do much better.
Harry licked his lips, taking off his own tee and coming closer to Draco, touching his forearms and then going up to his shoulders, making goose bumps roll down Draco’s spine. Harry touched both his shoulders and went down his chest, rolling Draco’s nipples with his thumbs.
one.” I said, and then I frowned, my mind side-tracking a little. “What about the Potter states. I’m sure you own them now? I mean, you’re eighteen, right?”
“Thanks… For yesterday.” Draco said, and Harry smiled, getting up and walking until they were close.
Harry moaned loudly, holding tight to the sides of his bed. He closed his eyes, his toes curling. He noticed when Draco was quiet and shy during the day, he was very talkative while naked and sucking his cock. Draco didn’t stop praising his body, kissing him, sucking his cock almost whole, before licking it from balls to tip, and trying to shove it down his throat once again.
“Now that we’re settled,” Hermione interrupted our friendly bickering. “Harry will talk to Malfoy later and
He left there after kissing Draco’s thighs, his tongue being replaced by two fingers. Harry stretched his rim slowly, looking into Draco’s eyes.
Harry already knew the way to the Professor’s quarters, from when he was searching for Peter Pettigrew in his third year. Thinking about Lupin made his heart clench a little, but he pushed the memory to the back of his head. He mourned a lot before coming to school, and it was now time to move on.
The hours were long and Harry felt useless, but he couldn’t hold himself together when he saw his first puppy come into the world. He was white with black ears and paws, and Draco didn’t waste any time before licking him clean. Then another followed, exactly like his first brother. Hours later, they had their four puppies out, the last ones smaller than the two that were born first. The third one had black fur with a white long spot on their back, and the last one was entirely white. He had three little boys and one girl, who were now feasting on Draco’s nipples as the white wolf panted after hours of work, pushing babies and placentas out of him.
Slowly, they undressed, and Harry kissed every inch of Draco’s body, worshipping him as he deserved. When he entered Draco’s body, it was different from the other times. It was equally as good, of course, but it was lighter as if a weight was taken off his shoulders. He kissed Draco as he made love to him, moving in and out of his wet heat, hugging his lover against himself, their bodies so close to each other they couldn’t move fast.
to get pregnant. He even self-slicked. So Harry’s eyes shone bright that day, and Draco got so well fucked that night he was slightly scared he was
“Fuck me, Harry. Knock me up.” Draco begged again, and Harry growled, positioning himself behind Draco, his hard cock sliding between Draco’s cheeks, his slick helping it. Draco braced himself, waiting for the sting of the penetration…
“Yes, show us, show us!” Hermione cheered, grabbing a small camera and taking pictures of them, because they just couldn’t help taking pictures of everything.
“Let me decide who’s worthy of my friendship or not, will you? I’m the one who was under his wand once, and I forgave him. He’s done nothing to you. Can’t you be less of a prick and think before acting?” Harry asked again, now pulling Draco under his arm and holding him by his shoulders. “Don’t bother us again. And tell your friends not to bother us again, either.”
“I’m Draco Malfoy, and I’m a self-published writer. Not multimillionaire, but, you know, I make decent money. My family comes from money, though. My mother and my father, I mean. I don’t have a big family.”
Draco rested his head on the car’s direction, cursing himself once again. He should’ve waited, but no… He was a stupid city boy wanting to come back to his computer games and his books. He didn’t know how long he was there, throwing a pity party, but the sound of someone knocking on his window made him raise his head.
“Your things have been moved here now. I’ll leave you both to yourselves. You are two adults now and I’m sure you will act like adults when together, right?” The professor said, and both Harry and Malfoy nodded.
On the second day, with a plaster on his cheek, Draco tried to spell it away with every single spell he knew. Harry tried to cut it out by force, and after a few tried, he too had a cut on his face.
“We need to do night shifts. We can't both sleep at the same time,” Harry said, and Draco agreed. They planned all the details of the overnight trip around the fire as they ate what they expected to be their penultimate meal on that island.
As Draco hugged Harry by his shoulders, the towels, soap and toothpaste falling to the floor, Harry hugged him by his waist, leaning deeper into that kiss.
“I think they’re not able to find us,” Harry stated after a week. They had found a large stone where they marked the first letter of the month of March, which was when they disappeared, and the days that had passed. According to the calculations, they were already on March 18, and had been transported by portkey on the 11th.
Being a bass was hard, as I figured after the first day. I didn’t know much about voice range before being assigned as a bass singer, but with the four meetings the choir had since I’ve been in it, I understood a little bit better now. The basses were the lowest male range, the contralti were the lowest female range. The tenors were the highest male range and the sopranos were the highest female range. Some people were in the middle. Dean sang as tenor, but he told me he was a baritone: a male who could reach bass and tenor range. The same as Pansy Parkinson. She sang as a contralto, but I heard her explaining she was a mezzo-soprano, which meant she was right there in the middle, like Dean. I liked being a bass. Our voices barely showed when the tenors and sopranos were singing, but we and the contralti were the ones that held the piece together. If a bass voice was missing, suddenly a massive hole was in the song even though we couldn’t even hear the basses in the first place. It felt good to be part of something, and yet, not being in the spotlight. The tenors and sopranos were the ones starring the show, and I was completely happy not being up the front for the first time in my life.
After that night, something shifted between them. Harry didn’t know if it was him, or Draco, but they sat a bit too close, their hands lingered a bit too long, and they looked at each other for a bit more time. Sometimes, Draco would blush while looking at him, and Harry could no longer help getting hard at the sight of Draco naked in the mornings and at night. He couldn’t stop masturbating early in the mornings when Draco was asleep, and his head was full of images of Draco. Draco’s eyes looking up at him while kneeling between his legs and Harry’s cock between his lips. Harry would try to ignore the fact that his cock was way too big for Draco’s mouth, but Draco would still try to suck him off. That thought always pushed Harry over the edge.
As they looked for a child, they prepared a nursery, painting the walls white, as all the furniture, with coloured blankets and pillows and toys, to create a beautiful contrast. Draco was happy even though he was sad for a whole year of frustration, and they even put a bed in the nursery just in case they got an older kid.
I was a bit out of everything, but I smiled when he kissed my hair, raising his hand and slowly caressing my nipples as he waited his knot to subside. It was careful and tender and even though it made me hot again, it was also very soothing.
“It looks safe.” Draco said, snapping his fingers. A clock appeared beside him, indicating that it was after eleven. “Want to take a break? You spent the whole morning on this.”
Later that day, Harry came back to his and Draco’s dorm. It was weird, not bedding down alongside his mates, but ever since Ron and Hermione had started dating, Harry had begun to get used to it. He said the password at the door, opening it and getting inside. The fireplace lit the place and kept it warm, and Harry breathed in slowly, trying to acclimatise and feel more comfortable in the place he would spend the next school year.
They left the alcove, and Harry stumbled against Draco’s back because he abruptly stopped. When he looked around Draco, Ginny was taking one hand from under Pansy’s skirt, and the Slytherin girl was limp against the wall, the whole corridor dark and empty, except for a few torches and the four of them. Ginny raised the hand to her mouth, putting two fingers inside it and sucking, before stating.
In the second week of October, McGonagall announced that Quidditch was coming back. New teams would be formed and the head of their houses would choose their leaders. Harry shouldn’t have been surprised when the new head of Gryffindor, Professor Vector, the Arithmancy teacher, chose him as the Quidditch team leader. Harry had sort of hoped they would choose someone else, but it didn't matter. He had a strong plan. Call his old team back, and do testing for the positions that needed players. Luckily, everyone was there and eager to play again. Ron, Ginny, Jimmy Peakes, Ritchie Coot, Dean Thomas and Demelza Robins.
“I really can’t do anything else? Cleaning old stuff with Filch, perhaps?” I tried, and Professor McGonagall sighed, giving me a piece of parchment.
“Your cock is huge,” Draco replied, and Harry chuckled, but didn’t say anything. He opened his mouth, sucking Draco’s cock almost all the way, making Draco howl in pleasure. Harry’s mouth was hot and wet, and he started to bob his head up and down, sucking on Draco’s cock as if he was a lolly. Harry moved one of his hands up, tweaking his nipple, and with the other, he pressed between Draco’s arse cheeks, that were wet with his own slick. Harry pressed one finger inside, moving it with the rhythm of his mouth, and then two, curving them up as he fucked them into Draco’s hole.
“Why do you think that?” Harry asked, gently holding onto Draco’s shoulder so they would start walking to the curse-breaker’s office. Draco went with him, his eyes shining with knowledge and excitement.
Harry left the house after talking to every boy, telling them they’d go to the hospital so they could take their little sibling from their papa’s belly, and then, they’d be back.
Draco hugged him tightly, breathing in the scent of Harry and the sea, feeling the comfort of his lover's strong arms and relaxing. There was still a lot to think about, but at that moment, they were calmer.
Slowly, a small toy Snitch started to fly in front of them, and Cygnus perched up immediately, jumping off from Harry’s lap and trying to catch it. Aries followed, and soon, all five boys were trying to get the Snitch - even little Castor, barely walking, was making grabby hands at the flying object.
Saturn bent down and kissed his little brother’s forehead, caressing his soft black hair ever so gently. Harry felt his eyes water, too, and carefully hugged them both, kissing his big boy’s head. He was so proud of his son, so proud of how he was becoming his own person, but always so caring and gentle. He’d be an amazing leader once he was old enough and Harry was ready to retire.
“Well, until now,” Draco mumbled, and Harry reached a hand across the island, caressing Draco’s hand with his thumb.
I supported myself on my chest and knees, showing my slick hole to him. I put my hands back and held my arsecheeks, opening myself up. I could feel my omega-hole opening and closing, while slick ran down over my perineum, my small balls and cock.
“Thanks for being so understanding, Harry. I don't think my family would be like you... And they know of my condition.”
Draco knew he should’ve waited at least for the weather to clear out before trying to come back home from his aunt’s countryside house. He was eager to come back home, though, to the comfort of his city flat and WiFi connection. He was 26, self-employed, writing and publishing eBooks at his own pace, and with the rate of his writing and the amount of books he had published already, he was doing well for himself, earning a nice amount of money. He had decided to give himself some holidays, to be a few days away from the chaotic city rhythm, but three days was quite enough.
“Autumn. The tree is destroying that side of the office.” Draco pointed but didn’t take his face out of Harry’s red uniform coat.
Draco had his head back, hands holding Harry’s shoulder hard, his voice hoarse from moaning and screaming.
“But, anyways, I was in the process of making beef stew. Want to talk in the kitchen?” Harry asked, and Draco just nodded.
He stopped, going up, drying his mouth and chin with the back of his hand. He pressed his body against Draco’s, his cock snuggling almost perfectly against Draco’s round arse.
Harry was shocked. For a moment, his mouth didn’t move and his eyes were wide open. As if thinking he made a wrong decision, Draco started to back out, but Harry threw his tee away and grabbed him by his waist, kissing him back with lips, tongue and teeth. Draco moaned into his mouth, melting in his arms and giving back as good as he received, pushing Harry back until he was against the wall.
He was half-sitting, half-lying on the settee with baby Scorpius sleeping on his chest after his afternoon feed. He was the only blond child he had, with his fair skin and light grey eyes. Both Leo and Ursa were dark haired, and they looked so much like Harry it made Draco’s heart melt with how much love he felt for his babies.
“Push! I need to push — Aaah!” Dracy shouted, holding her legs and pushing with all her strength, until the contraction was over.
Harry had no way of answering to that. It was true, they condemned a new life to the inhospitable destiny they had when they fell on that island. Harry lay down beside Draco, and the smaller one soon laid his head on his strong chest, closing his tired eyes.
Surprisingly, Draco just smiled. It was crazy, but he was thankful Harry had found him. He’d probably be freezing his arse outside trying to push his car by now if he hadn’t.
“I can’t take it anymore. My whole body hurts,” Malfoy complained, throwing his right forearm over his eyes. Harry noticed that his lips were dry and brittle.
This… Until the king before my father tried to overthrow the North-eastern king, James Potter. He managed to kill the King and Queen, but didn’t realise their son, Prince Harry, although a child at the time, would manage to kill him in his sleep. As soon as he was old enough, King Harry, Alpha of the Gryffindor Kingdom, managed to take every little piece of land controlled by Riddle. When it came to us, though, my Father, current Alpha King of the Slytherin kingdom, made an agreement with the Gryffindor King. He wouldn’t strip my father of his crown and, in exchange… He’d have
He’d never be able to pack his things again and come back to his cold city flat. He’d rather be here in Harry’s countryside house forever and ever as long as Harry kept kissing him like that.
“You don’t know what a hammock is?” Lucy shook her head, and Harry sighed. He took the hammock, white with red details, and went to their hut. It was high enough off the floor that Harry could stand under it. He took two branches strong enough to withstand the weight of both of them and attached the net with the branches between the parts of the wood under the hut. Without the branches, the hammock wouldn’t be secure, but the spare wood stuck between two beams prevented the hammock from moving.
“I’m going to suck on your titties until I can make milk drool from your nipples,” he growled on my ear, and my eyes rolled back with pleasure. It was impossible, I wasn’t even pregnant –
“We're wasting time, Auror Weasley. If at the end of this week we cannot find them, the case will be closed.”
Harry observed Draco’s face, his pink nose and lips, grey eyes, silver-blond hair with multi-coloured flowers on it. He looked like a Tolkien elf, and Harry felt his heart skip a beat.
Tired and sweating under his robes, Harry put the toy in his pocket, although Sirius reached to get it.
“She is not limited by our expectations or limitations. This place... It's all she knows. The sun... The sea, our lagoon. She doesn't know what bricks are, she doesn't know what a wand is,” Harry touched Talitha's black eyebrows, went down her chubby cheek and to her shoulder. Around Tali's neck was a necklace made of jute with a blue shell hanging from it. “Talitha is what we would be if we weren't limited.”
I don’t know why, but his easy acceptance of me was too much to handle. I held a tough façade, but deep inside, I never felt worthy of forgiveness. I didn’t think I deserved to be forgiven for letting those people into Hogwarts.
“Don’t worry. Get the coconuts. There are no caterpillars in them,” Harry indicated the pile of coconuts, and Draco grudgingly approached him, scanning every inch of the floor.
Around this time, Harry realised that his eyesight was not so bad, something he hadn't stopped to notice in a long time.
That vision was enough to push Harry over the edge, and he came inside Draco, filling him with hot come, pressing his crotch against his arse hard enough that his knuckles turned white. When the post-sex fatigue got to them, Harry rested his head on Draco’s shoulder, and slowly slipped out of him.
“Fuck… Draco… Dra-… Fuck! If you keep doing that, I’m going to come,” Harry warned, and Draco smiled, stopping. He cleaned his wet mouth and chin with the back of his hand, biting his lip and raising his hand, summoning his wand.
Ron and Hermione were in front of him, sitting side by side. It felt normal, eating in the Great Hall with his two best friends. They were talking about how they would have more privileges as they were now adults – like the ending of curfew and a free pass to Hogsmeade. Harry was about to grab a plate of dessert when a flying paper bird stopped at his front. He grabbed it, looking around and stopping when he saw McGonagall. She was subtly gesturing for him to open it.
They stayed there for a while, until Draco fell asleep. Harry got up, leaving him alone for a moment, and went back to the fire to finish their lunch.
From then on, the months passed without much trouble. Sometime at the beginning of the sixth month, Lucy came close to Harry in the hammock, sitting down next to him.
“Yes, I think I have a few ideas. All of the things I tried yesterday were in vain, but I think that the spell is related to me, somehow. Like… Of course, it is related to me, because I cast it, but… I meant emotionally.”
all big and muscled and tanned and hairy. I knew that because people in this region used very little clothing. It was very normal for both men, women, omegas and alphas to use trousers, here. Very tight ones, made from some flexible and sturdy fabric. Women often wore clothing with deep cleavages and short sleeves, and men – even omegas! – would chose to go shirtless or with short-sleeved shirts. Male omegas would use some sort of top, very tight on their bodies, if they chose to go shirtless. At least it looked like they were decent enough not to show their breasts, as small as an omega’s breast was.
“So, I have news and you might not like what I'm about to say,” he started, and Ron and Hermione detangled from each other, looking at Harry. Ginny also raised her eyebrows, curious.
It was warm and magical to acknowledge that Draco was my mate. We haven’t done anything other than what we already did before, talking and training together, but there was more now, and I knew he felt it too. The sensation of knowing there was someone close to you that was meant to be there, who would make you feel safe, mostly emotionally safe. I instinctively felt that with Draco, but I thought that it was mostly because he didn’t look at me like I was larger than life. I was just the guy he hated most of his life and, now, the mate he liked to tease and make jokes with.
“Really, Potter? I thought you knew better than mingling with Death Eaters,” the boy asked, and Harry thought his name was Eaton, from 7th year.
The first born was named Leo. He was a red, strong baby with a mop of black hair on his head. At his side, was Aries, his identical twin. They looked exactly the same, except for the “L” under Leo’s foot and “A” under Aries foot. All four of them were using white, snuggly and comfortable onesies, so it was hard to tell these two apart. The third baby was their little girl, Ursa. She had the same black hair as her older brothers, except she had a birth mark on her hair, a white circle of hair on her hairline. And the last, and tiniest bit of wolf, was Scorpius. He was so tiny he fit on Harry’s right hand, his legs dangling on the sides. His hair was so fine and blond it looked like he had no hair at all. Harry wanted to protect them at all costs, and his heart roared in pride as he looked at his quadruplets. He felt that with Saturn, too, but at the time of Saturn’s birth, he was shocked because he wasn’t in a relationship with Luna, but he was in love with Draco, who lived with him but still Harry felt incredibly alone, and lost, rolling around the universe of not knowing who he was and neither getting what he wanted.
“I see you’re already here,” a husky, deep voice sounded behind me, and I turned, looking at my new alpha. He was stripped of his armour, using only a white, soft shirt, black trousers and boots.
to eat. Maybe the four kinds of weather are trying to show you something, Dray. Maybe you were so focused on your job that your magic is trying to tell you you need to calm down. Like eating.”
“Okay, you like the git. Why am I not surprised?” Ron said out loud, and Hermione nodded in agreement.
Harry turned to Draco, lying on his side and looking at the other, though he didn't see much in the darkness. Draco turned to face him, and their breaths were heavy.
It was when the photographer started to place his equipment in the living room that Harry noticed the first trap. Right on top of the chandelier was a bucket. The bucket was being held precariously by a thread, almost invisible, that went up the chandelier, along the roof and was held on the side light right beside where Sirius was seated. He only needed to release it from the light and the bucket would fall right on top of the poor photographer.
“Don’t pressure him, ‘Mione,” Harry said, and overall, Christmas’ dinner with the Gryffindors wasn’t so bad. They laughed at my jokes and I even laughed at Weasley’s jokes too, surprisingly enough.
“It took you only four bloody seasons to tell me it?” Draco asked, and Harry smiled, kissing him against just because he couldn’t help himself.
“Are you?” Draco asked instead of answering, and Harry sighed. His hand was within millimeters of Draco's, and he felt an urge to hold it.
“He’s not a Death Eater. And I thought you knew better than to question me. After all, you’re studying here this year because of me, aren’t you?” Harry raised his eyebrows and Eaton backed off, shaking his head.
Harry put on his Gryffindor tie, socks and shoes, and tried to somewhat comb his hair. He didn’t like the look of it combed, so he messed it up with his fingers and pushed it to one side. It fell in unruly curls to his chin and Harry smiled, feeling kind of sexy like that. He put on his glasses and his Hogwarts robes and sat on his bed, waiting for Draco.
