"Professor?" He asked, setting the brush down again. The man sighed. He folded his hands in resignation.
Draco settled at the sight of the other two lost in their own projects. He returned to his book. The little common room was quiet until a soft pop made Draco jump. Two metal tins clanged onto the side table beside Harry. A tray popped into the room seconds later with three steaming mugs of cocoa. The blond clutched his book to his chest, gripping hard enough to turn his knuckles white,
“Harry you’ve got to hide me from Blaise,” he wheezed out, “I may or may not have hidden his potions essay and lost it. He’s going to kill me.” As Draco spoke, the green and silver colors flooded out of his robes. Harry stared at his boyfriend, sporting Gryffindor crimson and gold. He laughed and tugged Draco through the doorway just in time to see Blaise coming around the corner.
“Knock it off, Potter. It’s too early for this.” Harry froze. He whirled around from the wall with his eyes wild. The boy’s fists were curled at his side, nails digging into his palm.
He gently turned the blanket back, reaching down for the brunet's wrist. The one he'd been protecting and curled around when Draco found him in the hallway. Bringing it into the light, he felt his stomach turn at the sight of a set of raw cuts across the back of the other boy's hand. In Potter's messy scrawl the message
The pair moved quickly enough that Harry lost his balance, pitching them both forward to the thick rug beneath them. In a tangle of limbs, Harry let out a throaty chuckle. Rolling over, he turned his face to Draco. His blond hair ruffled from the fall and a pout on his lips.
“It’s not mine. Ask Luna.” But Luna was already out of the room, on her way to the great hall. The two boys trailed behind her. No matter how many times Draco batted it away, the snitch kept following. He tried to ignore it.
“She said it’s charmed, but I don’t know how to make it stop.” On cue, the snitch dive-bombed them again. Harry reached for it, but it was Draco who caught it. He overturned a serving tray cover over the top of it. The metal rattled on the tabletop. Luna frowned. She snatched the cover up to release the snitch. In a blur of wings, the snitch darted back to the candles on the ceiling.
After his very public kiss with Draco Malfoy on the dance floor in front of all their peers, Harry had bolted like a jackrabbit out of the 8th Year common room and into an abandoned classroom. He hadn’t noticed if anyone had followed him, but he prayed that no one had. He wanted to be alone. He wished he had his invisibility cloak with him. He was desperate just to disappear and not having to face anyone ever again.
They’d gone through with meeting a young expectant mother who was a muggle-born. They had the nursery up and ready to go. Everything had been put into place. It wasn’t until the baby had been born, that things changed. The mother had had a change of heart and decided to keep her baby. They’d both understood the mother’s decision not to go through with the adoption, but understanding didn’t take the pain away. The incident had caused Harry to go into a downward spiral. He’d been looking forward to finally expanding his family and becoming a father.
Harry could feel himself becoming aroused as Draco continued to press innocently into him.
“Do you want to maybe grab breakfast? I was going to make french toast and grilled peaches for myself. Did you want to come over?” requested Harry. He knew it was a long shot in asking Draco to come over to his house, his home, let alone for breakfast. But he didn’t want to spend the day alone and thought it might be fun to get to know the blond better.
The place wasn’t as packed as it had been beforehand. It was just past the lunch rush. There were only a few tables taken up this time around. Harry stood nervously in the entranceway, scratching at the back of his neck as his eyes swept over the cafe, looking for the familiar shock of white-blonde hair.
“Do you want to come in?” asked Harry awkwardly looking up at his front door and back towards Draco. “For a drink or something?”
“Err. Hi there,”  Harry said back. He felt suddenly very out of place as the hostess continued to look down at him with a stern look. “I was wondering if you could help me. I think I’m in the wrong place.”
“I woke her up...I couldn’t get up.”
Hermione gave Harry a look before gesturing with her hands for him to move out of the way. She was going to be coming through no matter what. She wasn’t going to leave him like this.
The doorbell rang before Harry was out of bed and making his way down the stairs.
“As cozy as that sounds. I really can’t. Not all of us are a man of leisure as yourself is. I have work to get to.”
“You are, Harry,” insisted Luna, her face taking on a serious matter.
Harry tried to show Draco that he couldn't get out of bed. That the reason for not getting out wasn't because he didn’t care. Because he fucking did. Deeply. It just felt like he was moving the entire sun to simply climb out of bed and walk.
still running late?!” asked Pansy.
The episodes had started after the war.
It was just past midnight as Harry woke to the sound of music coming from downstairs.
It wasn’t until Solomon Burke’s Don’t Give Up On Me began to play that Draco pulled Harry’s body closer to his. Harry brought his head down and nuzzled at Draco’s neck, breathing in the lingering scent of his cologne on his skin.
“I love you,” whispered Harry softly. He didn’t know if it was too soon in their relationship to be saying this. He’d never been good in the past at judging when an appropriate time was. He always either said it too soon or too late. But Harry had needed to get it off of his chest. He’d been feeling deeply about Draco for some time now, and he couldn’t wait any longer.
“HARRY! YOU BETTER BE ON YOUR FUCKING DEATH BED!” echoed Draco’s voice from downstairs.
It was Friday night.
“Promise!”
Harry, if he was honest, didn't feel like eating. His confession had left him feeling rubbed raw and vulnerable. He was resisting old habits of retreating inwards on himself. He was fighting all his urges in order to keep himself from making some excuse and going home to bed. He needed this lunch with Draco. This was the normal social interaction he craved and dreamed about having. He couldn't shy away from Draco just yet.
“Mhm!” huffed Hermione in disaprovement. “I really wish you would let me and Ron come over when you feel like that.” She knew that the last thing that Harry wanted was for her and Ron to be around, hovering over him when he was in a bad place. But, she was always afraid that one of these days that Harry would sink so low into himself that he wouldn’t be able to get out. He’d never done anything in the past to make her worry about it. However, she’d read enough to know it was a possibility that Harry might decide he’d had enough of living.
Things seemed to move quickly after that. Their pants were off in what seemed like a matter of seconds. Harry’s boxers were damp already with sweat and a little bit of precum. They clung to his body. Harry openly explored Draco’s body, not shying away from his desire. Draco, to Harry’s mild surprise, wasn’t wearing briefs or boxers like the man he’d dated previously. Draco was wearing a pair of black sheer bikini-cut underwear, that Harry was more accustomed to one of his female partners wearing. Harry couldn’t help but lick his lips as he took in the splendid view of Draco’s cock straining at the fine fabric.
It wasn’t that he hadn’t seen Draco like this before. This loose, silly, and free Draco. Harry had seen this side of his boyfriend a few times in the two months they’d been together. But it was a rare side. Draco only acted like this when he was drunk or in private, surrounded by those he was most comfortable with. But here, Draco knew each word of the song, being carefree, cute and fucking beautiful as he did so.
However, his conscience continued to urge him to go forward with the date and to see it through. It had been a while since his last one. His up and down moods made it hard to date, let alone having any sort of relationship. He barely managed with his friendships, let alone romantic ones.
“FUCK!” he cried out in frustration. “GET UP YOUR FUCKING TWAT!”
As he smelled the earthy scent of the wine, Harry couldn’t help but ponder what Hermione and Ron would make of his date with Malfoy. They’d been shocked at first to hear that the former Slytherin was only living a few blocks away from Harry and that they’d become some sort of friends. He didn’t think they would be outraged when they found out that their relationship had taken on a more romantic note. Of course, Hermione and Ron didn’t know Malfoy quite like Harry did. And yes, the blond had apologized to both of them, along with several other people at Hogwarts after the war. They’d all come to some sort of truce and mutual understanding to put the past behind them.
They allowed the swaying crowd to guide their movements as they melted further into one another.
“Fuck. I wish someone would shut that bloody door,” commented Draco as he looked over his shoulder and glared at the offending door before cradling his piping hot mug in his hands and taking a small sip from it.
“Hi,” he mumbled as he stepped painfully into the room, eyes immediately falling on the gorgeous blond in the centre. Malfoy turned and looked at Harry, a wide smile on his face. Despite being left to wait, the blond seemed generally happy to see him. That made Harry feel ten times worse than he already was.
Soon the darkness was back, sitting on his shoulders like a familiar weight.  It happened a few days before Christmas. Harry didn’t know where it had come from all of a sudden. He’d heard of seasonal depression and the holidays being particularly hard for others. But that had never been an issue for him before. Maybe growing up Christmas had never been his favorite time of year, but all those miserable Christmases with the Dursleys had been made up for with years worth of celebrations at Hogwarts and The Burrow. He always looked forward nowadays to the cheerful, rowdy, mulled wine-infused, stuffed with mince pies Weasley’s Christmas’s.
Harry descended the stairs, two at a time as he made his way into the kitchen. He was starving and craving something sweet, like crepes. As he moved around the kitchen, opening and closing cupboards, he began to whistle to himself before an idea stuck in his head. What Harry really wanted was Molly’s fluffy french toast with juicy slices of peaches and powder sugar on top.
Harry stared at the dust particles floating in the air above the light.
“Please tell us what happened? You’re scaring us.”
Just as he opened his mouth to say something, he felt Harry’s mouth and hands on his ass. He grunted and moaned as a wave of pleasure and slight discomfort came over him all at once as Harry pulled the snug butt plug from him. He looked over his shoulder briefly and once again tried to say something to Harry about warning him next time. However, the words he was about to speak evaporated as another wave of pleasure coursed through him. Draco cried out as he felt the slick wet heat of Harry’s tongue against his rim, beginning to eat him out.
Draco immediately stopped dancing and turned on the spot to face Harry. His face broke into a grin when he saw the other man’s face. A lazy smile appeared across Harry’s in return.
“Harry,” pushed Hermione. “When was the last time you ate?
Of course, they all knew of each other. But Harry hadn’t attempted to introduce Draco to his friends and visa versa.  They both knew it would be a big deal when it happened, considering their history and so forth. So they’d both agreed to take things slow. Draco had had dinner once or twice with Hermione and Ron, and Harry with Pansy and her current fling at the time. But that was it. They had yet to do the whole hanging out casually as a couple with a large group of people yet.
“I love you, too,” Draco echoed back, his eyes darkening with lust.
Draco drew the curtains with a flick of his wand before removing Harry’s glasses from where they still rested on top of his head. He carefully folded them and placed them on the bedside table. He pressed a kiss to Harry’s temple, wishing him sweet, happy dreams before leaving the bedroom.
Just when his life had been starting to feel like his own again, after everything he’d gone through with The Dursleys and then Voldemort, the universe was handing him a third fuck you, Harry Potter! At this point, it felt like he would never truly get to live the normal, easy, simple life he craved. And then there in the middle of all this, Harry was also coming to terms with his sexuality.
They didn’t make it too far inwards before their hands and mouths were on each other.
Harry opened his mouth to reply but the words got stuck in the back of his throat. He was scared of what Draco would think of him; of how he just sat there on the kitchen floor as their daughter cried.
“Good night, Potter,” said Draco softly, his eyes darkening slightly as he took a small step closer to Harry. The blond then leaned forward and kissed Harry goodnight. It could hardly count as a proper kiss. But it was the promise of something.
He felt like crying, but his eyes were bone dry. He’d used up all his tears. He was just a useless sack of potatoes now, he thought.
The blond glanced up from his phone and met Pansy’s eye in the mirror. Draco had confided in the woman earlier about how Harry was going to be late. At first, it had just been a work thing, which hadn’t bothered the blond. He knew how much of an ass Harry’s boss could be at times. But now, there seemed to be a delay on the Tube. “Unfortunately, yes,” sighed Draco as he hit send before placing the phone back into the little bag at his waist.
“Are you trying to kill me?”
“Mocha,” spoke Draco sheepishly as he licked the foam from the corner of his mouth. “I’ve to admit, ever since you introduced me to this place Potter and those delicious dark chocolate mocha, I’ve been coming here at least once a week.”
Malfoy’s cheeks flushed ever so slightly as he nodded his head. “Really, Potter.”
“If that’s too soon, I understand. I just mean to say that I quite like you Potter and don’t want to wait around any longer.”
Draco didn’t like to play games. He didn’t see the point in waiting to owl someone you liked just so it might not appear too eager or whatnot. Maybe it was the pureblood manner coming through, he wasn’t sure. He liked Harry and wanted to go on a second date with him.
“Because I  feel good. I don't need to go anymore. I haven't had an episode in ages.  Therapy only makes me feel down about myself. I'm tired of it.”
“Go away, Luna,” he spat, but there was no bite to his words. It was as if seeing Luna had broken something inside of him. He could never be angry or cross with Luna. She never treated him like the others did. He held the girl’s gaze for a second before looking away as another wave of emotion washed through him. He then violently wiped his eyes with the back of his hands, biting down hard on his lower lip, preventing a sob from escaping. He didn’t want to cry anymore.
The house was eerily quiet as he stepped through the Floo and brushed the ash from his hair and shoulders.
As they continued to get lost in the kiss, Harry began to allow his hands to wander. His fingers rubbed at the outside of Draco’s thighs, from the middle to the beltline and back, enjoying the sensation of the soft wool of Draco’s pants against the pads of his fingers. Draco still had his arms around Harry’s neck, his fingers playing with the soft curls at the back of it.
“Fuck, yeah…”
As Harry began to tap his foot along to the music, the lights flashed like lightning in the middle of a summer storm, and his eyes went straight to the middle of the dance floor. His eyes zoomed in on Draco. The blond looked striking as he moved his slender hips to the soulful beat. Harry watched, captivated as he pressed himself up to Pansy and began to sing along to the song.
A part of him knew that Draco wouldn’t judge him or be angry with him. This wasn’t the first time Draco would come across Harry immobile on the floor. Nevertheless, that little thought always lingered in the back of his mind. There was always a first for everything. This was also the first time that Harry’s bipolar would be affecting their daughter.
The smile soon shattered into a frown.
He stood there in front of the mirror for a second or two longer, running his hands through his mess of curls before once again smiling smugly at himself. He was practically shimmering, he thought and this was a good thing.
“I’m sorry, Malfoy,” apologized Harry in a quiet voice. He held onto the door frame for support as he continued to look at Malfoy, guilty.
“This has been nice Potter,” spoke Malfoy as he ran a hand over the strap of the brown leather messenger bag and adjusted it on his shoulder.
Harry was still panting as he turned onto his side and faced Draco. His mind was racing as a thousand thoughts and feelings overwhelmed him. “Draco?”
Harry shook his head. No, he wasn’t physically hurt. Just mentally. He let out a shaky breath before biting down hard on his lower lip. He could feel himself being close to losing it again and he didn’t want to. He tried to blink back the tears but they came anyway. They filled his eyes before falling one by one down his cheeks.
However, when five minutes went by with no reply, Harry decided to face the music and head inside.
Harry was the first to act. His head was buzzing as his body seemed to reach out for Malfoy on its own accord. Hands came to rest on either side of the blond’s face. He held him there for a second, glazing into his eyes before bringing his mouth down onto his.
“Fuck. Draco.
“What? No. It’s late,” Harry began to protest. He didn’t want Hermione to come over. At least not tonight. Maybe have her check in in the morning? But not now. This was just a warning.
“That’s not important.” The blond looked at Harry for a long second before reaching out and caressing the side of his face. “You’re the most important thing at the moment. I’m here for you, always.”
“Some fool decided to jump in front of a train. There’s a delay on one of the lines,” muttered Draco as he crossed his arms over his chest. “I knew he should’ve taken a fucking Uber as I suggested.”
! You’d better turn off that bloody fucking alarm, Potter!”
Harry, who was taken off guard by this small and intimate gesture, just stared at Luna in bewilderment before trying to pull away. However, despite her airy appearance, Luna was quite strong and held onto Harry’s hand, not letting him go. Harry tried to pull away a second time before giving up. He let out a sound which was a mixture of a sob and sigh, before pressing his forehead into his knees. He allowed Luna to continue to hold his hand, but he didn’t dare to look at her.
“Why?” asked Draco.
The snow just seemed like another burden he would have to face today. The snow meant that his twenty-minute walk to the grocery store would be hard and grueling as he tracked his way through the slush- and ice-covered sidewalks.
Bless her.
“Harry,” spoke Draco softly as he opened the small box and stared down at the necklace.
Disco music blared as a crowd of dancing bodies moved like one giant organ in the middle of the room. A large disco ball hung high above, cascading a rainbow of light throughout. Harry couldn’t help but feel like he’d somewhat been transported back in time to the ‘70s.
Harry stumbled as he got up, but he forced his legs to move. He will not surrender, he thought. Not yet.
He reached for his glasses on the end table and slipped them on as he left the bedroom and followed the source of music.
“Of course,” replied Draco, sincerely. Of course, he loved Harry. When had he implied that he didn’t? He wondered.
After paying and receiving his tumbler of bourbon, Harry turned his attention back to the rest of the club.
“Draco! Don’t be stupid. Your skin is flawless!” cried Pansy in amusement from behind him. She’d only said it to get his mind off of his boyfriend, and it had worked, she noted happily.
The blond winked in response to this, continuing to move his body to the music. He couldn’t believe how good he felt at this very moment. Tonight was turning out to be exactly what he had hoped it would be. When Harry had first texted Draco telling him he was going to be late, he’d been upset and thought for sure that that was a sign that nothing would go his way tonight. Draco had had disappointing birthdays in the past. He always had these high hopes and expectations on what he wanted them to be, but in reality, nothing ever quite measured up. But tonight, for once, fate was turning out to work in his favour. Sure Harry was late, but he was here now, dancing with Draco. Secretly that’s all he had wanted for his birthday.
“Okay, maybe I do a bit. But it’s not what you think, Malfoy...I’m sick.”
“Because I decided I didn't need to go.”
He couldn’t help but smile slightly as he rose slowly up onto his elbows, careful not to shake the bed too much as he did so. Reaching out with his left hand, he traced a gentle finger along the plump curve of Nova’s doughy cheek. He resisted the urge to pick up the sleeping infant. He didn’t want to wake her.
“Didn’t you?” asked Draco, as he appeared over the rim of his cup at the woman seated across from him.
“Come here,” murmured Harry, reaching out for Draco.
“Then turn off that fucking alarm, already!”
Draco winked at Harry before beginning to walk away.
“You're surprised,” observed Draco as he leaned back in his seat and studied Hermione. A small curl of a smile appearing across his features.
He rubbed his face before putting on his glasses, he didn’t remember taking off.
“Harry?” he whispered as he made his way towards the bed and towered over Harry. He placed a hand on his shoulder and gently shook him.
They continued to dance. Their hot and slightly sweaty bodies continued to press against each other to the beat of the music. Harry’s heart was racing with excitement and arousal as he continued to get lost in Draco’s eyes. He wondered if Draco was feeling the same. Or was it just him who was hyperventilating slightly?
Draco just looked at Harry for a second before rolling his eyes. He pretended to be annoyed but couldn’t fake it for long. A small smile soon spread across his face as he felt Harry continue to stare at him.
Draco let out a small amused chuckle at this. “I thought you would.”
The bright morning sunlight filtered in through the crack in the curtains as the alarm on Harry’s phone went off.
“Because...because you said you couldn’t deal with me...” Harry's voice trailed off as a sudden wave of emotion took over him. “Last time, you left...you never came back.”
Harry immediately felt the heat in the cheeks as he turned a deep crimson in embarrassment. Never before had he been called beautiful.
Now, Harry felt rushed as he gave up on the tie and threw it into the black duffle bag on the bench behind him. He’d planned on taking his sweet time showering and making himself look perfect for tonight. But that idea was out the door now. After the mind-numbing long meeting had finally wrapped up, Harry had taken a quick shower before getting dressed. He was glad he’d chosen to pack his outfit that morning into his gym bag, just in case. He could’ve gone home, but then he’d be wasting more time than he wanted to.
“I dunno,” shrugged Harry. “It wasn’t something I told anyone. Besides Hermione and Ron, no one really knew.”
Draco smiled softly at Harry as he noticed he was awake. The blond was still dressed in his clothes from earlier. “You’re awake.”
Draco just looked at Harry in puzzlement before bagging the three perfect peaches he’d just found and placed them carefully into his basket, making sure not to bruise them. “Well, as fun as this has been, Potter. I’ll leave you to it.”
It didn’t take long afterwards before they were both losing control and coming, shouting out in completion as they did so.
“Yes. But not yet. Not like this,” Draco hissed back as he tried to regain some control of the situation.
“Tomorrow is perfect!”
He banged his head against the cabinet door repeatedly, begging himself to get up. He knew that Nova would be alright. That she wasn’t in any immediate danger. But it still didn’t lessen the guilt in the slightest. He knew that all the parenting books said that it was good to let the baby cry and settle themselves back to sleep. Harry disagreed. He knew what it was like to be a child and cry and have no one there to comfort you. No, he would never let his child think that they were alone.
Harry’s absences at work soon started to piss off the Head Auror and his other superiors. There was only so far being The Chosen One or the Minster putting in a good word for him could get you. It didn’t seem to matter how many dark wizards and witches he caught on his good days. He eventually had to face the music that he couldn’t keep on living like this. Bipolar was kicking his ass.
As Rita Hayworth continued to sing, Harry couldn’t help but be reminded about an old quote from Rita he’d once either read or heard. “Every man I knew went to bed with Gilda… and woke up with me”
“You can't do that. It's my decision to go or not. Not yours. Paul from group therapy stopped seeing his therapist and went almost completely off his meds too.”
“I’m getting into bed,” replied Draco as he stretched out on the other side, careful not to awaken the baby.
Neville met Harry’s eye and raised an eyebrow, gesturing to his lap.
The two lovers continued to glare intensely at each other for a second longer before Draco let out a deep sigh and abruptly turned away from Harry. He couldn’t be here, he thought suddenly. If he stayed any longer he would say or do something stupid that he would regret
His breathing was ragged as he tried to gather up enough energy to move again. A long painful moment passed before he tried again to get up, but was unsuccessful. Harry couldn’t physically move, he found. It felt like there was an invisible hand holding him down in place.
Walking On Sunshine was playing loudly from the store’s sound system, ironically as Harry walked through the automatic doors and reached for a plastic shopping basket. He couldn’t help but smile to himself again. Walking on sunshine, indeed.
A couple of weeks passed.
Draco is going to be here soon, he thought. “Please. Please just let me enjoy this evening.”
Harry didn’t necessarily want to die. But living was becoming harder to do. He just figured it would be easier on everyone if he just died.  He would no longer be a burden to Hermione and Ron, who had their own lives to live. He wouldn’t have to keep on lying to everyone about why he wasn’t working or seeing anyone. He wouldn’t have to keep worrying the Weasleys when he didn’t show up to Sunday brunch without an excuse.
Draco took the stairs two at a time as he raced towards the bedroom. His heart was pounding in anticipation of what he would find there. He knew Harry had been suicidal in the past. Hermione had told him briefly how Harry had been after their break-up in the winter. Draco feared suddenly that he’d pushed Harry too far once again by leaving abruptly and not staying and talking it through like he should’ve.
“Yeah…” Harry moaned as Draco licked his way back up the side of his neck before beginning to suck on his earlobe. The hardness of Draco’s cloth-covered cock pressing into his stomach and the heat of Draco’s lips on his ear sent a wave of pleasure to pool low in his stomach. Harry was always like a kitten, melting underneath the warmth of Draco’s tongue and mouth anywhere near his ear. He moaned again as he felt the tip of Draco’s tongue flick ever so slightly into the drum of his ear. He rutted up against the other man for a moment before taking matters into his own hands.
“I’m gay!” he sobbed as he turned away from London and sank to the floor. He brought his knees up to his chest and began to rock back and forth. Every homophobic slur and act he’d ever witnessed played out in his mind finishing with the look of disgust Ginny had given him when he’d confessed. Harry felt dirty and shameful all at once, like he’d cheated or something.
It had been several months since his last depressive episode. It’d been right before the baby had been born. That was four months ago now. Just yesterday he’d been the happiest man on the planet. He hated how he’d thought he was out of the woods. How he allowed himself to be optimistic for once in his bloody life. He’d hoped it was all over, but then the darkness crept out of fucking nowhere.
The couple didn’t exchange another word as Draco helped Harry to his feet and led him to the bedroom. They had a routine down pat now when Harry had a depressive episode. Draco made sure that the bedroom was dark and just to Harry’s liking. He helped Harry strip down to just his briefs before climbing into the bed. Harry liked to be weighed down with blankets and pillows. Within seconds of Harry’s head hitting the pillow, he was fast asleep.
“...Amazing.”
It wasn’t until he was halfway through the store, that he saw a display of heart-shaped boxes of chocolate that he realized what time of year it was. Ever since New Year’s, he hadn’t paid too much attention to the date. He hadn’t even realized it was February yet, let alone Valentine’s Day. He only knew time now as the days of the week. He had therapy on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Hermione and Ron would come over on Friday nights. He would see Teddy on Saturdays. Harry couldn’t remember the last time he’d actually looked at a calendar.
“Where are you now, mood-wise?” asked Draco after a moment of silence had passed.
They’d decided on adoption quite quickly. They both didn’t care if the child was biologically theirs or not. That wasn’t important to them. Neither if the child was of magical descent nor not. They just wanted a healthy baby to call their own. As a whole, they were both open-minded.
“Because no one else knows what it is like,” spoke Draco almost shyly as he played with his now empty cup.
“HARRY?” he called out again as he made his way to the kitchen. Everything seemed to be in the same place it had been when he left earlier. There were pots still on the stove and half chopped vegetables on the cutting board. It looked like Harry never finished making dinner. Draco checked to make sure that the stove was off before heading towards the stairs. He had a good idea of where Harry would be.
He must’ve dozed off for a second because the next thing he recalled was the dip of the mattress on the other end of the bed. He lifted his head to meet Draco’s eye. “What are you doing?” whispered Harry. Draco was supposed to be going out that night. It was Pansy’s birthday party.
Harry made sure that there were no upcoming alarms before placing the phone back onto the bedside table and lying back down. He glanced briefly over at Draco’s back before rolling onto his side and falling back to sleep.
He rubbed at his eyes as he came down the stairs, the old worn wood groaning with each step he took. As he came into the sitting room, he stopped short at what he saw. Draco had Sirius’s old recorded player out on the coffee table. Scattered all around it was piles of recorders. Usually, it was all kept tucked away in a chest in Sirius’s old bedroom. Draco, who Harry was learning had a thing for music, must have brought it down sometime since Harry had fallen asleep.
His heart was racing, and his breathing was ragged as he sat up abruptly in his four-poster bed. His eyes darted around the dorm room, where his two roommates were still fast asleep. Harry sighed in relief, collapsing back down into the pillows and closed his eyes, willing his morning wood to go away.
Draco ran a hand through the mess of Harry’s curls before sinking to his knees beside him. Harry, who was too lost in his own thoughts, didn’t take notice of Draco’s return at first. It wasn’t until Draco had repeated his name for the third time that he finally looked up and met Draco’s eye.
His stomach growled loudly at just the mere thought of them. Harry closed his eyes and let out a groan as he began to salivate on how good that would be at the moment. Slamming his hands down onto the counter, he opened his eyes and decided that was what he wanted.
“So did you!” snarled Draco coldly.
“Then how?”
“No. Bipolar,” answered Harry. “I’m bipolar.”
It wasn’t until Draco reached out and touched Harry on the knee that the brunet finally looked in his direction. A fresh set of tears filled Harry’s eyes as he looked at Draco’s worried face.
No instead of telling Draco what was really bothering him and how he’d really been. Harry went with his default answer. It was too soon to tell Malfoy anything about the mess that was his brain.
Harry smiled at this. “I want you too, Draco.”
“Dinner. You know what, never mind. I knew it was too good to be true.” The blond began to turn around and descend the stairs of the front stoop.
“Are you hurt?” asked Draco softly, his eyes flickering to the shards of broken pottery on the floor for a second before coming back to rest on Harry.
Draco’s eyes continued to linger on Harry’s before looking down at his dark red lips, which were just screaming to be fucking kissed. His gaze shifted back onto Harry’s eyes which were dark with lust. As much as Draco wanted to, he resisted the urge to kiss Harry. Instead, he began to sing along to the song again, this time his voice soft, only meant for Harry to hear.
He placed the bag onto the footstool, in the stall corner, before turning on the shower. A small moan of pleasure escaped from his lips as the hot spray of water hit his back, and his hand immediately went to his cock. He didn’t waste any time as he gripped his shaft and twisted his hand upwards. He squeezed his eyes shut and allowed for the image of the Indian prince to return.
“Therapy helps you though. I don't think you should just stop going.”
“I, myself, am pansexual," announced Luna proudly.
The kiss was soft for a moment before growing in passion. Malfoy’s hands went to Harry’s hips as he pressed him up against the wall of the hallway. The blond let out a noise as his back hit the wall just as Harry’s tongue swiped along his bottom lip, before roughly prying open his mouth. Malfoy knew that Potter would be a good kisser, but he couldn’t quite get over the initial shock of it all. Potter’s lips were unbelievably soft.
Draco danced like no one was watching, but of course, they all were.
Harry barely had time to move out of the way before Hermione was coming through the Floo. She brushed the ash off of her shoulder before looking down at Harry, who was seated on the floor, looking like a lost child.
That on top of it being a black-tie event. Harry had been worried about the party for weeks. And now that the actual day had come, he couldn’t fucking get out of bed.
But as he got closer, the peaches weren’t the only thing that caught his attention.
Hermione threw her boyfriend a disgusted look before hitting him on the arm. Now was not the time or place to be making remarks on Harry’s BO.
Harry made a little face in discomfort but didn’t protest like Draco was half expecting him to. He knew that Harry wasn’t much of a dancer and felt quite out of place doing so. Instead, Harry let go of Draco’s hand, taking a small step forward, closing the space between them and placing his hands on Draco’s hips. Harry looked shyly up at Draco over his glasses and raised a brow questioningly, asking what Draco was waiting for.
Tonight would be the first time Harry would be meeting most of Draco’s friends. He’d met some of them already, of course; his cousin Luna who was more like a sister. And he’d met Pansy and Blaise, Draco’s mates from school. But those were only the cream of the crop when it came to Draco’s never-ending list of friends and colleagues.
“Do you want to get ice-cream?” asked Harry as they stumbled out of the restaurant together and into the warm summer air. He ran a hand through his hair, while the other nervously adjusted his glasses on the bridge of his nose which had begun to slip down.
Harry pushed his way through the dimly lit club until he reached the bar. As he waited for the bartender, his eyes took a quick glimpse around the place. The walls were painted red, and there was disco and funk memorabilia plastered everywhere.
“I wanted to come,” whispered Harry in a weak attempt to explain his reasons to Draco.
Harry didn’t know if it the pounding of the beats from the music or the alcohol coursing through his veins or the beautiful grey eyes pouring into him or a mixture of the three, but he was suddenly overwhelmed with the need for more. Dancing was fun, but he wanted more of Draco. He wanted to feel his hands on his waist, roaming down his back to his ass. He wanted to feel those lips on his, sucking all the air from his lungs. He wanted to melt into Draco.
He poured a glass of water, not taking anything in. His mind felt like it was filled with sand, making everything blurry and itchy around the edges. He was just coming out of a low period. It hadn’t been his worst episode ever, but it had still been pretty rough.
Harry wiped the sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand before slowly pulling out of Draco and collapsing down beside him.
“I believe this is officially our song now.”
Harry, in his young teens, hadn't known what it all meant. Hogwarts not having any sort of sex ed course, he was left to his own devices when learning any information on sex and the confusing feelings he was having. He’d thought about going to Hermione and asking, but the mere thought of it broke him out into a cold sweat. So he just did what he did best and compressed his feelings and thoughts deep down inside of himself.
Draco and Hermione shared a smile before Hermione was offering more tea to Draco, who gladly accepted.
He knew it was shitty of him to cut off Hermione like that. He knew that she was only trying to help and had all the best intentions at heart. He just couldn’t deal with it all at the moment. His brain was still foggy like he was still waking up. There was a reason he’d stopped going to see a Mind Healer or the Muggle therapist afterward. Harry didn’t like to talk about himself or his feelings. He’d never been good at it. It always made him feel uncomfortable and itchy like there were ants suddenly crawling all over his skin. He’d tried at the beginning, he had. He had wanted to get better.
Harry at first had just said he was cutting back on drinking because of new year, new me, and whatnot. And then started saying he'd had too much the night before. But he soon grew tired of constantly lying. He was already pretty much doing that on a daily basis with his old school friends who still didn’t know about his illness. And then, eventually, he just stopped going out altogether when the idea of just sitting there surrounded by happy drunks made him loathe himself.
“It doesn't work like that Harry. You feel good because the medication and therapy are working. If you go off of them then your mood swings will come back. Bipolar isn't something you can just fix. You can only control it.”
After finishing their second cups of coffee and sharing a piece of chocolate cake, they exited the coffee shop and stepped into the early evening light.
Draco grunted and groaned loudly, not caring if he woke up his neighbours as Harry continued to pound into him. He reared his back and matched Harry’s savage thrusts stroke for stroke. He could feel his orgasm building, but he didn’t want to cum like this. He was suddenly overwhelmed with the need to see Harry. As much as he liked taking it from behind, he took great pleasure in seeing his boyfriend cum.
He looked gorgeous, he thought. He knew it was a little big-headed and narcissistic to think of himself as attractive, but he didn’t give two hoots at the moment. Draco Malfoy was young and beautiful, and he knew it. And damn, it was his fucking birthday! He was utterly entitled to feel good about himself.
He’d heard of it happening enough times in his bipolar support group to put him off of telling anyone else about his disorder. Plus he was stable now. Him having an episode since getting together with Draco hadn’t been an issue. He felt like he was on the other side now.
“Nothin’,” said Harry with a yawn. “Can’t I just admire my boyfriend?”
A small cry escaped from the back of her throat before she abruptly went to the bed.
“I would like to try again... If you want to, of course. I’ve missed you.”
Harry pulled his mouth away from Draco’s tip, making a popping noise as he did so, and grinned sheepishly up at the blond. “Don’t you want to?” he asked playfully as he gently continued to stroke Draco’s shaft. His touch was soft and teasing. He knew he must be driving Draco wild and that was exactly what he wanted.
He watched Draco’s every move, once again becoming mesmerized by him.
Harry looked at his appearance in the mirror for a second longer before deciding he’d done enough primping. This was as good as it was going to get, he thought. He looked briefly at his phone before pocketing it and doing up the zip of his duffle bag.
“Ginny didn’t tell me anything.”
But Harry hadn’t done that.
“It has,” agreed with Harry, shoving his hands awkwardly into the front pockets of his jeans.
The single ceiling light in the small room immediately buzzed to life as Harry stepped into the small cramped space. He stared hard at his reflection in the mirror for a second, before dropping his gaze onto the round basin and turned on the faucet. He tried not to notice the flickering of the light above him or the slight tremor of his hands as he pushed his glasses off of his face and splashed cold water onto his cheeks.
“Potter. Nice of you to finally show your face. I was beginning to worry that this was all some sort of bloody setup…” teased Malfoy in a playful tone before trailing off as he took in the disheveled appearance of the other man. “You look like shit.” The smile was gone and replaced with a look of concern.
Hermione just ignored him as she began to move about the room, opening the curtains and flooding the space with sudden light.
“How did you put up with him for so long?” asked Draco as he blew cold air on the steamy cup of tea that Hermione had just placed down in front of him.
Harry rubbed his eyes and tried to stop the tremble in his hands as he brought the glass to his lips. He let out a shuddered breath, trying to make sense of everything. He didn’t remember what had triggered the episode. But it didn’t take much to set his mood spiraling down low. His moods were always up and down, up and down like a rollercoaster that Harry very much wanted to get off of, but couldn’t.
Harry then took Draco’s hand into his own and led him up the flight of stairs to his bedroom. He was nervous but in a good way. He was painfully turned on, something he didn’t often experience. He welcomed the desire with open arms. He wanted to enjoy tonight. His heart raced and the palms of his hands began to sweat as he reached for the doorknob with his free one and opened it slowly. He couldn’t help but look over his shoulder and catch Draco’s eye. They shared a quiet smile before entering the room.
The couple slept for a few more hours before being awoken yet again by an alarm going off. This time it was Draco’s. Both men groaned as the song on the radio came to an end, and the radio jockey’s cheerful voice blared around the room.
“I don’t know where the fuck he is,” Harry spat out bitterly as he tried to keep his emotions at bay. He still didn’t look at Hermione or Ron. He stared off into the distance.
He didn’t waste another moment as he kicked off the covers and got out of bed. He was bursting with energy, his whole body practically vibrating as though someone had flicked on a switch in him, making his magic hum through his veins. He dressed quickly, not paying attention to what he was grabbing as he pulled it from the wardrobe. Harry had never been good at “fashion.” And on any other day, he didn’t pay attention to what was on his body. The only thing he asked of his clothes was for them to be comfortable.
He didn’t know if he could survive a whole week without his boyfriend.
The room was silent except for the heavy breathing and the wet sound of lube. Harry quickly screwed the lid back onto the jar, careful not to get any on the sheets. He had learned the hard way rather quickly how messy lube could get when left open. Harry then kissed the back of Draco’s neck as he ran his hands softly up and down his sides briefly before coming to rest on his ass. With one hand, he then pulled one of the cheeks to the side as the other held onto his cock and guided it to Draco’s entrance.
However, the moment he moved his feet, his legs betrayed him, slipping underneath him like a baby deer trying to walk. He caught himself though before falling face-first onto the tiled floor. His hands gripped onto the sides of the sink for dear life before collapsing onto the toilet seat.
Draco cocked an eyebrow at this in confusion. Both boys had stopped dancing and were staring intensely at each other.
Malfoy held Harry’s gaze as he nodded his head in understanding. “I get it.”
It looked more like some posh restaurant than a club to him. A posh restaurant wouldn’t be out of place for Draco to have his birthday party, but Harry was pretty sure that it was meant to be a club. He recalled, pretty clearly, the blond going on and on about wanting to go out dancing for his big day.
“It’s okay,” spoke Luna as she once again sat down across from Harry. “It’s much more enjoyable here.”
“Coffee then? There is a coffee shop just around the corner from here that does the best dark chocolate mocha!”
“I’m going to run you a bath,” explained Hermione. “And then you are going to tell me what happened.”
How could he have gone and kissed a boy in front of everyone like that? How could he have gone and kissed not only a boy but Draco fucking Malfoy of all people?
He lay there for what seemed like forever, fighting with himself when the Floo downstairs went off. His heart began to race as he heard movement from downstairs a moment later. A cold sweat ran down his neck as he forced himself up into a seated position. He knew who it was.
Kissing Potter, however, was nothing like any of his previous experiences.
“What happened Harry? Why did you block your Floo?”
The sky had turned a dusty pink since they had first entered.  Dinner with Draco did seem like a wonderful idea. But Harry knew better than to push his luck for one day. He could feel his emotions begin to fade. Despite the three cups of coffee he had and the hours of sleep he had endured over the last week, he was exhausted.  All he wanted was to be alone in his bathtub and read a book.
After finishing their coffees, they decided it was too cozy at Lola’s not to stay inside and have lunch there.
“Thank you for being honest with me, Harry. About everything,” spoke Draco softly as he pulled away and locked eyes with the brunet. “Can I owl you?”
“What’s got you in such a chipper mood this morning?” asked Draco, looking at Harry through the corner of his eye.
The two men cackled at Harry’s empty threat.
They both groaned at the same time. Harry closed his eyes briefly as the feel of being encased in the tightness of Draco’s flesh washed over him.
He didn’t know what kicked it off really. What caused him to have these dramatic shifts in moods. Maybe it was blood sugar, chemical, logical...who knows. The only way that Harry could describe it to others was like it was a monster from a black and white movie, keeping up with him, lurking in every dark corner, waiting to pounce. And he could try to fight it off, but the monster was stronger and smarter than him at times. No matter how hard he tried, the monster always won. However, there was one place it seemed that the monster could never find him, bed.
“Yes. So good,” Harry murmured back. He ran his hands along Draco’s back, feeling the lean muscles underneath before coming to rest on his ass. He dug his fingers into the fleshy cheeks, pulling them apart slightly.
“Why wouldn’t I?” asked Draco as he took off his shoes and lay down beside Harry.
“I saw the bottle of wine in the kitchen. Have you been drinking?”
“I know. I’m sorry, babe,” apologized Harry over the music as he lowered Draco’s hand but did not release it from his grip. He threaded his fingers through Draco’s and squeezed.
Draco owled Harry the very next day, making his intentions and feelings well known.
“I haven’t! I had a date.”
“You’re acting very strange, Potter,” remarked Draco. He didn’t know if he should be amused or weirded out by Harry’s overall perkiness. He couldn’t recall ever seeing Potter so upbeat and just plain happy before.
“No! I’m bloody well not!” Harry glared at his boyfriend in the dark.
Draco rolled his eyes at this, “I can see that. But what for?”
Harry had had the same dream almost every night since he’d met...no, not met but
“Hey,” whispered Draco as he reached out and pulled Harry closer to him, comforting him. “I’m sorry, I scared you. I love you. I’m never leaving you again. I’m here for you, always.”
Harry slid his hand down Draco’s stomach to his hard cock. He pulled on it gently at first before deepening his touch as he continued to rub against him.
“I’m trying to be honest. I’m trying to give people a chance...to get to know the real me,” Harry’s voice broke slightly on the last word. He hadn’t meant to break down like this. He hadn’t really when he’d told the others. But coming out to Draco was the most important, he guessed. He wanted Draco to see him for who he really was and not the outgoing, eccentric manic side of himself or the sad, depressing side. He wanted him to see every side of himself and not the two versions that were constantly at battle, butting heads.
“Fuck. It’s hot in here!” remarked the blond as he slid in beside Harry and immediately snatched his drink from his hands.
Lola’s Cafe was busy that morning as the two men walked through the door. They stood awkwardly for a moment, hovering by the entrance, both waiting for the other to say something and make a decision. Harry was the one to finally speak up after a second or two.
“It’s a date then!”
Harry was practically glowing by this point, he was in such a good mood as he walked into the produce section and his eyes immediately went towards the delicious selection of juicy, soft fuzzy fruit. The brunette couldn’t help but lick his lips at the sight of them. They were gorgeous.
Harry just stared at the blond in disbelief for a second before nodding his head. He was suddenly filled with hope.
“You found your present,” Draco smirked. His grey eyes beamed with a mixture of arousal and amusement as they continued to pierce into Harry’s. It wasn’t technically Harry's present, though. More like Harry’s present to him, that was. Harry had bought the pink rhinestone heart-shaped plug as a bit of a silly joke/present for Draco a couple of days ago. At the time, Harry had said something about not being able to afford a real diamond.  Draco winked at Harry before turning around on the bed, giving his boyfriend a much better view of his plugged ass.
It wasn’t until a year later that they got a phone call that changed their lives forever. A baby, a little girl, had been abandoned at St. Mungos over an hour ago and the hospital had immediately contacted the agency who had Fire Called them right away, saying the baby was theirs if they wanted it.
Harry’s hands continued to cup the sides of Malfoy’s face, pulling his mouth close to his. His tongue darted around the warm concaves of the blond’s mouth before slipping out and sucked softly on the bottom lip before running his tongue along the edge of his teeth. Harry couldn’t help but marvel at how good Malfoy tasted. There was a sweetness there. The blond tasted like honey in some odd way.
Harry opened his wallet and waited to hear what the coat charge would be. But the man behind the counter just grinned at Harry as he handed him over a numbered ticket. “Enjoy your evening.”
Draco believed in second chances.
“But it’s
Harry then watched in confusion as Luna’s hands reached up for the brightly coloured flower crown on top of her head, taking it off before leaning forward and placing it on his head. He felt himself blush again at this gesture, which felt powerfully intimate.
It was at that moment that Malfoy looked up from his book, as if he sensed Harry’s eyes on him. The blond just stared at Harry for a brief second before his face lit up into a small smile.
"I took a shower and had a long wank, thinking about you,” said Harry slowly as he began to rotate his hips ever so slightly up against Draco’s front.
Two cups of tea and a piece of cake later, Draco returned home.
The radio jockey’s voice faded out as an advert for toothpaste began to play.
His brain didn’t work like that.
“Ah, good,” spoke Draco with a small smile as he turned to see Harry come down the stairs. “Your time was almost up, Potter.”
Harry didn’t answer right away. He let out a shaky breath as he tried to gather his thoughts. What was wrong, he thought, everything.
As he made his way through the store at a leisurely pace like a person who didn’t have to be anywhere particular that morning, he began to sing along to the song in a soft voice.  He picked up things at random and put them in his basket. Other than the peaches, he didn’t have anything else he needed to buy. However, he found joy in perusing the shelves looking at all the brightly colour packaging and items displayed.
Harry knew if he continued to stay there, allowing for Draco’s tongue to lick and kiss his skin that he would be cumming in a matter of seconds. And as much as he wanted to cum and release himself, he wanted to make Draco feel good too. It was his birthday, after all. He wanted this night to be only about Draco and what he wanted.
“Do you want tea?” asked Hermione as she kneeled down in front of Harry. She made a small movement with her hand, like she was going to reach out and touch him, but decided against it. She knew Harry didn’t like to be touched when he was like this.
“I’ll see you, two buggers, later,” Harry said as he placed the bag onto his shoulder.
It was times like these that he wished that actual magic existed in the world. That with the snap of his fingers or the wave of a wand, he could be dressed and pristine. But, no, magic didn’t exist. Harry was left to his own stupid uselessness to get ready and make himself look decent for his boyfriend’s birthday party.
The blond stood at the bottom of the stoop, looking up at Harry with a sneer on his face. He looked like he was about to tell Harry to fuck off. However, something changed in his face as he continued to peer up at the house. His face softened and before Harry knew it, Draco was making his way back up towards him.
If Harry was nervous before, he was overwhelmed with nerves now. His heart began to race as he felt the back of his hands begin to sweat as his eyes fell onto Malfoy. The blond was seated by the window, head bent, engrossed in a novel. There was a pair of round tortoise glasses resting on the bridge of his nose. Harry had never seen the other man wearing glasses before. He’d never thought of glasses being a turn-on for him until now. Seeing Malfoy wearing those prudish-looking things did things to his body.
Draco’s tongue worked with firm pressure around the head of Harry’s cock and along the shaft. Harry could feel all the blood pooling in his groin, his cock expanding into Draco’s throat. Draco sucked hungrily, lustily at Harry. Harry moaned and whimpered, crying out sweet words of encouragement with each flick of Draco’s tongue on his tip.
Draco let out a small shriek at this statement before pushing Pansy out of the way and going again to the mirror. He immediately leaned over the sink and stared at his face as if to see immediate wrinkles there. One of his worst fears was ageing prematurely. He was only 26 and knew he had at least another good ten years before he had to worry about wrinkles. But it was still a fear, and even then, that’s what Botox was for.
Harry then pressed a kiss to Draco’s neck as his left hand wrapped around the base of Draco’s cock and began to pump him leisurely as his other hand reached back and grabbed an ass cheek. His fingers dug into the flesh before pulling it to the side, stretching it.
He then bit hard on the skin before kissing the area and making his way back up towards Draco’s mouth. Their tongues met in a passionate dance as Harry moved his hand along Draco’s shaft to the head. He twisted his hand up over the tip with a firm grip, milking it until precum was leaking onto his fingers. Draco moaned and whimpered as Harry continued to stroke his cock. Harry’s other hand, which was still kneading at Draco’s ass cheek, went to move in between in search of the hole but stopped suddenly when the pads of his fingers came in contact with something cold and hard.
The two men stared at each other for a moment or two longer before looking away shyly.
He frowned as he studied the red brick exterior of the building. He wasn’t sure if this was the right place or not. It didn’t look like any of the clubs he’d frequent in the past. Instead of just being a large iron door, a flashing neon sign, and a giant bouncer standing guard, two large potted plants were on either side of a modern glass door. There was no music pouring from inside out onto the streets as most clubs had. There wasn’t even a lineup of people sectioned off by a red velvet rope.
