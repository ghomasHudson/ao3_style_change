He couldn't take it. With much more force than neccessary, Draco pushed away his blanket and made his way over to his closet. The black cabinet held memories he held dearly. He remembered the exact moment Harry opened the door. Back then, he was scared for his life. He thought that he was there to kill him. Funny thing, Harry was now the only source keeping him alive. The blond Lord often felt like a drowning boy, his only hope being the surface of water. It was so close, but he couldn't reach it without help. Freedom, life. He couldn't reach it without Harry.
Lack of sleep and extreme exhaustion;
"I love it Harry. Would you help me to put it on?", Draco whispered, his eyes filled with soft love. The other nodded, carefully putting on the fine necklace. A smile lingered on both of their faces, shy and dreamy.
No pain, no uncomfortable feeling... oh Merlin. Draco's eyes told it all. Fear.
Harry didn't know what exactly made him obey to her. Maybe her strong stature? Or his natural respect for french women, influenced by Fleur? Or maybe it was the 24 hours of work? No matter what exactly made him do it, he was soon leading Angela to Malfoy's room. His vision was partly a little bit blurry, he really needed a coffee at least.
Harry flinched slightly at the words, even though they weren't the worst of possibilities. Still, a young boy growing up with arthritis is somehow always a little bit disadvantaged.
Harry quickly managed to win the upper hand, straddling Nott and punching him rapidly in the face. A feeling of satisfaction spread through Draco through every punch, nevertheless, he grabbed Harry's hands and held them away from Nott's face.
Of course, as soon as Harry and Ron stepped foot into the Granger-Weasley household, Hermione was there to scold the two men and immediately send Harry to the hospital. The woman wasn't one to talk to about an unconsciousness, no matter how short it was. Even though Harry tried to get himself out the situation, he ended up in the room right next to Draco's only twenty minutes later. Hermione sat besides him, listening to the same story the young Healer already told Ron and Kingsley. Her bushy brows were furrowed, eyes far away.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I will repay you for this next year. Maybe even at your birthday."
Harry accioed a piece of parchment from the main room, together with a black feather quill and handed both to Malfoy. He wrote down a floo-address, together with a name. Angela Allard. The young Healer frowned at the name. It sounded both English and French, it felt weird on his tongue. And he didn't know who that was. The address was located in France, probably the reason for the French last name. Whoever this girl was, Malfoy must be really fond of her. If the puppy eyes he threw at Harry were any indicator.
"What a brave bloody boy you are, Draco. Living up fully to your name, huh?", he asked grinning, patting the blonde's shoulder all the while with pride. Draco started smiling, too, proud about the compliment.
"There are pirates with only one eye? And they fight? Just like you?"
It took me some time, but finally some update! I hope you enjoy, I'll continue soon, now that I have more time again!
"I had a dream about an angel... he was wearing something I could not put into words so I tried and put it into a suit.", there was a short pause. "It actually should be your size.", he mumbled, taking the mannequin into a small changing room. "Come I'll help you put it on."
The Healer rolled his eyes, placing a featherly kiss on Draco's knuckles. It was so soft, the blonde seemed at a loss for words for a second. At least the tears were gone by now. Harry used the silence to run his fingers a little longer over Draco's cheeks and bottom lip, not realizing Draco was starring at him. Not really a surprise, but Harry got incredibly lost in the other's face, appreciating every little feature and scar on it, marking what he endured. Draco parted his lips, catching Harry's finger between them, finally causing the younger to look at him with wide eyes.
Shortly after, Harry swung his leg over the monster of a motorcycle, his one hand starting the engine while the other was held out to Draco. "Come on, no need to be afraid."
"Oh how very thoughtful of you, young man!", her eyes lit up as she grabbed the flowers and buried her nose in them. "Daffodils and handmade pralines. I believe that's reason enough for you to call me Narcissa, don't you think?"
"Actually, I spoke to Kingsley as well. Might have interrupted some important meeting. Now, less talking, more action Ron. You love action. Go do your Auror stuff so I can make my Healer stuff.", Harry demanded, eyes filling with venom as the guy started smiling at him.
in a cell. I was surprised he was still bloody breathing. The guard broke his ribs and all in all he abused Draco with everything in him. That bloody son of a bitch thought he could get away with it because nobody cared. But I care. God I will rip this guy into pieces!"
All men in the room nodded and took a seat, looking mildly interested. Harry was not one to insult people, so the fact that he actually thought of somebody as a bastard, caused them to believe that there must have been something incredibly bad going on.
Sometimes, Harry really hated the observations of his coworker. She never stopped to think two seconds about what her words could mean for someone else, or maybe she did and just didn't care. It wouldn't surprise him in the slightest.
"I believe you oversaw the memo of a heterosexual date, Harry.", he mumbled, drawing nearer to the other man in discomfort of the shocked, disgusted and hungry stares they received.
A small surprised laugh escaped Draco, though he leaned in closer to his new found source of safety. "Elegant and posh. Quite suits a dragon, doesn't it?", Draco mumbled, opening one of the small glass bottles with nail polish in them. He chose a silver to suit the decor of Harry's Christmas tree and painted his nails quite fast and neatly for that pace. Satisfied, Draco blew at them and elegantly closed the bottle again. Harry caught his lip in beneath his teeth, eyeing Draco hungrily.
fighting the darkest wizard of our time I've seen everything there is. But I guess you taught me otherwise. What you survived is unbelievable, Draco.", he whispered, rolling the long fine strands of the other's hair around his finger. Draco shifted besides him, eyes looking far away and body still stiff. He didn't give any other reaction
Harry gave a curt nod before following the two men, still followed by this horrific creature. There was a long silence until they reached the fifth negative level.
Mister Rich Guy apparently caught up on Draco's fear, therefore he immediately drove to the side and stopped the car. He turned around in his seat and looked straight into Draco'a eyes. "Hey, no need to be afraid. I want to take you to my house a little outside of London. I don't want to hurt you. You will have a room there and you can make whatever you want until the storm is over. You can have some of my clothes so you won't have to be in those you have on. Please, just... let me take care of you for a few days.", the guy ended, a soft expression in his beautiful eyes. Still, the explanation caught Draco off guard. People never were friendly to him, just for the sake of being friendly. Lord, men never even fucked him anywhere except for lonely street corners, or hotel rooms if they were generous. But a guy letting him into his house? Letting him sleep there? For free? With clothes and food and all that? Just because... because what? Why on earth would he do that?
"So, what can I serve you with, little dragon?", she asked, wicked glint dancing across her eyes. She noticed Draco darting a glance towards Harry, who stood silently on their left side and watched what was happening. She also noticed his mouth watering at the pure sight of his favorite sweets. Her rich laugh filled the small room at his helpless gesture, something what surely reminded her of his first visit. "One of each once for you and once for your parents?", she asked then, the good natured smile never leaving her as Draco nodded thankfully.
"This will give you all the rights to perform healing magic in these halls. All other magic is shut down completely. The two gentleman will bring you to cell 50680. Prisoner 7516 knows about a healer visit... at least we hope he does. The cell is on the fifth negative level.", she explained neutrally, going back to her work an instant after finishing. There were goosebumps forming on Harry's arms for several reasons. First, calling someone by a number took their whole humanity away and he truly hated it not to know what the name of the prisoner was. He would ask him. There was no way he addressed anybody by a number. Second, the basement was full with those who were put in here to die, a life sentence to say the very least. There was no daylight touching the criminals down there, nothing of the outside world. Only darkness, coldness and silence. Third, probably half of the people imprisoned here, were caught because he won the war. He put them in here. All the Death Eaters, supporters of Voldemort and other dark wizards were here because of him. Huge possibility that said prisoner might hate his guts. Well, there was no turning back now.
"What's wrong darling?", he whispered, eyes filled with honest concern. Draco gave him a shaky smile.
The black haired male gave a lopsided smile. Then he looked at Malfoy with the softest eyes Tara ever saw. She saw the amount of emotions Harry felt about the other man, apart from being his healer. Emotions, far beyond from professional.
"Always better with you around Potter. Still no chance of getting that date I so desperately crave?", she asked, overdramatically reaching for her forehead as if she was about to faint. Both just chuckled at the question.
Muscle memory did most of the job when Harry moved the upper side of the bed so Malfoy was sitting upright and he accioed a paper bag, his brain was mostly in shock all the time. Panic attacks always got to Harry, the helplessness in people's eyes and knowing they couldn't stop it without help. The black haired male wondered how often Malfoy must have lived through these attacks until he passed out, all alone in the dark, nobody there to care.
Harry woke up at approximately 4 pm, the sun was standing high on the summer day. A sound of soft clicking, beak against glass, made Harry aware of the fact that he forgot to open his window for potential owl-visitors. So the raven-haired man quickly jumped over to his window and let the exhausted and seemingly pretty annoyed brown owl into his room. She threw the letter on the nearest table, before hopping to the sink and looking at Harry with hate in her eyes. The young wizard only rolled his eyes and filled a small bowl with water, which the owl quickly drank from. Afterwards, she left as quickly as she probably came, not even looking back.
"Can... can we forget the conversation? For now?", Harry stammered, looking anywhere but back at Draco. For a moment, he thought the blond didn't hear him, until slowly, very, very slowly he nodded. But instead of of relaxing, he pushed the blanket away from Harry's hip and squinted his eyes, as if searching for the hard-on Tara talked about. Even though the blush on Harry's cheeks immediately increased, nothing was there. The situation must have caused any thought about their proximity to shut off completely.
As fast as Harry's reflexes allowed, he tightened his grip on Draco, all the sounds rushing into his ears like a wave crushing down on him, kicking his headache off again. With his free hand Harry carefully caught those of Draco, not having a problem to hold his thin wrists both in his big hand. He could feel Draco's heartbeat and breathing against his chest, both so fast he was sure the man had another panic attack.
A snort left the woman's lips, typically a gigantic bloody red flag for anything she says next.
"Alright then I ask some questions before I start the healing process. Do you want some water?"
Tara smiled sympathetically at her coworker. Potter was always the savior of everyone. And she loved the side of him, which always tried to please everyone and save even the darkest soul from pain. Once there was a very old wizard, a true homophobic, who screamed at Harry, because he didn't want to be healed by a 'faggot'. The Chosen One just smiled at the other and managed to heal some pain in his back, something nobody else managed until then. Even though he had harder circumstances by a completely uncooperative patient, he did it. The man never even wanted to let him go after. They wrote each other every Christmas, even now. Of course this big heart would be able to include a broken Draco Malfoy without second thoughts.
Here we go, another chapter out! Honestly, I have to admit I don't really follow a plan in this story. Ideas just come to my mind rather randomly and I write them down, so please forgive my unstructured type of writing XD. I hope the publication date now works, thanks again for the tip! Hope you enjoyed!
A small snort escaped Draco. "Seriously? Me? Making you nervous? That's bullshit."
Dozens of feelings mixed in his chest all at once. Extreme worry, Malfoy was practically dead and in no condition to live without help. Then fear, Malfoy could die like this and he probably would. Afterwards shock, Draco bloody Malfoy was sitting in front of him, unable to move and obviously completely broken. But most prominent of all, anger. Anger at the Ministry, anger at the wards, anger at the wizarding world for treating prisoners like literal shit, taking their right to live like it belonged to them! Harry would seriously storm more than one office after this encounter, but for now he had to help Malfoy.
"Oh good lord, Lucius did a great job with you, didn't he? Please, call me Lily. But, you believe you are good enough for my baby?", she asked, her fine reddish eyebrow raised to her hairline.
Not to throw praise on anyone, but Harry was indeed the winner of last years relaxation award in the hospital. They had a very old, very grumpy witch living here with them, because she was too old to live alone and too picky with her caretaker. So they started a challenge three years ago, of course with consent of the women. They would take weekly turns on caring for the women and whoever made her feel best was awarded with mentioned title. Harry won the award first time participating and was actually pretty proud of this achievement, because the grumpy witch named Helena actually liked him.
A small hand tucked at his, ending his train of thoughts. The small boy looked up at him with his mesmerizing eyes, cold as ice and at the same time soft as cotton.
A knock on the door gave the two friends a reason to look up from their conversation, one being obviously happier about it than the other. Harry looked to the simple white door, expecting Tara to come in and whip his ass for ending as her patient. Scary imagination.
The other smiled gently, playing with one of the strands hanging loosely into his lover's eyes. "Be my boyfriend. My official boyfriend.", Harry asked, his voice filled with honesty and certitude.
A black Mercedes then drove through the lonely streets, slowly as the driver was currently talking on his phone. The guy looked rather annoyed, black eyebrows furrowed, hiding the eyes of a rather handsome young man from Draco's view. Even though rich male guys definently stood high on the customer list, the guy was quite too young to take advantage of Draco's services. Against the blonde's expectations, the black haired male eyed him closely as soon as he looked up from his phone. His plump pink lips formed a straight line, before he hung up on whoever he talked to. The black car moved to the side where Draco stood, window rolling down slowly. Draco would have hugged and probably broken his rules to kiss the guy in the car, just to make clear how much he probably saved his ass from a rather frightening death. Instead, Draco smirked at the guy in the car, leaning against a streetlamp to give off a sexier impression.
After just fully ten minutes of break Potter rushed to the room of his next patient, the little boy with hurting wrists. The name on the parchment read 'Michael Rave', so he opened the door with his greatest smile and a soft 'Good evening, family Rave'. The parents of the boy looked up at him quickly, two men as Harry recognized. They were holding each other's hand, worry glimmering in their eyes over their son. The boy on the other hand was sitting upright on the bed, rubbing his wrists unconsciously, while looking up to Harry eagerly. Harry always loved it when he saw gay couples, for some reason he felt a huge amount of sympathy to them. All the things they probably had to go through, just for being able to love who they wanted. And seeing them here with a kid, bright as ever, genuinely made him smile.
One blink again.
"Guess I did?", he answered. Draco was about to fire at Harry that he needed new glasses, when they were interrupted by the ringing of Harry's cellphone. The raven cursed under his breath and shot an apologetic smile at Draco before answering the call. The mien of the smaller man fell immediately, his brows furrowed in an annoyed expression.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy, the one and only.", Harry huffed.
Of course Draco was fluent enough in French to understand Harry said just that, additionally calling Draco 'a very magnificent guy', which lead the blonde to believe his opponent was, indeed, as gay as he would entitle himself. Lord have mercy.
Silence filled the room, Draco not being able to answer and Harry not knowing what to say. The situation was weird. In their old days, Malfoy would have come up with some clever retort about him not even being afraid and all that. Times had really changed. Years ago, Harry would have rather died than letting Malfoy know he was afraid. But now, telling Draco about his fears and problems in general didn't sound too bad. Maybe the other would be a little comforted by it.
The blonde pushed away from the car and towards the door, causing the other man to smile in delight. Harry moved to the door to open it for Draco like a true Gentleman would. The action caused Draco to shake his head with a smile, but being met with the warmth of the interior and the soft smell of orange and cinnamon, his retort melted into a relaxed sigh. His arms dropped to his sides, exposing his bare chest to the warmth. Knowing the sensitivity of his pale skin complexion, red dots would soon cover his body when adjusting to the heat. But honestly, Draco didn't care too much about his looks in that moment. His silver eyes wandered around the hallway, noticing paintings along the walls and heavy coats on a wardrobe to his right. The hallway ended in something Draco could only call a reading room, for it wasn't really a living room, despite having similarities. A red reading couch stood in the middle of the room with big bookshelves along the walls. A cold fireplace sat inviting between the shelves. More of the house wasn't really to be seen from where Draco stood, so he turned to Harry, only to find him smiling shyly at the floor. The blonde cocked an eyebrow, smirking at the other.
The black haired barely finished his thought, when a muffled sob reached his ears. The sound was coming from a cabinet, a large black cabinet on the right side of the door. Worry immediately crossed Harry's mind, his heart aching at the thought of being responsible for the crying. A child wasn't supposed to be involved in all of this! As quickly as he managed, Harry stumbled over to the cabinet and slowly opened it, just to be faced with a small blond boy, a little younger than himself. He hid his face in his hands, knees drawn up to his chest. He was crying violently by now, sobs shaking his small frame. He tried to move back further, fear gripping his mind, but there was nowhere to escape. Immediately Harry faced tears in his eyes as well, but still he slowly crouched down in front of the boy.
The woman laughed lightly at her son's comment, a long fingered hand caressing the pale cheek. "So am I. Though I believe you are old enough to wander around a bit by yourself. Your father and I decided on taking a stroll down the Seine, a little time for ourselves.", her melodic voice trailed off at the end, a shimmer taking over her eyes.
With that, Narcissa turned and placed a small kiss to Lucius' cheek, a wicked glint in her eyes. "Either smile or help me find a vase and let the poor boys go on their date.", she ordered sternly, her chin held high as she met his unforgiving stare for several moments. Without another word, he nodded and followed his wife inside, shooting Draco not more than a warning glance. It wasn't the support mother had given him, but Draco knew well it was everything his father was able to. And he was thankful for him to just let it slide without another comment. Taking another deep breath, Draco stepped fully out the door and closed it behind himself, taking a moment until he met Harry's eyes. The other was shooting him a worried glance, though he saw amusement hidden behind the obvious.
The Head Auror's lips twitched into an involuntary smile, though he still wrote the address on a small piece of parchment with a quill on Kingsley's table. Afterwards, he slid it over to where Harry sat, giving the man a curt nod. Harry had the unspoken allowance to do whatever he wanted to that guy. Maybe he should ask to get that written down somewhere, just in case he choked the guy to death on accident. Not on accident. Cut that. Completely on purpose.
Draco let out a small snort at the explanation, an unbelieving bitter smile on his face.
"I swear to Merlin, you will pay this freaking door!", Hermione yelled, blowing the white door up with a spell Harry couldn't decipher. Of course he couldn't, after all the explosion was loud enough to blow his head off, so bloody strong did the headache get through her action. Draco, meanwhile, got so surprised he bit down on Harry's finger and caused the younger to yelp at the sharp pain. Both their heads whipped around to see a furious Hermione storming into the room, being met with two sets of raging eyes, one as green as the woods and the other silver as mercury. Quickly enough, those two intense stares backed off, since Mione's hand came flying down right on Harry's cheek, producing a loud slap and a flicker of respect combined with fear in Draco's eyes. The Raven, on the other hand, rubbed his cheek with a stubborn glare, looking like a child being scolded by their mother.
Instead of looking offended, Malfoy merely nodded and moved up into an upright sitting position, head cocked slightly at Harry. The raven haired shook his head with a smile, kneeling next to Malfoy to be in a better position for his mission. Harry carefully rubbed some of the body wash they kept in the hospital between his hands, before starting at stroking slowly over Malfoy's arms. As Malfoy was probably hurting all over his body, Harry used the opportunity to give the ex-prisoner a gentle massage, pressing his fingers slightly into the few muscles left on the fragile body between his hands. The Slytherin didn't seem to mind at all, in fact, he closed his eyes again and just relaxed into the touch. That was until Harry reached the blonde's chest, where he slightly flinched and moved away from Harry. The black haired had only felt the hardness of ribs beneath his hands, enough to get an idea why Malfoy was so afraid. Option one, those broken ribs hurt again, option two, he was ashamed of the rest of his body. Harry couldn't really blame him, probably everyone would react this way.
It had been a while since Draco last visited Paris with his parents. During his final years at Hogwarts, school work kept him from all vacations and practically any activity but studying in his little office, just one door from his bedroom, every time he came home for holidays. Being at school it had been even worse. But now that his NEWTs were finished and excelled with the highest of honors, Narcissa and Lucius quite literally dragged him to the local Portkey office and off they were to a vacation in Paris.
"Don't you worry Harry. You care so much about everyone. Malfoy will be just fine with you as his healer. You didn't get that award for 'Best Healer Of The Year' for nothing.", she smiled softly, ruffling the messy black hair on his head. How soft these curls were and how incredibly unlucky that no woman could ever claim them as theirs.
weight: 64,2 lbs (29,1 kg);
A chuckle escaped Draco's lips. "I can imagine worse than having fancy dinner with a date and talking about work. Sounds like holiday."
"Oh sweet bloody shit! I forgot about Teddy!", Draco shouted, hand clasped over his mouth and fear roaming through his facial expression. Harry immediately grabbed the blonde's other hand, serious mien on his face.
"Oui, you zhould go, chérie. You look like a zomb."
Harry was sure Draco's throat must hurt like shit, not to mention his ribs after being held as tight as Harry had, but without even wincing Draco gulped down the can of soup, a dreamy look on his face. Sure, he hasn't eaten something tasty, anything barely, for the past few months or years, but the way he gulped down the soup and smiled at Ron as if he has been given the greatest gift of all time, Harry almost felt as if the situation was something normal.
At these words the boy sniffed and shifted slightly, looking at Harry with an unsure expression, but eventually he spoke. "Draco."
"Your son has a very mild form of arthritis. As you may know, this illness normally appears for older people, but there are many cases of children developing it, too. There are very good therapies to keep it almost invisible. Personally, I would recommend Muggle medicine as it shows higher success than potions and it's way cheaper. I will give you a list of medicine and therapists, along with pain relieve potion for today.", Harry explained and made a note, which he would bring to the Potions-Departement of the hospital. Michael looked at his parents with a smile on his face.
"That I see.", Draco commented dryly, causing Harry to laugh beautifully.
fighting a smile, which Harry gladly accepted as a win.
"Floor 12, Minister of Magic.", the small voice announced.
There was deadly silence in the room. Most of the people here were young healers, way too young to put themselves through so much dark energy. They would completely break at the weight of this place, of it's way to get under your skin and hunt you to the day you die. So there was not much thinking before Harry eventually shoved himself through the other healers to the front. He fought the darkest wizard of all time, died and came back to life, faced dementors multiple times and faced death as a baby. Nobody else would be better for this job than him.
"Oh Mione... I didn't mean to scare you.", he sighed, taking Hermione's hands into his."Draco had a panic attack and I thought it better to keep you out of the room. For his safety and all. It wasn't supposed to make you worry.", he whispered, pulling his old friend into his arms. The woman hugged him back, burying her face in the Healer's neck, leaving a few wet spots. She did not stay in the hug for more than a few seconds though. She quickly recovered and took a step back, back of her hand wiping away the stains of her tears. Hermione has always been a tough one, but Harry internally guessed she could really use a longer hug for her worry being that big. Nevertheless, it was her decision.
As soon as Ron stepped to the window and nodded at Harry, the Healer started to relax and move his gaze away from the window and to Draco. Who, of course, still hasn't moved in the slightest, only furrowed his brows and stared at Harry's profile. Well, now he looked straight into Harry's eyes, with an intensity which brought the blush back onto Harry's cheeks.
The police officers, Weasley and Parkinson, looked at each other and nodded. "Sounds about right. The little demon told us the same thing.", Weasley answered with a wave of his hand towards the car they came with. Soon enough, a ten year old boy ran towards Draco, a big grin on his young face. The relief on Draco's face was unmistakable as he pulled the young man into a tight hug, a growing smile playing on his lips.
"We had a moment Hermione! Let us be, for fucks sake!", he complained, gesturing between him and his patient before crossing his arms over his chest.
Soon enough, the police arrived and took Nott with them. Someone at the party must have called them when the fighting started. They asked Harry and Draco a whole lot of questions, when Draco's heart sank to his feet at a certain point of his explanation. Why did he say he'd leave?
"Lucius, the boy is not stupid. Pirates fight all the time with only one eye. Don't treat him like a lost cause only because he isn't considered normal.", Harry responded, voice soothing as silk. Draco looked up at him with wonder in his left eye.
Mister Johnson gave him a smile and nod, before handing Draco a glass with champagne. "I guess that's a deal then, Mister Malfoy. Glad to be working with you."
With a smile plastered to his flawless face, the young man jogged out of the alleyway and onto the busy streets he grew so fond of in his childhood. They were narrow and packed to the top with shoppers and tourists, but he knew exactly most people ignored the smaller alleys with the true Parisian bakerys and designers. So with excitement filling his moves, the blond man pushed through the crowd and into a rather deserted street. It was only enough for two people to walk side by side, but being alone now he didn't care as much as he did as a kid. Back then, his father had to push him in front of them, a thing Draco detested with him being a rather shy five year old. But remembering the bakery his parents took him to, a very small place owned by a woman which had his whole life looked like a hundred and ten, the memories got pushed to the side.
"Gods that was cute! Come on lads, dinner is getting cold in here and it smells too good to eat it like that!", the man announced, his big brown eyes gleaming in the low sun. Apparently, the red haired woman wasn't as hyperactive as her husband, though she did throw the boys a satisfied smirk.
With that, Draco hurried out of the bakery into the small alleyway, relieved to draw some fresh breaths after the thick tension inside the room. Even if it was a rather pleasant tension. Now there was a thing left. He had to get new things to dress. Of course, there were a lot of fine clothes in his wardrobe, but nothing which suited for a date. Reason enough for the young blonde to run down the streets, up to a small shop in a wizard part of Paris. Of course not before fetching Dobby a gift card with the Eiffel Tower on it. The beautiful designer clothes in the shop were made by nobody else than Madame Zabini, mother of his childhood best friend and his second mother. The woman would be thrilled to know Draco had a date for the day.
Work in St. Mungo's was ever so often exhausting and extremely tiering. Auror's bulging in with life threatening injuries, even years after the war this phenomenon wouldn't stop. Kids played pranks on their friends with horrific endings, bleeding wounds and unconscious boys or girls were part of the daily routine. After the trend of a new kind of love potion, invented by none other than George Weasley himself, the rate of parents with lovestruck children has increased drastically. The scent of different potions and even some sort of Muggle disinfectant filled the air of the bright halls, sweeping through the doors filled with recovering and fighting patients. And in the middle of it all was Harry, standing in his light blue robes with a clipboard in his hands, a pen tucked behind his ear and a cup of coffee currently meeting his lips. The shift was already too long, ten or twelve hours maybe and he craved for some sleep. But it was summer, meaning first that all the children were home with their parents, creating more accidents that were treated by St. Mungo's, instead of the schools Infirmary. Second of all, the healers with family took some weeks off to spend them at home, leaving the single-healers at only half of the staff. More patients and less healers meant working overtime almost every day of the week. Harry, being the ever so caring person he was, worked seven days a week, fifteen hours everyday.
Nott grabbed Draco by the back of his hair, slowly pushing him towards the exit. Something about the whole situation made Draco think of the horrible irony all of this held. For the first time in his life Draco felt like he was worth something. He was asked to model. Seconds after, the little bubble of a dream he was in got bursted by his past. Draco closed his eyes to the tears dreading to fall down his cheeks, when a warm hand curled around his waist and pulled him towards a strong body.
With his head held high the healer entered the horrifying building. There was a glimmer in his eyes, a glimmer only war veterans had upon facing yet another danger. After passing through a dark entry hall, enlighted by candles on the walls and a larger dirty chandelier hanging from the ceiling, Harry found himself at a reception. An old woman with silver hair and very prominent cheekbones looked up at the presence. She had the same dead eyes as the two Ministry blokes, soulless might be the best word for the expression. The healer couldn't imagine why anyone would work here without being forced to. The place was death itself. Without greeting or a smile, not like the receptionist at the hospital, who greeted everybody with a bright smile and polite welcome, the woman handed him a permission and a little bracelet made out of green wool. There was a little metallic pendant hanging from it with the symbol of healers.
"But it's Chriiistmas old man!"
"You're a bloody weird rich guy."
In a comfortable silence, Draco started with the smallest of the gifts, pulling away the tape carefully and gently removing the small silver ribbon. Beneath was a small black box with two C's on it, something Draco felt like he should recognize, but for the sake of it being midnight, he didn't. Inside the box was a simple silver necklace with a dragon on it, reflecting the light of the candles to make it look like the dragon was on fire.
"I would dare to say they are even better. Many of us use eye patches. They simulate darkness for one eye to be able to fight in darkness, but a lot of pirates are blind or partly blind."
"Don't kill them yet, Wormtail. The Captain wants them on deck alive. But a little bit of torture is never wrong.", he explained calmly, eyeing the Lord with a mischievous grin on his lips. In the darkness he could barely make out the bobbing Adam's apple of the man, while he lifted his hands to his head, admitting defeat. For the blink of an eye, the starling silver eyes of Mr. Malfoy moved to a closed door, but shot right back to Pettigrew, who was slowly drawing closer. All while the pirate slowly cut deeply into the other man's skin, Harry walked over to the door Lucius looked at before. Immediately the Lord tensed, hand twitching in Harry's direction. Something important was behind that door, and Harry was desperate to find out just what it was. But he waited another few minutes, for other pirates filling the room. He stayed to look out for Mrs. Malfoy, right beside her bed, waiting for her to wake up. Would he have left before, maybe the woman would have woken up and tried something stupid. So only when she woke up and other crewmembers held her at gun- or rather sword- point, Harry moved to the door. His crewmembers were by now laughing loudly at the couple, insulting them and some threats were leaving their lips. Some were even saying dirty things to Mrs. Malfoy, but Harry didn't worry so much about it.
"How... did you know I liked that stuff?", he asked in a whisper. The look of relief on Harry's face made Draco realize that he didn't. Harry didn't know he liked it, he just assumed it? Or he liked it himself?
There was a sparkle coming from Malfoy's eyes, something that immediately reminded Harry of Quidditch. The former Slytherin always has held this exact sparkle in his eyes, when he has been determined on winning against Gryffindor, chin raised high into the air. The smile creeping onto Harry's lips was nothing but triumph. If this sparkle was still there, then Malfoy was not completely gone. He wasn't broken. With that thought in mind, Harry cocked his head to the right side, challenge written all over his face. He almost forgot how to get under his nemesis' skin, but now he remembered. Malfoy needed the thrill, needed the picking.
"Where is the lantern?! And why are you standing over there like someone might break out?! Make yourself useful and give me some parchment. Owl St. Mungo's that I am bringing over a patient and they have to prepare a single room with bathroom, wheelchair approved and stationary. Now.", he demanded, fury dripping from his words as he was ripping the parchment out of the other man's hand. The friendly Harry was gone in a matter of seconds. There was only one thing he cared about right now. Getting Malfoy to St. Mungo's and finding out what exactly was wrong with his classmate.
"Malfoy? How did Malfoy do that? He still has his posh ass placed in Azkaban, hasn't he?"
"Let me soothe the pain from your throat first. I don't want you to live through more of this than needed.", he explained quickly and laid his wand to the side. After seconds of hesitation, Harry placed his big rough hands on the prisoner's throat, almost like this one time back in school, where he choked Malfoy for saying shit about his parents. But this touch was gentle, careful to not hurt his patient. The blond man flinched at the touch, but as soon as he felt the soothing warmth of healing magic coming from those strong hands, he relaxed into it with a look of pure pleasure in his eyes. Harry chuckled at the sight of Malfoy gaping at this strange touch, looking much like a moaning mess being choked by somebody for a completely different reason.
"I didn't oversee anything. I just normally don't come to events like this with male company. Even though I am very much gay. Made it easier to keep it professional. But I stopped caring when I met you today. So, bear with me through this evening?"
The disgusted look on both of their faces made the crew and Harry chuckle deeply, but Sirius interrupted them by stepping away, allowing the group to walk over a small wooden plank onto the ship. Draco held onto Harry's hand with great fear, all the while big steady waves crashed against the bottom of the wet wood.
"Oh, come on Tara, do fuck off. Be so kind and not talk about any boners at my workplace.", he demanded, voice wavering and cheeks flaming red. His coworker started laughing like some sort of hyena, happy to make her
"Holy... shit Malfoy. These bloody bastards... don't look at me like I never swore in front of you. Merlin, you look like Death himself.", he whispered, carefully moving one blond strand behind Malfoy's ear with tears in his eyes. "I will help you alright? This nightmare is over, once and for all. You will never be alone like this again." Of course Malfoy was his former enemy, they hated each other back in school, but Potter already forgave his classmate for everything he had done. The boy had no other choice... and he clearly didn't deserve this just because he tried to survive. He never even deserved to be locked up in Azkaban, Harry knew that.
The look on Draco's face was that of a fangirl first meeting her idol, the amount of pure shock and disbelief was almost comical. Never in his life was Draco so sure he did not deserve what was offered to him. "You can't be serious Harry! That's something a model would wear on the red fucking carpet! I'll ruin it!"
"Well yes... I worked 24 hours straight. If you need anything call for Healer Boujettif. She is a great Healer and has my full trust."
"Don't you talk against me, young man. Without you I would have had to close this place. Young people just won't go into the simple jobs anymore and those who do, just aren't as passionate.", she turned back to Draco, her eyes filled with warmth. "Harry started helping me out with only ten years. His parents are regulars here and he always wanted to learn how to bake from me. They wanted him to finish the Beauxbatons first before getting to work, but still he managed to work here all the hours he hasn't been at school. And after finishing a month ago he came to work here full time as my apprentice.", she moved closer to Draco, a smile plastered to her chastened lips. "A hand for fine things the man has. You two would do great on a date, if I may say so."
"Only sometimes! Harry, is my food that bad?"
"Please explain me your reason to do all this. Do I owe you something afterwards? Clean your house? Take someone out?", the blonde asked, fine eyebrow raised at the other male.
"I trried 'eeping 'im in ze room, but 'e almost crawled out of ze bed.", Angela explained, pushing Draco to the side of Harry's bed. Hermione, who sat on Harry's other side, covered her mouth with one hand and visibly fought to keep her composure.
"I always keep my promises.", the black haired man answered, a suppressed grin building on his features as he pulled Draco closer and finally connected their lips. The blond felt as if heaven was coming upon him, rough chapped lips engulfed his own while hard stubble probably left red marks on his chin and cheeks. Strong hands pulled him close to a strong chest, while his own hands were clumsily finding their way into thick strands of black hair. Both of them surely needed practice in kissing and it wouldn't be the best kiss they ever shared with each other. But right for this moment, everything was perfect. The whole world stood still, everyone was just staring at the pair. They parted with a smile, looking into each other's eyes.
"I don't think I can sleep tonight after seeing this... who is he?", she whispered, stepping closer with frightened eyes. Something about this terrifying figure felt familiar, but she couldn't pinpoint what it was.
As soon as Harry opened his eyes, he realized he saw absolutely nothing. The room was pitch black, the light from the hallway didn't even make it's way over the doorstep. With somewhat shaky hands the healer pulled out his wand and whispered a quiet 'Lumos'. Quiet, because he didn't want to scare whoever was in here even more than they must have already had and only a dim Lumos to not hurt the prisoners eyes. Curiosity got the best of Harry as soon as he stepped into the cell. He looked around in search of something in the room, but his eyes had to adjust to the darkness for a while. So he just held out his wand and smiled softly.
Draco choked out a sob at the confession, tears flowing freely over his cheeks by now and arms slung tight around his own body. Harry didn't hesitate a second before he pulled Draco into a tight hug, running his hands through the platinum blond strands of the taller male. Even though he was smaller, he was broader than Draco and gave him an undeniable feeling of comfort. His head was leaning on the other's shoulder, tears wetting the suit that was probably more expensive than anything Draco earned in his whole life.
After stepping through the floo, Harry sank on his armchair with a content sigh. His boss, Reiman, would definitely send an owl for him. The grumpy man in his midlife-crysis was extremely sensible when it came to skipping a work day, but looking at the fact that Harry worked two shifts after another, he couldn't really do anything about it. Especially not with Tara there to talk him down. So, after all, Harry was able to get a nice night of sleep. Well, rather a nice day of sleep.
The idea of a barely warm room with blankets and something against that fucking wind caused a visible shiver to run down Draco's spine. He should be happy if he survived the upcoming storm. The rest was only wishful thinking.
a little drawn to the other male... only a little.
A sigh escaped Draco's lips as he moved the wild strands of hair out of the boys face. "I'm glad you ran away. I have no idea what we'll do now, but that's another problem."
"Prisoner 7516 had a life sentence, but recent investigations have shown that he didn't commit a murder which caused the hard punishment. The rest of his crimes are cleared off by five years in here. Has been a long time since someone got out of this hellhole.", the shorter one explained slowly. There was something like guilt in his voice and terrifying seriousness at the last expression. Hellhole, yeah that's a pretty good description of this place.
Harry started the water on a lukewarm temperature, not too hot to hurt the sore spots on Malfoy's skin, but hot enough to provide promised warmth. His former school nemesis eyed his actions curiously, but mostly dumbstruck. There was a sick feeling in Harry's stomach, giving him reasons to believe that Malfoy was never actually cared for. Surely Narcissa never really bathed Malfoy as a kid, maybe a house elve did? So maybe he expected a mediwitch to help. Or maybe Malfoy didn't expect him to be so caring at all? They weren't friends after all and Harry, if were in Malfoy's situation, wouldn't believe his school rival would give two shits about him. The answer had to wait, eventually, maybe until Malfoy was able to speak properly again. What a terrible long wait for so urgent questions.
"Thank you, Tilius. Please restrain from staring Healer Potter down like that. I am quite sure he has enough people goggling at him on a daily basis."
The tears running down Draco's cheeks probably reflected the same emotions, though they caused worry in Harry and his loving oh so perfect eyes.
these people?"
Immediately did not only suddenly the dog turn into a fully grown man, but another man sprinted down the stairs, face one of fury as the shape-shifting guy cried out and stumbled out. "You'll pay for that, Prongs!", the man screamed over his shoulder, quickly making turns to escape the other man.
Anger flashed through Draco's eyes, his hand almost automatically moved to the door handle to open it. Until he realized they were on the bloody motorway, nowhere near a hotel!
"You'll have to give me something to dress in.", Draco answered when his coughing subdued. He had to throw his hair back into place, for it having gotten out of control through his choking. The smile on Harry's face was so bright it might have blinded Draco if he wasn't fast enough to look away. The shorter male grabbed Draco by the hand, pulling him to his bedroom in the first floor. To Draco's surprise, the room wasn't only a bedroom. A big bench stood on the left side of the room, draped with all sorts of fabric and a mannequin standing to the right of it. The mannequin had the probably most beautiful suit on Draco has ever seen. It was made out of silvery fabric, soft and mat. The shirt beneath looked like white silk and the tie shone in the same silver as the suit. What Draco didn't see on his first glance, but definitely on his second, was the beautiful hand-embroidered corset, which was covering the shirt and only shone slightly through the holes of the buttons.
"No worries, Malfoy. Does it still hurt?"
"Draco?", Harry whispered, his lips only inches from the other man's, startling eyes looked at him and causing the blond to stop breathing.
The Healer closed his eyes to suppress the rage and magic still burning through his veins. Truly, he didn't feel any of this since shortly after the war.
It took exactly one hour, 54 minutes and 47 seconds for Draco to calm down. Harry knew, because he started counting with the older one as a distraction to get Draco's mind back to normal. After fifteen minutes, Harry thought he was talking to thin air, until he realized Draco was squeezing his hand a little bit with every number, signaling Harry that he counted with him. Somehow, the whole situation felt incredibly intimate. Having Draco in his arms, with the intention of calming him down from a panic attack, chest fully against his back, low whispers ordering him to do this and that. When Draco's heartbeat slowly got back to normal, almost beating in union with Harry's, there were no more sounds than silent sobbing and the frantic calls of Hermione outside the door. Second Harry pointedly ignored, caring more about Draco's wellbeing than anything his friend might want to ask.
The man nodded eagerly, his lose strands bouncing wildly as he did so. He turned his head towards the kitchen to call for her. "Marie! Il y a un type très magnifique ici qui voudrait te voir!", he turned back to Draco, a bright smile on his lips. "I told 'er zere is someone to see 'er."
Reality hit Harry like the knight bus. Draco was afraid. He was afraid of something he was
"Pray tell, are you a model, by chance, Mister Malfoy?"
Draco only snorted in response, leaving his mother to pat him on the cheek as he pouted and stepping away afterwards. They threw each other a smile once again, before Narcissa eventually left her son's room with a very soft 'click' of the door. The silver eyes of the blond searched the Eiffel Tower in the far distance for another long moment, before eventually he walked back into his room and to his closet, where most of his clothes had already been arranged by their ever working house elves. Draco had to remember to give Dobby a little gift for his efforts to make everything so utterly perfect for them. Maybe he would find a small gift shop on his walk through Paris, the small elf loved to collect those gift cards from around the world.
The blonde drew closer to Harry, resting his head on the strong chest, his right hand spread out flat on the raven's left side, right above his heart. Harry was sure Draco must have felt his heart skip several beats. If he did, he didn't mention it. He just laid there, slowly drawing circles on Harry's chest, careful not to tickle Harry and he got lost in his own world, eyes zoning out.
"I can't heal them completely here, but I can release some pain so we can get you out of here. Is that alright?"
"Harry, my boy, it's good to see you. What do we owe the pleasure.", Kingsley began, patting Harry's shoulder with a kind smile. The man had developed some wrinkles of smiling over the past years, something that gave him a really kind look. His head was still completely shaved, his robes still all purple. He didn't change all that much. Harry did. He grew an inch.
The sound of hard heels clicking on the polished hardwood floor of his room made Draco look up to find his beautiful mother Narcissa striding over to him, elegant as ever. The small crows feet on either side of her grey eyes only underlined her fine aging, a woman as magnificent in older age as she had been as a girl. Draco couldn't help but tell her exactly that, how stunning she still looked in her forest green robes, her hair artfully draped over her shoulder. The responsive smile he received pushed the young man to his feet, his arms carefully moving around the slender frame of his mother.
Harry stepped out of the elevator, right into a meeting of the Minister, Head Auror Robards and some other Aurors Harry didn't know. They were apparently just about to get into the Minister's office, so Harry rushed to them as quickly as possible. He didn't intend on waiting hours to talk with Kingsley.
Narcissa moved slightly up on her toes to place a soft kiss to her son's forehead, a smile lingering on her lips. "Who knows, maybe you find yourself a date to walk along the Seine with as well. A nice french girl...", the blond threw her a horrified look, causing her to laugh in delight. "... or handsome french boy. You never allow me to finish, dragon!"
The blond closed his eyes, drawing in a deep breath of all the different smells, only to open his eyes to a door opening (from his experience Draco knew the door led directly to the kitchen). But to his utter surprise, it wasn't Madame Talouse stepping out, but a very young
"Ah, non. Ze day Marie dies I will be old enough to retire myself, je suis certain.", Harry answered, his eyes sparkling in amusement. "But I would be afraid aussie, if I 'ad to tell 'er to leave ze patisserie. I understand ze Death."
"The man hasn't talked for three years now. Some day he would stop walking around and just sat there, never moved... not even once. Not even to get his food or anything. Once every two weeks someone casts a cleaning charm on the prisoners. We only know he lives because his eyes move sometimes.", the smaller man explained, looking as if the person truly got on his nerves. Harry nodded in understatement, moving to the corner he started to see a figure in.
The crewmembers looked as if they wanted to contradict, but after openly thinking about their cooking skills, they shrugged and nodded.
Draco carefully tapped on Harry's arm, giving the Healer reason to look up. The older pointed his long, thin finger to something lying on the small nightstand next to Harry's side of the bed. After taking a closer look, the raven realized it was a hand mirror. Merlin, he wasn't sure if that was a good idea. In fact, he was sure it was absolutely stupid and not a bloody good idea at all.
The blonde snorted, swinging his own leg over, a lot less elegantly than Harry. "Afraid? In your dreams."
"I will cast a cleaning charm, warming charm and I will move the light close enough so I can see your face alright?", he whispered softly, already flicking his wand to perform mentioned spells. The poor man must be freezing and had to be more than uncomfortable, sitting in his own urine for probably over a week. What a horrible life...
"Is Ron already back?"
Harry started playing with Draco's hair again, scrunching his nose at the broken ends. As long as the Healer remembered, Malfoy has had impeccable hair. Seeing him with a mop of long, uncared for hair felt like a personal insult. "I think we should cut your hair tomorrow. It looks worse than mine. And that really has to say something."
"You spoke to Robards about it?! Fuck Harry, it's really that serious, huh?"
"There is exactly one person that ever wound me up like that.", a sigh left Harry's lips at the thought.
"Tara, I believe my personal life shouldn't be too much of a topic for you. Nevertheless, Draco knows he always strikes a certain nerve within me."
"That's what I thought. Maybe I can get you to the VIP section of the hospital, the food there is at least far better than down here.", he proposed, wiggling his eyebrows in anticipation. A strangled noise escaped Malfoy's mouth, followed by a snort. Though by his lightly shaking shoulders, Harry could make out that he was trying to laugh. But the loss of his voice was also keeping him from laughing with any sound, hence the weird sounds. But instead of taking pity on the poor boy, Harry just started on laughing loudly, deep from within his belly. He has always been a rather positive person and even though the depressing atmosphere of Azkaban shut it down momentarily, it couldn't keep him from being happy altogether. Even if it meant laughing at his patients dreadful attempts on laughing without use of his voice.
. Harry didn't realize before, that the blond wasn't even looking at him, but outside the window. Following Draco's eyes, Harry caught sight of a man, standing on the other side of the street in a flat. A shiver ran down Harry's spine at the coldness in the man's eyes, the pure hate and bloodlust.
The look of confusion was back on Draco'a face. "Did you just say
"I hate it. I feel like a teenage girl."
Alarm bells rang in Harry's ears, loud and clear. A small voice whispered the number of the room it came from. Immediately Harry recognized the number to be Malfoy's room, so he ran over to the table with the potion-vials standing on it, grabbed all of those for him and ran back to the room, robes swinging behind him so dramatically, Snape would have been jealous. Once the young healer reached the door, he opened it with his elbow, somehow forgetting the possibility of magic for a second. Inside Harry placed the potions on a small table on Malfoy's right, all the while eyeing his patient with worry. The vitals showed high blood pressure and high heart rate, combined with Malfoy's ragged breathing and wide eyes, the healer knew it must be a panic attack.
A snort left Harry's lips at the same second as Draco's, they almost shoved their middle finger into Ron's direction too. To Harry's luck, Draco seemingly understood his plan and played along, not looking to the door at all. As if he was talking to Malfoy instead of Ron, Harry started combing his fingers through the blond strands, untangling some knots and massaging his scalp. Meanwhile, he started talking to Ron without turning around.
"What, are you afraid to let everybody know what you are? A sweet little whore from the streets, the most worthless scum this earth ever came up with?", Nott drawled, causing a whisper to go through the mass of people. Draco wrapped his arms around himself, trying to hide from the whispers and stares he received, disgusted expressions on their faces and hateful messages. Tears formed once again in Draco's eyes, but before they managed to drop a strong voice came from besides him.
Nose broken and healed incorrectly, occasional nose bleeding;
Harry was now grabbing the pen behind his ear and wrote something on a parchment, a list of all therapists who knew how to treat arthritic patients and names of Muggle medicine as well as some potions, each with price and some places to get them. He was always concentrated at work, giving his very best to make a good impact on other people's life. Soon after he finished, Via handed him the pain relieving potion and bid him goodbye, a smile still spread across her face. Now she was the one humming the song of Potter when he arrived.
The silence following Harry's accusation could have been mistaken for the deadly silence a funeral usually held. The stares of the men were blank, each one in their own world of thoughts and imaginations. Kingsley was the first to make a sound, a clearing of throat, followed by a serious gaze into Robards' direction. The other man gave a small, distracted nod, before taking out his wand and casting a corporal Patronus. The silvery-blue silhouette of a Rottweiler soon ran off with a message of its' caster. Harry wasn't able to fully understand what message Robards sent off, but from what he understood, Robards sent for someone to bring him the logs of the guards positioned in Azkaban. The warm feeling of relief overcame Harry, soon enough causing his posture to slump and a breath he wasn't holding on purpose to leave his lungs. Kingsley stood up and walked around his desk to Harry, a guilty expression on his face.
"Dray. Dray, listen closely. You have to calm down. I know what you saw was scary, but I promise you we will fix it. I am here to help you through all of this, step by step.", he whispered into the man's ear, locking the door as he started hearing footsteps running down to them, most likely alarmed by the sudden noise of a breaking mirror. But Draco would only be more scared by more people. Harry could do nothing more than to wait. To wait and to feel utterly hopeless.

embarrassed. This would mean payback. Lucky for Harry, the woman left, giggling her whole way down the corridor.
"Shall I kiss your knuckles, princess, so you'll stop scowling at them.", Harry answered, voice wavering from the laugh he tried to keep in. Getting Malfoy's reaction was absolutely worth the trouble though, as the blonde smirked and quickly nodded his head yes, holding his hand out for Harry to kiss. Prat.
"So, how many did you find little rascal?"
"Alors, let's go eat somezing.", Harry whispered, hand grabbing Draco's once again before pulling the other inside and right into the kitchen. They both stumbled a little with light chuckles as Harry abruptly stilled, his eyes lighting at the sight of a big black dog.
Foul teeth with multiple infections;
The following small talk was rather uninteresting, Draco only understood half of the stuff they were saying, so he decided to look around the place and maybe the buffet. He whispered said plan into Harry's ear, who nodded with a caring smile. "Have fun, darling. We are at the big table when dinner begins.", he whispered back, squeezing Draco's side lovingly. A stupid grin formed on the blonde's lips as soon as he turned around. Maybe he
The women laughed very melodically, before waving him off with a soft gesture of her hand. " 'On't you worrie, 'ealer Potter. Draco 'nows 'e will be waked by moi. Juste bring moi to 'is room."
A small glance to the side showed Draco that Harry was giving him a gentle smile, encouraging the blonde through a wink and squeeze to the arm. To show his confidence once more, Harry moved his arm from where the two were linked to Draco's waist. He pulled the taller to his side possessivly, a playful glint in his eyes. The contact gave Draco the comfort he needed to hold his chin high and his hand on Harry's neck as they walked straight to Harry's boss. At least Draco assumed he was, as he was the oldest and most surrounded man on the party.
Maybe Draco was uncomfortable with their close proximity? Even though Harry thought they have already sorted that out, he tried and move away from Draco a few inches. After all, people's minds did change about stuff like that. He wouldn't be surprised if Malfoy was uncomfortable with him all of a sudden.
"You worked through the whole night Harry?"
Again, Draco smiled and leaned into Harry's side, looking beautifully shy. The young raven haired boy moved his arm around the blonde's shoulders, pulling him closer. Something felt as if it connected the boys right there, an invisible bond that grew stronger with each second Harry was close to the other boy. Harry buried his nose in the blonde locks of his friend, inhaling the clean scent of freshly washed hair. He hadn't smelled that for a while now. They stood in a dark corner of the room, away from anybody else, when reality finally hit Harry. He started liking the boy, in a way he never thought possible. Physically as well as mentally they were drawn to each other, not afraid of each others touch or anything for that matter. The other pirates were long forgotten, the discussion up on deck, too, as soon as Draco came closer to bury his face in Harry's chest. His clothes must have smelled horrible, but the younger boy seemingly didn't care. A small smile graced his pink lips and reflected the fair light of a lantern. Without hesitation Harry leaned forward and kissed the boy's forehead, before taking his hand again. Maybe, after all, he could find a reason to fight again.
His two best friends sitting in a room with Draco Malfoy, sharing their food with him, having a civil interaction, was something beyond Harry's imagination. Yet, he was sitting right in the middle of it and, honestly, couldn't complain about it, now that he started caring for Malfoy. He always had, Harry guessed, but not in the same way as now. Now, it felt as if Draco was the air Harry breathed, the only thing keeping him from drowning in a sea full of darkness. Maybe he did feel something similar in school, a certain energy pulling them together in the worst possible manner existing. But it always has been there. Now, stronger than ever before. And Harry didn't mind it. He didn't mind it at all.
He was right. Something has been wrong about the address of that guy. It was, in fact, right outside his fucking workplace. Maybe he even greeted this bastard on his way to work once. Maybe even right after he abused Draco like that. Merlin beware, this guy would die a bloody gruesome death.
Draco smiled with as much confidence as he could bring up, holding his hand out for the boss to take. "It's a pleasure meeting you, Sir."
Draco snorted, rather unclassy, as he tried to stifle another laughter, before he continued. "Oh he told my father the grey suit made him look like a blown up rhinoceros and with the hair he should try on my mother's dress, he would surely make a great figure in it."
His eyes flicked from Lucius' cold stare to Draco's warm glance right behind the man, seemingly relaxing as he took a visible breath. "Bonjour, Monsieur. Marie told me I could be meeting vous, alors I brought flowers and pralinés for Madame Malfoy, as a present.", he began, giving Narcissa reason to clasp her hands in delight and push through her son and husband to receive her gift.
"So he likes men?", Draco asked carefully, looking around in the dark room.
"I feel weird opening your gifts like that. You should open the next."
"Don't you worry Papa! Dad will never shut up if you start crying now.", he chuckled, hugging them tightly. "Thank you Monsieur Potter! Have a very nice day."
"He really was innocent, huh? Lucius' boy."
"My date. Come on Draco, you would save my ass. I need a date and that in less than two hours. You are the only possibility. I wouldn't feel bad to leave you back here alone and we could make some big people faint by going there together!", the excitement and mischief in Harry's voice caused a tiny little flutter in Draco's chest. He could go on a date with this really hot rich guy in front of all these rich bastards and finally feel worth something. He knew Harry would make him feel special. The raven definitely was a gentleman, a great guy in general. So, why not?
With care, the young healer casted a few diagnosing charms at Michael's wrists and then tapped his parchment once with his wand. Seconds after, words formed in black ink, describing whatever problem there was with the boy.
Not even as Madame Talouse limped back behind the counter and opened the display of sweets for Draco, his mind fully let go of that image. Though, he had to admit, the sweets did a great job at trying to distract. Only trying.
His answer walked into the room with full lunch boxes and several steaming drinks, all carefully balanced on his arms and hands. Why on earth he didn't use a simple spell was beyond Harry, but he surely forgot about his magical ability sometimes too. Hermione on the other hand didn't, as she quickly casted several
Upon arriving, the dementor opened several gates, all of them reaching double of Harry's height. Immediately Harry felt small, looking up to the gates of steel with a thick layer of black must on them. The young wizard grabbed his wand in a matter of defense, something he could rely on even though this place seemed to inject darkness into his veins. Darkness he couldn't fight with his wand.
A sigh sounded from the other side of the room, followed by clear 'Yes Sir'. Soon enough, the door opened and closed once again, signaling Ron has left. Tara on the other hand was still in the room, Harry could feel her piercing stare at the back of his head.
Being now awake and refreshed again, Harry intended on paying Shacklebolt a visit. His floo had a connection to the Ministry, so thankfully he didn't have to walk anywhere. The young Healer grabbed a hat to have at least something to hide behind, without dying from heat. Surely, even years after the war, his appearance at the Ministry would cause a lot of ruckus. And the hat might hide his still wet curls. At least a little bit. With a quick check that his wand was tucked at his belt, Harry took a deep breath and grabbed a handful of floo powder. He stepped into the flames and called out 'Ministry of Magic'. Harry excited the fireplace right out into a hallway with lots of floos, all gaining entrance to visitors. Reminded of an accident last year, where he stood in a fireplace too long and somebody flooed right into him, causing Harry to jump rather ungraceful out of the way, he quickly stepped out of the green flames and shook off some of the ash, before a similar event took place.
Merlin, his mind must not be working correctly anymore. Of course he crossed a line, Draco Malfoy didn't
give a needy sigh, his body pressing harder against Harry's, immediately receiving a response by hips rolling into his, pressing groins against one another. The blond groaned, his head falling down on a broad shoulder as his breathing catched up.
"Oh mon petit dragon! You have grown into such a stunning man! Come here, let me give you a proper hug!", she cried out in a much lesser accent, seeing as she had married an English man back in her twenties. Surely one hundred years ago that was.
"I'm-...I'm sorry. I-I... You... Merlin you sounded like a dying seagull.", Harry pressed out between breaths and more laughter. Malfoy gave him his best glare from school, but the heat was lurking and Harry couldn't help but flash his most charming grin at the blond, all white teeth and sparkling eyes.
Jaw broken and healed incorrectly, pain on left side;
Draco was quite sure there was a blush creeping down his neck and to the tips of his ears. He had never been on a date in his life, especially not with someone he found as attractive as Harry. Something else was hidden in that statement Draco was sure he should have deciphered first, but somehow the thought of himself walking down the Seine with Harry on his side wouldn't leave his mind.
"No shit, Sherlock! I was about to, but then you rudely interrupted my nap I so desperately craved."
"Come on. Let's go to Via and get your potions. You can tell me some stories of you two on our way.", she proposed. Harry hummed in agreement, already thinking about the best stories he shared with the blond male. There were a lot, maybe starting at their first meeting? Or his favorite incident of all time, Draco the cute white ferret. After some thinking the healer decided on their funniest stories, including the ferret, a bloody chicken that (almost) killed Malfoy and a snowball fight at Hogsmeade with unfair advantages on Harry's side.
There were a lot of healers running around the small place, fetching everything they needed for their patients. The two potion-masters working at St. Mungo's had a hard time keeping up with all the injuries in summer, but most of the time everything worked out just right. Harry smiled at one of cauldrons, imagining Malfoy standing there in sixth year. The glances they shared, because Malfoy was so desperately trying to be better than him. He had felt so good back then, being better like Malfoy at potions, even if he cheated a little bit.
"Pardon me?"
"Teddy?"
"Draco? Are you alright?", he asked, his voice wavering a bit as if not sure about laughing or crying with the other. The blonde gestured to give him a moment, trying to subdue his laughter.
But soon a frown claimed his face, his brows shaping a v; nose slightly raised. Sixth year has been utterly terrible, a complete disaster to be exact. Harry learned most of life's lessons the hard way, but some of them he wished to not involve other people around him. Growing up in a love-lacking family has proven to make Harry's experience on regular social encounters practically nonexistent. Hence this ridiculous accident in the girls bathroom occurred. Harry never forgave himself for his behavior, seeing a crying boy and almost killing him. Even with the hurtful past of the two, Malfoy never deserved anything like that. A sigh escaped Harry's lips, hand running through his midnight locks. He was such an idiot. But this was his chance to make up for everything, a chance he had to use.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Draco?", Harry whispered, his voice trembling worse than he imagined it to. The other obviously tried to suppress a smug grin as he nodded, not looking up to Harry. But Harry knew. He always knew. "I know you wonder what happened... Why I am here and all."
After performing the charms Harry sat on the now clean floor, smiling softly while pointing his wand slowly to the man's face. First he made out pale skin, sickly pale, almost white with some remaining dirt covering it. Then he made out high, very much fallen in cheekbones. They looked as if the man was a living skeleton, so incredibly prominent were they. A pointy chin and sharp jaw intensified the skeleton look, completed by sunken in eyes and dark circles beneath them. No sleep at all, that was clear. Lastly the face was completed by piercing silver eyes, looking directly into his and platinum blond hair falling onto his forehead. Millions of thoughts abruptly halted at the intense stare, giving Harry something close to a punch in the throat. He couldn't breath. Malfoy.
Draco slowly pointed to his ribs with a wrinkled nose, most likely from the movement he had to make. Broken ribs were truly a pain in the ass, you weren't able to move or to breath correctly. Everything just hurt. But this was maybe the weirdest of Malfoy's injuries. You don't just break your ribs by sitting in a corner. There were exactly two possibilities. One: Malfoy had a fight with someone. Two: Someone has beaten him up. A guy who couldn't even breath without pain was beaten up by a ward most likely. Second version was highly more likely, because there was nothing Malfoy could have probably done to cause a fight. He couldn't move, he couldn't speak, he couldn't even breath. As soon as realization hit Harry, a deep growl escaped his throat. Whoever did this will get punished.
"Ready to run away with me?", Harry whispered, looking shortly at the officers around them. A big grin crossed Draco's features.
Now Draco
handsome young man. The other could barely be older than himself, if his flour powdered cheeks and startling green eyes were any indication. The man wore a checkered button up, only it
When they arrived at the fancy restaurant in the middle of London, Draco's hands got a little bit sweaty. There was no going back now. Harry parked at the entrance, quickly stepped out of the car and jogged to the other side to hold the door open for Draco. The action made Draco smile, as he stepped out of the car as well with Harry's help. He put his hand on the smaller man's arm, like a princess did with her prince, and let Harry walk him inside the bigger ball room. Loads of people were standing inside, talking with each other in small groups. For every rich guy was at least one model with a minimum age gap of twenty years. Something Draco realized exactly in this moment was: All models were female. There was not a single male date.
Draco nodded eagerly, a wide smile spreading over his face. "I can give you the address. It would be lovely to be picked up by you at seven.", he answered, just to make sure what he had heard was, indeed, really what Harry had said. Speaking from his shiteating grin, Harry definently said just what Draco thought he heard.
"I feel flattered, but you are exaggerating. I am not the best."
kind of guy.
"Let's go to your's.", he answered finally, earning himself a dashing smile and another soft kiss to the cheek. Harry was quick to pull him out the front gates and onto to road, where a monstrous black motorcycle stold, prepared with two helmets and heavy leather jackets. Draco stared, bewildered, at the vehicle in front of himself. Seeing as Harry worked in a small bakery Draco expected one of those small mopets, not...
Winter. What a great fucking time of the year. No sun is shining most of the days, wind blows icy snow into your face and the temperature is freezing in general. So, all in all, it's the perfect time to stand outside in skin-tight leather trousers without a shirt. Sometimes, Draco wondered how he didn't freeze to death already. Small snowflakes clung to his almost as white hair, damping it enough to make it clutch to his forehead. The streets were almost empty, except for some sappy romantic couples that were holding hands and throwing snow on each other with deafening high screeches. Hence the blond male crossed his long arms in front of his chest to shield himself a little bit from the freezing wind, all with a rather disgusted look on his face. Still, he tried to subdue the trembling of his limbs, which were slowly going numb through the low temperature and missing clothes. It wasn't really arousing to anyone to see a shivering guy with a running nose at the edge of the street, which was Draco's goal after all. The problem was, one day before Christmas no guy was in need or able to get himself a call boy from the streets. Most married men, who were his main customers, had dinner with their lousy family and wife they didn't love to make the impression of a perfect family. Only a few days after Christmas the steady flow of customers renewed, thanks to the boring every-day-life of said men.
"Bonjour Monsieur. My name is 'arry, how can I be of 'elp?", the man asked in a strong, but very attractive French accent.
- - - - - -
"I believe he strikes several nerves and they cause something to stand upright in a matter of seconds."
Seeing Malfoy happy like this after years of fighting on the wrong side with a madman in his own home, then several years of the deadliest prison on earth (without even a good reason), and now with a smile on his face at the sight of his... friend? What exactly were these two? Were they in a relationship? Or promised to each other? Harry read in one of those thick books about pureblood-familys that Hermione was so interested in that those kinds of families often promised their children to one another so they would strengthen the family line... or something similar to those lines.
"Why was there a panic attack?", she asked, composure slowly falling back into place. Of course, the curious side of her had to shine through. It always has in these moments.
"He is a dog..."
A frown captured the man's handsome face, as he looked to his wife. "What's that supposed to mean? Padfoot loves my food."
"May I kiss you?", he whispered, eyes locked with those of Draco. Images of violent customers came to his mind, forcing him to kiss or do even more disgraceful things. And here Harry was, asking for permission to give him his first real kiss. The smile on Draco's lips didn't leave as he nodded and soon felt lips on his, moving delicately with his own. The gagging sound of Teddy was fully ignored as they both were in their own perfect world for a few seconds, lips moving with each other. The rough stubble on Harry's chin felt delicious on Draco's soft skin, the feeling of safety spreading to every cell of his body. When they drew apart, Harry's hands lingered a little bit longer on Draco's back as they needed and the blonde's fingers traced the outlines of Harry's hard jaw line. Butterflies erupted in Draco's stomache with a few minutes delay, making him all fuzzy and giggly.
"I know. Merlin, I know Mione.", he whispered, eyes watery and voice wavering.
- - - - -
Harry chuckled once again, hand running through blond hair as soon as he removed the helmet. "As much as I'd love to continue this.", he began, immediately earning himself a disappointed groan and he smiled to himself. "We can continue after dinner, mon amour. But I bet my papa is already stalking us zrough ze window, and I prefer to make love to you somewhere more privé, probablement at the second date?", he whispered, hand giving Draco's buttocks a short squeeze. The blonde almost yelped at the gesture as well as at the proposal, though he couldn't say he wasn't extremely excited about it. Not only about the fact he might lose his virginity, but mostly at the fact he would lose it on a summer trip at Paris with the hottest and nicest guy he could imagine. Definetly something to look forward to. Though it touched him somewhat to know Harry wouldn't sleep with him on their first date.
"36! Santa really made up for the past years. Am I allowed to open them now, Dray?"
"New shift?", he asked groggily. He had seen the young Healer leaving after he had finished Malfoy's bath.
With three big steps he was in the middle of the circle, catching one of the officers attention. The man began to talk, but Draco didn't care as he shoved the guy away to finally see who the third pirate was. When the startling emerald green orbs finally connected with his, Draco felt his knees going week. Longer black hair strands fell loosely into Harry's face, hiding a long lightening shaped scar reaching across his face. He had grown quite a lot, not really surprising though. He was maybe two years older than Draco after all. A breath Draco didn't know he was holding left his lips as he took a step forward, pulling off his hood in the same moment.
to signal midnight, the exact moment when the attacker made their weapon connect with the faces of both men lying beneath them.
The shock in Harry's eyes must have shown, for the knowing smirk on Angela's face. But before Harry could answer to her, or better ask her what else she knew about him from Malfoy's stories, they arrived at the blonde's room. Angela immediately stepped inside, a wide smile on her face.
Ranked: Extreme underweight;
Via and Tara both gave a thoughtful click of their tongue. "It's understandable that you miss him. He was one of the few constants in your life, always there and always up to something. In a weird way you could trust that he would stay.", Via answered, making Tara shrug nonchalantly.
"Malfoy, Sir."
There were words lingering on Draco's lips he wasn't quite ready to speak out yet, but alone the fact he was about ready to throw them casually at his date were enough to make his eyes sting.
Well, most likely he was, Harry wouldn't know what Ron could possibly do for almost two hours, the arrest surely didn't last longer than thirty minutes.
"We have to get back to the ship. Padfoot wants a personal chat with Lucius and he hates to wait.", Harry threw in, eyeing the small family with worry. Especially Draco looked rather scared, not really excited about the idea of getting outside and onto a pirate ship. Therefore, the young pirate walked over to him with a sweet smile, head cocked to the side, he said. "Don't worry champ. Nobody will hurt you or your parents, I promise. You can stay right by my side while they chat and I show you around the ship if you want.", lopsided grin on his lips. Draco's working eye looked into his with startling earnestness, searching for a hint of a lie. But when he didn't find any, he slowly walked over to Harry and grabbed his sleeve. Remus shot Harry a thankful glance, a little bit of pride mixed in between. The taller boy exhaled slowly, before taking the little hand of Draco in his own to lead him outside, right after finding some shoes for him. Remus and Peter walked beside Lucius and Narcissa, one on each side. While Pettigrew still held his cutlass to Lucius' throat, just to make sure nothing funny happened, Remus engaged Narcissa into some sort of small talk, about what education Draco got. Apparently, the young boy would never go to school, for teachers being unable to teach a partly blind kid. Nobody had the nerves. She tried her best to teach her son herself, but she wasn't educated to teach. Harry frowned at the conversation. Nobody liked the outsiders. Society didn't. But on their ship, on the rough sea, it didn't matter how much of an outsider you were. It was only you against nature. A never ending fight, man against the depth of the sea, a monster that only waited for people to stumble into it. To swallow them.
One hesitant blink. Harry smiled encouraging, taking a miniature water bottle out of his pockets. Then he whispered a spell to make it grow back to its original size. After another glance to the parchment Harry bit his lip and looked into the silver eyes once again.
Harry had to close his eyes at the imagination. His hands caught his weak body against the side of the couch, as soon as he leaned against it. Memories flashed Harry's mind, of visiting Azkaban, of seeing Malfoy for the first time, looking like Death himself. Of the list of injuries, of the small spark of fear and hope in his former enemy's eyes. Hot stomach acid burned in the back of his throat, soon enough hitting the floor as Harry emptied his stomach when the horrible memories finally gripped him.
"You are horribly distracting.", Draco mumbled, head falling back on the smaller shoulder.
"Oh Papa and Sirius will be so 'appy to know zeir création insulted Lucius.", he answered, clapping his hands as if they just won a big price. Shortly after, he jumped from the Harvey and held a hand out to Draco, his eyes twinkling in utter bemusement. "Alors, come on! I want you to meet my parents!"
"U didn't have to do this Harry.", he whispered, placing a loving kiss to his man's cheek.
Frostbite at fingers and toes;
"It's so good to see you, Madame Talouse. I see you are just as beautiful as you have been when we first met."
"What do you want, Nott?", he spat, venom dripping from his every word.
"Minister! May I join you for a second?", he called out to get their attention. All of them looked up, surprised enough to see Harry Potter in the Ministry. Harry detested this place, one reason why he decided against being an Auror. Still, the Wizardng World loved him and so did Shacklebolt. So he wasn't all too shocked when they all nodded eagerly, holding the door open for him. He entered with a small smile, head now held high enough so everyone could see his face. He liked to hide from reporters, but he was proud of who he became.
The smile was back on Harry's face as soon as he stood back up to get the potion and lists. The little boy was incredibly sweet and clever, trying to comfort his parents after he was diagnosed with a rather life changing illness. Children were truly something too good for this cruel world.
The embrace broke only when Harry felt a puddle of water forming beneath his legs, the bathtub was overflowing. The Gryffindor quickly stopped the water with a flick of his wand and vanished the puddle. Malfoy rubbed the back of his hand over his eyes, sniffing silently. Both of them simultaneously started searching for the others gaze and when their eyes locked, they gave a small smile. Not in the need for words, Harry carefully lifted Malfoy into the bathtub.
- - - - -
Harry was the first to shift awkwardly, his legs carrying him towards the other. As soon as he was barely a foot away, he stopped and flipped the lose strands out of his face. "So... could I take you out for dinner zis evening?", the raven haired man asked, his green eyes looking everywhere but at Draco. Though he missed the most stunned and excited expression on the blonde's face.
"A ward did this?", he mumbled with narrowed eyes, ripping open his dirty shirt to reveal the injury. What he saw quickly became one of the most horrific things he would ever see. Malfoy's ribs weren't broken to the inside, like a punch would cause them to. No, they were broken to the outside, meaning someone grabbed Malfoy by his ribs as he was nothing more than a skeleton and pulled so hard that they bloody broke.
The water got too hot, as if telling Harry not to think too much about this. He stepped to the side, turning the water completely cold and stepped back into it. The now cold water felt like no triple espresso could. He felt his lungs filling with more air, his brain and muscles waking up immediately. With no other thoughts on his mind Harry washed himself under the cold water, rubbing his orange and cinnamon scented shampoo deep into his curls. Probably the scent was a women's shampoo. But Harry committed to the fact that he loved women's products a good while ago. Shampoos shouldn't have labels. It smelled better than the 'leather-wood' scented one he saw at the store a few weeks ago. And he probably couldn't live without the hundreds of body lotions anymore, his hands were getting so dried out from all the disinfectant.
"I am so glad we came here, mother. It will surely be an extravagant vacation, just how we both like it."
"Would spare me a lot of illegal work."
will make sure he doesn't come near you.", he explained, fingers caressing Malfoy's pointy chin. Each tear that dropped from Draco's eyes, Harry whiped away with extreme care.
"Alright, go on then Harry. Who earned to be called a bastard around here?", Robards asked, his brows furrowed in a serious expression.
The couples always crossed the street to make sure not to have any contact with the lowlife Draco was called out to be. In the beginning, Draco was ashamed of people looking at him as if he was disgusting and dirty for selling his body. Everyone did, except for the smallest kids who crossed his path. They were mostly concerned about him not having clothes to dress in or ask him if he would like to have their sandwich. Sometimes, Draco almost took the little sandwich, up until he saw the parents of the kid, pulling it away from him and ordering the little dwarf to never talk to scum like that. But the years changed him. Draco grew out of the shame, he realized a shy and insecure guy would only attract worse men. So instead the blond male decided on staying completely professional while doing his job and only let his emotions flow as soon as he was in a cheap hotel room for the night.
Harry got out of the car with his eyes glued to Draco, excited to see the blonde's reaction to his monster of a home. All he received was an uncertain, almost pained mask. The raven tilted his head to the side, asking Draco the silent question of what was wrong.
Actually, that was immensely understated. Harry had tons of patients to visit, even seven more this evening and the clock already read 8 pm. But he didn't want to leave Malfoy, or make him think he was only a damn patient. He was not.
With curiosity visible in his silver eyes Draco looked around through the restaurant, path leading to the starter buffet. All the food looked rather delicious, especially for Draco's more than empty stomach. He quickly grabbed a plate and filled it with almost everything, up until a hot breath crept up his neck. He almost let his plate fall to the floor, all the red flags in his brain were swinging like crazy.
A soft pink tainted Draco's cheeks as he answered the question with a shake of his head.
Footsteps echoed through the walls of endless houses, which were all set directly next to each other, giving the sounds no chance to escape into the silent night. The village was sleeping, unknowing of the danger within. Dim light of the moon marked the outer lines of the small houses, long shadows thrown underneath. Almost ghastly light was being reflected by the wet pavement, shining like diamonds in the midnight. The street moved in odd lines to the top of a hill, ending in front of a small mansion. Tension rose at the sight of the building, evil smirks forming on dirty mouths filled with rotten and golden teeth, hidden behind ugly beards. Eyes flickered with greediness, amusement, excitement at the least. A pair of emerald orbs stood out. Hatred, anger filled them, no real interest in the gold itself. Their owner had only reached the age of eleven, youngest in a crew full of criminals. He didn't carry a pike nor a cutlass like his comrades, only a small dagger hidden under his linen shirt. In his left hand he held a lockpick. All the way up the street his fingers were twitching, eager to fulfill his job. Pirates were nasty players. After losing five crewmembers at their last raid, Captain Black decided it would be best if they made use of Potter's talent on breaking locks. Now they were silent assassins, stealing and killing in the dead of night. Harry wouldn't have it any other way, he loved to see those petrified faces of rich bastards, scared for their life. He loved the begging of those who wouldn't look at him in another occasion. Nothing could ever compare to the feeling of power in those moments. The power he didn't possess when Riddle killed his parents. Before the boy got lost in his grief, another pirate dropped his cutlass low enough so the tip scraped the stone of the pavement. The sound was deafening in the otherwise silent village, Harry felt like his ears would start bleeding from the horrible sound alone. The boy gave an angry side glance to the man, but he only received an evil grin in return. Pettigrew always enjoyed molesting the boy. The fiery temper made for a good little fight. But this night, Harry ignored the older man. He was too excited to start a fight. Instead he stepped up the few stairs to the door of the mansion, lockpick at the ready. After only a minute the huge mahogany door opened with a soft click, giving entrance to a gigantic hallway. Potter smiled in triumph, lockpick quickly hidden back in his pocket. All the pirates entered, cutlasses drawn and bags already filling with artifacts standing around, jewelry, gold and paintings, everything that looked like it was of worth. The youngest pirate started to search the house with inaudible steps. Nobody would be down here, most rich people slept on the higher floors. So he decided to search up there. His right hand touched the handrail of the stairs. The polished wood sent shivers down his spine, a cold, lifeless feeling always came with these houses. He would never understand how people could live in these big mansions, more place than anyone could use. He knew Lord and Lady Malfoy lived in here, a very powerful family with loads of connections to the royal houses of England. And they were cruel, heartless and egoistic. Harry's parents, Lily J. Potter and James Potter, previously tried to befriend the family, not long before they were murdered. But the Lord turned them down, reasoning with Mr. Potters Indian descent. They didn't befriend anything apart from pure english people, anything else was below them. Maybe if they didn't turn them down, if they weren't so bloody rich, his parents would still be alive. They could have provided safety for the small family. Instead they were one of the many rich bastards who were responsible for the murder. With this reasoning he moved through the hallway, followed by Pettigrew. The man wasn't pretty good in being subtle and quiet, so Harry wasn't really surprised when Lord Malfoy awoke immediately at the sound of a creaking door. But Pettigrew was faster than the blond man, holding his cutlass to the porcelain skin of the bigger man's throat. A smile crept on Harry's lips, the fear in Lucius Malfoy's eyes positively sparking joy deep down in his very core.
As soon as all the bubbles were washed out, Harry stepped out of the shower, shivering a little from the cold water by now. But after he found his way into the bedroom and put on some jeans and a sweater, he felt warm and comfortable again.
A sigh escaped his lips as he pulled out a robe, a linen shirt and simple brown trousers. Enough to get out of the house without further notice. The hood of his robe hid his face well enough, so nobody would stop and stare at him. After dressing up, he quickly rushed out of the house, making as good as no sounds. In his left pocket he still had Harry's dagger, something he forgot to gave him back when they parted. Whenever he went outside, the dagger was with him, so he could keep it safe until Harry returned.
sweets, and one simply had to taste all of them. Anything else would be a crime.
"You boys have plans for dinner, I figure?", she asked, her eyebrows raised and gaze switching from a happy dancing Harry to a stunned staring Draco.
"Don't you think I shouldn't be here? This-", he gestured to the whole of what Harry called home, "-is not where a whore belongs. Your wife would surely not be impressed to see me."
Harry was silent for a few seconds, before eventually looking straight into Draco's eyes. "Be my date."
. "Harry... is that a full on Harvey?", he asked slowly, adrenaline already pumping through his veins. He had always wanted to ride one of these, but to his father it wasn't 'classy' enough.
Malfoy turned in the tub to punch Harry on the arm, a small smile on his lips he seemingly tried to hide, but failed miserably while trying.
"Scared, Malfoy?", he asked grinning, wiggling his eyebrows in anticipation. Malfoy mouthed 'You wish!', right to Harry's face and the latter chuckled lowly, happy that his former enemy didn't forget one of their favorite punch-up lines from old days. "Come on then. I promise I won't make it awkward."
"Dray? Can you look at me?", Harry breathed, his fingers slowly turning the blonde's chin towards him. The silver eyes, still filled with tears, didn't quite look at him. They looked all at Harry's face, but not to his eyes.
"What, your moment lasted almost two hours?! We just heard something breaking and suddenly the door was locked and in here was complete silence! Someone could have murdered you! Or, more likely, you could have murdered each other!", she yelled at them, finger pointing repeatedly into Harry's chest, causing with the mix of breaking voice and tears in her eyes real guilt to flicker across the Healer's features. Sometimes he forgot to think about his best friends, he forgot they actually cared about him. That sounded quite harsh, but in the past years of their friendship, Ron and Hermione were mostly focused on each other and their careers, leaving Harry out for most of it. Not that he complained, he was focusing on his job, too. But still, he had to deal with his own problems and didn't include them altogether for most of them. Now it felt incredibly stupid to shut them out completely whenever he had something to deal with. Quite literally shutting out.
"What then? How will I go on with the job and my miserable life after having tasted the stars?", Draco whispered, a small hiccup leaving his lips with the second confession he made. He was afraid of his future, afraid of going back to his job.
Harry looked at each of the guys individually for a short time, before eventually leaning back and rubbing the stubble on his chin.
"Of course the food is good, since we didn't let you cook, James.", she drawled, leaning against the door frame.
"I am what?"
Harry closed his eyes, lying his head on Draco's shoulder to be as close to his ear as possible and to have as much physical contact as possible. He started breathing, deep and slow, the rhythm he wanted Draco to copy.
"Ronald, pray tell, did you lose your wand again?", she asked, thin eyebrow raised in a way it could have made concurrence to Malfoy.
The pained grimace on Harry's face was back, mixed with some embarrassment as the tips of his ears went slightly pink. "I hope he won't find out. One could think I finally have my rage under control by now. I'm not some stupid kid anymore." Merlin, he hated being so vulnerable around Draco.
"Malfoy this really isn't a big deal anymore. You will sleep peacefully and dream of something good and when you wake up you can eat as much ice cream as you want and most likely you'll be able to talk better again then. In some days we have to plan your back-surgery, too. If you ever want to walk again that is.", the Healer explained with a friendly smile. Of course Malfoy has always been a coward, he saw that in the war, but talking to him like he did to his smaller patients was another thing. When he saw the uncertainty in Malfoy's eyes he gently squeezed the other man's arm and smiled. "You don't have to decide anything yet. Maybe we can bring somebody to help with your decision? It might help."
After a few deep breaths Harry splashed some cold water onto his face and washed his mouth out with mouthwash, before gulping down some water to get his body hydrated again. The trembling slightly subdued by then, enough to have a quick shower without breaking his neck. The hot water felt like heaven on his skin. Tension was leaving his body with each breath, his stiff shoulders softening with each second.
"Damn, Potter. What an entrance. When did you get so fucking sexy?", the tall man asked, dark brown eyes twinkling in amusement and flirtiness. The groan escaping Harry's lips could have been assaulting to anyone else, but the man only barked out a laugh and shook his head. "Got it. I guess you need the Weasel for a drink. Go on, I take care of the paperwork."
"The butterflies? I think so.", Harry answered in the same whisper, giving the back of Draco's hand a soft kiss.
A small doorbell rang as he stepped into the petite room, smelling of croissants and macarons and so many beautiful eclairs and petit four, his brain almost shut down completely. Draco had always had a terrible sweet tooth, but fresh Parisian bakery sent him to the doctor's more than once. There were just so
"I will probably never get used to this.", he whispered, catching his breath again after several seconds. "What is it Harry?"
"I guess I kind of missed him. My wizarding world always included Malfoy, from the very beginning. He was the first kid I met, back at Madam Malkin's. Nobody was around and he was just rambling about Hogwarts, wide eyes and a smile on his face. I haven't known any better than to refuse his friendship, but still. It haunts me. Maybe I would have been able to protect him from all this pain.", Harry recalled with a frown, light dancing in the emerald iris of his.
One stubborn glare of Draco later, Harry slowly handed the other the mirror, but not before sitting upright behind him and pulling him up to his chest, one arm carefully draped around his stomach. He didn't want Draco to lose his shit and hurt himself. The older looked at him as if he has gone crazy and snatched the mirror from Harry's hands. As soon as Draco looked into the mirror though, he almost instantly looked away again. His hands were trembling, eyes filled with tears. Slowly, very slowly he turned the mirror to look at it again, before throwing it through the room as if it burned him. Harry watched everything happening in slow-motion from then on, the mirror hitting the wall, breaking into hundreds of little pieces and leaving a small carb in the white paint, Malfoy's breathing catching up with his frantic heartbeat, followed by as much thrashing around as Draco's worn out and paralyzed body allowed. He tried to shove Harry away, tears spilling freely over his cheeks and landing partly on Harry's hand on Draco's stomach. Choked sobs escaped the blonde's mouth, his hands pulling at his hair and Harry's clothing. Everything happened kind of damped, Harry couldn't hear properly, the rush of blood in his ears was too loud.
Silence. There was no answer, but Harry made out that someone's breath was picking up at the mention of his name. He quickly turned to the side of the room he heard the breath from, but still saw nothing.
"So what?! What if he was a callboy?! It wouldn't change a damn thing!", Harry yelled, pulling Draco to his side and holding him, as if he tried to protect him from the world. The feeling of safety it caused in Draco was indescribable. "I don't give a single shit what he was. I care about how he helped me out when I needed it, how he stands up for himself even though he is incredibly self-conscious. How he kept going in the worst possible world a human being could live in. These are the things that count. Not that he was forced to do a terrible job. It doesn't make him any less important than me or even Mister Johnson!"
Not even an hour later, Harry and Draco sat, again, in Harry's black Mercedes, on their way to the dinner party of Harry's boss. The designer decided to dress in a full black suit in striking comparison to Draco's silver one. They looked like day and night, sun and moon. Draco wasn't even mad about how well they fit together. Right then and there, he belonged with Harry and nobody could tell him otherwise.
"Yes. Y-Yes, we have plans for dinner.", Draco murmured, his hands reaching in his pocket to receive his Muggle money. He placed a few of the green bills on the countertop, not even sure how much money it was. But he had about 50 of them in his pocket, so he just decided to give her a few. The blue eyes grew wide.
- - - - - - -
"Hey, it's alright.", Harry whispered, his hand automatically running through the wild blond hair on the older one's head. "No need to be afraid."
Now Draco was the one to hold on. His body relaxed into Harry's, a small smile tugging at his lips. "As a kid, I used to dream of a knight in shining armor, saving me from that hellhole I grew up in. Maybe I have finally found him.", he whispered, his nose buried in Harry's shoulder, which was smelling of orange and cinnamon.
Draco held the dagger like it was something precious, a source of hope. Harry saw the small wheels turning in his head. Before anyone could talk again, the small group reached the ship. The Wolfstar was a rather small ship, nothing all too big. The wood was painted black, but it peeled off already, showing lighter scars beneath the paint. A crew of about twenty pirates awaited the group, in the middle Captain Black with his big hat, wild black locks reaching the small of his back and gun as well as a cutlass hung loosely at his belt. His grey eyes shone brightly in the moonlight, fixated on Lucius and Narcissa.
"Hello. My name is Harry, I am the healer you are supposed to meet before getting out of here. Is the light okay like that?"
So with growing confidence the blonde strode into the shop, his eyes immediately searching for the beautiful woman his best friend's mother was. Quickly enough, brown eyes locked with his and he was encircled by welcoming arms, running through all the measurements to create a perfect outfit for his date. Not that he actually mentioned his date was a young man, not a young girl. He
"My cousin! He's a small boy, Nott had him for the past years. The bastard blackmailed me by hurting Teddy if I did something against his wishes. Like that, he had me under control even though I was too old. Good lord they will kill Teddy if they find out what we did!"
"Two Aurors showed up at Mungo's the other day to get a Healer to the scene, because the prisoner had 'some sort of injury and needed a Healer to look over them'. As you can imagine, I volunteered to visit the prison.", all eyes were by now glued to him, waiting for a turning point. But Harry had to pause, the pictures of Malfoy in the dark corner, more dead than alive, were still way too vivid in his mind. Even deep breaths weren't enough to stop the trembling of his voice as he continued. "Nobody told me who I would have to heal. When I saw Mal-... Draco. When I saw Draco sitting in the complete dark, freezing corner of that goddamn cell; I got so bloody angry. Not only the fact that nobody cared enough to call a Healer sooner, somebody actively hurt him. And I don't mean a soft beating. Somebody grabbed a helpless boy's ribs and pulled so hard they broke, knowing nobody would care enough to intervene. Now that Draco is my patient and I won't sleep a single night without knowing this guy got what he bloody deserved, I want to know who did this to him. And I want to beat the ever living shit out of him. This guard, whoever it was, deserves worse than being called a bastard, gentleman. He deserves that exact cell Draco sat in. Because whoever can do such gruesome things to another human being, earns a worse treatment than any Death Eater we have captured. They at least had their own morality. A wrong one, but at least there was one. This guard, however, decided not only to hurt somebody willingly, but a literally defenseless person, who is already paying for his wrong doings enough as it is. And I want to make sure this monster gets exactly what he deserves."
The moment Harry finished his explanation with another wave of magic, finally knocking Ron to the ground and receiving a pained
"Hey, buddy? You don't have to be afraid, I won't hurt you. Look, I have your teddy?", he whispered, ignoring the loud laughs of his crew just next door. The boy was obviously scared, so he tried to appear as friendly as possible. When the boy actually looked up rather fearfully and met Harry's gaze, the older boy's heart stopped for a moment. The small boy had mesmerizing porcelain skin, faintly lit by the moonlight shining through an open window. He was so pale, his father looked rather tained in comparison. But what really caught Harry's attention, were the boys eyes. His left eye was startling silver, much like his father's, but with a hint of the Black's grey color, for his mother being a Black. His iris was almost filled with black, due to the darkness of the room, but the color was not to be missed. His right eye on the other hand, was milky blue, the black dot in the middle was glazed over. It didn't hold the same fear as his left one and it was barely looking in the same direction as his silver eye. Harry quickly figured out that he must be blind on the right side, what created the startling contrast of silvery-black and milky-blue-white. He would have told the boy how utterly beautiful it was, but he couldn't because those mesmerizing eyes were filled with ever flowing tears. An almost undefeatable feeling filled Harry's stomach, an urge to wipe those tears away and hold the boy in his arms. Instead, he gave the best smile he could manage and gave the boy his little companion, happy to see that the boy calmed down a little bit.
Tumor between two vertebrae in the lower back, blocking nerves to the legs completely, therefore paraplegic;
"Aye. The boy is braver than his father.", Sirius agreed, glee visible in his eyes. Draco started giggling at the comment, mostly because everyone agreed with a grin. Lucius looked rather dumbfounded, obviously not expecting his son to turn on him like that.
A snort left Draco's lips, he did get those out by now without too much of a problem, which Harry could only interpret as:
(See the end of the chapter for
"Auror Department.", he called out to the elevator, almost losing his footage at the immediate speed of the small cabin. As soon as the doors opened, Harry stomped out and through the corridors, ignoring the surprised mountains these men were in his way. Truly, the Auror department was a frightening place to be.
By now, Draco was wide awake, smiling from ear to ear, but Harry didn't quite manage to wake up. Still, he stretched and stood up, heaving Teddy over his shoulder. "Come on then Ted, Santa surely brought you some stuff."
Draco opened one of his silver eyes to stare at the other male. "Then why are you wasting my time?"
"I thought you Rich Guys would be more secure about what you achieved."
The redhead only wrinkled his nose at the conversation, but clapped his partner on the shoulder before eventually walking over to Harry. "I believe it's a day for some firewhiskey?", the man paused, eyeing his friend down for several seconds. "Merlin, Harry. You look like shit. Come on mate, we'll drink some at mine."
While there was a short pause, Harry took a step forward and let his hand slide down from Draco's shoulder to his arm, signaling he would like to take the trembling hand into his. Of course, Draco allowed him to, feeling a pleasant shiver run down his long spine as their fingers entwined.
A flare of panic crossed Draco's features, undeniably a result of Harry's proposal. An understandable reaction, Harry would have been panicked in Draco's situation as well. Still, the Healer wasn't one to give up on the chance of some bonding time with his possible crush that easily. He might have been one to rapidly get scared by any sort of interaction with people he found even mildly interesting, but with Draco being in his current state, Harry felt responsible to show Draco the attraction he felt towards him. Even though he might not find himself appealing at the moment.
Harry slowly exhaled after reading everything carefully. Underlined parts were the most dangerous one for the moment being, apart from his incredibly low weight. The man in front of him didn't even weigh more than a child. Admiration for such strength built in Harry's chest as he looked into Malfoy's eyes for minutes without talking. Then he carefully squeezed his hand with a sad smile.
Captain Black, Harry's godfather, had a thing for moral and codes. They would face a rather gruesome death if ever caught in sexually abusing a women. Even though killing was somehow allowed, even torture wasn't off the list, so the moral was rather compromised on a few things to balance out their crimes. At least that's what the Captain always said. Harry believed that his godfather was just utterly disgusted by rape, because he experienced the aftermath of rape in form of Harry's mother, Lily. In her younger years the girl was raped by some drunken old man and she had been rather traumatized ever since. Sirius, James, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew all lived through it with her, doing their best to comfort the girl and help her to live through it. That's why Harry assumed that Captain Black was still haunted by the event in his youth, therefore not allowing it on his very ship.
"Don't be afraid. I won't let you fall.", he whispered into his ear, blond locks tickling his cheek. The younger boy nodded slowly, before walking over the plank with baby steps. His knees were visibly shaking. Harry couldn't hold it against him. The sea was indeed scary. He only didn't care since he didn't have anything to lose anymore. If the sea decided it was time for him to leave, he wouldn't have a reason to fight. But Draco had something to lose. His father, his mother. A whole life full of opportunities.
"The way Bird Nest looks at you, I don't think it will really be a problem. You look dreadful by the way in a suit. Like some bureaucratic asshole."
Tara slapped his cheek softly, stern brown eyes locking with his emerald ones.
"Care to introduce us?", Harry whispered, shaking his hands out to release the pain.
in general. Who was Harry to think he would lay down with Harry like
A small smile spread on the black haired's face and he winked at Draco.
"Never in a million years. No dates with coworkers, first rule of all. Right before being professional with patients."
The younger nodded and complied, opening another small package. There was a soft pink color to Harry's cheeks as he handed it to Draco. To the blonde's surprise, there was a set of nail polish and make up in it, something any girl would love to possess. There was surprise written on Draco's face, but mainly because he thought that was a thing he could have scared Harry away with.
The door swung open with a silent creaking noise and Harry entered the dark room with curiosity. A relatively large bed grazed the middle of the room, a bear carpet laying in front of it. Sharp teeth grazed the mouth of the dead animal, glass eyes staring lifeless in the direction of a small fireplace. It wasn't burning anymore, but the wood was still glowing, enough to heat the rather large room. The young pirate could make out that the bed was unmade, blanket thrown to the side and a small teddy bear was sitting on the pillow. With a small frown he walked over, taking the teddy bear in his hands and turning it, wondering who it belonged to. Nobody ever mentioned the Malfoy's having a child, but the room surely looked like it. But where was it?
Even though Draco was not so sure about Harry's words, he complied and followed the apparent fashion designer into the changing room. There was enough room for three people to change, so Draco didn't feel too closed in. Harry opened the buttons of the suit, revealing the artful corset underneath which, again, made Draco catch his breath. He could now see that the grey pattern was embroidered with black petals, held together by equally black cords in the back. Draco wasn't able to say anything, he just let Harry dress him in the silky shirt, let him carefully lace the corset and button up the jacket of his suit. The fingers touching him through the fine material sent a shockwave through his body every time. The corset made his waist tinier than that of a woman, made him look delicate and elegant. Everything fit like it was made just for him, hugging his features gently and giving Draco a feeling of secureness. A mirror on the wall opposite to Draco made it possible for him to look over the suit himself. He wasn't disappointed. His silver eyes shone through the material of the suit like mercury, the corset gave him the oh so desired hourglass figure and the suit made his limbs look long and elegant. Never in his entire life did Draco feel like he did right then, emotions overthrowing the professionalism in a matter of seconds. Tears slipped over his cheeks, leaving shimmering traces on his pale cheeks. Harry had a look of concern on his face as he carefully wiped them away, his hands lingering on either side of Draco's face.
The loud snort escaping Draco's lips was prove enough of his amusement about the joke, only intensified by the pillow the blond reached out for and hurled at Harry's face, obviously as pleases by the mental picture as Harry was. Hermione, meanwhile, rolled her eyes at them, not giving Harry the privilege to laugh at a joke about a dead man. Still, she
"Don't look at me like I would break apart from a visit to Azkaban. Look at my patient rather. I'm surprised he is not dead! They really treat the people there like scum!", he explained furiously, one hand gesturing wildly while the other wrote down several potions. Tara dared to look at the man laying in the bed just now, clasping a hand over her mouth in shock. She never saw a person who looked like this. Something you would see coming from one of these terrible Muggle horror movies, not in the real world. But this was very much real, the young woman had trouble keeping her lunch down at the sight.
"Malfoy?! Oh bloody Merlin... this is even worse than I thought. They... they broke somebody already shattered.", she whispered, tears stinging in her eyes. She didn't know much about the blond boy, except for the fact that he was a Death Eater at sixteen and had Voldemort living at his home. He was tortured and forced to help him kill Dumbledore. Everybody would be completely broken after all of this. And what did the light side do after winning? Not helping him, no. Sending him to prison for no reason at all.
"You are worth the world Draco. I'll make you feel so so special, I promise.", he whispered, lips slightly touching Draco's forehead.
I know I promised the chapter way sooner to some of you, and actually I did finish something yesterday night. Though, it has been around three am and most of it felt like gibberish. Soooo, here we go with the worked over version of my late night gibberish, I hope you enjoy it!
Next moment, Harry was leaving the office, walking directly to the next elevator. Inside, he took a second to calm his emotions. A terrible headache was building right behind his eyes, he could feel his veins pumping too much blood through his body and his muscles clenched. His magic was going into overdrive. Hermione and Ron could probably sing a song about how easily Harry's emotion got the better of him back in school and how his magic went apeshit with his uncontrolled rage. Even though he had been getting better at self control throughout the years of working, the rage he was feeling right then was worse than anything he had ever felt. It was even worse than what he felt at Sirius death. Maybe Draco was more important to him than he dared to admit.
A snort left Draco's lips at Harry's expression. He shoved his middle finger into Harry's face, a small smile tugging at his lips. The laugh of Harry following Draco's actions was rich and genuine, all with twinkling green eyes. To his own surprise, the headache was fading with each second he was in Draco's presence, a very welcoming change of events.
"Draco... I don't believe you should do that. Not yet. Give yourself some time to get back to your normal self..."
The shorter male was met with a longer silence, a thoughtful silence on Draco's side. He was contemplating his possibilities. Harry seemed like an okay guy, a bit desperate, but no crazy killer. Though, it wasn't impossible. Looking at the other side of the coin, he didn't really have any other options. So, with crossed arms, Draco scoffed and gave Harry an unimpressed look. "Maybe a wife would do you some good. There is far better company than a guy from the streets for Christmas."
"Does this feel better?", he whispered with a soft smile, head tilted to the side.
"I look... good. Like I am worth something.", a shaky laugh escaped Draco's mouth. "That's the first time in my life that I feel like more than a cheap whore."
"I am glad you two are happy to see each other... I will leave to your reunion and... get some sleep.", Harry told them sheepishly, earning a smirk from Malfoy. Even though Harry could already imagine the 'Yeah, you look dreadful, Potter', Angela decided to give the imagination a new aspect, by giggling and nodding.
"That's something I didn't have to see, mate. Why did you call us? To see you... cuddling?"
After five minutes of concentrated breathing Malfoy was finally done with his panic attack, completely sweat drenched and trembling. But he wasn't hyperventilating anymore, which was all that mattered in this moment. Harry was happy that he managed to calm his patient down without use of the paper bag, it was always the last way out. Both former enemies sat on the bed together, Malfoy in the middle, his waist covered by the white hospital blanket, Harry on his left, facing the blond male. Malfoy's hair was plastered to his bony scalp, stopping right over pointed shoulder blades.
Gigantic. Bloody. Red. Flag.
The blond male allowed his eyes to curiously gaze up to Harry, watching him with interest. Of course he had to stare at Harry like that. Stupid git.
The rich guy moved his gaze towards the bench and back to Draco, lip caught between his teeth. For a moment he said nothing, then, he eventually unlocked the doors of his car. "Come on, get in."
"You know, reliving all what I saw these past days got me really fucked up. I thought after dying once and coming back to life
Draco's hands were forming fists at the words of Theodore Nott. As in the past, he couldn't do anything against the guy. He had hoped he would have more time before having to come up with an idea how to save little Teddy. But it seemed like he had to think of something right then and there.
"I still... I still don't want any of your service...", he managed to stutter, probably with a blush on his cheeks. So, he was
