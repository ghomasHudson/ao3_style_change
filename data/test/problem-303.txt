“You started into drugs?” He asks, making Potter look bewildered. Quickly, he rules that option out.
Draco did not go to Wiltshire with Harry; he would have remembered that. Is that the point of this exercise? Is he supposed to go to Wiltshire with Harry to summon a child’s fairytale with old magick?
“After Mother told him to do so!” Draco says, throwing his hands in the air. “Because she didn’t want me ending up like you!”
Draco can’t remember, suddenly. The man was wearing a tan trench coat, which had been oddly fashionable.  “A muggle.”
It is possible that Lucius is demented. While it is harrowing to finally see his father lose it, it is also a comfort to know he is not the only detruit in these walls–
When Draco feels particularly hopeless, he imagines the words Harry would say to him. How it’s not his fault. How people are unnecessarily cruel. How he’ll find who’s responsible.
Harry looks at Draco with wide-eyed wonderment, like he’s just discovered something and is thrilled by it. “You aren’t afraid?”
“You would be half alive.” Pansy states, drinking slowly. “I have no intentions to marry you. I still want a real relationship.” She pauses, checking if she is being too cruel. “And... I am a beta.”
“You’re still trying too hard.” He moves his hand from the sharp point of Draco’s chin to his jaw, running his knuckles around the edge and back. It feels like everywhere he touches is like that slow muggle fire, right when it hit the gasoline.
Draco doesn’t know. “I know.”
Draco slams the phone onto the desk so hard that it sounds as if there is an earthquake in Wandsworth Prison. He glares at Barnaby through the glass divider.
Draco woke up after a few hours of a nice comfortable sleep. It was early, still dark outside. But something had changed he wasn’t warm anymore. The blanket was missing and his body was wet and cold. He tried to move but then he realized he was pinned down by massive hands. “Good morning slut” Draco felt a wet tongue licking over his body. His Bra was gone. Sharp teeth were sinking into his sensitive skin around his nipple. “Did you sleep well?” Draco was unable to understand what was happening. Was this a dream? Slap. A hard slap woke him up for good. “I asked you a question slut.” “Yes I did.” Slap. Draco was paralyzed. “Master. I am sorry. Yes I did, Master.” Fingers wandered over his body and Draco felt more used than ever before. Without a warning Potter ripped Dracos panties aside and entered him in one painful motion. Draco was a whore alright but he never fucked unprepared. And it hurt like hell. “Scream for me slut. I want to hear you.”
“Master Potter Sir, Kreacher has informed your friend like you wanted him too. Miss Granger is coming over right now and will be arriving any moment sir.” That caught Harry off guard. “ What? she is on her way? How…” he looked at the time. He had talked to Malfoy for hours. Fuck. “Malfoy could you please go upstairs right now and pretend that you don’t exist? I don’t want to hear a single sound coming out of that room.” Malfoy stared at him for a second. Harrys eyes had darkened again and at that moment he didn’t dare to argue with him. So he just silently rushed out of the room a single tear running down his cheek. What did he expect. Of course that little chitchat had changed nothing. He was still just property for Potter to toss around. Why did it hurt so much? Draco should be used to this by now.
Draco was not sure what he should do and he was not sure what to expect when he followed Harry upstairs. Well he definitely did not expect Potter to make tea or to kiss him tenderly pressing him against the wall while holding him close. He did not expect himself to lean into the kiss and press himself closer to the man that had just tortured him moments – or seconds – or hours ago. After all that happened today, Draco did not expect any of this. Fresh tears streamed down his face while he just enjoyed this moment of peace. He couldn’t put together the events of what just happened how he walked upstairs and saw Harry make tea and how he decided to hug his tormentor and how that cruel man decided to kiss him so deeply and sweetly at the same time. Draco started to feel warm and cozy and he realized he could not feel those warm sweet lips pressed to his own or the body holding him close. Did he just imagine it, was he actually going insane? What he also couldn’t feel was pain. Just moments ago everything hurt his whole body had been burning in pain with every move, he hasn’t been able to properly breath as Potter surely managed to break more than just one of Draco’s rips. Grey eyes found an deep ocean of green that made his heart beat faster as he was consumed by the intense bright gaze. Potter was standing in front of him wand in his hand as he healed Draco’s broken rips. Slowly the bruises and welts started to disappear one by one as Potter moved the healing spells down the blonde ones body. Tender fingers brushed over burnt letters as Potter was able to heal some of the burnt skin making the letters faint slightly. “I will need a potion to properly heal this one fast…” the man before him said but Draco was not able to answer him or react in any way. He was too confused. Slowly the blonde wizard tried to back away but felt the cold wall immediately. He saw the concern and confusion in Potters eyes, saw the hand reaching for him for comfort but Draco could not take it any longer. This moment was too good to be true surely it was only a matter of time until he somehow pissed the dark haired wizard off again making him inflict more pain on Draco over and over again. It was best for him to just try and stay away from the broken man as much as he could. The still stinging letters on his hips had marked him and the touch reminded Draco of the contract and the situation he was in. There was no escape and there was no time for bonding or kindness. He is Harry Potters property and he would be treated as such. This man before him is not the boy he used to know in school. He might have been slightly dark and traumatized at that time but the war had changed him for good. The man before him was a broken mess that could explode at any moment. Draco managed to bow his head slightly before he ran off to Potters room where he laid down in front of the metal cage as it was still locked.
“Crucio.” The curse hit Malfoy by surprise. “Don’t you dare ever do that again.” Harry spat at him. The dark haired man grabbed Malfoy by his collar and lifted him up after he had fallen to the ground when he got hit by the pain. He dragged the trembling mess with him downstairs to his dungeons. The ones he had Kreacher get updated for his purposes. He would put them to good use now. Potter chained Malfoy to the wall shaking a bit himself. He was furious. He was pained. He was afraid. He was confused. And someone would have to pay for that.
So this chapter is quite long and also a lot more graphic so beware. It deals with trauma and seriously fucked up shit. Please take it seriously and read the tags. Also there is porn in here somewhere.
“Kreacher don’t know Sir. Kreacher has not seen young Malfoy anywhere around. Kreacher has not seen young Malfoy leave Master Potters chambers.” Harry just sighed annoyed and stood up. “But your food sir. What shall Kreacher do sir.” But Harry did not respond. He slowly walked up the stairs to his chambers trying to control the rage inside of him. When he opened the door he was stunned for a moment.
Prompt fill for Songbird1246:
Harry cleaned himself with a swing of his wand then he turned around to Draco. He looked him over once more before he unchained him from the wall. Draco just dropped to the ground nothing holding him up any longer. Harry carefully started to wash him clean with warm water. He left the plug were it was though. Afterwards he took one of the chains on the ground and connected it to Dracos ankle. “I hope this teached you a lesson, you will stay down here for your behavior and maybe tomorrow you will get the chance of showing me how to behave correctly around your master.” Draco chuckled slightly almost too quiet to be heard. “ You know you actually remind me of someone. He loved to inflict pain on his subjects as well.” Harry laughed dryly. “You think that was painful Malfoy? You have no idea what pain really means. I crack at the slightest little tease, coward. You haven’t even started to feel real pain.” Draco slowly took all the strength he had left together to form the next words with the raspy voice that was almost to silent to be understood due to the constant screaming. “Oh I do know pain. I have known it for a lifetime. But this was something new, something I haven’t felt before but in the end pain is pain. It might have felt unbearable during the time it was inflicted but afterwards it is all the same.” Harry was getting angry again. “You really think you know what it means to feel pain all your life? You lowlife traitor, you useless coward? You have no idea your just a spoiled brat that maybe got a slap on his pampered butt once in a while you have no idea what it means to feel a lifetime of pain!” Harry was outrageous. He was so insanely mad that he used Legilimency on Draco to mock him with what the spoiled brat thought had been a lifetime of pain. Draco tried to stop Harry from entering his memories with Occlumency but it just didn’t work, he was too exhausted to do anything about it. Harry saw and felt the horrors that had accompanied Draco through his life and the war. He saw all the unbearable things that had happened to him in flashes, they rained down on him and Harry couldn’t really control them. Slowly he began to truly understand what made Draco into the man that was lying before him, the boy he had known in school. A boy that had just tried to survive the torture that his life had been like he did himself. What Harry thought had been Arrogance was the mask a broken boy had worn to never been called weak again. What Harry thought had been Cruelty had been a child’s only option to defend himself. What Harry thought had been the acts of a coward and traitor had been small attempts to actually do the right thing. Harry saw how Draco had rebelled against his families believes and how he paid for it. Harry saw how Draco tried to protect Harry from being exposed and how he got tortured for it. Harry saw so many things he didn’t know about Draco Malfoy until Draco gained back a little strength and control over his mind back and threw Harry out of his memories.
Please tell me what you think should I go in this direction and continue a slow healing process or do you prefer them to be traumatized "beyond repair"? Also sorry for the long wait and the short chapter. I was really unsure where to take this fic... there are so many options and I wanted to satisfy my readers wishes and my own ideas for the fic at the same time. I have personally been trough a lot of traumatizing situations in my childhood and can feel with both of the characters in the fic. Please let me know how you like the new direction.
When Merlin takes out Arthur dripping with salvia he moans at the sight. Without warning he grabs the man’s little arm and pushes it inside his stretched peephole. He fucks himself with the kings arm for a while Arthurs cum easing the way for it but it still isn’t enough. Slightly frustrated Merlin grabs Arthur at his ankles and rests his kings head at his dickhead. He can feel Arthur struggle weakly too exhausted to properly fight the giant man that he considered his loyal friend. With a slow and gentle push Merlin inserts the kings head that is still slick with his salvia. He can feel the king tremble in fear as he pushes him in deep. A long moan escapes his lips as he fucks his dick with his kings body. One hand stroking his cock as he grips Arthur tight. Merlin can feel his own orgasm approach but he can also feel Arthurs fighting weaken. He starts to fear for his kings safety so he protects the man with magic. Arthur might feel like he is running out of air now but he wont die. It does not take long for Merlin to cum now that he knows Arthur will be safe. The force of his cum almost pushes the king out of Merlins dick as Arthur feels like he is drowning as he is flooded with thick semen all around him. This time Merlin does not take Arthur out but holds him firmly in place as he can feel the king squished tightly together by the force of his cum load at one side and his strong hand on the other side holding him forcefully in place. Arthur screams and coughs and struggles but it is of no use. Cum fills his mouth, his throat  and his lungs. His body feels like it’s going to get crushed inside Merlins dick. After a few minutes Merlin finally lets go of Arthur and slowly pulls him out watching the little coughing man gasping for air. H moans as he licks over Arthurs face telling him what a good little toy he is for Merlin. Arthur is to exhausted to answer, as he did not have the time Merlin did to calm down after the orgasm. Merlin looks at Arthur closely unsure what to do with him. He decides to use him as a human dildo taking his own anal virginity with Arthurs body who is properly lubed up with Merlins own cum. He fucks himself with his king for a while when he suddenly hears footsteps approach. Quickly he pushes Arthur all the way inside his ass using him like a plug and gets dressed quickly just in time for some knights of Camelot to come around the corner. He listens to them telling him all about the battle and how Arthur is missing and probably dead. Merlin has to hold back moans as the little king screams and fights inside of him rubbing all over the sorcerers prostate while banging on his inner walls to get out. The brown haired man agrees to help search for the king with the knights.
“So... violence?” Draco asks. Potter groans and rolls the back of his head against the concrete. “Did you kill somebody?”
“Do you?” Draco asks and Harry looks momentarily confused. “…remember everything?”
When she hands him the blanket, Draco can’t remember why he’s asked for it. The worst part is, she asks him how his past
“What is it?” He asks Potter, as if any of this makes any sense at all.
“You know,” she leans forward now. It’s always back and forth with Granger. She puts her elbows on the desk as if she is confiding in him. “This isn’t going to be the same Azkaban that your father is in.”
So – the answer is constant incompleteness. The answer is to stare longingly at every man he sees on the streets. Draco must accept begging with his eyes to be held by everyone he comes into contact with only to flinch away. He’s just supposed enjoy the consistent magical ability, even though it will slowly drive him insane.
“Has she bonded you?” Draco asks Blaise, ignoring the others. His voice has started to crack, just a little, with the new information. Astrid is yelling to her sister about Celeste’s various crazy murmurings near the end.
The sound reverberates through the cell, and Astrid looks at him with anticipation. Draco’s magic activates the runes circle, just as Astrid Yaxley so wanted, but Draco has no plans to break out of this prison. He quickly changes the magic permeating throughout the entire cell to freezing, foul black water. It rises quickly in a smaller room, much quicker than it ever did in Celeste’s suite in Malfoy Manor.
“Draco.” This is the second time she’s used his first-name in the proceedings. It’s odd. “Harry is very powerful but not powerful enough to make a cell explode but with nobody hurt or maimed on the premises. It’s a health condition on
“Draco.” Lucius says, to get his attention. “Mention this at your hearing.”
This older Draco looks nearly identical to a young Lucius but with slightly different bone structure around the jawline. He has a huge bonding bite on his neck.
Potter looks more annoyed than surprised. However, it’s impossible that he could prepare for the stinging slap that Draco gifts him across the face, which Draco didn’t expect himself.
But, for some reason, Draco is unserviceable as an omega. He hadn’t been necessary in the Dark Lord’s regime – which had always been his greatest fear since presenting – and was mostly ignored. The Death Eaters never seemed to pay him any attention, omega or not.
Draco listens to her prattle on about how he’ll be staying with omegas, how he can expect a psychiatrist, how he’ll have a “job” to do every day. Only one part of this is interesting.
“Come here, baby,” Harry says and holds his arms open. When Draco scurries over to him and buries his hand into Dream Harry’s neck it feels real.
“Draco, please, you don’t need all of that –”
He wasn’t a very good model. He had horrible stage presence and was incredibly shy in front of people, resulting in very weird looking photographs of him slouched over on a few editorial pages.
He is sentenced to no more than ten but no less than five years in Azkaban, effective beginning tomorrow. Barnaby is celebrating, as Draco has gotten a “light” sentence. He may even be allowed some privileges (without any explanation of what those are) due to the prison reform bill, expected to pass in the Wizengamot next month. Granger is there rattling off about that, but Draco doesn’t really hear it.
Sometimes when the magic threatens to overwhelm him, Draco is floating instead of sinking. It’s like listening to a language that you can barely speak – so easy to tune out and not understand it. He listens to his magic running beneath his skin like a dam broken and tries to see if he can differentiate it, as he can words.
“Times up, Malfoy Junior, let’s go” the guard says, grabbing Draco’s arm.
Theoretically, this shouldn’t be happening, but Draco is perhaps the only
“The child is more likely to be a beta without an omega influence,” Maleka says, as if this would be a negative thing.
“I don’t know why I bother,” Pansy continues when Draco doesn’t make a move to respond. “Next season you’re not even going to make Calvin Klein.”
“Trial.”
“You know that one?” Potter asks, rolling his head over to the side while leaning against the concrete blocks behind him. It’s a poor attempt for a diversion, but it does throw Draco a little bit. Before he launches further into his interrogation, he realizes that he’s enjoying himself.
“However,” She trails off. She leans back in her chair like clockwork. “If people should know about the issue we've discussed, it may be more difficult to allow you to stay here.”
Lucius hates to speculate. “I think that we can open the portal.” He says, with the authority of a man who has lost sleep over this. “I think we can access it easiest.”
Narcissa speaks first. “Are you aware that you have a giant gash on your face?”
Draco sighs, reminding himself again what he has known for over a decade. Nobody is coming to reassure him it isn’t his fault. It is his fault.
“No, I think he’d like me too much.” Draco says wryly. “I don’t want my life prolonged 300 years by accident.”
Typically, the ministry lackey is Granger. Draco is less surprised to see her than Barnaby (who detests these sort of events) and is certainly shocked to see his mother.
“I can’t, can I?” Draco asks her while Barnaby is distracted with his own joke.
No answer.
“This is a real chance to make some connections,” Pansy says. At the exact same time and in the exact same cadence, older Draco says the same thing. He smiles at his younger self like it’s a joke. He thinks watching his memories like a rerun of
It turns out that Draco has been prescribed the blood let (read: the magic flush) so that he can go to court. Unlike what Draco had thought, it was not a recommendation of a faceless doctor. It was the recommendation of Narcissa, although a welcome suggestion to the Azkaban staff.
“You don’t remember this?” Older Draco asks. Current Draco shakes his head. It feels like a movie he’s watched, not something he’s lived.
never been. I’m not convinced that it exists.”
The reason Draco doesn’t remember the gala is because he had been modeling at the time. A brief foray into fashion – and also muggle drug usage instead of just sale – had done a remarkable job exacerbating his mental health decline.
Harry looks incredibly alarmed at this, moreso than anything else, and takes two large steps back. Rooted to the spot, Draco reaches for him.
Draco feels adrenaline thrashing in every bone of his body. In a moment where Draco should wake up spluttering and shaking, he emerges feeling victorious. He is still alive.
“Oh my god.” That voice is Astrid. “Draco! Why didn’t you tell me you were
In school, they teach all alphas this embrace. It’s supposed to be casual, appropriate for any person and not just one’s mate. It is to be used in stressful situations when an omega’s magic is going out of control, but it is used often. It’s a well-known embrace that Draco recognizes immediately.
No. Is wanting to believe his fantasy exists when he’s legally dead suicidal? He shakes his head.
Lucius is doing a remarkable job of ignoring him. “Do you see me crying every time something goes awry, Draco?”
Draco was not expecting that she paid any attention to his heat schedule, so this comment throws him a little. “What if I’d never fuck you in a million years with or without heat?”
“You sure that’s designer?” Somebody with a deep, gruff voice asks. Draco turns around to see Harry Potter. Of course. “Not just the robes you wore to the Yule Ball in 5th year?”
Instead of the easy fight Draco is expecting, Potter’ face breaks into a wide smile and he laughs. “Of course.” He shakes his head. “I forgot that you remember everything.”
“Then, I will let him be.”
Marius’ hands began to shake the longer he dwelled on that thought. His breathing was coming in short. He could feel his body started to shiver too and the last thing he needed right now was a panic attack. He painstakingly tried to look up in an effort to distract himself. Then he met Harry's gaze.
"Sirius has seen the change in the family tree", Hermione raised his hand to ask a question.
"What is it, Andromeda?" Sirius voiced out, worry laced his voice. Andromeda ignored him and opted to cast a spell on the rune. As soon as the magic touched the rune, she hissed. The magic rebounded back to her. She then turned her eyes to Penelope and pointed at her. "You. Try a tracking spell."
to my beta Authlene thank you as always for everything!!XD
“No one ever uses this place, Marius,” the witch said as she set down the ingredients on the tiled floor. Harry followed suit. He placed the cauldron properly in one corner.
Draco did not even look up at Dumbledore, but the Headmaster was startled when he suddenly spoke.  "Professor, I will do it." Draco's voice was full of conviction that Dumbledore had never heard of him before. "I am going to give him, Hogwarts, and Gryffindor Lands my protection."
He killed Cedric, his Aunt who has an affinity with death showed him that. He can’t think he could live with that. Draco, lost in his darkness, was not able to see the smile his Aunt hid when she eased away from him.
“Narcissa Black is finally dead. The plan to kill Albus Dumbledore is underway.”
"Then trust
Harry watched as Draco wretched himself away from his embrace and held onto his head, his face that of in pain. His grunts of pain were all that Harry could hear. The werewolf had no idea what to do. He kept on asking Draco what was wrong but it seemed like the blonde was lost to the world around him. His ear-piercing screams made the hairs on Harry’s arms stand with fear and worry.
Ron shook his head. “He is my Alpha, Headmaster. I cannot just leave him.”
He lay there sprawled, his forearm covering his eyes from the brightness of the sun's rays. His breathing evened out and he felt the cool wind and the grass prickle his ears as they swayed. He heard footsteps approaching him. Staying oblivious as possible, he waited for the right moment.
He clutched Beau closer to him as he snuggled his head into its fur to comfort himself. He was now alone in the Common Room, waiting for Hermione to show up so that they would begin brewing the Potion for Dumbledore. They hadn’t even found the time to speak to the Headmaster about their plan as he was currently on a business trip.
*im sorry i got the title wrong when i posted the previous title i wrote was supposed to be for the next chapter sorry for that*
The not-Narcissa smile at his direction once again, but this one was full of interest that Marius knew this was not his mother.
Tugging her knees to her chin, she hugged her knees tightly as she felt so alone. One wrong move from her and her Father would die. Her tears flowed freely as she wept for the things she could never have.
“Madam Pomfrey!”
“No”, Draco’s voice was already failing him that he was no longer feeling unsure of what was real and what was not.
He did not realize he was clutching the sheets so tightly until he saw it. He released them slowly and feigned ignorance.
He tucked Draco’s head under his chin and he felt how cold he was. He huffed a breath as he looked down at Harry. He closed his mouth and turned his back as he walked towards the portal that Bellatrix created.
They all stared at a wall with a dozen mini rooms for the owls. The owls who occupied it just stared at them and Hermione began to feel the wall for any kind of latch or switch for the secret door to open. Marius soon joined her. Meanwhile, the two werewolves just watched, as the scent is not allowing them to be much of help.
—he thought and Theo and Blaise looked alarmed. Orion was prepared to attack Longbottom, Blaise and Theo looked prepared to defend him. He was about to pounce when he heard the voice of he human once again.
"He—he's at Hogwarts, right now?" Sirius asked his voice shaking and Albus could do nothing but nod his head. "Could I—" His question was stopped before he could ask it from Dumbledore.
Now, now… He had them back in his arms. His boys, his children. He looked up at Severus and Orion, silently mouthing his thanks to them. He could feel the bond between the three of them, thrumming, but he felt something slightly cutting him off from one of them. He released both of them to stare at them, memorizing their features and committing them to memory since he didn’t know when he would be able to see them again. Draco held their cheeks and both of them held his hand. All he felt was warmth.
, it was written in the report that he was killed just like the others. However the one that piqued their interest most was that the day he died, all the muggle killings with marks like that were all stopped, another was because he was the only magical being killed when all the previous targets killed were muggles. He was the one the previous Aurors who conducted the investigation assessed to be the culprit.
Marius tensed hearing the painful sound his cousin let out. His eyes widened seeing the two people he adored was now about to tear each other apart. He knew he could not stand by any longer. He had to help.
Draco did not spare it another glance as he cast another Patronus so huge that it covered all his allies. He chased away all the Dementors that are crowding upon Harry then recreated another barrier that covered all of them before he began to heal Harry.
"I am not showing it off." Draco could not bear to look up at those eyes in fear of the emotions that are going to be surely seen through his eyes. "You really don't know a thing, don't you?"
dead.” He held Harry’s arms as he looked him straight in the eye. There weren’t any lies in what he had just uttered and he could see the wheels in Harry’s head whirring. "This time, through Orion, we could stop the Headmaster from dying,
"I'm sorry—so sorry." Then Orion heard his own voice broke. He was sobbing profusely and he felt his head being cradled at Clarke’s shoulder. He was being embraced, comforted. He could not stop himself from saying the words repeatedly.
i hope you guys loved this drarry scene and my sudden bomb on who Hermione's mate is as i did writing it. comments and kudos are always welcome and appreciatedXD
“When the werewolves will finally find him, he is as good as ours. Narcissa’s remains will be put to use after all. Until then my Lord, please rest. Until the day I finally have the heads of the Potters, you will truly be free.” She stood up and looked back at her Lord, his eyes drooping and the seal beginning to take its toll.
The grass of the Quidditch field softly danced along the wind as it blew past. Its silence was then interrupted when a loud whoosh was heard in the air. Harry zoomed in as he caught sight of the snitch; he stretched out his hands to catch the evasive gold.
“What assistance could I provide you?”, the woman did not even sat down as she looked straight upon the eyes of Elmore.
“Wh—at?” Hermione’s voice shook with disbelief.
“Wait! At least explain to me what is happening!”
Harry was not able to finish what he was about to say when suddenly his vision blackened and he fell to the ground. He clutched his body closer as he screamed in pain.
“Gladly,” he replied.
“That crest is only given to the members of the Elder’s Vampire Council.”
“Then, how was it like before?”
“They have already completed the passage,” Orion said as he properly sat up beside Pansy and Marius who looked equally curious as Theo. Blaise and Neville also looked at him in wonder. “Once given the mark, as long as you don’t kill someone, you will have to feed from the source.”
“Then why isn’t Hermione giving blood already?”
"Or maybe I just want to lay my claim on you."
“Penny Elmore”
Seeing the situation getting more and more drastic, Draco stood up and turned his back towards Harry. He spoke to those who remained standing to prepare for a fight, his voice loud and clear.
“What do you mean by that?”
After a few minutes the door to his room opened only revealing Head Auror Robards. He gave a sigh of relief as he will finally know of what happened after the incident.
“A male?”, Harry voiced out and Remus nodded at him.
(See the end of the chapter for
as an affectionate gesture of the grumpy vampire as he grinned up at him.
“The first language of magic,” Marius said. He could tell the similarities of the mark and the language he once knew. A small smile appeared on his features.
“They are my friends too, but please understand”, Robards gritted his teeth.
As Professor Snape went to his desk to pick up some books, he turned his head to the sixth year seated next to him and saw that he is currently struggling with his potion. He took a peak at his book and he saw that they are currently brewing the Draught of Living Death. He noticed that the student next to him is about to put another ingredient on his potion, Marius stopped him before he was able to do it.
So, he braced himself for the answer.
“Marius.”
Her eyes were so full of uncertainty, so un-Pansy-like, that it made Theo burst out laughing. Pansy glared at him before she took one of Marius books and slapped it at Theo’s arm.
But he never thought that the Dark Lord was getting impatient at getting his seal removed. He knocked as quick as possible at the door. He was met with a glare as soon as the door opened. However, when Severus saw the sweat in his brow and the ragged breath he was dragged inside quick as lightning.
“As soon as we arrived on the scene, shortly Unspeakables arrived and declared that case theirs. When that case was investigated years ago they did nothing and I have no idea as to why they interfered now.”
Harry sighed at this and shook his head. It was a second later he took notice of how Marius stared at Ron. As if observing him or in the middle of a deep analysis. He saw another change of expression when suddenly, Marius grinned. The human licked his lips, almost sensually that Harry's eyes widened in an instant. A thought registered in his mind and he looked away before he was able to conjure what it is. Fortunately, he was taken out of his reverie when Marius spoke.
“She left a fail-safe, a child!”, Rabastan’s eyes widened at this.
Bellatrix laughed as she clasped her head at the irony of fate. To think that Draco was truly that special. She finally understood why Narcissa was so keen in protecting him.
Orion eyed the human next to him with malice, but the human—Clarke, of course—just grinned at him.
“What is wrong with him?”, Ron whispered at Harry.
The light soon slowly faded.
“Draco?”
Bellatrix's smile turned wicked.
Draco nodded at this and Harry’s hand clenched.
“No, my Lord. He could give you an Heir you truly desire, a power—“ She was interrupted by her Lord’s interested voice.
“I will take the risk as well. I would rather we succeed in this plan than to have the Headmaster dying because if he does…" She looked at Harry.
After Harry left, Orion’s mind then began to think of how deep did Potter fell for his cousin. He scratched his head and shook it as he recalled what transpired at the Whomping Willow. He wondered what would happen if Potter were to find out of his cousin’s true identity and how he would react at that. But Potter is a Werewolf so he clearly had a mate that he just haven’t found yet. He would not allow his cousin to be discarded just as soon as Potter found his damned half.
“So we are going to track a Phantom?”, Ron said sarcasticly, Remus understood this as they all knew the search would be pointless if they do not know what they are searching for.
She clutched at her heart to see the Theo standing up in front of her was Luna, bearing Nymphadora’s triumphant smile. Her eyes widened at the realization, she was scared to look afraid of what she will see. Her eyes stinging with unshed tears, she looked down only to see the peaceful face of Theodore Nott cradled by her.
He was almost there when he felt someone tug the collar of his shirt. When he looked up, he saw Orion’s blank expression. The great Hall was silent as if they were waiting for the next move of the Slytherin Prince. Even the Professors were wary and Snape was pretending not to look by sipping on his goblet. Albus Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled. This indeed was an unusual event. The Slytherin Prince going out on his own to invite another person to their table where no other race but vampires sat.
“Uh Mari did you just memorized the whole room and replicate it?”, and Marius nodded.
“Don’t worry Alpha, Luna, the spell Bellatrix used is powerful and she would not dare any attempt soon…but the wards my blood cannot sustain it alone”
“Orion has been feeding on me.”
“As long as he stays in your Common Room”
The Dark Lord agreed to this and his eyes seem to scan around them. “Dear Draco isn’t here? Whatever happened, Bella?”
Orion then quickly and discreetly took the bracelet from the table. He wore it, not knowing that the spell that was casted on it activated. “Shut up, Blaise. We both know who is the idiot between us.” He smirked at the other vampire as the group then proceeded to sit around the Common Room.
“No, because if we find Draco, we would’ve already found the one who bears it.”
He wanted to know what Marius smelt like. Would he smell of spice? Or of the smell of potions? Or the smell of grass? Or mint? He then stared at Marius’ neck where his scent is strongest. He really wanted to know and curiosity got the best of him. It might be one of the reasons why he felt so drawn to the human enigma.
Both of them stared at each other, one with recognition and one filled with awe and adoration. Draco's eyebrow wrinkled at this as he wondered why were those kinds of emotions in the wolf's eye directed at him currently. He looked down as he then pocketed his wand showing that he meant no harm. The werewolf backed away slightly to show that he meant no harm as well. When Draco was about to go down the tree, his shoes suddenly slipped at the slippery edge of the branch. He watched as the once huge and majestic black wolf suddenly morphed into its human form and in a quick swift, Draco fell into his arms.
Harry growled at Ron in response, eyes unseeing and little by little, they turned animalistic, green irises fading into golden ones. That was a sign that his werewolf side was about to resurface.
. If you know where he is, tell me.”
She began to take a step, but then a wisp of snow began to fall. She looked up at the sky to see that snow is falling upon them. She held out her hand and as soon as the snow fell to her hands, it slightly burned her. She could feel her magic being wasted away by the snow. She watched as the snow continued to fall on the witches that were on her nephew’s side only to see that it did not harm them. Instead, it strengthened them.
She feared that soon some of them will step up and she knew she had to stop it. No voice was coming out of her when she tried to speak up and she touched her neck to realize she had been cursed.
She tucked a strand of Narcissa’s hair in her ear as she continued,
When Orion started fumbling over his words, so-not-Orion-like, Marius took pity of him. He put a hand on his frantic cousin before realizing a soft sigh. “I am not that hopeless, Orion. I can stand on my own. Maybe not against your mother or Dumbledore, but enough. Thank you for caring that much about me, though,” he said with a smile. “But, well, don’t worry. I did not mean it literally. What I meant was to merely conceal who he is, like what I did to myself.”
After their Potions class, Marius went along with Theo and Pansy. The remaining two vampires, Blaise and Orion, went their separate way, heading to the Owlery. Blaise was going to send a quick note to his Mother while Orion was pulled along to join him. The three then found a bench near grounds and despite being a bit chilly, they decided to hang out there. Marius sat next to Pansy while Theo was forced to seat on the ground, placing his books beside him. Marius was about to open a book but Pansy’s eyes on him sure didn’t help him if he were to concentrate reading. He opted to delay said activity as he sat cross-legged to face the female vampire.
“Dumbledore was able to evacuate everyone before you went ballistic. He and Orion was the one who stopped you and brought you here when you were knocked out. Professor Snape pumped you with the antidote all night till you naturally morphed back.”
“Even I did not know who it is”, Sirius stated and Lily traced the name of the child.
Marius was once again at the top of Astronomy Tower, clearing his thoughts of what was to come. His brain was filled with possibilities he thought could happen. The Headmaster’s voice still rang in his mind as clear as day, asking him of the impossible. By giving protection to Hogwarts, it would lead to his identity’s reveal and worse, his aunt might find out about his magic and that is something that cannot happen. He would not allow anyone to make him a tool for this war. He had already caused too much death the day he was conceived.
After that, they went separate ways but before Marius' figure was gone, Harry watched him with eyes of longing. When Marius was no longer to be seen, he headed to the shower room with a smile on his lips.
“That’s enough. Please stop,” Draco pleaded, but Orion wouldn’t listen.
However, that day she understood what it means to be hopeless. It was then she realized her Mother was death itself.
“Mind if I transfigure some of your things here to a cloak?”
He prayed to no one that he would succeed in his promise to the Headmaster that he would protect one of the places that his mother loved. That this place is a beacon of hope for those who have lost it because this is the place where he felt alive.
“I apologize for the scene I have caused,” he said, perfectly prepared to hear a lashing tongue directed at him. Surprisingly, all he felt was a hand patting his head.
Once again, they were engulfed in silence until a few sighs were heard from Harry and he began to speak. “At first, I only tried to get close to him due to him being human, you know,” he started, voice low.
"He is really sharp. In that single interaction, he was able to read Ron's body language."
“Wolfsbane?”
As soon as Harry was out of the room, Orion dragged him to farthest room from Draco's. Harry was surprised at this and his eyebrow rose when they were now alone. He did not want to admit it but he felt a chill on his spine as he then stared at Orion's icy blue eyes full of rage.
“Avada, the constellation will not come upon your calling,” he drawled it in a perfect imitation of Snape. He heard Avada grunted and he looked back at those piercing green eyes.
Bloody hell. He was screwed indeed. Where was that thought come from?! Did Professor Snape whack him hard enough to make him this delirious? Or maybe the house elf put something silly in his meal?
“I intend to follow through my promise to my Mother.” He looked down, fiddling his fingers together no longer feeling any hostility towards Rowena but instead, he felt something akin to a family relationship with her.
“I can hear your mind working from miles away.” A voice, clearly male, was heard.
“Then you have my support, Harry.”
“An enraged Alpha cannot be stopped by anyone other than another Alpha, his mate, or--”, Barty smiled he cracked his neck and placed his hand by his nape as he tried to stand.
“Don’t you know that that is very dangerous? What if you couldn’t stop Orion?” Theo said sternly.
“Draco.”
“No”, she whispered, she scrambled to his arm lifting up his sleeves, only to see a blackened mark. Her hands were shaking but she had to know, the pain in her chest ached so badly that it is possible she did not notice the burn of a similar mark on her arm, now blackened. A mark that she was supposed to cherish as it would lead to her soul.
She frowned, hand fisted in the front of her cloak, right above her chest. "What does that mean?"
Ron swallowed nothing as he was sure the she-devil was doing this on purpose.
Harry then mind-linked all werewolves to evacuate as fast as possible. He watched as at one side of the Hall, the marked ones stood proud and tall protected by a shield cast by the one person that Harry did not expect. Her face was as peaceful as she diffused the barrier and the wind swept across her face. Her blonde hair dancing with the wind, Luna Lovegood stood tall with her wand raised.
“Thank you for accompanying me, though brief, I enjoyed your company”, Marius then walked towards Blaise an the others who were gaping at him in shock, he then rolled his eyes.
Within the confines of Hufflepuff’s dorm, inside the only room being occupied, a single form could be seen crumpled in the middle of what seemed to be a circle written with countless runes all around. Beau watched as his master—the one laying inside the circle—slept soundlessly, prepared to do anything if his master ever ensued an order upon him.
Draco – acting as his past self- hurries away down the hall until it melts back into the kitchen that Draco first stood in.
from Pansy’s balcony for everyone to hear. Perhaps it is a testament to his continued sanity that he doesn’t.
Draco knows how rare withdrawal is, as alphas usually cannot resist omegas. He knows that omegas are built to give children, to provide for their communities. He knows that his bitter anxiety and creeping madness is rooted in needing another person. He needs somebody who claims him, at the very least.
“Can you turn it down a notch?” Potter asks, laying on his back now. “I feel like I’m about to suffocate.”
am merely the spark, the flint
Rage—hot and petulant – steams inside of Draco’s throat until it overflows. “I have no magic! I am alone 24 hours a day!
“You do.” Harry says. “Sort of.”
“Didn’t that happen before too?”
Barnaby paints the same sad, pathetic picture of an omega wallowing away in his prime, feeling threatened by the three other omegas whom he shared a cell with. He outdoes himself with a thrilling narrative of Draco’s trauma from witnessing a murder – one that Draco himself committed – and being forced into cohabitation so quickly. It’s a stunning argument that makes so little sense the silence rings for a moment after Barnaby finishes his closing argument.
Somehow, murdering Dolohov is considered a non-violent offense when an omega does it.
That’s that on that.  Granger decides that Draco will return to his omegas wing as long as he is “no longer a threat” and continues to “monitor his own magic.” Another year will be added to his sentence. Granger spends the last fifteen minutes discussing the new plans for the prison and a sponsorship deal with Sleakezy’s hair potions where Draco can pursue manual labor for free, another incredible way to throw his magic into the universe and never get it back.
“Slow down,” she cautions. “You know I don’t give omegas drinks in heat.”
Absurdly, and embarrassingly, this comment makes Draco’s eyes sting. Draco craves affection and approval just as much as anybody. Lucius is typically the most understanding. Of all of the idiots he has seen in the past few days, Draco assumed his father would read between the lines of the broken parole drug dealer story. From this loaded conversation, Draco is even more upset that his stupid tears are such a classic omega trait.
Past Harry wobbles alarmingly where he stands. Draco, his eyes rabbit quick from snorting the cocaine he was meant to drop off, doesn’t make a move to catch him. Suddenly, Draco’s memory returns full force.
“She doesn’t visit you?” Draco asks, suddenly feeling heartsore for poor Blaise even though he’s still entertaining the stupid runes circle idea.
. Dutifully, Draco holds out his hands and waits for them to click in place. Barnaby struggles with the clasp, and Narcissa shoots him a look as if Draco’s handcuffs are the height of inconvenience.
Draco quickly recovers from the heart palpitation this news gives him, and grins. “Not only a cold-blooded murderer but an extremely powerful one!” He puts his hands across his forehead to appear as if he’s swooning.
Draco’s hands are shaking. In a moment of desperation, he thinks about reaching over and touching Barnaby, to ground himself. He feels like he might throw up. “No.”
“Baby, I haven’t even convinced you this is a real place.” He sounds so upset about it.
“I’ve seen you do it.”
I know it's been months, I have no explanation lol
“How did you know that story?” Potter asks, menacingly.
“She sucks up his magic!” Astrid says scratching her grossly overlong fingernails across the paint to make the necessary symbols. “He’s completely useless after she comes! How are we supposed to break out if one of us has no extra magic!”
“The door?” he asks, surmising what the metal sound is going to be.
He’s not an asset to anybody either.
“What a load of shite!” Astrid is saying somewhere in the background and Draco tries to let her screechy voice carry him away. “Who told you that? Mama? I’ve always said she went completely detruit in the end!”
Draco vaguely remembers this night. It was an “honor” to be invited (per Lucius) and a “shame” it was because of his “silly hobby” (per Narcissa). In reality, Draco had been invited to drop a suitcase of coke in the ministry bathroom for a high-ranking transportation official. He can’t remember which one.
Draco woke up late in the afternoon. His back hurt like hell and he was a little hungry already. On the table next to him was a not and a little package. The note said Draco was supposed to get dressed for dinner this afternoon with Harry, he was going to pick him up. In the lobby at 8 pm and he was free to do whatever he pleased in the meantime. Draco should be happy. But he wasn’t especially when he saw what was inside the package.
Somehow Harry had managed to get lost when he started to wander around to get a free head and a blank mind. He had wanted to walk back to the hotel that actually wasn’t too far away from the party but what started as simply walking and trying to free his mind turned into running and screaming inside to make all the voices inside shut up. So somehow Harry had managed to get lost and he was in Diagon Alley. Harry looked around to find his way back. He actually asked some of the last few wizards and witches on the streets for directions but they were not really helpful. Then Harry saw something that caught his eyes. A few witches in a back alley dressed very let’s call it different. Harry was standing there under the Hood of his cloak staring in their directions. Some of the witches moved a little around trying to gain his attention buy mumbeling arousing sentences but Harry wasn’t that much into that kind of business. He wanted to leave when a woman with long blonde hair and heavy make-up walked straight up to him. “Are you lost – honey?” Harry freezed in place like he was hit by a curse. He knew that voice even if it was slightly higher pitched and sounded a little horse he knew that voice. He would recognize that voice anywhere. “Malfoy?” he asked unable to move unable to barely recognize that face under all that paint in this dark alley at 4 o’clock in the morning. But still he was sure. It wasn’t really a question. Harry saw the confusion and the embaresmment in his grey eyes. Yes it was him. He threw back the hood of his cloak to get a better view and looked Malfoy straight in the eyes. Yes it was him even if his face was painted with tonnes of make up und grief and desperation, cheap false hair falling over his shoulders and body thin no not thin boney, no starving – it was him that hooker was Draco Malfoy.
Merlin has had it. For years he had been serving a spoiled little prince and his only to hope to shape Arthur into a great king made him kept going. Now that he had left Gwen and actually ruled after his fathers death nothing seemed to have changed. Merlin was so done with cowering at Arthurs feet never being appreciated always treated like shit, after all he did for his prince and now king who actually acted more like a childish princess than anything else. Arthur was never going to be a good king. All of Merlins efforts had changed anything about that and he was really tiered of keep trying it. In his dreams he took matters into his own hands and crownd himself the new King of Camelot, but what to do with Arthur. Merlin had dreamed about Arthur before over the years how could he not. Arthur with his sensual curves and exquisite butt, his plush lips that would look so lovely around Merlins hard cock. Merlin had dressed Arthur for years seen him naked a hundred times how could he not have noticed the almost feminine beautiful body of his prince and now king. In his mind a cruel plan formed. But Merlin had to be careful what he was going to do would take time, great power and a lot of planning. He had to get even stronger and he had to research a lot of dark magic in order to fulfill his desires. During that time it was almost unbearable for him to keep serving Arthur but his thoughts at night kept him going.
So I will post every prompt that I fill as one chapter if it is a one shot or maybe as an extra work if a plan to make it a longer fic but I will let you know how it will be done. This might sometimes take a while. I am only filling prompts that I feel comfortable writing so please read the tags they are my limits. Of course you can ask for more specific fics but I can not guarantee you that I will fill them. I only write these fandoms and pairings because I know them well (enough) to feel comfortable writing about them. Except for the bts fandom, where I fill all pairings - I will not answer prompts that ask me to write pairings that I have not listed.
Harry has been wandering the streets for ages now. He had left the reopening party at the Weasly’s shop early as he could not stand all the happy and cheerful people around. It has been two years but for Harry Potter, war-hero, golden boy, the pure good it felt like he never woke up from a bad dream. The war had changed him and he could not stand all this anymore. There was nothing to be happy about, so many people died. He had even killed himself. He was not the same anymore. He was not a boy anymore. He was not the good guy anymore. And Harry Potter was definitely not a hero.
The dark haired wizard let his gaze wander over the peaceful sleeping one of the blonde man. He looked cozy and warm and even a little happy. His face was warmed by a light smile, his blonde hair looked almost angelic – how it framed his peaceful gaze. Draco Malfoy looked like he was in heaven and Harry Potter was going to change that.
The smell of burning flesh, the sizzling sound of the burning iron - it brought back childhood memories for Harry. It reminded him of home and of happy times. Over the years he had learned to love the smell and the sound and right know he could almost feel the burning sensation of hot iron being pressed into soft skin and being ripped back out. Because what always followed the pure agony was caring, soft hands that tended his wounds and a welcoming brake from all the pain and the hurt. Harrys happiest childhood memories were linked with that smell, that sound and that feeling. I smile of pure joy was painted on his face while the face of a certain blonde young man was painted with pure horror. Draco felt like he would fall apart. He had never seen Harry Potter look more delighted and he had never felt more pain than he did right now. The Cruciatus  curse was nothing compared to this. How could he enjoy his pain so much, how could have Draco been so mistaken about Harry’s character.
I am takeing prompts for darker fics (including the tags). But I am also open to lighter fics or a mixture. It will be mainly with a lot of plot. Also I will not fill every prompt. If I fill your prompt I will let you know in the comments. Please read the tags and also tell me if you have something (like one of the tags) you don't want to have in the fic for you.
After 3 more hours the stop searching and decide to go back to Camelot. Maybe the king had escaped to his castle. Merlin needs to hold back a smirk as he sits on the horse. Arthur had stopped struggling an hour ago inside his ass but he can still feel the king rub all over his prostate with every move. When the finally arrive at Camelot hours later Merlin is a little sore but extremely satisfied. After the castle was searched but Arthur still was nowhere to be seen they decide to rest for now and keep searching tomorrow. Merlin eagerly sprints to his room and gets the passed out little man out of his ass quickly. He plays a little with the unresponsive little body a little worried that he maybe went too far. But then Arthur gasps for air and opens his eyes. “Merlin….please….turn me back….please don’t hurt me.” Merlin just chuckles as he hungrily looks down at his delicious king. He starts to wash his little sextoy as he listens to the kings pleas. “Why would I you are perfect like this Arthur like a little doll. Arthur you were made for this!” He moans as he dries the king. “I …I will never forgive you….Merlin! I trusted you…you where my closest friend….you will pay for this when I am…” Merlin cuts the king of pressing his lips on the smaller mans ones. “Oh Arthur…. You don’t have to forgive me… because you are never going to be the same again. You are not a king anymore. You are my plaything now and your only purpose will be to service and pleasure me.” Merlin chuckles. “ I am never going to turn you back my sweet little treat!” Merlin licks away the fresh tears streaming down Arthurs face moaning loudly. “Fuck Arthur you taste so good!” He says as he pushes his magically protected king inside his mouth. “ I want all of you!” The sorcerer says as he plays with Arthurs naked body slightly chewing on him again. He can feel warm piss trickle down his throat as Arthur pees himself again inside Merlins mouth. He can’t hold back a moan as he saviors the flavor before gulping down Arthur fully as he knows nothing will happen to him as long as Merlins magic protects him. Arthur tastes exquisite and Merlin cums all over himself while the struggling king slips down his throat.
Draco dreamed of nights of pure horror old and new. About a month ago one customer had been extra cruel. It was a man that Draco seemed to recognize but couldn’t really but together exactly who he was. Draco had learned that the man was a former Hufflepuff who was 3 years older than him, he had occasionally seen him at school. Draco also learned with his face being smashed into the wall while he was fucked at a furious pace and slapped for a hundred times on his rare end that that guy had also lost is younger sister at the war of Hogwarts and of course he blamed Draco for it. They always did.
His day had finally arrived. After weeks of planning he finally had all the ingredients and curses together. He had practiced all of them at least once on villagers and prisoners in order to not make any mistakes it would be hard and take time to make Arthur into a perfect woman but that wouldn’t stop Merlin. Once Arthur would give up fighting the curse would be able to take its full potential and make him into a perfect woman. But first Merlin had to perform a great memory charm on all of Camelot telling the people that Uther had a daughter that he deperatly tried to make into a prince by naming her Arthur and dressing her like a boy because he couldn’t stand having no son. Merlin put the thought in people’s mind that now that the old cruel king was going Arthur would be finally free to be himself and Merlin would make sure of that. Next he went into Arthurs chambers like he did every morning to get his king dressed. He brought with him a glass of wine filled with a turning charm that sadly only could take full potential once he person who drank it accepted it. It would take Merlin probably a while to convince Arthur but this was the safest option all the other curses and charms he had tried out on mainly prisoners had bad side effects when they fought the transformation. Some of them even died during the process and Merlin did not want that to happen. He woke Arthur up and gave him the glass. Arthur took it still sleepy and a little confused, Merlin never brought him anything to drink before he got dressed but who was he to deny himself a good glass of wine? Merlin watched Arthur drink the whole glass in one go and smiled. It took first effects right away and Merlin licked his lips in excitement. Arthur looked like he was dizzy and sat down on the bed. His hands got smaller and thinner as did his muscular thigs. His face lost a little of its sharp edges but stayed mainly the same. The biggest change now wasn’t seen through Arthurs sleeping clothes but Merlin knew that he must have felt it by the look on Arthurs face. Merlin chuckled darkly and slowly pushed Arthur on the bed. “Merlin…what is going on, what are you doing…” Merlin just shushed him and started to rip off Arthurs clothes to get to his prize. Like he had assumed Arthurs cock and balls had shrunken to a ridiculous size. They were so small like a childs. Arthur tried to fight Merlin off, cover himself and push his servant away. Of course he couldn’t. The curse had taken away most of his body strength. Merlin was so much more powerful than Arthur, who was babbeling nonsense, of course he was confused as Merlin did not change Arthurs memories only the memories of everyone else. Tears started to form in Arthurs eyes. Merlin smiled and leaned down to kiss him, whipping away the tears with one hand while forcing Arthur closer with his other. “Shush now don’t cry soon you will be a beautiful woman and queen and I will be your Master and King. Now be a good girl and kiss me, love.” Arthur tried with all his might to push Merlin away, but it was of no use. Merlin hold him tight and forced his lips on Arthurs. Slightly biting and linking his lips before pushing a tongue into the other mans mouth. Arthur did not except being a woman just yet but Merlin would make sure he did. The curse even made Arthur able to bare an heir for his new king Merlin so as soon as Merlin knocked Arthur up for good with a baby Arthur would definitely except his fate and become the perfect mommy.
Memories of horrible times flashed through him. Weeks of being locked in a closet under the stairs only getting food every 3 days for he was not good enough at pretending that he did not exist. It had started early. He remembered being put their when he was still a toddler. Uncle Vernon had given a poker game with friends at his living room and as a punishment he had gagged Harry in the closet for 9 long hours no food, no water, no toilet. He had been bound so he couldn’t trash around either. Because last time when Vernon had friends over Harry got scared alone in the dark for so long that he came out and started to cry. This time Vernon had made sure that he would not get disturbed.
Maybe there was no good and bad. Everyone consists of choices some good and some not so good and at one point there is no turning back. Or maybe there is. Isn’t everyone capable of doing good and bad things. Didn’t his mother take him to trips where he had watched her inflict pain on muggles. But also didn’t his mother protect him as good as she could from being tortured. Didn’t his mother once stopped some of the other death eaters from torturing a muggle child because she said it was wrong, it was just a child. She did good, she did bad. Maybe he was the same. Maybe Potter was the same. They all did good and bad things. No Potter only did bad things to Draco. Sectum Sempra, Nasty words in the school halls, hands around his throat while fucking him raw cracking bones and Crucio. No Potter only did bad things to Draco. He had saved him though during the war when everything was in flames, he had testified for him in court via owl, he had let him slept in his bed when he was cold. Malfoy was confused and he hurt so much. Maybe he did deserve this maybe he didn’t at some point Draco stopped wondering whether he deserved this, stopped trying to understand what was happening to him and why and stopped blaming himself or Potter and just drifted off to a uncomfortable sleep.
Draco dreamed of nights of pure horror old and new. When he was 9 years old his father had taken him to a meeting with friends – all former death eaters. They had teased him for how ‘pretty’ he was. When his father had left to get something they had talked about how Draco would look more like a girl than a boy. Later that night they had put him into a dress of one of their daughters. They were all drunk. They made him dance. They made him cry. It was the first time he had felt the Cruciatus curse. Laughter had filled the air paired with his screams. The pain had been all consuming. Ha had not known what he did wrong he had not known who he was or where or when. All he had known was that he would do anything to make that pain stop and never feel it again. His father had not said a word during all of it. And when they left to get home all he hissed at Draco was “stop acting like a childish girl, men up.” Draco had cried himself to sleep that night and most of the following nights for weeks.
BTS kidnapping prompt fill for Yonogi. This is only a Prologue. I will post this fill as a full work with multiple chapters. Go to my other storys if you are interested in this prompt fill.
This man in his bed was a traitor, he was a coward, he was weak. Harry was strong, he was in control and Draco Malfoy did definitely not turn on Harry Potter. This was punishment nothing more. This was revenge.  “I asked you a question slut.” How dare he did not answer his Master. Draco Malfoy was a useless street hooker, a weak slut. Traitor, Coward – all his fault – he had to pay – Harry would make him pay. “Yes I did.” Slap. How dare he. Harry was furious – no – he was out of his mind. “Master. I am sorry. Yes I did, Master.” Harry made his fingers wander over his newly created artwork of slight bite marks. This wasn’t enough. It wasn’t. He would make him pay. His Fingers found the soft lace of the panties that hid the still soft cock of Draco Malfoy beneath them. Harry had to be inside of him right now. Harry Potter was rock hard. With one motion he ripped his own Pyjama pants down will ripping the lace panties aside. In a split second he was inside his prize. Harry Potter was inside of Draco Malfoy. And it felt so good. He hadn’t fucked anyone for so long. And Draco was tight and warm and made him rock hard and. No - he was not turned on by Draco Malfoy. This was punishment – this was revenge. “Scream for me slut. I want to hear you.” Harry said while fucking into the body beneath him with a brutal pace. He wanted to rip him to pieces. He wanted to hear him scream. Silence.
Draco was confused he just stood their shivering unable to do anything. “Don’t make me repeat myself Malfoy or you will regret it!” Harry said in a much darker voice and Draco immediately moved and slipped under the blanket. And he drifted off to sleep so easily with a full stomach and finally a warm and cozy feeling.
Memories of horrible times flashed through him. Memories of the night his parents died brought back by the dementors that tortured him in 3rd year. Memories of Cederic Diggory dying, of Sirius dying, of Dumbledore dying, of Dobby dying. Flashbacks of hundreds of people he had seen tortured and killed through Voldemort’s eyes. Almost every night when he went to sleep during school times after 4th year he had wandered into Voldemort’s body during sleep. He had seen him torture children, women, men he had seen him kill hundreds of people and it always felt like he did it. Harry always felt like a murderer. Blood on his hands. Blood of innocent people, of friends, of family.
It almost felt good. Harry did hit Dracos prostate once in a while. And he moaned in such a seductive way, like Draco was the best feeling in the whole world. But he hurt so bad. Dracos cock somehow managed to get semi hard and when Harry felt the almost unnoticeable twitching he snapped a little. His hand grabbed Dracos member forcefully. “ You are such a sick slut Malfoy. After all this you are still enjoying this you whore.” Harry almost brutally massaged Dracos cock and somhow brought him to full erection. “You are such a masochist little slut. Is it because you love my you sick little fag? Do you enjoy getting fucked by your hero like the cheap whore that you are?” With one hand he slapped Dracos face hard while he set for a more brutal pace. With his other hand he kept getting Draco off. “No…” Tears streamed down Dracos face again and Harry licked them away coming inside of Draco while still pumping his cock with one hand. “No? Then why are you rock hard huh? Dirty lying slut. You enjoy this. You want this. You offer yourself for a living what kind of a cheap dirty freak does that huh?” Harry slipped out off Dracos ass, cum and blood trickling out of Malfoy slowly. The dark haired wizard slowly let go of Dracos member and took a step back looking at Draco. “Slut” he just said. Draco listened to the footsteps getting softer and the louder again. He felt something hard enter him from behind fucking in and out of him like Potter just did moments ago. “What you never used this on yourself? Oh right I forgot you don’t really have that many muggle things around in the wizarding world.” Potter laughed lowly while fucking the hard object in and out of Draco shifting the leaking cum mixed with blood around in Dracos hole. With his free hand Harry grabbed Dracos still mainly hard cock again pumping it like a mad man. “Don’t you want to come for your master, pet?” Draco couldn’t say anything couldn’t cry anymore he was exhausted. He couldn’t even shake his head anymore. He just wanted it the end. The pleasure that was starting to build up in him wasn’t his. He didn’t want it. It just consumed him. Then his whole body started to vibrate in uncontrollable pleasure that exploded inside of him, hitting his prostate over and over again. And Potters hand pumping his dick faster and faster until he came all over himself and Potters hand. It was almost painful. The vibration stopped but the large object filling him stayed in place keeping the cum from leaking out. “It’s a vibrating plug, very useful object for this kind of business. I thought a hooker with have experience with these kind of toys.” Harry let go from Dracos now limb member and put his fingers to Dracos mouth. “Lick them clean slut” Draco just did like he was told he wasn’t strong enough to fight anymore.
Kreacher had prepared everything his master had wished for during the day. Harry took Draco to his bedroom first. At the floor right at the end of Harrys bed was a metal cuff attached to the floor for Draco. And next to the bad was a metal cage with a small blanket and one little pillow. For when Draco was good. Afterwards Harry led Draco downstairs to the Dungeons for when Draco was bad. Malfoy could not believe what he was seeing this wasn’t a life it was a prison, probably worse than Azkaban. Harry looked at Draco and licked his lips. “Now Malfoy are you going to be a good whore or do have to punish you on your first day?” Draco got on his knees on the cold floor of the Dungeon. “I will be good master I promise.” Harry just laughed and turned around leaving Draco on the cold floor. For two hours Draco didn’t dare to stand up unsure what he was supposed to do. He was cold so shivering slightly he went back upstairs to Harrys bedroom. Potter was already asleep. The cage was locked and Draco was so cold. How bad would it be if he would crawl into the huge bed just for a few minutes to get warm. No Potter would probably kill him for that. He could not risk that. Slowly Draco was lying down on the floor next to the bed still shaking. “What do you think you are doing?” Draco yelped slightly “ I am sorry master I wasn’t sure what to do I thought.. I am sorry … I” Harry just cut him off. “Get in bed Malfoy. It’s freezing I don’t want you catching a cold.”
Harry was more than just confused. He was sad. He was angry. He was relieved. Somehow seeing all of this made him feel like he wasn’t alone – like someone would understand. But it also made him feel sick. Draco was broken just like him, or maybe more. The dark haired wizard trembled slightly as the realization hit him. What he did to Draco it wasn’t just bad. It was traumatizing. It was exactly what happened to him as a child. Harry had tortured Draco in the exact same way that he was being treated all his life. He had made Malfoy feel the same pain. Green eyes focused on red letters burned into silky white skin. PROPERTY. Harry had marked the blonde wizard in front of him like cattle or even worse like a slave. Tears streamed down his blood stained cheek without Harry realizing it. He just saw his worst memories knowing that Draco saw them too. Somehow he was relieved to finally share the horrors of his life with someone but he was also shocked at the same time. Shocked from the realization of what he has become, how he had turned into the exact same monster that had tortured him all his life. The dark haired wizard could not stop his body from trembling while more tears streamed down his face, mouth slightly opened but unable to form words. Nothing he could say could excuse his actions or make this situation bearable.
Draco didn’t cry anymore, he didn’t shiver nor did he whimper. He just wanted it to end. Harry couldn’t stop staring at this wonderful painting. He took a step closer and felt this perfection with his bare hands. Slowly he let his hands explore the body before him. The dark haired man licked his lips, tasting blood on them. He looked down on himself. Small drops of blood stained his clothes all over. Harry took in his rock hard member through his all too tight jeans. Slowly he dropped his clothes, never stopping to tenderly caress Dracos abused body. Draco didn’t see any of this. His teary eyes stared blankly down onto the blurred grey stone floor sprinkled with the remains of his clothes. Draco didn’t feel the tender touch on his burning skin. His whole body felt numb. But Draco suddenly did feel the big cock filling him up from inside and he did see the lust in those green eyes when Potter set for an almost tender pace, fucking him dry yet again.
Harry woke up early in the morning. He had slept for probably only two hours maybe three. The first thing he did was taking a look at his whore. With a smile on his face he saw the lightning scar and his initials. He licked his lips this was going to be the perfect revenge. For a moment regret shot through him while he watched Draco sleep so peacefully. No he deserved this. Draco Malfoy was a monster, a coward. He was the reason for so many deaths. He deserved this. The black haired man turned around and without making a sound he disappeared. He went to grimmold place first ordered Kreacher to get everything he needed for his new servant. And afterwards he did some work, mainly answering letters. This was his life now. He didn’t really become an auror like he always wanted to be. Well he did but he actually did not work as one. He worked as Harry Potter – Hero of a nation. He smiled for cameras used products he got for free or even got payed for and told people what they wanted to hear. In newspaper interviews, the radio or TV. He simply was a celebrity like he had always been. Only know he did not try to run from it any longer he did what people expected from him ignoring the darkness that was consuming him from the inside. He was Harry Potter, a hero, the golden boy, the good man.
When Merlin decides it is save to turn Arthur back he sits down hidden deep in the forest. He decides to turn himself into his young self so he won’t scare Arthur too much. He changes back from his old form and turns into the servant and friend Arthur trusts. He opens his hand and carefully places Arthur on a tree stump. When Merlin lets go of the small king he stares up at him in a mixture of disbelieve, fear and betrayal. Merlin wants to say something to calm Arthur but his hand feels awkwardly sticky. He opens and closes it trying to figure out what’s wrong when he sees the wet spot between Arthurs thighs. The little king has pissed himself. For whatever reason Merlin can’t take his eyes of the blonde little man before him. He slowly puts his hand closer to his face inhaling the scent of his king, a low moan escaping his lips before a tongue darts out of his mouth licking his hand clean. The smell and taste of Arthur turns him on so much he can already feel himself hardening. Arthur trembles even more as he watches Merlin in confusion and disgust. “Merlin…” he says with a shaking voice one tear rolling down his cheek as he looks up to his gigantic servant and closes friend. Merlin picks him up quickly. “shshsh don’t be scared Arthur. You are safe. I made sure of it.” Arthur struggles in Merlins hand hard trying to break free from the light grip. “what…what is going on Merlin?” the king almost screams. The sorcerer tilts his head to the side as he brings Arthur closer to his face inspecting him. “Arthur…” he moans as he takes in more of the kings scent. “ I am so sorry…that you had to find out this way…but I had to protect you!” Merlin looks down hungrily at the small man in his hand trembling and fighting in his palm. Another moan escapes his lips as he feels Arthur fight him, so weak and helpless. The sorcerer licks his lips. “Arthur… You wetted yourself…I am so sorry I scared you…let’s get you out of this before you catch a cold in those wet pants….” Merlins rips away the armor and clothes of his king as thoughts about his helpless king flood his mind. When he takes in the full sight of the little mans naked body he shivers in lust. Slowly he puts Arthur to his mouth carefully licking over his naked body, cleaning him. Arthur screams and fights with all he can but its hopeless as Merlin is so much bigger than him. Merlin moans and pushes Arthurs body almost fully inside his mouth sucking hungrily at him. “don’t worry Arthur…I will clean you up … you are safe with me…don’t struggle so much you might get hurt!” Merlin says around Arthurs body as he plays with the naked man in his mouth letting his tongue caress all of Arthur. The kings screams for help are muffled as Merlin closes his mouth around Arthur feeling him struggle inside.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hot burning pain shot through his body. Draco did not know where he was. His hip was burning. He tried to get away from the pain but he wasn’t able to move. He was bound, no he was chained to a wall. Right. His eyes had to get used to the light that was shining all too bright compared to the embracing darkness from before. Draco squirmed and screamed. He cried and struggled with all his mind. He had never felt pain like this before. This was something new that he couldn’t name yet. His eyes found Harrys. A green burning glow that looked almost soulless. And in these green orbs, these green deep fields of pain he saw a reflection of himself. Dracos gaze wandered down his body to his hip bones. All his clothes he had worn before were laying beneath him a mess of ripped fabrics undefinable of what they had been before. Steaming iron was pressed onto his right hip bone and with an unsatisfying sizzling sound it exposed a horrible picture. Draco almost had to gag when a wave of a scent like from a barbeque reached his nostrils. This wasn’t some delicious food, like an oven roast for Christmas. This was his burning skin. His eyes began to water when he finally was able to put together the letters that had been burned into his sensitive skin slightly above his cock on the right side of his hip. PROPERTY.
“Kreacher, where is Malfoy?” Harry asked in a low but dangerous voice.
A hard slap was the first thing Draco felt when Potter came back. Then he was shoved against the wall. “ What were you thinking? Are you trying to upset me that much? Didn’t I tell you to wait for me upstairs? Can’t you even follow orders properly you useless slut? That must be why your side lost the war apparently Voldemort wasn’t so good at leading. You can’t even follow simple directions stupid whore!” Draco pushed Harry off of him. Furious himself. “Sorry Potter. That I wasn’t good at pretending that I don’t exist. Whatever that kind of a bullshit order that was. Maybe my presence is just too strong to ignore it! And by the way I think you forgot a thank you in between those insults!” Harry laughed dryly and pushed Malfoy hard against the wall again. “ Really? What should I thank you for? Thank you that you got me in this stupid situation with Hermione. Thank you that she is going to get on my nerves now about you. Thank you that she now knows that you are here with me, that I have to find explanations for that. Thank you for what exactly Malfoy?” The blond haired man shook his head in frustration. “Are you really that blind Potter? I just saved your sorry ass. Would you have liked it better if she knew what really happened. Miss super clever over there would have digged up everything and you know that. Would you rather have a discussion with her whether she agreed if you have fucked me properly and hard enough or if the unforgivable curse that you threw at me was performed perfectly enough. She would probably have a strong opinion about some of you sadistic character twists. “ Harry was breathing heavily. He pointed his wand at Draco who prepared for the pain. “So why didn’t you?” Draco opened his eyes. He didn’t even remembered closing them when he prepared for the curse to hit him. “What?” Harry dropped his hand with the wand slowly and sighed. “ Why didn’t you tell her what really happened. Why did you cover for me. I don’t get it. I did these horrible things to you. I just treated you like shit for two days straight. Why didn’t you tell her that?” Draco looked at Potter for a moment. “I am not sure. Maybe because I think you are just as broken as I am. I saw you sitting at the table crying to yourself. You are going through some stuff too. Maybe it was because I somehow feel like I deserve to be punished, that it isn’t your fault but mine.” Dracos voice started to crack a little and it trembled slightly with his next words. Opening up seemed like the only option he had now if he wanted to fix things but it felt like it was impossible. “And maybe because you were my idol, my hero in school. I was always jealous of you. Your friends your popularity. The love everyone had for you. Since first grade until someday understood that I might have a slight crush on you as well maybe that’s why…” Slap. Harry pushed him hard against the wall again. “I hate you, Malfoy. I despise you. I …” Draco kissed him. Easy as that. It took him everything to do that. And Harry Potter actually kissed him back.
“What did you do?” he seethed.
He could feel it, the locks of something dark within him was rattling so loudly that he could not hear the voice of anyone in the room as he began to breathe heavily, his body full on shaking that he was wondering how he was still standing. The darkness of his self that he kept from ever appearing was trying their hardest to appear from its box where Draco trapped them in his mind.
Harry blinked. And blinked some more. “Oh,” he deadpanned. “Thank you, mate.” He then released the fork that no longer looked like its usual form. It was contorted in an inhumanly possible way that Harry was sure he could not fix. “Hm. I didn’t realize they have such fragile utensils here,” he tried to reason out, but Ron snorted.
“Yes Headmaster”, then the portkey activated and he disappeared.
The werewolves were no longer fazed by her actions as they were used to this. The Centaurs, however, were looking at her as if she was insane. Their eyes defiant as Bellatrix stood up to look down upon them, daring them to refuse her previous question.
Then without any warning and seeing that Marius was about to speak, he rested his head on his shoulder and he sought the soft spot of Marius' neck. Snuggling his nose there, taking in his nonexistent scent.
“—of  you—“
All of them stood frozen. They stared wide-eyed at Dumbledore who just looked at them as if pleading to keep what he just said a secret to themselves.
“Wait!” Ginny screamed as the vision became dark and tears rolling down her cheeks, a dozen questions in her mind.
“So please, where is he?”
Harry’s words froze the whole room and immediately Orion’s head snapped towards Marius. His eyes met his cousin’s and a small smile was given to him. An assurance. Orion looked away, hiding his panic as he heard those words.
She looked up at Albus, her eyes pleading for something, trying to convince herself that it was just a made up story by old crazy cronies in her family. However, the old vampire could only close his eyes and Lily now knew that the story she had read was real.
“Beau go with Izzy for now, then maybe if I get accepted I will ask the Headmaster if I can take you with me”, Beau lolled his tongue and barked at him and this made him smile, a sudden pop made him look away from Beau only to see Izzy.
and once again thank you to you all who gave this a read, left kudos, subscribed, and bookmarked this story! hope you guys enjoy this chapter!XD
“Shall we change the setting then?”
“He and Neville will be meeting us in front of Hufflepuff.”
"It is possible that Bella has one as she knows about this myth as well since the Black Family never once told a story that was never real." Sirius ruffled his hair at the horror that Bella held one of the most powerful objects known to them.
“Shh,” Blaise stopped him from spluttering any more than he did. Neville blushed fully that he looked down once again in embarrassment.
“I am glad you are awake Potter”, Robards voiced out as he approached Harry. He patted his shoulder and released a huge sigh, Harry was confused but when Robards spoke again he used the tone of voice he uses when it is work-related.
Andromeda inwardly smiled at this.
All eyes snapped to Sirius who leaned back against the wall as he massaged his temples to ease a headache growing there.
“Tell me what I can do,” he said determinedly.
“I would hug you right now, Hermione, but formalities had to be upheld.” Hermione shook her head at this and smiled. “My name is Pansy Parkinson and this is Blaise Zabini. We are a part of the late Albus Dumbledore’s Order.”
Marius almost snorted at that. “Oh, I did, didn’t I?” he mocked. Orion tried to open his mouth again to argue, but Marius quickly shoved his hand to him again irritably. “Save your breath, will you? We are all know that’s not what I meant. Just,
“How about Nympadora? Isn’t she you heir?” The Dark Lord remained sceptical at what she is asking.
Marius sighed in defeat. “I meant, Harry…” His eyes easily found those green orbs again. They were still shining despite the place they were in. again,
"Yes. It's just a small bruise anyway." With a few words, she waved her hands and they were all gone. Along with the forming bruise on his wrist.
“But you need to head there firstly in order to take exams for them to make sure that you can catch up with their studies, will that be alright with you?”, Marius smiled at this and nodded.
I want to thank all of you who have read, left kudos, comments, subscribed and all your loving supports it means a lot to me so thank you again!XD
“Your Mother is really good. I have to say,” he voiced out but did not stop his pace.
Orion turned back to see the one who talked back to him and stared down. “Potter and his puppies are coming.”
Marius just looked at the Headmaster as if knowing what he meant. He gave a small grin.
“Oh Mr. Clarke you may leave your baggage here and just take some parchments and quills”, Marius nodded then opened his bag to pick up those he needed and followed the Headmaster out of his office.
It took the cooperation of several departments to track down all of his clients and obliviate and cure them from the effects of the pseudo-love potion, which they learned to be harmful to the muggles especially if overdosed. Mcnair did not have the necessary ingredients for the potion so he improvised and those improvisations led to eleven muggle deaths.
please tell me what you guys thinkXDthanks!
“She is the only lead we have, let’s take it”, Harry voiced out as he then ran up the stairs to change his pajamas leaving Hermione and Ron in the kitchen.
Orion's fangs flashed, his eyes dangerously turning red. Marius turned a worried glance at him and he calmed himself by breathing.
“Uh, care to explain?” Harry said when he could feel a headache began to form from all these confusing questions.
“Young man you can stop staring you know”, she regarded Harry and he just spluttered an apology.
He kept crying and crying even though he knew he couldn't do anything. Then he saw a familiar pair of shoes in front of him. When he looked up, he saw it once again. He saw the mirror of himself—the other him—looking like how he remembered himself looked when he slaughtered a whole village in revenge for the death of his past love. Gone were his all platinum hair, replaced by a black hair with silvery streaks. His silvery blue irises were cold obsidian. The same smile was on his lips as that day and the blood that covered his whole being was still there as if it had just happened.
"Shhh… Don't worry, my sweet. You have nothing to fear. When I take over, the body is still yours but only mine to control for a while. It is a transmutated version of the possession that you are thinking about. Until the time that you return to the Manor will I leave your body."
"Don't think this is over Parkinson. You are not my Elder," he threatened before walking away.
but stopped himself when he noticed something on Marius’ palm. There he saw what seemed to be an old scar. He gently pried the human’s fingers one by one to see it properly, only to realize the scar seemed to have been vertically cut. Harry felt something stir inside of him as he slowly picked up Marius’ left hand and began to inspect it. Then, unconsciously, he laced their hands together. Harry knew his hand was calloused from training meanwhile Marius’ was soft and smooth except for the scar on the palm.
Slowly the members started to undress until the only wore their underwear. The blonde man roughly forced Yoongi up and ripped away his clothes. “ My name Danny and I am the leader of this group. You will always follow my orders if you want to make sure to stay safe! You will all address me as Sir! Is that clear?” Again Namjoon calmly translated for the others. Hesitantly all of them answered with yes sir. “Don’t hurt them…” Yoongi pressed out between clenched teeth. Namjoon silently cursed the  independent brave boy. Danny took his Yoongis chin forcefully in his hand as he made Yoongi look up to him while he pressed the barrel of the gun to the boys lips. One of his Hyungs screamed for Danny to get away from Yoongi but was shut up with a hard slap to the face. Namjoon could only watch in horror as Danny pressed the gun against Yoongis gritted teeth until he brushed it past his lips and teeth forcing the gun inside Yoongis mouth. “Suck it!” Danny ordered. “If you are so brave give me a show worth seeing if you really want me to not hurt your friends!”
So this is the first real chapter of this story. There will be more porn in the next chapters. It will also get more graphic in the next chapters. To be continued soon.
They were walking quietly for a few minutes before Harry broke the uncomfortable silence. “Draco…what exactly happened to you. I mean how… why did you…” Draco laughed dryly. “Seriously? Cut the crap Potter you know exactly what happened to me.” Malfoy stopped walking looking almost hatefully at he former enemy. Harry looked back at him just a little confused maybe even concerned. He wanted to say something but Draco was faster. “You don’t know do you? I mean you never came to my trials but I just assumed as the golden sunny whatsoever big hero he had to know what’s going on. Merlin, I even thought most of it was somehow your idea.” Harry just shook his head slightly. “Look, I was kind of a mess after the war. I lost so many dear friends and everything was just too much for me I had to have some time for myself so I left the country. I testified for you over an owl though, told the ministry that you don’t deserve the same sentence as the other death eaters but to be honest I did not really focus on what happened to you exactly. When I came back a year ago no one ever mentioned you and I didn’t see you around so I kind of assumed you did the same, start a new life somewhere else. I didn’t think of something like this…” Draco looked like he had been slapped. “Oh yeah right started a new life, after one month spending in Azkaban and probation for the next 5 years without magic, or money or friends. Right Potter, that’s how you start a new life living happily ever after somewhere new. You want to know how I ended up this way. Well after I finished my sentence in Azkaban, after they stripped me from all my belongings and took my wand, I tried to find a job, begged for the kind of jobs squibs do but you know what: apparently everyone hates former death eaters and Slytherin’s so no-one was willing to help me out. But people were willing to pay me to come all over my face for revenge, seen me on my knees and pushing me into the wall while fucking me hard. So guess what at some point I just happened to be desperate enough to do that instead of starving and I kept going because I had to pay the rent and buy clothes to not freeze to death either so let’s just say I choose this life instead of dying alone in the streets.” Draco looked a little furious while he spat those words at Harry -whose expression changed from confusion to worry. “Draco… I…” he tried to say but Draco just cut him off and kept walking. “No, don’t Draco me Potter, we never where friends. It wasn’t your fault what happened to me, let’s just get you to your hotel so I can get back to business.”
“Bright as always Granger. I have to say.” Malfoy was standing in the door. A long Cloak he took from Harrys closet covering up his body. “Potter found me on the streets and offered help. Always the concerned golden boy. We got into quite a fight during lunch before Kreacher announced that you were already on your way. So I left to grab my things and get out of here but it seems like you can’t be fooled that easily.” Harry didn’t know what to think should he be thankful or angry. What did Draco think he was doing? Clearly he was not helping. How was he supposed to explain to Hermione that he took in Draco Malfoy after all. A traitor and coward and hooker. Harry Potter was fucked. “Draco Malfoy?” Hermione shot Harry an inscrutable look. “ Harry why exactly were you trying to hide this? And what do you mean he found you in the streets Draco. I am seriously confused.” Harry started to feel very uncomfortable in his body right now. “You know Hermione after all that happened during the war and what… you know … I mean I wasn’t sure how you would react and…” Draco laughed dryly. “ He probably was a little embarrassed because I am a hooker and maybe he did not want to explain why he brought me home.” Hermione was shocked. “Excuse me… what? Are you saying you two are… I mean…” Draco just shook his head and took a seat across from Hermione and Harry. “Not what you think Granger. Potter got lost after some Party in Diagon Alley and didn’t find his hotel but he found me selling myself on the streets and I gave him directions. He didn’t really like how I ended up though and tried to talk to me but I seriously don’t see the point. It’s not his fault after all. It’s just how life is. Once you take the wrong turn there is no going back. No one forced me to do this but there is nothing much really I can do either.” Hermione sat there stunned for a moment. Then she started to slap Harrys arm. “ Harry James Potter! What is wrong with you! Why would you want me to come over to talk about this stupid engagement party when there are real Problems that we have to solve! Are you serious? What is wrong with you!” Harry tried to shield himself. “Hermione please would you stop… Like he Draco said there is nothing much we can do about this and I can handle it..” Hermione kept hitting him. “Oh no! I see how you can handle this! No kidding! This is a mess and I am not leaving this with you! The three of us will have a meeting. I will do research on what to do now and we will discuss this together! Maybe we should ask Ron to … now that would not be helping. Maybe Kingsley or Molly. We need someone with connections and life experience and I need to organize this…” Draco frowned. “Is she always like that? Granger listen I appreciate it, really but I don’t want some sick trials again with people telling me what I have to do with my life. It is only 3 more years of probation after that I get my magic back and can finally get back to a normal life as well so thank you very much but I can handle the situation myself. I am a grown men and I have been fine for the last two years on my own. So thank you very much and as I told Potter before. No help needed.” Hermione’s lip started to tremble in frustration. “Harry. Did you know about this? Say something we have to do something.” Draco just shook his head. “ No you don’t. We never were friends so seriously just stay out of it.” Harry stood up. “Hermione maybe we should reschedule. I will talk to Draco and maybe we can find a solution after everything calmed down but I think it would be best if nobody pressured anyone into doing what they don’t want wouldn’t you agree. I think we should slow down a bit.” Hermione just sighed. “ Fine. But under protest. This is not over, and there will be a lot of explaining. I am going to research our options here and I will owl you Harry.” Harry just nodded and showed her out a little frustrated. When Hermione had left he came back to Draco furiously.
The room was slightly dark. No lights where on and the sun was already very low giving not too much light through the one small window. The big king sized bed in the middle of the room was a mess. Bloody sheets surrounded a naked bruised body in the middle of the bed. It looked almost like a child – small and curled up. He heard slow breathing in an uncontrolled irregular pattern. Right Harry had broken Draco’s rib this morning and he forgot to fix it. Regret shot through him for a second when he looked at the broken body before him sleeping but not peacefully like this morning. Pain was painted on Malfoys face. Dried blood mixed with dried tears surrounded his lips. Come and blood leaking out of his ass. Shameless slut didn’t even clean up his mess. Rage shot through him. He deserved this. Harry turned around to leave but somehow he couldn’t. Slowly he walked over to the sleeping figure on the bed and studied him harder. He had to fix this otherwise there could be permanent damage. Harry did not care for Dracos feelings but he had to at least bring him into good shape otherwise he would be useless. With the swing of his wand he healed the broken rib and the teared flesh, the bitemarks and even the older bruises. Afterwards he used a cleaning spell. Draco was still asleep. Face still with a pained look. Potter was annoyed. He woke him up with a hard slap. “Clothes are in the drawers next to your cage. Get dressed and get downstairs. Lunch is waiting for you and I don’t want to ask twice so don’t make me wait any longer.” And with that he left and ordered Kreacher to make him new food immediately as his lunch was cold by now.
Betrayal. That was the first thing he felt. Like a hard slap in the face, daggers in his chest and a choking hand around his neck. He could not breath, he could not cry he could not say anything. Then real pain shot through him like a lightning. White pure pain from his bottom and a real slap in his face and a real hand around his neck and real daggers – no  his chest was fine but it hurt. “I said scream.” But Draco couldn’t. He couldn’t give him the satisfaction. Of course it hurt and he did not expect it but really he was a hooker after all this was what he was here for. His body was screaming for it to stop but his mind went black like it always did when he slept with someone. He focused on the spot Harry was occasionally hitting deep inside him during his brutal paste. Draco ignored the blood from his ripped entrance, the slaps in his face and the cruel voice that told him all the bad things that he already knew. This was nothing he couldn’t handle. This was business this was – crack. He heard the familiar sound of bones cracking and for a moment he was unsure of what exactly happened. Then he felt it and finally he did scream. Like bloody hell screamed.
Over the next few weeks Merlin didn’t let Arthur leave his chambers, breeding him every day and fucking him all over the place. Arthur had turned into a perfect slut willingly letting Merlin take him, his dick had shrunken into a micro penis by now. Arthur had finally accepted his place. He was standing at his window looking over his kingdom, tenderly caressing his slightly swollen belly under the nightgown he was wearing. A maid entered his chambers with a beautiful long white gown, embroided with hundreds of pearls. It was his wedding day today to become Merlins perfect queen and the crownation day for Merlin to become the rightful king alongside his beautiful bride and soon to be mother of their perfect spouse.

Harry sat down at the kitchen table and enjoyed the breakfast Kreacher made him like every other morning. Afterwards he answered some letters before he made himself presentable with the swing of his wand. He was almost running late for an interview on the radio. And without another thought about Draco he left.  After two more interviews with a magazine and the newspaper and a long shopping trip with Hermione Harry went home for a late lunch in the afternoon. Kreacher brought him everything he needed to the big table in the dining hall. Everything was set up but Draco was not there. “Malfoy” Harry was furious. He almost screamed the name. No response. Where was that stupid street hooker.
Draco kept shaking his head weakly new tears forming in the corners of his eyes when soft lips tenderly brushed his. Harry Potter kissed Draco Malfoy sweetly tongue slipping shyly into his mouth and even though he didn’t want to Draco kissed him back. He couldn’t let the sweetness slip away from him, the soothing tender touch was the only thing that kept him sane in that brief moment. When the kiss ended the cozy feeling ended to and turned into pain again. Soft hands that had caressed his face moments ago now attacked his chest and stomach with forceful blows. Pain shot through Dracos whole body. He couldn’t breathe when all the air was knocked out of his body with one brutal punch. He couldn’t see, couldn’t scream, couldn’t do anything except for feeling the consuming pain. Harry painted Dracos body in blue, green and purple bruises. Harry painted Dracos face with a beautiful shining red. Split lips, welts and cuts where his skin cracked from hard slaps. The sound of flesh hitting flesh filled the room. Draco was already fainting into the welcoming black again but before it could consume him into a tender hug of nothingness ice cold water pulled him back to reality. Harry threw buckets of water over Dracos body until the man before him was shivering like crazy, almost freezing in the cold dungeon before he dunked Dracos head under water in one of the buckets. Harry hold him still until Dracos body finally surrendered and fell limp. Passing out for the second time that evening. But the welcoming break for Draco didn’t take too long as Harry brought him back with the help of a leather belt. When he was done hitting every free spot he could find on Dracos body he took a step back to admire his master piece.
“Try the chicken.” He said and sat down next to Malfoy. “It is very tender. You would like it.” Draco frowned. “Excuse me, but what? Are you actually insane? That’s it ? That’s the situation right now? You are just going to pretend like nothing happened?” Harry tried to control the rage that started to build up inside of him. It was hard but he managed to steady himself a bit and just took one chicken leg and put it n Malfoys plate. “I didn’t mean you do not fit my personal beauty standards. You look unhealthy and not like yourself. That’s why I want you to put on some weight.” Malfoy laughed dryly but took a bite out of the chicken. “Right and that’s why you make me wear these clothes because they make me look more like myself.” The dark haired wizard smirked. “No that is to make you feel ridiculous after all you told me you dress like this because that is what people want you to wear so I thought I would keep that up for you. After all you are a hooker so maybe it would be easier for you to keep being dressed like one so you don’t loose yourself.” Draco helped himself with some chips and salad while watching Harry closely.  He seemed calm but tense. Draco wasn’t sure what he was up to. “ Ok cut the crap now and just tell me what it is you want. You are jumping from being friendly to being cruel and from being disgusted by me to being aroused. After all that happened you can’t tell me you are trying to help me out but if you want to get revenge you are doing a pretty lousy job too. So what exactly is this?” Harry just shrugged. “ I don’t know.” Draco frowned and stopped eating. “ What do you mean you don’t know? Are you fucking with me Potter?” Harry laughed. “Well I kind of did.” Draco growled. “Seriously Malfoy, I don’t know. Yesterday I felt bad for you and I actually wanted to help you. Then you made me so mad and I just wanted to get back at you for being such a brat all the time. It’s an up and down and I seriously lost track of myself most of the time. I don’t enjoy hurting you but I don’t enjoy not hurting you either. I just don’t know what I am doing right know. That’s why I am trying to keep everyone at distance. I don’t want to hurt anybody but that’s what happens to people that are close to me. They get killed or hurt and I can’t protect them I can’t protect anybody. But that’s what people want me to. They want me to be the hero. They want me to be always smiling full of hope talking about making the world a better place and looking forward to the future. But that is not who I am. I killed Voldemort. I am a murderer. I lost almost everybody. And I know it’s not your fault but it’s easier to blame it all on you than blame it on myself. Because I am the weak one. I couldn’t save anyone all I did was hurt and kill and somehow I survived even though I really just wanted to die. I am a pathetic mess that can barely put himself together.” Draco sat in silence listening to the great Harry Potter putting himself down until he couldn’t take it anymore. “ That is not true. You saved me. You could have left me for death in that fire but you didn’t. You could have let me rot in Azkaban for all my crimes but you didn’t. You could have killed me when you got captured in our mansion and you fled with your friends but you didn’t. You saved me for a hundred times and I am sure if you did that to a person you hate you saved the people you love a hundred times more than you did save me Potter.” Harry was stunned. It actually felt could talking to someone. Ginny had begged him to open up to someone but somehow he had been too afraid to open up to anybody about what was going through his mind. And Draco Malfoy actually told him that he was wrong. After all he did just hours ago. After he practically raped him just this morning and tortured him and everything that happened in Hogwarts. How could he not tell Harry that he was pathetic and  that he hated him. “ I almost killed you. I almost killed you yesterday and in 6th grade. Draco I raped you this morning. I cursed you, I threated you like a whore.” Draco laughed dryly. “Potter I am a whore. I am a hooker you found in the streets at 4 o’clock in the morning. You can’t really call that rape. You did pay me after all and didn’t I sign a contract for that? And well yeah you almost killed me but you didn’t. And trust me Potter I have been cursed before. And I did bad things too. I broke your nose, I bullied you and you know all the things I did during the war. If you really want to blame someone it shouldn’t be yourself or me or anyone. It was all of us. There isn’t good and bad people. Everyone is capable of doing everything.” Harry looked at Malfoy, stunned. “When did you become so wise? You sound like a Psychologist” The blonde wizard just shrugged. “I had a lot of time to think since you left this morning. It just felt good letting all these thoughts out loud for once. I didn’t really get the chance to talk to anyone in the past 2 years.” Harry wanted to say something but he was searching for the right words. This wasn’t so easy after all.
Harry Potter was so utterly confused. The dark haired wizard could not quite understand what Draco was saying. He was hurt because Draco had spied on him while he cried. He was angry because Malfoy had saw him being weak. He was confused because Malfoy just said that he had been jealous of him, that he actually thought of him as a hero. And he was really shocked by the discovery that Draco Malfoy might had have a crush on Harry Potter. He wanted Malfoy to shut up. He wanted to hurt him. He wanted to push him away. He wanted to kiss him back so badly when he felt Malfoys lips on his. He wanted to push him harder against the wall and fuck into him. Harry Potter was so utterly confused.
At 8 pm Harry entered the lobby of the hotel. He spotted Draco right away. He was sitting in an armchair far away from the main desk and Harry smiled. Draco was wearing Gryffindor red lace underwear that could almost be seen through a thin almost seethrough short Red dress. The dress was embroidered with a gold pattern. Draco was wearing black socks with suspenders and black high heels. He didn’t look like a cheap whore anymore. He looked like an expensive whore now. A thin black cloak with a little hood was barely able to cover Draco’s body and outfit. But the hood gave him the only cover that he would get. He was able to hide his face. But his body Harry would show off. Even if it wasn’t in good shape just jet. Harry walked over to Draco. “You almost look stunning. Though the perfect clothes can not cover your imperfect body it was the best I could do. Now be a doll and accompany me to dinner darling.” Harry said mockingly. All Draco did was standing up and taking Harrys offering arm like a good girl. Draco had probably never felt more embarrassed in his life than right now. Harry grabbed Malfoys arm hard. “ I could not hear your thank you for the new clothes Malfoy. It might be a little loud in hear so maybe you should speak up a little.” Draco bowed his head and with a clear voice he said. Thank you for the beautiful clothes Master, I am sorry that I can’t make them look as good as they should look.” With a smile Harry started to walk out of the hotel with Draco. “ That is a good girl.”
Draco dreamed of nights of pure horror old and new. Misbehavior as a child. Slap. A woman getting sliced open by his aunt Bellatrix. Hands where they shouldn’t be. His failure to properly curse a mudblood. Crucio. A hand crawling up his thigh during home lesson times before Hogwarts by one of his fathers friends. His hair growing longer and men putting bows in them laughing. Voldemort killing a Hogwarts teacher right in front of him. Hostages getting hit by the Cruciatus curse over and over again. Crucio. The Cruciatus curse hitting him for he was not able to identify Harry Potter when he had the chance to give him to the Dark Lord. Harry Potters hands around his throat, Harry Potters cock pounding into him, Harry Potters curse hitting him. Slut, Whore, Traitor, Coward.
Harry did not really pay attention to anything that happened next. He had slipped out of the screaming mess beneath him. Pathetic little whore. He told him to shut up but nothing happened. The crutiatus curse did not shut the crying mess on his bed up either.  Of course it didn’t – Harry did not really do it to make him stop actually he wanted to make Draco hurt even more but the screams where annoying him, the loud cries and babbling about forgiveness. Like he could ever forgive this little piece of shit. It was funny it was extremely funny. All he could do was laugh like a mad men before he left the babbling mess behind in his room. He had work to do and Draco bloody Malfoy was not going to keep him from his work. Harry wasn’t worried that Draco would try to leave. Where would he go. Harry was everywhere. Harry owned this fucking whole country. Harry was his Master even if Draco would try to leave, the mark would not let him. Draco had signed a contract. He was his.
Harry was sitting at the table in the dining hall enjoying a butterbeer with his steak and Potatoes. Draco entered the room silently unsure where to put himself. Last time Potter had made him eat on the floor. But there was a seat prepared at the table. Draco was confused. He had to do something if he didn’t want to get punished. “ Where do you want to have me… Master?” he managed to say. Head bowed, hands behind his back, slightly trembling. “Seriously Malfoy? Are you blind? Now take a seat already you are being ridicules.” Potter didn’t even look up from the letter he was currently studying while eating. “Kreacher send an owl to Hermione we have to discuss this party in person, I am not satisfied with this planning whoever did it was an idiot and I want it dealt with now. I want her to come by later.” Draco just silently took a seat. The table was full with delicious food but Draco wasn’t able to pick anything. This whole situation was insane. Harry acted like nothing had happened before. This was crazy. This was confusing. “ Malfoy what exactly do your think you are doing? The food is not going to eat itself. And don’t tell me you are not hungry. You look starved and I don’t like it. I want you to put on some weight. You look like a corpse and not like a human being. It’s awful and I won’t tolerate it.” That’s when Draco snapped. “Oh I am sorry Potter. I am sorry that I am not sexy enough for you right now and that I am not fitting your perverse beauty standards right now! That didn’t seem to be a problem for you this morning though or was it? You seemed to enjoy my disgusting body quite enough. Or maybe it was that isn’t the problem maybe you just have to torture me a bit to get you in the mood for a nice fuck huh? Didn’t know you were a sadist before though it actually fits. The perfect golden boy and hero of a nation actually gets off on hurting people maybe that’s why you miss the war so much did it give you a hard one seeing all those people around you die Potter or was it…” Pain shot through him. Pure pain. He didn’t even hear Potter say the curse during his little speech. “So now we are getting started aren’t we?” Draco managed to say after he was able to steady himself from the pain. “Are you ready for another round of fucking the cheap street hooker, Potter?” In a mere second Harry was in Dracos face. “ Shut up Malfoy.” Potters wand was only inches from Malfoys face. “Why, whatever you are going to do to me it can’t be worse than what you already did, or worse than what he did or anyone else did or I did so whatever, do your worst Potter if it makes you happy. That’s what I am here for isn’t it? I am going to be your personal punching bag. It doesn’t matter what I do or don’t do you will do whatever you damn well please whenever you are in the mood for it!” Harry didn’t respond. He just stared down at Malfoy who was still sitting in front of an empty plate.
That is where Harry cracked. His eyes turned dark and with the swing of his wand Draco was lifted to the air unable to breath. “ You think this is a game Malfoy? You want to play Master and poor little boy with me like you did with him? He killed my parents, my friends, innocent people and you helped him! You think you had it hard because you spent a month in prison for what you did? You have no idea what pain means, what loss means you are just a coward selling yourself like you always did! Hiding behind excuses that you have no other choice. You are weak and I should watch you die right here in front of me. No one would miss you. Just another whore that died who cares? I would like to see that you know. I would like to see you fighting for your life and I would really like to see the look on your face when you finally realize there is nothing you can do to stop me. You think I paid you to fuck this poor excuse for a body? You are pathetic, you look like hell and smell like cheap perfume who would actually want you?” Tears swelled up in Dracos, the lack of oxygen was showing in his features already. He looked like he was passing out any moment when there was a knock on the door. The sound seem to distract Harry and he let go. Draco fell to the floor coughing hysterically and gasping for air. “Leave it in the corridor I will pick it up myself” Harry said loud enough to be heard outside. He shot Draco one hateful look before standing up to catch the food. Draco stayed on the floor to afraid of what to expect from the dark haired wizard he thought he knew. This wasn’t Harry Potter. Hero of a nation, always goody good boy Potter who saved the fucking day just by being Potter. No this wasn’t the boy he knew from school. Sectum Sempra, blood and pain all around him, hateful looks and nasty comments. This wasn’t Potter? Maybe it was. Draco was confused and he was scared. “What are you doing? Stand up you useless slut and take a seat. I have a proposition for you.” Draco did as instructed. “And what would that be, Potter? If you didn’t pay me for some sick revenge sex and not to just chitchat for old times sake what are you going to propose to me?” Harry smirked. “ I offer you a life. You are already selling yourself without getting enough to properly live your pathetic little life.” Draco just laughed. “Seriously Potter? You almost killed me just moments ago! You think I am fucking stupid?” Harry just lifted the cover over the food and casually took a bite of a chicken leg. “Actually I think you are a coward and desperate, not stupid but maybe that you are too. After all you did follow me in here and even after this little incident you did not try to run from me once so far.” Draco laughed coldly. “ Oh so that’s what happened to your little weasle girl huh, Potter? Did your girlfriend run away because you are…” Harry slapped him hard, without warning. “Don’t you dare talk about her. From now on you will call me sir or master. This was your idea after all wasn’t it Malfoy. This is what you wanted. You need a new lord to serve because you are a pathetic little coward. You will not disrespect me any longer. I give you this offer and only once. Get on your knees like the useless slut that you are and bow before your master and take my generous offer. I will give you back a life to live under my command and rules. If you refuse my offer you can go back to that pathetic excuse for a living and starve to death knowing that I will make it impossible for you to every get out of your misery. So what will it be Malfoy?” Draco hesitated for a moment stunned by Harrys words and the slap. It wasn’t the first time someone had slapped him, it wasn’t even the first time somonis tried to kill him. But it this was new no actually this reminded him of something – of someone -  it reminded him of the dark lord. What was Potter up to what was he supposed to do know. Did he even have a choice? Right know it did not seem to matter what he did – Potter would make his life a living hell either way. Or he would probably kill him either way. So Draco did what he always did, trying his best to safe his life. He got on his knees before Harry and bowed his head. “ Thank you for your kind offer, master. I will do whatever satisfies you.” His body was trembling slightly and Draco could barely stop the tears from freely running down his cheeks. Strong hands grabbed his chin and he was forced to look into cold unforgiving green eyes. “Of course you will.” Potter said coldly. “Now take a seat and start eating, the food is getting cold.”
The older Malfoy, however, seemed blank as he stared at the exchange. He watched the exchange between the lovers, growing impatient.
He was going to kill Harry.
Harry's unsettling willingness to accept death almost made Draco have an even harder time. But with the look his father was giving him...
Arthur tastes exquisite and he feels so good fighting in Merlins mouth. The sorcerer is rock hard and he can’t stop playing with his helpless king. He knows it’s safe to turn Arthur back now but this is way too much fun. Merlin will not let this opportunity slip. Slowly Merlin takes off his clothes as his tongue keeps swirling around Arthurs naked body. He moans lewdly as he slightly chews on his king not enough to seriously injure him but enough to make Arthur freeze in fear. A hand starts to work his cock up and down as Merlin keeps toying with his helpless king. After what feels like hours to the helpless man Merlin takes him out of his mouth. He holds him firmly in place taking in the beautiful sight of the broken man before him. Arthur trembles and sobs covered all over in Merlins salvia. Merlin pushes the little body on top of his cock while he keeps jerking himself now with his king on top of him covering him in precum. The sorcerer moans loudly as he feels Arthur rub up and down his big cock. The king is unable to speak as he weakly fights for freedom while tears stream down his wet cheeks. Merlin licks his lips slightly biting down on them to hold back another moan. Slowly he grabs Arthurs little soft dick and starts rubbing over it with one finger while he keeps jerking his cock. After a few little rubs Arthur begins to harden under loud protest. Merlin just chuckles slightly as he uses the king for his own pleasures. He guides Arthurs little hard cock to his own penis pushing Arthurs tip inside his own peephole. A loud moan escapes his lips as he forces the kings hard cock inside his own penis carefully wrapping the little man’s legs around his own shaft. Merlin screams out in pleasure as he uses Arthur like a fuck toy pushing him deep inside before pulling out again, making the helpless man fuck Merlins penis while rubbing around him like a fleshlight. All Arthur can do his bite his lips as hard as he can to hold back the moans forming in his throat at the forced sensation. Blood drops down his chin when he bites his lips to fast while he force fucks the tight hole of Merlins penis. Big strong hands hold him in place and force him to increase the speed and Arthur cannot hold back the moans any longer as he feels his release approach. Merlin watches his king tremble in lust now feeling the little hard dick inside his own grow and pulsate as Arthur reaches an orgasm inside of his servant. But it isn’t enough. Merlin moans loudly as he can feel his stretched peephole getting filled with his kings cum. He does not give Arthur time to rest before forcefully pulling him out moaning loudly at the sight of cum mixed with his own precum dripping down his huge cock. Slowly Merlin puts Arthur back in his mouth sucking an licking him clean as the little man struggles in overstimulation. But the sorcerer does not care. Of course he does not want to hurt Arthur but he just feels so good, such a perfect little toy for Merlin.
At the last battle against Morgana and her forces Merlin arrives at Arthurs side as Mordred walks onto the battle field searching for the king. Arthur kneels next to a dying soldier his back to Mordred as Merlin quickly walks towards him. Merlin has a vision of how Mordred wounds Arthur and how the king kills the young man afterwards but in the end there will be nothing Merlin can do to save his friend once he is wounded. So Merlin does the only thing he can think of right now. He shrinks Arthur with a spell and picks him up quickly before Mordred can spot him. Merlin feels Arthur trembling in his hand as the young king does not know what’s going on but Merlin has to make sure his king is safe. He runs into the woods with Arthur securely protected in the palm of his hands.
Draco Malfoy started to shiver slightly under Harry Potter when his licks became rougher and turned to bites of hate and lust. He wanted to make him hurt and it felt so good so right – Harry Potter was rock hard in his Pyjama pants. ”Good morning slut” Harry said still tracing the bruises and newly made bite marks with his tongue. He was almost painfully aroused when he took one Dracos slightly hard nipples into his mouth and bit the sensitive skin. He slightly sucked it in and when he let it out again it was a nice and shy shade of pink. Like a girls, almost cute, almost innocent and extremely sexy combined with Draco Malfoys soft almost unhearable moans. “ Did you sleep well” Harry almost asked softly, like he would ask his love in the morning after she woke up next to him smiling her soft and sleepy smile after a good nights sleep. He had not seen that in ages. Harry Potter was rock hard. No it wasn’t because of Malfoy. Dracos all too skinny body and whoreish moans did not torn him an. He was a good man, he was a hero. Slap.
After Draco left the room Harry felt bad. Did he really just say that? Pretend you don’t exist. What has he become.
The memories came back in flashes while Harry gathered the devices he was going to use on the unconscious body hanging limp from the wall. Harry on his knees begging for the pain to stop. Slap. Harry crying on the floor unsure what he even did wrong. Slap. Harry coughing blood on the clean carpet. Slap. He had been Dudleys punchingbag since he could remember and Vernon’s too. His aunt had never laid hands on my. She just tortured him with words about how he was a sick and abnormal. It had been almost as bad, sometimes even worse than the constant beatings. Harry couldn’t remember how many times his aunt had actually had to drive him to a hospital due to inner bleeding and broken bones when he had “fallen over his own legs” down the stairs again. Harry couldn’t actually remember how many nights he had cried himself to sleep scared and alone with his demons in the dark and too cramped cupboard that he had called a home. What he did remember was how they did it. What he did remember was what hurt the most. What he did remember was how to burn skin with an iron rod from the fireplace without causing permanent damage to show on the skin but enough to burn and hurt for hours, days and weeks until it properly heals. With all of this firsthand experience Harry definitely knew how to wake Draco up in the most painful way.
Of course Potter would want a go on him. Why did he even think for just one minute that maybe this would be different. He was too proud to say it out loud but he had somehow hoped that Potter would offer him help that he would maybe care just a little bit. Draco wanted to smack himself in the face, hard. Just for hoping for one second. The hotel was so luxurious. Draco gasped for a second. He had almost forgotten how beautiful a room could look. Harry went to the front desk to get the keys to the suite that he had reserved and Draco followed him silently. When Potter opened the door for them even Malfoy was impressed. It was the most breathtaking suite he had ever seen. It was remarkable. When the door closed behind Harry Draco took of the cloak. “ So let’s get straight to business shall we? Where do you want me?” Harry just picked up the cloak and put it into a closet. “Are you hungry? We can order whatever you want to the suite.” Draco just shook his head. “That is not what you are paying me for. I am a professional. Just get it over with. I have condoms if you want to fuck me or you have to use a protection charm – obviously I can’t do that. Also I don’t kiss. “ Harry sat down on a big sofa and looked at Malfoy. “ I am hungry and I am ordering food now. And Draco this is exactly what I am paying you for so you should order something too.” The blonde man just shrugged his shoulders. “Fine, I’ll take whatever you are getting.” He just said and sat down on the floor. Harry just nodded and with the wave of his wand note formed itself on a piece of paper flying out of the room like an owl. “The food shouldn’t take too long. So tell me when you earn 300 galleons, why do you look like you are starving and your clothes… Draco why are you dressed like this?” Draco eyed him annoyed. “Seriously Potter? You know getting revenge on my does not pay that good most of the time. If I am lucky I get a few blowjobs a night or maybe one quick fuck in the alley. And the clothes – it is degrading and humiliating that’s what people want, that’s all they are paying for. But if you don’t like them. I’ll just take them off for you the customer is the master after all.” Draco said mockingly while taking off his clothes revealing his skinny body and black lace panties and Bra.
Draco has been working the streets for ages now. After the war he lost everything. At first he thought people would have mercy on him that maybe they would see that he was just a boy, a scared boy that feared for his life and his familys life that he had actually tried to help the light side. He did help Potter at his mansion when they got caught after all and actually he really did not try very hard to stop Potter or kill Dumbledore. You could say that he made some but decisions in his life though and that he wasn’t the nicest guy around schooldays. But did he deserve a five year sentence in Azkaban? Somehow he had managed to get probation but one month in Azkaban had changed him. He was different now. He was wandless, poor and friendless now. He was a street whore at Diagon Alley now. And Draco Malfoy was definitely desperate.
“Merlin I don’t understand… please… is this a dream… what” Merlin slapped Arthur in the face. “Stop that babbeling. I am your master now and you are going to be my beautiful bride. The sooner you except this the easier it will be for yourself. I am so done with you pushing me around, after all I did for you and you never ever apricated any of it. I am done with it Arthur and I won’t take it any longer. So I took matters into my own hands now.” Arthurs stunned face locked so delicious. Merlin smiled at him brightly and slowly started to touch Arthurs almost naked body. “No… how did you… who gave you this charm…what” Merlin laughed bright and loud. “ You don’t get it do you? Are you really this dumb Arthur? I am a sorcerer. How did  you think you came so far? You would be nothing without me Arthur. I saved your life a hundred times with my magic. You are not capable of being a king and ruling this country all this time I have done that for you and I don’t want to do it from the background any longer. I will take my rightful place at the throne and you are lucky that you are so pretty that I kept you alive to be my queen. You’re not good for anything else than getting fucked and looking pretty anyway so why not make a living of it.” Arthur couldn’t believe the words that came out of his servants mouth. Betrayal was all he could feel. How could his servant, his friend do this to him. His whole body trembled while he cried. “You won’t get through with this... you can’t … my people won’t except this they will..” Merlin kissed him again. “ Oh sweatheart… I already did. I changed everyone’s memory except for yours. They all think you were born a girl and your father forced you to dress and act like a prince because he couldn’t stand having a daughter except for a son. Your people pity you for this fate and hated your father for it and all they wish for is for you to become who you are and be their beautiful queen.” Arthur screamed. He cried and trashed in denial. “No… You are lying… Why? Why would you do that?” Merlin chuckled and got of the bed. “Because this is so much sweeter. I want you to become my queen willingly and I wanted you to remember what and who you used to be but of course I had to make sure that nothing would be in my way. All you have to do now is surrender and except who you really are. I have seen the woman in your for years Arthur. You are weak and fragile and I always had to protect you. Except who you really are my love, what you really are and we can be happy together.” Arthur screamed and trashed around wildly having a major anger attack like a little girl. “No! I will never do that! I will never be your Queen! Never ever never!!” Merlin just mumbled a spell and suddenly Arthur stood before him. The sorcerer petted his cheek and with another spell Arthur was dressed in the beautiful gown that Merlin had brought with him. It was the most beautiful  dress Merlin had ever seen and Arthur looked stunning. He turned him around so Arthur could see himself in the mirror. “Now tell me doll, aren’t you going to be the most beautiful queen of them all. Tell me you really think you were not made for this.” Arthur just kept crying. “No…please….no”
