But now, not only were Sirius and Harry back but these two men, that had supposedly died hundreds of years ago, were now here, after an already stressful day, saying that Regulus was also alive.
“Angry? Angry?! He kept me as a slave!” Severus bellowed, horns bursting through his forehead, causing his rage to grow with the pain now pounding his skull. He took one menacing step forward, refusing to back down. How dare this unknown Draken get in the way of his kill.
David started giving Harry a lesson in cheese and where each one was from and where they were made. Harry was amazed by the diversity. So much so that he didn’t notice the growing pile of presents or the three owls that dropped off packages. He did, however, see Hedwig as she landed on his shoulder, preening her human’s hair.
When Harry had gone to Remus at the end of the year, he had told Harry about his Father’s animagus form, that of a Scottish Red Deer, he had even pulled out a photo he seemed to keep in his breast pocket. It was obviously torn in half, but what remained was that of a large stag jumping around with a cherry red nose and fairy lights twined between its antlers.
I leave to Sirius Orion Black of London, England, if he shall survive me, Vault 586. In the case, he is unable to accept this bequest it is to be given to Remus John Lupin of London, England. Sirius, my brother in all but blood, prankster extraordinaire, and damn dirty dog, I leave to you my two greatest treasures, Lily and Harry. There is so much I wish I could say, lists of things I need you to do to make sure Harry grows into a better man than me. But it would take too long to do here, they are in the vault I left for you, please read them. Lastly, don’t blame yourself if the Fidelius failed, we both know who is really at fault.
But he had years worth of control and the only sign of his anger was the slight flare of his nostrils. Bartok, from years of being friends, recognized the danger and stilled.
In contrast to her sat Bartok who, even sitting towered over everyone else. The suit he was wearing looked so expensive that if it were Harry, he wouldn’t even dare touch it for risk of ruining it. But there Bartok was toast in one hand and coffee in the other, looking as if he walked right off a movie set. When he looked up at their entrance at first, his eyes were as sharp as razor blades, and Harry could understand why he was such a good lawyer. But as soon as he realized who was standing there, they melted, all dark chocolate and care. And Harry had the urge to run over to him and hide away from any of his worries because he instinctively knew his Papa could keep him safe from anything.
At this Harry was also worried, he had been questioning his relationship with Arthur more than any of the other Weasleys. Harry was almost certain on where he stood with the older five Weasley children and was completely sure of how he felt about Molly, Ron, and Ginny.
For so long he had ignored his wolf, had even thought it was trying to drive him insane with its nonstop howling for its mate. Remus had been so confused as to why his wolf would mourn the man when he was the reason they had lost their alpha pair and their cub. But his wolf, in its animalistic way, insisted that Sirius would never betray the pack.
After dinner, Issy led the two young boys to Harry’s room, Harry curious as to why. Neville’s hand was in his and Issy was babbling about the history of the house and some of its more interesting features. By the time they made it to his room, Harry was exhausted from the long emotional day, his feet shuffling against the hardwood. Neville’s bags were set on the bench at the end of Harry’s overly large bed.
Harry wiped at his eyes as a tear started to form, bottom lip trembling. But he held it together, just leaning over to hug his Daddy, breathing in his musky scent. “Thank you, Daddy. Will you help me set it up later?”
… and where his Mother’s hair had once stood up in rebellious spikes it now clung to her scalp, slightly greasy. She only turned when Augusta gently pulled on her shoulder, her once cherubic cheeks now hollow and her lips white and chapped.
Healer Lorraine continued, "I am unsure of how long it will take to get in contact with a potions master both able and willing to help with this. They would need a level of skill most do not and have an understanding of how the brain works and how that makes up who we are as a person. I know a few people I can start contacting, like the Terradore Potion Master's Guild."
Godric allowed the smirk to spread across his face, “Well, first we have some items to… Well, let’s say reappropriate.” In turn, everyone else smirked as well, Helga’s the most vicious of them all.
The man in front of him winced and hissed unhappily at the thought but still didn’t move. His voice remained calm and it only angered Severus more. “He isn’t worth a lifetime in Azkaban, you know he is seen as a hero and they will never believe you.”
Harry frowned at the thought that seemed to come out of nowhere. The man in front of him was long and lean, slicked back hair curled slightly around his ear where several piercings rested.
It was an underhanded tactic, especially considering noon was the dead of night for most vampires. Bartok had to rush to get all of his paperwork together, thankfully he was organized, so that took almost no time at all, before he flooed over to his clients, banging on their bedroom door.  They came rushing out, all still in their night clothes and still half asleep wondering why someone was in their house.
Albus Dumbledore was fuming. He was currently in one of Dedalus’ vacation homes in Wales. He had been feeling awful all-day and the last thing he needed was to come down with the Wizard’s Flu. The past few weeks were an absolute mess, and it was all he could do to continue to act as if everything was okay in front of the masses.
The whole clan was gathered in Harry’s room, it was just over eleven p.m., and Harry would regain his sight at midnight. Harry had elected to take a sleeping-draught so he could sleep through the whole ordeal, as it could be painful. The clan, however, wanted to be there in case he woke. They, along with Tiptop, were distracting themselves with hot chocolate and tea thought they all couldn’t help themselves from sending long glances towards the bed.
I leave to Francis Augustus Longbottom and Alice Helen Longbottom nee Smith of Cornwall, England, if they shall survive me, Vault 584. In the case, they are unable to accept this bequest it is to be held in trust by Augusta Corvus Longbottom nee Black of Cornwall, England, for Neville Francis Longbottom of Cornwall, England. Frank, you were always a brother to me and I am sad I will no longer be there for you when Alice kicks you out of the house for being too risky at work. And Alice, you have become like a sister to me as well, please promise me if Lily and I are both gone to help raise Harry. He will need a woman’s touch with Sirius and Remus raising him.
After a while, Harry’s tears long since stopped and a satisfied smile back on his face, David finally spoke up. “Come on, we have to get up for the day, Tiptop planned a really nice breakfast for you.”
With Neville off with Anna and his Grandmother, Harry took the time to spend with his Godfathers showing them around his room. Lyle and David joined them since they didn’t have work, and soon the four adults were getting on like a house on fire.
“We would be honored to accept your generous offer, Mr. Bartok.” Augusta stood, using a hand to smooth nonexistent wrinkles from her robe. “Now come along Neville, we need to first go to the bank to retrieve the Longbottom charm and then pack our bags for the week.” Reluctantly, Neville let go of Harry’s hand, placing a kiss on his forehead once he stood. It took Madam Longbottom reminding Neville to move for the boy to make his way over to her side. As they left, Neville continued to look back until they were finally past the doorway.
When they entered the courtroom with fifteen minutes to spare, he could see the disappointment and disgust on the faces of many of those present. But, what caught him off guard was the feeling of rage he felt when he saw Dumbledore sitting in the Chief Warlock’s stand. Not coming from himself, because ever since he found out who put Harry in the situation he had been, he had felt that bubbling rage, begging to be released on the man who dared to hurt his child. But there, barely hidden on Dumbledore’s face, was a bone-deep rage that if Bartok wasn’t as strong as he was, would have cowed him.
Bartok asked permission before transfiguring a few of the chairs into a couch large enough to fit the five of them. Percival once more taking up a spot behind Harry. Now that he knew the man a little more, and the fact that he had protected them from Dumbledore once, Harry allowed himself to relax. Knowing that Mr. Grave was at his back and would do everything he could to keep them safe, it gave him the confidence to relax back into his parents embrace.
It had been so long that Severus was nervous about what would happen, his shaky hands pulling down his pants and underwear. And there it was. His penis.
He leaned into Neville’s muscular arm, allowing his head to rest against the broad shoulder next to him. The warmth of the sun and body next to him along with the feeling of fullness started to lull him to sleep.
Dumbledore had rushed to the only place Severus would have to go, the rundown Spinner’s End, ready to recast the slavery spell. But when he arrived at the house, it was deserted, and Albus didn’t know where else his slave could have gone. Albus had made sure to make Severus cut all ties with anyone he knew in school, and to behave in such a manner that no one would be willing to take him in.
“Of course not!” one of the twins said, obviously upset at even the thought of doing something like that.
Dumbledore flinched back at her barb but had the presence of mind to stop Molly, who was building up to a rant with just one look.
Bartok grinned at his son, knowing Harry wanted to do his best to respect the gift he was given. Ever since they gave Harry the Claremore charm for his birthday, their son had done everything he could to learn about their family, all sides of it. They had all spent time telling Harry about their respective families, Harry had been fascinated. Lyle had sneakily told Harry more about his little brother Siles because they all knew that they would be married one day.
Harry changed into his pajamas, the silk tickling his skin as he first put it on. He still wasn’t used to owning such nice clothing, so unlike the rough fabric of Dudley’s hand-me-downs. After that he moved over to the toilet which had its own small room, paintings of rolling seas with white beaches dotted with flowers on each wall and a small chandelier hanging from the ceiling, casting sparkling splotches of light.
When they first visited the bank by the point they got to the Heirships, Harry had already been too overwhelmed to even listen to what the houses were so this was a shock to him. When Helix announced the first ring was the Black ring, he was shocked.
I leave to Minerva Brighid McGonagall of Kintail, Scotland, if she shall survive me, Vault 587. If she is unable to accept this bequest it shall be donated to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry’s Library. Aunt Minnie, thank you for always being there for me, and I hope you get to know Harry and steer him in the right direction if you are still working at Hogwarts when he starts attending. Regardless of that, with my Mother now gone, I hope you will consider taking up the role of Grandmother to Harry. The vault contains copies of most of the ancient texts my family has amassed.
After Dumbledore left, Remus told Sirius all that had been happening with his inner wolf. Sirius had always been a proponent for Remus to follow his instincts, and his wolf was all instincts. Remus only wished he would have followed that advice sooner.
If I was attacked at Godric’s Hollow our Secret Keeper was Peter Pettigrew. If he isn’t caught if I die this way I want this message to be delivered to Amelia Susan Bones, Head Auror:
Mr. Riddle had been quite open in his reasoning, first telling Bartok and David a summary of his life, and then told them what had really happened the Halloween of 2004. Bartok had been shocked at the news. Both because here was a man who knew what happened to his son that horrible evening and just how terrible Lord Gaunt’s life was. David had even taken notes so that he could look up points Tom had brought up.
Remus fell back on his old tactic of studying a person to see their intentions and motives. However, he saw nothing amiss, they all were genuinely concerned for Harry’s wellbeing and that more than anything was something Remus could get behind.
“By your disownment of the three, am I safe to say you had no clue of their plans?” Helix asked, still looking at the others with suspicion.
Before he could apparate away, a voice called out to him. He recognized its whiny tone, and when he turned, it was indeed the Minister approaching him with Dumbledore and two Aurors following. Fudge’s smile was tight, obviously disappointed in the case’s outcome, but he spoke with a false sense of comradery. “Mr. Claremore! I am glad I caught you before you left, if you could spare a moment to speak I would appreciate that.”
When Albus sent Minerva a Patronus to meet him in the Three Broomsticks, she dared to ignore him, leaving him sitting in the pub for three hours straight with no answer. He wished he could rage but his core was still leaking and the pub was full. He couldn’t risk being seen as anything other than genial. And when he messaged Severus the beast had dared reply to him with a,
“You also had two presents delivered by owl, we checked for dark curses, and they were clear, so there is nothing to worry about.” Bartok placed two boxes in front of Harry. They were both a plain brown paper. Two of his friends had remembered it was his birthday and he was both apprehensive and excited. With all that he had learned he was unsure if he wanted to receive anything from Hermione or Ron.
Arthur, however, hadn’t shown up in any of the investigation paperwork so far but Harry also knew that if anyone else was in on Molly’s plan Arthur would have been his first guess. Harry didn’t want to believe that of the man though. Mr. Weasley had always treated him more like one of his own children than Molly. He would often pull Harry aside when he had the chance and discreetly asked how Harry was. Unlike Molly he had never made a spectacle out of it, she would ask in front of everyone and when Harry tried to answer she would quickly change the subject. Harry had always thought that this was because she had so many children to look over, along with taking care of the house, that she couldn’t really devote the time to listen to him. Harry had never seen a moment where she wasn’t bustling around, even at meals she never seemed to stop moving.
Harry looked up at them, eyes bloodshot and puffy. “Really?” His voice cracked, every emotional easily seen.
That was why when a tall, young man stepped through the floo, even though she knew him, Tiptop stood in the shadows with a cast iron frying pan in hand.
Harry studied it with wide eyes, a flash of confusion soon smothered by what looked like love to Neville. Harry nodded, looking back up to Neville with round green eyes, shiny with tears, lower lashes weighed down by them.
Harry nodded vigorously, calming draught stopping his ability to cry. Bartok hooked the charm on, the bracelet momentarily glowing silver. Harry jumped up into his Papa’s arms, the older man catching him with ease and holding him tight.
“All abuse cases are handled quickly and as privately as possible. Madam Bones worked the case herself, and if she didn’t feel like you needed to be informed, it was not our job to do so.” Anna continued as if the man hadn’t even spoken. Harry curled further into Anna’s side, not liking that his treatment was being so openly stated but knowing it was one of the only ways to assure he wasn’t separated from his family.
Bartok apparated them to his favorite cafe near the bank so that they could have breakfast together. Harry, while still tired, was very talkative asking about Bartok’s plans for the day.
Once they could regain control of the school, they would assure such things would never happen again.
Both Harry and Sirius eeped, Sirius shooting his mate a dirty look for being so blunt. “But you’re both boys?” Sirius winced, he had hoped Harry at least knew the very basics, but apparently not. Now he understood why Issy had been too insistent that nothing would happen between Harry and Neville.
When the doors were completely open Harry laid his eyes upon his room for the first time. And all he could do was stand stock still, mind halting. Harry couldn’t even comprehend what was in front of him, there was a bed bigger than anything he had seen before. It had rich looking green coverings and the wood was a bleached white wood, gold inlaid runes. Harry couldn’t make out what most of them meant but he recognized the Elder Futhark runes Gifu, Jera, and Algiz. There were many others in many different runic alphabets he didn’t recognize.
Percival was quick to agree, and they spent the next few hours before Percival needed to leave for dinner laying out plans on what to do. And how to take down Albus Dumbledore.
Siles was still standing in the middle of the room, looking over Harry with a look the boy couldn’t begin to identify. Harry pulled his fuzzy blanket tighter around himself and raised his book to hid his face within the pages, looking over the edge warily.
And then Harry knew, he was… he was gay. He had to take that in, add it to his list of things that were part of him. It had taken Harry months to accept that he was a Wizard but this, this seemed much easier, looking back on his interactions it had always been there. But it was still hard to reconcile with that he had heard so many times growing up.
caused Harry hadn’t gotten to know her well. But he did know she was very important to the twins, they said she was a sister to them, and they were much closer to her than Ginny. And for Harry that was all that mattered. So he followed the twin’s lead in this matter and didn’t wonder where she had found out he had gone through a creature inheritance. But he would send her a thank you letter regardless.
’. Harry looked down at his lap, warmth pooling there in a way he had never experienced. He would have to talk to one of his parents about it, worried something might be wrong with his body.
Harry finally looked up to meet Siles eyes again and was shocked by the concern he saw so blatantly displayed there. Harry could tell that the man wanted to comment on his size, but thankfully he didn’t
They continued hand in hand wandering the grounds, passing through the rose garden and into the apple orchard, the herb garden was next, followed by returning to the rose garden where they finally sat down for lunch.
"Good morning, Neville, did you sleep well? How is Harry? Bartok told me what happened last night when he retrieved the cloak." Anna asked, leading the way towards the dining room where his Gran was the only one sitting down, sipping her tea.
“Do you truly care for Harry Potter?” Bartok wanted to make sure none of them were faking their friendship. Sure they might not have known about their ex-family’s plots but that didn’t mean they couldn’t have nefarious plans of their own.
But when he tried to open the doors the wards flung him back, causing him to land in the middle of the muggle street. He was quick to cast a Notice-Me-Not ward and start blasting at the door. But the Black wards were ancient and formidable. The blood of every Black born sacrificed to strengthen them until it was an unbreakable fortress. That, however, didn’t stop him from trying.
Harry saw the look of disgust both Molly and Ron’s faces twisted into when they first saw him, and they weren’t quick enough to hide them. Harry’s heart fell that last bit, the last thread of hope he had held for their friendship snapping like an overly tight bowstring. They soon plastered on welcoming smiles, but Harry could see through them easily, and he knew that the only reason they were here was for an attempt by Dumbledore to get him to agree to leave with them.
Bartok had explained the fundamental laws of Terradore, the two most significant ones pertaining to Harry were that children were never to be left unattended in public and that underage magicals were allowed, and even encouraged, to use magic outside of school.
Bartok woke Harry as gently as he could, hoping not to wake his son’s mate.  Harry woke and realized that it was time to go, but when he tried to leave the bed, Neville held on tighter; trying to keep Harry within his grasp as he started blinking his eyes open.
So now, with all this in mind and the revelation that there might be something wrong with Arthur and Molly’s marriage Harry was leaning more to trusting him. Considering what Molly had planned for Harry, he wondered if she had done something similar to Arthur.
Bartok leaned forward as well, searching his good friends face. “I wasn’t sure how you would react, you know the man who is responsible for my son’s situation. I know you would never stand for it, but he had to come first. Also, I just haven’t had the time and have been gathering the information needed for a court case.”
Once they finished Fred and George cleaned up while Arthur headed to the living room so they could talk to each other. Arthur took up his old, but plush chair and the boys were soon sitting together on the loveseat. Arthur knew the twin’s relationship wasn’t that of normal brothers. But he also knew they were magical twins and that they shared a soul like his best friends, Fabian and Gideon.
It was utterly still in Harry’s hands, and before any of them could try and warn their son to wait, to give Lyle the time to scan it for dark spells, the box was open. Everyone held their breath, watching in fear as Harry reached in and lifted what was inside.
Once they were all sure that their son was knocked out, they finally started discussing the plans for moving. Anna volunteered to visit all their parents to ask if they could borrow their House-Elves services while Issy and Lyle planned to visit the markets to buy any new furniture needed to fill the much larger house. Bartok had to finish the paperwork for the Vampire’s case before he started the papers Terradore would need for the change of address and lastly, David would help direct the Elves.
Harry took this all in, went over the new information in his head. He considered what his parents told him about the contract Dumbledore and Molly had constructed for him and Ginny. And Harry could be nothing but furious. He wanted to make them pay for trying to trick him. He needed to make them pay, not just for him but for everyone, Harry was sure Dumbledore had done this to other people before. Mind made up he told everyone around him his decision, worried that they might think him spiteful. But none of them looked anything but approving, Augusta, Neville, and Sirius more so than anyone.
“Dad?” Harry whispered, not wanting to scare David like he had Lyle. David fluttered his eyes open, moaning, and throwing a hand over his eyes.
Harry made his way over to the other side of the bed, crawling under the duvet, pulling his teddy and soft blanket to his chest. Eyes half-lidded as he watched Neville awkwardly get into the bed too. They faced each other but were still at least eleven feet apart. Harry reached out a hand towards the middle of the bed, Neville doing the same. Their hands nowhere near touching but just the thought of being closer calmed Harry, the lights in the room turning off with a command.
“Mr. Claremore!” Fudge called out again. But Bartok took a step forward, pretending not to hear when the Minister spoke. However, the man didn’t seem willing to let it go and instead yelled out, “Mr. Claremore! I am the British Minister of Magic! You will listen to me as long as you are on British soil. Now, be expecting a visit in three days to assess the situation ourselves. Good day.” The Minister barked out, face red in anger at having been ignored.
“I, Godric Gryffindor, command you to remain silent. Your vow to school states your loyalty to Hogwarts and the founders to have your portrait hanging here.”
Arthur’s vision was red with rage. He didn’t understand. He couldn’t understand. But he knew the Goblins would never lie about such a thing.
Now everyone was starting to wake, Anna already up and dressed in a neat pantsuit. Issy was just blinking awake, hair in a wild halo around her head and drool yet to be wiped from her chin. Bartok couldn’t find her state of confusion to be anything but endearing. She looked down at Harry who was still clutched tightly in her arms as if wondering where they were before looking around to find the room much bigger than their old chambers. It took her a full minute before she gave up and just buried her face into Harry’s growing curls.
Harry frowned but guessed it was just lingering embarrassment about what had happened earlier, which Harry could understand since he still felt strange about the whole situation. But he was glad it was Neville who had come to him, it would have been far worse if it was anyone else. Neville had seen him in some of his weakest moments and Harry knew Neville would never use this against him.
“Ah, I see… Your core bindings must have blocked your ability to form your familiar bond with Miss Hedwig. We’ll have to visit a Magizoologist to get that fixed up.” David started going through the list of trustworthy Magizoologist they could get in touch with to fix this problem. The reason they couldn’t just go to a vet was to fix Harry’s ability to bond with Hedwig they would need a Magizoologist with experiences with mind magics. And none of the Claremores would ever trust Harry’s mind to just anyone.
Molly was obviously panicked but the potion did its job and was soon spilling her secrets. “The only reason we are being charged is that he turned into a filthy creature!” Molly screeched.
While he was nervous, Severus knew he wouldn't be able to ignore his body forever, the feelings of sexual frustration would only come back stronger. And this was his body, it was his, and he knew there was no reason to be anxious.
He was directed to a conference room he had rented out for the meeting. Helix was already waiting there. They spent the time waiting for their guests by talking about investments they were thinking about making.
Even with the confident whip of their robes and steady gazes, Harry noticed how different they looked. Snape’s haunting, deep black eyes contrasted sharply with Percival’s strangely warm blue ones. Snape’s black, lank hair hung obscuring his face while Percival’s blond hair was perfectly quaffed. Percival’s straight nose and thin lips a contrast to his Professor’s notorious aquiline nose and full lips. Their contrasts were striking and Harry imagined them standing toe to toe, assessing eyes trailing down their long bodies.
If at anytime you notice a spelling/grammar mistake please let me know. The same goes for if you think I am missing a tag.
“You got me there,” Lyle chuckled at the mischief brimming in his son’s eyes before turning to his younger brother. “And what can I do for you?” He asked, sitting beside Harry and motioning for Siles to take the chair across from them.
“When I finished- I- There was no toilet paper and- It sprayed my- It sprayed me with water,” Harry stuttered out, too humiliated to just say that the stupid toilet sprayed his bottom with water. His butthole still felt strange from the attack.
Lyle looked over at David’s awe-filled face. “We just dodged a bullet, didn’t we?” All David could do was nod before collecting himself and starting downstairs. Lyle following in his shadow so that if it came to it, he could use David’s larger body as a shield.
They all sat in silence, waiting for midnight to come, now opening watching the bed as time ticked down.
“Oh, honey, I am so sorry I scared you! Mummy would never hurt you, I was just scared myself.” Issy was heartbroken that she had frightened her child, she didn’t know what she would do if she lost Harry’s trust.
Neville was determined to soak up all she taught him. He still was confident in himself but he was confident in his Gran’s teachings. So he relaxed back into his chair, listening while the others started talking again.
“I wasn’t aware of any abuse,” Dumbledore replied calmly, but the tightness of his fists, fingernails digging into his palms gave away how furious he was. “I placed him with his relatives so that he could know the love of a family. Had I known things were this bad, I would have placed him in the Weasley's’ care. But now that this has come to light I am sure they would be more than willing to welcome Harry into their home. After all, Molly and Arthur already view him as one of their own, and Ronald is his best friend.”
Sundays were Arthur’s day off, and even though he had the chance to sleep in he never did. He liked to be up for as long as possible to spend as much time as possible with his children. When he got out of bed Molly was still asleep, the line of pillows that separated their sides of the bed like a metaphor for their marriage. Arthur was still unsure of why he had married her but he knew the reason he stayed. He stayed with Molly for his children. Three of his older boys were now living on their own and had all come to him once they moved out to ask why he had married her. It was when Bill first asked that Arthur really started questioning it. Sure he hadn’t been happy since before Ron was born but he never questioned why.
Fudge looked furious, obviously frustrated that his change in time hadn’t got the results he wanted, Umbridge who was at the Minister’s side was just as pink as her hideous hat. The case went fast, and Dumbledore tuned everything else out as he worked on patching up his core. This case was in the bag, he had nothing to worry about. That was until the votes were tallied up. Somehow the case had been dismissed. Dumbledore couldn’t help that his mouth fell open, he couldn’t believe it.
I leave to Lucius Abraxas Malfoy and Narcissa Asteria Malfoy nee Black of Wiltshire, England, if they shall survive me, Vault 589. If they are unable to accept this bequest it is to be held in trust by Andromeda Druella Tonks nee Black of London, England, for Draco Lucius Malfoy.
“Okay,” Harry mumbled, still staring at their feet, noticing how much longer Neville’s were than his.
As soon as it had started, it was over, and no matter how they tried, none of the older Claremores could move to try and protect their son or each other. But as the foreign magic faded, they all regained the use of their bodies and were rushing towards Harry who was still within Issy’s arm.
The day shift nurse, Madam Charlotte, who always seemed to be manning the desk at the entrance of the Janus Thickey Ward when they arrived greeted both Augusta and Neville warmly. Pulling out a lollipop for Neville like she always had since Neville could first remember. He took it, popping it in his mouth without thought, the flavor of spearmint and tea a comfort.
Harry stayed like that, growing bolder by the second, fingers brushing through soft brown hair. Heavy eyelids started fluttering open, lashes caressing sleep reddened skin. Neville smiled before his eyes even opened, a large hand coming to cup Harry’s cheek. Neville finally opened his eyes, all melted chocolate, and affection, fingers sweeping across Harry’s face, lingering over eyebrows, dimples, moles, and lips, finally starting to scratch blunt nails through sleep-mussed hair.
"You might want to try and contact Severus Snape; he recently quit his job at Hogwarts, and if I am correct he is the youngest person to ever receive their Potion's Mastery on Earth." Neville very carefully didn't look over at his Gran, she knew how the man had treated Neville and had often tried to get Dumbledore to do something about it, but the man never had. But now that they knew that Severus had never meant any of what he had done, Neville was unsure what his Grandmother would think about Severus working on his parent's cure. But the Longbottom Heir would suggest it anyway. The man was renowned for his Potion's ability, and Neville would do anything in his power to help his parents. So if that meant suggesting a man who had tormented him, against that man's will, he would do it again and again.
When Godric presented him with the renovated potions lab with a connected library that Godric made him just for him, Salazar had squealed. His smile wide and cheeks bright before knocking him down and ripping his robes open to take him down his throat in one swift movement. Buttons flying everywhere and Godric dizzy with the sudden change in altitude.
Harry looked as if he had been struck by the question. Like he had never realized he had even thought that until this second. Sirius relaxed, realizing what was happening as the two adults allowed Harry all the time he needed to think.
Dumbledore scowled and spun on his heal, he had long ago edited the wards to allow him to apparate onto the grounds, but once he tried again, he was bounced back, slammed back onto the dirt pathway.  His magic exploded out of his control, leaving large fissures in the Earth surrounding his feet. It was then that Albus felt the lack of connection with the school, the Earth falling back to the ground as he anxiously searched all the external magic connected to him. There was a gaping hole in his core where his connection to the school had once been, steadily leaking magic. Another hole had been punched through him, his bond with Fawkes broken.
Bartok then looked at David and Lyle who were on Harry’s other side. They were spooned up tightly together, David pressed tightly to Lyle’s chest with the Tengu’s hands curled protectively over his heart and stomach.
But here she was, doing what she could to protect him. Severus knew that no matter what happened Minerva would stay at the school, her concern for the children under her care overriding any hatred she might feel to the current Headmaster. At that, she would do everything in her power to destroy Dumbledore from within the walls he thought he was safest in.
Percival once again bowed towards Harry and the boy couldn’t help but wonder why he received this treatment when all his parents got handshakes or even a hug in Bartok’s case. But his curiosity was only mild so he didn’t bother thinking on it longer. Instead, he just enjoyed the contentment that rolled off his parents in waves.
“Mr. Dumbledore, you will find that, since our hosts have committed no crime and have already asked you to leave, you are now trespassing. And I, as a Head Auror have every right to take you into custody if you do not vacate these premises within a minute,” Percival stated calmly, raising his wand a fraction and shifting into a dueling stance.
They continued to talk about what the plan was to help Frank and Alice heal, Neville listening to everything carefully before he finally spoke up.
Issy hugged the much larger man goodbye, whispering for his ears only, “If you hurt my child no one will find your body.” Her smile was innocent, and Godric was thankful that she and Helga never met. The destruction they would have rained down on the world was unimaginable.
Percival had even parted with one of the Graves family wards from their grimoire. Which was what Lyle was currently working on; the man had jumped for joy and started ranting about how elegant the rune set was.
Bartok seemed to soften, his body relaxing back into the couch, “I think Harry would appreciate that. I just would like to know what you will be telling him beforehand, just so we know if there is anything we need to add.”
Neville and Augusta were both impressed by the lobby they landed it, a kind woman waiting for them, her steel-grey hair and maternal face. Anna introduced her as Healer Lorraine and the woman was quick to call her staff to get Frank and Alice settled. The room was more of a suite and far less clinical of that at St. Mungos, It even had a real window that looked out onto a large garden that Neville could see patients wandering in.
Anna took this pause to speak up, “This is one of the many reasons I choose to work in Terradore; I don’t have the patience for politics in a hospital setting.”
“Cub, you look so healthy,” Remus said, shocked by how much Harry had changed in less than two months.  Remus had thought Harry’s gauntness had been due to worry about Sirius Black ruining his appetite. But now that was obviously not true, the fact he had grown at least five inches in that time told of something much more sinister. Remus looked over Harry’s shoulder to see five adults, all looking at Remus warily as if they were waiting to see if he would hurt his own cub. Their care was obvious and for that alone Remus wouldn’t just run with Harry in his arms and never look back. His wolf was also absolutely silent, and after weeks of following its lead Remus was left adrift. In such a short time he had come to rely on it.
So far, Albus had just sat silently, assessing the whole situation, scanning them all for any details he could gleam. But as soon as he noticed Harry looking at him, his eyes started twinkling, Grandfatherly demeanor back in place like a well-worn mask. “Yes, my boy, we had no word from you, you really worried us. And when I got no response from your Hogwarts letter, I couldn’t help but assume the worst.”
He was sure his Gran would turn a blind eye if somehow Harry’s new guardians were to be poisoned with some obscure plant if it came down to that. She was the one after all who had provided him with various illegal plants at the age of fifteen. She
“I will go out and buy you some books about puberty, sexuality, and sex in general if you like?” Sirius wanted to be useful, wanted to help his pup with anything he could. But he wasn’t as eloquent was Remus and didn’t want to risk giving Harry false information, so books were all he could offer.
Sal sighed, eyes fluttering open, deep green orbs gazing back into his. His face turns into a pout, lower lip sticking out cutely. “And here I was expecting a handsome prince, but instead I’m only greeted by your ugly mug.” He gives a massive put-upon sigh.
After they got through that, Remus restarted the memory, Dorea going over the importance of consent, safety, and enjoying what was happening. She repeated many times that anyone involved had the right to decide they wanted to stop at any time and that needed to be respected.
They planned to have the whole house, except for the Floo room, empty by the time Fudge and Dumbledore visited. The Clan didn’t want to let the two know their plans to move so they would hold the meeting in the Floo room to give the appearance that nothing had changed.
Harry pulled further into himself, unsure of what to do. After a few seconds of the man looking at him expectantly, Harry finally whispered his first name.
Issy groaned, too comfy in Anna’s lap to want to move and she had planned to spend the whole day with Harry. But Anna, ever practical went straight into healer mode, lifting Issy as she stood. “I am sorry Harry, but if they came here, it is something we have to check on. I promise we will be back before dinner. Plus both you and David look like you need a nap.” Anna smiled slightly, but there was a tightness to her eyes. She pressed a kiss to Harry’s head where he was curled around David in his wolf form, both with eyes half-lidded. Before she threw Issy over her shoulder like a sack of potatoes.
They were lost in their own world, unable to see how his break down was affecting the others. Augusta clutched a delicate flower teacup in her hand, fingers curled so tight that if the porcelain hadn't been reinforced it would have surely shattered at her touch. David and Lyle looked on anxiously, both wanting to do something but knowing they weren’t wanted at this moment. Anna was contemplating handing over a calming draught but believed that this would happen sooner or later and it might as well be now.
Anna leaned closer to Augusta who was on her left, “I have heard a bit about your son and daughter-in-law’s condition due to Bartok’s work in Britain. I am not sure if anything can be done for them but I think it would be best to move them. I know of a few very good clinics who deal with long term spell damage solely. And one that specifically deals with brain damage, I know the Head Healer personally and she is very dedicated.”
After they finished up, Bartok wiping a smudge of grease from Harry’s lips, they headed to the bank. Harry’s head swiveling around the whole way. This was the first time Harry had the chance to see Terradore. The marketplace was grand, hundreds of different stores and stands, people going about their own business without pausing for a moment to stare at Harry.
Neville had been a nervous wreck since the start of summer break. Ever since Harry came into his life, snatching Trevor up before their sorting and returning the adventurous toad to him with a nervous smile, Neville had known that all he wanted was to keep Harry by his side. That feeling had only grown with each interaction, the honest curiosity Harry’s face held whenever Neville started ranting about plants, or the way Harry offered to help with Neville’s casting, never a smidge of judgment in his offers.
Albus Dumbledore was furious, the glass trinket that smashed against the walls of the ancestral Weasley manor not helping in calming his temper. Yesterday he had awoken to the stomach-dropping feeling of falling, but as this was a common phenomenon, it didn’t worry him. Right up to the moment when his body hit the dew-damp ground with a heavy thud. The side he landed on bruising almost immediately. That wasn’t the first time he had cursed the fragility of his aging body, but at that moment, he was more worried about what had happened. Albus could remember falling asleep in his bed within the Headmaster’s tower, but somehow he was now laying in the dirt in front of the Hogwarts wrought iron gates, the guardian gargoyles sneering down at him.
Bartok flushed, clearing his throat before speaking, “Yes you have, when we adopted you. Please understand Harry that I did not make that promise lightly. Remember the circumstances, you were blind and unable to read a magically binding contract that could have said anything. It could have made you a slave. Swearing on my life was the correct Oath to make in such a case, it guaranteed that we were in no way trying to trick or harm you. If I had lied I would have been struck down immediately and you would have known you weren’t safe with us.”
Suddenly the huge wolf that was sharing his bed was replaced by his Dad. David looking a cool as a cucumber, no sign of shame. Harry was going to scold his Dad, but he was being tackled by the flying form of his Daddy. Lyle using his wind powers to land softly on his son as he started rolling around, pulling David into it until they were all breathless with laughter.
“I know, I know, as soon as we can we will go get the bond fixed so you can tell me all about it. I promise.” Hedwig looked pleased with this, allowing him to preen her head feathers in reward. Harry was also excited to hear whatever she had to share with him, could only imagine what she would first say to him.
Before Neville came to her, his Grandmother hadn’t taught him the Black ways, when he asked why she said she didn’t think he would be interested in what she had to teach. Neville understood why she would think such a thing, he had never before shown much interest in the Black side of his family, mainly due to his hatred of Bellatrix. And while he still wasn’t fond of the skills he now had, he knew that if he had to use them to protect someone he loved he would do so readily. His Gran’s motivations had been similar, she wanted him to know these skills so that if he was ever in danger he would be able to save himself.
It took them another four hours to clear out all of Dumbledore’s hideaways that Godric knew of. The incredible amount of wealth they found shocked them all, even Rowena and Salazar were wide-eyed. But they were soon weighed down with more riches than they could ever imagine. Priceless artifacts from all over the worlds. It was absolutely shocking.
When Harry asked about lunch, Neville turned to him, finally seeming to notice that he was surrounded by other people and that there was food in front of him. Harry repeated his question, hopeful smile smeared with bacon grease at the edges. Neville’s face became impossibly soft, agreeing to the plan.
“What are your intentions towards my son?” Godric had never heard the normally bubbly woman seem so cold. He looked at Issy, her blue eyes glacial, as she seemed to stare at his soul.
“Mr. Potter, it’s great to see you again,” Fudge finally greeted, completely ignoring the Claremores, and this more than anything pissed Harry off.
Harry took in a long breath, nose buried in the flowers. They smelt terrific but were utterly indescribable. He felt motivated, and it was strange, but then he pulled back, still feeling that motivation, but it was far less insistent.
Dumbledore froze in shock. The Goblins had conducted an audit and not only that, they were now demanding he return the money and items that were rightfully his but they were also charging him interest.
We also have a course of potions to help reduce any other effects of long term hospitalization. The biggest thing we noticed, other than the muscle degradation, was the change to their hair. At this point, we believe that is due to extended periods of stress. Which is both a good and bad thing. Them having the ability to be stressed means there is are more brain activities than St. Mungos indicated. On the flip side, there are very genuine downsides to long term stress, one of them is the weakening of the heart's muscles. As soon as we realized that we put them on a course of potions to help lower their heart rates to give the heart a chance to heal. Once it is a tad better, we will start using more aggressive potions to completely heal the heart."
Harry’s teeth clicked together harshly as he tried to hold his tongue, but the anger that flooded him was too much to hold back, and he was soon yelling. “You weren’t aware?!” Everyone turned to look at him, eyes wide, but most of all, the fury that started to show on Dumbledore’s face fueled his own. “I begged you not to send me back! I told you that they hurt me, that I wasn’t safe there! But year after year, when I asked for help, you kept saying I was over-exaggerating. That living there was for the best! You sent me back!”
Lorraine pulled out a piece of paper, handing a copy over to each of them after asking if Augusta was okay with Anna knowing the treatment plan. "The first thing we will be doing is physical therapy, helping them regain their muscle tone so that they can move around easily, paired with a food program to help them gain their lost weight. We will then start healing the less delicate nerves in their body. At this point, we don't want to go anywhere near their brain, as we don't want to risk making it worse until we have a full understanding of their current brain function. We have a few Muggle-born members of staff who have studied and adapted EEG to work with magic, so we can pinpoint damaged areas and make plans to heal what we can. But until then we will work on things such as their hands, so they can regain their fine motor controls. This will allow them to participate in activities around the clinic, so they don't sit around all day. The next thing we will do is judge what they are still able to do, see if their creativity is still there, and if their muscle memory is working by doing things such as tasks they had been doing for years, like brushing their teeth.
Instead, he just enjoyed how happy Harry looked, the excited way Harry talked about everything that had happened. He also asked his new guardians if Remus could come over later with a guest to talk about what they had found out. At that part, Harry’s excitement diminished but he was quick to change the subject to the roses in the garden at their home.
“My mate accidentally misrepresents my work. As it is now, there is no real cure for infected lycanthropy-” David was quick to continue as he saw the hope dimming in Remus’ eyes. “What we are researching is essentially a workaround. You see, we found the recipe for the potion that was given to Peter Stubbe and one of the main ingredients was the blood of a born Werewolf. The problem was that since the blood was taken unwillingly, it corrupted the potion’s intention and made it Black magic. We feel that if it wasn’t for that, the potion would have worked as intended in this case. As for the workaround, the team I am a part of are close to developing a method to purge the Black magic taint in conjunction with a blood adoption process to replace the infected blood with healthy blood. Theoretically, the blood adoption process is used to introduce willingly given Were blood to purge the Black magic that drives the wolf insane during the full moon. During the following full moon, the transition is complete as the wolf becomes a part of the host.”
If he didn’t know it was, Boudicca, Salazar’s Familiar, he would have momentarily panicked. She did not sport the brilliant red plumage that his friend did, but her scales gleamed the same Bloodstone mix of almost black, green scales with flecks of ruby red and silver.
Sal blushed as he always had when either of the women ever complimented them. It was the only time outside of bed Godric ever saw the other blush, and it always made his heart pound.
Harry allowed himself to be guided through the rest of the house, taking in everything he could while not allowing it to overwhelm him. Soon they were back in the breakfast room, an obvious favorite over the other dining rooms for its magnificent view. They elected to eat lunch a little before noon since they wanted to get to the bank early.  After their lunch of sandwiches and soup, they sat around waiting for Percival to arrive.
Harry took a shaky breath and placed the frame gently down on the desk, letting his fingers give the golden frame one last caress before he moved away. If he looked back he would be too tempted to stand there for hours, staring at the new photo of his Father.
Anna looked up from her paperwork to watch both of them, Issy’s face was still hard, judging Godric’s truthfulness. Anna reached over and gently slapped Issy’s arm, “Issy, love, he’s telling the truth.”
Inside was a golden ring that had the Potter crest, family gemstone in the middle. Harry had spent hours looking over his charms and now knew all the crests by heart. Harry tentatively reached out, the metal vibrating under his touch and he lifted the cold ring, spinning it between his grasp before lowering it onto his right ring finger. As it descended his finger, the ring tightened until it was snug, hugging his skin and magic like a warm hug enveloping Harry.
Charlie and Percy arrived seconds after each other, rushing over to Bill to try and figure out what was going on. Bill was quick to summarize, handing the spiked pot of tea over to Charlie to try and figure out what Ron and Ginny knew of the situation. Charlie filled two mugs and rushed up the stairs, taking a few seconds to school his features to not let anything show.
Godric was surprised that with the state of the wards that the castle hadn’t fallen down around them. It must be Hogwarts herself diverting what little power she had left to hold the structure together. Salazar knelt down, laying his long-fingered hands against the amethyst patch in front of him. They could both feel the quiet but weak hum of anticipation, thrumming through their bones. Godric let himself sing back, reassurance in every note.
On cue Harry’s tummy rumbled, causing the boy to blush but excitedly get up and make his way to the bathroom. It was large but still modest, the tub big enough for at least three people. Harry got ready for the day quickly, too excited to waste any time.
He also offered his services, willing to send her and anyone she trusted purging potions, since he was sure the old fucker would have no qualms about dosing anyone to get his way. She agreed, telling him to send it to her with a compulsion spell on the letter to make sure she drank it. This trust was what finally allowed him to turn his back on her and start packing, swiftly but delicately gathering the plethora of potions equipment and supplies he had. Dumbledore, thinking Severus would never be able to escape had kept him supplied with an overabundance of rare and expensive ingredients. Many were illegal, and the only reason Severus bothered taking them was that he rather them be out of Dumbledore’s reach.
Godric flamed into the outer chamber, the once glistening onyx walls now dull and covered in algae. Salazar would gasp in horror if he saw it, so Godric preemptively called for the current Head House-Elf. Dumbledore always hated the Hogwarts Elves since they knew what he was and could not be controlled. All he had going for him in that regard was the original contract with the first House-Elves to settle in the castle had a clause about keeping the school’s secrets.
It took Dumbledore a few seconds of furious blinking, in which time the creatures rathered up their belongings and started to leave, for him to get together enough to drag Fudge and two Aurors after them. Now more than ever it was essential to confront Bartok Claremore, hopefully just being confronted by their party in the Ministry itself would be enough to get what he wanted.
The Floo flared, and Molly stumbled out, ash covering every inch of her. The moment she arrived she was shrieking, voice like claws on a chalkboard. She was obviously frustrated by his lack of response and she finally reached out, shaking his shoulders violently.
“Sal as is Salazar Slytherin?” She almost squeaked, but she was still focused on the women in front of her.
I also want to say that yes at this point Harry is very emotional both because he still can't see and all the Claremores do is in such contrast to what he knows that he is constantly being overwhelmed. Once he can see and gets used to this new life he will calm down a lot.
Both times Charlie had met the young Potter he watched the way the young teen behaved and moved, watched the way his twin brothers fell into his orbit. Charlie had felt the same pull, his protective urges flaring up, born from his love of family and want to protect all of his younger brothers.
David watched this intently, trying to figure out what was happening. “Harry, have you not completed the bond?”
Bartok, however, sat in his chair silently, looking away, wanting to give the two a modicum of privacy. Issy skipped into the room, not noticing the somber air or their now silently sobbing guest. “So we don’t have to worry about having Grandbabies anytime soon, poor Harry is so innocent!” She giggled and jumped towards Bartok, landing happily in his lap.
Molly’s face was blotchy and her eyes were bloodshot. Arthur didn’t care, however. He motioned for her to sit, pouring her a cup of tea as if to comfort her. Her sigh was watery as she took in a sip, like any British person, magical or not, tea was a comfort.
Harry enjoyed his breakfast burrito so much that he ordered seconds, gushing over the chorizo and tomatillo sauce. Bartok was happy to see his son’s growing appetite as he enjoyed a cheese danish. He planned to buy Tiptop some cookbooks on food around the world as a present since Harry loved trying new things. He suggested that after Harry returned home that maybe he and Neville could explore the house, something his son was quick to agree with. With all that had happened, Harry hadn’t had the chance just to explore his new home in full.
“I won the yearly lottery the Daily Prophet holds and while I put most of it away. I bought tickets to the World Cup, Ministry workers get a discount so I had plenty enough to buy a ticket for Harry. I will understand if you don’t feel comfortable allowing Harry to come with us but I still want to extend the invite.”
Anna pulled off the silver chain she wore around her neck, obviously used for just this reason as she tapped it and turned it into a Portkey. They had to guide Alice’s shuffling form over to the bed so they could all hold onto the chain. They coaxed Alice into bed, getting her to scooch as close to Frank as possible, and then Anna cast a spell on both Alice and Frank that healers used to stabilize their position for when they moved. And soon, they were being whisked away.
Severus was sure that the slightest touch would set him off, his breath was already coming out in pants, and at this point, he just wanted to get this first time over with. He could take his time once he wasn't so sensitive.
Healer Lorraine seemed to understand Augusta's hesitation to accept her treatment plan, so many others had proposed treatments, promising resulting only for nothing to change. "You probably do not know this, but your son saved my great-granddaughter during the last war in Britain. She was only eight. As a Were-Horse family is the most important thing to me, the least I can do is make sure I do everything I can to see him, if not healed, at least living the best life possible for him."
“The Dursleys, they always said, that it was unnatural, disgusting, freakish…” Harry’s soft whisper breaking Remus from his sorrow. Remus knew that he and Sirius would have to talk about it, but for now, they needed to be here for their cub, their problems were secondary.
“Mr. Black-” Bartok started, but Sirius was quick to cut him off and insist they all call him by his first name. “Sirius, then, I would be willing to take on your case if that is what you want.” Bartok offered his services and Sirius was quick to agree, they spent the remainder of the afternoon planning out how they would gain Sirius’ freedom. They agree that the first step was to seek asylum in Terradore and then petition for citizenship.
Neville just waved his hand, looking sheepish as he answered Harry’s question, voice cracking on the last word. “A bee just landed on me is all.” Harry nodded in understanding, while bees were harmless it was still startling when one landed on you unexpectedly. Harry sat back across from Neville, legs outstretched on either side of Neville’s body and arms behind him holding up his weight. Neville giggled for some unknown reason but soon Harry was following him, both laughing until their bellies ached and their eyes were brimming with tears.
“My family and I would never do anything to put Harry at risk, I can’t promise we will never do anything that might make him unhappy but we would only do it if the reason behind it was for his best interests,” Bartok assure, Charlie concentrating hard on the crystal to make sure there wasn’t the slightest flicker of red.
It was at the end of their First year that Neville recognized his feelings for the brunet. When he heard that Harry was in the hospital wing in a magical coma, Neville realized that he never wanted to be separated from the other boy. The twins were the ones to inform him of Harry’s status, all three sneaking out in the middle of the night to visit Harry, unable to wait for morning. They were at his side as often as possible over the next three days until Harry awoke
Molly looked as if she had seen something foul before she spoke up, hissing once again. “Albus has them locked up in one of his family manors, using them to fuel his magic. Good luck getting to them, they’re under blood wards and no one will believe you if you try to tell them.” Molly was laughing again, obviously thinking she was untouchable.
Remus shot Bartok a distressed look, the two sharing an entire conversation in seconds. Remus got up and rushed out of the room. Harry looked at his Papa in confusion.
Harry felt like his body was turning to goo, his bones becoming jelly and something deep within his belly wiggling like a worm on a hook. But he had to ignore that, Neville’s hands were still on his body, slowly making him unbearably hot under his layers of blankets. Luckily for Harry, Neville pulled back after one last sweep of curious fingers over the tip of his fox ears, and his friend was rolling out of bed, silk pants low on his hips as he made his way to the restroom.
Warning, the last section of this chapter has a sex scene. I haven't written one in a long time so I hope it is good. Please let me know what you think!
As soon as Remus laid eyes on his cub, he was rushing towards him, lifting Harry within his arms and spinning him around. The giggle that echoed through the room lifted Remus’ soul. For so long, all he wanted was to have his mate and his cub. He now had his mate back but Harry was still out of his reach, but now he was just happy to see Harry. Dumbledore had come to Grimmauld Place and claimed that Harry had been abducted. However, his wolf had screamed at him, like it had throughout the whole school year, to rip the man’s throat out.
“Ah, Mrs. Claremore and Mrs. Claremore I would not have disturbed you if it wasn’t an emergency I could only go to you with. My health is not that.” Godric’s exhaustion was evident in his voice was the slightest bit shaky.
There he was, lying amidst deep green bed covers, hands laying atop each other on the duvet. He was just as beautiful as always, face wrinkle free and thick dark lashes fanning across pale cheeks.
He had been wandering the manor for about an hour now, just walking the halls with a goofy smile spread across his face, enjoying the feelings Neville inspired in him.
They had yet to talk about what had happened, but Remus suspected, that after the revelations of last night that the distance had not been Sirius’ idea. Remus wished he would have realized it sooner. But there was no way he could. It had been an emotional time for all of them, the world consumed with loss. Each day they listened to the radio and read the papers, worried if they would see a friend among the long list of the dead.
After that, they ate their wonderful meal, conversation lighthearted, Tiptop scolding Harry into eating seconds. They sat back for a few minutes, letting their food settle before Lyle hopped up to retrieve the present he had got Harry for his birthday.
He settled, worry easing with how nice the place seemed. The healers were soon scanning the two Longbottoms, Anna helping out and one of the nurses asking Augusta questions about their previous care and treatments. His Grandmother seemed just as overwhelmed but she was quick to hide it and get down to business.
Last night had been torturous, it was soon evident just how naive Harry was, and while it was charming it was also frustrating. Neville knew Harry didn’t mean to tease him but that short glance he had of knobbly knees, skinny thighs and soft pink cock, tight balls almost completely hidden by a thatch of wild black hair had driven him mad. He had been on edge through his whole explanation of how a bidet worked, the only thing keeping him soft was the knowledge that Harry needed him and willpower. But then Harry returned to the bedroom, soft black silk tented slightly at the crotch and Neville had been done. He only had so much control.
Also, note in this story Hogwarts begins at 13 and ends at 19. Their first year combines the curriculum for the original 1 and 2 year since they are older and can handle the busier schedule.
Remus had rested a hand on Neville’s shoulder to try and comfort him but now decided to speak up about another subject. “I know you said Harry’s illegal marriage contract was dissolved but have you considered calling upon Lady Magic to pass judgment?”
Bartok looked over at the painting of the Terradore marketplace they had hanging on one of the walls. His voice was soft, slightly hesitant. “I was stopped after court by Fudge and Dumbledore, they were rather… insistent, they conduct a home visit to assess how Harry is doing.” Everyone at the table stiffened, Tiptop gripping a steak knife as if she was about to stab someone. Harry moved closer to Anna. “I think it’s time we finally did as you suggested, Anna, and move to the manor in Terradore.”
Harry was still skeptical, it was something Petunia said to him when he was much younger, and he could remember having many nightmares about it. And while he now knew the Dursleys had lied to him about many things, and he shouldn’t trust anything they told him, he couldn’t get rid of that long-held fear.
There Harry was, bright green eyes glittering at him, wild hair now more curly with the added length. But the two things that shocked Neville the most were the new additions, a beautiful pair of ears and a fluffy tail waving out of control behind him. Then there was how healthy he looked, and all the tension Neville had been holding since he first realized what Harry’s home life was like melted away.
Tears formed in Godric’s eyes, and he buries his face in Salazar’s neck, breathing in his deep earthy scent, forcing himself to stay calm. “Sal..” He swallowed thickly, “Sal, it’s been over 2000 years.”
The door opened again, Professor Snape strolling in, pitch black robes billowing in his wake, reminding him of Percival entering their home earlier. Harry looked up where the man was still stationed behind him, watching everyone like a hawk.
“I am assuming your new title of Daddy would have something to do with it?” Siles questioned, once again looking Harry, who was now curled into Lyle’s side, up and down.
A loud thumping started, Harry looked over to see Remus now thumping his head against the wall. Sirius just started laughing again in response. Harry tried to jump up to stop Remus from hurting himself but Sirius held him tight. The thumping continuing.
Sirius barked out a rough laugh, face messy with snot and tears but a gentle smile on his face. “It looks like Moony and I will have to give the pup the talk.” He smiled at Remus, still heartbroken but seeing the silver lining in the fact that he could now be there for his Godson and that Harry was safe. Sirius realized Remus was looking behind him and he turned to see what it was.
Sirius had often visited Longbottom Hall with young Harry, and he had been absolutely besotted and devoted. He loved like only a Black could, absolutely, madly, and in a way that was never-ending. Augusta felt so stupid for allowing her grief to cloud her judgment. Sirius had suffered. There was no one there to help her nephew in his time of need. She now knew that Dumbledore had been responsible, but she was sure that if only she had realized Sirius had been framed earlier she could have stopped him from going to jail. Poor Harry wouldn’t have been sent to grow up with those monsters. And Harry would have been hers.
“Sal, can’t you feel her?” Salazar shook his head, obviously confused. Godric moved closer, placing a hand over one of Sal’s and the other on his back. “Close your eyes, take in a deep breath. And let your magic feel out. Soak through the crystals into the castle’s heart.”
David removed his hand, squinting up at Harry as if he couldn’t see his face, reaching out a large palm to cup Harry’s cheek. “Sorry, Harry, it’s very dark, and we were all up late making sure your transition want okay.”
The next thing Harry knew his head was pillowed against firm thighs, a hand running steadily through his hair, blunt fingernails scraping across his scalp with each pass. Harry began to purr, tail flicking gently, and he finally looked up to see Neville looked down at him, grin soft, “Good afternoon, sleepy.”
Harry was surprised that anyone would make him heir just because he defeated Lord Voldemort, but then he thought maybe the Lord was old and had lost his family and had no one else to take over the heirship. “I would like to meet Lord Gaunt at some point so I can thank him and get to know the family history.” Harry wanted to make sure he honored this man and his family history.
Remus stepped up, laying a hand on both of their shoulders. “Your mothers often joked about creating a marriage contract between you two.” Remus couldn’t help the chuckle that bubbled from himself as Harry looked over in shock. Why was Moony talking about marriage? Harry wanted to ask but he was too scared. This information about his parents was more important than his questions. “It was, surprisingly, James that intervened. The Potters as a family have never allowed marriage contracts, they have always believed that its members should be able to choose to marry whoever they love.” Remus smiled longingly, “Of course, at the time he didn’t realize Alice and Lily were only joking.”
“Harry?” David questioned, worry filling his tone. He must have zoned out for some time for David to be so worried.
Suddenly a hand rested on his shoulder, and Harry looked up in surprise to see his Daddy standing behind him, smiling widely over at his brother. “You know, Harry, it’s polite to offer guests a seat,” Lyle teased, ruffling Harry’s growing curly hair.
Tiptop explained the situation to her fellow House-Elves, and they were all furious to know someone was trying to take away one of their younglings. They were quick to start packing everything on the ground floor and basement moved by the end of the first day. Tiptop had to run off the other Elves when she found them trying to feed her little master. Shooing them back to packing, allowing her the time to dote on her little master.
“We can talk about it later, for now, we have people to heal.” Anna’s tone was whip-like in its intensity. Godric wasn’t offended because he understood her laser-like focus on the task at hand. “Though if he went through anything like you, he will also be needing a checkup.”
Arthur was shocked, knees shaking. He hadn’t married Molly? “What?” Arthur asked his voice that of an uncertain child, lost. “But I remember our wedding?”
He steadied himself against the sink, hand slipping across the countertop, and breath still coming out as desperate pants. Lungs begging for air.
“You didn’t have to get me anything…” Harry blushed at Issy’s excitement, unused to such a fuss being made about his birthday, and despite his ever-present wanting, he felt horrible at the thought of them buying him presents. He had always been surprised when anyone gifted him anything. While Hedwig had been his first present the one to shock him most was when after two weeks of school, the Weasley twins who had been almost strangers at the time gifted him with a box of chocolate frogs. Since Ron had eaten all of the frogs Harry bought on the train, he hid the box away, savoring them and treating himself to one at the end of each school week.
Bill would do anything in his power to reunite his Fathers now that he knew. His Dad had been so unhappy for so long, and now to find out his happiness had been stolen Bill would make sure to fix this. Even if he had to commit a crime, and he knew all Brothers would help him in any way they could.
Salazar sounded so sincere and dismayed, Godric just couldn’t stand it, so he cut him off. “It’s not your fault, all that matters is that we are together again and we can spend the rest of our years together. They will be long, full of both joy and sorrow, but we will be together.”
Issy led him around the room, showing him the ridiculously large closet that was bigger than his last room and the bathroom which had a small swimming pool sized bathtub. But Harry was too overwhelmed to really think more on it all. Instead, he just let Issy guide him around the room, making a note to explore once he is alone.
“I also have something to give to you that might upset you a bit,” Bartok’s rich baritone commented.
David was soon bundling Harry through the floo, the adults still too worried to let Harry floo on his own. A spike in magic could cause the person flooing to end up in unexpected places and with Harry’s core still recovering from his inheritance and the core bindings, his magic still tended to spike. But with one of the adults to take him through, he was in no danger. When they arrived at the bank, one of the Goblin warriors led them to the meeting room the Will reading would be held in.
But until then they couldn’t move him. The spell Godric used couldn’t work miracles and if moved Dumbledore would wake.
Godric was quick to point out that just because his mate was bonding with more people that it didn't mean he would be romantically involved with the others.
Bartok marched out of Courtroom Ten, trying his best to hold his rage in. He was escorting his clients out of the Ministry, they were haggard and scared of the wizards around them. All wizards and witches who were blood traitors, those who betrayed their family history by standing against creatures, were glaring at their group.
She read the paper quickly, mouth dropping open and eyes shiny with tears. Molly dropped the paper in shock and was soon clutching at Albus, sobbing her eyes out. Her wailing only intensified Albus’ growing headache, but there was nothing he could do. His lack of magic stopped him from his usual tactic of just casting a spell on her and Molly’s tight grip wouldn’t allow him to get up to retrieve a calming draught.
“Bartok, please inform the Goblins that I will take care of the missing Potter artifacts.” Bartok nodded in surprise but didn’t question it. “When I return, I would like to properly introduce myself to Harry, I will also bring one other with me.”
Before Bartok could ask what they meant, their Father gave a great heaving sigh and spoke, grief obvious in every line of his body. “What my sons mean, is that Molly, Ginny, and Ron have all been disowned and stripped of every tie they held to the Weasley name.”
Harry relaxed some, relieved that he was wrong about Neville’s laughter, but also curious now why his friend wasn’t as shocked by the toilet as Harry was. Neville continued to speak, “This toilet has a feature called a Bidet, you might have heard of it before…” Harry shook his head but when he realized Neville’s gaze was still locked on the ceiling Harry told him that he had never before heard of it. “Okay, well, a Bidet, it… It washes your- ummm- bits after you have used the restroom and then dries you off. It is very common in Creature homes to help keep their tails clean, but most purebloods also have them.”
“Yes, please,” Harry nodded stiffly obviously worried about how this worked and what would be inside.
That had been the beginning of his friendship with Fred and George. Even with the revelation of what their mother and two younger siblings had done, Harry couldn’t imagine their friendship wasn’t honest. But still, there was that lingering doubt. All Harry would need to be sure was to see the look in their eyes. They had never before tried to hide anything from him, and even with the small things like presents they would tell Harry straight up why they were keeping things a secret.
“Well, Harry, do you want to see your new room?” Issy asked, hopping up and down in her seat in excitement. Harry was quick to agree, curious as to what else the house held, Issy and Anna lead him back through the house as his fathers got things ready for their trip to the bank. Anna pointed out rooms as Issy tried to rush them through the house to get to his rooms.
By the time Molly finally came back Arthur was at his seat at the head of the table, a pot of tea in front of him and newspaper at his side. Arthur had had to take a calming draught to make sure he didn’t give the game away.
“Father!?” An excited voice echoed through his mind. It was feminine but had undertones of shifting stones.
But secretly, within his own mind, he built a grimoire of all his discoveries and creations. Planning…
Neville was quick to explain the whole situation, Anna filling in the information she had about what happened when Harry touched the wand and what David had found out from his research.
Harry was shocked out of his stupor by the parchment, which had until then had been floating, rolling itself back up with a red ribbon and dropping down to Helix’s desk. Harry finally felt the tears that were silently rolling down his cheeks. A vial of a swirling blue potion was held within his line of sight, and Harry downed it without even wondering who it was who handed it to him, but he couldn’t really think at all. His whole world was consumed by the remembered voice of his Father.
He wished that he could go to his mate the moment he arrived, but he knew if he did Dumbledore would realize what was going on, so he had to keep his distance. All he could do was soar around the grounds when his mate was outside, going to every Quidditch match and practice. He almost broke into the matches twice when Harry was at risk of dying, but before he could, Harry was once again safe. He swore those times had taken at least twenty years off his life each.
Their little girl started to go weak in their arms. And they hurry to lift her. Her core was strained for far too long, and now that the binds were off she was trying to recoup all the magic she had lost. Godric conjured up a bed to lay her in, covers and bed hangings in a rich purple, her wild black hair fanning across the pillows. They spent a few minutes memorizing her face, taking in the beautiful blend of all their features: Helga’s slightly upturned nose and full cheeks, Rowena’s stern brow, and long face, Salazar’s eye’s and hair color and Godric’s curls and height.
Augusta's fist tightened around the fabric of her robe. To know that her children spent all these years in a state of stress so bad it had weakened their hearts, made her furious at the healers of St. Mungos for never realizing this. But at the same time, she wasn't mad at them, they had always done their best, their best just hadn't been good enough.
Arthur’s expression tightened, brows drawing closer together. “We have an issue. After you stormed out of the house an owl delivered these.” Arthur said as he lifted the newspaper to relieve three open envelopes. Molly paled at the sight of the Gringotts crest on the top of thick parchment, mouth gaping like a goldfish. “You wouldn’t happen to know anything about the thieving from Harry’s vault would you?”
They all went up to tuck Harry into bed, the young sub curling around his teddy and soft blanket, a small, almost nonexistent smile on his lips.
Harry picked up the smaller package, opening the letter that was tied on top. He recognized the writing as soon as he opened it, glad to see that it was the twins, his heart soaring.
All three paled and quickly made their way to the fireplace, Dumbledore throwing a last parting shot by saying, “The Minister only said you held custody,
“And Harry dear, yours was just as spectacular. You though, were much younger when it happened, when Lily and James first started bringing you over to Longbottom Hall for play dates they would put you in separate cribs for naps. You both would whine but eventually fall asleep. Weeks later, Alice and Lily walked into the nursery to find you both in Neville’s crib, they were both shocked. The next time they put you down for a nap they sat on the floor and watched to see what had happened. To their surprise, Harry, while asleep you levitated yourself into Neville’s bed. After that, they didn’t bother keeping you apart. Though you also apparated to Neville’s side more than once.” Augusta smiled at the memory, obviously lost in the memories of better times.
Remus seemed to recognize this struggle and pulled his wand out, it seemed to be brighter than anything else in this strange world. “I, Remus John Lupin, vow on my life and magic, that touching any part of your body, no matter how long, will not cause said body part to fall off.” The magic sealed itself around Remus, proving to Harry that he was being truthful. And like that, that fear was gone, it would still take him a while to fully accept that but Harry relaxed back into the settee.
that they are awaiting our arrival.” Anna tried for her usual calm but her sorrow still came through. Neville was just relieved she didn’t try to apologize for something she had nothing to do with.
So now he was escorting his clients to one of the apparition rooms. They all shared a small smile, and his clients were gone. They invited his family over for a celebratory dinner and swore they would all be falling straight into bed as soon as they got home.
“Helga, Row, please answer me, I am here now…” Godric pleaded, hoping their souls would hear and return to their side of the painting.
Harry looked at the box curiously, head tilted cutely to the side and ear straight up. Neville cleared his throat and asked as steadily as he could as he opened the box, “Will you allow me the honor?”
“Sal!” The man didn’t turn around or acknowledge him, so he tried again, voice booming and soul singing a calming tune. “Salazar Slytherin you listen to me now!” Sal turned around, eyes wild. Godric slowly walked up to him, as if the man was a cornered animal, hands clearly in sight.
For the past few days he had been stuck at the old fuckers side, the old wizard was frustrated when his pet Phoenix disappeared to parts unknown. It took him a few days to notice the absence before Dumbledore banned him from leaving.
He couldn’t get his hand around himself soon enough, his skin already slick with precum. Neville was too amped up to take his time like he normally would. Grip too tight and strokes too fast. But it felt so good, so damn good, and he had to muffle his moans, his fingers filling his mouth in an attempt to stay quiet.
Harry searched his face and couldn’t detect any hint of deception. But then – had he ever been able to read Malfoy?
He hums. One of his hands is still clenched on the headboard, but he drops the other to my bicep, squeezing where the muscles are flexing and releasing as I stroke him.
“You have such a beautiful cock.” Harry stroked it slowly, watching as the foreskin revealed the glistening pink head, covered it, revealed it. He licked his lips. “How is it that everything about you is perfect?”
Harry laughed. He reached up and tugged Draco down by the neck into a kiss. “Don’t be sorry. Fuck. Don’t ever be sorry for that. It was amazing. Better than anything I ever imagined.”
that?—but the thick, wet sound his cock makes when it hits the back of my throat has him inhaling sharply. My windpipe clenches with the urge to cough, but I stifle it with great effort. I want to be good for him.
Anyway, back to mooning (or not, as the case may be): Parkinson has noticed how perfect Hermione’s arse is, too, if the appreciative look on her face is anything to go by. I narrow my eyes, hoping my glare will warn her off. What is she even doing here? She should have stopped coming to our DA reunion pub nights after she and Luna broke up. It’s DA members and partners only. That’s the
“Hold—?” Draco yelped, words snatched away by the squeeze of Apparition. Barely a second later, he landed on his knees on a soft, uneven surface.
Harry’s vision goes black. He has Malfoy pinned against the wall in half a blink of an eye. Malfoy opens his mouth to gasp, but Harry is on him before his sluggish human senses have caught up, and the sound is swallowed by Harry’s mouth before it can begin. Blood drips from Malfoy’s tongue, pools underneath it, and Harry forces Malfoy’s head back and laps it up, draws Malfoy’s tongue into his own mouth and sucks. It’s only a scratch, the flow of blood already slowing, but each drop shoots through Harry like hot, pure magic. Harry growls, sucks until the trickle is more of a torture than a tease. He tears himself away.
Malfoy’s grip was painful. Harry focused on it as he pounded into him. Malfoy sounded almost close to tears as he gasped, “You’re gonna – right there, don’t stop – I’m gonna – fuck! Fuck!
Potter called at the Manor the morning after one of Draco’s excursions. When he saw him, Draco froze, sure he’d been caught, sure he was going to Azkaban for the rest of his life – but Potter just wanted to give Draco’s wand back. He held it out, awkward and casual, like it was a Sickle Draco had dropped in the street.
Harry glanced at him. His cheeks had faded from blotchy red to a sore-looking pink. The colour suited him better than the grey that had washed him out when he’d stood, pathetic, on Harry’s doorstep.
“We go back a long way,” Harry said. He resisted the urge to check his watch again. “Are you sure there are no rooms available? No last-minute cancellations?”
“Scuttleby keep you for long last night?” Malfoy’s smirk belied the innocent tone of his question. “That man can talk. You fell asleep during his speech at the ball last November, you know.”
The flash of a rebounding spell, the graceful arc of a wand blasted from a spider-like hand, the heavy thud of an inhuman body on a stone floor. Flashes and flashes of cameras – thousands of them, over years and years and years. Voices yelling, beseeching, demanding, sneering. A fixed smile. A bedroom floor littered with Dreamless Sleep bottles. Ceremonies, balls, speeches. Himself, screaming into his pillow, clutching at his hair as another request to recount the War came clutched in the talons of a stern-faced owl. The cold, certain thought:
“Well, you might be hearing from him anyway.” A spark of vicious pleasure lit up in Harry as he recalled his blistering words the night before. “There’s a chance that I mentioned your work in the field of Mind Magic. Something about how well-respected you are and how the Mixed-blood Being Outreach program could do worse than have someone like you as a patron.” He smirked. “Oh, and he might be sending you a personal owl of apology for being a dick to you, as well. Keep an eye out for that.”
If my mouth weren’t full, I’d be gaping. My cock may literally be up his arse, but his words feel bizarrely explicit—like something out of one of Dean’s smutty videos, or something you’d say as a joke. But he doesn’t seem to be joking; he grinds himself downwards and lets out a breathy moan. I can’t stop myself from thrusting up into his tight heat.
“I told you, we’re booked up,” Tom was saying stubbornly, his voice raised so the other patrons could hear. “No rooms available.”
This time, the wand obeys him, and the black ribbon loosens and unwinds itself. The motion of it is somehow sensual – a twitch of interest cuts through Draco’s nerves. The rest of the box opens, folding outwards until it lies flat, spread out against the bedsheets. A scroll levitates above the deconstructed packaging. Draco picks it out of the air.
Harry made a non-committal noise. He poured his tea. It wasn’t properly brewed yet, but he didn’t want to linger.
yeah.” He grabs the headboard and thrusts his arse back onto my cock, matching my rhythm. “Fuck me, fuck me, oh
This time, as the first, Harry was not whooshed away anywhere, not transported to any halcyon memory of school Quidditch games or study sessions of years gone by. The breeze from Malfoy’s open window passed over him – and then Harry remembered: Malfoy’s window wasn’t open. He’d looked at it several times over the last hour, noticing that it had been repaired, that the sun had moved. The window had been closed all morning.
After two weeks, it felt like Malfoy had lived every moment that Harry himself had done. It was strange, having someone know you so thoroughly yet knowing almost nothing about them in turn. Harry had never been particularly enthusiastic about his memory loss, but the knowledge that his past self knew things about Malfoy that Harry was achingly curious about made his resentment burn anew.
The pounding stuttered, the rhythm faltering like a skipped heartbeat. There was an unpleasant lurching in Harry’s chest. “What are you talking about?”
“Well, yes – that and the brand of a murderous fascist burned into my forearm. I was expecting that to be a significant deterrent.”
“We’ll stand guard,” the younger one said, winking. “You look so good together, by the way!” The sound of their fresh giggles was quickly muffled by the great wooden doors.
Malfoy visibly pulled himself together, his rigid posture softening into fluid motion. “No, no, not at all.” He gathered together the sheets of parchment he’d been reading and gestured – almost lazily – to the stiff wingback chair in front of his desk. “I was just reviewing some notes on your case.”
Malfoy did this a lot when they were working with the doors – doubting Harry, making him check. Each time, Harry would look around at the other three doors and affirm he had the correct one. Each time, he’d been right. He wished Malfoy would stop asking.
“Fuck,” Harry said softly. “Okay. Another Mind Healer question. Why does this feel so different to before? To when we were at the restaurant, I mean.”
As memory-Harry watched, transfixed, memory-Draco bent down to say goodbye. Agatha nodded seriously, her eyes wide. Even from across the room, Draco could tell she was on the verge of crying. Gratifyingly, his past self also noticed; he pulled a face at her, crossing his eyes and sticking out his tongue. Agatha giggled reluctantly.
“Yeah,” Draco said, apparently only half-listening. The casual disregard of Harry’s words was so perfectly
“If the noise changes, especially if it gets too loud, stop immediately, okay?” Malfoy said. “You remember the safeword.”
“When was the last time you did something spontaneous? The last time you didn’t tie yourself in knots considering every outcome before you did something?”
did it,” Draco pointed out, unable to keep the bitterness from his voice. “For weeks, you hid things without me noticing. It took me
The presence in Harry’s head vanished; the images stopped. His ears rang in the sudden silence of Malfoy’s office.
I gape as Malfoy drags a spluttering Harry to the large fireplace at the back of the pub. I’d assumed this was the sort of thing we’d head into together, but I suppose I can’t blame Malfoy if he wants to talk to Harry privately first—Merlin knows this was sprung on him. It was certainly sprung on me.
Malfoy stood. “Brisley won’t come in here, I don’t know why,” he said, frowning. “You’d be better off waiting outside.”
Harry rubbed the spot where Hermione’s blow had landed. Truthfully, it had barely hurt—he’d had worse Stinging Hexes from second years, especially over the last few months—but he needed something to do with his hands. Something to distract him from the uneasiness growing in the pit of his stomach.
“I rather thought there’d be more angst-ridden foreplay,” he said, audibly trying for his usual careless tone but falling a fair distance short, “but I’m happy to jump straight in if you’re really in the mood–”
“About demanding to see your memories and calling you a Death Eater and storming out,” Harry clarified.
I swallow. Harry withdraws his fingers and Draco’s arse closes around me. Then Harry appears behind Draco’s shoulder, peppering kisses over Draco’s neck.
Draco swore. He couldn’t believe this was happening. The smell of Harry surrounded him—the familiar sweet scent of him, the dusky spice of the cologne that Draco had noticed in the restaurant, and, most excitingly, the nascent tang of his sweat. The heat of him burned all the way along Draco’s right side and his hand stroked Draco’s dick with steady, sure movements. It was incredibly difficult to resist the urge to arch into it and let himself fall apart completely.
“You only forgot two things this time, you silly shit. Mitsy is cleaning your cloak, I’ll send it over later, but your coin purse is on the dining table. I took three Galleons as a service fee.”
“Yeah,” he says, still chuckling. “Yeah, there’s not—” He breaks off to laugh again, and I grin despite myself. God, it’s so nice, hearing him laugh. There have been years where he’s barely cracked a smile. I’d put up with much worse than Malfoy for this, honestly.
“Hm.” Malfoy kept reminding Harry that he could use the Pensieve whenever he liked, and Harry had always refused. After Malfoy had seen the memories of Ron’s insults – many, many times – there really was nothing Harry could possibly want to hide from him. “What’s the point of this one?”
Harry’s dick was so hard he was sure he was one touch away from the edge. Malfoy’s eyes were dark molten silver, his lips full, pink and parted.
“Not unless what you’re looking for is a headache and an urge to inflict a thesaurus-based injury on the author.”
Harry fruitlessly tried to straighten the petals of the white flower that was pinned to his chest. “Don’t worry. A sad flower is the least of anyone’s worries today.”
Harry counts five breaths before he relaxes. Draco’s hand is still again, resting just below Harry’s navel. If Harry lifts his hips a little… If he nudges Draco’s arm downwards… The flare of magic against his dick would feel
“Your magic, Harry,” she said. A quiver in her voice betrayed her. “The Healers ran checks on you after they fixed you up to make sure nothing was amiss. Your magic is a quarter of what it should be.”
“Just wanted to look something up,” Hermione said, her attempt at airiness hampered by her laboured breathing.
Hermione and Malfoy picked up the thread of their conversation again, but the mood had shifted. This time, Harry’s eyes were uneasily fixed on Ron, who sat with his back ramrod straight, his mouth a firm, furious line. His knuckles were white around his tankard of mead.
And if one pushed aside his crushing guilt, which Harry did, things were going surprisingly well. Work was better than it had ever been. His case rate, already one of the highest in the department, doubled. His head felt clear, connections and solutions appearing to him easily. Where once he would have locked himself in his study with mountains of paperwork to identify perpetrators, now he only had to read through files once to have a very good idea of what needed to be done, and a very good idea of how to do it. It felt like the last few years had been an upward battle and finally –
“You think I’ve been going to the pub five times a week since February and two drinks all afternoon could have knocked me senseless?” Harry nodded to Malfoy’s wine glass. “And you’ve barely touched yours. You never do.”
Draco’s hum of acknowledgement dissolves into a soft snore. Harry smiles, rests his cheek against the top of Draco’s head, and allows his eyes to drift closed.
“Don’t worry,” Malfoy said. “This will take some getting used to. Take your time. Does anything feel strange? Different to what you’d expect a library to feel like?”
“No,” Harry says honestly, and Draco rolls his eyes and walks to the window. He reaches up—the raised hem of his top reveals a flash of smooth skin and the dip of his spine—and opens it a crack, leaving the curtains slightly parted.
Malfoy winced. “Yes.” Hair fell into his eyes. He didn’t brush it away. “It could also mean that your mind is settling into its new state,” he said softly. “It may have stopped fighting to regain your memories and is beginning to look forwards rather than back.”
Harry’s thoughts must have shown on his face, because Malfoy’s eyebrows drew together, and he said, carefully, “You may have noticed that you were wearing Auror robes in some of the – the thoughts I shared with you on Saturday.”
He knew what it was. He hadn’t known that Malfoy had one. Suddenly, Ron’s mistrust of Malfoy made a lot more sense.
It took a second, but Harry snorted. “Prick,” he said. He scrubbed at the back of his neck. “I’m serious, though—obviously you know how I feel, but tell me if you don’t want…”
Draco did another one of those awkward half-shrugs, straining against the ribbons. “I don’t know. More … fierce.”
again. It felt like magic itself, being the sole recipient of Harry Potter’s attention. Draco shivered.
“I meant it,” he says urgently, his gaze locked on me. “What I said about that night. I did want to. I still—”
“We could come now, take the edge off,” Potter suggests, his voice low. He moves his hand up and down, once, slowly. A bead of pre-come grows at the tip of Draco’s cock, adds a torturous slipperiness between them. “Then we could spend the rest of the afternoon doing things properly. Everyone else has gone home, and Terry and Anthony are at Hogsmeade, they won’t be back ’till six. I dunno about you, but I’m definitely not gonna last that long.”
The Daydream Charm incantation is barely out of his mouth when someone pounds on the door. He quashes his instinctive panic – it’s the fantasy. If it were real, the privacy spells he cast would have muted the knock.
“I know.” Malfoy tilted his chin up, defiant. The usual effect was ruined not only by the smudges under his eyes, but the spots of colour on his cheeks, the heaving of his chest, his wet lips curling into a slow smirk. “You do it.”
Godric would see all things stolen from his young mate returned, no matter how long ago they were taken. Harry deserved to have the life works of his family safe in his hands. Godric couldn’t bring back the young man’s family, but he could at least do this.
The contract had stated that Dumbledore would have control of all of Harry’s vaults and Proxy seats. And that he would only be allowed to have one child and he would have to be absolutely faithful to Ginny, whereas she was free to do as she pleased. Out of everything that was what pissed Harry off the most. He dreamed of having a large family and whenever he imagined a spouse it had always been someone who was his friend first. A true friend would never betray someone in that way. Lastly, it stated that a slavery binding would be placed on Harry so that he would be required to obey Dumbledore’s, Molly’s and Ginny’s orders, in that order of importance.
Harry swallowed, throat tight in his embarrassment but he couldn’t just leave, the toilet had attacked him and he still needed to clean himself. This was terrifying but it would be infinitely worse to speak about this with one of the adults. So he mustered all his Gryffindor courage and asked, voice barely above a whisper. “The toilet attacked me,” Harry felt like an idiot for saying such a thing but he didn’t know how else to describe what had just happened.
Harry blushed again and walked out of the toilet room, going to stand in front of the sink. Every step he took shooting small sparks up his spine his tail wagging behind him like a dog who had just heard the word ‘
His wolf whined, rattling his bones with its longing. Sirius however, would be a different matter. He had confessed to Remus that one of the only things keeping him sane in Azkaban was the thought of one day being set free and raising Harry. Of family game nights and teaching Harry to ride a motorcycle. Just being there for when Harry needed them, whether it be homework or girl/boy problems. Sirius just wanted to be there.
Harry still couldn’t believe his Papa would have risked his own life, but he understood his reasoning even if he didn’t like the risk he took. Remus then spoke up, obviously trying to distract Harry from further worry.
It wasn't until he undressed for the night that he realized what it was that had been setting him off. His cloak fell from his shoulders, the pale skin underneath rising with goosebumps at the slide of silk over skin.
That was when the Claremores finally stepped forward, Lyle stealing Harry back, mumbling under his breath about how Harry was his, and the rest just greeted Neville and his Gran. Harry continued to stare at Neville from over Lyle’s shoulder giving a small wave and smile.
Harry saw how focused Neville was on the garden so he asked his friend if he wanted to go out for a walk. Neville was quick to agree and they were soon outside, Neville touching flower petals and leaves gently. Harry walked beside him, one hand holding the other boy’s and just let the flow of words about plants surround him along with the fragrant smell of blooming flowers and fresh cut grass.
Next to arrive was the Malfoys, something that shocked Harry, because he couldn’t believe his parents would have left them something in their Will. Bartok had promised that the only people allowed into the reading were mentioned in the Will, but his Papa hadn’t mentioned the Malfoys would be here. Harry was distracted from those thoughts by the small wave Lucius Malfoy gave Bartok. He looked at his Papa in confusion as he waved back. He was wary now, he knew his Papa wouldn’t do anything to hurt him so he would have to tell Bartok about all the things Lucius had done to make sure his Papa didn’t get hurt by him.
“Well, as the letter says the sender would like to wait to meet, and I am inclined to respect their wishes in this.” Harry nodded, understanding where David was coming from in that. “As for the Elder Wand, it is indeed a Peverell family heirloom. Legend says it was gifted to Antioch Peverell by Lord Death when he and his two younger brothers built a bridge over rocky waters with magic, thus outsmarting death. That, however, is merely a children’s bedtime tale, which I can read to you sometime if you like, and anyone who knows the Peverell family history knows this to be incorrect.”
Neville watched impatiently as his Gran settled her hat on her head. He would have tried to rush the women along if he didn’t have a healthy fear of her. Once they exited the floo they had to wait for a Goblin to lead them to the meeting room. Neville’s hands shook more violently with each step they took, soon he would see his friend again. And maybe… he would have the confidence to tell Harry just how he felt.
David would have to consult Anna and Issy since they were more likely to know someone they could go to.
“Oi Remy, knock it off, you’re scaring the pup,” Sirius called out in exasperation. With one last hit Remus moved away from the wall, going to slump down on the floor next to Sirius and Harry. Harry looked at him warily, still worried about the man holding him. But Remus just sat there looking utterly humiliated and Harry, now that his head was a little clearer, couldn’t imagine this man hurting anyone.
“Siri, stop!” Harry giggled, trying to push the big, furry mass off of him. Finally, Sirius pulled back, transforming as he did, his large hands cradling Harry’s head tenderly as he stared down at the young boy.
Harry looked down at his plate, not sure he wanted to be the one to talk but wanting Sirius and Remus to know the truth. Bartok looked at him searchingly and Harry nodded slowly and grabbed Remus’ hand within his. Sirius sensing the mood and scooted closer to Harry wrapping an arm around his shoulder for support.
At the explanation Molly relaxed but was quick to reignite her fury, quickly whipping herself back into a rage. “Albus! I’ve got a letter from Gringotts saying that they are taking our money! Ginny and Ron also got one. They are charging us with theft Albus!
Severus nodded, keeping his eyes trained on her as he opened the door to his chambers. Minerva marched her way in, calling an unknown pair of House-Elves to start packing Severus’ belongings. Minerva instructed the two Elves to allow Severus to pack his own potion lab.
Harry pouted slightly but decided to go onto his next question, “Can we go down to the vaults and retrieve my parent’s Portraits?” Bartok agreed quickly, and they were soon off, Helix leading them down to the vault. It was much lower than his trust vault or the one where the Philosopher’s Stone had originally been.
On the day before the meeting, Harry was sitting bundled up in a pile of blankets in the Floo Room with a good book. Harry didn’t realize it, but Tiptop kept sneakily refilling his drink and plate of small nibbles, and because of the distraction of a good book, he didn’t even notice how much he ate.
“When the wand entered the room, the box it was in began bucking in Anna’s hold, and all of your attention was on it. At your touch hundreds of animals, not quite Patroni but something similar, burst from the wand and began stampeding around the room. Then they all rushed you and absorbed back into the wand. After that in absorbed into your skin and left what appears to be a tattoo, so you can see why we were frightened. No record of the wand has ever even hinted at such a thing, and that is why I believe you now have its full loyalty.” David took a large bite of his bloody filet mignon. “And that is what we know about the Elder Wand, admittedly it isn’t something I have studied in depth as I never thought it would be relevant to me. So I will now be doing more to make sure you have all the facts.”
“As soon as I received the letters from the bank about the charges, I was surprised and took actions to find out the truth. What we learned was shocking, to say the least.” All the others looked sour at the reminder of what they had discovered.
Severus' hands were shaking as he slowly ran his fingertips up the top of his thighs, stomach fluttering when he hit a sensitive spot right above a sharp hip bone. He quickly removed his hands, gripping onto the sides of his long boney feet, letting his thumb circle the thin skin over his metatarsals. Touch so soft it was almost ticklish.
Harry had no clue where his Daddy might be, all the adults were running around the house, making sure everything was finished before the move. He could be anywhere in the manor or even at the new home, but luckily, Harry knew just who to call, “Tiptop?” The House-Elf popped up before him, waiting for him to ask his question. “Could you tell Lyle that his brother Siles is here to see him?” Tiptop nodded, ears flapping against her face and popped away again.
And then Harry remembered, they had discussed it in detail yesterday what the return of his sight would be like. But red hadn’t been part of the expectations. Harry sat bolt upright, head swiveling around as he took in his surroundings. It took several seconds of constant blinking before the blur of sleep lifted. And then he realized.
That was until the door to the office opened at least. They all looked over to see who was coming in, everyone holding their breath. But when Harry saw who it was, he was up in a flash.
He hissed at the statue, stone mouth grinding open and tongue lolling out to allow Godric to walk up its length. The moment he passed through the door leading to the sitting room, there was a loud pop, the enchanted sleep spell being broken. The room was musty with stale air, but the furniture was still pristine and dust free. A roaring fire bursting into the fireplace as he passed by, Godric could picture the days they had all spent down here, gossiping and dreaming of a better future.
Remus walked up behind him, hand coming to rest on Harry’s shoulder and steps loud enough that Harry wasn’t surprised when he spoke up. “I got that for your Father soon after he discovered his form. He didn’t know what it was from but thought it was hilarious regardless. Next time we could I had him and Sirius round to my house to watch it. We didn’t stop calling him Bambi for months.” Remus chuckled softly.
Lyle spoke up, anxious to change the topic. “Remus, you probably don’t know but, David here is currently working on a research project to cure infected werewolves.”
Albus finally got Molly off of him and sent her on her way. Lucky for both of them, squibs could still floo.
I hope you like this chapter, if it's a little weird I am sorry, had writers block to power through.
Harry couldn’t help jumping in surprise at the feeling, but now that he knew what it was and was expecting it he tried to not think about what was happening to his lower half. He started naming rose species in his head to help him calm when a sudden violent shiver wracked his body. The sensations of the water hitting his bottom mystified him with how good it felt. It was strange and unlike anything he had ever felt before and suddenly it was over, only to be replaced with warm air blowing at him that felt like was tickling him. But instead of laughing a strange noise came from him. It was soft and Harry almost didn’t believe it came from him but there was no one else and he doubted it was the toilet. When the toilet was done doing whatever it did, Harry sheepishly stood and raised his silk bottom, noticing the way the front bulged slightly.
In response, all his parents looked back at him in confusion. David took up the lead, “Yes Harry, that golden light that surrounded you and Mr. Longbottom was a bond forming.”
But first, he had to get dressed and find a new wand until he could get Minerva to retrieve his own. Luckily, he kept his Chief Warlock robes in his offices at the Ministry, and he was the only one who had a floo connection to his office, so he didn’t have to worry about anyone seeing him in this state. After Dumbledore arrived in the Ministry he was quick to change into the plum robes, next Albus flooed Molly, he had long had her hold onto one of his back up wands. The meeting was in half an hour so he didn’t have the time to figure out what was wrong with the wards or answer the many questions Minerva would have.
“James, please take care of Harry, but also don’t forget to take care of yourself. And if you find yourself ever falling in love again, know that all I want for you is to be happy, however, that happens. I have left a letter and journals for both you and Harry in the main vault. Just remember to not let Harry get into too much trouble, and don’t give him that damned cloak while he is still in school!” She giggled at the last bit, and Harry could imagine the picture in his album of her spinning around, obviously laughing and wild red hair flowing in the breeze. “For everyone else, to retrieve the gifts from me visit James for the Vault keys, I must admit it is a bit of a trick to make sure he isn’t alone. However, if James has joined me, the Goblins will distribute the keys after reading his Will. Everything else I have to say to you will be in letters in your vaults.
Once he sent off the owl and cleaned up he joined all his family, needing the comfort from this excessively stressful day.
Percival would be staying at the Claremore household until Dumbledore was in custody. And would be working from home and shadowing Harry if he was to leave the house. Though there wouldn’t be much of that.
At this Anna relax, telling all her mates of the oath the man made earlier that day. The wand’s odd behavior could also be due to the mystery of its creation. Anna had to administer a calming draught to Issy to get her steady enough to listen. She blushed from her head to her toes in embarrassment once she remembered the oath. With it, there was no way Godric could have handed them the box knowing it was for Harry without being killed right then.
Last was the Gaunt ring, something Harry was very confused by. “I don’t know anyone by the name of Gaunt?” He looked over at his Papa who didn’t seem the least bit confused.
Issy was the most anxious, Anna having to administer a calming draught to stop her from hyperventilating but she was still playing with the fidget cube Lyle had tossed her. David was pretending to read, but he hadn’t turned a page in thirty minutes. Out of all of them, Lyle was the most straightforward in his worry, eyes never straying from the young boy in the bed they all cared about so much. Bartok and Anna were discussing in hushed tones plans for the trials to come.
“Hello, Harry, my name is Siles. I am looking for my older brother Lyle, do you know where I might find him this evening?” Siles smiled softly, eyes slightly far away as if remembering something.
There was a loud thump of Harry’s tail, which was now wagging out of control, and hitting against the wooden wardrobe. Harry swallowed thickly and made a mad dash for the restroom, his heart beating against his ribcage like a jackhammer. He pressed his back against the door, nervous and bewildered with his body’s reaction. Harry took a few deep breaths, steadying himself and his wobbly knees before walking over to the sink. The moles that liberally peppered his olive skin were clear in the mirror above the sink. His hair had grown out so his curls no longer were so short they looked like fluff atop his head but were now clearly defined ringlets. When wet, his hair was now down to his chin but as the curls dried the length shrunk up to about mid nose. Harry splashed cool water onto his face, a curl moving out of place and into his upper ears, causing it to flick in agitation.
So Sirius would do what he could to get them all ready to meet. He would have to let Lily and James know everything that was going on so they wouldn’t bombard Harry with questions and reassure Harry that nothing would go wrong.
“I know we haven’t had the chance to talk about the events going on much.” They both sat down, Bartok pouring them each a finger of his finest whiskey. “Besides talking about all of it with you, I wanted to ask if you would be willing to play bodyguard in a few days?”
Bartok loved these quiet moments where he could just study his family’s faces. Even Anna, from where she sat going over the medical scan she had taken of Harry when she first woke, looked peaceful.
Harry’s mind went straight to Hedwig, and he knew that was who he would be sharing this potion with. Especially since according to David she was his familiar and would be able to speak to him after they visited a Magizoologist. He would have to speak it over with Hedwig once they were able.
The other one then spoke up, just as upset by the conversation, but voice much more steady than his brother’s had been. “We knew that they wanted Ginny to marry Harry but we had no intention of ever letting that happen. Ginny was obsessed and her behavior made Harry uncomfortable.”
They returned to their position on the couch, all their bodies stiff from the prolonged position. They sat back into the soft cushions of the couch, stretching their muscles to loosen them up.
The adults were talking about what plans they had for the day. When Augusta started talking about Neville’s parents both boys stopped playing and listened to what the Dowager had to say. “I believe we should move Frank and Alice. With all that has been revealed about Albus, I don’t feel comfortable leaving them where he could try to use them against us.”
Harry woke with a sneeze, face full of fur that tickled his skin, followed by a rough tongue going from jaw to temple. He pushed the mass of fur away, whining as he did though he couldn’t hide the small giggle. “Gross, Dad!” Vicariously wiping his face off on his sleep shirt.
Godric and Salazar stayed with Bartok, David, and Augusta in the sitting room, taking the now vacated sofa. “I assume you both came here to do more than tell us about Lord Black’s previously unknown condition?” Augusta asked, curiosity not completely stamped out by her protective streak.
Other than Helix, the room was empty. The Goblin was sitting at a desk, chairs spread out around the room in front of him. He greeted them without looking up from the paperwork he was busy shuffling through.
“Of course, Harry,” Lyle whispered into his fox ears, nuzzling his quickly before pulling back, features soft.
Godric wasn't sure how Salazar would take the idea of sharing Godric with more people. He had already had problems with the idea of Godric having another mate, and that was the only reason Godric had yet to tell him about Harry. But he couldn't put it off any longer.
I am sorry this took so long, first I needed to wait for the poll and then I just ended up second guessing myself a lot.
While shocked, Percival was relieved. “I have only seen that man a handful of times and talked to him even less. We have no relationship, and I never cared for him or his beliefs.” Bartok looked relieved as well to hear this. He had obviously been worried about what Percival would do.
The light that emitted from them was blinding but Harry couldn’t look away, the gold flickering across Neville’s face, turning his eyes to warm honey. Neville stared right back, their foreheads pressed together as if they were trying to become one.
Sirius had almost forgotten they were in a room full of people and then he remembered, these people were now Harry’s parents. “I will be giving my Godson the talk,” Sirius growled out at Bartok who was staring at him with those piercing dark eyes. Sirius didn’t care what these people said, he and James had jokingly planned out how they would give any children they had the talk. Of course, he wouldn’t be sticking by those plans since they were made when they were both drunk as skunks on cheap Firewhisky. But still this is what James would have wanted, and Sirius knew just the way to do it.
The screamed that ripped its way through his body was soul deep, the birds nesting in nearby trees fleeing in alarm. Albus dropped to his knees, mind furiously going through all possible circumstances that would cause this, but he came up with nothing. There was no way this could have happened, but somehow it had.
Neville seemed to shrink between the two much taller men, slouching down in his seat and keeping his eyes locked on the empty plate in front of him. Harry wasn’t sure why Neville was so worried but he reached out with his bare foot and tapped at Neville’s. His friend looked up sharply at Harry where they sat across from each other, a small smile gracing his face as he rubbed his much larger feet over Harry’s. They ate their food like that, feet fighting each other for who got to be on top, toes running over ankles and calves in a playful dance.
But unfortunately, Lyle noticed it as well, “Anna is taking excellent care of him, and his health has improved greatly.”
“Now that we are all here, we should begin our discussion. First, how we will get Lord Black’s name cleared.” Sirius groaned at the title but Augusta was quick to shoot him a look that had him quieting down.
During his time as a slave, Severus had spent his time first building a secret chamber within his mind, his Occlumency of such a caliber that he was able to hide away his true mind behind titanium doors, leaving only a shadow of himself for Dumbledore to see.
“Hello there, what’s your name?” The man’s soft voice floated through the air like a feather. And Harry couldn’t help as his ears laid back flat, his tail thumped wildly within his cocoon of blankets. The man took another few steps forward, his sharp leather shoes clicking against the marble floor.
Arthur slumped in his seat, absolutely shell shocked. “You’re not the woman I married, your not the woman I fell in love with,” Arthur whispered, not even meaning to utter it.
Neville questioned one of the nurses standing by about their facilities and treatments, and he was relieved to find out that they made sure to take out their patients to visit the gardens at least once a day and had daily activities for everyone so that their minds had something to do.  Neville wasn’t sure what his parents would be able to do but he still thought even just getting them out of their room would be good for them.
The House-Elf didn’t even bother replying, popping away loudly and returning soon with the two heavy bags, thrusting them into Anna’s arms and pushing the woman towards Godric. They were quickly all flamed to the Gryffindor estate’s hospital wing. Both Anna and Issy rushed to start scanning everyone, questioning Godric as they do, and roping him in to help too.
Percival got unpacked, Bartok perched on the desk chair as they talked about how the case was progressing. They had strategically planned to release the information of the theft before anything else, so the public could have a chance to take the new information in, though they didn't want to wait so long that Dumbledore had a chance to regain his reputation.
He almost wished one use was enough to cause it, but he doubted the man would allow it to stick for long. Godric pushed his hair back down, it flared up again as he left the room.
His wolf had once again howled in distress, as it had through most of the year when he saw Harry. That was the moment he decided to embrace those instincts. So when Remus’ wolf had almost taken control to rip open the Headmaster’s throat, Remus hadn’t trusted the man when Dumbledore told them about the abduction. Remus had held Sirius’ hand within his in a death grip under the table, tapping out one of their old secret codes that meant ‘wait’. It had taken two repetitions before Sirius remembered what it was. It was Sirius himself that proposed a secret code after he snuck out one Christmas break to see a Muggle spy movie. It turned out to be invaluable while they were pulling off pranks.
Harry opened it just as gently as the others, paper coming away whole, revealing a beautiful hand-knitted green sweater. It was the softest thing Harry had ever felt, and he was putting it on as fast as he could.
“Why haven’t you brought this to me yet? You know I would help in any way I could.” Unlike most would be Percival wasn’t offended, just curious.
Molly just scoffed, “You married my disgusting brothers. Good riddance to the filthy faggots.” Molly’s arms were crossed fingernails digging into her forearms.
It was grossly ostentatious, and Godric giggled in glee when he finished it, imagining the look on his old friend's face. But now, with their beloved Boudicca lying dead on the onyx floor he couldn’t see it as anything other than childish and unnecessary.
But what he found wasn’t what he expected. In the middle of a bedroom, spread out across the carpeted floor was Sirius and Remus. Remus was pinning Sirius’ much smaller frame under him, hands pinning his Godfather’s wrists against the floor. Sirius was shirtless, numerous bruises covering his body but what shocked Harry most was the animalist growl rumbling from Remus’ chest.
“I also am going to call in a good friend of mine, who is an Auror, to be there just in case anything goes wrong. Though we will all be there to protect you, so there is no need to worry.” Bartok took another sip of his coffee, a firm hand now on his son’s shoulder as a show of support.
Anna grabbed his hand from across the table, her skin smooth and warm. “Harry, we didn’t get you presents because we had to, but because we wanted to. You are our son, and we want to spoil you.”
Sirius’s voice had lost the rasp it held when Harry had last seen him, and it spoke of him going through the healing process. While this news would have been wonderful, the words his Godfather spoke only made his stomach drop, and by the look on Remus’ face, he felt the same.
Harry just stood there, unsure of what to do and how to feel. Ever since he had been rescued by the Claremores, he had been constantly overwhelmed by their generosity and care. At this point, he shouldn’t be surprised but he can’t help it. Harry wiped his eyes where tears were starting to form and instead pulled both of his Mums into a hug, whispering thanks as he did. They just assured him there is no need for thanks but Harry wanted them to never doubt how grateful he was for all they did for him. Harry never wanted them to think he took all they did for granted.
The two on the bed were enveloped in a golden glow, sparks of pure magic spitting from their forms. A song so hopeful burst from them, its joy causing them all to cry as they watched the glow grow until they were blinded from its light.
Harry sat in shock, Professor Snape had only acted horribly towards him because of Dumbledore. It was too much to consider. He hated the Professor and to now find out that hatred was misplaced Harry didn’t know what to do about it.
Godric stepped from around Sal, trying to mimic his mate's gentle tones, “We have actually met before, though you won’t recognize this form. You would know me better as Fawkes,” Godric spat out the name, obviously disgusted.
So that's what he did, thumb sliding from slit to frenulum. And he was gone, falling back onto the bed, back arching and cumming so hard that thick ropes of semen shooting so far as to land on his chin, cum pooling in the hollow of his throat, and moan strangled.
It was Harry’s scrunched up nose and jaw popping yawn that let Bartok know it was finally time for the day to start. They had a lot to get done before the Will reading at two and before then they had to give Harry a quick tour of their new home.
Severus was stunned. And confused. And full of fury. For these past fifteen years, Severus had believed Lily had passed away hating him. He had wallowed in his misery, allowing it to drown him slowly.
Godric had rushed over and hugged the other man, needing to reassure them both that nothing would ever tear them apart.
, to ease his fury. None of the men across from him looked anything but approving of his protective urges. With how closely the Weasleys had been linked to Dumbledore, Bartok had expected them to be disgusted by the reveal of him being a creature. But they weren’t and this was another point in their favor.
The door of the vault was large and circular, the Potter crest in intricate detail. Harry grabbed his Papa’s hand, unwilling to go in alone. He reached out with his right hand, and as soon as he touched the giant metal door, it rolled open, revealing what was inside. Harry could only make it one step into the vault before he was stock still. The cavern was filled with books, furniture, piles of money, and jewels. Harry didn’t know where to look and was soon feeling overloaded, mind shutting down in the face everything in front of him. Hundreds of years of family history was in front of him, something he had always yearned for, and here it was.
While the movie was action-packed and exciting, Harry was already nodding off. He really did want to see the outcome, but he was just too tired. A pop jolted him awake, Tiptop standing in front of the now empty coffee table.
“Yes, there is that brother dear.” The second rolled his eyes and Bartok wished he could tell them apart. “But we had no clue there was anything else going on. When we found out we were ready to kill them…” They both blushed but the steely look in their eyes said that they would still do it in a heartbeat.
Charlie had always worried about the two. While they were family, and he loved them dearly, their close bond set them apart in some ways. And no matter how they hid it there had always been a loneliness to them. Charlie had honestly been a bit jealous to see how easily this young boy made his little brothers light up. Both because he wished he could have been that person for Fred and George and because he wanted a love that easy and innocent.
They headed back into the Headmaster’s office, to say goodbye to everyone. Both Rowena and Helga were standing there with their hands on their hips, eyes sharp as diamonds. “And where are you two going?”
Bartok had decided not to tell Harry about the meeting later with the Weasley family. Helix had owled him just last night to inform him the Weasleys were trying to get in contact with Harry.  So after their meeting and Harry was home safely, he would head back to the bank alone. Bartok wanted to ensure that if the meeting went wrong, it wouldn’t hit his son as hard and that they meant him no harm.
Minerva didn’t comment on him packing away what would normally be considered school property, just helping him once she finished off the other rooms.
David swept him up, face a little tight but smiling through it. Harry held his tail all the way to the dining room, head swiveling back and forth as he took everything in. Portraits waving and cooing at them as they passed, Harry smiled back at all of their friendly faces, saying good morning to all of them. David assured him that they would spend a day getting to know all of their ancestors one day soon.
I meet Harry’s gaze and open my mouth. It feels stupid—I haven’t, in fact, sucked even a single dick before, so I have very little idea what I’m doing—but Harry lets out a soft
“Yeah.” It was easier now he’d got the worst out of the way. “You said earlier that if I were approaching the time limit, I’d see some changes. Is that the sort of thing you meant? Is it a bad sign?”
Harry’s mouth opens against Malfoy’s throat. He’s so close to giving in, to letting himself have this. “You taste like sex,” he groans, his lips dragging torturously over hot skin, “like music and Firewhisky and fucking. God, I’m obsessed with you. I wanna devour you–”
Harry scraped his limited memory for anything he’d want to keep private. He’d been signed off Auror duty immediately after the Healers had realised he hadn’t just been on the wrong end of a stray
He held Harry’s gaze as he pressed his finger in deeper. “Focus on the feeling of me,” he said in a low voice.
Besides, he’d likely be spending the rest of his life doing ostentatious things to appease Draco Malfoy. So, at quarter past eleven, Harry squared his shoulders, tucked Malfoy’s note into the pocket of his stupid fancy robes, and strode determinedly to Highbury & Islington tube station.
Malfoy’s teeth grazed the underside of Harry’s cock and Harry hissed, his hips thrusting upwards, his grip on Malfoy’s hair tightening.
It wasn’t that he was a workaholic. It wasn’t that he missed the excitement, or the early mornings, or the Auror Headquarters tea that was somehow weak and tasteless no matter how long you brewed it.
like Draco’s Harry—seductive robes notwithstanding—but he held himself differently to the person Draco had grown to know over the last few months. His shoulders were tenser, his back straighter. His gaze flicked up from the menu every time the bell above the door chimed, and his jaw clenched whenever someone walked too close to the table—an echo of it threw shadows onto the stubble just below his cheekbones.
“Suck my cock.” The words left Harry’s mouth without his permission, but he didn’t regret them – especially with the way they made Malfoy’s eyes darken and his dick jump again before he scrambled to his knees.
The cool air on my skin as Harry undoes the buttons of my shirt does nothing to calm me—in fact, it’s the opposite; each unfastened button charges the air around us. It feels like one of Dad’s experiments with electricity—like the moment before something explodes, when your hair stands on end and you know that something big is about to happen and there’s nothing you can do to stop it.
Harry scrambled to his feet. He couldn’t tell from Malfoy’s tone whether he was about to be kissed or kicked out. Then Malfoy hurled three Auror-grade locking spells at the door and stalked around the desk towards Harry. Harry’s breath caught.
“What?” Harry was gazing up at him, his eyes so green against the flush of his face. “What do you want, Harry?”
“Yes,” Harry said immediately, running his hand over Draco’s front, fighting desperately to keep his hips
“No!” Hermione said. “I mean – Well, yes, he did. But we were fourteen! It would be a huge breach of patient confidentiality if he did it now. Honestly, the scandal of him doing such a thing would overshadow anything he could tell them about Harry.”
Harry’s climax slammed into him so hard that he nearly passed out. He could vaguely hear a long, low groan and assumed he was the one making it, but had no power to stop it. His entire body was pulsing, shaking, forcing himself as deep as possible into Malfoy, all hot, white, overwhelming pleasure.
“Yeah?” Harry scraped Draco’s hair back with both hands and kissed him deeply, drinking in his quick breaths, the sharp nips of his teeth.
Harry’s relief buoyed him through the thrill of Draco’s hand over his as they cut the cake, through flashes of camera bulbs and more applause. His face was just starting to ache from his fixed smile when his reprieve came in the form of The No-Maj Matrix, four witches who were, they yelled at the crowd, from Salem, Massachusetts and were ready to party.
“Wonderful idea, Granger,” Malfoy said in that same loud voice. “Don’t you think, Potter? Wouldn’t it be romantic?”
“Don’t you know, Ron?” he says, and my name still sounds exhilaratingly alien in his mouth. “I’m a demanding little shit.”
Harry didn’t know whether it was ruder to stare or to look away, but it was a moot point anyway; he couldn’t stop his eyes from trailing up and down Draco’s body: the fall of his hair across his bare shoulders, the criss-cross of ribbons restraining his arms, the softness of his bare feet, toes digging nervously into the bedspread.
He felt … nothing. Not encouraged, nor disheartened, nor intrigued – the man looking back at him was just … some bloke. He had a shadow of stubble on his chin. His eyebrows were thick and straight and his eyes were green behind the round-rimmed glasses. None of this ignited a single spark of familiarity.
Malfoy rested his forehead against Harry’s. “Merlin,” he breathed. “I really hope you never regret that.”
I turn back to Malfoy and let my gaze linger. There is undeniably something of the hungry-undead-wet-rodent about him, but he’s not
Potter’s expression was hungry. “You in my head again? Fuck. Yeah.” He nodded—short, sharp jerks of his head. “Yeah, fuck, I want that. Please.”
“Don’t worry,” Malfoy said, his voice soft in Harry’s mind, but the image in front of them shifted again – the Leaky Cauldron.
“I’m trying not to let my prior experiences with you affect our interactions,” Malfoy said eventually. “It’s unprofessional. I keep slipping up.”
There was no universe in which Harry could have defied him. He did it again, and again, and again, and Draco took it beautifully, tied up and neck bared and entirely at Harry’s mercy. His cock leaked onto the charcoal ribbon around his stomach, leaving streaks of darkness on the silk.
Harry held his breath. He remembered the scathing look Draco had given him when he’d suggested Molly help organise the wedding. He imagined Draco’s thin mouth curling into an insult, a sneer of
Ron hadn’t done any research (“No point, she’d want to go through it to make sure I got it right anyway.”), but had been a steady, calm presence, perfectly balancing Hermione’s intensity. With him, Harry could forget that he’d forgotten anything – they’d played chess (Harry remembered the rules but was fairly terrible – Ron had cheerfully told him that was normal), had gone to Quidditch matches and had spent several late nights laughing and joking, empty bottles piling up on Harry’s kitchen table.
“I mean that I’m literally on my knees begging you to take me. In any way you’ll have me. For however long you’ll have me. It’s rather pathetic, really, but I’m trying not to think about it too hard.”
Malfoy wrapped his arms around himself. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said. “I thought we were – what’s happened?”
“Yes, please do,” Ron said sarcastically. Malfoy sighed, but sat next to Harry without comment. He sniffed, and his eyes fell to the half-drunk cup of Earl Grey tea that sat next to Harry’s plate. His head snapped up to stare at Harry, his expression unreadable. Harry flushed and looked away.
Malfoy looked up at him. “Potter?” he said softly. Harry realised his thumb was rubbing soft circles on the inside of Malfoy’s arm and pulled away.
By the time Harry has opened a path to my stomach, my hand on his back has clenched into a fist. Our slow kiss has hardened; the movement of our mouths has become jerkier; small, strained noises pass back and forth between us.
Malfoy surged upwards, his legs spasming and his feet scraping across the bed for purchase while he let out a stream of curses. His cock was warm and velvety in Harry’s mouth, bigger than he’d anticipated it being, and it tasted like sex. Harry’s mouth watered, and he sucked and swallowed to stop saliva dripping out of his mouth and down Malfoy’s shaft.
A desperate whine crawled out of Draco’s throat. He was drowning in feeling, inside and out. Harry’s hand on him was driving him closer and closer to the edge—and his words were provoking a similar build-up somewhere in his chest, behind his lungs, up his throat. Did Draco want to come, or did he want to cry? It felt like either could happen at any minute. He was at Harry’s mercy. He always had been.
A few days into his Legilimency sessions, Harry was consistently able to identify the feeling of Malfoy in his head. It was still peculiar – a cool, fragrant, too-intimate pressure in his mind – but the presence itself wasn’t unpleasant. He couldn’t help but mentally poke at it, and felt a flicker of reproval in response.
“Then go and do that right now.” Harry shivered at the authority in his tone. Malfoy’s eyes flashed. “Now, Potter!”
She dragged him to St Mungo’s (he remembered St Mungo’s; he didn’t remember ever having been there before, though many of the Healers greeted him like an old friend). Minutes after they arrived, the red-haired man from the photographs appeared, demanding to know what Harry had got himself into this time. Harry shrugged. Hermione explained.
Following the Healers’ instructions not to Apparate—and deciding he’d rather not wrestle his trunk through his too-small fireplace—Harry took the Knight Bus. Stan Shunpike cheerfully dropped him off at the Entrance Gates, and Harry waved to him as the bus drove away, privately thinking that he’d rather Splinch himself again than sit through another stomach-churning journey with Stan cheerfully chattering about everything he’d done while under the Imperius Curse during the war.
An hour later, Harry began to doubt himself. A team of Healers and Mind Healers hovered around him nervously. A web of spells was draped over him, monitoring everything from his heartbeat to his hair growth. Ron and Hermione were perched on two uncomfortable-looking chairs next to the bed where Harry was propped up. Malfoy still wasn’t there.
Harry glanced at the towering two-way mirror that made up the right wall of the interrogation room. The weight of unseen observers hung heavy in the air. The weight of the shackles around his wrists was worse.
It was exactly as easy as Harry had anticipated, which is to say that by the end of the session, he felt like he had made no progress at all. He was also beginning to regret not taking Malfoy up on his offer of using the Pensieve; by 12 o’clock, Malfoy had been subjected to every colourful insult that Ron had directed towards him over the last fortnight.
The door opened to reveal an unfamiliar man – though that went without saying, these days – in neat grey robes. He was rather pointy, and almost colourless; pale skin, pale hair, pale eyes. He was also much younger than most of the Healers Harry had dealt with thus far. He couldn’t have been that much older than Harry himself.
Harry tried to engage his brain and think of what he liked when Ginny went down on him, but thinking of Ginny made his stomach twist unpleasantly, so he quickly pushed the attempts aside and allowed Malfoy’s noises to guide him.
“He wasn’t transformed at the time,” Malfoy said in a rush. “I don’t think he – I checked the Werewolf Register every week, the first few years after the War. But I know – I’ve heard – he still has the scars.”
He spun on his heel without waiting for an answer. He half-expected Potter to comment on his rudeness, but Potter stood serenely next to him—close enough that Draco caught an unfamiliar yet tantalising whiff of his cologne (something dusky, spicy)—while Draco spoke with the head waiter, and followed Draco to the table without complaint.
A strange expression flashed over Malfoy’s face before it was replaced by one of polite professional interest. “Oh?”
“Ask Malfoy what?” Ron stomped in from the garden, his boots trailing mud over the worn wooden floor. Harry couldn’t tell whether his ears were red from anger or from too much sun.
“I was second, until sixth year,” Draco corrected automatically. “But that was just Snape—he always marked up Slytherin papers, and I was the only Slytherin with a brain. So that doesn’t count either.”
There were a hundred answers to that question, the first of which being that it hadn’t even occurred to him. But even if it had—it would have violated the professional/personal boundary that Draco (usually) insisted on maintaining. And there was the undeniable fact that a Legilimency connection was absurdly intimate—Draco doubted that any of his previous lovers would have wanted him in their heads. They wouldn’t have been able to repress any stray thoughts—
,” Potter groans. Draco’s name has never sounded so good. Draco looks up – Potter is gazing at him, open-mouthed, dark-eyed, gorgeous – and slides his lips down, down, down, until Potter’s dick nudges the back of his throat. He swallows, and, knowing the charm will let him, presses further, taking Potter into his throat until his nose is pressed against the dark curls of Potter’s public hair.
Malfoy smiled tightly. “Well, goodnight,” he said. He nodded to Scuttleby, locked eyes with Harry for an intense, confusing moment, then Disapparated.
At that, Hermione fell on him. She pressed her hand to his forehead, checked his pupils, took his pulse, and asked a rapid stream of questions that he did not know the answers to.
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed and his face shifted into a familiar annoyed expression. Harry was again amazed that it didn’t turn him off completely – in fact, quite the opposite. What was happening to him?
Harry’s anger burned white hot until lunchtime. After hours of raging, he stopped destroying the unused bedrooms of Grimmauld Place for long enough to tear into the sandwiches Kreacher balefully presented him with. In the sudden breathless silence, his anger cooled, solidified, and eventually settled into thick regret that sat heavy on his chest.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “I notice you’re sitting here alone, rather than accompanied by the unfortunate-haired power couple.”
Malfoy cleared his throat and laced his fingers together. “Anyway. As I was saying. Weasley is just telling the truth as he knows it. There’s no need to be angry with him.”
“Well, now I feel better about you dumping my sister.” Ron reached over and took a chip from Harry’s plate. “I’ve got four brothers, though, if you still want to marry into the family. I reckon at least two of ’em would consider it.”
He stopped about a foot in front of Draco and leant forwards. Draco froze, his breath catching, but Potter reached up over Draco’s shoulder and pulled out a jar of tea leaves.
“But I meant it. Just so you know. I do love you, I have for a while. But I don’t expect – It’s really okay. If you don’t, I mean. I really – I don’t actually think–”
Healer Brisley – it took Harry a moment to recognise her – scurried in with a beaming smile. She cooed over him, asked him a list of questions, and had a stream of other Healers (but not
Part of Harry wanted nothing more than an excuse to spend more time with Malfoy. The other, larger part of Harry knew it was a very bad idea.
“I hope you’ll feel more positively towards the field as we progress,” Malfoy said, and Harry belatedly remembered that Malfoy could read his thoughts.
that Draco immediately sobers. How often has he heard Potter’s particular brand of stubborn compassion directed at other people? How often has he quietly, shamefully longed for it to be directed at him, too?
“Oh, please!” Hermione slammed down her spoon. “He was perfectly professional in the meeting this morning and we have no reason to suspect he will be otherwise going forwards,” she said firmly. “He has some fairly impressive qualifications. I looked him up after the meeting. He’s done good work since Hogwarts.”
The situation at work was as complicated as Harry had feared, and he spent the morning untangling the messy threads of cover stories that the culprits attempted to weave. Going back and forth between them occupied most of Harry’s attention. But as the day went on and Harry had unpicked their lies enough that he was confident of a conviction, he found himself thinking more and more about Malfoy’s letters.
Malfoy made a small, desperate noise. “Fuck – don’t–” A bite on Harry’s earlobe. “Merlin, I bet you could tear right through – You’re so –
Malfoy shrank away from him. “I really don’t know what you’re talking about!” He fumbled for the letter and scanned the first few lines. “What is this? I don’t understa…” The colour drained from his face. He looked up, eyes wide. “No,” he said hoarsely.
Hermione narrowed her eyes at him. “Well, it hardly matters. But your gardenia is all squished. Don’t worry, here, I brought a spare. And—Harry, you’ve got dust all down your side. How
Harry lunged across the table to drag Malfoy into the searing kiss that hung between them, but Malfoy slid out of the booth and through his fingers like smoke. The
“Yes,” he said stiffly. “I happened to live with a rather powerful Legilimens for a while, ten years ago.”
Malfoy’s face flickered. “That something happened to make you feel such a way. If you’ve met someone you find attractive, for example. Or if you have found yourself in an intimate situation for the first time.”
“After that,” Harry says. “About…” He trails off, sounding embarrassed. Good. It’s about time I’m not the only one stewing in my own shame.
“‘Quaffle’ if you want to stop,” he reminds me. I’ve barely nodded again before the head of his dick is pressing against me—pressing against Draco’s rim—forcing its way inside.
“You can’t get out of a marriage contract.” Malfoy’s voice was still quiet. “And even if you could, if my mother… She would have made sure.” He sighed, then locked eyes with Harry. “So. When are we doing this?”
Malfoy pursed his lips. “Let’s try this, then: I’ll cast, and you block me with a standard Shield Charm. Keep eye contact with me while you do. My spell should rebound and let you into my mind, then you’ll be able to get a greater sense of my mental presence. Are you comfortable with that?”
Suddenly, Draco hates it. He hates Potter and his gorgeous, swollen, mouth-watering dick. He hates this whole charm for showing him what he can never have.
“Again,” Potter growls, but Draco is already moving, dragging desperate fingernails down Potter’s back and fucking him properly, gracelessly, instinctively chasing the heat, the tightness, Potter’s noises. Potter is clenching fistfuls of bedding and Draco feels it, feels the squeeze of it in his chest, around his heart, so he looks away, raking his eyes down the pink lines that show the echo of Draco’s nails on Potter’s back, traces them to where Draco’s fingers are digging into Potter’s hips.
“Make sure to keep the sound and the image of the door at the forefront of your mind,” Malfoy ordered, then ended the spell. The pounding echoed in Harry’s ears. He closed his eyes to check he could still picture the fifth door. It was still there, as large and imposing as ever.
“I would offer to… Find you some toilet paper, but I doubt there is any in the manor… All I can do is suggest you… Well, try to relax.” Neville shrugged, blush still going strong.
Harry had always felt like a caged animal who couldn’t show any sign of weakness or risk being killed. But ever since the Claremores took him in he had felt free, even bed bound as he was for most of it.
David was waiting on the couch, book in hand. “Ready to get dressed Harry?” Harry nodded and followed his Dad over to the large wardrobe. This was the first time he had clothes of his own to choose from. His fingertips ran over all the fabric, attracted to the softer shirts. The one he pulled out was a deep purple sweater, and the pair of jeans he retrieved were just as lovely. David turned to give him some privacy, but Harry was suddenly caught up by the sight of his tail.
Bartok spoke up, understanding why his son was so confused after they first went to the bank together, he contacted Lord Gaunt, an old acquaintance, through Lucius, of his to ask why he made Harry his heir.
Harry opened the box, the letter not being on the outside. He had only lifted it about a fourth of the way when he knew who the sender was. In the box was a planter filled with brilliant lilies, the flowers a stark white on the edges and deep plum in the middle. They were beautiful, and Harry couldn’t help but smile as he opened the letter from Neville.
Lyle grimaced slightly, his brother had been away at a business management workshop for the past month, and Lyle hadn’t thought to send him a letter about their changing circumstances. “Well, we will be moving to the Garden Hill manor in Terradore due to the happenings of the past three weeks. I am sorry I forgot to get in touch with you about it but it has been very hectic, and a lot has changed.”
Fred and George, who were now eighteen and able to use their wands outside of school had messaged them all with their
Harry looked at them again, he could remember seeing something like this on one of Dudley’s spy movies when he had been cleaning the living room. Harry placed the set down gently, caressing the buttery leather once more before looking at what else was in the box. There was a notebook also in Fred and George’s hand with instructions on how to use the set along with a set of locks to practice on. It was wonderful. He hated knowing someone knew about the locks on his door or on Hedwig’s cage, but they had done this so he could have the chance to save himself, and that meant the world to him.
Another owl came swooping through the window, dropping another letter atop his head. The parchment slid down into his lap. He opened it up hollowly, brain short-circuited.
“And this is your sitting room, that door-” Issy pointed towards another set of double doors, “Leads to your study. There is a small library within, you and your mates will have to fill it up. But there is plenty of room for all of you.” She then led them over to another set of doors, turning to him and smiling like the Cheshire Cat. Opening the doors slowly as she said, “And this, this is your bedroom!”
They all sat, Neville, looking over to his Gran whose mouth was in a tight line. Doctors had never given them any positive news when it came to his parents, but Healer Lorraine looked comfortable and at ease.
A sudden chuckle burst its way through Neville’s chest, the boy looking just as surprised as Harry at the outburst. Harry was about to draw into himself, believing his friend was making fun of him but Neville coughed loudly and spoke up. “Ah, I know what that is, and it can be startling if you don’t know what it is.”
As if on cue, both women walked through the doorway, both looking haggard. It must have been some hell of an emergency, David thought. Issy ran over to were Harry was seated, lifting the boy up and spinning him within her arms. But Harry didn’t even notice her, his eyes were locked onto the box Anna had under her bicep.
Harry wondered what Siles could be looking for when the man answered Harry noticed Siles looking at him out of the corner of his eye. “Yes, recently in fact,” Siles drawled.
“I, Arthur Septimus Weasley, do hereby removed Molly Muriel Prewett, Ginevra Molly Dumbledore and Ron Billus Dumbledore from any right you have the Weasley vaults, and properties. I strip you from any connection you had to the Weasley family.” All three were dragged violently through the wards, screaming the whole way.
Bartok held in his growl and finally popped away. When he got home, he put his briefcase away and went downstairs to join his family in the dining room. He greeted everyone as he sat down, as soon as he did, Tiptop popped in with lasagne for dinner.
The large room with its marble floors and tiled walls caused every slap and squelch to echo, driving him further towards the edge. It was easy to close his eyes and picture those smooth hairless thighs spread out around him, open and inviting. Wondered what Harry’s member would look like when it was filled with blood and need. Which way it would lean and if it would grow darker the longer he was aroused. Wanted to know each and every inch of skin and its taste. Needed to know the noises Harry would make with every touch. Which places would make him groan, which would make him moan, and what would make him feel so good it left him speechless.
“I had Issy call Healer Lilian Lorraine while we came here to ask her for permission to portkey two patients into their lobby. She just replied to me via
It was then Lyle made a query that caught Harry’s attention, waggling his eyebrows as he did. “So have you found who you were looking for yet?”
He could feel as his body slowly regained its human form, the feeling of having skin shocking him. Everything sensitive. He wiggled his toes and fingers the strangeness of feeling textures against his finger pads intoxicating. The blanket his mate was clutching was unbelievably soft, and he wanted to weep for missing such things for so long.
Sirius kept up his steady stream of comforting words, Remus rubbing Harry’s back in soothing circles. Harry finally seemed to level out enough so that they could speak with him, “Harry, darling, I think you have misunderstood what Neville meant when he gave you the Longbottom charm.”
Bartok kept his voice steady, not wanting Harry’s anger to get worse but also not wanting to lie to his son about the situation. “Dumbledore is the largest proponent of anti-creature laws. He hides it well behind his grandfatherly demeanor but whenever a new law to restrict the rights of creatures comes in front of the Wizengamot it is his supporters that vote for it. Most people don’t realize it because as Chief Warlock, he doesn’t openly vote; his proxy, on the other hand, always votes against creatures. However, since you have come into our lives and made me proxy, I have been looking into why your seats have been active. As I suspected when I found this out Dumbledore was holding the Potter and Peverell seats. Luckily, it seems he was unaware of the Le Fay and Ravenclaw seats. If he were, his side would have had a majority in the Wizengamot, if only by a few votes. This, of course, led me to search for the records of Dumbledore’s voting since I have never before heard of him voting. This is how I found out that Lord Diggle has been casting at least ten families votes, there could be more, which is worrying. These houses include: Black, Diggle, Dumbledore, Hufflepuff, Lupin, Peverell, Potter, Prewett, Tuttle, and Weasley. I believe there to be more because I doubt he would have left all his seats in the hands of one proxy. So you can see there is something very wrong with this picture. Especially considering it is believed the Weasley’s lost their family seat decades ago and the Hufflepuff and Tuttle lines supposedly went extinct over four hundred years ago.”
And suddenly there was all-encompassing wet heat, long fingers digging into his hips leaving what would form into finger-shaped bruises. Blue eyes rolling back and toes curling. An orgasm ripped its way through Godric. The only thing that was visible being the dark hair curtaining Salazar’s face,  plush lips stretched wide over his cock, and green eyes being covered by fluttering black lashes.
Harry wondered however if Neville grew Muggle species of plants within his garden and if he could maybe send one of the rose bushes to his friend. He would have to ask his parents if it was okay because he knew just how expensive they were. However, Harry suspected they would agree because Harry could see at least twenty of the bushes and could imagine them surrounding the rest of the manor.
Godric swallowed thickly, memories of that same tone coming from Helga after a battle haunting him. He was quick to nod in agreement and start talking again to try and distract her. “Yes, ma’am.” Godric coughed, the reply reflexive. “I came here because while retrieving the stolen Potter artifacts, we came across a dungeon full of prisoners in one of the Dumbledore residences.”
Remus was shocked when he heard a word almost silently growling in the back of his mind, repeating over and over.
Lyle grinned, every inch of him radiating excitement. “Well, son, one of my best friends, is a Technomage and he has been working towards blending Muggle technology and magic. This is his first product, he has the workings sorted out but is now looking for the backing to make it go worlds wide. He allowed me to purchase a prototype for you. I hope you like it!”
“I am so sorry Boudicca, I only hope one day you can forgive me,” Godric whispered, forehead pressed against the tip of her snout. He wished he could have saved her, but the dark magic Dumbledore used on her corrupted her beyond belief. Godric had also heard the old man say he had feed many of his enemies to her. Even if they could fix her mind, Godric knew once she remembered what happened she would soon try to kill herself and there was nothing they could do to heal her from that.
"Sorry Augusta, you were already asleep when it happened, and we didn't think it was worth waking you." Anna blushed a little at Augusta's hard look, her features clearly saying that they should have woke her.
His mind screeched. His fists in tight balls and his feet now hooked around Harry’s calves. “Who?” Neville hissed, needed to know who to go after.
Fudge served himself a cup of tea and took a plateful of the cookies Tiptop had made just for Harry, she hadn’t even let the other clan members have any. Harry couldn’t imagine what Tiptop would do to the man as retribution, but he was sure it would be swift and humiliating.
He scrambled for his wand, the wood feeling dead underneath his touch. Despite the dread of knowing he was now a squib he still tried. Casting a levitation spell on the bank statement only for absolutely nothing to happen.
Harry turned to look over at Sirius were he was still perched on the settee, wicked smile on his face at the memory. “He acted like he hated it but we all knew he was too pleased with his form to be truly upset.”
Salazar looked over, mouth wide open in shock, “Godric, you know spirit cleansings only work on sentient beings.” He sounded as if he thought Godric was an absolute idiot, but Godric knew something the other man didn’t.
Harry was surprised how short the new contract was but then it was straight to the point and Harry couldn’t imagine what else would be needed. Harry then realized something, “Why would Mrs. Weasley’s last name in this be Prewett?”
The innocuous black box started to vibrate, bucking harder and harder as Anna tightened her grip on it. It wasn’t until Harry reached a hand out, over ten feet away from where Anna was wrestling with the box, that is jumped out of Anna’s grip and flew towards Harry.
When they heard Molly start to wake his sons went rigid and pulled apart, keeping a five-inch distance from each other. Arthur’s heart broke a little at the sight, for his children to not feel at ease in their own home. Arthur wished more than anything he could change things, but he couldn’t, the best he could do was protect them and let them know how much they were loved and cared for, and to do everything he could to make their dreams a reality.
Bartok looked over the list from his place next to Harry, noticing Helix didn’t speak up; he did. “They were all returned by the same G.G. who gave you back your family wand on your birthday.” Harry looked up at him, but before he could speak, Bartok continued, “I am sorry, but I still want to respect the wishes of G.G. to stay anonymous for now. He has said that he wants to meet you and make your acquaintance, he wants to give you the time to settle down into your new life.”
Then came the removal of the years of bindings and unnecessary or detrimental wards that needed to be removed. Those were much easier to deal with since they were the ones to construct the original ward scheme and were also much older than Dumbledore so knew all of the wards and spells he had used. Once they lifted the final binding, a booming voice rattled through the room.
