So, it was 10 PM on the 18th of December and Harry and Andromeda were making peanut butter fudge. He was buttering the pan and gathering the second set of ingredients while Andromeda was quickly stirring the nearly-boiled first set.
“Hey, why don’t you come on back and we can go ahead and start?” she cheerfully asked, “How was your week?”
marginalized group says nothing of your social awareness concerning others. So I didn’t really think that hard about things. Then Voldemort came back. I thought that I could finally choose a side once the Minister alerted the public, but that didn’t happen…”
Andromeda had opened her mouth to inform Narcissa of her son’s whereabouts, but Harry beat her, “He goes to the same uni as me,” he burst out. “Er...the University of Manchester.”
“So, you think that because he’s not pure-blooded, he can’t be bilingual?” Harry asked, his voice shaky. He didn’t know why he was so angry— he just was.
“Oh, right! So, we can include some candy— put in some floss for Hermione— , a coupon for half-off drinks at the Three Broomsticks— well, not for Narcissa as she’s technically in exile— , and a small trinket. I was thinking that we could do one Maltesers pack, one Cadbury chocolate, one Kinder egg, one licorice wand, one cauldron cake, and one fizzing whizbee.”
Dousselsnorf snorted hard to clear collected mucus out of his throat. “Would you like for me to fill out an official report, or shall I just give you a cookie for doing the bare minimum?” He replied sarcastically.
“Holy fuck,” Malfoy said. “Fine, if you really want to know, I want nothing to do with my mother and father.”
Their conversation continued for another twenty minutes until Andromeda announced that it was time to open presents. They all gathered in the living room. Harry noticed that Draco was dressed in a light blue shirt that complimented his eyes.
Harry couldn't stand ignoring the press. He would barely even look at them or reply or even acknowledge them, but they still did not let up. It was exhausting.
Harry ate at McDonald’s that night for dinner and then apparated home at 8. When he got home, he began his homework and studies. He finished his take-home Intro to Psych test, read his assigned book for English and looked at its associated essay rubric, finished his essay for Earth Science, and looked at the Algebra PowerPoints. He decided that he would need Malfoy’s help. Seriously, who understands polynomial division?

The Weasleys were the hardest and that was because they were truly his family. After an hour, he bought some baby stuff from Carter’s for Bill and Fleur. They had announced a week before that they were expecting. He got George and Angelina a box of Dove chocolate. For Charlie, Harry purchased some movies about dragons. Finally, he got a small china set for Percy.    Yet, when Harry stepped out of Diagon Alley after buying every one’s wizarding presents, he felt like he’d forgotten something.
It was an hour before party time. Harry did some last minute touches on the napkins and presents. He couldn't help but feel restless and he was sure that it had something to do with the thought of having everyone over.
Harry clutched the letter and reread the first two sentences of the latter paragraph. He felt giddy.
Harry didn’t think that he could stomach anything this morning, so he skipped breakfast. His heart had yet to completely regulate its beats and to get out of the fight-or-flight mentality. He felt like such an idiot having to skip breakfast because he had a little nightmare. His therapist told him repeatedly that nightmares were common with PTSD, but Harry still wasn’t completely sure. He showered and dressed, attempting to excite himself that today was Tuesday, a practical day. Although he normally enjoyed the spell battles and physical activities, he didn’t know how he could handle it. He still felt like an idiot. This is just a bad day, he reminded himself. Harry grabbed a cereal bar from the pantry and swallowed his anxiety.
They spent approximately two and a half hours shopping for Teddy, then they decided to go for lunch.
"Keep taking it. Keep up the regular sleep schedule. And cut back on the coffee, mister. It'll stain your teeth, anyways," She smiled at him.
“Um, free nachos? Fuck yeah!” Longbottom exclaimed. He clapped Potter on the back in a friendly motion. Potter grinned in response. Draco felt his stomach flitter. He wanted to punch something. He wanted to do a shot. Instead, he started making their drinks.
Harry checked his items out and left the store. After that, he apparated to Hogsmeade. Before taking off his cloak, Harry prepared himself for the soon-to-come surge of wizarding press. He took off his cloak, folded it and put it into his bag, and stepped into the sunlight. He walked for a total of two minutes, amazingly enough, without anyone noticing him until one man glanced up and spotted Harry’s glasses and scar.
He rubbed his face. It was extremely cold due to his broom ride. He poured himself a glass of water and drank it all down. He poured another glass and another one. His mouth was not any closer to not being dry, and he wasn’t any closer to not being high. How was he supposed to go to training today? He couldn’t show up like this!
“So, that is how you complete the square. Take the coefficient for the ‘x’ term, cut it in half, and square it,” Malfoy informed Harry. In twenty minutes, Malfoy had managed to sum up over four hours of Algebra.
“Now, I have the trinkets all picked out. The list is as follows, so write this down: a silver owl pendant for Cissy, a book on the goblin rebellions for Draco, the Dummy’s book for computers for Arthur, a bronze charm bracelet for Molly, dragon-skin gloves for Ron, The God Particle for Hermione, a one month subscription card to ESPN for Ginny, Robert Reich’s biography for Fleur, Les Dragons en France for Bill, a full-set muggle magic kit for George, Pride and Prejudice for Angelina, The Invisible Hand for Percy, and a lovely denim jacket for Charlie.”
Harry’s eyes darted down to what Malfoy was wearing. It was similar to what he wore the night at the bar: skinny jeans, a black t-shirt, a black jacket, and converses. He never thought he’d see Malfoy wearing muggle clothes. Malfoy suddenly glanced over, obviously aware of Harry’s staring. Harry looked down in shame. He felt a blush creeping on his face. He didn’t look up again until class ended. Malfoy stood up in a rush, collected his things, and nearly ran out the door. Harry continued sitting at his desk, still extremely confused.
They decided to attend to Draco’s shopping first because he had less people to shop for: Andromeda, Teddy, and Pansy. The car was parked in a Tiffany’s parking lot, but neither men moved.
“No, no, no!” Teddy jerked his hand from Andromeda’s and started his tantrum. Harry held his breath. The toddler couldn’t have known about what all happened here, could he? Maybe he could feel the energy or see the ghosts… “I wanna hold ‘Arry’s hand! ‘Arry! ‘Arry!” Harry exhaled.
“Well, I’ve given it a lot of thought and I have realized that I am biromantic and asexual,” he informed them.
spotless and threw tantrums whenever I got dirty. It got to the point to where my parents took me to a wizard psychiatrist when I was nine. He diagnosed me with OCD, but then my parents pulled me out of therapy because one, Malfoy's aren't mentally ill and, two, I was a kid.
Harry preferred this because these students were ten and eleven—slightly younger than first years at Hogwarts.
Harry wanted to laugh, but he knew that the boy was sincere. “Well, Davie,” he said. “Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is about one quintillion kilometers. All of London is only one thousand and five hundred kilometers. I think that it would be
Harry thought for a few seconds and then said, “I dunno. Sometimes I just get randomly obsessed about specific details. It’s a trait I’ve had for...years. Probably since before Hogwarts.”
Of course, he had slammed into someone and sent both of their belongings tumbling to the ground. They simultaneously bent down to pick everything up when they bumped heads.
Harry ordered two Sweet Alabama burgers, an Average Joe burger, and three Oreolicious milkshakes. He knew that Andromeda would not be happy with him buying a two-year-old fast food, but he was already prepared to offer to eat Teddy’s portion. Harry smiled as he stepped behind the restaurant and apparated back to his home.
The silent mourning was over and some people began to chat. Harry overheard Neville tell Seamus and Dean, "Yeah, McGonagall reckons that we'll need two professors for each subject, like Firenze and Trelawney did for Divination, because there are going to be so many first years. I guess people had tons of babies in '89."
“That sounds great.” Harry paused and watched Andromeda stir the caramel concoction. “Um...I-I need to ask you something.”
The doorbell rang at 4:45 and Harry opened the door. He was surprised: he expected Narcissa since she was always early. What he got instead was Draco with his hair gelled in a way that paralleled sixth year, a fancy, silky black button-down shirt, and a bouquet of flowers. Harry could smell his cologne from a foot away.
He walked to the Starbucks on the east side of campus and ordered a white chocolate mocha, Ginny’s favorite. “She’d be proud,” he thought bittersweetly.
Once in London, they automatically went to the park that they’d talked about. They sat on a bench, quietly enjoying each other’s presence.
He grabbed his coffee and walked outside to smoke a cigarette. It was a nasty habit that he’d picked up from Andromeda. Was it stupid? Yes, but sometimes stress makes a person do stupid things. They smoked outside in order to keep Teddy safe, of course. Stupid does not equate to selfish.
“Have you...never…shopped for anyone else before?” Harry asked, his voice reaching a higher octave by the last word.
[I told you! (incorrect grammar used to show Teddy’s linguistic progression)],” Teddy screamed. He was jumping on top of the floor and swinging his arms wildly. He only had one shoe on.
Malfoy ended up sitting next to Harry in World History, but they didn’t talk at all. Harry pretended to be listening to the lecture, but he was really just paying attention to Malfoy. He was doing a lot of that recently.
“Je crois que j’aie les mozzarella sticks, et toi? [I believe that I will have the mozzarella sticks, and you?]” Malfoy asked.
Malfoy exhaled, halted, and turned around. He waited for Harry to approach him, clearly not wanting to cause a scene.
floor and walked to the Probational Sub-department. He was sent straight to Dousselsnorf’s office. It took about five minutes for the officer to even show up, but Draco was fine with that. It was his last chance to snoop around the room looking for some clues about Dousselsnorf’s family. Once he found the pictures of the officer’s wife and three kids, he heard someone clear their throat behind him. It was Dousselsnorf.
Andromeda squealed in reply. She then asked, “Can you hand me the sticks and apples? The caramel is ready.”
“Well,” she said, “You have a lot of seniority. Most people don’t last around here. It’s Sally, Darren, then you. And you know about Darren.” She shot Draco a sly smile. Everyone despised Darren.
He groaned and replied, “Fine. Whatever. I’ll switch next time.” Sally smirked, and Draco stood on top of a bar stool behind the counter. He announced, “Everyone! Attention, everyone! We are officially closing tonight; everyone needs to have their bills paid and be out of here in fifteen minutes!” He got down from the stool and turned to Sally. In a hushed voice, he said, “Great. Now I’m everyone’s least favorite bartender.”
“Draco!” he exclaimed, “You’re early. I love that about you. Listen, it’s 3:15, and my kid has a doctor’s appointment at 4. You don’t mind taking over the bar and register for me, do you?”
It wasn't that Andromeda thought badly of muggle universities or education: it was just that she didn't understand
Harry was at a loss for words. He did not expect Malfoy to be gay. But, after all, he didn’t expect himself to be bi, nor Ginny to be bi, nor Luna to be pan. Well, he wasn’t surprised about Luna.
“Oh, me!” Harry said, suddenly. He felt an odd bit of excitement about going up to the counter. He’d forgotten why until he looked back at the counter, barely catching Malfoy’s eyes. He’d been staring at the group. “What’s everyone getting?”
His apartment wasn’t much, and he really didn’t need it to be. The University of Manchester required him to either live on-campus or near the school, but he still planned on spending as much time with Teddy and Andromeda as possible. He wasn’t quite ready to completely live alone yet. There were times that, with his mental illness, he doubted he’d ever be able to. He hated thinking about that.
“I think she’s trying to get back into muggle slang or whatever. I have no clue. You know how Hermione is at times,” Ron admitted.
Draco paused. He felt a deep fear in his heart. He swallowed his anxiety and put on a fake smile. “Whatever do you mean?” he replied.
"This!" Harry started to tickle Teddy and the toddler was guffawing. A few minutes later, Harry stopped and kissed Teddy on the head.
Harry did not, in fact, have any plans, so he hung out with Draco a little bit. They went to Diagon Alley—fully disguised under the invisibility cloak. For the most part, they people-watched. No one noticed them for a long time. Tat is to say, until one little boy spilled his entire cauldron of fizzing whizbees and Harry and Draco lost it. Their wild laughter concerned everyone in the street because no one could identify the source. By the time they apparatd away, they were wheezing.
“‘Arry!” the young child squealed and changed his skin color to match that of Harry. After deciding that his complexion was dark enough, Teddy morphed a tiny lightning bolt scar on the center of his forehead.
After Teddy was changed, they went downstairs to eat. Teddy ended up only eating a few bites of the hamburger and some reheated leftovers. He told Andromeda and Harry all about his recent dream: ice cream monsters taking over the neighborhood. He was somehow still excited when Andromeda brought out the milkshakes. Harry and Andromeda ate their respective milkshakes and shared Teddy’s after he had had a few bites. They played with Teddy for a few more hours before they all went to bed.
“Language,” Andromeda reprimanded him. She grabbed his arm, and together they apparated to Hogwarts.
Draco and Harry had made up since their spat during the November fifth dinner, and Harry had somehow convinced Draco to go Christmas shopping with him.
kids. He absolutely loathed them. They had no sense of boundaries, no sense of morality, and no sense of common decency. This, purposefully rubbing one’s filthy hand through another person’s hair, was just one example. Another one was the toddler’s never ending whining while the three adults talked. Or, Draco thought, while he and Andromeda Tonks talked and Potter stuttered out a comment or two.
His days were rather routine up until Thursday. After World History, Harry stuck around the school library in hopes of completing his research paper on sub-saharan african trade in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Why did he get such a difficult question when Malfoy was assigned the cultural and social factors of the Mongolian empire? Who knows. So, he stayed in the library until 8 PM. Finally, he left when he found only one book. He was lucky that most of the required sources could be from the Internet, at least.
Harry shrugged. "I've got a meeting with the headmistress to discuss my becoming a Defense Against the Dark Arts professor."
Draco rolled his eyes. He said, “I don’t know, Douss. Maybe I’m sick and tired of having to come to this bloody office once every week. Maybe I’m sick and tired of having my wand checked every week. Maybe I’m sick of having my home checked for dark magical contraband once a month. Maybe I’m tired of being painted as the villain!”
"Well, yes. Ambien is known to change how you sleep, and dreaming is just a part of that cycle. Most people experience what they describe as 'strange' or 'weird' dreams, though. They're not that problematic, but I'd still like for you to keep me updated on your dream sequences and such."
“I realize that our choices during Hogwarts may not fully impact how we interact with one another now, but I said some disgusting things.”
“Hello, I’m so excited to have you with us today,” she said, shaking his hand. “I’m just going to walk you through some of the protocol.”
“Ah, I knew it,” Dean replied. “No, actually. I meant the rumors about you dropping out of auror training and attending a muggle university.”
The invite list was rather long for a two-year-old’s birthday; Harry knew that, but it was only comprised of the people closest to Andromeda and Harry: the Weasleys, Hermione, Neville, Luna, Dean, and Seamus. He had to cook for a total of 16 people, so he wanted to begin preparing as soon as he could. He had already chosen a present for the toddler, a mini-quidditch broom much like the one that he had had before Voldemort—no, he told himself. He would not think about that right now just like he how he wouldn’t think about Lupin and Tonks lying on the floor after the Battle.
“Yeah, I’ll get him.” Harry stood up and started walking. He made his way up the stairs and into Teddy’s room. He went over to Teddy’s bed and crouched by it. For a second, he just simply observed the toddler and his steady breaths. Harry smiled to himself, unable to believe that someone this innocent and angelic could exist. He shook Teddy’s arm slightly.
Harry had spent only part of his time thinking about Malfoy. He couldn’t understand why he was in Manchester, instead of in Étretat with his mother Narcissa. He couldn’t understand why he wasn’t in London. He couldn’t understand why he was in the damn
The professor had just turned the overhead projector on when a blond boy ran into class and took the seat right next to Harry.
"Oh, well I've been looking for wrackspurts and also trying to learn a bit about Quidditch. Ginny's playing for the Harpies, you know."
He went back to the bathroom mirror to look at himself again. The robes he had on were relatively new and elegant,—a deep red velvet with some blacker undertones—but they were also wrinkly and had obviously been slept in. It wasn’t his fault. He’d been taken off the Ambien and that messed up his sleeping schedule. Harry grabbed his comb and wet it, attempting to get his hair to stay down. He strongly considered buying some of the Sleekeazy’s Hair Potion that Hermione used sometimes, but he didn’t see the use. Did anyone really care about his messy hair? He sighed and set the comb down.
Draco rolled his eyes. He continued, “Of course. I was so cut off from information about muggles during the war. I don’t know. I’ve just enjoyed learning about everything.”
He had begun auror training in September, a three-year process which consisted of charm classes, written exams, theoretical work, and an internship in the last part of the third year. He was going through this with Ron, Dean, and Seamus. They only had a few more months left of their first year; they were all thoroughly enjoying it.
[I'm scared!] I don't wanna! I don't wanna!" Teddy clung to Harry's clothes and started babbling out a mix of French and English words. Harry couldn't understand him, so he started to sing "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star."

Draco jumped at the loud noise from the counter behind him. He spun around quickly. Potter was standing behind the counter, laughing. He slammed his hands on the counter again and announced, “Everyone! Oi, everyone! Watch what I’m about to do.” He then turned back to Draco and asked, “Mate, can I have three shots?”
Andromeda handed Harry two slices of pizza and some breadsticks, got herself the same, and gave Teddy a fruit cup and milk.
Harry watched as his boyfriend played patty-cake with Teddy. Draco was not as strict with making the toddler bilingual, so he’d spoken in English the entire night. Harry supposed that it was good that Draco only moderately followed the Black family’s values.
Slowly, Draco pulled away from the kiss. He rested his forehead against Harry’s, an oddly romantic gesture, and said with a hoarse voice, “We should probably get inside. It’s freezing out here.”
The next few minutes went on and Harry told them all about his hobbies (well, reading and cooking) and Teddy and Andromeda.
He walked in, closed and locked the door, and checked the place out. It was completely unfurnished except for the bar stools in the kitchen. After observing the small place that he would call home, he converted the area in the living room connected to the bathroom by a door frame with a broken door into a chimney for the floo network. His parole required that he be connected to it.
“Pansy. Pansy Parkinson. She came out to one of her friends in a wizard pub and some journalist outed her to everyone—including her family. Didn’t you see it?”
“Oh, no. My, uh, roommate taught me. She’s Haitian, but she knows a few languages. My name’s Sally, by the way.” Draco offered his hand.
“It was too late, Potter! He had my parents! And my home! And all my options were gone! They were gone! They were gone!” Draco stopped when he realized that his face was wet. He was crying.
Yet, he couldn’t stay home, either. Andromeda was worried about him, and this wouldn’t help his case. He knew what he had to do. He went upstairs, took a shower, and got dressed. He made himself some eggs and coffee. He ate slowly and then went outside to smoke. He went back inside and grabbed his invisibility cloak so that he could apparate to Diagon Alley in peace. He just had to be sure to come back around 4.
Recess took place on the playground behind the school. Decked out with slides, monkey bars, swings, a teeter-totter, and a track, the entity kept the kids content.
Harry took a few melatonin in an attempt to replace his Ambien. He was going to have a long day tomorrow since he planned on apparating back to Andromeda’s and cooking dinner. He lay down on his new bed. It was still strange to him. He used to sleep in a cupboard. He used to sleep in Dudley’s extra room. He used in sleep at Hogwarts or Grimmauld Place or the Weasley’s or Andromeda’s. He’d stayed in so many homes, but after a while they were all taken away. He wondered if that was another symptom of his mental illnesses. He resolved to ask his therapist at his next appointment.
“After the war. Andromeda was smoking and I figured that it would relieve stress. Also, why did you start then? Cigarettes are muggle things, right?”
Harry thought on his way back from auror training. He took the floo from the Auror Department to Gringott’s and exchanged some of his galleons for a few pound sterlings. After that, he apparated to Muggle Manchester. On his way to one of the Archie’s Burgers, he passed by the University of Manchester and its tall brick buildings. He stared at them, noting how they loomed over the city in a strange, omniscient way. He stopped staring.
.” Harry groaned and put his head down on the desk. He felt like he was never going to catch up. After his embarrassing melt down during the obstacle course, Harry missed class every time he felt slightly anxious.  As a result, even if he
.          It had only been an hour or two when the yawning began. Teddy claimed, repeatedly and aggressively, that he wasn’t tired. He was firmly anti-napping; there was just too much to see and explore! Soon after they returned to Harry’s flat, Teddy fell asleep on the sofa.
of September, and Harry had just finished up his classes for that day. He’d promised to give Andromeda a tour of the university that afternoon. Harry was going to take the floo to their house, then they would all apparate to Harry’s together, as Teddy had some sort of vendetta against using the floo.
The Great Hall had suffered the bulk of the destruction and despair, and that was obvious when one looked at the final renovations. When Harry last came for a conference, the Great Hall was only halfway done. The walls had just been finished, but were unpainted. The tables were a temporary, cheap wood. There were no chandeliers, only sconces. The big window had been replaced with a cheap, semi-transparent glass. So much had changed. The walls were painted with their traditional tan, but now they were also covered in art and murals. Each person who died in the fight against the Death Eaters was given their own mini-painting. There were ten long tables for the students, as opposed to the traditional four grand tables. This was an evident move for house unity. The professors had one grand table at the front, the throne-like chair still sat for the headmaster. Seasonal wreathes were positioned under each of the sconces—resembling modern looking lamps magically lit by fire. There was an elegant glass chandelier over every table. The big window was now a mosaic with Hogwarts’s logo, each house’s representative animal, and
It was 10 AM before Harry had stopped sulking. He could not believe that someone had been so low as to where they would actually eavesdrop on such a personal conversation. More important, he couldn’t believe that it wasn’t Rita Skeeter.
Draco opened his mouth and then closed it. Andromeda looked at him and Harry thought that they were somehow silently communicating. Draco seemed hesitant.
“The Boy Who Lived: a chain-smoking, tree-hugging, Death Eater comforter?” Malfoy replied in a slightly amused, slightly confused tone.
“Yes, it is. I don’t understand how people complain about American capital punishment when we have Dementors as prison guards.”
“No, it’s not,” Draco stated. “They had no business forcibly outing you. Nor sticking labels on you without your permission. Your sexuality is your business and your business only.”
"Nope. She takes care of Teddy Lupin. Tonks- her daughter- and Ted- her husband- and Remus- her son-in-law and our third year DADA teacher- all died. Teddy is her grandson and my godson."
He fetched the bottle of water out of the mini-fridge under the counter. He went over the order again in his head, causing him to remember the stupid nachos deal. He took a deep breath and went to inform Longbottom and Potter. Suddenly, Draco froze. Would he talk to Longbottom, someone whom he never interacted with except to bully? Well, unless you consider the events of the Battle of Hogwarts, which Draco didn’t. He’d tried his best to shut it out. God damn, he really needed a drink. He looked back at Potter, who was too drunk to tell his left hand from his right.
“Well, maybe that’s just the way the Force works. Luke held Darth Vader off in a lightsaber fight even though he wasn’t as well trained. Besides, sometimes that’s just what happens. Heroes get lucky.”
“The past is the past. People get hurt. They die. They end up messed up beyond belief. But I took this job so that I could help people heal and change. You are still a person, and all of this applies to you. Do you know that, Draco?”
“Um, a movie and dinner I can’t cook, so it’s dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets, Ramen noodles, or delivery pizza.”
“Parce que! [Because!]” replied Andromeda, tickling Teddy. She turned her attention to Harry, “So, how was school today? See anyone you know?”
.          Harry journeyed to his SALC class after a surprisingly good night of sleep. He arrived a bit early and was even seated before Malfoy walked in.
He arrived at the theater with ten minutes to spare. He worried about the tickets selling out, but found that Draco was already holding two tickets, a large popcorn, and two drinks in his hands.
Draco swore out loud when he realized that it was Potter. “Really, a whole god damn university, and he
“Well, no. I just, um,…” Harry paused, trying to think of something. “I was too busy studying for exams, y’know. I was pulling an all-nighter, and I decided that I’d take a nap. Then I woke up at 6, and I realized that I should probably just go to school tomorrow. To training, I mean. Not school. It’s…it’s not school.”
The Malfoys’ visit came and went fairly quickly. It was awkward at first because it was Draco and Narcissa’s first moment interacting for hours at a time in almost a year. It was also awkward because Harry had made a conscious effort to call them Draco and Narcissa, instead of Malfoy and Mrs. Malfoy. And then it was also awkward because Draco had no idea how to interact with a child— let alone a part-werewolf, metamorphmagus child. However, everyone made sure to act in such a way that would facilitate comfortable feelings for everyone else. After four hours of communication on Sunday, none of them felt like strangers anymore.
Ron’s face went as red as the gem, and Hermione grinned. They all left the room to go chat and Harry opened the door to let the rest of the Weasleys in.
Draco had no clue what the hell he was going to do. His regular dealer was gone for the week, so he had bought his coke off someone else. He should’ve known that it was cut with something else, honestly. It resembled salt and it burned like hell when he snorted it. He did two lines about an hour ago, and he was still so fucking high. He had done meth before, but he’d never done it right before work.
“We should…we should go before they call the bloody authorities,” Fab declared. She dabbed under her eyes with a tissue, careful not to wipe away her eyeliner and mascara. The three of them stood up and left the park.
Harry was pondering these facts as he travelled home after his Criminal Justice class. When he got inside the house, he put his bag down and walked over to Teddy. He picked Teddy up and said, “Bonjour, mon petit. Comment ça va? Est-ce que ta mamie fait le dîner? [Hello, little bit. How are you? Is your grandma making dinner?]”
The girls laughed even harder, and Sally asked through her humorous tears, “Draco, what the bloody hell are you?”
Harry was ready to call it a day. He was sat on Draco's couch, watching a Back to the Future marathon. His boyfriend had been beyond happy for him, and it appeared that Cauliflower and Halloween were happy for him too. They had been snuggled up to him ever since he arrived at the small apartment. Or maybe they were happy about the feline-like smell that McGonagall had left on him…
wizarding neighborhood. The press was only becoming more and more overbearing since McGonagall announced that Hogwarts would be looking for professors for the Defense Against the Dark Arts classes. Who did Harry think was worthy of the position? Did he think that it was still cursed? Did he think that Ron's older brother, Charlie, would be selected as a professor? What about Neville Longbottom?
Draco dressed himself in one of the ministry’s bathrooms. His uniform, neat jeans and a black polo shirt, smelled a bit weird as it usually did, mimicking the booze and shitty cheese fries of the bar. Although at first it reminded him of his shitty life and horrible decision, the smell was welcoming to him now. Once dressed, he apparated into the employee bathroom of the Black Cauldron. It more so resembled a broom closet; people rarely entered it unless it was opening or closing time. Draco rarely worked the opening shift, noon to eight at night, but he kept track of who was working if he’d needed to apparate.
Twenty minutes later, he went back inside the house to wash dishes and vacuum (the beauty of magicked muggle appliances was that they could become silent). After that, he woke up Teddy for a bath. The toddler was not happy.
He moved into the next room. This particular room was poorly lit and was filled with tons of furniture: a couch, a bookcase filled with books, several chairs, a table, and some shelves. There was a note on the table next to the entrance. The note read, “Find the key or be trapped forever.”
Ron and Harry were up next. Ron grabbed Harry’s arm and whispered in his ear, “If we blow the bloody first spell, we’re failing this activity for sure. I can’t believe the last team did that.”
After that, he chugged two cups of black coffee and got out the ingredients for a pork roast. If he were to dress Teddy, dress himself, do last-minute cleaning, and cook dinner, he would have to start early. So, he cut up carrots and potatoes and pork until 9AM. At that time, he woke Teddy up and bathed him. The toddler didn’t make it an easy job and his squeals woke Andromeda at 9:30. She vacuumed and dusted, and Harry dressed Teddy up in his giraffe costume. Teddy seemed to like it because he’d often change his skin color to match the browns and yellows of the outfit.
“Uh...yeah,” Harry replied. They both seemed to be at a loss for words. For a moment, Narcissa merely stared at Harry with her mouth open. Then, she shook herself out of her stupor.
Draco jumped off the couch when his alarm clock went off at noon. He wiped the sleep off his eyes. Before he apparated away, he drank another cup of coffee and poured out food for his two cats, Halloween and Cauliflower. He kissed them goodbye, locked his door, and went to the probation office.
The dizziness and low blood sugar hit Draco when he stepped out of the shower. He performed a few minor healing charms on his arms and thighs; consequently, he made himself dizzier as a cleaning alcohol-like smell came over him. He faltered towards the kitchen. He grabbed a piece of bread to munch on as he cracked an egg into the skillet on the stove. Draco tried not to keep much food in the house, but he was sure to always have fruit, bread, and eggs in case something like this happened. He didn’t like to eat much, for the uppers he took decreased his appetite most of the time. He ate the egg—sunny side up—slowly and with certainty. If he ate it slowly enough, he wouldn’t be too hungry afterwards. As he swallowed the last bits of the egg, he thought back to his father—sitting in Azkaban, his long, white-blond hair gradually falling out. Draco was going to buy some brown hair dye today.
.          “I didn’t think that he…I mean, he’s not a…he’s not actually…” Malfoy bit his tongue, literally. He then sucked in his teeth, as if he were telling himself to shut up.
Harry sat outside for about twenty more minutes and then found his way inside. He found Draco admiring the brownie graveyard by the dessert table.
The door sounded at 8:55, and Andromeda welcomed Ron and Hermione in. Harry took a deep and shaky breath. She brought them into the kitchen and Harry set the table. Ron and Hermione embraced Harry with hugs.
“You do know who Astoria is, right? Daphne’s younger sister. Lovely girl, but c’mon! It just...it all showed that my mother didn’t really care nor support me.”
.          Draco thought back to Andromeda addressing this child in French. This little, half-blood, werewolf child with pink-hair. The child who responded in both French and English. Draco unclenched his right fist and slowly moved his hand upwards, as if the child was an animal that might strike if he moved too quickly. Andromeda was very close to Draco. He could make out her frown lines, only highlighted by the dumb, goofy grin that accompanied her face. Had anyone ever been this happy to see him in his entire life?
“Y’know, this is the place where we really first talked,” Draco said in a tone that made the fact sound like common sense, but not common knowledge—like the differences between Inferi and ghosts.
“Oi, Draco! Two Pimms and Lemonade. And cut that spacey thing out; we’re still busy,” Sally announced to him. He glanced at her a few times while he made the drinks. Her hair was loose, and her bright pink bangs covered her left eye. A bead of sweat was making its way down her forehead as she took orders, handed out beers, and collected bills. He went back to concentrating on the drink orders.
I would love to join you for dinner. It’d be nice to spend time with Andy and Teddy, also. Thank you. Please send me an owl so that I know the time and place.
“Y-yeah. I-I just didn’t hear you and…” Harry trailed off. Would he admit that he was scared of silence when Narcissa, the woman who lied to Voldemort to save his life, sat right there?
.          He looked back at Potter. The man seemed to be attempting to feign an indifference to this train-wreck, but he was failing miserably: his face was shaped with amusement and slight worry. Did he think that Draco would

“I don’t see how I couldn’t be,” said Ron. “One, I’m not a bigot. Two, Charlie is aroace and Ginny is a bi trans girl. Excuse me, woman.”
“You were staring at the floor. You’ve barely even touched your food. It’s nearly 9PM, Harry. Are you okay?”
"Woah there, Potter. This is our first civil conversation, no need to get too comfortable too quick."
understand. His therapist's initial diagnosis of PTSD scared him so much that he left the session to go home and cry. Heroes weren't supposed to be crazy, were they?
They were about to go inside when Andromeda’s owl arrived with two letters. One for Harry and one for Andromeda, respectively from Ginny and Narcissa.
“No,” he said forcefully. “I’m not losing my shit today. Not today. Not now. Not today, damn it!” His body jerked a few times, and he started to hiccup. The rocking got worse. “No no no no no no no,” he repeated. He shook his head with each “no” and started rubbing his hands together. He was told that sometimes “calming sensations” would help before a panic attack. They never did. He counted to ten and backwards in English. He did the same in French. He got to “four” in Spanish before he started to hyperventilate. He decided to focus on the floor.
“Um, free nachos? Fuck yeah!” Neville exclaimed. He clapped Harry on the back. Harry grinned in response.
“Y’know,” Harry said. “I couldn’t access the bank for a few months after the war. Teir policy against thieves apparently included me.”
“Kosher, mate,” Harry responded. “The Jewish term is kosher, and making fun of it makes you a bit anti-Semitic. And really, with a Muslim friend, you should really know what ‘halal’ means.”
They stood in silence and threw their cigarette butts away. Harry was ready to go back indoors when Draco pointed up and said, “Mistletoe.”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“That’s okay, bud. We can do that. It’s no problem,” Harry said. He smiled and grabbed Teddy’s hand. The toddler wiped his tears away, still somewhat angry. Andromeda squeezed Harry’s arm. He had never told her where Tonks died, so he supposed that she assumed it was here. He offered her a sad smile. It was then that he looked at the Great Hall.
Harry drew a breath. His life was finally going to start. No more ghosts and no more worries (his therapist would be proud, he thought). He exhaled, looked down, and began to walk.
Over the next five days, they finished the fudge, the cookies (sugar, red velvet, and chocolate chip), the pies (mince, cherry, and chocolate), and the cakes (vanilla and marble). Harry could not foresee looking at another pastry. But it was the day before the party (Christmas Eve Eve) and he was up at 4 AM so that he could start on the dinner.
.          “Draco?” she yelled. She walked towards him, Harry and Teddy following her. “Why, I, I haven’t seen you since you were a baby! Do you remember me? It’s me: your aunt Andy. Andromeda, that is. Do you remember? I’m your mother’s sister. I, she, I couldn’t see you. I wasn’t permitted to see you after you turned one. How are you? How have you been? Are you okay? Do you remember me?”
“Yes, I do. Two boys and a baby girl. My wife’s name was Maria, and our children were Marco, Jeremiah, and Susana,” he stated, a somber look filling his face.
.          “Would you like some tea?” Harry whispered to Andromeda, careful not to awaken the toddler.
It had been a while since he had had a nightmare this vivid and this long. He sighed deeply and stood up. He made his way to the kitchen. After starting the coffee pot, he went outside for a smoke. He had smoked about three cigarettes before he calmed down enough to enter the house again. His cup of black coffee went with him as he went outside for a final smoke before showering.
“You’re such a weirdo,” Fab stated. They all laughed. “So, am I doing your hair before work tonight?”
Like every Monday, Harry left the house at 8 AM so that he could get Starbucks and still be on time for his 9 AM Psych class.
Malfoy choked out a humorless laugh and said, “Right, Potter. My poor, bigoted parents.” He rolled his eyes again.
"Do you think it'll fix me…?" He asked, slightly embarrassed by his own question. He already knew what she was going to say.
"Harry, I didn't want to wake you. I know that you haven't slept well lately, so I let you sleep pretty long. I went ahead and put the turkey in the oven and the ham in the Crock Pot. They should both be done by 8 this morning—don't worry, I've set my alarm and
Harry smiled and walked over to Mr. Weasley and Draco. He waved when Draco noticed him. The two spoke for a few more minutes until Mr. Weasley excused himself.
.          Andromeda nodded. She blinked the tears out of her eyes. “Just, cut Draco a break, okay? I
“I don’t…I don’t remember how to make a martini,” the assistant admitted. Draco could see a shameful blush creeping up on his cheekbones. It took all of Draco’s self-control not to make fun of him or roll his eyes.
to make these things come true, or to do whatever other moral a white Suburban mum would tell you. You've got a lot of decisions to make and a lot of changes to come. Embrace them." She took a deep breath and put her clipboard on her desk.
"We have it mapped out by House, gender, and year. We have eighteen boys' dorms, eighteen girls' dorms, and ten gender-neutral dorms for our first years. Per house, we have twenty girls' dorms, twenty boys' dorms, and seventeen gender-neutral dorms. Hogwarts is prepared for 1,100 students in all."
"I took a nap and forgot to put the turkey in the oven. Andromeda did it and left me a note. I woke up at 2 AM to find it and flipped"
Dousselsnorf pointed towards the door and said, “Now, you walk out of here, and you never walk back in here, okay? I hate it when people get out only to be sent back in again.”
Draco giggled and Harry found himself to be staring at the blond again. He noticed that the cold had caused Draco's lips to swell a little bit. Draco caught his eye and Harry looked away, ashamed to be seen staring.
.          “Yes, well, I thought that it was still important to establish bilingualism in him, regardless of his blood status,” Andromeda replied. She smiled warmly at Malfoy.
.          He tried his best not to run off the campus, but once he got out of their line of sight—and he made bloody
The nurse came in and signaled for Ron to leave as she checked Harry’s head. Harry lie in the bed after she left. He had already missed about ten days that year,
Harry’s thoughts ended as he reached the head auror office. He entered his department and headed over to his assigned physical training position alongside Ron. The ginger offered him a reassuring smile: this would be a long day.
Draco put the toddler on his back and bounced around the room. He asked Harry, “Did you like the internship?”
Neville winced at Harry’s drunkenness. He informed the bartenders, "We'll have four shots of fireball, two Blue Labels, two martinis, and a water."
"I see," Harry stated. He felt awkward. This seemed too professional to really be a meeting between him and McGonagall. He smiled at her, trying to break the bizarreness in the atmosphere.
.          Harry took Andromeda and Teddy out for dinner after they finished the informal tour. Harry turned in early so that he could get some studying in before his classes the next day, but he ended up not being able to concentrate and simply tossed his textbook across the room.
he failed the course alongside whatever other assignments he had had. What the hell was he going to do now?
Accepting that he wouldn’t be able to sleep, Harry decided to make a list of everything he wanted to get done before Ron and Hermione arrived, for he had gotten their letter after dinner the night before. He wrote, “Shower, tidy room, vacuum house, wash dishes, fix breakfast, bathe Teddy, fix coffee, do homework.”
Harry walked to the muggle bus stop closest to the house. He arrived at the University of Manchester fairly quickly, so he went to the nearest Starbucks for a coffee. It was there that he saw a familiar face.
His therapist claimed that thinking too much was dangerous, but Harry couldn’t see it. “Hermione would not be proud,” he thought.
He was shaken out of his thoughts when Potter gladly added, “And one for me.” The man put his elbow on the counter so that he could get closer to Draco and Xavier. He put up his hand as if he were sharing a secret. “I’m trying to slow down,” he failed at whispering. Draco tried his best not to laugh. He usually loved it when patrons were giggly drunks; they were much better than the angry or horny ones. They radiated a kind of happiness that Draco’d only ever dreamed feeling. He looked at Longbottom, who was shaking his head in both amusement and shame, and tried to keep his emotions masked. His AA counselor told him that he’d feel a ton of confusing emotions after getting clean, but he never told Draco that he’d feel like vomiting and laughing out of nerves at the same time. Potter stepped back, self-awareness spreading over him. “Three….three martinis, please.”
He swept the leaves into a garbage bag and went inside the house. Everything looked perfect. All of the decorations were up and the goody bags were fixed. The only things left to do were the graveyard brownies and the dinner. Andromeda and Harry decided to clean on the twenty-ninth, bake brownies on the thirtieth, and cook dinner a few hours before the party started.
“Oh, well, they are. All the rumors are true. I am simultaneously shagging Ginny, Hermione, Ron, and apparently Mrs. Weasley,” Harry joked. He turned around to greet Dean but stepped back due to surprise. Dean was holding hands with Seamus, and both men were grinning at Harry.
After Harry finished his firewhiskey, he gathered the bags of candy and apparated home. He soon put the candy on the dining table, then entered the kitchen where Andromeda was making candy apples.
. Four: I was scared for my family. Five: I knew that the Dark Lord would kill me for being gay. Six: he was in my
.          Draco unlocked his door as Gonzalo sputtered. He slammed the door shut when he got in. It was only then that he let himself fall apart.
After he finished, he walked to his next class, English 101. It seemed a little bit silly, he figured, going to English class when you speak the language. But this would be an easy A.
Seeming satisfied with this answer, Malfoy went on to craft his own. He said, “Well, if you must know, I’ve been very angry with my parents. It-It’s something that happened about a year ago. As you know, the aurors began to round up Death Eaters and You-Know-W— Vol— You-Know-Who’s supporters beginning on May fifth. So, I was consequently with my parents after the Battle until May seventh. In that time. I decided to tell my father that—” Malfoy stopped. He seemed choked up. Harry waited respectfully and attentively until Malfoy spat out, “Well, I-I decided to tell him that I’m gay. And he...he. Nevertheless, he wasn’t happy or supportive, but he was sentenced to Azkaban soon so that was that. That’s not what really hurt, though. When You-Know-Who was still at large, you know, residing in the Manor, I told my mother— secretly, mind you. And she ignored me. She acted like I never told her. I thought that it was all an act for the Dark Lord, but then, after the war and before she was exiled, she tried to set me up with Astoria Greengrass!” Malfoy stopped to breathe and he looked at Harry.
"And one for me," Harry beamed. He turned back to Malfoy and his assistant. He whispered, "I'm trying to slow down." He giggled a bit and then blushed. Malfoy looked like he was trying to choose between barfing and laughing. Harry suddenly felt like an idiot. “Three…three martinis, please,” He repeated.
[Let’s go say ‘hi’ to your aunt.]” He picked Teddy up and walked downstairs to the kitchen where Andromeda was reading the mail.
So, at 4:30 PM, when Harry had arrived home, he ran straight to his room and changed. He put on some kakis, a mint green dress shirt, and a silver-black striped tie. With a sigh, Harry stepped out of his room and into the living room.
"Yes, and that is why I think that this roll is perfect for you. We need someone talented and intelligent, yes, but also humble and gentle."
Harry nodded and they both leaned in. Their lips touched and they slowly moved them together. It was gentle and perfect. Harry moved his chest to where it touched Draco’s and pushed the latter back against the wall. Draco deepened the kiss. His lips parted and he began to suck on Harry’s lower lip. They both moved apart and then back together again. Their tongues softly touched and Harry felt like he could stay there forever. Then the door to the restaurant opened and the men moved apart. Harry’s glasses were fogged.
Harry got out all of his notes for his exam preparations. He knew that he’d ace his French, bio, philosophy, and world history exams, so he really only needed to study geometry, econ, sociology, and art history. However, out of all of his courses, he couldn’t pick out one that he loved. Even if he was good at teaching, whom and what would he teach?
His glance moved on to Fab, who was cleaning up in the kitchen between nacho orders. He thought back to when he met Fab and Sally’s friends for the first time. They were a lively bunch, and most of them had coloured hair and tattoos and piercings. Halfway through that night, Draco plucked up the courage to ask Sally, “Are all your friends gay?”
“Not if it means I actually get to eat the food that I make. Besides, I don’t mind spinach and broccoli.”
One thing that still made Harry nervous, though he wouldn’t dare admit it to Draco, was telling their loved ones. He knew that Narcissa didn’t know, and he was constantly resolving to tell Hermione and Ron about it. If he couldn’t even handle telling his best friends, who could he tell?
.          Draco became a bit more confused. The Blacks taught their children French because they wanted to preserve their heritage…their
.          Andromeda had already prepared dinner when Harry arrived. Harry set the table for her as she woke Teddy up from his nap. The boy came sprinting into the dining room when he’d realized that his godfather was there.
"I took the Ambien about an hour before I laid down. I laid down around 10, but I don't think I fell asleep until 12. I'm not sure, though; I tried not to look at the clock. For the first night, I didn't wake up due to a nightmare or whatever. I do feel really sluggish though," Harry replied. He'd been seeing Dr. Shelly for a while, so he had learned by now that she liked details—not only because it helped give her information but also because it helped her know how Harry's memory was doing.
.          Andromeda looked down in disappointment. “No,” she admitted. “He’s probably just busy. Didn’t you say that that class you share is rather difficult?”
Harry sat down right next to him. In such close proximity, he could make out the various blonds in Draco’s hair, the blue-ish grey of his irises, and the curves of his jaw. Harry cleared his throat and looked away. He almost forgot what he was there for.
“I’ll be in the living room with Teddy,” said Andromeda. “I wouldn’t want to invade on your private conversations.”
"This isn't special treatment. You led a group named 'Dumbledore's Army,' you defended Hogwarts, you defeated Voldemort."
Nevertheless, Harry decided to allocate his time to Andromeda and Teddy when he got home. He started by cooking chicken alfredo and fruit salad. After dinner, Andromeda and Harry sat outside drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes, and watching Teddy play.
“I’m so sorry,” Draco said. He started to harshly rub his knuckles across his left forearm where the Dark Mark was.
He read it aloud, “Introduction to the Study of Religions and Theology—Monday and Friday from 10AM to 12PM, and Wednesday from 11AM to 12PM. Standing on the Shoulders of Giants—Tuesday from 2PM to 4PM and Thursday from 2PM to 3PM. Introduction to Islam—Monday and Friday from 1PM to 3PM, and Wednesday from 1PM to 2PM. Problems in the Philosophy of Religion 1—Tuesday from 4PM to 5PM and Thursday from 12PM to 2PM.”
To say that Harry was excited for this conference was an over exaggeration in the least. Hogwarts had re-opened last year, but the renovations were still occurring. At that point, not many people wanted to return anyways. There were so many remedial classes and off-limits areas of the school that it hardly felt like Hogwarts.
Nevertheless, Harry finally knew what he had to do. He was on his way to the department now: 4PM on a Wednesday. He and Andromeda had spoken the night before about Harry’s options, and they were both aware that Harry’s current mental state couldn’t handle the training process and the subsequent stress of the career.
“Do they sell more charms here? I’d like to buy—actually. Never mind.” Draco dropped his voice. “I bet that I can find some wizarding charms in Diagon Alley.”
Harry had attended a muggle university in hopes of not running into anyone from the wizarding world, but lo and behold, there stood none-other-than Draco Malfoy.
.          “I’ll write you tonight!” Andromeda yelled after him. She frowned as he got further away. “Oh, dear. Do you think we scared him?”
“Anything but bloody Alchemy. I didn’t care for the subject at Hogwarts! Why would I care for it now?” Ron stabbed his fork into his kidney pie.
Harry grabbed the Tupperware containers filled with spaghetti and salad. He decided to sit in the living room and desperately hoped that Teddy would not want to play today. Harry was developing a horrible headache, and with everything that was going on, he didn’t want the toddler to see him breakdown.
Currently, he has skimming his Advanced Charm Theory notes, simultaneously attempting to decipher his own handwriting. He’d only made it through one chapter when he decided to check the clock.
.          “He changed, you know,” Harry rushed. “Regulus. He changed. When I was trying to locate the horcruxes to defeat Voldemort, I found out that Regulus destroyed the first one. He switched sides and sacrificed himself.”
He stepped back, breaking their eye contact, and asked, “What drinks would you like? We currently have our special Black Cauldron Potion, which is a mix of tequila, dark rum, and cranberry juice.”
On Monday morning, he breezed through his psychology class. His professor affirmed that they soon would be assigned a research paper that would be twenty percent of their total grade. Filled with worry, Harry walked to his English class deep in thought. Thus, he almost didn’t notice when a familiar voice called his name.
“I will now take roll,” announced the professor, an old man with a hoarse voice and vivid sweat stains.
“Er…” Harry did not know why, but he did not want to tell Malfoy’s mother about how unhealthy and, well, sad he looked. He answered, “We’ve spoken. We have to classes together and...er...have had lunch together.”
At that time, the fat white cat came running through the room at full speed. It knocked over a table. Harry jumped and it ran the other way.
Draco set his backpack down and walked into his so-called bedroom. With no mattress, pillow, nor blanket, he lay down on the itchy carpet. Draco didn’t remember much after that, but he did remember being awaken at some time in the afternoon by an extremely loud bulldozer and construction crew. He sat up and wiped his face. After realizing where he was, he took a few pills and lit up a cigarette.
world, of all places. Harry hadn’t spent a lot of time thinking about Malfoy, no—at least that’s what he’d kept telling himself. He was done obsessing with things. He’d promised Ron and Hermione and his therapist and everyone else that he was done with his little obsessions. Besides, university was more important than Malfoy, whom Harry would very likely never see again.
“Well, according to Hermione, it’s only a ‘promise’ and their actual wedding wouldn’t be until, like, eight years from now.”
“Oh,” Draco replied, “He, uh, I went to school with him. We didn’t really get along well, so I was surprised to see him.”
They travelled with Teddy to Clos Maggiore via cab. It was then that Harry got a good look at Draco. He had a tiny bit of hair gel applied to his blond hair—just enough to hold it out of his face. He was wearing black dress pants and a dark green dress shirt with a trench coat over top of it.
“Do you like it? I did it,” a sing-song voice behind him asked. He turned around to greet Luna with a hug.
"Potter, you haven't gotten a clue. Your first year had about 40 students, but, by your sixth year, that number decreased to 25."
When he entered the “café,” Harry was automatically greeted with the smell of cigarettes and beer. He and Malfoy shared a semi-disgusted look.
There was slight disappointment after Harry departed eu to the fact that the kiss was never discussed. Harry almost didn’t mind because he really had enjoyed spending time with Draco.
“Okay,” Draco said. And that was that. And that only made Harry like Draco more: because he knew when to drop something.
The other children ran to acknowledge Harry, asking for his name, age, and normal job. Ms. Claire smiled as they asked if he had a wife or kids or, more importantly, any pets. She politely told them to carry on like normal because Harry would introduce himself when everyone arrived.
The minutes slowly ticked away until they were chanting “10, 9, 8,…” When the "1" sounded, they witnessed the ball land and all of the couples on TV kiss. Harry and Draco shared a somewhat innocent smile.
Harry knew that his boyfriend as still uncomfortable around Luna because she had been a prisoner in the Malfoy Manor, so he tried to manipulate their conversations into small talk. It wasn't the best thing, but Draco would do the same for him.
“Perfect. For the inside, we can levitate rubber bats and put up some cute, cardboard cutouts of monsters. We can do vampires and mummies, but I think that werewolves would be rather inappropriate. Oh, and shouldn’t we all wear costumes?”
He came to a stop just next to the Kilburn Building, the school of Computer Science. He giggled to himself. Why would a wizard need to learn computer science? And why was his mouth so dry? He got off his broom and decided that the former question was more important. He started walking down the street.
“Dementor?” Ron asked, slightly confused. “Oh! That’s your…that’s your Boggart. No, that was room four. I had just finished room three when Professor Proudfoot stopped the course. Do you want some chocolate?”
"Okay, okay. I get it," Harry bit back. He just wanted to feel normal again. "So what can I do in the meantime?"
“When?” Draco asked. He was genuinely confused. Even if she were referencing the group of wizards, who did she mean?
One year and three months ago, Draco moved to his apartment complex. He had almost nothing except for enough money for two months’ rent, his wand, and the clothes and several pill bottles that fit into a small backpack he bought from ASDA. After signing the contract and receiving his key, he treaded up the stairs to the second floor. His apartment was 2B, and it looked and smelled like tweakers had lived there the past few months.
“Personal interests? Other opportunities? Soul searching?” Harry snorted after that last addition. They took their respective seats next to one-another. They pulled out their ministry-issued Dark Charms and Spell Disarmament textbooks and turned their eyes to the professor, an ex-entrepreneur who was obsessed with ancient Greek gods. Despite her apparent grace and maturity, she was hideously ugly; she was covered with warts and scars—her face marred by dark spots and saggy, unsavory skin. Harry rubbed his eyes and glanced at the clock.
The night of the twenty-first, Harry could hardly sleep. It was common knowledge that stress and nervousness could trigger insomnia. So he tossed an turned and meditated and took his sleeping meds and finally, at 2 AM, he fell asleep.

The movie ended and the two men walked out of the theater. Without thinking, Harry reached his hand down to meet Draco’s. Draco blushed and commented, “I think it’s weird that Anakin could just win a race without any practice.”
“You’re like some kind of royalty, aren’t you?” She laughed even harder, as if she found her questions to be ridiculous. “You don’t understand slang. You can’t clean. You don’t understand basic household appliances. And your name is
. He chose this seat so that he wouldn’t attract any attention. Now his bloody table partner had chosen to do something stupid and merit others’ judgement. Draco sneered at him. Potter rolled his eyes, and Draco felt himself growing red like he did the other night—the night when Potter
They continued their walk to class in silence. It was a five minute wait before the professor walked in and called out, “Okay, who can tell me
A solitary bird chirped. The snow had finally melted from the ground a fortnight before. Harry tossed and turned in his bed.
He shook his head and replied, "Nope. Not even good ones. Is that nor…" he stopped himself. She didn't like it when he said "normal." "…regular?"
He watched as Granger took the tray to their table, the female Weasley clapping loudly at the sight of her mango rum. Draco watched as she put her arm around Luna Lovegood. His eyes darted to Potter, blissfully unaware of his surroundings. Draco turned to look at Finnigan and Thomas, holding hands. He didn’t know why he was surprised.
Once inside the store, Draco merely stood by the door, looking at all the glittering merchandise with wide eyes.
“Hey, mate,” Ron said. “Dazed out again?” The ginger looked exhausted with small black bags under his eyes.
Harry still didn't know if he trusted her. After growing up with the Dursleys, hearing about "shrinks" and how mental health is "bullshit," he still couldn't help but feel that all of this was stupid. He'd only gotten a therapist in the first place due to Hermione's pushing. He never expected to go to therapy for this long. He never expected it to help. He never expected to get so attached to his therapist. He looked up from his lap. Dr. Shelly was watching him.
Harry could not sleep. It was 4AM and nothing helped. Yes, he tried everything. Exercise. Warm milk. Violin music. Yoga. Melatonin. Breathing exercises. Grounding techniques. Dreamless sleep potions (Calm down, he only took one. He wasn’t going to get addicted.).
"I get to set up my classroom and all that jazz in mid-July, then I go full-time along with the students. I never thought that I'd see the Hogwarts train again…"
“Well,” Harry stopped to do his breathing exercises to steady his beating heart. “Me too. And I attend meetings—once every other week—for my PTSD. And they help.”
“Oh, Harry! I’m so sorry about Teddy. I told him to leave you alone. I guess he got bored while I was checking the mail,” Andromeda said, frowning.
One moment, he was back at Hogwarts and facing Voldemort. Then, he was in Andromeda's kitchen. Then, he was in the Dursleys' kitchen.
. He had finished it fairly quickly since it was just a written portion on Anti-Deadly Disease Wards. Going into the exam, Harry assumed that the hardest part would be remembering the difference between the old Latin, Arabic, and Greek names, but once he finished, he realized that he would be lucky to pass at all. His suspicions were confirmed later that day when the results were posted: he had failed massively.
“I thought she hated Hagrid,” Harry questioned, peering through the glass caressing around the earrings.
Harry inhaled. He did his breathing exercises. “My therapist is going to be really proud of me for talking about my feelings. So I’m going to be straight-forward: I like you…in a, y’know, romantic way. I was wondering if you felt the same and what those kisses meant to you.”
“Yeah,” he said. They all had yet to talk about their families or childhoods in great detail, so he wasn’t going to mention that he somehow enjoyed a mattress on the floor more than a grand bed with silk sheets and a million pillows. Maybe it was the mentality behind it, he silently argued.
Harry smiled shyly and shrugged. They moved closer to each other. Harry relaxingly put his arms in Draco’s shoulders because the latter was taller. Draco put his hands on Harry’s waist. They tilted their heads and leaned closer.
Afterwards, Draco was going in to work. This was the eighth day in a row that he had closed, and he wasn’t entirely sure that it was healthy, but he was glad to have the extra money. Maybe he’d convince himself to eat at some point. He was still recovering—no matter how slowly.
The building looked the same as it did when he first visited: old, antique, ancient. Draco didn’t care which one it was. Growing up as a Malfoy, they all felt like synonyms—or maybe that was his French brain talking. He was about to check in when he saw a familiar head of black hair. He hid behind the potted plant in front of the door and peered out. He saw dark skin, messy and curly hair, and a lightning-bolt shaped scar. There was no bloody way. There was no bloody way that Potter was there.
[AN*: major trigger warning for panic attack and repetition] Harry folded up the note and wiped away a tear. His throat began to contract and he felt as if a train was using his chest as its track. He knew what this was. His therapist had given him instructions for what to do for panic attacks. But, at this time, Harry couldn't concentrate on where he was—let alone counting to four.

.          Andromeda frowned. She had been doing a lot of that recently. “Harry…” she almost whispered. “Look, I know that the Malfoys and Blacks aren’t exactly perfect people.” He looked at her in disbelief. Was she really defending them now? Her own family that disowned her? She continued, “Don’t, don’t! Just hear me out, okay? Narcissa and Lucius are, or were, both…” she sighed, uncertain about her words. “They’re both alcoholics. They have always used alcohol to cope with things, and I’m sure that that’s all Draco learned. You have to give him a break. I’m sure that if Regulus had been given a chance…things would have been…different…”
Draco bit the inside of his cheek. Harry could tell that he was trying not to tear up. He reached over and touched the blond’s arm in reassurance.
Harry awoke to Teddy jumping on top of his bed. His tiny feet would occasionally hit Harry in the legs. Harry just lay there—his brain still not working enough to make him get up. It took another minute or two for Teddy’s jumps to travel up his legs, forcing Harry to jump up and cover his groin when the toddler’s left foot almost landed there.
It was all very stressful. So, yes: Harry was anticipating a new term at the University of Manchester. He had decided to go to university because it was what he wanted—which was strange for Harry. Hermione was excited due to the fact that she was attending Oxford for chemistry. “We need more girls in the STEM fields,” she had said. Ron was working to be an auror. Neville decided to study Herbology so that he could help Madam Sprout teach—a shock to everyone. For a while, Harry’d felt that everyone had their futures and careers planned out—everyone except for him. Andromeda warned him that he arguably had had the most stressful circumstances and so he needed rest time.
aren't mentally ill. So, after the war, I was a little giddy without my parents' everlasting influence. I went to a muggle psych and he diagnosed me with clinical depression and substance abuse. I dunno…after rehab, I've never liked doctors and therapists."
The sky was dark and the atmosphere was cold. Not a star was in sight and it appeared to be either a New Moon kind of evening or extremely cloudy. When Harry lied down, it was clearly afternoon. Surely he hadn't slept until the late evening? He rolled over on his side and checked his alarm clock.
On his first day, Harry woke up early and promptly gathered all of his supplies. He could never think of another time he’d been this prepared as he thought, “Blimey, Hermione’d be proud.”
, he was more so excited for his date with Draco. He felt like a giddy teenager: anticipating a movie date.
“Dementor!” Harry called out. He wasn’t sure why he was announcing it or to whom. He was alone, wasn’t he? He was…. Everything went black.
“So, Draco,” Andromeda spoke up, ignoring Teddy’s newest temper tantrum over the color of his sippy cup. “What made you decide on history?”
He sighed again as he went to untie the letters from the bird’s claws. It pecked him when he removed the letters from its mouth.
, Harry found himself shopping alone. School had let out days before and Harry was rather bored without the necessary studying and working. There was also the fact that he needed to purchase gifts for Professor Flitwick, Headmistress McGonagall, Professor, Sprout, Seamus, Dean, Ernie, Cho, and most of the Weasleys. He left after breakfast and traveled to London. He was ready for major Christmas shopping and, in fact, didn’t plan to come home before he was done.
“I suppose I could ask you the same,” Malfoy attempted with a sneer, but it did not work. The blond had lost a considerable amount of weight, his eyes were bloodshot and had deep bags underneath, and his skin was as grey as it was in sixth year.
at the bottom. Between the bottom of the window and the top of McGonagall’s picture, there was a modest mural of Harry’s patronus.
"'Fix' you?" Dr. Shelly inquired, "What do you mean? Harry, there is no "fix" for mental illness. We can treat symptoms, but you have to understand that this isn't something that makes you 'broken' or merits 'fixing.' It's all just neurotransmitters and bad experiences." He sighed and bit his lip. He'd been staring at his lap ever since she started her mini-rant. She continued, "The Ambien CR will help you as much as it can. Not everyone's brain is compatible with it, but I think that yours is doing well. You'll take it for about another month, and then we're going to re-analyze where you're standing and how much it has helped you. If you really need to keep taking it, we'll have you go a couple of weeks without it before prescribing it again. People get addicted to this stuff all the time, and the last thing you need is an addiction."
