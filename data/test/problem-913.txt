The next person to accost Draco was Millie, who dragged him into a corner of the common room and stared him down. "I saw Theo walking off with you and a bottle of sake after the party- but you've been sad, so I waited to ask. But he's oddly quiet, now, and you're hiding down here instead of haring off after your Gryffindors, and Potter's been knocking at the portrait until the prefects send him away- so tell me, Grindelwald. What's going on?"
"I was so close to that," he muttered. "You've no idea, I was so close-"
Draco expected Langlock to come out of the talon wand, but he lacked the concentration for it. Without the dams on his power tight, the impact would throw Theo back and upset Severus's herbs. So he kept it out without casting, and Theo laughed.
And he did, and he remembered what Luna had said, and it was easier to deny when it came from his beloved cousin than when it came from his equally-beloved but implacable, demanding godfather. "I think," he squeaked, "Luna might have been right."
Her smile was sadder than the one Draco preferred. "Tom used to do the same thing, sometimes."
"No," Theo said confidently. "You... it's you, Draco, you're..." The words seemed slow coming from his inebriated mind, if anything a bit more wasted than Draco. But once they came, Draco very much wished he was sober for this, that both of them were. "I've really liked playing Quidditch with you this year, Draco... I've liked us being close again. It's made me- I've had to think about a lot of things, things I didn't want to acknowledge about you- about myself-"
"I don't want to."
"That's clearly not it," replied Millie, narrowing her eyes. "Look, I've known you almost all my life. I care about you. And I can tell you're downright miserable."
"Yes," she replied brightly. "That was an easy one!"
"You can't blame me for not being there," snapped Theo. "I wasn't involved. I've been there for you,
Theo in the red line- his greatest crimes were his words about Harry, and his leaving Draco during the Quidditch trials. But here Draco was, musing on the easier topic of Theo. Harry- and Draco himself- were the more fraught pieces of this particular puzzle. There's no question, especially after he promised Sev- Draco will have to break it off. Because he's awful, and he can't exist alongside Harry. Because Luna was right, and he's been making decisions
"Maybe I'm a commoner then too," Draco retorted, and Theo shook his head, blue eyes practically glowing. The green tint to the flames made them look almost more like emeralds, like-
accuse me of that. I was there when Moody forced you to give yourself the Mark, I read to you when you had magical exhaustion- and as for the Quidditch trials, that was bad planning on your part."
"Love the way she does? Does she love anyone? Maybe your mother, I suppose."
vain boy, and you will have your answer. Though, I warn you, you may not like what you see. When one compares one's self-image to one's actions-" He cut himself off abruptly. "Look to your actions, Draco."
Sudden exhaustion overtook Draco. "Ask Hermione," he mumbled, despondent. "You won't understand if I try to explain." His heart was broken, and all he wanted to do was lie in silence awhile.
She shook her head, eyes softening. "There is no
"Up for a game?" Blaise asked, already shuffling.
To Draco's everlasting shock, Theo pushed his cursed face forward, his voice gone quieter, and said, "No, sir, I provoked him. It was my fault."
him."
I love you. It took everything in Draco not to laugh at those earnest words.
"It's happening
"How can I answer that?" moaned Draco.
"But do you think that I think you're
"This is a daiginjo... no, Draco, that's not like a dacquiri... see, my father's been trying to teach me how to drink since last summer, so we've been doing a world tour of fine liquors, and I know you always talked about wanting sake the most. I had him send some for me. He said only if we win, though. I can't wait to write and tell him!"
"There are Nargles flapping all about you," she replied. "It makes sense, I suppose. Their migratory period is..."
"You love me," Draco echoed. "Right. Theo, I don't think you know what you-"
Draco was flying by himself, this time, trying to avoid the imminent reckoning- but as luck would have it, the reckoning found him, in the form of the dark-haired boy who never failed to make his heart leap. There he stood, watching Draco from the pitch, and Draco's stomach dropped. He didn't want to fly anymore.
Bellatrix loved Mother as naught but residue of their shared sisterhood, an old bond warped by who she'd become. Draco didn't want that either, didn't want to tie himself to someone or something because of an emotion from the blue loop, because of longevity or circumstance.
that he could stop thinking of himself as evil long enough to see Harry as an equal, not an idol, not something to be protected.
It sounded like good reasoning to Draco, who had also discovered the usefulness of the storerooms as a good emergency place to be alone, albeit before with Harry. With Harry, though, he was terrified of Severus having some invisible alarm tripped and showing up any moment, whereas Severus had all but openly endorsed their Slytherin festivities. So he cast Sanguirenere, nowhere near drunk enough to mess that up, at least not yet, and conjured him and Theo green and silver cushions, and seats rather like Muggle bean bag chairs, along with bluebell flames above he happily tinted green with Colovaria. Then he slumped into his pouf beside Theo and took the sake, giving it a sniff. "Since when are you a sake person, Theo?"
Draco was standing next to Potter's four-poster and slowly took off the Invisibility Cloak. It had been the best thing to hide under during the day, present but not there for anyone to speak to. He had walked the corridors, sat in the Slytherin common room sofas, listening. He was grateful that Potter had let him have it, but now he had come to give it back.
"Exposing people's hidden desires, removing emotional barriers, what's the fun in that?" Hermione furrowed her brow and pushed a large glass of pumpkin juice to the side.
"You shouldn't just mix potions," Neville said solemnly. "That's not real research, it's only tampering. I'm sure that's not what Slughorn meant when he told us to seek new uses for existing potions. You don't know what the effect might be."
Malfoy gave Adam a murderous look, but Harry missed that, deep in his own soggy thoughts as he was.
"Well, it had a certain Malfoyish tone to it. Ron thought Ginny had sent it at the time, but I don't think it was her. I don't think it's her now, either."
Malfoy pressed passed him with a huff and flung open the door on the other side of the corridor. "And this is your bedroom?"
"Hardly, but mother made her see the benefits of being surrounded by dead pure-bloods instead of being forced to live there with you. In the end, she agreed to be moved. No one could have done it except my mother, someone of her own family."
Harry blushed  and tried to hide it behind the rim of his cup. "I wouldn't know what to do with a man," he mumbled.
"I'll make some tea," Harry said and hurried downstairs to the kitchen. It too was dark and with no fire in the hearth Harry heated two cups of water with his wand and placed them on the table together with a plate of Molly's gingersnaps.
"What would you like to do instead, then?" Andromeda asked.
Obviously, he can't go alone," Harry said to Weasley.
"Ah, yes, of course, the mysterious potion," Malfoy smirked, then his face turned serious. He let his gaze wander and huffed a sigh. "Look," he said in a clipped tone, "if you were curious, if you just wanted to blow off some steam, it's understandable. But you could have said so, instead of blabbering about how you longed for me, how my hair smelled and my skin felt."
Draco halted and put his hand on Harry's arm to stop him too. "I've had so many conflicting emotions when it comes to you, and when you turned up, years later, with this absurd request of having my baby, I didn't know what to think. I decided to just go for it, see what would happen, and miraculously, you seemed to like me too." He sighed and ran his hands over his hair. "But honestly, is it enough? We're both stubborn as erumpents, and while you're impulsive, rash and hot, I can mope around like a wounded queen for days, weeks if you're unlucky. You know I can, you've seen it happen."
"She'll be here soon," she said a little sharply and turned back to the work bench. He could sense by the way she kneaded the dough that further inquiring about Ginny was unwise at the moment. Harry always felt he'd let her down when he and Ginny broke up and it was quite clear that she hadn't really forgiven him. Harry changed the topic. "What about Teddy and Andromeda, then?"
At the trials after the war, when every feeling was still raw, Harry had watched him walk into the Wizengamot courtroom, supporting his trembling mother, and their eyes had met, and for the first time those grey eyes weren't hidden behind a mask. An honest face was turned up to him and something clicked inside of Harry and he knew what he had to do.
She huffed and cast a few other diagnostics, not that she believed them to reveal anything, but just in case. "Any other symptoms I should know about, Mr Potter?"
"Zabini," Harry said and shook his hand. Zabini raised a curious eyebrow. Harry turned to the third man. He seemed vaguely familiar. "Marcus Flint?"
Potter sat up, searching his face. "It can come in handy, sometimes." He hesitated a little. "Would you like to stay for a while?"
"Well," Draco tugged Harry's hand closer and graced his teeth over the knuckles. "Ravenclaws has stress-relief sex to improve their grades. Hufflepuffs does everything in group, nobody's left out. We Slytherins pride ourselves with having calculated relations, always looking at what a person could gain from the date. Guess what the Gryffindors are famous of?"
"I'm not sure," she bit her lip, "but I think we've got some serious damage-control to take care of in your dorm."
Rage flared and Harry sat up promptly. "We most certainly will not," he shouted. The nerve of that troublemaker!
Harry closed in on him. He waddled by now but he tried to get as much of his Auror authority in his steps as possible. "Because, I have to point out a few things to you. First of all, your mother is currently on her way out of this house for the first time in, what I recon, a decade."
"Minerva. Molly." She nodded at the two other witches.
Harry crossed the street with a bag of steaming
Ron sat with his arm slung over Hermione's shoulder and his nose buried in her bushy hair. He greeted Harry with a goofy grin.
"What's this?" Draco held up a stack of something suspicious on a plate.
Harry groaned, "Oh God," and buried his face at her shoulder. She patted his hair and placed a sisterly kiss on the top of his head. "You could give it a try," she said. "Ask him out on a date, at least."
I dashed into the bedroom and rapidly changed my clothes.
charm?"
Cheers and handclaps were heard. "Anyone else wanna try?" Seamus called out.
"Potter." Harry heard an unfamiliar drawl and turned to the three men that entered the hall. The darkskinned man at Draco's side extended his hand. "How in Salazar's name were you able to Apparate directly into the house? I thought the wards around this place were impenetrable."
"Uhm," he started, stalling a bit, "how are you these days?"
Malfoy winced and continued after a pause, "So, is this your idea of us becoming friends, Potter?" He looked down on Harry along his pointy nose. He was annoyingly taller.
Weasley shuddered his shoulders. "Muggle expression. When something is very obvious but not talked about. Like the fact that you've slept in Harry's bed, naked."
Draco cringed, and Harry removed his hand instantly and looked away. But Draco was fast and caught his hand again. "No, no, don't get me wrong, it's the
Harry turned and gave her a reassuring smile. The tomato-sauce simmered in the pan, sending appetizing whiffs of basil and white wine. Harry grinded the pecorino and tipped it over the tomatoes. "It's fine. You go and have a great time. I'll owl Ron or some of the others. It's been ages since we had a night at the Pub." He stirred the spagetti again and checked the timer on his wand. "This is ready. Let's eat."
She put the cardboard boxes down in front of them. The rich smell of curry immediatly filled the room and Harry felt his stomach ache of hunger.
"Bullshit!" Zabini snickered. "You love dancing, you always dance. Go on." He gave them both a little push. "Dance with Potter here, teach him your moves."
"It's been fifteen years since you and Mum got divorced, and since you left the Aurors you hardly ever leave the house. You've got to go out once in a while, Dad." There was a sad streak in Al's voice. Had it really been that long since he and Ginny split up?
thinking about the mistakes I've made? You had to make me a laughingstock as well?"
He locked the office door and pushed the button to the lift. "Do you live with someone?" he asked while they were waiting. "I don't think you should be alone."
"Oh, Master!" Kreacher clapped his knobbly hands together in delight and his face contorted into what Harry was afraid was an attempt to smile. "Such wonderful news. What a treat, what a treat!" he exclaimed and begun bouncing up and down.
"Good. Take it now."
Harry squirmed. Malfoy was right, he'd made a scene after their last encounter. He had yelled and threatened, all because guilt and shame had ripped through him as he came down from the high. He had sworn he'd never set foot there again.
A sky-larch darted up in front of them and started chirping its warning song, soring high up in the air. "Let's go back," Draco said. "We'll have tea in the Winter-garden with my mother and I don't want to make her wait." He put his arm around Harry's waist, slightly stroking a thumb over the small swell at the side of Harry's tummy. "And we'll tell her about the baby."
It had been a mistake to bring the good claret from the Manor's wine-cellar. It was far too nice and smooth and ran down your throat so easily that you completely forgot the amount of alcohol it contained, and how it numbed your inhibitions.
Draco looked at Potter's body. This was nothing like the soft bulge over Gregory Goyle's waistband. Potter's belly was small but taught and protruded firmly from his skinny frame. He really ought to eat more, Draco could see the outline of his ribcage.
"Don't be. I ... liked it. I said so, didn't I."
"This is much better," Malfoy said and reclined in a plush brown leather chair. A blond girl in a black apron appeared. "What can I get you gentlemen?"
He attacked Harry's lips and neck with a fever he'd never known he had in him. He completely lost control. He latched on to Harry's mouth and pressed him down with the weight of his body, grinding the bulge in his trousers against Harry's, his hands fluttering everywhere over Harry's body. Draco could hear himself moan and whimper as he finally got to devour, to taste, to...
to conceal his feelings? Draco kept his eyes on the cauldron and continued stirring the potion alternately clockwise and anti-clockwise.
"Look at his arm, Neville."
"So, you know who your soulmate is?"
"Sure, that's fantastic for you, Gin. Lily and I'll be alright." Harry put the spagetti in the pot of boiling water. He liked to cook the Muggle way. It was familiar and he could lose himself in the calming monotomy of chopping and stirring. It helped him relax.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows. "Then, do tell me your number two," he smiled.
Draco remained silent and hid his face in the crook of Harry's neck.
"So," Malfoy said.
"Then there is the question of Draco Lucius Malfoy, son of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. Marked as a Death Eater, but according to his own statement, it was forced on him against his will, under threats from the Dark Lord Voldemort of hurting his family. Draco Malfoy was also underage at the time and should therefore not be held responsible for this. Furthermore, according to another testimony given by Harry James Potter, Draco Malfoy saved Mr Potter's life when he refused to identifiy Mr Potter and give him up to the Dark Lord Voldemort. Draco Malfoy surrendered his wand and aided Mr Potter in his escape from Malfoy Manor, where Mr Potter was held prisoner, and according to Mr Potter, thus changed the outcome of the war. If there is anyone in this jury who see fit to send this young man to a sentence in Azkaban, please, raise your hands."
"Now you understand why I don't want my children anywhere near this place with her still here," Harry said, and raked his fingers through his hair, making it even more tousled. He had just called Malfoy his friend and felt a little awkward about it.
"A rainbow-coloured Muggle bar?" Malfoy's eyebrows preformed a little dance on his brow.
"Have to. As if you only worked office hours when you were out in the field." Draco pulled up his trousers and buckled his belt. "I have too much to do."
"I think… I'm not... something's wrong."
Harry started protesting but Draco shut him up. "Think about it, there are thing about the bloodlines that's inexplicably connected with the magical cores and could be lost if there were no purebloods left. My ability to get you pregnant is only one of them." He held his hands up in defence. "I'm not saying we're better than half-bloods or Muggle-borns. That was the believes of my father and what I was taught when I was a child. I've learned better."
Harry turned and gave him a curious look. "Is that how you grew up? I thought you were close to your parents?"
"Stop saying you're sorry. What is there to be sorry for?" Hermione reprimanded.
She finally met my eyes and smirked. "I thought you didn't care?"
"Me?" He felt all air leave his lungs.
The smile that he had on his lips died away as soon as the small figure had disappeared. He was not at all confident that Draco would come with him. This might not work at all.
"Don't worry, she's in good hands." Harry tried to put his hand on his arm for comfort, but Draco shoved it off. "Her sister is with her and Pipsey, who let me in, by the way. They should've arrived at the Burrow by now, where Molly and Arthur will make sure she's properly taken care of."
"Potter," Malfoy hissed out of ear-shot of Adam, "you're one of the richest wizards I know. I'm sure you can afford it."
"What the bloody hell is that supposed to mean?"
Malfoy shrugged a shoulder. "All Malfoy first-borns are male; we're forever spelled that way."
Brilliant, Harry thought, a fit gay dictor, who apparently had the impression Harry wanted to go through with this pregnancy. He regretted he'd let Ron and Hermione wait outside; he could've used their support right now. Harry thought he'd never been in a more embarrassing situation.
"Shit, my mother." Draco raked his fingers through his hair, getting it more tangled than Harry had ever seen, even in bed. "How on earth did you manage that?"
Malfoy had stumbled out of the Floo late last night, dead tired and mumbled something about 'slaughter the yearlings', but Harry couldn't make any sense of it. He was, after all, still on sick-leave and even if Malfoy was involved in some fucked up Dark Art sacrificial ritual, he'd deal with it later. For now, he only wanted to watch him.
"What do you take me for? Some cave-troll?"
Malfoy gave a short humouless laugh. "You see, I'm all that's left of our once so glorious Slytherin gang." There was a strained set at his jaw.
Draco swallowed hard. He was very conscious about his body, not that it was anything wrong with it, it was just that...
means something to you." He leaned over and put both his hands on Harry's knees. "You have to bloody talk to him, mate. Find out what he thinks, what he wants, instead of making all these crappy assumptions," he said resolutely. "For what it's worth, Harry, we all think you deserve some happiness."
There was something etherial, almost Veela-like over the way he moved. The stoboscope-light that pulsed behind him made it hypnotic to watch. His white-blond hair flicked over his eyes with each jerk of the neck, his hips swivelled and rotated. He had pulled the sleeves up over the elbows and thrown his hands up in the air. Against the pale skin the bluish mark on his arm stood out, dark and ugly, marring the perfection of this breathtakingly beautiful man, making him real and human. Harry gasped and felt his cock swell in his pants.
Luna was sitting with Goyle's hand in her lap, drawing lines and patterns with her index-finger at his palm. Harry couldn't hear what she was saying, but he could see her lips move constantly. The look at Goyle's face almost made him laugh. He was totally lost.
"We take things slow, get to know eachother, find trust. I'm in no hurry."
Harry looked at his newly purchased mobile in disbelief after disconnecting the call. What a strange place to suggest for a meeting, from Malfoy, anyway. "See you at the stairs of British Museum, Friday afternoon. Shall we say four?" was what Malfoy had said.
"Well, I sort of changed my mind." Harry squirmed in his seat and looked into Molly's kind brown eyes. He felt his throat clench and burn. "There's going to be a baby," he croaked.
He paused and took a brief look at the stack of papers on his desk. "I can see here that you work as an Auror, Mr Potter."
"Naturally," Malfoy scoffed and followed. "Pureblood children are brought up by house-elves as far away from their parents as possible, until they come of an age where they've learned how to behave with decorum."
Harry looked at the boy in his arms and something cramped in his chest. Malfoy seemed so at ease, so unguarded and relaxed. It made Harry feel like a freud, a fake. Panic rose like bile in his throat.
Harry shrugged. "I guess."
He'd had fantasies, but that was all. Very vague and very indistinct fantasies that he'd never dared examine closley in the light of day. He had a girlfriend, even if they weren't intimate anymore, not since this summer. After a long and horrible year of war and losses, Harry only wanted to be like any other normal teenage-boy, but the awkward fumblings with Ginny out in the field behind the Burrow, had made Harry feel anything but.
"Nobody speaks in those terms anymore, Draco. The rivalry among the Houses is in the past." Blaise paused. "You know I'm seeing a Ravenclaw-girl, right?"
"No, ma'am, that would be my father," Malfoy answered politely. "I'm Draco."
"You ought to see a Healer," he said. "Shall I take you to St Mungo's?"
Harry shook his head.
He had made wonders with the neglected garden at the back of the old house at Grimmauld Place over the years, and he liked doing it mostly by hand, the Muggle way. He'd once been told that some things were worth taking its time, and he had to agree. It was more satisfying and calming this way, like cooking and cleaning, the way he'd learned it as a child. He guessed he had something to thank Aunt Petunia for in the end. Though, she'd be appalled to know he was using dragon-manure.
Draco bit his lip. " You might have closed the Floo to me."
"I don't think it would have worked," Potter said and shook his head. "You have to mean them, you know, and I don't think you did at the time."
"Isn't that what you wanted?"
"I have a couple of new dress robes for special occasions," Harry shrugged. "I'm in uniform most of the day, anyway. The rest of the time I like feeling comfortable."
Ginny nodded. Harry could see the determination, that she'd made up her mind. "I love you, Harry," she said. "I'll always do." She stood, bent down and kissed him on the forehead, just shy of his lightning-bolt scar. "I'll love you as I love all my brothers," she added.
Harry continued, reluctantly at this point. "Healer Smith told me that for this to work, there are a few other things that needs to be fulfilled, though. The other father must be someone I have a connection to. Not necessary a romantic one, thank God, but a close friend, someone I'm tied to, bonded with... maybe someone I have a life-debt to..." Harry paused. "And it's absolutely essential that he's a pureblood wizard, so I thought I'd ask you."
"No," Harry shook his head vigorously, rubbing his head on her hair on the pillow. "It was more like... the other way around. I think I begged and wanted him to... you know."
Minutes before, the door to the Pub had opened and a group of Slytherins had entered and joined some Housemates at a nearby table, among them a tall blond boy.
My throat clenched but I pressed out, "Would you mind very much if I tried it with you?"
"I want to get rid of it," she said. "I want to play Quidditch, not let another baby suck the life out of me one more time."
"Yeah, I'm sure," Harry beamed. "And now that you're here, stay for dinner. You've still to meet my second son, Albus, who's hopfully not as hostile as his older brother. I'm making Spagetti Carbonara and it will be frightfully messy, I'm afraid, but I very much like you to stay. And another thing," Harry looked slightly embarrassed, "can I call you Draco? It's a bit awkward introducing you as my old friend and still call you by your surname."
Malfoy held out a scunched-up scroll and read aloud. "
"You do understand, Mr Potter, that you will not be able to use your magic during the pregnancy. As soon as there been conception, and that is bound to happen at once due to the potion you'll be taking, the womb must be created, and that is depending on the strenth of your magic alone. We can only hope that it is strong enough, but if it isn't, there's nothing we can do about it. This is a chance we're taking, but the prospects are very good, considering your magical status."
"I'm on the look for a new play-mate. Interested? Total discretion, of course. You were so irresistibly pliant that night, it gave me all sorts of yummy suggestions."
"Indulge me," Malfoy said and pouted. He made a gesture around the grand old room. "We never get to use this room anymore, it's really a shame."
His pale eyelashes formed perfect half-circles on the sharp cheekbones, and they fluttered a little as he heaved long even breaths. He didn't exactly snore, but a small sound came out with every puff of breath. The blond hair, almost white in the shadowed room, had fallen forward in front of his face. Sleep created a softness to him that he hid so well when awake, behind that mask of sneers and loftiness. He was truly beautiful.
She fussed and wiped his face. "Very well, if you say so. But I still have to report this to the Headmistress. Now, lay down on the cot. I'll check on you within the hour."
Draco clutched his hands on the back frame of the wooden chair and dared to meet Potter's gaze. "Well, she was on the spot, so to speak. I very much like to stay, though, if you want me to."
"Can't you stop calling me that? We've been together, sort of, for almost a year, and in a couple of very short months we're going to be parents. I'm Harry."
"I'm allowed to dance, just like everyone else."
Harry went red as a beetroot. "I just can't." He lifted his head and met his friend's eyes. She took his hand in hers.
spend a lot of time here, he realized. The toddler at Ron's knee squirmed and sulked. Harry felt bad for arriving so late and wake everybody up. But he had promised Malfoy.
Harry swallowed. What could he say? That the sight of Malfoy made his blood burn in ways nothing else did?
"Ever dated a wizard?" Malfoy had a smug look on his face.
"Excellent," Harry grinned and put a steaming pot on the table. "I hope you'll stay and eat with me. At least that would give you something for your trouble."
in his hand and Malfoy in tow.
Malfoy bit his lip. "I'm not that familiar with where Muggles go dancing around here."
Harry shrugged.
0o0o0o0o
"Just trust me for once, will you?" Malfoy said and then his lips descended on that spot and his hand gripped Harry's semi-hard shaft, and Harry gasped and bucked up to meet him.
She yanked Seamus off his seat and dragged him up the staircase to the third floor. Ron and Neville started to frogmarch Harry out of the Hall, up the to the first landing, down the corridor leading to Gryffindor Tower, when Harry suddenly sprang to life. He squirmed and resisted, and clearly had no intention to follow them in that direction.
Lucius let his head fall on the wet soggy page and sobbed. He wasn't at all sure if it was from relief or despair.
Harry's mouth went completely dry and he rubbed the back of his neck. He felt sheepish and awkward and hot all over.
Draco rapidly turned his head and met the most intense green eyes in the world. They even sparkled when sleepy.
After Harry had left Molly in the kitchen, slightly sobbing but with a happy smile on her face, he went into the sitting room, hugged everybody there and admired the tree. They were soon joined by the three men from the garden-shed, who smelled suspiciously of whiskey this early on Christmas Eve, and a newly awaken Charlie emerged from upstairs, dark circles under his eyes, but with a wide grin at Harry as usual.
"I don't know how to begin to tell you how disappointed I am of the two of you," she said and tied the sash tighter on her tartan dressing gown. "As figures of leadership in your respective Houses," she held up her hand to stop Harry from protesting, "well, you are, there's no point in arguing that. I thought what happened last year should put a stop to all this rivalry nonsense between you, that you finally could act your age and put all that behind you. You're adult wizards now, even if you're still at school. You have the responsibility and the ability to make a difference. Your experiences in the war must have shown you how far animosity can get, and I'm not talking about losing House-points." She paused and somehow seemed to deflate as she exhaled.
He sobbed harder.
It was incredible, thought Draco, how he could simplify things. Because that was the crux of it, wasn't it? Draco wasn't sure what he wanted.
Theo, I need the truth."
He shook his head to release the Nargles, and settled down to write again.
Draco might have laughed it off and gone back to join the others, until Theo pulled him over and held up the sake to show him. It was a large silver bottle, rounded and heavy at the bottom, with a dragon design stenciled in black over the body of it, and words over the katakana that read Kikokuryu Silver Dragon. "Can you deny," Theo laughed, unusually playful, "That this is sake meant for you, Astaroth?" and Draco laughed and followed him as he led to the doors to the Potions storerooms. "You can get in, right? And no one else. So we can have this all to ourselves."
he penned. Dear Sirius and Remus what? I'm going crazy? I'm turning into Bellatrix? I want Harry to burn me at the stake?
The other boy was clearly uncomfortable, deep blue gaze tracing the creases in the cloth of Draco's duvet. "I can't believe you remember that. The truth. Are you sure? Just because I say something- my point of view isn't-"
"Yes," Draco answered, pulling his face back from Theo's, and their eyes met, tension as sharp as the moonstone dagger in the innermost pocket of Draco's hoodie, under the word Kingsnakes. He was suddenly aware exactly of where it was, along with his wand in the other pocket. "Yes, of course- of course I am. What would be the point, lying about that for so-"
"Maybe I should have. But I can't throw everything away to run after you. If you reject me for
"For better or for worse," Draco murmured, "it rings uncomfortably true."
"I can't see him," whined Draco, panic rising. "I can't! Please, please will you-"
Harry like a- like a surrogate parent, because he can't fight for an ideal, he can only fight for
Severus surveyed him, eyes dark, but never pitying. Thankfully, never that. "In that case, I do believe there's a non-trivial chance you may fall into your aunt's destructive patterns. Tell me clearly, Draco- do you love Potter for who he is, or for what he represents? Would you fall at his feet? Bow and scrape, if he asked you to? Could you sublimate yourself entirely to him?"
" his lip curled- "I'll want a life to return to."
"It's really warming them," Theo marveled, "I thought you just had blood all over your nails or some poison or something," and earned a dirty look from Draco. "No, that's really cool! And the nails look ho- well, they look nice on you..."
"To you, he's like the supporting cast in your own story, someone who's less able to make his own decisions, so he needs you to do it for him. That's why you always remind him that you do dark rituals, you're a murderer, et cetera. You don't think he has the agency to understand what you've done and choose you anyway."
"We've always known that," replied Hermione, sympathetic. "Tell yourself you're a good person. Because you are. You've done so much for Harry, Sirius, Remus, Luna, me-" She flapped her hands, encompassing the empty room. "Everyone. But the only person that can tell you that effectively is yourself."
"You are! You're
"I- no, it's not that-"
"Merlin," he breathes, eyes troubled. "We're really at war now, aren't we?"
"...Yes."
It was never going to happen, was it. Between both timelines, Draco had spent three and a half decades thinking of Harry as an idol. It would never work. Harry turned him into a- a narcissist, an overconfident, violent, fanatical person. His insanity wasn't just the talon wand.
"I said it in the cruelest possible way, and I'm sorry. If you do want to change, I believe you can. You're incredible, Draco, and you'll accomplish whatever you set your mind to."
risk it."
"Draco..." Theo leaned forward, handsomeness accentuated by the unusual passion that animated it. "Grindelwald, I've tried to pretend... I've tried so hard, but I can't lie to myself anymore..." His lips came forward and pressed a clumsy kiss to Draco's forehead, then the side of his head, nuzzling into his hair not unlike Harry always did, although the alcohol on his breath was the strongest scent. Something wary squirmed in Draco's stomach. "Are you really gay like you've always said?"
"Mills, I, I don't even know how to explain what's happening to me. I talked to Hermione, and Luna, and I feel like I'm going insane."
"Are you afraid for Harry? He can protect himself."
"Stop," Draco said, pulling his hand away and nearly upsetting the empty sake. "Theo, don't. Don't put yourself through this. This isn't going to end well for you-"
down here, looking for you?"
"Harry," he said. "
That wasn't fair to Theo, then, the boy who kept his secrets, the only person in the castle save Severus who could calm him from his wand-induced rages. The boy who was just like him, raised a Death Eater, but nothing like him, without foreknowledge of what would happen. Was it fair to blame him for trying to pick the winning side, based on his own knowledge? Was it fair to blame him for blue-loop Theo's actions, a Theo Draco hadn't been as close to until they began having sex, a Theo who'd have never agreed to talk to Mudbloods and Gryffindors, a Theo who wouldn't work so hard to help Draco. Draco confronted the uncomfortable truth, then- he'd walked into a new reality, but he was still judging everyone off the old one. Including himself.
They locked the bed curtains and discussed Dobby, Severus, the mirror, and finally, Harry. "Merlin," began Hermione, shaken. "I see now what you meant- what you were trying to tell Harry. His rendition of the argument was hopelessly confused. You're afraid of becoming your aunt."
"Insolent boy," he grumbled. "Yes, I am. What do you wish to speak to me about?"
"I don't know what you mean! What are you even talking about? You're nothing like your aunt!"
"Yes."
"I like you," Theo insisted, taking a deep breath, and then leaned forward and tried to kiss Draco.
"Expelliarmus!" a deep voice yelled, and Draco's wand flew away from him. Severus stood above the two drunken fifth-years, a foreboding figure in his long black nightshirt. He knew better than to pick up Draco's wand, which had sailed to his bare feet. He stepped over it, and went over to Theo with a frown. "Relashio," he cast, "Finite incantatem," and the invisible bonds on Theo's wrists loosened, before he turned to Draco murderously. "Draco, what is the meaning of this?"
Draco let out a harsh bark of laughter at that. "You love me?" he echoed, a world of woundedness he had thought buried roaring back to life. What he would have given to hear those words come out of Theo's mouth in the blue loop. They could have changed so much. What he would have given to have Theo act like he even cared in sixth year, when he was so alone and Myrtle was still the only one who could talk to- Theo had just wanted to stick his prick in him and run-
"He sees my- my rage, but he doesn't understand it. He thinks it's, it's okay? Positive, maybe? But I'm afraid of it, and I know Hermione is, too, she sees it, she understands..."
Harry suddenly felt very cold and alone. "Malfoy!" he sat up and called after him. "Can you come back later? Tonight?"
"What makes you so sure it will be a boy?" Harry asked, taken a little aback.
Potter shook his head. "Not if we're doing this, not if we're... lovers. Besides, you've called me Harry before."
"You shouldn't." Malfoy glared a little and sighed. "But the things I did, the consequences it had, it's something I have to live with for the rest of my life, so I better get used talking about it. Especially to someone like you."
"Of course, I love him. He's the best friend I have." She straightened up and tilted her head back a little so she could meet his eyes. "If you think, Neville Longbottom, that it was news to me that Draco's arse over tits for Harry Potter, then think again. It's been the worst kept secret in Slytherin since fourth year. I'm so happy for him I think I burst."
"To the Manor?" Harry didn't know how he could deal with that, not even after all this time. The thought alone made his palate dry and his hands clammy.
"Easy for you to say," Harry snapped and tensed up even more. "You're the one who's getting to have all the fun."
He walked over to the door down the corridor, turned and looked at Harry before he entered. Harry gave a sigh and followed. Of course, he followed.
Harry snapped his head up. "You're leaving? Why?"
Boy was he wrong.
Draco hesitated, but only for a moment. Then he sneaked his hand out and put it on Potter's flat, toned, slightly hairy stomach. "Show me."
"Whatever you say, Harry." He exhaled. "I only hope you're not doing something you'll regret later, that's all. Because, once the baby's born, there's no way to back out."
0o0o0o0o
They continued up another floor. Here was the room Harry had chosen for his own bedroom, the only one with new paint, and the connecting bathroom was also finished with new tiles.
Harry let out a breath he didn't know he'd held and sunk down on the chair at the kitchen table.
Draco looked a little thoughtful and bit his lip. "You know that this soulmate thing isn't the answer to everything. That we will have our problems, like everyone else has."
She paused. "What's the matter with you? You skip classes, you're not sitting with us in the common room anymore and you've been a far more than a little distracted lately." She bit her lip. "Look, Harry, if you're seeing someone else…"
Ron gave Neville a scared look. He wasn't sure Neville knew exactly where in the dungeons they were, but Ron and Harry had been here before.
"Do you want me to go harder and faster?"
"Go, deal with the culprits. We'll manage somehow, Lily and I."
Harry rested his sweaty brow on the cold porcelain rim of the toilet seat. It was far from clean and not nice at all, but it still felt good. Besides, he couldn't
Ginny bit her lip. "But that's just the thing, I promised her she could spend the night at her friend Suzy's. You know how she's been nagging us about that. You'd be on your own."
He got up and in one swift move he went down on his knees in front of Harry, pushing Harry's legs wider apart. Harry made a sound, high-pitched and needy, in the back of his throat. His hands trembled as they moved of their own accord and opened the button and pulled down the zipper of his jeans. Harry's cock was now fully erect and strained at the containments of his underpants. Malfoy held his head very close and ghosted his warm breath over it. Harry bit his lip to hold back a moan but rolled his hips a little.
"Nobody thought it could be mended. It was pretty amazing when it was." He smiled.
had met Justin Finch-Fletchley, who had accidently stumbled across Malfoy last month."
"You still dream about Him?" Malfoy asked quietly.
Malfoy evaluated Harry silently for a long time. "This is a bit unexpected and I don't know what to think," he said very slowly, taking a sip of his wine. "But let's play a game. I tell you three things about myself, that I think you don't know, and then you tell me three. If I find what you say the least intriguing, I'll take you out on a real date. Agreed?"
"How are you feeling? Are you all right?" Draco's brows knotted into what Harry had come to recognize as his 'worried-frown'.
The wine was golden, cold and served in an ice-bucket. It tasted quite nice. Harry relaxed a little. Malfoy looked as if he was in his right element. Harry scoffed at him when he twirled the high-stemmed glass between his fingers, held it up to the light and took a miniature sip. The wanker.
Harry tried to concentrate to get work done, but he felt uneasy and restless. After his fourth turn to the loo and his third cup of tea, he decided that it was no use. "I'm not feeling well, probably coming up with a cold or something," he informed the group of Aurors that remained in the office. "I'll go home for the rest of the day."
"Sweet Salazar! That will take some time to get inhabitable."
Harry wanted to protest but found his mouth had gone completely dry and he couldn't get a word out. "Erm," was all he managed.
"It wasn't fucking fireworks, okey. If it'd been, I wouldn't be sitting here on your sofa, alone, now would I?" Harry lowered his voice. "I wouldn't be in this bloody mess." He sighed.
a long time ago, Ron, and he was cleared of all charges, being underage. He was a child then, same as us. Lucius is in Azkaban where he belongs, and will no doubt never see daylight again, and what I've heard, his mother's not well. It's not fair how he's been treated over the years."
"Well, you owe me, that's for sure," she snorted, "going all Slytherin on me like that. How come Ginny Weasley looks the way she does, and she had three? It's not fair."
He took a small sip from his glass.
"I like being with him," Harry said tentatively.
Malfoy snorted, turned around and plunked down in one of the recliners, all stainless steel and charcoal leather. Harry carefully tried out the other and found it surprisingly comfortable.
He stopped at Harry's desk and put his clenched knuckles down in front of Harry and met his gaze. He was quite impressive in his Auror-uniform, with his stature. "You could've had any of us, you know that. I mean, Charlie's not likely to have any of his own. I bet he would love to father a child with you."
I've seen many more of Draco's shows since then. He still plays the sad songs, because they're popular and people request them, but there are others now. Newer. Happier. I like those, but I secretly prefer the old ones. They remind me, how precious what I now have, is. That, I never want to forget.
Potter!
They finally cought up with him in the dungeons. Ron put up his hand to stop Neville, who came rushing after him, out of breath and panting heavily. They had to run for quite a bit, Harry being surprisingly fast, and they'd lost track of him more than once.
The bed was narrow for three people. Hermione could've easily enlarged it with a simple spell, but she chose not to. She rather liked the way they were forced close together, like a litter of pups. This wasn't the first time they'd shared a bed like this. Sometimes, during those long months on the run, being pressed between these two boys, with their warm bodies, listening to their breathing, feeling their hearts beating, was the only thing Hermione felt could keep her sane in a world that scared her so much she almost lost the ability to function. She loved them both; differently, but just as strong.
"The address on the card isn't valid anymore," she said. "But I wrote the new one down at the back."
"Who're you?" The little boy, who was sitting at the big table, glared angrily at the tall man who took an insecure step after coming through the flames at the hearth of Harry's kitchen.
"Merlin's beard, Potter, are you all right?" Malfoy kneeled beside him, supporting Harry's head with his hands.
"Oh no, I managed to rattle up some old Slytherins too. Goyle will be there. I went back to Hogwarts to properly thank him for saving my arse, and he was in contact with Zabini and Nott. I belive Parkinson and Bulstrode also came."
"Yeah, whatever."
Malfoy scrunched up his nose as if disgusted by the thought. "What about the house-elves?"
"Look, Malfoy," Harry said, suddenly angry. "If you think this is some hilarious joke, go ahead, laugh. My life is
"S' water!" Harry spit out. "I want a Fire-whiskey."
"I can't see why you're so worked up on the idea about Harry and Malfoy," Ron said with a dark glance at his wife. "I mean, it's still Malfoy. And we don't really know if it was the Identification potion in the first place. Maybe Harry just fainted from being tired, maybe it was bad Indian curry. It could be a hundred different answers and now you're playing Matchmaker for our best friend, trying to set him up with a man we know absolutely
"Well, that should cover everything. I'm sure it will be all right tomorrow." Malfoy stacked all the papers together and Harry rose from his chair and streched, a little stiff after so many hours.
Malfoy followed.
"Oh, Ginny!" Harry reached out and covered her hand in his over the tabletop. "I made you so unhappy, when all I wanted was to be a good husband to you, to be your friend."
"Malfoy. Do you like him?"
Harry swallowed. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean… I didn't think..."
He went back to the table again and read the parchment. The name of a Mind-Healer. Hermione had insisted he took it as he left them tonight. "She is the best, Harry. I've made inquiries…" she put her hand on his chest to stop his protest, "discrete inquires, and everyone I talk to tells me the same. Send her an owl, Harry. You can't go on like this, you're barely living."
"Why does he stay with her, then?"
"Thank God," Hermione sighed.
Potter nodded. He slung his arm around Draco's neck and pulled him closer. Their breaths mingled and the frame of Potter's glasses felt sharp against his cheek, but Draco didn't care. He wanted it to hurt, to feel real. He pressed even closer and covered Potter's mouth with his own, pushed his tongue inside, ran it over Potter's teeth, explored every inch of that smooth cavity.
"Wow, Harry," Ginny said and leaned back against her seat. "This is bizarre in so many ways. I didn't even know you were into blokes."
"So, you're a family man, then?"
"No wine this time?" Harry had to ask.
"Right, right, it's only a bit of fun."
He needed to feel Malfoy's skin; that smooth pale skin that had haunted his dreams for days now. He wanted to press his body against it, and so he tugged and yanked until they were both free from their shirts. Harry gulped. There was a long deep scar across Malfoy's chest, disfiguring his, in all other aspects, perfect torso. The
His mother had been right, he was getting himself into trouble, but he didn't want to go back to that vast empty Manor, with all its horrid memories. He had stayed there far too long, hiding there, in a way, in the few rooms that had been his own, never in the rest of the house. He couldn't bring himself to live in the parts of the house that were connected to the Dark Lord and his followers.
It was after the game, right outside the Quidditch pitch, where he lost his temper and shoved him fiercly up against the side of the shed. They weren't even supposed to be playing Quidditch anymore, being eight-teen and considered adults, but Harry couldn't imagine going to Hogwarts without being able to play, so he had begged the Headmistress, and in the end she reluctantly agreed, that all 8th-years could play, if they wanted, but no one asked to, except Harry and Malfoy.
The silence stretched out in what felt like eons, but he kept his hand in mine and his gaze was steady.
"It wasn't the same after everything was over. Ginny… well, she wanted to move on, leave it all behind and... live, I guess. It wasn't that easy for me," Hary mumbled.
Over the bustle in the room a voice suddenly carried. "Just put the damned shirt on, Draco. We all know you're bent, anyway."
"And how is darling Draco these days, then? Zabini smirked over the rim of his teacup.
"Who says I ran away?" Malfoy scowled.
"We've not been dating, merely spent time together, eating dinner, talking."
Harry closed his eyes. He felt Malfoy's hand, the long slim fingers steady pressure against the small of his back, the hip and the side of him turning Harry around and around. He started to feel lightheaded.
Harry sat down heavily on the trunk and chuckled quietly. He wondered what any of them would've said if they saw him now. He stretched his aching back and neck. The bending up and down today had been tiresome and he had felt a constant hum of discomfort all afternoon.
"Kissed a boy?"
Harry pushed his hands through his hair and tugged at it. "No, no, that's not what I meant. There
"Why this sudden interest in Draco and Astoria? You know, back in school, I used to have the feeling that someday… Oh, never mind. More tea?"
Neville shook his head. "Thanks, but I have students to attend to. There's probably a lot of upset children here, and as I am the Head of Gryffindor…" His cheeks flushed pink, but he shone with pride.
"We won't fit both of us, under that thing," he sneered. "Besides, you don't know the way."
"Didn't you know?" Hermione spun her head back at Harry. "He's been the caretaker here at Hogwarts since Filch finally retired six years ago."
This had caused a rather heated argument but ended with them all here in Gryffindor tower, watching the two well-matched players, both determined to crush one another. They had moved the small table with the chessboard right in front of the fireplace so the others could follow the game while they read or studied.
"Why not?"
"I'm sorry for all this trouble, professor, but there's something that I need to say." Harry talked slow and hesitant, and kept his gaze on Malfoy, who didn't move, though Harry could see his jaw-muscle clench. "Something I have to tell Malfoy, something important. I've tried, but as you can see Malfoy and I aren't that good at talking. What happened tonight was stupid and immature, and I don't think any of us wants to be like this anymore."
"Did Pipsey stay?"
The three girls flung down on the sofa and inhaled audially at the sight on the dancefloor.
"Miss Lily is filthy," the elf repeated. "Master must wipe clean. Towels of paper, at tableside."
to pound into something, bereft as it was of the mattress. "That's your prostate, Potter. Want me to touch it again?"
"I'm fine." Harry patted her arm and turned to Draco. "I'm all right, Draco, and I'm sorry."
"The same," the man showed a set of crooked teeth in what was supposed to be a hearty smile. "You can't imagine my surprise when my youngest owled us that he had sorted Slytherin together with the son of Harry Potter. I nearly fell off my chair." Flink chuckled. He had become a broad-chested man with an incipient beer-gut. Zabini looked just as lean and tall as he'd done at school.
"She says you're working a lot of overtime," he went on a little more tentatively. "I work at that department too, you know."
"Just leave it," Ron shouted over his shoulder. "Leave it and hurry."
"Don't you think we had enough of that last time?" Malfoy leaned in and his breath whiffed Harry's ear. "Apart from that, I have the ulterior motive of possibly get you in bed later, and I don't want you to be able to blame it on the wine afterwards." Harry felt his cheeks flush bright red, but Malfoy slid back into his chair and started to fill Harry's plate with the deliciously smelling hot food. Harry sighed with contentment when the aromas filled his nose. He could never turn down good food, not after being starved all those years.
"Did you know I was gay?" Malfoy's grey eyes pierced Harry's.
Malfoy came up to him. He stood right infront of Harry. He lifted his hand and pulled slightly at a stray lock of Harry's hair, then he removed Harry's glasses, folded them and put them inside the breast-pocket of Harry's plaid shirt. Malfoy's face was so near Harry could see it without squinting, but the rest of the room became a blur.
Draco locked Harry's eyes with his piercing grey and shook his head. "I can bitterly understand that." He chewed nervously on his lower lip, but straightened up and his voice became very formal. "Harry," he said, " I'm so sorry for what I did. I can assure you that nothing in your behaviour towards me gave me any reason to think that what I did was in any way desired by you too." He held up his hands to stop Harry from interrupting. "I'm so sorry," Draco continueed, much lower, "but with the risk of making a complete fool of myself here, and this is so un-Slytherin of me that I almost combust, I have to tell you. You have to know, that this wasn't some alcohol-indused lust. I'm in love with you. I've been in love with you for ages."
Harry retched again, getting rid of the last remains of his lunch. It's been like this for the last two weeks now, and Healer Smith said it was perfectly normal and could go on for another two months, maybe three.
"Why not?"
He was over me the next second, fumbling around after my semi-visible body, punching, scratching and tugging at my cloak and robes. Somehow he managed to straddle me, with me on my back, and I felt his hands on my bare skin where my clothes had rode up. They burned with a heat that overwhelmed me, and since I could hide in the fact that I was partly invisible, I yanked his shirt up and let my hands slide over that soft warm skin of his. He shivered and his grip on my waist got tighter. I moaned. And involuntarily, my hips shot up and grinded against his groin. He panted and pushed back. I freed my face from the cloak, and we rotted against each other until we both came with moans and whimpers. Then he quickly got up and headed down to his dorm entrance and I remained laying on the cold stone floor, trying to sort out what had happend. And that was the beginning of our many secret meetings in empty hallways and storage rooms.
Blaise drew a steadying breath. This party was the first attempt of interaction ever made by his House. The Slytherin students younger than seventeen had all been bribed with tons of treats from Honeydukes to stay in the dorms for the night, and the remaining witches and wizards, that were of age, had all chipped in to make the most of the evening. The latest Wierd Sister's hits was pouring out of the portable record-player, conjured lights glowed in every corner and created a soft atmosphere. There was a lot at stake tonight and the Hufflepuffs helped, bless their simple souls. He exchanged a brief look of relief with Pansy.
"If you like." Malfoy climbed up and sat on his knees beside Harry's legs. Harry looked around for his wand, but it had fallen out of his pocket as he undressed and lay far away from the bed. "Here, take mine," Malfoy said, before Harry has a chance to summon it and pulled out his own wand and gave it to Harry. "It used to work pretty well for you, as I recall." Harry gripped the hawthorn-wand, and the sudden intimacy of the gesture warmed Harry. He smiled at Malfoy, who was hovering right above him.
"That was taken right before we moved back. We've been living in the south of France with my mother for the most part until now, but I wanted him to attend Hogwarts, like all Malfoy men before him." He looked at Harry and winked. "Go to Hogwarts, sort Slytherin, marry a pureblood witch, have a son. That's what we do, we Malfoys."
I know, I know, I took a lot of the description of Draco's life at the Manor from one of my favourite TV-series, Downton Abbey, but I truly believe that their is much more to Malfoy Manor than a huge park with peacocks. And where does all that food at Hogwarts come from? Do they buy from Muggles? In such large quantities, un-noticed? I don't think so.
"Shut the fuck up, Blaise," Draco snarled through clenched teeth, "the boys might hear." He turned away and took a big gulp of his drink.
She walked away, back to the castle, her slim back very straight and her red ponytail bouncing at every step. Harry followed her with his eyes until she was gone. Then he turned and walked towards the lake.
"You knew?" Draco squirmed a little.
"YES!" they both said in unison.
Malfoy lounged back and held Harry's gaze. "Best days of my life. It would've been even better," he added sulkily, "if I'd actually caught the sodding thing, at least once, instead of you." He frowned and crossed his arms. "Now, tell me what you're doing instead of becoming the world's most famous Auror?"
"I can't believe I'm here," he muttered and faced the wall instead of Malfoy's searching gaze. "What the fuck am I doing here?"
"You had your hands on my shoulders," Potter continued. "Like this." His hands were warm and pressed Draco down on the mattress. The wight of his body upon Draco's made him involuntarily whimper. "Of course," Potter said hoarsely, "there were layers of clothes between us then. Nothing like this."
"Your time to ask, I reckon," Harry told Malfoy.
"And do you know what could have caused it?"
the smug bastard.
Harry hated these Ministry functions and this Halloween fundraising party was no exception. He found them boring first and foremost, and seeing people showing off their wealth and sucking up to those in a higher position, the Head-Auror included, got on his nerves.
"I'm still such a bloody coward, aren't I?"
This had given me plenty of time to think and to watch. And to wank behind severly shut and silenced bed-curtains to, shall we say, experimental images. But I had no desire to get into an argument about it, not with Hermione in the room.
Harry turned to Malfoy. "Draco, the baby moved."
"What shall I do with the broom?" Neville called after him.
"I think it's inevitable."
He Side-Alonged Harry to a secluded area right behind Oxford street. Harry looked around. "If I'm right, this is an all-Muggle part of London. Does this even count as a date?"
"I bet Malfoy hexed you," Ron muttered. "I'm not buying that 'I've changed' one bit."
Harry waved back at her, and then he let his gaze survey the rest of the students at their various House-tables and his eyes rested, as always, at the Slytherins. They were the smallest lot to return.
"Ah, but I'm not very liked as it is, am I?"
A shelf in the bookcase was crammed with pictures of a blond boy in various settings; as a baby in Narcissa Malfoy's arms, as a toddler on a beach pouring sand out of a bucket, with a tooth-less laugh on a toy-broom, with Malfoy, both grinnig widely at what seemed to be a Muggle fun-fair. There were no pictures of the dark-haired woman from Kings Cross.
"Yeah," Seamus countered. "This'll be fierce. Let's see what he'll do." He propped his elbows up and rested his chin in the palms of his hands, waiting impatiently, like for some rare entertainment to begin.
"Why can't he go, Harry?" Ginny asked and held up the neat invitation-scroll Al had given her. "It's only for a night. I know Malfoy's not your favourite person in the world, but surely you're not blaming the boy for what his father and grandfather are responsible for?"
Harry stood. "Yes, I have my desk cleared out this afternoon. And then I have a huge amount of private repair-damage to do."
Malfoy tensed up and jutted out his pointy chin. "Why this morbid curiosity of my love-life, Potter?"
"But not enough." Draco stood and faced Harry. "Not enough to let the world know your dirty little secret. Not enough to stand in front of the whole wizarding world and say: Hey, I've chosen a Death Eater as my lover."
"He needs to see Pomfery. That nose could possibly be broken."
The boy plucked a little at his robe sleeve. "There's some smells I simply can't stand anymore, like coffee. I've always liked the smell of coffee before, and Neville's collection of dried plants. I had to ask him to take them out of the dorm."
Draco held up his hand and pressed his thumb to that plump lower lip of Potter's mouth. It seemed like all acting was impossible from now on. "Why did you ask me here?"
Harry sat back on his heels again and squinted up at his son while his heart raced madly in his chest.
"Don't worry about that," Malfoy grinned. "The Department will get my bill."
Draco plucked a little on the top of the sheet. "By doing this, the whole world will assume that you're gay." In the statement was the underlaying question Draco didn't dare to ask.
After the event of the potion, when Hermione and Seamus had returned to the common room, Harry had stubbornly refused to tell them anything and then he'd stayed in his room for days. Ron told her that he and Neville had found Harry in Slytherin, that he must've had some sort of fight with Malfoy, but that's all he knew. Oh, and that Harry had taken off all his clothes at some point.
Malfoy lifted his pointy nose. "Could we have a bottle of Chablis with two glasses?" he asked in his haughtiest tone.
"Harry!" Weasley called after him, but Potter didn't stop.
"Pipsey will come and help. And Pipsey will bring food for Harry Potter's baby every day." And with another pop, she was gone.
"Well, if this is a bad time-" Malfoy started to say, but Harry cut him off.
"Well, Pansy's in New York with that dashing American husband of hers. She's very happy, I suppose. We Floo-call occasionally, but that's it, and I was never close to any of the other girls. Blaise is currently on some devious gigolo-tour around the continent, wooing witches with more gold than brains. I haven't heard from him since we met up in Switzerland last year. Greg never leaves his house, doesn't talk to anyone but me, and you know, he wasn't that much of a conversationalist in his best days. And you must have heard what happened to Theo."
Harry let his breath out in one relaxing sigh and allowed the potion to work in his system. Sleep, he only wanted to sleep and not to think for a long time again.
"I have to know. IS YOUR WIFE YOUR SOULMATE, MALFOY?" Harry was practically shaking with rage. "I can't stop thinking about it. The thought goes round and round in my head, it's driving me crazy. I even dream about you, damn it."
Oh bugger, he knew those trainers. No-one else wore such ratty Muggle footwear at Hogwarts.
"Minerva," Mrs Weasley called out over her husband's shoulder. "Has anything happened?"
Harry went alone to the Leakey. Tom, the old barman, greeted him heartily, and Harry ordered a beer and a small Fire-whiskey. He nodded at the regular crowd but sat down at a table by himself. He had brought a book. Pathetic, really. He suddenly felt like an old man.
Harry gave him a sceptical look but put his cup down and folded his hands in his lap. He didn't like the idea of having the grumpy old elf in the house again, but if Malfoy knew anything, it was probably about house-elves. Harry squeezed his eyes shut and mumbled, "Kreacher!"
"Something that makes it easier to ask people out on dates, without the risk of making a fool of oneself," Justin added.
A crack and the ugliest living thing Harry knew stood in the kitchen. "Master called for Kracher," he said and preformed a low ingratiating bow. He still had the fake gold locket around his neck and it dangled in front of him as he bent. Then his head flew up, and with wide astonished eyes, he croaked, "Master!"
Harry stretched like a cat. He woke up alone in the ruffled bed, just like the other times. Malfoy must have left right after Harry fell asleep. Everything was the same, yet it wasn't.
Draco flicked his eyes at the boy standing so close to him. "Keep it down, Potter," he growled. "Are you completely mad?" He glanced quickly around the room. "Do you want everybody to hear? What will your little girlfriend think?"
Draco went up to Harry and sat down at his side. "So, you lost, then?"
"Beautiful." Malfoy's hands were over his body again. "You have such interesting skin, my pet, nicked with scars all over." Hot fingertips roamed lower, touching, caressing. "Strong defined muscles, patches of coarse hair, and at some places," he traced his fingers at the dent right underneath Harry's bottom where it connected to the thighs, so soft." Harry gasped. "So sensitive."
"No." A wry smile pulled Malfoy's lips apart. "That happened earlier. Forth year, the Durmstrang delegation. Sasha from Kiev. He had wavy brown hair and almond shaped eyes and he kept following me around the castle grounds, pretty much like you did two years later." Malfoy winked and took a drink from his glass. "His English wasn't that good, so we spoke French. Not that he was much better at that. After some time, though, we didn't have to talk much at all. He was seventeen and I was fourteen, and it was all new and fantastic. At the Yule-ball we ended up in one of the empty classrooms while everyone else were dancing downstairs, and that was the first time I had a dick in my mouth."
"without the Potter name."
Harry blames Ron, really.

"Mmm. Hello, love." A hand traces the trail of tears and gently wipes them away. Draco's stubble prickles against the tacky skin as he trails a line of kisses to his jaw.
It hurts knowing he'll never get any of those moments. Though a Muggle tradition, he hadn't known he wanted James to give him away at his ceremony until he was holed away in the pantry cupboard sniveling away while their guest drank and danced.
Lunch is a lighthearted affair, with Sweetheart Cabbage Soup, seasonal fruit and an absurd amount of Papaya juice. It's mostly silent as the adult's politely listen as Scorpius rehashes an adventurous retelling of the trip to the Nursery they took down the street. When Scorpius is finished eating and tired of sitting in his high seat and requests to be released. "If you must," Draco sighs but smiles as Scorpius tugs on his sleeve to mock whisper, "Did we cheer, Mummy up, Daddy?" Draco's eyes run over Harry in conformation to take in the relaxed posture, mirth-lite eyes and an almost shy smile, Draco looks back down and runs a hand through the silken blond tresses much like his own with a smile bright enough to banish the darkest memories.
