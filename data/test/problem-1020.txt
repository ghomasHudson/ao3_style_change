“Or we can just divide the table into four sections and go with that. . . It’s faster” Draco was sure the Gryffindor side of the Patil twins was looking directly at the Slytherins.
After the failed mission the Dark Lord had been frantic and the efforts to take over the Ministry were stronger than ever. Draco knew it was only a matter of time. As the youngest of the Death Eaters and hugely inexperienced, Draco was no use for the Dark Lord and he was mostly left to his own devices. To his great relief he was rarely addressed and although some of the older wizards took joy in teasing and humiliating him, the fact that the Dark Lord was spending little time at the Manor meant that he was mostly free to roam his propriety as he pleased.
Be proud of who you are, my darling, and this time I don’t mean as a Malfoy, but of the young man you have become. Your father and I are.
“Anyway, ladies, I shall depart. I’ll leave you two to bond and figure out if this apartment sharing thing is meant to be. Eves, I’ll talk to you later. Dean, if I won’t see you again, it was a pleasure. Bye”. And he was out of the door with a dramatic flair that would have put Snape to shame.
Potter looked flushed, like if he had been running, and his voice came out breathless “Uhm, sorry, we had a late night. . . Ron’s brother. . . Anyway,  password is Russian Blue” Then he faced the gargoyle and repeated “Russian Blue”.
“I don’t see why you won’t consider that the boy simply fled. It became too much and he couldn’t cope. After all, he had just lost his rabid godfather and their perfect little family dream”.
Draco sighed again, wondering what he got himself into “You are terrible motivator” he scolded “But a good friend”.
‘The night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort’s soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself on to the only living soul left in that collapsing building. Part of Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry, and it is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes, and a connection with Lord Voldemort’s mind that he has never understood. And while that fragment of soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to, and protected by Harry, Lord Voldemort cannot die. He is the only one that can do it, Severus”.
“Mine”. He interrupted again, sweet rage making the words roll off his tongue like ice. “So, explain again why I should give it to you? Why shouldn’t I instead, let’s say. . . drop it?”
“Ok, then.” Scott said, his grin widening. “Shall we?”. He jiggled the keys in front of Draco’s face and tilted his chin in the direction of a white car that looked bulkier and squarer than most.
They weren’t particularly tanned but they had a healthy glow to their cheeks. Draco wondered if Potter’s freckles were more noticeable. He was too far away to see. They looked healthier in general, if only a bit tired.
Also, at some point i kinda described what i felt in the past during panic attacts and how i had to focus on an image and my breathing and heart rate to come back to reality, i hope it makes sense.
A woman around his mother’s age had emerged from behind a set of double doors, probably leading into the kitchen, and had now stopped midway, regarding him with curiosity.
Lupin remained silent but Draco could hear the rhythmical tapping of footsteps just behind him. Tap.
“Uhm. I’m sure you don’t want to sleep in your school clothes, even with a cleaning charm and what not. . . But, well, I wasn’t really prepared and these- these were Harry’s” the other man sounded so uncomfortable that Draco almost laughed, as if anything about this fucked up situation was actually funny.
“About that…” The other wizard was writing, but Draco interrupted, quickly scribbling “Did you know he was gay?”
“That thing is vile” he had growled, trashing it into the rising pile of objects on the floor of one of the guest rooms.
Despite his reservations, the car journey turned out to be smooth, almost relaxing. Scott fiddled with the radio before settling for some upbeat tune that Draco unsurprisingly didn’t recognise, but found himself enjoying nonetheless while it droned quietly in the background.
His mother was right, they did do some growing up. He read her words of apology once more and knew he needed to talk to Theo, who was strangely missing from their room.
“What are we going to do?” She asked, imploring for an answer. Pansy was a follower and, without a guide, she was lost.
Draco watched, enchanted, until the vial was thrusted into his hand, the other man’s finger closing around his own. “This is vital, Draco. I trust you. I am no fool, despite what you might think, and I know I am dying tonight”.
“I don’t know,” he said more confidently and walked away toward the fireplace where his mother stood watching.
“Draco” and when had Lupin started to sound so much like his mother “the full moon is in a week, I can’t risk roaming around Muggles. On top of that I have work to do for the Order. We are all mourning but soon things will have to get moving again, I expect the Ministry to fall before the end of summer. You, on the other hand. . . You asked for a new identity, no one is looking for you” he added, with a tinge of guilt.
Granger was alive. There had been so much blood. Red. But she was alive. There were alive. Luna. Potter. All of them.
He waved his wand lazily over a hardback copy of “Muggles for Dummies: 1000 easy tips to blend seamlessly into their world”, watching as page after page ripped off its bind and started folding neatly into origami cranes. Only when a modest fleet of paper birds was circling around him, he realised the other man had stopped talking.
“You look tired.” He observed, not unkindly, after calming down. “And I actually have to go. I’m sorry but I made plans for dinner a few days ago, but I can get you back to your motel on the bus and then me and Scott can fetch you in the morning with your things.”
Prompted by their long-established pattern, Draco snapped “I am not a bigot, Pott-“. He faltered as soon as he realised his mistake, but his mind could only provide a lame “P-Potty”.
“That’s Evan. Kid’s like a son to me.” Ellen revealed fondly. “Poor thing was so embarrassed that day. He is English as well. Too bad he is not in today, gave him two weeks off. Forced him to take ‘em, more like it. He gets those terrible headaches. . .” She broke off, realising she was possibly saying too much.
The Gryffindor was already searching trough a glass doors cabinet full of vials, muttering under his breath. Draco moved his gaze away and back to his former Professor. He addressed him tentatively “I was hoping to view the memories. . . Sir”
He sighed heavily, unwilling to let his old dramatic self die completely, and opened the journal. Lupin’s handwriting was surprisingly neat and pleasant. The message was barely two sentences long.
The weak illumination coming from the dining room projected long shadows across the kitchen, painting Lupin’s face with harsh stokes of black. It made him lose all his soft, worn edges, the one that separated the man from the creature. In that light it was hard to distinguish the unthreatening, almost unassuming figure that was his former Professor, and it was terrifying.
On the third day, the signs of distress now evident even in between the highest ranks, had made it clear that there was nothing standard going on.
Potter scratched his forehead absentmindedly “We all have marks that people define us by. Do you really want to do that to yourself, too? Live your life in regret, like them?”
His father pleading was interrupted by Greyback and he registered the two arguing in the background. He wanted to lie down and blend into the plush carpet.
“I think I had enough of living trough the war to bring it forward with me” Harry shrugged “And Luna told me you were different, that you were trying. And if there is one thing i know is that Luna always tells the truth.”
“Anyway,” Potter added, his voice suddenly tired, “Whatever you are doing, I hope it’s worth it” and he turned around and left.
Anyway I might do a portrait view of all the characters in the same way, so if you have any you want to see let me know
They sorted a quick lunch during which Draco tried to stand inconspicuously around the Muggle appliances he had no clue how to use, while still giving the impression that he was helping.
Maybe because, out of all the people that had accused the Gryffindor of being mad and a liar, the Malfoys had always known he spoke the truth. It was so Harry Potter, honesty no matter what. And maybe because, when you are desperate enough, you will believe anything you want to hear.
He rarely saw his friends, the ones whose parents were involved with or were Death Eaters themselves, and the encounters with Theo, Pansy, Greg and Vince were usually very uneasy and withdrawn. His secretive behaviour in the last year had put distance between him and the others, and he knew that the whole business with Dumbledore had left his friends somewhat shocked. Their arms were, ultimately, unmarked and Draco knew he was alone. Despite being of age, he felt like a child trapped in a role that didn’t belong to him. A new sentiment, regret, planted its seed in the pit of Draco’s stomach, growing and twisting, leaving him with waves of nausea and discomfort. If he could go back and talk to the cocky and proud 16 years old he had been the summer before, Draco was sure a few hexes wouldn’t have gone amiss.
The class had been a surprise. McGonagall had decided that the once cursed subject needed a fresh approach, so she entrusted the position in the hands of two Professors. Iwan Rees was an ex Auror, whose years of experience in the field brought a more engaging twist to the class. On top of a similar attitude to Professor Lupin’s, which involved the students in practical confrontations with potential danger, Professor Rees would talk about the tricks he had learn during his career. Self defence became a matter of predicting the other’s moves and responding in the most effective way but with the least damage. You want to incapacitate but reduce the chances to hurt, because you don’t know your opponent’s story. And that’s where the other Professor, Nyah Achebe, fitted in the picture. A mind healer from St Mungo’s in her forties, Professor Achebe had worked for almost two decades in the Janus Thickey Ward department, attending to the victims of Curse Damage. She illustrated the ethical consequences of using potentially harmful spells against others, and the long term repercussions that said spells could cause. She talked to them about having to deal with the result of their actions and the importance of considering the life of the others on the same level as their own. Unless in mortal danger, when the need to react quickly overcame everything, it was fundamental that they had full control and understanding of the spells they were using. She was also there to offer support to the students who needed it, either because of the war or for other unrelated issues.
“Is he happy?” Draco’s heart clenched at the tenderness of the question, not quite proud of the jealous urge to deny the truth, to keep his former Professor stewing in his guilt.
He took a seat next to Greg, causing the other boy to spill half of his drink on his lap, in the haste to scoot over. Pansy casted a quick “scourgify” to vanish the orange splatters that had reached her own uniform, nose scrunching up in contempt, before fixing Draco with an inquisitive gaze. With her haughty attitude and her face pinched, an image of a small and angry dog passed fleetingly through Draco’s mind.
It was Draco’s turn to blush. The other boy observed him for a long moment, and then said seriously “If you asked me a year ago if I was afraid of the future my honest answer would have been yes. . . I was afraid of losing someone again. . . Afraid of Teddy and being unable to love him like he deserves; afraid of what I was going to do with my life. . . Hell, Draco” he murmured, voice getting quiet, barely a whisper “I was almost afraid to live, after death was so peaceful”.
He flexed his right hand a couple of times, relishing in the tingling sensation still left in his knuckles, where his fist had met the firm cartilage of Potter’s nose with a satisfying crack. No doubt the Gryffindor’s nose had been broken and, for the first time in his life, he damned magic for how easily it could vanish the traces of their confrontation from the other boy’s face. There had been something deeply gratifying in the physicality of throwing a punch. The sadistic part of him wanted to see the reminder of his little victory lingering on Potter’s stupid features, for days to come.
“So, how come the other girl left?” he found himself asking curiously as they walked around the tiny kitchen. Not that he had any idea how to cook anything, Draco pondered with a sense of dread.
This chapter is about Luna and since i know she was taken on her way back after Christmas Holidays her and Draco didn’t have much time to get to know each other since he is at school when she is prisoner in his home, i created my own version of how they met. I wanted to say something else but i forgot so maybe i will add it later.
But Potter didn’t stop at the snitch. He kept speeding towards the ground, broom gone, and he was falling. Falling. Falling.
“It’s ok to be scared” a voice behind him made him jump and it took him a moment to understand where he was. Scared, he was just thinking that. No one should know, it was an honour, his mission, he was chosen at 16 for something no older or more experienced wizards were entrusted. An honour, to cherish and to be proud of, not scared. No one should know, but the voice knew. A familiar voice, Draco thought, not Myrtle’s. He froze, his eyes focusing again on the mirror and on Potter standing behind him.
He sat up in bed and locked eyes with Blaise. Even in the distance he could see that the other wizard’s dark orbs looked murderous. He casted a quick Tempus.
Lupin was already in the kitchen, hunched over a cup of coffee. Draco snatched the pot from the counter and drank directly from it, swallowing it all in two big gulps.
“Anyway, it’s really not that strange. Think about it this way, your chances to die in a car crash are way higher, and we use cars daily without much fuss.”
The steady pace of the bus was almost as calming as flying above the clouds, and Draco rested his forehead on the cooling glass, following the dance of city lights against the darkening sky.
Draco was left sulking in the kitchen, pulling at the loose threads of his new black jeans. He had never owned a pair and they were slightly stiff. Seeing the reaction of the girl in the Muggle shop, though, they clearly did good things to his assets so, at least, there was that.
The Sword In The Stone was ridiculous. Draco scraped the remaining popcorn from the bottom of the bowl, grimacing as the stray kernel he hadn’t noticed crunched under his teeth, and pondered how to convey his opinion without giving away what he really thought of such inaccurate portrayal of human transfiguration.
Draco fixed him with a disbelieving stare, which actually elicited an amused chuckle out of the other wizard “I thought so. She, at least, seems to think that your face that day was the highlight of her year”.
Draco’s heart was hammering in his chest, and his gaze darted in disbelief from the Hawthorn wand back to the boy that just won a war and still was there to return what wasn’t his. “Why?”
“I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had been entrusted, in case he used Legilimency against you,” continued Dumbledore. “But now at last we can speak plainly to each other. . . . No harm has been done, you have hurt nobody, though you are very lucky that your unintentional victims survived. . . . I can help you, Draco.”
Lupin didn’t seem to pick up on his inner panic, though. He barely acknowledged the change in ambience, as if the sudden death of his appliances was nothing more than a common occurrence and, as such, insignificant.
Draco wasn’t really convinced they were, that most of the people affected by it could have gone trough the war unchanged. But then, he had never taken the time to get to know the students from the other Houses before. “I am the one who’s not, though.” He replied, calmly.
With a half smile gracing his lips, Draco prepared to leave. It was only when he reached into his backpack for the felix felicis, that he felt his nerves unexpectedly tense.
“A terrible future that I embraced like an Idiot. I was NOT. A. Good. Person” he dared his mother to say otherwise “And we can’t just be young, anyway. None of us. Not after that”.
When morning came he looked at the two empty beds next to his with narrowed eyes. Theo had reached Blaise a week before and they wouldn’t be back until the Saturday. Draco felt slightly betrayed. In their letter the Italian had declared he would have been invited if they hadn’t know about “his need to reevaluate his life and wallow in self pity”. He considered skipping breakfast.
Draco took a liking to the gardens, and in particular a secluded spot surrounded by raspberries bushes, far away from the gates and the stream of people coming and going. It was a wild little corner, where nature had been mostly left in charge of its own creation. The grass was slightly overgrown and the ground was dotter with spontaneous flowers, a sight so different from the rest of the gardens, almost maniacally kept in neatness and perfection. Here Draco could pretend to be somewhere else. The midsummer days were warm and bright and he enjoyed the feeling of the sun gently lifting the iciness from his bones. He had never before picked fruits directly from the source and he pondered on how bizarre it was that he became of age without once engaging in something so mundane and normal. He thought of the orchard, that stretched across the land behind the Manor, and the apples trees he so often walked between. Never, not once, had he reached his arm out to grab one of the shiny fruits, so inviting. Was he really so used to be served that the notion never occurred to him? Apples had always been brought to him at his  whim, cut in regular slices and presented on fine china plates by obliging elves. Draco found out he truly enjoyed the small pleasure of selecting a berry and gently plucking it from the bush. After a soft blow, he would push the fruit in his mouth, sucking lightly on his juice stained fingers, and let the bitter sweetness of the raspberry melt on his tongue. A ritual, slow and treasured. And for a moment he would forget everything that was wrong with the world. Sometimes exhaustion would take hold of his body and he would fall asleep in the cool shade of the bushes. It was there that Narcissa frequently found him, curled up like a child, and in those moments there was only a mother hope for her son to be safe. And maybe, one day, to be happy.
“People change, Draco, especially at your age. And people heal. But you need to live and take risks to show that you are different and move forward”. She took his hand and fixed his eyes with her blue ones. “What do you think is going to happen, if you bury yourself in the Manor? In this house, that still stinks of horrible times? In your room, where all those memories will come back?”
“Yeah, I think I understand” Draco agreed. It made sense, after everything “Do you know what you are going to do?”
He glanced around but noticed that their three companions seemed preoccupied with a discussion about sports that left Longbottom looking like a fish out of water, and weren’t paying them any attention.
His gaze moved back to the teacher’s table, where Amycus was presenting his sister as the new Professor of Muggle Studies, a now mandatory subject. Alecto Carrow, albeit slightly brighter than her brother, was just as malevolent and she regarded the students with a wheezy laugh and the ominous promise she would teach them all the horrors about Muggles. Draco wondered if it was truly people like the Carrows, untalented and cruel but pure-blooded, that were “worthy” of the Wizarding World. While the siblings introduced Snape as the new Headmaster, Draco noticed the pursed lips and the subtle look of disgust on the older wizard’s face and he couldn’t help but thinking that his former Professor might share his opinion. He still wasn’t sure were Snape really stood in the war, and his need to reach out to the Professor was barely squashed by the possible dangers of revealing his new feelings.
“I am not changing my name to Diego. It sounds ridiculous. Do I look like a Diego to you?” This whole thing was ridiculous and maybe dying at the hand of the Dark Lord would have turned out easier. Surely less painful.
He wondered what the other students would have thought of this new Potter, the one without the name and without the fame that came with it. Evan James. Would Evan James blend in the background, had he arrived in Gryffindor as a nobody?
“Have you considered that maybe it’s because you are less of a prat? You’ve stopped provoking people, so most are happy just leaving you alone.” There was a little smile on Potter’s lips.
He observed the photo again, a bit unsettled in its stillness. Half of him expected picture-Potter to lift the paper crown any moment and reveal his green eyes. Maybe do something completely insane, like wink at him. He was about to stick it back and search if he could find the other boy’s face in any of the other images when a voice from behind made him jump.
“Dumbledore offered you an escape” The other boy said, looking directly at him. “I was there. You were going to take it”. It didn’t sound like a question.
Now, in a shabby motel room, twirling 24 hours worth of golden luck in between his fingers, he was suddenly anxious.
Draco saw a group of the younger students lingering around Potter wearing admiring expressions, but the boy regarded them with an half embarrassed smile and raised his hands. “Hey, I know I am Harry Potter and all that stuff. But this year is my chance at normality and I want to spend it in the most inconspicuous way. . . Plus, I had a prophecy thrown at me without my consent. . . Those, those are the true heroes” he said, looking fondly from Granger to Weasley to Longbottom and his other friends. “They only had their own free choice to befriend me despite the not so appealing package and all the complications. . . I am just a boy”
“Because, as you said it, it’s ridiculous. Harry told me you have talked a few times, recently. Civilly. . . And maybe he needs to hear it from a different voice. From someone that doesn’t have any reason to sugarcoat the truth”.
Even breakfast stretched over decades, the clock mocking him with the gift of time when all he wanted was the day to be over and done with.
“The landlord is so chilled,” Potter assured, already half out of the room, and Draco followed his voice. That too, had changed, taking on a deeper timber that was just slightly tainted by a foreign inflection. “She won’t mind changing the name in the contract. She lives downstairs, actually, so we could pop around later. She comes home from work around 5:30. If you- uhm, like it, that is”.
His friend rolled his eyes “No, you moron. Dean and Weasley were talking about it. . . And I think what Potter. . . Harry did the other day was very mature”.
After quickly brushing his teeth and toweling his hair dry with Potter’s t-shirt, he transfigured the old stained pillows into fluffy feathers ones and dropped gracelessly into the bed.
Snape’s tone held such contempt that Draco had no doubts where his loyalties really laid. The realisation that one of the Dark Lord’s most trusted servants was a two-faced snake didn’t surprise Draco as he thought it should, but he couldn’t really put his finger on why. After all, Snape despised Potter almost as much as Draco did.
Draco entered the Great Hall with a sense of accomplishment and a proud stance in his stride. After a rotten summer, finally having the upper hand on Potter had lifted a little weight off his shoulders.
Theo looked between the two of them before deflating. He leaned on the wall, knocking his head backwards rather hard, and closed his eyes.
God, I’ve just re-read this and it was pretty terrible. I wanted to include the meeting in this chapter but then it would have been too long.
The words that followed woved into a tale of new identities and Muggle metal birds, that took who had once been the Boy Who Lived into a new life in which he was just a boy. Draco stood there, pressed against the wall, and listened.
“Uhm, okay, great. Well, we. . . Never mind” The Gryffindor fumbled for words, apparently back to the old eloquence Draco was familiar with. “That is good, great. Not everybody is, you know. . .”
Draco could see them all now, a group of four plus a small goblin, snarling ferociously at his captors. First he looked at Thomas, one of the Gryffindors student’s in Potter’s year, the only inconspicuous one between the prisoners. Then at the red haired one, Weasley. Shit. Granger’s bushy hair covered her face partially, but it was clearly her. Shit. Shit. And, sandwiched between his two friends, was the captive whom they claimed to be Potter. The boy was looking at the floor, eyes fixed on his ratty shoes, clearly avoiding his gaze. Draco didn’t want to look, either, but the other wizard’s face was bloated and stretched in an horrific way and for a moment he was convinced that person couldn’t be Potter. Potter, that had evaded the Dark Lord for so long even when so close in his grasp, had no business being in his house, after all.
They searched for the Thestrals while bickering with each other. It was a strange new dynamic, something that Draco had only been able to do with Theo and Blaise.
The other wizard relaxed visibly, and Scott even went as far as waggling his eyebrows in his direction, cementing Draco’s newfound belief that Muggle teenagers weren’t any less fuckers than magical ones.
The front door of the building was left ajar, and Scott pushed it, muttering something about a damn Mr Carl-something and his damn disregard for the rules. Draco followed the Muggle up several flights of stairs until they stopped on the third floor and continued down the corridor to the last door, marked 18C.
Draco pondered about it. No one would suspect the girl to receive something from the outside, and it looked small enough to be safely stored in one of the niches between the dungeon bricks.
Draco thought about it “To a certain extent. It recognises me, but some of the spark is missing. Let’s say I might not reach the pinnacles of power with it, but it’s ok. Unicorn core is loyal, after all, so it’s still my wand”. And yours. Surprisingly, he was fine with that.
Draco raised an eyebrow at the odd choice of words, but at least they explained the connection between the guy and Potter. The two must be living together.
As predicted, Potter and his gang arrived on Wednesday. They were already outside, in the piece of land that stretched beyond Dumbledore’s grave, between the greenhouses and the lake. It was a peaceful place, quiet and big enough for their project. Draco was observing from the side the debate on the benefits of fountains becoming more incensed.
He could sense Theo’s stare boring into his skull and that was all it took for his feet to start moving.
“Look at me, Theo. All I could think about, during sixth year, when my life was fucked up, was my parents. I was in that situation because of them, and because I was an idiot. . . But mostly because of them. And even then, my mind was focused on doing whatever I could to keep them alive. I was scared. . . Shit, Theo, I was terrified. More than once I thought we were all going to die. I was losing my mind, and then someone told me something really simple, but that validated my emotions. He told me that it was ok to be scared, because that shit was real. . . Theo, it’s okay for you to be sad. It’s ok for you to want to remember your brother. It’s ok for you to love someone despite their flaws. And Stephen never killed anyone. I know it’s beside the point, but he wanted to be like your father, he wanted to make him proud. . . I know the feeling, it’s hard to do what you have done and be different. But that doesn’t cancel the relationship between you two”. I was Stephen, too.
Draco had to look up then. The other boy’s face was abnormally swollen and pink and the features were so distorted to be unrecognisable. The prisoner was still avoiding his eyes, his own kept downcast, but through the tiny slits in the puffed face Draco could see green irises. Potter, he knew. Merlin, even just by Wasley and Granger’s presence alone, logic wanted that the wizard in front of him was Potter. And Draco was a logical man. Still, his mind was working frantically to find an escape.
The hindrance with Potter meant Draco had to share the last remaining carriage with a group of overly excited Hufflepuffs that looked no older than 8. When they finally reached the castle, he had managed to slip away from the crowd to make sure the shrunken package, weighing heavily in his pocket, had reached the safety of the dungeons, causing him to miss the entirety of the Sorting Ceremony. He wasn’t about to tell Pansy any of that.
“Yeah” The other boy replied, eyes twinkling. So, Harry was going to make this difficult. Well, he wasn’t the only one that liked a challenge.
When it came to what to do with the space in the four corners, they had stalled. After hours spent without reaching any conclusion someone proposed that, once the last of the students had arrived, they could split into 4 groups and each would be in charge of one.
It felt like opening his eyes underwater, the sting of tears just barely held in under salted eyelids, because Malfoys didn’t cry. Often. When it mattered.
Then he move onto Harry, playfully wrapping a Gryffindor scarf around Wendy’s neck, their daughter’s green eyes exasperated. He had his money set on Ravenclaw for both his children, maybe even Slytherin for Wendy, and he knew that Harry’s red and gold heart would survive the blow.
Draco pursed his lips, deciding it wasn’t worth an answer, and reached for the pumpkin juice. Theo, though, was a nagging little shit.
“So? ‘S still scum” Vincent grunted. Which was a bit hypocrite, Draco thought, coming from someone who could barely put two grammatically correct sentences together.
Or maybe he wouldn’t. “But you know where he is!”. It wasn’t much of a question, still the denial startled him.
All the years he had spent hating the Gryffindor for being a privileged, unwarranted celebrity melted when faced with the fact that he didn’t really know the other boy at all. The things he had always accused Potter of being were born from his own assumptions and, admittedly, jealousy. Maybe it was the need to share something equally hard about himself, the desperation to return on common grounds and assure that no, his life wasn’t perfect either. Maybe it was the last, fading effects of the Felix Felicis that were telling him it was the right thing to say, but talking about his father was oddly relieving.
Still, he wasn’t sure what to say, how to talk to this person so different from him. Luna, on the other hand, seemed happy to do all the talking. She looked back at the Thestrals and said sweetly “They might look a bit daunting, but me and Harry find them quite lovely”.
“Wha — No!” Harry shook his head, a faint blush “What happen with Cedric was a different kind of awakening. . . It was when I realised that things were bad. . . But I wasn’t interested that way. It was her older brother, Bill” he whispered almost conspiratorially.
“We are apparating!” Draco had declared the day before, leaving no room for argument. It was a testimony of how much time they had been spending together that Lupin didn’t even attempt trying.
When the basin was full Lupin uncorked the vial and poured its silvery content into the liquid below. Twirls of smoke erupted at the contact between the two, before settling into a watery mist lingering just above the surface.
“Yeah, I killed him on that train and no one ever suspected me. A child, you say. And I- I left Potter choking on his own blood on that filthy carpet. I guess that cloak of his was more powerful than expected, because no one found the b- b- body”. Draco’s voice broke, begging for absolution.
“She is a bait” Draco added, because he wanted to say something. “They won’t hurt her”, because he wanted to believe it.
Even if Draco had recently had his personal fair share of crazy, the man in front of him looked like he must dine with insanity on the regular.
“You know, I could kiss him too, just for doing this. . . Harry, I mean. After him kissing a boy, I could make out with Filch and nobody would care.” Theo said in glee.
“Not a child, no. But you were young. . . You still are. See it as a second chance, for your education but also to be around people of your age. Free, for once. You lived your best years with a terrible future looming upon your shoulders. Now you can be a schoolboy and nothing else, for a little while longer”
But there he was, standing on platform 9 and 3/4 with his mother by his side, already dressed in his school robes with the hood put firmly over his fair hair. For once, he didn’t want to be seen. His father wasn’t present, but then he barely left the house anymore. His mother’s posture was stiff, a tense cord just short of snapping, her eyes averted from the mass of people around them. She held her chin high, a move that would been seen as of arrogance by the ones that didn’t know her. And why not, “their side” was supposedly winning and they had control over the school, for all it was worth she had reasons to be smug. But Draco knew his mother was just holding onto the last shred of dignity she had left. He could see the worry lines around her eyes and her mouth, an almost lipless line too tight for comfort. Her shoulders were straight, the aristocratic upbringing showing in each of her movements, but the rigid line of her neck and the imperceptible clenching of her fingers betrayed her poise. She was nervous. He wished he could talk to her, properly, tell her he was nervous too. Tell her to be safe, and reassure her he would be too. Hold onto her and never let go. He could see that more and more people around the platform were now saying their goodbyes and the white fog coming from the train told him it was time to go.
Ah, the Muggle Studies Professor. Voldemort’s glacial voice echoed in the room but was lost to Draco’s ears. He was again transfixed by the sight in front of him, Charity Burbage’s pleading eyes, so terrified in her last moments. Her soft voice begging Snape, a colleague, maybe even a friend, someone she trusted, to help her. She must have known it was in vain, but still she tried “Severus... please... please”. The same parting words professed by Dumbledore not long before, but while the Headmaster had sounded ready to Draco’s ears, Professor Burbage was desperate. She is scared to die, Draco realised, a bit pointlessly, and while watching Charity Burbage lifeless body fall ungraciously on the table he understood what Harry meant when he said that it was ok to be scared. Because this was real. This was war and people died and would die. And with this new knowledge, a boy that once dreamt of magnificence, power and glory, elevating himself above the others in what at 16 was just a game of role-play, felt his whole belief system die a little bit too. His head spinning, Draco felt his body give up and his chair hitting the floor with a crash. The last thing he heard was the snake hissing and then all was black.
Draco knew that Longbottom was prepared for that eventuality, but as he stepped forward, chin raised and proud, he noticed a flicker of uncertainty in the other wizard’s gaze. He remembered his aunt gloating about the fate of Longbottom’s parents, how the Cruciatus had reduced them to empty vessels, and wondered if his schoolmate was afraid of how much his little stunt would cost him. He always thought the Gryffindor as weak and pathetic, but the boy in front of him, willingly subjecting himself to something that destroyed his family, was neither. He hope it wouldn’t be the Cruciatus.
He sat down next to Draco and they watched as the Gryffindor tilted his head to give his companion a brief kiss.
“But there are people out there, making a difference. Is that all we are, what we do? Just exist, at the side, hoping to somehow end up alive?”. Draco was angry. Ashamed. Useless.
Thank Merlin the cafe was empty. He looked up and noticed that that side of the column, the one he couldn’t see from the entrance, was covered in pictures, interlacing on top of one another to create a huge canvas of smiling faces. One picture, possibly the one that had collided with his shoulder, was crooked and hanging halfway off the wall. He reached to readjust it and. Oh.
“It’s charmed to be used only by someone it recognises” Weasley added “no point in trying to use it against us”.
“Well Harry and Terry sounded stupid anyway. It has a weird ring to it.” He commented, his lips quicker than his brain.
Draco had made it out just in time to see Longbottom being set aflame, his head trapped inside the burning Sorting Hat. Longbottom, that had challenged Voldemort openly, to give the survivors that Hope Draco had come to understand the importance of. The sight of the fire had taken him back to the Room of Hidden Things. He had launched himself forward, without thinking. With him, many others.
“If anything like my mother, she would probably tell you you are going to catch a cold if you stay out in the rain”.
Scott’s eyes widened and he looked uncomfortable, almost shifty. “Ehm, I don’t actually live here. And when I stay over we, err. . .”
The way you stand up for what you think is right. How your eyebrows draw near in a likely manner when you are incensed, your eyes narrow and your voice assumes a sarcastic undertone. Your mouth curves softly just like hers, and your nose is smaller than your father’s. In the same way Draco’s was undoubtedly Lucius’s son, but to a trained eye it was clear how much of Narcissa was actually embedded in his features, he could see all the small details of Lily in the boy in front of him.
He knows, Draco thought, he knows. The air was sucked out of his lungs and his eyes drifted involuntarily back to the body still looming above his head. Would they be granted mercy with a quick execution or would their deaths be undignified, dehumanised, their bodies put up for a show like the nameless woman in front of him?
Draco peered out of the window, finding that it overlooked a neat looking garden and some nice townhouses, and nodded to himself. It would do.
“Give me the vial, Draco.” The request was still gentle but Draco took a step back and let out an incredulous laugh.
“Uh, me. . . Me too. Well, not idiocy, of course. . .” He waved a hand embarrassingly at himself to deliver his point, cringing at the awkwardness of the whole situation. Fuck Potter and his ability to take even being queer away from him.
As if summoned the other boy appeared, mumbling angrily “Theo, what the fuck!”. Blaise sighed in relief at his two friends, but he still appeared crossed.
After he was sure that nobody would take the seat next to his, he picked up his backpack, hugging it against his chest protectively like he would have done so many years before with his stuffed toy dragon, Prince. His knees came to rest just below his chin, sneaker clad feet perching at the edge of his seat.
Draco found Greg and Vincent on their way to the seventh floor. He stopped them at the top of the stairs, pushing them into an alcove.
“Well then, be caught.” It almost sounded like the other man meant it, but Draco couldn’t give up just yet.
The room was small and stuffy. The summer heat lingered stagnant in between the four walls, giving the air a murky smell. Draco casted all the cleaning spells he knew and opened the window, unconcerned of any of the dangers the receptionist might have been hinting at. Although he was aware of the complication of using magic against Muggles, he knew that entering the country via plane granted that his wand wasn’t traced. If the worst came to the worst, a few stinging hexes and memory charms could only aid to work out his pent up frustration.
Was he suppose to answer? And what do you reply to a question like that? The laugher grew louder and he could clearly see the other Death Eaters thrilled at his family humiliation. He looked at his mother and she shook her head minutely, a gentle warning. Not needed he thought, even willingly he doubted he could have found his voice.
So kudos to all those people that write a lot just for fun because this is killing me and I am not even sure it’s really worth it :)
He had left Potter with a broken nose, hidden under what appeared to have been a surprisingly powerful invisibility cloak.
Before leaving, Lupin had told him he had to arrange for the Gryffindor’s snowy owl to be taken in by some Muggle Animal Trust or something along those lines, where she could live without attracting attention. It had entailed a lengthy sob story on how the owl accepted her fate graciously, after finding out it was to protect her human companion. Honestly, Draco thought it was utter bullshit, because not even Potter could be so universally lovable to deserve the compassion of a fucking owl. Draco’s personal owl, Agatha, had almost pecked his fingers off on more than one occasion.
He briefly wondered how psychotic it would have sounded if he demanded for the blasted thing to be kept in the air until he had had the time to adjust. The mere thought drew a hysterical laugh out of him, causing his dry lips to split painfully at the corners. His mind shifted to the last time he had water, for breakfast that morning, and he was still pondering on how to cast an “Aguamenti” without being caught when the plane touched ground with a few harsh judders. His teeth crashed into his bottom lip, sinking into the chapped flesh and filling his mouth with the taste of copper.
She eyed him skeptically, dropping the menus on the nearest table. “Nonsense. I’m a man down but, seeing as we are not open yet, I think I can manage a full breakfast on my own. Mornings are never busy anyway, not this early at least. Orange juice or Coffee? You’d think tea, but in this heat. . .” Without waiting for a reply she pushed him towards one of the armchairs “Now, sit down, will ya? Allergies?”
She came back about ten minutes later, carrying a tray and a jug of water. He watched avidly as she lowered a plate stacked with pancakes and strawberries in front of him, the delicious smell of warm food filling his nostrils.
The journey wasn’t long and the driver blessedly quiet. It was too dark outside to really make out much of the passing landscape, so Draco relaxed against the leather seats. Given time, he could learn to enjoy travelling by car, he thought. It was almost peaceful.
“I am going. And so is Blaise”, Theo said after popping a raspberry into his mouth. He had a nice mouth. He was lounging lazily against a rock by the pond, a hat full of fruits resting on his legs.
Yes, Draco knew a wand was personal, so he looked down at the rumpled body lying on the floor, and couldn’t do it. In the middle of a battle, defenceless and in need of a weapon, he couldn’t do it. Even in the name of survival, even when the person in front of him wouldn’t need it again anyway, he couldn’t get himself to take something so important. It felt wrong.
“Yeah, they are stopping at the Burrow tomorrow to get Ron and Ginny and they should be here by Wednesday. . . It’s all very exciting”
He turned over, burying his face in the pillow, but Draco kneeled in front of the bed and forced the other boy to face him.
“Well, here we go”. The other boy said, pulling the car into one of the free spaces in front of a four storey building in pale yellow, covered in identical sets of tall windows paired with small, metal railings balconies.
Draco woke up at the uncomfortable feeling of the Dark Mark burning trough his arm. He was being summoned. He had fallen into a fidgety sleep so it didn’t took him long to be fully awake and receptive. He could hear Vincent and Greg stirring heavily in their beds. Of course, they knew. The Slytherin dorm was planned into a rectangular shape, 5 identical four posters lined one after the other neatly, with Draco’s the furthest from the door and Blaise’s the closest. Greg and Vince were crammed between Blaise and Theo and Draco knew they weren’t being courteous enough to think about their sleeping roommates. His suspicions were confirmed when he drew the curtains to stare at the ghostly white face of Theo.
To his surprise the other wizard relented, addressing him gently “Yeah, Okay- Okay. There is a bath upstairs, actually quite spacious. . . I mean, if you want to.  I’ll go and prepare the guest room.”
He hoped that if death had to come it would look as peaceful as the swan’s, seemingly asleep in the gentle shade of the bushes. Fast, neat, so that his parents could have a body, his body, to mourn.
“Evan” Draco repeated, conscious of how confusing this was going to get quite soon, the name not sounding any less wrong out of his own mouth. “Hi.”
His voice was so fond and eager that Draco almost snickered, knowing all too well how famously him and Potter had gotten along in the past. “I hope so.” He offered, trying to keep the dubious inflation out of his voice.
They discussed rent and a few other terms, to which he could only consent to, before the two boys dragged him for a tour of the flat, that wasn’t big at all.
“W-who? Mum . . .” He hugged her back, forgetting about the world around them. She was still shaking hysterically, wetting the collar of his shirt “Oh Draco, I am so sorry. . . So sorry”.
Anyway, I am writing something else as well (a bit of self promotion 😏) with a much better title than this one. So, if you want, check it out!
It was during one of those lessons, in which Draco had taken the habit to try his best at blending into the background, that Longbottom imprudently challenged Amycus. The Death Eater was explaining the uses of the Imperious Curse as a legit method of controlling Muggles and other socially dangerous individuals and he decided to pick Goldstein, a Ravenclaw, to demonstrate the effects. Amycus watched maniacally as the young wizard was forced to complete a series of humiliating actions, laughing and mocking him.
“Whatever you need to sleep at night” Potter scoffed, and Draco’s wondered why he hadn’t hexed him yet, but still he found himself stalling. “Listen, whichever way we were thrown into this, some of us more willingly than others” The other wizard continued, looking pointedly at him and making his arm tremble “this thing is bigger than us. I am sixteen, I should be worrying about Quidditch and whatever else stupid teenagers do, but I am scared. And when I saw Ced. . .” his voice wobbled “People dying, I found out it was ok to be”
They discussed the Death Eaters entering the castle and Draco thought he might as well get to the point “I have a job to do”.
Draco felt like the time he used to hate Harry Potter belonged to another life, one that was long gone.
Draco squeezed her knee gently “You will find out that, to move forward, you first have to let go. And sometimes people will surprise you”.
Draco stared at the little footprints frantically pacing inside the boundaries of the paper until they blurred into nothing more than a blotch of ink. He was aware of the time slipping away, each second punctuated by the rhythm of his heart beating loudly in his ears, but he found himself unable to look away. Only when his mother’s name became illegible through the mist swelling in his eyes, he finally took a deep breath, trying to collect his thoughts and praying Salazard’s entire bloodline to stop him from crying.
She must have been pushing fifty, he guessed, but her skin was smooth and tanned, taking years away from her appearance. Her outfit echoed the colours of the shop entrance, deep green summer dress, ending in a turquoise bow around her collarbone, and a lightweight mustard cardigan. Two top-hat shaped pendants sparkled at her ears. Again, Draco was brought back to Hogwarts and left wondering if this was what Potter’s loony friend Lovegood would look like in 30 or so years. Maybe it was this aching familiarity with the world he left behind, so different from the concrete and plain angles of the Muggle one, that had pushed him to enter the little shop in the first place, and nothing to do with Potter at all.
“Yeah, what a coincidence” the other boy, who had been following Draco’s descent with his eyes for a while, replied with ill-concealed sarcasm.
“Are you afraid?” Draco asked, because it was almost a routine of theirs. “Of the future?” He hurriedly added.
As per usual, if any samaritan wants to correct my errors please let me know or point them out in the comments
“Not fully. Rees told me the Aurors can wait, but I think I am considering an internship in Rehabilitation and Reintroduction of the Magically and Emotionally Affected. Professor Achebe explained that is similar to Muggle Social Services. . . I would still be following cases with the Aurors, and Hermione is going into law. . .” Harry rubbed his nose and blushed “I don’t know, I feel like I can relate and you know. . . My saviour complex”.
The twat laughed, unbothered “Were you thinking about human Ron? You know what they say about pulling pigtails and all that -“ he said, poking gently at the feline counterpart.
Lupin was waiting for him in the corridor, hovering awkwardly, a bundle of clothes gripped in his hands like a safety blanket.
And didn’t it paint a nice little picture of his character, that Dumbledore had him pegged down as someone capable to uproot a kid from his new, shiny, fucking clueless life and send him to his death.
They climbed the staircase in silence. The room was quite large, insufficiently lit by a small window on the side opposite the door. Although aided by floating candles, most of the illumination came directly from the roof, where small semicircular glasses, positioned randomly across the tiles, filtered the light into long beams. The dust particles in the air glistened gold, giving the place a mystical feel. Hogwarts was beautiful, but there was something special about the Headmistress’s office.
Lupin instantly sobered. “You are right, I am sorry. She really is the cleverest witch of her age, though. We needed to, uh, have a chat with Slughorn about something and Hermione thought why not take advantage of a little bit of luck. It’s really hard to come across felix felicis, almost impossible, but she said we were in a war. . . That she was scared for her friends, that she was hoping to find Harry one day. . . So she managed to get three more vials after that. I- I have one, should be enough for a 24 hours dose or two 12 hours ones, if you half it.”
Was it possible for an inanimate object to look mocking? After hours spent staring blankly at the musty wall, Draco thought the answer was rather yes.
He had actually scratched the skin around his nails raw, and the sight of blood tempted Draco to assure him that he didn’t need to continue, despite curiosity eating him up. But Potter had always been determined, even when facing a challenge against his own discomfort. Maybe even more so.
Harry rubbed his nose, pushing his glasses up his forehead and sighed, casting a Sonorus. Draco could sense his unwillingness and wondered how he could had ever thought the Gryffindor was one to rejoice in the spotlight.
“Granger” He greeted. The witch appeared tired and worn out. He noticed a couple at one of the few occupied tables, looking out of place and glancing nervously in her direction. There was a third cup of tea next to theirs. The man was pale and thin, while the woman had dark skin and Granger’s bushy hair. Her parents.
The other wizard had acknowledged his help with Luna simply trough short nods in the corridors and quick hushed greetings, enough to let Draco know his plan was successful. He didn’t expect nor wanted a thank you. It was dangerous on both fronts to demonstrate any involvement, so they hadn’t spoken to each other since that time.
But then another familiar voice rang in the chaos that was about to happen. “I am pants at potions”.
He entered the Three Broomsticks and headed straight to the counter, without looking around. Madam Rosmerta was rearranging the bottles on the shelves, but stopped as he approached.
It was a reckless move, after all he was the one stuck in between two fires, neither of which he belonged to.
Instead he squirted a small drop of toothpaste on his finger and scrubbed his mouth until it felt numb, mint and blood mixing.
Potter, who had clearly grabbed blindly for the first available one, flushed, his freckles darkening dangerously close to Weasel’s levels.
“Oh, yes. Room 78, already paid for two nights. Here are the keys.” He said, swaying said item from his index finger.
Longbottom studied him intently for a moment, and then replied “I saw when Harry did it. The way it gave people hope, the way he fought for them, for the truth. It was powerful, important”.
“I know you think I am the hero of this war—“ The boy said, clearing his throat “And I will not start speaking about merits of demerits. But if there is something this war has taught me, is that we are all humans. All of us, even Voldemort.” Some of the audience still shuddered at the name. “It was his error, to think he was invincible, and at the end he died just like everyone else. Nothing spectacular, nothing great. I am just Harry, I might have done something big but it was a mix of circumstances and a lot of help from the people that care about me.”
He quickly scanned the room, his eyes automatically searching for a familiar mop of black hair, but the voice that piped up from somewhere at the back was definitely feminine. “Scott? Is that you? Gimme a minute, kid, just leave the - Oh.”
“What happened?” He asked instead, unable to completely hide his impatience. Draco knew he wasn’t talking about the lights.
I know some of the dialogues are taken directly from the book but i wanted it to be as canon as possible and I hope this doesnt make it boring.
The urge to take him into his arms was overwhelming, but they weren’t there yet, not in this life. Not when he was only Evan James’ school teacher and little more.
“Dean. I’m Ellen. I’ll leave you to your breakfast. And don’t be a stranger, you’ll always be welcome here in Wonderland.” She winked at him and disappeared back behind the kitchen’s doors, leaving Draco with the feeling he had somehow missed a reference in there.
He found the boy lurking in the bushes nearby. The younger version of their former Professor was looking at the girl as well, but with another kind of longing. Draco recognised the childish interest he too had sometimes looked at Theo with, when they played as children . Not yet sexual but different from the way he did at his other friends.
Not that it was hard to, his distracted wandering the only thing that had allowed him to overlook the quirky cafe before. It stood at the corner of an intersection, dwarfed by the sleek and modern buildings surrounding it. It was oddly familiar, like it could have belonged among the outdated architecture of Diagon Alley, with its wooden frame painted sage green and two handfuls of bright windsor style chairs dotting the pavement in front of the entrance. The mustard sign above his head read “The Mad Hatter” and each one of the little tables outside held a dainty teapot bursting with flowers as a centerpiece.
Also, I find that its hard to change your ways, to do something that has not been in your character so far, even once your mind is changing, so I hope this explains some of Draco’s actions. He is changing but it will take time to reflect in his behaviour.
“Have you been spying on Potter again?” Theo had been drawn to the Gryffindor since the other boy had saved his big mouth from being hexed into perpetual silence.
He went straight to the Headmistress’s office after the class, and before lunch time the next day he was on his way to Hogsmeade.
After the Holidays the students of age who wished to do so, were invited back a couple of days earlier in order to further discuss their employment options. They weren’t pressured into making a decision, but it was helpful to be able to share their ideas with the Professors specialised in the subjects they wanted to pursue. Draco had talked to Professor Slughorn and, in the spur of the moment, decided to get Flitwick’s opinion about antiques and restoration charms, an area of work that, despite the bad memories connected to it, he found fascinating. The Head of Ravenclaw had been enthusiastic at Draco’s interest, agreeing that many people possessed objects they were sentimentally attached to but that were often damaged because of age and usage. He had left the office rather satisfied. That morning at breakfast, he and Longbottom had even discussed the possibility of further expanding the research on fertilisers started at the beginning of the year. Overall, a pretty good day. He was just on his way to find Theo, who had declare he wanted to know more about Mind healing, when he noticed Harry coming from the same direction as Professor Achebe’s office.
“It’s refreshing, the way Ernie is so into traditions despite being an Hufflepuff. He is worse than you. Did you know that his parents own —“ Theo was blabbing but stopped when he noticed what had caught Draco’s attention.
For some reasons it didn’t make sense, and memories came rushing back to him in a cold wave. The vanishing cabinet. The Astronomy Tower. Dumbledore, lifeless body white against the dark canvas of the night sky.
He looked up, noticing the other boy had stopped on the edge of the kerb, observing him with a slight frown. He must have been talking for a while, Draco realised with a foreign sense of guilt. He wasn’t there to idly chit chat to the Muggles, but he couldn’t help offering an encouraging smile.
“You are a wizard, you’ll figure it out” Lupin chuckled before sobering up so suddenly that Draco had to wonder if he was actually seeing things. “Open it, please. On the first page.”
Astoria gave her sister an apologetical shrug before resuming her conversation with a group of Ravenclaws girls in her year.
Dumbledore was frantically flipping through an old tome, fragile paper wrinkling carelessly at the corners in the haste. He appeared so absorbed in his task that Draco jumped when the Headmaster suddenly spoke. He stumbled backwards and into a chair, going straight through it and falling on his arse.
The other wizard stopped and stared at Draco like he had somehow accidentally conjured him out of thin air and was surprised that he was a real boy.
“I’m sure you’ll be cast off as a prisoner of the Order of the Phoenix and I doubt you know enough for that to be of any importance in the greater scheme”.
Draco let himself cry. Cry because, somehow, he had become the boy that was capable of choosing a life over another. Crying because, despite the tears and the guilt, he knew he was still gonna do it.
Theo and Blaise were the last to arrive and joined the group on the evening of Saturday. Blaise regarded the other pupils with his usual aloofness, receiving a few huffs and eye rolls. He had never cared much about making a good impression, even when with other Slytherins. Theo, on the other hand, was really jittery.
The evening of the third found Draco sitting cross legged on the worn carpet of Lupin’s living room, back against the sofa and surrounded by papers and books. He rubbed the heels of his palms against his eyelids and tried to tune back in what must have been the hundredth delineation of Muggle’s customs for that evening alone, but his mind kept wandering adrift.
Draco held a breath and reached out. He plucked the keyring, holding it as far away from his body as he could. He made sure not to touch the little wooden ball dangling from it, the room number painted on it almost invisible under layers of dirt. It looked extremely sticky and Draco had no intention to find out if it felt just as much.
“Boarding school together!” Harry finished for him. “Yeah, I remember. Although, I cannot imagine them in a boarding school. I mean, Aunt Petunia, for all she acts high and mighty, she is quite middle class really. I guess it does explain why she would hate her sister so much, but. . . boarding school, sounds fancy. I guess I don’t really know much about my parents”.
He couldn’t help but wonder where Potter was. He wasn’t sure why he expected the other boy to be there, he didn’t have any reason after all. No one would ask for the Saviour of the Wizarding World’s qualifications when looking for employment. Probably he didn’t even need to work. Not like it was Draco’s business, anyway. His mind didn’t seem to agree and, before he could stop himself, he was asking Longbottom “Where is Potter?”
Draco was shocked and felt the pull back into his own body, where he found himself staring into the blank face of the Gryffindor. After a short time Potter regained consciousness and for a while they just stood there looking at their feet and anything but each other.
“As for your mother I cannot promise anything, but you did what you were asked.” It was said such matter-of-factly that Draco stopped shaking. He had expected rage but his former Professor’s gaze was gentle, pinning him to the spot. “It doesn’t really matter who casted the final spell, I suppose, not when Dumbledore’s. . . Dumbledore’s death is an ultimate victory in the eye of You Know Who. A reason for celebration. No pure blood would be spilled over the disappearance of an insignificant pawn, no offence.”
The Great Hall was empty but for a rather large round table, at the centre of the room. The Professors were occupying their normals seats. Only a few of them were already back, chatting amiably and seemingly ignoring the little group of students. About half of the table was filled and he spotted a few familiar faces. Most of them were seventh years or returning students. They were all sitting on the left side of the table, discussing together while helping themselves to the food. Thomas and a boy he didn’t recognise, but that was wearing an Hufflepuff tie, seemed to occupy the central seats and were surrounded by quills and parchments, and what looked like a sketch pad. He awkwardly took the seat next to Longbottom, Daphne going for the one after. The other students looked at them and, for a moment that in Draco’s nervous mind stretched way too long, there was silence.
“You have fought,” said the high, cold voice of the Dark Lord, “valiantly. Lord Voldemort knows how to value bravery. Yet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me, you will all die, one by one. I do not wish this to happen. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste.
With the progression of dinner, though, the lack of Potter started to be noticed, all around the Hall. By the end of the night his initial gratification had been replaced by unease. Draco, who had indulged in what he thought was a well deserved second dessert, felt a wave of the ever present nausea that had been plaguing him all summer, return at full force. Almost compelled to ditch them and face the consequences, he scrambled through his prefect duties in a haste, only barely gloating at Weasley and Granger’s distress.
He looked up and met his father’s eyes. The man had never looked worse, but his eyes were alive once again. He breathed in twice, slowly, closing them in pain and relief. Then he looked back at Draco “Son. . .”
The conversation dragged on, all his work unravelling in front of him, making him nauseated by what he had accomplished and what was still left to do. “You care about me saying Mudblood when I am about to kill you?” The whole idea sounded stupid, concentrating on something so righteous on a moment like this, when surely nothing mattered but trying to survive.
All the attention was now focuses on him, people hanging onto his words. It felt powerful, but a different kind of power.
He looked at his parents, standing stiffly a little apart from the rest of the group, but there anyway.
The title doesn’t have much to do with the chapter’s content as with the sense of belonging, to be part of something (like the round table in king Arthur).
“What are you doing, what are you doing, the door’s that way!” He screamed in the other’s boy ears, but the Gryffindor ignored him and dived. Faithful to his mission till the end, to succeed or die trying. Dying hugging Potter. Draco almost wanted to laugh at the absurdity of the thought. He shifted closer and closed his eyes. Next thing he was laying face down on the hard ground of the seventh floor corridor.
They talked about the night events further when Dumbledore fixed him with a stern gaze, eyes firm but caring.
Around 11 a small crowd had gathered at the entrance to the Gardens, marked by a delicate arch of jasmine. The gentle scent of the flowers danced in the air. People were wearing bright colours, because as McGonagall had said it wasn’t a funeral. As they passed the archway a multitude of enchanted tiny globes started to float around them, glittering gold and silver in the sunlight. They moved with the rhythm of nature, giving the Gardens a peaceful feeling. In the four corners, short, flat rocks, were positioned between random arrays of plants and flowers, to create bucolic seats for the visitors. The red chrysanthemum at the heart of the site moved gently in the breeze. One by one the families and friends of the fallen dipped their hands in the pots and threw their seeds in the air. The dark soil was soon filled with forget-me-not, and amaranth, and buttercups, primroses, saxifrages and so on. As each one of them approached, the earth under the gravel glowed different colours.
“We developed a little charm for the seeds. Every time someone nearby says a joke or voices a happy thought, the buttercups will turn purple for an hour” He was saying, scratching his neck sheepishly.
The interior was, if possible, even madder. A huge clock with the hands seemingly stuck on “Tea” hung from the central column and a mismatched assortment of armchairs and stools, with the most outrageous upholstery, filled a room that was otherwise larger than expected. Draco thought that neither Trewlaney nor Dumbledore would have looked out of place in there and his chest tightened uncomfortably.
Draco felt like he was intruding, so he made to leave. He wanted to check on Theo anyway. He managed only a few metres when he was stopped by a couple, followed by a shy looking boy.
“We share.” Potter finished firmly, chin titled defiantly in a way that Draco recognised as so quintessentially his that a wave of nostalgia hit him before he could even consider the words.
Memories didn’t come rushing back this time, they were already there. At the front of his mind, clear as shards of glass and, no matter how many times he blinked, they would not go away. Draco was tempted to knock himself unconscious again, hoping to forget. Hoping that, maybe, this time the concussion would be fatal.
The other boy looked less impressed “Oh, shut it. You are not the only one doing all the growing up”
The Gryffindor deflated “Tomorrow is— would be Professor Lupin’s birthday. I’m going to Andromeda’s to spend it with Teddy. I haven’t seen them since the opening of the Gardens. . .” He trailed off.
Then the other boy broke the silence “The first time I heard my mother’s voice, aside for in my dreams, was in Snape’s memories”, he said, still very interested in the floor.
Potter startled, letting out an unintentional chuckle that sounded more like an hiccup. When he spoke, there was an almost teasing smile dancing on his lips.
Buttercups: childish memories (they are also yellow, so when George explains the charm we have yellow flowers meaning something light and free like childhood turning purple. Yellow and purple are the two colours of their shop. Ah, how my complicated mind works)
But in Snape’s young mind Lily was different. It was convenient and, in the hypocritical way children do when they want something, it was easy to manipulate his own beliefs to accomodate his interest for the girl.
“My dear boy, let us have no more pretence about that. If you were going to kill me, you would have done it when you first disarmed me, you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and means.”
He bit down on his tongue, mentally cursing his stupid mouth and his stupid heritage, but the other boy looked simply amused.
At some point Blaise voice had murmured from somewhere near his ear “I know you have done it for him. You have done it so he didn’t have to”.
Potter blinked. Once. Twice. Then looked away. He started running his left hand on the smooth surface of Professor Snape’s grave, eyes following as his index traced the darker lines of the marble. He had thin, delicate fingers, not very long. Almost small hands for a boy of average height. His wrist poked out from the hem of his sleeve, veins protruding over the bone. Draco watched transfixed the rippled movements happening under the skin with each rotation of the joint. For an insane moment he imagined his own, long fingers encircling that wrist, feeling the flowing of blood in rhythm with the other’s boy heartbeat.
“No” Theo disagreed “I think you waited for the right moment. Neither you or them were ready, before.”
His breath caught in his throat, and he stared in disbelief at the little printed lines in front of him, where the words “magical” and “wizard” stood out starkly against the others. Faintly registering the loud thumping of his heart, Draco was about to wipe out his wand and demand Potter if this was all a joke, if it was a ruse that he had concocted with the help of Lupin to make a fool out of him. But when he looked up the other boy was regarding him with an easy smile, no sign of malice or recognition.
“As a matter of fact, I am indeed quite knowledgeable,” Draco replied, keeping his tone on the edge of bored.
Granger spotted him and cried “Malfoy, have you seen Harry? Neville! Neville, we are looking for Harry. He was with us but we lost him”.
Draco shuddered. “I have a reservation” he replied, pushing a printed sheet towards the man, careful not to make contact with any surface.
But he imagined the other boy, alone while the battle raged around him, hearing his death sentence from the mouth of a man he had always trusted. Barely more than a child, and yet he still walked into the forest in order to die and give the others a chance.
“Are you alright, darling?” She asked in a sweet foreign accent that had the “r’s” rolling off her tongue like a purr.
“I think what you just did shows that maybe you aren’t”. But Blaise reassurance was of little consolation.
Everybody was still looking at him “So, the conclusion of this lengthy monologue is don’t be an idiot and respect and listen to the ones around you” he hurried, waving a hand in dismissal. There was a pregnant pause before someone started clapping. Soon the sound became louder and Draco breathed in relief. The Headmistress smiled at him.
Evan James really wanted to move to California. Far, far away, in one of the least prolific magical areas in an English speaking country, where Harry Potter was really a nobody. Unbeknownst to Harry, all the documents necessary, paired with a one way ticket to San Diego International Airport, were upstairs, safely tucked in the left drawer beside the master bed. He had even gone as far as putting a tricky spell on the papers, assuring that any muggle coming across them would feel gently compelled to accept their validity. Another possible one way ticket to Azkaban on his already impressive list.
Draco was still thinking about Longbottom’s words when, a few days after, he found himself involuntary on his way to the astronomy tower. He stopped. I am tired to be afraid. I am tired to be afraid.
“That was an amazing piece of magic” was his last thought before he was standing in what had once been Dumbledore’s office.
Draco didn’t need to hear more, he knew what the other boy meant. I want to stay out of it, you are not welcomed here.
It was admittedly a good idea, and Draco found himself reaching out half-heartedly “And it’s pink for what reason, exactly?” He queried, wrinkling his nose.
A glint of gold and he was steering the handle of his broom. Just a touch, because in his fantasies he rode a Thunderbolt VII, the new best on the market. Then, and he should have expected it, because his dreams were never not nightmares, Potter was there. Draco pulled at his broom, decreasing his speed to a nearly halt, and looked at the other boy diving towards the snitch like a bird of prey. Gracious and focused, his features blurred by the distance and momentum. An heartbeat was all it took, in the strange contorted timeline that was Dreamland, and Draco was urging his broom forward like a horse, thinking “faster” and “it’s on”.
“How are things over there?” He dared to ask, knowing that the previous night had been the full moon.
Blaise’s take on the Dark Lord’s matter was of disinterested arrogance, like if he felt above all those blood disputes. Draco was aware that, in truth, Blaise was making a statement with his unbothered attitude. I don’t want to be involved, just like Theo. Overall, Blaise was a far better man than he was, and Draco knew that, even if differently, he would be a far better friend for Theo too.
They said their goodbyes not long after, and when Draco woke up the next morning he was greeted with the confirmation he never wanted to receive.
The concise answers grated on his nerves and Draco thought he might have found someone to punch, after all.
“I just wonder how things would have been hadn’t she died. I know she wasn’t like my father, grandma would say it all the time. And I do remember her”.
The message had come at dinner. After the ceremony the trio had left to Hogsmeade with the rest of the  Weasleys, but Draco had found a note tucked under his glass, likely given to one of the House Elves. It had been really brief, just a line in a messy scribble “All sorted. 11 am, outside the gargoyle. H.”.
Lupin had left a while earlier. Draco had not so subtly told him to stop treating him like a fucking child and the parting had been tense and awkward. Now that he was one “look where the fuck you are going” away from blowing his entire cover, though, he kind of missed having someone to keep him together.
Potter, the heathen, was sucking the salt from the popcorn off his fingertips, and when their eyes met he quirked an expectant eyebrow.
“Perfect.” And wasn’t it just. “I think it would be best to wait and give Harry’s memories back after his birthday, in case he does something that could be traced back to him.”
“You have changed, Draco. Very well, you might proceed” he sighed in the direction of the Gryffindor, like if he wanted to say more, but only resolved by looking torn and a bit regretful. It was a look that Draco had never seen on the Professor’s face and he pondered about how much of Snape he had actually gotten to know when he was alive.
The smile that the other boy gave him was as delighted as the one he used to reserve for his beloved golden friends. “I really think this is going to work out.”
“Uh-“ he replied dully, still half licking the blood off his cut “Oh, yeah, fine!”. Were all Muggles this amiable or was it just his blasted luck, once again having him sitting next to someone that couldn’t mind their own business? Probably the latter, if he had to base it on how things were going lately.
And Draco once again reflected on the power of actions, and how a simple phrase of acceptance had change the course of everything. Blaise wasn’t the only one to be impressed.
Draco stared at his reflection. His worn-out reflection; grey skin and sunken eyes, just a ghost of his former self. A 16 years old walking bomb, all nervous ticks and paranoia, ready to implode on himself. He felt claustrophobic in his own skin, his once fitted clothes feeling constricting despite the bagginess. He pulled at his tie, a snake around his pale neck, too tight, suffocating, no room to breath. He needed air. His eyes in the mirror were pleading. His father’s eyes people said all the time, but his father’s were always so composed, superior, disdainful. “Not afraid, Draco, never afraid”. He felt the wet trail of tears on his cheeks more than saw them, the world had suddenly gone blurry, out of focus. He needed to act, do something out of character, freeing. He had always been a showman, gloating in the spotlight, in the attention and admiration, but this year he had to be discreet, and he hated it. He wanted to run naked, screaming, to see people looking at him as if he was as mad as he felt, fear in their eyes. He wanted to run, full stop. He was running out of time and he was scared.
He stared in the direction of Potter’s retreating form, still unmoving for long after the other wizard was gone, words of thank you on his lips unable to be voiced.
The Carrows intimated for Boot to stop his cheerful praise of Potter and his friends. It’s all lies, they said. But Draco knew from the excited whispering going around the Hall that the students believed it. That they believe Potter was strong. That they had a chance to win the war.
“Good thing we are not staying long, then.” Lupin dismissed him, looking around. “I have something for you.”
Draco nodded again in acknowledgment and watched quietly as the other wizard fumbled around the pockets of his worn cardigan for his wand. He had seen his father organising his own thoughts in the Manor’s pensieve enough times for the process not to be entirely foreign, but it was still fascinating to witness.
“Your flatmate named her ginger cat Ron?” Draco asked again, stressing the word ginger with disbelief.
And Harry was just a child, with the same threat that had taken his family away 15 years before, looming over his shoulders.
“Yeah. And it’s not my cat, technically. It’s Allie’s, but he is staying for the time being, I really should have mentioned actually. I hope it’s not a problem?”
When a sharp pain brought his focus back to his own mangled finger, he admitted that he was far from  relaxed, his nerves  coiled tightly as a spring.
Despite Sirius’ glare had almost been enough to set the entire pile on fire, the matter of Voldemort return had taken priority over everything, so that anyone from the Department of Magical Artefacts and Regulations had yet to come and collect it. To this day, the objects still lay scattered across the cold tiles.
At the mention of his former school mate, Draco’s eyes snapped away from the mesmerising body in front of him. The audience of the room was now fully focused on the exchange between the two men.
“I didn’t even remember about that stupid bint!” He lied, the image of Bell’s seizing body suspended in mid air forever burnt behind his eyelid and in the deep subconscious of his nightmares. “Im under no obligation to tell you anything but. . . A dead man’s last wish, I suppose I owe you that much. It’s ironic, how the Greatest Wizard of our age couldn’t figure out what happened to a 16 years old whose talent only exist in legends and bed-time tales. It’s killing you already, I can see it.” He spat, feeling a rage that wasn’t entirely directed at the man in front of him, a man that he had almost begrudgingly come to respect on some occasions. “Or maybe it’s the guilt eating at your flesh, for not even you could protect our precious celebrity”, he added, glancing at the darkened hand gripping at the rail without any strength if not sheer shock.
“Of course, my Lord,” his father replied hastily . His hand shook as he wiped sweat from his upper lip. “We did desire it — we do.”
When the silence stretched a bit too long Draco snatched the first book he could reach from atop one of the scattered piles, vaguely registering it was titled A Guide to Muggle Currencies, and bid the other man goodnight. “Nothing like a light reading to promote good dreams.” He said, waving the book dramatically.
“I, however, am not”. Blaise sounded indifferent but Draco knew that, to speak now, he must have been impressed.
For Salazar’s sake! Draco searched for something to stuff in his friend’s mouth. The apples looked appealing.
I am so sorry this is not really up to standard at the moment but I have so little time for writing. The story is all there in my head tho so I am not giving it up, maybe one day I will fix the chapters that I’m not satisfied with🙂
The last day of his life passed like a photo album of someone else’s. Snapshots of inconsequential moments that didn’t matter, didn’t belong to him.
Draco tapped his new wand, his mother’s wand, on his leg under the table, a nervous habit he had picked up of late. Tap. Tap. Tap. He met Theo’s eyes and his heart clenched, the dreadful sensation of foreboding bubbling insistently in his stomach.
He dragged his shirt sleeves furiously on his cheeks, blinking a few times to clear his vision and felt the rage bubbling up in his stomach. Not fear, rage. Not fear, hate. For the first time in weeks, not fear. He whirled around, finger brushing his wand so suddenly that his brain didn’t completely register the movement of his arm before it was fully stretched in front of him, ready to damage. Potter stood there, just a couple of steps inside the bathroom and looked at him with a strange calmness, missing the ever-present air of disgust they normally reserved for each other. Draco’s guessed that the righteous Gryffindor in Potter didn’t allow him such emotions in front of a man crying, even one he hated, and this thought made his fury blaze stronger.
“Yeah, you. In not such kind words. . . Over and over. . . for about six years, give or take.” The other wizard replied with a smirk.
Draco looked at the pink notebook held out towards him in disbelief. Umbridge, his mind provided, he had been such a failure as part of the Inquisitorial Squad and now this was his punishment. He was about to ask if she had been using polyjuice all along when Possibly-Umbridge-In-Disguise sighed heavily and thrusted the journal further under his nose.
Professor Achebe was concluding her lesson, but Draco’s brain was already running trough what they had discussed during the hour.
The air, though, was charged with unease. Even with the extent of magic, people did not simply disappear. If Git McNobody, second year Ravenclaw and best friend of “Hogwarts, A History”, had suddenly stopped showing up, the whole ordeal would have probably gone unnoticed to all but Madam Pince.
Draco could feel the room bursting with anticipation but the Dark Lord didn’t supply further explanation. He just looked at the unconscious woman  with a mix of contempt and amusement and then to the door, that opened to let two cloaked figures enter the room.
“She is meddling, Ellen is.” Potter commented, shaking his head fondly. “I assume you know that at the moment I am only looking to cover the rest of Summer, as my better half has left me unexpectedly stranded. I mean, the contract gets renewed in September, so if it works…” he babbled, stopping as Draco put his hand up in front of his chest.
He could hear people in the corridor, voices lost in the tumult of the battle. The sound of an explosion echoed trough the walls, shaking the stone structure like it was a castle made of cards. Like it could break and collapse at any point.
Of course, despite his proficiency in potion, anxiety had gotten the best of him. To add insult to injury, he had lost to an almost equally desperate Granger, whose draught had been a sad purple and far from perfect. Draco had been grateful his father was in prison for that.
I think I am having a writer block so I hope this doesn’t suck as much as I fear it does. I think the problem is the huge quantity of dialogue and trying to make it run smoothly.
“My father”. The other boy said, shaking his head violently, as if trying to wake up from a bad dream.
“Come over to the right side, Draco, and we can hide you more completely than you can possibly imagine. What is more, I can send members of the Order to your mother tonight to hide her likewise. Your father is safe at the moment in Azkaban. . . . When the time comes, we can protect him too. Come over to the right side, Draco . . . you are not a killer. . . .”
But while Lily Evans already seemed to know that the sorting could not taint their relationship, Snape struggled to separate his friendship and the influence of some of his house members. So Draco watched as the boy’s pull towards the Dark Arts eventually set them apart. There was something, in Lily’s strong, unwavering sense of what was right. She cared about him, but she would not excuse him for his actions, for the way he treated others. And when he chose not to see outside of the limiting four walls he had built in his mind, when he decided to follow those people that raised themselves above others, above people like her, he lost her. And then he realised, too late, he had made the biggest mistake of his life.
He gestured for Draco to follow and they moved past the cozy looking lounge, stopping in front of an open door. With a familiarity that must have come from a more than comfortable friendship, Draco watched as the Muggle poked his head through, hanging lazily with an arm around the frame.
They thanked the driver with few words and a roll of cash. Harry stood awkwardly at the side, a backpack slung across one shoulder and his new red luggage gripped firmly in the other hand.
A van honked by, diverting his gaze to the flashy vehicle advertising Christmas deals. It was only September and the end of the year seemed so far away.
Dumbledore stood in front of him, dignified and poised even while looking like a drained old man. A year-long effort, coming to an end, whatever that was going to be. Did he have it in him? Draco knew the answer was no, and it felt strangely good, despite the implications. No, although, was not the right answer and Draco thought of his beautiful mother and tried to deny it. Tried to own to the task he so willingly and proudly and stupidity accepted what felt like a lifetime ago. He had to do it, this man in front of him, this wizard even the Dark Lord feared, looked like he was dying, anyway. He is a nutter, powerful but mad, and worthless and old, and honestly not looking too healthy, he chanted in his head. His mother wasn’t old, and she was worth it, Potter said it had to be worth it. And it was, but was it enough to murder? To take a life? He thought randomly of Potter’s mother. He had seen a picture of her, by chance, in his third year and to his surprise she was beautiful, too, like his mother, and so, so young. Her large, green and expressive eyes were so caring and loving, and mesmerised he had found himself thinking about what it would have been to lose someone like that. Unsettled, he had proceeded to taunt Potter about it. The thought was sickening, the love for his own mother twisting his insides with guilt. Lily Evans had died because it was worth it, would he be able to kill for the same reason?
“But why? I don’t think you will kill me Draco” and he sounded so sure Draco wanted to believe him, so he found himself answering the questions about the cabinet, stalling for time, or maybe for a way out.
I’m not sure this chapter is any good and I’m not rereading it but I feel the story will never progress if I don’t just go for it and get it out. I will probably correct all the many mistakes later. Thank you for reading ❤️
The bartender gave him a long, hard stare “Young man, it’s a start. But if you want to stay in my establishment, you’ll have to order a drink”.
His body tensed painfully, each muscle screaming for him to turn away, but he couldn’t advert his eyes.
Chewing on the tender skin between his fingers and nails until raw was a habit he had developed during summer and one his mother would have been appalled at, had she not been absorbed in other matters, like his impending death sentence.
“Don’t tell me you have never wished you could start afresh?” The other man’s eyes glinted yellow in the pale light of the lounge, effectively holding Draco’s gaze in their own.
Harry nodded around a mouth full of grapes, “Thanks, I mean it. I honestly have no idea where to start. I feel a little foolish, really, but. . . I don’t know. It has been my dream for a while.”
Draco swallowed, wondering if that was how Muggleborns felt when they first arrived at Hogwarts. It was overwhelming. “Er, tap water.”
Weasley’s furious voice joined Potter, and Greg was lifted up into the air. Draco felt his own arms around a thin waist, and thanked the sheer luck and the brave heart of a boy who did what was right and not what was easy. Potter was a magnificent flyer and Draco wanted to reach the sky. For a moment he forgot about fire and danger and remembered the Quidditch pitch on sunny days, the adrenaline of the challenge. A worthy opponent, he had secretly liked that. The smoke filled his lungs, making him feel dizzy, and he gripped the other boy harder. He could feel Potter’s ribs under his fingers and dug into the soft spot under the cage, just a thin fabric separating flesh from flesh. Draco felt the fleeting need to touch skin before realising Potter had changed course.
Theo’s mother had died when he was only three, and his father had always been a strict, cold man. But there was Stephen, Theo’s older brother and for a long time they had been enough for each other. That was, until Stephen had joined the Death Eater along with Draco, the summer before. And got himself killed, the night of the raid to get Potter, Draco’s brain reminded him, and a wave of shame shook him. He didn’t even send an owl.
And then, when back at school with other wizards and witches, people like Draco would make them feel as they didn’t belong, they weren’t deserving.
Draco wanted to tell him just that. He wanted to lie through his teeth and claim he could do it without a hint of guilt, that it would be like kicking dead meat anyway.
It took a moment for Draco to understand what the other boy meant. Today the families of the victims were invited to the opening of the Gardens. It would be a private little affair, out of respect. The Gardens would be available to the public in the summer, once the students had returned at home, for a open donation to a fund that would take care of the costs of repairs and support for the one affected by the war. During the ceremony the relatives, and friends that wanted to, would be given some seed to plant in the four empty lots around the pond, in the name of the people they wanted to remember. The students had chosen an array of wildflowers, to give a natural and unconfined feeling to the place. The fertiliser, a combination of ageing and strengthening potions with an everlasting elixir, would assure the immediate blooming of the seeds and the lasting of the flowers so that the Gardens would always appear in season.
Vincent’s knee, bouncing with expectant energy. With gleeful anticipation. Draco dug his nails in his own knees and swallowed the bile.
His legs were tangled in sheets and cotton shorts, the green t-shirt drenched in sweat. The other boy’s clothes hadn’t strangled him in his sleep, and, even from an ocean away,  Potter couldn’t do anything right.
“She would have loved you spoiled”. Draco assured, knowing that his friend was thinking of what would have been of his brother had their mother raised him instead, but not quite sure if Theo was ready to go there.
“What are you doing here?” He asked, a bit bewildered. He had always thought Harry was set on being an Auror and, when the boy hadn’t returned the night before with most of the others, it had confirmed his beliefs.
“You look a bit young for coffee.” She commented, before placing a tall mug next to the plate anyway. It was followed by a glass of orange juice and a little bowl of fruit salad.
Vincent and Greg were getting restless. “C’mon! I can her ‘em”, Vincent said refreshing his Disillusionment charm.
Lupin winced at the last request, but Draco knew he couldn’t relent. He just had to make sure she was safe.
Draco was back in the Great Hall, listening to one of the Ravenclaws, a tall brunet called Boot, yelling the story of how the Golden Trio escaped Gringotts riding a dragon.
To an outsider, the school would have appeared the same, but Draco was a witness of how things had truly changed and with them his role within Hogwarts. The dynamics had switched and he was no longer at the top of the food chain, nor he wanted to be. Used to be at the centre of the attention, he was now a silent observer of the little acts of bravery and revolution that were happening around him. Filch’s wishes to bring back corporal discipline had been answered and the Carrows didn’t show any remorse for inflicting pain to even the smallest of pupils. Detentions reached a new level of punishment, just short of torture. The youngest students were terrified to do anything that could land them chained up or cursed, while the fifth years and up tried to put on their brave faces and often took the blame to protect them.

The money was even enough to open a small bank account in Evan’s name, something to keep him going for a while. He had no doubts Harry would find a way to sustain himself; a lot of muggle kids travelled around the world for work experience, these days. In Evan’s mind, the account was a little inheritance left by his parents, to access when he came of age.
Draco’s thoughts whirled around the idea of a Harry Potter that didn’t even know who he was, that had no idea the two of them had despised each other for five years and counting. A Harry Potter that had never once wondered about him in the long year during which Draco’s mind was often drifting to his last encounter with the prat.
“They surely don’t give a good first impression” he said, in lieu, nodding in the direction of the creatures.
He observed the boy’s profile against the glass, haloed in the soft light of rain mixed with speed, and tried to catch any sign of nervousness. Any indication that maybe this wasn’t the right decision after all. That, maybe, he should call this insane plan off and just take Harry back to where he belonged.
I think I have known since you and Theo were little. Only, just recently I have matured enough to accept it, and for that I am sorry. Parents need growing up too, so I hope you will forgive me.
The sky was dark when he finally stumbled out of the Room of Hidden Things, shutting the door and feeling it disappear behind his back. Two girls giggled with the grace of Vincent and Greg and Draco let his head thump against the hard stone, wanting to laugh hysterically until he was a crumpled mess on the floor.
“I’m wandless” he said, putting his hands up in front of his face, open and palms facing the other two students. “I didn’t do it”.
With that assurance in mind, he soared towards the unknown, hoping that for once things were going to work out. When his lips met Harry’s midair, the future tasted of pumpkin juice and promises, and Draco was flying.
Everything was so clear and sharp that he had to ponder if he had actually ever looked at a place so well to impress all of its tiny details in his mind, like Dumbledore seemed to have done with the office.  Maybe it was something the human brain always did, take photographs and then store them so deep into its recesses that it was impossible to remember them without the aid of magic. It was a weird concept, of remembering without noticing, but one that Draco had considered before during his idealistic dreams of becoming a mind healer. Dreams that had been trampled down a long time before.
“Mhmm.” She hummed, her focus shifting back to Scott “This is Dean, by the way. Scott, Dean. Dean, Scott.”
“It’s complicated. For once, there is going to be a major outrage if he even agrees to. . . Uhm, date me —“ he finally said, but Theo interrupted him with a growl.
“You know, I keep thinking that he should have his father there with him. Instead, he only has me” Harry’s voice was broken, and Draco found that he didn’t like it. The Gryffindor always sounded annoyingly strong.
“It’s not going to be exactly difficult to find employment with my name, is it?” The other wizard replied, somewhat bitterly. “To be fair, I am not sure what I want to do. We kind of discussed teaching. . .” He scratched the back of his neck shyly, and Draco found himself nodding encouragingly. “But yeah, I think I want to travel a bit. Take care of Teddy. . . See stuff, you know —“ He trailed off.
Potter had shaken his hand, he registered hysterically, before telling himself to get a grip already.
“Some will, yeah. Some people always will” the other boy conceded “But most won’t. It’s a happier time, and lots of students would want to just enjoy their life now that they can without bigger worries. . . Plus the majority of them were there last year, with the Carrows. They know you weren’t really into it”.
It was the third day into the holidays when an house elf interrupted his family’s afternoon tea in one of the Manor’s fanciest drawing rooms to announce they had guests at the door. His mind was partially engaged by thoughts of Luna, so he barely acknowledged his mother’s worried expression when she left the room to tend to the visitors.
“There are only two rooms, though. Where is yours?” He asked Scott, recalling the way Ellen had called him Potter’s roommate, or something.
“The most fortunate” Draco agreed cheerfully “So, what brings you here in such a cold autumnal day, all brooding and mysterious?”
Potter gave him a funny look, then just shrugged in acquiescence, rising to his feet. Conscious that under no circumstances he could be left alone to do whatever the fuck the other boy had asked him to do, without giving away how suspiciously clueless he actually was, Draco panicked, scrambling to follow.
And then Harry was hugging him. It was brief and a little stiff, but it took all his strength not to hold on and never lose his grip.
Flares of a long tamed jealousy prickled under his skin, feeding his anger like gasoline. He wanted to destroy. He wanted to break this man that loved Potter so much it was revolting.
Outraged and panicked Draco tried to deny it “It was. I worked all year on this and tonight...”. A yell from below dragged his mind back to the battle happening beneath them, and the blood that could be spilling thanks to him. Because of him.
“Maybe” Draco admitted. If there had been more time. “When I finally accepted that I couldn’t do it, I wondered how Snape could. Kill, without a flinch. I didn’t understand. . .”
Draco realised now that war for the children of Hogwarts, these scared kids before him, had been like that swan for his four years old self. A concept so big, so abstract when reality was there in front of them but still looking so perfect, so unbroken, that it didn’t fully hit. The swan was still beautiful, so Draco had listen to words of pain and finality but his heart stayed light because if death looked so perfect maybe it wasn’t so bad at all.
It was a sleek, deep burgundy Jaguar dated from the late fifties and, as little as he knew about cars, it had been his grandfather's pride and joy when he was alive.  It was a little precious memory from his youth that he had never had the heart to part from. But, a sports car that beautiful was of no use rotting in a garage and, with only a smidge of regret, he had handed the keys over to the new owner, telling himself that it was what his old man would have wanted. He didn’t have a driving licence, anyway.
“Sure is!” The Muggle conceded, sounding deeply amused. “I do wonder what is going on with your country, though, as this one over here invokes Merlin every time he is nervous or flustered. We thought he was obsessed with the Sword in the Stone but turned out he was as ignorant about Disney as an Amish would be. So, unfortunately, he is just a weirdo.”
Dumbledore closed his eyes, the world fading around him until Draco could only see his lips moving “You need to find him, and when you do you- you need to tell him. Harry Potter is the only one that can defeat Voldemort. Moreover, I came to the conclusion that to do so, and t-this is quite important Severus. . . ” his voice shook, silver lashes glistening with tears “He must be willing to die at his hand”.
He rubbed at his eyes, finally forcing them open. The first thing he noticed in the haze was a soft purple light coming through the window, casting the scarce furnishing in long shadows. Dusk.
It was on the spur of the moment that, after finding the shards of Sirius’ two way mirror in Harry’s trunk, he had decided to encase two small, round pieces in the void of the owl’s eyes.
In spite of what was expected, most of the Slytherin in Draco’s year had returned, making six of them when Pansy had joined the two girls and three boys already at the castle. Even with Pansy and Tracy not taking the NEWTS class for Defence, the boys and Daphne had been merged with the group of eight from the year below, making them in every way Seventh year students. Due to the increased number of pupils in the new combined system, the NEWTS periods, that normally included all four Houses, had been separated into two. That’s how the Slytherins came to share Defence Against the Darks Art with the Hufflepuffs.
Draco heartbeat slowed as he took a deep breath and then another. It had taken him a whole two weeks to compose the letter to his parents and three days awaiting for the response. He wasn’t sure what he had expected. Part of him had known they had chosen family over everything, and it was likely that they would eventually do it again.
“Very well” Professor Achebe said, turning her attention back to the class “I am actually glad for Mister Smith’s intervention, as it demonstrate how the rule of thinking before acting doesn’t apply only to physical attacks. You are at an age in which you should understand well that grouping people under categories based on a few examples is detrimental. No two snowflakes are alike, after all”.
“Draco, no one would care” reassured Luna. She put a gentle hand on his shoulder and he felt like crying.
“Hello?” he demanded, when the greasy man behind the counter didn’t do as much as lifting his eyes from the screen in front of him.
The other boy gave him a calculating gaze “Yeah. . . If you connect them together they form the constellation of the Cancer. Trelawney said it’s a sign of bad omen”.
Draco cut him off, venom dripping from every word “You have no idea. . . NO idea, Theo, of what the fuck you are talking about. So, save your precious pity talk for someone that actually needs it!”
Lupin sat on the armchair opposite him, grey streaked hair and grey cardigan against grey fabric. He created an almost toneless image, like an old, time faded photograph, if not for the violently pink journal resting on his lap. Draco thought it better not to ask about that. Lupin’s wand was still trained on the journal’s pages but his long suffering expression told Draco that the other wizard must have been observing him quietly for a while.
Thoughts of his mother only made him sadder, and he glanced up at the other boy. Yes, it had been a shock to learn about Potter’s past but in that very moment Draco knew it made a strange sort of sense. Now that he had seen the other boy truly relaxed and carefree, he wondered how he could have missed the signs of melancholy that always featured behind his ex schoolmate’s reserved smiles. Not that they had known each other all that well, after all. Neither had bothered, caught up in their mutual dislike.
All the eyes at the table darted towards the boy. Draco grabbed his knee and tried to squeeze it in warning, but Theo batted him away.
When his wand started buzzing insistently next to his ear just a few hours later, he was unfortunately still 17, still wrapped in Potter’s clothes and, worst of all, he still had a flight to catch.
Draco thanked her politely, expecting her to go. He was starving and the food looked the most tempting he had seen in ages. Despite his expectations, the woman stayed, hovering by the table and observing him with blatant curiosity.
At least, as familiar as one could be after Lupin’s three-days drilling on Muggle technology. This particular sort was something he had admittedly heard about in the past, snippets of conversations drifting over from the Ravenclaw table, where Muggleborns and Halfbloods had been mourning the so called commodities of their home lives, as if Magic was lacking something. Not that Draco had ever been interested in learning about Muggles rudimental forms of entertainment, or that he would have understood them after all, but moving images were not a foreign concept and he never really thought it so clever as those Ravenclaws had made it out to be.
After they left Draco searched for Luna, but she was staring at Macmillan. The Hufflepuff shrugged “It was the truth”.
“Yes, I thought you knew. He said you knew! I met him a bit ago, he told me about the snake, he said you guys had a mission”.
“I’ve been Harry Potter the Boy Who Lived, Harry Potter the Liar, the Deluded Orphan, Dumbledore’s Pawn and the Ministry’s Poster Boy, Harry Potter the Undesiderable Number One and the freaking Saviour of the Wizarding World nonsense. I think the time to be Harry Potter the Boy that Does the Fuck He Wants is well overdue”
Obviously they had their ups and down, like everybody else. Little obstacles in the everyday life they were building as a couple. Sometimes big obstacles.
“That so?” The other man countered, showing a hint of teeth, but he didn’t press it further. “Well then, if you have everything packed -“.
After two weeks without a sighting of that ridiculous bird’s nest and the body attached to it, it seemed like the world had tilted on its axis, spiralling into a reality that tried to be the same but didn’t quite manage so.
“But we do belong here, Draco. This is rightfully ours, we were born into it!” Pansy sounded stubborn, as if trying to hold onto a slippery surface, afraid to discover what would greet her if she was to let go.
Draco thought about it. After a while he replied “Being a Slytherin didn’t help me during the war. It didn’t matter, I was expandable. . . And then those people that I always considered below me and treated likewise, gave me a chance. I guess I just want to see where that chance takes me. Maybe I want to be more than just a Slytherin, too”.
“I know, I just can’t help thinking about what could go wrong”. Lots of things could, Draco was aware, and his self preservation sense was ringing alarm bells so loud that he could barely hear his own thoughts.
