Whatever it was, it was their secret.
“What was it that made him odd exactly?” Draco snapped, unable to keep the hurt out of his voice. He knew he was being petulant, but it was damned hard to keep his cool when the potion was working to bring all these emotions to the forefront in order to protect him. “Was it simply that he was interested in me, or was it something else that I didn’t pick up on since I’m a terrible Auror and you’re the next coming of Merlin?”
“Can I make a suggestion about which piece to remove next?” Harry asked, lowering his voice to a sultry whisper. “Because I have some ideas.”
“Malfoy, honestly. It’s been a month. All you’ve done is cast a few stupid wandless spells and annoy me into oblivion. This whole act is getting a bit tired.”
“Watch it,” Malfoy snapped at someone in the line next to them as they bumped his elbow. He recoiled from the touch, pulling into himself like a scared hermit crab. He took three deep breaths, then looked straight ahead.
One night, when the heat of summer and finals had finally settled in, Harry arrived at the pitch a few minutes late. It was bad enough that the whole school was more focused on figuring out what was going on between them than they were on finals, but now Harry had to actually really try hard to sneak to the pitch to avoid Hermione’s sleuthing skills. She had taken to staking out the common room, so Harry had to use the invisibility cloak and a number of silencing charms to get out.
I didn’t know what she meant. These were the first visions I’d had that weren’t planted into my head by Voldemort. She couldn’t mean those could she? Hardly anyone knew about that outside of the Order. “Do you mean the visions Voldemort placed in my mind when he felt like hurting me?”
“How about I say something awkward to level the playing field then?”
Neville, who didn’t have on a proper coat, hugged his middle, and said, “Earth to Harry?”
“Isn’t it though?” Malfoy tugged my hand this time, bringing our faces so close I could feel his breath on my lips. “At least part of you likes the danger or else you wouldn’t throw yourself into it face first every single time.”
Auror Read had the grace to look embarrassed and put his hand down.
“We’ll be back.” Harry smiled and then said, “Malfoy Manor.”
I raised my hand, cutting him off. “Let’s not have this conversation again. You know where I stand and I know where you stand.” I downed the last of my coffee and stood up.
“Yes, I really do .”
So whenever Harry tried a Wronski Feint, or a Sloth Grip Roll, Draco would counter with a Wrights’ Dive, or Plumpkin’s Pull. One time in particular, Harry had been so enraptured by Draco’s movements and the ease with which he transitioned from a dive to an upward spiral that he completely forgot the snitch and instead, attempted a Wronski Feint that spiraled into a Trinkets Table just to challenge Draco into doing more tricks.
In a fit of rage that billowed up from inside Draco like a volcano erupting after years of dormancy, he backhanded Granger—
“I suppose you think he should have been interested in you, right? Like all the other people on the planet who are star struck whenever they see ‘
“What’s not to love?” Ron asked, but it wasn’t the kind of question I needed to answer so I didn’t.
“Now who’s being the twat?”
Since I slept in the office, I needed to run home to Grimmauld Place and change. The only thing I had on that didn’t look ruined from sleeping at my desk was my tie and I would have changed that anyway. It had little snitches on it and didn’t feel appropriate for where I was heading. Too whimsical.
Draco nodded. “I can relate.”
“Why didn’t I know?” I asked, already knowing the answer.
—shorts.
Suddenly the very drunk Harry Potter that accosted him in the bathroom made much more sense. Draco wasn't sure if he was relieved or not to find it was not in his mind and that Potter had actually said those things to him.
Outside, the winter air was crisp, and Harry couldn’t help but think he should have grabbed a coat. Just as he was about to say something, Draco pulled his wand out and cast a warming charm over them. The magic tingled along his skin like a summer breeze.
kill me properly the first time.
When they were hidden by the crowd, Draco dropped Harry’s hand and said, “Eww, you touched my stomach.”
The line in the portkey station was long. It seemed a lot of people were heading out of the city today. We were tucked in line between some family whose kids wouldn't stop staring and pointing at us and an elderly couple who didn’t seem to care who we were. The ropes separating the lines were purple velvet wit gold accents. The sign over the line we were in flashed Hogsmeade Station in bright gold letters.
“Then what has kept you from your duties?”
“It’s dangerous.”
Draco looked over his shoulder, nervously checking that no one was eavesdropping. “Do we really need to talk about this right now?”
“No way, if I have to play, so does he,” Granger asserted, her words slurring together slightly. She gave him a positively smug look after and leaned forward.“Fair’s fair, mon cher.”
She was stark naked, but she wasn’t beautiful any longer. The long raven hair was now a stringy white, and it hung around her face like vines. Her once perfect, supple skin was gray and wrinkled. It sagged off her bones. Her breasts hung like rotten fruit on a thin tree branch. But it was her eyes that were most unsettling. They were the putrid yellow of bile with no pupil. They seemed to glow in the darkness of the mausoleum. And they were trained on Harry.
“Oh, well, no,” Draco said, clearing his throat. He was determinedly not looking at Harry now.
It was Malfoy, of course. He and Seamus were friends now thanks to their shops being side by side in Hogsmeade. I forgot and hadn’t counted on seeing him here. Add that to the list of things I couldn’t possibly deal with today.
“Tomorrow,” Luna answered and then turned her attention once again to the pigeon who was still perched on the windowsill.
“I can’t just jump like this, Harry.” Draco grabbed Harry’s waist, pulling him closer to stand between his legs. Harry felt his heart pounding, trying to break out of his rib cage and fly away from this conversation. Draco pulled him down into a kiss. It was soft, unsure. Draco whispered against his lips. “I just need a little more time to think about all the possibilities, the consequences.”
She looked at me and in her eyes I could see every little thing I’d ever done wrong to her looking back at me. Each time I showed up to a date drunk, if at all. Every argument about my behavior, my choices, my rashness. All the times she begged me to get help and I told her she had no right to tell me how to heal. I felt guilt like I’d never felt it before.
“I’m glad we totally agree on that then,” Harry said, not sure if he was relieved or disappointed that Draco didn’t seem more interested in the idea of them being romantically involved—seeing as Harry’s mind had finally acknowledged the crush Ron had been claiming he’d had for the last few months.
“This is bigger than possible third ears, Parkinson. A woman died last night. I was there, I couldn’t stop it because of that thing's stupid powers. I won’t sit around while it takes another life.”
…I want to kiss you.”
“Say that whatever you find out, I get to report on exclusively once everyone is safe of course.”
Potter, still pinching his nose, laughed. “Fuck. Remind me to never underestimate Parkinson’s warnings again. I mean, she said it would make us touch-sensitive, but Merlin’s tits, even leaning on this wall feels overwhelming.”
Pansy gave him a long suffering look. “Promise me you’ll be safe.”
“Come off it. Everyone is good at parties. Just got to get a bit more whiskey in you and you’ll be singing the pirate jaunts along with Seamus in no time.”
“Hello, Draco,” Granger cut in between the laughter. “I assume Harry is also forcing you to play this insipid game?”
A cackle worthy of any hook-nosed witch rolled up out of her. “Help me?”
The line moved up slowly. I switched the present to my other arm and hoisted it back into place. “Did they say how many people were coming?”
Neville cracked a smile and looked less freaked out. Then his eyes lit up and he said, “If you want, I can set you up with this bloke I met at a Herbology conference in France?”
Harry writes the letter for Draco and is in Denial. Ginny comes in and he hides it. Hermione comes to visit.
“You—you’re so beautiful,” Harry whispered. It wasn’t what he had meant to say—he had meant to ask Draco why all of a sudden he refused a rematch.
“I am,” Draco said, moving to get off Harry’s lap, but Harry stopped him, gripping his hips. Draco looked down at him. “Harry?”
“Well, that was a dud, Luna,” Girl Weasley said. She opened her arms out for a hug and Luna walked over to her and snuggled in. “Bless her, she tries.” Girl Weasley added before kissing Luna on the forehead.
“The what?” Draco asked. He couldn't stop himself from blurting it out and cutting Luna off. She didn’t seem phased by it at all. In fact, she seemed eager for Draco to understand. She leaned forward on her toes and raised her brow waiting for someone to answer him.
“That depends.”
“Potter, why are you undressing?” Draco asked, completely scandalized. His mouth hanging open. A slight blush coloring his cheeks.
There was something about his voice that gave Harry pause. In all their years of fighting and whatever this was now, he wasn’t quite sure he had ever heard Draco sound so hopeful but Harry couldn’t let himself linger on exactly what Draco had hoped. If he did, he might screw it up.
“What is
There were a few quiet murmurs as Aurors looked through their files. Malfoy shot Harry a withering stare that seemed to say ‘mess it up
“Well, hello then,” Neville said. He kept looking over his shoulder at the forest like he was waiting for something to happen, but when he caught me watching him, he stopped. “I’ll come back up with you. I think I need some refreshments. Yeah?”
“You’re not drunk.” It was a statement. It wasn’t the first time she held my face in her hands, checking to see how drunk I was, but it was the first time she did so and I wasn’t drunk, and she seemed shocked.
Nikola, managing to undo Draco’s trousers, was slowly pulling them to pool around his ankles. Again, it hit him that Potter was there—watching. He felt his cock twitch at the thought and then hot breath was ghosting over his groin.
Harry rolled his eyes at Ron. “Not this again. I solve cases. I get the bad guy in the end, isn’t that what matters most?”
Draco felt his mouth hang open at the comment. He was wearing a traditional dress robe. Yes, it was a bit on the elegant side—more for a charity function than a school ball, but he liked the silver gray color of it and the small buttons that went all the way down the front. “This is the appropriate dress for a formal ball,” Draco reminded him, “I didn’t think to change before coming here, unlike some people.”
There was no good way to barge in on a Succubus as it siphoned the Life Energy out of a human victim. There was, as far as Harry could tell, only one way in and one way out. There were no windows to see inside, so all that was left was to open the door and walk inside. Easy as pie.
Harry nodded. “But I will pass my NEWT’s with flying colors and you will get to brag that you succeeded where Hermione failed. You tutored the Un-tutorable.”
Frustrated, Draco said, “You know, you wouldn’t need to make such a mess if you’d just use my system.” He didn’t look at Potter as he pulled his chair out to sit. He gathered the fabric of his robes and made sure to sit so there would be no wrinkles.
Draco uses this opportunity to see if the sexual tensions he fells about Potter are all in his head.
“Ooh, I have one,” Luna said. She walked to Potter’s side, pulled him down to her level and whispered something to him. All the while, she was bouncing back and forth from one foot to the other. Her excitement was palpable. The rest of the group watched with smiles on their faces; some good natured, others, in Draco’s mind, seemed smug.
“Oh, do shut up.” Malfoy flicked his wand, whispered the spell to seal the box, and within the blink of an eye, the Succubus was sucked into the Lock Box where she would spend the rest of her immortality, trapped. Looks like she managed to find that loophole after all.
Inside the cemetery grounds, I was overwhelmed by the scene I saw in front of me, so it was easy to push aside the feeling in my gut at seeing Malfoy smile. There were swirls of magic hovering over almost every grave. Most were different shades of white and blue. There were other smaller patches of color low to the ground. Some traces hung in the air like an awning. In between all the other colors, there was the gray ambient magic Malfoy mentioned.
It started innocently enough. Potter asked to be his potions partner at the start of term. Draco said no. He planned to lay low until the end of the year and being Potter’s partner would not allow him to do that.Yet, Potter insisted he needed the help. He relentlessly bothered Draco until he agreed. After a few late night study sessions, Draco found himself
Harry took one hand, gripped the front of Draco’s shirt slowly pulling him back so their faces were inches away. “Tomorrow, I will kiss you again when we are sober if it makes you feel better about this, but I promise I am going to enjoy it just as much.” He flicked his tongue out to brush Draco’s lips lightly before releasing his hand from Draco’s shirt.
The last thing I wanted to do today was mingle at a garden party and pretend that everything was a-okay, but it was Dean and Seamus. “Do I need to dress up?”
The look on her face was priceless. She was speechless and somber and incensed all that the same time. She tilted her head back and took the shot. Potter watched gleefully. He seemed much more in control of himself than he had in the privy and Draco wondered if he had imagined the interaction all together.
When they reached the Floos, Potter turned to face him. “There is one thing I wanted to talk about before we go back.”
She nodded knowingly. Harry had been in trouble a few times for forgetting to file reports. “You must have gotten up extra early to be up before me. I missed you in bed when I woke up.”
I grabbed my travel mug Ron got me for my birthday last year, very proud that he went to a muggle store with muggle money and bought me a muggle contraption. It had a lion on it, which he reasoned was close enough to Gryffindor. The coffee only helped so much, but I knew Hermione would have a hangover potion waiting for me when I stepped through her floo.
“Mother insisted on hanging it,” Draco found himself saying.
. He was sure to lose tonight’s match if he kept on that line of thought.
When they were standing less than a foot apart, Hermione and Parkinson, in unison, said, “Ready, set, seduce!”
Draco, feeling practically naked in Potter’s clothes, followed him out of the bathroom. There was an angry looking Durmstrang girl hopping from foot to foot. She scowled at them and mutter “bloody Potter, of course,” under her breath and slammed the door behind herself.
, Draco thought. Not that the wizard way would work either since the charm keeping his magic at bay was cast by the Dark Lord himself.
“How about we make it two times then?”
Malfoy looked over his shoulder. When he was satisfied no one was around he took out his wand, cast a muffliato charm and a notice-me-not and leaned down. “We said it was a fluke, Potter. One time because we were drunk.”
“I said I would.”
I didn’t move. I stared at Greyjoy, debating. Her mention of more frequent visions gave me pause. How could it not after all the visions I’d had in the last week? I didn’t trust her, but she was a seer and that meant if anyone could help me understand the visions I was having, it was her. I didn’t have time to overthink what I was about to say. I needed information fast. No one else was going to die because of my inaction.
Outside in the garden I could see nearly every good friend I ever had standing in small clumps, drinking from champagne flutes and laughing or smiling. It took everything in me not to run the second I stepped out of the house, arm linked with Hermione. There was a layer of pleasantness blanketing the affair. That sort of afterglow feeling you get when you fall asleep outside in the summer and wake up with your eyes bleary and the sun warming your face. A soft comfort that threatened to dissipate the second you opened your eyes too wide.
a drink, let alone having the audacity to sip at it.
This one hurt to write, so heads up.
“Explain,” I said once the floo was locked and the wards on the house were checked and double-checked. The only other living being that could get in the house was Kreacher and he wasn’t here now.
“Black, like smoke. It starts here and then there is a trail to the forest.” I pointed to the spot in the tree line where the black disappeared behind the foliage.
With an exasperated look to match only Hermione’s, Malfoy said, “As many time as it takes to be sure you aren’t a complete dunce.”
Pansy’s face went slack and then suddenly she was smirking and looking all-together too satisfied. It seemed Harry had stepped right into her trap. She even rubbed her hands together like a villain in the movies. At full volume, not a yell, but loud enough for the small crowd that gathered to hear, Pansy asked, “Are you fucking Ron’s brother? The dragon tamer?”
I know, I know. Smut in chapter 2? So soon? Yes. Harry uses sex to numb himself. It’s gonna happen more.
Harry tried, but he couldn’t help the laugh that escaped him. “Do you really want me to answer that?”
“Fuck. Cock. Shite,” Harry cursed. Of course this would make him look bad. Of course it would make things worse, “I didn’t even think about that.”
“Yes, okay. I see your point. But, how can he not see that I’m attracted to him? For fucks sake, I look at him constantly. I really thought it was obvious. We flirt all the time, at least, I flirt. You and Ginny sure figured it out,” Harry whined, something he was doing more and more often in the last week. He slumped back the chair an crossed his arms like a child who had been denied desert.
“Well, yes. That was the first time I admitted to myself that I was attracted to a man. However, it wasn’t the first man I was attracted to,” Harry added on the last part cryptically. He wondered if Luna knew who he had been attracted to in Hogwarts, too. Harry also wondered how obvious he he had been and if he’d always been this easy to read.
“You tell me,” Potter said and dragged Draco’s hand down his chest. Draco felt the slight curve of his pec and the subtle bump of his abdomen as Potter pulled it down further. He watched, frozen as Potter guided his hand down past his belt to the now evident bulge in his trousers. “Does this feel serious to you?”
She had a point. If something went wrong, it would be on her, and like Draco, Pansy had spent the better part of the last five years undoing all the damage her family and the war had done. Nothing mattered to her more than regaining some semblance of a reputation.
“Look, Malfoy, really, that’s not even close to what I meant. I only meant he was an odd bloke. The way he was talking to you like he knew you just because he reads the articles. Those people freak me out.” Potter sounded calmer suddenly, all the anger gone from his voice. “I never said that it was odd that he found you attractive, or that you aren’t worthy. Honestly, it would have been odd if he didn’t find you attractive. I mean, shite, just look at you. You should hear what everyone at the DMLE says about you. Half the secretaries swoon whenever you pass them. Everyone thinks you’re good-looking.”
Draco blanched. He’d been staring, he knew he’d been staring, but he couldn’t help himself. Potter looked wild, dangerous, with his hair mussed as it always was, and his jaw clenched in determination. “You memorised the Ley Lines in London? You know things about Ley Lines?”
Harry meets up with Hermione and Ron so they can all head to the party at Dean and Seamus’s house in Hogsmeade. Harry isn’t too thrilled but thinks that it will give him a good chance to follow up on Skeeter’s lead about magical surges.
Potter stood up out of his chair and leaned across their desks to snatch it out of his hand. “Merlin, you’re such a prick sometimes.”
“Like I said, it isn’t always clear at first.” Greyjoy moved toward her fire and poured out the rest of the tea over it. Smoke billowed up from the fire as it went out. “Come back to the castle with me. We can discuss it more.”
The bull pen was noisy. There were sounds of papers rustling, chairs being pushed out, and conversations being had. Each noise layered on top of one another to create the hum of an office mid-day. To Draco’s surprise, he found his partner at his desk rifling through files and making a mess of the system Draco had only just finished organising yesterday.
She pushed my hair out of my face and checked for a fever. “Merlin, you’re burning up, Harry.”
“Fine. Thank you, Daisy. You may go.”
“You’re beautiful, Draco,” he repeated, this time smirking at Draco they way he would if he caught the snitch seconds before Draco could. He hoped Draco understood the meaning—the unspoken part of it all that said:
Harry smiled. “Sorry, Gin.”
But I couldn’t tear my eyes away from the professor. She was small, short and wafer-thin. Her hair was graying and it was loose around her face. Some strands were knotted together in braids and adorned with silver trinkets. She gave Trelawney a run for her money with her thick purple-rimmed glasses and the flowing dress that made her look like an amorphous blob. When I didn’t turn away, she winked at me and then returned to her tea.
The Succubus laughed. It was comforting, and he wanted to listen to only that noise for the rest of his life. “Mmm, you mortals are so blind to your own Life Energy, your own desires. You would rather be alone than admit you want to be loved?”
“Indeed.”
fool. The Dark Lord reveals his plans to no one, let alone some Russian slag whose magic is like a hill to the mountain that is Lord Voldemort.”
Harry held his wand up despite the tremor in his hand. He pulled in a deep breath and hoped against all hope that he could cast off one more spell. The word barely formed in his mouth before she scooped up the victim, and bounded on him. He felt his head hit the ground before he knew what happened. Then everything went dark.
“Merlin, I love it when you say my name.”
Harry nodded. “Yes, like that. Or is there a section of grass that you can’t seem to keep green? Anything like that.”
Draco finally blinked, moved the book and parchment off his lap, leaned in close to Harry’s face, then kissed him greedily. Their mouths closed around one another, and they kissed until both of them were shaking.
At some point Harry was going to have to stop pacing and go inside. He knew that, but it didn’t stop him. The soft, idyllic piano music whispered through the garden from the greenhouse where the idle chatter of his friends felt more like a warning than a welcome.
Harry sighed. The potion made him feel like he was sinking and flying all at once, and it was distracting. He thought about it a moment and considered telling Malfoy he’d call for backup
“I’m terrified. Shaking in my boots, I am.”
“Now, we are playing a game and you have to play,” Potter said. He didn't turn to look at Draco when he spoke. Instead he looked at his group of friends with a wide smile on his face.
The only reason he knew she was still there was the occasional growl she let out when moving out of the way of a spell, and the pressure of her own magic as it worked itself on him, into him. He bit the inside of his cheek to stay focused, the pain helping him ignore how badly he wanted to lay down in the alley and let her finish him off. It wouldn’t be a bad death, really. He’d get to experience pleasure, unhampered by all his guilt. It would be like falling asleep on the beach in summer.
Once they finished talking, the line moved again, bringing them up to the front. They were next. Draco’s hand was still gripping Harry’s tightly, but he didn’t say anything, nor did he look at Harry. He kept his eyes on the small fire in front of them, about as wide across as a small round table. Easy enough to jump over.
Ron shrugged, sloshing his drink around. “Our futures. What else?”
He wore it whenever he felt he bested Harry. The posh prat was so confident that he threw Harry off his game by wearing tight—extremely tight and extremely revealing;
I nodded, slowly moving my head up and down. I still felt dizzy, but I felt some semblance of control coming back to me. I pushed thoughts of my mother
“In an adult?” That couldn’t be true. Obscurials were always kids. Always.
Mouth dry, Harry dropped his hands with more effort than he would ever admit and dusted off his robes. Malfoy did the same, though he hadn’t been kneeling in the dirt as Harry had.
The man shook once and released. “I’m Ned. I tend the grounds here. And you two are Aurors then?”
“Pretty much.”
Draco glided across the night sky—still as graceful as before only somehow more enticing, more entrancing. His movements were still the same, but Harry had trouble keeping his eyes from raking themselves up and down the length of Draco’s thighs. So pale. So firm. Harry felt his fingers twitching at the thought of running themselves up and down the soft inseam of his thighs.
This morning the putrid scent hung over him like a guillotine—threatening to end his life once and for all, if he would just give into the specter of the past. And he was tempted. More than he would admit to anyone, he was tempted.
I vaguely knew what potion they were talking about. Hermione mentioned it once before. Malfoy freelanced with the Ministry, working on new potions for them. His most recent invention was a magical traces potion that was more consistent and lasted longer than the spells. It also lit the traces up for easier, more discrete tracking. I’m sure once it was out of the testing phase, the DMLE would begin using it.
“It’s four in the morning,” I managed to say without slurring. “Who could possibly be here?”
“Me too. But it seems you weren’t too tired to tell Robards you didn’t want to be my partner anymore.” Potter stopped walking along the bookshelf and turned to face Draco. He smiled, a half-smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes.
Watching them, I felt a sort of emptiness tug at my gut like the feeling of free-falling on a broom before swiping back up. I swallowed hard. I wasn’t sure exactly why I felt a sudden urge to cry, but I felt overcome with emotion and not for the last time wished I hadn’t promised Hermione that I’d stay sober.
The Succubus let out a desperate scream that made Harry’s heart beat faster.
“Oh, I like it very much,” Harry muttered, thinking of all the very not studying things he wanted to do with Draco. He started humming the bridge of “Your Song” because he knew it made Draco smile. He sang it to him all the time, sometimes changing the lyrics about the eyes from “you see I’ve forgotten if they’re green or they’re blue” to “you see I’ve forgotten if they’re gray or they’re blue” to match Draco’s smokey eyes that always pulled him in like a black hole of lust.
The frigid part of him won out and he responded in a way he hoped would cease this increasingly suggestive conversation. “Frivolity by definition is meaningless. I prefer substance.”
Harry tried to focus on the task at hand, but the magic moving through him was distracting. It warmed his stomach as if he’d just finished off a hot cocoa near the fire. Then, as if hit with ice-cold water, he felt suddenly awake. He could feel every nerve ending. All the places his clothes touched his skin felt like someone was tickling him with feathers. He had to contain the resulting giggle.
I stopped at the embankment of the stream and leaned over to catch my breath, resting my hands on my knees. “Potion’s faded.”
Ron nodded. “True.” He shifted in his chair, scooting it closer to the table, and then laid his arms flat on the surface. He tried a soft smile, but then it shifted to a concerned look.
Behind him, Potter let out a breath that turned into a laugh. “Ha, yes. You’re the only other person in here with me.”
“I’m already here, Hermione. The guilt trip is no longer necessary.”
She was right of course, but Seamus and Dean hadn’t set their floo system up yet. They both worked in Hogsmeade; Dean for George, Ron’s brother, at the new Weasley Wizard Wheeze’s location and Seamus at his own Quidditch shop, so they rarely had use for it with everything in walking distance.
Then he spoke. “Un—unless you’ve told someone?”
Hermione nodded and after one more warning to make sure I wasn’t late, I headed out of the teacher’s lounge and down the long corridors of Hogwarts.
“She cares about you,” Ron said. “We all do.”
“No one knows,” Harry answered. He could feel Ginny’s body pressing against his side as she leaned her head down to rest on his shoulder. The tightness in his chest that had been winding itself tighter and tighter still all week, loosened a bit at Ginny’s tenderness.
“No one will talk. You know that right?” Potter’s eyes shone even more when he spoke like this. Like they were reacting to the prideful tone in his voice. Growing in intensity. “We would all rather die than help you and
Ned smiled. “It sounded much smoother in my head.”
“Sounds good, Draco.”
“Yes?”
The crowd erupted in applause. She and Ron were nearly as famous as I was, and that was very famous. Their names were household names. Their profiles in Skeeter’s book called them heroes in their own right. It was the one part of her book I didn’t hate.
“Merlin,” Malfoy said, rolling his eyes. “See, this is what everyone means when they say you’re hard to work with, you know? Is this really how it was when you and your little friends were off saving the world in school? You cook up part of a plan and then run head first into a dangerous situation, hoping for the best?”
“The moon is big,” Harry answered, though it wasn’t really an answer so much as observation.
“No, Father.”
“Gin, not here, yeah? Nev and Luna are celebrating. We can have it out about Draco later if you really want.”
“No?” Draco found himself amused. Any other headmaster would disapprove of this sort of underage debauchery even in death, but Kharkov seemed completely at ease. She watched the party and didn’t wince.
Draco fought against the spell. He struggled to form the words, but eventually he pushed through his father’s hold and asked the question he feared an answer to. “He—he wants it for Potter, doesn’t he?”
Draco cut Potter off before he could finish. “Yes, the potion was supposed to make us immune to the Succubus by amping up whatever attraction we already had for someone, like a sort of mental block. If you acknowledged those feelings, or accepted them, then the effects wouldn’t be as strong. Or at least, they would be strong, but you’d be able to control them. If you denied them, or they were being blocked somehow then it would be worse.”
She looked around the room, uncomfortably. Her eyes settled on a portrait of Sirius I had done after the war. He was in his animagus form, curled up and wagging his tail. “A mutual friend.”
“Does anyone know that we…” Harry cut himself off because he could hear the quiet desperation in his voice. It had been nagging at him for a while now, but he wasn’t sure how to put into words what he wanted to ask.
Potter let a sheepish grin spread across his face that nearly made Draco melt into his shoes. “Hermione, she, uh, she made me memorise it, and once something is up there,” he said pointing to his temple, “it stays. It was just lucky Ron and I were talking about it today, or I might not have noticed at all.”
“Is that why you ignored me the rest of the party then?” So much for not getting distracted. “You thought what? Ginny and I hooked up while her girlfriend was in the other room?”
Harry sighed. “I have plenty of hope for other people’s futures, not so much my own, so you’re safe.”
“White Rose Cemetery, but why is she trying to cast? Succubi can’t do magic the way we can. It’s part of what they give up. There’s no way a spell works for her even with the power boost of the Ley Lines.” Draco was surprised at how hoarse he sounded in the face of Potter’s excitement.
Work was tedious. Harry couldn’t get his mind off of just about a million things. Between the article denying his relationship with Ginny and his proclivity for liking men, Charlie's admission of feelings, and his own nerves about how to tell Draco he had feelings for him…well, Harry just didn’t care much for his paperwork.
“Sorry, yes, Father. I am,” Draco responded with his best smile. Though he had not heard what his father said, he was sure he could imagine it. The lectures he received lately always seemed to end on the same note:
“I am after an ingredient called swallow’s wing so I can brew a tea that will help quiet my visions. They have grown too frequent and I require sleep. Without the tea, I do not sleep. Without sleep, I am useless.”
Harry kept his eyes forward, watching the inky black surface of the lake ripple in the slight wind. He saw Draco out of his periphery, his smoke-gray eyes watching Harry with a quiet intensity. It made Harry’s heart pound faster. “I, uh, well, it’s complicated, and I’m probably going to sound whiny.”
Ron smiled at me. It was his ‘you’re not going to like this’ smile. “Yes, indeed. Hence why, when you were having
Malfoy looked at me and shrugged. He made his way over to the fire and sat down on a tree stump. “Professor Greyjoy, why are you so deep into the forest?”
“I swear to Merlin, if he doesn’t wake up,” Ron’s voice washed over me like a dream. He tugged at my arm and I felt him sliding my body to lean against the couch.
“He is welcome whenever he pleases,” Lucius replied and coughed to clear his throat. Since he was in the seat next to Draco, he also decided to elbow him in the ribs as if to say:
Potter nodded. “Oh, okay. Good, good.”
switched sides—losing his family in the process. Everyone was shocked when he did it and in the end, it helped them win the war. Though that didn’t seem to be enough for some people.
Sleep settled in over me and I let it drag me away. I had the strangest dreams while I slept. Sleeping draught always did that which is why I rarely take them. Too much like the dreams I had when Voldemort was alive. Somehow even without the draught, I had those odd, fragmented dreams. These were all about this huge stone, oozing black sludge. There was a man hunched over in front of it sobbing, but I couldn’t reach him.
“Rematch tomorrow?”
“I keep doing that.” Draco winced. In the mirror, he saw Potter standing behind him. He smiled at Draco. With great effort, Draco smiled back. The gentle sway of this ship reminded Draco that he was definitely not dreaming. He braced himself on the sink much like he’d done earlier when he was trying to talk himself into having fun. Well, here he was—trapped in a small bathroom with Potter breathing down his neck. For the second time that night, Draco wondered why this bathroom had to be so small.
“No, fresh out of those, too.”
Swiftly, Potter leaned in to whisper in Draco’s ear. “It was in the fine print. Always read the fine print.”
Harry’s eyes went wide at the last word. His heart quickened pace and he felt his mouth go a little dry. Instinctively, he licked his bottom lip and managed to maintain eye contact with Malfoy as he did it and Harry could tell Malfoy was turned on by it because his pupil’s dilated and he bit his lower lip.
Ron looked hurt. He bit his bottom lip. “That’s not fair, Harry. You aren’t the only one who is still hurting from the war, but you are the only one who refuses to move on from it.”
“Er, well, Pansy came to see me.”
Mr. Potter then did something that Draco could never have anticipated. He winked. The man winked at Draco and then bit his lower lip, keeping his gaze fixed on Draco’s lips.
“Back to the Ministry so Robards can rip us a new one, I suppose.” Potter headed off toward the entrance lobby where the Floos were, and Draco followed after him.
“I am confident that you are able to pick your own topics for discussion, Mr. Malfoy.”
“There’s so much. I don’t know where to look. I see something over every grave. Magic really is everywhere.”
Harry sighed to himself. “Real smooth, Harry.” He decided to get that drink after all.
?” Malfoy mouthed.
"It is. I just wanted to give you a shot to back out without looking like a prat when you inevitably lose,” Harry said with a smug, satisfied smile on his face. Maybe the firewhiskey was fueling this a little bit, but Harry had been dying to broach this topic with Malfoy all year.
“Why not enjoy like the rest?” Kharkov said, pulling Draco out of his thoughts. She had her eyebrows raised in question.
“Kiss me.”
“If I simply tell you then how I am to know if the behavior is genuine or that of tired practice?”
Harry, mirror in one hand, grabbed Malfoy by his arm and dragged him away from the front of the line. The instant his hand made contact with Malfoy, he felt his pulse quicken and that feather-like sensation returned with a vengeance. Where his hand rested on Malfoy’s forearm felt like fire, but it didn’t burn—it warmed, it smoldered. It made him
Harry scoffed. “You’re not a villain, Draco. Stop that. You said you loved me, remember? You said it that night in the Astronomy Tower, so why not?”
Harry nodded. “Good point.”
Draco didn’t wait for a response. He was already drafting a letter for a partner transfer in his mind when he tossed the Floo powder in and let the green flames consume him. Working with Potter would be impossible after this.
“Oh. Yes, I like you as my tutor so much better,” Harry said, dragging Draco forward into a lazy, slow kiss. The taste of mint on his lips drove Harry wild, and he had no idea why other than the fact that it was Draco. It tasted like
“And I understand, but also I fear it is less to do with your dislike of parties and more to do with your worry that everyone still looks at you and sees a Death Eater and not the man you have grown into over the last year.”
Just then, as if he wished it into existence, a girl nearby screamed and threw her drink as a ghost wearing full pirate garb floated through her on his way to walk the plank. Unlike the Hogwarts ghosts, or even the ones in the Manor, this one seemed trapped in a loop. He did not even acknowledge the students as he flung himself into the Black Lake.
Harry couldn’t believe it. He lost.
“This is as good a spot as any,” Draco said when he found a tree in view of the lake. He plopped down to the ground, yanking Harry down with him.
. Pansy was right. This potion wasn’t a good idea for him. It was like giving a recovered addict a hit of heroin only to snatch the rest away forever.
“Well, last night was set in place to remedy those missteps, as you know. The Dark Lord received word early this morning that Nikola was pleased with his visit and spoke highly of you to the Russian Minister. So much so, that he is requesting a meeting with you himself.”
Near the coffin, a circle of black and red candles were arranged in a pattern with one white candle in the middle. All but one of them were lit despite the damp breeze that rolled in through all the small crevices and cracks in the old stone walls. Harry noticed six of them were lit. Six. Like the six victims. Like the six Ley Lines leading to the nexus. The wax rolled down the sides of the candles, hitting the stone and trickling inward to meet in the middle of the circle where the sole white candle waited unlit. He wagered once the middle one was lit, whatever spell the Succubus had been working on would be in full effect. And he’d bet his last Galleon that she needed to make the final kill here to activate the nexus.
“He won’t mind, will you, Potter?” Nikola asked without turning to look at Potter who was fighting his binds aggressively. Draco dared a look at Potter who was opening his mouth to speak, but before he could, Nikola cast a silencing charm on him, so all that happened was Potter mouthing words mutely.
“And I guess I want to know why.”
Hermione’s eyes narrowed. “Of course you are, Harry. There are many people in danger. If these surges keep growing in frequency and size, there’s no telling the kind of lasting damage…”
less of an obstacle.”
Draco and Harry have some fun under the stars. ;)
“I have a guest who wants to see you.”
“How in all the hells did you get through the security wards without an invitation?” Harry asked.
Ron couldn’t meet my eyes. “The law is the law, Harry. Yes, that particular situation was complicated and I will admit that sometimes people look the other way, but you acted outside of the law when you beat him. How is that any different?”
Adeline Greyjoy was odd, sure, like any divination professor would be expected to be, but she wasn’t odd the way Trelawney had been. She seemed perfectly in control of her oddness. Nor was she odd in the way Dumbledore had been odd, not that he was a seer as far as I knew. She didn’t speak in riddles or answer questions with more questions. But she was odd and I didn’t trust her. Not when the trace had lead us directly to her.
While Harry had been lost in his thoughts, Malfoy had inched closer so their lips were practically touching. The anticipation of it all was driving him mad. Being that close and not kissing Malfoy was proving to be more difficult than Harry anticipated. With that thought, his stomach flopped at the realization that if he just moved forward a little, he could taste Malfoy’s lips finally.
I stepped carefully around them and took the lead to the station which was just up ahead. We were some of the last people to leave the party. Dean and Seamus begged us to stay the night, but Ron wouldn’t hear it and made some very risqué comments about just why.
“That was mine,” the Succubus wailed. Her voice held an aching, a longing, that Harry hadn’t been ready to hear.
“I’m happy for you,” Ron said between gulps. Then with a small huff, he leaned back, settling his head on the back of the couch. Harry watched as his best mate almost dozed off to sleep right in the middle of their conversation.
Draco laughed again, his warm, sweet breath ghosting over Harry’s lips. “You’re ridiculous, Potter.” He used his hand on Harry’s neck to bring them together again, their lips slotting together in a slow, passionate kiss.
There was one last loud bang on the door and someone shouting to
“Hello, Mr. Green thumb,” I said when I was right behind him.
“Someone I care about cares about the answer.”
“Mr. Golden Boy drank all that because we dared him to slap one of the Beauxbaton’s girls arses. Like the gentleman he is, he refused and chugged until we had him wobbling around drunk as a pirate,” Thomas explained. He winked at Potter and then added, “Probably why he needed that reminder to drink a pepper up.”
“Ginny will be there. She’s back from America and she’s bringing a date. I just wanted to give you a heads up.”
“Quinten said they’ve only been on a few dates. Haven't even kissed yet,” Neville answered and then looked as if he had seen a ghost. His face went white and he nervously ran his fingers through his hair. “Don't tell anyone I told you that, okay?”
“Shall we retire to my room?” Draco attempted to keep his voice from shaking, but he heard the vibrato. The combination of the wine, Nikola’s thigh pressing between his legs, and Potter watching the entire thing play out had Draco’s heart pounding. To say he was off his game would have been a kindness, in fact, Draco was in uncharted territory for the first time in years.
ask,” Draco said with a low chuckle, “well, there’s you.”
“Don't need to hear about your sex life right now, Ron,” Harry quipped and shoved an elbow into Ron’s side playfully, “I’m in crisis over here.”
; for the Dark Lord.
“That won’t be a problem. No blocking here,” Potter said, his voice a bit unsure. Or at least, Draco could have sworn he sounded unsure, but then again, that was wishful thinking on his part.
Before Potter could respond, Pansy was back in the room. She flicked her wrist and sent the paperwork off to Robards. “While we wait for his signature, let’s talk about how the potion works.”
I blinked my eyes open, thankful that my glasses were still on my face because I got to see the pure and utter shock on Ron’s face as if I had come back from the dead as a zombie. “Hi,” I said weakly.
Confused, panicked, and a little excited, Draco’s eyes went wide and his heart fluttered in his chest like a caged pixie. All Draco had wanted the whole year was to hear something like that come from Potter’s lips, but not like this.
I didn’t have time to answer him. The door opened slowly and a professor I didn’t recognize came in and quietly started making tea. She ignored us, not even turning to nod at Neville and sat at the table furthest from ours.
kiss you then, but when it turns out to be ridiculous…”
“He is pretty good with defensive spells though. Doesn’t even need his wand for most of them anymore,” Reed said sounding half-impressed.
“Earlier, I commented on the music in hopes that you would offer yourself as my partner the way Ms. Parkinson offered herself to Ms. Granger and I found myself quite rejected. I would prefer to remedy this rejection, if at all possible. Do you find this agreeable?”
“That’s not what I meant. I was just saying…”
“It will, but I have other things to consider, Harry. The Probationary Board is just waiting for me to mess up, and I’ve already been rejected by four Potions Masters for apprenticeships. I’m going to have to start looking outside of England. I might have to move just to get a fair chance at an apprenticeship. And the papers, Merlin, the papers already got wind of our friendship, and the gossip isn’t kind. People still see me as a traitor, as a Death Eater. I get death threats, Harry. Just for being your friend. Imagine what they will do if they find out we are dating, that we’ve been dating the better part of the year. I can’t bring that into your home. I won’t put you in danger ever again. I won’t be the reason you get hurt.”
“This is all your fault,” Malfoy snarled, elbowing Harry in the ribs. The pain shot through him, making him sit up straighter and move away from Malfoy.
Ron and Harry share a few drinks and Harry get's some insight on his situation.
,” Malfoy responded in kind, practically moaning as he said Harry’s name.
“How are you?” He asked.
“I think there’s someone I’m meant to save.”
“Thank you,” Neville said when everyone was paying attention. “We are so happy you all could make it out to celebrate with us.” Neville paused and there were a few hoots and hollers from the small crowd. Harry spotted Dean and Seamus, both of whom were cupping their mouths. Neville laughed and continued, “This has been a year full of growth and happiness, and the icing on the cake was when Luna agreed to marry me. We are both so unbelievably in love.”
“A battery?”
Draco crossed his sitting room and stood in front of the fire. He knelt down and picked up a log from the pile next to the mantel. The hearth roared to life as he tossed the log on the pile. The manor was quiet outside of the flickering fire.
The other Aurors in the room spoke quietly about the file, but Malfoy glared at Harry now with a look that he knew all to well as Malfoy’s ‘my father will hear about this’ face; though with Lucius in Azkaban, Harry didn’t know who Malfoy would run to this time. In a fit of petulance, Harry rolled his eyes, and then promptly ignored him, training his gaze on the map behind Robards. There was something he had overlooked about the Succubus, he was sure of it, but what?
“I’m sorry you feel that way, but you’re not
Guilt washed over him so quickly, he staggered backward. He had never struck anyone but Potter before. This, he thought, this didn’t feel anywhere near as satisfying as it had when he hit Potter. This felt like the nastiest, most uncouth impulse he had even fallen victim to—words had always been his way of inflicting pain. Not this. Nothing so fueled by blind rage.
“Nope. Never ever,” Harry said, his answer dripping with as much sarcasm as he could muster up, considering his brain was still running through scenarios where he confessed how he felt and got rejected.
The portkey was an old clock radio situated in the window of the night watches kiosk. The old man behind the window smiled at us and asked for identification.
Another Big Emotions chapter. Ginny and Harry discuss their relationship before the start of 8th year.
“Oh, do let me ask,” Luna’s voice came from behind Draco. “Hullo, Draco, so lovely of you to join us.”
“Or it could mean my shield will be stronger,” Draco countered.
“No need, Mr. Malfoy. I heard enough from you tonight.”
“Traces,” Hermione and I said in unison.
“Merlin, that’s grim.”
George moved closer to us and placed a hand on Malfoy’s shoulder. “This ponce accidentally got a letter I was sending out to this bloke I’ve been pen pals with for a while now. We send letters and only sign them with our first names, right? And he sends me presents, but that’s not important. He’s a potions master named David from France. Well, the owls must have gotten mixed up because they sent a rather racy letter of mine to Malfoy here who replied back with a very serious rejection of my advances. In fact, he didn’t think the letter sufficed, so he stormed into my shop and quite animatedly told me where I could stick my letter.”
“That’s fair,” Draco said honestly. It was true. The prophet did more harm than good. If anyone else knew that, it was Draco. After the war, they eviscerated Draco and his family and revealed the location of the Manor. This resulted in more hate mail than Draco had ever thought possible and more than a few people trespassing and getting lost in the gardens and maze after being hit with the Confundus charms surrounding the grounds. He hadn’t been living there for some time when it all happened, but when he read about it, he tried to owl his mother. She never responded.
“The music is lovely,” Mr. Potter affirmed but seemed to be saying something else. He seemed to ask Would you like to dance? in that subtle way that held no risk of rejection because it had not been a question so much as an invitation for Draco to assert that he would like to dance.
Now, however, Harry found himself crouching in the snow a few feet away from Malfoy all while looking at a plant that was definitely just a weed. It was Christmas Eve, Harry whined internally, and he was looking for plants. For the millionth time, Harry wondered how he got into this situation.
“How did he manage that?”
I put a hand down on the upturned earth. I can’t say what motivated me to do it, but when I did—I felt a searing pain like a white hot poker to my gut. It took everything in me not to scream.
“But once they get used to us together, everything will be fine.”
“Potter? Are you even listening?” Draco’s voice cut through his revere. His head was on the tree, too, leaning against Harry’s now. “Merlin, tell me you aren’t that much of a lightweight that you’ve passed out. Figures. You can take on dark wizards, but two sips of whisky do you in. Pathetic.”
“Oh, right,” Potter started, “well, Hermione and I tinkered with Neville’s old Remembrall to make it reveal what it is you’ve forgotten. Took a lot of charm work, but it seems to work most of the time.”
Tension rolled off Draco’s shoulders at Potter’s suggestion to split up. “Yes, good. Send up a red spark if you find anything or run into trouble.”
Slowly, he approached Mr. Potter. His steps made squishing noises as his shoes were filled with water from a stepping through a puddle in his rush to get to Mr. Potter. The noise caught Mr. Potter’s attention. He turned his face up to look at Draco. His eyes were bloodshot and his cheeks still wore the bright red color of embarrassment. Draco felt his breath catch at the sight. His words had done that.
The humidity was thick and suffocating, like a heavy blanket had been thrown over the forest. I had to follow that trail, had to find out where the magic originated. I jogged, stepping over fallen trees and watching for rocks. There was so much ambient magic around me that I had trouble keeping my focus on the black trail in front of me as it started to fade. It swooped under other traces, over them, moving around trees and through brushes. I turned back and realized I was deep into the forest. I couldn't see the cemetery anymore, but I saw a tuft of white-blond hair bobbing in between the trees. Malfoy followed me in.
“Erm, ‘Arry, as much as Malfoy gets on me nerves, yeh did snort at him,” Hagrid decided to add unhelpfully. He shrugged as he said it seeming to apologize for siding with Malfoy.
He breathed out a laugh. “Thanks, Harry.” He brushed off the dirt on his hands by wiping them down the front of his trousers. “What are you doing back here anyway?”
Reed scoffed. “Must be nice to be Harry Potter.”
“I am not against polite conversation, if that is what you mean to imply. It is simply that I do not know what you would like to hear, Mr. Potter. Why not tell me what to say and I will say it?”
“It’s been four years, Hermione. Ginny and I are fine. We hashed things out ages ago.”
She laughed. It was a beautiful sound, but beautiful in the way an abandoned ruin covered in overgrowth is beautiful. Her laugh hinted at darker things, untold power. “Let’s take this out of the rain. I want to taste all of you.”
“Maybe.”
“Is it?”
After all of that, it would be unthinkable for Draco to truly catch the attentions of Mr. Potter, who was and always would be on the side of the angels—morally untouchable and possibly a bit fantastical. And like so many cruel jokes, Draco’s feelings for Mr. Potter had only grown in the months after the trial. Try as he might, he kept the flame of hope burning speculating that the interference may have suggested, in whatever small way, that Mr. Potter could be persuaded to find Draco tolerable.
“She is right perceptive, that one,” Ron agreed and smiled to himself. After finishing the last dregs of the firewhiskey in his cup, Ron placed it on the table next to the forgotten dinner plates and
“Quidditch pitch,” Harry answered. “Headed for bed.” He moved toward the couch and placed a kiss on Draco’s forehead, hoping to get away before Draco fully woke up and wanted to talk. But luck was not on his side.
“Yes, Mister Malfoy,” Margie answered and backed out of the office, closing the door behind her, leaving Harry and Draco alone.
Draco smiled his smile that said:
“I have a bit of a lead.”
Draco choked as he heard those words. No one had ever asked to see Potter before, nor called him formidable. Most people wouldn’t dare offend the Dark Lord in such a way. Asking to see Potter was like asking for proof that the Dark Lord actually had him in captivity. And to question the Dark Lord was to die. Yet, here Nikola was, sipping his drink smugly awaiting a response.
“You’re right. We follow the magic. Track the patterns.” I brushed the rest of the dirt off my pants and picked up my wand which was in the dirt just in front of the tombstone. I don’t know why it didn’t occur to me to read the stone sooner, but I read it now and felt my stomach flip. The name on it was Frank Longbottom Sr.
“More ridiculous than continuing to wonder if you should or shouldn’t want to kiss me when I’ve told you to do it, effectively making the decision easier for you?”
Hate didn’t even being to cover it, but it was a start. Crowds made me feel on edge, sure. The claustrophobia, the pressure to be something. Normally I can push it away, usually with the help of alcohol. But more than that, it was all the staring that came with crowds. The watching.
“And what is that?”
“Maybe he thinks you are indifferent.”
Without hesitation, Harry kissed Malfoy and this time he felt the soft, thin lines of Malfoy’s lips. He imagined they were softer than any flower petal. The warmth of the kiss poured down to his chest and settled there. And for the last time, Harry wondered at how he ended up here on Christmas Eve kissing Draco Malfoy.
Draco smiled again, this time it seemed forced and completely for Harry’s benefit. “This is terribly awkward, but I actually have something to ask you.”
“A guest? What do you mean?” Potter’s voice was confused and there was none of the venom Draco had come to expect. His eyes darted to Nikola, who was standing behind Draco. His jaw set and Draco could see Potter’s mind racing behind his ever-affecting eyes.
Someone in the crowd whistled. Other’s were ooo-ing. But Harry focused on Draco and how his body started to melt into his. Their torsos meeting. Their thighs flush against one another. Touching Draco held all the same weight as it did when they were on the pitch. There was still the hum of electricity between them like a live wire.
So where was it now?
Draco smirked when he saw Potter gulp and slide on of his hands down into his lap. Potter was trying to hide his erection, but Draco saw it before he could. And knowing that Potter was aroused, Draco came.
“Yes,” he answered. Boldly, he slipped his hand into Potter’s and intertwined their fingers. Potter smiled and Draco decided he didn’t care what the question was, as long as Potter kept looking at him like that.
“So it’s still there then? The chemistry between you two?”
“Malfoy, come on,” Potter said, his tone half joking, half offended. “That’s not what I meant.”
A muffled voice came from the other side of the door. “Harry?”
Tilting his head to the side, Harry decided to instigate Malfoy further. “What song was that supposed to be anyway?”
“What?
Harry rolled one shoulder in a slight shrug. “Maybe, maybe not.”
“You’re right. It’s too hot for a full quidditch kit, so I’ll just fly like this,” Harry said, smirking because he was sure Draco was as affected by Harry being shirtless as Harry had been watching Draco bend over in those shorts. As always, two could play that game.
to be charming, Father,” Draco replied. He let a bit of venom slip into his response, but it seemed his father was already preoccupied by something else. He had walked across the room to tug on the end of the table cloth in order to make the ends even.
The last bit of the sunset disappeared behind the clouds again, cloaking the cemetery in darkness. Night was upon them. Time was running out. The wind picked up and whistled through the trees, making Draco shiver. His body reacted to the wind, sending a shockwave of pleasure down his spine. Potter still watched him and Draco felt exposed standing there, with the wind caressing his skin and Potter’s gaze fixed on him.
“Potter, did you hear me?” Malfoy said a little louder than a whisper, but still soft enough that with each word came a wave of warm sweet breath on his neck. All the hairs on Harry’s body stood up at that.
“A firm request, Mister Malfoy.”
“Yeah, he is,” Neville answered and then swept the Exploding Snap cards off the desk and put them back into his desk drawer. He turned back to face Harry. “He’s taken you know.”
That seemed to snap Draco out of it. He squeezed Harry’s hand once, let go, then started walking. He looked over his shoulder at Harry, who stupidly hadn’t moved, and nodded towards the bench where they’d been sitting.
Malfoy zipped up his trousers and pulled out his pocket square to dab away the sweat beading on his brow. “Don’t say anything. You’ll ruin it. Go do your insipid speech. Everyone is waiting on you, oh Saviour of the Universe.”
“Hey, mate. Just get here? Were you flying again?” Ron asked, keeping his gaze forward. He had a cup in his hand full of a dangerously brown liquid. His cheeks were flushed, and he seemed tired. At least his eyes were half-lidded.
And it would have been a great plan, if the Prophet hadn’t written an article about Harry and Ginny being spotted canoodling on a bench in Hogsmead last weekend. The headlines were anything but subtle, suggesting a million things that were anything but true. However, that didn’t stop every witch and wizard who read it from eyeing him awkwardly, or coming up and asking him when this ‘miracle’ had happened.
It annoyed Draco to admit it, seeing as he would have to spend at least two hours fixing what it took Potter all of ten minutes to mess up, but sitting across from one’s partner made a certain kind of sense. It gave them the space to work without being too hard to reach when they needed to discuss a case, but clearly Potter’s slovenliness had not been taken into consideration when the choice was made. Draco was sure that if whoever came up with the system had a partner like Potter, they would have wanted their desks to be as far apart as possible.
“Erm, well,” Harry started. This was proving to be more difficult than expected. The Prophet article would be out tomorrow as Luna promised earlier that morning, so he wanted to talk to Neville before his mate knew the entire story as to why Harry would be interested in the newest member of Neville’s greenhouse team.
“Potter, really, I don’t…”
Lamont balled his fists, but ignored my comment. His eyes fell on the disarray at my desk and said, “New filing system there, Auror Potter?” Then he grabbed a folder off of his desk, walked it over to mine and tossed it down on the floor and kicked the papers around for good measure. “What a fun new system you’ve got worked out here.”
“Okay.” Harry braced himself to say something he hadn’t even told Ron and Hermione for fear that they wouldn’t understand. “My whole life, people have expected certain things from me, right?”
After Potter’s explanation, Luna spoke again. “So when you were dared to hold it, you ran off and we didn’t see you for a few minutes. What was it that you remembered you needed to do?”
He knew she was trying to work a spell, but he couldn’t figure out what kind. The deaths told him it had to do with Life and Death Magic, sacrifice most likely the reason for so many deaths all at once. But what could the Succubus want that it didn’t already have? What could drive something that only needed to kill once a year to survive to kill so many, so close together in desperation? And it was clear she was desperate, but why?
“I suppose I did know that. I just didn’t think it bothered me until last night when I thought…well, you know what I thought.” There it was again. He sounded hurt. He was the one who was adamant that the hook up at the ministry event meant nothing.
“Grown used to me?” Harry asked, laughter weaving its way into the words. Draco shot him a look, and Harry added, “I don’t want that to change either.”
Even though it was getting incrementally warmer out, both of them had kept to wearing their quidditch kits. The jersey’s were long sleeved and the pants had necessary padding in them. And now, here was Draco wearing those bloody shorts.
“Brace yourself, my darling Draco. You and I both know the importance of making an agreeable impression on the pair of them. It is a small miracle that they seem eager to approach us, so we must take advantage,” Pansy said quickly before Mr. Potter and Ms. Granger were upon them.
“What’s our plan then?” Malfoy whispered.
“And I was,” Harry told him. “Until I wasn’t.”
“Maybe my plan is to torture you slowly by annoying you to death.”
“Perceptive.”
Begrudgingly, Draco took a seat in one of the two leather arm chairs placed in front of Lucius’s desk. He made sure his back was straight and then folded his hands in his lap. “Well?”
“I thought so. I watch you in Potions, you know? It’s mesmerizing to watch your hands work so deftly, so steady.” Potter started to stroke Draco’s palm with this thumb as he spoke. He moved it in small circles. The motion made Draco whimper.
“Am I really so bad?” I asked, only half sure I wanted an answer.
Draco didn’t respond. His mouth fell open and his cheeks flushed, but he didn’t respond. Harry was afraid that after this, Draco would never speak to him again, but Harry was also afraid that if he did nothing, that moment between them last night would be lost forever. With school coming to an end and effectively ending their midnight matches, he needed to act.
“Yes,” Harry heaved out a deep sigh, “when will the article run?”
“Well, most people expected me to be like my parents. Fall in love, get married, be the perfect little family. And they expected it to be with Ginny.”
“What did you do to her?” Potter shouted the question at Draco before he fully entered the room.
Fuck, when I joined the aurors after school, I expected that I would get to do much of the same stuff I did while fighting Voldemort. Chasing bad guys, keeping people safe, making sure justice was served, dodging curses, surviving. It wasn’t like that though. It was like a walking nightmare. A nightmare filled with inter office memos and paperwork and red tape and stupid, antiquated laws that made no sense. Like leaving a child with his abusive parents because they are the Head of Improper Use of Magic Office and no one wants to deal with the fallout.
“Er, I like it well enough,” Harry found himself answering in spite of himself. He still hadn’t managed to tear his gaze away from Draco’s pale, exposed thighs.
Yet, last night he had not dreamt. He had not tossed and turned fitfully, only to give up on sleep and read a book in the dim light of his candelabra. He had not woken with the sickening taste of lavender in his mouth. He slept through the night and awoke to the sun streaming in through his curtains which he forgot to shut the night before. It warmed his skin and he felt almost like smiling.
“But why?”
Neville returned the laugh, and held the door to the greenhouse open. “Come on then, Harry.”
“Inform the Unspeakables,” Robards instructed Reed. She nodded and then headed back to the apparition point. “Maybe those mask-wearing twats have something stronger to trace the magic since they just love hoarding all the good spells for themselves.”
After a minute, Harry worried that without an invisibility cloak, Draco had too hard a time sneaking out to the pitch, but then Draco waltzed up, his broom balanced on his shoulder. He wore a white undershirt and tight shorts that resembled muggle biker shorts. They hugged Draco’s thighs and ass, revealing the delicate slope of his muscles—lean and taught.
Ignoring all rationality and the calls of his mates, Harry marched across the courtyard determined to speak to Draco. Since he was making a b-line straight for him, the crowd turned their attention on Harry, hoping to finally understand what was going on between the pair.
I sighed. “Ron, I’m sorry. I don’t want to fight with you. Not today.”
I couldn’t make myself say the words. My head was pounding and I felt my magic thrumming under my skin, itching to go somewhere. It felt erratic like it used to when I was still learning control. I tried to breathe through it.
Draco stood up, using the chair’s armrests to keep him steady. He wondered if they’d given Potter a Pepper-Up potion because he looked like he’d just awoken from a good night's sleep, whereas Draco felt like he’d been up for 72 hours straight. “Of course,” Draco said, a yawn muffling his speech a bit. “Wanted to make sure you were okay.”
When he was standing in front of Draco and Pansy, he spoke, “Why did you just leave like that?”
Draco didn’t answer. Instead he shook his head and smiled. Potter was definitely going to succeed at wooing him, but Draco didn’t have to tell him that right now.
“Strange how?” Ned finally answered, his eyes still glued to Malfoy.
I turned my attention to the stairs and the light coming from my sitting room. Shit on a stick. Will this day never end?
So he played at the tip—soft and slow, until Draco cursed and pulled Harry up into a fevered kiss that was more biting than it was kissing.
“This about your case then?” Ron asked. His long red fringe fell into his eyes, and he casually blew it away.
him. Shaking that thought from his brain, Harry turned his attention back on Ron. “Remember the time Hermione made us study the map of Ley Lines and the major nexuses in England just in case they appeared on the N.E.W.T.s? And then when they didn’t, she tried to explain why we were better off for having the knowledge and should thank her instead of being angry that we wasted a whole weekend?”
It’s Luna and Neville’s wedding, guys! Get ready for emotions.
“And here I thought you just wanted to hear my generic ‘works fine’ routine that I pull out for all the parties.” Harry smiled, matching Draco’s forced smile with one of his own. “What’s up, Draco?”
Harry mused, the time seemed fitting as it was midnight all those years ago when Draco challenged him to a duel, only to never show up. He had to admit, he considered standing Draco up just to be petty, but then he realized that he had been looking forward to their match all day, so pride be damned.
I jogged to catch up with Ron as rain matted my clothes to my body. He was nearly at the maze when another scream filled the dark sky. My pulse was in my throat as we hopped the hedge and jogged along the tree-line in pursuit of the screams.
“He’s American?”Harry asked incredulously.
Since the décor was equally balanced between the two styles, Draco feared this would be a meeting in which he was used as some sort of bargaining chip. Possibly, he was to seduce this Russian diplomat. The thought made his stomach turn. He had not yet had to sleep with anyone since his newfound attraction to Potter.
Potter gave him a curious look. A raised brow, a quirk of his lip. “No. Why? Should it be?”
. It was his duty to perform, to make those men happy so they would be putty in the Dark Lord’s hands. So when Nikola dropped to his knees and pulled Draco’s dress robes apart, Draco felt his breath hitch.
“You look good, mate. Rested,” Ron said. He handed me one of the gift boxes. The smaller one.
The Succubus’ magic must still be addling his mind because the thought of Malfoy whacking him with a ruler had just
“Potter and Malfoy have been working to track the Succubus’ movements through the city and found it only comes out after sundown, and frequents popular nightclubs and bars for its victims,” Robards said. He spared a breath to eye both Malfoy and Harry, then added, “It took some time to put it all together since the Muggle law enforcement didn’t hand over all their files at once, but Malfoy managed to write up a summary report of all we know about this particular Succubus.”
“I saw my mother,” I said. “Why would I see her when these visions have nothing to do with her? She’s dead.”
As the ground grew closer, Harry pulled up on his broom and slowed his speed. Draco didn’t. He kept in the dive until the last possible second, but missed the snitch. Harry watched as it flitted off to the left and disappeared under the stands.
“Merlin, what was I thinking,” he mumbled again. As he stood up, the flames of the fire flickered a deep green. Someone was trying to come through. Only a handful of people had access to the Manor’s Floo network. His mother had access, but as his house-elf, Pinky, informed him when he arrived home, she was still in France. Pansy had access, but usually she called first to ask if it was okay to drop in. And, of course, the Ministry had an emergency policy for all employees to give access to Minister Shacklebolt, as well as to their direct boss, so Head Auror Robards has access, too. It could be him come to yell at Draco for skipping the debrief. But something like hope flickered in Draco’s chest like a flame in a soft breeze. His partner also had access to the Manor via Floo.
That seemed to make Sir Hilliard happy. He straightened his armor and nodded at Harry. “Good to hear, Mr Potter. Rest easy.” With that, the portrait swung in on itself, giving Harry access to the eighth year common room.
“Just that Hermione is the best of us,” I called back. My eyes met Malfoy’s as I spoke. He smirked at me. It was brief, gone from his face in one breath. It felt like it was only for me.
Draco put his hands up, as if trying to stop the idea dead in its tracks. “Really, I would rather watch.”
“I do believe it is your turn to say something,” Mr. Potter said. He turned himself so he was looking at Draco now. A smile played at the corner of his lips. “Is it not considered polite to return with another comment on either the beauty of the couples, or at the very least how dreadful the weather is tonight?”
From the crowd Harry heard a few people shout, “Oi, who won then,” and “I think Harry won.” But in all honesty, Harry didn’t care about the bet. He never cared about the bet. What he cared about was kissing Malfoy.
“Well, I won’t be the one undoing the buttons when I get back to my room, so I suppose it’s going to be easier than getting it on.” Potter winked as he said this. The implications set Draco’s body off. He felt himself get excited all over again. He was thankful for the extra room in Potter’s jeans.
? Had she just said Malfoy loved him?
Malfoy eyed me carefully. There were tears in his eyes and sweat running down his temples. “I’ll cast to make sure the tea is safe,” he said.
The only thing he noticed was the feeling of the bass vibrating through the limo—vibrating through him, as Draco pushed inside of him. Gripping his hips, hard.
I scoffed. “Before I fucked up.”
Her hair was still a visible mess, but her pale complexion held a certain appeal that was not entirely lost on Draco. As did her position in the Ministry. Ms. Granger was an Unspeakable and it was said that she would one day take over the entire department. A connection like that was not entirely unfavorable; however, it paled in comparison to her companion, Mr. Potter.
“Nikola, is this your first visit to England?” Lucius asked in his guest voice, handing a drink to Nikola. It was reserved for people that were to be impressed. Rarely Draco was on the receiving end, but even those occasions were too far and in between now.
While I was bent down behind my desk, I overheard two aurors as they came into the bullpen, Luke Lamont and Angie Reed. They clearly thought they were alone.
“That’s been happening already.”
Suddenly, Potter’s hands were off the door and cupping Draco’s face—tilting his chin down. Then Potter slipped his tongue into Draco’s mouth and hummed softly. His hands gripped Draco’s face tighter as he deepened the kiss.
My stomach tightened. The instinct to run hitting me harder now than before. I searched the growing crowd for Hermione. She was next to Ron talking to some tall man I didn’t recognize. They looked like they were enjoying the conversation.
“Merlin, just kiss me already.” Harry was feeling more than a little bit nervous, confident attitude aside. “Do it, Malfoy.”
I looked at the clippers and they were long and sharp. Instinctively I touched the side of my face where it almost got me. “Sorry, mate.”
“That’s probably the all the rest,” I said with a smile. I didn’t feel rested. I felt depleted like a used up battery. I placed the present under my arm, mirroring Ron.
“What is it your big old brain is debating about?” Harry matched Draco’s position so he could get a look at Draco’s face. Harry wanted to see Draco’s smokey grey eyes because his tone could conceal his feelings, but not those eyes.
He felt irately petulant all of a sudden. It came upon him like a wave against the shore. All of his own insecurities, his doubts, surfaced and tangled around him yanking him with fevered desperation to the depths of uncertainty.
He felt a pang of loathing, sour and heavy, settle in his gut at the memory. If he had been faster, stronger, smarter…if he had been the wizard everyone thought he was, then Ada Holcomb wouldn’t be dead. She’d be at home with her husband getting Indian takeaway and settling in for a weekend of errands, or some other very normal-person stuff, but instead… she was dead. Harry hated himself for letting another person die because of his inability to take down the bad guy fast enough. He’d had enough of that for a lifetime.
“Don’t do that to yourself, Harry,” Ron said. He was attempting to cast another trace spell, just in case, but it behaved the same way. The magic floated around and around, never settling or identifying magic. “His death isn’t on you.”
Potter took his and uncorked it. “Thanks, Parkinson.” He swigged it back in one gulp and said ‘Ahh’ before heading out of the lab without Draco.
Malfoy always had a knack for zeroing in on my insecurities and calling me out. It was like he could read my mind. Hell, maybe he could. I heard Snape trained him in Occlumency just like he trained me. I think that’s what drew me to him then and now. I didn’t have to pretend to be Harry Potter for him. That idealized version of me that everyone built up in their heads before they even knew me. There was freedom in the way Malfoy saw me.
Malfoy reached me first despite his improper footwear. He always had been fast. “What is it?” He sounded out of breath, too, but he didn’t show any visible signs of being winded.
Quietly, Harry responded. “I—I mean...I wanted to stroke your cheek like you did the petal. It was stupid. I’m stupid. Sorry.” Then he looked around to see how far off Hagrid was—luckily, he was a good distance off fiddling with the branches of a tree making himself look busy.
He held his wand up in a dueling posture and nodded. “
“It is certainly not your conversational abilities as I am pleased to find you can speak for longer than five minutes. Before tonight, I feared you ran on a timer.”
“You are an absolute menace, Potter,” Girl Weasley answered. She took the glass Potter had poured for himself and swigged it back in one fluid motion. Then she smirked, handed the glass back, and walked away.
“It’s okay. I think about him sometimes, too. It comes out of nowhere. I’ll be making coffee in the kitchen and hear Ron slam a book shut and suddenly I’m thinking about the basement at Malfoy Manor.”
“That’s impossible.” Draco said this more to himself than to his father.
“Get on w—” The rest of what he was going to say disappeared, immediately replaced with wonder at the sensation of Draco’s lips on his. Draco wrapped a hand around Harry’s neck, tugging him even closer.
“No, I
“I wanted to...to touch you,” Harry said. His voice went up as if he wasn't sure if he was asking a question or making a statement. Probably both, he mused. This was going exactly as badly as he should have anticipated, but he couldn't stop himself now. All he had been able to think about all night was the way Malfoy stroked that petal like it was the most impressive, most desirable thing he had ever laid eyes on. Harry wanted to touch and be touched with that level of intensity.
Harry decides to go to Draco’s hearing and the infamous letter is read aloud...dun, dun, dun.
“Well, I think that is about all the revelry I can take.” Draco moved to leave, but Luna caught his arm and she pulled him in close and tight. It felt nice to be hugged, Draco thought. It had been so long since another person had touched him in a kind way. The last few months at Hogwarts had been a stream of hexes, slurred insults, and ass-kickings in empty bathrooms.
“I expect you won’t,” Hermione said and then walked over to her pristine desk and lifted herself up to sit on the desktop. She crossed her legs and smiled triumphantly.
?” she spat. Her putrid eyes widening in disbelief. She sniffed the air like a dog trying to catch a trail. The man moved under her again and this time she slapped his face with such force that he passed out.
“Well, it looks like both of us are going to be facing a fear,” Luna said and reached a hand across the table and placed in on top of Harry’s, “Though mine will be much more private.”
“Only if you want to, of course.” Potter resumed his walking about the room. He stopped in front of a portrait of Draco that his mother had commissioned when he turned eighteen. Draco hated it, but his mother insisted on hanging it in the sitting room. The portrait itself was life-size and in it, Draco stood behind a high-backed chair with one hand resting on the chair and the other tucked away in his trouser pocket.
“Five centuries older, in fact.”
I was feeling petulant and way too exposed. I couldn’t meet her eyes and I didn’t want to acknowledge that some part of what she said was true. “Shame you didn’t fall off.”
Malfoy scoffed. “Robards said to call for backup. So
“People like you, who hold it all in, taste like milk gone sour.”
“Where is my father?”
“I’ll say,” Pansy answered, clearly impressed by Potter. Draco felt an odd pang of jealousy even though he knew it was unfounded. Pansy didn’t date men, and even if she did, Potter wasn’t her type.
Honestly, it just made me feel like running and never looking back.
“You’re also a giant pain in the arse.” Potter laughed and then let his hand fall to rest on Draco’s chest.
and informal
Draco nodded shakily and they walked off toward the privy in the captain's quarters where this whole mess had begun. They didn't speak until they reached the bathroom. Draco had to keep his mind off the fact that if he had picked anyone else this wouldn’t be so bad. At this rate, he was no only going to be in the same room as Potter and undress, he was going to be wearing that stupid muggle outfit all night smelling like Potter. He hated himself for not choosing Granger.
When he opened them, Potter was standing in front of him looking Draco up and down. His face was unreadable. “You would have to wear the most formal looking dress robes in the world, wouldn't you?”
. It was hard, but Harry managed to extricate himself from the kiss long enough to say, “Draco.”
I knelt down in front of the upturned earth at the head of the grave. It wasn’t a very deep hole. Whoever was digging this was doing it with their hands and they didn’t make it very far. I saw deep grooves where their fingers dragged the dirt up. I don’t know why but the scene made me think of my dreams. Of the man sobbing in front of the rock.
sound and muttered a
“So I wanted some.” Harry licked his lips, tilting his head in challenge. He held up an empty cup, shoving it toward Draco.
Harry couldn’t help but scoff at Luna’s introduction. She wasn’t usually that rude to him. He decided to brush it off, and say hello. “Nice to meet you, Ryder.”
“Been there. So why are you lurking in the shadows like Moaning Myrtle anyways?”
“You really stayed sober all day,” was Hermione’s response.
“Is it?” I scoffed.
,” Draco drawled. He crossed the room and positioned himself in front of the desk, but decided to remain standing for as long as his father would let him. It felt more like equals meeting in a battlefield like this and less like he was a beaten down mutt waiting for his treats.
Malfoy made a
“I’m fine,” Malfoy said, wiping the vomit from his mouth. “It must be all the running though the forest.” He tried a smile, but his face was still pale and sallow-looking.
So school is starting up and I am going to do my darndest to keep up one chapter per week, but I am human and life is busy, so I might have to dial it back to one every two weeks. Who knows? Either way, I will keep you all up to date.
I nodded and he cast a spell I'd never heard of that was probably some potions master spell and seemed satisfied with the results. He stared down at the drink for a moment. “I don’t like thinking about him.” He sounded smaller, less Malfoy-like and it made me uncomfortable.
Mindlessly, Hagrid placed an enormous hand on Harry’s shoulder, slightly knocking him off balance and backward into Malfoy who was behind him. The shock of Malfoy catching him before his ass could meet with the fresh powdering of snow was enough to heat Harry’s entire body despite the frigid wind. The reaction to feeling Malfoy’s hands gripping his arms was entirely unexpected. It made Harry’s throat go dry.
Malfoy’s face lit up. He was smiling and it was so genuine, so completely different from how I’ve seen him, that it made my breath catch in my throat. I wanted to kiss him in that moment. I felt myself moving toward him and stopped myself. Kissing him because I liked the way he smiled after seeing his potion work was definitely not casual hook-up territory. If he had been confused about things with us before, what would my kissing him out in the open mean to him?
When Harry approached them, he heard the end of Hermione’s argument about sportsman-like conduct improving the overall experience of Quidditch. Ginny was rolling her eyes, but before she could say anything, Hermione spotted Harry. She whirled on him, hugging him before he had a chance to say hi. Her wild, curly hair was loose and hung around her face today and he got a mouthful of it before she released him.
“But Potter...” Robards started to say, but Harry interrupted him.
“Dunno, Ginny found me out like she always does. Can see right through me as if I were a ghost haunting the halls of Hogwarts,” Harry intoned. Ginny had always been the best at figuring out the inner workings of his mind and unabashedly calling him out for it. It was this quality that she shared with the man Harry was desperately in love with.
With a sour taste in his mouth, Draco entered the dining room. There was a full breakfast spread on the table and steaming hot tea in front of his seat. However, Lucius was not in attendance. His plate was there and it seemed like it was clean from disuse. There wasn’t even a dirty tea cup to suggest that his father had been down for breakfast.
“Nothing,” Draco stuttered, raising a hand to his top button trying to swallow the lump in his throat. “I mean, undergarments, of course, but traditionally you don’t wear clothes under a dress robe.”
In the dim cone of light from the lantern, Harry could just make out the star shaped leaves of one of the plants on the list Snape had given Hagrid. He stalked off toward it, casting a
“Merlin, the ego on this one,” Weasley commented. “She meant Lockhart, of course. It was her turn for Truth. Neville asked her who her first crush was and it was apparently Lockhart.”
The beast turned just before he reached the man and I saw his face settle for a moment. It was my own face. It smiled at me and then it was gone. Replaced by the blur of facial features arranging and rearranging on his face.
“Sir?” I asked.
They continued on like that; Harry standing between Draco’s legs, Draco’s hands gripping his neck, their lips a a symphony of soft pecks and deep, long, kisses that left Harry panting, wanting.
He shrugged. “It’s supposed to last over an hour. It could last that long or it could last ten minutes. You’re the first person to ingest it.”
Harry couldn’t believe Draco had the control to stop. If he hadn’t pulled away, Harry wouldn’t have been able to stop what they were doing, his need was too strong. He did his best to steady himself and think. “You’re probably right.”
Potter didn’t respond. Instead, he lifted the bottom of his shirt, revealing a dark trail of hair going to his navel. Draco’s throat went dry. He stopped unfastening buttons and watched Potter slip his shirt off over his head. His chest was a little hairy. Dark hair covered his pecs and trailed down to meet the hair at his navel. His body was pale and toned from years of quidditch training.
“Picky eater?” Malfoy asked, his eyes widening. He seemed to mull that over, his brow furrowing in thought. That paired with the tragic heartthrob vibe, and Harry felt a warmth growing in his stomach at the sight of his partner.
“Yes, we do because I’ve waited and waited for something like this my whole life. To feel the way I feel when I’m with you. I’m done waiting, Draco. I died last year, don’t you get it?” Harry’s voice quivered and he couldn’t keep the tears from falling. They ran hot down his cheeks. “I died, and came back and have a second chance at a normal life. I won't squander that chance by being scared of what everyone else thinks.”
“No?”
“It worked too well. It made me so jealous, that I tried making him jealous.”
Mr. Potter stopped their swaying again and again adopted a serious face. His skin glistened under the lamplight. Each droplet of rain like a star in the sky—a galaxy of wonder and mystery. “Mr. Malfoy?”
Potter choked on his drink. “Funny,” he said. He looked concerned for a minute and opened his mouth to say something, but then, instead, slapped Draco on the back playfully.
Toward the back there was a counter of sorts and behind it stood Draco Malfoy who was furiously scribbling on some parchment. He wore a black apron over
Malfoy quirked his lip up, clearly amused. “Shame. That Potter is exponentially more intriguing. I could tell them all for you. Though they would hardly believe an ex-Death Eater. No matter how well I managed to restore the Malfoy name, they will always see that first. Who I actually am doesn’t matter.”
“I just mean, that’s where it happened,” Harry amended his statement and smiled at his best mate, who was grinning back at him stupidly. Of course Ron would be just as understanding as Ginny had been. In fact, Harry was starting to feel silly for ever fearing their reactions.
Without thinking, I said, “I know the feeling.”
That was all it took and Draco pulled away shaking, his face and lips pink. His hair tousled, his nipples erect. Harry considered forgetting the whole thing in favor of kissing and licking lines down Draco’s chest, but shook his head. “Can you please say something?”
This particular point, Draco noticed, the Dark Lord agreed on wholeheartedly which meant his father chimed in on how deplorable it was for a muggle to be allowed access to their world. Honestly, what civilized society would encourage the mingling of bloodlines so visibly, his father had said and Draco was so bored he almost forgot to nod in aggressive agreement.
Ron knelt down next to the man to check for a pulse. He looked up at me and shook his head. The man was dead. His eyes were open, empty. I couldn’t look at him. The blood was still seeping out of the gash on his chest. If we’d been just a little faster, we might have made it before he died. If I hadn’t let Malfoy distract me, I would have been here. I could have helped him.
Harry returned with a cocksure smile. He felt his face get hot when Draco only rolled his eyes and scoffed before pulling on his broom and heading the opposite direction.
“The bloke has always been off his rocker, Reed,” Lamont said. There was some rummaging as if he was going through some papers. “Robards thinks so and this just proves it.”
Harry placed a hand over Hermione’s and pulled her hand away from his face. “I’m okay, ‘Mione. I’d like to say hello to my girlfriend, who has just gotten back from a month of playing away games all over Europe, if it’s all the same to you.” He winked at her, and she laughed.
“Uh, was that the wrong choice? I’ve never played this game before.”
Refocusing on the plant in front of him, Harry brushed off the light dusting of snow covering the star-shaped leaves and once he was sure it matched the description, plucked it from the earth and placed it in a jar.
“You think?” Luna perked up and her bright blue eyes gleamed again the sunlight that was now pouring in from the open widow, the sun fully risen.
Still, Draco couldn’t stop himself saying, “Don’t be foolish. There’s no telling the side effects.”
“On occasion,” Draco admitted. It was a sort of guilty passtime of his. He wanted to see what was being said about him and his family. He felt like their hate for him was justified and that he should be subject to it. It was the same reason he never fought back when someone hit him. Yes, he helped in the end, but he was also one of
“As your partner.”
—if Jack Dawson had been rich and spoiled, that is. Malfoy certainly had the tragic heartthrob part down, at least. Harry didn’t know if it was the potion or what, but with his hair a bit messy and his pale cheeks holding a pink hue, Malfoy looked…
We all stared at each other and laughed. It wasn’t that the situation was funny. It wasn’t that we were suddenly insane. It wasn’t even that it was late and we were tired. It was the absolute hilarious conclusion that we all seemed to come to at the same time: one of us would need to ask Malfoy for his potion, even though it hadn’t been tested on humans yet, and one of us would have to ingest it to see if we could follow the magical trail at the crime scene.
“Is it also forward if I say that I've been thinking about your lips all day and that if you don't put me out of my misery soon and kiss me, I might…”
Harry swallowed hard as Draco knelt to make sure his trainers were tied before the match started. The scene before him made his body hum with excitement more than catching the snitch ever had. Harry had known that Draco must have been toned—especially since Draco flew like it was the most natural thing in the world, but he had never seen Draco so— exposed.
Mr. Potter leaned his head forward and pressed his forehead to Draco’s as he spoke. If Draco thought his heart hammed before, it was nothing compared to this moment. Nothing compared to how he felt when Mr. Potter let his words fall between them pregnant with meaning. “You flatter me.”
Potter moved in closer and tilted his head to the side. “Oh?” He placed a soft kiss on Draco’s cheek and then moved to kiss his jaw. Draco froze under his touch. Potter kept placing soft kisses down his neck.
That drew his attention away from the stage. “Oh, I’d love to have seen that. What did Hermione do?”
“Exactly,” Draco said firmly. “If I want to date, I am perfectly capable of finding my own bloke. I may be an ex-criminal, but I’m hot.’
“It wasn’t,” Draco snapped. “Remember Pansy also said it would be worse if you denied it or were blocked?”
Her tone was gracious and she did not seem put out to be speaking to Pansy and Draco. In fact, she seemed quite eager to speak again. Her mouth was already forming the words. It was only the rules of polite conversation that seemed to keep her at bay long enough to let someone else speak.
“Malfoy, I appreciate what you’re saying but you don’t even know what we are facing.”
I looked around the hedge maze. They all looked exactly the same height and width. “It all looks great, Nev. The place is like a mystical garden from a storybook.”
However, Mr. Potter leaned forward to close the space between them and locked eyes with Draco, placing one hand over Draco’s forearm. The intensity behind his eyes was staggering. The touch nearly knocked Draco to his knees.
“In my bag, relax, will you? You’re drawing attention.”
Harry’s heart felt like it had begun beating at the speed of a hummingbird’s. He couldn’t quite control the smile that spread across his face. “Did you just tell me you loved me? Did Mr Keep it Casual just admit that he loved me? You love me, Malfoy. Oh Merlin, you love me.”
Ron nodded, used the couch’s armrest to stand up, and wobbled into the crowd toward wherever the alcohol was stationed. From his perch on the couch, Harry had a view of the whole common room. Someone had taken to pushing all the furniture to the walls so there was a big empty space in the middle of the room for dancing. The ceiling had been bewitched to match the night sky, with occasional fireworks going off for New Year’s. Harry watched the bewitched sky for so long that he didn’t realize that someone had been sitting next to him until they coughed to get his attention.
Loosening his fists, Draco felt himself sigh into the kiss. He opened his eyes and looked at Potter who stopped moving his lips and smiled against Draco’s lips. Slowly, Draco moved his hands up—resting one on Potters bare shoulder. The muscle tensed under his touch. The other he slid around to the back of Potter’s neck. Draco felt Potter’s pulse flutter.
Draco smiled at Harry, leaned over, and kissed him on the cheek. His lips, which were the stuff of erotic dreams, felt warm on Harry’s skin. The evening spring breeze was almost chilly, but not enough to chase them inside. They were alone in the Astronomy Tower under the guise of studying, but the both of them knew what they really wanted to do.
“So far so good,” she answered. Her face perked up. She was clearly interested in this line of conversation. “How you managed to replicate the tracing spells but with a potion that lasts longer and is nearly unnoticeable is astounding. You’ll let me see your notes someday, won’t you?”
At the very edge of the cemetery, Harry spotted an iron gate about six feet tall with ivy growing around the iron poles. There were hip-high bushes and a tree whose branches hung over into the cemetery. Underneath the shade of the tree, Harry spotted three dead birds just as Ned, the caretaker, had said.
“Don’t be a prat,” Draco said, rolling his eyes.
“No problem, Nev,” Harry answered, even though it was sort of a problem because at this rate he would be late to Quidditch practice, but it would be worth it if he could get some answers out of Neville.
Potter made a low sound in his throat, halfway between a grunt and a soft
His teeth clattered together. It was an especially cold night, but the snow fall and wind made it moreso. Usually, Harry enjoyed seeing the grounds covered in snow. It was like the picturesque landscape inside of a snow globe—perfect and quiet. However, with the wind screaming past his earmuff-less ears, Harry quite thought he hated the snow-covered grounds.
Even distracted as Harry was with trying not to die, he felt his pulse pick up at the Succubus’ words.
“Yes.” I was starting to fall asleep standing there waiting for the conversation to end.
that he would hurt either Granger or Potter and the red-haired monstrosity would all but cave. In fact, Draco wasn’t sure which person the Weasel cared about more. He would have figured it would be the muggle since they were dating, but he begged with equal patheticness for Potter to be left alone.
Ron shrugged. “You weren’t late though and Lamont and Reed are harmless—annoying, but harmless.”
Greyjoy waved a hand arbitrarily. “Ah, not exactly. I have a ward up around my little fire. This forest isn’t exactly safe, you know? It warned me there were two people nearing and then I focused and cast a revelio and it told me who was there.”
Harry’s heart pounded like a fist against his rib cage. Was Malfoy the
“You don’t really pay attention much, Harry.” She looked like it hurt her to say the words. “I don’t like to burden you. It was worse for you.”
“I don’t see how it’s any worse than sleeping with Carlie Carr, Hollyheads beater, and then sleeping with their seeker a night later? It cost them the championship.”
“Oh, yeah. Forgot about that one,” Charlie said, forcing out a laugh. His breath clouded in front of them in a puff.
I blinked my eyes open again, slower this time. I still couldn’t see. I touched my face. No glasses. “Blind.” I said.
that Potter was attractive. He was built for a fight with wide shoulders and thick muscles. His jet black hair grew in tendrils that fell around his face accentuating that olive tone of his skin.
The air was like a warm caress. It had the beginnings of summer. Yet, there was still a crispness to the air that filled Harry’s lungs with each deep breath he took.
The music drifted out of Pandemonium like a vibrating pulse. Harry could feel it in his bones. He stood tense, waiting for something to happen—and it was a matter of
“That being said,” Luna picked up for Neville. Her voice was as sing-songy as ever, but now with a hint of mature wisdom to it. “We would like to announce our wedding party choices.”
Belatedly, he responded, “Um, sorry, but are you asking me?”
I tried to steady myself on the wall.
“Fine, but Robards needs to sign it first, and you should tell him what’s going on. What
I sat back in my chair and took another sip, ignoring the arousal tightening in my groin. I nodded toward the professor and Neville mouthed “She’s new. Divination” and then raised his eyebrows.
Once Luna was done, Potter stood up straight again. He swigged back a bit of his drink and said, “I dare you to switch clothes with one of us for the rest of the party.”
“I will love you, please you, and you can stop fighting, stop protecting,” she purred, leaning in and planting a soft lipped kiss on his mouth. It sent a jolt of pleasure through him that made his knees buckle. “I will give you all that your heart desires tonight.” Her words came as a comfort. Harry leaned into her touch more, letting her scent wash over him. “You will die with a smile on your face, having experienced love like no other.”
Taking her hand, Harry let Ginny pull him off the bench, but only after pretending to be stuck to the spot and making her struggle to get him off the seat. Afterwards, they both laughed heartily and walked arm in arm back towards the warmth of The Three Broomsticks where their friends awaited them.
“Yes, Master Draco.”
Draco let out a small squeak at the thought of Potter walking around naked after showering and then masked it by coughing so ridiculously loud that a few partygoers near them looked over. In fact, he was so caught up in the moment that he barely felt the glass slip from his fingers. It shattered at his feet.
“You don’t, but I expect you can see the truth in what I am saying anyway. You know the Ministry covers things up. The Unspeakables operate outside of the law, always have. What’s stopping them from covering things up to keep the public from panicking about magical surges?”
“Yes.”
“I’m not even sure why I am so hurt by your words. Surely you have said worse to me. Surely I have endured worse.”
“So, uh, how’s this work?” I asked just to have something to think about that wasn’t how badly I wanted him.
“Do you always ask so many questions?”
“You are getting too good at that, Gin,” Harry laughed and saw his breath cloud in front of his face like the steam of the Hogwarts Express engine as it steamrolled to it’s destination.
“Point taken.”
“Yes,” Ron answered. He looked at me and I could see his concern for Hermione. It couldn’t be helped. She had been obliviated with the rest of the party. She didn’t remember the scream or that we’d run off to investigate it. No one did.
“That was not meant to flatter.” Draco closed his eyes. If he kept them open any longer he would simply combust because Mr. Potter was looking at him in a manner that was better suited for the privacy of a marriage bed. “It is simply truth. I am sure I could conjure up a much better compliment than calling you kind.”
This was a bad idea, Harry thought as he took another long pull from the bottle. This time he winced as it burned down his throat. “So, who else did Luna try and set you up with?”
“No worries. I hope it all works out for them,” Harry said trying to sound convincing. With a smile and a quick hug, Harry bid Neville farewell and got on his broomstick. He was terribly late for Quidditch and had a terrible idea on how to get Draco's attention.
“Want me to fuck you, Potter? Is that what you want?” Draco said in a low growl. His hands pulling slightly at Harry’s hair.
Laughing, Draco readied his broom and said, “Merlin’s beard, Potter, who knew you were such a drama queen.”
Malfoy’s mouth hung open like a fish’s. “Thanks?”
Harry didn’t speak, couldn't speak. He just watched Malfoy’s expression change from playful to unsure. Their breath came out in puffs like the Hogwarts Express steaming along. From this angle, Harry decided that Malfoy was definitely pointy like a bird, but also his porcelain skin looked smooth and he found he quiet wanted to run a finger across Malfoy’s cheek much as he had done to the white flower petal earlier.
,” Draco hummed into Harry’s mouth before tilting his head, allowing Harry to deepen the kiss.
Hermione flopped down on the sofa and pulled the knitted blanket Molly made me last Christmas over her lap. “I saw the Unspeakables arrive and they started to obliviate people. I got nervous and put up a block in my mind without really thinking. They cast the spell without even checking my mind. Sloppy work really. Most of them are trained Legilimens.”
The Dark Lord is coming for dinner and he has brought a guest, Russian Ambassador Nikola who is here to smooth over the precise direction slight caused by Goyles mess up. Since the Russian Minister for Magic has something the Dark Lord wants, he plans to use Draco’s specific charms to earn him an invitation to Russia.
“Really?” Harry asked, half-impressed.
“I like the work,” Hermione said. “I find it rewarding and challenging.”
He was getting his speed back with each match. And while Draco was quick, Harry’s reflexes were fractionally better. Draco was as closely matched to Harry as a person could be in skill, and he was not afraid to dive or try a risky maneuver if necessary. Harry even found himself attempting risky techniques just to see if Draco would mimic him or try to outdo him which he always did—or at least tried to.
“Well, time to go again, Truth or Dare?” Longbottom asked.
“Oh, that’s wonderful,” Neville said inbetween sips of tea. He looked genuinely pleased. “You’ll be running things in no time.”
Harry hummed gutturally, “I’m
. Maybe he was a coward, after all. Surely, only cowards let their father’s sell their bodies to the highest bidder. Surely, only cowards let their mother die defending them.
“Wow, Nev, this place is amazing,” Harry said when the door closed behind him, sealing him inside whether he liked it or not.
“Really? Succubi can’t perform magic the way witches and wizards can. We both know that. It was part of what you gave up when you gave up your mortality.” Malfoy inched closer to the Succubus and said, in a calm and understanding tone, “You already tried the spell using a battery, and it exploded. If you try and activate the nexus, it will backfire, too. The spell is unstable, I can feel it.”
“We made it over that fire. Legend says we are a perfect match,” Harry said, explaining his thinking. He could feel every part of his body aching to pull Draco into a kiss, but he took a steadying breath. “You never know until you do it. Deliberating about something can only get you so far. Better to try and know for sure, I think.” Harry hoped his voice sounded steadier than his heart felt, less invested in the outcome. For several long moments, there was only the white noise of the festival around them and the sound of both their breathing.
Potter tried to place a hand on Draco’s shoulder, but Draco pulled away. “Because I just know,” he said, chanced a look at Potter and regretted it. Their eyes locked, the fiery green of Potter’s eyes scorched through the last of his resolve. “He wouldn’t.
“Come on, Draco, let’s do this. We can move into Grimmauld Place. What the hell, right? It’s technically just as much your home as it is mine. We can live together, and I can wake up early because you hate to, and I’ll make you breakfast and coffee every day. I’ll get better at making coffee, I swear. And you can still do your probation, and we can be together, and you can study to be a Potions Master. And we can have a future together.”
Ron huffed out a breath through his nose. “He’s dead. Found him in an abandoned building two days ago with all his equipment and notes. Been dead almost a month. Have you ever seen a body that’s been exploded, Harry? His skin was… ugh, I chucked up my lunch.”
“Because you went to the quidditch party with him and you were seen in very close quarters; some might even say you were canoodling.”
The string quartet played a soft suite. The sound wafted through the air like a summer breeze blowing across the Thames. Quiet chatter filled the ballroom. A hum of activity. A bustle of noises. Feet shuffling on the dance floor. Laughs echoing over the music. Glasses clinking in cheer.
“Hullo, Luna.”
“Your guess is as good as mine,” Draco lied.
“Sorry, just nervous and I hate seeing him with that guy,” Harry blurted it out before he could change his mind and then swallowed the drink in one gulp. He poured another and he and Charlie moved back toward the living room.
At my side Neville snorted. “Huh, how long was I back there? When I got here there were only like five people.”
Harry tugged his bag up on his shoulder and responded, “Hey, remember, you need me. Maybe don't be a dick?”
“Immensely,” Draco answered curtly. He forced a smile. Then, because it is polite to ask after people’s wellbeing, Draco added, “And how do you find the event, Ms. Granger? Is it to your liking?”
That made the both of them laugh, and they headed to another table where there was still a bottle of whisky. It was half full. Draco snatched it up, took the cup out of Harry’s hand and placed it down on the table along with his own.
bows. That paired with their outfits should have told me just what kind of party I was heading to, but I couldn’t focus on much of anything except how I could slip away unnoticed to go and speak with the caretaker.
I laughed and walked past him, leaving him in the dungeons alone.
.” Malfoy turned to face Potter and raised his eyebrows as if to say ‘do something.’
“Probably,” Harry said before Malfoy could say anything else rude to the poor witch who was just doing her job. It was just like Malfoy to take his anger out on undeserving people. If he was mad at Harry, then he should just say it. Clearly, Malfoy was still the same old uptight, rule-following prick he’s always been. Today, all the ‘partners help each other’ crap and the attraction thing, was a total fluke. Clearly, Pansy’s potion was wonky; he wasn’t attracted to Malfoy.
“Odette apparently leaked the story to the paper about you and Shacklebolt fighting.”
Without looking up from his notes, Draco raised his hand to stop her from saying more, “It is okay, Margie. Mister Potter can stay.”
The dreams were recurring and frightening to say the least. Each night, the same unspeakable scenario ran through Draco’s mind as if it were the only memory to which his mind would allow him access. Some nights, it was only flashes; scenes cut together like a poorly made collage. Those nights, he would wake in a shiver of sweats, but overall, his mind was clear and he could focus on the day ahead.
“You have to drink it all,” Malfoy said. He had one hand fanned out across his chest. The other held tight to his wand just in case. “Now, it should work by giving you the ability to see magical traces. You’ll have to differentiate between ambient magic and intentional magic, of course. Ambient magic will look neutral like a grayish white. The other spells will present as different colors just like with the traditional trace spell.”
“Potter, don’t be daft,” Malfoy called to him from behind, his voice sounding groggy as if he’d just awoken from a nap. He pulled out his wand. Even from a foot away, Harry still felt the magic of Malfoy’s Hawthorn wand call to him. He’d used it during the war and returned it to Malfoy after his trial cleared him. It seemed the wand still liked him. He often wondered if Malfoy hated that his wand had worked for Harry.
“It’s fading,” I said. “I see it heading toward that spot over there.” I pointed to the break in the trees. The sound of rushing water grew clearer.
Ron looked back and forth between me and Robards. “I didn’t know about the other incident, but I trust Harry. If he says something is going on, then there is something going on.”
“Fine. Just peachy,” he said. He looked down at his shoes. Leather oxfords with pointed toes. They looked expensive. They looked uncomfortable. “Can I have a moment to transfigure my shoes before we continue? They are ruined anyway and if you’re going to take off like a banshee out of hell again, I need to be able to keep up.”
Neville raised his eyebrows. “Sheesh, they are loved aren't they?” He looked around at the crowd. “I doubt I know this many people, let alone that they all like me enough to show up to a party like this.”
“Agreed.” Potter’s eyes lingered on Draco for a moment, then he turned on his heel and jogged towards the far end of the rows of mausoleums, ducking out of sight.
The study was Draco’s least favorite place in the Manor. It was too dark with it’s heavy floor to ceiling velvet curtains. And the artifacts his father collected lined the walls—some of them screaming, others insulting him, most radiating Dark magic so forcefully that it washed over Draco the moment he stepped inside.
Ginny sighed. “I already forgave you, Harry, last Christmas when you were a drunk mess and apologized to me for almost an hour.”
“He is quite beautiful, isn’t he?” Luna asked quietly, turning her attention from Potter to Draco, whose stomach had just jumped into his chest with all the force of a bludger.
“Very funny, Potter,” Malfoy responded.
The beast moved toward the man. Each step turned the ground to rot under his hoof. It spread like a stain across the forest floor. The humming around him grew so loud I could barely think. I couldn’t even think to move further away from the darkness in the earth as it seeped into the ground surrounding me.
“I’m going to do something. Is that okay?”
Draco nodded, his smoke-gray eyes sparkling with humor. “I am going to regret this study technique when I catch a cold.”
“What ya laughing at mate?” Ron asked.
“I’m afraid, I don’t know,” Luna sighed and then set her sights on the pigeon who was cooing comfortably in the sunlight on the windowsill, “I reckon, I’m in a similar situation.”
“Quite right, Mr. Malfoy,” Potter said, with a soft laugh that spread to his eyes. The noise pulled Draco from his thoughts and filled him with a sense of longing that he hadn’t not experienced in such great quantities since childhood.
They were close now, dangerously close. Harry felt a heat settle in him that had nothing to do with the bonfires, and waited for Draco to speak. Every inch of him tingled with the anticipation, and probably the after-effects of the Solstice Punch.
His whole life had been dictated to him by someone else, by the rest of the world and what they needed, what was best for them...but what about what was best for him? Dumbledore shepherded him along, taking any real choice away from him until all  that was left was for him to die. Now it was his turn to make choices, his turn to be happy. He wasn’t waiting anymore and he sure as hell wasn’t going to let the opinions of strangers dictate his life.
“Is it too late to accept that dinner invitation?”
I coughed, loud enough to let them know they weren’t alone, and then I stood up, stacking the loose files on my desk. I was tired of hearing what they had to say anyway.
His partner’s eyes widened, and he smiled in satisfaction. “That means she’s desperate for Life Energy, and desperate people will try anything… like casting a spell using Ley Line energy to boost it even when they have no innate magic of their own.”
“Um, what are you doing?” I looked at his hand confused.
Harry bit his tongue to keep from all the frustrated retorts to Draco’s question, instead settling on repeating himself. “I love you, Draco.”
I put my hand up to stop him from diving into the ‘we all love you’ lecture deep-end. “I know. I know.”
“Just wanted to stop by,” Harry lied, “I haven’t seen you in a while.”
I felt anger like a white hot iron poker in my gut. I may have gotten a little lost since the war, but nothing mattered more to me than putting bad guys where they belonged. Justice mattered. People’s live’s mattered. And the Ministry was slowly becoming the bad guy and I wasn’t letting them get away with it. Not after I died to save them.
At the Battle of Hogwarts Memorial, Harry runs into an old friend and an old rival.
He treated him like he always had—like a person—or at least like a person who got on every last nerve Draco ever had and ever would have. It was honest, at least. Unlike many of the other people he knew, Draco treated him in an completely mundane way and he was thankful for that.
This session left him no different than the first, except it was his fault this time. There could be no excuse that he did not know the affect Potter had on him. He let himself get carried away and got too close to Potter. So close, he could taste Potter’s breath. It was citrusy from the half-eaten orange on his breakfast tray. Draco found, in that moment, that he wanted to suck on Potter’s tongue until the taste of the orange disappeared.
“Indeed. Quite lovely,” Draco agreed because it was easier than disagreeing and because Mr. Potter’s proximity to him was making him highly uncomfortable. Feelings were surfacing. Feeling which he had long since resigned to ignore. Feelings that would only cause him trouble. Feelings that would surely ruin whatever sanity he managed to obtain since the trials.
Pansy’s eyebrows shot up in apparent interest. “Hmm, that’s oddly clever of you to work out, Potter. Most wizards forget that Ley Lines are even there since there’s so much ambient magic about.”
The door swung in, revealing Dean who stood tall in the doorway. He was smiling, beaming actually. He couldn’t have known we were there unless they had some kind of charm on the walkway, but I didn’t sense any magic. I could smell alcohol on his breath and noticed a bit of a flush in his cheeks. He looked like he might have started drinking before the party.
“Tea?” Greyjoy asked. She levitated the kettle and three cups. The kettle tipped itself and poured out three cups. The steam rose from them and I was reminded of the magical trace.
The rest of the day went off without a hitch. The crowd loved the memorial which ended up being a wall listing all the names of those who died and those who fought in the battle. There were etchings of wands around the edges that were charmed to move and casts spells from them. It was all very touching, at least, I knew it was supposed to be touching.
“Potter get up.”
Potter opened his mouth like he was going to speak, then closed it again, tightening his lips into a hard line. Then his face softened, and he said, “Okay, but if the potion was supposed to be stronger around the person you were attracted to, and it was affecting me so much around you then…”
“Thank you.” Potter licked his lips. The motion woke up Draco’s desire, not that it had been slumbering too deeply after the day he’d had. “As I was saying, I have been ignoring how I felt for a long time now. In fact, I haven’t even let myself entertain the idea of being attracted to someone since everything that happened with Dean.”
Shaking the thought of how much money Luna could save on parchment if she wrote smaller, Harry refocused and felt his stomach tie in knots. It was bad enough he was going to have an exclusive tell-all article printed in the Prophet, but the fact that everyone seemed to know things that he had thought were secret; well, that was starting to worry him, “Did Ginny tell you?”
Again a wicked smile spread across her face. “I will get the story one way or the other. At least this way, you also get to save lives. Isn’t that sort of your thing, Mr. Potter?”
I coughed loudly so she would stop. “Yes, mom, I know.”
“Yeah, that’s…” Harry trailed off and turned to face Draco. There were tears in his eyes, his cheeks flushed pink. “Are you okay?”
“Don’t drink that,” I snapped at Malfoy just as he was taking the levitated cup and bringing it to his mouth.
“I won’t let you just have my potion.” Malfoy crossed his free arm over his chest. The motion jostled me and I stumbled forward into him. I placed my free hand on his chest to steady myself.
Robards scowled. “I’m not doing this for you, Potter. I am doing this for all the auror’s who trusted the DMLE and are being mind wiped without consent.”
The Succubus froze. Her features sharpened, and if her skin wasn’t already a pale grey, she would have gone white. “You know nothing.”
But there was still no reply.
This wasn’t real, Draco reminded himself. Potter was still under the effects of the potion and obviously concussed. That didn’t stop his breath from hitching, nor did it stop his body from aching with want.
Hermione sighed at my side. She was looking out at the small gathering of our friends, eyes wide. I touched her arm with my free hand, and she placed her hand over mine. I whispered to her. “Do you happen to hate crowds, too?”
“Agh,” he said when he was finished and handed the bottle to Harry. “Bottoms up, Potter.”
I looked directly at her for a moment. Her eyes were a striking green, not unlike my own. She stared back, unwavering. “Are you admitting to illegally obliviating someone to an auror?”
He was scanning Draco’s reflection. Draco felt his body inches away from his own. “Heh, right.” Draco let out a sigh, desperately trying to banish the image of Potter pushed against him earlier. Ignoring the pull in his gut that made him want to push Potter away, Draco closed his eyes and turned around.
“Harry, let’s just talk this through.”
“I could ask you the same thing,” I replied. Except I couldn’t. He used to at least live down here, have a connection to the dungeons. Yay for nostalgia. I was just walking around, but I didn’t have a better comeback, so I stood my ground.
Harry rolled his eyes. They’d just had this argument last week. Harry said that Hermione was better, and Draco practically fell out of his chair as he stood up to challenge her. She refused because she’s Hermione and has no need to prove herself to Draco, which only served to make him furious. Harry found the whole thing hilarious.
I gritted my teeth. “I can’t tell you.”
Draco lamented his pathetic luck as he headed back to his desk. The conference room emptied before he had the patience to get up and face Potter again. When the memo for this morning’s meeting had arrived on his desk, Draco had just known that Potter messed up. He’d warned the dolt that the Succubus was too powerful to approach alone. Yet, did Potter listen? Of course not, he just put on his hero-hat and damned the consequences.
,” Harry whispered, pointing his wand towards the dumpsters. If the thing was cloaking itself, or hiding behind the dumpsters, the spell would let Harry know. He felt a surge run though him as his magic focused and coursed out of him, though his wand. Then the dumpster nearest him was pushed away in one loud, screeching motion, to reveal two women locked in a seriously porn-worthy kiss.
“I know, but he is a bit of a know-it-all. It gets sort of tiring.”
That didn’t seem to satisfy Potter. He bit his bottom lip in a devastatingly handsome way that made the hair on Draco’s arms stand up. “But you said this was foolish.”
Hesitantly, Harry laid his hand in Draco’s open palm. “Are we jumping together?”
Ron laughed. “Fair. I need another drink. You want one?”
“Well, she’s right,” I said. That earned me a smug hrumph from Hermione that seemed to tell me Ron didn’t agree with her.
Harry watched Draco mount his broom swiftly. The motion was one of practice, of patience. Harry wasn’t so stubborn that he couldn’t admit, at least to himself, he envied the ease with which Draco did most things. Like his body was built for each situation, perfectly able to flex and fold where needed. Like water fitting into a container, Draco’s body could adapt to his surroundings effortlessly.
Only if this were two years ago and Harry had been confronting Draco like this, he would have been challenging him to a duel, but now he was challenging him to something else entirely.
“Cute, Potty. You still think your taunts affect me?”
as misplacing precious, rare magic. Do you take me for Longbottom?” His eyes went wide and he fanned a hand across his chest which made Harry think of his Aunt Petunia whenever she had a particularly nasty piece of gossip about one of their neighbors.
“Exactly.” Without thinking, he clapped a hand on Malfoy’s shoulder, a friendly gesture that he often traded with Ron, but when his hand made contact with Malfoy, a white-hot fire shot through him like a shooting star, and Harry felt himself swimming in his own arousal. It was almost as overwhelming as the Succubus’ magic had been, only he knew he was in control this time. He moved his hand away slowly, but missed the contact immediately.
Ron came up behind her and took her heels and transfigured them for her using her wand. He managed to turn them into proper sneakers after two tries and helped her into them. They laughed the whole time.
“Yes, Father.”
“Got bored,” Draco said, scowling at Harry for shoving him, but it held none of the venom it once did. Now it was more like an inside joke for them. “Snuck out through the study’s Floo and then hoofed it from the Three Broomsticks.”
I nodded and placed the gift on the table next to the one Ron put down a moment ago. “Work’s been busy. Lots of papers to file.” I added on a sheepish smile so everyone knew it was okay to laugh. My desk duty wasn’t a secret. The reason for it was, but it was common knowledge that I’d been on desk duty for a while.
Ron turned to me and smirked. Clearly they had this conversation often. “It’s one of the many things I am sure you will remedy once you are appointed Advisor to the Minister.”
Something in the back of Harry’s mind told him to send a Patronus to his Auror partner, but he didn’t have time to wait for backup; the longer he waited, the more likely it was that the woman was dying. Harry wasn’t going to let that happen, not when he was here and able to fight.
“Sure,” Neville said. He eyed me and there was still a hint of a blush in his cheeks, so I winked and he bit his bottom lip to keep from laughing.
Malfoy blushed. His face a soft pink. “Well, turns out George found my little speech hilarious and won’t let me live it down.”
When I first found out who I was that day in Diagon Alley, I thought how nice it was to finally have some attention after the Dursley’s and the small scraps they tossed at me. I’d liked it. Hogwarts was a different story though. I couldn’t even shower without someone coming in to spy on me. To see The Boy Who Lived. No where except my dorm was safe from prying eyes. It grew worse the older I got. Some of the attention was sexual and that made me uncomfortable, but it went deeper than that. It was the eyes. They followed me, always watching. I couldn’t exist without someone looking at me. The worst part was when I realized Voldemort could see me—see through my own eyes. Even alone I was being watched. After that, any attention I got completely soured and all it did was make me taste bile.
Draco was saved from further explanation when the returning form flew in with an adjoining letter. Pansy grabbed them out of the air and unfolded the form. She placed it on the table nearest Potter and motioned for him to sign it. Potter did so without hesitation.
“You put my hand there,” Harry retorted. He turned to look over his shoulder. Ryder was gone, but Harry spotted Luna watching them. “What was that about anyway?”
“Fine, then say what you have to say, so I can go back to ignoring you.”
The walk back to the Great Hall and the expectant crowd was easier now that I released some of the tension coiling in my gut. I’d been in a right mood ever since the hearing was announced. The news of the trial came two days before the Ministry fundraiser, so I had been deep in the drink and feeling restless. That night when I saw Malfoy leave during in the middle of the fifth speech about how amazing the Ministry was because they raised money for orphans or some other shit, I decided to follow him. At first because I fancied a fight, but when I caught up to him he was getting his coat and before I knew it we were pushing each other against walls and I was sinking to my knees. If Ron knew I hooked up with Malfoy, he would likely commit me to the Mental Ward at St. Mungo’s since our past had been nothing if not toxic and destructive. Not that he didn’t want to already simply for kicking the shit out the Ministry official. But add in Malfoy and he would be sure I was losing my mind. I wasn’t entirely sure if I didn’t belong in St. Mungo’s myself, but I needed someone who didn’t want anything from me except what I was willing to give and Malfoy fit that bill. Probably because he wanted the same thing—a release.
“So what if the rumors are false. Why should I condescend myself to care?”
Of course, Draco had wanted to see Mr. Potter’s interference on his behalf as something meaningful, but their history said otherwise. Mr. Potter did not speak directly to Draco when he stepped in on his behalf at the trial. He simply showed up, unannounced, spoke to Draco’s character and gave his very decided opinion on why Draco should be shown leniency, and then left even more swiftly than he had arrived.
I had been so wrapped up in my escape plan that I hadn’t seen Malfoy heading to me. He was standing a few feet away from me with a champagne flute held delicately in one hand. There was a sheen of sweat on his forehead but it didn’t make him look sweaty. There was a hint of something in the way he watched me; amusement. It was clear in the way his eyes raked across my body.
Draco attempted to be happy for his friend, but found himself sulking. If Pansy were to gain favor, she may be forced to no longer acquaint herself with Draco. That would leave him scrounging around at the bottom of society life all by himself. He tried not to scowl at the thought since he was often reminded his scowl was unattractive.
It hit me then—the coldness I’d felt it at the crime scene and again in the bathroom. The smile disappeared from my face just as the lights flickered. I heard Hermione gasp and then everything went black.
Draco turned to him, licked his lips seductively, teasingly, and said, “No, I make the rules here, Potter, and you will like it.”
Potter didn’t know her well, so he took her at her word and said, “Actually, yes. I need the potion Robards said you were working on. The Succubus one.”
“And in the process got yourself benched and awaiting a hearing to see if you are still allowed to do your job. How many other people do you think you could have saved in the last few months if you’d handled that case differently?”
“I like it.”
It was too hot for tea. Too hot to be in the forest for any reason other than necessity. Was I really supposed to believe she was just out here gathering leaves for tea? Could I trust this woman I barely knew? How was I supposed to know the trace hadn’t been leading me to her?
“Oo, you naughty little Gryffindor. Calling me by my given name. You’ll have to try harder than that,
“Bit slow. Out of practice, Potter?”
“Harry Potter, you absolute cock,” Pansy shouted in lieu of a proper hello. She looked wild. Her hair was frizzy, which Harry was sure wasn’t on purpose. Her cheeks were flushed pink and she had char marks on her fingertips.
I opted for standing even though the effort of running through the forest was catching up to me now that my adrenaline was fading. I wanted to be ready if she tried something. I felt a pain in my right side as I tried to steady my breaths. “I’d still like to know how you knew it was us out here.”
With a heavy sigh, Draco answered. “The letters.”
She sighed, but nodded. “Fine.” Then she plastered a fake smile on her face and took a long swig of her champagne when Hermione arrived back with their drinks.
“I—I don’t know.”
I shook my head. Ron had been promoted to Junior Auror in Charge last year and had been sheepish with his new authority around me. He’d felt guilty for beating me out for it and sometimes I could see the guilt written all over his face and it made me want to run away and die in a hole because how did I make him believe me when I said I didn’t want it.
