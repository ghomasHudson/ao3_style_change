Blaise was a man of priorities, the first one right now being Harry – it was another point Daphne could not be allowed to learn of, and Blaise might have even felt somewhat guilty at deceiving her, had he not known that this particular snake's bite was more vicious and deadly than could be surmised from her sweet smile and lovely features. No, the Greengrass heiress could very well take care of herself. Besides, Blaise felt as if he had never been more justified: after all, this was not even to further his own selfish goals but to save Harry.
Cautiously, Lucius observed his friend. Of course he had known that Severus wouldn't react well to the news but he hadn't thought it would be quite this bad.
But the thought was already implanted into his mind firmly and strong enough to see over the bitter resentment, to see
In all honesty, Harry had half expected another snake-faced abomination, and was left with a sense of hollow disappointment when a rather unremarkable gentleman greeted his vision – he had learned long ago that it was easier to hate if the object of your loathing couldn't really be seen as a person anymore, just an abstract personification of anything dark and evil. But in defiance to his imagination the man standing there like a statue of black marble was no grotesque monster but a wizard like any other: neither extraordinarily pale nor tanned with short dark hair that just started to grey, silver strands mingling with the blackness. An elegant, tight dress robe hugged his narrow frame, falling down his lean shoulders like a dark waterfall interwoven with barely visible symbols and swirls of dark grey and blue.
For over two hours they sat and talked and enjoyed the descending night and the lights that flickered to life below them, sometimes falling silent for several moments, just watching.
It was not as drastic as an unbreakable vow and not as dramatic, but certainly effective enough. Who would ever willingly deal with or employ an oath-breaker?
Harry would probably have made more of an effort to be polite, if Ives hadn't been looking at the other man with barely contained fury simmering under his skin and in his lively blue eyes. It was unsettling and confusing and Harry would have liked to ask what this was all about but didn’t wanted to meddle into the clearly private affairs of a married couple.
With his forefinger he prodded the liquid with intent and the Pensieve was activated: the silvery mass started to swirl quickly for a few moments until it started to become transparent and still, a looking glass showing Harry's rooms from above like a window in the ceiling.
"More or less." Blaise answered, the corners of his lips curling upwards, thrilled by the sizzling tension in the air around them, not yet willing to interrupt and destroy whatever game they were playing by confessing what Harry had done behind their backs; not when Draco was so beautiful in front of him in that cold, steely, sharp way of his, moving steadily forwards like a white-furred nundu on a hunt; not when Blaise himself still felt an echo of Harry's lips, of his hands against his chest and his trousers were still uncomfortably tight.
But no, it was nothing like that; he had dreamt that he hadn't regained his magic and that he had to leave the Wizarding World because of it. Somehow all the changes of his body had been reverted, he didn't know why or how, but he hadn't even thought about it then. Logic, as is known, is not important for the dreamer. In any case, he had been sent back to the Dursleys, abandoned by his friends, left alone once more with people who hated him.
Something moved within, denting the shadows upwards towards the sky. For a moment it looked like a long dead tree whose naked skeleton had been swallowed by a bog until only the sharp tips of broken branches remained afloat. But these branches shoved upwards towards the sky and the tips joined into thicker limps which joined again and again until only two of them remained, two smooth boughs that were perfect mirrors of one another, arching towards an invisible centre between them.
Doing something. Moving away probably; but there were insistent fingers rubbing against his neck and the back of his head, running through his hair sensuously and black, blown eyes stared at him so damn intently until Harry couldn't look any longer and closed his own.
Absentmindedly Harry noticed their open expression and unguarded stances and that all of them wore their wands in closed holsters at their hips; a safe place with no danger of the precious tools being lost and easily accessible at the same time but not quickly. It was unlikely that they meant them ill.
Draco let out a flow of air, disbelievingly trying to come up with something that would make their parents reconsider.
her collection (there was nothing better to efficiently get and spread certain information), bespoke of a certain sense of awareness for the situation: if Blaise and Draco thought that enabling Potter to speak with his friends was the logical thing to do, that it was crucial for a successful mating, and that it didn't betray emotions they shouldn't have towards the Boy Wonder, they would just have asked one of their parents to give up a mirror, Mrs Zabini was even currently living at Malfoy Manor and not even using her own mirrors...
"Good." Adler gave him a rare, approving smile. "Now, I believe you were speaking about what happened after our submissives talked."
But a tiny part of him flared, not in defence of himself, but of Harry. The Gryffindor wouldn't be so cruel, surely. Harry might not really care for them, might be angry at them or even hate them, he might feign his cooperation and acceptance of the situation, but he was not so cruel as to lie about something like this and fake understanding and forgiveness so convincingly when there was absolutely no need to.
The question took Harry aback, not having expected the man to just ignore his threats. Nonetheless Harry shook his head in answer, terse and tense. What would a name change?
And then the very same healer who was responsible for Harry had lead them away into the very same direction they had taken their friend.
"In a way." He said evasively, partly in answer to Draco's first question. Then, deciding to just press on and deal with the consequences if and when they arose, he tilted his head curiously, taking in every hitch in his lover's smooth façade that might be indicative of his mood.
"I would you refrained from insulting my husband, Lucius." And for the first time, there was something more than indifference in his voice, something undeniably dark and sinister. "I promise you, Ives will not influence Mr Potter or foment trouble, but he might help ground him a little bit. Why don't you bring both of our portraits to Italy and we will keep an eye on the young submissive."
At nearly the same time, the wizarding community in Germany had reacted to the war in Britain with another security measure as was their wont whenever an act of violence happened, be it within their own country and jurisdiction or not.  But this time they had brought forth an innovation that would actually gain currency in major parts of Europe. A Wira Wespe had invented a certain charm that could be ingrained into a wand and prevent the wielder from using certain spells, mainly the Unforgivables and other potentially deathly charms which included a large variety of offensive magic.
Harry gave him a tiny smile. He was still a little bit irritated that the Italian had kissed him even after being aware of the magical control Harry had fought with, but he couldn't just reject an honest apology and after all, he had felt himself how hard to resist they were, those persuasive whispers of one's magic that made you completely ignore reason.
Lead by his lover's voice, Blaise's eyes found the dark silhouettes of the two Vykélari as they rushed over the night sky, two enormous shadows obscuring the stars as they flew eastwards. Damn, they were so close to the wards already!
"During his transformation his magical core expanded. It is like a solid sphere, Severus, and now the content has been used to form the surface of a larger sphere, a hollow one, leaving him with practically no magic to use for now. Once he has had enough time to rest and fill it up again, though, he will be an incredibly powerful wizard! And once he has mated, some of this power will be used to form and feed a unique bond to his mates that will allow them to access and use that magic, shifting it from one to the other at will. Power-wise they will be stronger than even the Dark Lord and Grindlewald together, Severus! That is why dark and light lords both have always tried to kill off mated submissives, using whatever they could think of: poison, traps, anything. Even Vykélari dominants tended to murder submissives who were either unwilling to mate or already mated. That is why they became extinct, Severus, for ten long generations!"
Well, or something close to that. But though it was a problem and annoying as hell, she could deal with the public's aggravation at behalf of their saviour. After all, people were rather forgetful with the right incentives and if she played her part right, no one would speak about it in a year.
Draco, Blaise and Harry have their date: together with the Battellis – an Italian family the Slytherins have sworn to secrecy – they play a kind of aerial battle on chariots pulled by Pihassan horses (winged horses) while heading for the foots of the mountains. Once there, the three of them skydive to the ground where they spent the afternoon and the Slytherins show Harry a Pensieve Theatre. Afterwards they apparate to a restaurant floating over Rome.

With renewed enthusiasm, Harry climbed out of the ridiculously large bed and walked around it towards the curved foot bench. Like the previous morning he found a pile of clothing, which his two captors had laid out for him when they had accompanied him back to his rooms the previous evening. Harry had been too tired to mind much and hadn't even complained when Blaise had vanished behind the curtain to the side of the king size bed and returned with a fresh pyjama which he had deposited on the bed. It seemed they didn't trust him to dress properly and Harry had thought he should maybe tell them that there was a reason why he had been so tastelessly clothed during their school days, but really, the Dursleys were none of their business; and he had still been so very tired.
All the while, Harry went on ignoring his interjection, too busy evading their gazes. "And you couldn't kill Dumbledore; you
"Yeah." Harry said dryly, a bitter smile on his lips. "Well, it's over. But it certainly doesn't make this any easier."
The fiery tube moved, bending and flexing like a graceful dancer, rising from a pedestal of flames …
But Daphne was also mostly just and a true believer of reason and logic, the traits of Ravenclaw almost as dominant in her as the Slytherin qualities and Blaise knew that keeping a levelled head was essential to swaying the elder Greengrass heiress. And acting the part of an equal asking for a favour and not a petitioner pleading for help. Even if that was exactly what he was.
"These are the last seven Malfoys who mated with submissive Vykélari and of course their husbands." Lucius answered with a self-congratulatory half-smile. "I thought we might as well leave the mirror-connection open so that you can consult them whenever you have a question concerning your charge. How is he, by the way?"
But they would be happy. Blaise knew he and Draco worked well together, they loved each other and they were very much alike. It was enough, wasn't it? Even though their rare disagreements could become rather violent sometimes - not in a physical way - and even though sex between them was more a satisfying battle than lovemaking. A very satisfying battle, though.
A wave of relief flooded Harry as he saw the glittery, silver powder and – not missing a beat – he took a handful and threw it into the red-hot embers. Instinctively, he averted his face as the fire blazed up and turned to emerald green flames.
Severus nodded. "During his fifth year, to keep such things as the Ministry incident from happening. Unfortunately he was a lousy student. He thought to be so clever, thought he could use the connection to his advantage without the Dark Lord noticing it. His naivety and impulsiveness cost him his godfather. Good riddance, I'd say. In any case it was a wake-up call for Potter, which was much needed."
Up close, half-naked and bathed in the golden light of the early afternoon sun, they reminded him of an image of Michelangelo's David, or at least Blaise did with his locks. Sure, his face was a little bit more … angular, his hair not as curly, his body definitely darker and he wore that dark vine red bathing suit that was … too tight to hide anything. But there were similarities that made his whole body tighten…
The manoeuvre had slowed him down considerably and with a few more forward flaps he came to a stop entirely and let himself fall to his feet, crouching behind the smouldering skeleton of a large bush. His heart drumming madly in his chest Draco set Giallina down into the burned dirt and with a last warning to her not to interfere at all he made to turn around, already fearing what he would see.
His eyes must have widened comically because both of the Slytherins started to chuckle at him; well, Zabini did. Malfoy's answer was more along the lines of a derisive snort.
to have this discussion every evening?” Molly called out, more loudly than necessary to silence her daughter and everyone else; her pointed glance rushed over them all with furious disapproval – over Ginny’s flushing face and Ron’s defiant glare that wilted under her own, to Arthur’s apologetic expression and at last to Harry. Her gaze remained on him.
Of course Harry had on some level suspected this might possibly happen, had known that they would most likely restrict his magic in some way or another, but the reality of it was more disturbing than he could have imagined: he could feel his magic within him almost like a physical entity, pushing against the barrier, twisting and struggling, and he strained and fought along with it. The streams within him solidified and dissolved only to appear at a different point beneath his skin, testing out its cage for weak points and finding none, and it was so rapid and arbitrary that it left him dizzy and panting, his muscles spasming ineffectively.
Lucius might have enjoyed dominating someone, or using his instincts against him to subdue him, but Draco did not and neither did Blaise. At least not someone meant to be a spouse.
It gnawed at his insides, the question eating itself deeper and deeper into his guts like sizzling acid. And when they were barely there, only a few metres parting them from the mirror, he couldn't help but utter a quiet "Don't do it!". Only Taide reacted at all, his hand moving to grasp, and slightly squeeze Harry's upper arm.
He would fly. Maybe if he showed himself eager to learn, willing to yield to at least some of their wishes, maybe they'd allow him to stay until he could end this farce?
James and Sirius and every one of those dim-witted morons that had favoured their little ragtag group of bullies and braggarts over those that were genuinely talented and eager to learn and evolve; All of them had conditioned Severus to feel this way, to hate them and desire nothing more than to retaliate and to prove how much inferior they truly were.
"But nonetheless you got mated to a Malfoy." He said and wondered if that was what he was supposed to learn: that there was no way out, that he had no choice in the end but to mate them.
“You know, the way it seemed to me, what they said was very likely true…” he said finally, and tensed in spite of himself; because he knew whatever he said would not save him from this discussion. That much he had learned over the previous week after the Malfoy heir’s acquittal.
Seeing it now – if Harry had only the slightest interest in architecture and if he hadn't been distracted by what stood on the circular drive leading away from the Manor's entrance, he might have been impressed.
"Then you know why we came." Molly hissed, furious beyond reason that this woman could stand there so carefree and serene and admit so freely to having kidnapped their Harry, because really, why else would she expect them?
Harry swallowed past the sudden dryness in his throat. The only promises the Slytherins had given him were that they would let him return to Hogwarts and not let anyone try and make Harry enter a mating bond if he was unwilling. God, this was embarrassing. Had his best friend really made the two man who intended to court Harry vow not to force him into, well, marriage and sex?
It was as if a veil had been ripped from Draco’s eyes because once he had seen her, ever more corpses and severed body parts started to stand out against the smouldering ruins of the cloister garden, like the requisites of a nightmare.
And he couldn't ban those memories any longer from his mind, those memories of a child raised in the darkness of a cupboard, always on the run when he was not playing House Elf, running from a barking, growling dog and his vicious, fat cousin and his goons. Memories of that loud, obnoxious whale of a man who treated his nephew so harshly it was a small miracle that the young man he had become had any self-confidence to begin with – never mind that Severus had never found the Potter brat lacking in that regard, rather the contrary much to his regret.
Merlin, Blaise thought with a critical glance towards his fiancé, that wasn't going to end well. Draco's jaw was clenched tightly and he just knew if he got a chance to speak, the infamous Malfoy temperament would make him say something unfortunate.
Forcefully, Draco wrestled that counterproductive thought down. Harry and his friends had survived one of the most dangerous wizards of their time hunting them, along with a horde of followers, some of which ranked among the most sadistic and insane personas that Draco had ever had the misfortune of meeting (Fenrir Greyback still gave him the creeps and the only redeeming quality that the werewolf had recently acquired, was being dead). The two Gryffindors would survive, they might even find a way to escape on their own: as much as the thought displeased him – or not, given the current circumstances – Weasley and Granger were anything if not resourceful.
All that pent up fury, frustration and fear, Draco released with a single, long breath. When whining didn't help, then it was time to act, time to focus.
"Not because of that reason…" Blaise stated, shaking his head. "You should forgive him, because it was maybe a wise decision. He wouldn't have survived with us at his side, Draco. He would have died long before even reaching the age of his inheritance."
Suddenly, Harry grinned a smile as narrow as his eyes. If the prophet won't come to the mountain, the mountain must go to the prophet: as he couldn't just go and get help, the help needed to come to him, and now that he thought about it,
But as soon as the wards pulsed with recognition the roses were forced to retreat, a jerking and writhing mass of rustling leaves and creaking twigs.
It didn't take long until Harry dozed off and he never knew how he got back to his rooms that evening.
"Get out immediately!" he hissed, appalled for no reason he could think of, looking back and piercing both the old healer and the much younger Mediwizard with a fiery, hateful glance that promised pain and torture. He didn't care why he cared at the moment. He just did. And the sight of a creature meant for free, unbridled night flights, struggling with his bonds in fear and agony had made him furious beyond any sane thought.
Finally they were close enough to the ground and Draco let go of his hands, pushing himself away from them and Harry saw his wings appearing slowly as if they melted out of his back around his shoulders, not disturbing his flight. He could feel Blaise behind him doing the same, the copper and bronze wings brushing slightly against his shoulders before they started to fan out a bit.
Laughing, Draco leisurely waved the brunet closer. "It sounds worse than it is, like most magical theory. Don't worry, you have a talent with magic, I know you do." He gave him a wink, delighting in his newfound hobby of embarrassing his former enemy that proved to be such a good distraction to his own trepidation. Merlin, but he could blush so sweetly.
But their Gryffindor was still here where they could protect him and their enemy had transformed from a bodiless phantom of smoke and shadows into something real, had solidified into a being of flesh and blood that could be fought and could be defeated. Even better: it turned out to be an enemy they knew so that they could follow him if he retreated and take him down, could deduce where to find Harry's friends and save them – there was no doubt in his mind that they were the bargaining tool used against the submissive in this vile attempt at blackmail, not after Harry's reaction to Blaise's so innocently voiced proposal – and decide on the best suited strategy for all of these options based on the knowledge they held over their enemy.
Draco grinned crookedly. "None taken, I was inexperienced and young. Of course, any smear campaign I started now would be much subtler and cleverer, be assured."
, Harry added within the privacy of his own mind, before dashing the vial to the ground with all the force he could muster, smashing it against the many black and white, small stones that formed the intricate, geometric mosaic beneath his feet. It exploded with a loud clash in a mess of sticky green-golden drops, artful splashes and glistening shards. Clipped sounds of outrage filled the room, the perfect circumflex to the shattering of the glass and one or two of his captors raised their wands higher, the threat clear and unmistakable.
He turned to leave just as he heard a clapping sound and then a cacophony of pops all around him, precursors of the almost two dozen house-elves that appeared out of the thin air. Curiously they stared at him, but their main focus was on Zabini.
There were actually only two persons Blaise could think of that fitted all these categories and who might be able and willing to answer a call within the next few hours. One of them was Severus Snape who at this very moment resided in Malfoy Manor which could be called a not exactly ideal location in the best of cases: If Blaise contacted his former professor and headmaster there directly, both his mother and Draco's parents would be alerted and Amalyne and Narcissa might come to Italy to force Harry into mating with them once he was brought back home from the Lanais, or worse, lie in wait for Harry at the safe house where the emergency portkey would send the submissive to once Blaise and Draco got him to use the one he had been gifted with, or, if it was lost, the one Draco still carried.
Blaise felt ready to scream, his heart beating so fast that it bordered on painful, his eyes stinging with frustration.
It was because he was a halfblood, Narcissa told herself, he didn't understand the significance of having a submissive in the family because he was often unaware of the oldest, most deeply ingrained pure blood traditions. No light or dark wizard would underestimate the force the Zabini and Malfoy families would become due to Potter's power bound and wielded by both their heirs.
And most of all, Petunia's scrunched up face, always looking at Potter as if he was something her sister-in-law's foul dog had thrown up on her carpet. Lyly's only sister.
"However, contrary to your wild assumptions, I am not particularly interested in a mating between the two of us. I am almost thrice your age and hardly an appropriate mate for a sweet, young submissive such as yourself." With a vague sweeping wave of his hand the Italian gestured from Harry's feet to his bare chest, reducing his worth to a warm body filled to the brim with iridescent magic.
Little did they know that the spark of doubt that they had sowed in the mind of the young guardia member, Ettore Carracci, had turned into a blazing fire, making him abandon protocol.
If it should come to that, he at least wanted to have this meagre portion of Harry's life, this one day of seven years of knowing each other where the three of them had truly been happy together. Close.
"I need you to send a letter for me. I haven't been shown to the owlery yet." He hoped the elf would buy the impression that what he was doing was totally within his privileges, if only he managed to present himself confident enough... but it seemed to waver.
“I never said anything of the sort, Draco.” His father drawled in a pointless, futile attempt of appearing innocent.
After what seemed like an eternity of icy staring, Draco finally nodded. "As you wish, Ives. Harry, if you want to, we can meet you afterwards and teach you a little bit about flying. I think we should still wait with the magic lessons until you are a little bit more rested."
Nodding once, Blaise turned, locking gazes with Draco. Scratches littered the pale face, fear was etched into the stormy grey of his eyes, but he was composed, steady, and Blaise’s own worried thoughts were mirrored in his grave expression.
“And no one,” Narcissa said, her words sounding off somehow, bitter and forced, but also resigned, “no one thought to inform us? Their parents?”
He was the Boy-Who-Had-Survived-Too-Many-Times-To-Count, the one who others looked to for protection. He wasn't supposed to need it in return and though he knew just how ridiculous that notion was, the feeling was there nonetheless.
Adler confirms that it is possible to close an established mating bond and thus maintain a level of privacy. He then tells Draco about Harry's deal with Ives (Harry giving the Slytherins the chance to woo him in return for a free pass to leave on the 31st of August). Draco is angry but understands why Harry did it. He and Blaise later decide not to mention anything to Harry and instead make it seem as if they had planned to return to Hogwarts with Harry all along. Harry believes them.
"No part of me lives to make you miserable nowadays. But to say that some part of me always lived to get your attention, now that just might have some truth to it."
"You might want to magically lighten your body so that your wings won't have to carry quite as much weight. But don't overdo it, you need a certain weight or the wind will make you his new plaything." Draco interrupted from behind them and as if in reaction to his comment, Harry could see Blaise's stance shifting: the Italian leaned forwards into the headwind and his feet dug further into the ground to keep himself still; his wings kept beating steadily now, as he fought against the wind that was now a considerable force against the wide plane of his wings and his reduced weight.
His hawthorn wand clenched tightly in his hand, Draco knew that there was little he could do short of hexing the other man. But would he even succeed, was it at all possible? Not only was Harry like the brightly flaring sun compared to the softly shining moon in terms of their magical power, but he also – technically speaking – held the allegiance of Draco's wand, the same magical tool he had taken from the Malfoy heir by force during his escape from the manor, only to return it after the war in a personal offer of peace…
But it seemed Blaise was taking pity on him: he withdrew and a moment later Draco shuddered at the sudden cool wetness between his legs in consequence to the muttered cleaning and lubrication charms. Persisting yet gentle hands urged his legs up into a bent position that caused his back to arch and his ass to stick into the air, easily accessible for his lover.
Soothing magical sparks once again sprung to the surface of his hands, tingling like the comforting heat of a fire on cold skin.
He knew that he hadn't lied earlier: he wasn't bent, he certainly liked women, too, and he had never been much interested in men before, but dammit, could anyone fault him if the vision in front of him made his stomach do summersaults and his pulse flutter? And something else swell traitorously…
The Comissario swallowed drily, remembering the bird, black as tar, that had swooped down on him. It had nimbly evaded his shield charm and he had raised his arms in the nick of time to protect his head, just as it descended on him, scratching him viciously. A screech, inhuman and rough, then Zabini had been there, grabbing the hawk in both of his clawed hands and cradling the wildly fighting and flapping bird against his chest.
A drop ran down his chin towards the line of his jaw and Draco was there, his tongue following the precious liquid. Then he was sucking at his skin, maybe hunting for that rich taste that must have mixed with the one of his own skin. Teeth grazed him, bit him, followed by soothing licks, sucking lips…
Blaise’s new, unusually pale skin colour should have made him look sickly but instead he looked a little vampiric: startling dark eyes surrounded by still olive skin that nonetheless was just a nuance too light for him, making his lips more prominent and well, a constant focus for Harry’s suddenly too short attention span. He straightened his hair out and coloured the strands a tad lighter, which Harry was sorely sorry for, because somehow he loved that slightly curly shock of hair.
Within a moment he had yanked the offending trousers down sufficiently, baring lean hips, strong thighs, twitching muscles and oh so wonderfully, luxuriously smooth skin that just begged him for a more thorough exploration; but as soon as his fingers glided over the side of Blaise's leg upwards, the Italian started to struggle against his hold and Draco had to press his whole body flush against his lover's to keep him in his grip.
So instead she passively watched her friend hesitate and almost falter without uttering even one supportive word, and for a moment Narcissa imagined the silence freezing between them, layers of ice on a frozen lake, and Amalyne drowning in the dark depths beneath her. Drowning in silence. While she was freezing to death in it.
Severus Snape halted for a moment as he strode into the parlour that he always favoured when coming to the Manor. It was smaller than most, plainer and therefore more to his liking.
He flashed Harry another sharp-edged smile full of teeth. "For as long as you do what I say, your friends won't be hurt and you … won't have to go on a suicide mission. A win-win situation, is it not?"
With sure movements he brought the tip of his wand to his bare, left forearm. "But I promise you that if you should betray Harry's trust for selfish reasons, or hurt him deliberately through any action of yours, I will spare neither trouble nor expense to ensure that you are given your due."
Even the House Elves' behaviour echoed their mistress's grief and resentment: It had taken over five minutes for one of them to answer the mirror call, even though the runtish male that finally opened the connection had to have been alerted almost immediately by the incisive chiming Blaise knew Daphne used as a signal for an incoming two-way mirror call. And the brat argued with him – most politely, mind – for another few minutes about whether or not his concern was important enough to warrant waking up his 'mistress Daphne'. If he had to guess, Blaise would say that the girl had been quite open with her aversion towards Draco (and Blaise by extension) and her servants had picked up on it. Oh, of course the Elf was never really discourteous towards him, but he was anything but obliging.
"In any case it will be difficult now to earn his trust, when the only atonement that really would have counted has already been offered by Ives." Draco said as he stood and turned to leave. There was nothing more to say and he found himself eager to return to Blaise and Harry, to reassure himself of Harry's sincerity, his forgiveness, and that it would still be possible to win him over. Of course he knew that this endeavour would require a considerable amount of subtleness, after all, their submissive's decision to collaborate with Ives was understandable, nothing that Draco or Blaise could fault him for and earning his trust and favour now was a delicate, intricate affair that could not be tackled upfront. That would just catch Harry's suspicion, possibly make him think that they were only forced into action by Ives, only playing an elaborate charade to trick him into mating.
"What have they done to you, Harry?" He whispered, thinking of Dumbledore, Voldemort, all the choices Harry had been forced to make and had been so unprepared for. Of this kidnapper who was now pushing the Gryffindor in a corner once again.
Only a few seconds parted him from the running young man, some fifteen metres, nothing more! So close and Draco felt his heart beat faster with the exertion and the relief. Everything was going to be okay, if he could just reach Harry – they'd deal with everything else later, he and Blaise would deal with it…
Draco was not sure if he could stand to see those vibrant, spring-green eyes regard him in such a way, let alone touch the lithe body while the vitriolic pools of emerald glared daggers at him or were closed against tears of desperation and resignation that would nevertheless escape in bitter rivulets.
Blaise shrugged unperturbed. "But it generally saves especially human resources to use more sly tactics then a direct onset. 'He will be victorious, who prepared himself to strike at his unprepared enemy'(1)."
And neither could Harry be entirely sure that the Aurors would help him, what with the Vykélari laws prohibiting any interference; worse, he couldn't even rule out the possibility that they might be in on this blackmail as well, in which case Blaise's family might retaliate against either his friends or the Slytherins to punish Harry for even trying to denounce them.
But still, he shrugged with a for-your-sake expression and let the matter rest. Merlin, he was tired of fighting.
“A submissive.” Lucius answered, watching for the brief flash of surprise that he knew he would see in his son’s eyes and hiding his smugness as he did.
The very idea of not taking advantage of that fortunate happenstance was inconceivable. Of course it was wrong that the Gryffindor had ever been subjected to the spying potion, but Draco would use it to his advantage nonetheless. Besides, he rather thought Harry might forgive him if it helped safe his friends and keep him from having to mate with his blackmailer.
are." Blaise corrected, feeling much the same, except that it had been his anger clouding his judgement and if he thought closely now about how carelessly Harry was always risking his life … he simply couldn't be allowed to keep going like that. Even though Blaise knew that he had approached the subject positively maladroitly, it certainly would need further attention. The thought that Harry might end up dead or hurt because of his own thoughtlessness had his stomach in knots. It was unacceptable.
Draco might have attacked the man, if not physically, then at least verbally, were it not for Blaise coming to stand next to him at that very moment and grasping his shoulder. Insistently his fiancé turned him towards him, demanding his attention.
Draco and Blaise talk to their parents and Severus via a two-way-mirror connection, telling them of their decision to court Harry but also that they won't force him into it, to which Lucius, Amalyne and Narcissa agree. Severus tells the Malfoys and Zabinis of Harry's past with the Dursleys.
Useless to say: that ancestor had not been a Vykélari, their kind didn't care much for such a mortuary cult. Draco rather suspected that this specific painting's presence in Adler's room had something to do with how the deceased Malfoy had treated him when they had first talked through the mirror connection after Harry's transformation. Blaise could be unbelievably protective and vindictive at times…
He hadn't meant to pass judgement on his lover, not more so than on himself at least. It was only meant as a statement, a remark, a reason to change: just a goad, nothing more. And yet, it was the truth, wasn't it? Pansy, Theodore, Goyle and Crabbe and … and he, Blaise… and Draco.
“I was busy, Narcissa.” He said carefully, warily watching her wand release a spray of angrily green sparks. “I told you I would be.”
Of course that would neither hold Narcissa and Amalyne back, nor detain them significantly as they were keyed into the wards.
"Your magic is still bleeding out." Draco grumbled above him, the anger in his voice and expression oddly contrasting with the gentleness of his fingers as they moved to cup Harry's painfully tense neck.
“You are right, submissive ones did indeed have that ability. But the last active line became extinct over 200 years ago, only having brought forth female descendants.” It was a pity, really, that the Vykélari genes were Y-linked and therefore could only be given to a male. No daughter could inherit them and therefore become a Vykélari or even transmit the genes to the next generation. Both submissive and dominant Vykélari were therefore essentially male in appearance, even though the submissive ones were able to bear children themselves.
A path opened directly in front of them, not more than half a metre wide, revealing at its very end the towering statue of the enormous gargoyle, glaring at them from a tall, slender socle that was half overgrown with thorny twines and dark red blooms.
, wanted that supple body quivering from his touch alone and those expressive eyes to shine up at him, entranced by the wings he'd spread over them like a canopy of white feathers, and yet with that burning defiance that screamed that there was no one Harry Potter would yield to completely. As it should be.
Slowly, Taide's hand wandered from his stomach downwards, interrupting the painful thought and Harry tensed as it stroked over his hip and his thigh, to press down on his muscles, an insistent reminder of just where and with whom he was. And what he was supposed to do. But gods, if this perverted asshole thought that Harry would just roll over and let him do whatever he wanted, he had another thing coming!
Barely half an hour after Daphne had relented and agreed to help them, a large barn owl had been sent on its way to Severus Snape though they were yet to receive an answer from the former Professor, and the Greengrass heiress herself was speaking to headmistress McGonagall while Astoria, who had been summoned by a House Elf, was on her way to the Lupins and Weasleys with the usual efficiency that seemed to be an inherent Greengrass treit.
frightened him. He was in a foreign place with no one to trust but his own instincts and if they failed him now…
And the third wand maker, Oria Ragno, a wispy, elderly woman with grim lines around her narrow lips and even narrower eyes, refused to sell him even a practice wand, knowing that it would be illegal. It had been a heavy setback in Blaise's plans that the guardia had already alerted the wand-makers of his and Draco's ban of carrying any form of magical weapon.
Maybe that was the reason he loved to make Draco become human once in a while, too, when they were just with each other. And yesterday it seemed he had discovered just the perfect way to do that.
Slowly Harry's hand inched over his stomach, fingertips reaching forward, through dark curls and over sensitive skin and along the already half-hard length nestled there. Had Blaise touched Draco just like he had him? He wondered, while pressing a fingertip to the weeping slit on his erection. Probably not, the Italian had been so gentle with Harry, kissing him with insistent but also warm and soft lips, holding him close... Harry bit his lower lip, remembering with a cruel clarity those strong hands that had ghosted over his sides so softly, a touch barely felt at all, making his muscle's strain and stretch in wicked delight as if those finger tips set his flesh aflame wherever they touched him. A trail of burning desire.
"To relax you and appease your magic." Someone cooed at him as they held him still, forcing that same green and golden liquid down his throat that he had barely evaded earlier. "You will feel much better in just a moment!"
"Does it matter?" Draco spat, a little bit aggressively in his own protectiveness of his parents and ancestors. Of course it was deserved. But he had not come here for another reminder on his family's faults, this morning had already been enough in that regard, thank you very much. There were more important matters to attend to anyway, such as the invasive nature of the connection they had shared today. Furthermore, despite anything that Adler said or believed: family came first, Draco would have to stand behind them regardless of their crimes and mistakes. Of course he didn't expect Harry to become close to his mother, and much less his father, but maybe both parties could be persuaded to at least ignore each other. In any case he would deal with the problem once it became acute.
But they had to break away soon for lack of air and Blaise curled against him a bit more, leaning down to reach his neck and shoulder, sucking angry red marks onto his pale, easily bruising skin, varying his nibbles and bites from soft and tender to hard and ruthless and hurtful.
Then, slowly they eased down, almost floating, the rustle of their robes the only noise in the quiet night air, until they kneeled on the ground in that bloody pool of velvet, not once breaking each other's gaze. Each movement was given so much attention, and it all looked so awfully much like the preparation for some kind of ritual that Harry really, really didn't want to witness…
This time, though, Harry was better prepared and he would have huffed out a dryly amused snort at this attempt to intimidate him, had the graveness of his situation not been choking any spark of humour. Too often he had been the sole recipient of the penetrating, pale blue gaze of a man far greater, far wiser and far, far more powerful and perceptive. Eleuterio Lanai was nothing against one Albus Dumbledore, or even his portrait. Neither could he compare to the red, murderous eyes of Tom Riddle. And how he wanted to tell the bastard that! That he was a nothing, an insignificant insect amongst millions. But he doubted the man would believe anything but the favourable whispers of his own ego.
“McAuley!” Lucius interrupted the flood of words, his voice harsh and firm, and his eyes cold, hard and so utterly
Instantly Harry looked up with an incredulous expression; was there even a question? "Of course I would!"
"Why have you brought me here? And what the hell happened? Why do I have fucking wings and claws and I don't know what else? Why were you there? Huh? In that room, why were you there? And why the hell did you bloody bastards fucking kidnap me?"
“You know me.” Praying to whoever would listen that it was true, Draco curled in his claws to hide the faint tremors that shook them. A short outcry cut through the air but he didn’t dare to turn around. It had sounded like the high, squeaky voice of a House Elf and Alfar’s face flashed through his mind – they shouldn’t have taken the Elves along. By Merlin, they shouldn’t have. And Blaise… Draco fervently hoped his lover was okay, but he still didn’t dare to take his eyes away from the deadly beast in front of him.
The man huffed once in what might have been disbelief but he sobered up rather quickly, maybe too quickly. Up to now Valerio had taunted and humiliated him and treated him like a brainless child that he expected to obey and submit to each of his whims…
Soft fingers touched his shoulder, closing around it and making Harry turn to face Draco with his pale skin and intense eyes, the airflow playing with the blond fine hair as they kept on drawing their circles.
to do it and preserve their privacy whenever they needed it and that was enough. At least it would grant him some much needed time to get used to the overwhelming closeness; at least, it was one problem deferred if not solved.
Well, it wasn't that bad, Pansy guessed, she'd just find herself someone else. Preferably rich, mute and short-lived.
Ron could immediately see that he had hit a mark with that comment. He was starting to unsettle the both of them and predictably, Zabini came to his lover's, no his fiancé's defence, just as he had done in the hospital. "Harry forgave Draco, so it isn't for you to judge..."
"We will keep the connection open, should we have questions." Draco said, but privately he didn't think that they would take the portraits or their parents up on the offer. Harry was too unusual for them to be of much use and they didn't know anything about him.
He should be glad instead that there were 1500 kilometres between them or Blaise would make him sorry, for ever having spoken, having even thought those words...
"Why can't we leave you alone?" Draco finished in a soft murmur when Harry had fallen silent, his eyes resting on his former nemesis with an unreadable expression.
To add to his embarrassment, the Italian was not yet finished. "If they do, don't hesitate to speak up right away or to search us out.
And Harry had known about that, had tried to keep up the illusion of leaving out of his own volition for the benefit of an audience that they couldn't see… hence his fear of Draco and Blaise learning the truth about his friends, his fear of giving in and staying without being forced. It all made sense…
Granted, he and Draco didn't really know that much about submissives aside from the fact that they were very powerful and very desired. It had never been an issue after all as they had never expected to actually
Hopefully unaware of his line of thoughts, Harry interrupted them nonetheless as he spoke up, looking at him cautiously.
Hermione's voice fell silent and she looked up to her friend in the mirror excitedly but Harry didn't encounter her gaze, too shocked to really think of anything to say.
From the bottom of his heart, Harry had enjoyed that openness, that closeness, that feeling of being held and treasured … or something coming close to that at least.
Up and down, up and down, smoothly, steadily. And then he reduced his weight, wished himself to be lighter. He did that gradually until he knew that with much force, he would theoretically be able to get off the ground with several strong beats. But he wouldn't. He didn't have the strength anymore, because Blaise and Draco had been right and using muscles he had never used before was just so damn exhausting…
So why hadn't Potter's magic taken care of his injury? Severus pursed his lips and shifted closer, wondering whether there had perhaps been a trauma dire enough to render the boy unconscious. However, there seemed to be no bruising to his head, no abrasions and no blood… Internal bleeding then? But that should still have given the Vykélari's magic the few seconds it needed to act.
"Wonderful." Adler murmured softly and Harry had the uncomfortable feeling that this had nothing to do with his well-being.
Thank you drkbella and Wishfull_star, for your comments! And thanks everyone else for reading and for the kudos!
"We'll talk with Molly and Arthur first, of course, but we could go there. Though it will take me a few days, two at least to get the necessary portkeys."
! Draco would have come from the vibrations that moment if not for the tight ring of fingers still wrapped around the base of his cock.
Draco and Blaise come and take him to the gardens for lunch, telling him that he has become a submissive Vykélari and that his rights are practically nonexistent when it comes to Vykélari mating. When Harry deduces that they took him from the hospital to mate him, he demands to be taken back to London and tries to leave in a fit of rage after being denied, Blaise orders the House Elves to not let him come near the Manor's wards or get access to a wand.
"I'll do that, thanks a lot..." Ron sneered, while moving a bit away from his house. It was better if they remained undisturbed and unobserved during the next few minutes. The last Ron needed, was for his mother to storm in and keep him from getting any useful information out of the two Slytherins. Molly had always been a bit impulsive when it came to the safety and wellbeing of those she considered to be family. "Where is Harry?"
His frail body slithered over the stones and came to lie in a heap in front of the veiled mirror, the fierce wind still tearing at his clothes and white hair and the equally white curtain behind him.
Next to him Draco cocked his head, cold amusement rolling off him in palpable waves and Blaise folded his hands in front of him, preparing himself for what could only become a very entertaining speech.
Shocked silence reigned in the garden for a few, endless seconds while the powerful currents within Harry rose in defence of their owner, flaring and blazing, a fiery tornado birthed from a firestorm raging out of control, frightening and deadly. The fury streaming through his body felt like its own living entity within him, detached from his logic and his mind, but not less real for it, not less powerful and it was all he could do to keep it contained, to not let his magic rip out of his chest.
The doors themselves lead to rooms that could only exist due to the clever usage of wizarding space: a kitchen and ever-full pantry, two bathrooms, several bedrooms… Severus knew what hid behind each of them even though they were currently closed, as he had been given the full tour not so long a time ago.
“Sshh, that’s it, Potter. We won’t hurt you.” The man whispered against his ear and involuntarily, Harry felt his muscles relax. Unbidden words rushed through his mind, telling him that Malfoy and the other could not be the same ones who had caused him so much pain earlier, they had come afterwards, they had freed him and whatever they had done, they had given him back his hearing. He needn’t fear them, needn’t fight them. They would help him.
Immediately Draco froze and his cold grey eyes narrowed at him dangerously, telling him that his beloved fiancé was aware of what exactly he wished to do; which was not surprising, they had after all spoken about it not even an hour ago with Adler when they had recounted to him all that had happened between them and the delicious submissive from the moment they had entered that hospital room. Blaise had, with the smile and the quiet thrill of a hunting panther, mentioned how intimate an experience it had been to have Harry's magic rush through his body, how unsettling and in hindsight utterly
But the voices now reached his ears clearly and Harry could definitely make out Draco's growl from across the room. "Come out! Now!"
"This is so clever, Harry. She didn't even come here to interview anyone, knowing that we would become liable to prosecution if we even admitted that you were a submissive Vykélari. The Mediwizard she interviewed remained anonymous and I doubt that his colleagues would rat him out, not after the way this article will influence the public. And that historian does not really know if you are a Vykélari or not, her information is given only hypothetically and on hearsay. So the only one that Crane woman endangered is herself and after making you the tragic hero, the public would become a lynch mob if Lucius Malfoy tried to turn her in. As it is, I don't think he'll be acquitted in his trial after all. His reputation won't recover in time and now every pair of eyes will be directed towards the Wizengamot. They just cannot afford to let him off easily now... this changes everything, Harry!"
Maybe, he reflected with a humourless snort, that was why he had felt the unquenchable thirst to put the boy down even after he had seen those memories, because he, Severus Snape, had not managed to bounce back and continue as if nothing had happened after his own abuse. How could it be that Potter remained unmarred and bright and ignorant of the world's true black and bleak countenance whatever fate dealt him when Snape himself had been scarred by it even before he had reached that special age of eleven?
Four wizards and two witches stood close to the tall beasts, calming hands stroking and petting at their sides, keeping them steady and the obviously wild temperaments in check. It didn't completely work as the animals kept fluttering slightly, sweeping away a bit of the gravel covering the driveway so neatly and swirling up dust from the overly dry ground.
The man clicked his tongue disapprovingly as if offended by Harry's discourtesy, even while he tilted his head and let his appreciative, hooded gaze wander over every expanse of naked skin visible over the waistband of Harry's pyjama bottoms, making him feel uncomfortably exposed and cold despite the warm night air. He could feel his skin crawling with the need to cover up and his fingers curling at his side with the distaste of being stared at like a beautiful piece of jewellery in a shop window, but he refused to cow and fold his arms around himself in a vague attempt to hide his state of undress, straightening his posture defiantly instead.
"Here, Harry." The blond murmured softly, the voice caressing like his fingers were not. "Don't think about the process, your magic has memorized it. Think only of the end result."
Pretending to yield, the blonde let go of his darker fiancé, relaxing into his kiss, into his arms, waiting until the lips upon his gentled and moved with more finesse, nipping and suckling at his lower lip to get him to open, both his mouth and himself, to the sensual onslaught.
“Because I want you to admit it to my face!” She said heatedly, her eyes sparkling aggressively, her nails clawing into the metallic surface of the table.
Perhaps half an hour and the softest orange glow would bleed into the blue, giving rise to a transformation like the birth of an entirely new world: oppressive and hostile shadows would turn into harmless wood and bark, the sounds of nameless enemies moving in the darkness revealing themselves to be nothing more than wind and animals prowling through the scrub and boughs. Blades of grass and millions of leaves and wild flowers would shed the dull greyness clinging to them like tar and burst into colours and the soft smells of moss and wood and leaves and earths would thicken in the soon warming air.
With a calming breath, Harry swallowed all his objections and followed Malfoy's pale figure into the water. But he couldn't brush off the feeling of being pushed into a corner; vaguely he wondered if he shouldn't have managed to get used to that by now, and yet…
“Now let us have that imbecile of a healer clear the hallway of Weasels and take Potter back to the manor. I really don’t fancy explaining to them why and where we are taking their saviour.”
Startled, Harry glanced towards the man, still standing there so regally in his dark, silk-embroidered robe. It took him a few moments to even process the words, let alone remember what question it was he was supposed to answer. The knowledge that he couldn't do anything to prevent them from forcing this potion on him, the spark of fear it exuded, like a seed of darkness, still stole the stableness out of his thoughts and he had to hold on to them with much effort just to attempt to put the flighty shreds of reason back together. It didn't make it any easier that he had been awake now for twenty hours. Or that his magic rumbled inside his chest like a furious beast, snarling and hissing and clawing at his concentration, making him want to bare his teeth and attack.
Furious, Harry leaves and stumbles over a fireplace with an open floo connection. He tries to escape but is stunned by a House Elf, sent after him by Blaise and Draco who saw his flight attempt through the windows.
Slowly, carefully the dominant's agate eyes blinked open and Harry unwillingly held his breath, only for his stomach to drop as he caught sight of the stony coldness and wariness within. He swallowed the bitter disappointment that wanted to rise in his throat, his chest tightening as if a giant screw clamp was about to shatter his sternum.
. But he couldn't help wondering what Lucius Malfoy would say, should he learn about how his role model son caved under a single look of affection and support.
Harry looked over his shoulder at the other young man, still a teenager like himself, but matured before his time. Draco had his wand firmly in his hand, rolling it between his slender fingers. The thought that this very hawthorn wand had been directed at him numerous times in ill intent did not even cross his mind, only the surety that it – hawthorn and unicorn hair – and its master would not let him fall. He smiled, but also raised an eyebrow at the doubt in his flying abilities that Draco was portraying. Again. One would think Slytherins should have a steeper learning curve.
It was therefore understandable that Harry was all too relieved to follow Blaise and Draco out of the study and together they made their way to the Manor's forefront. The sight that greeted them there immediately erased the uncomfortable conversation from Harry’s mind without a trace.
It was a logical explanation, one he could hold on to. Now he only needed to endure whatever the next hours held for him; only three and a half hours, Malfoy had said. Nothing he couldn’t take and then he would go back to the Weasleys and together with Ron and Hermione he would learn to live with whatever this so-called inheritance might entail.
First he had tried contacting the three families that were currently engaged in the business of wand making in Italy – via the floo, since he had no mirror connections established with them – fairly confident that his and Draco's joined fortunes would open them the doors they needed to be unlocked. But all it had brought him were hurting knees and grey and white ash stains on his hastily donned, dark dress robes.
The disappointment was keen and sharp in his chest and it almost felt like a small betrayal, as illogical as that was.
"Draco!" Blaise called out, appalled, and with a few quick steps he was in front of his lover, clasping his arms to steady him and to be able to look at him properly. He was a sight to behold and Blaise felt his stomach drop as he took in the rumpled hair that appeared as if Draco had pulled at it viciously, the bloodless skin, paler as any vampire's. His eyes were… troubled was too weak a word. Not haunted, not horrified, or not only… determined, yes, determined and … hurt, glistening suspiciously.
Everything fell into place then, snippets of long forgotten conversations and texts he had read at some point or another assembling to form a whole, like the pieces of a puzzle once their frame was complete and their layout known.
Yet for all that he loved them, Taide still couldn’t break his silence that was so deeply rooted in the understanding that they deserved everything that Harry’s magic had in store for them. All of them.
"You know, I don't think he is someone even capable of gloating; more than likely he was just trying his usual saviour-routine or trying to get you to like him like the rest of the world. Probably his next grand endeavour now that he has no Dark Lord to kill."
There was no doubt in him that it wasn't by his own free will that Harry was leaving: damn, only fifteen minutes ago the Gryffindor had kissed him with all that he was, passionately, insistently…
"It's not working." Harry said, bewildered, absentmindedly wiping one of his sweat-slick hands on his pants. "My wings won't come out…"
Harry wailed and screamed, convulsing around the dagger deeply imbedded in him, feeling his magic trickle softly into the cold metal, but the physical pain and loss were insignificant, paling in comparison to the other loss he was experiencing at this very moment and he couldn't care less that he was haemorrhaging, both blood and magic streaming out of his body.
to present that submissive to the media come morning, healthy and unmated, or he'd be torn to shreds too small to even feed to the chimera guarding the secret government archives eight storeys below...
Draco merely raised an eyebrow, showing more composure this time as he decided not to react to his ancestor's teasing. He was starting to think that maybe, this was Adler's shrewd kind of humour, or his way of testing him, and that their cooperative work might be more productive if he ignored his biting remarks. At least it could prove to be a worthwhile experiment, he thought with a semi-detached scientific interest, as he fixed the portrait with a nondescript gaze.
His efforts were in vain, though, as Harry was in no way ready to see the sincerity behind it, anger and more importantly fear clouding his judgement. Even the first time when the Moody imposter had imperiused him, Harry had been able to somewhat fight against the mind-control. But this... this would leave him helpless and meek and pliable, fresh modelling clay for the dominant to form himself the perfect, obedient submissive; he might be unable to defend himself or refuse any of his controller's orders and instead cheer him on in utter bliss all the way into absolute mind slavery.
He never wanted to see that kind of horror and guilt in their eyes, and surely those feelings would be there, dark shadows cast on the brightness of that burning flame and strength that made them unique.
Behind him, Draco spread his pale feathered, downy wings in such a way that they seemed to frame Harry's own, smaller but sharper ones in hat huge mirror. It made quite a striking combination, Harry had to admit, that silver grey, almost white and that intense green. They could have been Slytherin colours, but the nuances were not quite right: too pale, too luminous and too varied; so Harry could endure the fleeting comparison without too much annoyance, even without a frown.
Harry blinked in surprise, first at the unexpected intervention, then at the use of that title and his stomach dropped, the little hints and facts merging with dizzying swiftness into the harsh certainty that this was his intended mate and the knowledge drove itself mercilessly into his mind like a long nail, however much Harry had tried to avoid even thinking of the man they wanted him to share his magic with. And his body. Gods, Harry didn't know which was worse.
Malfoy Manor was currently the place of another, not necessarily less important, though certainly less dramatic, event: the engagement party of Draco Lucius Malfoy and Blaise Alain Zabini.
Even Marcus Malfoy and the other Vykélari portraits stared at them in silence and Severus couldn't help but wonder if they were more taken aback by the patriarch's behaviour or Draco's disobedience.
Hissing at a particularly vicious bite, Blaise let his head fall back against the wall and clenched his eyes shut, both from his lover's cruel teeth and hot lips pursuing the pulse beat at his throat and the kiss that he remembered all too well.
For a terrible moment that he would hate himself later for, Harry was enchanted by that possibility, but it was something that he had been yearning for so desperately for such a long time, who could anyone fault him for wanting it, whatever the cost: sweet and peaceful and everlasting safety?
"I'm sorry that your transformation went like that. It's … meant to be a joyous event. My parents were so proud when I did, I … I think they were not sure I would be powerful enough." Draco murmured, his guilt pushing him towards honesty. He hadn't thought about what that experience might have done to the submissive, not for a moment. He had just expected Harry to pick himself up and go on, like he always did, had expected him to fight them and with time, to give in to them.
Harry shrugged, scrunching the garment in his hand to a ball. "Sweater, T-shirt. I was cold that evening, it had pelted in the afternoon."
Severus shook his head ever so slightly, aware of how quickly the situation was unravelling, but not quite sure how to stop it.
Gods, how he wished Blaise would straddle him and lower himself onto his aching need and just fuck himself hard and deep and fast. Or stop teasing and end his torment in another way…
Of course that didn't excuse his behaviour, but in time Draco would understand and forgive his father, even if Narcissa had to mediate between her family for a while.
To ensure that no illicit use of other charms took place, the game was played with specialised fake wands that were only able to produce the type of charm the players were allowed to perform – a good precaution in Harry's opinion since he knew his Slytherins, and the team of the younger Battellis didn't seem above using dirty tricks either. Besides, he still didn't have his own wand and the missing presence of his holly and phoenix feather wand was a constant nagging in the back of his mind.
Now, with the prospect of having the younger Vykélari as a mate, a real mate, and with Severus's words still haunting him, he couldn't do it. There was no logical explanation, nothing that would have sounded reasonable to him anyway and yet ... he just couldn't.
Immediately after Voldemort’s fall on the 2nd of May there had been a torrent of prosecutions and arrests. With their lord’s demise, the once-steely determination of his followers had collapsed like a tumbler. In the desperate attempt to spare themselves years of imprisonment, and worse, many tried to sell whatever information they could to the Aurors, whom, in turn, were so hopelessly understaffed that Ministry employees of other departments who were not already working to capacity were deployed with the duty of filing and evaluating that information.
But now the article really became interesting. Crane undeniably used the Mediwizard's statement to affiliate Harry's plight to the ruthlessness and power of purebloods. 'Purebloods can't keep on trampling over the rights of everyone else just because their families forged the laws and political structures our society is build up on now to their advantage.' She wrote there.
The empty bottles were flung aside carelessly, clinging loudly as they hit the ground and rolled away and Severus immediately turned towards the wound in Potter's abdomen. The cleanly cut edges were raised just a little bit, the skin around them smeared red from blood.
He also couldn't have tortured his friends and so logic dictated that there had to be another wizard whom Harry couldn't see within the mirror's frame. And an invisible threat was hard to fight.
For a moment Harry wondered if he should tell the git to take his hands off his body, but after a moment's contemplation that didn't seem worth the effort it would take him to form the words. And it started to feel … better: Harry had no idea what the two Slytherins were doing but gradually the overheated feeling of his skin receded until the aching of his muscles was at least bearable and the nausea a mere echo. A relieved sigh escaped his lips and he closed his eyes again, enjoying the remission of his pain.
"It won't come to that. If you don't want to mate, you don't have to, you will always find a safe spot in Lanai Manor." Reassuringly the tanned Italian laid one of his hands on Harry's knee and squeezed gently.
, for her unending support, her input, friendship, and for looking over my insane ramblings and correcting the worst of my mistakes!
And well, since he didn't have to fight this dominant for their submissive and said submissive was neither here nor willing to help him release all the pent-up tension, he'd need another way.
"If they indeed used such a leech dagger I assume Potter would have been in no condition to leave on his own. They must have sent him away, and they wouldn't have done so if he was dead." Generale Carraci reasoned. "For now I would operate under the assumption that he
Together they had gone to a hill not far from the manor and covered the whole area with warming charms before they had proceeded to prepare a Samhain bonfire that they wanted to lit at midnight, one as large as they could. Instead of the overused and clichéd jack-o'-lanterns made of carved pumpkins, they had lit black candles and charmed them to fly into the air surrounding the fire, meant to invite the spirits of their ancestors and those who had died during the last year, while keeping away hostile ghosts and spirits. The atmosphere was festive and solemn and nostalgic and exuberant all at the same time, varying from one moment to the next and Draco was glad not to be alone that night.
Nonetheless: if he went into a plummet from this height and passed the wards with such a velocity, then surely no House Elf would be able to react in time. He remembered that the fastest bird could dive … well, okay he didn't really remember how fast, but it was very fast, too quick a target for a House Elf to possibly hit with a stunner. That meant he wasn't necessarily dependant on Ives Malfoy's goodwill… when the time came for him to leave, he would be able to do so. But that time was not now and with how happy he felt at that very moment, Harry thought that that time could gladly stay in the far future where it belonged.
And that thought almost made his magic break out of his control, spreading into his muscles and mind, embedding itself in every fibre, urging and pushing to force him to search for the two dominants that might save him, but not his friends. The need, the overwhelming desire, was there but Harry could recognize the source now, could understand that the two Slytherins would not let him leave and do what he had to. He pushed it down, strangled it ruthlessly and wrapped it into more steely determination. No amount of wailing and lamenting would change anything.
"Yes. In a manner of speaking." Draco agreed over the rushing wind and Harry gave a strangled groan, partly because it seemed like an answer to his thoughts, but he nodded nonetheless, because, well, had he ever shied away from something that held the promise of dangerous exhilaration and extreme daring that bordered on stupidity?
Ives nodded calmly, as if he had expected that answer. "Then I will offer you a deal. You will give my descendant and his fiancé the benefit of the doubt and an honest chance to court you. And you, in turn, will allow them to teach you about the ways of Vykélari with an open mind. In exchange, I will tell you how to leave them for good on the 31st of August this year, one day before the new school term starts. I hear Hogwarts will be reopened by then and allow for all those who weren't able to continue their education during the war to return for an eight year. In Hogwarts you will be a lot safer than anywhere else aside from a dominant Vykélari's home."
They had swum out rather far, even leaving the bight itself and Draco had casted a rather useful charm on Harry's eyes that erected an invisible barrier in front of them to keep the salt water away and reminded Harry of swim goggles, just without the bothering pressure sores and with a much larger field of vision. Another bubble soon encompassed his nose and mouth; it would always be filled with fresh air, as Draco assured him, and would enable him to breathe underwater. It was also less confusing than a complete bubble-head charm since it wouldn't distort the view underwater due to the moving and irregular surface of the bubble.
of the family, I demand your respect in turn or I will have all your portraits delivered to a windowless safe-house with no possibility of visiting other places or any other paintings that do not hold your person." And that would include any portrait of Ives' also, leaving the two lovers separated while the ban lasted and Adler unable to commune with anyone but copies of himself. It was a harsh threat, but Draco hoped it might at least shift the so far unequal balance of power in their relationship towards himself and remind Adler of his allegiance. If the move cost him Adler's advice and Ives' support, then so be it; in contrast to his parents, Draco was not willing to endlessly pamper the portraits' ego just to keep them happy and complacent.
Harry calmed a little bit at the shocked expressions he encountered. He had let himself be carried away for a moment, he knew it, and yet…
The circular drive was covered with pale gravel that glowed in the early midmorning sun and lead away from the manor as a white ribbon flowing over the green park that was much more orderly than the garden behind the manor with its neat, geometric flower beds and artfully cut hedges.
The next days will show if the minister is going to account for the debts of his institution and our society towards a 17 years old boy we forced into the role of saviour.
And sometimes, he thought it might have been easier to bear if Harry had forgiven him because Ron was his best friend. But Harry had also forgiven Draco Malfoy even though he had almost killed Katie and Ron and Dumbledore, even though he had let Death Eaters into the school, tried to hand Harry over and bullied them for years. Harry just forgave.
"Don't worry, Harry," Blaise started in a tone of voice that he hoped would calm the brunet's conscience. After all, it was probably Ives' fault and not Harry's. "It's…"
But more importantly: they were alone on this platform and aside from a single waiter no one intruded on their privacy, which calmed Harry considerably.
Something inside of him flinched and ruptured and bled out at the sight of his best friends reduced to broken, shivering heaps of fear: pain and horror at this nightmare leaking out of him in rivulets, freezing over quickly with cold-blooded fury and determination so strong and clear and destructive like ice crystals forming in the water that unobtrusively permeated porous rocks until they burst it apart, while his reality narrowed itself down to the task set before him.
"I knew you of all people wouldn't let yourself be held back by memories." He whispered into the younger Gryffindor's ear, staring at the submissive's reflection in something akin to warm pride, but Harry could hear the smug  smile in his voice.
"Nothing… It's just, you know, it was … really painful…" he shrugged, dropping his gaze along with his voice.
But he hadn't even wanted to think about his would-be mate, still didn't in a way. He didn't want to be able to put a face to a man willing to commit such atrocities, but more than that, Harry didn't want to see the man he would have to kill if he couldn't prevent all this from happening.
In hindsight the letter had been a rash decision, one that he came to regret now that he had been caught (not that he would ever admit it to Draco and Blaise); but how could he have known that the letter would prove to be redundant because they would consent so readily to a meeting with his friends?
Draco meanwhile waited, his fingers drumming away impatiently on his crossed legs. It seemed that even if he would get Adler's cooperation more freely now, they still weren't past games. He sighed martyred. "So will you grant me said advice?"
At their feet the foolish thing blinked his eyes open, those eyes that without the hideous glasses were of a stunning, almost unnatural green, that seemed even more so due to the mask of pale ultraviolet and the dark green lines that framed them. Harry shook his head once as if to clear it before he took in his surroundings with one quick glance around the room and then glared at the two Slytherins above him with a truly venomous expression.
The brunette sat back on her chair with a heavy sigh, obviously unhappy about the request. But Harry was confident that she would give in, because ultimately Hermione was also of the opinion that it was cowardly to allow others to be hurt, just because it made one's own life easier.
"Harry would never play along with such a charade." Draco said as calmly as he could, still trying to reason with their parents, when, in Blaise's opinion, they were obviously beyond all reason.
Or partly at least. Harry was neither naïve, conceited nor self-destructive enough to claim the lion's share of the responsibility for this disaster. Not when there was the man next to him handily present to blame and who commanded his attention, holding his elbow firmly enough to make it clear that he didn't wish the submissive to break loose but not so firm as to risk raising suspicion from the Aurors.
For the first time since this all began, Draco focused all of his attention on the two forms cowering almost pathetically there on the floor of this weird, flying muggle vehicle. It probably shouldn't be, but the sight was like barbed wire entangling itself into the coils of his guts. Of course witnessing torture always made him sick to the stomach, ever since he had experienced for himself that it rarely ended in something other than death and these were Harry's friends; for his sake at least he didn't want them hurt or dead.
Not that flying upwind had helped him any, considering his pitiful appearance, and now he would depend on the help of someone experienced in weathering out storms to get him out.
Without hesitation, Harry glanced up into stormy grey eyes and briefly he had to wonder if Draco really had found their connection that intolerable, surely he wouldn't willingly get so close to him now if that had been the case? Maybe it was just that overly pragmatic side he could from time to time exhibit: after completing the transformation and having showed Harry just what he and Blaise had intended to, after alleviating his apprehensions, maybe he had just not seen any use in maintaining the bond?
"I would… You should know that if it had been possible at all, Blaise and I would not have brought you here against your will."
"I don't think this is any of your business." Blaise said, his chin raised haughtily, taking a somewhat twisted pleasure in the fact that they would be allowed into Potter's hospital room while his friends obviously were not and were probably not even informed about anything going on, either. After all they were not related to their wonder-boy.
Only that Blaise knew that it wasn't a fair comparison: Draco had had his parents to think of and he had known that he and the name of his once illustrious family would have lost any social standing they might still possess, any influence, forever pushed out of the limelight and right off the stage of politics and life and disregarded from then on, had he not joined a side in the war.
And looking downward, Harry could think of a million reasons (given or taken a few) why this was an honest to god bad idea.
"We have both seen you fight, Harry. Anyone who can handle himself on a battlefield with such grace is also able to dance just as well." And while Blaise spoke those words, Draco stood and rounded their table with sure steps, resting his hands onto the backrest of Harry’s chair, indicating for him to stand.
"In any way: " another portrait said calmly, completely ignoring the petty bickering around him "a submissive is worth whatever trouble he might cause during courting. Especially some." his eyes gleamed within the painting with an intelligent sparkle, attester to his ruthlessly calculative persona. He was a tall, formidable looking young man in his dark, unpretentious dress robe that was adorned only with silver edging; his platinum blond hair, a trademark of his family, flowed down his shoulders in rich waves. His appearance and bearings made him stand out amongst his family, for despite his obvious youth - he could not be older than twenty-five in this picture - he seemed quieter and calmer and lacked the often displayed haughtiness. He was obviously self-confident, but enough so that he didn't have to assure his environment of that fact constantly.
Immediately the portkey was triggered by Harry’s grave condition, and he vanished into a whirl of colours.
Even if someone else had acquired a portkey, they could only have done so by force. And why would any sane wizard want to steal a portkey to the middle of nowhere?
Though evidently, Harry's discomfort didn't keep him from speaking out in the end, in a hesitant, awkward mumble.
Her hands were trembling, her eyes held a wildness and desperation that Amalyne herself had never seen there before and yet she was still insufferably sophisticated and composed, far too stiff and … by Medea, Amalyne couldn't help the sliver of hate that took root in her chest at this very moment, even though Narcissa had never done her any kind of wrong, had been a dear friend for a very long while… even so she had to hate her because… because it might just be the Malfoy's fault that this had happened at all and it might just be Draco that had been portkeyed to safety and not her own son.
But why, then, had the red-haired submissive run Draco's family down like that? And what exactly had he managed to persuade Harry with?
How he wished he could dare to look at them now, reassure them that all would be well, that he'd take care of everything and not feel that horrible tinge of maddening uncertainty; but he didn't know if he would be lying and then there was that guilty knowledge that Ron would rather die than have Harry knowingly walk into a trap that might very well cost him his freedom. Hermione as well.
Each chariot was large enough for three, maybe even four grown man if they stood closely together and from the look of it, they were not meant to stay on the ground for long: three, pearly white horses were harnessed to the chariots, one to each vehicle, occasionally rearing their proud heads, sending the white, thick strands of hair flying in the soft breeze.
"Focus on your magic. It might be wilful but you are its master. Force it to accept your mate!" They ordered him, when Taide's magical advances dripped off his skin like droplets of water from a waxen surface.
They were mad! Utterly insane! He was no submissive whatever that meant, he couldn't be. And why the hell would other males try to mate with him anyway? Especially purebloods? There was no better way to end a bloodline than to marry someone who was unable to bear children. It didn't make sense that they would, and even if they were: he had escaped Voldemort's supporters, he would always escape.
"Well, to put it in a nutshell, no, you haven't." Ron said but Hermione leaned forwards even more, her eyebrows practically invisible beneath her bushy hair.
"I've kissed him." Blaise had said out of the blue, totally straight up and soberly, in answer to the unvoiced question in Draco's gaze, while he followed the other's movements with unblinking, desiring eyes. That pale, well-sculptured body that he had come to know so well and intimately.
Suddenly the stag reared up, beating with its front hooves into the air in a feigned attack as if it wanted Draco to know he would be trampled into a bloody pulp if he came any closer. Draco flinched, taken aback by how truly huge the beast was at just this moment. Only barely he kept himself from falling as he took an involuntary step away. But he couldn’t run now, instinctively he knew that running would be a fatal error at this point, for him, for all of them, and he forced himself to resist, even when the stag smashed its large hooves against the ground with a sound like thunder.
The realisation of what the luminous apparition was, what it meant, hit Blaise like a sledgehammer: he knew the shape of these hills and what should be standing there, at the exact same position where that burning block lit up the night, a fiery socket over-towered by a tornado of pure fire…
So, in a merry round of spite, sarcasm and alcohol-dampened smartness they had celebrated Samhain together; not the disgraceful Halloween rubbish they would be doing at Hogwarts, at least those who had returned there after the war. No, Samhain should be more than feasting and partying. It was the very first of the Wiccan Sabbaths, the death festival marking the descent of Winter and the date of the Celtic New Year.
was wrong with Harry at the moment. But this went further than the trauma he’d gone through. This was… unnatural. Wrong. And it scared him, because Harry
He breathed, concentrated on that, and slowly the flood of memories abated, gentled. He remembered soothing magic, calming touches, cool explanations, even if two Slytherins had been the bearers. But that didn't matter so much as the fact that his transformation was over and that he was able to see and feel and listen again.
"You'll love it!" Draco assured him. "It is full of tropical plants that offer so much to see for a Vykélari's eyes."
"What was it you said to Harry? 'I think not'." And just like that, the tanned Italian followed the line of hair over the rippled, quivering muscles of Draco's abdomen, ever downwards to where his prize awaited him, nestled between blond locks.
"I am very sorry – for Mr Potter and for you – and I hope this will not poison our relationship, but I cannot help you."
"Oh, I wouldn't, Harry. Aside from the fact that it would be political suicide if I tried to slander you, I sort of start to like you." Draco said, from under lowered lashes.
But really, did Malfoy honestly argue with a portrait over interior design and fashion sense having the same meaning for a painting?
Harry drew an unsteady breath. If only his mind wouldn't always jump to the most daring, most brazen solutions at hand…
That he was using it nonetheless would tell Blaise more efficiently just what the situation had deteriorated to than any other explanation ever could. Sure enough, Draco felt his lover's chest stop moving and his hand froze against his skin for a moment before it resumed to rub slowly over his back as if the Italian had needed to remind his body forcefully to continue working.
Oh yes, and this bastard had the guts to ask how he was when he had been the one to do all this to Harry…
But this! The Lanais were not even enemies of their families! They were related to the Zabinis, the head of the family was Blaise's uncle for heaven's sake! Why would they out of everyone do this to them? And why were the guardia involved? The laws were not so different from the ones in England after all. Whatever had happened, the guardia should not have interfered!
"Father..." Draco tried to stop Lucius' ranting, but to no avail and Blaise stepped closer to him, aghast of what was being asked of them, both from Lucius and all the promises they had made to Harry ... and to Ronald Weasley little more than half an hour ago.
"We'll have a late noon meal in the garden." Zabini said as he stepped past Harry towards the large window he had been looking out from. Then he turned suddenly, his eyes glinting as they travelled from the thin pyjama bottoms that the Gryffindor wore to his bare chest. For a short moment he locked eyes with Malfoy, and then he smirked back at Harry.
Involuntarily Harry's gaze flickered to their linked hands; Blaise's skin felt warm and smooth against his own, not calloused by brooms and months in the wild like his own were and the magic flowing into Harry's body where they touched tingled a little bit but also soothed his frazzled nerves and tense muscles. He remembered those touches from St. Mungo's, how nice they had felt, how he had calmed and instinctively known that he was safe. Had that been a natural reaction, just the way you would calm if a friend squeezed your shoulder comfortingly, or had it been his own magic or Blaise's tampering with his mind? He didn't know, but if it was the latter ... Harry couldn't accept it. Even if it didn't cause him to lose himself in feelings that were not his own, it would be a weakness he couldn't afford, might cause him to overlook important details in a potentially precarious situation or react too late to a threat.
The one thing that had gained him a home, a family, friends; that had protected him from his would-be murderers … it was gone. His magic was not there any longer!
Draco tightened his grasp on Harry's elbow, letting his magic seep into the unnaturally cold skin beneath his fingers to ease what discomfort he might be causing the submissive, and of course, hopefully also gentling the emotions wreaking havoc within.
"Morning." He murmured in turn, his brow still creased as he regarded the blonde, trying to make sense of the mixed signals he was getting. It seemed odd that the two Slytherins should be so eager and yet so reluctant at the same time. "Soo … who is it?"
Preposterous, Narcissa huffed affronted and raised her chin, glaring at the dark witch. Of course she wouldn't leave her boy to face all this on his own. And Blaise. What the two of them must have gone through, betrayed by their family, having to go against such powerful wizards. They were children still, for god's sake, and now they would need their parents'assistance with all their legal trouble if nothing else.
Merlin, that would be disastrous; his father's perpetrations in that matter were as grave as can be: the spying potions used on the three Aurors working on their cases, and the potions intended to make them sympathize with their family, bribery, threats... and damn it, while Draco and his mother had had no part in it, they were at the very least confidants to the Malfoy patriarch's misdeeds.
Slowly he fought himself through the heavy grogginess that had filled him so completely, allowing him to think clearer and to recognize the way his feelings and thoughts had been tampered with just a moment ago. Anger rose in him; he
Only one false answer to any of these questions might shatter it all. And that made him feel uncomfortably vulnerable.
So he watched and listened as Narcissa, having come to stand next to her raging husband, effectively calmed him with a few well-chosen words, explaining to him her plan to trap Harry Potter without Draco and Blaise ever learning of it and his resolve hardened.
They were wiry and tall, surely a head taller than he had last seen them, truly towering over the procession of guards leading them through the lavish foyer of the guardia headquarters with stony faces. The mighty wings spreading out from their backs were black, none of the rich copper or white-gold remaining behind and the feathers slid soundlessly against each other like those of owls even though their edges were sharp and deadly looking.
A fine son-in-law, and an even finer son (in his opinion). If anyone should get the power-boost of mating a submissive, it was them. Alas, if he wasn’t happily married himself… but then he remembered that the submissive in question
son, Lucius:" ever so gently Narcissa took her husband's chin between her fingers and turned his head around to capture the intense grey of his eyes. A smile played around her lips as if indecisive about coming forward or not.
Of course. The Vykélari council was, like the British Wizengamot, an organ of the legislature and while it could execute its laws by itself, it could also request the support of the guardia. Blaise knew that this was very similar to the system in their own country: if someone infringed on Vykélari laws, Lucius had the right to pronounce a sentence and demand that the Aurors arrest the perpetrator.
idea on that spying potion, Sir." Severus granted with a small hand-wave. "And I did. I dare say it is a rather beautiful thing, and very helpful in keeping your descendants out of trouble."
In this case, the long hall harboured the remnants of the furnishings that Blaise's father had bequeathed his only son with along with Lanai manor, reminders of a man that Blaise had never known, a man that had given him life and had been killed by his own mother, something that Draco's fiancé fervently didn't want to be reminded of. And so he had locked away all those chairs and tables, cabinets and showcases, the décor and carpets and everything else, had it brought to this store room and hidden away beneath white linen sheets never to be touched by daylight again, creating a hall of ghosts. Haunting ghosts of a man that Blaise secretly wished to have known, guiltily so, because the desire was a direct accusation of the only family that was close to him: his mother, the black widow.
Gently, Draco bit down on the muscles and flesh at the juncture of Blaise's neck and shoulder as a last warning to stay in place before he moved back a bit and released his lover's arm, to unzip his own trousers and push down his briefs just enough to free his own engorged, swollen flesh, a low moan escaping his lips as the pressure from the unforgiving fabric eased.
Blaise's gaze darted to Granger and Weasley whose postures had straightened, their expressions those of experienced soldiers told that they were the last line of defence, not allowed to retreat however powerful their enemy would prove to be. Well, at least they could commend them for their loyalty even if the situation called for more subtlety than that.
A thumb caressed his cheek softly; just another level of closeness during their temporary connection, and Blaise himself tilted his head ever so slightly as if leaning into an invisible touch, feeling the echo of his own hand against Harry's skin. "I really don't." He said again and raised his fingers higher to smooth away the frown on Harry's forehead.
So engrossed was he in his thoughts that Harry jumped in alarm as he heard his name being called softly and with a pounding heart he looked around the room, the many candles luckily producing more than enough light to search for an intruder. But there was none.
In Harry's humble opinion, putting six experienced players against three with a lot less practice, one of them never having even played before, might have been just a bit unfair.
"Do you think they will go easier on you just because the man you forced their hero to marry happens to be your son?"
Well, and thus it happened that Harry met Adler Malfoy, on whom he still hadn't been able to form a concrete opinion when Draco and Blaise came to fetch him fifteen minutes later. The man was just too ambiguous.
"Oh, please, Pansy!" Draco said through his grin. "This doesn't become more believable the more often you say it, you know? Only more ridiculous."
Well, at least it seemed that he had been given some reprieve. Blaise and Draco seemed intent on postponing all decisions until after the two of them had talked in private. Maybe it was a good sign that they (vainly) tried to keep him unaware of the problem and that they wanted to continue with the lesson instead of excusing themselves directly to discuss their next steps. As long as they covered it up, they would not take immediate action.
During Blaise's musings, Draco seemed to have reached a decision of his own. One that contented him very much from the look of it.
And just like Draco had done that day, which seemed to be a lifetime away now, Blaise relaxed slightly and rested his cheek on Draco's forehead for a few precious moments, his arm sneaking around Draco's chest also.
Valerio might be dead and gone but they would not grant him any kind of victory, would not let him have any part of Harry, least of all his life. That was not something they’d let him claim!
It only served to unnerve and confuse the younger Vykélari further as it seemed. That was fine, Draco told himself, Harry would warm up to them in time.
"If you hadn't been such an asshole I wouldn't have done it!" Harry argued back, still trying to make sense of the very contradictory indications on Blaise's mood that the Italian's expression and body language and the sensations from the connection gave him and determine whether or not he should try to disarm him now that he still had the chance. The dark skinned man looked like a prowling panther, ready to pounce but ... there was still only the anger and fear and protectiveness and concern to be felt over the bond and Harry didn't think Blaise would attack him. Ever. It reassured him enough to not hold himself back after the unfortunate comment the Italian made next.
I decided against waiting another day or two before uploading this chapter, since I really want to get this over and done with. In this chapter Draco and Blaise are at their worst, they'll quickly learn better from now on.
"You could have reminded me." Draco grumbled ill-humouredly as he stood, wincing at the soreness in his nether regions.
As he stepped into the study, his mind was still in some kind of upheaval with different and violently conflicting thoughts and emotions twirling in a maelstrom of enormous proportions, gyrating towards a single realisation that he couldn't quite see and decipher yet.
A deceptive delusion, he knew that. A Vykélari's magic tended to be self-willed almost, like a second sub consciousness, or maybe it was the Vykélari's sub consciousness that took control of his magic once in a while – who knew? The only thing that mattered was that it would lash out if it thought its owner to be in danger, it would defend him viciously, and it would defend itself if someone tried to take control over it.
"Forcing Potter will gain you nothing, at this point, Lucius!" Severus interrupted and Blaise felt Draco relax at his side a bit, and he himself felt overcome with a pathetic gratefulness for the cold, pragmatic voice of reason their former potions professor managed to retain under the worst of circumstances.
Languidly Blaise leaned back against the comfort of his arm chair and folded his hands in front of him, elbows propped up on the arm rests, watching, because he knew the silence would be hard to bear for Harry.
But that was okay; if Malfoy could live with it, it couldn't be too hard a change to adapt to. He just needed to find out what this bloody inheritance entailed!
Severus was pleased to find that Damask Tower – a safe house that had been in the possession of the Zabini family for a couple of centuries now – was fairly easy to defend, even against the few people that might manage to set foot into it against all odds. Not that he meant to actually let Amalyne and Narcissa lay siege to him here. He would allow them to enter, at his own leisure of course.
! God, it was pure elation. It had never been so much a part of him than it was right at this very moment, exulting in being used for something this wonderful.
"Well done, Alfar." Blaise praised with a curt nod towards the diligent House-Elf as he and Draco entered the study and strode up to Harry's unconscious form that was lying on the carpet in front of the still burning fireplace - a sign that Alfar, too, was a little bit miffed with their ill-mannered, defiant guest, or else he would have conjured him something more comfortable to rest on. Which was quite alright, since Blaise himself wasn't too pleased with the little nuisance either, right now.
"If you hadn't persisted on wearing that ghastly shirt for this painting, it wouldn't be necessary. Honestly, that colour is
"No buts! Kiss me again and I'll castrate you!" Harry muttered darkly but without much conviction, trying to calm his still pounding heartbeat and ignore the tingling residue of overwhelming pleasure echoing through him.
But the Italian only looked down at him – and when had he fallen to his knees? – and Harry knew he wouldn't, could see it in the darkness there of those onyx eyes that this devil would really stop at nothing to get his submission and … anything. Anything, if only… Ron and Mione…
"I'm not your guest, though." The brunet pressed out, and really wasn't that the core of all the disputes between him and the two dominants? That he was indeed their captive and had no choice at all, no matter if it concerned staying at the manor or interacting with them or having them teach him.
How it blazed with unholy satisfaction within him, humming and swirling boldly in his ribcage. It burned his horror away and whispered to Harry of the necessity of making an example, showing the world that this was the deserved prize for messing with a submissive like him, for it had obviously forgotten. And the rampage now was only the beginning, he would paint this garden blood red and plant a seed of fear so strong that no one would ever dare to hurt him or his loved ones ever again! This, this was his canvas, waiting to be covered with the symbols of his rage and power.
But wherever it happened upon living flesh, it gathered together into a concentrated, powerful attack, delivering hard, spiteful punches and sharp stabs so that pained and shocked outcries conquered the general clamour. Hastily whipped up magical shields lasted for mere seconds before being perforated entirely, leaving their casters at the non-existent mercy of the very force they had tried to bind. More than one of his captors were swept off their feet as if they weighted nothing, those who barely managed to keep their footing, were forced back several steps, struggling against the unnatural wind and trying as best as they could to protect their faces.
“Alfar!” He hissed just as Draco tucked in his huge wings and moulded himself into a streamlined arrow head to break through the living wall of beasts. “Protect him!”
“There have been other inactive lines bearing the submissive traits that brought forth a line of male descendants who were however not powerful enough to induce the submissive inheritance.” Lucius continued his explanation in a haughty tone of voice. The transformation on the 222nd full moon of a young fledgling was a highly precarious and straining event that only the magically powerful would be able to survive. Therefore the body of someone with the necessary Vykélari genes would only allow the genes’ activation and the induction of the transformation if there was a possibility of survival. That Lucius himself was an active Vykélari was proof of his outstanding magical strength – even before his transformation, he had lesser features that he was proud of – this was simply something that made him distinctly superior to others, something that should be acknowledged.
Of course, there were a lot more sinister scars from his time in the magical world, mementos of his glorious adventures, souvenirs from his time in the limelight as a famous hero.
For a quick moment he almost had to close his eyes against the melting splinters, looking aside and into Draco’s gleaming pools of silver, flashing with the illogical, unreasonable outrage over the fact that the submissive next to him was being attacked but Harry was refocusing his gaze again, following the quickly retreating ring. It was almost past him but if he stretched just a little bit more ... just a bit– and god, it was frustrating to be unable to follow without the degrees of freedom that a broom offered, being literally glued to the chariot.
Somehow, this man's direct presence discomfited him more than the sudden apparition and the magical block combined. And the recent memories of his friends' screams, the cold cruelty with which he had ordered their torture had him tense and franticly alert, expecting the worst and restlessly wondering what the worst could be.
At that moment, a thin film of magic spread over the surface of the mirror, enveloping it completely and Draco raised his eyes to see Harry standing some feet away, his palms pressed to the reflective glass, his expression frozen and stiff. And the mirror shrank, the sides travelling towards the middle where it was held on the wall with hovering charms until it was nothing more than a little pane the size of a matchbox.
"It amazes me that you still find things to brood over after such a day." Draco murmured quietly into his ear with a hint of laughter in his voice before breaking away completely again as if he couldn't bear to stay still.
Pansy was a humanity opportunist, it was a miracle that she had even gone to the pains of lending Harry's friends her most beloved mirror without any obvious benefits. And Draco … Draco would never have betrayed his parents.
”He was only a marginal figure in the war and would have been ignored by the public in favour of bigger fish. But now? Considering that Lucius has already been convicted once and then escaped prison, and with the entire wizarding community watching, not even the most generously bribed judges will be able to acquit him of the charges, especially when everyone is suspecting him and his son of having abused their boy-hero! And after that article and your lack of adequate response to it, that is exactly what everyone will think!”
Had the situation been a different one, Blaise might have felt a twinge of pity at the way the little Elf gaped at him pleadingly, eyes shining bright with unshed tears, her fists buried in the folds of the old curtain wrapped around her diminutive form and her whole body shivering, trembling violently. Blaise understood that she was afraid to receive clothes this time after having been lucky to escape that fate when she had sent away Harry's letter to his friends. The very same letter that had now convinced the guardia that Blaise and Draco were abusive bastards…
Neither did they give up. Strategic, orderly retreats, sure… feigned surrenders, of course; better than failure in any case. But Malfoy’s didn’t accept defeats, they didn’t leave anything untried as long as there was still the tiniest possibility of success.
"Not until you let me explain!" Blaise growled back. It hadn't been his fault; both Harry and he had reacted on instinct. Mordred, he himself was almost as ignorant as Harry was when it came to mating; it wasn't as if he had thought he or any other dominant Vykélari would ever need that knowledge again, after all. No, they were all stumbling through this whole mess like bumbling fools and they needed to be a little bit more accommodating towards each other if they wanted to survive the following weeks with their sanity intact. And he needed to make Harry understand. Now.
"Then you have it." Adler said, the tenseness around his eyes easing away and Draco had the odd feeling that there was some form of approval. In any case, the portrait settled back in his arm chair and folded his slender hands, as if he had been unmoved by the topic of their conversation and his descendant blackmailing him; like a businessman sifting through the different topics of a conference.
Right next to it, an artificial, probably magical well fed a small, stone-edged rivulet running downwards to the second terrace and into an impressively large pool, the water glittering in the sunlight so brightly that it almost blinded him. From there the little stream fled towards the sea, building small ponds where the water cascaded from one terrace to the other.
"Don't think of it now and don't pressure yourself. You've been through so much... let Draco and me show you around the Manor today and then, if you are not too tired, we could go swimming - either in the pool or the sea, whatever you prefer. Tomorrow you should be rested enough that we can explore your magic together and maybe fly a bit. You have no obligations here, Harry. Try to enjoy it and take all the time you need to familiarize yourself with your new abilities."
"Are you okay?" He asked in English and from the concern and tenseness in his deep timbre and his grip Draco knew that it was as much a caution as it was a query for his welfare. Without wands, without allies, they were reliant on the goodwill and believe of the guardia, whether Draco abhorred the very notion of depending on someone else, least of all Aurors, or not; it was a necessity.
"I am not aware of any wrongdoing!" He answered, harshly lifting his chin, secure in the knowledge that they could not have any solid evidence for neither he nor Draco had actually broken any Vykélari laws as far as he knew. But right in front of him one of the guardia, a man of mid-thirty with dark eyes and thin brown hair, snarled at him. Actually snarled!
It was all he could do not to go back to his fiancé and their colibri and throw him down to properly kiss him senseless with just as much intensity… Harry, not Blaise. Well, Blaise maybe, too.
"'M sorry." He slurred his speech, his mouth not cooperating in the way he wanted it to and he watched apprehensively as both Draco's and Blaise's hazy forms rushed over to him. God, his head hurt so much and why was his vision so blurry again?
For a moment there was silence and Harry tilted his head up to see the two Slytherins share a smile and a glance beneath hidden lashes that to him seemed oddly ominous…
"Which you'll see when we get there." Draco murmured close to his ears, making the hairs on Harry's neck raise. "And on the way there we are going to play pugna aerea – aerial combat – and since you are already experienced in warfare, I expect us to win, Harry."
Irritated, he watched as his school-nemesis came to a halt in front of them with slightly spread wings, uncertainly but silently standing there, probably trying to pick out where the other two men were from sound alone. ‘As if he would be able to fend us off right now even if he knew where we are’ Draco thought.
Draco's probably did, too, but he hid his amusement by lowering his gaze. "All but telling him to accompany us with nothing but some light silken pyjama trousers…" he murmured, his voice soft as silk.
"Don't!" Harry growled and now he did step back until his back was pressed tightly against the copper-coloured wings behind him and he glared at the Italian somewhat fiercely as if he could force him to let him go with his eyes alone.
But not before there were lips on his, hot and sweet and soft. Those lips! Sliding against his own, nipping, teasing and oh … fuck! Harry almost jerked as a tongue licked over his lips and a thumb stroke over his cheek and he just had to open his mouth, didn't he? With that insistent tongue gently forcing its way in, tasting sweet and a little bit sour like the balsamic sauce they had had with their lunch. But underneath that was something else that Harry had no name for, especially not when that agile muscle invaded his mouth like it did now, flicking against his own. A flutter in his chest and stomach transformed into impossible heat that travelled down to his groin, tingled through his whole body.
No, the wreckage to his feet was the work of a totally different being, an animal half mad with grief and pain and hate, reduced to its most basic instincts. A mortally injured lion determined to take as many with it as it could and all the more dangerous for its injury. He might not even recognize them…
For a moment Harry didn't know who had been hit for both Hermione and Ron started screaming, one shrill and full of terror, one a bit deeper but not less horrifying, together it was a cacophony that speared Harry with the destructive power of an expulso, digging itself deep into his chest and ripping at his heart with sharp, tearing claws, leaving him breathless and cringing.
That is, if she could ever have brought herself to speak to and not sneer at those she considered lower life forms.
No, no one had the right to demand of Harry to just forget and forgive all that had happened between their families, least of all Draco and Lucius, not even to ignore the past. The noble Gryffindor that he was had already helped his mother and him during their trials and given him back his wand; he had spared Draco's life by returning for him and right into the fiendfyre even with all their black history.
And suddenly the moment was there and Harry stood with his back to Blaise’s chest, their bodies held together with a sticking charm, toeing the edge of the chariot’s platform, Draco standing next to him, clasping his right hand tightly. The dark Italian’s warm breath teased against the shell of his ears, distracting but not enough so…
He was drawn from his thoughts however, as that insufferable Mediwizard licked over his lips nervously and all but breathed his name almost reverently “Mr Malfoy…”
Around her tall frame, Narcissa couldn't see very well, and nothing of importance, and it was maddening.
With a few, resolute steps Draco was at Harry's side, his long fingers closing around the younger man's elbow securely to ensure that the Gryffindor wouldn't rush forward and deliver himself up to his blackmailers.
Honestly, Harry was a bit nervous about their reaction. Of course he didn't expect them to go back on all of their promises and try to end the whole sticky situation by making him mate with them and he was convinced that they would do their best to keep him safe – which was still a rather strange, weird conception; it wasn't as if he had ever depended on others to protect him or thought he would in no way be able to deal with his inheritance without them holding and patting his hand. In any case he didn't rate them as a danger to himself.
He chirped questioningly, a little bit insecure. In front of him, Blaise grasped his shoulders to steady him, while Draco released his hold and moved around him. “You’ll love this…” the blonde said, no malice or mocking in his voice.
But against all his hopes, the magical tools had not given any proof to the cussedness of their owners. On the contrary. After dousing them with a potion designed to prolong the effects of a Prior Incantato, and watching a long line of phantom images that replayed the latest spells performed in reverse order, Ettore had to admit that there not only was no evidence for any kind of abuse, but that in fact everything indicated to the three British Vykélari being in a consensual relationship. At least, it seemed as if they were courting or dating.
That didn't mean he wasn't afraid or didn't wish there was another, an easier way. But there wasn't and that knowledge burned in his throat and made his hands tremble and sweat.
That didn't annoy Harry as much as it would have only some days ago; no, instead he savoured the praises coming from people who, Harry thought, would surely be very parsimonious with such words usually. At least he couldn't imagine them giving random compliments to their friends.
"So you have another chance at controlling me? No, thanks, asshole!" And the Gryffindor continued to struggle and squirm within Blaise's tight embrace.
At that moment, the realisation truly hit home for the first time, the realisation that Harry might kill them all.
Harry nodded, dazedly, but inwardly he felt as if his world had been changed into a sphere of millimetre-thin glass that was cracked by his many questions: would he regain control over his magic, would he ever see again? How would he look like? He didn’t really care about the latter but still he didn’t want to be stared at any more and he didn’t know how Ginny would react…
Draco knew that his family had committed many shameful crimes and it had taken him so long to be able to reconcile that fact with the view that had been hammered into his young mind from a very tender age on. How much time and effort had it taken for Draco to step out of his family's overpowering shadow, start to think by himself and become his own person? The person that Blaise loved.
Generale Carraci tilted his head, thoughtfully. "You mean to tell us that signore Potter is responsible for this? The destruction of Lanai Manor, the deaths... even Malfoy and Zabini's transformation, the 'darkness' in them?"
Almost leisurely Draco let the skeleton of his wings press against the skin of his back, denting it outwards, expanding it with the lengthening bones.
Polyjuiced then, most likely using the hair of a muggle, or possibly some transfiguration spell. And since the room he was in was unfamiliar to Draco as well, Harry's Pensieve memories were not applicable proofs for the guardia to convict Blaise's uncle, whose presence at the manor could be explained with Harry's letter because as a representative of the Vykélari council he had the duty to pursue any hint to the infraction of Vykélari law. For all they knew, it could be a complete coincidence that Harry was blackmailed the same evening that the council was notified of the letter.
"Why not?" Narcissa asked, cold determination freezing her delicately chiselled features into a mask of stone and ice. "He willingly witnessed for me and Draco, didn't he, when there has been nothing but bad blood between him and us in the past. Why ever would he do that if he hadn't already felt drawn to my son?"
Lucius is beside himself with rage over the article as it endangers the outcome of his trial and the standing of purebloods and demands that Draco and Blaise force Harry into a mating bond and bring him back to Britain where he intends to use Harry's prestige and power to keep himself out of prison and his family's reputation intact. Amalyne explains their plan to arrange an illusion for the public to disguise the true role they have intended for Harry and Narcissa makes it clear that she has the means to force Harry to yield to their wishes. First Severus then Draco and Blaise try to reason with them until Lucius tries to guild-trap his son and Blaise loses his temper, closing the mirror-connection after telling their parents that he and Draco will never force Harry nor allow them near him while he is still unmated.
Demonstratively he tugged in his chin and walked past the two Slytherins towards the stone path leading down the garden terraces towards the beach down below.
It started with the not quite unfounded fear of those with more active roles in the war that the punishments awaiting them might be more than they could shoulder, that each trial would be short, unfair and resulting in the loss of freedom, standing, wealth and much more; that an imprisonment would leave their families without protection, support and in a more materialistic sense without a job and sometimes when reparations were due, even without a home. And consequently they searched out the help of those able to bribe or threaten the Aurors and Wizengamot members and lessen the impact. And if that was not possible, then to at least care and provide for those that a prisoner left behind. In exchange they and their families became indebted to their benefactors.
So, despite his somewhat rushed appearance, Draco purposefully and determinedly strode through the wide hallways of his fiancé's home that were so much warmer and homely than Malfoy Manor could ever be, until finally he came to stand in front of a narrow, inconspicuous door. It was held in the same artfully painted swirls of oranges, terracotta and gold that covered the rest of the corridor and it would have been almost invisible if one didn't know that it was there in the first place.
war hero of the Second Wizarding War. People will listen to you, stand behind you, follow you. They will follow a powerful wizard who won't exploit his powers."
And yet, the reflexive urge to retaliate, to inflict pain and humiliation, to press and push and crush... all those grand fantasies that Severus had carefully cultivated and revelled in so often before had lost their lustre, their brilliance, now that they were confronted with reality.
With almost no sound at all the bowl settled on the stone floor, handled with so much care by the Elf that levitated it – Alfar, Draco ascertained as he looked up briefly, already having sunken to his knees in front of the shadowy, silvery swirling liquid.
Whether Harry would have managed to save his friends, whether he himself would be able to escape… it would already be decided in a few hours. Until then he could only take this situation one problem at a time and whether his blackmailers would take away his escape route was not something Harry could change at this point.
More than ever his current helplessness threatened to burn away his reason and he found himself pacing up and down the conference room, waiting for news from Daphne, or from Draco – because, to add to his agitation, his blonde fiancé had almost immediately left the room again so that he'd be able to continue monitoring Harry via the Pensieve that was fed by a steady stream of the submissive's experiences, watching over him.
"Blaise." The man greeted him, his voice ominously free of any trace of the cautious warmth that he had previously used in his conversations with his nephew. Of course that wasn't too surprising: Blaise had never been very close to the family of his father, mostly due to his mother and his mother's deeds. Being widowed once was sad; twice was a true tragedy. But to be widowed seven times was more than just circumstantial evidence for murder, even if there was no real proof for foul play that any court would accept.
"Please stop." Harry whispered, frustrated, the limit of his endurance reached long ago. But Taide didn't, his forefinger moving in another line over his skin, before drawing an angle.
The sight before Ettore now however was not, and never would be, humorous. Even though Zabini and Malfoy definitely looked as if they had added animal components to a polyjuice potion. Like the feather of an entirely unknown bird of prey.
He would leave the manor, conspicuously through the front door, so that if something might go wrong and he was discovered, the guardia would be able to observe Draco's and Blaise's hopefully dramatic and determined attempts to keep him inside, thus strengthening the guardia's already carefully fanned impression of them abusing Harry. And if he alerted anyone, his blackmailers would be able to hear it and his friends' lives were forfeited.
"There might be another witness." Mancini interrupted quietly. "We found a young man in the ruins, injured and unconscious, but alive. We didn't dare try to heal him on site with the residual dark magic, so I had him brought to the hospital."
Again he was ignored, his stomach cramping painfully as he looked to his friends again – at least they couldn't reach them there, right? Whatever this ritual was supposed to do, it wasn't meant for Hermione or Ron…
There was Ricarda lying on the ground with her pale arms held protectively above her head as scarlet blossomed around small slashes in her fair dress. Like poppies so red and beautiful, and she twitched and turned but couldn't escape the razors of pale blue-white light that danced around her.
Severus' eyes narrowed in alarm, his hands frozen over the Gryffindor's prone form as he watched the spell's delicate network rupture, the tatters flying away like the shreds of a torn spider web in a gust of wind, before dissolving entirely.
"I am. All my senses returned and I only had a bad case of magical exhaustion afterwards but Draco and Blaise said that was normal."
Pressing his tongue against the smooth row of his teeth, Draco tried to rein in his irritation. "I don't have time for your peculiarities, Adler!" He snapped. "You know what just happened outside. I need you to tell me everything that might even remotely pertain to Harry's current whereabouts."
Still. It was a basis on which they could work. As long as the boys were alive and well, a Black could work with anything.
"Careful, Marcus, or Cygnus will throttle you in your painting." The current Malfoy patriarch answered without looking back. The portrait however, fell silent. Cygnus was notorious for his cruelty as well as for his fatherly affection towards a certain potions master. And there were certain nasty things a portrait could do to another portrait.
And they would dangle the perfect bait in front of Harry as well: the freedom and safety and the very life of his best friends. Just in case that the submissive was strong enough to withstand the dominant's advances…
"Well," the brunette began, letting the word linger on her tongue until Ron wondered if it had paralysed the muscle, "I am actually here as a favour to your friend, Potter. You see," she continued quickly, when Ron's eyes narrowed even further, "Draco and Blaise - you know, Blaise Zabini - they approached me because Potter wanted to speak with you and..."
Blaise smiled at him, and seeing the warm approval in his expression, Harry remembered how disappointed the Italian had been when he had insisted on his natural – well, his
With a resigned sigh, Harry stepped closer even while Draco once again turned away from him with an elegant twirl that would have put a certain potions professor to shame.
From then on he had been met with one refusal, one failure after another. Acquaintances and friendships that he had made during his last visits before the war in Britain turned him away or didn't even answer, unwilling to openly show their colours in the rare cases they sympathised with him, but mostly outright refusing to even speak out against the Lanais, especially since helping Blaise and Draco would mean going against Vykélari law which would deliver them up to the mercy of the Lanais as the major source for representatives of the Vykélari Council, the very family they would agitate against.
Of course, almost five years later little remained of that lesson but the funny memory of horse features transfiguring the pretty face of a sulking child into something long and hairy and outlandish. Not to mention the teeth! Medea, those teeth...
But it had. And it was Harry's and the Slytherins fault for involving them when they had known how dangerous it might become even while placating them and downplaying the immediate danger. It was only right that Harry would accept the responsibility and fix it in whatever way he must.
The Gryffindor hadn't confessed to his hosts that he had no intention of using the one Blaise had gifted him with; because, with one portkey short, the dark Italian would not be able to escape danger if it somehow found them and Harry had never left anyone behind to save his own hide and he was not going to start now. But the Slytherins didn't need to know that, did they? Otherwise they'd surely reconsider their plans and Harry found himself rather looking forward to wherever they wanted to take him. Besides, he had an idea that Draco didn't plan on using his own portkey either and abandon his fiancé. As a result, one could say that the emergency portkeys were for appearances' sake only.
For barely a second he considered apologising for the traps he had set the other witch, but in any case he didn’t feel very apologetic and both of them already knew it.
"I don't care for your problems right now!" She stated with an air of finality. "And they won't even remain your main ones for much longer. Just you wait and see, Zabini." She  said, much too calmly for comfort, her smooth voice dripping with grim satisfaction as she folded her hands in her lap as if she was doing nothing more than discussing her picnic plans for the next day. "After that article is published tomorrow, I will watch your family fall, and the Malfoys as well. And I'll make sure that you won't pull any Greengrass down with you!"
The rest of its body might have been called graceful if it wasn't so strangely disproportioned, promising a lethal agility as soon as the gargoyle awoke. The beast had obviously been manufactured to be the perfect predator, with a sleek body and muscles that were lean enough to be fast and yet strong enough to be a force to be reckoned with.
"Umm, you know, I wasn't … I really didn't intend to …" Harry shrugged and let go of his abused hand to rub over his brow with his reddened knuckles instead as he searched for words. Discreetly Blaise glanced over to his fiancé but Draco seemed unwilling to come to the stuttering Gryffindor's aide even though it should have been his task being the one their guest was speaking to. He sighed, realising that it was up to him once again to comfort the younger submissive – not that he really minded; he had no desire to see either of them like this…
Normally the mind just accepted a single thought, as long as it wasn't too traumatic, as a distant memory that one couldn't clearly integrate into a contentual and temporal context. But if it overlaid with an existing one, then the multiple perspectives were difficult to deal with and absorbing another person's remembrances could lead to nausea and even mild shocks, the mind fighting the obvious intruder like a body would a foreign object. The experience might be pushed to overwhelming proportions because one did not only incorporate the visual and acoustic aspects of a past happening, but also emotions and sensations.
It would have sounded reasonable and Pansy might have believed the two of them if Draco hadn't slipped earlier. 'We won't do that to him' ... no, this sounded as if there was more emotion than rationality guiding their behaviour regarding the Golden Boy right now. And that might become a problem. Even dangerous.
"You're staring, Malfoy." It seemed to seriously unnerve him, more so than the day before. He was a little bit jittery, Draco thought, wondering what could have caused the change in behaviour overnight. Almost as if he was nervously waiting for something to happen…
“What are they supposed to do?” Narcissa asked scornfully, cocking her head. “With a submissive,” she nodded towards the boy, one palm hovering over his chest as if to claim him for her family already, “we will be too powerful to attack. And they know it. They will not even dare to try.”
Ron looked at her sharply while Parkinson muttered something below her breath that sounded suspiciously like 'out of the goodness of my heart'.
"We'll leave you alone, now. And don't worry about the mirrors: you can keep this one here in your room if you like and we arranged for its counterpart to stay with your friends for as long as you are here in Lanai Manor, so you will always be able to contact each other. They are two-way-mirrors, that is..."
Well, that was a problem… Draco and Blaise shared an alarmed glance as they approached the table also and seated themselves on the opposite side of Harry.
Adler sighed, looking out of the side of his portrait for but a moment before turning back to his young descendant with a grave look. "I'm afraid you will not like it. I certainly didn't. But it is nothing that can't be turned to your advantage.
And then there was the fact that his father would usually hold mirror-meetings in his study and not in the parlour the foursome currently occupied. Though Draco guessed that might have something to do with the amount of portraits hanging on the far wall, there would never have been space enough for them in his father's study, stuffed with book shelves as it was. Merlin, there must have been more than a dozen pictures of varying sizes…
Still a little bit stunned he followed Malfoy's advice and thought of the sound of his voice as he heard it, the small vibrations that one felt during speaking but only when one concentrated on them. Something shifted in his throat. Not painfully, just oddly and he reached up, feeling the tendons and the hard knob that was his voice box.
"Better than my father." Draco deadpanned, but his eyes held a soft glimmer now, and one corner of his mouth twitched traitorously as he wavered on the brink to the tender amusement blossoming below his earlier bitter frustration.
He looked over to Harry, but the brunet kept staring ahead stubbornly and there was a curious expression on his face that Blaise didn't like much, though he couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was that bothered him. He was unaware of the spark of irritation growing inside Harry: Finally, finally he had found something worthwhile in this whole mating-business, and it was the one thing that the two dominants were uncomfortable with. How fucked up was that?
Severus had applied it before, when assisting Poppy in the Hospital Wing, and so he had little difficulty to feed the tube through Potters nose all the way down into the stomach and pour the potions into the enlarged ending.
Rolling his eyes, more to overcome the heat tainting his cheeks than true annoyance, Harry gave Ron a wry look that clearly meant 'I can fight my own battles'. At least the redhead seemed as embarrassed as he was, the tip of his ears camouflaging to match the flicks of fiery red hair falling over them like the skin of a chameleon.
"As I was about to summarize before you so rudely interrupted me: The closer the magic is to you, to your core, the easier it is to control. By touching, you and Draco are facilitating a temporary connection to each other's magic and body."
Loud rattling and clinking broke the heavy silence as almost two dozen bottles of the expensive brew tore themselves from their shelves to rush towards the dark wizard. Like a flock of birds they came flying, the slender golden bodies gleaming unnaturally bright in the dim light of the candles.
The next two chapters contain a lot of details about Vykélari magic and flying. I hope you won't be bored...
together, such a contradictory couple: warm and open versus cold and secretive, colourful and approachable versus black and pristine.
"Lucius!" Severus interrupted once again, his voice sharp with reproach as he sat up in his chair. "Get hold of yourself!"
Okay, maybe not Hufflepuff; for that Harry seemed too uncomfortable all of a sudden with giving compliments. "Yeah, well, you know, he said how Adler had been so relieved when you… you know, during the end of the war and all? And I mean I was, too. If I hadn't thought you to be better than your father I wouldn’t have stood witness for you…"
For a moment, Blaise wondered if he had heard correctly, feeling quite dumbfounded and he couldn't help but be a little bit wary in the face of this latest development. Had Ives really managed to do what they had tried to achieve during the last one and a half day in one and a half
Disoriented and still drowsy with sleep, Harry let his eyes flutter open and blinked against the bright sunlight falling directly on his face. With a tormented groan he squeezed them shut again and turned his head away from the cruel light into the soft cushion cradling his head, searching the darkness that would allow him a little bit more sleep. God, he felt so knackered…
And just like a flock of starlings encountering a raptor these demonic things reacted to Draco’s rushed appearance with grace and agility. But where the survival instinct of the small animals would have made them scatter apart to evade a larger predator, these creatures were driven by Harry’s pain, his grief and hate.
Draco narrowed his eyes, wondering why the healer was already trying to justify himself. But he found himself to be mostly surprised at the flaring anger in his chest, anger on Potter's behalf.
Blaise didn't get to ask that question out loud as a low murmur from his companion tore him from his musings.
It was not difficult to muster the disgust and rage to fuel his determination, and Harry snarled at the man, his claws curling threateningly against Taide's throat. "Let my friends go, Valerio, and I won't have to butcher your son!"
”But we only follow those inactive lines into the 7th generation. If the trait has not come forth until then, the line is declared extinct. I think one of the last families whose blood was weakened enough for that was the Potter line. Three generations ago we finally declared the line lost.” A small smile played over Lucius’ thin lips. It never failed to amuse him that the one to kill the Dark Lord – one of the most powerful wizards of his time – was someone whose family had grown so weak that it had lost the ability to reap the fruits of their pure blood.
Harry decided not to care for as long as they weren’t carried out; maybe this was the difference between Slytherins and Gryffindors playing cops and robbers…
Blaise reached for his own wand, not even sure whether he wanted to stun the Gryffindor or cast a Protego between the two fighters so they wouldn't hurt each other further; at the very same moment Harry was snatching that beautiful piece of hawthorn and unicorn hair that was Draco's weapon out of the blonde's loosened grip. Just as Blaise raised his hand, the guardia behind him reacted, thinking him about to attack the submissive.
Harry blinked in surprise, but before he could follow that discovery further a movement to his right made him redirect his focus to the old wizard who had now pushed away from the wall and was approaching Harry with slow, hobbling steps, a small, crystalline bottle in his spidery fingers – wherever that had come from.
But right now it was not something that could be avoided: someone had to go through this, suffer the same visions and emotions that Harry went through and Draco, having already seen those of the past day, was better equipped to understand what was going on. They didn't have the time for Blaise to go through Harry's memories that the spying potion had collected, as well…
Exposing his physical and emotional feelings and thoughts though, was quite another matter and it just went against every Slytherin instinct ingrained into his mind, and yet, it also aroused the morbid curiosity of a small, half-hidden part of him. A part that he usually labelled as insane and downright self-destructive and dangerous and tried to ignore to the best of his ability. Not always successfully, but mostly.
Pansy was in a right snit. And she had every right to be, in her humble opinion. Nothing in her life during the last few years had worked out the way it should have. First Draco had had the audacity to fall in love with their school's pretty boy and asked her to cover up for him so that neither Blaise's nor his parent's would learn of their affair. Of course she'd said yes, what else should a well-mannered, noble-minded girl of a respectable pureblood family have done if a friend asked for her help? Especially since she loved the two idiots. Very grudgingly, mind you, obstinate bastards that they were. Merlin, and without her, they would have just managed to make away with themselves somehow, or throw their cover, or destroy their twisted joy in life in some way or the other. Somehow, she just knew it; they were reckless and narrow-minded like that. Nonetheless she wouldn't have been averse of becoming the next Mrs Malfoy, or Zabini for that matter.
And Ron convulsed on the ground, writhing with the all-overpowering agony of the curse, shouting and screaming himself horse in seconds, past all sanity and coherence. Next to him Hermione rocked herself back and forth, hands covering her ears and eyes clenched shut tightly against this horror scenario while she screamed and screamed and it was so incomprehensible, so unreal. It must be a nightmare…
And that part realised with nauseating certainty that the time was running short as well: the destructive storm was already toning down, the cacophony of wind and magic and screams was gradually dying away while the tempest of dust and leaves dissolved, the particles fluttering to the ground like dancing ghosts.
"Harry," Draco impatiently raised an eye-brow, "you really don't want to transform like that, do you? You would tear the shirt and the pressure on the growing wings is rather painful, or so I'm told. We'll show you tomorrow how to cut two slits into the fabric word- and wandlessly and close them afterwards but I think we should use less … expensive clothing for that."
about him, not even Ginny, brave and pragmatic Gin. But the faint surprise was sluggish and went to sleep as soon as it had started to awake, helped along by the soothing, very distracting flow of magic, Harry's and Blaise's.
It was only a dim ray of hope, but when had that ever stopped Harry? Of course agreeing to a risky act of recklessness like this would look like nothing short of an act of desperation, but then, Harry was desperate. At least if he did this, he could honestly claim that he had tried everything. And fortune favoured the brave.
Damask Tower, however, looked like she imagined it always had. Unmoved by time, unmarred by nature's forces or any scuffle it had seen since its building countless centuries ago; a solid rock in a softly moving sea of densely packed trees and shrubs that surged and rippled with the wind.
engagement party, Blaise, come, and let’s enjoy it.” and with that he steered his fiancé back towards their guests.
Upon noticing that he had some precious moments left to hide, Harry's first impulse was to jump up from where he laid so vulnerably on the bed, grab his wand and get into an easily defensible position; resolutely he opened his eyes and swept his gaze over the bedside table with trained efficiency, grazing the dark, the
And so far they had already depleted all the legal means, they had even gone so far as to ask the newly appointed minister Kingsley Shacklebold for help. But he had only told them to wait and stressed to them the importance of keeping their silence. It had been disillusioning to be reprimanded for coming to the minister in the first place, even though he was right: strictly speaking they hadn't been allowed to tell anyone of the situation after being filled in by the Malfoy matriarch. And since nobody - even the minister - should have any knowledge of the situation, no one could help.
To top everything, his magic had followed his lead throughout the day, not interfering the slightest bit with his actions and feelings, at least not that he could tell. It had swirled in excitement and hummed in appreciation, but mostly it had been content and quiet. And maybe that had something to do with the fact that Harry had not tried to push Draco and Blaise away, had indulged their wishes, had not attempted to pull back when they had gotten physically close. Or it was something simpler: so far his magic had only interfered when he had been angry or afraid or simply overwhelmed, urging him to rely on the two dominants that had guided him through his transition, taken him in afterwards and protected him. Maybe it was enough for his magic to have Harry trust them?
He might have reached for his wand to vanish them altogether, had Blaise not grabbed his collar and pulled him in for a harsh, forceful kiss, teeth clashing almost painfully against his as the Italian sought to take the control that up to this moment had almost solely lain in Draco's hands.
Even after all he had been through, Draco was, with his 18 years, not ready to die; he was painfully aware of the fact, the knowledge that he had still so much to lose. All the little pleasures, his riches, his family, his life, Blaise.
Harry cocked his head, wanting to insist that he didn't need anyone to keep himself safe, because mostly it was true that he didn't. But being able to complete a task alone didn't mean that one necessarily should or that it was the intelligent thing to do. He'd stay alert, of course – sometimes Harry thought he'd never again be able to not keep an eye out for any eventuality – but Blaise and Draco were familiar with the region and the people and if they really wanted to be in charge of their safety, of his, if it was so important to them that he trust them both with this task, Harry could let them.
He had been far too arrogant, so sure of his capabilities as a renowned potions master that he had ignored his suspicions that something had been wrong with the young Vykélari’s magic. Instead Severus had blithely fed him those potions like a reckless Gryffindor. The very potions that had pushed the boy into a magical shock and subsequent cardiac arrest. Any ailment that he suffered from now beyond the initial stab wound was a direct result of that particular foolishness.
"Don't you care at all about what happens to you? God, that gryffindorish stupidity, always courting danger!"
Severus convinces Narcissa that Lucius will have to go to prison no matter whether Draco and Blaise mate Harry or not and that it would lead to a milder sentence if they pretended that they only ever intended to keep Harry safe until Hogwarts reopened.
Draco cringed and pressed his palms against his ears, crying out and feeling more than hearing Giallina do the same behind him. Merlin, it was deafening!
Harry shook himself, taking a deep breath as he closed his eyes and tried to calm down. If he wanted to see this through, he needed to steer his thoughts away from the anger and disgust, needed to accept the man as his mate. Still, he found his jaw clenching and his hands balled into tight fists as Taide's fingers started to play on his skin, drawing a line down his thigh. Couldn't he just leave him be, for just a few minutes, so that he could catch his bearings? Wasn't that why he had asked Valerio for a break?
"Wait, Daphne!" Blaise called out, rushing to his feet and towards her, only stopping when it appeared as if they were standing right in front of each other, barely two handbreadth between each of them and the reflective surface of the two-way mirror.
Draco had to close his eyes at the vision he had conjured up in front of his mind's eye and suppress a moan himself. He didn't bother berating himself for the lack of self-restraint, it was probably the fault of Harry's beautiful feathers and markings anyway that caused him to have such daydreams in the middle of a corridor in his fiancé's home (a Malfoy like himself really should have more self-control and usually, he had); it was maybe just a bit morally reprehensible that they were not about his fiancé per se, but Draco deemed it sufficient that Blaise had featured in them, in any case, he really couldn't find it in himself to worry over that trivia.
There it was, a tiny fissure in the polished granite of her façade. Her eyes unerringly lowered themselves to his forearms, where the unblemished robe he was wearing would not have been able to hide a bleeding Tiwaz rune.
No, he couldn't trust anyone within this blasted house. He needed to leave, find his way back to England and his friends and sort this out, even with his somewhat dubious control over his magic. If anyone would be able to deal with that it were the two persons who had stood at his side during the war. Malfoy and Zabini in contrast had proven that they didn't know how to handle the situation: all they had done so far was making his magic lash out, who said it wouldn't happen again? Who guaranteed him that they would be able to help him regain control over it?
At that, Harry found himself speechless and he had to bite his lower lip and turn away. In his life there had been only a handful of people so protective of him, and all of them had been or still were very dear to him. Molly, for example, or Sirius. Most had always known that Harry was literally fated (or should he say prophesized) to get into precarious situations, to have to fight and kill and they hadn't stood in his way, and some like Hermione and Ron had helped him wherever they could. But only few had been actually trying to spare him all that, as laughable as it seemed to challenge fate.
Hermione would never have thought that she'd ever have to return to the very place that she had been tortured in by Bellatrix Lestrange. Nevertheless, she now stood here in front of the dark building, willingly waiting for someone to come and allow them entrance. It would probably be a House Elf. But she couldn't bring herself to care right now.
"Promise me!" He urged and Harry startled a bit before he turned his gaze downwards again, letting his fingers wander over the smooth rings of the invisible chain hesitatingly, a shiver running down his spine. But this was Blaise's emergency portkey, what if something
Perhaps that was a bit blunt, but Draco could be so very stubborn if he wanted to, and the long years of friendship and more with the young Malfoy scion had taught him that critic always had to be delivered in a direct way lest it be ignored completely.
the ministry won't give you leave to use a portkey, especially not in the middle of the night. But I do already have a portkey to Zabini Manor."
Tense and silent, Narcissa followed her friend into the tower, again and again having to remind herself not to tighten the grip on her wand too much lest her wrist became too stiff for good spellwork. With every step she became more nauseous and dizzy with anxiousness as her eyes searched in vain for any hint of pale skin and blonde hair.
Forcing himself to drop that line of thinking, Harry straightened out. It was already too late for that. People had noticed and though it might have been possible to cover his inheritance up, the Malfoys and Zabinis had made that impossible by making him disappear so suddenly from the public eye. There was no point in mourning squandered chances.
Draco frowned, his curiosity getting the better of him. However he was very much aware of Blaise’s presence next to him and why they were both here. This was their engagement party, one he couldn’t just leave.
If it was true that Harry was as powerful as they made him out to be, then he couldn't think of anything worse than giving that potential into the hands of people who had already proven that they had no scruples against kidnapping teenagers and torturing and killing them…
Hermione and Ron each occupied one chair, both of them looking tired and worn. But their expressions brightened immediately upon seeing Harry and a cacophony of greetings broke loose.
They were the only weaknesses in this plan, and perhaps the ones that held the answer Draco so desperately needed.
"Fred!" Arthur hissed, grabbing his son's shoulder tightly to restrain him. God, everything depended on the goodwill of the woman in front of them. They could do nothing to help if she didn't tell them where Harry was.
Curious himself, Blaise trained his eyes on the brunet, observing with interest how his golden skin flushed appealingly. What, by Mordred, had Ives told the Gryffindor to embarrass him so?
His emotions must have been openly visible on his face because only a moment later Ives said with a voice like steel "Don't you judge me for yielding to his conditions, Mr Potter! You may judge me for getting into the situation that forced my hand for that was indeed my mistake, but dare not judge me for righting it in the only way that was left to me!"
That wasn’t the sound of a magical creation, not the sound of one of Harry’s birds and unlike the clear outcries of pain or surprise or fright that he had heard from Blaise and Alfar and used to track their movements with, this was one of mortal terror and death, high and shrill and loud and abruptly tapering off into a horrifying gurgling and coughing that planted the nightmare of a pierced lung or a cut throat in Draco’s mind.
“Was it even true?” she spat, her anger gaining more momentum, and she let the basket fall to the ground with the loud clinking and rattling of glass bottles, only to reach into her pocket and pull out the crumbled remains of a piece of paper that she flung at him.
His hands twitched at his side, one with the desperate desire for his wand, one with the need to hide the sudden heaviness of his one and only escape plan – or perhaps to use it? A word fell from his lips, involuntarily and almost too low to be heard, barely more than a gasp. "Three…"
And now he also understood Daphne's irrationally furious behaviour, because in her eyes theirs was the worst offence of all: unknowingly and unintentionally Blaise and Draco had involved the one Daphne loved the most: her little sister Astoria. Blaise knew the girl had had a major crush on his lover for quite a long time, had hoped to catch his attention when the two of them had broken up before the war… and those feelings had never really faded, even though the smart young girl knew quite well and should already have accepted that she stood no chance with the Malfoy heir, especially now after Draco was officially engaged.
"Harry…" Draco sighed, all the giddiness of a moment earlier all but vanished. He hadn't thought much during that moment after Harry's escape attempt, not past the single-minded exhilaration that only contesting with the Saviour of the Wizarding World was able to instil in him. And though apologies did not easily pass his lips, he knew that in this case a silent acknowledgement in the form of a missing contradiction was just not enough. "I am sorry."
Well, it didn't really matter, since both, in his opinion, were absolutely, perfectly reasonable excuses for such a stunt. Especially since he had won.
None of them seemed to be truly injured – nothing the Elves couldn’t heal with a few charms anyway, which they had already started doing. Blaise released a breath that shivered as much from relief as from pain and anxiousness.
The truth was that Draco loved his parents dearly and being raised with the beliefs of purebloods and the old wizarding traditions meant to be raised to be loyal to them as well; the notion couldn't be suppressed entirely even while at the same moment he couldn't quite ignore Blaise's harsh, furious words during that conversation with Adler and Ives.
Why the hell had Draco stepped away? He had thought all three of them were enjoying themselves, basking in the closeness, intensity and intimacy after the initial discomfort at the unexpected sensations (and at the identity of the participants) had faded. He himself certainly had…
Why the hell would they allow Harry to come into any contact with the outside world? Every book, every document he and Hermione, and at times Ginny had sifted carefully during the past few days, agreed on that one point: a dominant coming upon an unmated submissive (he really needed to find some alternative term) would hide the both of them away until the bond was safely in place, however long that took; which usually wasn't longer than a few days.
"Draco," he pleaded a bit hoarsely, taking a hesitant step towards the blonde, "you know that I love you, right?"
But more than this first number to activate the portkey would never disturb the nocturnal air. While it might be stupid and naïve Harry couldn't be anything but who he was: loyal and courageous to a fault, a good friend… he couldn't leave Hermione and Ron behind at the mercy of their tormentors, knowing that in a few hours' time they'd be dead. And who knew how long they'd be flying? How long it would take the plane to land so that they could be reached through apparition? Surely too long. Surely the time was chosen so that Harry would have no chance to save them before they'd be slaughtered.
Italian. Had someone recognized them at the restaurant? Had the Battellis betrayed Harry's whereabouts?
deluded…" the blonde sighed dramatically and then there was a small pause before Harry heard Draco take a calming breath and continue somewhat calmer and more politely but still a little bit uppish. "Ives, it might have escaped your notice, but you are a
"Yes, I did. They had another painting of me which I sometimes visited. It was kept for possibly emerging submissives so that I might guide them after their inheritance, but that proved to be unnecessary in the end." Ives frowned thoughtfully. "I don’t know what happened to it, I can't visit it anymore and I can't help but think that Molly destroyed it after her brothers' murder. She was … uncomfortable having the painting of a Malfoy in her home and I guess it reminded her too much of what she had lost."
