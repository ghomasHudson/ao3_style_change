“I love you,” Draco says over the torrent of Harry’s voice.
“Can do.” Draco smiled up at him, took a sip of his tea, and twisted to peck Harry on the mouth.
She shrugged. “I don't know. It’s interesting that you know these things, I suppose. Interesting that you bring it up now.”
"Ron wants to meet up soon."
Draco smiled and knelt down by Scorpius. "He said you could play outside until it's time to go, love."
Scorpius set his head back on Draco's shoulder and wrapped his arms around Draco's neck as Draco made his way to Harry. He held out the flowers for Harry to take, and stood by in silence while Harry set them down on the graves.
"Yes. Didn't you know?" Harry knows Draco didn't know. Harry could tell from the creases in Draco's eyes, the burn over his nose, the green backpack he bought on Pearl Street that he was falling in love.
Draco had no fucking clue what Wilson was talking about.
"Liar," said Harry, and Draco didn't disagree.
Draco allowed himself to breathe and sit. “You’re the gardener of the estateー”
There was nothing, yet. Still only flat stomach and the trail of hair leading into his waistband and the scar over his hip from where he’d accidentally cut himself with a bread knife last summer.
Draco touches a hand to his chest. “My, my, Harry. I think you’re spending too much time with me.”
They tried to live their lives the way they had been doing for the past decade. Or at least, Draco tried. Harry seemed set on spending every second as if it was Draco's last. Draco wanted to tell him that he still had months and months before the symptoms were supposed to get bad, and almost half a year until he was really in danger of keeling over unexpectedly. But when Harry blinked at him too hard over coffee, when he folded the sheets over Draco's lap before bed, and when he started putting little handwritten notes with scribbled hearts in Draco's lunch... well, Draco didn't say anything.
“Hello.” Draco stared straight ahead. He didn’t say what he was thinking, which was,
Draco smacks his bum. “Get up and brush your teeth, you buffoon.”
Harry reached a hand out to touch Draco's arm.
“Did I?”
Wilson’s eyebrows went up. “That’s a little on the nose.”
“No,” Draco said. “Telling you that I realize. That I know what I almost lost. What
Harry nudged his nose against Draco's. "Love them."
Harry's voice. "Right."
Not that this was unplanned. Harry knew wizards could get pregnant. He’d been taking potions for almost two years now, hoping to get pregnant. But nothing had happened. Every test had come back negative. Every time, Harry had lied down in bed, his back turned to Draco, and cried. Cried for nothing, because there was nothing - no one - in him.
"Yes, keep up," Draco said. He patted Molly's back. "Can you take one of these bags? My arm is getting sore."
Jane falls out of her chair.
"Don't look so murderous."
“Draco Malfoy,” Wilson said from somewhere behind them, a fair amount of time later.
When it was over, the Healer tried to place the baby in his arms. Draco sat limply and did not look at it. Something tight knotted in between his ribs, and Draco longed to hold out his arms and take the baby and hold it tight. He wanted to love it - he already loved it - but he couldn't look at it.
"But what about you?" said Harry. "This all makes sense, but how did this curse get into Draco's body?"
, the style is supposed to be relaxed. Don't do up all the buttons.”
"Yeah." Harry let out a sort of laugh. "We're in Mungo's, baby."
"What do you mean?" Harry bit at the soft skin under Draco's ear. "And then you're dead. Dead, dead, dead. I'll never see you again, or touch you again, or kiss you, or lick you, or一" Harry let out a strangled cough. "And it's been in your body for
But not now, not like this. Not when Draco’s hands are on him, all over him. Then he talks without letting out a breath, filling up the spaces Draco has left empty.
"Just fine, thanks." Wilson hesitated, shifting his weight.
Draco woke for a short time to find himself sitting upright in the bathtub, water clouded with tomato sauce around his thighs, and one Harry Potter sitting between his knees. Draco smirked, got light headed, and nearly passed out again.
"Archie Wilson." Harry hit Draco's shoulder. "Git. Tell him to go home."
Draco rolls over Harry and settles between Harry’s legs. Draco pushes in close, as close as he can, and Harry’s knees fall open.
Jane stops too and looks back at them. “Who are you married to?”
Draco hummed before saying, "How's your wife? Anna?"
The Healer's office was bright, and blue, and cheerful.
A movement out of the corner of his eye brought his face up, and Draco saw Harry skid into the doorway of the kitchen, his eyes wide and panicked. Harry glanced down at the shattered porcelain, than at the puddled tea, and back up to Draco.
There is quiet in the moments and the space between them. A waiting quiet, a peaceful quiet. Harry sits in it, revels in it, the fact that they have it, before he speaks.
The windows, or doors rather, in Draco’s rooms led out to a small balcony. There was nothing on the balcony except for the sheer curtains blown in by the wind, and a grumpy Draco Malfoy, who had half a mind to drop a book on Harry Potter’s head from over the white painted railing.
“Why wouldn’t I?” Draco said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.
Draco leaped up, knocking Harry off him, and ran to the living room. He was so busy thinking about
“Also,” Harry added. “I do care. I care too much about things, my parents always say. It bothers me when people don't care about the things that belong to them.” Harry laughed and shifted his position so he was fully facing towards Draco. “I didn’t think you would care. Nature and nurture and all that. But you… it was so clear in your face how much you did care, how reverently you looked upon these flowers that I believed to be dear only to me.” Harry laughed again and tipped his head back. Draco’s stomach dropped through the ground, and he stared at Harry unabashedly. No one had ever spoken to him in this way. “And you knew these things that I didn’t know, and all you wanted was to share this with me, without even knowing anything about me.”
Smell disappeared slowly. One day Draco could vividly experience the crooks and crannies of London at lunch hour, and the next day the burnt coffee on the counter wasn't quite as strong, and then the next the morning paper didn't give off quite the same aroma. Again, Draco only truly realized when he was with Harry.
It was a sweater. A navy blue cashmere sweater. Draco smiled. A muscle somewhere close to his temple twitched uncomfortable. Draco held the smile.
Harry held the bag up and set it down on Draco's lap. Draco could not sit up on his own, so he let Harry carefully lift him and prop him against the back of the couch. Harry took the item out of the bag and held it up for Draco to see.
"I do not want to sing when you are not there to hear me," Draco says.
A wail sounded up through the apartment and Draco shoved his face into his pillow, groaning.
"No." Draco folded his hands carefully over the bulge of his stomach and gritted his teeth. "Can we - mph ow -
It began with a headache, a sore throat, an interrupted call.
Draco did not particularly like Harry's job because it sent him all over Europe, and Draco wanted Harry home. But they needed the money, so Harry worked, and Draco stayed at home and cried himself to sleep over a very large belly.
Scorpius grunted, but patted Draco's neck. "It's okay, Papa. Daddy needs them for Grandmum and Grandpa."
"Good conscience," Harry said faintly.
Harry shook his head, his hair tickling under Draco’s ear. “No, I do. I wouldn’t be able to stand the sad looks on their faces if I didn’t. Besides, they work hard on their homework, no matter how long it takes them. I don't want their hard work to go to waste.”
Draco turns to Harry, holding his hands and looking straight into his face. “I’m in love with you. So, so incredibly in love with you.” The calm look on his face dissolves, and Harry sees Draco, truly. “I don’t care if you want sex, or if you don’t. I don’t care that you drink cheap tea, and you don’t wipe the steam off the mirror when you shower, and that you never let me tidy your hair after your naps.”
But Bailey had stood there, waiting and watching, until Draco pulled the mug forward and took a small sip.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco’s eyes lighted over the stick in Harry’s hands and he froze. The door swung open freely, and Draco stood straight up, stock still, in the doorway.
On the day they went to the Burrow to tell the Weasleys they were pregnant, Mrs. Weasley had opened the door and nodded sideways to Draco before hugging Harry tightly, as she always did.
"We could be Malfoy-Potters," Harry said, looking hopeful and wide open. "Harry and Draco Malfoy-Potter."
"Yes, quite," Wilson said. He paused for a moment and Draco waited. "Are you sure you're doing alright?"
When Harry asked him to smell his new cologne, and Draco could barely make out his own. Or when Harry offered up a chocolate muffin he'd brought back from the Weasleys, and there was nothing about it that he could enjoy. Harry's favorite curry, the smell of the shampoo he'd been using since he was thirteen. All faint, all slipping away.
"I'm so sorry. I know it's been weeks since you saw him, but I just really don't一"
"No." Harry's hands on Draco's tightened painfully. "Draco, stop. You almost
Draco grunted.
The letters had been written before Draco had even gone off to boarding school, before he knew that he wasn’t supposed to like other boys, before he found out that it was better to manage attraction by removing the emotions from the whole endeavor. They had been written by a Draco who had believed that one day, someone would find him who was meant for him. Probably before he had scraped that little heart into his hip bone too. He must have written them when his handwriting was still stumbly and his spelling inadequate.
Harry lifted his head to glare at Draco. "Let me finish."
Draco gently pushed Harry to the side and took the bags himself. "Of course I'm not."
Maybe Harry gets the sense Draco doesn’t want to tell him what the words mean, for he says, “Well, I picked up a new book today. Teddy said-”
"Are you okay?" Harry asks into Draco's spine.
It was around this time that Draco recalled a moment from quite a few months back, when Bailey had first taken over for Robards. Bailey had brought Draco coffee. Draco thought about the bitter bite of coffee, and was sad because he’d never taste it again.
Draco shifted slightly underneath him. “You already asked me that, dear. Several months ago.”
“Hm,” said Draco. “So what did you need?”
"Yeah, so?"
"Yes, yes." Draco rolled his eyes. "Thank you. I'm already head over heels for the little thing, and I haven't even seen her face."
“Oh, no. Not at all,” Harry says. He lifts his head up and grins at Draco. “In fact, it may be a bit late if McGonagall has anything to do with it.”
Draco nodded. “Wonderful.”
He opened the door. “Good day, Daisy.”
“Dull?”
“It wasn’t your fault,” Draco said softly, angling his gaze out to the gentle waving of the lake. “I was acting silly.”
Harry shuffles his feet in the brown dirt.
Harry grinned at him and sat down at the kitchen stool next to him. "Well, who is it this morning? Wait, no. Let me guess. The Unspeakable interns."
"I love you," said Draco, pulling Harry to him with their baby nestled in between their bodies.
" Wilson looked wildly around the room, and then promptly ran out.
Draco disappears to spit out his toothpaste, and then returns, smelling of mint and citrus shampoo. He climbs up the bed and drops down beside Harry, curling an arm around his waist and pressing his nose in the back of his neck.
The friendly voice let out a garbled groan. "Merlin! He's brilliant, but a blunt-headed idiot sometimes!"
Draco sat back on his heels and pressed his palms into his eyes. "Oh Merlin," he said.
“Just fine.”
“Will you marry me?” Harry asked, staring at the rise and fall of Draco’s breathing.
"I don't want to die," Draco whispered, not waiting for Harry to ask. "I want to pretend for as long as I can that I'm not dying. Pretending includes not telling anyone."
"Hello, dears," Mrs. Weasley said, coming up behind Harry with little Molly bouncing in her arms.
“Don’t,” Draco finishes for him.
Harry helped him pull the sweater over his head and guide his arms through the sleeves. Draco looked down at himself, still half buried in the couch, and ran his hands down his front.
Draco snorted. “Who do you think I am?”
“Why?”
One, very harassed looking, Harry Potter stood in Draco's doorway with his hair sticking out instead of up, his jacket inside out, his shoes on the wrong feet, and dark circles under his eyes.
Draco pulls him tighter. His hands touch under the hem of Harry’s shirt.
Jane’s mouth opens a bit. “Er. Professor Potter?”
“I’m home!”
"Well!" said Draco.
The trousers were much the same. Tailored, breathable, and a perfect cut to accentuate the slimness of his waist next to the length of his legs. Daisy had also bought him suspenders, a few sturdy jackets, several sweaters for cool evenings, socks, and a leather bag.
“Yes,” Harry whispered, and leaned in closer. “He’s alive.”
Draco’s breath catches, Harry hears it. He doesn’t acknowledge it, but carries on with the speech he’s been whispering to his reflection for months, waiting to say it aloud for someone - for Draco - to hear.
"Right." Harry looked up at Draco. "Um. Can I..."
Harry scooted closer in the bath and set his hands on Draco's knees. "Will you marry me?"
Harry's silence was his response.
Harry shook his head hard, still facing away. "Nothing. I didn't mean anything."
Harry shrugged. He had never been one for words, and now, this was no different. There was nothing about sitting here under the overhang of a crag in the Rocky Mountains that had changed the way his brain worked. Even the mountains could not do that.
Even in the brightest moments, Harry finds his eyes searching out the curve of black ink over Draco's forearm, and the way anger rises up in his throat when Draco smirks. When they lie in bed, Harry runs a hand over Draco's chest - the scars - and lets the guilt drown him. He searches it out at every opportunity.
"Why ever not?" Harry said, grinning and turning to look at Draco.
"Alright then," Harry says. He runs his fingers through Draco's hair. "Have a sit on the couch for a moment, honey. I'll have everything ready in just a minute."
“Mister Draco.” She rapped on the door. Draco came quickly, marking his page in his book and shoving it down in a chair cushion.
Draco’s shaking his head, tears running hot down his face. “I... a car. Came out of nowhere... I couldn’t...” Draco chokes on his words and his face screws up tightly.
Draco sighed and tucked his feet in between the couch cushions. "Okay, no. I haven't told anyone."
Harry laughs so hard he gets marmalade in his hair.
"No magic," Scorpius said, trying to pull his hands back from Draco's.
Draco glares at him, and squeezes hard with his pinkie finger. “That’s extremely complicated magic.”
Draco nodded and stared down blankly at the parchment in front of him.
"Non-negotiable," Draco interrupted.
Draco murmured it, moved his lips to it.
Bailey waved his hands and strolled across Draco’s office before settling into the chair across from his desk. “No, no. That’s not why I’m here. I’ll leave that for Robards once he gets back from his leave.” Bailey folded his hands together and set them on his lap. “I wanted to ask if you needed any assistance on the Mortem case. I saw in our records that you’ve been working on it for seven months now, and I have plenty of Aurors to offer if you need extra hands.”
They watched television. Harry kissed the back of Draco's neck. Draco stuck a hand down Harry's pants, and they made love on the couch. Harry cried, and Draco tried to pretend like there wasn't a bottomless empty pit expanding outwards into his entire existence.
Their fight from the bathtub was forgotten. All the same, Draco could not forget that the last words he'd heard from Harry had been ones of lost disappointment.
"And is she beautiful?" Harry asked eagerly, clutching onto Draco's hand and leaning in close. "Does she have your eyes?"
"Harry?" Draco said quietly. "What do you mean?"
Draco nodded and placed his palm over Harry's cheek. "I'm okay. I'll be okay."
"Let me ask you something," Draco said, tilting his head to the side. "When you fucked me for the first time after we'd only been dating for two months, back in eighth year after seven firewhiskeys - yes, seven, I saw you drink them - were you thinking, 'Merlin, I can't wait to be a
Harry was still frozen. His face was blank, his chest numb.
Kit laughed and rolled her eyes, setting her cup down more gently than Draco had. “I didn’t want to interrupt your speech. It was clearly well thought out.”
Draco nods mutely, his eyes still flicking back and forth nervously.
Draco lifted Harry’s hand in his from over the pan of cooking meat and turned it back and forth, admiring the dull glint of gold on his ring finger. “Me too.”
Harry inhaled, held his breath, and then let it out in a noisy gust. “Why did you?” he asked, and then coughed. “Why were you acting like that? You seemed scared of me. Did I do something?”
The headache first, at nine in the morning, after Draco's morning tea.
Harry shook his head and jabbed Draco in the shoulder with his finger.
“A baby! Harry! We’re going to have a kid!”
Draco shook his head and scolded himself furiously. This whole pattern was becoming slightly frightening, what with the leaning out over the balcony every time Harry trotted by like a swooning maiden. Draco prided himself on
"The blacking out thing. The not waking up for four days thing. You scared the shit out of me." Harry leaned away from him a bit to place his forehead up against Draco's.
"Well, that's obvious." Draco almost rolled his eyes before remembering that that was rude to do to anyone who wasn't Harry. "Polyjuice Potion. Robards could have cleared Bailey before he left, and then someone could've taken Bailey's place after he took up the position."
“No,” Harry says.
"That's really what you were thinking?"
Harry heard the bang, cancelled the firecall, and ran to the living room. He found Draco, face down, sprawled, and covered in broken porcelain and spaghetti sauce. And so the call was interrupted, and the third part of Draco's impending illness was complete.
Then Harry - infinitesimally, barely noticeably, with the slightest movement - nodded his head.
"Wait." Draco held up a hand. "I'm not done." Draco let his hand fall back into the water, and it splashed dissipated soap up into Harry's face. "I apologize. I am, unfortunately, too selfish to let you go now." He looked at Harry, who was staring at him with red eyes and his mouth fallen open. "I want you to be with me when I go. I love you so much, and一Well. I want someone to hold my hand when it ends. I'm sorry."
Draco sighed heavily beside him, and Harry nudged his side.
Draco looked away from Harry's red face, the part of his lips, the wide green of his eyes. "It means that I don't want to shackle you down to me four months before I die. Then, when I do die, you not only have to grieve for a partner, but a husband too. Then you'll be a widower, and you'll be a widower for your entire life. And when you eventually go off to marry someone else, it will be your second marriage." Draco took a deep breath. Harry's hands dropped off his knees. "I don't want to be your
“Got it!” Harry said, grabbing his robes quickly and skidding down the hallway to throw them in the hamper.
, Draco tried to speak it back.
? You're the one that sent me a letter that said 'will fix you.' What in Morgana's name needed to be fixed about me?"
“Hm?”
" Harry's voice broke. A hand gripped onto Draco's shoulder and pulled hard, rolling him over onto his back. Draco peeked up at the crown of Harry's hair through the crusted slits of his eyelids, curls and tangles backlit by the dim yellow bathroom light. "You're burning up." There was a pause. "Oh god," Harry said. And then arms were sliding under Draco and struggling to lift him, and he was unsure of what exactly happened after that.
Draco breathed. He was still breathing.
"Don't you think?" Harry says.
Draco stopped smiling, and they made the pasta together in silence.
Draco pushes his nose into the side of Harry’s neck and pulls the belt out of Harry’s belt loops. He tucks his fingers under Harry’s waistband, and Harry lifts his arms to circle around Draco’s neck and shoves his hands into Draco’s hair.
It didn’t take long for Harry to get to the real reason he’d sought Draco out. “Look, Draco, I’m so sorry aboutー”
"Yes." Draco smiled. "She's a girl, and the Healers say she's fine and healthy."
Draco’s face was a deep red, and his eyes stood out bright and gray in contrast. “‘S a little uncomfortable, sitting like this.”
Draco looked at Harry over Hermione's bushy hair, and raised his eyebrows.
”Harry?” Draco said, whirling around to face him.
Mrs. Weasley had put her hand on his cheek, and smiled with watery eyes. "You can call me Mum, dear."
the Healer wrote in the air with his wand. His mouth was moving, so Draco assumed he was speaking aloud to Harry.
Harry runs a hand over Draco’s hair one more time before turning to the clusters of police and the second car - the one Draco must have hit - run headlong into the rails on the edge of the road. Harry swallows hard. God, but he hopes everyone is okay.
"It was easier than England," Draco says. He knows Harry as Harry knows him, simply from hating each other for seven years and counting. Draco laughs a little, his face red and his eyes wet still. "I should've known."
, whether or not the Healers divulged that to you."
Draco is silent for a long moment, and Harry thinks he is still standing in the doorway with the whispering wind behind him until the front door clicks shut and warm hands fall to Harry's waist. "I always want you there. You are why I go."
And then it was later, much later, with Draco on his back with his eyes closed and Harry curled around him, a hand on his stomach and his head under Draco’s chin.
Harry lets out a loud breath. “Draco,” his voice cracks. Harry swallows audibly. “Draco,” he says his name again.
"Dunno," Harry said. Draco pictured him scratching the back of his neck. "You'd have to ask him."
husband. I don't want you to have to enter the world as an
"I've finally done it," he said when he came through the front door, a grim set to his mouth.
. Of course he wanted to marry Harry. There was nothing more that he wanted than to marry Harry, and it seemed a joy to Draco to be able to die knowing that he'd had someone一had
He knew, without knowing how he knew, that this was the last time they would do this. That it needed to count.
Harry inhales, exhales, presses his chin tight to a knob of Draco's spinal chord. "Okay, my love. You don't have to do anything you don't want to."
“Okay,” he said. “Let’s go get married now.”
Harry dropped his forehead to Draco's, and smiled so big and happy that Draco thought his heart would burst open like the peeling swell of overripe raspberries. "Molly Potter," he whispered.
“Okay,” Harry says. Urgently, “Get out of the road, Draco. Get to the side, please.”
Harry flushed and patted Draco’s cheek. “Well. I’ll make tea.”
Draco tried to smile and nod. His headache and his throat were worse, but he didn't want to say. "Much better," he said.
Draco struggled to peel his eyelids open. He wanted to see Harry.
"Oh." Harry moved away from when he'd been heading to the cloak rack. "That sounds nice. I wouldn't have woken you so early if I'd known."
Draco readjusted the baby carrier strap and shifted his weight to his other leg. "It's ridiculous."
“Perfect, Potter.” Draco banged his head again. “I’m simply perfect.”
He finished work, glared at the interns, and walked out of the Unspeakable offices. Took the elevator, nodded to Bailey, who was filling in as head of the DMLE while Robards was on leave, and left the Ministry. He apparated home, and then stood on the front step outside his and Harry's apartment, and tried to imagine how he would explain to Harry that he didn't feel like going out to the pub with Ronald tonight after all.
He took the paper from Harry, crumpled it up, and threw it across the room. It landed less than two feet away from where they were sitting together on the couch. Harry, in good spirit, levitated the letter into the fire.
Draco lay there, caked in drying sweat, blood drying between his thighs, and no baby in his arms. He wanted to see the baby, he did. Only, he was nineteen, and he was here
"What?" Harry asked. A hand came up to hold onto the back of Draco's hair. "What is it? Did I do something wrong? You don't want to right now? Are you okay?" Harry inhaled sharply. "Draco, say something."
"Yeah?”
“Professor Potter?”
Harry stands, already running to the coat rack to grab his jacket off the hook and snatch the keys from the dish by the front door. “Draco. What happened? Are you hurt? Where are you?”
Harry took in Draco hunched over his stomach and the table, bent down to stay close to Harry.
He pulled the ring he’d bought for their wedding out of the back of the drawer, still in the little box the salesperson had put it in. He held it out for Draco to take, but Draco pushed it away.
"That's nice."
Draco pressed his lips together. “Okay.”
Harry shook his head blindly. “You’re so wonderful. Sometimes it hits me how….”
"Earl grey?"
Draco kept his eyes down. “Hello, Potter.”
Draco nods and nods at Harry's whispers, but he doesn't stop shaking and his eyes move around the room without ever settling or landing on Harry.
Harry made spaghetti, Draco's favorite, and wobbled both plates between his hands as he took them back to the couch, where Draco still lay. Draco would've gotten up and helped make the garlic bread, but he honestly hadn't had the energy to get off the couch, and Harry had insisted that they could live without garlic bread for one night.
“Good morning,” said Draco.
With a month and a half left to go, the Healers put him in a wheelchair. Draco tried to protest, raising his voice without knowing and flapping his arms wildly, but then he fell off the examination table, and the Healers got their way.
"Do you even love me?" Draco says, out of nowhere. "This whole trip, you've been acting like you're in pain. Why are you with me here if you still hate me?"
“I’m right here,” Draco whispered. He ran his hand down Harry’s chest, his stomach, thigh, before skimming his hand back up, and running it right back down again.
Harry abandons the hollow of Draco’s throat, and brings his face up to Draco’s.
the damn coffee before he goes off to give it someone else."
"Mornin', Draco," said Wilson when Draco walked into the Unspeakable's department.
Harry glances up from his knees. Draco is nodding, his eyebrows drawn together in the middle, and his hands still holding firm to Harry’s.
spread out in front of him on a table, minding his own business, when the door banged open to reveal the portly figure of Tom Bailey. Draco hardly looked up until a mug was set down in front of him, a little too hard to be considered friendly.
Draco’s smile faded a little. “How what?”
Wilson turned to leave, but then turned back. He hesitated before saying, “Have you and Harry gotten married?”
(I just barely made it on time for this one phew. This is a lesson for me to stop procrastinating things)
"Do you think," Harry said, after they were both dressed and tucked into bed, "that Robards will let me quit the Aurors?"
They sat outside of the courthouse until morning, and Harry held onto Draco tightly where he sat on his lap, half asleep and still smiling. When the officiant arrived, looking startled and alarmed, they followed at his heels through the doors and around the building until he stood them both at the front of the city hall and agreed to marry them.
"Right. Robards set it all up before he even left," Wilson said. "That's what I'm confused about. Robards knowingly, in advance, put someone in his position. How could someone have tricked Robards into handing over the DMLE for six months?"
Draco hummed before reaching over to turn the stove off and giving the sauce a few more stirs. “I don't mind.” He half turned around to peck Harry on the lips. “It means he’s alive.”
Harry laughed again, louder, and Draco absorbed the sound in Harry’s belly through his fingertips.
When Harry tapped his shoulder, hard so Draco could feel it, and signed to him that he was going out, Draco would reach out to hold his hand and squeeze tightly to say,
Harry twisted around in the armchair to look at Draco. "Draco."
"I sent him the letters! Why didn't he do anything about it?"
"I'm so sorry," Harry said frantically, stumbling forward into the room and letting the door fall shut behind him. "I'm so sorry. I missed it."
"Ah."
"Molly Malfoy," Draco sneered. "It's horrid. We can change it."
Draco pulled Harry's leg closer to him, and let the subject drop. He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
“You’re a country boy, now,” Daisy said, stepping back to look at him and looking terribly pleased with herself.
Draco shrugged. "Why do you think? Because you'd just had seven firewhiskeys, and - little did I know at the time - I was about to get pregnant in my eighth year of school. It never quite seemed the time to say, 'oh, Harry. I understand we've only been dating for two months, and the drunken-shag-baby is really putting a damper on our plans, but I've wanted to marry you since we were fourteen years old.'" Draco smiled at the cashier and waved genially at her as they left the market.
"Thank you, Mrs. Weasley," Draco had said when she first made him onion soup. By then, Draco had a turnip sized baby inside of him, and it wasn't noticeable that he was pregnant unless you already knew.
For one, he was grateful that it hadn’t been something worse. He couldn’t clearly remember all of the slight disobediences he had carried out in his younger years. Draco thought the worst he had done was hide an unfavorable dinner in his napkin before throwing it out, but who was to say if he had somehow got ahold of a magazine with nude male models? Pansy had rather liked those in their fourth year, and there was no knowing for sure if Draco had mysteriously gotten his hands on one of them for his own personal intrigue.
Harry stopped suddenly, and took a step back from Draco. His mouth opened again, but he quickly shut it. Harry's eyes flicked from Draco, to the broken mug, the walls around them, up at the ceiling, and back down to Draco.
Harry had the kindness, or perhaps the common sense, not to argue with Draco on this. Draco dropped his head down on Harry's shoulder in thanks, and Harry ended up washing his hair, and his skin, and his face (with the fancy face wash, Draco demanded, not the bar soap for heaven's sake). He pulled him out of the bath by the armpits and wound him up in four separate freshly laundered towels. Draco smiled at him, gripped Harry's waist, dropped his forehead into the stretch and turn of Harry's neck, brushed his lips across his throat and whispered a dozen words of nothing to him.
Harry lifted a hand up to Draco's cheek and sighed. "I'm scared about you."
"Jesus is a Muggle Biblical figure," Harry said.
The next day brought a reprieve in Daisy.
"Hey," Harry murmured. "Head down, between your knees."
Draco sighed and set a hand gently on Harry's arm. "Darling, it's really nothing. I had a crush on you throughout school. Yes, I was an asshole and a bigot. That didn't cancel out the existence of my feelings. You honestly have no idea how lucky I felt when you actually wanted to go out with me in eighth year."
"I know." Draco shrugged and smiled. He pushed himself up out of his chair and walked over to Harry, slinging his hands over his hips and pulling him in. "I wanted to get up with you."
Draco swallowed down air and stared at Harry, the frantic jerks of his movement, the skittering pattern of his mouth. He tried not to cry, tried to keep his breathing even. He had no idea what sounds he was making, if any. All he knew was that he was standing in his kitchen with burning liquid dripping down his legs and Harry talking at him, and he couldn't feel anything.
He didn't realize at first. He figured it was the anxiety over work that made his lunch so bland, the stress from knowing he was dying that dulled his morning coffee.
Draco sits halfway up to reach Harry and wastes no time in pulling Harry’s shirt over his head and tossing it to the side. The buckle of his belt comes next, then the button of his trousers.
Wilson gestured at him to continue. "What does it mean?"
Draco laughed again. “I know, dear.”
He was kissing Harry, and thinking about how he smelled of fresh laundry and bergamot, when he leaned down to bite under Harry's jaw. It wasn't the snip of teeth that warned him, but the lick that came after. Nothing.
Hopefully the next one won't take so long...
No, Draco hadn’t done such a thing, Draco was sure of it. He would remember it if he had.
"Really?" Harry dropped his hand, and Draco reached forward to take it up again immediately. "You'll go to bed?"
"Yes," Harry said. Before Draco could protest, Harry said, "I know you don't want to involve anyone else in this. But I think, at this point, you can't deny that Ron and Hermione care about you at least a little bit."
, Draco mouthed, and smiled.
Draco stared. "Are you asking what I think you're asking?"
“No,” Harry said. He leaned in closer to bury the awareness of his senses away from anything else. “I mean to elope. Would you go and marry me this very second?” He paused before finishing his thought. A thought that hadn’t occurred to him until this moment, but seemed inexplicably as if it should have been there all along. “I don't mean theoretically. I mean, will you go with me right now, and marry me.”
In fact, nothing felt real anymore. Draco simply floated in the abyss of nothing and waited for the hand of beyond nothing that would drag him through the last barrier.
Harry breathes a bit. Draco’s alive. There’s no metal sticking out of his stomach. The paramedics are going to check him out, if they haven’t already. And he’s going to be okay.
Harry does not know why he does it. Why he insists on running from the little house into the night with his mouth wide open and his unbuttoned shirt flying out behind him. He tries to race the wind, all the way to the cliff, and skids to a stop, nearly flying off the edge of it. Harry wonders, when the door slams behind Draco's heels, if Draco screams as he runs. If he is waiting for someone to hear him over the water.
The classes were boring at best, dreadful at mild, and death-inspiring at best. Draco almost wrote that one down for Harry to make him laugh, but he didn't think Harry would like it very much, all things considered, so he kept it to himself. Despite the boredom of the sign language classes, Draco couldn't deny that it was incredibly helpful to have a very small way to say
“So you’ve performed
Draco closed his mouth and watched as Harry came toward him.
“Well,” she said. “It is certainly a fascinating subject. One I haven’t delved into myself, but I am interested to hear about it.”
Mrs. Weasley had gasped and looked, really
Harry shrugs. “No reason at all.”
“Merlin,” Harry says, dropping down onto the bed and spreading his arms out wide.
“I’m so glad you’re okay,” Harry says, his voice breaking. He leans his face close to Draco’s and sets his chin down on Draco’s shoulder. “So glad.”
“No harm done,” Harry repeated, and took Draco’s hand.
His breath huffing out, blowing tufts of Harry’s hair back in loose gusts. His hips pushing up to meet Harry’s. His stomach rising to press into Harry’s. His collarbone shifting under Harry’s mouth when he sighs. His shoulders falling away from his ears.
"Molly's legally a Malfoy," Harry pointed out.
The next words Harry's lips formed were perfectly clear to read.
Harry smiled and dropped his head down into the crook of Draco's neck. "I know, love. I'm just saying that it's Muggle tradition."
”Okay,” Draco said to himself. He turned sharply to face the stack of files, and raised his arms out in front of him, wand gripped tightly in his right.
"It wasn't the Healers," Harry said.
," Harry said. His eyes didn't meet Draco's. “Well, Hermione figured it out first, of course. But your assigned Healers confirmed it.”
"Don't call me baby. You only call me baby when you have to go on long distance missions," Draco huffed. He folded his arms over his chest. "And I went to Mungo's before and they said I had a cold."
He leans back against his desk and watches the scramble of students trying to pair off with their friends. He smiles and shakes his head. Every day is the same. Gloriously, marvelously, wonderfully the same.
“Mm.”
Draco leaned over and ran his hand over Harry's forehead, pushing waves of his hair back.
"Harry. Azkaban."
Harry wouldn't look at him. "A couple weeks," he said. "I know this isn't my thing. You're the one who's sick, and I have no reason to complain or pretend I'm suffering just as much as you are一"
, it read.
“Yes?” Harry asks pleasantly.
.” Draco tilts his head and looks at Harry so earnestly and sweetly, that all of Harry’s thoughts and doubts tumble down him and away in dizzying cascades. “I love you.”
Draco banged his head down onto the ground. There was no mercy for him in this world.
Draco turned his head into Harry’s with a wide smile on his face. “Hullo. How was work today?”
This is absolutely a self indulgent fic, and I am loving it (in case you were wondering).
Draco sat then, staring down at the halves of lemon in his hands. One of them was squeezed out, the juice swirling and stinging in the bath. The other laid in his hand, warm from his palm, and the juice welling up between the wedges.
he mouths. Harry shakes his head. He has no idea.
“Perfect,” Kit said with a wide smile.
"Will you marry me?" Harry asked.
"Bailey only has to oversee the paperwork, which means he knows about every case going in and out of the DMLE and Department of Mysteries. The two departments are so closely linked that whatever goes to the Aurors has definitely touched the Department of Mysteries, and vice versa." Draco paused. "Bailey came into my office once to ask about the Mortem case."
Draco waved him off. “It’s honestly the least I could do. And I might also add that Harry instructed I pay for all your coffee for the next two years.”
“I hit someone,” he’s gasping over and over again.
Updates will be every Saturday :)
“She’s a sixth year already,” Harry says to the wall. “Isn’t this a bit odd?”
“I want to trail my fingers down your stomach, and bury my face in your neck, and hold onto your hips. I want to kiss your thighs, the small of your back, the inside of your arm, the palms of your hands. I want to do those things to you, and I want you to do them to me.” Harry pauses. He’s never said anything like this, so blatant, so loud, so clear.
“I love it.” Harry’s voice crackles over the phone, and Draco closes his eyes.
“So they share feelings?” Jane asks.
Harry does not sleep. He listens to the roaring crashes of the ocean against sand and shore and stone, and wishes desperately to be absolved from the ache in his chest.
Harry put a formal permanent resignation into the Aurors a week later.
"Okay," Harry said. He took Draco's hand and tugged him toward the door. "Let's go back to bed."
They were still lying on the ground and Draco could feel the hardwoods clearly under his back. Harry didn't seem to notice. And Draco, sprawled on the floor with Harry’s body draped across him and his coworker standing hesitantly off to the side, was so relieved that he could feel anything that he didn't even bother to complain about it.
“You said my-” Draco gasps and moves his hands to Harry’s hips. “-my name.”
Daisy bent over and unfolded the brown paper of the closest package. From it, she pulled out a bundle of ivory fabric. Draco squinted at it, but it was indecipherable until Daisy shook it out to reveal numerous creamy shirts, folded together haphazardly. Draco picked one up by the sleeve and held it out in front of him.
Daisy nodded. “Yes. Thank your father. He paid for all of these.” She gestured at the neatly folded clothes in front of him.
“What happened?”
Draco nodded out to the sunshine and flowers. “Lemon trees symbolize adoration and commitment. Lemon blossoms are the symbol of discretion.”
“Oh, Draco,” Harry says, pulling him close again. He puts one hand carefully in between his shoulder blades and the other on the back of his head, stroking through sweaty strands of Draco’s hair. He's alive, he's alive. That's all that matters. “It’s okay, honey. Take a deep breath.”
he wanted to say.
There was a pause before Kit answered. “I did not.”
Draco huffed. "You'd get caught, and blow our cover!"
“Yes.” Draco spun around in his chair. “Where is the revenge, the dirty grudge? The complex and diluted motivation?”
"Yes?"
Draco shook his head, but let himself smile. "But I want it to be special. It's our wedding, it should be special."
On second thought, Draco didn’t miss the taste of coffee. It was disgusting.
“Harry,” Draco says, his voice untethered and hushed.
Another voice. "Harry, he's going to be alright."
"Thanks, Buchanan."
"Er," said Harry. "I guess we can be Potters."
"Poor baby," Draco murmured to her, bouncing her as he walked over to the window in her nursery. Draco glanced out at the night, the lights of London glittering quietly back at him. Draco cradled Molly close to his chest and hummed to her. It didn't take long for her crying to quiet. Draco popped a passie into her mouth, rubbed his thumb over her head, and rocked his weight back and forth until her wails turned into whimpers, then little murmurs of idle sound as she fell back to sleep.
"Or you're sick," Harry supplied.
"Oh." Draco pulled back a little. Trying to look into Harry's face from less than a centimeter away was making him dizzy. "You're scared to go on missions?"
“Oh, yes?”
Wilson stood in his office doorway. “Hornby went after you because you were the closest to figuring the case out.”
Draco ignored him. Adam Hornby, in the depths of the Department of Mysteries interrogation rooms, was no longer his concern. “Give out lots of detentions today.”
Draco set the plates on the coffee table, careful. His hands shook a little. He swung his legs over the side of the couch, stood, looked around the room, and promptly blacked out.
“Quite,” Harry says.
Harry blinked at him for a long moment before settling a hand on Draco’s head. His fingertips rubbed idly through Draco’s hair. “I suppose so.”
Draco walked slowly around his desk and pulled his chair out. All his files were still stacked neatly where he’d left them the day before, his mug set out with dregs of earl grey tea. Nothing seemed out of place.
“Beautiful,” Harry mumbles into Draco’s mouth, and runs a hand through his hair. “So beautiful. Love you
“Yes,” she says, looking rather pleased with herself with her chin all drawn up. “The book says that the enchantment provides a binding connection to the user’s true love. One that doesn’t break until death.”
Draco rolled a little so he was lying face to face with Harry, their hands curled together. “Of course I still want to marry you now.”
“But you are.”
Wilson straightened. "Oh my. Are you doing better?"
Draco ditched the Manor clothes he’d been wearing earlier that day and put on some of the new clothes Daisy brought. Cream shirt, tapered trousers, suspenders, his treasured Oxfords he’d worn on the train.
“That will be all for today,” Harry says. “You can have the rest of the period to work.”
"I was thinking we could hyphenate our names."
Oh, well. Draco decided this was as good a time as any to go down to the lemon trove. Now that Harry was back, his flowered clearing and the library were both limited hiding options, as Harry knew to find Draco there. As far as Draco knew, no one but him was aware of the lemon trove, and if they were, they didn’t know Draco had taken it up as his most recent hiding place.
"Harry," he mumbled, reaching his hand out blindly for Harry's body next to his. "Baby s'up."
Daisy dumped the rest of the parcels down unceremoniously and stepped back with her hands on her hips. “Good.” She waved Draco over and then took him by the shoulders and moved him to the center of the room. “Now I’ll have you try them on, and I’ll make sure all the measurements fit right. If something isn’t just right, I’ll take some thread to it and fix it up for you.”
However, Draco had stopped working on the case files Harry brought home, and he had no idea who T.A. was, so he ignored it in favor of spending his hours alternating between reading Muggle true crime novels and napping.
Wilson glared down at him with his hands on his hips and his cheeks ruddy with frustration. "What is wrong with you?"
When the bath is full of hot water, Harry takes Draco's hand up again and leads him to the edge of the tub. Harry nudges him forward until Draco steps into the water and stands there.
It is then that Draco sings. In the dark, against the water, in tandem with the open air. Harry is not even sure how he knows Draco is singing. It is something deep under his ribs that tells him, that sings back.
Harry shook his head and looked out over the valleys and crests of green, gray, and brown.
“Because I love you,” Draco says happily before sending a stinging jinx in the direction of Harry’s backside. “Very, very much.”
They turned around and walked back towards the entrance to the cemetery. Draco felt Scorpius lift his head, and knew he was staring at James and Lily's grave behind him. Draco had to put conscious effort into not squeezing Scorpius too hard.
"I sent him letters! Didn't he read them?"
, darling."
“I will not.”
On the paper were four words.
“Harry,” Draco gasped into his mouth, his breath sweet and stained with tomatoes.
Draco's eyes search his, waiting for Harry to see the answer in his own. "I am singing, and the ocean is singing with me," Draco says. "But it is for you. I am always singing to you."
There was silence between them for a long time, where Draco looked out over the trees and Harry looked at Draco.
“I’m still sorry about it.”
Draco sighed. "He always says that, but he really just wants to see you."
Draco didn't follow, not for a long time. He knew, after years of life with Harry, when to follow and when to give him space.
He thought he might choke on the thought. But, Merlin, he was so alone.
Harry withdraws one of his hands from Draco's chest to run it over his shoulder and down the length of his ribs to just above the dimples in his back, under the water. "Draco, honey. This is hard now, but you'll get back behind the wheel. All of this fear will fade with time, and-"
When they get back to their apartment, all of Draco's limbs lock up and Harry has to slowly ease him out of the car and up the stairs.
If someone were to ask Draco, he would say that Harry is quiet. He doesn’t speak when he reads, cooks, pretends to knit, kisses, watches the telly. He watches and he listens and he lets Draco do the talking.
“You’re completely oblivious to it,” Draco is saying to Harry. “He has an excellent aptitude for Potions. He’s very talented, really.”
When he approaches the police, he sees they’re helping someone out of the second car. It’s a kid.
He would not have imagined being engaged to Draco Malfoy, settled in the greening folds of Scotland, with a job as a professor at Hogwarts, and his first baby - a son - on the way.
I would've told you."
Draco took him by the hand and led him to their room. Harry followed blindly, unable to pull his attention away from Draco’s glowing face until they were falling back into white sheets and a nest of duvet and pillows. And from there, it was Draco’s stomach, and his legs, and the divet between his shoulder blades, and the dimples etched under his waist, and the skin under his ear, and the press of his jaw into Harry’s clavicle.
Harry snorted and leaned over to peck Draco on the lips. "You make me laugh, darling."
“You’re deflecting,” Harry said, but he was grinning into Draco’s cheek and his breathing eased.
“I’m listening,” Draco says. “I want to know.”
Harry shook his head. "I feel like we have a lot to unpack here."
Wilson smiled. "Very well, thank you. How's Harry?"
“Just Draco.”
“The kids behaved?” Draco asked, turning back to stir the tomato sauce over the stove.
Draco set his head carefully back down on Harry’s shoulder. “Right. Should we talk about that?”
“Right then,” she says, and runs off.
Draco grinned and followed Harry into the kitchen. "What does?"
Harry kissed the place Draco's thumb met his wrist before handing him his plate, nearly tipping over with the weight of pasta, and going to the next room to reschedule pub night with Ron.
Draco paused and turned to look at Harry in the middle of the market parking lot. "What is it?"
Harry pushes at him. “I know I am. Thank Merlin for it.”
Jane’s cheeks go red. “Well, what does the spell do anyways?” she says, crossing her arms and huffing.
Draco left the Ministry with his wand held high, the boxes trailing behind him, and the increasing sense that an end was fast approaching.
“You are perfect
Harry doesn’t pause, just scoops Draco up into a hug.
"Okay," Draco croaks out and stumbles over onto the cushions.
Draco nodded in affirmation. “Yes.”
“Really?” Harry said, half sitting up. “You really will?”
Wilson nodded. “That’s very nice.”
Draco said, “It’s alright.” Draco sighed and looked down at his hands, muddied up in the roots of dandelions. His anger at his father drifted away, not forgotten, but no longer at the forefront of his attention. “The burns weren’t too bad anyways. Wide, but not deep.”
Harry looked up at Draco and let the smile grow over his face. “Yes,” he said. “Yes, please.”
"Yes, of course," the Healer said quietly, before taking the handles of the chair and wheeling Draco into a private room. "The head Healer will be right in."
“Will you tell me what it means?” Harry asks, quiet.
Harry smiled, his eyes glassy and ringed with red and heavy dark circles. There was a slight choking sound, and then Harry lurched forward on top of Draco.
Draco comes padding in to the bathroom after Harry's hung up with Pansy, half his hair stuck to his face and the other half spiked up in the back. "Bath?" he asks, his voice rough.
Draco and Wilson both looked to him.
Draco pushed Harry's shoulder, not hard enough to make him wobble, and turned bright red. "Just hold the baby when they come back with her."
"What is it?" Harry asked again.
Draco’s head swiveled around to see Harry Potter standing at the edge of the cove, wringing his hands together.
The baby had not been his idea. Well, the baby had not being either his or Harry's idea, but it had been Harry's idea to keep it and try to raise it. Draco said they were too young. Harry said that Draco was it for him, that he wanted to have a family with him, that this wasn't how he imagined it, but they could do it all the same. So Draco had said yes, let's keep the baby, and they had. And it was fine.
Draco pretended to look confused. “No. Why?”
"Some curse." Harry dropped his chin back and stared up at the ceiling, his breath coming out too hard and fast. "Hermione said it means 'the loss is slow.'" Harry slowly lowered his gaze to look at Draco. "They were waiting for you to wake up to tell them if you got cursed in the past four months." Harry shook his head. "I told them you would've told me if something had happened to you, or if you'd gotten hit by an unknown curse, but they didn't believe me. I mean you would've told me, right?"
"-passing the baby all around," Mrs. Weasley was saying, gently stroking Molly's arm, who was giggling up at her and reaching out to tug on Mrs. Weasley's silvering red curls. "Percy kept saying you'd want her back before she got lost among all the other Weasley babies being handed off, but you know him." Mrs. Weasley sighed and looked down to coo at Molly. "Babies make him uncomfortable, don't they? Even pretty ones like you!"
In the remote desperation of it all, he spoke. Words, phrases, sentences that meant nothing but the touch of his own lips together. Things he wished he'd told his mother, pieces of the Mortem case he'd never written down, a recipe Ronald had given to Draco nearly four years ago, song lyrics to a lullaby Draco knew as a child, all the important things he wished Harry to know. Draco thought,
Draco snorted. “I should think not.”
But not now.
Harry is still choking on his breath. “Er. Yes. Miss Wimblefon, can we resume this conversation at a later time?”
Sound did not give Draco the grace of a slow departure.
"No one?"
They have no choice but to walk.
“I’m sorry,” Harry mumbled. His hands dropped, but quickly began twisting through the dandelions like Draco’s were. Draco noted the movement, but tried to ignore the implications of Harry’s mirrored actions.
Draco shifted his eyes from Molly to the window, to the glittering night. "What were you thinking?"
"Stop. Look at me."
Thankfully, he did no such thing. Instead, he simply stood on the balcony and glared down at the top of Harry Potter’s inky head, sun reflecting off of his dark curls and the breeze lifting the fringe off his forehead in such a way that Draco rather wished Harry Potter would shave his whole head bald.
Draco shook his head. "We need to get this all sorted and filed. Figure out why he gave
"You're lucky the plates didn't cut you," Harry said, scraping idly at a tomato stain in Draco's skin, reading Draco's mind.
“Morning, Malfoy,” Bailey said, and sat down beside Draco. Draco shifted uncomfortably, but didn’t move away. “Got you a coffee.”
A month later, Draco lost his sense of taste.
Draco pulled back and rubbed his fingers over Harry's neck. Harry turned his head to the side and smiled lazily up at Draco.
“Draco? Are you alright?” A voice called up.
In some ways, though, this was worse. Because Draco couldn’t pretend these were old obsessions; they were clearly ones that had penetrated the present. Therefore, it would be more difficult to play it off as something unimportant.
"-and there's no one here to find us, much less blow our cover." Harry rolled his eyes. "You know Robards just sent us out here on a technicality."
Harry shook his head. His cheeks were ruddy and his eyes squinted tight. "No, it's not your fault at all. You're the one who's sick, and it's your decision. It's no burden to me at all."
Red welts rose up from his skin, marking from the middle of his chest down to the tops of his hip bones. Draco sunk down lower into the hot water and stared at himself. It would go away, Daisy had assured him. The bruises from the falling pots would too. And they didn’t even hurt so much, not now. The burns needled at the surface of his flesh under the bathwater, but the worst of it was over.
Bailey nodded, and his features spread in a wide smile. “Yes, here you are.”
"Blaming yourself."
"Yes," said Draco, and continued. "It is important to me that, after all this, you move on. Spend time with your friends, find another job, date some new people. I want you to get married, and have kids, and grow old with someone."
Draco patted Wilson's shoulder. "Perfectly Harry."
“Good night,” Harry sighs.
Harry sighs and waves his hand. “Ask away.”
Sometime around the arrival of Wilson’s letter, Draco’s throat started burning. Not the general coarse scratching of a sore throat, but a true, infernal fire working its way up Draco’s throat.
Draco looked up from the couch, buried under sheets they'd pulled off their bed.
Draco smiled up at him, took a sip of his tea, stood to put his robes on, and then walked out the door.
Often times, a deep pit would twist in Draco's stomach, and he would have to step away from Harry for a moment. As much as he loved these moments, uninterrupted stretches of time with Harry, the guilt was unavoidable. Harry was supposed to be happy, in his prime, preparing to be a professor at Hogwarts, and instead he was dragging Draco around in a wheelchair to entertain him until his death. Draco couldn't help but feel as if he was holding Harry back from his life.
Harry's grip on Draco's elbow tightened hard. It might've hurt under different circumstances, but Draco hardly noticed now.
and the
Draco shook his head. "No you don't. You don't want to be a Malfoy."
Until, one day, the burning grew to be so painful that Draco simply stopped talking altogether.
Draco shut the door behind carefully and hung his bag on the hook nailed in to the wall. “Here I am.”
"Well, you can't," Draco said. "I'll be dead."
“Is she okay?” Harry asks. “Was anyone else in the car?”
Harry hugged Draco, too tight to breathe. Carried him around the house so Draco didn't have to sit rigidly in the wheelchair. Tried to feed Draco, although Draco closed his mouth firm against it. Kissed Draco all the time. Draco liked that. These were the few things he was aware of outside of the abiding pain.
"You know," said Draco, dragging Harry closer. "I think I would really appreciate some company."
Draco groans and fists his hands into the sheets.
Harry blinked. "Why didn't you ever tell me?"
All the same, Draco made sure to pack lunches for Harry when he left to work on weekends, kissed him a little softer than was strictly necessary in the mornings, and tried not to wake him when Molly rose several times a night.
Later, when they were sat on opposite ends of the bath with their legs twined together and a mountains of bubbles between them, Draco apologized.
The Healer twirled his wand between his fingers nervously.
They are both fully, mostly, dressed. But every one of Draco’s nerves is alight where Harry’s body leans up into him, everywhere Harry grips tighter onto his hair, his arms, the folds of his clothes.
Draco went home from Mungo's on a Tuesday.
"Are you ready, love?"
She twirls a curl of hair around her finger and smiles up at him. “I had a question for you. About the assignment.”
Draco, in all of the new sweet goodness that Harry has found in him, lifts one of Harry’s hands to his mouth and kisses it.
Wilson shrugged and waved his hand. "Oh, no. Just wanted to say hello. How are you doing?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Not even your father?"
But instead of moving forward to sit down across from Draco, he walked around the table and kneeled down by Draco’s chair and set his hand on his thigh. He sat there, staring up at Draco like a pious man wouldn’t dare to look up to God. Draco looked down at him questioningly, still smiling.
Draco blows out a hard laugh. “Good pay, indeed.”
Draco stares at him. “You don’t like it?”
"Nope," said Draco.
And then, without quite noticing when exactly it had happened, it was gone.
"No," Draco says. His voice is tight and hoarse. "I don't think so."
. Years! Merlin knows why I didn't ask ten years ago when I should have! But一" Harry's lip trembled. Draco did not point out that they were only just getting together ten years ago. "I've lost a decade that I could've been married to you, and I do not want一in six months一to look back and regret that I never took the chance. That I never just asked you. That I was never married to you. I won't be able to stand it."
Draco held onto them for most of the day, walking back and forth through the trees, and holding so many of the yellow treasures that his fingers ached and cramped up. He walked back to the house with them when the sky began to grow darker, and dropped some off in the kitchen for Roy, and then took the others up to his rooms with him.
"I- Yes. Pansy gave them to me."
"When can I start making death jokes then?"
Someone coughed nearby. Draco looked up and saw the supermarket cashier glaring pointedly at them. "Next."
“Once.” Harry exhaled. The lake lapped gently a couple feet away from their shoes. “I don't mean this as offense to you, but he doesn't care. Not about anything, except for maybe how much money his horses will make.”
Wilson stared for a moment before he gasped, both his hands coming up to grip his hair. "
“Why?” Draco asked, trying in vain to keep his voice polite instead of suspicious.
He dropped his weight back down Harry, his knees on either side of Harry's hips, and pressed his nose into the side of Harry's face where his hair swarmed over his ear.
"Figure it out, darling?" Harry said absently from the armchair.
“I would be happy to go with you,” she said, “if you really were interested in going.”
After the past couple months, Harry deserved the extra sleep. The stress of moving into a bigger apartment so Molly could have a room, adjusting to his new job, caring for a new baby, and planning a wedding, all while dealing with the never ending torrent of Prophet articles about Draco and Molly had left Harry in sleepless cycles of dark circles and red rimmed eyes. Every time Draco mentioned it to him, Harry would smile tiredly and lean into Draco.
Neither of them spoke.
Harry stops. “What do you mean with whom?”
“Spaghetti?” he said, lifting up his fork.
"I'm sorry," Draco whispered. "Of course we'll tell Ron."
truly in love, and I have the strong suspicion that you are not.”
Draco smiled, took Harry's hand, and apparated them back home.
“That I did,” Daisy said. She smiled before bustling out of the room, the clothes that needed altering thrown over her arm.
“Bless you,” Harry says, linking his pinkie into Draco’s.
Harry pulled Draco tight to himself and kissed him hard and said,
"Mail for you."
Bailey pushed the mug closer to Draco. “I overheard the interns complaining about how you never take the coffee they make.”
“Like what?”
As for the letters and photographs, Draco could remember those quite clearly.
"And Harry?"
I'm thinking I'll write a little bit more for this, so stay tuned :)
“Harry?” Draco’s breath is coming fast and sharp over the phone, and his voice is high with panic.
His hands rose up the outsides of Draco’s thighs, bunching up the fabric of his pajama pants. Up his sides, bumping over his ribs, and then smoothing down his arms. Gathered adoringly over his stomach and the baby somewhere in there.
"I explicitly told him that Mortem and
“Yes, oh,” Draco snaps. “Merlin and Arthur, these children get dimmer every year.
Draco huffed out a breath. "They do everything wrong. Everything from putting too much cream in the coffee to telling the Aurors we're raiding the old Lestrange estate on Saturday."
Draco opened his eyes.
Draco turned bright red. "Don't say that in public."
"I am very, very murderous," Draco said, glaring down into his earl grey tea. "Very. Did I mention how murderous I am?"
