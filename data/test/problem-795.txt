of it in his hand right in a way his new wand never had been. Green sparks flew out of the tip the instant he touched it.
As he nears them a bell goes off inside the castle signalling the end of the lesson and he sees a large group of mixed Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors coming out of greenhouse three. He’d never been terribly close to Professor Sprout but he thinks he may as well say hello while he’s here.
Something that felt as large as a rock seemed to lodge itself in Draco’s throat and tears prickled at his eyes. He wondered vaguely whether seeing his father dead might not have been less painful than this.
He watched, enthralled, as the sink dropped out of sight and left in its wake a hole that opened up on a dark tunnel leading Merlin knew where. Looking over, Draco saw a complicated expression on Potter’s face. His cheeks had filled with colour.
Also, he had the Dark Mark. And after an incident right at the beginning of term where some seventh-year Slytherin boys had held him down and torn back the sleeve of his robes to expose it, no one wanted much to do with him or his perennial mark of servitude.
This morning, Harry doesn’t wake up until Draco kisses him. It’s a soft brush of lips, a delicate gesture that exists only within the confines of their bed.
Cho, Harry,” Hermione said flatly, and to his astonishment, there was an underlying tone of amusement in her voice. “I don’t think I have to tell you that, for one thing, I have nothing but bad feelings towards Malfoy. I'm extraordinarily sympathetic to his situation, of course, but that doesn’t change how I feel. I couldn’t
Draco was glad he was inebriated, because he wasn’t quite sure what to do with this information, nor the blasé way Potter was talking about it. Especially not the fact that he had been instrumental in helping Umbridge catch Potter and his stupid band of heroes.
“Stay in your seat, Malfoy!” the guard — who had just peeked his head in the room — snapped. “Get up again and it’s back to your cell!”
At midnight, when Pansy and Blaise had both gone to bed, Draco left the common room for ten minutes only to lead an invisible Harry Potter in behind him when he returned. A few people looked — curious, perhaps, what Draco had been doing out in the rest of the castle at this time of night, but if so, they didn’t ask.
Draco didn't say anything right away. He fiddled gently with the blanket covering Harry up to his midriff, mindful of the bandages. Harry watched him curiously.
“No, you were right,” Harry said, letting out a deep sigh. “About all of that. You were absolutely right, I
“Potter,” Draco drawled, sitting primly down in his creation and pouring himself a steaming mug of tea, “just because defensive magic isn’t my forté doesn’t mean I’m not
For fifteen minutes he walked, feeling his anxiety heighten with each foot he put in front of the other as the canopy of leaves became denser, allowing in less light, and all too aware that the only thing he
“I come here when I can’t sleep,” he bit back, sounding for all the world as though this was the god’s honest truth. It was habitual, after all, engaging Malfoy in a defensive manner. Knowing it was childish, knowing deep down Malfoy deserved this time alone, Harry defiantly toed off his trainers anyway. His fringe had already begun sticking to his forehead from the humidity, and when he looked up again, his glasses were beginning to fog up.
They stayed this way for a long couple of minutes, sweaty bodies pressed together, Harry still trembling faintly and Draco running fingers through his sweaty hair. He could feel Harry’s come leaking out around his cock, and he found that he didn’t hate it. Maybe even liked it. Eventually Harry lifted his head and, after meeting his eyes, he caught Draco’s mouth in a kiss that shook the whole foundation of Draco’s world.
"Yes," he said softly. "And that's not all. They've found a cure, but I can't take it while I'm pregnant."
if you make us look bad in front of the Israelis. It’s unprecedented for the Cup to be held in the same country twice within such a short time span, and since the last one here was in —”
"I wasn't gonna ask you to," Harry said slowly, sitting up as well. "But I s'pose that violent reaction answers my question either way."
“I hate you just fine,” Draco said, smiling when Potter chuckled. “I guess I just don’t understand it entirely. I think most people would enjoy the spotlight.”
“That’s just what it’s called,” Draco explained, grinning. He touched a kiss to Harry’s cheek. “People are quite touchy about terminology.”
“Sorry,” Potter chuckled, and with a bit of manoeuvering on Draco’s part, managed to sit up a bit more, so he was leaning back against the headboard, removing his glasses altogether. He reached for the bottle on the bedside table and twisted off the cap, drinking down another mouthful. Draco’s eyes stayed focused on his bobbing Adam’s apple, but when the bottle was lowered again, his gaze strayed to something on Potter’s hand he’d never noticed before. Tiny raised lines gleamed shiny white and more noticeable than usual with the way the hand was wrapped tightly around the firewhisky.
Potter shrugged. “Haven’t the foggiest. Fred and George nicked it from Filch’s office their first year. Gave it to me our third year so I could sneak into Hogsmeade since my uncle never signed my permission slip. See?” Potter pointed out several different places on the Map which appeared to denote passageways in and out of Hogwarts that Draco had never even heard of before. Many of which Potter had surely used in order to do most of his rule-breaking. “Anyway, it tells you where everyone is, too. That’s how I’ve been finding you.”
“Turn the fuck around, Draco,” said Harry, sounding not angry but exasperated. Draco, blinking, already half-hard, resisted only a few more seconds before turning slowly on the spot and placing his hands on the desk. His cheeks burned with a potent mixture of humiliation and arousal. Harry rarely got this worked up — he had before once or twice, and Draco remembered those times particularly well because of the way he hadn’t been able to sit properly the next few days.
They sat down and he told her everything — about being hit with the hex, the week spent in St Mungo’s, the bi-monthly physicals, and the Healers’ failure to come up with anything. He told her about the bullying and the catcalling and even about how awful it had been going through menstrual cycles, but didn’t mention Kenny Helstrom, and especially not Harry.
"Dry yourself off," he says, and then turns to go back to the sitting room. Harry spells himself dry and follows, sitting in the armchair and watching Draco as he hops up on the windowsill and throws the panes open, then lights a cigarette.
He stood up and left her there, leaving the unbearable atmosphere of the Slytherin common room for the Great Hall and some strong black tea.
"Hermione's always complaining about not having any time to read for pleasure this year," he said, looking again at the book in Malfoy's hands. "I've told her a million times, just because she can
, Harry,” he said tightly, grabbing for his wand with trembling fingers and attempting to fix the essay he had ruined. And even worse than that, now his thighs were sticky-wet, his robes would feel tacky and gross the rest of the day, and he didn’t think the blush on his face would
The cemetery was much prettier now than it had been the first time Harry had seen it with Hermione. He thought this, too, had something to do with the much-more-relaxed atmosphere, although he was also fairly certain it had something to do with Draco’s presence.
She left, mumbling about eighteen-year-olds acting more mature than this. Potter turned to him, grinning like a lunatic with an agenda.
“Get away from my son!” his father screamed, a mad gleam in his eyes. He looked deranged and dangerous and Draco averted his gaze, unable to look any longer. “Look what you’ve done to him! If you touch him, I’ll kill you, Potter!”
“First of all,” Harry said lightly, nipping at the corner of Malfoy’s jaw as he pulled the shirt off his bony shoulders, exposing an unearthly amount of gorgeous pale skin. Striped gruesomely across his front were the faded scars from a hex cast long ago in a Hogwarts bathroom. Harry determinedly ignored them for now. “I hardly think
He was trembling against the door when he felt Harry finally slip his fingers out and stand up, arms going around Draco’s waist and mouth finding the side of his neck once more.
Hardly fifteen minutes had passed when he noticed a minuscule speck appear in the sky. An owl, no doubt. The first of many who would be bringing presents to the students of Hogwarts who had stayed behind for the holidays.
“Darling, will you please listen to me?” she said softly. It sounded eerily like his mother, which only made him feel young and childish. He tugged his arm away and she let him go, but he didn’t move any farther away. “I am
He found that it was too difficult to actually get it out — thankfully, he could see it in Malfoy's eyes that he knew exactly what Harry was saying.
"Who is she?" he asks, gaze stuck on the exit Harry and his new girlfriend just disappeared through.
“They’re doing a Halloween Ball instead of a feast this year,” Ron cut in, and he pointed his fork across the table at Harry, eggs dangling from the end of it. Hermione looked revolted. “Honouring your mum and dad.”
Harry stuck it between his lips, grabbed a green Muggle lighter off the nightstand, and sparked the end to life with a few deep puffs. He held it in several seconds and then blew it out in a hazy cloud.
Harry closed the distance between them unhurriedly, something about his whole countenance forbidding. Draco stood his ground, frowning belligerently even as Harry stopped in front of him, close enough that Draco could smell the rain drying in his hair and on his robes, could see the little flecks of an even deeper green in his eyes, and more importantly, the slight dilation of his pupils.
"Draco." Malfoy's teeth clicked shut and he looked at Harry with so much open vulnerability that Harry's chest ached with it. "It's okay. I get it. I'll take it slow, yeah?"
Something had happened, he thought vaguely, heart hammering noisily against his rib cage even as he looked up into Harry’s eyes — trying to discern something that remained stubbornly indiscernible at the moment — and then complied.
.” Draco snatched the blouse back, anger and humiliation mounting with every pulse of arousal between his legs. He moved to pull the shirt on over his head, only to have Harry grab his wrist, spin him unceremoniously around, and push him face-first up against the nearest wall, where Draco’s breath left him in a rush.
It came in all forms, from an increase in mutterings of "Death Eater" to loud suggestions that he should go on back to Azkaban to be with his mummy and daddy where he belonged. One person even sneeringly asked to see his Dark Mark, and Harry shouted them out of the Great Hall while everyone stared. Afterwards he noticed Goyle watching from the Slytherin table, uncharacteristically deep in contemplation.
the end of it,” Weasley bit out. “You idiot, he’s miserable. And as much as I don’t like you, I can’t pretend he wasn’t doing better than me and Hermione have seen him since ... since the end of sixth year.” Weasley looked away, and Draco’s cheeks flushed again. The reference to Albus Dumbledore’s death was deafening in its omission. “You pulled him out of his head. I dunno how, but you did. This last month, he’s just been getting harder and harder to talk to again.”
," he said. "Like I’ll ... I dunno, have a mental collapse any moment.” He looked over at Malfoy and saw an unreadable, stoic expression on his startlingly pretty face. He said nothing, and Harry took his silence as a cue to continue, and that he was now listening with less scepticism. “You wouldn’t think I’d be lonely,” he began, “and I’m not
know that you belong here, and so do plenty of other people. McGonagall wouldn't have let you come back if you didn't deserve it. I just want you to know that." Malfoy's expression didn't change, but he also didn't look away like Harry had anticipated him doing. He even fancied he could see some highly subdued emotion in his eyes, something Malfoy was no doubt repressing furiously. "I get that, you know, trying to address it formally or whatever would be a terrible idea, but I meant it last night when I said I think Goyle's only making it worse. It's just turning it into a game for people, Malfoy, that's all it's doing."
What colour had climbed back into Narcissa's face since the reveal promptly disappeared again. Harry guessed that, aside from the trials, she had spoken openly about that night even less than he had. Maybe not at all.
A pulse of dizzy arousal made Draco’s head throb; he could hear his heartbeat in his ears, and he could feel his pulse in his fingers. Potter’s breath was unbearably hot on his neck, making it difficult to think, but then, maybe it was okay, just for a moment, just for right now, to let someone else do the thinking — maybe, inside this little bubble, where it was just him and Potter and
Draco’s gut twisted when he realised that somewhere along the line, his heart had begun believing in Harry's promises in spite of his brain's furious reminder that disaster was inevitable.
“How did it go?” he asked breathlessly, green eyes wide with concern. Draco had tried to plan out what he would say a hundred different times in a thousand different ways, but in the end, he wound up flinging all that preparation aside and throwing himself at Harry, arms winding tightly around his neck. Harry stumbled backwards but caught him with a huffed-out laugh, lifting Draco right off his feet for a moment. “I’ll take that to mean it went well, then, did it?”
With the first Quidditch game of the season on Saturday — Gryffindor versus Hufflepuff — Harry found it nearly impossible to find time to spend with Malfoy during the week despite his promise they would talk. He was running the team through practise every day before breakfast, making it so he couldn’t afford to be up at one and two in the morning like he’d been doing before.
“Tables,” says Draco, shoving Harry’s feet off so they drop suddenly to the ground, “are not for your dirty, disgusting feet.”
As Harry had predicted, once the first-years had been Sorted and seated, McGonagall made a special point to address the Battle of Hogwarts in her rather long-winded speech, singling Harry out and forcing him to endure a round of applause for which he put on a smile he’d been practicing all summer, although he couldn't have spoken to its authenticity.
He heard the ridicule. The gossip. The snickering behind hands, even the catcalling from some of the blokes. What Harry
Harry seemed to understand the point Draco was at and, with a grin, slipped his fingers out and finally got around to removing the rest of his own clothing. His flushed prick bobbed in the air as he settled himself back between Draco's legs, fisting his cock slowly with his eyes on Draco's stretched hole. If Draco had needed definitive proof that Harry was still attracted to him this way, he thought with an awed amusement, this was it.
Harry rolled his eyes. "I just wanted to know if you'd fancy spending the day together. Here, at Hogwarts."
Draco had opted out of making the decision yet. He was petrified of talking to Harry about it, and yet knew that he had to. It wasn’t just that the baby inside of him was also Harry’s — it was the fear of returning to his old body. He hadn’t said it out loud, but he was quite aware now that he was utterly and conclusively in love with Harry Potter.
“I dunno,” he said, using his leverage on Draco’s waist to tug him a bit closer. “It’s just, you’re very organised and on top of things usually, so I don’t think you’ve been forgetting to give it back to me. But if you
there, a maddening pulse that made him want to take fistfuls of Potter’s hair and force him to stay put, suck on Draco’s clit until he couldn’t stand it anymore, until he either came or blacked out from the intensity of the whole thing.
"To figure out how to navigate that stuff," says Harry, and he can feel his gaze burning into him. "Everything. Our different personalities. How to talk to each other."
Potter looks genuinely surprised by this and Draco can't help rolling his eyes. Leave it to Potter to be shagging someone regularly and miss out on the fact they've developed feelings for him.
Harry heaved a deep, frustrated-sounding breath. He looked up into Draco’s eyes, and although Draco could practically
“No, honey,” said Draco kindly. “It’s cranberry juice, that’s why it’s red.” He took the drinks as Harry passed the bartender his Muggle money, telling him to keep the change to pay for a couple girls’ drinks that were ordering. They giggled and fluttered their lashes at him, not knowing he had no interest, he was just
Draco wants to be mad but can't. It had been careless to fall into such a habitual gesture, although no
He knocks lightly, trying to compose himself. He's known Daphne for a long time and he's more or less confident in his ability to pass for her, especially if Potter doesn't know her beyond the bedroom. Potter looks confused when he opens the door, and although it doesn't entirely disappear when he sees who it is something visibly softens.
“Yeah, I do,” said Harry forcefully. “You may not be able to empathise with the concept of loyalty, Nott, but that doesn’t mean no one else can.”
“You’re not as funny as you think you are,” Draco informs him as he puts out his cigarette and uncurls himself from the chair. He slips his feet into his Oxfords and Harry swallows his disappointment. His watch tells him it’s 1:23 in the morning, and he feels some kind of bitter satisfaction. It’s always 1:23. He doesn’t think Draco does it on purpose either. “And I’m exhausted.”
“You almost looked like you enjoyed that,” Ginny snickered, and this got a laugh out of Ron as well as a knowing smirk from Hermione. Neville, oblivious to Harry’s discomfort, had been clapping the loudest of anyone in the Hall, but Harry couldn’t find it within himself to be annoyed by it. A number of other Gryffindors — Dean and Seamus, namely — had taken it upon themselves to hoot and holler simply
Theo was quiet for several minutes. Finally, when he spoke, it was in a sober voice: “You’re talking as though you believe you’re stuck this way forever.”
” against his fist where he had it pressed against his mouth, trying to stifle the worst of his helpless noises.
With his whole body thrumming, roaring in exaltation, he lunges forward and he kisses Potter. Messily, gratefully, prayerfully, urgently. Potter grabs his face and kisses him back and more thunder rips the air apart. Then Draco’s on his back in the wet grass and Potter’s body takes the brunt of the downpour, and all Draco can smell is rain and Harry.
that he’d made it this far, that he was learning, exploring, opening himself up and, most important of all,
on your wrist?” Something flashed in his eyes, and then he said in a rather rough voice, “Did I do that to you?”
Harry’s arms finished circling his waist, pulling Draco flush against him and pressing their foreheads together.
“Indeed,” she intoned, lifting an eyebrow and properly lowering the parchment, her full focus now on Harry. “Not another trip to the Ministry, I hope.”
Draco laughs until Harry thrust brutally up into him, and then he’s moaning instead, fingers curling against Harry’s chest. Harry has no way of changing angles, of trying to hit Draco’s prostate or make him scream, so instead he focuses on his own pleasure, because really, at this point, it’s what he deserves. He slams up into him over and over, shaking the bed, making his thighs scream with the effort, and by the time he feels his orgasm approaching his dripping with sweat and his shoulders are killing him and he knows there must be terrible bruises on his wrists.
“Yes, that happens to me from time to time, as well,” she nodded. “It’s expected, after a war like that. It helps if you talk a little bit, Harry.” Feeling suddenly uncomfortable with the topic of the war broached (not to mention the clear resonance to what Harry had been saying to Malfoy last night), Harry descended into a silence that wasn’t lost on Hermione. She sighed and slackened her pace, forcing Harry to follow suit, until they were stopped in the middle of an empty fourth-floor corridor. “I know it’s painful, and I know you don’t want to talk to Ron and me about it, and I understand." Harry looked up, startled by this pronouncement at first until he realised it wasn't actually so surprising that Hermione should have figured this out. "But keeping everything trapped inside your head is even more painful in the long run.” One small hand rested on Harry’s arm and he gave her a weak, grateful smile. “Think about it, okay? Carrying all that around with you … it isn’t your burden to bear, Harry.”
“It’s a bit exhausting, isn’t it?” Malfoy said. He was breathing heavily, and some of his platinum-blond hairs had fallen in front of his eyes. The short pixie cut he’d been sporting two months ago had begun to grow out a bit, and frankly, Harry adored it.
And, emotionally unequipped as Draco was to deal with something as overwhelmingly significant as that sentiment, he buried his face in Harry’s neck and began the seemingly impossible process of mental preparation.
And just as he’d taken Hermione through the little progressions of his and Malfoy’s strange relationship, so too did he explain it to Ron, everything he could remember, the fights and the stolen kisses; the yelling, the hitting, the name-calling; and finally, sparing Ron any unnecessary detailed descriptions, the more tender moments — showing Malfoy the Map, and taking him down to the Chamber of Secrets on a broomstick Malfoy was terrified of. Sleeping in his bed, because Malfoy had so timidly asked him to stay.
Harry held her gaze for a long moment, trying to think of a way to translate his thoughts and feelings into words that made sense, that didn’t sound cold, and heartless, and hollow.
of himself into the things he does,” she said. For some reason, this statement made Draco’s chest feel tight. “Don’t do anything you’re not one hundred percent sure about, Malfoy. Because when Harry gets involved in something —”
Harry laughed softly and squeezed his shoulder. "Yeah, well. If I'm gonna throw my name around it's gonna be for stuff like that. I wish it could've been sooner, but at least your mum's still sane, yeah? Can't imagine what she was holding onto in there."
Those three elusive words were suddenly at the tip of Draco’s tongue again, but he determinedly swallowed them back. He had the strangest feeling Harry could tell.
I'm loving to death all these theories and speculations, you guys are wild! I always take everything you say in comments into account, and I hope as many people as possible will be happy with the direction the story's headed as we start drawing toward the end!
Over the next few weeks, as homework piled up again and people began getting somewhat used to seeing Draco and Goyle hanging around Harry, Ron, and Hermione, Draco faced a fraction less harassment —
Draco squeezed his eyes shut and let out a low, broken moan. It had been two weeks since the last time Harry had fucked him … his own doing, of course.
Hidden from Lucius, Harry assumed. And Bellatrix as well, probably. She wouldn't have wanted her family to know she still harboured love for her middle sister, and perhaps even missed her.
as daft as I’d suspected,” Malfoy said, bringing a bright, smug grin to Harry’s face. “But don’t let it get to your head, Potter. If it gets any bigger it’ll explode into a million pieces.”
“You didn't even know for sure what happened. I’d never told you what he did. All you saw were bruises.”
"Oh, shit," he says ineloquently. "I — sorry. I brought you ..." He lifts a bag he's holding that looks to be from a restaurant. Bloody unbelievable, Draco thinks. He's brought her dinner.
Malfoy let out a tiny huffing breath that seemed as though it was meant to convey annoyance but really just sounded adorable. Harry grinned dopily to himself as Malfoy lowered his legs and shifted onto his knees, turning to face the back of the sofa and tentatively resting his hands on it.
“I dunno … enjoying myself?” He shrugged one shoulder as best he could when he was lying on his side. “Just … living, y’know? Having fun. It’s why I decided to play Quidditch instead of becoming an Auror. I guess maybe one day I might do that, but I doubt it.”
Were they fooling themselves? he wondered for the first time. Was he, Draco, actively making the second biggest mistake of his life?
Potter stood up from the bed as well, a complicated mixture of different emotions on his face, but mostly he just looked like he was simultaneously trying to gather his thoughts even as he held himself back. He was watching Draco as though he were facing off with some wild animal he was trying not to startle, and this as much as anything else fueled the flames of Draco’s indignation.
again until Draco felt the throbbing shaft still deep inside of him and start pulsing; a second later a hot, wet explosion coated Draco’s insides with what he knew to be Harry’s seed. This struck Draco in an unexpectedly powerful way, and as Harry clung to him, trembling as he rocked weakly into Draco through his orgasm, Draco found himself running soothing hands up and down Harry’s back, stroking him gently as he gasped and shook and came back down.
Harry pecks his lips and pulls his fingers out, replacing them with the head of his cock a moment later. He whispers the spell against Draco's lips that coats his cock in lube and, steadying himself on Harry's shoulders again, he starts lowering himself, head falling back when the tip pushes past that ring of muscle, stretching him quite a little bit more than two fingers had prepared him for. The wet heat of Harry's mouth is on his neck suddenly, sucking gentle kisses into his skin as he sinks down further until he's fully seated in Harry's lap, so deeply inside of him he's begun shivering again.
He didn’t know whether it was supposed to be a rhetorical question, but the answer came readily to his lips: “
“I’ll keep that in mind,” he said, and it was closer than he’d come to saying ‘thank you’ in a very long time.
He thought it was probably a bit premature to decide he was in love with Draco Malfoy, but he liked the idea well enough anyhow.
"Me too," Draco agreed, chuckling. His hand went to his belly, quite large now. "Not much longer. Thank
a kiss. For it had been a struggle, too. A fight. He’d seen the look on Potter’s face afterwards, like even he hadn’t been expecting it, and Draco was inclined to believe that might just be the case. None of that negated one very simple, terrifying fact, however: the instant Potter had pulled him close and smashed their mouths together — in a display that was so classic, bullheaded Potter it seemed almost to approach the limits of being cliché — Draco had responded. It had been as instinctive as throwing a punch, except instead of a bruised jaw Potter would now have a bruised mouth to match Draco’s.
“Just looking,” he says. He can see someone through the glass talking to a woman behind the counter, but it appears otherwise empty. His stomach lurches, because suddenly ideas are occurring to him, and he knows it’s stupid but
“Which is an improvement, I’ll admit, but I still can’t stand it. As I was saying, you haven’t been on a date in ages. What’s that about?”
"Why does he still hate me so much?" Harry asked. "I mean, does he ..." He tried to think how to put it into words that didn't sound too dramatic, "Is he upset that I ... that —"
He had, and at the reminder Harry has the uncomfortable experience of feeling two emotions at once: he loves seeing Draco excited, and at the same time he thinks he can actually feel his heart drooping.
And although Harry looked like he wanted to say something, he turned right back around and headed for the castle. Draco waited with fidgeting hands, and fifteen minutes later Harry returned with Draco’s old wand in his hand.
Harry flicks his bound hand and Draco jumps, looking satisfyingly surprised for a moment. Even in spite of his predicament Harry manages a shit-eating grin. Hexes and jinxes are hardly effective done wandlessly but Harry’s rather adept at pulling off a decent Stinging Jinx.
Now, with his eyes closed and the heavy scent of Harry and rain and wet broomstick lulling him into a state of near-tranquility, he feels immortal. They are hovering together somewhere between heaven and earth, and he imagines he can feel all the pain and fear of his past washing away into insignificance under the elemental assault of water and wind.
“Who did that, Malfoy?” Potter cut him off, and his voice was so dangerously low, so full of barely-suppressed anger, that Draco was momentarily left breathless.
“Why would you take an out-of-the-way corridor like this, Malfoy? Half the school is looking for a chance to get you alone so they can knock your teeth out.”
He Apparated them directly into his living room, and they weren’t there for more than a few seconds before Malfoy pounced on him.
Very gently, he cups one of Draco's cheeks and leans in to kiss the other one, then goes back to the bed where he starts pulling the rest of his clothing on.
“Your mother,” he said suddenly, and Draco lifted an eyebrow, “does she know?” His eyes traveled down Draco’s body and back up, prompting an embarrassed flush.
eludes me sometimes." She rolled her eyes fondly. "Last year when all of this started, yes, I was hugely unsure whether Harry was just taking all those feelings between the two of you and expressing them differently because you suddenly looked like a girl. Now I'm absolutely sure all it did was give him a nudge he didn't know he needed to realise your gender means nothing to him. I mean," she amended herself, "not
After a minute and then two and then three, Harry finally mutters, “You didn’t really think I’d sleep with Jenkins, did you?”
“It’s like Professor McGonagall said in her speech,” Hermione said as they finally stood up from the table, “the time for judgments and picking sides is over, Ron. We need to start putting the past behind us so we can begin the process of healing.”
like her?” Draco asks. Harry looks at him and meets his eyes and Draco’s eyebrows lift. And he’s got just no fucking clue what that means, and he wishes so fervently he wasn’t such a socially-inept bell end.
School robes were really a blessing, Draco reflected, hand smoothing over the slightly-stretched skin. No one would notice for quite some time, maybe even not until term had ended and graduation was over with. It was only two more months, after all.
"My god," Hermione said disgustedly upon seeing what they were both looking at — as well as a growing number of people around the hall. "It's pathetic, really, can't they leave him
Harry was on him the moment the door closed, kissing him like he’d been waiting months rather than hours.
“You weren’t what?” Harry said over him. His voice wasn’t harsh or angry but rather mocking, as if he found Draco’s pathetic attempts to explain himself amusing. He slipped a second finger inside and Draco whimpered into his desk, fingers again trying to curl pointlessly against the wood. “You weren’t gonna fuck him?”
…” The last word was elongated into a devastating moan. Harry’s fingers dug into the meat of his arse but he pulled himself back, swiping a thumb across the loosened hole and rudely dipping it inside, all the way to the knuckle, causing Malfoy to buck and cry out.
"I said no such thing," said Draco stubbornly. Still, he was already reaching for a Butterbeer, and he was sitting very close to Harry. "I'm just pointing out that you're a liar."
how it looked, how it sounded — him, falling for Draco Malfoy. If he’d been in Ron’s position, he thought he’d probably have reacted similarly. But did that mean he wasn’t deserving of an opportunity to talk it through?
“Gay?” Draco supplied. She nodded, looking confused. “He … as I said, it’s really rather complicated …”
“Yeah, it is,” says Draco heatedly. “So I’m not sure why you’re choosing to be a complete prick about it suddenly.”
," she cut him off sternly, "if he is attacked again, if he is hit with so much as a Tickling Charm, Potter, I'll be stepping in."
"I —" starts Draco, and then he breaks off. It's much harder to filter his words when Potter's this close. "Both ... I suppose."
, d'you know what I mean? I s'pose the word to use would be cunning, actually. You can’t get fuck all past him, he picks up on things right away.”
Hermione, ignoring Ron’s awkward mumblings and still staring down at her book, said in a perfectly calm tone of voice: “Well, his robes did look much too big on him, and if the rearrangement of his facial structure is anything to go by I’d have to say there’s at least a chance the rest of his body was affected in the same way.” She looked up, and when she saw Harry’s and Ron’s red cheeks she rolled her eyes. “
“Hello, Professor,” said Harry, walking inside and shutting the door behind him. “Do you have a moment?”
“Which you know perfectly well is disruptive when it’s you,” said Draco. Harry opened his mouth to retort but Draco cut him off: “What are you doing here?”
"Stay back, Potter," said Goyle the moment he looked up from his chair near Malfoy's and saw him approaching. Harry stopped a few feet away, obliging Goyle's precaution. He even put his hands up in an open gesture of complaisance.
He could barely reconcile this person with the Draco Malfoy he’d always known. At the same time it couldn’t have been anyone else, for nobody else could have made Harry feel this close to the edge of his sanity.
Draco nodded, jaw clenched. Hermione was paying fierce attention and looked as if she was about to start taking notes. Ron himself was extremely pale.
"That must explain why he's happy to be rid of me, then," says Draco, savagely glad for the look of disgusted disappointment Hermione gives him before walking away. She goes to Weasley, who is surrounded by friends and drops an arm across her shoulders when she stands next to him. They are everything he and Harry never managed to figure out, stable and congruous and easy.
“That’s why you came out here, isn’t it?” Potter chuckled. Draco saw nothing funny about the situation. “At first I thought you might have gone mad, but then I realized you were probably just setting me up. You’re nearly as clever as Hermione sometimes.”
This couldn’t continue, of course — not only was going to his classes conducive to graduating, but it was shameful almost beyond reason to be
“Of course it’s not going to work out,” he said. Pansy looked more confused than ever, not to mention a bit worried. “One day he’s going to remember who I am, and it’s probably going to be the day I get my real body back. He doesn’t think it’ll happen, swears it won't, but it will. And when that day comes, when Harry realises he doesn’t love me the way he thought he did … I suppose I just have to pray it doesn’t kill me.”
The five of them ate dinner together, Leo in his high chair, and afterwards, with the baby in Ron and Hermione’s room again, he and Harry finally found themselves alone.
"I used to wanna be my dad," he said sardonically. Yet there was sadness there too. "A politician. Well-connected, lots of influence everywhere. That sort of thing."
upset,” she said, pulling her hand back and — absentmindedly, it seemed — straightening a wrinkle on the shoulder of Harry’s robes. “He has his reasons, but … oh, you
Malfoy rolled his eyes, but it was half-hearted. “When you said earlier that you don’t care about the things people expect you to care about … what did you mean by that?”
He doesn’t take Draco out to dinner – he forces him to go on walks where they hold hands and talk and completely arbitrarily find somewhere to eat when they feel like it, usually a dumb, cosy little diner where they can share a bench and Harry kisses him with strawberry milkshake on his tongue.
“That’s what I’m working on, too,” Hermione said, indicating the work she’d been doing before Harry had returned. “You’re welcome to look it over if you’d like, it’s almost finished.”
There was an expression on Granger’s face that Draco took to mean she was going to follow up on this at the first opportunity, and for just a second it occurred to him why Harry had been friends with her all these years. Without his prejudices creating a solid barrier of dislike, Draco had come to realise she was really quite a comforting presence. Perhaps it was the reliability combined with the intelligence, or maybe even the genuine concern that appeared in her eyes when she was involved in a situation.
He was silent for a moment, contemplating his answer. In the end, he pushed himself off the window and regaled them with the whole unhappy tale, finishing with the hex Malfoy had thrown at him before screeching at Harry to leave. Hermione looked troubled and Ron disturbed.
“Isn’t it?” Malfoy’s hand stroked up his cock, passed over the glans, and back down. “What d’you s’pose this is, then?”
him, most of his focus further down where he's rubbing himself against Harry, trying for friction that just isn't enough, not even with Harry's hands on his arse, leading the movements. It's really only now, on top of him, moving with him, feeling, smelling, tasting,
“Leave?” Draco supplied tonelessly. “Why did he fuck off and leave me here alone? I couldn’t fucking tell you that, Weasley. I really couldn’t.”
“The Dursleys,” he said, appearing to resign himself to something, “my Muggle … family. They didn’t feed me much. Worst of it was the summer before second year. Uncle Vernon locked me in my room and installed a cat flap — Muggle thing, so cats can go in and out of a door without it being open. They’d push a can of soup through it about three times a day, and half of that I had to give to Hedwig because there were bars on my window so I couldn’t let her out to hunt.”
hard at this point, and it was with an audible groan of relief that Harry finally pulled it out of the confines of his jeans and divested himself of the rest of his clothing, wandlessly conjuring lube onto his pulsing shaft and stroking the length of it several times before stopping himself. Malfoy, he saw, was looking over his shoulder, eyes wide and rosy lips parted as he watched, the pink flush of his cheeks deepening to a hearty red that made him look much younger.
“Well … it was bound to happen eventually, right?” Ron tried, apparently of the mindset that this was a comforting thing to say. Hermione squawked at him indignantly and smacked his arm. Harry, to his own immense surprise, managed a small smile.
Harry shrugged, feeling marginally better, if only because he was now blaming himself a bit less for the debacle. If Hermione felt he hadn’t done anything tactless and hurtful, surely he was in the clear …
It was obviously meant to be a joke, only Harry didn't smile. Malfoy's dissolved pretty quickly as well, probably when he realised how that had sounded.
“Of course not!” she defended fiercely, but when she saw the grin on Harry’s face he saw her relax a little bit. “I just meant —”
He doesn’t actually want to say the words because the idea is so ludicrous he’s afraid it’ll sound stupid and Malfoy will laugh at him. But he’s here, isn’t he? Covered in dirt, clearly knowledgeable, and Harry had just seen a class coming out of the greenhouse.
Harry’s eyes are greenest when he’s just woken up. They are completely unguarded and so vivid they shouldn’t be real. Draco’s seen pictures of Harry’s mother, knows he’s supposed to have gotten that colour from her, but thinks privately that no one who’s ever lived could have exactly the same eyes as Harry. They are precisely the same shade of green as the Killing Curse, and Draco thinks sometimes that maybe that’s not a coincidence.
what I offered to listen to him talk about in the first place, in all fairness — but he won’t talk about the past, and he certainly won’t talk about
“I —” Malfoy blinks again. His utter bewilderment is as endearing as everything else. “Are you serious?”
to get complicated?” she parroted. Harry could see the perplexity on her face. She hadn’t been expecting more, which told him her speculations hadn’t gotten as far as he’d guessed. And that meant getting out the rest was going to be much more difficult.
"Yeah, Kingsley owled me last week. I'd told him — well, I'd only mentioned in passing, really, that I was still thinking about it over the summer, being an Auror, I mean. I've wanted to since fourth year," he explained. "He wrote me saying if I was still interested, now commencement's so close, he could guarantee me one of the five spots that'll be open this summer. I still have to
An indecipherable expression appeared on McGonagall’s face. Her lips pursed into something that could have been an attempt at repressing a smile, but he didn’t know for sure.
Harry kissed him soundly and then climbed off the seat. He toed off his shoes and unzipped his flies and took his cock out, hot and hard and throbbing, and he squeezed around the base to try and stave off the worst of the burning need to just bury himself in Malfoy's arse and fuck him.
angry either. A little bit annoyed, maybe, but mostly curious. Still, his presence is a powerful one, making Draco feel two feet tall and rather weak.
And Harry understood finally. Goyle was not only worried about Draco's physical safety — he was very scared for his mental health, as well.
“I’m sorry.” Harry sounded frantic now. It was something Draco could not have imagined had he not been seeing it happen in front of him. “I’m so sorry, I’ll come back in a bit and we can …” He trailed off. “I just need to take a walk.”
The corridor was empty, not being one of the more popular routes to classes, which made Draco wonder whether this boy had followed him, just hoping he would separate himself from the student body, making him an even easier target than usual. The irony of it was that since Kenny Helstrom, he had deliberately avoided taking the least-trodden hallways for this exact reason.
Draco nodded. His throat felt tight and clogged up with emotion, and he was afraid if he said anything else his voice would shake. He thought of the words he’d needed so badly to say ten or fifteen minutes ago, when Harry been buried inside of him and the emotion had been so huge he’d felt he must suffocate under its weight. He thought, too, of what Harry had said when he couldn’t get it out, that breathless “me too” that could have meant anything, except Draco
Harry huffed out a laugh and let his head fall back to the pillow, looking fondly up at Draco, who could only think to roll his eyes in order to hide any other wayward emotions this might evoke.
“Then you know how much he weighs in Chocolate Frogs,” he said, taking Harry’s cigarette and putting that out too. Harry looked at him, confused, as Draco took his hand, feeling very resigned, and began leading Harry towards the bathrooms.
The question was the last thing Draco had been expecting, and it hit him with the force of a stampeding hippogriff, leaving him dizzy with arousal and clutching at Potter’s robes. He
He loses himself in it quickly, his hazy, sluggish brain happily forgetting the presence of eight or nine of their friends around them as he drinks his fill. All that’s real or matters is the warm, solid weight of Draco in his lap, the smell of weed and coconut, his soft lips and wet tongue and the gentle fingers on his jaw, stroking lightly. His own hand, the one not draped behind Draco’s back, finds his hip and snakes beneath his shirt, just enough to graze warm skin. Draco smiles against his mouth and hums into the kiss before pulling away and trailing his lips towards Harry’s ear.
Draco’s eyes rolled, a habitual response to the mention of just one of the myriad things Potter was famous for.
He didn't, though, because he didn't think he needed to. He could see on Malfoy's face that he'd already begun asking himself that very question.
Draco spluttered incoherently at the pet name, standing there starkers, dripping wet, in front of a horrendously smug-looking Harry Potter who’d just had his tongue three fingers deep in Draco’s arse, and still managing to muster up an appropriate amount of indignity, which unfortunately did nothing to cover up the bright red spots of arousal on his cheeks.
Several beats of silence, and then Draco’s father looked past Harry at him, nose wrinkled with disdain and loathing. The effect was exacerbated, somehow, by the greying stubble on his chin and the loose skin of his cheeks.
by stopping the Dementor's Kiss, but you know as well as I do he'll have lost his mind in six months' time anyway! That's the only reason you did it! But you don’t
"Potter, don't be obtuse," said Draco with a roll of his eyes. "Daphne was never swayed by Pansy to join her gang of mindless, worshiping twits and she won't be swayed by whatever romanticised, Gryffindorian tosh Granger gets him to memorise and then nervously shout into Daphne's poor face. Tell her to leave it alone."
On Christmas Day, he and Malfoy finally played a Seeker's match. It was completely exhilarating, reminding Harry that those games when it had been Malfoy he was up against, when it had been just the two of them above the rest of the game, searching for that glint of gold, both of them buzzing with the desire to best the other — that was when Quidditch had always been best.
"It's an English National shirt," he said, pointing out the obvious in absolutely typical Harry fashion. His eyes were shining. "I mean,
to be him, because no one else’s voice could have made Draco squirm the way he was doing now. He was the one with Potter’s cock in his hand, yet somehow it was all too clear who held the power in this situation, and it certainly wasn’t Draco.
The instant the door closed, Harry had him pressed up against it face-first, Draco spluttering indignantly until Harry slipped a thigh between his legs, spreading them apart, and began mouthing at his neck.
“I did. I do.” He takes a pause in order to pour tea for both of them and collect his thoughts. He watches as Granger drops two lumps of sugar into hers and skips the milk. He uses neither for his own. Harry uses obscene amounts of both; the thought makes Draco smile.
The golden light of evening was filtering in through the large windows and Harry finally noticed that the chair next to his bed was occupied, and even though it was blurry without his glasses he knew by the white-blond hair and the shape of his body who it was. Draco was curled up in it with a book on his lap but he wasn't reading it. He was staring out the opposite window, looking ethereal bathed in the glow of the setting sun, and had clearly not realised Harry was awake.
As a present to himself on his birthday, he’d bought a new broom before coming to Hogwarts this year. It was the newest model available, the Moonraker, and it had been expensive indeed. As was usually the case when Harry spent large sums of money he had to fight back a habitual sense of guilt that he supposed had something to do with the time he’d spent living with the Dursleys.
It erupted from the end of his wand with so much strength it sent him reeling backwards. His eyes flew open in shock when he'd found his balance, and he was met with a sight that made goosebumps rocket up and down his arms.
"I'm gonna help you up, all right?" he said, beginning to stand. "I need to get you to the Infirmary."
"Yes, well, that's what Harry does. I think it's for himself too, though," she said, stirring her drink contemplatively. "Maybe not consciously that part, but it definitely is."
"You look so good like this, Draco," Harry said in a low voice. Draco responded beautifully, whether to the words themselves or just the sound of his voice, Harry didn't know. He arched his back, head pressing into the tiled wall, the long line of his neck gleaming with water that dripped slowly down to the deep valleys of his collarbones. He came again without being touched this time, spurting come onto both their chests and finally reaching for his prick to stroke himself in jerky movements when Harry followed not long after, emptying inside of him.
Although this was highly strange considering he and Theo had never been close enough friends for him to have picked up on such minor food preferences, Draco didn't say anything, pulling the plate into his lap instead and lifting a forkful of the tender meat to his mouth.
Draco lifted both hands and placed them on either side of Potter’s stupid, handsome face, pulling him down into a kiss that was as much frustration as it was a devastating need to taste him. Potter’s hands tightened on his hips, his tongue sweeping the inside of Draco’s mouth in a way that was becoming frighteningly familiar.
“Can I still stay tonight?” The request broke Harry’s heart. He pulled her into his side when she cuddled back into him, hating the way he could feel the wetness of her face pressed to his skin.
? Just because you and McGonagall and a couple other people vouched for me so I could come back here doesn't mean my name isn't poison."
“Ow,” Draco mumbled, rubbing at his cheek where Potter’s glasses had dug into the skin as soon as Potter’s mouth started trailing down his jaw.
friends. We despised each other and then we started fucking and it was amazing and we thought that was enough for a relationship and it wasn't. We're nothing alike. I don't
it wouldn’t lead anywhere good. Now that he’s apparently come to terms with his feelings, I see no harm in sharing my speculations.”
With a long-suffering sigh, Malfoy stood up from the tub and wrapped his arms around himself, the sleeves of Harry’s jumper hiding his hands entirely. Harry observed with a bit of astonishment that he looked rather cute wearing it, and then pushed away that thought.
Harry shook his head. Shrugged. “I died,” he said. He blinked down at Malfoy, his red lips, his flushed cheeks, the ash in his white hair and his cold grey eyes — which, actually, were a bit less frosty than usual at the moment. One might even have ventured to say that looked quite warm right now. “I
"You didn't do anything, Harry," he says softly. "I just — sometimes I get ... insecure, I dunno. About you. Us." His cheeks burn with embarrassment, he can't
By eight o'clock it was just Ginny and her boyfriend still left, and they were spending the night. His name was Mark and Harry liked him a lot; they had apparently met at a pub in London, and if Ginny had told him about hers and Harry's history he showed no sign of it.
, Potter!” Theo yelled as Harry turned away from him, expression softening the instant his eyes fell on Draco. “They’d love to hear about their Famous Potter in a relationship with the disgraced Malfoy heir!”
“I was nearly sorted into Slytherin,” Harry said abruptly, having been the first thing to pop into his mind that wasn’t a dark or depressing matter.
He was maybe five feet away from them when Harry, who was on high alert, whipped out his wand only a millisecond later than the boy Malfoy had called Conway, but that millisecond was enough. He yelled
to understand," he said over her, "you, what … tossed me aside? Did it never occur to you to just ask me about it rather than acting like the rest of the morons at this school?"
Huffing out an impatient breath, Harry manhandled Malfoy onto his back, lengthwise across the sofa, and climbed on top of him, between his spread thighs. Their cocks slid together when Harry bent over him, crushing their mouths together into a searing kiss that Malfoy instantly deepened with his tongue.
When he lifted his arm, he felt the magic flow from his whole body into the wand, like a great tidal wave of it. He knew even before he finished saying the incantation that it was going to work this time.
The result was that there were days when the sex didn't involve Draco going into his headspace at all; in fact (and this had become one of Harry's favourite things in the world) Draco could be quite smiley when he was in a good mood. It wasn't something he liked more or less, necessarily, but rather in a different way. Being able to get Draco to a place where he could find peace for a little while was satisfying in its own very particular way — fucking him while he was wearing a heartbreakingly beautiful grin and breathlessly calling Harry a wanker was satisfying in quite another.
“I’m sorry, Harry,” he whispered against his lips. Harry’s arms came up to circle around his waist. When he pulled back slightly, he saw those fervently green eyes up close and his chest ached with something too complicated for words. “I used to … I
true), except that although he did go up to his dorm around ten, he donned his Cloak at twelve-thirty after everyone was asleep and went down to the Prefects’ bathroom.
“The hell kind of Captain do you think I am?” Harry scoffed, halfway between amusement and guilt. It was always fairly easy to ignore what the media had to say about him, but when his reputation began cropping up like this, amongst his friends and his colleagues — when he was forced to face the consequences of his rapidly-deflating sense of responsibility — Harry always felt a small pang of uncertainty.
Malfoy gave it three more tries — eliciting the exact same response as the first time — before he decided he’d had enough for the night. Harry tried to remind him how utterly advanced the magic was, but Malfoy still seemed frustrated.
It was nearly impossible to get through the rest of the day. Three separate times Harry nearly told Ron and Hermione what was going on, especially when Hermione, later that evening, brought up Malfoy's retreat back into his self-imposed isolation. He managed to keep his mouth shut, though.
"Well I'm not telling him about —" He looked at Harry, cheeks colouring again. Ron coughed. "Just that I've been spending time with you three. He'll go along with it eventually, even if he doesn't like it."
“Sorry, Pans.” Draco stood from the bed and went to his dresser, where he started to pull out clothes for the day. “I also have to finish my Defence essay. It’s due tomorrow, you know.”
something.” He paused, and then leaned down slowly to kiss him again, glad when he met no resistance. It was messy and unhurried and utterly opposite to any other kiss they’d shared so far tonight. When he pulled away, he felt something essential shift between them, and he couldn’t find the necessary will power to stop himself asking, “D’you wanna smoke a joint with me?”
"All right, that's it," she said suddenly, startling Harry and nearly causing Ron to fall out of his seat, as he'd been slowly drifting into a stupor over his Potions textbook. "I'm ... I'm going to go ask Malfoy his opinion on this."
Draco rolls his eyes behind his mug as he takes a sip of tea. "No one will care anymore in two weeks when you win your next match," he says. "Relax, Harry."
Leaving the bra off but putting his shirt back on, Draco slipped into the steaming tub fully clothed and let himself cry until his eyes were red, puffy, and sore, and he could sneak back into his dorm room in the dead of night without being accosted by any of the friends he'd insisted to Potter he'd have rather spoken to than him.
"Nope," he says. He reaches past Draco to grab a vial of frog spawn, coming much too close, and Draco has to covertly hold his breath because he knows how Potter smells and it's too dangerous to breathe him in at this proximity. "Oh, but I have been meaning to tell you," he adds suddenly, settling that heavy gaze on Draco with one hand on the door, "Daphne calls me Harry."
“Can I see yours?” Malfoy said, blush returning. “Only time I ever saw you do it was third year, and I didn't exactly get a good look then.”
Theo shrugged, looking perfectly comfortable despite Draco’s obvious wariness and dislike for the question. There was a gleam of something in his eyes that could have been suspicion, but Draco liked to believe that was simply his Slytherin cunning shining through. It was very easy, after all, to make somebody talk when they thought you already knew.
"I'm not hungry either," said Harry. Ron gave him a look but said nothing, and soon he and Hermione were out the door.
Draco stayed quiet as they made their way up to Gryffindor Tower; his focus kept going to his belly, where he found himself trying to
"He's doing it for me," said Draco much later, when everyone was gone and it was just him and Hermione in the kitchen with their tea before bed. Ron and Harry were playing chess in the sitting room. "The whole name thing before we find out the gender."
The day before Halloween — and more importantly, according to the students of Hogwarts, the Halloween Ball — Draco woke up feeling like his body was trying to devour itself from the inside out. He turned onto his side in bed, curling up into the fetal position and squeezing his eyes shut in pain. It lasted for several minutes before the worst of it began to fade, leaving a dull, throbbing ache in its place. At first, he thought his body was finally having some severe adverse side effects to the hex. That was until he remembered the way Pansy always turned into a monster once a month, and he realized with a shock that he was experiencing menstrual cramps.
“I love it!” he shouted, and ruffled Harry’s head once more. “The Boy Who Lived to bust me bollocks. Tell you what, mate, I’ll see if I can’t nick some Firewhisky for tonight, eh? I reckon Dean’ll help me out.”
on the way back up, his hand covering the base where he couldn’t quite get his mouth all the way down. Potter’s hips twitched up, pressing against the back of his throat, and Draco moaned loudly around his cock.
you care about, then?” Malfoy said; it could have been a deflection, but Harry fancied there was a note of genuine curiosity in his voice.
The thing was that, as tentatively open as everyone seemed to be about trying to make amends with the Slytherins, the courtesy didn't seem to have been extended to Malfoy. This wasn't surprising perhaps, seeing as Malfoy had been one of the more high-profile trials over the summer, not least of all because of his age, his name, and the fact that he was the only Death Eater who'd escaped a life imprisonment in Azkaban.
“I, er … no, yeah, I agree,” Harry said, trying to fight back his surprise at the broaching of the subject of Draco from such an unexpected source. Beside him, peripherally, he could see Hermione struggling to remain straight-faced. “I wouldn’t wish that on anybody.”
“Now, correct me if I’m wrong,” said Harry slowly, a wicked grin growing on his lips that made Malfoy frown belligerently, “but you did just call me
“I told her I’m gay, too.” He swallowed hard, and before Harry could cut him off, said, “She already knew. Intuition, I suppose.”
argument certainly does not mean you have to stop seeing each other. Maybe over the holidays he’ll have a chance to cool down, and when we come back you can talk to him about it again.”
— he knew that Draco was just two seconds away from completely falling apart, Draco could see it on his face and in that devious smirk he was sporting.
“Fuck you, Potter!” Draco bursts out. He gets unsteadily to his feet and pushes both hands through his hair, off his sweaty forehead, and wipes the wetness away from his cheeks. He’s shutting down, repressing, going dark again. “
That evening, Pansy knocked on his door at just after ten. Harry was sitting at the desk, hunched over an essay he’d been working on for the last half-hour. Draco was on his stomach on his bed, revising his notes he’d taken earlier in the day with Granger.
Harry shook his head. “No,” he said firmly; with all the questions driving him to the brink of madness lately, this was one thing Harry was absolutely sure about. “He was too embarrassed he’d said it, like it had slipped out. And he wouldn’t talk about it when I tried to bring it up again.” Another sip of firewhisky, another shake of his head, another gritting of his teeth. “Anyway … I can’t see how he and I will ever
“I’d like to return the favour at some point,” he said when he pulled back, causing Draco’s head to flood with images that made his cheeks red and his heart pound. “Whenever you feel comfortable enough.”
They hadn’t officially gotten back together, but it certainly felt inevitable, and in all honesty Harry appreciated Ginny’s willingness to let the pieces fall back into place in their own time. There was, after all, no rush these days.
“What’s with you?” he asks. Draco doesn’t answer again; he disrobes himself without magic, then slips off his shirt and trousers and climbs onto the bed, a knee on either side of one of Harry’s legs. He looks quite mad, and lucky for him he’s just fucking perfect enough that he makes madness into something ethereal. His hair is free from its usual product, tempting Harry’s bound hands with how soft it looks. The combination of helplessness and arousal makes his breathing shallow and loud, his chest rising and falling too obviously for his taste.
“God,” Draco muttered, and now he reached down and pressed his palm against Harry’s cock, pleased to feel how hard he was in spite of his ruthless teasing. “You’re so annoying.”
— he seemed to be bowling right into another orgasm, the muscles in his belly quivering violently as he tried to draw in harsh, panting breaths.
"Of course I do," said Harry. "I've been thinking about this a while. I just ..." he searched for the right words, "I wanna
a memory. At one time, it had caused him greatest despair to know what his mum had once thought of his dad, but as he’d gotten older, and as he’d learned how little black-and-white there was to the world, he’d grown rather fond of knowing his parents had overcome a history of … not getting along.
A few days before Valentine's Day, Goyle actually did it. He had done it, apparently, right after the Slytherins' Transfiguration lesson, so he told Harry, Ron, and Hermione about it later in the common room.
"They've accepted me into Auror training," said Harry. The words, spoken aloud for the first time, gave him a case of excited butterflies. There were nerves, sure, but he was
“God, look at your tits,” Harry said, lifting his free hand to unabashedly cup his left breast. In the next second he had pulled Draco down onto his lap, pale legs straddling his waist, and Draco caught himself with his hands on Harry’s chest.
it — that guilt, that heartache. That anguish. At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter if anyone else decides to forgive you if you haven’t even let yourself feel your own remorse.”
, he thought, glancing over at Harry again, who now had a small wound in his arm where the glass had stabbed him,
"You know what I was thinking might be fun?" said Hermione, whose finger had been grabbed by Leo when she started prodding him. "We ought to take him to Hogwarts so Dumbledore's portrait can meet him."
It was the right thing to say. Her expression melted into something much softer and he fancied he even saw the beginnings of a smile.
“Great.” Harry pushes off the workstation. He can’t help it any longer — he reaches out and uses his thumb to brush away the dirt on Malfoy’s cheek. Malfoy freezes at the touch and Harry sees him swallow. “You missed a spot,” he says by way of explanation, grinning again and pulling back. “See you at six, then.”
Grinning in triumph and with a powerful surge of possessiveness making his spine tingle, Harry let go of Malfoy’s throat, gripped his hips hard, and started pounding into him with little abandon. Malfoy’s hands scrabbled frantically before gaining purchase and he looked to be holding on for dear life as Harry pulled out and slammed back in, ceaselessly burying his aching cock in Malfoy’s perfect arse with a reckless sort of urgency. The slick, wet squelching sounds of the lube and Harry’s own pre-come with each devastating thrust only heightened the whole experience.
He doesn’t know if the Room of Hidden Things exists anymore, but he does know that it feels meaningful he should have found this cathedral in the same place where he’d been saved last year.
“He attacked him out of nowhere, Professor —!” one of Kenny’s Gryffindor friends started up, but Kenny himself cut him off, glancing warily at Harry, a hand on his jaw.
Draco’s chest clenched. Back to the wall, he looked up into the face of this nameless boy whose family had, apparently, been murdered by Draco’s father, and he said nothing. He couldn’t think of anything
Harry, heart in his throat, pulled his jumper off and pushed it into Malfoy's hands. "Put that on. It's hand-knitted, it's really warm."
“Exactly. And what happened sixth year, when suddenly Malfoy wasn’t paying every ounce of his attention to you anymore?”
There was none of the expected scepticism on Harry's face. No frustration, no anger. He looked a bit sad, very troubled, but perhaps that was expected.
Harry for his part seemed to be on a mission. His free hand was on Draco's hip, holding him down while he fucked him with his fingers steadily and ruthlessly, like he was trying to figure something out. And Draco realised what it was at the same moment Harry found it, making him jerk and gasp with the sudden onslaught of pleasure.
Taken completely off guard, all Draco could do in response to this was stare, bewildered, eyebrows drawn, across the table at Theo. Half cast in shadow from the dying fire, he looked rather imposing. His blunt questions were ruthless, shameless, terrifying.
Harry fidgeted where he sat, thinking about Malfoy, about how many times he’d kissed him, about meeting up with him under the Invisibility Cloak right in the middle of the library. Perhaps it hadn’t been a good idea, after all, to keep all this from Ron. At least not for this long.
It was now down to one week, and the anxiety was starting to feel like a persistent weight on his chest.
because Harry had had the nerve to see right through him and point out the obvious flirtations between himself and Adrian. But he couldn’t help it — he was tetchy from a lack of sex and attention and it felt good to be petulant.
"Don't," he says when Harry reaches for his shirt. He doesn't need to say anything else — Harry drops it and unclothes himself fully. His hair sticks to his forehead. He's scrawny and full of scars and he looks transcendental. "Come in the lake."
Somebody had moved it, though, and there wasn’t a snowball’s chance in hell he’d manage to reach the top shelf without the boost. And of course his wand was back at the table, because why the hell should he have needed it to get some goddamned ingredients from the closet? It would be mortifying to go back out there, however, and have to tell Blaise he couldn’t reach the bloodroot.
He pulled his fingers out and Draco pressed his forehead to the desk again, trying to bring his breathing back around to something more normal in spite of the frantic way his heart was pounding.
after having heard that snarky tone of voice. He was satisfied to see that the flush on Malfoy’s cheeks darkened. Knowing it was tactless, knowing Hermione would just about lose her mind if she heard it, Harry found himself asking anyway, “Madam Pomfrey couldn’t do anything?”
“This isn’t even fucking real,” Harry told himself, and he pressed his free hand to his forehead, like he might feel a fever burning there.
Completely floored by this, it actually took Draco a moment to understand what Potter was talking about. His stomach flipped when a hazy image of his old wand materialised in his mind, as well as the blurry memory of Potter wrenching it from his grasp before he’d fled the manor.
“Used to,” Harry admitted. Something unreadable passed across Malfoy’s face. “Especially second year, when I found out it's mostly been Dark wizards who can talk to snakes. But I’ve learned that the House you
," he says again, voice breaking in the middle of it. Potter only speeds up his fingers, slamming them into Draco's pussy, and he gives a short cry when his orgasm hits him like a speeding train. It's earth-shattering, his hips jerking as Potter fucks him through it, leaning into him heavily with his own body to keep Draco in place.
He held Draco while he came down and eventually nuzzled under Harry's chin, remaining in that docile headspace for a while longer before rolling onto his back and then sitting up. He was not entirely back to himself, but he was getting there.
Still, interview after meeting after press conference after interview became tiresome, particularly to a boy who had never appreciated the spotlight in the first place. Yet Harry endured it, because that was what he did. That was what he had
"I can't live with that, Draco," Harry tells him, brutally honest, sickeningly blunt. "I can't not see you."
“That means a lot coming from you, Malfoy,” Harry teased, blowing out a long stream of smoke and then kissing his soft cheek. “I have something for you, by the way.” He pulled the Snitch from the game out of his jumper and pressed it into Malfoy’s free hand.
“I know,” he said shortly. “Believe me, ‘Mione, I know that. I keep trying to tell myself it’s just a coincidence — it’s like Ron said, he’s a bit of a prat, anybody could’ve decided they’d had enough and hit him. But … what if it
“What is it exactly you’re trying to do?” he said. His voice was low, a little dangerous, covering Draco’s arms in goosebumps. “Call me crazy but lately it’s feeling a bit like we’re teenagers again, isn’t it?”
“You’ve been staring at me lately,” he breathed across Draco’s neck. Draco braced himself with his hands in Potter’s robes, arching his head back to give Potter more room, unashamed of his need even when he heard him chuckle. “I can feel your eyes on me in every class we have together. Why?”
“You have a lot to learn about Harry, Malfoy,” said Weasley, standing up and going to his trunk, where he pulled out a tin of what looked, upon opening, to be homemade fudge. When he sat back down, Weasley held it out to him. “He doesn’t back down from things, even when they scare the shit out of him. He doesn’t abandon people.”
"Too bad the Prince's book didn't survive," said Harry, grinning at the way Hermione's frown deepened. "I could've lent it to you."
“Mum,” he whispered, reaching out a hand to stroke a thumb across the shape of her name in the cold marble. “I’m gonna be a dad. Can you believe it?” Beside him, he felt Draco kneeling as well, and a gloved hand was slipped back into his own. He smiled. “Do you believe in an afterlife?”
Hermione held his eyes, like she was trying to make sure her suspicions were correct before saying them out loud. Harry could hardly blame her. Even knowing as he did that he and Malfoy had snogged out on the pitch, it was still difficult to wrap his brain around.
Harry considered the question a moment, and then he pushed off the wall and tossed his half-smoked cigarette into the street. Malfoy’s eyebrows drew together. Grinning, Harry plucked the cigarette from Malfoy’s hand as well, cupped his soft cheek with his free one, and without even a suggestion of reluctance leaned in and kissed him hard on the mouth. Malfoy froze, but within seconds he began responding to Harry’s coaxing, drawing his lips apart with a gasp and letting Harry slip his tongue inside. He felt a moan vibrate between them and threw down Malfoy’s cigarette so he could get a hand on his waist instead.
"I'll leave," says Harry suddenly. Draco feels a little as if his windpipe is being squeezed. "It's fine, I have practise in an hour anyway."
know. It’s just that he’s never questioned Draco about it, he’s always just sort of … pretended not to notice. And for that, Draco has always been grateful, because
After a moment of deliberation where he studied Malfoy’s face, Harry finally unbuttoned his denims to give his aching cock a little more room, and when he ground against Malfoy again, it was without that thick barrier between them. His eyes fell closed at the heat and the friction, lips back at Malfoy’s neck. Malfoy’s nails were ten tiny pricks of pain in his back as Harry thrust up against him, his stiff cock rubbing over Malfoy’s shorts in long, dragging movements that pulled mewling noises out of the blond beneath him.
"Oh — no," Draco said, suddenly looking nervous. But Harry, smiling, lifted Teddy up and transferred him to Draco's lap. Draco looked utterly shocked, his hands flying to Teddy's sides to awkwardly keep him upright. "I'm
In front of the entire entrance hall, Harry cupped Draco’s cheeks and pulled him into a kiss that felt earth-shattering in its significance.
He feels hands slipping around him from behind and lets it happen, shivering a little when Harry's arms close around him completely and he pulls Draco back against his chest. There are lips behind his ear, soft and sweet, touching the spot where only Harry knows he's got a tiny looping line tattoo of a stag because he usually has a Glamour on it. He'd gotten it one night in Paris, at a
It’s been almost two years since he’s visited Hogwarts. He doesn’t generally let it go that long — at least once or twice every year Harry usually makes a point of it, to see McGonagall and Flitwick and Dumbledore’s portrait, to walk the corridors and engorge himself on the familiarities, to find an inner peace, like he’s visiting a spiritual temple rather than his old school. Well, it certainly feels spiritual to him, anyway.
"Good," he said, tucking himself back into his jeans. Draco watched him do it. It was starting to dawn on him now: he'd just taken Draco Malfoy's virginity. Brave new world, indeed. "I need you to say it for me, though, 'cause you're acting really weird."
"Potter," Goyle said. Every syllable sounded like a struggle. "I want to ..." His jaw clenched, and his fists. Harry eyed him uncertainly. "You three, you saved me last year. I ..." He let out a deep sigh. "I need to ... I should — we were trying to hand you —"
“Bit fetish-y, isn’t this?” Harry said breathily, eyes wide as he watched, looking half amused and half awed. In retaliation, Draco took another finger into his mouth and slid his tongue between them, tasting soap and salt, feeling the callouses on the tips of his fingers and letting that sensation grip his insides like an iron fist. “Jesus Christ,” Harry groaned; his free hand went to Draco’s jaw, holding him steady, and with a truly outstanding audacity began fucking Draco’s mouth with his fingers.
tactful, Potter. Good job, waiting for the right moment and all. What, you wanted a knob job first before you gave up your leverage?”
Blond hair, that was what he noticed first. A girl in Slytherin robes, with pointy features and grey eyes.
“You’re a goddamned bloody nuisance, Potter,” Draco rasped. It earned a brilliant smile from Potter, who seemed to have heard the affection in Draco’s words. And now he kissed him properly, and Draco tasted his own essence there. When they parted again he looked down, and it wasn’t without an appreciative groan that he saw, through the opening in the front of his school robes, Potter’s erection tenting his jeans.
"Of course you do, Potter," Draco chuckled. He let out a breath and lifted his hands to his chest, feeling its flatness again and marveling at how good it felt, how relieving. "Is it strange, d'you think, that it's gonna take a bit of time to get used to my real body again?"
about me!” Unable to contain himself any longer, Draco reached out and shoved at his father’s chest. His father stumbled backwards, wide-eyed, and immediately the guards threw the door open and came running inside. His father’s arms were bound behind his back, and as the guards took hold of him, so too did Harry take Draco’s elbow. “What do
“Turn around,” Harry said again, some measure of annoyance leaking into his voice this time. Draco was completely speechless. “Hands on the desk.”
Draco looks at him, chewing on his lip. He looks so vulnerable, so soft in his night clothes, one side drooping off a pale shoulder, his hair in slight disarray. In this moment Harry thinks that love is such a strange and chaotic emotion, an abstract, totally intangible thing that makes you show up on someone’s doorstep in the middle of the night begging for —
Harry climbed through the portrait hole into the Gryffindor common room at a quarter past six the next morning and found Hermione poring over an essay. He froze at the entrance, feeling absurdly as though he’d just been caught sneaking around. Hermione stared back, naked surprise on her face, followed closely by confusion, and then amused understanding.
impressive, perhaps, considering every Slytherin in their year has at some point heard Daphne complain about her kid sister, but still. Credit where credit is due. "Not that I'm complaining," continues Potter, and when he comes back around the bed he leans down and kisses Draco, just like that, with no warning whatsoever, and maybe for Daphne that's to be expected at this point but it takes Draco entirely by surprise. He freezes at first, tasting warm breath and soft lips, but when Potter starts to pull away with a frown Draco pulls him back in,
He’s about to come when Draco stops moving again, seated fully on his lap. Harry lets out a string of curses and creates bruises on his wrists where he strains and wrenches madly against the silky material binding them.
"I think that was good," said Goyle, sitting back down next to Draco and glancing quickly over at the table Daphne had returned to. Harry saw her glance back at him for just a second while Lavender, Parvati, and a few other girls giggled. "She smiled at me."
purely) out of a desire to help, he’d been unable to escape the glaringly obvious truth of the situation, which was that he’d been counting on another chat. Everything Malfoy had said to him that night in the bathroom had resonated. Most astoundingly, it had given Harry something to think about that he wouldn’t otherwise have gleaned for himself. Even Hermione didn’t quite know how to talk to Harry and she seemed to have figured out for herself that she couldn’t help him.
"Yeah, there's a few I put on the shelf there with Warming Charms," he said, pointing to them. Mrs Weasley took one down and Leo latched onto it almost instantly, fat little baby hands curling clumsily around the bottle. Still, Draco thought, for three weeks old he was quite adept.
"I'm curious about one thing, though," he says. He has Draco against the wall again. "Why didn't you just come onto me as yourself? Why Polyjuice into Daphne?"
Another pulse of shock rocks him. He stares up at Draco with his lips parted, confused at first until understanding catches up with him and his face flushes.
-ing sound of disgust in his throat. He looked completely flustered, the blush on his face having spread down his neck, and Harry was only mildly interested to note a stirring of arousal in his belly. Arrogant and intolerable as he might have been, the reality of Malfoy’s physical appeal was unavoidable, and he looked especially delicious right now, worked up on nothing more than Harry’s taunting. He supposed he really wouldn’t have minded eating Malfoy’s arse, in fact. “Anyway, seeing as this is utterly pointless —
? Merlin’s tits, Potter, you knew the greatest Dark wizard of all time was trying his best to come back to life and kill you, and the thing you feared most in the world was a
"Damn right it is," Goyle replied harshly. "Anything you got to say to Draco's my business, Potter. So go ahead and say it or piss off."
"Not like this," Harry mumbled into his skin. Draco let himself be pushed onto the bed and met Harry’s lips again when he crawled on top of him, the slightest bit overwhelmed by Harry’s fervor even though he’d gotten quite used to his penchant for rather rough sex over the last year. He felt out of breath already, chest moving shallowly as his shirt and then trousers were pulled off, leaving him in a pair of briefs under which could be seen the bulge of his erection, a sight that he realised he would need to get used to again. When Harry put his hand on it through the cotton material, Draco let his eyes slip closed and his head fell back, propped up on shaky elbows. "All right?" Harry asked — it sounded somehow genuine and teasing all at once. "You know I've never done this before."
"No, you go on," Harry said wearily. "I've only got a few inches left, I'll meet you down there in a bit. I wanna finish this."
“Get off me!” he shouted, and even he could hear the way his voice had risen to a hysterical pitch, the fear impossible to miss. This seemed to please the boy, and his hands only tightened on Draco’s wrists further, wrenching out of him another sob of stinging agony. “You’re hurting me, let go!”
, even … it was wholly out of place there and made Draco feel, if possible, even smaller than his already insubstantial height.
“I suggest you sit back down,” Harry said sharply, effectively cutting him off. Draco watched from a few feet back like he was having a particularly unrealistic dream. “Couple more seconds and that guard out there isn’t going to give a fuck who I am, and you’ll be back in your cell before you can blink twice. This may be the last time you ever see your son again, and that’s the only reason I’m doing this. For
Wide-eyed and dazed-looking, Connor seemed unable to form speech for a moment. Harry took this opportunity to chime in.
"Well I'm not scolding you, Draco," Pratchett chuckles. "My hands used to be a lot prettier if you can believe it."
The anticipated complications never arise. Not later that night, not the next day, and not throughout the following week. Daphne looks the same as ever and so does Potter, and Draco can only conclude that, miraculously, Potter must not have brought it up to her at all.
Harry snorted but didn’t reply — instead, he passed the flat of his tongue hard across Malfoy’s clenching hole, cock twitching at the sharp, musky taste of him. He groaned and tightened his grip on the fleshy globes of Malfoy’s perfect arse, holding him open and prising his hole as far open as he could. He used the tip of his tongue to trace around the rim and had to redouble his efforts when Malfoy bucked against his face.
Potter takes himself in hand, slowly wanking that thick, beautiful cock like he knows Draco enjoys watching, and maybe he does. His eyes are on Draco as he does it, squeezing and pulling and fisting under the head, using his own pre-come to ease the slide. At some point Draco thinks he might like to let Potter fuck his throat with it until his jaw is sore, but right now he needs Potter inside of him like he needs to breathe.
find Draco alone in the Slytherin common room, because Harry had woken early for Quidditch practice. Had it been the Gryffindor common room, Draco knew he would have dealt with staring and sniggering and possibly even some very lewd comments; however, seeing as this was a bunch of Slytherins, what Draco got instead was isolation. Like he had contracted some sort of communicable disease, every last one of his housemates gave him a wide berth, looking at him only when they thought
times bigger than Draco had imagined. All his breath seemed to leave his body in one shuddering gust of air. An enormous statue of Salazar Slytherin stood at the very end, mouth horrifically agape, surrounded by pillars entwined with carved wood.
been planned was the subject of the book, which was not Arithmancy, or Ancient Runes, or even Potions — it was an enormous book on hexes, and beside it, a heavily rifled-through tome on human transfiguration that had been no help at all.
Potter breaks away to remove his own trousers and pants and then settles himself between Draco's legs exactly the same as last time, only now Draco looks like himself and he knows
Harry sighed, raking a hand through his untamed hair in a gesture of frustration that always gave him away.
Part of him had half a mind to confront them about it. It irked him, especially about Pansy Parkinson — did she truly think she was that much better than Draco, even with his Dark Mark, when she'd been the one to point him out in the Great Hall, all too willing to give him up to Voldemort if it meant saving her skin? And what of Theodore Nott, whose father had been in Voldemort's inner circle just the same as Lucius Malfoy? Another part of him realised it would be pointless; they were children as much as Draco had been, as much as
“I know you do, Harry. You’re the most resilient person I’ve ever known, but that doesn’t mean you should have to endure it over and over again,
"Fuck," he hisses, snatching his hand back from the cauldron and sticking his fingers in his mouth like a five-year-old. This is the third time today he's either burned or cut himself because he's too busy brooding to pay attention. This one's worse than the others, the top of his fingers having pressed fully against the blazing hot pewter, and he can already see the skin raising.
Weasley anymore. Even the dislike was fading. He thought he might even have developed some sort of trust for this one. “Is Harry coming down?”
Wrapped up in his duvet with the curtains of his four-poster pulled shut around him, Draco shuddered. It wasn’t revulsion, as he would have hoped, but cold, confused dread. For the first time since Conway’s hex had forced him into an uncomfortable new body, he wasn’t thinking about how hyperaware he was of the weight on his chest, or the strangeness of his center of gravity having shifted to his hips; he was instead frantically searching for a reason behind this apparent madness. For that was what it felt like, knowing Harry Potter had kissed him: utter madness. As though they’d slipped unwittingly into some distant dimension.
him?" says Tracey, all scepticism — and maybe a bit of awe too. She lowers her voice further, but Draco can hear it just fine: "
When he walked out onto the Astronomy tower at a few minutes past midnight, he immediately identified Potter’s shadowy figure near the battlements, shoulders hunched where he leaned on a balustrade. It was frightfully cold, so when Draco approached him from behind and heard sniffling, he at first attributed it to a runny nose. When Potter heard him, however, and turned, Draco realised with a pang of horror that Potter had been
Dumbledore told him that even if he came back once every ten years, he would still be glad to see him.
Some time last night while he had been out having a pint with Ron and Dean Thomas, somebody had come into his London apartment and trashed the place.
When Draco was gone (and Dawlish tucked away in a corner of the office where he wasn't privy) Harry faced Narcissa and thought about how he'd testified on her behalf but hadn't actually spoken to her since the forest. His heart picked up a little at the thought, and with it the reminder that she'd risked her life that night not to save Harry, but to save her son. The one Harry had gotten pregnant and inadvertently kept from gaining back his real body yet.
“Potter!” a voice yelled, and Harry turned to see Boothby running down the corridor with his hand on his hat, looking shocked. “What in the name of
“Don’t stop,” Malfoy whimpered frantically, and this time, Harry had no plans to. He increased the speed of his thrusts and tugged relentlessly at Malfoy’s throbbing, weeping prick. “Don’t stop, oh my god, I’m
“Of course he does,” says Draco with far too much satisfaction. There’s a dreamy look on his face as he stares out over the railing, cigarette held aloft as thin curls of smoke drift up from the burning end. He’s stupidly attractive and whoever bookstore bloke is, whatever poncy fuckboy hair he’s got, he doesn’t deserve Draco.
Harry’s chest seemed to expand and he knew that if he could look at himself, he’d see a hopeless tenderness in his eyes as he raked them over Malfoy’s face. “And are we? Going to continue doing this?”
“I was in the middle of a conversation, Malfoy,” Harry snapped. “You’ve got no fucking manners, do you?”
get used to waking up next to him. He smelled wonderful, and when Draco pushed his face into Harry’s neck, he felt his belly instantly flood with warmth.
“Because I’m a girl?” Malfoy questioned sharply, but the effect was ruined by the wet quality of his voice. For a long moment, Harry didn’t answer him, and Malfoy didn’t move as he waited for one.
“I’m going down there,” he said. Granger frowned, but she didn’t argue any further. He was reluctantly impressed by this display of discretion. “I’m warning you now, if either of you tries to stop me, I’ll do what I have to do.”
In spite of himself, this statement wrenched a noise out of Draco that was half-sob and half-laugh. He planted both hands on either side of Harry’s face and pulled him into another kiss; then, with his eyebrows drawn and his heart somewhere near his throat, he pushed back Harry’s fringe and drank in the sight of a face that had been famous since he’d re-entered the Wizarding world at eleven years old, but which Draco was only recently beginning to see clearly for the first time.
could he possibly provide? It was true that Draco had grown up in a family where talking about emotional things was forbidden, where showing emotion at all was considered a weakness, and the same went for all his Slytherin mates who'd similarly been brought up in the traditional ways of Pureblood families.
, and Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter were not, in any version of reality, supposed to have feelings for one another unless it was hatred and a lust for blood.
And even though Pansy had pointed Potter out in the Great Hall during the Battle of Hogwarts, her father had never been a Death Eater, and like Blaise’s family, the Parkinsons — while deeply entrenched in pure-blood culture and tradition — had been smart enough not to align themselves publicly with the Dark Lord. Pansy’s parents had been spending their time since the end of the war loudly celebrating the Dark Lord’s defeat and donating colossal amounts of money to every likely-looking charity that might distance them from the wrong side of modern politics. They had, in fact, been one of the most prominent contributors to the rebuilding of Hogwarts.
"That's fine," Draco said. He hadn't wanted anyone in there with him anyhow, including Harry. This was quite literally as personal as anything could ever get.
Harry leaned forward and pressed their lips together in a kiss that said the things for which he couldn’t find words right now. He let himself be pulled up by the hand and stood still while Draco cast Warming Charms on both their cloaks and trousers to melt away the snow.
"My god," says Pansy. Draco can hear the hesitant acceptance in her voice. "You really are shagging him, aren't you?"
With that, he pushed himself off the chair, dropping a wink in Hermione’s and Parvati’s direction, and went to rejoin the festivities. Parvati was blushing furiously.
Instead, he opted to walk around the grounds. Hogwarts’s little corner of Scotland had officially left winter behind. The warm spring breeze that drifted across the lake filled Draco with a feeling of good things to come (warm weather always did this), and it was with a contented grin on his face that he rested his palm against his growing belly, now large enough that he’d been forced to order maternity clothing from catalogues.
“Yeah, he’s really good,” said Weasley. He nodded towards the acoustic guitar hanging on the wall; Draco had taken notice of it the first time he’d seen Harry’s flat but never paid it much mind after that, taking it for decoration, or perhaps an unused gift. “He’ll play if you ask him. He doesn’t like showing off.”
It was a bit silly to think he would have been less afraid to once again face a Hungarian Horntail than admit to Narcissa Malfoy that he had knocked up her son.
“Really, Harry?” He sat on the edge of his own bed, one leg bouncing in an obvious gesture of nerves. “I’m talking about Helstrom, aren’t I? I mean … Merlin, why’d you do it? What did you mean, you know what he did? Everyone’s been talking about it and no one seems to have a clue, but I thought you’d have at least told
Draco nearly choked on the burning liquid still traveling down his throat. When the coughing subsided, he leveled Potter with an incredulous look.
smoked that much. Goyle looks utterly blazed too, his eyes bloodshot and slitted, fingers positively caked with cheese dust from a bag of crisps.
He’d never given the jumper back, and sometimes — when the darkness was too dark, and the panic was a tight grip on his throat — he’d even wear it and let the fading smell of Potter soothe him to sleep.
“No,” said Draco immediately. He lifted his other hand to Harry’s face, his stubbled jaw he hadn’t bothered to shave lately, the faint dark circles beneath his eyes from lack of sleep. “I can handle it. I’ve just never been good at sharing, that’s all. And you know me … I do tantrums better than anyone.” Harry smiled and Draco kissed him. “I just miss you so much when you’re gone a lot.”
“Are you going to wear the Cloak?” asked Granger, indicating the silken fabric in his hands. “You should. At least at first. Until we see what’s going on.”
"I didn't even say anything," Harry said, lifting his palms in defence. "But yeah, I mean, I get it, it's a little bittersweet. I'll miss being there."
With another kiss — on his mouth this time — Draco stands up and Harry takes the opportunity to swat his arse before he walks away. Draco yelps and blushes and smacks his arm but he’s smiling, and it makes Harry’s heart even lighter than the weed does.
find it again,” Draco pushed, egging Potter on intentionally. It had, after all, been one of his greatest talents for seven years.
“Course not,” Harry snaked an arm around her waist out of habit, but his heart wasn’t in the gesture. “Everyone’s just trying to get back into the swing of things. Us included.” It hadn’t escaped his notice that this didn’t seem to have stopped Ron and Hermione from exploring their new relationship, but he didn’t bring it up. “In fact, I ... I appreciate the space you’ve given me, Ginny. Still feels like I’m trying to find my ground sometimes. Steady myself, y'know?”
Harry grits his teeth and swallows back the begging noises threatening to burst out of him. More blood rushes to his prick, turning the head a worrying purple. He wonders in a slightly hysterical, half-insane way whether he could die from this. From needing to come this badly and not being allowed to. From refusing to beg for it, even when it hurts.
Hermione's office in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement is roomy enough but certainly not large, although Draco anticipates that changing soon. She's been promoted thrice already since she started just a year after their graduation from Hogwarts, an absolute Ministry darling and well-deservedly. The Ministry has seen real, tangible change thanks to her Gryffindorian lust for justice.
In the alleyway outside the pub there’s no decent cover, so Harry uses magic to repel the rain. It’s coming down hard and the intermittent rolls of thunder are low and ominous. Harry uses a Muggle lighter to spark first Draco’s and then his own cigarette.

“It’s okay,” Draco told him quietly, shifting his hips a little and hissing. “I liked it. When you let go, I mean.” His hand moved to cup Harry’s cheek, sure that he looked the way Harry had looked before — reverent, worshipful — and found he didn’t even have it within himself to care. Maybe he
But Harry’s inherently noble nature was shining through the playfulness now. He looked highly conflicted.
“Watch it, Ron,” Harry said in a low voice. Ron’s eyes widened. “It’s not as if I’m unaware of those things. I haven’t forgotten. I could never forget. I just …” He trailed off, shrugging again. This was precisely why he’d wanted to wait — because he didn’t even have this whole thing figured out for

In truth, Harry had suspected he’d have to be the one to initiate a conversation. It wasn’t as though he planned to stay in a fight with Ron forever. And although he knew Ron had his own extremely valid reasons for being upset, Harry couldn’t help feeling like his best mate had done him a disservice by blowing up before giving him a chance to explain.
let it continue,” said Pansy. She wasn’t antagonising him, nor accusing him of anything. She looked amused, but not in a way that was at his expense. Pansy was both a twat and a fiercely good friend, the combination of which meant she would do nothing more or less than hold up a mirror and force you to look at yourself, gruesome as the experience inevitably wound up being. “Even after you realised he had feelings for you.”
almost Sorted into Slytherin," Blaise drawled, looking at Harry sceptically. "Potter, you're the shining beacon of Gryffindor, you expect us to buy that?"
They went to Gryffindor Tower. Harry had been inside Slytherin innumerable times now, yet Draco had never once set foot in the Lion’s Den. He was as morbidly interested as he was ambivalent.
“Draco …” he says, letting the name carry everything unsaid within it, his pleading and vulnerability and fear.
When he looked over at the stands, his smile was wiped away so quickly it might never have been there in the first place.
The professors didn't seem to think that defeating Voldemort was a good reason to give Harry a break, which left him exactly as bogged down by homework as the rest of his year mates, and for about a week he stopped thinking about Malfoy and Goyle and that whole situation entirely. It was madness, really, the amount of essays piling up every day, and among all the eighth-years it seemed only to be Hermione who was managing to keep up, no doubt thanks to her colour-coded schedule nobody else had the patience for.
Though neither had said it, and even though Harry suspected it wasn’t the main reason Ginny had asked, he knew that neither of them had gone up those stairs thinking they

than normal. The eighth-years have been shagging like rabbits since term started, helped along by the common room they've all been made to share, and house lines have never felt more blurry and indistinct. He knows for a fact that Blaise has been sleeping with Padma Patil for at least a month, and twice now Pansy has informed him against his will of the size of Justin Finch-Fletchley's prick.
, Draco thought he understood where the term “going into heat” had come from. His entire body felt flushed more often than not, and no matter what he used in an attempt to distract himself — books, homework, even desperately reorganizing his entire room — the memory of kissing Potter never quite departed the forefront of his mind, and it left Draco in a perpetual state of being unbearably turned on. This perhaps would fade into something much more manageable once his period had ended, but for the time being, and because he had no idea how long it would last, Draco was stuck with this utterly humiliating infatuation.
“You know, I think she got something right for once, the old bag,” Harry said, lifting his drink in a toast. Ron grinned.
The least intimidating things inside the package were a terribly feminine pair of slacks and simple blouse, and after ushering Pansy out of the room Draco dressed himself and covered it up with his school robes gratefully.
"Andromeda, you mean?" Harry asked, surprised. He'd seen her plenty of times over the summer when he'd gone to visit Teddy but she'd neglected to mention her nephew would be staying with her the final week of August, or that he'd be going back to her after Hogwarts.
lighting their way, although it wasn’t nearly as dark as the tunnel coming down had been. It was long and damp, smelled of ancient rot, and was, frankly, terrifying. Here and there Draco spotted poisonous green snakeskin which must have been shed by the Basilisk when it was still alive. His arms developed perpetual goosebumps.
“Watch who you’re calling a ferret, Scarhead,” Draco sniped back. Potter’s eyes flashed. He came closer still, and Draco stood his ground, not bothering to hide the way his breathing had increased, because — absurdly — he
When Pansy was gone, Draco put away his work and went to get ready for bed. He would have been hard-pressed to focus after that confession, and he had no intention of doing poorly on his work.
place, Malfoy. It’s a sick, twisted underground chamber that housed a monster for about ten centuries.”
Malfoy laughed lightly. "Yeah, maybe. Feels like I haven't played Quidditch in about a hundred years."
Draco rolled his eyes as he climbed off Harry’s lap; it was the best he could do to cover up the inner turmoil that statement had provoked.
At least one of Harry’s questions was answered right on the spot: he couldn’t say anything about whatever had happened down below, but it was ever so clear in a plain, button-up dress shirt and a pair of slacks that whatever hex Malfoy had been hit with, it had given him breasts along with his new face. They weren’t
, had something to do with Mr. Potter’s survival and the mark it left behind. Of course,” he chuckled, nodding his head at Potter, “I suspect Mr. Hirschkorn has reconsidered his hypothesis given the lack of any scars left behind the second time.”
He looks at the altar again, the poor sod hanging mostly naked on the cross, bloody and defeated, and Draco thinks of another thing he learned in Muggle Studies. About confession.
Malfoy nodded, clearly trying to suppress his grin. “You know, Potter, those Muggle drugs are useless.”
you, Malfoy, after everything that’s happened. But, you know … Harry’s my best mate. And even if I do think he’s too quick to forgive some people, I also trust him.”
Seamus howled with laughter and pulled Harry into a one-armed hug that was, due to their current position, more of a chokehold.
“Well, I’m glad you did.” He sat back down at the edge of the tub. After a moment’s hesitation and a sceptical look from Malfoy, he finally joined Harry at the edge, swinging his legs over the side where they looked incredibly pale and incredibly
He came up behind Draco and wrapped his arms around him, resting his chin on Draco’s shoulder. Draco let his eyes fall closed and became hyper-aware of the storm of butterflies in his stomach.
It was nearing eight in the morning, a little over two hours since he'd violently consummated this particular era of his life, that Harry found himself outside the Room of Requirement. His feet had taken him there with little effort on the part of his conscious mind — he was feeling exceedingly strange now, not hollow but a bit numb, a feeling he thought (and hoped) would wear off after he finally managed some sleep and had more time to process everything.
Harry blinked at him. He moved his gaze from Goyle's hard features to Malfoy behind him, sitting cross-legged in an armchair and watching the exchange silently. The fire threw shadows across his face that made him look a little like a skeleton. It gave Harry the chills.
“Yeah, well, I just thought it would incense you,” says Harry, grinning cheekily. Draco scowls. He knocks the pack of cigarettes off the table between them but Harry, with lightning-fast reflexes, catches it before it hits the ground. Draco rolls his eyes.
“Come find us when you’re done,” added Granger. She waved her hand around in the air until it brushed Draco, and then one small hand squeezed just below his shoulder. “Come with us, Malfoy,” she added in a whisper.
"She made it sound like I did some big thing, didn't she?" said Harry, successfully getting a wet laugh out of Draco.
Draco swallowed. Shifted beneath Harry and then gasped when he slid in even more deeply. It was what he’d needed since they had left Azkaban. What he needed before he could have a proper conversation about it, before he could start to wrap his mind fully around what he’d just done, what
"Stop, stop," Harry breathes suddenly, putting pressure on Draco's waist to still him and kissing him softly. Draco is practically vibrating with the need to come, his cock throbbing painfully between them, the friction from their sliding chests not
And before Draco had time to stop him and interrogate further, Potter was squeezing his hand and heading back into the Great Hall, where hundreds of people who thought they knew him would vie for his attention.
"Merlin, it's just a stupid bloody Potions essay," said Malfoy. "It's our NEWT year, that's what happens. Granger and I are literally
“Complication, yes, you said,” Harry broke in, and then appeared to try and rein himself back in with a deep breath. “Sorry, I … Draco, what’s the complication?”
, Potter. I’m referring, of course, to your penchant for acting like a moronic teenager every time you’re out in public these days.” Harry opened his mouth, ready to start yelling if he wasn’t allowed to throw a punch, but at the very last second managed to swallow back everything he wanted to say. Hermione was about twenty feet from them with the Israeli Minister, and she’d given him a sharp look after having spotted him with Malfoy. He could feel his nails digging into his palm and wondered if he’d broken the skin. Malfoy watched him through all of this with narrowed eyes, perhaps waiting for his outburst; a smirk touched his lips when he appeared to have decided it wasn’t coming. “Very good, Potter. You’ll want to continue exercising discretion until the Cup is over. I know the only thing that comes naturally to you is acting bullheaded and reckless, but if you embarrass the Ministry this week, there
Suddenly Harry’s hand dipped lower and he cupped Draco’s cock through his robes — half hard from the ministrations to his neck — and elicited a sharp gasp.
"No," he said. "That's a completely fruitless undertaking. In fact, it'll only make Greg more miserable when nothing comes of it."
— knowing what my purpose was. Knowing what I had to do. Focusing all my time and energy on that one thing, on
. He thought of the night in the Prefects' bath when Harry had barged in on him and convinced him to let him help, whatever that was supposed to have meant. "Can I ...?"
Potter looked suddenly uncomfortable. “That’s one of those stories for another day. The point is, I doubt that I can. And you need to speak Parseltongue to get in.”
,” Malfoy drawled, but the pink on his cheeks remained and Harry even thought he saw a smile somewhere in there. “If you want me to vomit before we accomplish anything here then you’re on the right track.”
“It —” He looked back and forth between Potter’s eyes, trying to think of something to say, but in the end, he found that lying to Potter’s face was too difficult. “I don’t know his name,” he settled on finally, resolving that this was, after all, the truth.
“You’re a fucking deviant,” Draco informs him. Harry laughs against his neck and tightens his grip, wandlessly adding lube to the equation and making his strokes longer, teasing him and drawing him helplessly towards the edge. He mouths wetly along the skin above and below the velvet, then noses it out of the way and presses his tongue to the warm skin. He tugs at the back again, more tightly this time, and that finally does it. Draco whimpers and then gasps and then comes all over Harry’s hand. Harry works him through it, moving his lips lazily along Draco’s flushed throat, ignoring his own aching arousal.
"That's hilarious, I was thinking the same thing earlier," Harry told her, less surprised than he might have been. He and Hermione were often on a similar page, if not the very same one. "Maybe I'll owl McGonagall, see if she'd mind if we stopped by this week before the students go back."
“Why do you care?” he asks again. In Potter’s unnervingly green eyes he sees the same unbearable tenderness that’s been there all year. Maybe longer. He doesn’t really like to think about it.
“I hope you rot in there, you son of a bitch!” Draco cried shrilly, tugging weakly at the arm Harry was holding, still focused on the sight of his dad being led away. “You never fucking loved me!”
He was sick of being treated with kid gloves, like even a mention of the war would trigger him, like he needed to be handled as though he’d shatter into a million pieces any moment as soon as the topic was broached.
“S'pose this means we’re not dating anymore, does it?” said Harry, lifting an eyebrow as he surveyed the flat, trying to spot anything they’d missed. Hermione finished straightening the clock that sat on top of his mantelpiece and then turned to look at him.
Feeling extremely awkward and trying not to think about the fact that he had been discussing this very child with Theo not so long ago, Draco handed the picture back silently. He’d never seen Potter so emotionally vulnerable, and for the first time in a while he remembered what Potter had once been telling him in the prefects’ bathroom, about not sleeping, about being plagued by the war so often he couldn’t escape it.
Harry didn’t bother saying anything else, and Malfoy didn’t bother waiting anyhow. His eyes found Malfoy’s arse as he sauntered away, a smirk twitching at the corner of his mouth. Shagging that contemptuous sneer off his face was unrealistic, maybe, but
He thought it wasn’t just Malfoy, though. He thought there was something to this, the sex-with-a-bloke thing … but he also thought it
“You think that’s real, then, do you, Draco?” he said after a moment; there was a mean gleam in his eyes that sent a shiver of revulsion through Draco’s body. “You think Potter here likes you for more than your perky new tits and a place to put his cock? There’s not a bloke in this school who hasn’t thought about fucking you since you got hexed —”
, yet it's enough to make Draco's toes curl. His nails sink into the heated skin of Potter's shoulders, curled around them like a lifeline.
With a deep, steadying breath she stood up and took his head gently in her hands, pulling him in to kiss his forehead. He let his eyes close.
She was clutching a handkerchief in her lap, and when she looked at Draco, promptly lifted it to her eyes and let out a great, devastating sob that made his stomach roll horribly. Tears sprang to his eyes before he could figure out a way to stop them.
Draco woke up at a quarter after nine Sunday morning, groggy and exhausted and with itchy red eyes, but feeling quite content all the same. Maybe it would have been more prudent to keep that contentment at bay considering what — or rather,
Draco laughed wetly and got up to hug her again, unable to get enough of that special brand of comfort only a mother could offer.
"You don't want something you can control," Harry says in a low voice against his ear. Draco shudders and lets his eyes fall closed. "You want something that drives you fucking mad now and then."
Hot tears dripped steadily down his cheeks and clung to his chin; there were so many emotions roiling inside of him that he couldn’t pick them apart to analyse them individually, giving him the sensation that he was about three seconds away from puking. He swallowed this back determinedly and nodded, squeezing her hands hard.
“Why?” Malfoy demanded croakily. Harry slipped his hands down from Malfoy’s waist to the swell of his arse and squeezed, pulling their hips together. He could feel Malfoy’s hard cock slide against his own and groaned into the juncture of his neck and shoulder.
Harry’s insides squirmed when he thought about how little sleep she must have been getting since Lavender died — if it had been Ron or Hermione, Harry was unsure whether he’d have been able to move on from it at all.
A smirk twitched at Harry’s lips and he bent forward, one arm like a pillar on the side of Draco’s head, the other gripping his cock at the base. Draco’s heart started pounding so hard he could feel it in his fingertips. He bit back a gasp at the first touch, Harry’s cock gliding neatly between his pussy lips, bumping against his clit each time Harry rocked his hips forward, coating his cock with Draco’s juices.
“Thank you, Mummy,” he said into her neck, and sagged against her when he felt her hand card through his hair. “I … I want to tell you something else, actually.”
?” against his skin. His heart pounded. Words danced at the tip of his tongue, careening back and forth, until he finally forced them out: “Do you really think you can forgive me?”
“What?” Weasley looked thrown by the sudden change in topic, but comprehension dawned almost immediately. “Oh. These, you mean?” He lifted his right arm and Draco nodded. “Er — they’re from the Department of Mysteries, when we were in there fifth year. There was this room with a bunch of brains in a tank. Wrapped these long tentacles around me. Memories, I think. I hardly remember it.”
,” he called out, pleased with the wide eyes Harry turned on him. But then suddenly they were alive with delight, and the smirk that formed on his face made Draco’s pussy throb with want.
“Oi! The man just got dumped, Hermione, let him live a little tonight,” said Dean, to which Harry laughed and Hermione merely scowled. “What’s he gonna do, go streaking through London?”
"Well I can't do this anymore," said Ron, shoving his chair back from the table. "I'll finish it tonight, it's not even
“I was thinking for Ron’s birthday,” said Harry, looking at once moronic and attractive holding his cigarette with his thumb and index finger like it was a joint, “he’s always threatening to eat his body weight in things. I wanna get him, like … I dunno, his body weight in Chocolate Frogs or something. How would we calculate, like, how much his body weight would be in Chocolate Frogs?”
pretentious when you act like this,” said Granger. Weasley snorted. Harry glared at her. “Just play for him, won’t you? And us too – it’s been ages.”
When Ron came back, he handed Harry his second firewhisky, slid into his side of the booth, and swallowed a mouthful of his own. Harry mirrored him, steeling himself.
you seemed tetchy,” he muttered, hands dropping to Draco’s hips. “Oasis really does it for you, huh?”
"You're lying!" hisses Tracey. Usually Draco would try to drown them out but the disbelief in her voice has reluctantly snagged his interest. He pauses his quill, eyes still on his parchment though his attention has shifted.
you were lying about hating grand gestures — I'm not going to Hogsmeade with you for Valentine's Day, Potter. It's not happening."
Perhaps “somehow” wasn’t accurate, though. It was clear now why Potter had apparently been gone all weekend, for there was only one way Lucius Malfoy’s sentence could have been reconsidered, and that was by recommendation of the Saviour of the Wizarding World.
But he didn’t have time right now to start going down that path, not when he needed to be one hundred percent focused if they wanted to win this match. Kenny Helstrom may have had his arrogant opinions, but with or without Cedric Diggory on their team Hufflepuff was strong this year. Peakes and Coote had dropped in on their training sessions at Harry’s request, and the information they had brought back was nothing to be taken lightly.
Harry smiled. He buried his face in Draco's neck and started the movement of his hips again. "I love you," he whispered, peppering kisses along his skin. "I love you."
And then suddenly his legs were being lifted over Harry’s shoulders and the tip of Harry’s prick was nudging at his arsehole; Draco’s head fell back against the pillows, wet mouth parted, letting out helpless, panting breaths as he stared up at Harry.
“But, Draco,” Pansy lilted, and he knew from the tone of her voice he’d hate whatever came out of her mouth next. Indeed: “Your legs would look so
“The Blacks’ old house-elf, yeah,” Harry nodded. “Sirius left him to me when he died, so I got him instead of your Aunt Bellatrix.”
"Me too," Harry said into his mouth. On the heels of that he seemed to remember something and his pace slowed, stilling deep inside Draco and meeting his eyes purposefully. "I love you," he said, making Draco's chest contract with emotion. His hand slid to the back of Harry's head and gripped his uncooperative hair.
hex you,” Potter said. He snatched the pot back from Draco and set it aside, making room for him to be able to back Draco up against one of the workbenches. Draco looked up at him and felt his veins shiver with anticipation of …
And then Potter’s warm hand was on his cheek instead of his chest, and Draco had never been so hungry for contact before. They came together like plates colliding, like divers coming up from the bottom of the ocean, and the familiar slide of Potter’s tongue sweeping along the velvety lining of his mouth was sweeter than any wine he’d ever tasted. His hands clutched frantically at Potter’s cloak, he gasped brazenly for air every time their lips parted, and then dove back in without an ounce of shame. Potter’s hands were vices on his back and his waist, holding him so tightly Draco might have been afraid of being snapped in half had he the brain power to worry about anything other than drinking his fill.
“Because I’m scared to, Potter,” Draco snapped before Potter had finished getting out the last word. “Merlin’s bloody beard, once again, not everyone is Saint Potter, saving people from a raging Fiendfyre without a bloody scratch on his psyche.” He paused, huffing out a breath, ignoring his flaming cheeks. Potter looked baffled, and mixed into it was a clear shine of concern in his eyes. This wasn’t the first time Draco had seen that in the last couple weeks, and yet he still wasn’t used to it. To being looked at by Potter not like he was an enemy to be defeated, but like someone worth saving.
been something going on between himself and Potter. Now, all this served to do was both startle him and remind him of a painful truth: as of two weeks ago, there
“Right,” said Harry. He wasn’t wrong, which made him wonder why he wanted to do it so much. But then Malfoy — maybe seeing something on Harry’s face he didn’t like — tightened his hand again and started stroking, long, slow movements from base to tip, as if to distract him. “Then I wonder why you’re bothering with all this foreplay? Maybe we should just get to the fucking.”
“You’ve been talking to him,” Hermione said slowly, sounding like she’d just had a theory confirmed that she hadn’t
She appeared to compose herself as best she could. "Do you love my son?" she asked without any preamble.
he would now get a break, that his body preemptively started to go boneless; however, although those thick, merciless fingers were pulled out of him, his hole was instantly stuffed again with Harry’s tongue, and Draco let out of a wanton sound of helplessness that was muffled by his hand just in time. Harry’s fingers were brutal where they dug into his thighs and his tongue was stabbed in and out of Draco’s hole relentlessly, sucking out a copious amount of his fluids and pushing spit back in its stead. Shaky hand clenching and unclenching in his useless Potions essay, Draco was left with no other option than to let it happen, because clearly Harry had an agenda he wasn’t giving up on.
“Oh, shut up, Hermione,” Harry said, but a smile had crept onto his face as well. His heart was too full to be anything but good-humoured. He’d replayed the whole thing in his head several dozen times since he’d woken up, snogged an adorably half-asleep Draco senseless, and then left for Gryffindor Tower, and yet it remained difficult to believe he had actually
“Turn around,” he said, nudging Draco’s leg off the table. Draco obeyed shakily, stomach swooping when he finally got a good look at Harry’s face and saw everything he’d expected there, with all the unbearable intensity Draco had come to expect from him. Harry helped him up onto the desk and when he’d manoeuvred himself length-wise, Harry pulled him by the legs to the very edge. He was glad for this shift — he wanted to see Harry’s face.
"Fuck me again," Draco said. He let go in order to start working at Harry's jeans and the pants beneath them, trying to tug them off his hips.
It was a phrase he absolutely could not unstick from the inside of his head. Was he floundering? It seemed almost as though the war itself had been a spectacular tsunami, washing over everything Harry had ever known — but on the other side, in the aftermath, he looked around and saw that everyone else had dried off and begun rebuilding their lives. Everyone except Harry, whose clothes were still dripping wet.
He’d never have let Draco do this normally — it’s hard for him, and not in that work-through-it-and-you’ll-be-better-for-it kind of hard, all it does is make him tense and angry — but he can see the slight mania in Draco’s eyes and the fear and desperation, and it’s all of that plus the hectic flush on his cheeks that convinces Harry not to fight it when Draco shoves him down onto the bed and points his wand and suddenly Harry’s wrists are bound to the headboard.
"Look," he says with a forced calm, "I don't know what this is, I really fucking don't, but clearly something's wrong and I feel like it's my fault." Draco looks away again, unable to face all that very real guilt and worry in Harry's eyes. He knows he's not lying, not being chivalrous or dramatic — he truly believes he's done something wrong. And it's only Harry who could make that sort of unaffected, utterly genuine integrity seem charming in the most heartbreaking way. "Give me
"Can I ask you something?" he said, breaking the sticky silence of the air around them twenty minutes after they'd finished fucking. They should have been back in the common room already, but neither had been capable of tearing himself out of bed to start getting dressed. They were becoming lazy about hiding things — Harry knew it, but he hadn't said anything about it yet.
Hermione had tried talking to him again, but it hadn't been all that much more successful than her first attempt. Mostly, Harry thought, this was due to Goyle's presence the second time around: he'd glared at Hermione so relentlessly that she'd given up after just a couple minutes.
Harry’s sentence broke off when Malfoy pushed the larger boy’s chest in response to the wand that was being held on him, though it didn’t do much more than startle the other Slytherin and put an angrier look on his face. “Well I
goodness of your utterly selfless heart? Or are you exactly as curious as everybody else is, but have yourself convinced that the
Malfoy was making the most delicious gasping sounds each time Harry pounded into him, his cock hard again and beading pre-come at the tip. He seemed to have figured out that Harry wasn’t going to let him touch himself, because he wasn’t even trying. At the edge of his own orgasm, Harry waited until he felt Malfoy start shuddering and shaking beneath him to pull out all the way. This earned him a high, mewling sound of protest out of the blond.
“You look so good when you come,” Harry said, warm hands sliding obsessively up and down Draco’s sides. On his right hand, Draco could feel the wetness of his pussy on Harry’s fingers. It was shockingly arousing. “Not that you don’t always look good, but that was so fucking hot.”
“Go ahead, say it,” Harry bit out. He knew the word she was dancing around — it had been used in conjunction with his name for months now in the media, ever since some sneaky, pathetic reporter had stalked him long enough to get a candid of him hitting a joint, and then sold it to the
It could have been comical the way Harry followed his movement as he slid down the door to the ground, except it wasn’t. It was infuriating, actually, and felt at once like more than he could possibly handle and exactly what he needed. His forehead and his hands went back to the wood, bracing himself as Harry, kneeling behind him, continued fucking his beautiful, merciless fingers and stimulating Draco’s overworked prostate.
Having refrained from telling his mother still, it was Harry’s gold that bought his clothing. He detested letting him do so, yet knew he had no other choice. Even Hermione had offered to pitch in, but that was where he drew the line. What she
“You what?” Draco goads him. He replaces his mouth with his hand again, sliding it leisurely through lube and his own spit and Harry’s pre-come, little spurts of it continuously dribbling down its turgid length. “Sounded suspiciously like you were about to say please …”
After running to the toilet and seeing that there didn’t seem to be any blood anywhere, he returned to his bed with his heart in his throat. He hadn’t the first clue how menstruation worked, when he would start bleeding, how he should deal with it when he did. Yet he was reluctant to bring it up to Pansy — he didn’t think he could bear it. Not yet. Anyway, she was still being cross with him for snapping at her on Monday. Only a Slytherin, he marveled, could hold a petty grudge with so much determination.
He squeezed Harry's hand and swallowed around the extra saliva building in his mouth. "Fine," he said simply. "Okay. Nervous"
And then Potter pulls back, and suddenly Draco feels one of his hands sliding up to Daphne's slim neck —
She let out a hefty sigh and dropped her hands back to her lap. “To be perfectly honest with you, Draco … the way things are right now, given the political climate and the ridicule that comes with our name, knowing that Potter has a reason to look out for you sets my mind at ease. He does tend to successfully protect the things he cares about.”
He continues rocking his hips into Draco at a steady, unhurried pace, the strokes getting longer by slow increments, allowing Draco the time to get used to the sensation and lose himself in it. Every drag of Potter's cock against his spongy inner walls is exquisite torture, each deep press back inside his tight body leaves Draco breathless with desire. He wants to be devoured, consumed. Potter seems to understand that, because he indulges him readily.
"No, he's just ... lost right now," said Malfoy. "It'll be fine, he'll get past it. I'm much more worried about everyone else."
Draco opened his mouth, but Harry pulled out suddenly and pressed back in, and instead Draco let out a soft moan, bracing himself again on the desk.
"And you think I do?" Draco rolled his eyes and, with a sigh, sat down on the edge of the mattress. "Yeah, it helps. It gets me out of my head for a while."
He does things like bringing Draco tea in bed in the mornings, not because he’s trying to be nice or chivalrous or anything like that – he just
But he doesn’t want to do what Potter has endlessly told him he must do. He cannot bear the weight of it, it will kill him, he knows it. And if he dies now, with his soul still in shatters, still burdened with all his sins, then what?
"At the end," he clarifies, and flicks the finished cigarette out the window. He reaches for another. "The last six months we couldn't go a day without bickering about something."
“Potter, wait,” Draco breathed, pulling back as much as he was able to, his hand pausing its movement and squeezing the slippery head of Potter’s cock. This drew a gasp out of him, and Draco bit his lip to hide a satisfied smile. “Go sit down. Over there.”
"What is there to talk about exactly? The fact that we clearly don't belong in a relationship?" He pulls as much smoke as he can tolerate into his lungs and holds it there a few seconds, letting his eyes water. It burns when he blows it out. "Anyway he's obviously not too bothered about it."
"Hang on, hang on," says Potter suddenly, pulling his fingers out and leaving Draco feeling horribly empty. "Let me get —" He doesn't finish his thought, ripping off his shirt and then starting to help Draco out of his robes and the uniform under it. The robes stay beneath them on the bed, but the shirts and the bra are tossed aside and land on the floor. The knickers come off too, although Potter leaves the skirt on (the perverted
“You had a good time today, right?” he asked, nuzzling beneath Draco’s jaw and inhaling the scent of him deeply. “You weren’t just humouring me?”
kidding, and if you promise to stop whingeing long enough for me to get my mouth on you, I’ll repair the bloody shirt for you later.”
It turned out okay, though. He waited at the house with Teddy and when Andromeda, Narcissa, and Draco showed up, Harry even managed a small smile for her. She looked greatly the worse for wear but definitely still lucid. He remembered what Sirius had told him about what had kept him sane in there and wondered what grim thought Narcissa had held onto the last year and a half.
Ron couldn’t be there — that was Harry’s one condition with himself. As much as he hated to keep a secret from him, Harry knew perfectly well that Malfoy’s name alone would make Ron irrational, and for now, while Harry still didn’t know whatever
“I love you,” Harry told him again. He was trembling, and he looked more vulnerable than Draco had ever seen him, like he would have gladly bled himself dry if Draco had asked it of him. “God, I
going to be me,” Harry says. His voice has dropped a register. He leans down again, and this time he kisses the apple of Draco’s cheek. “You’d better get used to the idea, because I
He's never actually used it before and the transformation is extremely uncomfortable. The result is even stranger, particularly the whole being-a-girl part of it. He can feel the weight of Daphne's modest tits, feel the absence of a prick between his legs, the way his hips suddenly have a natural sway when he walks. Not to mention her long blonde hair that he can feel cascading down his back. Just last week he'd managed to perform a highly discreet Doubling Charm on Pansy's uniform — Daphne's too perceptive and would have noticed — and he slips into that with utmost care, plus a bit of difficulty when it comes to the brassiere.
"It's fine," Malfoy said quietly. He tucked a piece of hair behind his ear, and when the movement caused the sleeve of his shirt to fall slightly Harry could see the very tip of the Dark Mark against his pale skin.
“He wasn’t, though,” Harry said, grin widening impossibly. “He was sort of irked, told me I couldn’t handle things delicately, but he wasn’t
Ron choked on his firewhiskey and Goyle sprayed some of his all over Crookshanks, who was in his lap. The latter leapt down, looking highly affronted.
“There you are!” Hermione said when she saw him, looking incredibly exasperated. Kingsley shot Harry a wink, and Harry smirked at him in return. He glanced once at Malfoy, who lifted an arrogant eyebrow, and then looked away again with every intention of pretending he didn’t exist. Fancourt grabbed Harry’s hand in his turn and shook it once, firmly, with a jovial little “Good to see you, Harry, good to see you!” With those greetings (or lack thereof) out of the way, Hermione directed Harry’s attention to the Israeli wizards. “Harry, this is Moshe Mizrachi, the Israeli Minister for Magic. Minister, this is Harry Potter, our Seeker and Captain.” There was the inevitable lift of eyes to take in his scar, and Harry only just managed not to scowl. “And this is Noam Peretz,” she went on, indicating a second wizard, “their Department Head for International Wizarding Relations. Mr Peretz, Harry Potter.”
An hour later, as he and Ron were about to leave the common room to head to the pitch, Harry told him he'd forgotten his Quidditch gloves and went back up the boys' staircase. He stopped at the door to the Slytherin dorms and knocked, tapping his fingers against his leg as he waited, and finally Draco opened the door, looking meek.

about stuff. But we have another eight months to do the talking. We have a lot of time to start preparing ourselves.”
“Fair enough, I suppose.” Malfoy yawned again, the fingers of one hand idly tracing a scar he’d found on Harry’s chest. “As long as you win us the Cup, you have my permission to make an arse of yourself however you see fit.”
It was bad enough Draco hadn’t grown any taller than most of the girls in their year, but for Potter to have reached nearly six feet was just absolutely indecent. And not only that, but his shoulders were a hell of a lot broader than they had any right to be.
,” said Draco. He heard Potter chuckling as they both crawled under the duvet, Draco without bothering to grab his shirt. Potter was instantly hovering above him, one hand next to Draco’s head, bringing their mouths together wetly. He allowed himself to be kissed breathless, utterly overwhelmed by how raw and how
Hermione's internship at the Ministry had turned into a real job and Harry thought it was likely she and Ron would start trying for a baby themselves as soon as they felt settled. It was strange, really, to realise they'd made it to a point in their lives where that was a possibility, instead of just a bleak hope for the future if they ever managed to get rid of Voldemort.
Potter made a rumbling sound deep in his throat that was far too reminiscent of a growl. His grip on Draco’s hips became painfully tight, but Draco hardly noticed, for Potter had pressed himself close enough that his thigh had slipped between Draco’s legs, rubbing against him where he was so
“Hermione agrees with you,” he said instead, doing up his own robes and adjusting the watch on his wrist. “Come to that, so do Ron and I, but for some reason we never dropped it. S’pose it’s better than Arithmancy or Ancient Runes, though.”
, because Hermione says it latched itself onto my chest and she couldn't get it off me when I was passed out. Left me with this.”
since I saw him staring at that picture of your parents at the Halloween Ball and made the most endearing comment about how you must have gotten your green eyes from your mum. As I said, I
“Maybe it is the school,” said Harry conversationally. Draco could hear him opening his robes and unzipping his flies and a moment later he felt Harry’s prick, hot and stiff, dragging against his arse. Then there were fingers again, only this time they were slicked with lube when Harry pressed three of them unceremoniously inside, making Draco whimper. “Being back here together, I mean,” Harry added. His fingers curled and scissored inside him, stretching him open and slicking him up, and when he pulled out and fisted his cock a few times Draco could feel the movement, feel his knuckles moving, before he pressed the head to Draco’s hole and started sinking inside.
Without allowing himself too much time to think about it, he picks them up and puts them into a pocket in his robes.
He’d been given a private room for the time being. Leaving him in the boys’ dorm was unthinkable and switching him to the girls’ seemed not to have sat well with McGonagall either. Draco, of course, hadn’t complained. He’d have given anything for a private room the last seven years he’d gone to school here — all it had taken was being changed into a bloody woman to get it.
When he went up to the Gryffindor dorm he found Ron snoring loudly with his arm dangling over the side of his bed, having never pulled his four-poster closed. He grinned at the sight and went about changing quietly into a different set of clothes, glad he wouldn't have to explain his absence overnight. He wanted Ron to have plenty of food in his stomach when he got this news, just so he was in the best possible mood.
"I'd be shocked if you weren't," she said kindly and reached out to take Draco's other hand a moment. "I can't begin to tell you how moved I am by your growth, by the resiliency you've shown, the internal strength. You've been through so much, not only with the potion but a pregnancy, having a baby. A
And now he finally did look up, and Potter’s eyes were fluorescent with tears, greener than Draco had ever seen them before.
about it,” she said, sounding anxious. He could see her silently making up her mind, although the way she bit her lip told him she was going against her better judgment. “Honestly, Harry, I … I
“I’ve moved on, Ron,” Harry said, his voice a strained calm as he tried very hard to reign his emotions back in. “The war is over. I don’t have the energy to hate
Granger eyed him another moment and then went back inside, shutting the door behind her. Draco only had to wait a minute before it was opening again, and this time Harry came out. The sight of him made Draco’s heart feel tender and sore.
He noticed these things with a sort of clinical detachment, not proud of himself for the size of his arms but rather noting it as a fact: he’d always been a little bit scrawny, and now puberty was changing that. An interesting observation and not much more.
the battle which had raged inside those walls and on the grounds surrounding it last May, he might not have known anything had happened at all. In spite of the sadness which gripped his heart at the sight, he was filled simultaneously with an overwhelming sense of gratitude, and for the first time in a
"Well I tried, at least," said Harry, opening the greenhouse door and letting Hermione and Ron pass through before him. "I can't do anything if Goyle won't let me."
“I want to know how that seventh-year knew a fucking hex like that,” Harry said, chiming in for the first time in a while. He’d been deep in thought ever since he’d seen Malfoy in the entrance hall, the situation holding onto his attention like some sort of particularly nasty Devil’s Snare. It was all anybody else could talk about as well.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione all took off on the day of the appointment and came with him. His mum wasn't allowed to leave the manor, and they'd be visiting her directly after.
The entrance was guarded by a portrait of an enormous woman in a horrible, gaudy dress of whom Draco had heard tell but never actually seen.
— before two fingers were being stuffed inside his pussy, and Draco shivered apart from the inside out. His orgasm tore across him with brutal intensity, whiting out his vision and leaving him completely boneless as Harry continued to pump into his arse and finger his cunt.
Ron nodded vigorously. “Course we can. Think you might want to chat over a drink at The Three Broomsticks? Hermione’s said she’s not going today, got too much studying she wants to do.” Ron’s eye roll made Harry feel like they were right back in the old days, and it tugged a genuine laugh out of him that felt immeasurably good.
“Say it,” Harry breathed into his ear. Malfoy whimpered. “I know you wanna come again. I’ll make it so good for you. Just
“Before the manor’s … occupation,” he says, “we had this clock in the drawing room. It was destroyed. There were different locations written where the numbers usually go. ‘Home’ and ‘work’ and ‘school,’ that sort of thing.”
Harry turned his head to look at Draco, meeting his eyes. Draco lifted onto his elbow, pale eyebrows dipping.
“Potter, I already came,” he whined, wriggling his hips to get away from the sensation, which was just this side of too much while he was still sensitive.
“Well that’s the idea,” said Harry. His voice was full of that same witty and well-meaning sarcasm Draco liked so much, even when it made him feel like punching him. Snatches of the song came back to him, Harry’s voice when he sang it, the expert shifting of his fingers where they pressed and plucked at the strings like he was making love to them. It was all so very
“Yeah,” said Harry, nodding. He didn’t elaborate, for it felt to him like this might be one of those times where he didn’t
Thursday afternoon Potter drops him a casual "All right, Malfoy?" as he passes him in the common room, which puts a look on Weasley's face that at least lets Draco know he hasn't said anything to his friends either.
"Right," Harry said. His voice was deep and scratchy, the hand that had fallen to Draco's hip squeezing with a possessive force. He pecked Draco on the lips again before moving back. "How are ... how are you feeling?"
"I love you," he decided to say out loud, opening his eyes and pushing Harry's fringe off his forehead. He was still wearing his glasses (stupid, charming tosser) and Draco pulled those off, wanting nothing between him and those green eyes. He lifted his neck and Harry met him in a kiss even as his hips moved, plunging in and out of Draco in a not quite steady rhythm.
The latter briefly shifted to the back of his mind, however, when the former walked into the pub ahead of a nameless, dark-haired bloke who was holding the door for him.
“Weasley,” Draco said, still looking down. He could feel Potter’s eyes on him. It seemed strange, foreign, that Potter wasn’t running away, ashamed to be caught like this. Draco knew with every ounce of certainty he would have run. “I … ran into him today between lessons. He told me I’d find you up here.”
“I’m not laughing at you,” he said gently, and tangled their fingers together, lifting them slowly above Malfoy’s head to press them against the pillows. “I was just … startled by how much I like you.”
"Yes, all right, yes, he's quite ... quite large," she says. And Draco can't help it — he turns his head just so, just enough to get a look at her face, and he's stunned to see that she's pink-cheeked and misty-eyed and grinning, and her gaze is on Potter on the other side of the room. Potter, for his part, seems completely oblivious to the discussion happening about his cock not twenty feet from where he's sitting.
Once again he began trying to pat it down. It was pointless, but Harry didn't stop him. He rather liked how it felt.
Three beers in and having only that afternoon been reminded of the sort of passion Malfoy could inspire in him, Harry thought it was actually rather
Draco stayed silent a moment, thinking. Considering his words. "I know you've told me a million times you're still going to feel the same way about me after," he said quietly, lifting his knees and hugging them to his chest. It was still novel to be able to do that again. "And I don't think ... I don't think you'd leave me. Or Leo. I've gotten to know you too well the past year to ever be capable of convincing myself of that anymore." Harry stayed exactly where he was, listening intently, not interrupting, a picture of earnestness and patience. "But I still don't think you can possibly know how you'll feel about me that way until it happens. And, Harry, I just need us to be prepared for you to ... I don't know, to not be attracted to me anymore. I know you're going to argue it's impossible, that it won't happen, but I
Draco had sent a letter to his mother, and the one he had received back had been especially painful to read. She was clearly trying very hard not to sound as miserable as she was, but her words hid nothing. He could imagine her wandering around that enormous, empty estate alone, unable to leave, watched day and night by Aurors outside the perimeter.
"Then I don't see the issue," said Harry, leaning back on his elbows. "It's not like we have to tell the school we're together, or anyone other than Ron and Hermione and Goyle for that matter. As if they don't already
demanding," Daphne said, flashing a smile around at them. "You've always seemed so good at keeping up with everything, Hermione."
"Oh, shit, look," Ron cut him off, gesturing over to Malfoy and Hermione, where the former had suddenly sprung up from his seat when Lavender and a few other girls sat down nearby. Looking almost panic-stricken, he went off towards the spiral staircase leading up to the boys' dormitories and disappeared, leaving an obviously confused Hermione in his wake. After a moment she got up and came back over to them.
“Right,” Potter said quietly, nodding, an indecipherable look of contemplation on his face. “But she … your mum, I mean … she’d never … that is to say, she’d never kick you out or anything, would she? Because of this?”
“Yeah, well, I realised at some point,” Draco explains with a modest shrug that’s uncharacteristic of him. “And every time I thought about bringing it up I got all panicked and convinced myself I should just leave it be and let you move on and we’d be better as friends. And I thought …” He frowns at Harry deeply. “I kind of thought we had an understanding.”
“Believe me, Malfoy — Hermione will find him and sort him out, and when she does, he’s going to come back on his hands and knees begging you to forgive him. He might be the most hard-headed prat in the bloody world sometimes, but when he realises he’s made a mistake, he doesn’t try and worm his way out of it.” An expression came over Weasley’s face now, and had Draco not known better, he might have even said it was compassion. “When I first heard about this thing between the two of you, I thought, y’know, that he just liked the way you looked. I thought that
Keeping a safe distance, Draco surveyed Weasley with narrowed eyes, thinking back suddenly to an encounter with Granger many months ago, in a girls’ toilet near their Defence classroom. The first time Draco had gotten his period, and what was it Granger had said to him? Something about Weasley not knowing, how Weasley would have gone into shock, and burning that bridge when they came to it.
Potter stares at him, but then he stands up finally. His jeans are damp from the grass and Draco gets caught up in looking at them for a second, those water stains on his knees and shins, before tearing his eyes away, back to the lake.
"Well that's good," said Pomfrey, "that's very good. That jinx ate right through most of your skin, it's a good thing Miss Granger thought to knock you out. It'll be a bit of a rough night ahead of you but you'll be fine by morning." She set a potion down on his bedside, caught sight of the apprehension on his face, and he swore he saw her mouth twitch with a smile. "It's not nearly as bad as Skele-Gro," she said. "Skin is much easier regrown than bones."
“When do I change it?” he asked softly. He saw surprise register in Granger’s eyes, but she did a good job of covering it up.
“I don’t know,” he says. He holds his stomach and bends forward, letting the rain pound his back, heavier still. There’s a flash of light and he counts to three and an earth-shattering crack of thunder makes the ground beneath them shudder. All he can smell, all he can hear or feel is the rain, and then a sudden warmth on the back of his neck where Potter’s hand is. His face is suddenly close, too.
For a moment Harry was stunned, but then a crazy idea occurred to him: what if she just wanted to be around Goyle? This seemed to be Hermione's thinking as well, because suddenly she was very enthusiastic.
“Only at first,” Harry assured him. “It’ll get easier. But yes, it takes a lot of energy to pull it off, especially a fully corporeal Patronus.”
"I want him to know love," she said. "I want him to know the joys of parenthood. I also want him to return to his real body, when the time comes."
“He’s not ‘some bully,’ Ron,” Harry said, a little too sharply. Ron’s eyes narrowed. “Helstrom was getting handsy, and if Malfoy hadn’t punched him in the face he might’ve got around to doing a lot worse than feeling him up.”
“Sort of,” he said quietly, avoiding her eyes. “He was trying to make something out of nothing. He was just making a point, trying to guilt me, I don’t even think he meant it.”
“I’ll stay here and wait for you, then,” he breathed. One calloused thumb stroked the skin beneath Draco’s pyjama top. “Whatever you need. Tell me what’ll help.”
“You’re unreal,” Harry said reverently, leaning over him to sweep some of the hair away from the back of his neck and press a kiss to the warm skin there. Malfoy mewled and arched back into him, but Harry stopped him with a firm hand on his lower back.
— as her eyes dipped and scanned Harry’s naked torso, could even see the telltale shimmer of arousal light up her eyes for a moment before she blinked and it was gone. “I … I didn’t realise … I’ll just …” She hitched her thumb over her shoulder, indicating what she apparently could not formulate into words.
“That’s because he’s good with his hands,” Draco says, bringing his lips to Harry’s cheek again where Harry can feel him grinning.
He started up a tedious rhythm, pressing in deep and then pulling out just as slow, savouring every sensation, every little nuance as Malfoy opened up for him and let some of his uptight façade fade away. His eyes kept fluttering shut despite an obvious effort not to let that happen, something which tugged strangely at Harry’s chest. His nails dug into Harry’s back each time his prostate was grazed.
"Draco?" came Penbroke's voice. He blinked dazedly and looked up at her. "Can you tell me how you're feeling?"
, biting harshly down on his lip, Draco can feel Potter line up and start pushing inside. It's nothing like his two fingers, the stretch is significant and painful and it feels incredible. He squeezes his thighs around Potter's waist, pushing some of Daphne's long hair off his sweaty forehead and then bracing himself with his hands on Potter's broad shoulders. He can feel Potter watching him but can't find the courage to hold his stare, and anyway it feels so
He returns to the kitchen and comes back out with his worn Quidditch duffel looped over his shoulder. He's effortlessly handsome in his dumb Muggle band T-shirt and his faded denims, dark red shoes he calls '
this." He swallowed hard, heart beating uncomfortably fast and he could feel the pulse of it in his temples. "I need you to acknowledge the possibility."
“Can I take your shirt off?” he mumbled against Malfoy’s lips, his hand squeezing gently and eliciting another breathy whimper.
“You saw Theo,” Draco gasped suddenly, crying out when he felt Harry’s fingers slipping over his pussy, his thumb and forefinger finding and squeezing his swollen clit even as he sped up the pace of his hips.
“Well, well, well,” she lilted as Harry took a chair beside hers, halfway between frowning and laughing. “How was Slytherin?”
"Are you half-troll or something, Weasley?" Draco snaps, trying to keep his voice low but he knows he hasn't fully succeeded. He feels like taking his wand out and hexing him right here in his own sitting room, damn the consequences. "Your inexhaustible supply of stupidity consistently leaves me in awe of you."
Draco’s jaw fell open, his cheeks instantly filling with blood, and to make it worse, Potter was grinning now.
When he finally put out the lights fifteen minutes later and plunged himself into a chilly, suffocating darkness, his last miserable thought before he fell asleep was that Potter would be on the train back to London tomorrow morning, and Draco wouldn't have to see him for nearly a month.
It was true, but considering Crabbe had not been saved Harry thought it probably wasn't the most helpful thing to say right now. Still, he understood Ron's indignation and part of him was even glad he'd said it. Goyle only stared at him, face expressionless, and then turned and disappeared up the stairs.
“What happened with Nott?” Granger asked quietly as soon as he appeared. Weasley was eyeing him impassively, but that was, Draco had to admit, a step up from revulsion. Besides, his head was throbbing and his mind was trying to sort out too many different things at once to be properly annoyed by his present company.
“All right,” Potter nodded slowly, eyes finally tearing from Draco’s face to find the broom he’d dropped, which he picked back up. “Look, Malfoy, I have no idea what I’m doing either, you know. I don’t know
“Something,” he echoed, nodding his head and letting his eyes roam freely across this new Malfoy’s face. “Yeah.
"It really and truly is," Harry said, dropping a hand to Draco's knee and squeezing. "I know a lot of things between us feel really confusing sometimes but there's nothing at all complicated about how much I like you."
promise I won't be a bit similar," Hermione admitted, face adorned with a bright smile and rosy cheeks.
he would ever admit it to himself. I was so worried that you were only setting yourself up for heartbreak, you know … I thought it was only a matter of time. This development is absolutely unfounded!”
Draco rolled his eyes. He pulled the quilt over them and nuzzled beneath Harry's chin, delighting in the arm that was dropped over his waist.
“Exactly,” Harry exhaled, nearly sagging with relief to have it laid out in words that actually made sense, but before he could say anything else, Parvati had come down into the common room from the girls’ staircase. She looked exhausted, but her smile was big and genuine when she spotted Harry and Hermione.
“It, er — feels sort of fuzzy, I guess?” he said thickly, holding it out for Malfoy to take. “Try not to take too big a hit, though. It’ll burn your throat first couple times.”
"I think I'd like that," says Draco after a moment of digesting this impossible news. Harry laughs, eyes crinkling endearingly, and he leans in to kiss him.
on the desk; and when suddenly it wasn’t just the tip anymore, when suddenly that slick muscle was pushing
Draco looked at him a little sharply but said nothing. Harry gave him a small, teasing smile that prompted a blush onto Draco's cheeks.
up for Potter, whose eyes found Draco’s only moments after he’d presumably read the headline. He could feel that gaze on his skin, and it boiled the blood beneath it. Around him, everyone was beginning to stare. Yet all he could see was Potter.
It didn't matter that Harry was here — Draco went to her gladly and allowed her to envelop him in her arms, the sweet smell of her hair more potent than usual but that was nothing new ...
“Let’s go behind a shelf —” he started to say, only for his voice to abandon him when two thumbs pulled his pussy open and that wet muscle pushed slickly inside his quivering hole. One of Draco’s hands clenched in the piece of parchment on which he’d been writing his essay, ruining it, the other darting beneath the table to grab Harry’s hair on a reflex. “Please!” he whispered frantically, tugging, trying only half-heartedly to pull Harry away from his cunt, now dripping fluid. “Harry, s-
“You should just tell Professor McGonagall, let her deal with it,” Hermione said definitively, but Harry shook his head.
“Yeah.” Draco reaches into a pocket of his robes and pulls out two watches. They look Muggle-made until Draco hands him one, and Harry can actually feel his heart flutter over a beat as he sees the words written around the edges.
“We did.” Draco forced himself not to fidget. His eyes darted to the door and back. “We were going to my room when we ran into Theo.” Blood rose to the surface of his cheeks; he tried to will it away and couldn’t. “Potter was under the Cloak,” he held it up limply in his hand, “Theo stopped me in the common room and asked whether Potter and I have been sleeping together.” He glared at the both of them, waiting for a comment, but none came. “Then he said something about your sister.” This he directed at Weasley, whose expression darkened. “And, well … you know Potter.”
left?” He squeezed her hands, dipping his head to catch her eyes again when she’d dropped them to her lap. “D'you think I’ll ever forget the number of times you’ve pulled me out of the fire?” He shook his head, realising suddenly that this was long overdue. “You’re not just my best friend, Hermione — you’re my sister. While I’m busy saving everyone else’s arses, you’re busy saving mine. And I guess I’ve never really said thank you, but I
Draco, heart pounding, waited until he’d caught his breath to reach up and grab the bloodroot from where Potter had placed it on a shelf he could reach.
“If this is about Ron —” she began, but cut off when Harry shook his head vehemently. A careful smile began to creep up around the edges of her mouth, having noticed Harry’s jubilant mood. “Harry, what
She looked as though she wanted to badger him further, but Draco had trained her too well in their youth, and she dropped the subject without another word. He looked down at the
"I do," he says, all too aware that Harry's still inside him, that his come is leaking out of his arse. Harry looks conflicted, and Draco knows it's because he didn't actually
“He isn’t seeing anyone, far as I know,” Harry said, but Parvati had clammed up on the subject. It was just as well, because as strangely endearing as this development was, Harry was still desperately eager to speak to Hermione alone, and with Ron distracted by the party, now was ideal. When Parvati had left, he took her abandoned chair right beside Hermione and said, “Will you come with me a minute?”
to, but didn’t. “However it was brought to his attention, Potter was already aware of the developing …
“Sounded to me like you were enjoying it,” he said, latching onto Draco’s jaw and pressing the stiffness of his cock against Draco’s thigh. His stomach
"Slow down, slow down," Harry said, grabbing his hands and kissing him when Draco fought it. "Are you serious?"
And Draco laughs, loudly. He bends and touches his lips to Harry’s sweaty forehead, then to his mouth, then his damp and heaving chest and over his stomach and finally delivers a few more chaste kisses to the skin above his pubic hair. Harry’s cock bobs next to his face, pulsing and throbbing and aching. Draco drags his tongue up the side of it and then presses his lips to the head, suckling gently, torturing Harry on purpose. And Harry, he’s not actually sure how much more of this he can take. His arms are aching now. His cock feels
Draco fought for wakefulness, aware first of how blissfully warm he was, then of Harry’s continued presence in his bed (which was unfounded — he always left before Draco woke up).
. The tickling charm. It did not escape Harry’s notice that this was the spell he’d used on Malfoy during Duelling Club in their second year, nor did his mind fail to play the word association game and drag up memories of Malfoy lying on a bathroom floor, sliced to ribbons. This was especially bothersome considering they shared the class with the Slytherins, and Malfoy himself was not ten feet away.
The first time Harry saw Goyle holding hands with Daphne he felt a pang of jealousy. He’d never been one necessarily to hold hands in the corridors with whomever he was dating, but it still would have been nice, at least, to have the option.
Heart in his throat, Draco looked over at the Gryffindor table, but Potter was conspicuously absent. Granger and Weasley, however, were looking over at him.
It was becoming increasingly difficult to think of him as a boy, and this was the part that was causing Harry the most confusion. He wondered whether everyone else felt as dazed and intrigued by the whole thing as he did but got the impression it wasn’t so. In fact, everyone else seemed to have taken it as a go-ahead to double the harassment.
"Yeah, I think so," Harry said, looking back at Blaise and then meeting Hermione's and Ron's wide eyes. "Draco has a few he really likes but I'm not allowed to say. Lily will be the middle name, though."
“The entire school is going to know now,” he said quietly. Draco did not need him to elaborate — there was only one thing he could have been referencing.
“It’s Sunday, isn’t it?” Draco raised an eyebrow, ignoring the spots of colour he knew Potter would be able to see on his face. Truthfully, he didn’t know
Harry had told him once that he’s a light sleeper because of the Muggle family who raised him. Draco had seen the proof of this early on in their relationship, when they had first begun using Harry’s Invisibility Cloak to sneak into one another’s beds at night. Harry would wake at the slightest provocation, from the most minor shift of Draco’s leg, or a warm breath on his skin.
Throwing his robes off and letting them fall to the floor in a fit of anger and humiliation, Draco went inside one of the stalls and looked down to see that blood had stained the apex of his slacks, expensive ones from Pansy’s mother.
“It’s no problem,” she tells him earnestly. “I’m glad to take a bit of a break; sometimes it has to be forced on me or I’ll never do it. Then I have to listen to Ron lecture me about my mental health.” It’s said with a sigh but there’s an unmistakable fondness in her expression. “You said you needed a favour?”
“Sounds like Hermione,” Ron muttered under his breath. Harry thought this particular comment might have had something to do with Hermione’s confiscation of a couple Puking Pastilles he’d been hiding in his pockets the other day.
“Absolutely, Harry,” Hermione assured him, probably having seen the trepidation on his face. “It’s beautiful and it
"The Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes always sees a rise in cases around this time of year," she says, tickling her chin with the feather of her quill in thought. "Spring, I guess. Coming out of winter makes people act weird. Just do me a favour and let me know if you see anything
“I didn’t mean to tell you …” He licked his lips, scratched his arm. It reminded Draco that beneath everything, Harry was still the same awkward dorky leader-of-the-losers he’d always been, just with a bit more confidence now and the title of Official Saviour of the Wizarding World. “I wouldn’t have said that if … I was just angry.”
Potter’s face was still unreadable, but the stoicism was gone, at least. He looked deeply disturbed, his face coloured with an emotion Draco couldn’t define. Finally, with his hands still deep inside his pockets, Potter seemed to find his voice, and he spoke without moving his famous green eyes from Draco’s face.
“Breastfeed?” Harry supplied, a cheeky grin quirking the corner of his lips in spite of the gravity of the topic. Draco’s cheeks filled with blood, turning him what was sure to be an ugly shade of red. One of the hands on his stomach moved further under his blouse, until he was gently cupping Draco’s left breast. He took in a shaky breath that Harry muffled with his mouth.
Finding a clearing and having no inkling as to whether or not it was the one where Voldemort had cast the Killing Curse on him five months ago for the second time, he picked a small stump and sat down.
“And with brilliant timing as always,” Draco said sarcastically, rolling his eyes. “Why do you care? You’ll be going to the Weasleys’, I imagine?”
He tears desperately at Potter’s shirt, rips it off over his head and tosses it. Potter does his, then pulls off Draco’s trousers because for the first time ever they’re in sync, moving together towards a tacit, critical apotheosis of their relationship. Potter is sucking on his fingers and then sliding them into Draco, and Draco throws his head back against the grass and the rain pelts his face, into his mouth and his eyes, cold and sharp on his tongue. There's a blunt pressure, and then Potter is inside him, filling him up with his cock and making Draco dig his nails into the yielding grass and arch and the sound he makes is one of rapture.
to say it, because Hermione was approaching the answer on her own. It should have been astounding, yet it wasn’t anymore.
Draco paused for a moment with the food still in his mouth, made wary by Theo’s tone of voice. He had had a feeling for about a week now that Theo was working himself up to something, he had seemed highly lost inside his thoughts a good chunk of the time, and often Draco would catch him staring off into space as though contemplating a difficult problem.
"D'you wanna go to your dorm?" says Potter after several long moments, pulling away from Draco's mouth only to kiss down his jaw.
Instead of responding to this, Harry tightened his hold on Malfoy’s hip with one hand, and with the other guided his thick length past the twitching muscle of his hole. Malfoy let out a wrecked moan as Harry sank into him, slow but steady, not stopping until every last inch was being relentlessly squeezed by Malfoy’s sinfully tight walls. His pale hands were gripping the back of the sofa so hard they lost what little colour had been there in the first place.
"I could tell," Harry teased. Draco might usually have retaliated with something sarcastic and coquettish, but right now he merely smiled. "I'm sorry it's been so bad."
this is, but … but this is where I draw a line!" She stopped and pointed an accusatory finger at him. "Harry James Potter … I am
As soon as the door was closed, Potter tore off the Cloak and dragged Draco back into a devastating kiss that encompassed every overwhelming emotion Draco had felt over the past four weeks. There was as much teeth as there was tongue; in no time at all his lips felt raw and sensitive, and still he didn’t stop. In a flurry of movement they pulled off one another’s cloaks and scarves, toed off their shoes, and Draco even managed to grab Potter’s jumper and yank it off over his head before Potter was pushing him back towards the bed.
“Just going to what?” Malfoy said when Harry said nothing else, only stared at him with his prick hard and red and leaking between them.
“All right, Malfoy?” the boy said, his grin malicious as he stepped closer. Draco stood his ground, clenched his jaw, and raised a condescending eyebrow.
Theo’s dark appeal had never been lost on Draco; had he not been in the body of woman, had Theo been bent and trying to shag him in his real body, Draco had an inkling he might well have done it.
Daphne's body after all, which would make him, he supposes, a virgin in that regard — but it's so exquisite to know it's Potter's thick fingers inside of him,
glasses” and then “See you, Malfoy” and Draco sits up to watch with his mouth open as Potter picks up his broomstick and starts walking back towards the castle.
"Can I fuck you again?" he asks, and even as his toes curl Draco still finds himself wondering how Potter can be so unbearably stupid
“What? No, come in.” He took Draco’s hand and gestured with his head towards the door. “Please. It’s just Ron and Hermione. They know everything.”
Potter’s fault that they wound up in detention Friday. He might have deliberately sabotaged Potter’s project, but Potter had started the fight.
"Yeah, but Greg is ..." But Draco didn't finish his thought, frowning a little. "Well ... if she can help him pass his NEWTs it'll be a bloody miracle."
Draco turned his head and met Harry’s eyes, groin filling with warmth at the dark look he found there.
“Draco,” he said on Monday morning, catching up to him outside the Great Hall before Draco headed out through the front doors. Students milled about, paying them no mind. “Had a good weekend?”
There was a great swell of noise from the graduates, all shouting together and throwing their pointed hats in the air. With a chest full of emotion, Harry fought through the crowd towards Ron like there was a magnet between them and threw his arms around his very first friend, wondering with sudden laughter if he was truly about to start crying. Ron squeezed him tight, said "well, we made it, eh?" and then released Harry to hug Hermione, who had come bounding over to them. Harry clutched at her next, laughing again when he felt her positively sobbing into his robes. Many people were clapping his back and wishing him well and finally, feeling his heart swell further, he found Draco's white head of hair and didn't bother with a hug, pulling him forwards and kissing him right on the mouth. It was short and sweet and Draco broke it to put his face in Harry's neck. Harry held him close and rubbed his back, knowing how emotional this probably was for Draco without any family here.
So far, he’d come up with only one theory: because Potter was apparently a Gryffindor right down to his toes, he’d taken a stance of nonviolence against Draco simply because he now
“I already have my answer,” Harry said without missing a beat. “There’s nothing I could ever want more than having a family. And to have it with you?” Harry’s eyes travelled Draco’s face, and it occurred to him suddenly how spectacular it was to be the person Harry Potter looked at this way. Like a man seeing the stars for the first time. “You’re everything to me, Draco. I’ll spend the rest of my life proving that to you, if you’ll let me.”
