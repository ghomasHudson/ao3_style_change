“So, I have been seeing Keith and Hilda for almost two months now,” Harry said, “and I seem to be making good progress.  We have been using a pensieve to retrieve, view, and work through some of my painful past memories.  It has been a difficult but rewarding process.”
However, Parkinson’s words continued to resonate in Draco’s mind.  Was he being unfair to Potter?  Was it so hard to believe that Potter’s motives were pure? Despite what his enemies thought, Draco did possess a bit of self-awareness and wasn’t completely devoid of conscience. In spite of the fact that Lucius, Draco's father, was a classic narcissist and  had done everything in his power to prevent Draco from developing either self-awareness or a conscience.  The sole purpose of Draco's existence was to bring honor to Lucius.  Draco had no need of self-awareness; he need only be aware of Lucius’s needs and wants.  Nor did he need a conscience.  That would only prevent Draco from carrying out Lucius’s commands.  But now that Lucius was incarcerated, his influence on Draco was waning.
Draco’s eyes widened in shock. “Oh my god, Harry. I’m so sorry, I had no idea.” In a flash of awareness he said, “That’s why you always carried food around with you at Hogwarts! I always thought that was so odd. It all makes sense now.”
“What, if anything, might make it easier for you to tell Draco you love him?” Keith asked.
“And please call me ‘Hilda’,” Ms. Lancaster added.
With a sly grin he added, “Plus, Remus used to always give me chocolate after a tough session, so I would prefer a Muggle psychologist who keeps a stash of excellent chocolate, preferably Montezuma, House of Dorchester, or Aphrodite.”
Harry sighed and said, “It may be a little rough at first, but I know they’ll come around.  They’re good, fair-minded people.  Once they get to know you, they’ll come to love you as I do.”
The wizards then made a list of tasks they needed to accomplish before the arrival of Scorpius.  On a Saturday they apparated at Malfoy Manor and proceeded to walk through the huge mansion, room by room.  When Draco had moved in with Harry at 12 Grimmauld Place, his house-elves Jiffy and Skeeter had stayed behind to maintain the residence and garden.  Everything appeared to be in good order.
“So that would be less risky than saying “I love you,” Keith reflected.
Harry was flabbergasted.  “Really, five Muggle psychologists just in London?  That suggests that there may be hundreds around the world.  And, if you think about professions other than psychology, then there are probably thousands and thousands of Muggles who know about magic. I thought the Ministry has to cast obliviate spells to erase the memories of Muggles who catch a glimpse of magic.”
"You're very welcome, Harry," Hilda responded with a smile.
“Good, it's a deal,” Harry said with a smile.  He picked up his wand then and cast a tergeo spell to clean up the sofa.
Anxiety coursed through Harry when Draco said he was thinking about returning to Malfoy Manor.  He did not want Draco to leave the Black ancestral home.  He felt intense relief when Draco said that he preferred to stay at 12 Grimmauld Place because the manor was full of “dark memories.”
“Sure,” Harry said easily, brushing his hair away from his forehead to expose the scar.
“Well, then, why don’t we begin?” Keith said.  Placing the pensieve directly in front of Harry, he said, “Now if you can start siphoning memories about your time at the Dursleys into the pensieve . . . try to focus on memories in which you are interacting with the Dursleys, but for the time being try to avoid any memories that are too painful, too distressing.”
“Of course, Harry,” Ron said. “Since it means that much to you.  I’ll do whatever it takes to like the git.”
Harry said, “Yes, do let’s try to address each other by our first names.  If we use surnames, it’ll feel like we never left Hogwarts.”  He smiled to himself, thinking about the other less complimentary names he and Draco had for each other.
“It was a good start,” Draco admitted.  “I feel more ready now to meet the rest of your adopted family.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, Harry,” Hermione huffed. “Of course we’ll do it! How could you possibly have any doubt?  Seriously, I can’t believe you sometimes.”
He entered the door of a fashionable-looking row house and found himself in a nicely decorated waiting area.  He approached the reception desk behind which sat a pretty young woman, whose name, according to the silver name plate on her desk, was Nicola Gunn.  Harry introduced himself to Ms. Gunn tentatively, “Hello, I’m Harry Potter here to see Dr. Mathey?”
“Indeed it has,” Draco said with a grimace.  “It’s getting impossible to continue living there so long as the bloody media and the vindictive public remain obsessed about my father’s demise.  My mother escaped to Paris right after Dad was taken away to Azkaban.  Evidently she made the right choice.”
Harry realized then that Draco didn’t want to feel indebted to him, and so he said, “Please, Draco, it will make my life so much easier if you’ll come to my place.  It doesn’t have to be for long, just until this insanity quiets down a bit.  If you stay at the manor, I will have to figure out how to deal with the disruption there, which means assigning several aurors to keep the peace.  Once the tabloids know that you are no longer at the manor, the reporters will disperse.  And once that happens you can go back home.”
After Lucius Malfoy's suicide, a horde of reporters descends on Malfoy Manor. Harry and Hermione help Draco develop an action plan.
“Now that it has been more than a week since my father’s funeral, I expect that things have quieted down at the manor,” Draco said to Harry one evening after work.  “Perhaps I should think about going home.”
“Shut the fuck up!” Harry yelled. “You are the useless, good for nothing ones.  You are the ones who deserve to die.  You are both horrible and cruel.  My mum and dad were brilliant, loving people.  Voldemort should have killed you, not them!”  Harry then broke down in tears, shaking all over.
“Draco?” Ron blurted out. “You’re calling him Draco now?”
“Fair point,” Harry admitted.  Mr. and Mrs. Granger were knowledgeable about all things magical.  They had worked hard to learn as much as they could about the magical world so they could better support their brilliant daughter.
Harry blushed and didn’t know what to say.
Keith asked gently, “Can you be upfront with Draco about your hunch that he can help with this particular memory, as well as your concern that it might be triggering for him?”
Narcissa inclined her head in acknowledgement.
Harry understood what Draco meant about “political differences” between Narcissa and Astoria.  Narcissa was a pureblood bigot; Astoria was not.  Apparently Narcissa disapproved of Astoria’s tolerance of non-pureblood wizards and witches.  Harry knew he would have gotten along much better with Astoria than with Narcissa.
Keith then ensured that Harry, Draco and Hilda felt comfortable ending the session.  Hilda brought in cups of calming draught for everyone, including Keith, after which she cast a Stamina charm.  After finishing their cups of the draught, Harry and Draco disapparated back to 12 Grimmauld Place.
“Well, I needed to do it,” Draco said. “I have owed them an apology for years. It was weighing on me—a debt that had to be paid.  And they were so gracious.  Your friends are awesome, Harry.”
“Yes, go on, Harry,” Hermione said with excitement. “You’re onto something, I can tell.”
“During my independent study with Remus, we were using the Boggart to help me fight back against my worst fear—the dementors.  Not only were we working on the Riddikulus incantation, but Remus was also trying to get me to cast my Patronus to fight the dementors.  Even though I wasn’t very good at it, the idea that I could fight back, that I didn’t have to become a willing victim of those horrible things, helped a lot.  What was healing in my work with Remus was the experience of fighting back and feeling that I was getting better at fighting back.”
*****
Ron added, “We’re your best friends, mate.  You know we’ll do anything we can to help you.”
Draco chimed in then and said, “Scorpius, this is the man I was telling you about.  Harry Potter, remember?”
Keith facilitated the remainder of Harry’s therapy session, eliciting additional thoughts and feelings from Harry, Draco and Hilda.  Draco told Harry how much he admired the sportsmanship Harry and Cedric had displayed in the Triwizard Tournament and expressed his regret that, in contrast, his own relationship with Harry had always been so hostile and competitive.
“What was it like for you to come up with the words you wish he could say to you?” Keith asked.
Harry frowned in concentration, siphoning childhood memories into the bowl, which started to fill with a gaseous liquid.  After a few minutes, Keith said, “I believe that is sufficient for now, Harry.  Thank you.”
Draco could only surmise that many witches and not a few gay wizards would find The Chosen One exceedingly appealing.  He imagined that quite a few people had thrown themselves at Harry over the years.  And Draco had to admit that Harry had matured into a very handsome wizard.  Despite his small stature, he had a commanding presence; people took notice when he entered a room, and not just because he was the famous Harry Potter.  Harry had an attractive build—he was slender and fit.  In the privacy of their shared home Draco had seen Harry with only his boxers on and had noted his muscular and wiry build.  Draco also thought that Harry had a handsome face—his emerald eyes were penetratingly beautiful, and his entire face lit up when he smiled.
“They’re all great, thanks for asking,” Harry replied.  “Of course the divorce was hard on James.  Albus and Lily are too young to really understand that Ginny and I are divorced.  I already felt bad about being a lousy husband, and then knowing how much our breakup hurt James, well, I never felt such intense guilt before.”
Draco had made himself quite comfortable in Harry’s home. He had chosen a bedroom on the third floor and decorated it to his satisfaction in his favorite colors of silver and green.  Not wanting to overstay his welcome, however, he decided to broach the subject of when he should be returning to Malfoy Manor.
“Of course,” Astoria said, smiling and extending her hand. “How could I ever forget the famous Harry Potter?”
“Yes, it does hurt,” Keith agreed.  “Unfortunately the pain is unavoidable.  It’s particularly difficult when someone has died by violence.  The emotions are so complex, intense and frightening—sadness, anger, rage, impotence, desire for vengeance.  So, of course it’s natural and normal to avoid those difficult emotions and sometimes we have to give ourselves a break from them.  That’s why self-care and social support are so important when we’re doing intensive grief work.”
“Wow,” Scorpius said again.
Harry and Hermione enjoy take-out curry at Harry's place. They talk more about psychotherapy for Harry and reach some decisions.
“I’m so sorry, Draco,” Harry said softly.
Keith decided then to challenge Harry gently.  He said, “You told me that Draco said he had the urge to touch you. And that physical contact between you felt right to him.  That suggests to me that he has deep feelings for you.  I’m not saying that he’s in love with you, only Draco can know that.  But from what you’ve told me, it seems unlikely that he’ll reject you if you disclose at least some of your feelings for him.  I’m not suggesting that you declare your undying love for him.  But maybe you can tell him that you have strong feelings for him and are attracted to him?  Would that perhaps be worth the risk?”
“Let me explain Ms. Lancaster’s presence,” Dr. Mathey began.  “When I provide services to wizards and witches, I find it helpful to enlist the assistance of a psychological technician who has magical abilities. Ms. Lancaster is a witch whom I have personally trained to assist with my magical clients.  Her role will be to ensure your safety in our sessions, especially when we are using magical interventions to effect healing.  Mr. Potter, do you have any questions about Ms. Lancaster’s role?”
Harry Potter attends Lucius Malfoy's funeral at Malfoy Manor.
“We’ll proceed slowly,” Harry said in an attempt to reassure Draco.  “I’ll talk to Ron and Hermione soon, and then we’ll arrange a visit to Grangeley.  After that we can talk about you meeting Ginny and my kids.  I definitely want you to be a part of their lives.”
“I’d like to try another,” Harry said.  “Even though it was tiring, it felt good to stand up to those tossers.”
“Let’s consider that debt paid in full then,” Harry said with a smile.
Meanwhile, Hermione and Harry assigned a team of aurors to accost the hordes of reporters camped out at Malfoy Manor.  The aurors’ task was to inform the reporters that neither Draco nor Narcissa were currently in residence at the manor but had departed for undisclosed locations.  Persons on or near the Malfoys’ property were also to be warned that any act of trespassing, loitering, or vandalism would be dealt with severely by the Auror Department.
Harry felt exposed, as if Keith had recognized a fundamental aspect of Harry’s character and shone a bright light on it.  Although he had been a team player in many situations, he often played a central role and felt that he had sole responsibility for the team’s success.  Prime examples included his position as Seeker on the Gryffindor Quidditch team and his leadership role in Dumbledore’s army.
“Tell me more, Harry. I’m intrigued,” Hermione said.
Draco was deeply moved by Harry’s request.  Did Harry really consider him a trusted friend? The thought induced a feeling of euphoria in him.  Without missing a beat, Draco said, “Of course I’ll do it, Harry.  I feel very honored that you asked.”
Hilda cast the charm and said, “I wish I could do more, but unfortunately there are not many incantations to heal the psyche.  Our community needs to work on remedying that.”
“No, I don’t know where I stand with him,” Harry said.  “I don’t want to be in love with him, I really don’t.  But if I’m honest with myself, I have to admit that I do love Draco.  What a cliché, falling in love with a straight wizard.  And I don’t want to fuck up the friendship we have.”
Hermione looked at the photograph fondly and exclaimed, “What an adorable little wizard.  And obviously very smart.”  Draco beamed with pride.
The tension between the two men thawed considerably a few months after Draco’s trial.  As soon as he arrived at the Ministry on a bright Friday morning, Harry received the shocking news that Lucius Malfoy had committed suicide in Azkaban.  Despite his overpowering aversion to the elder Malfoy, Harry felt intense compassion for Draco, knowing that the Slytherin would be devastated.  And heads would roll at Azkaban.  There had been so many attempts to institute much needed reforms at the dreaded prison.  Obviously those reforms hadn’t been successful if one of Azkaban’s most renowned inmates had found a way to kill himself.
“OK, I will,” Draco replied.
She continued, “One of the things Muggles are better at is healing psychological and emotional wounds.  Wizards and witches tend to be control freaks.  We think we can just wave a wand to solve every problem.  That doesn’t work well for emotional pain.”
That evening Kreacher and Roody served the wizards a delicious supper of roast chicken, boiled potatoes, peas and cauliflower.  After eating their fill Harry and Draco retired to the drawing room, as was their custom.  Acknowledging that viewing Harry’s memory earlier that day had been emotionally draining, Harry and Draco fortified themselves with glasses of Ogden’s Old Firewhisky.  They also agreed that listening to music would be soothing and decided to listen to a Celestina Warbeck concert on the Wizarding Wireless Network.
“Sorry to hear that, Draco,” Harry said with sincerity.
When Harry finished reading Draco’s response, he felt as though he had received a huge gift.  He knew that Draco was speaking from the heart.  He also knew that Draco rarely if ever did that. He had just glimpsed a side of Draco he never knew existed.
Following the eulogy, several people stood and shared sentiments in Lucius’s honor.  Draco spoke from the heart about how he loved his father, in spite of Lucius’s faults, and about the important life lessons Lucius had taught him.  Harry was surprised that Draco had referred to Lucius’s faults, and he teared up hearing Draco’s heartfelt testimony.
Harry talks to Keith about his relationship with Draco.  Draco works things out with Astoria and enjoys time with Scorpius.  The wizards spend the evening together at 12 Grimmauld Place.  Things happen.
Harry reflected for a moment, then said, “Well, if Draco and I can come here sometime and visit with you two and the kids, that would be a great start.  And then maybe you can somehow help make introducing Draco to the rest of the family a little easier?  I mean I will figure out how to introduce Draco to Ginny and my kids.  But I’ll probably need some help introducing him to Molly and Arthur and Ron’s brothers.”
Draco had chosen to remain in the manor, of course. Although the Malfoys had lost a substantial part of their fortune due to the huge restitution penalties imposed for their war crimes, they were permitted to keep the manor house and land.  Draco knew that as the sole Malfoy heir it was his duty to protect the family home.  He also realized that, had Harry Potter not defended him at his trial, the Malfoys would undoubtedly have lost the manor too.  He wished he didn’t owe such a huge debt to Potter, but carrying the emotional burden of that debt was preferable to losing the manor.
“Of course,” Harry said, pulling Draco into a tight hug.  He whispered, “You were brilliant, today. Your father would be so proud.” A feeling of warmth suffused Draco’s body.
If one looks closely enough, one might notice that slight changes in the relationship between Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy have occurred since the end of the Second Wizarding War.
“But how can I see a Muggle psychologist when I won’t be able to talk about our magical world at all? As if I could say, ‘Well, you see, I’m a wizard, and there was this horribly evil wizard named Voldemort, who had these cruel followers called ‘Death Eaters,’ and I had to destroy all these horcruxes he created, but then I learned I was a horcrux myself.  And after that I died, well only a part of me died, and …”
“I’ll give it a try,” Harry said.  He closed his eyes and tried to imagine an ideal version of Snape, a wizard who would be honest and own his mistakes.  Then assuming the role of this ideal Snape he began speaking in a voice that sounded remarkably like the Potions professor’s: “You’re right, Harry.  I was needlessly mean to you.  I looked at you and saw your father who had bullied me at Hogwarts when I was a kid.  I saw the man who had taken your mother away from me.  The man I hated. There were times I felt guilty for treating you the way I did.  I would think about your mother and know how sad and angry she would feel if she had witnessed our interactions.  But I couldn’t help myself.  I was so bitter about what your dad and his friends had done to me, and I focused all that bitterness on you.  That was wrong of me, but I hope that you will remember that I did protect you as well.”
“Will do,” Harry said agreeably.
Draco smiled and replied, “Hello, Ron.  Life is good.  Yes, Harry and I are co-habitating, you might say.”
“Let’s take one final step to cleanse the dark energy in the room—let’s cast our patronuses,” Harry suggested.   The wizards agreed on a joyful shared memory—the previous weekend they had flown together for fun in pursuit of a golden snitch, recapturing their youth as Hogwarts seekers.  It was the  perfect memory for their purpose.  Harry and Draco simultaneously raised their wands, and within moments the cellar was illuminated by their glimmering patronuses—Draco’s stunning white peacock and Harry’s majestic stag.
“Of course,” Harry replied. “It would be awesome to have the little wizard around.  Maybe someday he can meet my Albus.  I think they’re about the same age.”
“Any other thoughts or feelings you would like to share about the memory, Harry?” Keith asked.
“Yes, I’m sure,” said Harry with conviction.  “We’ll start with Ron and Hermione.   I know your relationship with ‘Mione has improved since you started working at the Ministry.  Ron may be a little more difficult, but he’ll follow Hermione’s lead, he always does.  I’ll talk to them first before we plan anything more formal, OK?”
“No, he’s still at 12 Grimmauld Place.  Actually I’m rather enjoying his company.  He was thinking about returning to the manor, but I encouraged him to stay.”
Harry did feel more energized after Hilda cast the charm.  After saying farewell to Keith and Hilda, he left their office with a bounce in his step.  He felt hopeful about the therapy work he had just begun.  He decided not to take Muggle transportation home, instead choosing to apparate in his living room at 12 Grimmauld Place.
Eventually he could no longer contain himself and felt compelled to speak. He said, “Hermione and Ron, it was very gracious of you to invite me to your lovely home given my past behavior.  I need to tell you how sorry I am for offending and insulting you in the past, and I hope you will forgive me.  I‘m not the same person I was years ago, and I hope you will give me the chance to prove that. If not for my sake, for Harry’s sake, because we are together now, and I want to be on good terms with his best friends.”
“Well, as I was reading through the material, I thought about the Boggart work I did with Remus Lupin at Hogwarts.  You can think of that as an Experiential therapy technique for wizards and witches.  You have the experience of encountering the thing you most dread, and you use a Riddikulus incantation to change it into something harmless.  Follow?”
“OK, that sounds fair, Harry,” was all he was able to manage.  Then, realizing that he needed time and space by himself, he said, “Maybe we can share a goodnight hug then?”
Harry said goodbye to Astoria and Scorpius and then followed Draco to greet other guests.  He had several cordial conversations with the Slytherins—Pansy and Pike were quite friendly, while Blaise was a bit standoffish.
“I never considered that before,” Harry admitted.  “It makes sense, but I hate grieving--it hurts too goddamn much.”
Harry closed his eyes and thought for a bit.  He then looked at Keith and said, “I suppose I could say that I have feelings for him and understand that he doesn’t reciprocate those feelings, which is fine, and I will of course respect his boundaries and want him to stay at my place.”
“Thank you,” Harry said to his best friends. “Your support means everything to me.”
“You won’t, Harry,” Draco said earnestly.  “I’m not going anywhere.  I have strong feelings for you too.  I already told you that I love and admire you. I’m just confused about what happens next.  I’ve never been with another man before.  Actually I’ve never felt like this before about anyone, except maybe Scorpius.”
“No, Ron, it’s true,” Harry said, looking directly into Ron’s wide eyes.
Harry nodded.  “Yes, we’re working with a pensieve.  I siphon memories and then we work through them.  It’s hard to describe how the process works, but the healing seems to be the result of facing the pain directly in the presence of caring and supportive people, and giving honest expression to the thoughts and feelings that come up.”
“Well, I had an idea.  My friend Draco has expressed willingness to view some of my memories, like Ron and Hermione did last time.  I was thinking about asking Draco to view my memory of witnessing the death of a person I cared about.  I can’t explain it, but I have this strong feeling that Draco is the one person who can help me deal with that memory.  I don’t know exactly why.  A big reservation I have, however, is that Draco’s father died not long ago, and I don’t want my memory to trigger his own grief about his father’s death.”
Before long Draco announced the beginning of the service.  The attendees took their seats facing Lucius’s coffin.  Pansy’s father, Perseus Parkinson, gave the eulogy.  He spoke with eloquence and passion, praising Lucius’s accomplishments and celebrating his dedication to the preservation of magical culture.  Harry read between the lines and understood that Mr. Parkinson meant the preservation of pureblood magical culture.  But this was not the time or place to express his indignation.
Harry tensed up then and started yelling.  Hilda cast a quick soundproofing charm to ensure that his voice wouldn’t reach therapists and clients in adjacent offices.
When both Draco and Harry agreed that would be OK, Keith said, “I’ll start with you, Harry.  What was it like to revisit that painful memory?”
Keith’s observation that he might be denying his friends an opportunity to do something kind for him hit a nerve. He made a firm decision to have honest conversations with Hermione, Ron and Draco about what Keith had suggested.  However, he still needed to figure out how to have those conversations without making his friends feel obligated to participate.  He would need to think a lot more about that.
The wizards’ love for each other grew stronger and deeper with each passing day.  Every night after tucking Scorpius in for the night and reading the little wizard a bedtime story, Harry and Draco would snuggle together in the drawing room, reflecting on how lucky they were to have fallen in love with each other.  And every night before going to sleep, Harry would kiss Draco and say, "I love you, Malfoy." And Draco would reply, "I love you back, Potter."
“No way!” Ron exclaimed. “You’re taking the piss out of us!”
Harry looked thoughtful and then said, “We have great conversations.  He’s very smart.  He's a deep thinker who is well-informed about so many things.  I learn a lot from talking to him.”
“It’s about Draco and me,” Harry replied. “We’re together now.”
Astoria gave each attendee a white lily.  As Draco and Narcissa led the procession past the tomb, each guest placed a lily in front of Lucius’s final resting place.
The shock on Ron’s face was plain as print. “Really?” he exclaimed. “You’re enjoying Malfoy’s company?!”
“And?” Harry prompted.
Right at half two, a nicely dressed gentleman wearing a navy blue blazer over tan slacks entered the waiting room.  He appeared to be in his mid 40s.  He was average height, about 175 centimeters tall, good looking, with light brown hair and blue eyes. He approached Harry and said, “Mr. Potter?”
Draco’s face lit up at the possibility. “I would love that, Harry,” he said. “Are you sure that would be OK?”
At that moment Hermione and Ron entered the parlor.  Hermione rushed over and gave both wizards a warm welcome.  She hugged one, then the other, giving each a gentle kiss on the cheek.  “So glad this worked out for you two.”
“OK, I’ll think about it, and we can talk more about it next time,” Harry replied.
The two Gryffindors were sitting in Hermione’s large office in the Ministry of Magic.  After Kingsley Shacklebolt retired five months ago, Hermione had been unanimously voted in as the new Minister of Magic—the youngest person, witch or wizard, to ever hold the position.  As Harry was Head Auror for the British ministry, Hermione was now his boss.  He was intensely proud of her but at times he was not clear about whether she was talking to him as his superior or as his friend.  This was something they were both trying to work out.
Harry was silent for a few moments, then said, “Well, the obvious answer is if he told me he loved me first, but that’s not going to happen.”
When he was done expressing his anger at Petunia, Hilda again touched him gently and offered him the cup of calming draught.  Harry took the cup and sipped from it.  He then smiled at Keith and Hilda and said, “That was hard, but amazing. I feel so much lighter now.”
At that moment Hermione called them into supper and shouted up the stairs to Rose and Hugo.  The food was plentiful and delicious.  Harry caught up on the latest news of the Weasley extended family.  George’s business, Wizard Wheezes in Diagon Alley, was doing very well.  George continued to invent new products that would appeal to his youthful clientele. The latest most popular item was the Elf Hat, which transformed the wearer’s face into that of a house-elf.  What people found most amusing was that the wearer somehow remained identifiable in spite of looking like a house-elf from the neck up.  Arthur and Molly were enjoying their retirement years, especially appreciating the additional time to be doting grandparents.  Hermione and Ron grumbled a bit about how Ron’s parents constantly spoiled Hugo and Rose.  Harry commiserated, saying that his own children were always less pliable after spending time with Arthur and Molly.
Harry pondered for a moment, then said, “Yes, I think I can talk to him about it.  If Draco and I agree to go ahead, I’ll call and give you a heads-up.”
“Uncle Harry!” the children exclaimed, running up to Harry the moment he apparated.  He grabbed them both in a group hug, kissing each child on the side of the head.  “My favorite godchildren,” Harry said with a big smile. “How I’ve missed you!”  He reached into his pocket and pulled out two boxes of chocolate frogs, giving one to each child.  Their eyes widened with delight.
Keith responded with a gentle challenge.  He said, “As I said last time, Harry, the decision is completely up to you, and I am not trying to pressure you in any way.  That said, there is something I’d like you to consider. My observation is that you have a habit of taking full responsibility for saving the day.  Yes, you’ve had allies who have helped you, but the burden of responsibility seems always to fall on your shoulders.  I find it interesting that when you can benefit from others’ support, you find reasons to avoid asking for it.  I admire your desire to protect your friends and your sensitivity to their distress, but I find myself wondering whether you are denying them the gift of doing something kind for you.”
Harry pondered for a moment and then said, “I don’t mind at all, Draco.  After Voldemort killed my parents, my mother’s sister and her husband took me in.  But they were never kind to me, in fact they abused me.  They kept me in a tiny cupboard under the stairs and essentially made me their servant.  They also withheld food from me, so I was always starving.”
“This has been an eye-opening conversation, Harry,” Draco said.  “I’m feeling a bit tired, so I think I’ll go lie down for a bit.  Shall we get together for supper around 7 p.m.?”
Keith interjected then.  He said, “Harry, can you tell us what it was like to have Hermione and Ron view your memory and share their responses with you?”
Draco, who had been looking with intense fondness at the exchange between Harry and Scorpius, said, “There will be time later, Scorpius, for you to ask Mr. Potter additional questions, but now we have some business to attend to.”
“How did the Weasleys take it?” Draco asked.
After viewing the memories in the pensieve, Hilda gave Harry a warm hug and whispered, “I’m so sorry that beast did that to you, Harry.”  He nodded, tears welling up in his eyes.
“Without a doubt,” Draco replied with conviction.
Harry continues to work through traumatic experiences in therapy with the help of the pensieve.
In response Draco sent this message to Harry: “Dear Harry, Thank you for your kind expression of sympathy.  Although my relationship with my father was complicated, I deeply grieve his passing.  I also appreciate your generous offer of assistance.  I am rather worried that my father’s death may result in a media circus, so it would perhaps be helpful to meet at the Ministry in the next day or two to discuss damage control?  I appreciate your concern.  Draco aka Malfoy aka Amazing Bouncing Ferret."
Harry laughed.  “Well, I’ll leave it up to you whether to tell your mother about us.  But maybe we can start with Pansy if you think she’ll be cool with it.  We can slowly build up to the more difficult people to come out to.”
Hilda then proceeded to describe to Keith what she had witnessed.  Keith then guided Harry to do some healing work, which included naming his emotions and giving full expression to them.  Afterwards they discussed several additional options.  Keith suggested sharing some of his painful memories with one or two trusted friends so that Harry could receive additional support and affirmation.
Hermione, Ron and Harry retired to the parlor after supper, and the time had come for Harry to talk to his best friends about the pensieve work he had been doing in therapy.  He started out by explaining how his therapy sessions had been going with Dr. Mathey and his assistant, Ms. Lancaster, who was both a psychological technician and a witch.  Harry explained Ms. Lancaster’s role in his therapy sessions.
“I wish I had been more aware of what you were going through then, Harry,” Hermione said. “And if I had been a more powerful witch, I could have helped you more.”
Hermione grabbed Ron’s hand as she viewed Harry’s memory.  “Oh, Harry,” she whispered, “how horrible.  I knew it was bad, but I didn’t know how bad.”
Sitting in his office in the Department of Magical Artefacts, Draco took some time to think things through.  He needed to sort out his feelings for Harry, as well as his feelings for Astoria.  His marriage had been on the rocks for a long time now. Truth be told, they had never been a perfect match.  Astoria was beautiful, no doubt about that, and they looked good together.  Everyone said they made a handsome couple.  His parents had approved the marriage because she was a pureblood witch.  But Draco and Astoria didn’t have anything in common except that they were both pureblood, and their relationship was characterized by a civility, a cordiality that had always left Draco feeling cold and dissatisfied.  He had always been a passionate, highly emotional wizard, who had often had to repress his passionate feelings.  But lately, living with Harry, he had felt more alive than he had felt in a long time.  Draco realized that he needed to talk to Astoria soon.  He decided he would try to see her in Edinburgh during his lunch hour.
Although Draco was loath to admit it, he was grateful for Harry’s and Hermione’s help.  The plan they devised enabled him not only to get away from the media circus but also to escape, if only temporarily, the profusion of memories at the manor that triggered waves of grief about his father’s death.  Draco could not bring himself to acknowledge it, but he was also touched by Harry’s and Hermione’s concern about his property.  He had not expected them to dispatch a team of aurors to ensure that no harm would come to the manor.
Draco couldn’t stop shaking his head, thinking about how different their childhoods had been.  While Harry had been starving in a tiny cupboard under the stairs, Draco had been feasting on delicious meals prepared by house-elves in the expansive rooms of the affluent manor.
“That would be brilliant,” Draco said.  A joyful image popped into his head--he and Harry reading bedtime stories to their sons.
“Oh, Harry,” Draco replied, “you saved my butt at my trial and kept me from being sentenced to Azkaban.  I think I could be repaying that debt for the rest of my life.”
“I feel kind of selfish, just receiving and not giving,” Draco admitted.
“What are you afraid might happen, Harry?” Keith asked.
“So you talked after he touched your hair,” Keith reflected, “but you didn’t feel resolved after that talk.
Harry looked thoughtful before replying, “Ron was very mad at me for a while. He felt betrayed.  Not just because Ginny and I were getting a divorce, but mostly because he was my best friend and he didn’t know I was gay.  He thought I kept it from him, which I suppose I did, but only because I was oblivious or in denial myself.  Ron eventually came around after we had a long heart-to-heart.”
“We love you back, Harry,” Hermione said.
Harry took her hand and returned her smile.  “Astoria, lovely to see you again,” he said.  He was struck by her arresting beauty—her luscious dark hair, porcelain skin, and lovely, serene expression.  Harry was then distracted by a tug on his pant leg.  Looking down he saw Scorpius and crouched down so that they were face to face.  “Hello, little wizard,” Harry said, “what’s your name?”
“Like what?” Harry said, eyes moving up from his feet to meet Draco’s grey eyes.
Draco was surprised by the relief he felt. “Thanks, Harry,” he said. “I appreciate your hospitality.  I suppose I will stay for a while longer.  To be perfectly honest, the thought of being back at the manor, full of dark memories, doesn’t appeal.”  As an afterthought he added, “But please don’t hesitate to tell me to go home when you get sick of my presence.  That famous American Muggle Ben Franklin said that house guests, like fish, start to smell after three days, and I’ve been here for much longer than that.”
After a few beats Draco said, “Sorry, Harry.  I – I just felt the need to touch you.  Didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.”
After they disapparated from the Leaky Cauldron and were back at 12 Grimmauld Place, they talked about custody arrangements.  Draco asked Harry about the custody agreement he had with Ginny.  Harry explained that Ginny and their children were living in Whimple in Devon, not far from the Weasley family home in Ottery St. Catchpole.
Although many years had passed since their Hogwarts days, neither Harry nor Draco could easily forget the anger and hatred they had once felt and expressed towards each other.  Their relationship immediately following the Second Wizarding War could be described as an uneasy truce.
“Sure,” Harry replied, “what’s up?”
Breaking from the kiss, Harry unbuttoned and opened Draco’s shirt, then slowly moved down his long, lean body, worshipping him all over with lips and tongue, while the Slytherin breathed hard and fast.  Harry marveled at the beauty of Draco’s toned body, the flawless porcelain skin, the whipcord muscles of a Quidditch seeker. Reaching Draco’s waist, Harry loosened the belt and Draco shucked off his jeans and boxers.  Before taking Draco’s long, hard cock in his mouth, Harry shucked off his own jeans and boxers, and then began deep-throating Draco’s cock while simultaneously pumping his own erection.  Draco’s breath became heavier and faster and before long he started to gasp.
“It’s a completely different space now,” Draco said with satisfaction.  “I can even see Scorpius playing with his collection of magical creatures down here.”
Draco started to weep when he saw how Cedric and Harry had argued, each of them claiming that the other deserved to win the tournament, and how they eventually agreed to claim the victory as a team.  Never before had he witnessed two teenagers exhibiting that much integrity, generosity and sportsmanship.  In that moment Draco glimpsed what his own relationship with Harry might have been like back then, and he was overcome by a feeling of sadness.
Malfoy was able to disapparate from Malfoy Manor without attracting any attention. He made his way from the lobby of the Ministry to Potter’s office.  He was surprised to find not only Potter, but also Granger, waiting for him.
The friends were sitting in Harry’s living room at 12 Grimmauld Place after a challenging day at the Ministry.  They had grabbed some take-out curry and apparated at Harry’s house to resume their conversation about Muggle psychotherapy for Harry.
“Yeah,” Harry said with a smile.  “It’s happy news, but I know it will come as a bit of a shock.”
“Harry, did you get a chance to look through the information I sent you?” Hermione asked.
“Please don’t,” Ron pleaded, continuing to shake his head.  “I still can’t believe it.  Harry and Malfoy in love. It’s absurd, that’s what it is.”
“Would you like to stay at 12 Grimmauld Place for a while, at least until the pandemonium quiets down?” Harry proposed.
“I hope it doesn’t bother you that I took the liberty to add non-pureblood family members and restore the names of disowned members to the tapestry,” Harry said.  “It felt a bit presumptuous of me, not being a member of the Black family.  But I guess my commitment to social justice took precedence, and as custodian of this ancestral home, I decided it was my prerogative to restore the tapestry in a way that reflected my own values.  It didn’t feel right that two of my heroes, Sirius and Andromeda, had been removed from the tree, and that someone like Teddy Lupin wouldn’t be included because he’s half-blood.”
“I can help you figure out your side of things. You told me at Dr. Mathey’s office that you are here for me,” Harry said earnestly.  “Well, I’m here for you too, Draco.  Anything you need, just tell me and it’s yours.”
Taking a deep breath she continued in a gentle tone, “I’m concerned for your psychological and emotional welfare.  You’ve got a long history of trauma, Harry.  Losing your parents when you were an infant, suffering years of abuse by the Dursleys, all the awful things that happened to you at Hogwarts before and during the war.  Not to mention having to deal with how people have treated you after the war—both the idolatry you despise and the even more painful vitriol directed at you for speaking up in Draco Malfoy’s defense. You have suffered more than anyone.  You know that Ron and I love you profoundly and would do anything for you, but we don’t possess the knowledge or skill to heal those deep wounds.”
Harry looked down with a sheepish expression.
The wizards and witches all shook their heads.  “OK then, go for it,” Keith said.
“Marriage isn’t easy, is it?” Harry said with sigh.  “When do you think you’ll see Scorpius again?”
“Don’t,” Harry said, “I truly believe it’s better to give than receive.  Besides this doesn’t have to be a one-time occurrence, unless you want it to be.”
“OK, I get your point,” Hermione said with a slight grin.
“So, yes, it’s a scary prospect to tell Draco how you feel,” Keith acknowledged.  “If you were to disclose some of your feelings to him, is there a way you could do it that would feel less scary?”
“Very much,” Harry said.  “I’ve been plagued by all kinds of demons since childhood, and then I went through so many horrible things before and during the Second Wizarding War.  My sessions with Keith and Hilda are helping me sort out a lot of my past.”
Harry couldn’t stop thinking about how Draco wept while viewing his memory of Cedric Diggory’s murder.  And how Draco had hugged him, saying he loved and admired him.  Harry recalled how he felt with the Slytherin’s arms around him—comforted and safe.  And how his heart leapt when Draco said he loved him.  Also echoing in Harry’s mind were Draco’s words, “I’m here for you now.”
While Harry was in his therapy session, Draco was in Edinburgh negotiating with Astoria.  After considerable discussion they agreed to a shared custody arrangement whereby Scorpius would spend three months with each parent.  During the three-month period, the other parent would visit on a regular basis.  They agreed that Scorpius would stay with Astoria in Edinburgh through the end of July and begin a three-month stay with Draco starting at the beginning of August.  The couple had also come to an agreement on how they would divide communal property.  Astoria planned to claim what belonged to her from Malfoy Manor and teleport it to Edinburgh within the next three weeks.
Harry described the scene for Keith and related blow by blow what transpired.
A blissful feeling permeated the room and remained, even after the wizards had lowered their wands and their shining patronuses had faded.  Harry and Draco agreed that they had accomplished all their tasks at the manor, and all that remained was to teleport their own and Scorpius’s belongings before moving in on August 1st.
“I try to talk to him a few times a week either through two-way mirrors or Floo Powder,” Draco replied. “Astoria and I negotiated a six-month trial separation, so we have another three months to figure out what we’re going to do about our marriage.  At this point it doesn’t look good, I’m afraid.”
Harry travels to central London to have his first appointment with the Muggle psychologist, Dr. Keith Mathey.
Since moving into 12 Grimmauld Place, Draco found, to his surprise, that he rather enjoyed Harry’s company.  The two wizards had quite naturally fallen into a comfortable rhythm, often enjoying breakfast together at home before apparating together at the Ministry of Magic for a day of work.  After work they might go for a pint at the Leaky Cauldron, or just head back to the Black ancestral home for a delicious supper prepared by Kreacher and Roody.  The two house-elves seemed to be working together harmoniously and had come to regard both Harry and Draco as their wizard masters.
Those who were invited to attend Lucius’s funeral were, for the most part, pureblood wizards and witches who shared his political views.  Narcissa had returned for the funeral but did not plan to stay long.  Astoria had come from Scotland with Scorpius and planned to return to Edinburgh right after the funeral.  Several of Draco’s friends from Hogwarts were there, including Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, and Pike, his former Quidditch teammate.
During his next session, Harry did more pensieve work, this time focused on the torture he experienced at the hands of Dolores Umbridge.  That sociopathic witch was now serving a life sentence in Azkaban for her crimes during the Second Wizarding War.  After Harry had siphoned memories of his torture sessions with Umbridge, he and Hilda viewed the memories.  Hilda gasped in horror as she watched Umbridge compel Harry to write “I must not tell lies” with the Black Quill.  She cringed and teared up when she saw the blood rising to the surface of Harry’s hand as he wrote each letter in that disgusting sentence.
There was significant trauma that the three Gryffindors had already shared, and Harry didn’t want to subject Hermione and Ron to taking on more of his trauma.  He remembered the time when Ron and his brothers flew the Muggle car to rescue him from the Dursleys.  He recalled hearing Ron’s voice break when he exclaimed to Molly Weasley, “But mum, they were starving him!”  Ron couldn’t bear seeing Harry in pain. Harry also recalled the tears in Hermione’s eyes when she enumerated the many painful experiences Harry had endured.  Harry knew his friends were strong and would be more than willing to witness his painful memories, but he couldn’t ask it of them.
During one session Harry focused on distressing interactions he had with Severus Snape while at Hogwarts.  Even though Harry had come to admire the Half-Blood Prince, even choosing “Severus” as his younger son’s middle name, he was haunted by his former Potions professor’s looks of contempt and disdain, not to mention the cold and angry insults and accusations he had frequently hurled at Harry.
“I know you told me there were dark memories there,” Harry said, “but maybe we can dispel those dark memories and start creating happy ones.  I keep thinking about the beautiful garden, the fresh air, and the wide, open spaces which would be so good for Scorpius.  Besides, the manor will be his one day, so it makes sense for him to spend time there now.  And I’m sure that Astoria and Narcissa would prefer visiting Scorpius at the manor rather than here.  The only concern I have is whether your mother will have a problem with me living there with you.”
Keith and Hilda smiled back at Harry.  “Excellent work today, Harry,” Keith said.  “You may find yourself experiencing strong emotions after today’s session.  Some emotions may be very positive, for example, feeling empowered and gratified, but other emotions may be more difficult, such as strong feelings of grief or anger.  I encourage you to engage in some good self-care between now and our next session.  Also to connect with friends and family members whom you trust, people who can provide emotional support and affirmation.  You did a lot of hard work today in therapy, so take good care of yourself, OK?”
After Lucius's funeral, Draco reflects on his relationship with Harry.
Harry immediately dispatched his owl Iphigenia to Draco with a letter expressing his condolences.  He worried that Draco might not believe, let alone appreciate, an expression of sympathy from him, but that couldn’t deter him.  It was the right thing to do.  And so Harry wrote from the heart, telling Draco how sorry he was for his loss.
By this time Harry’s spirit had lightened sufficiently to tease Draco.  He said, “Does that mean you won’t sneer at me anymore and say, ‘Scared, Potter?’”
Keith greeted Harry and Draco in the waiting room and escorted them into his office.  He introduced Draco and Hilda, then explained the process of viewing Harry’s memories, the potential risks, and the safeguards in place, just as he had with Hermione and Ron two weeks earlier.
Harry nodded.  “That sounds good to me,” he said, adding with a smile, “I don’t want to get overwhelmed either.”
“Let me make a few inquiries,” Hermione replied. “It’s important that you connect with a psychologist who’s an expert in treating trauma.  Also someone who won’t be star-struck by you, like ‘OMG, my client is the Chosen One, the Boy Who Lived!’”
Keith said, “Harry, when you saw Hilda react so strongly to witnessing your traumatic experience, that had a powerful impact on you.  So it might be beneficial for you to share some of these memories with one or two of your closest friends.  This would enable your friends to really understand what you went through and be better able to provide the kind of support you need.  I suggest you think about this option and let Hilda and me know what you decide.  If you agree to this idea, whoever you choose can come in for a portion of a therapy session, and Hilda and I will guide the process.”
The wizards grinned at each other.
After visiting with Ron and Hermione for a couple of hours, Harry hugged his friends goodbye and disapparated back to 12 Grimmauld Place.
“Eventually I told her,” Harry said.  “She knew something was up. And I couldn’t keep lying to her.  It was eating me up inside.  But I think she had decided we were over before that conversation.  We agreed to divorce, and then came the hardest part—talking to James and the Weasleys.”
At his next therapy session, Harry talked to Dr. Mathey and Ms. Lancaster about his readiness to do some grief work.  In less than 30 years Harry had experienced so many tragic losses.  Many of his loved ones had been violently killed—his parents, Sirius, Remus, Nymphadora, Fred . . .  the list went on and on.  Harry told Keith and Hilda that he hadn’t coped very well with these losses and he knew he had a lot of “unfinished business” regarding death.
One saving grace was that Narcissa Malfoy had expatriated to France after the war, as she could no longer stand being in Malfoy Manor. Her former home held too many memories of happier times before the name Malfoy had become disgraced and despised and her husband had been carted off in magical restraints to Azkaban.
“Pleased to meet you,” Harry said, following Dr. Mathey down a short corridor and into a spacious office.  When Harry and Dr. Mathey entered the room, a middle-aged woman wearing a smart business suit rose from the chair she had been sitting in.  She smiled warmly at Harry.
Harry and Draco apparated a short distance from the therapy center and walked in companionable silence to Dr. Mathey’s office.   Having not been in Muggle London for some time, Draco was looking around, drinking in all the sights and sounds.  It was his very first time in a Muggle therapy office, and he was fascinated by all the Muggle objects, including the décor and the technology.  He had entered a different culture, and everything looked so new and different to the pureblood wizard.
Harry then thought about Draco and concluded immediately that it would be too much to ask.  Draco had recently suffered so much disruption in his life.  His father committed suicide, he hosted his father’s funeral less than two weeks ago, he was separated from his wife and son, and he was living with Harry, far away from his family estate.  Harry realized that he could not ask Draco to witness his painful memories either.
“Huge.  I don’t want to lose him,” Harry said. “I’ve been so happy since he started living with me.  I love hanging out with him, whether we’re having a great conversation, or just hanging out listening to music, or unwinding at the tavern, or enjoying a meal together.  Being with Draco is the highlight of my day.  When I’m at work, I look forward to spending the evening with him.  I miss him when he’s not around.”
Draco and Astoria decided to talk to Scorpius together about the new arrangement.  A precocious six-year-old little wizard, he listened intently to his parents’ words.  Draco and Astoria explained that they had done a lot of thinking and talking and decided that Astoria would continue living in Edinburgh with Aunt Isabella, and Draco would continue living in London with Harry Potter.  They assured Scorpius that they both loved him very much and both parents wanted to be with him, so they decided to share him.  So Scorpius would continue to live with his mother for now, and later in the summer he would go live with his father in London.  Draco and Astoria further explained that each parent would visit regularly when Scorpius was with the other parent.  If Scorpius was confused or distressed by the news, he did not show it.  Perhaps he had become accustomed to living in Edinburgh with Astoria, and having Draco visit from time to time, so it didn’t seem like much of a change.
“Wow, Harry,” Draco said. “You’re blowing my mind.  So I take it Ginny found out?”
Ron responded with, “Yes, I’ll always have your back, Harry.”
“I think it’s going to be hard sharing custody with Astoria,” Draco said with a sigh.  “I miss Scorpius so much. I should have seen him today, but I was too broken up after ending things with Astoria.  I have to go back and see him tomorrow or the next day.”
“Exhausted,” Harry said.  “I wanted to curse them with Avada Kedavra.”
“OK, Harry, look away from the pensieve now,” Keith whispered. “Close your eyes.  Imagine yourself back in the scene, but now you are an adult, witnessing the Dursleys screaming at this helpless little boy who has tragically lost his parents.  What will you do and say to help that little boy?  Don’t hold back, let it out.”
Harry’s testimony at Draco’s trial was the beginning of a détente between the two men.  Draco was astonished when Potter had spoken up for him at his trial, pointing out that Draco was a minor during the war, as much a victim of the Dark Lord as many members of Dumbledore’s Army had been.
Harry meets with Dr. Keith Mathey and Ms. Hilda Lancaster for the second time.  Using a pensieve he retrieves and works through some memories of childhood abuse.
“By all means,” Harry replied gratefully. “That would be wonderful.”
As he reflected on his past relationships, Draco realized that for the first time in his life he now had the opportunity to enjoy a real friendship, based on warmth, good humor, honesty, and caring.  And that friendship was with Harry Potter, of all people.  He realized too how much he valued his connection with Harry.  He now had a sense of what it would be like to have a true friend, someone you could confide in, someone you admired, someone whom you wanted to help and support.  He recalled how Harry had talked to Scorpius at Lucius’s funeral, and how Draco had welled up with affection watching them interact.
“Tell me about your day, Draco,” Harry said, sinking into a comfortable chair.
Harry continued, “There are plenty of bedrooms, so you’d have your pick. The only downside is that I’m not a particularly tidy person, so if you can put up with a bit of chaos . . .”
“Don’t be,” Draco said.  “We’d been postponing the inevitable.  Remember when you asked me a while ago if I missed her? And I said no? Well, she hasn’t been missing me either and that speaks volumes about our relationship.  We haven’t been affectionate to each other or had a meaningful conversation in years.  What’s the point in being married then?”
Harry roared with laughter. The Gryffindors finished their curry dinner and chatted for a while longer, but soon it was time for Hermione to go home and put Rose and Hugo to bed.
“What about your kids, Harry?  How are James, Albus and Lily doing?” Draco asked.
Harry continued, “Draco, I asked Hermione to join us because I thought she could help us figure out how to deal with the “media circus,” as you so aptly described it in your message to me.  I assume the circus has already descended on Malfoy Manor?”
“I appreciate that, Dr. Mathey,” Harry said. “And please call me ‘Harry.’  That will go a long way to making me feel more comfortable.  I’m not a particularly formal person.”
At that moment Hermione entered the parlor, walked over to Harry, and gave him a welcoming hug.  “Ron should be here in a minute, and we’ll dine shortly,” she said.  Looking at the children clutching their boxes of chocolate frogs, she said, “You may each have one chocolate frog after supper. Now go wash up.  We’ll be eating soon.”
Before Harry left the therapy office, Hilda cast a Stamina charm and brought him a cup of calming draught.  Harry thanked her for casting the charm and accepted the draught with gratitude.
Ensconced in his bedroom Draco continued to think about what had just happened.  He stripped off all his clothes and lay on his bed, but he knew he wouldn’t be able to sleep for a while.  He found himself luxuriating in the sensual feeling of being naked on top of his silver satin sheets.  He wondered what it would be like to take things further with Harry.  He imagined them kissing.  The image didn’t bother him.  Instead it intrigued him. What would it be like to kiss Harry?
After the last person had spoken, the time had come for Lucius’s interment. Several wizards and witches raised their wands to cast a complex combination of spells.  A flash of blinding light filled the drawing room, accompanied by a loud crack.  The flash of light instantaneously vanished and Lucius’s coffin had disappeared.
“Sure, Harry,” Hermione replied, “We’ll have you and Draco over for a meal in the next couple of weeks, and then we’ll work on introducing him to the other Weasleys.”  She then looked over at her husband and prompted, “Ron?”
Harry took a moment to reflect before responding, “Can you give me an example of a safety concern that might arise, and what Ms. Lancaster might do to ensure my safety?”
Harry took a deep breath and continued, “And when Hermione said she wished she could have helped more, and Ron called me the strongest wizard alive, I realized how lucky I am to have such brilliant friends who will always have my back.  I’m beyond grateful.  I love you two so much.”
“Fair enough,” Hermione said.  “Meanwhile I’ll do some research and get back to you.”
“Of course I have a Muggle phone!” Harry huffed. “How could the Head Auror not have a Muggle phone? Nowadays you can’t do good field work without one. I’ll have you know that I have the latest iPhone.”
“Yeah, I got myself off while sucking you off.  It was hot,” Harry replied.
Harry was surprised, to say the least. Having grown up in an abusive home with relatives who absolutely hated magic and hated him because he was a wizard, he had a hard time imagining a world in which Muggles accepted magic.  But he knew Hermione was brilliant and was playing the long game. She was a visionary and always had her eyes on the prize—a peaceful world in which everyone lived in harmony and was treated with respect.  Thinking about his friend’s vision, Harry felt love and admiration for her. Hermione was one of a kind.
“Do you have a Muggle phone?” Hermione asked. “If not, you can call from the Ministry.”
“Astoria,” Draco began, “You remember our former classmate, Harry Potter.”
Harry realized that he had become quite fond of Draco.  He was extremely intelligent and inquisitive, well informed on a wide range of topics, and an excellent conversationalist.  Harry found that, no matter what he and Draco talked about, the conversation was stimulating and informative.  Harry was impressed by Draco’s breadth of and thirst for knowledge.  Although Harry admired Hermione’s brilliance, he often found her to be a bit pedantic.  On the other hand, he could listen to Draco speak for hours on any topic he was passionate about—the discourse was bound to be exciting and entertaining.
“I think maybe a calming draught will help,” Hilda said.  She rose and left, returning soon with a cup of the potion.  Harry accepted the proffered drink gratefully.
Harry nodded and said, “Maybe you can ask Astoria if it’s OK for Scorpius to come stay with us for a while.  Would you like that?”
The wizards were a little shy with each other after their first sexual encounter and found conversation slightly awkward.  But they muddled through and mutually agreed that they both preferred to sleep in their own beds that night.  They did, however, share a tight embrace and a passionate kiss before bidding each other good night and retiring to their separate bedrooms.
Peering into the pensieve, Harry and Hilda watched Harry’s memory of Vernon and Petunia berating him.  Breathing heavily, Harry started describing the scene, “I’m five years old. They’re screaming at me. They’re screaming and screaming.  That I’m useless and good for nothing.  That I don’t deserve all the kindness they’ve shown me.  That my parents were horrible people who deserved to die.  That it was a shame I didn’t die with them.”
After the ceremony, Draco approached Harry and said, “Thank you for being here today. Your presence has been comforting.  Will you stay and visit with Scorpius and me for a while? It would mean a lot to me.”
Harry kissed Hermione on the cheek before leaving her office.
Hermione smiled kindly at Draco and said, “Of course, Draco.  I forgave you a long time ago.  And I know you’re not the same person you were back at Hogwarts because if you were, Harry wouldn’t have fallen in love with you.  He said as much last time he was here.”  She laughed then, and that drew a smile from Draco.
“Of course I’ll view the memory with you, Harry,” Draco said. “And no worries about my grief about my dad.  I think I’m coping with that pretty well.”
The friends shared a laugh.  “No, that wouldn’t do at all,” Harry agreed.  He added, “I haven’t agreed to this yet, mind you, but I’m not completely opposed to the idea.  I know that I do need some help.  I just need to think about it some more and to get some more information about how Muggle psychology works.”
Ron laughed heartily. “Yeah, can you imagine Hermione back in the day being as powerful as she is now? It was bad enough that she ran circles around us on our OWLs.”
“Honestly you two,” Hermione said affectionately.
He siphoned another memory into the pensieve, a memory of his aunt denying him food, banishing him to the cupboard under the stairs when he was ravenously hungry.
Harry took a deep breath before responding.  “We got married too young,” he said. “I think Ginny was in love with an image in her head of who I was, and not who I actually am.  She was in love with “The Boy Who Lived,” not Harry the complicated, difficult person.  And I was desperate for stability after the war, just wanting to settle down and live a comfortable, predictable life.  I thought Ginny could provide that.  We soon discovered that our pieces didn’t fit together too well.  But probably the most important reason we divorced is that I’m gay.”
Harry was deeply touched by Hilda’s reaction.  Few people knew of the pain Harry had suffered at the hands of the amoral former Hogwarts High Inquisitor.  Harry had testified at Umbridge’s trial, describing in detail the pain she had inflicted on him, and he had received many expressions of sympathy.  But this was the first time, seeing and hearing Hilda’s reaction, that Harry felt another person really understood how horrific those sessions with Umbridge had been.
“Mrs. Malfoy,” Harry said with a genteel bow. “It is an honor to be here, and I am so sorry for your loss.”
On a coolish day in mid-April Harry made his way to Dr. Keith Mathey’s office in Harley Street.  Harry had decided to take Muggle public transportation for a change.  It had been quite a while since he had spent much time in the Muggle world and he regarded this visit to see the Muggle psychologist as an adventure of sorts.
“I’m gonna come, Harry,” he shouted.
Hermione’s voice softened to a whisper and she looked like she was about to cry. Harry could tell that she was thinking about the pain he had endured.  She was not only the brightest, most powerful witch he knew, but also the most compassionate. She hated seeing anyone suffer. That’s why she dedicated so much time and energy to the house-elf liberation movement and donated a large portion of her income to the Society for the Protection of Elfish Welfare (SPEW).
The wizards gave each other a warm hug then and headed to their bedrooms.
Draco smiled and said, “Hello, Hugo, hello, Rose, I’m very pleased to meet you.”
“It helped to consider why he might have acted the way he did,” Harry replied. “I’ll never know for sure what his motivation was, and I certainly will never hear those words from him.  Still, it helps to entertain the possibility that he treated me badly not because I deserved it but because of his own issues.”
Harry had chosen a specific memory for Hermione and Ron to view.  The memory was from the Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff during their third year at Hogwarts.  Harry was soaring on his broomstick, eyes scanning all around him trying to catch a glimpse of the golden snitch, intent on finding it before Cedric Digory, the Hufflepuff seeker.  Suddenly the sky was filled with dementors and a wave of despair crashed over him.  Harry had never before in his life felt so hopeless and so afraid.  The unrelenting anguish was so overwhelming that he wasn’t able to maintain consciousness.  All he remembered after that was a sense of letting go and plummeting.  After he came to and realized that he had fallen from such a great height, he was amazed that he was still alive.
Harry said, “I think I have been avoiding the pain for too long.  One sign is that recently I have had recurring dreams about people who have died.  I wake up feeling intensely sad, then try to shake it off as quickly as I can and get on with my day.  I think my dreams are trying to tell me that I need to allow myself to grieve more.”
Keith shared his perspective with Harry, saying, “There is often the unreasonable expectation that we grieve quickly and move on.  I expect that is true not just of the British Muggle culture but also of the British magical culture.  The idea that time heals all wounds, and something is wrong with us if we’re still grieving after a lot of time has passed.   But that perspective isn’t helpful to someone who’s grieving.”
“It’s not surprising when you think about it, Pansy,” Draco complained to his long-time Slytherin friend.  “Potter gets to play the virtuous, all-forgiving Savior of the Wizarding World, defending his arch-nemesis, the disgusting Death-Eater, Draco Malfoy.  It’s another example of his huge Messianic complex.”
“Wow!” Scorpius exclaimed. “Did it hurt?”
“I wish he would be honest with me,” Harry replied.
That evening after supper, Harry talked to Draco about what he and Keith had discussed in his therapy session earlier in the day.
“Thank you,” Harry said softly.  “You’re the best.”
“Very good, Master Draco,” Timsy said, “Timsy will do as you asked.  Please follow me and make yourself comfortable in the parlor.”  Draco followed the house-elf and seated himself in a comfortable chair.
“So, it seems like there’s a bit of news you wanted to share with us,” Ron said.
“Well, it got me wondering,” Harry said, “if the Muggle psychologist and I could engage in a process similar to what Remus and I did years ago.  Like if I can encounter my demons, metaphorically speaking, and have an actual experience of fighting back or putting them in their place or banishing them for good.  And I think it would be good if I can employ all my resources, magical and non-magical, to the endeavor.”
“That I’ll tell Draco how I feel and he’ll end the friendship,” Harry admitted.
Harry grinned and said, “Yeah, at the Dursleys—that’s my aunt and uncle’s surname—I never knew if and when I’d get to eat again, so I got into the habit of keeping a small stash of food, whenever I could get my hands on it.”
Before long Ron strolled into the parlor and greeted Harry with a warm smile. “Hello, mate! Seems like we haven’t seen each other in ages.  Hermione’s the lucky one, seeing you at the Ministry every day.”
“Almost,” Harry said with a grin.
Harry decided to talk to Draco the following day after work.  After dinner the two wizards retired to the drawing room and settled comfortably in overstuffed chairs in front of the fireplace. Harry decided to take the plunge. “There’s something I’ve been meaning to tell you, Draco,” he said. Draco looked up inquiringly at Harry.  This wasn’t how Harry usually started their conversations.
Hilda took a seat on the sofa next to Harry.  Keith said, “The next step is for you and Hilda to watch the memories together.  Harry, I’d like you to describe what you are seeing in the present tense, as if he were happening right here and now.”
“I can’t believe I’m saying this,” Pansy ventured, “having been voted the most skeptical Slytherin in our class, but don’t you think you’re being a bit too cynical?  Mightn’t Potter have defended you because he believed it was the right thing to do and not because he’d benefit from it?  After all, he did catch a lot of heat afterwards.  Accusations of being a traitor to the cause, even getting death threats from some nut cases, if you can believe the Daily Prophet.”
Hilda reached over and touched him gently on the shoulder.  Keith inquired gently, “How are you feeling now, Harry?”
Harry arrived for his second therapy appointment with Dr. Mathey and Ms. Lancaster.  Since his first session he had thought about what “little t traumas” he wanted to start working on.  Even though it might not be considered a minor trauma in another person’s life, Harry thought he would start with his childhood abuse at the home of the Dursleys.  Given the many and intense traumatic experiences in Harry’s life, what he had suffered living with the Dursleys, while extremely unpleasant, was at least not life-threatening.  Moreover, it had all happened so long ago.  These days Harry tended to think of his painful childhood experiences as bad dreams that disappeared upon awakening.
Draco laughed. “I should say so.  You’re talented, Harry.”
Grinning at Harry, Draco said, “Harry, you’re so very lucky to have such good-looking godchildren.  Shall we give them their present now?”
“If you don’t mind my asking,” Draco said, “why did you and Ginny break up?  You always seemed like the perfect couple.”
*****
Draco laughed then, a little bitterly.  “Yes, two good-looking purebloods.  A match made in heaven.  My parents were so happy when we got engaged.  Looking back I see we got married because we were expected to.  But we never had any chemistry.  It was almost like living with a stranger—we were always so civil, so polite to each other, like an emotionless business arrangement.  But we both fell in love with Scorpius when he came along.  He bonded us for a while but that just wasn’t enough for us to last.  And now we’re going to have to figure out how to share custody.”
“I suppose that it did,” Harry said, “but it happened when I was younger than you are now, so I don’t remember.”
“But when do you get to see your kids, Harry?” Draco asked.
*****
“Well, if you insist,” Draco said, giving in.
After Harry had finished speaking, Keith asked, “How was that experience for you, Harry?”
“It was amazing to view that memory with my two best friends,” Harry said with sincerity.  “I didn’t feel so alone—it was almost like they were actually there with me, and that was comforting.  So the memory lost a lot of power.  Now when I think of that experience, I can picture Hermione and Ron with me.”
Before now friendships had never been particularly satisfying to Draco.  At Hogwarts he had been vaguely aware that he envied Harry his intensely close friendships with Ron and Hermione.  The three of them obviously had each other’s backs.  In contrast, Draco had Crabbe and Goyle, who not only weren’t the sharpest knives in the drawer, but would also betray Draco in a heartbeat if it would benefit them.  His relationships with Pansy and Blaise had been based on what he now recognized as a shared nastiness, full of snide and scornful humor.  Fortunately, he and Pansy had outgrown that pattern and were now able to converse as mature adults.  Blaise, however, seemed forever stuck in adolescence.  As for Astoria, Draco supposed that he did feel love for her, although there was a coolness, a reserve that had always characterized their relationship, and that relationship was now on rocky ground.
Hermione nodded in sympathy, and said, “So tell me how this all relates to Muggle psychotherapy.”
She stood up from her chair.  Draco rose too and pulled her into a hug.  Tears welled up in Draco’s eyes and a single tear rolled down Astoria’s cheek.  “Goodbye, Draco,” she said. “Goodbye, Astoria,” Draco replied before he broke away from the hug and disapparated.
Harry explained to Keith and Hilda his decision to focus first on his experiences of childhood abuse.  They agreed that a pensieve would be useful to access and work with Harry’s childhood memories.  Harry would retrieve specific memories from his time at the Dursleys, he and Hilda would watch and describe the memories, and Keith would guide Harry to do the therapeutic work as he revisited scenes from his childhood.
Harry talks to Hermione, Ron and Draco about his pensieve work in therapy and asks if they are willing to view some of his memories.
Hermione then asked, “So how can we support your relationship, Harry?”
Harry expressed his understanding with a nod, and Keith continued.  “Grief isn’t the problem.  Grief reflects how important a relationship is to us.  The more important the relationship, the deeper the grief.  I’d like you to think of your grief as honoring the relationships you are grieving, honoring the people you lost.  Think about how to grieve well, acknowledging what you have lost and expressing the feelings associated with that loss.  The goal is to grieve well, as opposed to not grieving at all.”
Harry and Draco's relationship continues to develop.  Harry visits Hermione and Ron and tells them about his new relationship status.
Harry clutched onto Draco and cried into his shoulder. Draco kept whispering in Harry’s ear.  “I could see how much you loved and admired Cedric, Harry, and even though I viewed your memory I can’t imagine the kind of pain you experienced.  I’m awestruck, Harry, by how brave you were, how much strength and integrity you had, and you were just a kid.  I wish I had known back then how incredible you were.  The love and admiration you had for Cedric—well that’s how I feel towards you now.”
Of course Harry never expected or wanted Malfoy to thank him for mounting a defense at his trial.  That was not in the realm of possibility and would have made Harry extremely uncomfortable.  Even though there were so many things about Malfoy that Harry couldn’t abide, the Gryffindor couldn’t help but feel some compassion for the git.  A startling realization that had come to Harry a few years ago was that, if he had to choose between being Lucius Malfoy’s son and living with the Dursleys, he would choose the latter in a heartbeat. That awareness led him to reflect on what Draco’s life had been like.  Maybe as bad as or possibly even worse than his own had been?
Sensing Harry’s confusion, Hermione clarified, “I’m speaking as a friend, not as a boss now.  Your work is impeccable, always has been.  You’re a brilliant Auror and your team respects you.”
“Sounds like a plan,” Draco said.  “Harry?”
After running his fingers through Harry's hair, Draco makes a number of choices. Some of the actions he takes are conscious, others are unconscious.
“Thank you both,” Draco said with sincerity.  “That means a lot to me.”
“Well, if you’re sure,” Draco said, still sounding doubtful.
“Well, I kept that a secret from everyone, even you and Ron,” Harry admitted. “I was ashamed of being so scared, especially when the Slytherins made fun of me after that horrible experience on the Hogwarts Express.”
A wave of anxiety washed over Harry.  If the physical contact between him and Draco were to increase, it would be harder for Harry to keep his sexual attraction to Draco in check.  And yet he longed for Draco’s touch.  Eventually he said, “Our hugs felt so good to me too, Draco, and I’m fine with more physical contact.  I guess I’m more comfortable letting you initiate though.”  Deciding in the moment to be more honest, he added, “You know I’m gay, so I’m likely to be more open than you to certain kinds of physical contact, and I don’t want to cross your boundaries.  That’s why I think it’s better if you do the initiating.”
“Yes,” Harry replied, “but let’s wait until after supper, OK? It’s a bit complicated, so maybe the three of us can have a quiet sit-down after we eat.”
Harry couldn’t deny that he found Draco physically attractive, but he was doing a good job of managing those feelings. After all, Draco was married to Astoria Greengrass and was presumably straight as an arrow.  Harry hated when people in whom he had no interest would flirt with him and try to gain his attention, and he vowed never to act like that towards anyone, especially a heterosexual wizard.  Still, there were times when Draco’s stunning good looks would overwhelm him, and his breath would catch in his throat.  At those moments Harry would sternly chide himself, reaffirming his intention to refrain from behaving like a lovesick schoolboy.  Harry would remind himself that Draco’s friendship was what he most valued, and that any romantic or sexual feelings he had for Draco would threaten that friendship.
“Well, maybe, Pans,” Draco replied, “but don’t expect me to thank that scarhead.”
“Three months in the country sounds lovely,” Harry replied. “And it’ll be heaven being there with you and Scorpius.  But what about your mother?”
Draco gave Harry an inquisitive look, silently encouraging him to continue.
Before long Astoria entered the parlor and greeted him.  “This is a surprise, Draco.  To what do I owe the pleasure?” she said politely.  She sat down in a nearby chair and faced her husband.
The last task the wizards had to accomplish that day was to deal with the cellar, where prisoners of the Dark Lord had been held during the Second Wizarding War.  This room held painful memories for both Harry and Draco, but they were determined to illuminate the dark space and dispel all distressing memories. The first thing Harry did upon entering the cellar was to cast a Fenestrato spell, creating windows at the tops of all four cellar walls.  As the light streamed in, the atmosphere in the room was instantly transformed, immediately feeling less ominous and depressing.  Harry and Draco continued to cast spells and charms, brightening up the cellar with color, life, and light.   When they had finished, they looked at each other and smiled.
“OK, so you have several options, Harry,” Keith summarized.  “You can say and do nothing, that’s always an option.  On the other end of the continuum is full disclosure.  Then in between those two options you can tell him you enjoy his company and ask him to stay, or you can tell him you have strong feelings for him and you’ll respect his boundaries.  Of those four options, is there one that appeals to you more than the others?”
When Draco’s anxiety was skyrocketing before his father’s funeral, Harry was able to talk him down.  He reassured Draco that everything would go like clockwork, and that Draco would do his father proud.  Harry promised to be there for Draco, and he was as good as his word.  At Lucius’s funeral Draco had relied on Harry for emotional support.  Just having Harry there made the grief-filled day significantly less painful.
Harry continued to make good progress in his therapy sessions with Keith and Hilda.  Starting in August he began working through his grief about losing Remus, Tonks and Sirius.  This was difficult and painful work, but Harry was nothing if not courageous and tackled it head on.  He knew that eventually he would have to address his terrifying near death experiences, but he knew that Keith would guide him towards that point gradually and with sensitivity.  Harry also knew that Draco would provide whatever emotional support he required.
Harry asks Draco to view his memory of Cedric Diggory's murder.  Draco agrees, and the two wizards share an emotional moment.
“Yes, mum,” the children said in unison before heading upstairs.
“Group hug?” Hermione suggested.  The three Gryffindors stood up and held each other tightly.
Harry, Draco and Hilda wept profusely when they viewed Peter Pettigrew murder Cedric with Voldemort’s wand in the Little Hangleton graveyard.  Draco gasped in astonishment when he saw Cedric’s shadow emerge from Voldemort’s wand and watched Harry transport Cedric’s body and the Triwizard Cup back to Hogwarts. The tears were streaming down the faces of the wizards and witch as they watched Harry cling to Cedric's body, crying and screaming.
Scorpius’s eyes widened then, and he said, “You’re the boy who lived?!”
Since Draco’s trial it seemed as though the two men had tacitly agreed to a ceasefire.  Harry observed that Draco no longer sneered or rolled his eyes at him but would simply give him a curt nod when they passed each other at work or in public.  Harry would nod back.  But on rare occasions, especially when Draco was feeling particularly happy about something, he would verbally greet Harry, saying “Potter” and bowing his head slightly.  At those times Harry would respond, “Hello, Malfoy.”  Harry noticed that he preferred the verbal greetings to the silent head nods.
“I’m sorry to barge in on you like this, Astoria,” Draco said, “but I had an urgent need to talk to you about our marriage.”
Harry took a deep breath and then said, “Which brings me to why I wanted to tell you about my therapy.”
“Absolutely not,” Draco said. “I’m definitely up for more. And next time I want to give as well as receive.”
“You’ll always be my best mate,” Ron said.
During his next several therapy sessions, Harry continued to do pensieve work with the help of Keith and Hilda.  They agreed that for the time being he would focus on painful experiences that were not life-threatening.  Only after he was feeling more resolved about those experiences would they proceed to address Harry’s “big T traumas.”
“So what’s up, Harry?” Ron asked.  “You told ‘Mione you had something important to talk to us about.”
Ron said, “He looks like he’s about the same age as Rose, six or seven?  You must bring him by sometime for a play date with Rose and Hugo.”
Draco bowed his head slightly and whispered, “Thank you.”
Harry pretended to deliberate for a moment, while the children stared at him expectantly.  Then he smiled and produced a Muggle game called “Gnomes at Night.”  He figured that they probably already owned most of the magical games and toys available at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, so a Muggle game was a safe bet.
Harry, Draco and Hilda looked away from the pensieve, overcome with emotion and unable to speak. Keith looked at them with concern. “Hilda,” he said, “do we need a magical intervention at this point?  It’s clear that was an intensely powerful and extremely painful memory.”
The conversation then shifted to less emotionally charged topics—Hugo’s and Rose’s progress on their studies, recent business at Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, and the latest staff changes at the Ministry.
As word got around the British community of wizards and witches that Harry and Draco were now a gay couple, the wizards attracted even more attention than before.  The magical tabloids ran sensational stories about the relationship between the Boy Who Lived and the former Death Eater, and Harry and Draco had to lay low for a while to avoid the publicity.  But they had each other for support, as well as a sense of humor about it all, which helped them to survive whatever life threw their way.
The wizards were facing away from each other so neither could see the expression on the other’s face.
“Are you sure about that?” Draco said, skeptical.
As the two men spent more and more time together, Draco’s distrust of Harry continued to erode. Draco was now confiding personal information to Harry that he had never shared with another soul.  It had begun with the conversation in which both men had talked openly about their marriages and Harry had come out to Draco.  After that conversation Draco was inclined to turn to Harry whenever he needed advice or support.
Harry nodded and continued.  “Recently I revisited a particularly difficult memory.  When Hilda viewed the memory in the pensieve, it affected her deeply.  Her reaction and subsequent words to me were healing.  Keith then suggested it might benefit my healing process for some close friends to view some of my painful memories and share their reactions with me.  I was reluctant to ask you because it’s not exactly a pleasant business.  I didn’t want to subject you to any more distress than I already have through the years.  And I certainly don’t want you to feel obligated.  It’s perfectly fine if you’d rather not.”
“Yes,” Hilda replied, “I just need a moment.”  She closed her eyes and took a minute or two to compose herself.  She then said, “I was initially tempted to cast a soothing charm and to rush out and bring us all cups of calming draught.  But then I realized that it would be better not to blunt our responses to Harry’s memory before sharing those responses.”
Draco was astonished when Iphigenia appeared at his window and even more astonished when he read Harry’s message.  Try as he might, Draco couldn’t find fault with the letter.  Potter certainly hadn’t written it to appear virtuous, as no one other than Draco would know of its existence.  Nor did the letter seem phony. Harry had actually hinted at the enmity that had existed between Lucius and himself, writing, “Although your father and I never did see eye to eye, I know that Lucius Malfoy was a man of many parts, and I’m very sorry for your loss.”  Draco found himself admiring that sentence.  It was diplomatic, kind and, Draco suspected, sincere.
“But why do you think I of all people should see a Muggle psychologist?” Harry asked.
”Minister,” Draco greeted Hermione formally.  He didn’t know what to make of her presence and so thought it best to remain silent after greeting her.
“Well, like I said, Ron was really angry at me because I had kept secrets from him.  Hermione was sad but supportive.  I suspect Ginny had been confiding in ‘Mione about how she wasn’t happy in our marriage, so it probably came as no surprise.  Arthur and Molly were upset, I know, but they are a class act.  They said that I would always be a part of their family and would always be welcome in their home.  The other Weasley men, Bill, Charlie, and George, followed Ginny’s lead.  She stated very clearly to her family that our divorce had been a mutual decision and that we had agreed to stay on good terms.  The Weasleys are truly amazing people, and I feel incredibly blessed that they still consider me a member of their family.”
After inheriting the ancestral home from his godfather Sirius Black, Harry considered it his duty to be a good custodian of the many historical treasures on the property.  Studying the Black family tree, Harry was bothered by the fact that it was so out of date.  Black family descendants born in the last three decades were not on the tapestry.  Harry was also troubled that disowned members of the family had been removed from the tapestry, burn marks appearing in place of their names. The thought occurred to him that a powerful symbol of dismantling the ideology of blood purity that had engendered the wizarding wars would be to update the tapestry, restoring and adding Black family members who were not pureblood or who had married non-pureblood spouses.
Since the conversation in which Harry had come out to Draco, the wizards had not talked again about Harry’s sexual orientation.  Draco did wonder, however, about Harry’s love life.  He had talked about a one-year relationship with a gay wizard named Eoin.  Did Harry have other gay lovers? Did he continue to visit the Walloping Wand, looking for sexual partners? And what about his experience with women? Had he been intimate with any women other than Ginevra Weasley?
Draco’s mouth opened in surprise. “Oh!” was all he could manage, followed by several beats of deafening silence.  Eventually he said, “But you fathered three children, so you can’t be all that gay.”
“I’m so sorry, Draco,” Hermione said.  Draco nodded to acknowledge her expression of sympathy.
“Thank you, Harry,” Draco said, looking intently into Harry’s emerald eyes.  “You’re a good friend.”
“Well, if you’re sure, Draco,” Harry said tentatively.
It was decided that Draco and Harry would apparate at Malfoy Manor to select clothes and whatever other personal effects Draco required and teleport these belongings to 12 Grimmauld Place.  While at the manor, they would also inform Draco’s house elf Roody that his services would be required at Harry’s residence until further notice.  Draco insisted that his owl, Hellebora, not be transported via a spell.  Instead he would instruct Hellebora to fly to 12 Grimmauld Place and attend him there for the duration of his stay.
“I’ll tell you at the tavern,” Draco said.
“Intense,” Harry replied. “Until I started speaking, I didn’t realize how much I had repressed and denied about my relationship with Snape.  It surprises me now that I named my son Albus Severus, seeing how much anger I harbored for the way Snape treated me all those years.  I suppose that when Albus was born I was focused more on Snape’s work as a double agent during the war and how he protected me, rather than on how badly he treated me at Hogwarts.”
Draco replied, “He’ll turn seven in February, and he’d be thrilled to meet Rose and Hugo.  He doesn’t get to spend much time with other kids.”
After closing the office door, Dr. Mathey made the introductions.  “Mr. Potter, please meet my associate Ms. Hilda Lancaster.  Hilda, please meet Mr. Harry Potter.”  Harry and Ms. Lancaster exchanged polite greetings.
After supper Hermione instructed Hugo and Rose to attend to their studies.  Harry thought how challenging it would be to have a mother who had received Outstanding grades on all her Ordinary Wizarding Levels.  He imagined that Hermione would expect her children to be as studious and as academically gifted as she was.
“Oh, Ron, we were kids then.  It’s all bygones now,” Harry replied.
“Hello, Draco,” Hermione said, “And please call me Hermione. No need for formality after all these years.  I am sorry for your loss.”
Keith listened intently to Harry’s narrative, and then said, “Harry, you started out by saying you were confused about your relationship with Draco and obsessing about it.  Tell me what is confusing to you?”
Harry took a long pause, and it was clear to Draco that he was going back in his mind to an earlier time.   Draco was sitting on the edge of his seat, anxious to hear more.  Eventually Harry continued, “I started frequenting The Walloping Wand, the gay bar in Diagon Alley.  In Auror training I had learned some transfiguration spells so I was able to disguise myself enough to be unrecognizable.  I was petrified that someone would discover that the Head Auror of the Ministry of Magic, the Boy Who Lived, was gay.  At the Walloping Wand I met a gay wizard named Eoin. We hit it off, one thing led to another, and we ended up having a year-long affair.”
“Have you spoken to her since getting the news about your father?” Harry asked gently.
*****
After siphoning several memories of his encounters with Professor Snape into the pensieve, Harry and Hilda viewed the memories, after which Harry began to describe them to Keith and reflect on his relationship with the professor who he always believed hated him.   Keith encouraged Harry to imagine that he was talking directly to Snape.  “What do you want to say to him, Harry?”
“I bet you did,” Keith said with a smile that conveyed understanding and acceptance.
“I expect so,” Hermione said. “I’m proud of you, Harry, for sticking with it.”
Harry explained how he came to be a client of Dr. Mathey, who knew all about the magical world and was respected in wizarding healing circles.  Harry also explained that Dr. Mathey worked with Ms. Lancaster, who was both a psychological technician and a witch.
“Not much to tell,” Harry replied.  “I had my weekly therapy appointment.”
