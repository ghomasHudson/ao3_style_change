Bell: ew boys
“He just got asked to the ball,” Ginny grins up at him. “Right in the Entrance Hall.”
Ronald:
“Yes Professor,” he says, though Harry can hear the quiver in his voice so close to his ear.
Sirius’ box is the most exciting. Inside is a small penknife, chrome and with a dark wood grip, including tools to unlock any lock and undo any knot. In the lid of the box is a note and a small photograph. On it reads,
“Yep, sure. I’ll do it in class then.” She rolls her eyes. “Binns won’t notice!”
Ronaldo: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
“Oh yeah? Why is Goody-Two-Shoes-Granger having a giggle over there then?” George asks.
“That’s our cue to leave,” Ron mutters, nodding to Harry and hurrying his brother and Hermione out.
You: He was my parents’ secret keeper when they were in hiding
He says it loudly enough for Ron to hear, but he doesn’t give much of an indication that he’s listening.
“Harry, my boy,” Bagman says lowly, pulling him aside. “Is there anything I can help you with?”
Freckles: wdym ‘ew’
Harry shrugs, feeling his heart race in his chest even as he keeps his expression firmly impassive. “Makes things a bit easier then, doesn’t it.”
“What is it Pansy says? Ah, polecats!”
The others nod in gleeful agreement, deciding suddenly that they actually aren’t tired at all. Harry turns back to Dobby and tries to give him his kindest smile.
“I’m not stupid enough to count.”
Freckles: Fred Weasley
Greckles: and we’ve never heard you say anything like this towards those Dursley people
“School seems a silly thing to be worried about, what with someone possibly out to get you killed,” Ron muses.
“If you hadn’t been mooning over Krum all summer, I might not have so much of a good argument!”
Greckles: just,, don’t
Crookshanks: Oh?
comes the voice again, slightly louder.
Harry glances down at the star on his finger. It’s bronze and shimmery. He grins.
It has a strange, skeletal atmosphere, as if raised long lost from the bottom of the ocean and returned to purpose. The rigging drapes aesthetically, functional but greying, and the portholes are filled with a misty light that makes the whole ship seem like it’s shrouded in fog.
“That’s good,” Harry says, as Malfoy mutters, “I didn’t palm them off on anyone.”
I have no excuses except for my very poor self-control 😔
That said, apparently my brain does not properly count this as Harry Potter, and so don't worry about me leaving you hanging. I'll be writing until I deem myself finished, whenever that may be :)
Harry snorts. “Fred, I think you’re the only one other than Hagrid and Hermione herself to make that connection.”
He thinks of Cho, then, and the way Ginny looks at him sometimes when she sees him enter the room. As previously established, Hermione is one of his most invaluable friends, but still objectively very pretty. He thinks of Ron's easy laugh and the way he scrunches his brow and chews his tongue when he concentrates. Now that he thinks about it, he decides that Dean and Seamus seem to at least fancy each other a little bit—the tiniest bit, so quiet, the kind that comes with loud public proclamations of love in the corridors—and that Cedric
Crookshanks: @Snake what is this about?
“My cloak,” Harry grins, feeling emboldened by adrenaline. “Do you have anything to disguise yourself with?”
“No,” Ron says, “I really can’t go in this, it’s not good enough, I—”
Ronaldo: sus
I wish I was at the Yule Ball chapters already. Wouldn't that have been amazing? My sincerest regrets :')
“If I’d given it to you, you’d’ve just stolen everything,” Harry says reasonably. Seamus pouts.
“Oh yeah?” asks Ron.
Quaffle: what how did you do that with the stars
“Not yet, but I’m sure he’ll be here any moment now.”
Ronald: it’s bad
Harry looks to the goblet in his hand and realises that yes, he has been trying to drink from an empty cup for several minutes. He sighs and puts it down, ears burning.
Ron lifts his goblet of orange juice. “Hear hear. Let’s take that as it is and pretend everything’s fine.”
Ronald: what the fuck
Ron frowns, scrubbing at his face. “What was that?”
Ronald: fine
“It’s not a problem, Potter. It’s hardly like it isn’t for my own benefit, anyway.”
“They rely on magic to survive,” she explains. “Mr Crouch letting Winky go was an abhorrent thing to do, with that in mind: he could have killed her, if she hadn’t ended up here. No one wants to hire a disgraced elf, because allowing them to live on their magic makes them too vulnerable to take the risk.”
Hermione frowns. “We don’t have
Snake: Wow :/ better than Flint tbh
“Right, well, go on Harry,” Hermione says.
Ron checks his watch. “Almost six now,” he says. “D’you think they’re coming by train?”
“Didn’t see that one working out, either,” Draco says. “Cassius was never going to say yes if his mother had a chance of finding out… I wonder what happened.”
“I didn’t know you were bringing her,” he says. “The champions aren’t supposed to know about this, and she’s bound to tell Delacour, isn’t she?”
“You don’t have to shout,” Malfoy says. “And make sure you have your intent.”
Harry’s scowl deepens. “We aren’t.”
You: I blew my uncle’s sister up like a balloon last august
take it out on your friend Granger
Not unexpectedly, Ron grumbles for the rest of the lesson.
“Make sure you do!” Ginny shouts, but he doesn’t reply. He forces a grin and a thumbs-up for some third-years who shout
“Oh good, you’re all here!” announces Ludo Bagman, entering the tent. He looks around and frowns, glancing between the extra, obviously unexpected visitors.
By Friday all the constant talk of dancing and dates has Harry both exhausted and tied up in knots. He lies in his bed in the dormitory, staring unseeingly up at the canopy and listening to Ron’s snores.
“Have you told Diggory yet?” Malfoy mutters into his ear in Potions the next afternoon.
Neville’s baby tree-climbing moles chirrup noisily a few places away as Parvati feeds them bits of sausage.
“I’m sure you’ll be fine,” Hermione sighs. She’s holding open the door and smiling in that way that means she thinks he’s funny.
Snape is seething by now, and Harry is pleased as anything to go. He snatches his bag back off the floor and sends a grimace over his shoulder to Ron’s pitiful pleading expression.
“He insisted on coming when he heard Ron saying that Hagrid wanted to see me.” Harry scowls.
With the golden plates eventually scraped clean, Dumbledore takes to his feet again, coming to stand at his lectern. The hall buzzes with excitement and quiet chattering.
“I think it’s a good idea,” Hermione says. “I’ll deal with that this evening. Go on then, there’s no reason to hang around.”
The book jumps and knocks him in the chest. Harry fumbles to catch it before it falls on the floor again.
“Hmmm… Dragons can fly, can’t they? But I don’t think Dumbledore would let them loose around so many people, he’s not
“Harry,” says Cedric, as he wanders over. “You all right?”
Malfoy sits in an armchair, nose in the book on European dragons Harry had found and bookmarked. Hermione has the one on East Asia.
Sadly, because it has to at some point, the next Friday comes around. Since the introduction of Hagrid’s group project, most of the fourth year Slytherins and Gryffindors had been startlingly civil. In fact, the only nice interactions Harry have had with those outside of his house have been with Malfoy, Zabini, and Parkinson. Ish. Harry thinks he must be really desperate if he’s calling Malfoy and Parkinson nice (ish).
“Thank you,” she smiles. “Shall we go?”
Rita Skeeter pulls open another door a few paces from where they are. “We don’t want to be in there with all that noise,” she says, opening the door. “Ah, this’ll do. Nice and cosy.”
Harry grins. “Something like that, yeah.”
He hums. Charlie rolls over for tummy pets. “Oh, by the way Harry, you have an owl.”
Dennis’ guess is the best they get before the unidentified looming object draws close enough to be discernible. Rather than a house or a dragon, the Beauxbatons’ transport is a ginormous horse-drawn carriage, the horses of which are both winged and absolutely
Crookshanks: Ron don’t be disgusting
“Ther’s one for each champion, isn’t there? What do they hafta do? Fight ’em?”
it shouts.
Cedric is hauled in by Madam Pomfrey, who closes the curtains around his gurney.
You: Shut up
“That will be changed shortly,” she says. “I expect you to find yourself a partner, Potter, and soon. Take Mr Weasley, if you have to. Off you go now.”
Snake: Elaborate on that
He frowns, barely restraining his knee-jerk reaction to cross out the idea immediately. He’s not… Well, Hermione said so herself: there’s nothing wrong with it. He’s not scared of the possibility. Better not to leap head-first to conclusions, though.
“Come on,” Hermione says. “We need to get back for Charms. And after that you’re writing to Sirius, Harry. He’ll want to find out from you and not the paper, I’d think.”
“What?”
Freckles: :) <3
Ronaldo: you’re not allowed to make us feel bad for you you’re a prick
Well, he’s glad the school has stopped actively making his life misery. Mostly.
She laughs, letting shimmering hair slip over her shoulder. “You’re not going to
“Well, we’ll just have to make sure everyone’s away.”
He holds up a hand. “Nobody is expecting instant results. If you want my help, at least do as I ask you.”
Bill: he shouldn’t be able to access his vault
Freckles: who are you ordering around now
“And before the World Cup he kept badgering me for when you were both arriving.”
Flint: Also I thought Wood would be all over this
“Harry!” says Hermione’s voice from behind him.
“Well, we tried to ask McGonagall how the champions are chosen,” says George.
She, Harry and Ron run out to the front of the castle just before dinner that evening, when fewest people are around.
“We were looking for you! Should have known you’d be here.”
“On such a note, I think it is time for bed. There shall be no lessons tomorrow, owing to the excitement of the contest. I bid you all a goodnight, and sweet dreams.”
“You know?” Harry says. “Why am I the only one who doesn’t!”
Freckles: so now we’re waiting to see when she notices
“Bloody hell, are you all right?” Ron asks. He thumps his back for him. “You’re not even there yet, don’t hurt yourself already.”
“I am,” Krum says, and flicks his wand. The robes ripple and an ink wash of black flows over them. He flicks his wand again and Cedric yelps, twisting around to see his back. A large black H has embroidered itself onto his Hufflepuff robes, satisfyingly eye-catching.
“Oh!” Harry says. “Yeah.”
“Well, I fed him a few bits by hand, and it seemed to encourage him to finish the bowl,” Harry says. “And everyone but Phobos seems to be using the litter tray. Clever, aren’t they.”
Harry looks up at Malfoy in irritation. He stands smirking over them with the veela girl from before on his arm. She snorts indelicately, and he looks about to preen.
She walks towards Dumbledore with a graceful smile, extending a hand laden with glittering jewellery.
“Can you hear something?” Ginny asks suddenly.
You: Okay
“You’ve been handling him with a very good humour, recently,” Ron remarks.
Ronald: MOV_0021
“Having you for a nosy git of a brother,” George says.
“You’re an absolute
“You’re bullying me again. This isn’t fair. It’s not like Harry’s any better. Hell, he’s worse! He’s wearing that stupid badge! And you—stop hanging out with my brother! He’s an idiot, and you’re way above him!”
“Oh?” Zabini says.
“Any bigger and Hagrid won’t be able to handle any of them,” Harry says. “That’s if he hasn’t already been attacked by something.”
“Wuss!” Ginny taunts. “Chicken!”
Danny: Daniel Mulligan [HPHM MC; OC]
People behind Harry are laughing. He doesn’t quite see the joke.
Harry licks his lips and darts his eyes around them before settling back on Draco’s tensed shoulders. “All right, well how about now?”
Bill: …
Cedric flashes him a pained grimace. “Nothing good, I’m afraid.”
You: dshsf??
Otherwise, please enjoy!
“Enchantingly nasty,” Dumbledore replies. “I especially enjoyed the description of my senile incompetence. Very succinct.”
Ronald: Bill said he shouldn’t be able to access his vault
The front doors swing open behind them. Everyone in the Entrance Hall turns to watch as the Durmstrang company stride through. Krum is out in the lead with a gorgeous girl in blue robes that Harry doesn’t recognise.
“Potter!” Harry sees McGonagall and Hagrid running towards him. “Potter, that was incredible!”
She hoots lethargically, dips her beak into his goblet of juice, and takes off again for a good long sleep at her perch.
“Love the new look!” George says, plonking himself down on the sofa beside him.
Quaffle: bc mcg lets me sneak out to fly on the pitch at midnight and I enable all your dumb shit ideas <3
“Come with me!” Hagrid says, ushering him out of the cabin. “Oh, an’ put tha’ cloak on!”
Harry flips them back to see he, Neville, Seamus and Dean peering through their own at him. “Sorry, Dobby came to visit. Go back to sleep.”
“No, no… you’re saving me…” He scrubs at his boiling face and sighs.
Gryffindor vs Ravenclaw!
“Look, Malfoy—”
“Well, you can come if you be quiet and don’t make a fuss,” Harry allows. He digs into his cottage pie and tries to ignore the buzzing in his stomach.
“No, it’s okay,” she tells him. Her voice is as gentle as always and her hair is glossy and soft-looking. She smiles, and it kind of just makes him feel worse. “They’re all being mean, we don’t blame you.”
—licks his hand. Harry lets a shiver run through himself, pretending the chill from the wall has seeped through his cloak. He doesn’t let go.
“Pretty. Anyway, what do they want me for?”
They find Ron exactly where Harry had left him, only now he’s hiding in his hands and they’re not entirely sure he’s not crying. Parvati stands back and surveys him, twirling her wand between her fingers and sending out a shower of pink bubbles. They make the room smell like what he’d imagine the ocean on a desert island might smell like.
“Get used to it,” Ron grumbles. “They won’t get bored for a while.”
“Potter,” Malfoy says, sitting down on the bench beside him. His voice lacks the customary unimpressed drawl, and Harry frowns very carefully at him. Maybe the Gryffindors are getting used to their mortal enemies turning up at their table, or maybe they just think it’s all a trick. Either way, the lack of glares and shocked faces has Harry worried for everyone’s sanity, despite his and Draco’s maybe-budding camaraderie. Maybe.
‘foreign’—
“I wonder if I could have a little word with Harry before we start? The youngest champion, you know… Just to add a bit of colour.”
Angelina nods and assesses Ron’s predicament, studiously ignorant of his rising blush as she does so. She runs her wand over his dress shirt and seems to persuade it to absorb all of the frills. It’s quite impressive.
“Teaching,” he replies, eyeing Harry, but he sets Malfoy down nonetheless.
“Don’t trip me,” Malfoy replies. Harry rolls his eyes but says nothing, leading them down the steps of the castle.
“That doesn’t sound like a good sign,” Harry says weakly, but Florence only laughs.
“What the hell was that?” Ron hisses, accidentally showering the table between them with crumbs.
“Easier said than done…” Ron grumbles, and he’s right.
Bill: McGonagall won’t tell she liked us too much
Disclaimer: To copy a message from my last 2/3 posts, I really didn't think I was going to post this at all. This was more a casual project of bursts of inspiration than anything, but I'm afraid all of that left after JKR started spouting vitriol over on twitter. I thought I would go ahead and post this regardless, just for the few people who may take some enjoyment out of it :)
“Harry Potter, good luck today.”
Greckles: don’t go there Ron
“Never!” jeer Fred and George, grasping the high of success with both hands. Harry takes his seat and makes sure he still has all eight cats. Avennia mewls in his ear and tries to chew his hair.
She pulls back and smiles. “As will you.”
Ginny: then why aren’t you taking this seriously?
Harry pulls the cloth down and stares at it. All around him there are people snickering, but Harry can’t help the smile threatening to break through again in the wake of Malfoy’s retreat. In his hand is a very fine cotton handkerchief, embroidered heavily around the edge and emblazoned with the Malfoy family crest and a very looping
He glances around at the others, but they’re not paying him any attention. Cedric is pacing, and Fleur and Krum are back to looking mildly ill.
In robes of dark bronze that make his eyes swim like molten metal, Florence stands at least a foot taller than him, even with only a short afro and Harry’s tragedy of a mop. He gets them about a quarter of the way around the floor before he finds who he’s looking for and winks to Harry.
Potter,” Madam Pomfrey insists. She bustles over and prods him onto a bed. “Now don’t move, I need to clean this.”
"Yet," Harry whispers, but they all hear him anyway. Ron smacks his shoulder.
He gives up when he slices his finger open and reaches for his wand instead.
“Don’t hurry back!” Ginny calls after him.
The group laughs again, and Harry grins. Ron gives him a thumbs up too.
Harry grimaces and looks away. Yeah, of course.
“Someone’s had a look at their vocabulary list this week,” Harry mutters under his breath. “I was just going to ask you about this idea Davies had, about formations.”
“Harry,” Hermione says, glancing around, “I’ll take the cloak. It can go in one of my pockets.”
Ron groans and lets his head loll back on his shoulders, as if pleading the ceiling to either send help or come crashing down to kill him. Together, Harry and Hermione manage to shove him through the portrait hole, ignoring the Fat Lady’s rather hypocritical comments about the volume of their laughter.
Harry gave him a startled look and cleared his throat. “As well as I ever do, Professor.”
“Do you think he’ll listen to you?” Hermione asked, taking a bite of oatmeal.
“So what do you say?” Draco asked, his voice bright. “Are you in?”
She moved her wand to him and repeated the spell, and Draco was displeased to find himself upside down. It was decidedly not his best angle. His nose was to its nicest effect with the pointy side down.
Which meant he had to keep being…Draco ground his teeth so hard he could hear his jaw getting tense...
The heavy blankets were making him sweat even more, so he pulled them off and glared balefully at the cheerful hard-on in his pajama pants, which seemed blissfully unaware that it was triggering an existential crisis.
“I—” Dumbledore began, lifting a hand to Draco, and broke off. “I have always thought, and said many a time, that it is the confident man who can admit he is anxious, the brave man who can admit he is afraid.”
“Goyle?”
“IS THAT REALLY YOUR BIGGEST CONCERN RIGHT NOW?” Malfoy bellowed. “Is there some school rule in place that mandates Slytherins and Gryffindors to go around fucking each other willy-nilly? Ha...willy-nilly.”
Malfoy pouted. He really was a child.
Draco decided his best shot at getting out of this mess was to pretend as though none of this was his fault at all, which might be a bit difficult, because—and even he had to admit this—if one traced the logical cause and effect pattern back to its source, one would undoubtedly find one Troubled But Devastatingly Handsome Young Nobleman there. Through no fault of his own.
“Yeah. That’s if I don’t cock up summoning the one thing it relies on. Sirius was going to tell us something useful…”
Headboy: May his soul finally calm the hell down
“What is it, my lovely?” comes Filch’s mumbling. Harry pulls the cloak tighter around them. Filch shuffles and stomps the long walk down the corridor, swinging lantern making the walls swim and morph. Mrs Norris runs to circle his feet. He peers around suspiciously, standing outside the alcove for
The Great Hall, much to their surprise, is empty when they file in. Hermione points out the four extra seats that Filch is maneuvering into the place settings at the head table, two of which are soon filled by Madame Maxime and Headmaster Karkaroff. Their students, however, are nowhere in sight. Harry picks up Avennia and plops her on his shoulder.
Neville sighs good-naturedly. “Y-Yeah, very true...”
“You’re really close with Lavender,” Harry says suddenly, looking up and meeting her eyes warmly.
really!”
“It went very well, considering you’re still alive!” says Madam Pomfrey.
“Wait, isn’t Cho Chang going out with Cedric Diggory?” says one of the girls. Harry probably ought to find out their names.
Bill: she’s right
Harry feels as if his wand is more of an extension of himself than a tool at this point, but he isn’t going to say anything.
“Aha!” Dumbledore says suddenly. “Unless I am mistaken, the delegation from Beauxbatons is fast approaching!”
He deflates slightly. “Ah. Shit.”
“Harry, Cedric,” says another voice behind them.
“Harry,” Hermione hisses.
“I asked Cedric to help me charm the badge to stay hidden until the camera was about to go off. Fantastic, isn’t it?”
“I would be surprised.”
Headboy: This family is full of snitches
Bill: Merry Christmas all of you
“Cool flying earlier. Draco screamed when the dragon got free.”
“Nonsense!” Ron scoffs. “That was bloody mental! Whoever put your name in the Goblet is trying to do you in for sure!”
Hope you're all having fun! I am :)
Ronald: I think he has a saving people thing
“Luna Lovegood,” Draco sighs. “Ravenclaw, third year, a distant cousin on my father’s side. Most people call her Loony.”
Spinnings: old news
“Oh,” Harry says stupidly. He hears someone, possibly Hermione, shriek with laughter somewhere in the distance.
One fear: mum’s been trying
Greckles: our most celebrated skills,
“What the hell is that?” Dean asks. “Is it some kind of message?”
“Secret friends?” Harry grins.
Ronald: my god
She dabs the gashes with something purple that stings and even smokes, muttering all the while.
“Oh, not always,” Hermione smiles. It makes Harry very wary. “Sometimes he glares.”
Brilliantly, they almost stumble over their missing friend on their way in.
“I’m not the Hogwarts champion, Cedric is. Maybe now everyone will stop thinking I’m trying to steal his thunder.”
Harry knows Hermione had helped Hagrid with his hair again this morning, but he hadn’t known why. He’s managed to keep it neatly groomed all day, it seems, and has the restlessness of someone greatly excited. A large drying flower is tucked into his lapel.
Ronaldo: Oh?
“Most people say thank you.”
“Socks!” Dobby exclaims. “Thank you Harry Potter, socks is Dobby’s favourite clothes!” He pulls them on immediately, the purple working wonders with his bauble-toggled tea cosy hat. He pulls out a small package of brown paper and presents it to Harry.
Professor Moody hobbles swiftly into the courtyard before them, wand out and levelled straight at Malfoy. Malfoy shrieks and Harry turns, just in time to see him shrink instantaneously into the body of a long white ferret. A few gasps and quiet laughs echo around them. Harry is too transfixed by the sight of ferret-Malfoy skittering around in the grass to notice.
Harry collects the kneazles from Hermione’s makeshift playpen and places them in their soft little beds.
says the python.
He opens the portrait for Harry and feigns surprise when he finds Hermione on the other side.
Freckles: even when they locked you in your room summer before last
Cedric glances up at the people passing them and leans in.
“Smith? Really, Goldstein?” Draco scoffs. “Thought you could do better than that.”
She laughs. “Thank you. Now, I saw some of your team heading out to play Quidditch, so give me the cats and you can go join in.”
Ginny: yes bill
Snape frowns. “Mr Potter has an hour and a half left of my lesson, he will be with you when—”
Malfoy scowls. “I
He brushes past Harry and strides through the classroom door Snape’s just opened for them.
Malfoy runs his wand over the slightly-bent edges and they smooth instantly. “It’s fine.”
Harry spends half of History of Magic writing his letter to Sirius and the other half playing with kittens. He sneaks them out of the crate when Hermione isn’t paying attention and sits them on his desk, letting them sniff at his parchment and bat at his hovering quill. Rosanna meows loudly when she rolls off the table and into his lap. Binns, as expected, does not care in the least.
“Come on Malfoy, is that all you’ve got?” Harry adds.
“Is there anything more I can do?” Fred leans in, flicking through the notebook. He scratches Phobos behind the ears. “I have a few ideas, see…”
Harry flusters. “But if I do that he might just come charging in himself! I can’t let him do that!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Ron snaps.
Greckles: hmm too real too real
There was a fiasco with a cockatrice in 1792, but if you want to know more, then you can go and read it yourselves. Though, that book isn’t
Madame Maxime holds up her wand and a silvery ribbon flies from the end. It curls and twists in the air, forming a shimmering seven.
Ginny: in the background at least
“You have robes over here.” Cedric points to a set of Gryffindor red robes, suspiciously similar to his seeker’s ones. Harry hums.
“Yes, now can we please get out of here before someone finds us!” Harry tries to lift his arm to pull Malfoy away, but Malfoy’s hand is already holding his wrist like a vice. “Come
Derricking: Peregrine Derrick
“Yeah, yeah. Tower’s this way.”
“Still, looks like your badge survived.” Cedric nods to his shoulder and Harry looks down. Sure enough the badge remains, if a little discoloured, completely intact. The words aren’t even flickering.
“Of course she isn’t,” Hermione says, though looks unconvinced.
“Of course not,” she replies shortly.
“Ron, it’s okay,” Harry grins. “I’m not here to win. He can be horrible all he wants.”
Bill: More bad than you’ve let us know about I’m sure
“You know what I think?” Ron barrels on. “I think your father is cruel and horrid, and that you’re a right spoiled arse. You’re lucky I don’t always want to murder you anymore.” He grabs Harry’s shoulder and tugs him away. “Come on, we’re going.”
The horntail is free.
Ginny: well, at least it wasn’t anything worse
Ginny: not to mention heroism ;)
There’s an outcropping on the other side of the stadium that Harry knows the dragon can’t reach. He dives for it and gets a claw-graze to the back. He thanks whatever the hell will listen that it isn’t worse and tumbles to the ground behind his cover, broom in hand.
“Kneazles, Granger,” Malfoy interrupts, dumping the box on the bench beside her.
“Is tha’ you Harry?” Hagrid whispers when he opens it. The sound is loud, but not disturbingly so.
Ron frowns. “Bless you.”
“Dumblédorr,” she purrs, “I ’ope I find you well?”
A roaring round of applause shakes the walls. The students smile and turn to take their seats. Harry’s eyes follow those making their way over to the Slytherins, somehow surprised when the probable-veela sits herself right between Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson.
“The chains snapped,” Harry mutters, scrunching his nose and looking away. Pomfrey declares him fit with a scathing glare and instructions to stay put. She returns to Cedric’s back.
“Brilliant!” she replies, once she’s got her giggles under control.
“You’re mental,” Ron tells his brother. Fred pays him no attention, having leant down to talk quietly with Hermione, already leading her from the hall.
(See the end of the chapter for
You: Sure!
“Shall I try some?”
“Try casting.”
“He asked me to be discreet.”
“It should be, after I saved your life teaching you to summon.”
Greckles: sus
Harry doesn’t bother to point out that no one else knows he’s been helping, and, actually, are highly unlikely to doubt anything after one look at his grades.
he said they’re called, so why is
Harry leans as far forward on his broom as possible, heading for the rocks at a terrifying speed. “Molliare!” he yells, pointing his wand at the ground. He pulls up tight and slips off his broom, ducking into a roll on landing that almost turns his ankle. The horntail screams, and he’s on his feet before he catches his breath.
“Oh?”
Snake: You have to leave
You: I want him to suffer just as much as they did
“It’s true!” he shouts back down the stairs, and returns soon after with the cloak. They step out of the portrait, throwing it over their heads immediately. Ron hands Harry a small crate of Honeyduke’s poached from the stack and they giggle as they make their way down to the dungeons.
Harry sighs too. “I didn’t think of that.”
Krum stands and pats Cedric on the shoulder before he reclaims his seat. He hands his wand to Mr Ollivander and stands tall, hands braced at his back.
Higgs: wow
The main event, for now...
Harry swallows. “You too,” he says, and then is spun into the waiting arms of—
Harry, Ron, Neville, Ginny, and a confused Seamus and Dean clink goblets.
Harry applies himself to his scrambled eggs.
Headboy: It’s not like you were any better at school
She grins with sharp teeth.
“Who knows,” Harry agrees. He could throw in at least one idea.
Ronald: dunno?
“Brilliant,” Harry tells him, grinning even wider. “Do you have any spare?”
Harry realises that the other Slytherins are also wearing the badges and sneering at him. He grins and taps his own, thoroughly satisfied by the flashes of shock over their faces.
“Be nice,” the girl reprimands. Her voice is bright and confident. “May we ’ave this?” she asks Hermione, pointing to the Bouillabaisse. “It is one of my favourites.”
Leek: Oh?
Katie: IRE-LAND! IRE-LAND
god no. Even looking back now, he decides he has no idea how he ever survived his relatives’ bigotry. Why Uncle Vernon had ever let him out of the house when he was so clearly not one of them. How lucky he is to still be alive, despite being both queer
“He wants to talk to you?” Hermione asks worriedly. “I hope he isn’t going to try to get in, that’s a terrible idea!”
He barely remembers getting back to the dorm that night, but man do his feet feel it when he finally gets into bed. Not even thoughts of dancing and snogging and strong hands and painted lips can distract him from his exhaustion, and his consciousness ends up drifting quickly away to the sweet serenade of kitten purring and Ron’s snoring.
“At least keep your voices down,” Ginny snorts.
Freckles: oh no they’re friends
Bill: so you really weren’t joking when you told me Hagrid had a dragon and Ron asked you to save it
“Anyway, I thought it was Percy you said that about,” Hermione says.
“Lasso them,” is Ron’s only suggestion. He doesn’t take it.
“Positive,” Harry says.
“Harry!” The back of the tent bursts open again, and Hermione and Ron return. “That was so scary!”
“Mr Krum, please.”
She pokes him in the side. “Over there.”
He stalks off, back to the castle entrance, though the drama is sort of diminished by the fact that they’re all going the same way.
They make their way to the dungeons silently, ignoring the brushing of shoulders under the cloak. Harry stops in front of the bare stretch of wall hiding the Slytherin common room.
Spinnings: their
He runs his fingers delicately down the length of the wand and mutters a quick “Orchideous!”. A neat, flourishing bunch of peonies, irises and camelia bloom from the wand tip.
“Maybe it’s a code!” Colin gasps, but the others around him shrugs.
Mr Crouch, Ludo Bagman, Professor Karkaroff and Madam Maxime are all newly sat at the table. Rita Skeeter settles herself in a corner and retrieves both quill and parchment.
“It’s all right,” Fred says, “we all know you need a laugh, what with Ronnie acting like a git who’s crawled up his own arse and gotten stuck half the time.”
“Isn’t that a fifth year spell?” Harry asks. “Wait, nevermind. Get under here, it’ll be easier.”
The tile he’s holding onto slips and Harry goes with it, picking up speed even as he scrabbles to catch hold of something.
“You fixed?” Ron asks Cedric.
His feet hit the lip.
Greckles: it’s obviously not
“Who knows,” he replies, eyes wandering around and looking anywhere but at him. “So, has the great Gryffindor champion found a suitable partner?”
“Brilliant,” Ron says weakly. “Thank you.”
Norberta: Then that’s weird
Norberta: Spot on Harry
Greckles: that’s physically impossible
You: I’m not a good person Charlie
“For Merlin’s sake, Harry!” she cries. “Why haven’t you done something about your clothes yet?”
“Dance partners,” Harry repeats. “I have to dance.”
“Of course,” Draco sighs, picking up the dance flawlessly. “I knew she was up to something.”
“Well anyway, she was a bit annoying about it, but no more than everyone else who refuses to believe me.”
Nothing.
“Right,” says Bagman. He’s wearing his old Wasps robes again. “Well, time to fill you all in! I’ll offer each of you this bag—” he holds up a small purple pouch “—and you will pick a small model of the thing you are about to face! They have, err, different varieties, you see. It will also decide the order you go in.”
You: Funny story though, you were there
“Accio book!”
Ronaldo: >:(
to our humble Hogwarts School this evening. Please be sure make yourselves at home and enjoy your stay to the fullest. The tournament will be officially opened post-feast, so I say: dig in!”
“Is something wrong?” Ron asks.
Can he risk going back to the stadium with her?
Ronaldo: disgusting
“’As Karkaroff not arrived?” their headmistress is saying.
“Nott stole him!” Ginny says. “What is it with you lot and bloody Slytherins!”
“Maybe not
Greckles: is that a baby dragon
Freckles: I feel awful now
Freckles: how rude
“I just do.”
Seamus gives him a ridiculous look and turns hopefully to Dean.

Ron wrinkles his nose. “Who d’you two keep writing to, anyway?”
“You're a wizard, aren't you? Conjure some.”
The next time he takes back custody of his new fluffy friends is on Friday, the morning he sends off the letter to Sirius.
Ronald: No!
“You’ll be fighting the She-Weasley for her, I hear.”
“C’mon, we’re gonna practise tomorrow. Even have Charms in the morning.”
“What?”
Norberta: Where tf are you guys
“No one,” he replies, stroking Hedwig’s plumage carefully. “Thanks Hedwig.”
weren’t any help, you bloody chatterbox!”
Ronaldo: and you
“We brought this down from your room!” Seamus says, handing over the heavy, gleaming golden egg Harry’d won from the dragon. “You haven’t opened it yet, have you?”
With Cassiopeia now safely on his shoulder,
“Hermione Granger,” says Hermione.
“How many are coming?”
“I’m sorry, ’Mione,” he says, hugging her, “I didn’t mean for it to get loose.”
“Don’t worry Potter, we have tissues!” someone shouts. He forces himself to swallow the last of his beans.
Harry frowns and follows him out.
Everyone pulls out their wand.
Harry leans in. “You aren’t too badly hurt are you?”
Greckles: ugh I will be
“What?!” Harry squeaks.
“How do you know about that?” Harry frowns.
The room extends at least ten more feet sideways in both directions, leaving the flimsy-looking window into the lake wisely undisturbed. Hermione and Ron in front of him are gazing around at the decorations, the green and silver and blue draped around the ceiling, chandeliers, tapestries and tables. Hundreds of people are already milling about chattering and laughing and throwing themselves and each other around to the very loud music. Harry can see Cho on his left laughing with Susan Bones, a group of Hufflepuff girls chatting to (up) a number of Durmstrang students on his right, and Blaise Zabini (in more head-to-toe black) heading straight for them.
“Ah, so that’s who he is. He’s fit.”
“You’re not allowed to die today,” he mutters with something that sounds like firm determination. Harry grips the back of Ron’s shirt even though his fingers feel icy and numb. Neville opens the window and props Harry’s Firebolt on the sill, ready to be summoned. A gust of air buffets them out of the door, so they head down to breakfast. It feels more like a funeral procession.
Snake: Ugh just hurry up or you’ll miss the cup, morons
“No,” he replies, tucking his own wand away in his pocket.
Slowly, it drifts into the shallows, and at a hundred feet from shore they hear the splash of the anchor. A distant figure appears where Harry presumes the gangway should be. Even from so far away, they very clearly raise their arm, and a long, proud, wooden walkway lifts from the lakebed. It meets the ship and slopes gently down to land.
He practices for another few minutes, picking up a shaky volley between himself and Ron with a spare quill.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Shit,” Harry breathes, dragging Malfoy back out into the cold.
“Don’t want to know,” Ron replies. He pokes some bread through Leonard’s cage.
Nott nods again and wanders off, his hands shoved deeply into his pockets. Harry sighs and finds a sofa to sit down and eat his chocolate frog, snagging a butterbeer while he’s at it. Davies taps him on the shoulder and compliments his flying, so he throws himself deep into a conversation about Quidditch plays. Ginny joins them some minutes later, tripping over the sofa leg and falling straight into Harry’s lap.
“Yeah, we know. You’ve been kind of, uh, staring.”
“Mum reads her stuff sometimes,” Ron muses through a mouthful of chicken. He pokes a little bit towards Charlie in her new niffler-proof cage. “All sounds like nonsense to me.”
“Hermione,” George says, cutting her short, “have you ever been down to the kitchens?”
Harry, pulled farther and farther into the crowd, grins around at all of them and holds the egg aloft. “Who wants me to open it?” he yells. The response is deafening, but he keeps them hanging on anyway. “Huh? Shall I do it? Are you sure?” Neville throws a cushion at him and he laughs, finally twisting the catch and letting the thing fall open in his hands.
Nearly a week later, Harry climbs through the portrait with Hermione, wondering where the hell Ron has gotten to. It isn’t like him to miss dinner at all, and they’d been there for over half an hour. Hermione had been bored enough without their bickering to turn on Harry and ask
Cedric is grinning, quite visibly trying not to laugh. Harry’s chest goes tight and suddenly his neck is too hot, almost sweating.
“Oh, nothing.”
It turns out that Ron is more than right—a full three days after the letter the best plans they have to clear the common room are to either announce dorm room parties, enlist the help of too-nosy-for-their-own-good Fred and George, or to drop a bag of stinkbombs. Harry hopes it won’t come to the stinkbombs. Filch would skin them.
“I really don’t dance.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Harry allows. “Good flying. Now let’s go before we’re late!”
Harry grins back. “Have you seen—oh! Malfoy!” he shouts. “Over here.”
Before Harry can work up a proper irritation, the door swings open with a loud knock. Colin Creevey sidles in, grinning at him.
“Dragons,” Malfoy breathes, “the first task is
Fleur rises gracefully and meets him in the centre of the open room. She presents her wand and he takes it reverently.
The champions are ushered over to either side of the doors to greet the parade of their peers. Harry and Parvati take the same side as Fleur and Roger Davies, who looks utterly floored by his luck and can hardly take his eyes off his partner. Harry returns Fleur’s pleased smile and looks across to the others, and at the girl in the pale blue. He hears Parvati gasp beside him.
“Well, that was a mistake.”
Saturday 21:23
Her friends giggle and hide their mouths behind their hands. Lavender whispers loudly to a girl with very blonde hair.
“I’ll have you know that Granger is much too good for a scrawny git like him.” Harry looks to where Hermione came from and sees Fred leaning against a support pole, Ron at his elbow. Fred’s tone may light, but his glare is anything but. They both place a hand on one of Hermione’s shoulders, flanking her and menacing at Skeeter. “You’d better not be spreading more of your half-baked vitriol.”
“Have you had any more thoughts on how to enter the Tournament?” Harry asks.
It’s well into December now, and Thursday's Transfiguration lesson has been over for at least five minutes. Harry looks up, wide-eyed at Professor McGonagall, shoving the rubber haddock his Weasley fake wand had turned into under the desk. Ron does the same with his tin parrot, both pretending they weren’t just having a sword fight with them in the back of her class.
And really, Ron’s anger on his behalf is worth more than all the tens in the world. Harry pulls him back into the tent, smiling from ear to ear.
Diggory! Thank you!”
“Shame.” Malfoy takes a drink from his own goblet. Each of their silences seem to be getting more awkward, as if that were possible. “Are you leaving the cats in your dorm yet? I think they’re old enough. Granger said something about it.”
“Oh stop it, you two,” Hermione tuts. “Anyway, I wanted to say thank you again for your help with the Society.”
Thank you for your patience my friends!
“Right, well, I’m going back to the dungeons,” Malfoy announces. Harry immediately leans over to pick the unfinished food from his plate. “There’s much too much red and gold and camaraderie over here.”
“Any idea how they’re going to assign them to you?” she asks. Harry shrugs.
“Enjoy life as a ferret, Malfoy?” Seamus asks loudly. Most of the Gryffindors laugh. “Can’t have been much of a change!”
Harry and Cedric dash back to the classroom, unwilling to be in Rita Skeeter’s presence much longer.
“Potter!” someone else calls. Harry sighs and looks towards the castle. Malfoy is gazing up at them with studied indifference, about fifteen feet away. Next to him stands very annoyed Slytherin Chaser Cassius Warrington, and they also have their brooms. There must be something in the air.
“That’s traitorous, that is!”
“Harry would really appreciate it, he needs all the help he can get,” Hermione says. Harry raises his eyebrows at her. She wrinkles her nose. “No offence.”
Draco snorts. “It is, isn’t it. What’s the betting Weasley chickens out of snogging Blaise?”
Ron looks between Blaise’s proffered arm and his face and swallows again. He nods, and very cautiously tucks his hand into Blaise’s elbow. Harry can’t help the ridiculous grin that forces its way through. It probably makes him look like a lunatic, but Parvati is too busy giggling at Ron to notice. Blaise looks very pleased with himself, and Harry gets the impression that Ron is in good hands.
“I—I’m afraid he’ll need his—”
“Very
Harry goes to bed shaky and clammy and wakes much the same. Ron throws his socks at his head (Harry realises he’s been trying to pull his hat onto his left foot) and pulls him into a tight hug.
“What do you think these gardens are for?”
“Come on, let’s go. He’s not going to miss us,” he hisses..
“Professor Dumbledore,” Cedric greets.
“Ron,” Harry says.
“Antidotes!” Snape announces. “You should all have found your recipes by now. You shall brew them in this lesson and then I shall be selecting someone on whom to test them.”
“Oh, well. Friends always come first though, right?”
“’Agrid? It is time?”
“I think I’ve found out what happened to that Spew badge you lost, ’Mione.”
“You’re going to have to fight a dragon, Potter, shouldn’t you be more concerned?”
“Has he told you who he’s going with yet?” she asks.
A few dozen older teenagers now stand, shivering, in her shadow. They all wear the same thin, silken blue robes, and Harry notices that they have a much higher proportion of students wearing headscarves than Hogwarts does. They stare at the castle, some impressed and others apprehensive.
“They’re having fun,” Parvati snickers. Harry smiles.
Ronaldo: :)
A man with a large, slightly-smoking camera is skulking off to the side, watching Fleur and trying to pretend he isn’t.
Saturday 05:41
I got so caught up last night in the euphoria of watching Clone Wars season 1 that I completely forgot it was Sunday, rip.
Greckles: his stuff was locked in a cupboard under the stairs
Norberta: And when they do he’ll get what he deserves
was offering to help me learn how not to die in the Tournament,” Harry whispers.
A smile cracks across Viktor’s face and Fleur laughs.
“Potter, a word!” the Professor says over the din, and Harry traipses up towards her, headless haddock still clutched in his hand. She frowns at it for a split second, as if confused by its state, before levelling him with a placid gaze. “Potter, the champions and their partners—”
Spinnings: Harry…
Everywhere he goes there will be whispers. He’s resigned to it, but it takes a few moments to remember why his chest feels so heavy when he wakes the next morning. It’ll be whispers or applause from his housemates. Both as bad as each other.
You: :(
“Piss off.”
With a pretty swish of her wand, she conjures several gallons of water and threads them over the middle of the duel. Malfoy waves his hands about, guiding it with her help.
Harry flinches and releases Draco’s hand hurriedly. His sweaty palm burns with the remnants of sensation.
Fred and George conveniently reappear when most of Gryffindor, the champions, and their friends are all stumbling out into the snow. Shrieks of laughter echo off the stonework and out onto the fields of icy white, rising in pitch and volume as the first brave souls scoop up handfuls of the stuff and lob them at everyone else. Hermione, wisely, climbs a nearby tree in an attempt at escape, though several snowballs stray close by. Ron spots Draco standing below her dangling feet and winks at Harry, sneaking off quietly on his own. Seconds later there’s a scream and a shriek of laughter, and Hermione almost falls off her branch. Draco swats at Ron, who is positively howling, and has drawn his shoulders right to his ears where a large clump of snow has been shoved down the back of his cloak.
“Ah yes, my apologies.”
“There isn’t much there in the first place,” he mutters.
“Who was your date tonight?” Harry blurts. “She didn’t tell me her name.”
“Come on, Malfoy, you’d better win us this!” Ron shouts.
Malfoy snorts. “Maybe he’s afraid of it.”
over my dead mum, and I’m clearly off to do a bit more, so would you—oh. Cho.”
Headboy: That’s wholly understandable
badge is clearly visible.
Ron’s mouth snaps shut, the view down his gullet going with it.
“You wouldn’t believe me if I told you. Good night, I’ll see you tomorrow.” Harry swishes the cloak over Malfoy’s head. He appears in the corridor, disgruntled and blinking and with flyaway hair. Harry turns and makes sure to scuff his feet as he walks away.
“Thank you Professor!” Harry says, overwhelmed by such overt praise from her.
After a moment, Harry set the box and photo aside carefully, and begins ripping into the rest of the paper packages. Hermione gets him the newest quidditch dissect and Ron a large bag of dungbombs, and Hagrid has sent the biggest box of sweets Harry’s ever seen. It includes all of his favourites and few he hasn’t even heard of, and so he makes a note to give him an extra big hug when he sees him at lunch.
Cedric pulling Harry aside, behind the suit of armour, and the way it had sent his heart to his throat. Ginny falling into his lap and the heat that had set off inexplicable shivers. Ron’s arm resting gently around his waist. Hermione staring up at him in her attractive party clothes. Draco’s hand brushing his beneath the cloak.
They can see the champions’ tent from the top of the hill. Harry swallows harshly and chokes.
“You know, he asked about you two a few times when we went to Egypt, but I didn’t really think much of it,” he says conspiratorially.
“As if!” he replies, frowning at Ginny and trying to copy whatever she’s doing. He succeeds in little else other than make her laugh harder, but that’s okay with him. “Where’s Nev?”
“Well, you’d better get your act together soon,” Hermione says. “Less than three weeks to go!”
“Dra-gon boy! Dra-gon boy!” chants Lee.
Madame Maxime waves her hand behind her. “My students.”
A younger Remus Lupin sits with both Lily and James Potter in what he supposes is their house in Godrick’s Hollow. They’re laughing, happy, and looking from each other to the camera with heartwarming tenderness.
“Angelina,” Fred says, not embarrassed in the slightest. Harry flicks his eyes to Hermione, who is most certainly not reading any of the page she’s on.
Bill: …
Hagrid beams. “I got summat to show yer.”
“Hey, Hermione!” He grins at her, shadowed by Krum. “How are you?”
“You too. You’ll all do brilliantly. I hope you won’t take it personally that I’m cheering for Cedric.”
Harry bites his lip. “To cast the spell I need to have a clear idea of what I’m looking for; I need to think of the appearance, purpose or sentimental value. The wand movement needs to be a sharp flick backwards, as if casting a fishing line…”
“Nothing, Professor,” Pansy chirps. “Just that Draco didn’t really enjoy his little probation as a polecat.”
“No idea,” Dean says.
“Hey!” he shouts down. His voice echoes down the valley.
Regardless, Harry, Ron and Hermione are very much not looking forward to their next class. Wandering around trying to avoid as many of their year as possible, they make their way through the clocktower courtyard. It’s Malfoy’s day with the cats, and Harry’s wondering if they shouldn’t start taking a few each and sharing the load every day.
“I didn’t know you were competing, Mr Bagman,” she snipes, but slips her hand in anyway. She draws out a moving figurine about the size of Harry’s little finger: the Welsh green. Around its neck is tied a seared wooden tag with the number two. She inhales deeply and stares down at it with determination.
Harry sits up suddenly, struck. “I have an idea!” he says.
“They’re great,” Harry grins. “Malfoy gave me one, I asked him this afternoon. Anyway, you’re good at nonverbal magic, aren’t you? I heard some girls talking about it.”
“I’m fourteen,” Harry says, “and there hasn’t been any sun for over a month, I’m just not white.”
The house tables have gone out the window, as always, and people are rushing about shrieking and chattering like never before. There are possibly a thousand turkeys and plates of roast potatoes, entire cooked hams and mountains of vegetables and actual boatfuls of gravy. Harry, looking for any remaining spaces to sit, spies Cho, Cedric, Krum and Fleur all in one and beelines for them, only to realise too late that with them comes—
God, he thinks, how far away he is from the dull and painful life he had at Privet Drive, where the people are as nosy as they are incredibly judgemental.
think is dying first?” to raise their eyebrows at her. Harry had become used to their cajoling in the common rooms and corridors, laughing it off with a wave of his hand, but today it’s a little on-the-nose.
“Yes, well. I’ve been made aware that we need to start smaller, to angle for appropriate pay, paid holiday, and the like.”
The crowd screams.
Harry realises that there is, actually, a very odd and eerie noise drifting towards them. Hermione gasps quietly in recognition, and a rumbling starts up through the ground. Everyone returns to looking around eagerly as they had been before when—
Harry throws the cloak over the crates and levitates them above their heads.
It seems that Draco doesn’t quite have a response for that. Instead he swipes a fresh glass from the nearest table and gulps from it, seemingly unaware of the droplet making its way down the column of his throat that Harry just can’t tear his eyes away from.
Headboy: Harry I’m so sorry
The first recognisable couple that spins past are Cedric and Cho. Harry wants to smile at them, maybe say hi, but they really do only have eyes for each other. Next are Dean and Seamus, who had been making fun of him from the sidelines only seconds ago. He considers sticking out a leg to trip them, but he’d probably trip himself and Parvati too in the process.
Malfoy snorts. “I didn’t know you could speak French, anyway.”
Cassandra: we all know you’re a fucking twink shut up
Harry runs a hand through his hair, dislodging a small cloud of the stuff and making them all jump back. “Courtesy of the Weasleys.”
One: RON WANTS TO SHAG KRUM
“I think your decorations are gorgeous,” Fleur says, driving them away from the more dangerous (dangerous for Harry’s heart more than anything else) territories. Harry lets their chatting wash over him, mostly, happy to sit out and panic uselessly in his own mind.
“Fine!” Malfoy sighs, throwing his hands up dramatically. “Meet me in the library after dinner and I’ll
“Take a picture, Potter,” he says next. Harry blinks and draws his gaze back up to his face.
Greckles: tragic.
“Photos, Dumbledore! Photos!”
Harry can feel Malfoy’s breath tumbling over the backs of his fingers. Harry’s other hand has found itself holding his side to steady them both, just beneath the curve of his ribs. He feels a flicker of something warm as Malfoy—the absolute
“…I never took you as one to talk about crushes, Harry,” she says eventually.
Hermione sighs. “That’s what I’m worried about. You’re
Ron jumps, emerging from behind his hands. “Yeah—uh, yes, they are.”
The door swings inwards and Madame Maxime steps out. She is wrapped in a thick fluffy shawl and is just as glittery as usual.
“The snakes, I need your help sending them back. They’ve disappeared, though.”
“Mr Diggory!” cries Rita Skeeter. “Whatever is the occasion?”
“We can’t go down all at once,” Parvati says loudly over the din, “we’ll have to go in groups and take different routes!”
Parvati holds out her wand and draws a circle over the floor between them. Ron’s robes begin to shift, and both Harry and Ron look on in wonder. The offensive frilly lengths that Ron had bemoaned remove themselves entirely. As Parvati circles her wand the bodice reshapes itself to sit more flatteringly on Ron’s body. It pulls in at the waist and pleats at the cinch she creates at the back, creating what looks like a smartly flaring knee-length tailcoat. She turns the material a deep burgundy, and whatever old fashioned pattern it had been in seems to iron itself out before their eyes.
“Is that a student?”
reliable; it’s more like a, a—A
Harry taps his wand against his palm. The robes are quite atrocious, really, but there’s nothing Harry knows how to do that could fix them. “None of us have anything else…”
“All right, all right,” Malfoy tuts, strutting over in tight grey jeans and a black shirt. Harry is horrified to realise how appealing it is on him. “Disappointed you could make it, Potter. Didn’t get caught, I presume?”
“Absolutely.”
“This one, for a start,” both he and George chime, pointing to each other.
Ron catches Harry’s abrupt tickle-in-the-chest, letting out a cough that sounded awfully like
“Come now, it’s all right. There’s no need to be afraid of getting into trouble. We all know you shouldn’t have entered, but our readers do love a rebel.” She winks. Harry tries not to wince.
“Brilliant!” Ron says.
“Oh, here…”
“Come on,” he murmurs, “we’re going to be late for Potions.”
Yes. “Not really.”
Snake: Wow sorry
told mcg she thinks Sirius Black sent Harry’s broom so now they’ve taken it to strip it
“Oh Merlin,” Ron is saying, Ginny sat on the sofa beside him and rubbing his shoulder.
God knows how next year’s House Cup is going to go.
Bell: or anyone!!
He scoffs. “At least one of you has some brains.”
Harry eats what feels like enough for two and then some, and then the desserts turn up. Ron tries to attract Fleur over by placing pretty sweets in her line of sight, but she appears to be quite content with the multitude of desserts she has at the Slytherin table.
“He’ll help,” Pansy whispers. “I don’t know what it is, but he’ll do it.”
Harry cringes, feeling his chest go horribly tight. He doesn’t want to look at Ron.
“I’d gathered as much.”
“That’s a good thing, Ron.”
“Well, I thought so, but—”
One fear: sus
says the voice of Harry’s unwelcome realisation.
“Hey, Potter!” calls the devil himself, unmistakably smug. He’s lounging in the crook of the large tree in the corner with Parkinson, Goyle and Nott sitting in the grass nearby. Zabini, Millicent Bullstrode and Daphne Greengrass are perched on the rim of one of the walkway arches behind.
A volley of stunning spells soars over the stadium and sparks against the horntail’s scales. She wails and staggers over to her nest before collapsing, great wings shielding it from prying eyes.
“How romantic,” Charlie mutters. He shakes his head.
Freckles: ?
Bill: no
Ginny: and
“Cedric!” he exhales. Cedric grins and a couple of his friends snicker. “Actually, I really need to talk to you. Go on without me, Gin.”
You: Look it’s fine
“Sorry,” Harry wheezes. “I’m fine. I’ll see you later, okay?”
doing here?” she demands, and Rita Skeeter smirks. The photographer shuffles away.
“Have you learnt anything from that?”
Greckles: ew you
“Hey!” he protests. “What is it with people fixing my clothes?”
Harry makes a face and hopes it conveys his distress. By Cedric’s furrowing brow, it possibly just makes him look like he’s having a stroke.
“I need to ask him something. Do you mind?”
Bowl: FUCK ME
“Have not!”
worried about Harry, and you’ve been really good…”
“Sorry,” he mumbles, abashed.
“Cheers Malfoy, I’ll take them,” Harry says, still grinning. Malfoy rolls his eyes. He drops a cloth on Harry’s head.
With an odd, panic-compelled timing, Malfoy’s snide words from a measly two evenings ago rattle their way into his head.
“Hm?”
Just then, a group of Slytherins come up the stairs from their common room. Draco is in the lead, with black velvet robes that Harry thinks make him look like a vicar. Even so, a very attractive one. On his arm is the blonde girl Harry had seen with Neville at the inter-school party. She has hair as pale as Draco’s and has swapped her orange and green dress for lovely, glittery blue robes. Pansy Parkinson is wearing something floaty and green (no surprises), and is quickly approached by one of their Beauxbatons friends, who’s wearing a hijab in the same green and a set of lovely silver robes. Crabbe and Goyle look like a couple of glowering, mossy boulders, but Nott and Zabini are chatting amicably as they stroll through the throng. Zabini, in his grey velvet, comes to a stop in front of Harry, Ron and Parvati.
“That sounds good,” Harry tries.
“Flattery won’t work on me Harry!” she calls after him.
Harry circles above, ducking her fire and rolling out of reach and trying his best to make a nuisance of himself.
“It’s an old castle, this,” Filch croons and finally,
“Oh, sure.”
She closes the overlarge door behind her and takes his offered arm. Harry frowns, sharing a baffled glance with Malfoy, and they set off jogging after them. Hagrid can’t have wanted to show him Madame Maxime, that’s ridiculous, but their stroll doesn’t seem to be taking them much of anywhere and it is rather cold. He doesn’t particularly want to listen to their small talk, either.
“Do you think that the trauma of your past may have made you more keen to prove yourself? To enter the Triwizard Tournament—”
Greckles: Oliver’s gonna do his nut
Malfoy makes a face. “Do we have to?”
The much awaited match!
Harry grins and unwraps the paper, pulling out two starkly mismatched woolen (surprise, surprise) socks. One is his house red and patterned with broomsticks, while the other is a deep green and covered ankle to toe in little golden snitches.
“If you can get me there in one piece!” Dean replies.
he shouts.
“I really don’t know why I expected any less,” Ron laughs. “Well done mate.”
McGonagall appears beside him. “Mr Potter,” she says. “The Champions will be meeting in a tent on the other side of the stadium. I advise that you make your way there after your friends are done wishing you luck.” Her expression is pinched and her jaw is tenser than he’s ever seen it. He thinks he knows how she feels.
mention that we are all reaping the benefits of a hundred slaves!”
Greckles: no
“What are you, a dog?!” Harry hisses. He grimaces and wipes his hand on his jeans.
being weird—you’re wearing the badge he made!”
“Fred and George are arguing again,” Ron sighs. Harry looks where Seamus is to see an intense debate going on across the table. Lee, Angelina, and several others seem to be throwing in their two pence periodically. Angelina looks more irritated than anything else.
Malfoy sniffs, but settles himself on Harry’s other side. Hermione glares across the table at him.
“C’mon, he deserves a bit of a break,” Ron says, just as the card tower blows up and singes his eyebrows.
Freckles: I want one
Just then, barely twenty feet behind the treeline, they hear shouts from people up ahead. A deafening roar follows, making them both wince and cringe away.
“Weasley, these are what your mother sent you, aren’t they?” she asks.
Fleur and Viktor are quickly surrounded by their schools, and Harry and Ron watch on in glee.
“Oh, piss off.”
Saturday 05:35
“Thanks Hagrid!” he says before Hagrid gives himself away. He gets a hug from both of them.
“Goodness, what courage! Did you
“That’s a lovely idea, Harry,” Hermione says, appearing in a whirl at their shoulder. Her hair bounces on her shoulders and glints in the lamplight, otherwise contained in a bun at the back of her head. She’s wearing a sleeveless turtlenecked jumper, forest green and sort of ribbed, over unexpected cuffed jeans and with a large shirt tied around her waist. Harry doesn’t think he’s seen her wear any of it before, but is beginning to question his observational skills anyway.
Ronald: look what Harry just got
see the tournament through, and I must reiterate the weight of the choice you are making: these games are not for the faint-hearted. I beg of you, make sure you are prepared to perform to what is asked of you before you enter.”
Harry makes a face at him. “How many snake summoning spells do you know?”
Freckles: and even if they
Ginny: ooh I love secrets
After a long moment, longer than the others, he conjures a fountain of wine and pronounces the wand fine.
“Good enough for me.”
“Master of the Reptiles!”
jeans and jumper three sizes too small.
“Brilliant!” she says. “Have you seen Ron? I can’t believe it!”
“Hey!” Neville protests from a nearby armchair. Harry raises an eyebrow, and he goes a bit pink.
Mr Ollivander sends a few smoke rings across the room and proclaims Cedric’s wand fit for use.
“All right there Granger?” Fred yells.
Bowl: Lucian Bole
“Oh, crap, really?” he asks. His heart flips uncomfortably yet again.
“They even pretend they still ’ate each other.”
“Who are you going to ask?” Ron prods, malevolent grin plastered on.
Ronald: there were bars on his window
“Yeah,” Harry says, wondering if he still knows any words with more than one syllable. “I don’t know. Have you been having fun?”
“Stop being a wuss and fight back!” Pansy yells.
“Got a crush then,
Just then, her reply, if she’d had one, was drowned out by the flutter and flapping of hundreds of pairs of wings. Harry grabs the letter Hedwig drops before it can land in his beans. He hands her some bacon and hastily opens the letter one-handed.
you for crying out loud
“I would have said yes, promise,” Ginny snickers, “even if it’s because going with you is better than not being able to go.”
“Nothing of the sort,” Angelina replies lightly. She smiles and takes his arm, and he winks to Harry, Ron and Parvati as they make their glamorous exit.
he become Draco?—because then he feels himself surrendering to that hot flush again, and now is really
Harry snorts and shakes his head before holding out his hand. “Friends?” he asks.
Harry, Ron and Hermione spy Fred and George at the end of the Gryffindor table and slide in to join them. Again, unusually, they are sitting apart from everyone and huddled over a messy piece of parchment.
“Potter!” comes an unexpected shout uncomfortably close to his ear.
Harry keeps his head up and slides deftly onto the bench beside their favourite ferret. “Hello everyone!” he says. “Merry Christmas!”
“What?” Hermione says. “But we’ve been learning them for weeks!”
“It’s a mast!” Harry says to the others.
“Oh, that’s odd,” Hermione murmurs.
The others make noises of appreciation. He pushes some money into the hands of Dean and Seamus.  “We’ll open the statue when you get back, just make sure you don’t get caught!”
“Because they’re uneducated and brainwashed!”
Ginny: oi
it reads in beautiful cursive.
The stadium is large, easily half a Quidditch pitch. The noise from the crowd surges again, and he neither knows nor cares what they’re saying.
You: He was my dad’s best friend
It even makes being tugged around for the next half-hour worth it.
“Gonna be honest, didn’t really see that one coming.”
“Fred did?” Harry asks. Ron nods.
Harry takes several huge breaths of air, letting the cold sting his lungs. He holds out his wand and yells into the din.
Malfoy scoffs. “I’m surprised you haven’t been caught a million times over you
Harry stumbles and adopts his most earnest innocent bystander expression. Behind him he can hear Malfoy muttering, but he’s more concerned about Ron’s death grip on his arm.
The green dragon snaps its head around and roars. Harry is torn between covering his ears and taking hold of Malfoy’s shoulder to hold himself up. Malfoy himself is tense, poised on the edge as if ready to bolt. Harry takes hold of his upper arm anyway, both to prevent him running and to keep himself standing, and Malfoy takes a deep, shaky breath.
“Right.”
“Well done Harry, you did it! An’ Charlie said that horntail was the worst—”
Harry sprints back up to the dorms to collect the map and some money. He leads Dean, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Seamus to the statue of the humpback witch. He checks the map for approaching witnesses and taps the statue with his wand.
You: Conversation starter
Hermione looks over from scribbling distractedly in her notebook. “As long as you leave them with water and something to do.”
say python and anaconda.
He whoops, braking hard. Harry pulls up just short of overtaking him, turning to look. The scowl drops from his face as he takes in Malfoy’s look of glee, his windblown hair turned golden in afternoon light, and the glinting wings struggling to free themselves from his fist.
Her hair bounces in a set of elaborate and impressively-tight curls, and she has jewelled spectacles perched on her nose. Fingers with long crimson nails grip a crocodile-skin clutch.
“I assure you we are not offending anyone as we are, my
Harry sighs.
The protrusion is indeed a mast, followed in short order by the prow and deck of a beautiful wooden ship, the likes of which Harry has only ever seen in stories such as
The horntail crouches in the centre of the pit. Her wings are half furled around her and her nest in which the golden egg gleams. Her eyes narrow at the sight of him, menacing.
“You’re always hungry,” Hermione sniffs. She sends a red spark into the air, and very far away, Neville sticks his hand out of the window and probably gives them a thumbs-up.
“Potter! Weasley!
Flint: Bloody Merlin
Fred and George thump him on the back, grinning and clutching their bookies’ trays, but it doesn’t help. Not even when Ginny tells them off for jeering and hugs him too.
“No, no,” Harry says quietly. “We can’t send anyone that people will recognise easily. We could send Dean, I suppose. He’s quite tall, looks older than us.”
Harry watches the oversized snakes explore the tent. “I summoned it. She wouldn’t let me get close though, so I asked some friends to help while I ran distraction. She ended up chasing me around the castle.”
“We thought we’d throw you your own party!” Katie giggles, sitting precariously on Lee’s shoulders. As soon as the portrait swings shut, complaining loudly all the way, several explosive booms fill the room. Fred and George are standing in the middle throwing Filibuster's Fireworks around the place, whooping and yelling and a catastrophe in the making.
“Blimey, Harry,” he mutters as they reach an empty corridor on the way to the Gryffindor Tower, “I think she’s trying to say she thinks I’m
She grins. “Not yet. How can I help you boys?”
“You did that on purpose, didn’t you?” Ginny says. “Distracting them, I mean.”
Bill: Your compassion and empathy is truly commendable Harry
“One of these!” Harry says, showing him the parchment. He taps the green star and presses it to his own cheekbone before taking another. Ron takes the parchment, picking up a star and pressing it to Hermione’s nose.
Malfoy waits a beat. “Summon it again.”
Freckles: well we’re not gonna see him for the rest of the day
“Did you see Draco panicking yesterday when Viktor sat with us?” Feur asks the table at large. “It was very amusing, I think you would ’ave enjoyed it a lot.”
Thank you so much for reading!!
He shrugs again. “Can’t go around a complete idiot forever.”
Ginny: rip
“We’ll see what we can do,” she replies with playful menace.
“It’s a litter of kneazle kittens!” she grins, holding the box up for him to see. “They’re our Creatures project from Hagrid. Would you like to say hello? My books say two months is the most important time for them to be socialised.”

She waves her hand about vaguely. “We ended up busier than expected, I got distracted, and Draco refused to join me most of the time. What is the news with you?”
team!” George cries, hovering over near his sister.
It seems entirely too long before Professor McGonagall steps out onto the floor on the arm of Professor Dumbledore, and all of the teachers begin to follow suit. Parvati steers him around the new additions to the dancefloor, a number that grows on every beat as their friends and schoolmates decide to face the music.
“Now now, Viktor!” Igor Karkaroff says, cutting across a genuinely interesting description of life at Durmstrang.
“You all right?” Harry asks under his breath.
Snake: All of you need to leave the camp grounds, immediately.
“Your task is to collect the
With that she tugs Harry unceremoniously through the door and out into the corridor.
Harry has spent every single one of those days running around the castle trying not to die of embarrassment or deck anyone who makes noises about Rita Skeeter’s comments on Hermione. He’s had to hold Ron back once, and Neville has had to tackle them both on multiple occasions.
“What do you want?” Harry asks, trudging over. Closer, he notices the large badges they have pinned to their robes. For a wild moment he thinks they’re S.P.E.W badges, but then he sees the glowing golden words.
Bill: William Weasley
The canon goes a third time, and Harry is alone.
The door flies open, buffeting them with air. Cedric stands in a halo of light, bright white light, like Harry’s guardian angel sent from… Uh… Hufflepuff.
“This is brilliant, isn’t it Harry!” Colin says as soon as the door closes behind them. “Just brilliant, you being champion!”
In the common room, Hermione looks at them pointedly from a sofa in front of the fire. She waits for Harry and Ron to shrug on their robes and hurry back down, shoves the crate into Harry’s arms and trots straight out of the portrait hole.
There’s a bang, and several twittering little birds shoot out of the end of the wand and flutter outside through the open window.
Norberta: Really?
I really need to write more chapters but I keep getting distracted by all my star wars ideas :( I shall do my best!
“What are you on about?” Ron asks.
Fred smiles. “Sure.”
“And this means…?”
Fleur is right, of course. The staff this year have really outdone themselves, with freshly polished, singing suits of armour, endless strings of real holly and fir and dozens upon dozens of towering conifers, all covered in snow. There are live faeries and little golden owls all over, and everything glitters with frost and house-coloured ornaments. Even the charmed bloody mistletoe is back, though Harry suspects it’s Fred and George again rather than a new Christmas staple. He’s already narrowly missed being caught with Neville twice this morning.
Back at the tower, Harry meets Ginny as she’s climbing out of the portrait. She grins and waves him over, and he happily turns around to walk her to Charms, hoping that he’ll meet Cedric on the way. For all he likes Ron’s family, he realises he barely knows Ginny outside of their passing conversations at mealtimes, and he thinks he really ought to start being a better friend.
“Let’s go, then.”
“Did you make these?” he asks, stepping closer to Malfoy to see.
Greckles: oh you haven’t had to watch him ““flirt”” yet
Take your things and leave! Stop
Malfoy raises an eyebrow, finally falling into step and releasing Harry’s wrist as if his hand was never there. “Not so as you’d notice. And why would
“Says you,” Harry snorts.
“Shh!” he whispers, and knocks thrice below the gilded crest.
Fearful of what he might find, Harry turns his mind to find similarities. Their bizarre argument in the courtyard the other day: Draco, smug, lounging around in a tree as if it were a perfectly standard thing for him to be doing. Draco, leaping down and giving Harry another one of those inexplicable once-overs, still with the flash of challenge in an eyebrow. The way he squares up to Harry with that grin, revelling in how he gets under Harry’s skin, only to be completely wrong-footed when he’s complimented instead.
“Harry!” Hermione calls, some time later. Their Quidditch talk has attracted Angelina, Fred, Katie and several others, so as well as Ginny having made herself comfortable partly on Harry’s lap and Malfoy sitting on the back of the sofa, swinging his legs, they have a small gathering on the floor at their feet.
“Let me know when you have any witnesses or evidence to back up your claims,” McGonagall said. “Is there anything else I can do for you, Potter?”
“Draco—” Nott started, but Harry was out of the room before he caught the rest of it. This was a load of disingenuous bullshit, and he wasn’t going to listen to any more of it.
He waved a hand and the door behind them opened. As they stood to leave, Dumbledore’s face shifted somehow. Draco thought he’d never looked older.
“Oh, no, Draco,” Lovegood, who had a common and frustrating habit of calling everyone by their first names as if they were her friends, said. “I think Hermione had managed to subdue him for a while but then he got loose.”
to be talked sense into, goddammit. As he rounded the corner toward the Room he thought he caught a glimpse of someone leaving the corridor, but he shook it off; it was probably just nerves making him see things.
“Sod off, Malfoy,” Potter said, but as he shoved past them Draco could see something like sadness in his eyes, and against his entire being almost wanted to take the words back.
They sat in silence for a few minutes more.
“Harry...I don’t mean to pry, but...have you ever had romantic feelings for Malfoy prior to the Amortentia?”
“It’s that simple?” Draco raised an eyebrow.
“Well, since you seem to be convinced that I need something, I thought I’d think of something that I might need, just to placate you, of course, I know how you Ravenclaws hate being wrong.”
Instead of the screaming and gore that Harry had expected, the locket shone a beam of light straight up into the air, and from it emerged a face—Hermione’s, bloody and dirty, wet with tears.
Pansy, the Blossoming Heiress to Subtlety in the high-backed chair to his left, laid one of her newly manicured hands on his, her silky ponytail slipping on one shoulder as she glanced at him.
Draco frowned. Madam Isolde Zabini might have been a serial killer, but he liked her. If anything had happened to her...well. It would be more than enough to get Blaise to join the side of the Dark Lord.
“Come on, Granger, what reason would I have to make Potter fall in love with me? I hate him. He disgusts me. When he comes within six feet of me I give a delicate shiver of revulsion,” Draco said. When he looked over at Potter he was amused to find tears shimmering in his eyes, and wished he’d got that one tiny Gryffindor to follow them with his camera.
“Well, I’d choose Granger,” Draco said, sitting between Theo and Blaise and crossing his legs. “I do owe her a life debt. Kill Weasley, torture then kill Potter.”
This is the first of my non-prewritten chapters, so I may end up missing a few weeks in the near future. I'll make sure to notify you beforehand! For now, all is proceeding on schedule. We get some espionage action in this chapter, which I'm very excited for. Please give me any feedback! Love y'all. Enjoy. Please.
?”—raced down the hall and into his private room, and shut the door. A few complex locking and warding charms, and he was safe. Out of the entire student body, only Granger might be able to break them, and she was, remarkably and for a change, on his side today.
“I, for one, find this list quite reasonable, Headmaster,” said Theo, who, leaning slightly forward in his simple wooden chair, looked every bit the Solemn Trustworthy Good Slytherin, his slim figure and large eyes accentuated by his black robes.
“Do you have any proof that this was Mr. Malfoy’s doing, Potter?” she asked, returning to her desk and casting a quiet, disgusted “Tergeo” at the pool of Harry’s saliva beside the parchment.
“By the young Nott boy,” Dumbledore said, nodding. “We offered him protection at Hogwarts for the foreseeable future. I must tell you I was shocked that he reported it to the Order, but he seemed to have been...persuaded to do so. I assume by your face that you know nothing about it.”
“I thought you’d be pleased,” Malfoy said, sneering at him. “I’ve
He trailed after Malfoy down the quiet, empty corridor from the main library chamber to a private study room. Malfoy tried the knob and found it locked.
Ron snorted. “That’s not the body part I’d be worried about.”
to himself and looking as though he’d just swallowed a live bowtruckle, Draco softened.
“I don’t exactly listen to my mother much anymore,” Pansy snapped, and then grimaced at her hands. “But in this case...she was right, it’s a nasty habit.”
When Blaise turned toward him, Draco quickly stuffed the rest of the truffle in his mouth and got to checking in on his minions. At the Ravenclaw table Boot still looked a bit too skinny, but other than that fine. But Summerby wasn’t at the Hufflepuff table.
It was actually a pleasant dinner. The Ravenclaw table was fairly quiet, and Harry appreciated the quick conversation, at least until Anthony Goldstein and Cho got into a screaming match over the best way to brew an antidote to an overly-potent Dreamless Sleep.
He rifled around in his school bag before yanking out a massive scroll.
“What makes you think I need something? Maybe I just came here to look at your beautiful face,” Draco said.
Potter’s body seemed confused as to what had just happened but eventually collapsed softly to the floor, and he poked his head up after a moment, squinting. He opened his mouth but no sound came out.
Draco pulled on his matching set of champagne satin and lace pajamas and tossed his hair.
“No,” Potter admitted. “But it makes me feel a hell of a lot better. Did you find anything when you legilimens-ed him?”
having sex.”
“Git,” Draco said, and pulled him closer.
Blaise toppled to the ground, his hand still outstretched. Draco whirled around, wand at the ready, to find—
“What is your problem?” Draco burst out after the fourth time he yawned and Potter jolted toward him as though attempting to catch him.
“Hello, Harry,” Hermione said, covering her face with her hands. “I—well—I get my best ideas when there’s some blood flow going, and Teddy was just—”
“I need to talk to you,” Harry said in as low a voice as he thought was audible, sitting down opposite her.
“Alohomora,” Harry said, and frowned when there appeared to be more locking charms in place. He disabled them and opened the door—
“The locket,” Dumbledore said. “Young Theo said he was in Knockturn Alley upon an emergency visit home last weekend and saw one Mundungus Fletcher selling a locket that looked exactly like Slytherin’s locket he’d seen in a book. After further examination, he came to believe that it was a dangerous Dark artifact and brought it to me. I saw that it was the Horcrux at once.”
“Just contemplating the necessity of Slytherin House in the school ecosystem,” Draco told her. “Why, are you jealous?”
4. Thanks so much for reading, kudos, and comments! It really means a lot.
“That’s not why I called you here,” Draco said. “I need you to draft some quick plans for things we can do to Potter. Some ideas—off the top of my newly-ginger head, which was a style choice
Harry groaned, stretched, thought very hard about his meeting with Dumbledore until he felt a bit less...warm, and got out of bed.
Harry was a man now, and men made war.
“I’m going to bed,” Blaise said, and standing with catlike grace made his way around the corner and up the stairs.
Herbology was his next class, but just as Draco left the castle, a swishing noise from the sky caught his attention, and he looked up to find Potter hovering there on his broom, holding a bucket of something that looked very red. Draco tried to run but it did no good. The red stuff fell directly on his beautiful person and no spell would get it off, and he just knew it would completely ruin his naturally platinum blond hair.
Draco nodded tightly, and as they pulled apart Potter happened to stroll through the exit of the Great Hall.
Harry nodded. “Is it...anything serious?”
Harry glowered. “Then...no, Professor.”
“Aww, is wittle Nottiekins scared of us?” Pansy asked, pinching his cheek.
“And you’ve been trying to catch him in the act for five years so he could get his due.”
“Thanks, Malfoy,” Boot said, looking relieved and still a bit shocked, and stumbling as he got up from the table. Draco started to stride away, appearing, he imagined, very much like a swishy sunbeam.
“Excellent, excellent.” The windows on either side of Dumbledore’s desk somehow cast identical flanks of light into the room, painting him in twice the brightness in the place where their axis of symmetry intersected. His little half-moon glasses shone. “Harry, I must tell you—another of the Horcruxes has been found.”
“Harry?”
Draco hid around the corner from the entrance to the Hall, peeking around to be sure Potter wasn’t anywhere in the immediate vicinity. He felt a sudden pang of longing for the time Moody had turned him into a ferret. A lovely little ferret wouldn’t have to be afraid like this. He could just slink off and lie low for a while and make friends with some of the castle’s rats. Draco Malfoy, King of the Rats. It had a good ring to it. He filed that idea away to put on his vision board later.
“Easy,” Blaise scoffed, at the same time Theo choked on a Bertie Botts bean.
“Ah,” Boot said. “You want a Hufflepuff.”
Observing him out of the corner of his eye, Draco let out a long breath.
“Yes.”
“Somewhere we won’t be seen,” Dumbledore said. He led Harry to the nearest broom closet, cast “Alohomora,” and opened it.
Remembered the joy on Potter’s face when he thought Draco would be caught out, the way his mouth curved with triumph and his eyes glowed. Draco refused to prove him right.
“Oh, very good aim, Dean,” Lovegood said, smiling and ducking a pie coming the other direction. “They say lemon is helpful in fighting Nargles.”
Draco had long ago learned, though, that the slower Snape spoke, the angrier he was.
“Right then.”
Tonks stepped forward and, after a bit of fiddling, got the locket open.
“Well, I came up here because I didn’t trust you,” Potter said. “And you were about to get yourself killed, so I can trust you now.”
“Mm-mmm!” came from the bed, and Draco shot to his feet as first Blaise’s jaw, then his forehead, and finally his lips began to work again.
Hello everyone!
“Harry, I really don’t want to go through this with you again,” Hermione said. “It was a despicable thing to do but it’s not like you should be surprised, it’s Malfoy. Like I keep saying, you should go to Professor Dumbledore. Drugging anyone into romantic attraction is absolutely unacceptable and against school rules, and as you seemed perfectly inclined to sleep with Malfoy, you have every right to—”
“Good,” Draco said brusquely, and leaned back in his chair. He watched as Boot blinked slowly and his eyelids fluttered. He looked a mess. Draco himself would never allow this kind of slobbery, and he was vaguely amused. “What in Salazar’s name happened to you, anyway, Boot? Did someone slip an overactive Pepper-Up into your tea without your knowledge so that you’d stay up all night and be too tired to do your best in the Charms test the following day?”
myself. Isn’t that the kind of sentimental hogwash you just love?”
“I didn’t do anything,” Malfoy protested. “You tried to seduce me and I hit you and escaped your horrid clutches.”
dream.
“That’s...specific,” Boot said, giving Draco a skeptical look.
“Right.”
Harry surged forward and struck the locket, a blow that made a dull whacking sound against the parlor table, and a whistling shriek issued forth from the schism, like air escaping from a balloon.
. He’d had it every night since the Amortentia incident over a week ago, and every time he woke hot and frustrated. And he didn’t know what it meant.
“Of course,” said Boot, who was looking at Draco as though he was a rather cute kitten who kept sticking his claws into the furniture.
Thank you so much to everyone who is reading, kudos-ing, and commenting on my fics! I treasure each of your feedback. Please feel free to tell me if you have any ideas/prompts for me! Although next week is finals for me, I have a chapter waiting in the wings so hopefully my upload schedule won't be interrupted (despite some very inopportunely timed computer issues). Enjoy. Please.
Almost. Until he saw Blaise laughing and he grinned.
It took a couple of hours after talking to Potter to get him alone, but finally Draco peered over a few stacks of books on a table in the library to see Boot’s bespectacled face there. He pulled out one of the chairs at the table and sat down.
She rifled around in it, held it up to her eye to look inside, and then shoved her whole arm in, finally withdrawing it with a bottle about the size of her palm.
“Oh, Harry!” she said, looking up and smiling at him in that focused way Hermione had, as though he was also a subject of her study and she desperately wanted to figure him out. The light from the fire was dim and her face was thrown into contrast. “What is it?”
Thanks so much for the continued love on this and my other fics! I deeply appreciate it. I have a few chapters stocked up so even though finals season is approaching me like a horrific massive beast passing beneath a tiny rowboat on the ocean, I will be able to post from my seat and keep rowing. Enjoy this chapter. Please.
other people’s work—and instructed Boot to meet him in the library early the next morning.
After classes finished Draco drank tea that was too hot and scarfed down a few biscuits and went up to the seventh floor three minutes early. Blaise showed up a minute later, looking composed from a distance, though Draco, who’d known him since they were children, could see the anxious set of his mouth and the tension in his shoulders.
“Oh,” Dumbledore said as two horrified Hufflepuffs looked up from unbuttoning each other’s shirts. “So sorry. Carry on.”
When he approached Malfoy under the Cloak, he found him looking ill and tired, as usual. It was hardly any fun to fight with him anymore, but now Harry had a reason.
His voice, when it finally fought its way free of his lips, his throat, his chest, his ghosts, was soft and gravelly.
After most of the others had left the table, Luna looked over at Harry with her protruding blue eyes. As unsettling as her Spectrespecs were, Harry found her eyes even more so, like an X-ray.
“We need to talk.” Harry gritted his teeth.
Mission accomplished.
and a shockwave of sound shook him to the ground as he was abruptly thrown out of Blaise’s mind. In the real world, only a millisecond would’ve passed, and Draco took just a moment to adjust, not quite opening his eyes.
At Harry’s blank look, she continued. “Well, you know that Amortentia smells like whatever most attracts the person. Because it’s a magical substance, that attraction usually aligns with magical compatibility.”
In fact, he might have accidentally already guaranteed it wouldn’t. He put checking in with Daphne Greengrass about that missed period on his mental to-do list.
Behind him, Boot pleaded weakly for him to color-code the notes.
“Of course,” Draco said. He didn’t mention that he’d been telling Crabbe and Goyle to rough Boot up a bit lately so he’d be more inclined to acquiesce. It was the Slytherinly thing to do. “Anything for you, my lovely eagle-spawn.”
Malfoy didn’t look up, just kept writing in that sideways way he had, cramped and delicate like a crab’s trail.
"He’s my godfather; I’ll deal with him.”
“Why?” Draco asked. He moved a bit closer and stopped when he saw Blaise’s eyes narrow.
He waved an imperious hand.
“No,” Draco said, “and if I’d thought about it I’d have quickly taken that thought back upon seeing you today. You look like you’ve been run over by a thestral. I don’t want any more of you.”
Granger hit him across the face.
“Proof?” Harry spat. “For five years I’ve been told that I need to prove Malfoy’s guilty of things he just gets away with, but this time I
Dumbledore folded his glasses and set them on his desk. “This is a very serious allegation, Harry, and I assure you it will be given due attention in time,” he said, “but for now, we have a Horcrux to destroy. I assume that takes precedence.”
“Why did you come sit with us tonight?” she asked, biting into her third treacle tart of the evening.
Boot almost fell out of his chair trying to take it back. “Malfoy, give that back! I need it! My Potions marks will plummet!”
1. Yes. I missed last week. I am in the United States and...with everything going on I genuinely just forgot. Sorry about that.
Hermione glanced from him to Malfoy, and her eyes widened. “
“You can’t have just not noticed that Potter got hot last year,” Pansy told him, glaring daggers from her round brown eyes. “After all, didn’t the man practically beg to sleep with you a week ago?”
Dumbledore removed it with a bit of wordless magic, wiped it down, and stowed it back in his pouch as Kingsley gathered the remnants of the locket and put them back in his pocket. All of them dispersed; Tonks ruffled his hair as she went, and Lupin gave him a concerned look but after a silent discussion with Dumbledore over Harry’s head left as well.
He put his feet up on Crabbe’s obliging back—the Room of Requirement could’ve provided a footstool, but this was just much more to the effect he wanted—and leaned back in his favorite tufted emerald armchair.
“And everyone knows that Slytherins make the best spies anyway,” Pansy added, reverting from subtlety to her usual blunt intensity.
3. I'm not super happy with this chapter so it may undergo a bit of revision later but I wanted to get it up on time.
“And good to see you looking so well, Kingsley,” Dumbledore said. “Please do call me Albus, you haven’t been my student for thirty years.”
“What?” Draco asked, leaning back on his hands.
“What do you need?” Boot asked, putting down his quill carefully. While he was distracted with polishing his glasses Draco snuck a peek at his Transfiguration paper.
So sorry this is a day late! I had it written; just forgot with how busy this week was. I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe! Thank you for your bookmarks, kudos, and comments. Continue to enjoy. Please.
“Mr. Malfoy, I’m afraid the griffin will not answer, no matter how admirable your skills of oratory may be,” Dumbledore said, his voice hoarse.
too many times.
“Headmaster, you know well that part of the reason we request asylum from the Order is that our families and loved ones are deeply and in some cases inextricably in service to the Dark Lord, some willingly and others under Imperius or coercion,” Theo began. “Many of us have ourselves been under some kind of pressure to serve the Dark Lord. It is precisely these connections that could make us so valuable to you.”
Some people had all the luck.
Draco glanced to Pansy, who was looking uncharacteristically somber, her dark, perfectly sculpted brows drawn together. She raised a hand to her mouth and he realized she was biting her nails. That was when he knew they were serious.
“Four feet,” Boot said, raising an eyebrow.
“Perhaps I should.” The foot-long scroll of demands printed in Pansy’s perfect society-darling handwriting slid beneath Dumbledore’s hand as he glanced down at it once more. “My inquiry stands.”
There was a minute of silence.
“Where’s Ron, by the way?” Harry asked, glancing around. He hadn’t seen Ron since earlier that day.
“Hello, Harry,” she said, looking pleased. “Your wrackspurts look mollified today.”
“Good on them,” Harry said, grinning at her and looking around at the rest of the table a bit apprehensively.
“Er.” Harry ran a hand through his hair. “Look—I know we said we weren’t going to talk about it, but are you okay? I know it was a bit—rocky when you and Hermione—and now this thing with Parkinson—”
As they entered Kingsley Shacklebolt and Tonks were in the front hall awaiting them.
Betraying a friend for the greater good. The exact opposite of what a Slytherin would normally do. Draco pushed away any feelings he might have had about it.
As he got dressed he considered the dream.
Potter pulled off the cloak to reveal his naked torso. Draco covered his eyes, but was relieved to find upon peeking through them (he was a Slytherin, honor meant nothing to him, he was just trying to spare himself some trauma) that Potter was wearing Muggle trousers. His face was flushed, and his dark hair stuck up in all directions.
“I did
“Were you going to tell him about our talk with Dumbledore, Draco?” Nott asked, sitting on the table in the center of the room and swinging his legs. Harry’d never heard him speak before, but his voice wasn’t much of a surprise: low and soft, as though it was meant to act as a calm undercurrent in a conversation.
“Really?” Harry took a seat eagerly in front of Dumbledore’s desk.
His glasses were on his bedside table, and so was his wand. Harry grabbed for one, then the other, put on his glasses, and whispered, “Tempus.” It was already six-thirty. He had a lesson with Dumbledore in an hour.
“And now you’re...unhappy about it.” Ron sounded like he was reading Harry’s tea leaves and they didn’t make any sense.
Pansy looked furious. Draco was one thing—his birthday was only a few days after the end of classes. Pansy, meanwhile, would have to be sequestered for
Something about the look on his face made Draco nervous. “Is there some problem with that?”
“Now, Harry, we must open the locket for it to be destroyed,” Dumbledore said. “It will show you visions, attempt to hurt you, try everything it can to save its own life. But you must ignore it. Destroy the locket. Keep a single-minded focus.”
“He made fun of you for various reasons, made all of our lives a living hell, etc., etc.”
Theo grinned at him. “I’d be disappointed if you didn’t.”
“Oh, sod off, Potter,” he mumbled.
Hermione shrieked, knocked over her inkwell, and scrambled off the head of a figure that Harry was alarmed to find was Theo Nott.
“Right,” he said. “Well, I’ve got to go to bed. I have a lesson with Dumbledore tomorrow and I want to get up early to get a fly in before breakfast.”
“Never mind where I got it,” said Granger, who for some reason had gone a bit pink. “It’s where I’m going to put it that should concern you.”
He could feel tension leaking out of Theo’s body, and let out a long breath.
His foot scuffed on the stone floor, and Malfoy turned. “Hominem revelio!” he called, and his eyes narrowed when Harry’s form revealed itself.
“That’s my job. Terrifying Death Eater and all,” Draco said, giving him a rakish grin. He watched Boot swallow and saw that it’d been effective. For such a smart bloke, he was awfully susceptible to the Malfoy charms. Of course, Draco saw those two things as being correlated, not contrasted.
Harry...hesitated. It would have been so easy to rat Malfoy out for the Amortentia, to get him expelled. But in that moment Dumbledore’s words about Slytherins came back to him, and he gritted his teeth. Malfoy was as close to Voldemort as any Hogwarts student was. Couldn’t he play a crucial part on their side, if Harry could just make peace with him?
“Very well,” Dumbledore said. “I’ll have a counterproposal from the Order to you soon. Until then, stay well, and please don’t hesitate to come to me with anything you might need.”
“We need to talk,” Harry said. “Come on.”
“What talk with Dumbledore?” Hermione asked with great interest. “Theo, you didn’t tell me about this.”
“If you were sleeping, how did you hear him say it?” Harry pointed out.
Harry muttered, “Incenduscule,” and flicked a little ball of fire from his wand onto the corner of Malfoy’s parchment.
“Thank you, Severus,” Dumbledore said.
Draco nodded at Theo, who leaned farther forward and brought his hands out of the wide sleeves of his robes.
“Potter, just because you were wrong about Blaise doesn’t mean you have to suddenly start pitying Slytherins.”
“You can’t counteract me that way,” Granger said. “I took points and you can’t take them back.”
“What are we going to do with him?” Potter asked, scrambling to his feet like an overexcited dog with too-big paws and casting
There was dead silence.
“Was that Dumbledore for an apology?” Pansy asked Draco as they made their way down the corridor back down to the dungeons.
“You tried to have sex with Snape while he was asleep? How did you even get into his chambers?” Harry asked.
Nott rifled around in his pocket and handed Hermione a scrap of fabric which Harry realized with utmost horror was her underwear.
McGonagall was highly unimpressed when he scribbled, “TONGUE STUCK TO ROOF OF MOUTH. BLAME MALFOY. RECOMMEND IMMEDIATE EXECUTION.” on a piece of parchment in her office, but nonetheless removed the offending stickage.
“What, you didn’t trust me to do this on my own, so you decided to follow me?” Draco asked, his slight amusement turning to anger. Typical Potter.
“Five o’clock,” Blaise reminded him in a low voice, then turned and began to slink off down the corridor.
“If you and Pansy were fighting about my being potioned—what was everyone else fighting about?”
“Bad genes,” Potter said, shrugging.
, however faintly.
“Yes,” Draco said, sniffing haughtily. “Not like it’s any of your business.”
“No, no, I was asleep,” Malfoy said. He shuddered. “Somnophilia is a major turn-off for me.”
Of course, minions would always have their uses.
He leaned in close to the stone wall, whispered, “Weasley is Our King,” and slunk in, at which point he made a wild break for it—ignoring Theo Nott’s call of, “Malfoy, you sod, did a curse rebound on your cock
“Yes,” Theo said, laughing. “Very much so.”
Ah. Maybe this was why Ravenclaw House existed. To know stupid things like this.
“Besides continue to ruin my life, that is,” Harry said, biting into a piece of toast and imagining it was Malfoy’s neck. He shuddered. That particular fantasy was one he would not be repeating now that he had—oh God—actually bitten Malfoy’s neck. In a completely different way, but still.
“Yes, I do, Hermione, but...me and Malfoy? Are you serious?”
He was still grinning.
“What the hell did you come barging in for?” Hermione demanded.
Hermione winced and waved her wand. “Muffliato.”
Ron slapped his own cheek gently. Harry wondered whether Hermione had gotten him into that habit. She slapped people very softly when she was happy with them, and hard when she wasn’t.
“I’ll deal with Severus,” he said.
“Which is it?” Harry asked. “The Horcrux?”
Boot had his head on his folded arms, smearing his face with ink, and looked like he was trying to set his parchment on fire with his mind.
“If you say anything to the effect of ‘I just know’ I will personally give you detention,” McGonagall said, straightening her hat.
“Harry, no! Please stop!” she cried out. “Don’t do it!”
Both of the others sighed.
Nott smiled at her shyly. Harry tried very hard not to like him, which was difficult because at the moment all his energy was entirely taken up by being hacked the fuck off at Malfoy.
“I’d fuck Weasley,” Theo said, and upon their incredulous stares shrugged. “You two took the other ones and I don’t want to encroach on your territory.”
“So...what do we do now?” Harry asked. “We have to destroy it, don’t we?”
“You know me so well,” Draco sighed.
Hermione looked at him over her Transfiguration book with an expression that was equal parts ah-my-dear-sweet-brother and I’m-going-to-strangle-you.
“Right...well, whenever you weren’t doing that, you could just do what we do. You know, we could teach you to lurk and slink and grovel, very useful skills, and you could eat lots of sweets, and if you wanted to play our party games in the Slytherin common room I suppose that’d be fine.”
“Potter, for once, can you just accept that you don’t know everything about people, and not everything is always just good or bad?”
“What are you playing at?” he said, turning to Malfoy and glaring at him.
He shut the door.
It had been a very simple plan. Brew some Amortentia, make Potter fall in love with McGonagall, a day of hilarity for Draco and sheer torment for the both of the victims. He’d gotten the idea from a Muggle play he’d read by some man named Wilhelm Shivermetimbers or something.
“Well, while you were—you know, under the potion—Pansy and I were fighting because I’d figured out you were potioned—well, Hermione did, but she told me. Anyway, we were arguing about it and then one thing led to another, I guess.”
and then the dream diverges from reality, or at least what Harry’s been informed of. Malfoy’s kissing him back, his hands in Harry’s hair as Harry grasps for his waist, his tongue hot even as his body is cool, the way Harry always imagined it would be, and they’re on the floor, and Harry’s pulling at Malfoy’s robes, and his skin is so soft and—
“But I’ll have some conditions.”
Everyone kept staring at Harry—even more than usual—with looks of bemused fear and sometimes curiosity on their faces. A few looked envious.
Once Harry Potter, boy wonder, Chosen One extraordinaire, eye-glistener with the ghosts of his past, scarface himself, latched onto you, he. Would. Not. Leave.
“Blaise! How are you feeling?” he said.
Malfoy snorted. “So why are we talking?”
“I thought your mother trained that out of you long ago,” Draco said.
“I got him under control about an hour ago,” she said, “but then he escaped. I went to the library.”
“Just one more thing, Harry,” Dumbledore said. He removed his little glasses and the shadows of his face threw themselves out of proportion with the sunlight. “Mr. Nott brought this Horcrux to our attention against all odds, and at great risk to himself—something that Slytherins do not usually do. I am afraid I have been too quick to write them off in the past. I want you, Harry, to try and promote some inter-house unity and find out more about the Horcruxes. The more Slytherins we can get on our side, the closer access we have to the Dark Lord, and the safer our students will be.”
“Crabbe, Goyle, you’re dismissed,” he said. Then he grabbed the enchanted coins he’d made—copying Granger’s strategy for the DA club the previous year, if there was anything Slytherins knew it was approp—he meant—
He could hear Granger whispering from the other side of the door, and a soft tremor in the air. She was dismantling the wards. Draco threw Potter off him again and grabbed for his wand, but Potter growled and grabbed both Draco’s wrists in one of his large hands. They’d used to be the same size but now Potter had a weight and build advantage, although Draco was the tiniest bit taller.
“Oh, nothing,” Ron said breezily. “They just got into the spirit of things.”
“It’s okay,” Draco said, wrapping his arms around Blaise.
Summerby, lounging on the silver divan opposite, grinned under her dark fringe, a soft grin that could serve in itself as a testament to her goodness. “I set the tripwire and met Potter as he was coming out of McGonagall’s office. We greeted each other and he waved at me. After he fell I went to ask him if he was alright. I can provide an eyewitness account of what occurred. To all appearances, Malfoy wasn’t involved.”
And despite everything Ron had said, when Harry climbed the stairs to the dormitory and tossed himself into bed, he couldn’t help replaying one moment in his mind: just after Pansy and Ron exited the broom closet, when Ron tucked one strand of her dark hair behind her ear. It was an intimate, friendly gesture, not something Harry would associate with hate sex or a one-night stand.
