” He cried out when Potter hit a spot inside him, from his moan, it was like Potter got the signal, and all he did was hitting that same spot over and over again. Now that he was used to Potter’s size, the pain was overpowered by pleasure. Potter bit gently on his hard bud while fucking into Draco, the blond arched up and desired more, Potter intertwined his hands with Draco’s tightly, swallowing the blond’s moan when they kissed.
“We all kind of figured it all out eventually” Pansy chuckled “I swear Harry wasn’t really subtle, every week on our pub night, another person asked Hermione and I,
He exclaimed, but Pansy only looked at him even weirder than before. Was he going crazy? Was this a dream?
“I said we’ll see them tomorrow, good bye darlings” Narcissa said and stepped forward, she whispered something in Pansy’s ear and walked away with Lucius. As soon as the door closed, Pansy let out a loud breath
” Pansy cursed loudly and Draco realised the phone was on the couch and the girls couldn’t see anything “
“And since you didn’t go to the pub last week” Luna uttered with a soft angelic smile, with a hint of sadness in it. Harry couldn’t believe Draco would dump Brandon, so Draco was single now “And we know what you think, why did he break up with Brandon and didn’t start talking to you again?”
“You know the drill” Hermione said to Harry, but her fingers tapping on Pansy’s back from behind so Harry didn’t see. It was bloody Morse code, luckily Pansy had learned it just to woo Hermione in, sometimes they communicate with it, especially when they were scheming something in secret.
Theo walked by, whispering the words before sashaying away, Draco glared at him and looked at the small flower vase in the middle of the table. They both didn’t say a thing for the past three minutes
“Try to persuade people to buy as much as you can” Pansy’s hands came up to fix Draco’s hair “Be charming”
?” Pansy pointed at Harry with a sceptical look in her eyes “Hermione never mentioned how good-looking you are”
“No, no” Harry said into his ear “You can’t touch yourself until I tell you to, Draco” The blond whimpered quietly and put his hand back on the table as Harry pushed the third finger in, opening him up.
“Another day” Hermione rubbed Pansy’s back in soothing circles “It’s alright, we are almost halfway there, we can do this another time”
“I think he could tell Draco is gay, so I improvised and volunteered myself” Potter shrugged and handed Draco his bottle of sunscreen
“I was just in the bar earlier” Potter said and sat down “Just saw Pansy and she told me to go in first”
“We’re short on one person” Seamus spoke up as some of the students gathered around in a circle on the floor. Draco stood from a few feet away and watched Harry sitting next to Ron, he should have known Gryffindors always like party games the most “Anyone else want to join?”
“I…but you grew your hair out” Draco muttered, she let her hair grow out for months now. How-how could it be?
“Sorry, got a date, with a man, who will remember me if he kisses me” He said and disappeared in a second. He arrived back in his house soon and realised he could have just taken the Floo in the Ministry instead of running like an idiot to the Apparition point. Draco sighed and shook it off, he needed some time alone
“Of course. Draco, you interested?” Pansy turned around and asked him “You could stay back, I mean, it’s for couples”
“Fine, but you’ll have to listen to her lecture on settling down” Pansy shrugged, chugging on her Firewhisky and asked Hannah for another “You know, Draco, you’re 30”
“What are you getting at, Ron?” He asked, he knew Ron has a point when he mentioned all of this, he has to.
“That’s all you heard?” Pansy gawked at him and kicked his leg from under the table, making him gasp in pain “It’s none of your business”
“You did that?” Harry opened his eyes wide, Draco liked him? Draco wore short robes to flirt with him? And he didn’t even notice? “To…to seduce me?”
“Yeah” Harry said, losing his balance a bit when Ron Apparated back to his place. Instead of the quiet sound in the street just a second ago, he heard people shouting, music blasting out loud now
“Thank you” Hermione whispered softly to her ear each time Pansy made the same toast over and over again
“I love you” Harry said, pulling his fingers out and Draco can heard his zipper being pulled down and the clacking sound of his belt hitting the ground. Harry kissed the spot behind Draco’s ear and the blond looked at the city in front of him, it felt just like their first time again. In his life, he regretted a lot of things, but until he met Harry, he never think back again,  he never regretted giving Harry his virginity, he never regretted burning all those things to meet Harry, everything was perfect with Harry.
“Are you open for tutoring?” He asked, waiting for an answer from Blaise, but all the guy did was keep writing. Draco smiled with a tiny bit of annoyance in his expression. Blaise was not the talkative type, but so did the other Blaise in the other world, he had noticed. Draco elbowed him and snapped his fingers “Blaise, come on, it’s a great deal”
“Are you going to fuck me in the Great Hall?” Draco asked, pressing his lips in a thin line. Harry and him have fucked in a lot of places, but to do it in Hogwarts, it was definitely something else, a
well, kind of, when we were in your Manor, when you didn’t identify him. I think, some parts of you wanted us to win, wanted Harry to stay alive and win” With everything Hermione was saying, Draco found himself facing the truth…he has always been all over Potter from the start “And after that, do you remember the trial?”
“What’s going on with you?” he said, glancing at the girls every few minutes to make sure the violinist wasn’t a murderer with a knife hid in his violin or something like that, he looked back at Potter, who was avoiding his gaze, who continuously fiddled with his food instead of eating, and whose legs were shaking nonstop under the table, as if Draco didn’t feel it.
“Er, well, not really” Potter said, his hands gripping on his robes tightly “It’s okay, er, I’m not hurt”
“You’re a menace, you know that?” Draco laughed softly and traced his fingers on Harry’s chest, leaning into his husband’s kisses “You already fill me up many times today, I’m sure it’s all in me”
“Well, I will go now, Ron and I just finished investigating and I thought I could drop by to ask you”
Pansy squealed as soon as the bell rang, Draco looked at her and looked back at Harry, he didn’t even have the time to say anything yet. Draco choked on his own words and watched Harry moved to another table, with the guy who was flirting with Harry before, right next to him. Draco started panicking, he didn’t know what to do. He lost his chance again, and now the guy was all over Harry just like a while ago
” He let out a small whimper and covered his mouth again. Luckily, Draco and Harry were yelling so they didn’t hear what sound Ron just made “
“You are the best thing that happened to me” Harry confessed “That night, the alcohol only made me say the words I never could out loud, I wish I hadn’t been
Draco shook his head and pointed at their locked hands. He pressed their hands against his chest “Er, I…
“I guess go, well, I hope so” Pansy said, putting the lipstick back in her bag and fixed her hair for the tenth time “I heard
“Yeah, for quite a while now” Pansy leaned on the headboard and put the champagne bottle between her thighs “I noticed it and asked Hermione, she told me everything”
Harry muttered, gazing down at Draco, he has got that intense look in his eyes that made Harry felt more intimidated than ever “It was nothing”
He groaned, looking up at the clear blue sky, squinting his eyes after he realised it was the middle of July.
“Although I don’t know why he chose you” Lucius huffed softly and Narcissa cleared her throat, subtly telling him to stop being grumpy “I can’t do anything about it. But…” He turned his look into death glares and pointed his cane at Harry “If you dare make my son feel unhappy, if you make him cry, if you hurt him, I will do things you cannot imagine, even if it means I’d get my soul sucked out afterwards” He said, and Harry nodded, Lucius was a father after all, he has the rights to be protective of his own son
He exclaimed as reality started to hit him. Did somehow the mirror took him to another world? A parallel world perhaps?
you, I had to bring my girlfriend safely back” Pansy said, stepping in with Granger and setting her down next to the fireplace, the brunette finally leaned up to give Pansy a kiss with a smile and a small “Thank you” whispered between them before she continued reading again “And also, I intended to spend the night here. What are you going to do?”
“Ginny fainted right before New Year, Pansy. How do you expect us to kiss?” Draco huffed, tying his bathrobe up, all of them were worried about Ginny. Even Ron cried, but it was partly because he was already so pissed from drinking, the alcohol made him cry.
” Hermione huffed, her lips quirked up into a small smile “Apparate home, do things, we’ll meet up tomorrow”
asked him with his eyebrow arched, Draco rolled his eyes and glanced at the table Harry was sitting at. He was all smiling, talking with his dates while Draco couldn’t even look at anyone without comparing them to Harry. They could not…they simply couldn’t, Harry was the best thing he’s ever asked for, and Draco lost him. Draco looked back at the guy in front of him and felt like hexing this guy, who kept winking at him.
“It’s stupid when I say it’s stupid” She covered his lips with her finger and stopped him from talking “You have been hiding in your place, looking like a wreck every single day. And it breaks my heart seeing you like that, Draco. And I’m sorry it ended like that, no one knew it would happen that way, we surely didn’t expect it. How were you supposed to know you two were going to break up
Draco kept hearing two people talking next to him, the same voice from earlier, and another voice, of a girl, also a voice he had heard before
“Be patient, Potter” He smirked when Harry pouted and pointed to the door in his bedroom, that was probably the bathroom, Draco kissed the Auror’s cheek before sashaying away. When he got in the bathroom and closed the door, Draco breathed out, he wasn’t always composed like that, he needed a moment to calm himself first, even he couldn’t believe he was in Harry’s house right now, about to sleep with the man. Draco took off his jeans and black boxer, getting in the tub and turned the water on, feeling the cold water from his head to his toe, he almost forgot he was already half hard, just the thought of Harry pining him to the wall had him harder, let alone imagining how Harry would fuck him. The blond leaned back on the wall and closed his eyes, he was about to do something crazy. Draco turned off the water and walked out of the bathtub to open the door quietly, looking at Harry, who was lying on the bed and staring at the ceiling, Draco bit his lips at the sight
“Walter Mendoza, 33 years old, currently managing an art museum in Abergavenny, he has a former wife, Anthea Francis, and two kids, a 9 years old son, Duncan, and a 5 years old daughter, Tatianna, he split up with his wife two years ago and won child custody since his wife has an addiction problem, though she’s getting better, according to her mother” Draco eyed the room when he heard people whispering, he absolutely hated it when he’s talking in a meeting and other people think they could too, it was highly disrespectful. He glared at a certain raven-haired and redhead Aurors at the table “He was found dead in his own house last night, stabbed in the chest 11 times with a sharp knife on while he was sleeping” He heard some Aurors gasping at it, and yes, he almost threw up at the scene, it was bloody and scary, the smell was indescribable “Time of death is occurred around 11 at night to 2 in the morning, his kids were in the other bedrooms and didn’t hear any screaming, there were no sign of struggling and the door was locked from inside”
” Pansy cupped his face and touched everywhere on his body “Are you okay? Did you get hurt? Were you attacked?
“Okay…” She said, looking the other way before lifting her chin up a little “Thank you” She said, her voice was low but he could still hear every single word. Ginny quickly rushed out of the library and Draco stood there, he probably got her to soften up a bit now, he hoped.
Draco flinched in surprise when something heavy was on his shoulder, he looked to his right to see Potter already dozing off
“Er…Do you mean it?” Harry spoke and Draco looked back at him “When you say you’re in love with me? The other me?”
excited for this. Draco smiled and kissed Potter’s forehead “Can we…go somewhere else and continue this?”
—…” Draco stepped back when he saw a shadow of someone came from behind his reflection in the mirror, he turned around, but no one was here, he was alone in this room. When he turned back, Potter was standing next to him in the mirror “
batch of chocolates. He had sneaked back up and wrapped it in a box and kept it in his trunk until this morning. He intended to give it to Potter before first period, but the moment Potter stepped out of the dorm, his
“What are you doing staring at that parchment?” Pansy pulled him out of his thoughts, she was sitting on Blaise’s bed, holding herself up with her arms while arching her eyebrows at Draco “You seem to have some problems”
“Are you coming?” He asked, taking his shirt off to reveal his... Draco swallowed hard and diverted his eyes to look at the waterfall. Potter still trained hard at home, he could only assume by looking at his body. Who allowed him to look like that anyway?
“You could never humiliate yourself” Harry said, but Draco didn’t reply, he just went and rubbed lotion all over Harry’s…fucking broad chest and muscular body and…strong arms. He has no problem putting lotion on other men but when it came to Harry, he just lost it
” Draco cried out and buried his face in his hand. The jerk gave him so many stuff, now his house has
” He nodded repeatedly, and Harry pulled him in a hug, he breathed out shakily “I really want that, all the things you said”
“Yeah” Harry said, shrugging slightly, showing Ron the band ring, there were diamonds wrapped around each side of this classic ring with a high polish finish. Only Ron knew about his proposal plan.
“You know how much I love seeing your face during sex” Harry looked down at him, smirking and entering Draco again, thrusting fast just like before. Draco had already came but Harry was turning him on again, with his huge arms on Draco’s thighs, putting the blond’s legs over his shoulder, Harry leaned down to kiss him. Eyes closed, mouth slightly opened, Draco invited Harry in gracefully, his arms locked around the Auror’s neck, his moans were continuously being swallowed by Harry
“That was fun” Hermione said when they walked back to the resort with the chocolates they made wrapped in a cute small bags. The chocolate macadamia nuts candies that Potter made were perfect, the moment Draco had a taste of it, he had to bite back a moan “This is for you” Hermione said, handing a bag with a piece of chocolate shaped like Pansy’s head “I tried my best”
Pansy babbled and stared at Draco “I’ve heard your excuses for years, Draco. Don’t you think I’ve got those memorised on the back of my hand? Darling, listen…I love you, our friends love you, we just want you to find someone”
” Potter mumbled the last three words quietly but Draco still heard it, he could feel the blush creeping up his cheeks and damn Potter for making him look like that
the other day I was discussing the party with Granger in the Gryffindor Common Room, and Weasley got in, a few minutes later, she was dragging Potter out of there in a rush” Draco balled his hands into fists and closed his eyes, maybe he expected too much of this insane plan of his to succeed, now that it had failed, he couldn’t bear the disappointment.
“Okay, focus on me” He said, and used a finger to pull Harry’s lower eyelid down, he squeezed the bottle gently and let the eye drop fall into Harry’s eyes. Draco retreated his hands and sat back down on the bench, letting Harry closed his eyes for a while
” Harry snickered while speaking “I spent the last two days preparing for this, I want to know what happened that night, it was hard because Ginny, Ron and Pansy were drunk, Theo and Neville looking at each other but none of them knew it, Blaise taking care of Ron, Hermione and Luna’s memories were the only useful sources I could use” He snorted “I even asked Hermione to cut her hair again. I want…I want it to be
” Pansy stomped to Robards’s spot and poked his chest with her newly manicured nails “I married this woman to
“Hey” He called her, he wanted to do something nice, maybe a good thing without wanting anything back “I can get you Nimbus 3000”
Draco mumbled when Harry enveloped the blond’s length quickly, slurping and bobbing his head up and down, his hand traced from Draco’s inner thigh to his perineum, casting a wordless spell to lube Draco up before inserting a finger slowly inside the blond. The deeper he pushed in, the louder Draco got, he pulled away and knelt down on his knees, he pushed Draco’s legs up high and leaned in, pulling his finger out and sliding his tongue in smoothly
“No” Draco replied, and Harry felt tight in his chest, like disappointment, or sadness “I don’t regret leaving here to be a Healer in Paris, but I
Potter said, looking at Draco up and down, which only made the blond realised he was once again in his thin silk bathrobe in front of the Auror “I’m here, er, because, I, I want to—…”
“Are you alright?” Blaise mumbled in his ear and put his hand on the wall so that if Ron ever banged his head again, it’d be on Blaise’s hand. The redhead shook his head, resting his forehead on Blaise’s hand with a smile
“You like ripping them apart” Draco chuckled at him and leaned up for another kiss, letting Harry’s trousers fall down the ground and getting out of his robes, leaving his upper body naked. He jumped up and wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist, holding him tight and didn’t even break off the kiss as Harry carried the blond to the living room “
“Oh well, remember the thing I told you a few days ago about making a calendar of Aurors?” Hermione explained, and based on the dumbfounded looks on all Aurors’ faces, they didn’t have a clue
applies to alcohol” Ginny said and he heard her boots clicking, she was gone again. Draco tried to engulf all of Harry in his mouth, causing the head to touch the back of his throat, and Harry to jerk into him
“I’m here” Blaise appeared from out of nowhere and put an arm around Ron’s waist “You’re drunk. And Draco, hey, I’m glad you came”
“Should we?” Harry asked him, Draco nodded silently and they both walked to the mirror. There it was, he saw themselves in the mirror, but they were probably 80 years old or so there, their hands were still intertwined. Harry has his beard grown out there, while Draco’s hair was longer than now, it was reaching far down his back. They were still in their Auror and Healer robes, they looked older, with grey hair, but still happy “Are you seeing what I’m seeing? Us until we’re grey?”
“She’s right there, Ginny” He pointed at Luna, who was standing with Padma Patil “And how many glasses have you drank?”
“Oh, nothing” Harry grinned and kissed his head again “Just something I have for our date tonight, after we meet your parents”
He heard everyone started yelling loudly, counting down to the big moment. Harry took leaned down and suddenly their bodies were touching each other “…
“So soon?” Pansy asked, her lips forming into a pout but Hermione gave her a knowing look and she nodded quickly “
“Oh right” Harry said as they walked up the stairs “Maybe we could go, once our kids have their Yule Ball”
“Why…did you do all those things?” Draco asked, he hoped, just a little part in him hoped that Potter would say something…something that’d make him swoon, maybe Potter has something for him, if only…
“This isn’t my side of the bed” He said with a grin that was followed by Harry’s laugh, the left side was
Ron moaned, banging his head against the wall and he hissed in pain, both from Blaise pushing inside him and the pain on his forehead
“Hey, Granger, the Slytherin has a party this week, would you and everyone from Gryffindor like to join?” He turned to Hermione, earning a gasp from Pansy “Other Houses are invited too”
The little girl with long blonde hair came running to them both in her cute red swimming clothes with a small bucket and shovel on her hands “
“We’re leaving” Theo said, dragging Roger away out of the room, but as soon as they were out, Roger pinned him on the wall again, Theo sighed deeply, letting the Auror did what he want to do. He told himself this would be the last time he followed this stupid crush of his, he was never able to stop, Neville was the first man he ever had real feelings for, but the man didn’t have feelings back for him, so this was what heartbreaks felt like.
Draco said, reaching over to touch Harry’s cheek “You know you don’t have to do this, I can handle them”
“Well you fucked him, of course he’ll say hi to you” Ron scowled “It’s tiring, Blaise! To see everyone around me and wonder, have you fucked this one? I will never get that secured feelings and do you
Pansy confessed to their crushes, the only problem was that Pansy’s crush was sober at the time, and then Pansy got married to her crush, but for Draco? His crush was drunk and ended up throwing up on his perfectly new boots he just got
“Who doesn’t?” Pansy huffed, her face slowly slid down Hermione’s chest and she kept rubbing her cheeks on her wife’s undoubtedly comforting boobs, it felt more soft than any pillow she has ever lied on “They’re both idiots, they
“Hey” Draco tried to wave once he saw Neville coming to his spot with two empty glasses in his hands while Theodore was putting all his weight on the blond, making him tremble “Longbottom, can I, can I ask you for a favour?”
“That’s impossible” Draco scoffed, he could never like the Potter there in his world. The Harry here was the one that made him fall “What if we’re in a parallel world and it’s the way it is”
“Oh sod off, Potter” Draco hugged the files to his chest defensively and asked “What just happened?”
“I want you to look at the mirror there, Draco” Harry said, pointing at the mirror in the middle of the room “It’s not the mirror you think”
Draco mumbled, grabbing his robes from the bed and raised his arm to shield himself from Potter, who was still standing with a puzzled look on his face “
, I should have seen it coming, with the way he’s always staying back at his dorm, I mean, I’d understand it because I always…stay back at the dorm to have some quality time with Granger, who knows he was able to get in Weasley’s trousers before I could get under—…”
“You dozed off after thirty minutes through the opera, Potter” Draco said and rubbed his sore shoulder “Not to mention, you slept on my shoulder for more than two hours”
“Okay, yes” Harry gave up, Pansy and Hermione were probably the two smartest witches he knows and no lies could get through them, and Harry wasn’t good at lying “Maybe, it’s just a stupid thing, I never did it anyway”
“I don’t think it could be expressed into words” Harry murmured, ghosting his lips over Draco’s “Maybe I could show you”
He said with a serious tone, pointing at the two Aurors that were gossiping “You two there, noisy boys, Auror Potter and Auror Weasley, can I please have your attention?”
“I hit the bloody nail right on your head, Draco” Pansy smirked satisfactorily, sipping more of her drink and continued “I’m right, as always, you know—oh,
Draco gasped when the portrait opened to reveal the Gryffindor Common Room inside, he didn’t dare step in. What if Potter was here too?
“I disagree with your accusation” Blaise merely said, a small smirk appeared at the corner of his lips.
” Harry tightened his grip on Brandon’s collar, he could knock the guy out, but he shouldn’t. He did hurt Draco, he was the one who made Draco sad, he made Draco jumped into Brandon’s arms, just because he avoided Draco. Harry let go and the guy fell back on the ground on his feet just as someone entered the loo.
“Yeah, I think I do” Draco said with a knowing smile, they have been together for twenty two years after all, with just one look they’d know what the other one was thinking about. They opened the door and walked out hand in hand, they could still meet their friends later.
Every time he came back from the hospital, all he talked about was you! Then he was afraid you wouldn’t reciprocate his feelings and then he moped all day, so Hermione told him to get another Healer though she
“I don’t know much, but we were bored during one of the meeting and I started getting some hot news from Padma, who heard it from her sister Parvati, Parvati’s girlfriend, Lavender heard it because ever since she turned into a Werewolf, her hearing is really good” Pansy explained, while Draco was still trying to figure out what the hell she was saying “They seemed to have broken up a few days ago, only some people know, but I think Finnigan got a pretty loud voice, that’s why the news is getting out”
“Sorry, mate, we know you like him even before that” Ron smacked his chest and sighed loudly “Ready?”
“Uncle Harry” Harry looked down and saw Rose tugging at his jacket, she was holding a stuffed dragon and still in her pyjamas, she was probably up from her afternoon nap
Potter said quietly to his friend “Draco was kissing me because there was a guy that kept clinging to me, so he saved me by saying he’s my boyfriend, and we kissed to prove it”
Harry and Draco both looked up to see their friends walking to the beach, they were quite far away but they could hear Ron’s loud voice already. As soon as Draco saw a certain someone, he turned back to Harry and grabbed his playful hand
“I feel like I’m about to be murdered” Harry said, breaking the silence when his friends all laughed “What is this all about?”
“So, he said it was then he realised, he might have felt something in him, that wasn’t hatred, nor just feelings for friends for you” Hermione said calmly “That’s why he’s so awkward around you, trying to make small talks”
look good in your robes today, not that you don’t look good on other days, but you know, today…you were
“Oh, have you seen my scarf? I think the last place I left it was a few months ago when you healed my shoulder” Potter said, Draco realised he forgot to give Potter back his scarf the moment he has his eyes on the Gryffindor’s bare neck. Since that night, he had brought it back and folded it nicely, leaving it next to his pillow. For some reasons, it felt reassuring to sleep next to it.
“Yeah” Hermione seemed to understand whatever Pansy was implying and helped her “Wouldn’t want the Ginny incident to happen again, right?”
her back red and her front tanned because she forgot to apply it in the back, she then suffered a sunburn so painful that she claimed it was even worse than getting a Crucio. Draco squeezed some more cream out and started applying it on his arms and chest, his movements were smooth and careful, he slipped his hands under his waistband a bit and trailed up his neck. Draco stopped and looked at Potter
“He’s using you, I did it to tell you, to warn you” Harry tried explaining but no one seemed to believe him, Pansy and Hermione were ogling at him, Draco’s eyes were filled with shock, Brandon was standing behind Draco, his lips quirked up into a small smirk, and Harry was the only one to see it.
“Hey, is there a problem here?” Draco’s eyes widened when he looked up to see Potter standing behind his lounge chair. When did he get here?
” He whined softly, he made a mistake by waking up an inner beast inside Harry, he didn’t even know Harry could be this…hot and dominant, just when he thought he couldn’t fall for Harry any harder, he did.
, 2002” Draco said, Harry furrowed his eyebrows but he couldn’t remember anything “It was Hermione and Pansy’s wedding, we were all a bit tipsy after the party, I…I asked you whether I should keep being friends with the oblivious person I like or should I confess, and you told me to just confess already and then passed out on the table”
“Are you bringing Draco with you?” Granger asked, and Draco realised he and Potter probably do this every year “Or is he staying with his parents?”
“We did, we have never done it this much though” Potter answered and he stopped to wait for Draco to catch up. He hated climbing, hiking, or anything that makes him sweat, except sex, of course, he assumed...he has never done it before though
“I don’t care about the past, do you?” Theo cupped Neville’s face and kissed his lips gently, Neville shook his head, kissing Theo back “But I
” he murmured with heavy breath as soon as Harry let go, moving his lips down to Draco’s neck again, this time he went lower and latched onto Draco’s nipples. Draco opened his mouth, unable to control himself when all he could think of that he wanted Harry’s cock inside him right now. The Auror swirled his tongue around and sucked on the hard bud, his fingers still working at Draco’s entrance, he was stimulated everywhere, Draco couldn’t handle it “
“He obviously likes you, I thought you listened to me when I gave you that speech” Pansy said, reminding him about the time she made a board to prove that Potter liked him. Sometimes he wondered if Pansy and Granger would ever talk to each other, because they seemed like they would actually hit it off. He scoffed at her and nodded “Okay, so you did hear the speech. How are you not convinced? Theo believes it”
“Okay, remember, this is all of our effort put into one big gift for you two” Pansy said, leading Draco’s hand to keep walking. It was him and Harry’s anniversary, 22 years to be exact, their friends have surprised them by waking them up in the morning, covering their eyes and bringing them here “This took a lot of time”
“He likes you” Theo said, poking at Draco’s chest with a cheeky laugh “Bet he’d kiss you at midnight”
“You should head home first” He said and watched the man walked away, Theo sighed and walked into the bathroom near him. He had just let a perfectly good guy go because he couldn’t forget about one person. He stared at himself in the mirror, how did he become like this? Three years ago, he was fine. But Neville decided to come and…be nice to him, Theo wasn’t always cheerful like now, he was depressed, he was lonely, he filled his void by letting men filled themselves in him, he was emotionless. But then one day, three years ago, when a man touched Theo without his consent in the pub, Neville was the one to notice and caught the man, Theo was touched at first. Then it was the little things Neville did, and at one moment, Theo realised his heart beat faster when Neville came in a room, he started smiling more, wanting to be closer to Neville. But what did he receive? Nothing. Theo wasn’t a quitter, of course, he chased after Neville. It started to get disappointing after a while when all Neville did was…well, he didn’t even do anything.
you’re making it sad” Ron chuckled, gripping Harry’s shoulder and shaking it lightly “It’ll be okay”
“Said the person who decided to jerk me off when they were still out there” Blaise said, wiping some of the come off Ron’s face “Want to go home together?”
“Well, I thought that’s what close friends do, like Dean and Seamus, so I wasn’t sure if you liked me”
do it all the time” Ron explained, but Harry still couldn’t do it, he has had enough of weird dreams about Draco already, and he’d always wake up in sweats and a bulge under his trousers, he wasn’t going to do this too, and he knew it won’t help solving his problem anyway “Maybe doing it will get a few things off of you, maybe some pent up sexual urges”
” Draco cried out, tilting his head back and leaned on Harry’s shoulder, sobbing in ecstasy, he gripped on Harry’s biceps tightly and turned his head to the side for a kiss “
Draco dipped his bare feet into the sand and sighed, it was simply beautiful, the beach, the sky, the sun, the view was perfect, except…
“I want to look nice” He pouted and sat down, joining them for breakfast and chatting. Draco’s mind was elsewhere, he couldn’t focus on their conversation at all.
“No, I’m fine, don’t worry, my world is still here” She chuckled and the three of the Gryffindors sat down with them “Hey, darling?”
“Not yet, I’m trying” She huffed, her lips formed into a pout “Honestly, I don’t know why she’s being such an uptight person, she needs to relax a little”
'hey harry are you oke?, why you look so red' harry still feel the eyes of draco to him and ron looking at him for answer.
And also, terry boot, which I don’t who is he but he is in the harry potter’s movie, maybe I need to look the movie and books again later... (goodbye terry)
In the middle of night and the blond boy wanted to visit his friend, Harry. He never thought the person he trusted the most had the horrified secret he never thought it came true.
‘You…’ She began, ready to spring on her again. To scratch out her eyes and choke her with her bare hands. She spoke as if Ron Weasley deserve to be a curse or Harry Potter deserve to be coma for an unknown reason. As if one of these occurrences could be not so-called betray toward my new best friend, Draco.
'other slytherin? Who harry?' hermione eyes seem lost and feel uneasy to read the book she bought in muggle world.
'dear harry-' harry pause smilling as he continue again to read the small card, '-im going to give you a coat for up coming christmas, your best wish draco'
Now its his turn. Wonder what the he got for his first wand. Can't help to remember when his lose his wand in the battle with harry in forest with death eater behind him.
‘hurry come here! I’m read- ‘but the sentence was cut off as the younger boy was already on the ground, groaning in pain.
Beep beeep..well soe dear reader..i love to make mess up scene cause i like the way dramantic and unclear ones..
The people around us where all gone to the room as if the chaos were long again. Once again he feel the pair of eyes toward him. But he tried not look as he feel the heat were long again.
‘you got to be kidding me, Lupin. How can you not know that Lucius is Slytherin boy and also as head boy. I never thought wolf had this loss memory’
'for sleepless, the first ingredient is the palm leave, a vcous spell and wait for 3 second then stir to right and left in 17 time. To wake person up, is by mixing the cat hair, leave of lost herbs and a spell of water. Which take 3 stir to right and 10 time repeat the volume of stir to the. left' draco exclaimed his explaning, as the students were jaw drop with the unexpected answer from the malfoy boy. Even the professor look surprise and proud on his face. But only a second before someone seen his real emotion.
The wall infront of him were form as dark blue door with a simbol of leaf attach on it, which is tall as hagrid size.
His mother seem carrying toward the bed as if the boy weight nothing for her. Forgeting that he still a young boy that only had light weight not a grow man who run away from death eater and auror from his back.
'err yeah' draco reply while looking away to hide his burning face, 'gosh why now! my blush is appear? gosh help me merlin and why did-'
‘gosh! Marly… you didn’t just hit your head hard to forget what year to today is’ the person looking amused for weird question.
'draco honey, are you awake?' a lovely sweet voice knocking the red design door cross ahead not far from where he stand.
Hmmm. Hope you wakeup weasley . Draco eyes slowly feel sleepy and close his eyes while he still sitting on the chair beside the weasley boy, ron.
Feeling been stare too hard, made harry in nervous and anxious moment in same time, 'ermm yeah i think?!'
The book were no were found for him. He forget that he had the forbidden mystery book with him that seem lay on the his bed.
‘mione? Are you okay?’ harry ask as he see hermione look uncomfortable while looking around in alert mode.
‘yes! im sure of it, draco!! But it seems like it’s different what I just copy!’ The girl who are friend with the three boys is the name called hermione.
The ritual of the bind spell was indeed complete. As the girl name padma patil was save as the marks slowly to disappear as if it was not there, however, the man name leon or terry was already dead as he says his last breath of a vow word for the two girls, he know.
He barely wasted any time in getting up and running away from the class to the school doors. I ran behind him as fast as I could to be there next to him, while Hagrid called out for everyone to calm down, and Ron, Mione, and Neville tailed us.
"Pansy, you do remember what needs to happen for the curse to break right?" He asks in a resigned manner.
He had been completely mortified at how the boys saw what happened in the morning, so much so that he quietly got up from his bed and locked himself in the bathroom once everyone had used it. No matter what we tried he didn't come out for two days. We were all relieved until we realized he wouldn't say a word or look any of us in the eyes for the rest of the week.  Especially when we all knew the freak accident of all the chandeliers bursting into shards of metal and glass were caused by Draco from his intense nightmare.
Draco nods with a smaller smile and I can feel his nerves come back as he glances to Mione, Ron, and Neville. I could understand his nerves because the spell wasn't really something I was sure would be in the okay with families so light oriented.
It got harder for me the closer we got to the day, I barely slept or felt the need to eat. I could no longer sleep alone because thoughts of Draco disappearing from my life would always try to take over during the darkest times at night. Despite Draco always telling me I should rest and take a break I tried to stay awake, until Draco would curl up around me and I would be lulled to sleep within minutes. It was in those moments with only the fire to keep a soft glowing light and the safety of him around me that I had the urge to tell him.
"How about we stop for tonight? I'll tell you some more on the weekend......... It'll be our last weekend here before we go back."
Everyone agrees loudly with him and that warm feeling returns to me making me smile brightly. Everyone gets this stunned look and I just ignore it as I explain that the bruise is fake, a glamor I put on to make the "fight" more realistic. Everyone looks relieved and accepts my friendship with Blaise much easier after explaining. Hermione immediately asking me everything about glamors and how I can do such complicated magic. Harry just quips ,"Draco's like a genius!" Which makes me ruffle his hair with a smirk while explaining as much as I can throughout breakfast, she just soaks it all up like a sponge while writing notes.
"Oh just sit down and enjoy your date Draco. It's your first one so be sure to tell me all about it after you two are done! I'll leave you two now to get to know one another okay? Oh and Harry, Draco doesn't have a curfew!"
The next day I woke up feeling great.  I was incredibly warm and content at not having to wake up at the crack of dawn to cook food for people I hate. I pulled the nice source of warmth closer to me and sighed happily especially when the source of the warmth reminded me of Draco from the smell. It's then I blink open my eyes and realize why that bundle of warmth smelled of him,
I gasp at the revelation. Not because I was surprised, no, I knew he had to kill someone to make this horcrux. And it seemed from how old he is in the journal he was still in hogwarts when he did it. No, I wasn't surprised at the murder but his confession of it to me. I nodded and continued.
I slip the book into my bag with no one but Ginny knowing and go back to Harry and Ron's side as I catch Harry's questioning gaze.
I smile as I remember the old me smuggling care for magical creatures books from the library and copying them so that I could write notes in it and keep my parents from knowing I had them. At that Hagrid relaxed a bit and I could see he was giving me a chance. Hagrid nodded a yes so Harry and I turn to each other, me with a small smile and Harry grinning and holding his hand in the air in front of me. I look at him questioningly and tilt my head to the side and press my hand against his lightly when he laughs and shakes his head. "It's like this Draco , keep your hand still I'm going to slap it" and a smack sound came from the impact. "It's called a high five, it's what you do when something succeeds or turns in your favor." My mouth goes into an o shape as I nod along, and Harry just links his arm with mine as we follow Hagrid into the bookstore. Harry is about to lick his ice cream when he looks at me and offers some to me. I just tell him I'm alright and to enjoy it. He's still hesitant but as we collect our books he's happily devouring it. He's so thin, he needs to eat more. Before, I used to think he had an eating disorder because he would eat so much at school and was thin. But then I noticed he only came back thin after the summer. So I realized that for some reason his food was restricted during the time he was away from school. I'll have to make sure he gets enough food from now on, he could easily out grow me if he has a good intake of nutrients from now on.
I sighed as I noticed everyone try to ignore my habits but they gave each other glances and I excused myself for some air. They nodded and Harry and Neville began to whisper something to Ron and Hermione as I left. I made it outside and sat on one of my old thinking benches surrounded by pink roses and honeysuckles. I feel someone sit next to me and I turn to see Zabini giving me a comforting smile and swinging an arm around my shoulders.
It's close to the end of summer and I've lost count how many times I've taken my pepper up potions, or how many times Sev has to secretly come patch me up. But I know deep in my gut that this is the last time I'm going to be given a "lesson", since I go to hogwarts in a week. I give a grin once I'm all healed. I'm not bothered by any scars I have littered on my body. They're barely visible thanks to having an actual potions mater to fix me. And this time I didn't have very many to get healed just three gashes and some burns that turned to nothing but soft even pale skin. Almost like nothing happened.
I'm barely aware of my sighs through the amazing feeling, especially when he massages in the balm into my back. And find myself hating the moment he finishes because I loved the slight massage. I turn to face him with a grateful smile.
"Okay, hold up just one minute. I generally know what Draco is thinking but this is like on a whole other level." Blaise said,
Unsurprisingly as soon as I got back I was hounded on wether or not I had just done what they thought I had. I just smiled and ignored their probing questions until Harry caught the snitch fantastically. I was the first one up and running to the common room so we could meet up with Harry. Finally once I was comfortably sitting on the plush armchair the others were practically buzzing with questions that I soothed over with saying I would tell them when Harry got back. Finally I had gotten a few minutes of calm silence. I enjoyed it for the next ten minutes when a freshly washed Harry came running in, and I started explaining what I thought was going on around school and what I had done at the game. Of course in the privacy of a silencing bubble around all of us.
I couldn't maintain my composure even halfway through. I cried and my voice cracked as I spoke and by the end I was holding in my cries but the tears kept flowing. Only a second passed when I felt warmth envelope me and I clung onto Sev's robes like I really was 11 and not 18 years old. He just stroked my hair and held me close, I always loved his hugs because I was the only one to get them, and it meant more affection and meaning was in them.
He just waves goodbye with a thin smile and I didn't have time to even protest before they were both gone.
I grit my teeth at the pain that makes me fall to the ground and watch as Ron desperately tries to hoist me up, and get us to safety as the figure comes for us.
As soon as I enter potions I sit next to Harry and not even a minute later Severus walks through the door his cloak billowing behind him making me smile. Sev starts to go down his list of students and stops at Harry Potter, I could tell he was going to do what he did last time. But he took one glance at me next to him and my pleading eyes that he just sighed and moved on. He explains the basics of potions and tells us we are going to start a pepper up potion next class, and for homework we should research what the potion is and write down everything we come across, as well as when it should be used. The class should have been boring but I couldn't take my eyes off of Sev. I never want to loose him again and I don't plan on it. Once class is over I get called to stay after and the guys just give me bewildering and questioning looks as to why I always get asked to stay. I just shrug and they just say they will wait outside. I walk over to Sev all packed up and he says.
It was either loose all resources to live as well as your parents, if your lucky enough to escape death when you refuse the mark, or take the role of being a death eater and live to see another day. Child or not, those are the choices children like Blaise and I are dealt. And I will not let my feelings get in the way of my mission.
"Hey guys I'm going to go take care of something and then go have some tea with Severus. So I'll see you in the great hall for lunch yeah?"
It was silent for a minute with Neville and Ron staring at me with dropped jaws. It had Harry snickering this time and I just gave him a fond smile before continuing.
Harry smiles affectionately at me and I find myself returning the look. Ron groans at us and Neville laughs much to my confusion.
As I step out into the sitting room once more I hear a bunch of bustling in the kitchen and bravely open it to confront my host. Only to see everything moving on its own. I stand there for a few moments in shock at seeing magic in front of my eyes that wasn't meant to kill me. The only magic I knew of was the kind battlefield witches and wizards used to attack their opponents. I'd never seen it be used for domestic uses as there were no born witches and wizards in this kingdom. Only a few people here had enough magic to help in battles and so I couldn't help but stare in awe at the kitchen bustling like no tomorrow.
We both take off into the air ignoring Hermione's indignant shouts of protest and Ron making bets with the other Gryffindors. Harry and I are racing against one another and passing the ball in between us when I throw it and subtly, wandlessly, cast a charm to make it zoom past Harry with enough force to keep it going for at least a mile. Making Harry do exactly what I wanted. He flew fast and smoothly like second nature and caught it beautifully.
That last part was mumbled but I understood. "Of course I'll help you, I think this will be quite fun, sort of like a mini makeover. What do you think, are you up for it? We can try a de-frizz
I give him a grin and a comforting embrace before telling him that we would meet up again at the secret base in two days to catch up, despite our normal hang out being later in the week. He nodded and gave me a parting hug with a thank you before leaving to his common room of snakes. I felt myself become proud of helping a close friend when they needed me and made my way to my house common room in wait of news from Siren. The others found me there soon after and we all spoke to each other in whispers about what happened, and our class assignments, much to Rons distress.
Once it's done I nearly cry again just at the sight of the shower included. I tear off my tattered clothes and gratefully grab the very subtle mint shampoo, conditioner, and soap before stepping into the warm spray. I sigh out in pleasure and wash off the grime on my skin. Once I'm out freshly washed and donning warm sleep ware and fuzzy socks curtesy of my mystery gifter, I take in the beautiful tent. The inside is filled with red and gold tapestries everywhere giving me warmth and comfort. The armchairs soft and comfortable looking near the crackling fire place. I feel my heart thump in glee and gratitude as I slip into the cot that was added inside. I hum an old tune relishing the taste of spearmint from the old fashioned toothpaste. The blanket from earlier draped over me and for once I fall asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow. Thank you, D.
"don't worry you can stay for as long as you need. There is a change of clothes for you to get warm and a door on your left that is a bathroom."
"Don't cry, Harry....thanks to you I got to experience so many wonderful things. I couldn't have-ahh- been happier in these last few months without you. You gave me hope-hah-so please. Be happy and don't cry for my sake. Just promise me one thing?"
So he takes out the candle and lights it up before bringing the crystal out and setting it in between us. We lay down side by side leaving space for only the crystal and begin to calmly relax, almost to the point I was going to be lulled to sleep. It was soothing and a nice warm feeling surrounded me and the bond of Draco inside of me.
Once we arrive at the hospital wing I just sit down on one of the beds as Harry goes over to Madam Pomfrey's office with a skip in his step, only to bring her over. She glances at me and though I can see  how polite she's being, she has a look of disdain in her eyes like she always did.
He frowned at the information and then proceeded to ask for them much to the witch's displeasure. She just plastered on a fake smile and said of course to Harry without so much as an extra glance my way, and gave him the potions with a slightly strained smile. He thanks her while she just nods.
"Alright mister 'I can't help but flirt with every cute person I meet', Harry is off limits." I say pointing at him.
Anything would look wonderful with his green eyes I'm sure. I'm about to turn again when I see a shadow pass over the sky above the shed and I jump to attention when an owl comes, fluttering his fluffy wings right into my arms. He seems to be holding a pretty large package that now that I look closely at, seems to be shrunken. Merlin, it must be huge then. The owl trills and when I untie him of the burden he's been carrying he burrows into my neck. I smile and get joy from the simple action of just being given affection.
I tie the letter and the shrunken basket to the newly grown owl that hatched this year who I now own as a personal owl, Aristotle. This was his first delivery and he was excited from the way he rubbed against my cheek and puffed his chest out. I affectionately stroked his honey brown feathers mottled with random white and gave his wing a kiss. After that he shot off after I told him to find Harry Potter on a street called Pickett and that it was muggle, not really knowing where exactly he lived. But Aristotle apparently understood so I watched as my Saw-Whet owl flew off. Now all I had left to do was unshrink my supplies and read my cookbooks. I decided that after I knew more on cooking I would start writing everything I knew about the future and remember as much as possible.
I put on some nice soft socks that are designer much to my amusement, along with some plain White House slippers that are probably super expensive knowing Draco. I made sure to take care of all my things almost to the point of thinking I was wearing hundreds of dollars worth of clothes, and honestly I very well might be. I go to grab a soft pine green knitted jumper, folded neatly, on top of my trunk when a pop goes off again. I give a start and turn around quickly, to watch as Draco stumbles from the action of being Apparated and on the fast track to falling on his face.
Not to mention the dozens of expensive socks and underwear that I know he isn't going to pull out. He just sits there sniffling and I settle next to him and offer him my shoulder. He automatically rushes into my arms and I feel the warm drops of liquid fall from his eyes onto my skin through my clothes as he trembles softly in my hold. I smile and run a hand through his hair to give him comfort while the others smile at us. They all come rushing and we end up piling all together in a group hug making us laugh a bit. We all separate and they all happily thank me for their presents. I just take it in stride and fiddle with the remaining package until we slowly talk ourselves to tiredness.
I winked at them and pointed my wand at Lucius sending a tripping hex his way, making him fall on his face in the most undignified way. With that Hagrid was finally able to pick Lucius up and separate the fight with Molly holding Arthur back as well. They looked at me surprised while Harry laughed and put his arm around my shoulder.
My hands tremble behind my back and all I can hear is the blood curdling screams echoing in the corridors.
"don't mourn for me..... only remember our happy moments......I will always be grateful that you came into my life until my last breath."
It isn't long until Mione is whisking Ron, Neville, and I to the library for some studying and finishing homework. I stay for a good hour helping the others since I always finish my work in class or in the early hours of the morning after waking up drenched in my own sweat.
He runs out of the room and seconds later before I can even put together a sentence Sev is in the room with an anxious Harry trailing behind him. Sev sighs and hauls me up by my good shoulder making me stumble and half glare at him as I mumble about being man handled.
Like, say one person wants to marry someone then it wouldn't get in the way of that marriage. It is known to make friendships stronger because you connect better with each other. It's been known that a handful of Auror's use it when they have been partners for a long time. Mostly during the time of the first Wizarding war so partners knew where the other was in battle and if they needed help.
It's been around two months now since I've lost my voice and I'm already making a lot of progress on my anxiety levels. I can go around eight hours without the amulet on before I start to look over my shoulder and whip out my wand at any sudden movement. I can tell that the others are there to fully support me when they give me proud smiles every time I extend the time without wearing the jewelry. Classes so far have been a rollercoaster that's for sure.
The next thing I know I'm on my bed, the curtains closed, and I'm staring at the top of the canopy, no thoughts in mind.
I set the tray down on Hermione's vanity. Well it should be her own vanity but it looks like she hasn't set anything out or doesn't have anything for it. So I transfigure the boring simple mirror that is identical to the other girls vanities and make it a large heart shape with a glowing light that turns on and off with a simple tap of your wand. The mirror I outlined with glittering gold and blue butterflies that roam around the mirror when it isn't in use, as well as have the wood polished and shinning.
We both turn and as soon as Harry sees him his smile gets smaller. I ruffle his hair and wink at Blaise because he seemed to hesitate for a second on whether or not he should stay. After my gesture though Blaise put on an easy charming smile and held out his hand for Harry.
He tilts his head to the side in confusion. Sliding his gaze to Harry who is now trying to desperately communicate with me.
And it set me apart from the other students even more. Because form their point of view I was being dramatic and flaunting my families influence to get care.
I blink at that and think. "In my time line you didn't but that could be because Black was never pardoned. I promise I'll do my best in making sure he's your legal guardian this time."
And I just buried my face into his fluffy white hair trying to memorize every single little detail of him in my mind again before I made the walk back to the castle. I noticed the forest was no longer covered in snow and instead was flourishing with all types of flowers and had a wide clear path all the way to the castle. My heart finally eased, the curse is gone. I had a wide grin on my face when seeing Draco peek up at me with a heart melting blush staining his cheeks.
"Does this mean you can tell us some things that happen in the future?" Asked Ron, and I shook my head.
He reluctantly lets go and I quickly unshrink sirens tank and place it on Harry's desk for the time being before grabbing my silk pajama set. I go to the left side of my bed where no one can see me and change hurriedly, faintly touching my bandages. I get back into bed and spell my mouth clean before shuffling under the covers and letting Harry cuddle into me. I run my fingers through his hair and he drifts softly to sleep.
It isn't long before I'm in the shower. Hot steaming water rushing down my slight body. I missed the developed muscles my sixteen year old body had and I knew wishing for a them was futile until at least third year. Even then I had been more willowy and lean than almost every single male. I had resigned myself to being the more delicate type in fifth year when everyone else had the typical muscle physique men were known for.
I was close now and I've narrowed it down to four very old somewhat Archaic Latin rituals. Archaic in the sense that its very old and very dangerous, something only pure bloods and some ministry sections would even find out what they were.
Ron, because he never has anything just for him. Everything has always been passed down to him. He's excited but afraid that he wouldn't be able to give me something in return.
I didn't know when it happened but my eyes became watery and I knew from my heart rate I needed to get out of there fast. I quickly excused myself rushing out of the hall, unable to stop until I got to the room of requirement.
I grab my things and head for the shower. It seems that this will be my daily routine. But as I go back into the dorm to drop off my stuff I hear noise from two beds. I pause for a moment but continue to tie my shoes and run my brush through my damp hair. I quietly leave and head down to the kitchens after taking a pepper up potion from the bag.
I'm at the top of the astronomy tower waiting for about 20 minutes when I hear footsteps. I see Zabini looking nervous and relief floods his face as he sees me.
and Harry who is blushing just says, "Just ignore them. They're being weird. I'm just glad your back."
He just smiles fondly at me "Draco nothing would make me stop caring about you". I just swallow a lump and with a slightly wavering voice I tell him everything.
"Hey, you alright? I couldn't help but notice how uncomfortable you looked, and you practically left ten minutes into breakfast." I lean into him and am thankful everyone's in the great hall.
His face betrays nothing but I can feel a bit of sadness from him and it makes me confused as to why, but he just goes back to listening to the others. Oh god I think I just messed up.
I enter the common room and see Mione sitting there waiting for me by the looks of it. She comes over and smiles as I put on a charming smile with a bow. "My fair lady, do you know if the others have awaken from their slumber?"
Tom the owner of the Leaky cauldron would apparently be keeping an eye on me for now and I honestly didn't care. I was given a room key and quickly wrote a letter to Draco telling him what happened. I asked for Dobby since Draco told me to ask for him in emergency situations, and I thought this sudden change could be counted as an emergency. Really, I just wanted to see if I could see him sooner but those were details.
"You dork, no one would be dumb enough to not love you. Your worth so much and I wish you knew that. I wish your parents didn't make you feel like you weren't enough."
And for a bone chilling moment I think I'm going to be turned into a wolf before a crucio is aimed at the human wolf. Snape looks down at Greyback with disgust and I get up quickly, standing next to him.
I'm walking down a corridor when I spot a door and feel myself inching closer automatically without thought. I go through it and see a giant mirror in an abandoned room. I raise my eyebrows at such a sight before carefully going up to the ornate mirror. There are words at the top that I can't really understand the meaning of, but it doesn't stop me from standing right in front.
"Draco I'm sure you are aware of what the consequences of being sorted into Gryffindor will be. Are you positive you want to stay there? I could get you resorted."
"Oh thank you so much Draco really, it means a lot to me and yes! Yes please, I can't wait for everyone to see how it'll turn out."
Blaise could handle it because he is like me in so many ways. Already a witness to the harshness of our parents expectations and punishments. Though mine is more extreme it doesn't mean his experiences were any less painful for him. So as I look into Harry's still soft face and trusting eyes I can't bring myself to take that all away in one day. To burden him with things no eleven year old should have to deal with. So I decide to just tell him what he needs to know.
I feel his hand softly card through my snowy hair and I lean into the touch of affection subconsciously with a faint smile.
Your wish has been granted. You have been given a chance at redemption and to save those close but at the price of something dear to you. Love is a powerful motivator but it can also be someone's greatest downfall.
”.......When the war was in full swing, Malfoy Manor was the official base and I was able to hear things constantly. The death eaters would constantly spit at his name so I know that there is no way he was actually the one to betray your parents.I just know he was framed."
I finish and excuse my self to my room. As soon as I get there I double check my trunk to make sure I really haven't forgotten anything. The books I bought and the ones IB gave me are hidden in one of the expanding compartments that are locked with a password so those are safe. Everything else is alright and nothing is missing so I take a breath and apparate to the kitchen. I was surprised when I came back in time and my magical core wasn't weak, but I guess it makes sense that since I had already grown and developed my magic, it would be odd for it to shrink. So I didn't question it and enjoyed my magical power, it would definitely come in handy with Harry, he's always attracting danger. The guys all jump at my appearance and begin talking about how much of a prodigy I am because I'm a natural and so magically strong already, but I just deny it and compliment them on how delicious breakfast was. The kitchen is filled with laughter and cheers for my first year at Hogwarts as I pipe the filling and dip them in some melted chocolate. Soon they're all cooled and I pack the food in glass containers taking a couple napkins and five forks just in case there's more than just Harry, Ron and I in the carriage ride. I shrink everything into my pockets and say my goodbyes to all of them since its time for me to leave. So with tearful hugs and several good lucks I get my trunk and meet my father and mother at the fire place.
She smirks and ruffles my hair, "Sure kid, go ahead and open it, I'm ready. He isn't getting away from me."
I go sit on the edge of the bed when I remember I have no shirt on. I put my jumper on quickly and blush a bit at the thought of him seeing me like that.
I yell out to him and he turns his gaze to me. His features shift from a triumphant smirk to a smile, that I shockingly realize is affectionate.
Once I'm in the common room everyone came up to me and instead of answering questions, I took out the cookies and put warming charms on them so they would be gooey. I held them out and everyone made the mutual decision to eat first then ask questions. As they munched I went ahead and explained he was just giving me some basic balms for bruises and an antiseptic since he thought I was just incredibly clumsy. Everyone was nodding with understanding and then I looked at Hermione with a smirk. I held up the two bottles with a slight wince and her eyes widened as she smiled happily.
"You reopened the wounds so please don't move while I cast a sealing spell. This will scar now since its been reopened, so do be careful with it. It's delicate enough as it is."
I look into the mirror, my mind subconsciously flashes back to a similar scene. Harry is staring right back at me just like that time, but it's not sixth year, I’m 11. I tug my sleeve down and turn around to face him with a tight smile to at least show I'm trying to be alright. His eyes are sad but he stays silent as we make our way out together only to stop before we're going to leave. He softly grabs my arm and I make a sound of protest. But he just gently holds my arm and lifts the sleeve.
I hear yelling......... it's, Harry's voice and someone I don't recognize. Oh, I must be in the chamber of secrets then, I think as I look around.
I say, "why thank you. It's near impossible to break I'm certain, and as a precaution I have the only key to open it."
I stay up looking to the roof of my canopy berating myself on forgetting the silencing spell, until my curtains move a bit. And in pops the Harry’s wild raven curls. He sees I'm awake and climbs onto the bed.
All while carding my fingers soothingly through his hair. He  gradually became calm after a while and I held him affectionately until he pulled away first.
“Draco! Are you okay?! Please tell me you are! Draco! Agh, just hold on okay?! I’ll get us both out of here and away from him!”
He smirked and came over next to me to see what I was doing. "Yeah I had a bad dream and decided to come and get those lessons you were so excited to teach me. It's like five in the morning Draco, at what time did you get here?"
I couldn't bare to see him fall to pieces. So despite my gathering tears I continue to try and put some sense in that genius head of his.
"I had pure blood lessons over the summer, now if you'll excuse me I will be leaving now. Thank you for your help."
I've run out of tears but somehow my eyes become misty as I see the sun rise above the horizon knowing that it marks the day my mother is given the kiss. At sunset tonight is when the act will be done. Everything I did, all the pain and frustration, was worthless if she's gone. So with that sun now shining I enter the manor that should have been the place I could call home. Everything here is cold. Nothing was ever inviting or happy here, only mother, that's what made me come back every holiday. What brought light to my childhood. Now after everything it went from cold to being drenched in darkness, the stench of dark magic ingrained so deep I felt it would never come out.
"Harry you are very special to me, and Blaise is also special to me. For a different reason, but he is. Harry, it's okay if you don't realize I need some help because Blaise is the one who knows when I do. Blaise and I, we are like brothers. We have lived very similar lives and he understands how I feel because he knows how it feels and the signs."
Harry is smiling like a fool and I smile in victory. Now Harry can live with Sirius instead of his Aunts and uncles. My gaze goes to the professors table and I see how Remus' face changes into desperation and longing. I smile softly knowing what he must be feeling. His eyes lift from the newspaper and catch my eyes. His gaze turns sharp and I look away before swiftly making my way out of the great hall. I decide to skip breakfast and make my way to the quidditch pitch.
I just chuckled at that and plopped him down carefully on the bed sitting up. He held his hand out and I was extremely confused and had a small thought that he wanted to hold my hand. So I go to place my hand on his when my brush and a smaller towel zoom into his hand. I practically died of mortification, and was extremely glad that he hadn’t seen my actions. And even with my embarrassment my eyes widen at the realization he just did nonverbal magic, all while he seems to have not noticed how out of the ordinary his skill with magic was.
The chess game was definitely not my area but thankfully it was Ron's. So as he made the pieces move and took advice from Draco at one point we were able to make it through in no time without casualties. Ron grinned and asked Draco for a match after we got out of this whole mess, resulting with a definite yes from the blonde.  As we made our way into the next place we found that the troll was already knocked out and Draco pulled out his wand with narrowed eyes.
I yell to the guys to go on ahead and I'll catch up, but when Crabb and Goyle tried to follow I harden my face to my ice prince mask and say, "stay here and don't follow us". Everyone is completely stunned at my sudden change that I use it to get Blaise and I away.
But even so all I felt was relief from seeing him, and leant into the soft caress he gave me when smoothing my hair away from my face. His reassured whispers reached my slightly dazed mind in between whatever diagnostic spells he cast. He cleaned me up, having to remove my trousers as well due to some injuries on my thighs. Next he gave me anti-biotic potions, muscle relaxers for the crucio effects, and painkiller tinctures before starting to heal my wounds.
And instead of trying again I watch helplessly as he tackles Blaise to the ground. It would have been the best save I've ever seen if only the claw had been a little slower, because it came thrashing down on the white haired blonde. I felt the air leave my lungs as I rushed forward to Draco, my emotions going haywire at how he was clutching his face. His sound of anguish made my throat tighten like I was going to cry or suffocate, from how pained it echoed in the air.
"As a child I grew up in an orphanage. A terrible abusive place that hated anything with magic. So when I was accepted to hogwarts I felt free. But then the war wreaking havoc in the muggle world happened. I desperately tried to convince the headmaster to protect the muggle born wizards in risk of dying from the war when school was out of session, but he refused. He denied all of us a safe place and left us to hope we wouldn't die from the bombs over our heads. So in my desperation I did this."
Classes pass with ease, especially Sev's and McGonagals classes due to being 'an outstanding student'. Though I think the dessert had played a big part of that. I even snuck two cookies to Sev all while seeing Blaise trying to contain a smile. Sev decided to partner us with Slytherin students and luckily Blaise was assigned my partner. We had a brilliant time making snarky comments to each other and due to my advanced skills in potions we were the first ones done.
I looked down at my empty dinner plate. The edges dipped in gold and the center delicately painted with elegant silver roses and thought back to the plain wooden plates back at my own house. Everything was truly magnificent in this palace, from the painted ceilings to the carved silverware. With every look I take all I can see are priceless items that I have no doubt would belong in a kings home, and yet despite all these jewels and precious metals gleaming all around me, nothing could have been more breathtaking than the white dragon paused in the door way. It wasn't large by any means more like the size of a horse, which was uncommon with magical animals. Normally they were as big as a few houses put together, ready and fully capable of tearing apart an average village, but this one was so small in comparison.
Maybe I could convince him to ride with me at hogwarts after taking an energy potion? I nod at that and boldly take his hand in mine while leading the way down to the ice cream parlor. He laughs and quickly follows my lead, which ends in us eating melting ice cream cones and him helping me with any questions on my homework, as he read something way too advanced.
Despite my hazed thoughts I was able to send Harry my message so he wouldn't be in such a panicked state.
I hug him tightly and I feel his hand come down to smooth my crazy curls in a soothing manner. The others look at the scene with wide eyes and soft smiles. Well Mione and Neville had smiles, Ron was just gobsmacked at what was happening.
I feel my shock before turning to Tom's fading figure. He looks scared and It tears at my heart because I can remember my own face looking like his.
I saw Hermione looking upset but trying not to show it. So I put on my ice prince mask and stared at the two girls. They became so unsettled they started squirming. I made sure to make my face look as cold as possible and narrowed my eyes, walking slowly and deliberately towards them. I truly took on the Slytherin prince persona to the point you could practically see a crown perched delicately on my head. They were trembling by the time I was in front of them making me smirk.
“-Okay Nev hasn't actually said anything about this at all.... But they all miss you! I miss you. So please tell me what's wrong! I'll help you. I promise! So come back."
Once we all get back to Hogwarts we race over to our secret hide out. There we meet Blaise and play games while eating the candy we bought in Hogsmead when I ask Draco to meet me in the next room. He furrows his brows in question and his feelings are jumbled in my chest despite it only being a faint echo, which worried me somewhat. I just tell the others I need to talk to him in private and they all look at me with a specific look and I shrug in a manner as if to say, maybe?
I have tears running down my face but Blaise just keeps holding me and I thank him. "Don't thank me Draco, thank you for coming back. Thank you for coming to help us and.........for saving me. Don't think I haven't figured out why your helping me, I have a feeling I would have ended up just like you. Lost and forced to do things that would tear me apart. And you could have left me and let me go down that dark path but you didn't. You saved me. And I swear we are in this together no matter what."
I think I'll make mini pecan and pumpkin pies, and tomato, basil, mozzarella and pesto panini's for tomorrows train ride. Yes, that sounds good. Can't turn in a dangerous criminal over to the ministry on an empty stomach!
"I just wanted to know why you always get so nervous when we're in the great hall. You barely eat anything and it's not healthy, and this morning I went to follow you.......... But you were with Zabini, and I don't know why but I didn't like it. I wanted to be the one to help but Zabini noticed it before me and I felt like a horrible friend. I didn't realize sooner or get to you fast enough."
I could feel myself being awakened by delicate footsteps I would know anywhere. It was Draco and I knew that he had gone and done what he wanted to despite my and everyone else's worries. I frown and sit up when all I see is him literally falling into his bed and not moving one inch after. I nervously get up as quiet as I can and make my way over to his bed filled with concern. He never showed just how tired he was to anyone and it made me feel a bit sad to know it was most likely how he was raised and his experiences that made him this way. He was always ready to help others but never himself.
I see the glint of his sword and I don't even hesitate in shooting the weapon in my hands. But its too late even with the arrow now sticking out from Cedrics chest, his sword is buried into Draco's underbelly to the hilt.
I laugh and say, "I bake when I need to calm down or forget. Normally it's after I wake up from....night terrors. It just helps, I've been doing this since the summer before Hogwarts and it really does help. I normally wake up screaming at four in the morning so I do this instead of staying and torturing myself thinking about the dreams, or memories."
I flood my brain with all of the problems Harry had faced due to Dumbledoor not telling him things. Sirius Black tearing up the fat lady's portrait trying to get to Harry. While Harry himself becomes paranoid of being hunted down by two people at once. Harry being dragged into competing in the Triwizard tournament, Sirius dying and Harry looking absolutely depressed, Umbridge terrorizing students, Harry cursing me with sectumsepra, and Harry going into the forest willingly after the whole school is told they will be spared if they give him up.
He sucks in a breath, "did he curse you? It looks like a stinging and bruising curse. It's made the skin very irritated and I'll need to use a soothing balm for this one as well. Oh Draco"
I nod to myself assured that Harry will still have another hour of practice, so I rise from my chair.
"Yes, He's a Malfoy so what? He's very special to me and I'm not going to let you give in to any prejudiced thoughts you may have of him because of his last name."
But the prince was still naive and hopeful in matters of the heart. He wanted to be in love and could not marry a stranger for the sake of his parents wishes for an heir. He refused the princesses hand in marriage and it sent her in a crazed bout of madness. She placed a powerful dark curse on not only the prince and his parents but his entire kingdom. The kingdom forgot their just and kind rulers now hidden by a magical, life threatening, forest. The king and queen died of terrible sickness and the prince was turned into a monster. His once pale skin became white scales, wide silver doe eyes now angular and reptilian like, his delicate and small body no longer like a humans. He was now a dragon. He spent months curled up in solitude reverently wishing this was all just a nightmare, only barely surviving with the encouragement of his bubbly servants and boisterous friend, Pansy. All those in the castle where turned into living inanimate objects, much to the horror of Pansy who was obsessed with fashion and turned into a candelabra. The prince mourned for his parents, for his people, and any wishes of living happily with a special person. For who could learn to love a beast?
I feel myself wanting to pass out from the pain so badly and I almost doze off when the sharp crack of apparation practically vibrates in the air from the urgency of it. I flinch unconsciously from it and I'm immediately being soothed by my own godfather. It's unlike anything I've ever seen. He looks incredibly worried and his eyes hold a shine of what I could almost call desperation. I hadn't known I looked quite so bad.
I whispered. Blaise just pulls me closer and after a while breaks the silence. "Could I join you sometime? I might not get night terrors but I do get nightmares often. Is it okay for me to be there?"
I just thank him and after giving myself one more moment of reprieve, I take a deep breath and face Harry full on. He sits up a bit straighter knowing that whats going to happen is important in some way. I look him straight in his emerald eyes, his soft glowing green eyes, and can't bring myself to tell him everything. Harry deserves to keep that child like joy he seems to be emanating every time he casts a spell. To do magic because he loves it, not because he needs to fight for his life.
Once the dog was done eating he nuzzled into Draco and then did the same to me. I didn't want to leave him now that he was so happy with company, so I looked imploringly at Draco who just smirked at the look.
"So Voldemort made these things called horcruxes, they are objects with a piece of the persons soul in them. So that If the person were to die they could always be brought back to life."
I pause and explain. "Well the key isn't really physical. It's a sequence of runes and Arithmancy that when put in the right order unlocks it. Would it be too much trouble if I opened the cage? I'd rather not give away the code."
Sev's breathing is a tad bit off its normal speed but I can pinpoint the exact moment he comes to accept the possibility of certain things needing to happen, even if I am to experience a life threatening outcome. I put my hand on his forearm in comfort and he gives me a sad smile.
"Draco, I find myself wanting to confide in you on a certain matter, yet I'm afraid of what your reaction to it will be."
Why couldn't the world just be at peace? Why did life always chase someone to be destined for something, good or bad? To end up good or bad? Dead or alive? I don't know, but the only thing I did know at the moment was that I didn't want to let go of the one comfort I had the opportunity to experience. So I held the time-traveler to my chest the rest of the night seeking comfort from his warmth in a way I never had before.
He agrees readily and gives me a beaming smile. As he's about to pay I just tell madam Malkin to put it on my tab as well and she nods and does just that. Harry tries to reason with me that he can pay for it but I just grab his arm gently and pull him out of the store with a small smile on my face. As we get outside we come face to face with Hagrid who's holding two ice cream cones. He hands Harry a cone and Hagrid seems to eat his in three bites. Harry looks at me then Hagrid , "hey Hagrid, um I made a friend is it okay if he joins us for the rest of our shopping?" Hagrid looks at me with suspicion when he recognizes who I am so I decide that I need to earn his trust like how I will need to for everyone else. I stick my hand out, "hello Hagrid it's nice to meet you, I'm Draco. If I'm not mistaken you teach care for magical creatures right? I can't wait it's one of my favorite subjects, but don't tell anyone it's a secret."
I was breathing raggedly, surprisingly in the middle of the kitchen and not in my bed. My eyes screwed up tight as I gave a scratchy yell in frustration of my thoughts. My mind filled with self deprecating thoughts and horrifying scenes. It was too much pressure to keep inside and I'd finally snapped.
"Of course I do. And I think its completely possible! So what if your a dragon at the moment, you deserve to find love Draco! I can't .... I don't want my last moments of life to be filled with you being alone and not having been able to love someone. Ever since we were kids I made a promise to help you find someone who makes you happy, and I think Harry is the one. Please just try Draco."
He intertwined our fingers and I let him. Just this once I tell myself. Just once. And so I follow his lead and I pass the day in a blur of lectures and trying to stave off the feeling of needing to scratch at my fore arm.
I wiped my brow clean and placed a cloaking charm on it to hide all of the carving and gave a nice long sigh. I had really needed to finish this today since tomorrow is the big day and it made me grateful on how fast I recovered from the last session. I put the cage in my packed trunk and decide to go down to the kitchens and start baking some food for today and tomorrow.
She started to get excited and super happy the more I spoke and we were both chatting about what we should try first. When we smelled something unpleasant making us cover our noses.
There were only a few nights he didn't wake up screaming and they were when I was keeping him company. Even then, in first year after his incident with everyone finding out about him night terrors he would still wake up horribly distressed, despite me staying with him multiple times.
I knew I should sleep but I couldn't bring myself to do it, as my mind became more and more defenseless. The older I get the more I start reverting to my war mindset, and I'm afraid. But I just breath in and calmly make my way down to make some sausage rolls from scratch. I always liked to indulge in some every once in a while and now seemed like a good time as any to do so.
I crack my eyes open with all my strength and say his name out loud, granting me the vision of worried emerald eyes and furrowed brows before sleeping.
"Oh! I think you just had a run in with the mirror of Erised, it shows you your most deepest desire."
D:[ yeah, I'll tell you once we get to class. I doubt were going to learn anything substantial in history of magic today anyways.]
And he sighs in defeat before running out of there. My heart feels like its shattering at that and against my better judgement, I let a few tears slip before pulling myself together and going to the room of requirement. I check up on the werewolf potion and according to both my own and Tom's predictions it does turn a milky white color once I add in the lemon grass. I note it down and wait for it to settle for three hours before being able to sir it in a star like pattern. In the mean time I make even more progress on moving the shard of Voldemort's soul from Harry with nothing but the sound of my own breath as company.
Blaise stares at my eyes and after a second just mutters, "shit man. Okay , okay so why are you here to help? What goes wrong?"
He pulls away slightly and before I can say more he kisses my lips. I feel my breath get knocked out from my chest but kiss back all the same. He pulls away with a grin.
He looked at me with a resolve so strong and not a single ounce of compromise in his eyes, that I just nodded.
The whole time I was snickering and the professors were all gobsmacked at how the events unfolded. They were clearly expecting to tell Harry to hide his gift and tell him how it was his responsibility as "Harry Potter" to be what the people wanted him to be.
So as I'm walking to the room of requirement then suddenly gripped and dragged to an abandoned classroom, I immediately react. An elbow to the gut and wand raised to the persons face only to see Harry hunched over coughing. I gasp and rush over despite successfully staying away from him so far.
And as he said that Mione and Ron came over with the rest of the weasley's, as Neville popped in and his grandmother left without a word. I frowned at that but Neville didn't seem bothered much by it and happily made his way over. Once everyone was there I began the plan.
"From what I remember you were supposed to break into Hogwarts to get to Harry but you didn't succeed the first time since the fat lady didn't let you into the common room during dinner. Harry was asleep and everyone else was eating, but as I said you didn't succeed. All I know is after that Sirius was spotted flying away from Hogwarts on the back of a thestral when Pettigrew escaped capture. I literally have no idea how Pettigrew got in the school at all or where this thestral escape plan came from but that's all I know. Also, that Harry had a black dog by the end of the year. I didn't know the dog was you though."
I'm torn from my pleasant dreams suddenly and I can't tell why from how silent it is before I feel a shard of dread curl up in my chest and I immediately know why. I make my way to Draco's bed and slide inside the curtains, light up an orb with my wand and see him thrashing in the sheets. I lay a hand on his chest and face while calmly telling him everything's okay, and that I'm here. He begins to slow down his movements until he is laying there peacefully mouthing silent words.
Moments later we're all in the common room trying to calm down from the encounter. It's at this time Draco really throws himself into research and my worry for his health becomes high.
I clench my teeth at having to walk by another group of girls openly staring at me. I gave up being cheery and polite to them a long time ago after years of them only wanting to shag a war hero. It all started when I dated a girl named Cho Chang after the war was over. As we shared a kiss behind one of the taverns I overheard her group of friends talking loudly about wether or not she had already won the race of sleeping with me. Lets just say that the kiss ended abruptly and was filled with shame and guilt on her end before I left, trust broken. After that incident I have had countless men and women offer to spend the night with me as if it was the most casual thing to ask in the middle of grocery shopping. I quickly closed myself off to the majority of the villagers and only spent time with my family. The Weasley family took me in when I was a child after my parents died only a summer after I was born, and I saw all of them as my real family despite still having Potter as my surname. Molly and Arthur were my mum and dad, and William, Charlie, Percy, Fred, George, Ron, and Ginny were my siblings.
I bite my lip and give a relieved sigh at being able to know myself better despite being so young. Damn 11 and I'm already going through puppy love. I chuckle at the situation and nod my head as I smile brightly at those in the reflection. I step back from the mirror and can barely hold myself back from running to the kitchens to find my newly appointed crush. I take one last glance at the writing carved into the mirrors frame and the faces of my parents before scampering off to tell Draco my newest find. With parting waves I'm now rushing under my invisibility cloak in the empty halls minutes away from seeing silver hair with flour in it.
Play the part and live with money and opportunity, or try to be my own person and get scorned by both my family and society. Back then I was afraid. I was a child who just wanted to see another day without pain. I didn't want to get hurt or die by my father's wand, or from being in the elements alone fending for myself.
I decided to sit while I waited for Pansy to come back, hopefully with the mysterious mansion owner. I felt almost a bit ridiculous at how badly I wanted to help a man I felt I already knew, but hadn't even met yet. But the way Pansy spoke to me about him, made it seem like I did know the man. I could feel the pain that seemed to drown him.... and deep down I thought we weren't all that different. I too wanted to find love. Maybe...... we could both find what we needed in each other. I know that even now I would do anything to help those cursed here become humans again, and maybe I could finally just be seen as Harry. Not war hero Harry Potter.
My neat cursive fills the small scroll with only soft breathing and faint scratching sounds to accompany it. The dark blue sky is filled with bright twinkling stars, and I watch Aristotle fly off among them to deliver the special parcel. Before sneaking back into the dorm and swiftly get into bed with silencing spells on my lips. I stay awake Wondering just what would happen on the professors end in a few minutes with a smile on my face. I drift off hoping for only good emotions on his part.
But.....this isn't just any thirteen year old. This is Harry, and a Malfoy who time traveled back in time to help him.
I'm not sure if I'm stepping over a line here and if I am I'm sorry. I'm just happy that I finally have a real friend, and I want to make sure you are okay. Please don't feel embarrassed or feel like I'm pitying you in any way, I just want to help. I know that you might not want help and you might get upset or angry with me because of this, but the most important thing to me is that you are happy and healthy. I am the type of person who will do anything to keep those I care about safe and you are now one of those so I will not give up on you ever. So please work with me on this and if you really can't bring yourself to eat the food I make without guilt, then I promise to go to you when I feel I need to or want help. I know you don't get enough food, I don't exactly know why but I don't need to, unless you want to tell me one day. So please eat the food that gets placed in the basket. It's charmed to be connected to a basket in my house so whatever I put in will be sent to yours once I close the basket. Keep the basket and when your done put the empty dishes in and close the top so it will transport them to me. When something arrives the it will make a soft ding so be on the lookout for that.
I then promise myself to keep a distance between us knowing I could easily change Harry in ways that could cause horrible disasters. And with that Sev tells me how I should take care of my wound for the next couple of days. I listen diligently and slowly part from Harry in a way he doesn't notice. That doesn't mean Sev didn't take notice and immediately knew why, by the thin line his lips made.
As soon as I get out of the classroom the group ask me why I was asked to stay for transfiguration and potions. So I explained about being an intern for McGonagall and that Snape is my godfather so he wants to meet up later for tea. Everyone was surprised except Harry since he already knew, and Hermione was busy asking about what being an intern would entail. So as everyone was busy eating lunch I was too much on edge from all the noise to really eat so I just nibbled on some apple slices and strawberries.
She blushes at the compliment as I take out the eclairs and she picks one, munching on it with pink cheeks. It makes me smile at how innocent and young she is. Harry appears and he looks happy to see me when his face flickers to something I can't put my finger on, but it's gone too fast. He comes over but instead of standing next to Hermione he stands next to me. Practically pressed against my side. He looks up at me with puppy eyes before settling his gaze at my eclairs.
Sirius is just looking at Draco like he lost his mind because of all of his hand motions. And to be honest hearing it like this did sound insane. But I knew Draco and I had experience of how he pieced together events. I knew him as a person and how hard this was for him, so I could find the amusement and adorableness in his hand waving and flushed cheeks. So all I did was laugh at Sirius' face and soon we were all laughing.
"Petter Pettigrew, an illegal animagus. He's been hiding with the weasleys for the past seven years give or take, and we are sure he has framed Sirius Black for his own crimes."
I distract myself with the pastry and try to hold the memories at back of my mind. But it's becoming harder and I feel like I need to get out, I'm starting to panic, green and red curses are flying, aunt Bella's laughter rings in my ears and bloodcurdling screams echo in my mind. Out, get out, get out, GET OUT, my brain is foggy and I hastily excuse myself running to the bathroom and sliding down the wall. My breathing is coming in fast and leaving faster, I count but it doesn't work and tears are prickling my eyes from lack of oxygen. I see hogwarts being torn apart and so many bodies everywhere and it's all my fault , everything , everything is my fault. I barely realize I'm rubbing the medallion in the blurr of my panic until I feel this wave of calm wash over me. And just like that I catch my breath and I'm no longer looking at lavender Browns body but the sink on the train. I take a minute to compose myself at fix my hair then make my way back to the compartment. Harry is immediately by my side and sitting me down not letting go of my arm as he wraps his own around it. I quietly thank him and explained I wasn't feeling well for a minute to the others and they nodded wishing me to get well soon. The rest of the ride is filled with chatter until we pull on our robes and are minutes away from hogwarts.
"Trust me Harry you'll be great! Alright? So eat your breakfast. You'll need to keep your strength up for the game! Come on don't make me force feed you young man!"
The snake was immediately slithering over to my battered body when Severus popped in, the sound waking him up.
he blushes heavily as he mumbles under his breath, and though I heard him, and Sirius was now eating his shepherds pie in amusement while watching us, I said.
That black book wasn't in there before........ and just like that I piece it together. It's Ginny! I ignore the fist fight beginning to happen and take my chance now that Lucius is distracted to take it back. Ginny who is watching the scene with giant eyes startles when I get in front of her but I just make sure to put on a charming smile, and quickly grab the book.
I follow his directions and place Draco on a cot in the office as Ron, Mione, and Neville join us with bated breath. Severus is quick and efficient in his work wasting no time. He has Draco cleaned and sporting thick layers of balm covering the raw clawed tears running down his cheek to his neck. The bright angry red lines and tissue stand out on his now bruised pale skin, glistening from the balm.
He smiled and got comfortable despite being in his week old school robes Pomfrey spelled clean every day. I just cast a clothes changing spell and made the robes into soft cotton shorts and a soft long sleeve cotton shirt. I did the same process on me and got into the bed as well, bringing him in close to my chest. He sighed comfortably and nuzzled closer. This was by far one of the best feelings I've ever felt and I drifted to sleep beyond content.
I blink rapidly after seeing a gruesome memory of bellatrix beating me in a duel and giving Luna a show of blood and borderline rape before locking me up with her.
He nods his head up and down and I thank him before warning him that I'm going to open the cage and take him out.
They all look in awe for some reason and I'm about to ask what's up when I hear a familiar owl screech and a second later I confirm my thoughts. A letter is dropped in front of me and it has the Malfoy family seal on it. I open it already resigned to being disowned when my eyebrows raise as I read.
I listened intently to her explanation and felt sadness at how everyone here was given such a horrible thing. I couldn't imagine being turned into anything and living with it for years like Pansy has. I thought back to the Host, Draco, and felt sympathy and anger on his behalf. It saddened me to think he found himself so scary that he hid away from me to not frighten me. I wanted to meet him and thank him in person for the help. It didn't matter what he was turned into on the outside, the inside is what matters.
I'm trying to get off Blaise while my eyesight blurs and immediately refocuses sharply from the rush of adrenaline sloshing through my veins. I stumble to stand as I hide the left side of my face from view, with my robe, and ignore the screams around me. They could obviously see blood all over Blaise and were in shock from the bright red covering his white uniform shirt. I just rushed out of there with the echos of Hagrid taming the creature and trying to calm down the students while hauling Blaise up from the ground. I could hear Hagrid calling out to me while Neville, Ron, Mione, and Harry were giving chase after me. But I had to hurry up and make it to Sev before my burst of energy left me and I passed out.
Neville snickers at the question all the while Ron seems to try and avoid answering but ultimately answers.
I bite my lip when I don't see anyone and decide to check out the swinging door connected to this small sitting room but its just as empty. I know where the kitchen is now I think belatedly as I turn back around to the sitting room. I stand shivering near the fire trying to warm up despite it being impossible, when I see a stack of clothes that were definitely not there before. I furrow my brows and am about to call out again when I hear a quiet grave voice say,
"Draco, I didn't know. Oh goodness you shouldn't have put yourself in that kind of danger! You flew on a broom at a high speed and altitude! What if something happened?! I'm going to have to keep an eye on you from now on. If you don't feel well tell me immediately!"
And just like that he parts from the room, robes billowing behind him dramatically. I knew I was going to need to explain to both Harry and Sev what I was doing, and from the gaze Harry is giving me, I'm betting he wants that explanation now.
I got over my momentary shock just in time to pluck both items from him and became his personal hair assistant in under a second. I towel dried his hair softly and he just laughed while leaning into the touch. After I carefully brushed out his silver locks I became acquainted with his soft hums and sighs of satisfaction. Finally once I was done I ran my fingers into his hair to let it dry in the slightly messy style I liked on him so much. He tilted his head back to see my own face sort of playfully and I had to resist the urge of touching his soft lips with mine.
This is the time i made theo look a mean person.. And draco as lovely male i always want to manual his out character.
Lucky i use silenco charm. He thought as he see the slythern student still unwake from his disturbing dream.
So griffidor. The young malfoy seem upside down for the history to change like this. Is he that he too kind? For them to had weird reaction like harry do?
‘-we disagree!! The fleux must be protected while he not need to worry for this matter! He just eleven years old YOU People gone crazy with decision of-‘
‘aza.. aza.. ohh the fourth of the third of the fifth of the dark dark one..let the girl be your bride be your bind aza..aaza…’ the spell became more stronger as the man with hood feel his blood rushed faster.
‘-Severus, look…I’m here because Dumbledore hire me, that’s it! Nothing more nothing less’ the man with his aura of werewolf blood that booming in his body and his name is Remus Lupin.
He slowly came forward to the book that seem to give the light shimmer around him, as he is close enough to the book. The book shook and whisper again for him to heard for more'..its time for you..to cure time..it may forbidden for me to come with you..but..i must guide you in each journey..'
'harry, we better ask hagrid what the thing he was holding there for the someone who want to break a volt for that' hermione who now sitting next harry as she finish her explaining.
‘of course, my mistress, forgive me for my lack of explaining’ the man bowed in forgiveness as he slowly explains what he had says in the beginning. The mistress nodded in knowledge it.
'..sleep well..young boy..the information is more and..will tell you..sooner..' the young malfoy nodded toward the book.
And he still feel the strong stare from the boy from his side eye as if he never notice before a few minute ago.
By the Way, Padma been torture and yes terry gone. As in dead in here. New man appears: werewolf figure. Help me what kind of name suitable for him? That continue the torture for Padma
On the other side of the building, a furious figure chatter the books that mess all the entrance, as he trying to find the book of dark desire as well, 'where is it?! damn it!' the room were a mess, with one spell of his wand the library back to the way it is.
But. Who is that man? Said draco to himself as his eyes lurk to the wall where the figure stand few moment just now.
‘i... hmmm’ hermione had the urge in tears, as seeing her two friends was still not awake, even harry is not coma like ron. It still feels like some string is going pull them away.
"No please Draco, no. It wasn't supposed to be like this! Oh god Draco. I-I don't want it to end this way, please, please, please I'll do anything. Tell me what I can do! Draco."
"Oh Draco, can't you see he already likes you! Maybe not a lot but he does. Look I know it might feel impossible but what if Harry really can break the curse?"
What I didn't understand was that instead of getting up and leaving me there alone injured on Sev's sofa like I thought he would, he was in my arms in less than two seconds. I held on like he was my life line, hands bunched up in his robe and face hidden in his neck as tears leaked from my eyes. I let myself cry silently with a few sniffles and gasps breaking the quiet.
I took her arm in mine and said, "father didn't want his heir to look fragile so he grabbed a hold of my hair during breakfast one morning and used a cutting curse."
He nods with sad but determined eyes. "I'll help you with it any time. Do you want me to bandage it for you?"
I hand the brownies to Harry as it’s his responsibility the group gets theirs after taking two for myself and Hermione. We part from Blaise and happily make our way to the common room together.
I ran my fingers through my slightly wet curls before looking outside the giant window. I could see it begin to snow much to my confusion before remembering that the forest was enchanted and likely keeping everyone here trapped while deterring any outsiders from finding their way here. It wasn't long before Pansy was knocking on the rooms door and calling for me to open
I nod with a somber smile, "yeah, we all miss him. But you know Blaise, you aren't alone. You have me and the others to keep you above water right now. How about we all meet up by the portrait of Salazar on the fifth floor, tomorrow at eight? We can get you introduced to everyone else."
I immediately respond. "Oh! thank you so much I'm so sorry to be a bother and just barge into here like some heathen. I promise I will repay your kindness."
In a few days we would be buying our school supplies and I hoped that this year there wasn't another fight between Lucius and Arthur.
It isn't long after that I wake up feeling warm and at peace. I don't even want to open my eyes and face the world I'm so comfortable. That is until I feel that the warmth is much warmer than normal and it seems to be radiating from a specific spot. I furrow my brows and realize the warm blob is actually a person and I am cuddled up to said person. My eyes fly open and I scramble backwards blindly making me fall from...... Sev's sofa?
I then apply some of the bruising balm on him. I stand and hand him two warm scones , he smirks and gets a house elf to make us the tea. As soon as we're both comfortable and sipping tea in between bites of our pastry I ask him.
I couldn't stop the tremendous wave of fury that was crashing through my body. Everything would have been fine if people just tried to put aside their prejudices and helped one another. I couldn't avoid the fact that the entire catalyst for everything that went wrong was Dumbledoor's mistake of letting his own feelings get in the way of his judgement. I couldn't help the mix of hatred and disbelief that found a home in my chest towards the headmaster even if I tried.
I start to nod and Blaise gathers me in his arms. "I didn't want to and they knew I didn't want to. But they had a wand at my mothers throat when I had to answer. I said yes and she lived. I never wanted to but I couldn't let her die, she was the only one who loved me. I can still hear the insane laughter from the death eaters as they tortured me everyday. And the screams of prisoners in my own house in the middle of the night. I had to fix everything, too many people are dead. I couldn't live with myself knowing the same students we see in these halls die or get ripped apart by Fenrir right in front of my eyes. I couldn't keep on living. So I came back to help them, to save those who I can save. It came with a price though, and even though it gutted me I'd still come back. It took my mothers love for me away. But I'd rather her hate me than love me if it means she won't die."
I caress his hair. "Nothing this extreme has happened before. It scares me but it's okay, it's over now. You helped me come back, and that's all that matters. So thank you."
"I feel like such a jerk now. I thought you were pretending to be nice this whole time and now I feel like complete rubbish for thinking it."
So I once again had somehow gotten flour in my hair. It definitely had nothing to do with the fact that me and Daisy were flinging flour at each other, none at all. And once it was ready for me to leave I had the pastries all packed and I hugged Daisy farewell. So with that I make my way back to the common room and go to the bathrooms to meet Harry again. Though Neville is here as well, hmmm interesting. Neville laughs once he sees me and Harry looks concerned but humored as well.
He shakes his head and continues talking to siren as I turn to Neville and ask how he’s coming along in his magic using his real wand. He goes into a long ramble on it and some new plants he's come across.
"Thank you for coming back Draco. I don't care if you were on the wrong side before. I know you. The you right here, right now. The one who always looks out for everyone whether it be from older kids or homework troubles. The one who comforts Mione when others are hurting her. The one who bakes to relax ."
"Oh I see, I won't take your Harry away but, if he changes his mind. You know where to find me Harry."He says with that oh so charming smile.
"I have a feeling that whatever Hagrid took from the vault at gringots is there because someone is trying to steal it. Someone who needs it desperately, and I..... I think I know who it is. So I went there to investigate and found myself facing a three headed dog, as you can tell by the scratches."
"Okay so first of all, I am from the future. What I'm trying to say is that I have already lived through this. I was eighteen years old and because of a war that happens later had such horrible outcomes, I came back to help."
Now fully prepared I make my way slowly to the corridor not wanting to bring any unnecessary attention. I keep my head down until I finally make it to the corridor. I raise my head and take in every single detail I can, where the doors are, the portraits, the flooring, everything. I take a few steps to know if the portraits themselves can tell I'm there, and It's confirmed when one of them asks if anyone is there. I narrow my eyes but relax minutely when they ask for me to become visible. The woman just harrumphs and turns back to the soldier in her painting and continues to flirt.
The air in the library was filled with the smell of old books and fresh ink. It was practically swirling around me as I tremblingly wrote in the horcrux. It's been a few weeks now that I've written in here about unimportant things with "Tom" writing back. I was careful in not divulging anything important and mainly stuck to conversing about magic. And I hated myself for actually liking the times I would write in here because........ he was a genius.
I hand her the package and we all stare as she pulls out each item. A pair of light blue crystal earnings with silver, a rose gold bracelet, a very detailed planner with a lock, and an extensive set of colorful ink including the limited edition metallic shades. Then a beautiful velvet purple winter robe with silver clasps for the final item. She gasps and thanks me profusely after trying to give back the jewelry. I refuse and put it on her claiming I couldn't possibly return them now that she has them on. She hugs me tightly to express her gratitude as I grin at my success.
I held onto him and started to stutter how sorry I was that they were treated so badly and that I never helped them. That I was a horrible person because of it and that I swear to always help them when they're hurt or sad, because it was wrong that they had to work and not be appreciated and thanked. I don't know how long I was there or if I even repeated things because it was as if, as soon as I started talking everything that was being bottled up from before and now was coming out in the forms of I'm so sorry, it's all my fault, and tears. All I knew was that I was being held and they were warm and comforting.
He gives me a fond look that I could look at all day before asking for a minute. I nod and watch as Draco asks for Dobby to bring a full dinner and a pair of fresh clothes. Dobby grins and comes back with what Draco asked for, and with a thank you from Draco, Dobby leaves. He passes the food over to a surprised but grateful Sirius. I can only give him a warm teasing smile. Draco just blushes softly and with a wave of his hand the pair of clothes become bigger. Then he hands them over to Sirius all folded, socks and briefs and all. He looks at me and says,
Draco sighed with a delighted smile and thanks us for coming to check up on him, making sure that we know he would be getting
He tightens his hold on me and I bask in it. I go to classes after this with a skip in my step much to the surprise of everyone.
I did my best to refuse but I found myself walking through the forest with him next to me in a somber silence. My mind felt numb as I walked without clear thought. All I felt was emptiness at how everything was turning out. I didn't want things to end like this. I wanted to be able to hear how his voice really sounds. Is it soothing? Does it sound like a methodical melody when he laughs or does he give a hearty laugh while throwing his head back in uproarious joy? Does he really like to dance? Or imagine us dancing, by the lake, in the moonlight like in his daydreams from a child? Does he imagine it like I do? Would he be taller than I am or short enough that I could curl up around him.
And that was how we found ourselves in the ministry elevator slightly squished. Ron didn't look as if he minded since he was closest to Mione but I myself was pressed against Harry's chest and I couldn't control the flush on my face.
I grin and nod my head to agree with her bright eyes, as if we are sharing a secret. She carefully takes a hold of the sugary goodness as I brandish a comb and take a glance at her silky hair. She grins with glowing eyes full of happiness and rosy cheeks as the brush glides into her locks. I smile to myself wishing to keep those smiles on their faces as much as possible.
was going to be fine we all became much more at ease and couldn't wait for him to join us later that night. Especially because of a letter that came for Draco earlier that I just knew had to be from his solicitor. Mainly because he didn't get any other letters that were without the Malfoy crest on the outside, apart from his lawyer.
"Okay so your dad had a friend group of Sirius black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew. And If Sirius is innocent then it had to be Peter, especially when I saw him in the manor. Yes, okay, one piece of the puzzle is solved."
It's at that moment I think of the perfect gift for him. I try to keep the excitement inside but I knew it wouldn't matter in the end, since Draco looked up and saw me. I just grin, and while he finishes Miones hair I quickly scribble a note to order a catalogue from the jewelry store in Diagon alley. I tell the others I'll meet them at breakfast and I'm going to send a letter to Sirius really quick.
I lean against the door, my face resting on the cold wood, basking in the feeling of nostalgia circling me as I take in the chill of the dungeons I grew up in for six years of my life. I knock sloppily on his door hoping to Merlin that he heard me because my motor skills are not in top shape, and I'm fully prepared to knock my head against the door instead of my weak fist if needed. I didn't need to worry though because Sev opens the door with a straight face before morphing into one of panic.
"They guard prisoners in Azkaban. They feed on people's happiness, and leave you feeling depressed and full of despair. In rare cases you could relive your worst memories."
"Jesus Christ, I should have met you sooner if your going to help bring in criminals. Alright then I'll take him into questioning. Could I have the key?"
"It's a shame such a bright talented boy has such a sickness, don't worry I'll make sure it's kept a secret. I know how the Slytherin students would try to take advantage of it."
It's almost as if I was transported back to the dungeons in the manor and I was treating her injuries and sneaking food down to her again. She had been my only solace to the nightmares plaguing my day and night, and I had been hers.
"The name is Draco Malfoy, Mr. Black. And I have come up with one but I will have to consult with Harry here first. Als-"
I knew Draco and Blaise both had dark families, and no doubt know a lot about dark magic along with all of it's intricacies. Something very few would be okay with and something they both would struggle with. Because they knew spells powerful enough to take down any enemy and having to stop their instincts of kill or be killed in every friendly duel or petty fight was undoubtably difficult for them. I couldn’t imagine having to be like them, of having to constantly hold themselves back to keep themselves and others safe.
'well..well.. Take a sit you two and again don't be late next time' the human form speak stern and that human form is professor minerva.
'I get that books is important but this is extreme. is she aiming to be a teacher pet?!. so mudblood nerd!'
'hah' harry once again unhappy which seem unnotice around him, that his friends follows behind him giggling seeing his behavior.
‘ergh!’ a sound of male voice groan, “hmm..where ergh! My hea-‘. Feeling he had broken ribs or something.
'wouh? what happen to the food? did I step those when I came in?' Hermione cut off harry who seem relieved for the clueless mione.
But. Who is that man watching him just now. Draco look worried and wonder as he did saw a figure stand a few moment on the wall, which is in the top of the tall buiding located somewhere in there.
With his heart beating rapidly, knowing his father was never using the loud voice in heated situation. But since, Alex is gone.. father literally change while mother…mother remain kind but sadness was overcame her.
Her heart was bind to follow that old master’s command. She hates it so much. She did lie toward her master. Because Draco is her only cousin that as the warrior of fleux. But for now, she wants to die to protect her cousin, draco.
'..your great great grandfather is malfoy..and yes..i know you malfoy...as i sense your magic from..far..come close..its time for you to go back..' the book response smoothly to give information to him.
‘WHERE IS THE BOY! YOU’RE USELESS SERVANT!’ furious voice from behind the head belong to the man who keep stutter with his words, ‘i-I I’m sorry m-m my lord i-I it just th-t the boy had- ‘
'i heard that the sorting is nasty devil flame come out from it' exclaimed a fearful tone voice from red hair person name ron weasley.
'it is a easy job, what you need is to kill her and don't forget that the ritual is not done yet!' the figure with only the eyes is seen, which wearing a mask with a symbol of red skull attach on it.
Unknown to them, the shadow man heard the whole talk between them and the shadow man soon dissappear, as if he was not there.
‘YOU’RE what! Protect us to safety! Then why you submit with devil man who will kill anyone include our sons that still alive. Don’t tell me you forgot our middle son, Alex! He was just young and now! You follow that sociopath or devil I didn’t know how or when!’
‘but...I-I am not virgin anymore! You monster! I- ‘padma trying her best to push his hand away from spreading her legs.
‘but father-‘ Lucas wanted to argue but seeing his father in tears and madness in his eyes make him having mix feeling inside.
'grr' the boy face pale with wet all over as he still not use with cold shower. In his home, he always had the room of heat, which magic spell from his mother.
Other than that, the headmaster also had the meeting with the only professor Severus Snape and Minerva McGonagall. Wonder what is it that meeting is about?
The spell made a big impact as it glow over the draco boy, which also made the boy's wand glow protective over the boy.
In the present time, dark night seem shine toward the man who lay froze in unknown prison cell, named ‘Lucas Malfoy’ that seem lost in his memory.
‘l-let me think about it my love. We need to talk to Severus about this as well...  only him… maybe can gave us some advice or help that we need right now’ said lucius looking straight at his wife’s eyes, that full of tears of pain begging toward him.
‘till next time? just who is that unknown man’ Padma thought out loud as the night once again is merely cold to rest nicely.
‘all I ask is stay for time there and I need space too. I don’t know if I handle to do labor here without being alert 24hr. please honey..i begging you I’m need it..’
As promise I will update it today aka chapter 30, originally after I remove the ‘news for this updated’
As he shake his head for the feeling of butterfly inside of him, he ask what normally to ask for first year student 'by the way..do you know what sort house you may be?'
The sound of the crowded student heard from the outside, made her burst to tears, as her body can’t even move and already in his control. His eyes were not someone she knows before as the kind one. He is person that had the kindness, suddenly to be the monster she never aspect he became, which is taking her by force.
'do we know you. How? Well we know you beautiful blond and very loving animal person' the twins stated in the same time again.
‘laila.. laila.. laila... I wish you just accepted me. NOT THAT man!!! I kill him and your only soul-son, ALLAN!’
'imup' the young malfoy mumble in his still state of sleep form, as he slowly walk to the big bathroom.
‘sorry guys. I really do. I think this scar really affect me more when I had the feel to be mad’ the boy-who-lived called harry potter lay on sofa as he had the looks of guilty.
the stories of the dark desire in another chapter which is in 28 or 29... both chapter I will updated soon.
'well..its urmm-' draco feel hard to tell but, before he open his month to answer, been cut off by hermione instead.
Just why pansy!! Thought Draco with his mind still thinking where hermione had the looks of lost and despair in the middle of forbidden forest.
“well I want to tell you that the letter is already in the Slytherin room and I hoping you would read the letter soon. If that okay with you Draco?” said Cedric who had the big smile, as him and the family was waiting to spend time with Draco.
Thank god. The giant man save the day. As he still shiver the stern burn betweem his mother and mr wand man.
'ahah, someone dating i resume' that voice really making him blush all over that can beat weasley's red hair.
‘I agree with you, severus. Ah nearly forget, that old man... I mean Dumbledore want us to meet at his office tomorrow. I wonder what that man wants from us’ Minerva feel not comfortable on how that headmaster keeps so many secrets. Making her not trust that old man. Severus grin and nodded in agree toward Minerva’s statement.
‘hmmm... whats the news you have me dearly!’ the man with the masked stare hard toward the weak state of the female servant.
The frog search seem forgetten as the time flies. The train stop and that means they had arrive at the station.
That night was very exhausted and the three of them decided to call it off, as they all went back to their room.
‘oh... my dear baby brother. I don’t think I can understand that’ he smiled, while seeing his 8-month baby brother, name Draco Malfoy laying nicely calm within his arm.
‘I heard it loud and clear. So, my dear cousin, may I know your name?’ draco stare ahead to this mystery cousin of his.
Made Severus startled in annoying toward the disturbance, ‘what? Lupin’. Instead of answering, Remus smile in curious while Severus feel more annoying of the wolf’s behavior.
‘Marly! Are you listening? You know that you’re women and staying alone in the woods is dangerous you know and-‘
Ron face look groan for the broom that seem rolling over than going up, 'Up! U-' the broom end up too fast, which smacking ron face.
It is to prevent the student, especially the reporter student, from spreading the rumor of the fallen weasley boy.
The first scene is about pansy being suspicious and why she was doing the ritual…. (watch out for historical and weird spell I had made)
He suppose to met clumsly neville in diagon alley but instead harry.. There..before went to mr oliver, aka..i had issues with name.soe for wrong grammar..so shush.. The mr-wand-know..for me he kinda creepy in smart..my opinion so no hate me for it oke..
‘hah… maybe I should rest’ she said, while carrying the seal book with her to the Gryffindor’s dorm.
Better be brave than nothing, she thought of herself as she stops then facing the person who has been following her scroll toward her dorm.
He signed in thinking about it. As he walk back to the tall door that served him way to where the slytherin room is.
The boy struggled to the right to the left and feeling drown all it once, 'no! Please don't hurt m-my brother!! Stop pl-' the young malfoy body shaken in fear as he still unease from the nightmare.
The night was far from over after the visit of saving hermione by his so-called-childhood friend, pansy.
‘ah... sorry cedric... what I mean is why in this age you meet your cousin draco?’ said hermione in curious way.
Hermione stare hard toward the eager harry who wanted the answer, 'let me finish the reading of this book, harry! And maybe this page will made you curious even more for this next sentence. It says here that whoever that had the lust, the desire, the wish to be the pureblood, famous, dark magic and treasure'
‘well… that is surprising is it, severus?’ said the women name professor Minerva, looking nearly blank as her eyes stare in question toward the unemotional man, name professor Snape.
The silence was comfortable for him. Draco smile in thought as he remember the memory an hour ago with harry. After they both yawn and wave a goodbye in each other.
As she turned left, focusing her silence night working while harrying the seal book. On the sidewalk, she has seen the paintings is having serious conservation on themselves. Worrying occur on her face as she fears that, the ‘fat lady’ is there at the entrances of the Gryffindor for her to enter the dorm safely.
‘Awooooooooooooo!- ‘echo of werewolf called for the pack to have meeting, which is not far from the  female figure.
‘I know my dear son~ lets keep praying my dear son’ the mistress holding in pray position in hoping the warrior win.
Draco feel curious for the figure doing strange way toward Harry with the familiar red towel “just who is that?” he whispers and carefully in silence made a spell toward himself, so he will be invisible from the figure from seeing him.
'why you called me? And how you know that i'm malfoy?!' he felt nervous as he voice out nearly stutter.
Professor Minerva had no clue whatsoever for the headmaster want for them, ‘-by all that, I had hired Remus Lupin to be professor here in Hogwarts…’
‘AHHHHH! Where who what? The heck pansy you- ‘draco glare toward the figure infront of him who had a grin appear on her face like a mask is already attach on it.
Padma patil that I decide to use in this unusual character I decide to choose and very sorry for using her but seriously we need dramatic... (which already appear in the chp. 23 & 24)
Forbidden? Why do he feel that sound is curse. As he feel wanted to know the history of his forbidden wand.
‘hmm... it looks delicious!’ mumble Draco as he scan hungrily of the food in front of him..i mean her.
'well class, lets begin with commanding your broom with strong confident of 'UP!' and begin students' said madam rolanda in strong loud command.
'stop it pan!' draco face red as tomato while pansy smile in victory to see her bestie is back than being nerdy one.
I wonder if i can made draco more curious and smart. He is likely my favourite slytherin, i can't stop that. But i do want him to had a hidden smart boy than other slytherin.
Professor rolanda shout out the end of the game, which calculated the points from each house, 'and the winner goes to griffidors!!!'
The rustle of the book each of each part they read of the book name ‘desire’ is still unclear to them.
It was in the dusk of the sundown, madam poppy had already left them be after she explain the situation of ron's condition body, while curing draco at the same time, with the healing potion.
'i know mione. It just that..i ermm' harry sound unsure to says as hermione smile for the reaction she see toward harry.
'so what is it about?' harry look satisfied and also needed to ask as he look Hermione done with her explanation.
‘It means that like chess rules it had a specific function to make it work! Like this book that I had read it before that it seem work only at night at maybe around 10pm or 11pm’ hermione briefly explain while looking at draco and harry.
What is wrong with this wolf? Thought Severus staring at the person, Remus who is busy staring in interest toward the floor than to him.
The words keep repeat till they arrive to the sofa, harry slowly put draco on the sofa as he sit on floor holding draco's left hand. Fear draco will be disappear.
'wait!! you tell me that, our R.O.N is been use for his blood and why is it must hi-' Harry pause Hermione's word seem not to believe what he just heard, even the first sentence is not even done to be read by Hermione.
'draco? Glad see you here..i wonder when you came and the room is full. Hoping i can sit here with you' the boy seem red all the sudden and his eyes wonder on the wall than to his eyes.
'well done, miss granger. And thats why being celebrity is not pay well for being smart. And lets begin in page 112-'
‘I know severus but please for the student… you just gave the potion and walk away. I know you still hurt for what they done, or he done’
‘so...’ draco paused behind the door as his humming stop, upon hearing a male voice was not he expected.
'well..well the celebrity is here, let me ask you a question boy, what is the first thing you need for fever cure'
‘I-I don’t know who is that name is? And please! let my hair go! You JERK! LET GO! AHHH!’ the girl keeps screaming but the man still won’t budge at all.
Thank you again, my dear readers dor the lovely kudos and comments... I’m super blessed forever (said it always) bless you all…
‘I found him, mother! I found draco... our lost family... its been so long mother. Please tell dad about this mother~’
The wolf lay back. Severus remembered the way he’d clutched his hand in pain after the fight with his own friend Sirius who accusing Remus of joining with the dark one and seeing Remus just relaxed on his back as Severus slowly massaging his hand.
'its fleux kind. I wonder why it fit you. Are you, young malfoy, the last fleux in forbidden tides family?' mr oliver curiously question him but before he stated his comment. His mother gave mr oliver a very quick words in anger 'how much!'
Slowly, harry open the paper that now unbind, 'ron look! This is the volt that hagrid and me went to' both harry and ron look straight to hermione's eyes, to know if she heard it.
'yeah yeah..don't put me into nerd. So wheres harry' pansy voice up teasing  'seem he not here i see'
The reserve room had also a full books with only 3 sections like tall tree up high like in the one in the outside.
The betray or is it a betray of the person he (Draco) know? And why this effect hermione and others of his friends?
'Alright lets go to sleep now, and I will see you guys tomorrow morning at 7am. don't be late. You need a good rest draco and harry, please rest as well with draco' Hermione bid her goodbye as she went to the gryffidors's dorm.
‘mother~ will the warrior win?’ whisper a young boy had the same wavy hair like his mother, mistress Laila Merlyn.
As we walk inside the hallway, there in the stair await of a female teacher. 'hello everyone welcome to the hogwart and please silence as we-'
But it seem madam poppy's face look serious as she still putting potion on the red hair boy's bruises on the hand and neck that look visible then the rest of the light bruise.
Tanaka briefly answer, ‘yes mistress, even if he is from the Malfoy’s family. All his blood is half Malfoy, half blood of black family and full-blood of fleux. He is known as worlf-wolf tribe. Not a wolf not half blood and none of it. Fleux blood is known as the full-blood of worlf-wolf tribe. I see the vision, mistress. Not only that, he is different than his brother. His soul-mate is the boy who-lived, called by name HARRY POTTER!!’
While Pansy standing there looking blank as she watches Hermione’s back till there’s no more side of her, ‘I’m sorry…I-I’m sorry guys… I-I had to-’
Hermione feel her breath is getting shallow as the rule of the book really making more mystery. Looking at her friends that also had the same in mind like her, to why ron and who was it? is it ron? or someone else or maybe both. Hermione thinking in mind to figure it out the clues.
Draco glances at harry for moment, ‘I hope it will harry but let’s hope it work for us to able to read’
‘I KNOW! I KNOW WHAT I DID IS WRONG BUT I-I NEED you with me in strength of this foolish weak of me...please stay I i-
I look over at him and notice he takes a piece of cooked meat by one of the sides and carefully pulls it to bite more until the whole slice is in his sharp mouth. He then chews but gives me a nervous look to which I return with my own grin much to Draco's relief. It isn't too long before were both done with dinner and I suggest starting some research. He complies but asks wether I'd like to change into something more comfortable. So I'm on the way to my room again while wondering why rich people have to change clothes so often. But I do feel much better once changing into a pair of soft dark blue sleep pants and a black short sleeve shirt. The bottoms did ride a bit lower than I was used to but I didn't mind much that I wasn't fully covered so I left with a smile back downstairs. I was about to round the corner to meet up with Draco outside the dinning hall when hearing Draco whine at pansy to "stop."
I went to my classes unable to say in honesty that I payed attention to what we were learning but I managed to get through them all at least. It was during dinner where Zabini shouldered me in the entrance of the great hall to slip a note into my hand, which I read once I was seated. It asked if we could meet up after dinner and I gave him a nod after catching his eyes. I just waited for him to get up and followed after five minutes so as to not arouse suspicion from his table mates.
"Draco your making me a little nervous over here but I swear to you that I will not tell another soul what you are about to tell me. You are the only person who cares about me and what happens to me. I won't give this up, I won't give you up."
"Alright I know that the one to proceed has to be either one of these two. The one to go back is simple, it's this one I've put on the far right. But these two could be the other one we need."
Harry just furrowed his brows, "Draco you don't have to do this alone. I want to help. I don't like it when your sad or stressed, so come to me when it gets bad okay?"
This is how the weeks seemed to pass by for the most part. Except for the countless picnics I had us go on just so Draco wouldn't be the only one sitting on the ground. A lot of the times we would have the picnics in one of the elaborate ballrooms since it had continuously kept snowing outside. There were also a few times Draco would take me to a new part of the castle and show me a surprise. Like the time he showed me his glass greenhouse filled to the brim with several herbs and exotic flowers. I thought it was amazing and ever since he would happily agree to go whenever I asked to go for a visit. Though I didn't do it as often as I would like due to Draco not being able to go very far inside.
"Harry, I can walk you know. Though I appreciate the lift honest, now how much do I owe you for the ride?"
I stop and try to gauge what he's thinking from his face. I come up with nothing. But perk up once he starts talking.
He gives a relived breath and I smirk at him. He raises a perfectly plucked eyebrow on his golden tan skin and I take out a raspberry tart. He gives me a charming smirk and says, "I see today you were feeling raspberry huh? Well I would never resist one of your delicious pastries. Thank you true heir to the ice prince crown."
Once we enter I walk over and stand near the entrance waiting for Olivanders attention, which wasn't long. Seconds pass by when he's suddenly in front of me with a smile, that I find myself returning. He looks me in the eyes and he pauses for a second then goes back to smiling and pulling out a black rectangle box. My eyes light up knowing that it's my wand from the pull I'm getting. I take the wand out and as the golden light spirals around me I brightly smile feeling myself become complete with the bond of my wand, "10 inches, made of hawthorn wood, and has a unicorn hair core, reasonably pliant." Both Olivander and I say at the same time. He looks at me surprised and then laughs while patting my arm. It's been so long since I've heard laughter that I don't know whether to feel happy or acknowledge the self hatred for being a part of the reason laughter was rare.
I pick the note up and put it in my bedside drawer before getting ready. I look to see if Draco would need anything and scooped up his school robe before leaving to dorm room. Making my way down the stairs I can see Draco making an elaborate hair style on Mione again and I try to imagine him with a little something in his hair.
Was Ron's first reaction and I laughed inside, as I nodded my head. We sat together and Harry explained what happened. Unfortunately he also mentioned I was also offered a position but turned it down because I had something called anemia. I mentally face palmed because even though I knew it wasn't likely anyone would know what that meant, I just wanted to brush that under the rug. That is until Hermione gasped. Fuck, I should have known she would know what that was.
Well at least I'm not disowned yet, that's a plus. Though I'll need to pack a shit ton of strength potions and pepper ups for the summer. I can already tell I'm going to be hexed and cursed daily. I just pass the note to Hermione since she's practically burning a hole through my head with the intensity of her stare. She just gasps and looks about to cry making me flounder and patt her hand to comfort her. She passes the note to Ron and he just looks angry as he hands it Harry. Once Harry's done he looks at the letter hatefully and I pass it to Neville, and he just looks at the letter offended and hugs me.
I watched him run off and everyone began asking me when I was going to make any attempt at getting him. To which I kindly reminded them that I was just me and he was way more amazing. They were not agreeable to my reasons and said that Draco definitely felt the same way much to my skepticism. I just kept it in mind and went back to my rooms when they had to leave, but caught myself giving a lingering look to a shaggy black dog who was hiding behind some buildings.
I promised myself I would buy him self adjusting clothes later today from my personal catalog given to me by madam Flores, a French designer and tailor. I had been going to her for my clothes ever since I was born and bought a new closet whenever we visited France every year. So as we waited for the brownies in the oven we got ready to work on the scones. It was then that the door opened and I knew it was Blaise this time.
I just caress his hair and repeat my words making him curl towards me unconsciously. I decide I might as well stay here in case he has another nightmare. So I slip in and as always bring him against my chest with a smile blossoming on my face at the comfyness. It was times like these I didn't mind so much that I was starved of touch growing up because it made these moments feel that much better.
And in no time The food I made was gone and we were making our way into the school. Harry now being able to see the thestrals was a sad pang in my chest but I carefully explained.
"It seems that due to trauma Mr. Malfoy's is incapable of speaking. His mind has made this symptom as a defense mechanism to protect him from his own mind. But this isn't anything to be worried about boys, with treatment Mr. Malfoy will be able to speak again. I will send word to the headmaster in bringing the artifact we need for your therapy and this will be all cleared up soon."
up and follow her to dinner. My stomach rumbled at that and I opened the door, gladly following her while asking my question.
He opens his door in regular fashion, scowl and glare on full "why have you dared to disturb me?!", mode. But as always it melts off his face quickly when his eyes catch mine as he ushers me in.
here is the dark desire part 3, I decide to called it as ‘unexpected…’, the reason is to made it more mystery and for you to be curious..
Well hello my dear reader and enjoy my long day in updated...and maybe soon the twice chapter or triple..insyallah soon
hello dear readers, here it is the story that related with draco as fleux that it had the opinion to the peoples in the forbidden forest. Is it true that his brother is alive or was it?
Wonder how hopeless he thinks when he thought the dark- no the monster never was honest person to begin with. ‘I-I’m sorry my friends...I’m sorry for betraying..’ as he whisper silently, while looking sad toward the calm blue sky.
The first wand very strong that nearly destroy half of the store of wand by harry. Like its too much power.
The book continue again '..the history of fleux happen iin your mother side..which..is the black family..it happen..in age of seven, the boy had died for losing control of..the core..magic..by learning..the dark magic..'
‘well... it was not the right time when he was very young. Too young even for me to be near him. Now he is adult. Now. finally, I can speak the trut- ‘draco feel cedric tone had the sad tone again.
‘wohuuuuuu! Mother mother! The warrior wins he win!’ shout the young boy name Allan in his happiness moment to heard the happy news, as his mother, the mistress Laila Merlyn.
Harry laugh hard to see ron red face of broom stick mark on it, 'shut up harry' said ron in anger, but can't help to laugh along with harry.
'hmmm..i see that some of the four type rule had the related to ron, but I think that I need more, I cough cough-co uh cough sorry guys, harry can you get me water please?' draco's throat feel thirst as the shock of harry's situation of madness and now its ron's situation that involved of blood.
‘…boy!...’ the familiar sound irritated than him who had hard time to adjust his eyes to just open. ‘hmmmm…duck muggle boo! Ergh!
‘well this is interesting so maybe we should open it, right?’ harry’s eyes look glint for a moment as he tells his opinion, as mione slowly sit between draco and him.
'here you go, dra' harry gave the cup full with water with his left hand, while holding the bottle at the same time with his right arm.
'hmmmm' he hummed as he read once again the passage carefully. Hoping he may had the answer that he had miss out.
In the next chapter, which is in the chapter of 26 will be the continue story of the dark desire in part 4. I called as ‘unbind curse…’ in this chapter (26) is the complete set of the story.
'i wonder, as well draco, but the blood that you see is ron's blood that cover all over his body, right?.
With that, all he saw was the man’s worry face and not much again he feels glad, to meets the blackness that seem to cloud his mind once again.
‘hah fine.. it’s the year of 1947! Happy now? marly..’ the man reply as his face still hold the amused for his repeat weird question again.
The information made him more and more in question, '-a cure within the last or first fleux blood. Nor the pureblood or mudblood. Nor a halfblood. The answer is forbidden one. A one that choosen...'
She stops walking. Even the footstep behind her also follows stop. Hermione tried again with a plan to step her left foot then walk slowly and wonder if the person behind her is also following her.
In mere of hour, the malfoy were ready early in the morning. The mother hate showing her emotion in public and the father is hate with crowded people.
'peww..we're save harry, its the only mr keeper's cat there' as soon as ron speak, the cat change form as to human form.
Instead of answering more, draco hug his bestie, pansy whose heart hurt to hit again her crush, theo.
‘you what? Lucius...honey I’m not asking for forever staying there… I’m only staying there until our youngest son is born. Our little dragon who know nothing about his second brother… or this devil man or his godfather that trap in that man’s hand and you! His own father..’ said Narcissa as she glare toward the man who stand with hand had a black symbol on it.
‘will that man handle for the full moon that will came in this August, headmaster!’ replied severus in furious, knowing the transform of the werewolf may harm the students.
Harry felt that he need to promise himself and to draco that he, harry potter, will not hurt anyone. Especially the one he love so much, which is draco.
Without no more question to ask, harry sit near draco who seem panic for feeling skin. Yes skin. Draco wear a sleeve that seem thin and him, the malfoy had sensitive skin effect.
The figure push ron side as she run in tears, 'i think she heard you, ron' harry's voice in dissapointed toward ron's statement.
'come on harry chop chop.. by the way, draco is already there waiting for us!' Hermione huffed while thinking, when are they going to be there fast.
In that very moment, the two boy stay lost in thought closely without any talk at all. Just viewing the view of hogwart's nature.
‘may ask who is this gentlemen beside you and why you suddenly so nervous? Am I really that scary? Do I?’ ask draco in teasing tone and pretending don’t know who is this man.
‘that’s it!!’ draco exclaimed loudly as he stares at hermione who stare back at him, as both of them had the same thought it.
Rather than reveal himself he need to investigate even more and why his childhood friend; pansy is doing this spell and for what she doing this. His thought of mind was ready in action and anxious to what will come for this investigate end.
Staring upon in relievw hearing the vote of the warrior is 1000 vote, but, the vote is not done as another vote is not yet announce.
‘Of course Draco I know, is not guilty at this matter because he was so busy worry about them and me than been involved. But you! You’re his close friend that trying to harm us and him. Like! Who does that! And now… you telling me, that you won’t tell me! who was that person planning this ridiculous curse! Now I feel like it is useless to talk with you anymore!... I need space away from you… Merlin damn sleep too…so BYE!’ Hermione responded infirm and angry tone, as she pushed her way to the hallway toward the Gryffindor dorm.
The forbidden forest looks scarier even its only afternoon time. Carefully prepare a broom to fly over to see from above whether Hermione may or may not be there.
This harder than I thought to be women, thought Draco as the food were brought to serve in this long dark crave wood.
Is he stay as slytherin or unfortunute expected happen that seem takeout lucious brain. Well emotion of un-malfoy way.
The professor, snape, tried to ask again for another question for harry, as if its not over yet, ' well..harry..hope you know what the dangerous terms for making the potion'
'i heard if its red, meaning you forget something, if im mistaken' ron explain his theory, as neville seem trouble, 'but i really don't know what i seem to forget'.
‘no Lucius! I’m scared I do after I heard the news of that devil man had make suffer our precious baby brother, Severus had suffer because of lily is now is DEATH. I say it again death! Get it! The only left is her son! HER ONLY SON… what if? What if we were like that? Our sons who still not yet mature to take care themselves is into death path? Is that what you what? Tell me! I-'
'he sound ravenclaw' neville stated in proud for the young malfoy who kind than the rest of the family he pass upon.
In the diagon alley, he already done the wardrobe check and some books needs with his mother, narcissa, along shopping for his first year. After the shaking tears up at the back of the house.
The mystery book, which remind him that the book is from the time he was chase by some scary people and-
But. Why harry here met with me. In my day here, i suppose to meet the clumsy neville. Not harry potter. I feel i change a history time line here. He wonder in alert as more pale cover his face again.
'run my boy, run as far from here..i..love yo-u' as if her breath was too much and there, she lay as stone beside her father, lucious, who been dead by the dead curse than torture like, his mother.
‘hermione..sh sh sh..it’s going to be okay..we- we can do this.. gosh now I’m crying too’ draco feels his face also wet with tears, seeing his friend, hermione burst in tears worrying their two friends, ron and harry.
Professor Severus feel relieved, knowing the headmaster not knowing the current happen for his godson as the warrior other than that harry prat potter.
‘mmm..maybe you’re right..gosh hope this book can reveal its original than its illusion’ draco pout for the book they had to wait for too long even it is another 15 minute or more’
‘well…okay fine! Let’s just open it and read whats happen for ron and the truth behind it. So, what should we start first among this three of the dark desire’ hermione feel her heart hurt while mention her friend’s name on her lips.
He the malfoy had find out that he is blood tie with a name called 'fleux' . He still curious as always and need to be wait for later.
In fact, I'm going to give you dear readers for the newest chapter then another day maybe, is also new chapter. don't forget for the kudos~
As soon she reaches to the door, the door was lock, ‘OPEN THIS DOOR TERRY!! PLEASE! SOMEBODY PLEASE LET ME OUT!! PLEASSEEE I BEG YOU!’ she banged the door over and over again but nothing seems to work. Tried to voice up a spell but seem it doesn’t work at all.
It took them nearly an hour to figure out how to adjusted the information they just receive for the first time in the history, since harry been earn as the boy-who-lived. Now, the wave of news is turn to another boy, they never expected there will be a danger and an enemy arrive that will harm to that boy. And that boy is Draco Malfoy.
