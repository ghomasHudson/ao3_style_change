Draco…….:Draco liked her like that?
Harriet glanced over at Draco and she smirked victoriously when she saw that his frown had disappeared.
Draco was too stunned to resist.
Draco remained silent and let Harriet speak for herself. She had been so headstrong about the entire situation he didn’t dare try to interject. However, he didn’t hold back the proud sneer that slipped across his thin lips as Ron looked over at him as if he were silently asking their longtime enemy if what it looked like was really true.
Harriet woke and rose from bed, feeling perfectly fine, with her belly still enviously flat three days after she had told Draco about her pregnancy.
Underneath her, both fluids pooled on the floor.
What was he smiling about?
Draco nodded quickly and the man saw from the scowl on his customer’s face that the couple seemed eager to proceed.
“I’m going to miss you too, brother!” Scorpius’s little sister cried as she threw her arms forcefully around his neck with a mournful wail, sending him staggering backwards with his grey eyes wide.
“That’s just where I ate too much last night, Draco, you’re being ridiculous.” Harriet said dismissively.
Harriet was strong.
“But-“ Dobby started to say.
“..........Who are you taking to?” A grumbling voice called out.
Draco liked to retain his privacy behind his heavy, ebony door.
She looked over and noticed the awed expression on Draco’s face as he scanned over the buildings.
So much time!
—————————————————————
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy!
“Yes.” Harriet nodded, “I don’t have much time, he doesn’t know I’m here.”
Harriet wasn’t sure if Draco was really that focused on his task or if he just chose to ignore her outright, but he offered no response.
Of course, Draco had never been all that good with
Draco felt small and overwhelmed all of a sudden, his resolve bleeding out of him like air from a popped balloon. A bone-deep exhaustion had begun to replace the adrenaline that had flooded him, and he could already feel the knots forming in his muscles, could hear the way his joints would creak the next time he stretched. Vaguely, he registered that he had finally severed his relationship with Lucius. Terror and uncertainty accompanied that thought, but, like the rest of the night’s events, he pushed it away to process later. And on top of it all, he was now ferrying around a catatonic Harry caught up in fighting his own demons.
His phone lit up then, and he checked it: eight percent charged, and showing he had enough time to reach his class if he hurried. He unplugged his phone, slung his bag over his shoulder, and ran.
“And who have you become?”
Draco could had done some awful things in previous years, but he was done with them now. There was nothing for Draco to fear here. He would not let phantoms of his past haunt him in the safe haven he had created for himself.
“Or did you just faint at how gorgeous he looks? I mean it should be illegal for a man to wear a shirt so that it shows so much perfect, pale flesh.” Harry rolled his eyes, swatting at Ginny. “You can’t deny it Harry, he’s hot.”
“I will never get tired of magic.” Christopher sighed. We were so proud of our Hermione when she got her Hogwarts letter. McGonagall came to visit us to explain it all and I just couldn’t believe it. Our girl, going away to train to be a witch. Of course we never imagined what she’d go through, but she’s strong, stronger than we ever could’ve imagined. I can’t believe what a beautiful, smart, caring, strong, independent young woman our little girl has become. Well, that’s a lie, I can; just look at her mother.’ He looked at Jenny and Hermione in turn, his eyes misting with pride. A lump rose in Harry’s throat and he had to look away. The conversation soon turned to memories and achievements. Harry was thankful that no-one mentioned anything to do with Voldemort, but instead spoke about the more mundane, yet still amazing, things that everyone had been working on since the war had ended. While the adults were talking, Lucy was running around the garden playing with the dogs. Percy had come down for food before leaving again, insisting that he had lots of work to do. Ginny sat as far away from him and they could, purposefully not talking to them but instead conversing with others around the table. Harry didn’t blame them.
“Malfoy.” He acknowledged, trying to act as calm and composed as the slightly taller man looked. His long fingers were delicately wrapped around a wine glass and he dipped his head in a slight nod before side stepping Harry. Harry watched him walk away, half wishing he would look back at him, half hoping he wouldn’t.
“You do realise that he lives in a two bedroom flat with Pansy right? I think Hermione said they lived above some coffee shop in London.” Ginny sighed. “Look Harry, you either work with Malfoy and get this idea off the ground and live the life you want, or you let the fact that it’s Malfoy ruin what you could have. You never know, maybe he’s grown up a bit since school.” Harry was slightly taken aback by Ginny’s tone, but he guessed they were right. He shouldn’t let old rivalries stand in the way of his happiness. He’d just have to maintain a professional relationship with Malfoy and only see him when it was absolutely necessary. He took a long drink from his mug of tea to avoid having to respond to Ginny. Harry’s silence was a perfect confirmation to Ginny that they were right.
He sent Luna and Fleur off while he finished Hermione’s hair and did Ginny’s. He tasked Luna with getting him another cup of tea and asked Fleur to check with Bill to see how Ron was doing. Ginny’s hair didn’t need a lot doing to it, just wetting, some mousse, a quick blow dry and some styling product. Hermione’s just needed the curls stretching slightly and finishing off with the hair dryer. Cho had done Hermione’s makeup while her hair had been fixing and she looked stunning. She had a slight shimmer on her eyelids with eyeliner and mascara that made her long, thick lashes frame her eyes beautifully. They’d chosen a nude lip and her skin looked like it was bathed in sunlight. Harry and Cho made a good team. It was coming up to twelve thirty by the time they’d finished and that gave them all an hour and a half before the ceremony started, plenty of time for the Bridal party to get themselves into their outfits and for Harry to get himself ready. He sat and sipped his cup of tea, soaking in the moments of silence before everything started back up again. He chatted with Cho about her makeup business as he said he would, and her answers just made him more certain that his salon was something he wanted to set up. She made the point that her mobile business would have different pros and cons to a stationary shop, but that she thought Harry should go for it. It was clearly something that he enjoyed and something that he was good at. He blushed slightly at the complements, but he felt pride swell inside him. He finished his cup of tea and went to get ready and find Ron.
Harry could feel eyes burning into him as he came out of the haze of unconsciousness. Bright, determined brown eyes.
He put his book down and wandered over to the wardrobe. There was a box at the bottom of it and he pulled it out. Lifting the lid, he took out a bundle of pictures. They were polaroids and depicted his mother and father’s transition from youth to adulthood, along with their friends’. The first one was James in his first set of school robes. He was stood next to his mother, Euphemia, who was grinning proudly, red Sari shining in the sunlight outside Madame Malkin’s. The next was four young boys standing in the Potter’s garden. They must’ve been around twelve, as it was taken at the end of the first school year. James was in the centre, ruffling Peter’s hair and laughing. Sirius was stood somewhat stiffly next to him and Remus was caught in a half yawn, auburn hair falling into his eyes. There were more of the boys from that summer, and the summers after. In each one Sirius seemed to relax, though he still retained some of his pureblood arrogance. Harry stared at the next one for some time. It was one of Sirius after Sirius had run away from home and started living with the Potters. It had ‘My first Eid with my real family’ written on it in Surius’ loping handwriting. In the picture Euphemia and Fleamont stood at either side of the boys. They were all dressed in traditional Indian clothing and Euphemia had beautiful, intricate henna designs twisting around her fingers and up her arms. Harry had learned that James and Sirius had helped her with them, and Sirius had been particularly good at it, taking a lot of care to get the design exactly right. Sirius’ eyes looked sunken and he looked pale; the picture had been taken mere days after he’d left home, but he looked happy. As the boys got older the pictures began to include his mother. Her skin was fair and freckled, and her hair was long and red. Her friends also appeared in the pictures. There was Mary, a small girl with blonde hair and blue eyes that crinkled as she laughed. Then there was Marlene whose afro was so big that she was often bending down in the pictures to make sure all of its magnificence was captured. There was also Dorcas who was tall and willowy with long, straight brown hair and chocolatey brown eyes. As they got older, the pictures also began to include looks between Remus and Sirius that they obviously thought were sly and discreet, but it was obvious from a mile off that they idolised each other. In the picture of them all on the day that they left Hogwarts, James had his arms wrapped around Lily, kissing her wetly on the cheek. Peter was stood Proudly at the side of them with Mary, Marlene and Dorcas next to him. Mary had her hand around Marlene’s waist and Dorcas had her hand on Marlene’s shoulder. Remus and Sirius stood on the end, holding hands and obviously lost in one another. There were more pictures of the group from that day, some individual one and some with other friends. Harry had one of his parents with Neville’s parents and he’s made a copy of it and given it to him. The next set of pictures were post-Hogwarts. There were some from his mother and father’s wedding; a glorious mix up of Indian and western traditions were depicted in them. One of his favourite pictures was from when he was born. Remus was carefully holding the tiny baby Harry, smiling widely at the camera. Sirius had his arm thrown around Remus’ shoulders, but he wasn’t looking at the camera. It was as though he couldn’t take his eyes off Remus with baby Harry nestled into his arms. Sirius looked like the proudest, happiest man alive at that point.
“You were not ready,” Dumbledore says impatiently. He sits down on the edge of his desk, restless. “I did not want to burden you with this until absolutely necessary.”
But some nights Draco does dream, and for a moment he glimpses this other world, and he wonders which one he would really prefer. What would Harry be like if he was the Boy Who Lived and never knew it?
“You don’t have to apologize.”
Harry releases his wrists. They fall against each other with short starts of movement, an arm sliding forward, a leg scooting over, while their mouths find each other carefully, slowly, searchingly. Their mouths make very subtle sounds which cause Harry’s whole body to squirm. His eyes have clouded over, but then he realizes it’s just his glasses. He pulls away, averting his eyes, and takes his glasses off. Draco’s hand is still lingering at his waist.
Draco rolls his eyes with a fond smile. “I was going to say sexy but go ahead and spoil the mood.” He wraps the blanket around himself tighter. “It is rather cold, though.”
Healing with Madame Pomfrey
The student body exits the train and moves towards the castle in a hush, even the First Years do not speak as Professor Hagrid rounds them into the boats. Everyone else is pulled in their carriages by the thestrals down the country road and up to the castle gates.
He rings the doorbell, hoping he will not dump the Greek salad he had for dinner right before Harry’s feet. What’s taking him so long? He arrived a few minutes late as it is.
Who could it be?
She smiles tightly. “No.” A sigh. “I tried. It just isn’t what I need.” A vision of blue eyes and long, blonde hair flows past before Harry squeezes her hand.
“I thought I’d find you here.” It’s Ginny, though Harry can barely see her.
Harry stares at the bottom of the tower, at the green grass below that suddenly darkens and expands into a bottomless pit. What awaits him?
Hermione blushes this time, and nods. “Actually, yes.”
Harry has found that Eighth Year parties are more amusing than Gryffindor parties, but for that very same reason, the stakes are higher.
“What’s she doing with Dean?” Ron asks, sounding horrified. “Harry?”
“Yes, Pansy?”
Even then, Dumbledore had rarely been around. And if Harry went back now, he would be painfully reminded that Dumbledore would never be around again.
“You said you wanted to keep this a secret,” Harry said slowly.
Harry doesn’t know what to say. She gives him a look full of pity, and he suddenly hates her for it. He wishes he had never kissed her, had never touched her, that she had never moved in with them, that this whole fucked up mess never happened.
“You two and complicated,” Hermione says wryly. “You know, I never understood why you two broke up, in Sixth Year. It didn’t make sense. I thought maybe you didn’t want to tell me, being Harry’s friend and all.”
Harry ignores him, watching Malfoy from the other side of the room weave through the crowd that has grown significantly larger as more and more students trickle down to the dungeons. Malfoy avoids looking at Harry directly, addressing Pansy alone.
Then he remembers his Potions exam tomorrow, and with his mouth curling in disgust, Harry trudges back to the Gryffindor tower. Someday he will find out what Draco is hiding from him.
There’s not many, but it will have to do. She makes a note to investigate the matter later in her Pensieve.
With a hesitant smile and a nod, Draco takes the parcel gingerly in his hands. The magical binding glimmers momentarily, then fades. Draco nods again, then starts towards the door.
A minute later, they did.
Mrs Malfoy looks startled and ashamed. It does not fit her aristocratic features, and Harry’s stomach twists uncomfortably. He regrets his comment, though he meant every word.
Suddenly an insistent clinking noise echoes and quiets the dinner guests, and Hermione realizes with a belated horror that Harry has stood up, his glass in one hand, a dessert spoon in the other. He looks serious, and his eyes roam swiftly around the room to avoid eye contact.
Draco fists the bedsheets in his hands, pressing his head back into the mattress, shutting his eyes tightly. He feels a fingertip grazing his opening, then pushing inside, and his legs tremble with the mixture of pleasure and pain. Harry takes more of him in his mouth, while he fucks Draco with his finger, and then another.
“For Death Eaters.”
“I didn’t follow you, if that’s what you’re wondering.” Harry takes a step closer, never taking his eyes off Draco. “I’m waiting for Hermione and Ron to join me. Thought I’d...browse, as well. I was thinking of checking out a book on Magical Artifacts. Any recommendations?” Harry smiles at him, and despite it all, Draco can’t help but think it’s dazzling in its cunning.
“I have kissed someone before.”
“You can say yes, darling, I don’t mind,” Draco had said, lightly teasing the waistband of Harry’s briefs open. Harry groaned with his teeth clenched. He glanced at Pansy, taking in her body, all of her, and nodded quickly, closing his eyes briefly and opening them again.
A flicker of approval appears and quickly fades in Hermione’s eyes. “I would like to buy a pantsuit. Something functional but still…”
“She’s doing fine,” Harry mutters, looking into the fire crossly.
They kiss one last time, sweetly, before Draco settles his head on Harry’s stomach, still breathing fast, still flushed and vibrant and alive. Harry traces patterns on Draco’s skin, and it spells out love.
Draco had bit his lip. “It’s nothing. I should go.” He slid out of bed, avoiding Harry’s searching gaze, slipping on his clothes from the night before.
“I don’t understand. Did you not love her at all? How can you simply not care?”
Harry threw his head back in exhaustion, panting, his curls damp on his forehead. He felt the absence of Draco’s mouth, and then he was lying beside him again, his body radiating heat in waves.
“It wasn’t a choice for me,” Draco says in a low voice, trying to keep the bubbling anger and fear from all those years ago from rising up in his throat. He swallows, suddenly self conscious. “He forced me to choose, when I didn’t want to.”
“Please,” Harry whispers, then moans when Malfoy shifts his knee closer between Harry’s legs. “Draco, please.”
“You hammer us about reading all day long, and now that he’s reading, you tell him not to!” Ron exclaims. “Leave the poor boy alone.”
Draco cups Harry’s face in his hand, but the contact is too much. Harry leans back on his heels, looking away. He tries to find the words, and it is laborious.
“Have you told Albus?” she asks, though Harry’s sure she already knows the answer.
This time it’s Hermione who blushes.
Harry rolls his neck, the joints popping. Power rolls down his back like a snake rippling tall, ready to strike. “Tell me,” he says in a low voice, so broken and deep it doesn’t sound like his, “that you will not kill him. Promise me that you will find another way.”
Dumbledore waits, then nods. “Right then. I called you here to go on a mission with me. A very dark, dangerous mission, no doubt about it, and I would spare you if I could. As it is, I cannot do this alone, and there is no other person in this world that I trust as much as you.”
And when they kiss, she thinks that maybe it could work, maybe they could be this for each other, they could be something more, and everything would be alright. Her body yearns for him, she feels her legs widening as if in anticipation, and she slips out of her robe, her body saying,
“And you’re back late,” Pansy replies.
Harry takes in a shaky breath, pulling back. His eyes are rimmed red, and he looks so beautiful and so broken Ginny’s heart pangs.
Harry grips the front of Draco’s robes and roughly draws him closer, silencing his protests with an unyielding kiss. And it’s like water breaking through a dam; the tension drains from Draco’s body like he’s taken off all his armor, leaning pliantly into Harry’s touch, his mouth melting like butter against Harry’s tongue.
Hermione pushes a cup of tea across the counter. “You should be careful, Harry.”
Ron raises an eyebrow at her, but she ignores him. Harry doesn’t listen to flattery and charm; he automatically weeds out those attempts of conversation, used to a life of fame and superficial adoration. No, this time Hermione has decided to get straight to the point, and will waste no time trying to cater to Harry’s feelings when he never appreciates it.
Harry doesn’t reply. He sits up, though, and crosses his arms over his knees, hugging them to his chest. Ron can’t tell if he cares or not.
Ginny lets the curtain fall, and with a sinking feeling in her stomach, hurries out of the boy’s dormitories. Before she falls asleep, Ginny prays. Not to any god or goddess, but to Harry, wherever he is on this cold night.
“I guess for the longest time I thought that would never be possible for me. That I would die before I could even think about kids.” Harry pauses, pensive. “And I did die, at the battle.”
“Draco,” Harry warns, but it’s no use. Draco’s hands are already weaving in his hair, and their lips collide in a confusion of knees slipping between legs, hands sliding between skin and fabric, their bodies entwining with such force and desperation it’s like Harry is back in Sixth Year lost in a moment he knew would never last. Draco's mouth is warm and soft and everything he remembers it to be—
Harry’s head hurt. He felt nauseous, his muscles were screaming and he was laid in a puddle of his own sweat. Panic made him able to force his eyes open and he looked around for Malfoy, wondering what he’d done to him, but the motion made it feel like the world was spinning. His heart was racing, as though he’d just been sprinting.
“Well if it isn’t my little angel! Want to come and help granddaddy in the garden?” She giggled, taking his hand and following him out into the garden. Molly huffed, acting indignant, but the smile that was on here face gave her away. She loved watching Arthur with Lucy.
Enjoy some warm fuzzies :)
The rain slowed steadily as Harry finished his cup of tea, nestled in the reading nook by the bay windows in the front room. He flicked his eyes to the door as Hermione walked into the room. She let him know that Molly was putting the food out on the table for dinner, then went to find everyone else. Ron was already in the kitchen, helping Molly set the table. He’d grown very fond of cooking after leaving Hogwarts and it was something that he loved doing alongside his mother. They’d made a pea and mint soup with fresh bread and pavlova with home grown berries for after. The family emerged from where they’d been working and relaxing and filed into the kitchen. They’d finally extended it using plans that Ron had drawn up the summer before. It made it much easier to fit everyone in and gave Molly more space to cook. It also had a magically enhanced pantry that kept each item of food in the specific conditions it needed to be in. The table and benches extended or shrunk depending on how many people needed to sit on it and spills magically disappeared. It was also fire resistant, which came in handy when Dean and Seamus stayed with them for a couple of months while their house was being finished.
“But Malfoy…”
Harry stared at the letter for a while. The word ‘Draco’ stood out to him and made him feel weird. He’d signed his last letter to Malfoy ‘Harry’, but that was just out of habit. Had Malfoy signed his letter using his first name because Harry had done the same? Would Malfoy expect him to call him Draco? Or would they be ‘Mr Potter’ and ‘Mr Malfoy’ to one another? He supposed they would develop some familiarity with each other if they were going to be working together. He said the word out loud and it even felt weird on his tongue as he said it. He couldn’t ever imagine calling Malfoy ‘Draco’, especially not to his face. He sighed and shook his head, writing in his response that the next day would be fine, and he would see him then.
Ginny was the last person to enter the kitchen. She was wearing A tank top and shorts; her muscles twisting and tensing as she moved. Her waist length red hair was scraped back into a messy bun that flopped as she plopped herself down onto the bench next to Harry.
“It’s going to be awesome. You both deserve it.” Ron hugged him back and when they pulled away from one another, they were both misty eyed. The rest of their breakfast they spent talking about what else needed doing for the wedding and talking to other people as they went in and out of the kitchen for breakfast or more caffeine.
“Whatever. Just don’t let mum see you like this. She’ll freak.” Ginny said and went out to train. Harry stared out of the window again. A letter came from Blaise at around nine that morning. Harry untied it from Pig’s leg and fed the overexcited bird a treat. Pig took the treat and nestled back down into the fruit bowl.
“Don’t look so startled, Potter. I’m just here to drop these papers off for Hermione and pick some other ones up off her. You do remember that we work together, right?” Harry nodded and pulled himself back together.
“Calm down Harry, you’re alright.” The soft French accent calmed him somewhat, and Fleur laid a cool cloth on his forehead.
“Look mate, please don’t let anyone else know because I don’t want to take anything away from Bill and Fleur’s big day but me and Hermione have some news and we wanted you to be the first to know.” Ron was smiling so wide Harry was worried that his face would break. “We’re having a baby! Well, Hermione is having a baby. We found out the day before the wedding, she’s about seven weeks gone.”
“Sorry, Charles.” Ginny retorted, earning a hair ruffle from the older Weasley. The three of them sat drinking and chatting for a while. Harry had never spent much time around Charlie when he was younger, but the more he got to know him, the more he realised what a down to earth, pleasant person he was. He showed Harry and Ginny his new tattoo. It was of an origami dragon that slowly folded its wings in and out. The lines were so precise that it amazed Harry, and Ginny asked where he’d had it done.
Harry woke up early the next day without anyone having to wake him. He knew that everyone would already be up, so he put on some music and started preparing his area and turning it into a makeshift salon. He also made sure there was space for Cho to set up when she got there. They’d decided that it would be easier for people if they were set up near each other. When he’d finished sorting the room out, he went downstairs to see what was on offer for breakfast. It was a similar spread to the day before and Harry loaded his plate up, conversing amicably with the other people that were moving in and out of the kitchen. He took his plate of food and cup of tea back up to his room so he wasn’t taking up space in the kitchen; the charms really were being tested to their limits with the amount of people that were in the room. Ginny joined him not long after, shovelling granola with oat milk and fruit into their mouth and nursing a mug of strong black coffee.
We get to see what some of the gang have been up to since Hogwarts! This chapter is a little longer.
Yours,
Harry couldn’t work out whether the letter was genuine or if Malfoy was being sarcastic. He sighed and rubbed his temples, handing the letter to Ginny to read. He told her that he didn’t think he would be attending another meeting with Malfoy.
“This cider is to die for, Arthur.” Hermione’s dad, Christopher, wrapped a large, muscular arm around Arthur’s shoulders. Christopher towered over Arthur, but he was one of the sweetest, jovial people that Harry knew. Jenny, Hermione’s mother, rolled her eyes at her husband.
I am so sorry I have been away for so long- I got really sick and then work has been manic. IF you're still here, thank you! If not, I understand.
“Dude, you’ve been obsessed with him since I’ve known you.”
“Ready?” He asked, going to get his clippers and scissors from his cupboard.
Bill and Fleur arrived just after all the breakfast things had been cleared away. The heat had come back with a vengeance and Fleur looked like she was melting with her huge baby bump. A gigantic smile kept breaking out on Bill’s face every time he looked at her. Fleur was on Maternity Leave from her position as a healer at St Mungo’s and she was due to give birth a couple of weeks after Ron and Hermione’s wedding. When they’d told the family, Molly could barely contain her excitement. She’d already knitted the baby enough clothes for the first year of its existence. Harry chatted with the family for a while, enjoying the busy hustle and bustle of people having several different conversations at once, people flitting in and out of the kitchen doing jobs and Bill and Fleur’s Basset Hound Philippe playing with Charlie’s Central Asian Shepherd Hound Lara.
“I’m so sorry.” Audrey said after a while. She got up and left the room too. Harry looked around at the others before getting up to go and check on Ginny.
“I’ve always thought that would be a good career for you, mate.” Ron commented as he passed Harry a bacon sandwich.
“Gin’s been getting a lot of letters recently,” Ron remarked, looking up from the sketch book in front of him and tucking a pencil behind his ear. “I wonder who they’re from.”
“It looks so soft. Can I touch it?” Asked Charlie. His hand was quickly batted away.
“I am. There’s been so much to plan, but I’ve been so thankful for my mum and Molly helping with the organisation. They’ve been stars.”
“Since Hermione was a young girl, we tried to instil in her a sense of independence and a trust in herself. We wanted her to be strong, but we still wanted her to know that we would be here to support her no mater what. I’m sure you all know the wonderful things that Hermione has done throughout her life and I know you will all agree with me that she is an amazing young woman with a spectacular future in front of her. We never wanted her to feel like her value was measured by the person that she was dating if she chose to date anyone. We wanted her to know that a relationship was a partnership and we wanted whoever she chose to share those same values. Ron is more than we could have ever wished for. We can all see how much they love each other and they’re perfect for one another. We know that Ron will cherish Hermione and they will both support one another in whatever they want to do. We wish them the best and a long and happy future together, as I’m sure it will be. To Mr Weasley and Mrs Granger, the newlyweds” Everyone clapped as Christopher sat back down.
Harry read over the letter a few more times before he sent it off with Pig. He made himself another cup of tea and settled down in the reading nook to half read-half nap and enjoy the sun coming through the window. He kept checking the sky, looking for signs of Pig. He was worried about the meeting with Malfoy, but he supposed Ginny was right. If Malfoy could be professional, so could he. He wondered who else Malfoy had worked with and what their experience of working with him was like. Ginny seemed to know a little bit about Malfoy’s work so he decided to ask them after they’d finished training. When the letter from Malfoy arrived, Harry’s stomach flipped a little. He read it quickly.
“Well let’s talk about you, Mr Potter. Swooning so Mr Malfoy had to sweep you off your feet and rescue you. I never thought The Chosen One would play the damsel in distress to get a guy.” Harry felt himself blushing furiously, his heart racing.
Ginny was buzzing with nervous energy next to Harry. They’d decided that Harry was going to cut their hair the next day. They were going for a style that was short at the sides with some length at the top so they could style it if they wanted to. It was currently tied up in its usual messy bun and Harry couldn’t wait to get his hands on it. Ginny had spoken to Hermione about it, worried that the drastic change would detract attention from her at the wedding and put it on Ginny instead. Hermione had just smiled and wrapped Ginny in a hug, assuring them that they should do whatever made them comfortable. Harry could tell that Ginny was worried about how her family would react. Harry knew that they had no reason to be. They’d all been perfectly accepting when Charlie had come out as gay and then later on as asexual, but he could also understand Ginny’s fears. They’d also been the only little girl of the family for a long time. Ginny was also super nervous about the upcoming trials for the Holyhead Harpies. They’d been training non-stop since they’d been asked to try out the previous month. The try-outs were still a month off, but Ginny wanted to position of Chaser so badly that all of their fiery determination had been poured into practicing and training. Harry reached under the table and squeezed their hand, shooting them a small smile, and they seemed to calm down a fraction. Ginny jumped slightly as an owl tapped frantically on the kitchen window. It was Pig with a letter. They ran over to the window to let the frantic owl in and carefully untied the letter before giving the tiny owl a treat and rushing upstairs.
The Burrow was quite quiet by the time he got back. It was half three in the afternoon. Molly was knitting (she’d made an early start on the jumpers this year), Arthur was out in the garden and Ginny was doing some in-between practice reading in the kitchen. The try outs were approaching quickly and Ginny had a nervous energy about her. He said that she wanted to get as much practice and reading in as she could before tea, as Luna would be joining them for food and then staying over that evening.
“Oh.” Harry’s cheeks burn. He feels betrayed, but not on account of the lying. “I didn’t know.”
“And why should healing be easy?” Miss Lovegood asks, cocking her head at Harry.
“Well, not quite, but I do not mind in the slightest,” Harry says, attempting to be cheerful. The rest of them look at him, including Mr Weasley, who lowers his Daily Prophet. “This is all for the best. I am sure the Headmistress had good reason not to accept me.”
“Yes, Harry, very strange.”
“What about Draco?” Pansy asks with her usual chilly aloofness. Hermione frowns.
All those years ago she had written it off as a trick of the light.
That night Draco fucked Harry and it was the best sex they ever had.
“I just said things were different now because of my public persona. Imagine what people would say if they knew I secretly dated a Death Eater.”
“I need you,” Harry says, choked, “It happened. It’s all ended. The world is ending. I need you. I promised. I need you now. Help me. I need you. I need you…”
“He doesn’t want that?” Hermione asks, sounding a little sad. She wasn’t exactly surprised to hear this. Harry had always been reserved and isolated, though always charming even if it was cold and slightly hostile. On his good days, she could imagine a future for him with a wife and kids, but on the bad days…
Draco has gone deathly pale, staring at Harry with an odd, yet almost familiar expression Hermione can’t quite place. What on earth happened between them, Hermione wonders, to elicit such strong reactions?
“No, I don’t laugh.”
Soon Harry can’t resist and he kisses Draco again with more force, his tongue sinking deep into the warmth of Draco’s mouth, their limbs seeming to tangle and grip with a bruising strength, as if just kissing deep enough, long enough, touching everywhere at once, burning everywhere at once, will somehow unite them, make them one and the same torrential force of nature, this embodiment of desire that pulses at the core of everything.
Draco was still panting and Harry laughed.
“No,” Harry decides finally. “It was never really hate.”
Harry flushes angrily, and Hermione notices Ginny sneaking another curious glance at Harry. “
“I can’t forgive either.”
“But,” Ginny continues, “I’m also telling you this because I can’t save you this time Harry. I have Luna, and Luna has me, and sometimes, Harry, you have to save yourself. I love you, Harry, but it’s time you learn to love yourself.”
Hermione leans sadly against Ron’s shoulder, her eyes rimmed red. There are thousands of witches and wizards from all over the world gathered on the shore of the lake, all in somber black cloaks and with grim faces.
“Me too.” He looks down at his clothes, and grimaces. “I had a bit too much to drink and—let’s just say I didn’t wake up in my own bed. But the moment I saw the time I rushed over here.” He looks at the mug of coffee in his hand, frowning. “Clearly.”
Slughorn struggles between a smile and a frown. “Well, I, uh—class dismissed.”
“Then what? They never got along in school.”
“Like what?”
“Look who it is,” Weasley mutters, looking across the platform. Harry and Miss Granger turn their heads to see Mrs Malfoy and her son huddled together a few paces from the train, clearly having a tense conversation.
Draco’s is thin and sharp where the knuckles are, and his grip is tight, demanding.
Hermione smiles, trying to hide her pity. The war never truly ends, after all. “Yes, I’m sure.”
Mr Longbottom stands before Harry can object. “Mr Potter, sir.”
“I have to be at the Ministry,” Draco says in a single breath, and without waiting for Harry to say another word, he Apparates.
Draco studies Harry’s face, almost expectant, like he knows that there is a potion but wants Draco to suggest it first. When he realizes what Harry is asking, Draco shakes his head before he even speaks.
Parkinson looks at him with a smirk of her own. “Draco, darling, come here!”
Then suddenly the same thought occurs to both Hermione and Ron simultaneously, and they both look to Harry, as if only now remembering his recent non-break up with Ginny.
Harry slides Draco’s briefs down, and Draco’s cock springs free, hardening under Harry’s touch. Harry kisses the tip, then takes it all in his mouth, his cheeks hollowing. He looks at Draco from underneath his lashes, and it takes all of Draco’s self restraint not to lift his hips and fuck Harry’s mouth, those reddened lips that slide up and down his shaft.
“Hear me out.” Ginny takes a deep breath, looking directly into Harry’s eyes, the exact color of the Quidditch pitch on a bright summer day. “I’m not in love with you, Harry. But if you gave yourself to me, I would too. I would give you my heart if you ever asked, if you ever needed me to.”
“We need to know the layout of the manors before we raid,” Shacklebolt says in his deep, soothing voice, clearly trying to pacify the situation. He looks keenly between Harry and Malfoy. “Malfoy understands the nature of these manors, having grown up in one and having regularly visited many others.”
“But we still have a lot of questions,” Hermione says quickly, not wanting to get off track. Harry raises a brow at her. “I remembered you told me that you were in love with someone during Sixth Year, but you dated Ginny by the end of the year, and I forgot all about it.”
“Oh really?”
“I know,” Luna says simply, sweetly, smoothly. Her voice is like a beacon of truth, a light cutting a clear path through the darkness. She returns to examining her Quibbler. “When you’re ready, I’ll be here.”
Draco nods dumbly, and let’s Harry lead him up the stairs and into his bedroom. The moment Draco’s head hits the pillow, he falls asleep, silently as Harry remembers, and with a small frown between his brows. Harry allows himself one last look before going back downstairs to sleep on the couch.
“Yes.”
Harry looks around the bar, as if he might find inspiration. As he scans the faces at the opposite side of the bar, he notices a certain blonde getting chatted up by a very buff, very shirtless man with dark buzzed hair.
“But I would take the book, if you’re offering,” Draco says, clearly attempting to change the subject. Harry holds out the book, and after a moment, Draco strides over, his robes twisting and curling around his ankles like a dark frothing sea, and grabs the book, pressing it under his arm possessively.
Pansy sneaks glances at him, probably waiting for him to break down. But he won’t this time around. He can live without Harry. He knows that well.
Harry looks up at him from the section of the kitchen counter that is not being used by his potions equipment. He’s smiling, but the dark circles under his eyes and the way his curls stick up from one side suggest he didn’t sleep that well.
“It doesn’t seem like nothing.” Lucy comes over to Harry and holds out her hand, and he takes it like he used to when he was a small child. Her hands are warm and leathery, wrinkled from work and age, but they bring Harry back to long, ceaseless nights alone in that little cottage, deep in the woods he doesn’t even know the name of for his own protection, sitting by the fire as Lucy sang him a song or read him a bed time story.
“Fuck it.”
“I can’t believe it,” Ron says angrily. “Right where anyone can see!”
“I was a witness,” Harry says. “I was only telling the truth.”
Draco nods, his mind briefly remembering the unfinished Sad Nightingale in his kitchen, feeling relieved that at least one option was unavailable. “I guessed that much. His speech at Christmas was…”
“Well?”
Beneath his hands the railing begins to crumble, turning to ash and floating away. Harry leans over, but doesn’t fall. He wants to fall. He has a reason to fall.
Finally, Harry said, “She kissed you!”
“And why wouldn’t you?”
He rolls his eyes. “I’m not.”
While Ron and Hermione’s home felt warm and cozy and distinctly theirs, Harry’s flat in a more central, urban part of London gives off a dull, colorless aura, and Ginny has no trouble identifying the rigid, cookie cutter magic as Ministry issued.
They stay silent for a few beats, staring at each other. Draco averts his eyes first, sighing.
* * *
She smiles, but it only hurts. “So are you, Harry Potter.”
him to next Monday for this.
“Have you looked at your schedules yet?” Miss Granger asks, then sighs when she catches the alarmed faces of her companions. “Of course not. Both of you should look at your schedules immediately and mark your classes.”
“Thank you,” he says, reluctantly. “You’re one of a kind, Ginny Weasley.”
“I mean, if it’s what she wants, shouldn’t I be happy for her?” Harry replies, with his unfailing logic that always makes Hermione annoyed because it seems to miss the point entirely.
* * *
He wonders if this is love.
“Then distract him. He won’t punish you.” And even to Harry’s ears he sounds desperate.
“It’s cold without it,” Draco observes, and as if instinctively craving warmth, he moves closer to Harry. Their arms brush, but neither move away.
“Well, it’s—”
Harry raises an eyebrow, and Draco blushes. “I remember us kissing twice.”
Hermione’s attention perks up. “Harry? What did he say?”
Harry Potter. Of all people.
"Hey," Draco said, but it came out soft and low. He couldn't manage a smile to ease away the awkwardness. Harry patted Draco’s arm, who felt startled at such a casual gesture and then annoyed to see Harry leaving, which only annoyed him more.
“I did think she and Zabini made a lovely couple,” Hermione muses.
A faint Lumos lights the way through the darkness of the castle. He doesn’t even care if he gets caught, just wanting to find Draco and to understand, to no longer be in the dark. He takes the staircases two steps at a time, his temples glistening with sweat, and his legs aching from such sudden movement.
Harry approaches the stairwell to the Headmaster’s office, and says the password before entering. His heart beats ever so faster as it always does before speaking with his father.
"The one he always talks about."
Ginny sighs. “You know why.”
He looks away with a frown. “Nothing, really.”
This gives Harry pause. He mulls it over, reflecting on all his years at Hogwarts so far, pictures Draco in First Year and on, each year getting colder and quieter and withdrawn, less boyish and pretentious and mean.
“Let me guess, you need a pair of stilettos to go with the outfit?”
Ron blushes. “I just never fancied you as that type of girl, I suppose.”
“This will pass, Harry. And you will be happy together, without me.”
Ginny shakes her head, her hair tickling Harry’s cheek, a whisper of the past. “I don’t believe that.”
“Pansy?”
Draco flushed. “I suppose not. I’m not attracted to women. But Pansy is Pansy. She’s the most beautiful woman I know.”
“Mrs. Granger? Is this a bad time?”
Ginny’s mouth parts as if in a subconscious reaction to her thoughts. Luna smiles, as if understanding her realization.
As his breaths became pants and the black behind his eyelids exploded in color, Draco decided he had known for all his life.
Harry looks sharply over his shoulder, arms gone still around Draco, and sees Katie Bell from the Gryffindor Quidditch team staring at them in shock. Harry looks at Draco, who looks back at him with wild eyes before whipping his wand out and pointing it at Katie before she has time to react. Harry doesn’t make any move to stop him.
Harry continues down the dark hallway, turning and taking two flights of stairs, jumping the last three steps when the staircase begins to move. He supposes he could have brought his Invisibility Cloak, but then again, what could anyone say if he got caught?
to separate?”
you to be careful.”
Harry grips Draco’s waist, his thumbs skimming over his sharp hip bones. Draco hums into his mouth, and drapes forward, kissing him deeper, wider, opening up to Harry like a flower facing the sun. Harry takes all of it, he pulls Draco closer, wishing them to be pressed together, against each other, flush and hot and—and he doesn’t know what else, has not envisioned it yet.
Well, she has to assume one day she’ll find out who it is, when this will all be over and their current dramas will become vague memories that get lost in time when more drama arises.
“Then stop.”
“Fine.” Pansy crosses her arms. “She’s worried that he might...hurt himself.”
“Draco,” a voice calls out behind him.
“I think you’re lots of things,” Draco replies very steadily. “Thief being one of them.”
“....we can only wait...called...maybe…”
Harry’s voice is hollow. “We can’t be together. I thought...but I always knew, deep down, that it couldn’t last.”
“Still, it’s good that you guys are friends again.”
She could only hope Harry would make it out alive.
Nobody has an answer for that.
“Oh, Ginny,” Hermione says, almost in relief, getting up to hug Ginny, as if both happy to see her and grateful for a break from the tantrum. “I’m so glad you could come by. I know you and Luna are on a tight schedule.”
He has already chosen.
“At least stay for tea,” Hermione adds.
“Harry—”
“The Malfoy Manor.” A ghost of a smile appears on Hermione’s face. “He wanted the rights to burn it down.”
For a moment they break apart, and Draco’s eyes are lidded and dark. “Your glasses.” He reaches up and with trembling hands, removes Harry’s glasses, setting them carefully on the counter beside him. In the faint glow of Harry’s Lumos Draco’s face is a pale blur.
“Maybe,” Ron begins, then stops. “If Harry’s there…” He trails off again, and looks hopelessly at Hermione. Ginny looks at Hermione too, a sense of defiance washing over her like armor.
Of course, perhaps it’s easier to accept darkness in others when you have it in yourself. Is that why they gravitate so helplessly towards each other? Two twin flames burning brighter, dangerously brighter, together? He remembers looking at the Dark Mark, a black bruise against pale skin, and thinking that they were the same, that he had that Mark tattooed on his heart instead of his skin.
Harry watches with a trained, casual eye as Snape offers the role of discipline, which Harry finds incredibly suspicious, and when they march swiftly out of the party and Slughorn attempts to restore the party atmosphere, Harry slips away quietly.
Then Draco gasps, suddenly, and Harry grips his waist, pulling him in deeper, finding a rhythm, the ebb and flow, his body connected to Draco’s body, their pulses beating at the same pace, the pulse in Harry’s mouth hot and smooth. And Harry listens to Draco groan, then sigh, then shudder, against him, his hands taking Harry’s hair in his fists and pulling, he feels Draco’s legs nearly give, and he marvels at his power, at his knowledge, in this position, the gateway into another soul, into intimacy with another beating heart.
Will Harry still love him when the whole world hates him?
“Never go into comedy, then.” Harry cracks a grin when Ginny laughs. “Want a glass?”
Draco tries to stand up and follow after Harry, but he sways the moment he’s on his feet, and Harry rushes over to hold him steady. “Thank you,” Draco says quietly, but he looks dejected.
After a rustling of clothes and shadows playing across the floor of a suggested figure and clothes pooling at the ankles, Hermione walks out wearing the champagne pink pant suit.
He shakes his head slowly, his head spinning as it always does when Luna’s words can mean one thing and another at the same time, and Luna’s gentle smile gives nothing away.
As it happens, Harry has only ever known these tame Gryffindor parties until returning for an Eighth Year at Hogwarts, where inter-house unity has been highly encouraged, and so, predictably, each House has taken a turn hosting a large party
“I suspect we must make a quick reply,” Mrs Weasley says. She breaks the seal with shaking hands. “‘Dear Mr and Mrs Weasley, as the rightful guardians of Mr Ron B. Weasley, as well as the temporary guardians of Mr Harry J. Potter and Miss Hermione J. Granger, I send this letter to provide some important information.’ From the Minister himself, just think! Oh, my poor nerves!”
The large room is almost pitch black. It only takes a moment for them to realize why.
The lecture begins, and nothing else out of the ordinary occurs. Slughorn chatters on and on, following the textbook orderly, and the students dutifully take notes. Or at least some of them, Hermione thinks, watching Ron twirl his pencil and sneak discrete glances at younger Hermione.
However, upon closer inspection, Harry doesn’t seem to be looking at the Map at all, instead staring off into space as if deep in thought. She had noticed this introspective behavior increasing as of late, but had chalked it up to a few sleepless nights over those memories Dumbledore keeps showing him.
Harry smiles, but his heart aches. “I do know. But it doesn’t make it hurt any less.”
Harry rakes his eyes over Draco unapologetically, and Draco flushes.
It turns out that he needs much more than that. Harry stumbled into his life right when he decided he had enough of it. The Wizarding World could scarcely look at him, many openly hated him, and too often he was nearly assaulted on the streets. But Harry looked at him and spoke to him and soon enough they were inseparable, and indeed, Draco could not live without him.
It’s more than Harry could have hoped, had dared to dream. He burns from the inside out as Draco groans his name when Harry’s hands slide firmly down his sides, gripping him from behind. While never taking his mouth away from Draco’s, Harry walks Draco backwards until his legs hit the counter top, and Draco buckles in Harry’s arms, and Harry has to hoist him up almost limp onto the edge.
The spell cracks like electricity in the air without Harry saying a word, and really he never thought of a spell, and it flies like a lightning bolt across the bathroom, hitting a nearby sink and exploding, causing water to gush out of a broken pipe onto the floor.
Blaise smirks. “He’s been best friends with you and yet he’s never made a move? Impossible. He had to be gay. You’re too irresistible, not to mention funny.” Blaise pauses to kiss her lips slowly before pulling away and murmuring, “And smart.” He kisses the hollow of her neck, and she muffles a nervous laugh. “Ambitious.” Pansy turns onto her back as Blaise kisses a path down her stomach. “Honest, even if it hurts.” His mouth travels past her navel, his tongue darting expertly as one hand settles on her inner thigh, shifting her legs over his shoulders, the other easing a finger inside her. “And, of course, loving.”
Sorrows fade, new hopes grow, and the sun rises every morning and sets every night. Draco does not pretend to believe in fantasies he no longer has the luxury to enjoy. Sometimes a smile is all you get, and if you keep busy looking at the horizon for something bigger, something better, you’ll end up missing it.
Hermione nods, grabbing the shirt from Pansy’s hands, apparently too stunned to speak. She goes into the dressing room and closes the door. A minute late she reemerges in the black pant suit, and Pansy tilts her head, examining her.
A few months ago, Pansy moved in, which was also when Harry and Draco made their relationship official. Hermione and Ron are skeptical of the whole affair, especially the suspicious arrival of Pansy on the scene, and perhaps more secretly, of the sexuality of everyone involved.
Then Draco moves towards him, as if in answer to his question, curling his body around Harry’s, and looking up at him with a grave face.
“No?”
The shop smells of burned incense and wet wood. The latter might be explained by the heavy downpour that struck London out of nowhere earlier this morning, though the small room is quite underground. Perhaps to keep away from prying Ministry eyes.
Draco rolls his eyes, then looks at Harry shrewdly. “Were you eavesdropping?”
Harry tried not to watch as Draco accidentally pulled too hard and the scarf came undone, revealing a black tattoo—the edge of a bird’s wing, Harry thought—peeking from underneath the collar of his t-shirt.
for Minister...She’s still so young, and there’s so much to do on the ground after the war, and then not to mention Rose.
For a moment neither of them speak, then Ron clears his throat.
“What are you doing?” Harry asks, and Draco jumps, cursing, then relaxing when he sees it’s Harry.
Harry looks up, startled. He blinks at Ron, as if the question has dumbfounded him.
“Then how can I possibly be taking advantage of you if you
“You can die,” he protests.
“Whatever,” Draco said, flushed. He wasn’t going to beg, Harry knew well. His pride was already hurting. “Do what you want. But don’t pretend that this is real.”
Sometimes Harry wonders if he has grown the opposite way, from a more pure, innocent child filled with hopes and dreams and friendship, only to face so much death and darkness and evil that he starts to reflect it, to harbor it deep within, to even become it.
Draco felt sick. The tie wrapped around his eyes scuffed his cheeks. He had protested the blindfold, but the others insisted the game would be more entertaining if they knew Draco wouldn't see who came in the closet.
The question nearly makes Harry squirm in his seat as if Snape were about to lecture him. And why should Hermione lecture him about his relationships? It’s not as if her and Ron are perfect, with the unplanned pregnancy after Hermione began working at the Ministry. But Hermione is his friend, and she only wants him to be happy, and, after all, she’s probably right.
“Malfoy,” Harry says without inflection, inclining his head ever so slightly. Draco stares at him and then looks down at his plate, which still has half a blueberry pie on it. Harry must have come right during dessert, which is Ron’s expertise.
Hermione’s stomach clenches, and her heart beats very fast. “Harry…” she starts. “You’re not…?”
“Well, what’s the proof then?” Ron asks daringly.
Ginny sits down next to Harry on the grass, leaning her head against his shoulder. She holds out her hand, and Harry passes her the cigarette. She examines it, before stamping it out in the grass. Harry sighs.
Draco nearly opens his mouth to say just this when Harry goes tense all over, and brings a finger up to his lips, before slowly sitting up, alert. He slips his hand over the side of the bed, grabbing his Cloak. It must had fallen to the ground during the night.
“And just for the record,” Harry says, “I understand your situation with Ron. I know how it feels to want someone you can’t have.”
“Jealous of what?” Pansy asks exasperated. “Honestly, Draco, you know I’m currently hooking up with the hottest boy in this damn school.” A few heads passing in the hallway turn towards her loud claim.
A thread of pleasure so intense it burns white snakes up his spine, spreading across his skin like wild fire, rapid and tingling, so that he must open his eyes to breathe, and he sees Draco frowning in concentration, his hand moving up and down in time with the racing pulse in Harry’s stomach.
Harry stared at Draco, then turned to look at Pansy, who made her way over to them, setting the bottle down on the coffee table. He slowly nodded his head, as if in a trance.
“Morocco. We’re very excited.”
“Perhaps.” Harry walks forward, standing beside Draco, resting his hands on the railing and looking out at the lake, a flat expanse of glassy water sparkling with starlight, hugged close by rolling green hills. “It’s beautiful, isn’t it?”
“Draco, stop.” Harry sees Draco flinch when Harry says his first name, but he stops and turns around reluctantly, arms straight and tense by his sides.
* * *
Harry stares at him, and then turns back to his coffee.
He pulls away, and she looks up at him, almost pleading, her breasts bared before him like an offering.
Red. Orange. A candle chandelier, right above him. Velvet curtains. Pictures, so many pictures, Harry could not see the wallpaper. He saw his dad in some, but mostly they were of Quidditch teams and motorcycles and half-naked girls cut out of both Wizard and Muggle magazines.
“That’s enough, now,” Hermione interrupts, placing a finger on his mouth. Her gaze strays over Ron’s shoulder to where Harry and Malfoy were just moments ago. “Where are Harry and Draco?”
“Remind me again what classes you are taking besides the mandatory ones,” Weasley says to Miss Granger as the three of them walk down Diagon Alley.
“What? Who? It’s not possible,” Hermione says, scrutinizing Harry’s face for any clue as to who this mystery love might be. But his face is as impenetrable as ever.
She kisses his hair, matted with blood and debris. “Harry, love, you need to go to Madame Pomfrey.”
“To other worlds.”
“She can’t possibly—”
Ron and Hermione start to protest that Harry can't possibly tell Dumbledore a bunch of nonsense when Harry’s face goes very still and very pale, and he looks at Ginny with a deadly silence.
“Yes, that’s fine, I trust your judgement, Draco.” Then Hermione pauses, something snagging at her attention. Oh yes! The memory with Draco that had so stumped her. Pansy was with Draco, then. She had always assumed they had been dating, but then she'd heard about Pansy and Blaise. Hermione’d bet a good Galleon that she knows something. “And how is Pansy?”
“The dark spell was covering a basement,” Draco says quietly, pointing to a section of the paper that had been previously burned. “I strongly suspect there will be illegal magical artifacts hidden there.”
Harry cannot look away from Draco’s storming grey gaze.
“Ginny.”
“No!” Draco shouts, and he shoves his arm out, yanking up the sleeve. The Dark Mark ripples a stark inky black against the pale skin of Draco’s forearm. Harry's scar hurts, before he realizes his jaw has clenched so hard that it's just his head throbbing with pain. After all the following, after all the suspicion, to see the evidence in front of his eyes sends a shock wave through Harry.
Charms with Professor Flitwick, highly selective
“Mr Potter,” she says, her voice betraying nothing. “A pleasure.”
Draco’s eyes well with tears, and Harry doesn’t understand. His chest aches, as if someone is squeezing all the air out. He takes a step towards Draco.
Harry’s heart aches, wishing he could explain, but knowing he can’t. He looks down, his face burning at what he doesn’t know, even about his deepest, most delicate desires. “I wish you wouldn’t.”
“No, no, nothing the matter at all,” she says with a forced smile. “I only wanted to say that I know to you, more than most, Hogwarts is home. Thus, I felt it my responsibility as your guardian and as someone who cares deeply for you, to tell you that Hogwarts has suffered tremendously this past year. Please, be patient with her as she heals. But more importantly, be patient as
His head aches. He wishes things were different, but knows he doesn’t mean it. They must let each other go. He knows that more than he knows his own name.
“Good,” Pansy says shortly. She exhales, then pats his arm and kisses his cheek. “Now, can you help me with my Potions essay? You know I’m hopeless in every subject except fashion and looking fabulous.”
“If you had to name all the girls you are attracted to, who would they be?” Blaise asks in his deep, smooth voice that reminds Pansy of a rich red velvet cupcake she once had that actually made her moan out loud.
“How’s Luna?” Harry asks with a slight smirk. Ginny shoves him playfully with her shoulder.
“Loved?” Harry asks incredulously. He laughs derisively. “He was my whole world. I am
“Harry!” Draco hisses, shoving his arm. He looks dead asleep.
Pansy feels that unfamiliar clenching in her stomach that she’s come to recognize as worry. She can see just how far Draco has fallen in such a short time, and she also knows he would rather die than hit the bottom.
Harry looks at all of the food prepared for them, but he cannot find his appetite. All he can think about is where they will live, if not Gryffindor Tower. However, so as to show good breeding, Harry places the appropriate amount of food on his plate and begins to eat.
“You get upset if I don’t see Hagrid, but if I do see Hagrid you get upset anyway!” Ron exclaims, and Hermione whips around fuming, and Harry barely manages to stop before colliding with her.
“You’re quite grave today, Potter,” Draco says, using his last name as an attempt to lighten the mood. They have been lazying on the couch in Harry’s living room, too exhausted after school to game or search for an interesting channel.
“I don’t know,” Draco says, glad to have the spotlight on someone else. “I suppose she always has some fling going on, though she’s never serious about them; she has always been quite reserved about those types of things.”
Hermione smiles half-heartedly. “What kind of duel?”
You know me. You know I’m fucked up and you don’t get scared when I tell you how I feel.”
“You and Ginny would make a great couple,” Ron protests.
Draco smiles, because he cannot speak. Soon Harry drifts to sleep, his brows furrowing as if troubled by something, but his breath levels out, his chest rising and falling like the waves in the ocean, rocking Draco to sleep.
“Harry.” Draco’s eyes plead with him, and Harry looks around, before slipping his arms around Draco’s waist. He kisses the crook of Draco’s neck, inhaling that familiar sharpness of cologne, a scent of wealth and dark money and bitter childhoods. “Harry,” Draco warns, for a completely different reason now.
“It’s okay, it will all be okay,” she whispers, willing him to keep it together.
The door slams open, and Hermione and Draco both jump. She silently curses whoever it is that interrupted them, and then sees it’s Harry, and smiles despite herself.
Ginny sighs, seeing her path unfold like it always does in the things that matter. She knows how to put a brave face and soldier on. Make the right choice, not the easy one.
Draco rolls his eyes. “
“You’re fine fucking a Death Eater as long as no one knows about it, right?” Draco asks harshly, and Harry flinches. It brings a rush of satisfaction, almost triumph if he didn’t feel so hurt, that no one could quite pierce through his Chosen Boy facade except Draco. He alone possessed the power to bring Harry to his knees.
“And would you like to fuck her?”
“So, uh, how is...are classes?” Ron asks Hermione, scratching the back of his neck. She wishes she could know if Ron felt the same way, but every time she gets close to asking, everything crumbles into painful awkwardness like she doesn’t know him at all. Could she simply be missing something glaringly obvious with everyone she thinks she knows so well?
“I am nervous. I didn’t think you would agree to this, and now you’re here.”
“Do you think you could ever be attracted to a boy?” Pansy asks curiously.
“Oh is it Draco now?” Ron mimics, earning him a whack on the shoulder.
Draco and his mother did not serve time in Azkaban, though his father did. They went to France for two years, then returned when Lucius was released. Harry saw him, Pansy, and Blaise walking the streets of London late at night, where he was at a pub with his friends, the usual crowd of Gryffindors, and a few more, as they were celebrating  Ron’s birthday. He called them inside, a little drunk, and they spent the rest of the night catching up, laughing, reminiscing.
“Draco,” Harry says, smiling. “You’re here.” Draco almost mentions how he’s been here for the past ten minutes when he notices the wine glasses at the coffee table, and a nicely laid out cheese platter, and the words die in his throat. Harry’s wearing nice fitted pants and a dress shirt, and his usual unruly hair has been combed through. He even shaved his trademark stubble, and for a heartbeat it’s like looking at Harry as he was in Sixth Year, with the same charm and the same slight coldness but not yet broken, not yet the war hero he has become today.
Some things have to come in their own time.
“The Map never lies.” Harry squeezes his eyes shut, a hand raking through his hair. “I just don’t get it. One second he’s there, the next, gone, as if the Map lost connection to him somehow. But where could he have gone? Some secret passageway the Map doesn't know about?”
Draco wakes up alone.
When he knocks on the door, he hears Dumbledore say, “Come in.”
“I never said you were,” Harry mutters, already forgetting what he said to make Draco so fussy, his attention lowering to Draco’s mouth, slightly parted and ever so close. Draco’s eyes flutter shut, and Harry notices his breaths come out short. Draco curls his arm slowly around Harry’s neck, like he’s still afraid that Harry might resist him.
“Pince?” Ginny shrugs. “Not particularly. Sounds a lot like
“Merlin, you
He looks at Harry sadly. “Nothing is ever that simple.”
Harry helps. He usually wakes to Harry curled behind him, half hard and adorably sleepy, gently caressing Draco’s arm until he’s nearly wide awake and painfully aroused. After they mess around in bed, Harry must shower and dress hurriedly, as he can never refuse helping Weasley and the Aurors with some special operation or Granger and the Ministry with the reforms.
“On the contrary,” Draco says tersely, “you’ll find that for people with nothing left to lose, secrets don’t mean a thing.”
“Look at me, darling,” Draco said. “I want you to look at me as you cum.”
“Oh, right...” Hermione trails off, looking at Ginny and Dean, and how enviously perfect they seem to be together. But maybe they aren’t perfect at all. Hermione remembers her talk with Ginny, and how flippant she had been about Dean.
He hears a rustle of robes behind him, and quickly slips the book back on the shelf.
“Yes.” Draco’s voice is barely a whisper. He clears his throat. “I didn’t want to tell you because there wasn’t much you could help me with.”
“Surprise me, oh dear! Invitations to my very own children, no less!” But Mrs Weasley is hiding a smile now.
Draco’s voice breaks through, a low growl, “...to break it, then, because I don’t need your protection! It’s my job...I’ve got a plan... a bit longer…”
Hermione looks down at the blue memory swirling within the glass. “Possibly. But I don’t think so.”
“I wanted to talk with you,” Harry says calmly, looking around to make sure they aren’t attracting attention. Draco laughs derisively.
He likes to let Harry wait, to make him work for it, just a little. And Pansy makes him work for it. That’s her specialty. And she is beautiful, Draco cannot deny that, especially in sex. Her hips are wide and her legs long and shiny as she expertly straddles Harry. She barely makes a noise, her head lolling to the side, her bare neck a curve of beauty, like a swan, nearly immobile on a glassy lake.
Then Draco was pulling away, and he felt Draco’s mouth on his stomach where his shirt had lifted up. Each kiss was the brief fluttering of a butterfly’s wings, trailing down his skin. A pause. Harry’s hands were released, and fingertips brushed against his crotch, achingly hard inside his briefs.
Then Draco noticed new things in Harry, how he would fail to speak when Pansy addressed him, how his eyes lingered on Pansy’s breasts for a second too long, how he blushed when he saw Pansy walk down in her robe.
“The letter states that we must enroll in nine classes, which leaves six openings for other classes. And it looks like we have...yes, fourteen electives to choose from,” Miss Granger says, looking up at Weasley and Harry expectantly. “Well? Which classes have you two decided to take?”
“You suppose?”
Harry wants to trust him. Desperately.
“Visiting her dad. He gets very sad and lonely when she’s away.”
“Ashamed?”
“What reason does he have to lie if we’re a secret?” Draco asks, confused.
“No,” Pansy says, irritated. “Because you are Draco Malfoy, and that means something.”
“He hates me,” Harry says, his voice choked.
“Just because you’re the smartest witch in the class doesn’t make me an idiot! You act like you’re so much better than me, but I don’t see you with anyone. You’re just lonely and jealous that someone actually loves me,” Ron says, and he knows he went too far the moment the words leave his mouth. Even Harry grimaces.
“Mrs Malfoy,” Harry says, bowing his head stiffly. She inclines her head in return.
“And who’s this punk?” the buff man exclaims gruffly, but before he can advance on Harry, Draco places a light hand on his muscular arm, and shakes his head. “Well if it’s what you want,” he grumbles. Then he leaves, his mouth twisting in irritation as he passes Harry, before melting back into the crowds milling about the center of the bar.
“First, I must acknowledge the pain and suffering we all have endured these last few―nay, many years―by the hands of Lord Voldemort. Many in this room have lost family and friends fighting against the hatred and evil that he spread. But it is in trying times as these when friendship, patience, and understanding are most needed. That is why I have decided not to cancel this year’s education at Hogwarts, despite the horror that these walls have seen so very recently. The Battle was won, but the scars of the war still need time to heal.
Shacklebolt answers. “Floor plans of manors belonging to Death Eaters.”
“I love you,” Draco says, because he means it, because he wants to hear Harry say it back. And he does say it back, and that’s all that matters, right?
“Still, the Room of Requirement? Why not the Slytherin dormitories? Or an alcove? Or the Astronomy Tower?” Harry narrows his eyes, and almost mutters under his breath. “What could he be trying to find?”
“They’re good, I—”
She crosses the street, throwing one look behind her shoulder, before slipping into an alleyway. With her wand, she taps on the red brick wall, the pattern of a triangle over a square; seven pointed star for good luck. The brick wall shimmers, and Ginny walks through it.
“How are you still in shape?” Draco asked, cheeks flushed. Harry smiled, a little sad and lopsided.
“But he’s not reading the book. He’s reading the annotations,” he hears Hermione say to Ron in the background. “On that note, have
“That’s not the point, and you know it.”
“Please, Malfoy, it would work. I know it will work.” Harry comes back to the front desk, leaning on it again and looking at Draco imploringly. Desperately. It reminds Draco of that night, the first night when Harry sacrificed Draco to save himself from Snape’s punishment.
“No,” Harry says coolly. “I'm sure McGonagall is a great Headmaster.”
“Yes?”
and you haven’t even asked for payment?
“Sleep well?” Harry asks, tightening his grip on Draco’s hand now that it won’t disturb him, pulling him closer and wrapping his arms around him. With a lazy smile Draco curls into him, so easily, so trusting, so warmly, that Harry could almost cry.
And she remembers the darkness in Harry’s voice, that night on the Astronomy Tower. That night when the world she knew both clicked into place and shattered before her eyes.
will explain this instant!”
“How could that be deemed illegal, sir?” Harry interjects.
“More sleep,” Harry mumbles. Draco feels his anxiety ebb with how undeniably adorable Harry is in the morning. He realizes this is the first time they slept through the night together.

Miss Lovegood does not seem to notice his tone. “Yes, I was. I did not think you needed any more schooling. I was under the impression you wished to be an auror, and would likely apply right away. Forgive me my presumption, Mr Potter. I suppose even Saviors must learn Herbology after all.”
“Luna has a way of knowing what’s best for you.” Harry sounds like he knows this from personal experience. He takes a sip of his scotch, seamlessly slipping into that ruminating mood where Ginny could never pierce through, those dark green eyes—a forest of secrets—going out of focus.
He hears Snape’s low, dramatic drawl resonate softly against the cold stone of the castle as Harry hurries after them down the hall. Abruptly, Snape slams Draco up against the wall, and Harry pauses, flattening himself behind a column, his heart pounding. He strains his ears.
The group was so loud and drunk they hardly noticed their departure.
“How did you—what—Harry,” Ginny stutters, right before Harry collapses into her arms, and it takes all her strength to keep them both standing. “Harry, you’re scaring me.”
“I don’t deserve you,” Harry says, burrowing his face in Draco’s hair, sighing.
Everyone sits down in a clamor of benches scraping and suddenly the students can no longer hold back, and conversation breaks out loudly among the tables. Mostly people whisper about the High Table and the notable additions to the professors, such as Mr Ollivander and the Minister, as well as Mr and Mrs Bill Weasley. It takes a few moments for the uproar in the Great Hall to quiet down. At the podium Professor McGonagall looks sternly down her nose at the students until gradually silence descends.
“What do you think, Draco?” Ron asks, taking another large bit of pie, smearing blueberry on his cheek, which Hermione fondly scoffs at. When Rose begins to whine, Ron dips his pinkie into the jelly and let’s Rose gently suck it, immediately calming her. Hermione smiles, shaking her head.
Draco lowers his eyes, frowning. Then a small smile curves on his delicate pink mouth, and it takes all of Harry’s self restraint not to kiss him right then and there. “It can be a secret.”
Harry finds Pansy on the balcony, smoking a cigarette. Her eyes are red but Harry would rather die than ask her about it.
“Stop,” Draco says, his voice trembling.
“Why are you here?” Draco asks wearily.
“I can’t stop thinking about it,” Harry says in a low voice, ignoring what Draco said. His grip on Draco’s arm tightens. “I can’t stop thinking about you.”

Harry knows it could not have lasted.
“And take eleven classes? What an absurd notion!”
Harry blinked and the room was pitch black. He heard Draco breathing, the bed shifting under their weight. Harry wondered what Draco was thinking, if he listened to Harry’s breath too, if he could feel every slight movement he made. Maybe he was already asleep.
“I told you to take Muggle Studies with me,” Weasley says, unhelpfully.
Harry fails to block the hex this time, and his limbs slow down, each step a few seconds long. But it won’t last.
Harry gives her a wild look. “That’s unfair. You said—”
Malfoy raised both eyebrows. Harry thought he almost looked amused, although his eyes still held a steely grey that sharpened on him.
He sighs, deflated, when he catches the fading impression of a large, ornate door on the far wall. Harry sprints over, but by the time he gets there, the door is gone and his hands press against the cool stone walls of the castle.
A moment later, the door unlocked silently, opening a sliver. Harry pushed it carefully, walking inside. Draco was sitting up in bed, his chest bare. The
, Harry had said.
Blaise usually sleeps elsewhere, so it wouldn’t be him. Draco had thought his other dormmates would be asleep by now, as it is well past midnight. In fact, Draco should be leaving any minute to check on his progress in the Room.
Draco moves to leave, and Hermione smiles apologetically. They walk out of the kitchen together, and Harry sits back down slowly. Ron sighs.
