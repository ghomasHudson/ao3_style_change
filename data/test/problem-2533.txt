Draco took many steps back, staring at Harry. “I can’t be with you anymore,” he said, cutting off Harry. He had to say it as quickly as possible. He looked away from Harry as soon as he noticed the smile fading, and the expression of utter grief-stricken smeared across his face.
much love,
“Sounds like something you both need to work through.”
also, I don't know why I did such sort of parallels at the end over there, I don't know how to feel about it tbh.
Draco waited for him to look up again, then started speaking. “I mean… a little,” he shrugged, and for some reason, Harry’s chest darkened. “It’s quite unfair that she gets all the guys, isn’t it? She should leave
“Why should I treat you properly if you’re on Voldemort’s side?”
“Why is this so hard for you?” Harry grumbled, leaning back in his seat.  “Put your hands out.”
Harry found himself going to the Hospital Wing every hour.
“Oh, yes… He left around this time last year without a letter or anything. Closed up the shop and was gone. He sends occasional letters sometimes. All I know is that he’s somewhere in America.”
“But someone likes you,” Ron raised an eyebrow. “If I were you I’d have gone mental trying to figure out who it is.”
“It’d be amazing,” Draco nodded. He moved his head slightly, placing a gentle kiss on Harry’s lips. He stood up. “But things can’t be like that. For the sake of my safety, and more importantly, yours.”
Harry took in a few breaths, looking up at Draco with a sense of uncertainty in his eyes. “Draco.”
Draco refused to look at the boy in the eye.
“Oh, Molly, I really hope you don’t mind that I brought a…
“This was the dullest Saturday ever,” Harry stated as the three walked down the hallway to go to dinner.
“Hi,” he responded, too lazy to sign.
Hermione and Ron exchanged glances, both uncomfortably imagining kissing each other. They stayed silent and Harry shook his head. Those two were in such a weird phase and he realized it probably wasn’t a good idea to say that. “Whatever. All I’m saying is, I’m not too happy that she was my first kiss.”
“Well… it just feels like you’re the only person who listens to what I have to say, and…” Draco felt his eyes tear up. “Fuck, this is so stupid.”
He looked over at her, then shook his head. “Sorry, what?”
The rumors spread like wildfire at once.
“Oh Merlin, Harry, are you okay?” He stood up, panicked.
Harry nodded, eyes wandering to the record player in the room. “This used to be Sirius’ room,” he spoke finally, standing up and picking out a disc record and carefully placing it on the player.
“Pansy!”
“It’s too much, really,” Draco answered, sitting down opposite Harry at the table. “I got us some food from the Three Broomsticks.”
Their eyes met, and Draco forgot what he was supposed to do. He instantly just found himself staring at Harry’s cute face as he pouted slightly (he was upset that Draco was enjoying himself without Harry) and continued staring at Draco.
“Draco, open your eyes, he’s gone,” Pansy said, walking over to sit on the chair.
“Yes,” he replied, leaning back. He shut his eyes again, then quickly opened them. “Are you sure?”
“Pansy! Pansy!!” Draco shouted throughout the whole Slytherin area, desperate to find her.
“Hold on, are you telling me Slughorn tried to poison the two of you?” Draco blinked in confusion.
This is a really short chapter, but that's because the next chapter is going to be kind of long.
The week was slow, and Harry didn’t know if he should’ve been grateful for that or not. While he couldn’t wait for Friday, he was deeply dreading Saturday. It was a moment of truth; or a test he had to pass, except he had brought it upon himself.
He watched as Harry signed his name carefully. “Okay, I think I have it now.”
“I know what today is,” he groaned, sitting up, but avoiding her gaze, pulling at the loose sleeves of his sweater as he hid the letter under his covers. Ron entered slowly after. With both their eyes on him, he stood up, trying to keep on a brave face. “I…”
“Harry, stop.”
“Is this the job the Dark Lord gave me, or you are giving me?” Draco asked. He was so done with this. He didn’t ask to be a Death Eater. He didn’t ask to be a part of this. He didn’t ask for any of this. And in result, he lost the one person he loved the most.
“No, no… I think I’ll stay here. Figure out what I want to do with my life,” he said, struggling to maintain eye contact. “When are you leaving?”
A shirtless Draco grabbed his wand and pointed it at whoever barged in. He rolled his eyes when he saw that it was only Pansy. Draco was the only one in his dorm. He always liked using the bathroom after his dorm mates because everyone would leave for breakfast and he’d have the room to himself while he got ready.
“I’ve not done anything to prove you can’t trust me.”
Draco pulled at the sleeves of his sweater. “I’m fine,” he said as he sidled beside Harry, looking out at the view of the city.
Draco noticed how his mother didn’t assume that it was a girl, and how she remained careful with the pronouns. Narcissa reached out and took his hand, squeezing it gently before standing up.
“If you keep acting like this, yes. I’m afraid I need an explanation as to why you’re acting so abnormally kind.”
He shook his head. “No. Just, uh, need a break?”
Harry was quiet for a moment, then smiled. “I do have another board game in mind, actually,” he beamed. “It’s called Life. What do you think?”
what the hell even is this chapter lmao
“I’d say this sounds crazy, but we’re at Hogwarts, so…” Draco commented, sitting down. “Anyway--”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m not!” Draco snapped, glaring at Harry. “If a slut wants to send you a letter, whatever, I- I don’t care!”
“It’s more like a few tears. I… don’t really allow myself to feel sad about Cedric and everything else, so… I suppose it comes through frustration of other things, if I’m being honest. We all need a good cry, don’t we?”
“So he has,” Harry said. The hour before Madame Pomfrey had told him that he wasn’t awake yet.
He pushed the thought away. Draco was too young to become a Death Eater anytime soon, and just because of the Malfoys’ beliefs, it didn’t mean he would follow them. But… it wasn’t as if he wouldn’t.
,” Lucius spoke up, “how lovely to see you in our home.”
A few months passed. Draco had less and less time and seemed more stressed every time Harry saw him, but there was nothing he could do. All he did was kiss Draco, hold him close. Sometimes he would whisper that everything was going to be okay. He noticed Draco needed to hear that a lot.
The two sat in silence for a moment.
“Dick,” Harry muttered.
Harry entered the classroom one minute late, slowly and sneakily sitting beside Ron, hoping Snape wouldn’t notice.
“Really now?” Draco asked as he smiled back. It was impossible not to. Harry’s green eyes were sparkling as he grinned. His hair was greasy and sticking up (revealing the white roots in those specific strands of his hair) and his glasses were falling forwards as he leaned over to move his car to the box.
“Dean and I got into another fight,” Ginny said.
“I saw you Apparate as I was pulling my bedroom curtains! Thank goodness, thank goodness- but what’s wrong with Albus?”
The two watched Hermione and Pansy go, both giggling to themselves like little school girls. Draco shut the door behind them, turning to face Harry. “That was…”
“Happy New Year, Draco,” Harry replied. Draco kissed him on the lips quickly before anyone could see, wrapping his arms around Harry as he stood behind him as the two stared up at the sky. “It’s beautiful. Isn’t it, Harry?”
“Can we put that aside for a moment?” he whispered back. “Only for a moment. Please?”
Harry got nothing. He sighed. He thought again.
“Well, it’s kind of hard when I just found out we’re soulmates,” he said, and the two smiled for a brief moment. “I just… I’m sorry.”
“You don’t have to be sorry. It’s not your fault. Neither is it mine,” he said, a hint of a smile on his face. “I’m sorry there’s something bothering you, though,” he tilted his head, leaning forward and kissing Draco’s forehead gently. “I heard that makes people feel better.”
“Stop talking. Just…” Harry closed his eyes for a few seconds, a few tears falling down his face.
She watched him go, but she couldn't help but think that she was right, based on his reaction.
“You’re hurting yourself,” Draco whispered, “even if you don't realize it.”
“However, you did anyway,” she snapped, folding her arms. “Detention. Three weeks. And fifty points from Slytherin.”
“Okay, then tell me the ingredients to make a Wit-Sharpening potion.”
Draco turned back to Harry who literally pounced on him, not to kiss him, but to hug him tightly.
“She feels really bad, you know,” Ron said. “Mione. She feels awful about what happened. Said all she wants is to see you and Draco happy.”
, and Draco’s face is open and flushed and
“Fuck,” Draco says quietly. “Fuck, come here,
Encouraged with the milder reaction, Harry palms at Malfoy’s side more firmly, feeling the fine bone under the pads of his fingers, and focuses on the magic flowing from his core and slowly spreading, banishing the pain and filling in the cracks of the fracture. He risks a glance up and Malfoy’s hand goes a little higher, fingers now digging into the soft place where Harry’s neck meets his shoulder, Malfoy’s thumb grazing his Adam's apple. As soon as their eyes meet, Harry feels a renewed surge of power seep through his fingers, a red glow illuminating the pale skin under his hand, so bright he can
“Oh, to be stood up by a celebrity in the Autumn of your life,” Draco muses, lacing his words with a playful note and Harry can’t help the small smile curving his lips. “How cruel, Potter, to put out a fire before it truly roars! To crave the touch of a young, deft hand that vanquished the darkness with an Expelliarmus,” Draco continues, spurred on by the girls’ giggles; his tone turns to full-on pathos, one hand clutching the front of his shirt, as he looks at Harry with a mischievous glint in his eyes.
Harry’s non-existent sex life is apparently a much more enticing topic than the ongoing debate about the superiority of peach roses over peonies because the girls bring their respective drinks and join them in the centre of the room. Ginny and Luna flop down on the pile of large pillows by the table, and Hermione props herself on the elbow-rest of Ron’s armchair. She summons Draco’s wine bottle and pours herself a glass, smiling at the dramatic arch of his brow all too quickly replaced by a fond eyeroll to carry any real malice.
“I think Neville mentioned a new coworker he has, too,” Dean pipes in, grinning. “What is it, Hermione? Are you and Ron the only ones who can throw their hats in the ring?”
Then it all slowed down, a heavy mist collapsing their shoulders, a slow advance of hips, harder, thicker, higher until it evaporated again into a rushed whirlwind, raindrops on their temples and sweat under their collars.
“I needed help with the baby,” he says unconvincingly.
He must feel the sudden shift in the air and lets out a quiet laugh, and Harry glances up from his desk to see Draco watch him with amusement.
,” he chokes out and pulls Harry into his lap.
Forget what he said, all his friends are evil.
The evening doesn’t exactly drag on; it somehow manages to be easy and tranquil while simultaneously making Harry feel he’s not making an effort. It’s hard to put his finger on whether it’s because talking to Daniel is so unbelievably simple or because there’s something about Harry and his relationship with things that are hard, dangerous or infuriating.
“Fine!” Malfoy closes the case with a metallic clasp and stuffs it back into his pocket. He whips his wand out again and taps it twice on the paper square. In a matter of seconds, it expands at the corners, revealing a simple, brown paper folder. Harry sees the odd folds and parchments inside and his curiosity is now officially piqued.
“It… wouldn’t hurt, I guess.”
“I’m done talking. Touch me.”
just try to hex me!”
The silhouette moves but doesn’t jump, unperturbed by Harry’s sudden entrance. His eyes slowly adapt to the dark and Harry can make out Malfoy’s pale face in the cell, his hair a little out of order. He’s still wearing his jacket and while it couldn’t have been comfortable, there’s a slight draft so Harry imagines he must have been cold. The small space smells like almonds as if Malfoy radiated it, and the stark contrast between the sweet scent and the damp, stone walls makes Harry huff in annoyance.
on a regular basis. Harry still isn’t sure he understands exactly what
Draco cries out, a strangled moan escaping him as his head lolls backwards, breath speeding up. “Harry, oh my
“Silencing—” Draco says and Harry covers his mouth with his hand.
“Insatiable,” Draco murmured as he let his hand roam over Harry’s chest, going lower, and lower, until it slid under the sheets covering their hips, until Harry hissed into Draco’s ear and nibbled on his earlobe. Warm, smooth fingers finally found what they were looking for and Draco chuckled as he coaxed a few soft moans from Harry—he was always good with his hands, no matter if it was cooking, gardening, or turning Harry into a gasping, whimpering mess. “What am I supposed to do with you, Mr Potter?”
“And you’ve been sort of writing everyone off after the first date for, like, years,” Ginny says.
Draco helped him up, and Harry lay back, holding onto the two vertical, ornate handles on each side. Gently, he lifted Harry’s legs up, one by one, and placed his feet in the golden stirrups.
“Would the Muggle law enforcement allow a witness to carry a gun?”
Harry’s come trickles down Teddy’s balls as he turns to face Draco and he’s immediately pulled into a deep kiss. He tangles his fingers in Draco’s tousled hair, holds on to him and lets Draco devour his mouth as he lines himself up and guides him down onto his cock.
“I know,” he sighs. “I… thank you.”
“Yes, please,” Potter murmurs against his temple, smiling as Draco’s hands instinctively grab onto his hips.
“Well that’s just fucking fantastic,” he sighs and points to his flawless shoes. “These probably cost more than a fortnight in whatever hotel we find in this hellhole.”
Harry cranes his neck so Draco finally looks at him. “I’m not freaking out.”
, Draco, I—” He babbles urgently, trying to thrust into Draco’s hand as he finds purchase on the headboard.
They go back to their room after a while and Harry’s glad to find a small electric kettle and a few bags of complimentary tea in one of the cupboards. Malfoy watches him with fascination as Harry plugs it in but quickly turns away when he’s caught. He walks around the room, examining every Muggle thing he can find: playing with the light switches until Harry tells him to stop, poking the long-used-up air freshener by the door, and even pulling the ceiling fan rope to find it out of order.
“I imagine he would,” Harry says, tilting his head.
“At what?!”
that. And still, while Harry sacrificed things for the greater good, for an idea that’s morally correct and inherently just, everything Draco had sacrificed, was for the people close to him, their safety and happiness, and that leaves Harry wishing he knew how to get Draco to make his own bloody self happy for a change.
him, filled Draco with the strangest mix of dread and exhilaration, made his cock leak and his heart flutter. And it wasn’t Potter anymore, was it? It was Harry; Harry’s lips wrapped around him, Harry’s hands roaming over Draco's skin, Harry’s fingers in Draco's mouth. Under him, around him, inside him. Harry, Harry,
It’s inevitable for everything to shift between them since what happened at the launderette. Since Draco made that step Harry was too scared to make himself, since they stopped pretending that the unbearable tension between them had nothing to do with their mutual attraction. Maybe that’s why Harry’s reluctant to let Draco roam free at first, pulling him back to his lips, into his arms, and under the umbrella of illusion that everything is perfectly fine. The fact that they’re finally touching each other isn’t the scary part, it’s the mythical
That perfect, tailored expression, and the infuriating gentleness in Draco’s movements, only push Harry further into the wordless mantra going around in his head. The stranger spots him and perhaps sees the seething fury in the knit of his shoulders as he immediately backs off to the side just so Harry can manhandle Draco to the side.
, and Harry’s repressed need unfurls in his chest, the love, the need to nurture and care too big and scary to keep it all in, and Draco carries them through it and Harry doesn’t think he has ever loved that much, that openly.
After Harry received the message, they were ready to leave in under ten minutes, with everything packed, the room cleared of any evidence they’ve been there, and a hefty tip left on the cupboard for the housemaid. It took them six Apparitions to finally land where they’re standing—it could have been done in two, maybe three, but the longer the distance, the stronger the magical trace, and Harry refused to put them at risk like that. He’s still chaotically going through all the stop points in his mind, making sure they didn’t miss anything, a suspicious figure, a security camera, anything that could lead their enemies to believe they’re back in London. Harry’s patting down his jacket to make sure his wand is still there when a pair of strong hands grab him by the shoulders and then he’s pressed against a damp alley wall.
“Throwing your fan mail at me?” He asks, his eyebrows riding up to his hairline. “Circe, this managed to slip through the Ministry filters?”
Draco laughed. “No, I have never used it for its intended purpose,” Draco said, deliberately hinting there was a
“Ginny,” he tries again. “How do you two keep coming in here?” Harry asks, genuinely baffled. “I have an assistant! The office is swarming with law enforcement! Seriously, how?”
Draco doesn’t say anything else, just licks another deliberate, wet stripe over his arse. And then Harry cries out as Draco pulls his cheeks apart with his thumbs and slowly drags his tongue over his hole.
“I had no idea,” Harry repeats and is so afraid that he’s lying because even a blind man would see it, so how could he not have known? “Just flaunting it when…” He trails off, trying to clear his head. This is the only chance he will get to make this right. To not lose Draco.
“Shut up,” Harry says in a low voice, closing his eyes and counting to ten. “If you’ll keep talking for the next twenty-four hours, I swear to Merlin—”
Ron raises a finger. “A
“No!” Malfoy interrupts. His lips twist into a sneer but there’s a slight tremble in the corner and he seems far too defensive for a thing as mundane as Apparition. Harry frowns.
“Yes,” Harry breathed, pulling Draco in with his legs. “Fuck me, make love to me, whatever you—”
Malfoy’s hair is in disarray, falling into his eyes in a pale mess, his face gorgeously flushed and
“She had a family emergency and had to leave and I—” he side-eyes Draco who’s looking at him with an amused sort of expectancy. “Wanted company?” Harry finishes lamely, rolling his eyes. It sounds like Draco’s a secret mistress and they’ve been found out by Harry’s disapproving family. Draco’s already smirking which makes Harry believe he thought the exact same thing.
He clears his throat. “I… don’t know anyone who’d be…”
They’re meandering between masses of people going back to work after their breaks and Harry struggles to catch up with his friend. He bumps shoulders with a tall man and does a double-take, seeing he’s wearing a suit so similar to Malfoy’s, Harry thought it was him for a second. He rolls his eyes at himself, once again overthinking everything the prat does, their conversation still fresh in Harry’s head.
They sit quietly for a bit and it’s wonderful how those little silences don’t have to be awkward—they’re little pockets of peace, probably more vulnerable than they have any right to be, moments when they don’t have to be anybody, not even themselves, when they can just breathe and think about nothing at all.
!” Maggie says (squeals) and picks up her bag. “It was
“I was the informant, true,” Robards says, shrugging, his wand still raised. “But there can be no betrayal if the fight is for a different cause.”
Draco loves the feeling. He loves the easy slide into Teddy’s fucked-out little hole, loves the squelch of Harry’s come already inside, loves sucking on those pierced nipples as he fucks up into his spoiled, greedy boy. This, what the three of them have, Draco wouldn’t trade for anything else.
“I imagine eleven-year-old me would have had a field day,” Draco mutters, a rueful smile tugging at his lips.
“No thanks, I’m kind of full,” he says. “Consider it a bonus, for what a sweetheart you are,” Harry adds without thinking and sees a faint, pink tinge bloom on Draco’s face. He’s pretty sure his own doesn’t look any better. He rushes to change the topic. “And, for your information,
“I mean,” Draco huffs. “You are the Saviour of the Wizarding World. The Boy Who Lived Twice and all that, and— To find out about such a thing, and at the hands of some measly Muggles no less, it’s
“Are you sore?” Draco whispered into the dark.
“You had some silver solution right there,” he says and opens it back up. “I added a dash of Dittany to speed up the healing, the silver will help with the infection. Ideally, I’d use a specifically brewed antitoxin but seeing we don’t have any potion-making equipment on hand…”
He collapses on top of Draco and Draco, surprisingly, doesn’t mind the warm, solid weight, and even his own come dribbling out of Harry’s arse and down his softening cock still sheathed inside him. Potter smells like sex and sweat and Draco swears to never come near a bottle of Amortentia, surmising it shall be a special case where ignorance is, indeed, bliss.
The smell of flowers is even stronger inside and Harry can’t stop himself from sneezing into his elbow, luckily managing to stifle the sound. The studio extends deeper and Harry realises it also includes a courtyard in the middle of the building. It’s adapted to act as an orangery with a dome-like glass roof that allows more sunlight inside—it spills into the space through the dusty glass slates and bathes all the vegetation in a mysterious, greenish glow. The air is cool and moist, possibly to best preserve all the cut flowers and Harry can hear the murmur of flowing water echoing around the studio.
It gets easier as days pass by; Harry finally lets go of his small fears and concerns, tenacious as they are, and it’s Draco’s unusual steadiness in dispelling them that makes all the difference. Not only does he allow Harry to be physical, he starts to initiate it as well, even though it always feels like a question. They haven’t gone all the way yet, content with using their hands and mouths to bring each other off, but the feeling of
“Draco Malfoy you are now officially a witness under the DLME’s and, by extension, the Ministry of Magic’s protection,” Harry recites in a bored tone. “You are proposed a deal in which you will be exonerated and cleared of all charges if you agree to testify against your associates. I’m assigned to protect you until the trial that’s been scheduled in eight weeks so you can give your testimony, seeing as you’re a high-profile witness and might be pursued by the defendants with the intent to kill.”
“You wouldn’t complain anyway, you’re too proud.”
“Do I get to ask questions, too?” Harry asks without thinking, his heart hammering in his chest.
Robards is quiet. Seconds pass as if they were minutes, and the initial suspicion lightly tugging on Harry’s gut now turns more insistent, turning up the heat along his spine as he tries not to make any assumptions that would go into the ‘doom’ category. Not yet. Taking advantage of the fact his boss’ back is turned, Harry slowly, quietly moves to a better vantage point.
“I came because I… wanted to stop. I wanted it all to stop,” he says.
He goes back to the living room and flops down on the couch, sighing softly at the blissful silence engulfing him like a safety blanket. The telly is off, the windows are closed, the baby is asleep and Harry lets himself enjoy it for a few precious minutes. Inevitably, his thoughts divert back to the last hour and a half, to Maggie and, in consequence, to what on earth Hermione and Ron were thinking.
“Would you have gotten something to eat otherwise?” Draco asks, expertly swirling a neat portion of pasta on his fork.
“Get this: they found an illegal stash of Felix itself. It’s like the potion practically laughed in their faces.”
“Look,” Draco’s voice is full of wonder as whispers the single word into his ear and then Harry sees it. The ceiling mirror.
“Well, this is charming,” Malfoy announces as they enter.
“And safe,” Draco acquiesces.
In other circumstances, Draco could perhaps see the appeal, the threat of being discovered, the knowledge they’re doing something dirty, and wrong, and
get drunk.” He pulls out his wand and opens the new wine bottle. Watching Harry with a playful smirk, he pours a little into his empty glass and gives it a careful sniff. He raises a brow and hums. “Not bad, Potter.”
?! And see us
In effect, those above him leave him be; the lesser ones know their place. The ones he deems his equals are scarce and the only one in the vicinity is nowhere to be seen, forever going against all odds and expectations.
nice to meet you, Harry!”
“Yours,” Harry gasped, his whole body arching into the touch. He felt drunk, on pleasure, on love, on Draco.
The roar gets louder and louder, and the light is now a concentrated beam that’s getting closer and when it finally splits into two yellow headlights, Harry realises it’s not lightning.
It could have been the weather—the non-stop feeling of a light, freezing drizzle, turning the insides of their collars cold and wet, making their hair curl and stick to their foreheads, or those three weeks of wandering with the knowledge that there are still five left and someone could come after them any given day. It could have been any number of the little things that come with living in close quarters, but suddenly they were screaming at each other with thunder rolling in the background as if Odin himself was sick of the sour tension lingering in the air.
Draco smiles, the first real smile since Harry walked in. “Very well. Office?”
It’s not just a carnal want, to have Draco naked and sweating under him, it’s more than either of them is prepared to accept—Harry wants to swallow that bitter note in Draco’s mouth and turn it into honey, he wants to dissolve the knots in his muscles and absorb the mordant smoke filling his lungs. He takes a breath and slowly drags his teeth down the column of Draco’s throat.
“How long has it been going on?” Harry asks, not yet sure what
“Draco—”
or otherwise indicated his Potions knowledge might be just limited enough to render him underqualified for the task. Robards, however, was having none of it—the man dismissed him, barking something about
The man was a representative of a company collaborating with the government and, apparently, their upstanding little neighbourhood was chosen by The Powers That Be to participate in the Cold War Vault project. Each household was presented with the opportunity to secure as many places in a fallout shelter as there were people in the house. The company was building one nearby and the enthusiastic representative gushed about all the luxuries that awaited underground once it’s finished. The man talked a lot and at some point, Harry got a little lost in all the Muggle vocabulary he didn’t know the meaning of. It was annoying, too, how lightly he seemed to take the threat of a war, saying things like
, rings in his ears like a broken record. From up close he can see Daniel’s perfect hair that’s just a tad too dark, just a little too short to run his fingers through—it’s not the hair Harry dreams about tugging on, and waking up to seeing it spill onto the pillows. His blue eyes are like a clear, cerulean lake reflecting a cloudless sky, there are no gilded speckles, no thunderstorms rumbling behind them, they don’t glisten like quicksilver, sharp, alive, and oh, so beautiful. Everything about Daniel is soft; the angle of his jaw, the gentle arch of his cheekbones and the hand Harry feels brushing his face is too large, a little sturdy and—
“Well,” Draco says, his hands on his hips. “We’re not dead yet, so there’s an upside. However, I did expect more of a welcome committee, ready to escort me before the face of justice. And that is the face of a wrinkly old man—”
“Back to the point,” Harry cuts him off.
A deranged thought popped into Harry’s head, to call the British Museum, or perhaps the Vatican, because while he had seen his fair share of art and sculptures, none stood a chance against the statuesque beauty before him. Draco, completely nude, with his chiselled body and soft, honey light scantily shining through the outer feathers of his glorious wings. He looked like an archangel, if archangels were supposed to make people weak with desire, if Draco ever allowed Harry to even call him that.
Draco slowly turned his head and just stared, his eyes jumping across Harry’s features as if he was in a rush to commit them to memory and Harry maybe wanted to scream, to cry at him so he would stop, it wasn’t like there was no time left, they had all the time in the world just five minutes ago.
“It has come to my attention that I still have… prospects here,” he says haughtily.
Only once has Draco thought it could perhaps become something more, something beyond calculation and lists. He always hastily suppresses thoughts like this for a number of reasons but mainly because good things have never been a particular abundance in Draco’s life so he takes it for what it is and keeps taking until Potter stops giving.
“Fuck,” he whimpers, “fuck you’re—so big—god, Potter—” Draco babbles, leaning his sweaty forehead on the headboard.
Harry shoots him a wicked smile and shifts under Draco’s solid warmth. “
“Fuck, fuck, like that,” Draco gasps, and pulls him up by the hair into a biting kiss.
Draco watched the parchment, as dry as the words it carried, quickly catch fire, and rode out the shiver zinging across his back. Memories from one particular night, two years ago, assaulted him with renewed intensity.
“Yes,” Harry breathed, “So good— just like that, harder,
“But I have your wand,” says Harry, “and I don’t recall you ever casting wandless.”
Draco finishes the question for him. “Why did I come out so late?” He flashes Harry a smile, his perfect, white canines glinting in the dim light. “You see, I didn’t think all the Death Eaters in my family or Voldemort couchsurfing in my house would care much for hearing about my journey to self-realisation,” he says with an amused snort.
“No, no! I don’t think that!” Harry says defensively, a little ashamed his thoughts went straight there. Some apocalyptic part of his mind just assumed that if Draco knew an attractive, affable young man, it was only logical they would hit it off and ride off into the sunset together. “So…”
some adorable crup to gush over, and if it’s also a tremendous relief, well, that’s no-one’s business but his own. And maybe Harry’s. The tension around the table is gone as fast as it appeared and the gang is again chatting and laughing and, surprisingly, not making that big of a fuss.
“Right. And how did you discover that?”
“They’ll kill me if they find me, you know.” Malfoy finally looks at Harry—something rueful flashes across his face, quickly disappearing underneath a cool mask of indifference.
They take their time and this strange, breathtaking night is different from all their other ones. There’s a debilitating reverence to Draco’s touches, as he slowly, methodically, rids Harry of his clothes, kisses down his body, anointing it with hot licks and breathy gasps. There’s also a strange giddiness permeating the air, they laugh softly and roll about the bed, naked, flushed, and close.
“Draco, I—”
“I bet,” Ron sighs. “Let’s go see if they found anything.”
Just as he’s at the door, Harry remembers something and quickly runs back to the bedroom—Draco’s still there, now with underwear on. Harry crosses the room in a few quick strides and before Draco can ask what on earth he’s still doing here, Harry kisses him one more time, deep and slow. “I love you.”
“Those poor Aurors, just doing their jobs,” he says with an ironic pout and then, his face hardens. “I had it coming. It’s nothing that won’t heal with time.”
Draco was acting pissy at work that day so Harry logically knew there was a big chance he’d find him here and the pint suggested his mood was particularly sour as Draco wasn’t really a beer person, or even a mope-at-a-pub person. McLaggen being there was just a frying pan-fire situation, a cherry on top, really, and now, on top of everything, Harry was on his way over.
They both know something about dark reminders, ones etched into their skin against their will.
, and one raised with house-elves, for that matter, so you can imagine that particular skill was considered redundant,” he sniffs.
“Nope. No. You’re on your own.” He said before walking out and shutting the door behind himself.
Malfoy apparently had Potions with Ron and Hermione, which was also a bonus for Harry, normally, because he wasn’t there to constantly torment him.
“Mhmm. They’re back to claiming it’s the ‘imperius curse’.” Draco said as he crossed his arms over his chest and sighed deeply.
Harry gasped and pulled Draco's face up to his own. He searched the stormy grey eyes for any signs of illness but all he found was irritation.
She nodded frantically “Yes.”
“Harry? Want to go check on him?” Draco asked, still very sleepy.
Draco put the book down and sat back. He ran his hands through his hair again and again trying to calm his nerves. It was a lot to take in. He needed to talk to someone, he needed an explanation. Why did this always happen to him? First the Dark Mark: although now faded, it was something he would’ve been happy to live without. The Death Eater title, or Ex-Death Eater now, had only brought on unwanted comments and abuse. He regretted what he did more than he could say, but he didn’t have a choice. Now his inheritance. He would’ve been happy to be able to choose his own spouse, and not need some age-old magic do it for him. When would he be able to choose his own path in life?
“I’ll speak with you outside.” he said, not stopping and walking right past Harry to just outside the shop doors. Potter followed willingly.
“Wait, so you’d never felt pain before this, Draco?” Hermione asked.
Harry's face straightened when he saw the seriousness in his mates eyes. “What? What's wrong? Is everything ok?”
After dinner, one that Draco could happily say was the best he's had in weeks, they separated and left Kreacher to clean up.
“Who said you need a bathing suit?” Draco replied with a cheeky grin.
Harry seemed to deflate a little at draco’s words. “Alright, but I don’t want to be here for longer than I have to.”
He wanted to tell Harry that he was ready, but nervous about what will happen, if anything happened. But he didn’t want Harry to think that he couldn’t handle being a father and carrying their children, and leave him for someone who is ready.
“When are we going to bond?”
Draco woke with a scream ringing in his ears and a pounding heart. Soon realizing that he didn’t dream the cry he was hearing, he quickly went to Harry’s room to find the boy writhing on the bed and screaming bloody murder.
Malfoy’s innocent expression changed into one of pure giddiness. “Oh but dear, don’t you enjoy it?”
Once home, Harry went straight to the bathroom to shower, rejecting Draco’s request to join, saying he’d be quick and that he just wanted to sleep everything off after.
The words sting, but not as much as my arse will when we’re done tonight. It’s a bit of a routine of ours.
He peed and washed his hands. Then, purely out of curiosity, he peeked in through the shower curtain to find one very naked Draco Malfoy-Potter.
Draco shut the door behind himself.
He went to flip to another page when he heard the door creak behind him. It startled him so much he dropped the book and quickly spun around-
Draco scoffed. “Of course, I’m not a neanderthal.” Harry just rolled his eyes. “You know, I’m almost done. If you wait, we can actually go out instead of bringing food here.”
When he pulled back to look at draco, his face was streaked with tears and his cheeks red and blotchy.
“We don’t have to, you know. Not if you don’t want to.” He sounded as sad as he felt.
“His vitals are fine, but if he starts vomiting or bleeding in any way, bring him back here and I’ll check him over.” Madame Pomfrey explained with the utmost professionalism Harry knew her to have.
“I thought you were going to let me pick.” Draco said from against Harry’s neck. He’d latched on as soon as Harry joined him in the couch, kissing and licking gently against the Boy Who Lived’s neck, leaving wet trails in his wake. Harry let him, loving the domestic feeling they created around them.
He looked beside himself and saw that the blond was still sleeping, so he decided to go shower. He might as well use the alone time now that he had it.
And Draco did just that.
After taking a bite of his chocolate bar last night and holding Draco's hand, he decided that he needed to stay away from him as much as possible, if only to protect Draco from his Alpha-like tendencies. He didn't know what he was capable of, and he didn't know what he would do if he were to accidentally hurt him.
“Ah! I resent that implication.” Draco said, turning his nose up at her.
Draco blushed slightly and replied "I prefer it, actually." A shy smile graced his lips and Harry thought he'd never seen anything more beautiful. A few more moments pass of silence then "Can I call you 'Harry'?" The blond asked.
“Wait, did you just make me agree to all those things because you actually thought I’d do them, or just to prove a point?”
All the while the three were catching up, Draco stood awkward and tall behind Harry. Only after a few moments did the other to look and acknowledge him.
As he approached the back cubicle, Harry wasn’t there, but his apparent partner, Weasley, was.
"Well of course not, but it wouldn't be good if you go back in and loose control and start ravishing him either! Also your magic, you know how it gets riled up." She drifted off to just above a whisper when speaking about Harry's magic, in case there were any eavesdroppers nearby.
Draco sighed before saying “I know, it was rude of me to run out like that. I apologize. But, I'm just curious as to why you want to know that about me.”
Draco stared at Harry for a moment before replying “Ok, fine. This is a bit out of our control, I guess. I knew you shouldn’t have told them about us.”
10 minutes later and Draco was shaking from the effort of trying to stay still with every bone and vein in his body as Harry adjusted to his full length.
“What do you mean?”
-to see Harry looking up at him, worriedly.
“Obviously this wasn’t the plan for my future, and I must admit that I haven’t been exactly cordial towards you today, but I’m willing… to give this a chance. More importantly you a chance, so don’t let me regret it. You haven’t exactly given me good reason too, no matter how oddly nice you’re being towards me. I don’t want to live the rest of my life with someone I don’t like.”
Clearly, he was trying to butter Draco up, to get his attention or whatever. “Well thank you. I appreciate the good publicity.” Draco chuckled. “Now, if you’ll excuse me…” He motioned to the table with his cue, cuing the man to get out of his way so he could play.
They both stood up and made their way inside, and into the bedroom.
Oh how his father would be so disappointed, he thought. He never cried, even as a child. Yes, he could be dramatic, but not emotional. He never was good at such a thing.
“Yeah, ‘Mione, I’m ok.” He took a sip of the water, clearing his throat of the harsh feeling left behind.
Draco took a deep breath before a grin broke out on his face as well. “Ok.”
They had gone through a few stores in which Draco found nothing he liked, so they moved on. Harry tried to help Draco by picking out different clothes he thought the blond would look good in, but there was always something to criticize, be it the style, cut, or colour.
“Well, I’m an Auror now. It’s practically the same stuff I had to deal with at Hogwarts: evil, power hungry wizards who want to rule the wizarding world, and, you know, old ladies who lost their cat in a rainstorm.” Potter laughed.
Eventually they parted, and finished watching the sun set, together.
I’ve never said no to a challenge.
“Oh yeah, just peachy.” Draco said with a grunt.
Draco stepped back, seriously not expecting that.
“Do what?” Draco could only ask before he felt a pull by his navel, Potter’s scent and arms surrounding him.
“Don’t I know it. She out ranked me multiple times in multiple classes, back in school. She’s great, but man did that hurt.” Draco chuckles.
When he just continued to stand there, Harry realized that he was waiting for permission to enter.
But, he couldn’t.
It started to convulse rapidly, almost as if he was hyperventilating and vomiting all at once. His eyes rolled back and he went limp as Draco reached around and held onto him. It was with shocking realization that Draco realized Harry was having a seizure.
“Anything to get your hands on me,” Malfoy’s smirk stayed firmly in place. His eyes were positively gleaming at Harry. He wanted to vomit.
He looked up at the burly man holding him, placed a gentle hand on his cheek, reached up and kissed him softly. As soon as Harry pressed further into the kiss, Draco pulled back and leaned into Harry’s ear.
How wrong he had been.
“I-I didn’t mean to.” Between the storming professors and the Snape-Malfoy situation, he never even thought of the blond. Did he actually kill him? What did that spell DO?
Harry was a powerful wizard, there was no doubt about that. He defeated Voldemort for Merlin's sake! However, he'd sometimes loose control over his emotions, which always caused his sensitive magic to start going all haywire and radiating off of him, disturbing the natural balances around him. Add some horny, protective Alpha senses to that, and you got yourself one big disaster waiting to happen.
Wow another chapter! I've got the beginning of this story pretty much planned out so I'll hopefully be uploading it quickly.
He kissed him.
“Then you said those things last night when you were feeling so raw after the seizure and everything, so I thought you really meant them. But now you’re saying you actually love me and that it’s not the prophecy making you love me. So does the prophecy have an effect over your emotions or not?”
Harry was filled with admiration for the blond in front of him. “Are you sure?”
“What?”
Harry laughed before leaning in and placing a chaste kiss on the blond’s soft lips. It was different from when Draco had kissed him, small and quick, but he loved it all the same.
“Robards was still emptying it out, if I recall. He retired last week; the Minister wanted to take his time looking for a good replacement before he just threw anyone in there to take over.” Harry said.
“Draco no.” Potter continued laughing. Draco really liked that sound.
Draco smiled. Impressive, Harry actually could form a not-so awkward sentence around Draco without looking painfully uncomfortable.
“I don't think so. I think you're coming down with something.” He immediately placed the back of his hand to Draco's forehead, before it was slapped away.
“I thought your house elves did everything for you.”
“We best be going then, Harry,” Hermione said in a high-pitched voice. She grabbed his hand and pulled him through the portrait hole and all the way down to the great hall.
“I apologized,” Draco nodded. “Several times. I know what I did was wrong.”
“You said we’re friends, right?” Draco looked up, finally looking into Harry’s emerald green eyes, who was busy reading his lips, which also had a few cuts. His platinum blond hair, for once, was not combed to perfection, nor did it have any sort of weird gel in it. It fell into his eyes. When Harry nodded, he shrugged. “Then you have every right to ask.”
He quickly turned when the door opened, revealing Harry, who slammed the door shut. However he stayed there for a moment, trying to catch his breath. “Sorry I’m late,” he said finally.
“Okay,” he said finally. “I suppose I should go, then.”
“Oh, yeah.”
“As I was saying, I think it’s best if we go back for Christmas. Ever since Fred…” Ron trailed off into silence, biting his lip. Harry nodded, frowning as he bit his lip. “Harry, you’ll come for Christmas dinner, right?” Ron paused, then added, “And… I suppose bringing Malfoy along wouldn’t be the
“Sure,” he smiled, but it didn’t seem to reach his eyes.
Love,
“Harry, six a.m. isn’t that early.”
Draco stared at him in disbelief, but the darkened expression in his father had tinged a fear in him that was all too familiar. He nodded, leaving and entering the room in a well-mannered position, trying to remember everything he had learnt as a child. Hold your head up, even steps, and more importantly, be the most confident person in the room.
*********
“There was an article that talked about how I moved to America, so… it’s surprising what kind of things can land you in the newspaper.”
“Oh, not us. Mum and Dad. Well, technically, all the Weasleys except for us two.”
Draco slowed down when he finally reached the entrance too. The doors were closed. Hermione and Ginny walked about to talk about her fight with
“Whoa, Harry, slow down, you’re going to choke,” Hermione said, placing a hand on his shoulder.
“Well… I guess the situation had to be confronted sooner or later,” he said, laughing awkwardly. He looked over to Astoria, who seemed to be invested in a conversation with Luna, noticing the ring on her finger. Draco was legally married to someone else. He couldn’t dare change his mind now. But he wasn’t sure if his answer was supposed to be a ‘no’ to begin with.
“I’ve tried!” Ron whined again. “I’ve tried everything!”
“You know what’s ridiculous? Me coming back for another year,” Harry signed with one hand as he tried to eat. “There can’t have been zero deaf wizards until now, right?”
“You had your chance,” Snape told him. He turned to Draco and briefly looked through his mind, using Legilimency. “I was right.”
“It was the only way to get you here, Draco,” Lucius said, turning to face his son.
“What the fuck?” he said a little too loudly, taking a few steps back. “And when you were planning on telling me this?”
As much as Harry wanted to say he was angry at Draco, he knew he was being unreasonable. He knew it was too much to ask for. Leaning back in his seat, he gently stroked the scar on his forehead, trying to soothe the pain. It was late at night and Hermione and Ron were asleep downstairs. It was getting more difficult for Harry to sleep. As the stress grew, the nightmares increased.
“Draco, please open the door, I just… I just want to talk,” Harry was saying. “Please, Draco? I’m sorry for what happened, and…”
“Why? Why do you need to know? Will you die, or something, if you don’t know? You don’t need to know anything, this shit doesn’t concern you!” Harry furiously wiped his eyes to the point where they were burning of the dryness, refusing to cry.
After the two pulled apart, Draco stared at Harry for a few seconds, “So the reason you decided to meet up in the late hours of the night in the library was to make out with me?”
I hope you liked this chapter! Let me know your thoughts! Sorry this chapter was so short.
His heart sank as Astoria emerged, walking down the aisle slowly as the music played. “Oh, fuck,” he whispered. As she finally reached him, she nodded in sympathy, because this was it. This was the end to whatever Draco and Harry were, if they even were anything anymore.
“Still?” He asked, taking off his glasses, massaging his temples as he sat down beside Ron. “It’s not my fault that I don’t have feelings for her.”
Harry was practically giddy on Saturday morning. He happily got out of bed, got ready and went for breakfast.
All Draco could do was look down in shame.
“Hmm?” he practically tore his gaze off of Harry, looking over at his friend.
“Okay, no, let go of that,” Draco said, but the owl was fast. It flew out of reach. “Okay, no. That’s not the letter you’re supposed to send.”
“Harry, you didn’t even ask if I could come?” Draco whisper-shouted, before turning to face Molly Weasley. “I really don’t mean to bother you guys… I think it’s best if I go-”
Draco picked up the Invisibility Cloak which was on the couch, slowly opening the door, looking over at Harry, rolling his eyes when he noticed him struggling to put on his shoes.
“As much fun that dance break was, yes,” Draco replied, getting to his feet.
studying?”
“Okay…” Harry whispered, nodding as he put his glasses back on, biting his lip, still frowning.
“I’m only kidding! Calm down.”
“I didn’t know you cry a lot.”
Hermione and Ron didn’t question the shift in Harry’s behavior. He had been fine Christmas day, but the whole week after, he went back to barely talking to anyone. They didn’t want to keep prying. He had already seemed tired of their worrying.
“Yes, of course,” Draco said, turning and leaving. He made his way to his parents’ wing of the mansion, walking down the cold, empty hallways. He almost couldn’t believe that just a day ago him and Harry were kissing. “Mother, how are you feeling?” he signed as he entered. She looked up, eyes widening.
The next day, Harry walked to the tent to check on how things were. He noticed that the two jumpers he had left were gone, to replaced by something else.
deserve. And what is a woman to do, when so honestly presented with all the grime and glory of death, but to beg for one final dose of cosmic morphine?
So really, he shouldn’t have been surprised that the second he laid a finger on her wrist, Draco Malfoy dragged him back to the main room by what seemed like sheer will alone.
Harry let her eyelids flutter shut, felt the warmth of Draco’s breath against her parted lips. “Oh, for fuck’s sake, won’t you kiss me you absolute—”
), but instead, she took a deep breath and kept it all inside, just like she’d done for the past fifteen years. This was a man who’d spent over a decade in solitary confinement— she knew that all he wanted was a response, something, anything at all. And somewhere deep, deep down inside, she knew that he was just as hurt as she was, that he also lost a brother, a best friend, a lover. She also knew that silence would hurt him the most, so she gave him nothing
One of the things Harry had found during her salvation of the dusty Potter Cottage was a big, brown chest tucked into the corner of James’ study, seemingly unlocked yet absolutely impossible to open. By the time she’d reached the top floor, Harry was already running on roughly 34 hours of no sleep, and when paired with the fact that she’d read every single political analysis James had ever written, things weren’t looking too good for her sanity.
No matter how hard she tried, Harry just couldn’t understand how anyone could buy into the absurd notion that love was driven by a higher force. She refused to believe that it was something that just
“Home won’t ever leave us alone, will it?” Cedric asked lightly, glancing over his shoulder to smile knowingly at her. It scared her, just how easily this boy, with his messy, sun-streaked hair and his perpetually twinkling eyes, could read her. Almost like he could sense her emotions before she even had the chance to.
the dogs, so she shot her square in the chest before she had the chance to devour him.
“I haven’t exactly figured that one out yet,” Hermione replied, almost annoyed that there was a question she couldn’t answer, “When you apparate, you’re essentially relocating yourself from one spot and simultaneously appearing in another, as quick as the thought that prompts it. But as far as I’ve read, not even Dumbledore himself can apparate to a place he’s never been before.”
“We come here everyday, and sit at opposite tables. I write clever yet heartwarming stories about all the regulars here: about the grumpy old man, standing right at death’s doorstep, absolutely hell-bent on feeding every stray cat possible before he goes. About the middle aged cashier, stuck in a foreign country where he knows none and is loved by even less, yet never fails to ask after everyone else’s kids. About the teenage waitress, so characteristically ready to run away but simultaneously determined to make every moment count, because she knows better than most that nothing in life is truly guaranteed. Meanwhile you sketch them into life, smearing charcoal onto coffee cups, across your face, somehow into your hair. Together, we unknowingly preserve this very moment into a sort of artistic immortality that not even time can wither.
that morning. All she knew was that it smelled like cardamom and honey and the air was cool on her burning skin. The sky-blue, Moroccan-tiled walls were far far away and finally, she had some room to fucking
The second Harry stepped into
Harry loved how everyone was all dressed up to impress no one at all, clad in their finest suits and prettiest dresses, loved the soft, sweet sounds of choir and the distant mumbles of happy conversation, of families and friends reunited at last. Most of all, she found comfort in the complete anonymity it brought, loved the feeling of sinking into a crowd and being but one of a thousand lost souls who didn’t really know what the fuck they were doing with their lives, either. So what if she didn’t exactly believe in every bit of scripture or pray every time she was meant to— that didn’t stop her from loving church, and everything that went into it.
?”Harry couldn’t come close to describing how she felt. Somewhere between
But she didn’t mean that— nothing about Draco was even remotely filthy. She was spotless, every arch and bow in her face precisely drawn and every movement of her body strictly calculated, a macabre version of a prima ballerina. When Harry looked at Draco, she saw equal parts wolf and snake, and she wondered which side would win.
In the ebony doorframe stood Uncle Padfoot, dressed in a crop top riddled in artfully positioned holes and wrapped up in Moony’s frayed denim jacket. His hair was wind-tousled and his cheeks were bitten red with cold, and Harry could see a million and two stars swirling in the grey of his eyes, begging to be threaded into constellations. He smiled at her like he knew her and looked at her like he loved her, and when he stepped forward, Harry wanted to let herself break.
“No, I promise—” She attempted between fits of giggles, trying her best to climb up onto his shoulders and extend a hand down for him to shake, “I’ll give you a chocolate if you run me to the house?”
No matter how many years passed, Harry could never seem to outgrow the childlike sense of wonder that filled her everytime she set foot in a church. She wouldn’t say she was particularly devout— in fact, she had a lot of things to say to God, and most of them were rather unpleasant— but there was something about the grand, undeniable beauty of it all that captivated her, and St. Paul’s Cathedral was as grand and beautiful as churches came. Gilded ivory pillars held up a domed ceiling towering so far above her head that its painted angels might as well have been genuine, and the low-hanging chandeliers cast a warm glow over the vast space, being the only source of illumination besides the twinkling fairy lights strung around two massive evergreens, all decked out in holly and pine.
“We begin to sit closer and closer, sharing mismatched thoughts between puffs of cherry-rolled cigarettes. You can feel yourself falling for me, a slow trickle at first and then a crashing typhoon of emotions, so heavy on your poor, damaged heart that you can barely bear to hold it all in. But I’m achingly cold and dauntingly mysterious— I only want what I can’t have, and you know that. So you never confess your love, and neither do I. We begin to slowly forget this place— either the owners go bankrupt, or we are simply pulled apart by the meddling strings of fate. But we never forget each other, despite the decades of separation. We grow old apart, never quite knowing what would’ve happened with the one that got away.”
In the corner of that room, just a few steps away from the corpses of her parents, sat a beast, legs curled into a heaving chest. His hair was dark, messy, and tinged with blood, as if he’d spent hours raking his fingers through it, and his eyes were frantic, grey as storm clouds and dripping tears like last night’s rain. It was his arms that gave him away, though, soaked to the elbows in crimson blood. Later, she would be told that he was holding a knife; onyx black and wolf-headed, carved with three tiny initials that would keep a man behind bars for the remainder of his life: S.O.B.
“Yeah, well, you’re not the first girl to call my willy remarkable,” Harry half-grinned, half-winced as Hermione tightened the final piece of gauze around her waist.
She could tell where they came from, how old their money was, if they had it at all. She could tell if a man was armed by the raise of his eyebrows, could weed out a spy by the way the light shone through her eyes. When you grow up the way Harry Potter had to, you waste no time coming to the realization that pretty distractions are an unaffordable tax when the price was staying alive.
she’d thought.
As she strode through the dimly lit halls, she couldn’t help but replay the last couple of days in her memory: the party, the Burrow, Hermione, Sirius, Draco. She’d woken up in the bathtub— no one could move her, not even Ginny— with a sore neck and even more questions to ask. She demanded to be bonded immediately, and lucky for her, the Weasleys happened to have a patch of willstones in their backyard, fresh for the picking just in case another one decided to pop out. Hermione insisted on giving her a rundown of everything she wasn’t allowed to do, first— the Dark Arts, blood magic, and the Unforgivable Curses. The ritual itself was strange, but not too difficult; a fire, some chanting, an oath, some pain— nothing Harry hadn’t encountered before. She picked the stone out herself: a bloodstone, emerald green and flecked in scarlet, smooth and pretty as a dragon’s egg. Speaking of dragons— she thought of Draco, who had slipped away sometime in the early morning, without a single trace; even the throw-pillows were perfectly in place.
“Hawareek, bas bas ashan enta be’eyt sheb hlewa.” (
The other part of the uneasy feeling swirling in Harry’s untouched champagne glass was something she couldn’t quite explain with words: an anxious buzz of energy floating through the air. It was raw power, the likes of which she had only encountered twice before: what was presented to her the day Cedric died, and what began to grow within her the day her parents did. Deep down, she knew exactly what it was: five letters that held so much more than a single word ever should. But Harry wasn’t insane, and she wouldn’t have anyone else believing so either, so she pushed her worry down to the pit of her stomach and decided to focus on a more pressing matter instead. So, she opened the bathroom door.
“That they choose people and make us want them,” Pansy spoke from Draco’s right, her nearly-black eyes glowing with barely-contained mischief, “Lure them in, make us believe it’s real. Call it fate, or soulmates, or pheromones.”
“We didn’t take you anywhere, Harry,” Hermione explained, speaking slowly now, as if afraid to startle the beast, “You brought us here. I’m guessing you used apparition, although I have no bloody idea how you pulled that one off. Technically, it’s impossible to side-along without physical contact, and you were only touching Draco. Also, you don’t have a willstone, so technically, it should also be impossible for you to do any sort of magic at all, aside from perhaps blowing bubbles, or blooming flowers, but definitely not apparating six people at once.”
“Because there are a million universes where you get to be happy, Harry. There are none for me.” And then she got up and walked away, church bells chiming in her wake.
She seemed to ask.
The fact that she never wore her glasses on night runs probably made things much worse. She knew it was both very stupid and very dangerous, but she’d never had much reason to care; no one but her boss would miss her. Really, she found the galvanizing fear to be a rather vital component in improving her mile minutes. But she couldn’t help but think that that had changed, in the past week— she’d seen Ron and Hermione almost every day, poring over document after document and brainstorming for hours, all to no avail. Every so often another member of their quirky and obscure group of friends would pop in through the fireplace (which Harry couldn’t get used to, no matter how many times Hermione explained that it— she’d honestly rather them pop out of thin air), with Ginny being by far the most useless and Dean being the most helpful, although his boyfriend did “accidentally” blow up the back porch. It was really easy for the three of them to fall into a pattern— Hermione had endless patience and brilliant cross-referencing skills, Harry had unkillable motivation and a good eye for ostensible details, and Ron was really, really good at doing what he’s meant to and doing it well. She wasn’t used to feeling so
Harry turned her attention to Draco, who was sitting cross-legged, elbow resting on her knee and head placed casually in her gentle palm, seemingly collected despite her bloodshot eyes. Harry made a point of staring directly there, and not anywhere below. “If Sirius didn’t kill my parents, then who did?”
, not without worrying she’d get her hand cut off for stealing. She also hadn’t had such good company in a long time (ever, really); she felt at ease around them, like she could finally let her guard down and
“Watch your mouth, Potter,” Draco warned, and tightened her legs around the back of the chair, “I’m the one asking the questions, remember?”
, they told him,
“I wouldn’t fuck you if you were the last woman alive, Malfoy.” Harry avowed, but the fire in her eyes said otherwise.
motherfucking damsel. She would not be intimidated, by suspected mafiosi or otherwise.
Like most decisions she’d made in the recent past, Harry had no idea why she’d decided to walk into
obsessive.” She took a step forward, so there was barely a foot of space between them, and brought her tiny, ringless hand up to Harry’s sternum. She let it hover over her willstone, hanging by a thin golden chain, and Harry stopped breathing altogether, intoxicated with anticipation. “It’s quite strange, haven’t you noticed?”
“Uh oh,” Draco ran the gun over the left side of her face, then the right, “I warned you once already, Potter. I don’t like girls with dirty mouths,” She placed the muzzle softly over Harry’s pretty pink lips, pushed downwards oh so slowly, until they were parting open and ready, “Want me to clean it out for you?”
She also knew that her father had been a journalist, could perfectly remember the chilly winter days she spent wrapped up in his lap as he read book after book after book, and wrote page after page after page until even his trusty old typewriter decided that enough was enough, and insisted that he take his daughter out to the yard, where she would chase after burying ferrets and shake the snow off of dying leaves. What she didn’t remember, however, was her father hiding things, or why he hid them, or how to fucking un-hide them
Harry realized, and a feeling both oddly vivacious and entirely familiar fired up inside of her. Draco might have been a dead man, but Harry wasn’t, and she would
“Hello Cedric,” She replied, pronouncing his name with the french
“There’s an old wives tale,” Draco said as she leaned into Harry, her voice low and smooth as skipping stones, “That our willstones have will.”
For once, Harry wasn’t surprised to see her; in fact, it seemed as though today, she was the one doing the surprising, if the way Malfoy’s eyes widened as she looked her up and down (and then down again) was any indication. It was a Malfoy wedding, and usually, that meant dark, but today, Draco was the softest Harry had ever seen her. Her dress was floor length, baby blue flecked with gold sparkles that seemed to shift into constellations, and Harry supposed they actually might be. Her hair was pinned away from her face, laced with tufts of baby’s breath.
into an
“El ha’ea ya Millie,”
Harry wanted to scream. It was the only thing she’d been able to think of, from the moment she’d woken up on the dusty warehouse floor, unbound and unharmed. “Fuck you,” she said instead.
Before she could say another word, Harry slapped Draco, hard and fast, a satisfying
Then, a storm poorly disguised as a girl barged in, and caught Harry’s wrist firmly in her hand. It was the dark-skinned siren from before, her expression both deeply understanding and disapproving. “No,” she said, and pushed Harry’s hand down from where she’d been holding a blade against Sirius’ neck.
were they fucking sinful), nor did it have anything to do with the glowing smoke stone hanging in the milky white hollow of her throat, doing everything it physically could to draw Harry in. No, Draco’s power did not lie in the animate world; it lay in the future, in all the things she could twist herself into becoming.
they were; she wasn’t quite accustomed to having that sort in her life, and spending 17 years in cold, stony Britain had done nothing to extinguish the flaming hearth of homesickness which burned ceaselessly behind the rungs of her ribcage. And sure, Edinburgh was no Baghdad, but for now, it was just about close enough.
After breakfast, they cleared the table and spread out all of Hermione’s journals instead— which was a lot, to say the least. Harry was kind of baffled to find out that someone else had been researching the Godric Hollow murders as intensely and obsessively as she had, but for the most part, she was just grateful that she didn’t have to go through it all alone. After roughly an hour and a half, they’d gathered that they were roughly on the same page: the Iraqi government was possibly involved, the Blacks were probably involved, and the Malfoys were
He pulled his glasses off and tucked them into his shirt, then gave a subtly unsubtle glance towards the wall behind her.
“Waladna keber!”
Theodora screamed, eyes aflame with rage, “Ha’ata’ rejleyk men eydeyk we a’kalk le klebi el jawena.”
anymore, though, seeing as I’m about to get disowned, but—”
“Noo, don’t take my dragon away, daddy,” Draco mumbled, rolling across the floor. Harry couldn’t help but admire her exemplary diligence at being the center of attention, even when drunk and unconscious.
She could hear Cedric’s charming “Esh rayek etwareny?”
“I don’t like wasting time.” Harry replied, and closed her eyes.
“That they choose us, and not the other way around,” Blaise spoke from Draco’s left, lazily resting his chin in his palm, a man with all the time in the world. Harry noticed a gleaming silver snake twisting its way around his middle finger: the sign of the baby serpents. They all wore them, a crooked form of a children’s friendship charm.
She knew all the documents they couldn’t burn but didn’t want anyone to find were kept here, in this dull, barren warehouse, hidden amongst the achingly mundane. But she couldn’t find a single thing to tie Lea to the Notts; there was no birth certificate, no vaccine card, no school registration form. Nott hadn’t just covered his tracks— he'd buried them, and he’d buried them well.
“Alright,” Harry said, pushing herself back against the wall as Sirius gasped for air, “Alright.”
“But why would I come here?” Harry asked. The words “magic” and “willstones” rang in her ears like tinnitus, but she held back.
“Yes, Potter, I think we’ve already established that you want to shag me,” Draco smirked, swirling the glass in her hand so that the ice cubes clinked together, softly. She looked
Harry thought,
“I guess you’d believe me now if I told you I wasn’t following you,” Draco said. She was beautiful in a way that reminded Harry of the snowflakes piling up on the pavement: intricately complex, cold, and right on the verge of disappearing.
Everything in Harry’s life had changed, but Draco Malfoy stood still, as if waiting for the rediscovery. The fear had left her, though, and her platinum hair was slightly longer now, brushing her pretty collarbones and framing her face. She was a little bit taller than Harry, but then again that could have easily been the red bottoms she wore, sharp enough to act as a weapon in and of themselves. She really was deadly; her lithe frame was draped in a silk slip dress that fell perfectly at mid-thigh, stained the color of midnight and doing a maddening job of accentuating every delicate dip and curve of her body. Harry noticed several swirling black lines decorating her milky white skin, and had to hold herself back from the overwhelming urge to
“I’m sure—” Harry began, but was cut off with a hastily muttered “I’ll be back,” followed by a quick scuffle of a chair, and suddenly she was sitting alone, staring at the bright red vinyl of the seat before her.
it. And yet despite that, Harry couldn’t trace a single violent crime back to her in five whole years; she was sure there had to be
Harry looked to her right, and felt her heart twist inside her chest as she watched a little girl curl up in her mother’s lap, wide eyes blinking blearily as she did her best to fight off sleep. Harry looked to her left, and felt her heart twist yet again as she saw Draco Malfoy, wide eyes as distant and empty as they’d ever been.
“So if I’m… magic, too, then why am I so sensitive to them? Everytime I’m in a room with more than two willstones, I get nauseous.” Harry asked, drawing in a breath as Hermione ran her hand across the wound, muttering in a far away language, her willstone glowing in the hollow of her throat. Harry could feel her skin knit itself back together beneath her palms— it was a strangely satisfying feeling.
“Oh, so you weren’t?” Harry quipped back, but she didn’t have it in her to sound suspicious, even though she knew she probably should be. Not anymore, not after everything.
In a cozy little living space littered with pretty trinkets, souvenirs, and odd floating objects were three deadly sirens, a runaway murderer, the sole heir to two of London’s largest crime syndicates, a ginger boy wearing polka dotted pajama bottoms, and Harry, bleeding out onto the otherwise perfectly pristine hardwood floors. She tried to get up, but her knees gave out beneath her and she crashed into the floor, right back to where she came from.
Her. It’s always been her.
Harry’s very useful brain quipped, “Or if you’re actually the Chosen One,” Harry struggled and squirmed, but Draco’s weight was solid atop hers, her thighs wrapped tightly around Harry’s quivering midsection, “Hell, I don’t care if you’re Merlin himself,” Harry attempted to get ahold of the energy in the room, tried to twist it to her favour, but it slipped through her fingertips like hot sand; she couldn’t focus, no matter how hard she tried, “You do
She knew that for her, there was no choice; there was the horrors at night and there was this during the day, and that was that.
The thing about Draco Malfoy, Harry thought, was that she had a face like shattered glass. In her she saw her filthiest vices and her purest virtues, the things she smoked when she wanted to forget and the things she held onto when she needed to remember. She was a serpent through and through, and had somehow managed to build a home for herself behind Harry’s shaking ribs and right next to her heart: a brilliant vantage point, if one ever thought to strike.
“but her father has copies of practically every single magical newspaper ever printed, so we keep her around. Also, she’s pretty hot.” The ginger girl grinned slyly, and Harry was keenly reminded of a fox. Luna smiled and waved, a far away look on her soft-featured face.
“So, Harry Potter, what brings you to this grand establishment?” Draco asked, voice low and condescending.
Harry was pretty fucking close now, alright, close to squeezing the life out of this motherfucker’s eyes and sending him right back down to where he came from. She thought she felt arms trying to pull her off, push her off, peel her fingers off, anything at all, but she didn’t budge.
He gave her a real, slimy grin, and for the first time, Harry saw something truly disgusting in Cedric: she saw all his want, and none of his fear.
Gone were the flickering flames of youth, but in their place was a roaring, steady fire, burning beneath her skin and glowing through the smoke colored stone hanging around her neck.
Draco looked like she was dying to kiss her, her red lips parted slightly and her eyes aflame, and just for a second, Harry let herself forget; she let herself forget everything they were, let herself forget that she was Harry Potter and that was Draco Malfoy, let herself forget that they lived in a world were those words meant two very different things. Their lips were a millisecond away from collision when Harry realized just how long she’d wanted this, how badly she ached for it, how every bone in her body seemed to be screaming
“People are like snakes,” Draco said, her words lulled in the slur of alcohol and God knows what else, and pulled a ring off of her finger. She reached for Harry’s hand, and Harry let her take it, shivered at the feel of soft fingertips against her own, careful and able as they slipped the cold metal through her knuckles. “They shed skin and regrow.”
“Well, time to move this one, then,” Ginny decided, and carried her bridal style to the couch, then set her down gently. Harry wondered why they were being so good to Draco, if they really were on her side. Maybe they were just good people— Maybe they knew what it was like, to be a little kid caught up in something much more sinister than yourself.
” Draco hissed, her face only centimeters above Harry’s own, her eyes filled with a sort of malice she hadn’t seen in a long, long time, “If you’re some sort of magical prodigy,”
a part of her screamed. Harry resolutely ignored it.
She’d arrived at Godric’s Hollow just before the strike of midnight on Christmas Eve, and couldn’t help but think about how fitting the name was for a place like this. It was entirely untouched and hollow of anything with a soul; even the marigolds in the back garden had wilted and blown away a long, long time ago. The floor creaked uneasily beneath her feet, but Harry found that ultimately, this house accepted her.
“Mhm,” He continued, “Jet wi haketly ahla hkeya.”
“Why do you care, Draco?” Her name in Harry’s mouth was as sharp as a weapon, as ugly as a snare; I know your vulnerabilities, she screamed, and I will not hesitate to use them against you. “Isn’t daddy disowning you, anyway?”
and pulling the
And then the door flew open.
, for the first time that night. He looked good— his suit dark, expensive, and tailored just so; his newly salt and pepper beard perfectly groomed; his hair black as the night and artfully pulled up, as effortlessly beautiful as always. He was the spitting image of everything a Black was meant to be: dark, handsome, and mysterious, a pure-bred wolf among the stray dogs. Harry thought of every night she’d had a nap for dinner and every winter she’d had more holes in her coat than pounds in the bank, and she resented the fuck out of him. Harry Potter hated Sirius Black because he was everything she wanted, and everything she’d never be able to have.
He leaned in further, his voice barely a whisper yet entirely audible, “Hkeya an el banat eli bitkhabuhm mini. Mosh eyb, heyk?”
“I promised to kill you, remember?” Harry whispered. As the light faded, she couldn’t help but think that Draco looked like an angel, her hair haloed by the rising sun. Slowly, she began to remember.
“Millie, meet Julie. Julie, this is Millie. We met in—” Cedric began.
Draco disappeared, as she always did. Ron returned, and Harry watched him watch Hermione through the stain-glass window, watched the way his whole body sprang up at the sight of her crossing the street, like a flower wilting in reverse. Harry smiled, just a tiny, little bit.
Harry tried to convince herself,
“Why’d you save me, you beautiful fool?” She heard a voice sob, somewhere far, far away. She saw Draco, kneeling above her, tears streaming relentlessly down her hollow cheeks. She was pushing down on Harry’s wound, begging,
“And you believe that?” Harry asked, leaning forward to look Draco in the eye.
“I will very nicely agree to not kill all of you,” Harry panted, blood both hers and not slipping through her fingertips and her vision taninted and blurry, “under three conditions,” she hooked her claws into all the energy floating through the air, twisted it through her agony and spit it right back out, “three,” the room filled with gasps, grunts, heavy breathing, “fucking,”
“Two,” she said, “someone passes me a goddamn smoke.”
“Think you’re mighty cool, eh?” Remus replied, grin barely contained as he swung the little girl up into the air while she desperately clutched onto the long pointed witch hat she refused to take off. “Too cool for little old Moony, hmm?”
The thing about pain, Harry thought as she bled out onto the shining ivory floors, was that it does everything it can to make sure you feel it. It crawls beneath your skin like filthy parasites, twists into your veins like the flames of hell, squeezes your organs into whiskey wet rags until all you can do is feel God’s wrath crash into you, the waves of an Abrahamic typhoon you
At that moment, Harry was all the way in 1960s America. She imagined she’d ran away from her small rural town, dissatisfied with the wearying expectations thrust upon a colored woman such as herself, and starving for just the tiniest taste of something real. She had no plan whatsoever— she was tired of the restraints, and craved true spontaneity— in all honesty, she’d probably end up getting murdered by one serial killer or the other. Harry wondered what exactly it said about her that all her happiest fantasies ended up with her dead in a ditch, somewhere far, far away.
Draco took her hand and pulled it up to her willstone, gently wrapping Harry’s fingers around it. Draco’s eyes fluttered shut and Harry had to take a long, deep breath to steady herself; it was as if every nerve in her body was on fire, warmth and power flowing through her at an unimaginable concentration. When she looked up, she found a dozen baby pink butterflies floating through the room.
. Harry looked down and saw blood on her hands.
Shut the fuck up before I shove this croissont up your ass, you fucking wanker.
“Oh, I’m sure you’d love that,” Draco purred, running her free hand up Harry’s sternum and back down again, then leaning down to whisper in her ear, “Want your hands all over me, don’t you? On my thighs, my waist, just a little bit below, a little bit above? But we can’t have everything we want, can we now?”
Millie pinched his cheek, and Harry threw up inside her mouth, “Meen kan momken ekhamin ena malaakna Cedric hayetla’ alil adab heyk?”
“I don’t give a
But for now, she was okay with just sitting here, in this pretty 60s themed diner with it's black & white checkerboard floors and the quirky license plates hung up on the walls and the jukebox in the corner playing a constant loop of Beatles classics, John Lennon’s mystic words floating through the hazy mid-afternoon air.
Draco gasped. “Leave it alone! It hurts.” He giggled again.
Harry looked completely blank after Draco ended his rant. “That’s a question for Hermione.” he said.
That thought got Harry up. He threw the covers off of himself as if they burned his skin and left the massive bedroom. When he entered the sitting room, he cast a lumos and saw Malfoy lying on the floor, still fully awake, just like himself.
“What is it my boy?” Dumbledore asked, concerned.
“I don’t want to do it if you’re not ready, then.”
Draco's eyes widened drastically and he became a rosy pink that complimented his pale complection. "Um - I, uh - what - who - um.." he stuttered. Harry thought he looked very cute. He took in a deep, shaky breath and ran his hands through his hair again. He paused for a moment before he abruptly stood and left the kitchen without another word.
Harry nodded. Snape fled the common room, but McGonagall remained.
“Harry!” He cried. “Harry I'm sick. I'm so sick.” Draco let the tears flow free. His time of trying to avoid acknowledging this cold that had taken over his body had come to an end in his Harry’s arms.
“Get-off of me! Malfoy!” Harry pushed and pulled at the blond to try to get himself detached, so he could run away from this odd version of Malfoy that seemed to surface.
“Hermione would be proud.” Draco said, still chuckling and wiping at his eyes.
“Make love to me.” Harry moaned.
“Ok, alright. I’ll ‘get to know him’, but only because I know you’ll kill me if I don’t.”
Harry was leaning so far off his seat, subconsciously trying to get closer to the blond, to the magnificent sent of the Omega, that he was surprised he didn't fall off. He snapped up from his daze as he heard the minister call on him to make his statement towards Draco.
Draco smiled, arching up into Harry’s touch. “Mm no more talk of him.” He leant down and suckled on Harry’s neck, making his way up to this ear; Harry continued groping Draco’s arse and rutting up into him. Draco licked the shell of Harry’s ear. “Take me to bed, darling.”
“We’ll be ok. We’ll get through this, remember?” Draco repeated the words from their wedding, from when Harry was promised to Draco forever, and when Draco sincerely wanted to be there with him every step of the way.
“I wouldn’t be working with you though. I will be sorting through mail to see what belongs in which section of the ministry, in a dirty old basement alongside criminals and thugs- wait….” Draco paused and a look of pure offense fitted his face. Harry shifted in his seat, knowing what was coming next.
Draco hugged him tightly before retreating back into his library. Harry quickly sent Ron a reply, then  went to their room to change before flooing to the three broomsticks in Hogsmeade. He hated aparating.
He nodded. “Ok”, he whispered lightly.
“No, Malfoy. I don’t want that,” Harry groaned. He turned to Hermione sitting beside him. “How am I supposed to watch over this sex-crazed monster?”
“It’s not abandoned.” Harry laughed.
“Then what did you do?” Hermione questioned.
"No, this is better. This is perfect. Thank you." Harry smiled and started down the stairs once again to be stopped by Draco calling after him. "Potter, I - I just wanted to say," he paused and took a deep breath."I didn't have a way out. I was going to go to Azkaban, I should've gone to Azkaban, but you... you gave me a way out. And for that, I'm eternally grateful. And now, for all of this," he gestured around himself, "giving me a place to stay when I really don't deserve it, especially from you. I just - you don't know how much this means to me." He finished quietly, not meeting Harry's eye.
As the days passed since their wedding, Draco felt more and more drained. He felt unprepared for what came with this marriage. At first, Harry didn’t want anything to do with him, and now he doesn’t want anything to do with Harry. This whole situation was so fucked up. He just didn’t know what to do. He didn’t know if it was even worth trying to build a relationship with the boy, because every time he tried, something would cause them to fight and break apart. He never has had good relationships with people.
Yes, he was an Omega, and yes he knew he’d changed. War changes everybody. He quickly realized that all the shit he did and believed during his younger years was all fake and nothing he wanted to be apart of. However, he wasn't ready to tell anyone, let alone Harry Potter, about his new inheritance. That made him question though, just how did Harry know?
Snape was now standing, leaning over his desk menacingly, with his hands spread far apart to hold himself up, seeming to keep all of his restraint from reaching forward and strangling Harry with his bare hands.
“You use a flooing system for the mail?” Draco scoffed.
After being given the potions with strict directions Draco was sure to follow, the two men made their way back to their temporary home at Grimmauld Place.
“Harry! Oh my gosh Harry, please!” It was Hermione. She was crying.
Draco shook his head. “What…” he whispered,
“What’s w-wrong with me?” Harry cried. “Why did this h-h-happen to me? Why do all bad things-s happen t-to me?” He hiccuped as he furiously wiped tears from his eyes and cheeks.
“Very well. I will need to speak with Professor Trelawney, and I will call you and Mr Malfoy back here after lunch. Is there anything else you wish to tell me?” Dumbledore asked, writing on a piece of parchment.
“Well, Ronald, since we are to spend the rest of our lives together, lest we die, we decided to put our past animosity behind us and actually get to know each other.” Harry said.
I've always wanted to fly
“Granger?” Harry nodded. “Alright.”
“I didn’t bring a bathing suit, remember?” Harry asked went Draco told him what he wanted to do.
“Ok, but why did you kiss me, and why did you call me ’Dray’? You’ve never even called me by my first name, now you’re onto pet names?”
Draco was happily sinking ball after ball in the netted holes of the table, playing by himself, when a man came up to his table, watching him closely. The bar was busy, being a Friday night, but it wasn’t overly packed where people were pushing up against one another. In fact, Draco could spot multiple other empty pool tables at the back of the bar. The man didn’t say anything, just watched Draco for a few minutes. Deeming him harmless, Draco continued his one-person game, all the while Harry watched from the bar.
“I’m serious, though. What is your favourite thing to do.” Harry crossed his elbows on the table and leant on them, as one would do if they were immersed in an interesting conversation.
“Sleep, you mean. Because if you think anything else will happen, you’re poorly mistaken.” Harry said, shrugging the frail body off of his. He gathered his things and waited by the dorm entrance for the nuisance.
Enjoy!
It took a second, but Draco nodded. “Yeah, I guess so.”
When he got to the eagle and muttered the password - fizzing wizbees- he was taken up to the door and let into the office.
Harry nervously shuffled his feet as he looked to see Draco's sad expression.
“Yes, actually. I checked on him this morning, and still, his physical abilities still look good and healthy. His magical core is much stronger. I’ve consulted a Spell-Damage specialist, and she took an immediate interest in your case. I was just on my way to bring her to you and Mr Potter for her to consult with you directly.”
She looked scandalised. “I’m not planning anything. Harry asked me to come over and talk to you about your inheritance. I know that you’re wary about people knowing, but I promise, he’s only told Ron and I. He found out the day of your trial, and wasn’t aware then that you didn’t want anyone to know. We haven’t told anyone and we don’t plan to. We also won’t use this information for anything. We only want to help you.”
Draco was worried. He was upset at the fact that Harry was probably lying to him, and he was anxious about how Harry felt towards him.
“I seriously doubt she will. Just the way she looked at me after, it was like nothing even happened.”
“Draco? Babe? You alright?” He asked, peering into the bathroom.
Harry was clearly very confused with Draco’s behaviour. “About what? Being married to you? I’ll joke about it all I fucking want, you fucking prick.” Harry rebuked.
Walkins had been filled in by the research Hermione had done, her having the same in-depth information told to her as Hermione had done for Harry and Draco.
Harry sat back in his chair, fiddling with a quill when his gorgeous boyfriend swept into the room, filling it with his brightness and ohmygodyes scent. A grin made its way on Harry’s face before he knew it.
“What’ll it be, Draco?” the barman asked. Draco had visited John’s pool hall/bar since he took over his business five years prior. He and his employees would play pool after a particularly frustrating day, or just to have a night out with each other.
Once they arrived, she ushered the two of them into her office to have privacy during their discussion.
“The hate and anger that courses through the air when you two meet, hides what truly lies beneath. You will end up with the one you least expect, signing off on old magic will be the cause for you to connect. Do not heed this as a warning, but a guide, that you will need the boy with blond hair and grey eyes.”
“You’re so sexy.” Harry breathed in Draco’s peach-smelling hair.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So you’re liking the work? See, it’s not too bad. Are they treating you well? Do I need to speak with anyone down there?” Harry asked, sitting up straighter, the topic of Draco’s safety clearly a serious issue to him.
“Me too, mate. You know we’ve always got your back. We’re the golden trio!” Ron had joined them, munching on a sandwich that he’d probably snagged from one of the hors d’oeuvres trays.
Harry kissed up Draco’s thighs softly and gently, making his way towards the delicious looking prick. Man, it was huge. He licked up the shaft slowly until he reached the head, at which point he engulfed as much as he could into his mouth.
“Neither did I.” I reply quietly.
Oh, hello. Sorry I haven't updated this in a while. It's been on my mind for days but I've been super busy. This chapter is very long and it has taken a lot to write it. The next few chapters should come easy and I'm hoping to post again soon. This one is full of fluff and Drarry, I hope you like it! It's been a challenge to write, but I'm not giving up. Please please review! :)
"Guys, guys, I'm fine. Draco-he's fine." Harry said, trying to calm his frantic friends. "I might have exploded on a few of the Wizengamont's wizards because they were making these absurd claims that Draco could have just said 'no' to Voldemort's commands. Yeah, he could've, and then gotten himself killed." Harry explained, starting out slowly,  gauging his friends' expressions, before raising his voice, anger coursing through him again as he thought of what had just happened.
Draco knew that it wasn’t just fucking. Even pansy confirmed it. For some reason though, he didn’t want to say what they were both thinking, because that would imply that he was thinking about him and Harry, which somehow translated to him being vulnerable, which he was extremely insecure about. He wanted to hear Harry say it so that he wasn’t the only one being vulnerable; to prove that he wasn’t the only one thinking about what they were.
“That’s so hot when you call me that.” Harry whispered close to his ear.
“Malfoy?!” Weasley choked on his tea, wiping at his eyes.
Harry sat up and pushed the boy off of him. “No. I’m not.” Ron immediately turned to him from ushering people back to their seats, coming to give his best mate a hand. As Ron helped him up and Hermione soon joined them, he scowled down at the blond who sat worriedly on the carpet. He was about to speak when Harry got there first. “Leave me alone, Malfoy. Damn you.” And with that, he turned on his heal and fled the hall.
Draco sat back on his heels.
“I didn’t know I needed it until you gave it to me, Draco.”
Kingsley sighed before addressing the blond. "Well, Mr. Malfoy," he looked up at the sound of his name. "after reviewing your case and the claims made against you, the majority of the Wizengamont Council has voted that you are found," he paused for dramatic effect, "not guilty."
A moment. “Is that why you always leave?”
Harry winced and tried to reply with an apologetic smile for his earlier outburst, but the Minister turned his back and started speaking to one of the aurors. Harry watched as the auror nodded to whatever Kingsley had said, and gestured to another auror that stood in front of the side door that Harry knew was where Draco was being held behind. The auror opened the door and out came another auror, gently guiding the pale-looking Omega to the seat in the middle of the room again.
Harry warily picked up his cup and took a sip. Perfect. “You’re not mad?” He asked, genuinely curious about her reaction. He thought she’d be bouncing off the walls at this point, but instead she sat across from him, drinking her tea as if they were just discussing the weather.
“You didn’t mark me.” Draco whispered.
Draco opened his eyes and looked deeply into Harry's. A whispered “Yeah?” escaped his lips.
“No, Harry, what are you doing? No, no, don’t- Harry!” Malfoy cried. Harry was able to free himself and dart away, leaving Malfoy on the bathroom floor, just as he found him- distressed and crying.
“Yes?” He inquired softly.
“Oh, piss off, you great twat.”
“Well, you can stay if you want to. Kingsley wouldn’t mind if you took the afternoon off. There are others that could do your work if you wanted.” Harry said, rounding his desk and sitting in his overly large chair.
“Ok honey.” Harry kissed his forehead and quickly slipped out of bed to get the potions from their bathroom. When he returned with three different vials, he uncorked them and set them on the nightstand beside his lover. “Anything else I can get you?” He placed the back of his hand to Draco's head before sharply inhaling. “Sweetheart you're burning. I'll get you a cloth.” He moved to the bathroom again and returned with a cold wet cloth. He charmed it to stay that way. After Draco had downed all the potions and lay back down with the cloth on his forehead, Harry sat on the edge of the bed running his hands through the blond hair in a soothing manner.
“Draco.” Harry ground out. Draco stopped moving. “Tell me, or you're going to be sore from sitting like this.”
“So then I just left. I wasn’t- am not in the mood, to deal with him and his weird arse emotions anymore. He’s so unstable. I swear, any moment he can’t see me or I’m not in the same room as him, he goes insane.”
“I was lonely last night, after you came here to sleep. I missed having you beside me.” Harry replied.
Harry’s eyebrows drew together in a millisecond. “Wait, what did I do?”
Harry and Ron looked at each other.
“Hello, gorgeous.” Harry’s voice sounded, before Draco felt a kiss pressed to his temple.
Harry was skinny dipping...
“Promises, promises.” Draco said, starting down the hall once more.
“No! Let me go! Harry, come back!” Malfoy screamed, as Harry ran up to his dorm. He could hear the blond screaming down in the common room, but didn’t care. Hermione began talking to him in hushed tones.
“Oh, I can’t wait to hear all about it!” Hermione shrieked.
“We haven’t even had sex, though.”
“No.”
They went off to play, and Hermione made her way out of the portrait and to the boy’s bathroom in search of the Slytherin, not before muttering something similar to “boys,” with an added eye roll.
To feel the earth against my feet
“But you love it.” Draco said dramatically.
“Harry!” A body with a head of bushy hair flew into his arms and wrapped him in a bone crushing hug as soon as they stepped in.
Draco leaned his head on Harry’s shoulder and huffed happily.
“N-no I want to. Trust me. I’m just… nervous.”
“Your place on the first date? Ballsy.” he muttered quietly.
“How about *kiss* you go downstairs *kiss* and make us *kiss* some hot cocoa *kiss* and we’ll watch *kiss* whatever you want.” *kiiisssssss*
“Oh, dear Merlin!” Draco screamed. “What did you do!” He grabbed his dick in an attempt to stave off his orgasm.
Draco bit his lip in an attempt to stop from laughing. “You want to put your cock up my arse, don’t you?” He whispered.
Draco nodded.
Draco gasped, trying to draw a single breath in.
“Wait. He had a seizure?” Hermione and Ron said together, both shocked. “You never said…” Hermione says.
He leaned over and kissed Harry quickly before looking at the clock on his nightstand. The red numbers shone ‘2:43 am’. He sighed and hauled himself out of bed before padding off to the bathroom.
"I'm positive. I smelt him. I had to block him out, it was so distracting." Harry said, rubbing his hands down his face. "You guys should've been there..." a happy-dazed expression passed over his face.
Snape stuttered and sputtered before gritting out “Seeing as you are ‘feeling better’, I shall be going. And I will be contacting your father.” He said in a menacing way that meant trouble.
“Us? What about us? Draco, seriously-”
He stayed silent, not really knowing how to respond, so Hermione continued. “You need to trust him, Harry. I know it’s hard with your past and all, but believe me when I say I know you can do this. You can leave all that behind and get to know the man. You need to give him a chance. Ask yourself when the last time was that you did that. I’ll tell you: never. You’ve never given this boy a second chance. If not for him or for anyone else, do yourself a favour and do that. Give him a chance, because I can see he’s trying. Even Ron can. What do you say?”
And his scent, oh his scent that Harry practically thirsted for.
“Not that we’re aware of.” Hermione says. “I feel like he would’ve told us. Or he would’ve experienced one with us. We were together all the time at school.”
“You ok?”
Harry smiled and refrained from mentioning that that was the most the blond had spoken all day. "Still have that 'horrid house-elf', actually." He continued down the hall into the kitchen. "Here, is the kitchen. You should probably know that Kreacher doesn't cook much, but he will clean up afterwards. He's never had a knack for cooking and I couldn't agree with that more." Harry chuckled slightly. He looked to see the blonds lips pursed and looking around curiously. "I normally cook for myself, but I also order in sometimes. I like cooking but we can alternate days or something if you like too, as well. I don't mind. Unless you don't want to cook at all, that's ok too." He rambled.
“You think?”
“Well, seeing as his mind was compromised, it seems that he had no control over what he was doing. Based on my professional estimate, it seems that Mr Malfoy has become attached to you in some way, prior to the confrontation. The spell damage just happened to unlock his attachment in a way, allowing himself to disregard all usual restraint he might’ve had before the incident.”
“You know, I don’t need to deal with this. I’m tired of your attitude.” Harry said. He walked past Draco and up the stairs, heading to the bathroom to take a long hot bath.
That didn’t stop Draco though. He rolled right on top of Harry and started grinding down hard, over and over and over.
“Let go of me you great oaf, or I won’t tell you.”
Harry shrugged. “He’s gonna take care of it. Also, there’s a Mungo's charity thing tomorrow if you wanna go.”
“Right on then, mate. How’ve you been since being back at home?”
“Mr Malfoy, if you don’t mind me asking, do you not feel any negative effects from the magic of the prophecy?” Walkins asked.
“Why don’t make me, Dray.” Harry teased right back, escaping from his husband's grasp and running up the stairs, shrieking as his husband chased him back to bed.
Harry silently chuckled to himself before interrupting Dracos small rant, asking “Need some help with that?”
Harry grabbed Draco’s hair and pulled it to one side, exposing his long neck for him. Draco immediately knew that Harry had switched back on his scenting and was about to get the biggest whiff of Draco yet.
Oh, hello. I’m back. Here is the first chapter to the new fic of my continued series. Please read pt 1 if you haven’t already, it’ll make a lot more sense :)
“Try me.” He says, smirking.
I stand and make my way over to him. He pulls his face a little out of my grip at first, then settles and lets me guide him up to kiss me. It’s only a minute of battling tongues and biting lips before he pulls me onto his lap and around his waist.
And waited.
When Draco fell silent, Harry’s brain stopped processing his rambling and began coming up with reasons as to why that was happening.
He didn’t get up to answer the door. Harry walked in anyways.
(See the end of the chapter for
Clearly Harry just wants to fool around with you without any serious commitment, his mind supplied.
Naturally though, Dumbledore caught on.
“Draco.” Ron said, reaching his hand out to shake Draco’s. “How’ve you been?” He asked politely.
“You’re so good Draco, so beautiful. I want you so bad.” Harry said, going for his neck one more time.
“Socialization?” Draco spat. “You call shared work spaces and forced communication with daft employees ‘socialization’? I ought to wring your neck, you have no idea! Malfoys don’t interact with such vermin of the employed ‘middle class.’”
Harry caught the disappointment that flitted momentarily across Draco’s face that was soon replaced with a smile. “Oh good. You should go. You haven’t seen him in a while.”
“WHAT?!” Draco shouted, pulling back to see Harry smiling. “Are you kidding me right now?” Harry shook his head. “Weasley said you were talking to Kingsley about a promotion, but I didn’t know it was this fucking big?!”
“I guess, but you guys live off of tormenting each other.” Ron added.
Totally ignoring the remote, he grasped Harry’s face lightly, kissing him gently but full of passion. Harry fell right into the kiss, his cocoa and Netflix forgotten. As he felt his mug hand slipping, he momentarily pulled away to set both the remote and mug down, turning back to the blond, and kissing him fiercely. Clashing of lips, tongues and hands, the boys seemingly fought for everything through these kisses.
Ron's jaw dropped and Hermione just stared blankly back at him. Eventually she said "Oh...well then. I can't say I was expecting that..." she replied, nudging Ron's side before his mouth snapped shut.
A furious looking Snape and adverse looking McGonagall stood in the portrait hole, scanning the room for Harry.
When he was returning to his seat, he looked up and the little hint of brunette hair had disappeared from the top of the front seat. When he went to investigate, he found Harry slouched down, breathing deeply and sleeping soundly. His heart twinged again. He returned to his seat and remained there for the rest of the flight.
“Fine, any intimate activities.”
He slammed the door behind him.
Surround me
“I had to pee.” He said lazily.
Merlin, it's not like Harry left him for good! Why was he acting like this? He tried internally scolding himself for acting that way, but that didn’t seem to work either. Instead, he focused all his energy to forcing the tears back, wondering what Harry would think if he found him like that.
“Can you knock it off?” Harry gritted.
Harry had just stepped out of the shower and was towelling his hair when he heard Draco on the other side knocking on the door.
He couldn’t focus on his feelings correctly, still in shock and uncomfortable from the air that surrounded him, so he made his way to bathe the day away, drink a steaming cup of tea and go to sleep in order to prepare for work the next day.
Let me know if you want to see more stuff like this, less sexual or more. This is my first time writing smut sooooooo. I don’t know what the next chapter is going to be, but I love getting suggestions and requests :)
“Draco, can I steal Harry for a moment? I want to show him a new project I’ve been working on.” Ron asked.
“Breathe through it, I got you.” Harry said in a calming tone.
“Yes, and no. I’m sad because everything was so perfect back there, but I’m excited to start my life with you” He kissed Harry’s nose.
The two of them walked into another room, leaving Draco and Hermione together.
“He’s Harry Potter; he doesn’t need luck.” Draco whispers as he approaches the side of the bed. He sits gingerly on the edge, taking Harry's hand in his own. The blue stands of the orb glow for a moment, then return to the faint glow they were before.
“I don’t know, you fuckwad!” Draco shouted, turning to look at Harry, now mad that he was pinned down, and in an emotionally vulnerable state while Harry just dragged this on without giving him a solid answer.
Harry regaled the whole story of what just happened in the bathroom to his best friends. They were both shocked when Harry told them about how Malfoy acted when he was struck with the sectumsempra.
They sat there smiling at each other for a few moments before Draco asked “What're you thinking?”
“Be that as it may, he cannot stay in the hospital wing forever. You are more knowledgeable about wizard care than any other student that may be willing to care for him, and seeing as it is a punishment for you, to make sure you won’t do it again, I think you should be on your way.” McGonagall said sternly. She was not in the mood to negotiate.
Draco smiled at the thought, then frowned at the thought that that’s not what Harry would want. The way he was acting seemed like he wouldn’t want anyone to know about them, ever. Was Harry embarrassed to be with Draco?
“Harry.” Draco said, loud and clear for everyone around that was watching, to hear him. Harry stiffened but didn’t move otherwise. “Let him go.”
“Yes, Potter. I want to start off by saying that your outburst earlier was not appropriate.”
“Oh, so you lecture me about not wearing one, and now you’re doing the same? How does that work?”
After a few seconds, the thought of what was happening penetrated Harry’s mind and he finally pushed the blond away, causing him to land hard on the floor.
But they continued to kiss now. They pushed and pulled, and made out with each other like neither of them had done with anyone else before.
“What? No-”
“Show me what?”
“I said get out!” Snape bellowed.
“Yes, well you’re to deliver memos and letters to those along a specific route depending on which part of the ministry you’re positioned in. Unless you’re put on sorting, then you’d sort the mail into which route it goes.” She smiled. Draco was starting to wonder how many of those she has to fake in a day.
Draco couldn’t help but agree. That did sound like a good enough reason.
“I-I’m so sorry, so sorry. I didn’t mean that. I shouldn’t have- I’m sorry. I don’t want to die. I don’t.” Draco continued to sob as he apologized for what he had said.
Finally Potter had shut up and allowed Draco to absorb the information of the whole story. He started to feel bad about going off on him like that, but he stood by what he said. He chewed his lip and regarded the man opposite him for a moment. Draco couldn’t just give up Potter now knowing that he, technically, didn’t have control over himself that night.
I'm thinking one or two more chapters? Comment any good ideas you might have for this fic, I could use the help! Thank you guys so much for reading, I hope you enjoyed it :)
“I told you, I’ve never done this before.” He smirked.
But Harry never promised those words back. He didn’t because he knew it would be a lie. Draco never had anyone stick with him through tough times in his life, minus his parents, but even they weren’t here to help him with this. Draco felt his heart break more than it already had, because he no one helped him put it back together and he didn’t know how to do it himself. He was crumbling and there was no one to help save him. He questioned, not for the first time, if there ever would be someone.
“Wouldn’t you like that.” Draco said with a smirk.
He regarded her. She may seem toxic, but she’s his best friend. She would never do anything to purposefully hurt him. Well, at least she wouldn’t do anything she couldn’t reverse the damage of. “You wouldn’t. You know who works there.”
Harry and Malfoy stayed at the back of the classroom, lest he get fussy and start causing a ruckus, getting them more in trouble than Harry felt them already in. All other students, which weren’t many, were near the front of the classroom. Harry had taken this class strictly because he needed it if he were to become a healer. He presumed, based on the few other students who had taken the class as well, were in the same boat as him. The student demographic looked to be mostly made up of Ravenclaws and Slytherins.
Draco looked back at him and smiled.
Harry ignored his question, looked down and ran a hand through his hair in a calming manner. "There's something else..." Of course, being Harry's best friends, both Hermione and Ron knew about the wolf characteristics passed down through Harry's lineage. They were there when he manifested into an Alpha fourth year. Confusion etched its way into Hermione and Ron's faces. Harry looked up to see their expressions as he explained what he discovered. "Draco's an Omega."
But then Draco was cut off. By Potter. Actually, by Potters lips on his lips. What?!
“Right. Well, this is wonderful." Harry said, scooping himself a large helping. He poured a cup of tea that was already made and sat down across from Draco. "So, what's new?" Harry asked before shoving a forkful of eggs into his mouth.
Lemon in the purest form. You’re welcome :)
“She’s at home.” Ron said.
Harry quickly turned to his friends and they shared a group hug before he waved them off, and disappeared behind the courtroom's giant marble doors.
“Fuck, Dray, that was amazing.” Harry croaked.
“Dray?” Harry. Who else would it be?
“Oh, Harry. Are you alright? What happened? You really scared us.” She said, placing the cup in his hand and wiped his face clean of tears and sweat.
Because then Draco came out with just a towel wrapped around his waist, his hair dripping wet and skin shining with dew.
“Haha, funny.” He said as he watched Draco giggle himself into a ball on the bed. He crawled over top of him as he calmed down. “I don’t know why now, or why at all, or how… but I love you, and I can’t wait to spend forever with you.” Harry said to him.
“It seems that your presence helps him.” The medit-witch says. “Keep in contact with him. He might just recover quicker.” She says, then leaves the four of them alone.
“Are you ready?” Hermione asked with a sad sort of smile as she fixed Harry’s tie.
Draco went and sat on the beach to watch the sunset. It helped get his mind off of the sad realization that him and Harry probably never would get over their differences.
The blond didn’t even have a chance to turn around. He was hit with the unknown spell, the one Harry had tried uncovering for months prior to, ever since he got a hold of the potions textbook. He didn’t know what the spell did, but he was dying to find out- and what better subject to test it on than his rival?
Harry stood and walked over to a large and beautifully carved hutch in the corner of the room. He opened a drawer and shuffled around a little inside before pulling something out and sitting back down in front of Draco. “I forgot to give this to you earlier. I remembered I had it at your trial but forgot to return it.” He said, handing over Draco's old Hawthorn wand.
Harry sighed and closed his eyes. He was clearly mentally debating whether or not to tell Draco, but Draco just continued to stare at him. He finally gave in. “It’s to help me sleep.” He murmured, but Draco heard him cause he strained his ears too.
“You...like this.” Malfoy said, stripping Harry of his towel. He had already discarded his onto the hooks beside the shower.
“I understand.” He said for the third time that day.
Harry glared at him. “That’s my family that you’re dragging me away from. So yeah. I’m going to take my bloody time saying goodbye to them, you arse.”
One...flying
“Ah, yes, I suppose that’s correct… Draco Malfoy, gay Slytherin.” Draco said with a slight frown.
“What?!” Harry exclaimed. Being given detention and 50 points taken away, he really didn’t think it fair that he must suffer a groping Malfoy for who-knows how long.
He threw his head up and stared at Draco with furrowed brows and a frown on his face. He looked constipated.
“Figured out the cupboard, did ya? Names Jonathan.” He stuck his hand out for a shake. Draco eyed it before grasping it.
"Are you alright?" Harry asked. The blonde looked at him confused, allowing Harry to elaborate. "You seem sad."
“Tea?” She asked.
“It was in the heat of the moment.” A pause. He thought for a moment. “Don’t tell me you did that because you felt sorry for me.”
She cast a patronus for Madame Pomfrey in the hospital wing, saying that she needed assistance and where, but not disclosing any other information, before sending it off. She stayed with Malfoy until help arrived a few minutes later, in which Madame Pomfrey brought Professor McGonagall with her.
Draco was on the verge of orgasm, so he rolled up his hips, having Harry slip in even deeper. He reached down and stroked his cock as he rolled up at every thrust of Harry’s, his arse meeting Harry’s hips half way, the slapping of skin, quiet moans, and heavy breathing filling the empty conference room.
Draco didn’t have the chance to stand up and punch the guy off of himself, before he was pushed aside and the creep was thrown off of him. He whipped around to see the man pinned to the wall, Harry’s hand wrapped around his neck.
When he opened them again, he was surprised to see Harry’s eyes watering.
“Wanna play wizard’s chess?” Ron asked.
“Uh me?! Look what you did?” Harry said, pointing to his face covered in the brown goo.
I card my fingers through his hair as he breathes wetly on my skin.
“Let’s get dressed, yeah?” Harry quickly turned the shower off and donned a big fluffy towel, passing one to Malfoy as well.
Harry later found Draco in the library, curled up on the sofa, reading what looked to be a potions notebook. He approached the blond from behind where he sat, rubbing his burly hands along his sharp shoulders.
I’ve done so many, many times. At first I tried listing reasons to him as to why we didn’t belong together. Then I left without saying anything. Then I graduated to just saying “this has been fun, but it’s not right.” It hurts less, trying to find ways to leave him, since we always come back to each other. He’s used to it now. Doesn’t hurt him any less though.
It was a day like no other. He got up, got ready, went to work, and brought out the internal beauty that he knew all his clients had, by fixing up their hair.
Harry rolled his eyes and continued on to the bathroom.
Snape eyed him skeptically. He gently released his godson, who immediately fell to the ground, scrambled up, and reattached himself to Harry. He whimpered and nuzzled Harry, who awkwardly patted his back. Snape fixed his sleeves and strode passed Harry, then suddenly stopped and turned back to the two boys. “I want to see you after class Potter. We need to discuss... this matter.” Then he strode into his classroom, not bothering to wait for them.
