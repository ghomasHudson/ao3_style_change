“If that’s true, Harry, then I’m sure you’ll be back in your own timeline soon. These spells never last very long. Probably just until you fall asleep.”

Wait. What was that? The tube stilled as it pulled into the next station, admitting another mob of miserable London commuters into the already suffocatingly full carriage. But there had been a face... Draco frantically scanned the passengers making their way off the platform for whoever had caught his eye. There!
Malfoy nodded.  “I’ve been living in France with mother.  Britain wasn’t exactly welcoming to us after the war so moving away seemed like the best option.”
Feeling like he had to respond but not trusting his voice, Harry shook his head.
“Your present is no less full of sadness. Once the apple of the public’s eye, you have retreated to a house of dark and decay, pushing away all but your closest friends. You convince yourself that no one will ever love you for who you are, rather than who they believe you to be, so you lock your heart away.”
A young lad, not long out of training by the look of it, answered. “He got hit by something but none of us heard what it was. Knocked him straight out
Hermione’s face lit up and Harry could sense an interrogation coming on when a red envelope bumped into his nose.  Shit.  The shared chemistry results.  He braced himself for disappointment as his shaking hands peeled back the paper to reveal a single number:
Poor or rich, lowly or grand.”
“Wh- what does it do?” Harry gulped, the way Malfoy’s were raking up and down his body making him feel naked.
For everything has chance to alter,

“I- I was in it,” he stammered, causing Maddie to look up from her notes.
“You could have really hurt someone, Harry,” Hermione lectured later that evening in the common room.  “What if we had been brewing something more volatile?  You could have covered the whole class with it.”
sheepishly.
Harry stuffed the green and silver striped scarf into his bag as he ran down the staircase and out of the Gryffindor common room.  It had taken him twice as long as usual to get ready this morning; by the time he had emptied his trunk, realised he had nothing to wear, called Hermione in to help and finally settled on his least ripped pair of jeans and a fairly crease free red shirt, he barely had time to guzzle down a healthy breakfast of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans before he had to bolt down to meet Draco in the entrance hall.
“Draco,” Pansy whined, her best puppy dog eyes in place.  “We’ve been waiting here for ages.  Can’t we get some food and try again later?”
Maddie slumped down in the chair next to him and took a bite out of a half melted chocolate frog as she reached out for the pile of paperwork from their
“Good,” Malfoy smiled.  “I’ll meet you at the bar.”
As they compared dates from hell, Harry realised that they were actually having a civil conversation.  More than civil, even.  In fact, Harry found that he was enjoying Malfoy’s company so much that when the horn sounded to signify that five minutes was up he jumped an inch off his seat, banging his knee painfully against the table leg in the process.

“It’s likely that Potter’s memories will return to him in time as his body recovers from the attack, but I think that until then it would be best to limit
He took a seat at the Gryffindor table after many more prods from Hermione and glanced surreptitiously over to the Slytherin table, both relieved and terrified to see that Draco was still eating breakfast.  The blond, as if feeling Harry’s eyes on him, glanced up curiously.  His lips twitched in a small smile and Harry smiled back shakily, fighting against the nausea that was threatening to overwhelm him.  Draco tilted his head in the direction of the entrance hall and stood up confidently from the bench, leaving Harry to scramble up and follow him, ignoring Hermione’s whisper of “Good luck, Harry” as he left the hall.
Harry nodded back at him enthusiastically and smiled. “Draco,” he said, reaching out and clasping Draco’s hand as he moved to draw his wand. “I just wanted
“I think we need a new plan,” she replied.  “I mean, insults were all good and well when we were eleven but if you really want Potter we’re going to have to try something else.”
Pansy’s lips twitched.  He’d been practicing that one in the common room all morning.
“If you’ll allow me to speak, I’ll answer your questions,” Draco frowned reproachfully at the Aurors, who fell into silence. “At the moment we’re not

,” he finished, dropping his arm to his side.
Excuses flew around in his head – the whole common room had imagined it, it was a trick of the light, it was a joke, or that a beautiful blond had given it to him and that since then Harry’s heart had yet to return to its normal pace.  There was nothing for it.  He was going to have to tell them.
His bedroom at Avebury Academy was gaudy in a way most people would have found impressive, but which made Draco’s skin crawl. With its wood-panelled walls, four poster bed, and opulence dripping from every nook and cranny, it represented all the tradition and heritage he wanted to escape.
family rivalries run deep, after all, but he soon thawed to Draco when they met at a Chudley Cannons vs. Kenmare Kestrels game and found that they both
Over the next days and weeks Harry found himself falling more and more for Draco Malfoy.  With the end of Draco’s self-imposed silence, their lunch-time conversations were now much less one-sided - although Draco still seemed happy to let Harry ramble on as he listened with an amused smile - and Harry began to think that perhaps his feelings for the blond were also less one-sided than he’d originally thought.  More than once he had felt eyes on him and looked up to see Draco regarding him fondly.  Harry was sure that just yesterday, while he was indulging in a particularly well-earned stretch, he had caught Draco staring at him, admiration clear on his face, before the blond had blushed and looked away.  Yes, Harry thought, Draco was interested.  Now he just had to make his move, but how?

lucky son of a bitch.”
The blond eyed the box mistrustfully and reluctantly held out his hand.  “Fine.  But if it’s horrible then you have to buy me a butterbeer.”
“Here you are, Harry,” Ron said handing him a deep red cocktail topped with a cherry.  “No idea what’s in it but I thought you could do with a bit of liquid courage.”
As Draco packed up his bag for the day and went to meet Pansy for breakfast, the last traces of pen on paper trickled away; the words “
“Ron,” Harry croaked.  “Just drop it.”  He needed a pain potion and he needed one now.  “And get my broom would you?”
Maddie leaned in. “You haven’t been to see him all morning. You’re not avoiding him are you?” she asked. “You seemed so fond of him yesterday.”

Draco sighed. Just another way he was going to let his parents down. He thought they might get over him not wanting to follow in his father’s footsteps, and
Harry’s face split into a wide grin. “And they’re coming in to see me?” At the Healer’s nod he bounced lit up in excitement and Draco felt a stab of
Harry trailed off as he realised that he had been talking at Malfoy without pause for minutes now.  He risked a glance up at the man, who stood rigid and was staring at Harry with a look of utter bafflement.
“Hm,” Draco said, reaching out to take the scarf.  “Maybe you should keep it.  The colour suits you,” he observed as he moved in close and carefully wound the wool once around Harry’s neck.
Harry glanced suspiciously at Malfoy as he entered the dim Potions classroom later that afternoon.  He hadn’t heard a peep from the Slytherin since breakfast and had taken to checking behind suits of armour as he made his way around the castle, just in case, but Malfoy looked uncharacteristically subdued as he took his normal seat next to Parkinson.
Harry smirked. “It was pretty good.”
Draco snorted.  “Pft, only if he manages to stay on his broom long enough.”
“And remembered how to style your own hair, apparently.”
“Thanks,” she muttered in embarrassment. “It ripped as I was packing away. I don’t know what to do. I haven’t got a change of clothes and I can’t go out there looking like this.”
/H/D/H/D/
Harry speared his fork into a nearby piece of bacon, his good mood from this morning had vanished in an instant.
“I’ve, err, never done this before.  I’m not really sure how it goes,” Harry confessed.
Harry huffed. “Well everyone knows that.”
“Yes!” Malfoy cheered. “Then we’re having Indian. It’s been ages since I’ve had a good vindaloo.”
Upon seeing the Slytherin, Ron came to a halt, the gears visibly working in his head as his urge to insult Draco fought with his loyalty to Harry.  Eventually, he settled on glaring at the Slytherin until Hermione grabbed his arm and pulled him through the open doors of the Great Hall.  Draco sneered at the retreating redhead and, as Harry rolled his eyes, shrugged as if to say, well, he started it.
“Er, yeah.  So, I’ve been a bit confused,” he explained haltingly, fingers nervously tangling in the soft tassels of the scarf.  “But this evening Draco found me outside and we went for a walk.  It was...” Harry searched for a word to describe the experience – he doubted ‘perfect’ or ‘spine-tingling’ would be very well received by Ron, “… it was nice,” he finished lamely.
“Sure,” Harry said, smiling, as he opened the door fully for Draco.

like it would somehow make it all real – and plunged. “I think I’m in love with him.”
“That’s brilliant, Harry,” Draco said smiling – the Gryffindor’s excitement was contagious. “Anyway, I just wanted to say goodbye before I left.” Harry
“Brilliant!”
He looked out towards the direction Hermione, Ron and Draco had headed in, hoping that he’d be able to find them in the bustling crowd. A sharp crinkling in his hand, however, made him pause. Harry glanced down and opened his fist to reveal the photo they had taken earlier in the evening. So this was what had made Draco so embarrassed. He took a closer look and smiled, watching as the photo looped again and again: Hermione and Ron giggling together, himself grimacing and squashed awkwardly into the corner and Draco, who could never seem to take his eyes off of Harry. A warm feeling erupted in his chest and he strode out into the fair, more determined than ever.
Draco’s eyes shot open. “Wait,” he said, his voice nearly a whisper.
Draco couldn’t keep the stupid smile off his face as he left Harry’s room and returned to his spot behind the reception desk and could only manage a weak
This was exactly what he had been worried about ever since Hermione had come back from her first day at the Department of Mysteries. She’d been raving about how amazing Malfoy was, how smart and talented, and how much he’d changed since school. Bullshit. Then they’d started hanging out after work, going to the pub together, and soon Ron had been dragged in too. He started saying things like “he’s not so bad, I guess” and “Harry, you’ll never guess what Draco said last night”. Traitor. Harry was the only one who could see through Malfoy’s little game. Well, he hadn’t figured out what exactly the game was yet but he was sure that Malfoy was plotting something.
From then on, Harry joined Malfoy in the Great Hall every day for lunch.  Their conversations were mostly one-sided and usually consisted of Harry rambling about whatever was on his mind, with the occasional smirk or raised eyebrow from Malfoy.  It was one afternoon when Harry was once again ranting about joining the Aurors that Malfoy eventually spoke up.
“Hey, it’s alright,” Draco said calmly as he removed his jacket and passed it to Cho. She wrapped it around her waist gratefully.
“And you’re sure that you remember everything? You have all of your memories back? About me? And the war?”

vice-like grip on Harry’s shirt and sat back. “You have no idea who we are, do you?”
“Great.  How about we do it together?  I could meet you in the library?” Draco proposed.
Harry looked at the setup with trepidation.  He understood the basics of speed dating, sure – you chat with someone for a few minutes, see if you hit it off and then move on to the next person – but this was wizard speed dating.  He gulped nervously, relieved when a familiar freckled face appeared next to him.
“I’m just going out into the corridor for a second. I’ll only be a minute or two, okay?” Draco replied in a soothing tone.
“Because I called dibs,” she explained, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. “But seriously, you do need to calm down.” She came to stand in
---- END ----
“As far as I can tell he has retrograde amnesia,” Draco explained quickly, reluctant to leave Potter alone for any longer than absolutely necessary. “There
very keen to ignore.
He nearly stumbled over his own feet in the hurry to get to the safety of the bathroom and slammed the door behind him in relief.  His pyjamas were soaked through with sweat so Harry discarded them on the floor, confident that the house elves would have them clean and returned to him in no time, and stepped into the shower.  As water cascaded down his back, he leaned his head against the hard tiles and tried to calm down his breathing, urging away the glimpses flying through his head and the hardness in his crotch.
explaining as Harry nodded along, smiling.
“Ah, I can sympathise with you there.  Pansy and Blaise dragged me along,” Malfoy indicated to the bar where Harry could just discern the two Slytherins.  “I’m back home barely long enough to unpack and apparently it’s already time for me to “settle down”,” he said with a scoff.
“Saturday?” Draco’s forehead crinkled in confusion.
“What?” Ron asked.  “You were actually wearing a Slytherin scarf?  Why, Harry?”

The image of a shocked Great Hall as their fisticuffs turned to something else flashed through his head and Harry couldn’t help the laugh that escaped him.  “Ron would’ve had a heart attack.  It’d almost serve him right, the amount of awful dates he’s set me up on.  One guy actually asked for a lock of my hair,” he grimaced.

Confused, Harry prised open his heavy eyelids and jolted as the remnants of sleep left him in a startling whoosh. This was definitely his room, but not as he remembered it. Rather than the dark, peeling wallpaper that he was used to, the walls were painted a bright, periwinkle blue that seem to gleam in the morning sun. Rather than the threadbare, dusty carpet, his feet met the smooth hardness of wooden floorboards. In the corner of the room - the room he was sure he had left in a state the previous night - piled high with dirty clothes, stood a stunning armoire that wouldn’t have looked out of place in a country mansion.
Malfoy stepped forward to greet them, kissing Hermione on one cheek and shaking hands with Ron. Noticing Harry, his smile faded a little and he took a deep breath.

live on Bertie Bott’s Every Flavoured Beans alone – and Draco had taken to humming to himself to stave off the quiet.
“Malfoy?” she exclaimed, clearly shocked, and Draco heard Weasley behind her yell, “Malfoy?! What the fuck does he want?”
A knock at the door interrupted and Maddie poked her head into the room.
the incredible friction shooting through his entire body.
Form-fitting grey trousers hugged his slender legs and a deep blue jumper that looked so soft it had probably cost more than Harry’s entire wardrobe curved around his shoulders.  Draco laughed and Harry realised with a jolt that he had been caught staring.
Harry released Draco from his mouth with a pop. “Turn over.”
“Don’t worry,” Draco waved him off with a smirk, “I’ll go easy on you.”
“Potter! You’re awake! How do you feel?”
away from you – even he didn’t deserve that. Karma really was a bitch.
“I know, Hermione. But I’ve got a feeling about this,” he explained, surer than ever that this was something that he needed to do. “I’ll come find you guys when I’m done.”
“That’s it!” Harry shouted, making Hermione jump. “The fortune teller! She told me my future and said that maybe I just needed a push in the right direction. She said that to help me she’d show me a glimpse of my future…”

Harry joined in, rather weakly, and wondered why the thought of Malfoy holding his hand made his stomach break out into butterflies.
“What?!” Ron bellowed at the same moment Hermione sighed, “Ahh.”
“So,” Maddie interrupted loudly, catching Draco’s eye and sending him a small, reassuring smile, “is anyone hungry? I’m absolutely famished. I reckon there

Harry frowned. What had Cho been wearing tonight? He couldn’t remember. Harry considered asking his friends what they were talking about but held his tongue. The last time he had questioned one of their jokes he had received some very strange looks indeed.

just woken up not knowing who the hell he was to cry on his own. Even if that man was Harry Potter.
Draco caught his breath. “Door on the left.”
“But- Harry?” Ron turned to him in desperation, his eyes pleading with Harry to tell him that it was all nonsense.  Harry shrugged his shoulders in apology and pulled the green and silver scarf out from under his pillow.
Harry smiled awkwardly. Even after all these years, he still wasn’t quite comfortable with posing for magical photos. I mean, it’s just going to be a 5 second loop of me looking like an idiot, he thought.
“Do I- do I know you?” Draco asked, wincing at how croaky his voice sounded.

Realising that Malfoy was probably in a state of mild shock and likely hadn’t heard a word of Harry’s tirade he mumbled a quick “Bye” at the blond and walked away.

“Well,” Harry said, “he didn’t exactly grab it.  But I know he did it on purpose to shake me up.”
“Yeah?” Harry asked as he finally grasped what Draco was saying, a smile emerging and threatening to take over his whole face when Draco nodded in reply.
“Do you have a preference for which university?” he asked. “Oxford and Cambridge, of course. But Kings College London and University College London are also very respectful establishments.”
Draco blearily opened his eyes. He cancelled the alarm spell, checked the time – four pm – and, throwing his wand down on the bed, rubbed his hands over
He looked up at her with bloodshot eyes and shook his head. “No.”
Harry jolted into consciousness, springing upright in his bed as memories of the previous day spun around in his head. He took in the thin curtains, worn bedsheets and scuffed carpet and slumped in a mixture of relief and disappointment. A part of him, the part that hadn’t been confused and panicked and lost, had actually enjoyed being Draco for the day.
The cheeky smile dropped immediately from Harry’s face and a nervous frown crinkled his forehead. “Who are they? My emergency contacts.”
“Ron and Hermione know I’m here with you and I really don’t care what anyone else thinks.  I like you,” Harry confessed.
Harry shook his head, laughing. “I guess not. You must have been a little shit though; if you were this nice in school I can’t imagine why we wouldn’t have
I just need a distraction is all.
A chuckle reverberated in his ear, the warm breath against the back of his neck making his skin tingle, and Harry jumped as he realised that, in his effort to avoid the sugar-crazed Hufflepuff, he had pressed himself entirely against Draco.
“I can see you worrying,” Harry said, blinking up at Draco.  “Stop it.  I already said I wanted you to hold my hand, didn’t I.”

Entering Harry’s room, he took in the scene before him with relief. A small part of him had been worried that Weasley and Granger would accidentally let
until Draco couldn’t stand it anymore.
Just when Harry thought that this couldn’t get any better, Malfoy released him, repositioned himself and reached down to grab both of them together. Harry’s eyes rolled back and he braced himself against the wall, legs weak with spine-tingling pleasure. Malfoy’s hand was slick and moved with ease, generating delicious friction between them until Harry could take it no longer. He groaned as he came hard, riding out the waves under Malfoy’s relentless pace, until Malfoy himself shook and threw his head back with a moan.
A breathy laugh interrupted his fantasy. Draco blushed bright scarlet, realising that he’d been caught ogling Harry Potter by none other than Harry Potter

“Well we met Draco there – you were really unhappy about that,” she said with a smile. “If I recall you and Ron ate an excessive amount of treacle tart, we went on a few rides, I think you went to see a fortune teller but you wouldn’t tell anyone what she’d said-“
Goosebumps sprung up all over Harry as the soft material settled onto his skin.  He bit his lip nervously as he looked at Draco, the soft smirk on the Slytherin’s face all the warning he received before a warm mouth was gently pressed against his.  Through the sound of his heart pounding in his ears, one thought echoed around in Harry’s head – I’m gay, I’m so gay, totally 100% gay, well, for Draco at least – before soft hands reached up to cup his face and his brain shut off completely.
window. Draco groaned and rubbed his hands over his face.

And so for once, Draco let himself be brave.  He reached out a tentative, shaking hand and stroked his fingers along Harry’s forehead, running them soothingly through the mess of black hair as Harry sighed contentedly and closed his eyes.  Draco smiled at the man next to him and Harry, opening his eyes, met Draco’s smile with a brilliant one of his own.
As he approached the crowd, a few volunteers shouted out his name in greeting.  Malfoy, startled out of his introspection, flicked his eyes up to meet Harry’s and, before he could return his gaze to a blank examination of the floor, Harry nodded his head at the man.  A puzzled look passed briefly over Malfoy’s face before he hesitantly nodded back.  Harry smiled inwardly as he joined the rest of the volunteers.  Baby steps, after all, were what were needed here if he wanted his plan to work.
Oh shit, Harry thought as he scrambled around for an explanation.  “Err…”
The girl smiled in response. Relieved, Draco slid into an empty chair and picked up a piece of toast. As he looked around for the marmalade, Hermione passed him a large white jar. Draco looked at it sceptically. Fluff? What the hell was Fluff? He glanced up at Hermione questioningly but she had turned back to her book, so Draco unscrewed the lid and took a cursory sniff. Urgh! He knew Pansy had said that Harry had a fondness for sweets, but this was tooth decay in a jar! Draco pushed the jar away with the tip of his finger and settled for simple butter.

Harry stood on Draco’s doorstep, dishevelled and out of breath as if he had ran the entire way here.
“Okay?” Draco asked.
“I’ve got to go,” Draco said, straightening the bag on his shoulder.  “I have Arithmancy first period.  But I’ll see you later?”
“Sorry,” Draco muttered, still half asleep but ever polite – he was his mother’s son, after all. “Can I get you anything to eat?”
“Why don’t you come and sit with us for a bit?” she suggested. “We’re not doing much, just boring patient notes.”

Now that Ron mentioned it, Harry’s throat did feel a bit sore.  In fact, he felt weird all over.  Hot and sweaty and why did his boxers feel so damn tight?!  Oh shit, Harry thought as glimpses of his dream came back to him in a rush of blond hair, warm skin and the scent of grass.  His face flushed red.
Hermione rolled her eyes at him. “Draco Malfoy. You know, tall, blond-“
not to accept even a knut from his mother – but, looking around the small living space now, Draco couldn’t be more proud. The room was decorated in warm
“Do you know who you are?” he asked so quietly that it was nearly a whisper.
Cautiously, Draco stood up to take a better look at his surroundings and jumped in shock when he realised something else. Those were not his legs. Those were not his arms or hands or feet or-
“Oh, look!” Hermione gushed suddenly, pointing at a red and white striped tent. “It’s a photo booth. I used to go to them all the time with Mum and Dad.”
“What’s that you’ve got there?” he asked quickly when Harry shot him a curious look.
Draco smiled at the look of bafflement on Harry’s face as the best friends he didn’t remember introduced themselves and, determined to give the trio some
Harry gulped. What exactly was this? Draco was so easy to talk to and Harry thought about him all the time. They'd talked about everything – his parents, his shitty upbringing, his new life in London. Even things Harry hadn't shared with Ron and Hermione.
without something inside of him falling apart. Hell, he’d barely left the hospital in the past few days. He deserved some time off.
“Oh yes, Draco, I’m sure your intentions were very noble,” Maddie said sardonically. “Now shush so Harry can carry on with the story.”
“Is Harry okay?” “What’s wrong with him?” “Do you know what he was hit with?” “Is he awake yet?”
“I wanted to apologise for what happened this morning.”
“But that’s why I need your help!” Harry beseeched.  “You haven’t seen what Malfoy’s like.  He just seems so… defeated.  I have to do this.  And I can’t do it without the two of you.”
They had parted hands briefly in their haste to leave but now, alone together on the footpath that skirted the lake and led back to the castle, Harry slid his fingers between Draco’s and revelled in the feeling of the strong, warm hand in his own.  As they walked, they talked about everything and anything; how they were finding their NEWTs, what did they think of the new Nimbus 3000 and, currently, what they wanted to do after school.
Harry frowned at him. “Of course I did.”

Draco shot her an affronted look.  She knew that look too well.  It was the look that accompanied his well-practiced speech about haven’t we been friends forever and you know I would do anything for you, Pans that always had her giving in and doing whatever he wanted.  Lucky for her, the Gryffindorks chose that moment to come charging down the staircase like the unruly brutes they were and Pansy stepped back to watch the show as Draco’s gaze locked onto Potter.
Harry nodded and smiled as he continued to flick through the photo album. “I’ll hold you to that.”
moved down, trailing his mouth all over his body, lips kissing across his collarbone, tongue swirling around his nipples, teeth grazing over his hipbones,
“No, it’s ok. I’ll just…”
At the gesture, Harry was transported back to a dark September night over a decade ago. I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself. Malfoy’s fragile smile trembled and Harry wondered if he was reliving the same memory. To hell with it, Harry thought, before gripping Malfoy’s surprisingly warm hand in his own and being rewarded with a grateful look from the blond.
Harry panicked as he realised that he had almost strayed onto the subject of the war and quickly tried to change the subject.

“Whew, I’m starving.  Aren’t you?  I guess shifting rocks around all morning really builds up an appetite.  Ooh, is that treacle tart?  I love treacle tart.  It’s my favourite, you know?  It’s a shame there’s no apple crumble and custard, though,” Harry chattered on in between bites of shepherd’s pie, not pausing to wonder why he knew Malfoy’s favourite dessert.
“Your hospital records show that you’ve listed two people as your emergency contacts should you be admitted here but, because you were brought in so late
Harry smiled but relaxed against Malfoy’s shoulder. He thought about what Hermione had said, about giving Malfoy a chance to convince him that they could be happy together. Exactly when it had shifted Harry had no idea, but there was no doubt left in his mind that he could be happy with this person.
“What the hell are you doing, Malfoy?” Harry demanded, snatching his hand away.
The next few days passed in a blur. Draco practised the spell and wand movements at every chance he got and spent the remainder of his time checking and
The witch’s next words silenced him.
“Er, hello,” Harry replied, keeping his voice quiet in case the person rattling around in his kitchen heard.
When Malfoy pulled away, Harry only just managed to hold in the groan. “I’ve got an idea,” Malfoy said, licking his lips suggestively. “Why don’t we move this to the shower.”
“Goodbye, Harry,” Maddie sing-songed as she left the room. Harry sent her a glancing wave but his eyes lingered on Draco’s as the Healer reluctantly backed

Harry smirked at him. “Yes, well,” Draco said with a dignified sniff. “I was doing it for the sake of the school. Can you image what would have happened if
Malfoy blinked at him, the picture of innocence.  “Why, I’m waiting to collect my potions ingredients, Potter.  Speaking of which, it’s your turn.”  He motioned with his head and Harry realised that he was, indeed, at the front of the queue and was holding everyone up.

he be so nonchalant? Did he not realise that what had happened to them was completely insane?!
Instead of the familiar scowl that Harry had been expecting, Malfoy’s face split into a beaming smile. Harry shivered. It was just because the expression looked so alien on Malfoy’s face, he told himself. Not because of the way the evening sun caught the grey in Malfoy’s eyes, turning them silver, or the way the casual black jeans lengthened his legs and clung in all the right places, or the way the fabric of his shirt rippled as Malfoy waved, exposing a hint of pale collarbone. Harry frowned and shook his head. He would have to tread carefully; this could all be part of Malfoy’s nefarious plan.
“Sorry,” Harry apologised as he tried and failed to keep a straight face.  “But at least you get a free drink out of this.”
Granger and Weasley – that he wasn’t such a waste of space after all. And once Harry was cured, Draco wouldn’t be his Healer anymore. He could take him up
“Draco?” Harry said, raising his head and peering into warm grey eyes. The face that he met was so familiar and yet old memories of scowls and sneers had been replaced by new ones of smiles and laughter and moans of pleasure. “I had a really great day today.”
Harry jolted his head up from where he had been sullenly inspecting the table and green eyes latched onto grey.
“Hey, mate. What took you so long?” The ginger oaf grinned at him. “Did you forget we have our shift in an hour?”
“You don’t have to say anything if you don’t want to,” Hermione reassured as she shifted closer to him and leaned down to meet his eyes, resting a hand on top of his in support.  “But we’re your friends, Harry, and you can tell us anything.”
“So…” Draco said, slowly biting off a chunk of toast, stomach roiling with nerves.
Harry smiled as he remembered the note he had left for Draco. From what he’d seen of Pansy, it wouldn’t surprise him at all if the blond was as just as melodramatic as his friend. It probably wouldn’t happen again, Harry thought. And yet, he wondered if he’d ever see Draco’s reply.
“Potter!” Malfoy shouted behind him in warning, but too late.
-------
“Have you been up long?”
“So, Draco,” Harry smirked wickedly.  “Does this mean you’ll go out with me?”
The feeling of elation lasted until they arrived at a large shopfront - tasteful writing above the double doors marking it as Ristorante Gustami - where Draco was promptly rushed into a uniform and shoved into the seating area. The next few hours passed in a blur. Draco dashed from table to table, taking orders, delivering drinks, serving food and collecting payments before starting the whole exhausting process from the beginning again.
Wishing beyond anything that he could believe that, could believe that Harry might see past the mistakes he had made and see the man he was now, Draco
Maddie cackled and Draco smiled wistfully as he remembered the outrage his eleven year old self had felt that Potter had smuggled a dragon into the castle
As soon as Harry stepped into The Sleeping Dragon he knew he had made a grave mistake.  The owners had obviously gone to the extreme for Valentine’s Day, Harry thought as he eyed the bright pink streamers and bunches of mistletoe hanging from the ceiling.  Hell, there was even a giant teddy bear, complete with the most ridiculous bow tie he had ever seen, sitting by the bar.  Honestly, the place looked as if a unicorn had thrown up on it.
a crush it’s helpful not to stare at the object of your affection as much as you did.”
“Mate,” Ron started one evening, once the trio were comfortable at their regular corner table in the Three Broomsticks.  “Auror Training is absolutely brilliant.  We started on Concealment and Disguise today and the other courses are wicked as well.  You’d love it.  You should really think about taking Kingsley up on that offer.”
“Hey.”
-----fin-----
“Maybe he just likes the reminder of playing Quidditch in school and you happened to be in the shot” she suggested unconvincingly.
“Achilles? What kind of name is that for a snake?” Harry scoffed.
Harry hadn’t seen hair or tail of Malfoy since the trials after the war and if he stared now, well, he was only human after all.  The Slytherin barely resembled the pale, frightened boy he had last seen in the Ministry courtrooms; instead, the man sitting only a few seats away was, for lack of a better word, stunning.  The platinum hair that was once harshly slicked back now hung loose around sharp cheekbones and fell down to brush along the collar of an exquisite grey robe.  Harry would have bet his entire inheritance that it had been made to measure, his eyes clouding over as he imagined running fingers over the soft material and finding out first-hand just how well the blond’s robe fit.
After a few moments, Harry’s breathing had slowed but his erection was still as prominent as ever.  He groaned into the tiles as he realised that it wasn’t going to go away any time soon unless he did something about it.  He debated what was worse, going down to breakfast with a raging erection or wanking in the shower to thoughts of… that, before he slowly reached down to grip himself with one hand.  His eyes drifted shut as he began to move, faster and faster.  He tried desperately to think of something, anything but the flashes of blond hair and pale skin that seemed to be seared into his mind.  Harry’s orgasm crept up on him, the pressure coiling in his crotch peaking in an explosion of white hot pleasure before he had time to muffle his moans into his arm.
would have lasted before he gave in and said
Hermione glanced thoughtfully between Harry’s current position and where Malfoy had just disappeared and shook her head.  “Well, I, for one, am starving,” she said, heading over to the Gryffindor table.
Harry laughed, amazed by how easy it seemed between them.  But he supposed that, if what Hermione said was right, they’d been dancing around each other for a while now.
With a resigned sigh, Draco got changed and went in search of breakfast. He hesitated at the door of the kitchen. The bushy-haired girl was seated at the table once again, trying valiantly - and failing, Draco might add – to avoid getting toast crumbs over the thick tome she was thumbing through. She looked up and spotted him.
Hands still under Draco’s shirt, Harry manoeuvred the both of them across the room - the lips and tongue and teeth trailing down Draco’s neck were making

Draco sighed, lowering his head to the desk with a thunk. He’d have to thank Maddie later; this wasn’t the first time she’d had to diffuse an awkward
Draco laughed. “Thanks, Maddie,” he said, pulling her into a hug.
“Oh thank Merlin,” Granger sighed.  “We were so worried when we heard he was hurt.”
“Oh fuuuuuck,” Draco breathed, burying his face in his arms.

And with a gummy grin and a “Four years or so should do it. Good luck, Harry” she disappeared in a poof of smoke.
Malfoy nodded.  “I’m glad.”
“Yeah,” Harry nodded. “Sounds good to me.”

As Draco waited in front of the hospital Floo he had to urge himself to calm down. Sure, they had hated each other in school and had generally existed to
“Come on, mate,” Ron added, chucking on his coat and winding a bright orange Chudley Cannons scarf around his neck. “He’s actually a pretty decent guy once you get over the creepy tattoo and long history of mutual hatred.” Ron grinned but Harry was in no mood for jokes.
“Great!  If you’ll just fill this out for me then we can get you started,” she said, entirely too cheerful for Harry’s liking, and handed him a form onto which he hastily scribbled down his details.  “Wonderful.  Now here’s your number,” the witch pinned a heart-shaped badge to his shirt, identifying him as #17.  “When we’re ready to begin you just need to take a seat over there,” she pointed to the back of the room where there were ten tables set up, each with a chair at either side, “and I’ll explain how tonight is going to work.”
The home screen gave nothing away – no smiling photo of friends or family to give Draco any hint of who’s body he was currently inhabiting. Just a long string of unread messages discussing the merits of some poor girl’s tits versus her arse. Draco rolled his eyes.
/H/D/H/D/
Harry collapsed back onto the bed, eyes closed in a deep sleep. Draco drew in a deep breath; now was the difficult part. He called Maddie into the room who
Draco obediently slumped onto the sofa, sighing as he breathed in the smell of hot coffee. By the time Maddie brought over a towering plate of toast, he
The smile was still in place hours later when Draco finally arrived home. Harry had once again joined them for the night and Draco had regaled him with his
“This is brilliant, Draco!” Maddie exclaimed. “Harry will get his memory back and you can finally ask him out. I call dibs on bridesmaid at the wedding!”
“What’s going- Oh! Draco!”
“Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. They were your best friends in school and, as far as I am aware, have remained so.”
“Not as much as you two, apparently,” Harry rolled his eyes.
Draco grunted in response and collapsed into his chair next to the Mediwitch. He knew he looked a mess. He had slept fitfully; his dreams had been

“I mean,” Draco tried to rescue the situation, “that sounds great Hermione. Er, do you know if I have work today?”
As he chewed – chocolate fudge, get in – he couldn’t help but laugh at the look of pure betrayal and disgust that blossomed on Draco’s face.

“Oh,” Harry said, the smile falling from his face as his lips quirked down in worry. “I’m sorry if I was too forward. I just… I guess I thought that you
“See? Sugar cures all,” she declared grandly. “I’m going to grab a coffee. Want one?”
Furrowing his brow and taking a deep breath, Harry steeled himself. He had also prided himself o
Wide grey eyes watched as Harry moved closer and closer, the space between them disappearing as breath mingled with breath. Harry smiled – not a blinding
“H- hey, h- how are you doing?” Harry stammered in greeting, cringing internally and taking the seat opposite her.
Draco faltered in surprise; he’d never even considered calling Potter anything other than that.
“What?” she asked, her brow furrowed.
“Hello, Harry,” he greeted. “Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley have just arrived to see you,” he said, reaching out and touching the brunet’s shoulder
Less than a minute later a familiar brown, bushy head appeared in the fireplace.
The hospital Floo was thankfully quiet at this time of night and Draco soon found himself spinning into his fireplace. He stepped out onto his carpet,

bathroom and began to rummage around in his potions cabinet. Hangover potions, cough draughts, Pepperup, Sleekeazy’s Hair Tonic, ah! Dreamless Sleep
A pale, worried face appeared above Harry.  “Potter!  Are you alright?”
“Bugger off, ferret,” Weasley spat, shoving past Potter like some lanky, ginger bodyguard.  “Leave Harry alone.”
“Ah,” Maddie said as the pin dropped.
Harry gulped. His stomach churned with... excitement? Yeah, it must be excitement. After all, Cho was beautiful, kind and obviously liked Harry. He'd have to be stupid not to want to go out with her, right?
Draco breathed a small sigh of relief as Harry’s attention shifted to Maddie; faced with that smile and those green eyes he felt helpless, like he couldn’t
Trying to forget about the whole traumatic experience, Draco joined Pansy at the breakfast table.
“I am not avoiding Harry.”
“Erm, kinda,” he replied hesitantly.  He wasn’t sure how his friends would react when they found out who the person was that had caught his attention.
“Is everything alright, Harry?” Hermione asked worriedly.  “You’ve seemed a bit off all day.”
Draco flinched at the venom in Weasley’s voice and out of the corner of his eye saw Maddie jump to her feet behind the welcome desk, her face screwed up in
The girl sat primly down on one of the long benches bordering the nearest breakfast table and Harry cautiously sat down beside her. She poured two cups of tea and glanced at him from the corner of her eye.
But before the confusing thoughts could continue, Malfoy was on him again. His soapy hands were running all over Harry’s body, everywhere but the place Harry most wanted them to be. As if he could sense this, Malfoy smirked.
Yes, Harry thought, as he closed his eyes. Because now he knew what he wanted and he was damned if he was going to let it slip away.
hovering outside of Harry’s room. The door was propped open just enough for Draco to peek inside and, from his vantage point he could see the trio chatting
She smiled mysteriously at him and beckoned him forward once more and into the darkness of the tent. Harry coughed as he entered, the air smoky and pungent with the smell of burning herbs, and blinked in the gloom. In the middle of the space he could make out two embroidered chairs seated around a worn, wooden table. The witch gestured to the nearest chair and Harry sat down.
Potter frowned at Draco and looked around the room in confusion. For a moment, Draco was worried that Potter’s hearing had been damaged and he was about to

Harry tried to ignore him, he really did – he knew that Malfoy was just trying to distract him so he could beat him to the snitch – but there was something about the way the way that the blond flew, graceful, hair practically glowing in the sun, that forced Harry’s gaze to him again and again.  The way his Quidditch robes fluttered around him, the way his strong thighs gripped onto his broomstick, the way, when he leaned forward in a burst of speed, Harry got the most amazing view of his-
Draco smiled at him. “Me too, Harry.” He leaned down to place a gentle kiss on Harry’s lips. “And plenty more like it to come.”

As fast as he could without seeming suspicious, Harry rushed to the living room and threw a handful of floo powder into the fireplace with a shout of
Draco was working hard to clear the rubble and debris in the Great Hall when he heard the shouts and screams coming from down the corridor.  He paused in confusion and poked his head out of the door to see what the commotion was.
“If I move over here…”
Draco! He now had a name to match the pale, slightly pointed face he had seen in the mirror earlier. Bit of a weird name, if you asked Harry, but probably not that out of the ordinary in a place like this. Harry’s only experience of school had been the grey, concrete comprehensive in Little Whinging that he’d left as soon as he was sixteen. But this was something else.
“We knew each other in school?” Potter asked, clearly excited to find someone who knew him and completely oblivious to Draco’s inner turmoil. “Were we
ploughing through the pile at an alarming rate.
“Oh, would you look at the time,” he said, interrupting Harry and glancing dramatically at his watch, “it’s getting really late. You should be going to bed
“Well,” she answered, “it’s just that it was kind of obvious, wasn’t it.”  At Harry and Ron’s dumfounded faces, she continued.  “I mean, he’s been flirting with you for ages, Harry.”
He started as warm fingers brushed his chin.  “Cheer up, Potter.  Buy you a drink when this is over?”
“Yeah, he was probably hurrying off to do some more lurking,” Ron added through a mouthful of eggs.  “Maybe he’ll jump out at you from behind a suit of armour on the way to Transfiguration.”
“Harry,” the man offered, reaching to shake Draco's outstretched hand.

His heart drummed in his chest, adrenaline fuelled by what-ifs shooting through his bloodstream. He needed to calm down. Maybe there was someone he could speak to first. Someone who had experienced a similar thing and who understood and who would listen to him without the risk of judgement. Harry's eyes widened with realisation. Why didn't he think of it before! He knew someone else, another guy who didn't like girls in that way. Someone who liked guy instead. Not that Harry liked guys in that way... maybe... urgh. That was enough soul searching for one day.

If possible, Malfoy looked even more confused at Harry’s greeting.  A moment of tense silence passed until Malfoy slowly nodded his head at Harry.  Harry breathed out a sigh of relief and took Malfoy’s nod as permission to carry on talking.
It happened again a few weeks later. Draco had fallen asleep in his bed, relaxed and looking forward to a weekend of doing absolutely nothing, and was rudely awakened by the sound of car horns from outside his window. Scratch that. From outside
/H/D/H/D/
Hermione glanced up from the book she was reading in between bites of toast.  “Just ignore him, Harry.  You know he only does it to get a rise out of you.”
Harry blinked as the flashing lights and bright colours assaulted his eyes. He stared at the people and sights around him, trying to orientate himself. Yes, he was back at the fair. The old witch’s spell had worked. He had seen his future and now had the chance to make it happen. What was it she had said? “So if you want, you must not falter, your future lies within your hand.” Then that was exactly what he was going to do.
Butterflies fluttered in his stomach. What would he wear? He jumped up from the bed and hurriedly began pulling clothes from his wardrobe and quickly discarding them on the floor. Too scruffy, hole in the elbow, dirty. Harry sighed. He needed to make a good impression – he knew Draco took very good care of himself and didn't want to look like he wasn't making an effort for their da- meeting.
-----
Hermione’s face lit up. “Yes! Harry, we went to a fair ages ago. Must have been four or five years ago. That’s the last thing you remember?”
Malfoy gave him an askance look. “We are a bit slow this morning. I know you told me to fuck your brains out last night but I didn’t know I’d done such a good job,” he said with a smirk. “Yes, although you drew the line at me naming him Salazar! Ron and Hermione thought it hilarious, you living with two snakes.”

Falcon chaser who had unfortunately been hit with a rather potent Bat Bogey Hex – was discharged from the hospital.

Harry didn’t look convinced. “Are you su-“
“Everything okay, Harry?” Maddie called out.
“Good morning, Harry,” he greeted, trying to act as though the previous few minutes had never happened.
Pansy sighed as her stomach rumbled once again.  At this rate there’ll be no breakfast left, she thought dolefully as the smell of bacon and eggs wafted out of the Great Hall.  She glanced across at her best friend who was nervously pacing trails into the already worn cobblestones of the corridor.  She supposed she should be used to it by now – after six years Potter-watching was as much a part of her daily routine as brushing her hair – but she had to admit that it was getting out of hand.

Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Thank you very much for your input, Mr I-have-a-tikka-masala-every-time, but, unlike you with your delicate sensibilities, I’m actually adventurous when it comes to trying different food.”
After a slightly awkward start in which he forgot all words in his vocabulary except “erm” and “um”, Harry found himself having a nice time with Cho. He picked at the generous slice of treacle tart in front of him as she moaned about her room mate (drinks milk from the carton). She sipped her drink and listened, chin resting in her hand, as Harry talked about living with Ron and Hermione (great so long as you didn't catch Hermione just before an exam). This is no big deal, Harry thought. It's just like hanging out with the guys at work or with Hermione.
cheeks and bloodshot eyes. “It’s an experimental technique so we don’t really know if it will work or not.”
“I’m pretty sure it was just an accident, Harry,” Hermione reassured him.
“Really, Harry, it wasn’t too awful.  Neville wasn’t even singed that badly,” Hermione consoled him as they made their way to the Great Hall for dinner.
He could tell from the determined set of her jaw that she was dying to ask what the hell had happened with Draco just moments before but she seemed to
Hermione looked up at him with bright eyes as if surprised he’d shown an interest. “Oh! It’s going well, thank you. The LNAT is only a few weeks away but my preparations are nearly complete. I know they say that you don’t really need to know that much about law to pass but I thought, just to be on the safe side,” she finished in a rush.
Potter breathed out a sigh of relief and Draco waited as he remained silent, processing all the information he had just been told. “I don’t know how to
when a knocking and shouting at his front door interrupted him.
Harry sent him a wide grin and turned his gaze on Hermione, who heaved a long-suffering sigh.  How she always got dragged into these idiotic schemes she’d never know.
“Yes, Harry,” she added.  “If you aren’t going to join the Aurors what
Harry blushed.  “Er, nothing.”
Malfoy raised his eyebrow at him. “Ok. I’ll clean up in here while you do that.”

He frowned as, rather than insulting Harry’s hair or glasses or general state of dress, Malfoy swaggered forward.

bushy, brown mane. He sighed and stood up as the wizard and witch approached. This was it then.
“Why does Malfoy have to be such a prick?” he asked nobody in particular.  “What, does he just lurk around the castle waiting to insult me or something?”
The staff room was one floor below Spell Damage so it only took Draco a few minutes to nip down, grab the very battered set of wizard chess and head back
Harry grinned and turned to the front of the book. “Sure. Look, here’s one of me in my first year at Hogwarts,” he said, pointing to a photo of a very
“But-“
Malfoy knew.  Harry could just tell as he met the Slytherin’s eyes across the Great Hall.  He flushed scarlet, convinced that his dirty secret was laid bare on his face and that Malfoy could see every perverted thought racing around in his mind.
Draco looked at Hermione – she looked as stunning as the Mediwitch in her matching blue gown – and nodded. He straightened his suit, pausing to check his

Her eyebrows shot up in surprise. “Really? What is it?”
Draco swore internally. Great job of blending in, idiot, he thought. He realised the real Harry wouldn't know anything about law entrance exams or university rankings. From what he could tell from the lack of textbooks and uniform in the bedroom, Harry had left school at sixteen and worked at the restaurant full time.

Harry was not having a good time. It’ll be fun, they’d said. Just give him a chance, they’d said. But no, Draco Malfoy was still as big a prat as ever. Never mind that so far Harry could only seen the back of his stupid, unnaturally blond head from where he was waiting for them by the ticket booth. Once the git eventually turned around, he was sure that he’d see the trademark Malfoy scowl, the look of disdain that instinctively made Harry’s hands curl into fists.
“Thank Merlin. I thought I was going to have to read another of the books Hermione gave me. Don’t get me wrong, she’s great, but these books are just so

“I assure you,” Draco narrowed his eyes at Pansy, “that I am perfectly capable of looking presentable.”
On the walk back, Harry was increasingly aware of Malfoy’s proximity.  He imagined he could feel the heat from the Slytherin’s body through the few feet of air separating them and was almost disappointed when the large entrance doors loomed before them.
Harry laughed.  “No one’s accosted me yet but I’m sure it’s only a matter of time.”
And if he had the smallest trace of doubt about Draco, even the tiniest hint that he was making the wrong decision, the look of amazement on the Slytherin’s face at hearing Harry say his name would have blasted it to shreds.
Harry looked over at Hermione who did, in fact, look extremely calm, almost as if she was expecting this.
Draco scowled at her. “What do you mean by that?” he demanded, damning the uncontrollable blush that spread up his neck.
Draco closed the door after them. “Okay, Harry?” he asked.
It wasn’t until Harry heard his teeth chatter that he realised that he had forgot to bring his coat.  His school uniform was hardly enough to keep away the evening chill and he found that once he started shivering he couldn’t stop.
“Oh, Harry! We were so worried when we got the call this morning. Thank Merlin you’re alright,” she babbled, her face buried in Harry’s neck. Harry looked

“I can manage quite alright on my own, thank you,” he replied, coolly.
“Well, it wasn’t just a photo of me,” Draco explained. “It was of both of us; of us playing Quidditch in school.”
When he got home that evening, Harry decided that he needed a plan.  A plan that relied on subtlety and cunning rather than giving into his Gryffindor-ness and charging headfirst into the situation like he usually did.   And for that, he needed Hermione.
“It’s just, it’s a bit weird isn’t it? I mean, why on earth would he have it?”
Draco steeled himself, tempted to hide in the relative safety of the room until whatever was happening to him stopped happening. But then you’ll never find out what’s going on, another part of him whispered conspiratorially as the oaf outside continued to hammer the door. Draco’s curiosity got the better of him. He held his breath as he cracked open the door and peered into the hallway beyond.
“Why not?” Harry asked.  “Everyone says it’s the perfect job for me.  No one can understand why I’ve been putting it off for so long.”
“What’s wrong, Harry,” he whispered throatily. “Is there something you want?”
Draco’s face scrunched in confusion.  “Like what?  I could spike his pumpkin juice with an uncontrollable hiccupping solution?  Or I could charm his hair green?”
reaction from him. “Hey,” she moved closer and rested her hand on his shoulder, “everything okay?”
After declaring stage one of the Operation a roaring success, the next day Harry pressed onto stage two: smiling.  Much the same as the day before, Harry apparated into the designated zone in the Hogwarts grounds, walked to the front of the castle, and greeted his fellow volunteers.  Only today, when Malfoy glanced up at Harry’s arrival, Harry sent the man a small but friendly smile.  Harry held Malfoy’s gaze long enough to see the return of the puzzled frown before he headed inside the castle.  From then on Harry smiled at Malfoy at every chance he got - when they passed each other in the ruined corridors of the castle, when took their lunch break in the Great Hall, and when they went home at the end of a hard day’s work – but for three days all Harry received in response was a look of total befuddlement before the blond would hastily look away.
They stood there like that, under the water as they regained breath. Malfoy’s hands traced circles on Harry’s hips and Harry finally got a chance to touch Malfoy’s pale skin, his fingers trailing over biceps and shoulders and running over dusky pink nipples. He discovered that Malfoy was ticklish if you stroked him in just the right place under his armpit, that he flushed down to his chest after he came and that his hair turned a breath-taking shade of gold when wet. This could be mine, Harry thought. And the thing was, he wasn’t so sure that he didn’t want it anymore.

Malfoy smiled at the Gryffindor’s gobsmacked expression and sauntered through the double doors of the Great Hall as Harry watched, dumfounded.
“Aw, come on, Draco,” Harry urged, shaking the box of sweets in his face.  “Look, we’ll do it together”.
“Say hi, Draco.”
“Only one way to find out,” Hermione replied with a grin as she marched into the tent, pulling Harry unceremoniously behind her.
“Potter,” Malfoy greeted, his face now schooled into one of mild amusement.  “What a surprise.  I must say that this is the last place I’d expect to see the Chosen One.”
The next day at Hogwarts, Harry’s eyes were drawn immediately to Malfoy, who was standing off to the side from the rest of the volunteers with a casually blank expression on his face.  Malfoy, he decided, was a very good actor, but Harry could see how he warily eyed up anyone who walked too close and how, when once again no one talked to him, his mask slipped briefly into a sad sort of resignation.  Harry stared so hard and long at Malfoy that the blond glanced up at him - their eyes meeting and a confused frown crinkling his pale forehead - before he quickly turned away.  Strange to think it but Harry reckoned he missed the cocky, sarcastic, and arrogant Malfoy who had tormented him for the last seven years.  This Malfoy, who kept his head down, avoided glances, and altogether acted like a kicked puppy, was just wrong.  If only someone could get him to open up, thought Harry, and he smirked as an idea popped into his head.
Draco’s fingers turned rough in Harry’s hair as he arched upwards, straining as he sought for some friction against the aching cock lying untouched on his

Draco shook his head. “I still need to read up on the research and practice the spell so perhaps in a day or two.”
He brushed away the feeling, reminding himself that, no matter how many interested looks the Auror gave him, he was Harry’s Healer and that was all. “I’m
“You’re broom’s fine.  It’s you I’m more worried about,” Malfoy said.

Hermione, however, was not the least bit shocked.  It would have taken someone with the emotional range of a teaspoon to miss the sexual tension between those two.  “Oh, Ron,” she sighed, taking in her boyfriend’s puzzled and slightly alcohol addled expression.  “Let’s go home.  I’ll explain in the morning.”
“Yeah, just ignore him, mate,” Ron agreed.  “Hey, can you imagine if Malfoy actually tried to hold your hand?” he laughed.
“I think you know what I mean,” Maddie replied, winking at him as she stepped into the fireplace and disappeared in a whoosh of green flames.

“Yeah?”  Harry asked.  He knew that he was smiling like a loon but he just couldn’t find it in himself to care.

Draco saw her mouth open and, having previous experience of just how loud Maddie could be, hastily held a finger to his lips and pointed to the corridor,
Draco flushed the most adorable shade of pink and smiled.  “Well.  That’s alright then,” he said, reaching under the table and entwining his hand with Harry’s.

Once again, words failed Draco as he nodded in answer.  He stared blankly into his hands, worried beyond belief for the safety of the man who had turned his world upside down in just a few short months.  Harry, with his easy smile that Draco was once so confused to be faced with but now couldn’t imagine not seeing every day.  Harry, with his mystifying but utterly endearing ability to talk for hours on end about seemingly anything.  Draco could see him now, the way his eyes would light up when he talked about something he was passionate about, and the way he would smirk victoriously when he made Draco laugh.  Merlin, he couldn’t lose him.  He just couldn’t.
Harry couldn't stop grinning. He'd made plans to meet with Draco this weekend. Actually seeing each other face to face! Not that Harry hadn't seen Draco's face before but, well, never when Draco was actually present.
“You named him?” Harry questioned.
Harry suddenly deflated as he pondered this.  Malfoy was right.  He’d been fighting Voldemort for as long as he could remember and the bastard had taken so many things away from him - his parents, his friends, his childhood - that it was no surprise really that all he wanted now was to be as far away from dark wizards as he possibly could.  Harry let out a sob of a laugh as the doubts and worries that had plagued him all summer began to clear.
But, and here was Draco’s issue, he did not want to marry Pansy. Nor did he want to marry any girl for that sake. There were many things he would do for his parents. He could be the perfect horse-riding, tweed-wearing, boarding-schooled (and potentially inbred) son, but there was a line Draco would not cross. The very thought of squashing down this part of him, a part revealed only to Pansy after they’d consumed rather too much of a smuggled bottle of vodka, a part he knew would disgust his parents and alienate him to his peers, made him feel physically sick.
hips were pulled back, leaving Draco with his arse up in the air. Hot breath grazed his lower back and he felt a flush spread up his neck as he realised
“And that’s it, gents!  That’s the end of our speed dating night.  I do hope you’ve enjoyed yourself and, who knows, maybe even met someone who’s caught your fancy,” Maddie winked and Harry felt the tips of his ears blush as he resolutely stared ahead, determined not to turn around and look at a certain blond.  “But please don’t hurry off.  Your shared chemistry results will be with you shortly so stick around, have a drink and thank you for coming!”
Draco leaned forward, impatient. “And?”
begrudgingly left the warmth of his bed and slouched to the door.
Tears were now freely flowing down Draco’s cheeks. His tongue felt dry and useless in his mouth so he did the only thing he could think of to tell Harry

The road in front the building was gridlocked with countless cars, black taxis and dusty red buses, and blaring horns and shouting voices filled Draco’s ears as he was swept up in the throng of people marching along the pavement. Commuters bumped shoulders with him as they made their way to wherever they were going, and Draco marvelled in the feeling of being anonymous. No one here knew him. His pulse jumped as he realised this was exactly what he had been looking for. Somewhere for him to escape into, to be himself and to set his own path.
“Well,” Hermione sighed and closed her book, resigned to the fact that she was unlikely to get any more reading done this morning, “maybe he was just on his way out.”
“How do you know how I like my coffee?”

slipped under his shirt, fingers caressing the feverish skin of his stomach.
By the time he made it back to the dishevelled bedroom he had woken up in what felt like days ago, Draco had just enough energy to pull back the duvet before crashing on the threadbare sheets and falling asleep.
Malfoy and Ron filed in behind and only then did Harry realise just how small the tent was. It was no larger than a broomstick cupboard and, as Hermione and Ron fussed around with knuts and sickles, Harry was pushed up against the side wall, a head full of hair in his face and his arms full of a very pointy Malfoy.
“Hey!  Harry, wake up!”
beautiful in her floor length, sky blue dress – Draco had wanted green but had been unceremoniously shot down in favour of a more house-neutral colour.
Pansy raised an eyebrow sceptically. “Oh, nothing much. You danced around in your underwear, declared your love for Professor Sprout in front of the entire school and then jumped in the lake.”
He looked around in panic but the tube was already moving, the track underneath squealing as metal moved on metal. He held out a hand, as if with enough willpower he could magically keep the tube in place, but the platform disappeared in a rush along with the man.
He spun around and came face to face with a snake. About four foot in length, the snake was lying in a shallow pool of water inside a giant glass tank. It looked completely unconcerned to see Harry and seemed to think that the whole situation was perfectly normal.
“But- but Seamus said that-“
Draco raised his hand to knock – he’d lost count of the number of times he’d hesitated outside Harry’s room in the last hour, fist poised to rap on the
looked panicked for a second until Draco added, “Don’t worry though. I’ll be back in this evening and then I want to hear all about-“
As expected, his friends did not share Harry’s enthusiasm for finally making Malfoy smile, and when Ron asked why he even cared Harry had no answer for him.  He wasn’t sure quite when helping Draco Malfoy had become so important to him.  Maybe it was around the same time that Harry realised that they weren’t so different.  Yes, they had been on different sides of the war, but both of them had been used, had been pushed and pulled around like chess pieces, and both of them now seemed unsure of how to move on.
“Are you alright?” Draco asked, concerned.
because my aunt killed your godfather, because I’m the reason Albus Dumbledore is dead, because my parents supported the psychopath who murdered your
Harry had been shaking with nerves as he closed the door behind them.  It wasn’t the first time Draco had been to Twelve Grimmauld Place but there was something about that night, the way the air crackled between them like the calm before a storm, full of tension and expectation that had put Harry on edge.  He could tell that Draco felt it too; the way the blond had lingered in the hallway almost shyly, uncharacteristically waiting for Harry to make the first move.  This was new for both of them.
“I’ll finish up for you here if you like, Draco,” Maddie interrupted. “You should go see Harry. He’s been asking after you.”
“Harry!  Are you alright, mate?” Ron shouted, rushing to his friend's side.  Harry nodded causing the redhead to punch him on the arm.  "That was absolutely brilliant!  We've really got a chance at the Quidditch Cup now!"
Tears burned in his eyes at the hopelessness of it all but he held them back. He was a Malfoy and, no matter how much his name was dragged through the

“You’re up late,” the snake said, rather disapprovingly. “The other one has been awake for hours.”

“Care to hear you fortune, dear?”

exists; he didn’t seem shocked at all to see me casting spells around him.”
Harry had scrawled a reply that was sure to enrage the blond even more and fell asleep.
More confused than ever, Harry turned away from the snake. It’d refused to speak any more until Harry brought him breakfast anyway. Instead, he sneaked towards the open kitchen door and peered around the corner into the room. Well I’ve definitely found the source of the banging, Harry thought as he stood there motionless, glued to the spot at the sight of Draco Malfoy waltzing around his kitchen in nothing but a baggy Falmouth Falcons t-shirt and a pair of rather ratty Slytherin pyjama bottoms. And to make things even stranger, it looked as if he was trying to cook.
Later proved to be lunchtime, when Harry found Malfoy sitting alone at the end of the single, long table that ran the length of the Great Hall.  Instead of sitting in his customary seat halfway down the table, Harry made himself comfortable on the bench across from Malfoy, who looked up from his plate at him with a frown.  One by one, the other volunteers noticed the absence of their Golden Boy and stared down the table at the sight of Harry Potter sitting with a Death Eater, but Harry ignored them and instead sent a winning smile in Malfoy’s direction before helping himself to food.
Harry looked up at him with bright eyes, a warm smile curving his lips, and Draco felt his breath catch as his mind unhelpfully supplied another image of
If his concentration was strained at the beginning of the class, it was absolutely destroyed now.  His potion was a complete disaster and wasn’t helped at all by his sudden compulsion to turn and stare at Malfoy every few minutes.  A scream of “Harry!” was all the warning he had before his neglected cauldron exploded in a shower of bright green gloop.
Draco was hyperventilating. “Fuck, fuck, fuck,” he chanted as he paced a trail into the thick carpet. “What the hell am I doing? What if he’s changed his
Harry showed no resistance as Malfoy guided him upstairs by the hand, pulling him into the same bedroom as he had woken up in and through into the en suite he had no idea even existed. He raised his arms as Malfoy hurried to undress them both, trying and failing not to stare when Malfoy threw off pyjamas to reveal stunning, porcelain skin that Harry itched to touch. When Malfoy stepped under the hot mist of the shower and held a hand out invitingly, Harry’s willpower snapped. Who cared if this wasn’t his life? Shouldn’t he at least make the most of it while he was here? And hell, it could be his life if he wanted it.
hesitantly grip Harry’s waist and smooth lips pressed into his.
With the help of Malfoy, Harry trudged back to the castle, all the while trying his hardest to ignore the warm body against him, the strong arms under his shoulders, and the smell of musk and grass that was threatening to overload his senses.  He could feel Malfoy’s even breaths as they worked their way through the castle, blessedly empty with most of the school still out on the Quidditch pitch, and concentrated on the steady in and out to calm his own frantic breathing.
A loud horn interrupted his examination of a rather plain looking wizard and he turned to find the registration witch standing on a chair.  “Can all the participants of tonight’s event please take a seat at one of the tables behind me?  We’re ready to begin.”
The disembodied voice spoke again. “Your photographs are now available for collection. Thank you for using WizSnaps.”
“I suppose you needed your rest after last night,” Malfoy said, shooting Harry a filthy grin that left no doubt in Harry’s mind about what last night had entailed. “Sit down then. I’ll make you some coffee.”
est friend. How much easier his life would be if he could just marry Pansy, Draco thought. She was attractive, he could admit, with short, dark hair cut into a bob that offset her round face and slightly pug-like nose. She came from a “good family” and her parents had been friends with Draco’s mother and father for years. They’d surely declare it an excellent match and congratulate themselves on securing the next generation of horse-riding, tweed-wearing, boarding-schooled (and potentially inbred) progeny.
As they said their goodbyes and Harry turned towards Gryffindor tower, he braced himself for the barrage of questions that he knew would be awaiting him there.
The Mediwitch guided Draco out into the corridor as Healers rushed in and the room suddenly became a frenzy of activity.  She gave Draco an encouraging smile as she sat him down in the waiting room with a cup of hot tea.
was feeling much more human.
“Just shove off, Malfoy,” Potter said, grabbing Weasley by the arm and dragging him away.  “Come on, Ron.  He’s not worth it.”
He was about to respond when Snape flew into the room like an oversized bat, gave them their instructions for today’s potion and left them to collect ingredients.  Harry shuffled to the ingredients cupboard, not particularly eager to begin brewing a potion that he was only going to screw up anyway, when he felt someone bump against his side.  The first time it happened he ignored it – after all, a bit of shoving and elbowing wasn’t uncommon in the hurry to get the best ingredients – but the second time was accompanied by the brush of a warm hand against his that could only be deliberate.  He looked around, expecting to see the pretty Ravenclaw who had been giving him eyes over her cauldron for the past few weeks, but froze in shock when he was greeted with the pale, pointed face of Draco Malfoy.

Draco tapped his pen against the desk. His Latin professor droned on in the background - something about subjunctives, Draco thought – but his mind was miles away from the dusty, old classroom. It was swirling around bright lights, loud noises and endless crowds of people who didn’t know his name, didn’t know his family, didn’t expect anything of him.
“No!” Draco shouted as he realised that Harry had misunderstood. “That’s not what I’m apologising for.” He took a deep breath. “I wanted to apologise for
“I know, Hermione, and I’m sorry.  But it was Malfoy’s fault.  He wanted me to be distracted and blow up my potion - that’s why he kept bumping into me and grabbed my hand,” Harry explained.

“Yeah, mate.  It might not be too bad,” added Ron encouragingly, his cheerful tone slightly betrayed by the look of distaste he was currently giving to the confetti-strewn floor.  “I’ll just get us some drinks, shall I?”
Draco saw absolutely no recognition in Potter’s eyes as he looked back at him.
“She helped me with something last week and it turns out that it’s paid off,” he replied with a smirk.
What the hell had happened yesterday? Biting his lip and weighing up the risks of asking Pansy versus remaining silent, Draco took the plunge.

double checking the research to make sure that he hadn’t missed something vital. But no, he was ready.
Digging out a tiny sewing kit (like one you might find in a cheap Christmas cracker) from an overfull cupboard, Draco proceeded to sew shut the tear in Cho’s skirt.
Harry trailed off. So that was what this was? This is what his future could be? Just as he was trying to figure out how to feel about that, Hermione spoke.
“Now that they’re gone will hold my hand again?”
Harry switched his attention back to Cho as they approached the station.
there but, ah fuck it – and clambered onto the bed to sit opposite Harry, leaving enough space in between them for the chess board.
“Thank you for your company.  I had a lovely time.  Goodnight, Harry,” he said as he turned towards the dungeons.
“Then why? You know who I am, what I’ve done. Why are you here?” Draco demanded, his eyes prickling with tears.
Draco stretched his arms above his head, trying to ease the crick in his back – the result of being bent over paperwork for the last hour – and looked at
“Is it about Harry?” she asked with a look that was much too knowing for Draco’s liking.
The day of the Gryffindor versus Slytherin Quidditch match dawned and Harry’s stomach was in knots.  Not only did Gryffindor have to win – they were lying in third place after being beaten spectacularly by Ravenclaw earlier in the year – but Harry had to play Seeker against Malfoy.

Ron’s there now and Kingsley has said that I’m welcome to start whenever I’m ready but I just think that I want to do something different.  But what else could I do, y’know.  I guess I could play professional Quidditch, but I’ve always wanted to do something useful, something to help people and…”
Harry smiled wickedly and, as if that was what he had been waiting for, slowly began to unbutton Draco’s trousers. He worked his fingers under the
“Old habit, I suppose,” Draco replied, intentionally vague. “We knew each other in school.”
They sagged visibly in relief and walked over to the bed to reassure themselves that their friend was going to be alright.  Draco, realising that he was still holding onto Harry’s hand, hastily dropped it and stepped back.

“Fuck, Draco,” Harry moaned, pressing passionate kisses down his neck; in his wildest fantasies he’d never imagined the quiet, reserved Healer to be so
Harry resisted the temptation to close his eyes as warm breath ghosted over his face but he couldn’t help the small gasp that escaped when Malfoy’s fingers brushed the sensitive skin on his neck.  A second later Malfoy’s hands were on him, rubbing up and down his arms to generate heat and Harry felt like he was going to explode from the butterflies suddenly running riot in his stomach.
Draco pursed his lips in thought. It seemed like Harry had done a fair enough job of playing along yesterday, treacle tart aside, and, other than a slight hair mishap, had managed to avoid embarrassing Draco too badly. Pushing the thought away, it would never happen again, after all, Draco poured himself another cup of tea and decided to put the whole debacle behind him.

Harry was distracted all day thinking of the perfect way to tell Draco how he felt.  He could see it in his head now.  I’ll get him alone, he thought, maybe ask him to join me for a walk of the grounds, and then I’ll say how glad I am that we’ve become friends, and he’ll smile - perhaps here I’ll take his hand - and then I’ll look into his eyes and tell him how I’d quite like to be more than friends if he’ll let me.  He’ll grin that eye-wateringly stunning grin he uses when I’ve said something particularly amazing and then he’ll grab me around the waist and pull me close and-

At Harry’s nod, Draco grabbed his hand and, leading him into full view of the diners in the Great Hall, dipped his head down to kiss him.  And, ignoring the outraged shouts and shocked gasps, Harry threw his arms around the Draco’s neck and kissed him back with all he had.
Hermione shot him an apologetic expression.  “We’re sorry, Harry.  It’s just that we know how you get around him.”
“What?” he demanded.
“Maddie,” he said, making her start. “Help me get him into one of the private rooms.”

The silence stretched and Harry racked his brain for something else to say.

There was no way the man could have heard Draco – the doors to the carriage had already closed and the hubbub of commuters exiting the platform would have drowned out any noise – but still he turned to look in Draco's direction. As their eyes met, the man's jaw dropped in shock. Draco clutched his chest subconsciously, struck with a certain, undeniable, unquestionable fact. This man – who was gaping back at Draco with an expression of such shock – was what had drawn him to London for all those years.
Hermione are coming in to visit him this evening,” she said, pursing her lips in confusion when Draco’s frown deepened.
“Harry’s going to be fine, Hermione,” Weasley said calmly as he put an arm around her shoulders.  “Come on, let’s get you a hot drink.  Harry’s in safe hands.”

The witch stared at him, her eyes glinting mischievously in the gloom. “Ah,” she croaked. “I see that you might need more than that. A push, maybe? Very well. I will give you a rare gift: a glimpse into your near future. When you leave this place, you will wake far from here and will have a chance to see what could be yours,” she paused, before adding, “if only you would shed the fear of rejection that clings to your very soul.”
Harry navigated the corridors in a daze, thoughts whirring about in his head at a thousand miles a second.  Only when he entered the Gryffindor common room to stares and whispers did Harry realise that he was still wearing Malfoy’s scarf and only after he had escaped to the quiet of the seventh year dormitory did he realise that the Slytherin had called him Harry.
“Nngh,” Harry groaned.  “My broom?”
he’d be an expert at wandless magic, Draco managed to think through the haze as Harry’s suddenly very lubricated hand grasped both of their cocks together,
It was a credit to his long years of friendship with Ron and Hermione that Harry resisted his urge to flee, instead nodding warily at the witch.
Ron looked between them in disbelief.  “Why am I the only one who seems to find the idea of Malfoy flirting with Harry completely fucked up?”
“What the fuck?” Draco whispered as he examined the face in more detail. He poked and prodded and pinched himself a few times, but the face that was not his remained staring back in horror. Draco’s stomach clenched in panic.
Ron said that it hatched and there was a dragon inside it! And then Hermione said that you saw us, Draco, so we had to try and get rid of the dragon before

Potter hesitated but then the determined, stubborn look that Draco had known and hated so much in school replaced the fear and he nodded.
“Good,” she declared as she took a seat at the bottom of Harry’s bed.  “Now, people are saying that you came in wearing a Slytherin scarf, Harry.”
“I don’t like him, Maddie,” Draco said, staring down miserably into his lap. He took a deep breath –the idea of saying the words out loud was terrifying,

The war had been over for months and Harry was trying to move on like a good little Boy-Who-Lived.  He was expected to be happy, to attend the celebrations, parties, and ceremonies with a smile on his face and his childhood sweetheart on his arm.  Well, thought Harry cynically, breaking up with Ginny weeks after the final battle had definitely ruined that plan.  So much had happened in the time they had spent apart that in the aftermath of the war Harry found that any feelings he now had for her were nothing more than sisterly affection.  Luckily for him, she seemed to expect his stammering apology and took it in her stride, and Harry was relieved to find that he was still as welcome at the Burrow as ever.  After spending weeks sulking miserably around Grimmauld Place with only Kreacher and the occasional visit from Ron and Hermione for company, Harry decided that he needed a distraction.  Being at Grimmauld Place only brought back memories of Sirius cooped up in the house he hated, of Remus, Tonks, and Fred, and everyone else he had lost.  So he kept himself as busy as possible and occupied his time helping in the rebuild of Hogwarts, attending meetings with Kingsley at the Ministry, and meeting up with his friends in Diagon Alley.
“Come on,” Harry said, pulling a resistant Ron to his feet and making a start on his section of tables.
“You don’t want to do that,” Draco said, reaching out and stopping Harry’s hand, “because then my queen can move in. What you want to do is move your
At the mention of his friends, Harry started. Of course, he thought. He’d been such an idiot. He should have contacted Ron and Hermione straight away. If anyone would be able to help him figure out what the hell was going on it would be Hermione.
how he felt. He leaned forward and pressed his lips to Harry’s.
way the Potter’s face lit up when he smiled – such a change from the scowls and smirks he had received from the man in school – that it took Maddie’s elbow
Harry jumped and coughed away the pungent smoke that rushed to fill his lungs. Had the old witch been serious, he thought, clearing the remaining smoke away with his hand. Will I really see my future? He stood up and faced the exit of the tent. Taking a deep breath and hoping that this wasn’t some gigantic joke, he stepped forward. As the dusty fabric slid over his face, he felt his eyelids droop, his head became heavy on his shoulders and his vision went dark.
For a second he contemplated spending the day in bed anyway. The speccy git probably had a shift at his awful job again but that wasn’t Draco’s problem. He crossed his arms resolutely before the guilt crept in. Harry didn’t deserve that. The idiot seemed to have done a passable job of pretending to be Draco the last time so the least Draco could do in return was to not get Harry fired.
“He’s going to be ok.  He’s not awake yet but, if you’d like, you can go and see him,” she smiled at Draco’s enthusiastic nod and continued.  “We’ve had to alert Harry’s next of kin, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger, so they’ll be arriving soon as well.”
Draco explained about the article. “It seems as if they’ve used a wound healing spell and combined it with a memory charm of their own creation. The wand
to feel a bit out of it. Now, can you tell me what date it is?”
“What’s so funny about that?” Harry asked defensively.
Harry stepped reluctantly down the staircase to breakfast the following morning and shot Hermione a glare as she jabbed a bony finger impatiently into his back.  Nerves had been swirling around in his gut all morning and, as the chattering of voices from the Great Hall reached him, he had to battle against his instinct to run back to his bed and hide under the covers.
“Sorry about that, Malfoy,” Granger said politely, throwing one last reproving glare at her husband before turning back to Draco. “How’s Harry? Can we see
Harry pursed his lips in thought, hand hovering over the board. “I could move my knight,” he said, touching the piece and beginning to move it.
Feeling the nervous energy coiling in his gut, Draco stood up from the bed and began to hurriedly pack the chess set away. “Right. Goodnight, Harry,” he
Harry sighed as he escaped the common room.  He hadn’t been wrong about the questioning; as soon as he returned Hermione had pounced on him, dragged him upstairs and demanded to hear every last detail.  But that was at least better than the mutters and whispers from his fellow Gryffindors that had greeted him.  Talk definitely spreads quickly, Harry thought as he made his way downstairs for dinner with Ron and Hermione, his bad mood immediately disappearing when a familiar, blond figure came into sight.
tight boxers barely concealing his erect cock, staring down at him with eyes so blown with lust that it nearly had the Healer coming right there and then.
On the fourth day, Harry was ready to give up.  He was not a patient person and he was beginning to think that there was no way of getting through to Draco Malfoy.  When he saw the man at lunch Harry smiled - more out of habit now than any hope that he might smile back - and gaped in shock as, instead of the frown Harry had become so accustomed to seeing, Malfoy’s lips quirked up into a smile.  Well, maybe not a smile, Harry thought, but it was definitely close enough for him.  He beamed victoriously back at Malfoy, who sent Harry one more quirk of the lips before turning back to his food.  Harry refrained from whooping and punching his fist in the air until he got home, where he immediately floo-called Ron and Hermione to tell them the good news.
“Tell me about it,” Ron agreed. “I swear her skirt is getting shorter every week! If it wasn’t for Hermione, I’d have asked her out ages ago.”
Something fun had turned out to be making the short walk to the local town and spending the day shopping. Never something he had particularly enjoyed – as a child all of his clothes had been hand-me-downs and shopping had been a painful affair of Harry trying not to comment as Dudley attempted to squeeze into clothes three sizes too small for him – Harry actually found himself having a nice time.
“Hey,” he called to a group of volunteers running up the staircase.  “What’s going on?”
“Fine,” she said.  “Now, let’s get planning this crazy Operation of yours.”
Draco could feel his heart galloping in his chest. His hands shook against his sides as they approached one another. The man's eyes – green, so green, how could Draco have forgot eyes so green – met his and Draco gulped.
Weasley and Granger occupied the two chairs in the room and in between them sat Harry, cross-legged on the covers and practically buzzing with excitement.

“Harry, Harry, Harry,” Malfoy tutted. “You know what speaking in Parseltongue does to me.”
Draco rubbed a hand over his face. “Yeah, maybe.”
Draco turned onto a quiet side street, scuffing his shoes against the pavement. He knew he was being childish but that horrible, lingering feeling of being lost was back and he didn't know what else to do.
“What was that all about?” Maddie burst out as soon as they were out of earshot. “You can’t just cuddle a patient like that. You could get into real
Draco sighed. “Yes, he’ll have his memory back, which will also include all of the shitty things I’ve ever done to him, not to mention that I was a bloody
“Your boyfriend,” Maddie interrupted loudly, “will be all better. He’ll have all of his memories back, he can leave here and you two can go skipping off
“Hufflepuffs,” the Slytherin snorted.  “They’re all as mad as nifflers.”
“Of course.  You’d be brilliant at it too, obviously, just like everything else,” the blond joked, nudging Harry with his shoulder as they approached the castle.
Weasley’s face flushed in embarrassment, the colour clashing horribly with his hair, Draco thought.
Harry rolled his eyes at that.  Ron had been trying to convince Harry to join him in Auror Training all summer, but Harry was happy doing what he was doing, thank you very much.  However, it seemed that Hermione didn’t agree with this sentiment.
After seconds? minutes? days? Draco pulled away, lips brushing softly against Harry's one last time, and smiled smugly at the dazed expression on his face.  “Do you have any plans for tomorrow?”
The other wizard looked just as nervous as Harry.  “Hello.”
Draco stared at her, deadpan.
and got away with it while he, who had only been trying to report the offence to the proper authorities, had been punished.
Harry jumped back. “Is something wrong?”
“I thought that would be pretty obvious, weasel,” Malfoy drawled, not bothering to turn around.  “I’m taking Potter to Madam Pomfrey.”

Harry sent a last, pleading look at Ron’s back as it disappeared into the small crowd that surrounded the bar and put up little resistance when Hermione latched a small, but deceptively strong, hand around his forearm and unceremoniously led him to the registration desk.
Cho had been the one to give Harry a chance when he stumbled into Ristorante Gustami almost a year ago asking for a job. He hadn’t been able to stand one more second living with the Dursleys and had run off to London as soon as he was old enough to work. Even though she was only a year older than him, she had taken Harry under her wing and was as good a manager as he could imagine. It was why he couldn’t help but feel uncomfortable when, walking home later that night, Cho came up as a topic of conversation.
“Lovely day, isn’t it?  I just love being able to work outside, don’t you?  I mean, I know that helping out here is part of your community service, right?  But I just love it.  Much better than being stuck at Grimmauld Place on my own.  If I was there I’d only be thinking about…”
“You used to beat me every single time,” Draco managed to croak out.
At first, Harry glared with the rest of them.  After all, Draco Malfoy was a Death Eater, albeit an acquitted one.  The nerve of him to parade around like that as if he was still the respected Malfoy heir, as if no one could see the ugly, black mark burned onto his left forearm.  But after weeks of scowling, Harry began to really notice Draco Malfoy.  The way his face no longer bore its customary expression of superiority, but instead remained blank and passive, even when confronted with the angry jeers of the crowd.  The way he would slouch against the castle walls when he thought no one could see him, the pretence and mask slipping for a brief moment.  The way that, despite the fact that likely no one wanted him around, Draco Malfoy had not run away like he could have and was actually trying to make amends.
“I can’t believe you eat those things.  The last time I had one it tasted like old socks,” Draco grimaced as they stepped out into the cobbled street.
Draco hesitated, wary of being alone with Harry after what had happened last time, but he rationalised that Maddie would be just down the corridor. “Sure,”
Harry shook his head and sighed as he headed to the bar for another drink.  Okay, so he may have followed Malfoy around occasionally in sixth year, and he might have been staring at him a little bit recently, but that didn’t mean anything.  It’s not like he was obsessed or anything.
Ron nodded.  "Well, alright then.  Oh Merlin!  You're not going to start snogging Malfoy in front of me now are you?" he protested with a shudder.
“Maybe it could have been perfect for you, but you’re the Boy Who Lived,” Malfoy pressed on, and Harry noticed the lack of sneer that usually accompanied these words.  “You’ve been fighting dark wizards since you were a baby, Potter.  Don’t you think you’ve done enough fighting for a lifetime?”

Harry grinned and plucked two beans from the box, placing one in Draco’s hand.  “Deal,” he said, throwing the other sweet into his mouth.

Taking pity on Harry, Ron jumped in. “She probably took one look at your ugly mugs and went running to find someone who didn’t smell like they’d showered in cheap aftershave. Unfortunately, I wasn’t there at the time, so Harry was the next best thing!”

She looked pleadingly at him and Harry sulkily crossed his arms in resignation. It’s not as though he had anything better to do, he supposed. After all, the last thing he wanted was to sit around in Grimmauld Place by himself all evening, surrounded by gloom and dust and old memories.
“What happened?” he demanded.
“Er, hi.”
The LNAT? Draco was impressed. Several of his fellow students at school were taking the very same test for entrance to study law at the country’s top universities. He looked at Hermione with new respect.
He did so and felt the familiar sensation of being squeezed through a small rubber tube before he lurched to a stop.  Feet planted firmly on the ground, Draco looked around him to see that the Mediwitch had apparated them to a small but clean private room at St Mungo’s and was now levitating Harry onto a bed in the middle of the room.  Under the harsh lighting of the hospital Harry looked even paler, the blood on his head and clothes stark in contrast, and Draco felt sick.
This pushed Draco over the edge, his entire body stiffening as his balls tightened and waves of white hot pleasure shot through him. Harry’s movements
“But thank you, though,” Harry said.  He took a deep breath; here goes nothing.  “Er, I could give it back to you on Saturday.”

“Don’t remind me,” Weasley laughed. “I don’t think Mum will ever forgive you for missing Sunday lunch.”
After the awkward introductions, he found it surprisingly easy to talk to the wizard.  Harry found out that his name was Jonathan and that he worked in the children’s ward at St Mungo’s as a Mediwizard.  He found out that Jonathan loved cats and the Holyhead Harpies but hated jazz and spiders.  In fact, he was just starting to think that he maybe could have been interested when a familiar posh drawl tore his gaze away and further down the room.
Harry nodded dumbly, aware that he probably couldn’t manage a single coherent word in that moment.  Malfoy smiled.  “Come on; let’s get you back to the castle.”
“That’d be brilliant,” Harry smiled. “Thanks, Draco.”
Harry blushed as he used the word man to describe Malfoy but he had to concede that Draco Malfoy was a boy no longer.  There was no denying that Malfoy, once scrawny and pointy with too-long limbs, had grown into himself over the past year, and shifting rocks and debris at Hogwarts all summer had definitely helped add to the impression.  Not that Harry had noticed.  Nope.  He hadn’t noticed the way Malfoy’s shoulders would ripple and tremble as he worked to move a particularly large stone, and he definitely hadn’t noticed that way the sweat caused by the summer heat had made Malfoy’s shirt stick to him, leaving it almost transparent in places.
Right, pay attention this time, Harry chastised himself.  No more staring at Malfoy.  He slipped into the next seat along and managed to talk to the wizard opposite him for nearly a whole minute before a flash of blond hair in his peripheral completely shattered his concentration.  From then on the evening passed in a blur of names and faces, Harry’s focus solely trained on the man who was moving closer and closer with each blare of the horn.

“He’s never going to open up if you don’t talk to him, Harry,” Hermione had told him.  “Start off light, small talk, and for Merlin’s sake, don’t bring up his parents.  Or the war, for that matter.”

At that moment, the ginger oaf in question swung round the kitchen door frame. “Oi, Harry! You ready to head off, mate?”

As he waited anxiously, the crowd began to thin out and Draco resigned himself to the fact that he had been too late. His shoulders slumped in disappointment as he began the long walk back to Pansy's Kensington flat. He didn't feel like stuffing himself back onto another tube carriage anyway. Maybe they'd get a curry tonight, he thought in a pathetic attempt to cheer himself up.
He stared down into his dinner and pushed his plate away; his stomach was too wrapped up in knots for Harry to even consider food.
I must have hit my head harder than I thought, Harry mused as the Slytherin dropped to his knees beside him.  “I think I’m alright.”  He attempted to sit up and hissed as pain laced down his left arm.  He clutched the injured arm to his chest, snitch still twitching in his right hand as hot tears burned in his eyes.
“Did you talk to anyone nice?” Hermione asked with a waggle of her eyebrows and a small hiccough.

When Harry arrived at Hogwarts the next morning, he could feel the butterflies churning in his stomach.  He had always been dreadful at small talk.  The only reason he had managed to avoid making an idiot of himself at the numerous Ministry events over the summer was because of Hermione and her amazing ability to talk to just about anybody.

Harry chuckled, grateful for a distraction from the pain.  “Yeah, well, it won the match didn’t it?”

It couldn’t be.  But the longer Harry stared the more he realised that there was no mistaking it.  Looking ridiculously out of place among the pink streamers and heart-shaped confetti, and currently sneering at the poor wizard unlucky enough to be placed opposite him, was Draco Malfoy.
The dormitory room slammed open revealing a very confused and angry-looking Ron.
He refused to meet their eyes as he nodded again, the tips of his ears turning pink.

“Hey,” Maddie said, noticing that through all of this Draco hadn’t smiled once. “Aren’t you supposed to be happy? I mean, your boyfriend-“
Harry considered that.  The rumours would definitely be flying by the time they returned to Hogwarts; there would be whispers in the Great Hall, staring in the corridors and probably outrage from some of his friends, but Harry realised that he didn’t care.  The people who meant the most had accepted him and that was all that mattered.
Cho smiled back at him. “I'm good. Made it home in one piece last night thanks to you!”
These thoughts flitted through Draco’s mind as he imagined a different life for himself. A life where he could escape his parents’ judgements and truly be himself.

Harry nodded, the fog of confusion back and muddling his thoughts.
Upon seeing Harry, Draco let out a sigh of relief.  Yes, he was still pale, and he looked so small in the hospital bed, but his face was relaxed in sleep.  Draco walked carefully over to the side of the bed, wary of disturbing Harry, and reached out to cover one tanned hand with his own.  He stroked along the fingers, feeling the smooth skin on the back of the hand and the rough calluses on the palm, not realising how long he had been standing there until a cough from behind him made him jump.  He spun around to see Granger and Weasley standing in the doorway.

“Shit.  You’re hurt.  Here, let me help you up.”  Malfoy shifted, reaching around Harry and lifting him to his feet.
demand another one immediately; after all, with their turbulent history Draco could hardly blame him. However, instead of the outrage he had anticipated,
Draco stared at her in stunned silence, hope blooming in his eyes as he mulled over Maddie’s words. “You really think so?” he asked, voice cracking.
“Well I woke up and there was music and then there was a snake and Malfoy and pancakes and-“ Harry blurted out incoherently.
“So where were you?” Harry asked quietly, oddly vulnerable as the fight drained out of him. “Did what happened in the hospital mean nothing to you?”
to want anything to do with me ever again.”
What the hell was that, Harry chastised himself.  The poor man likely hasn’t had anyone say a kind word to him for months and suddenly you’re in his face rambling about how you love being outdoors! Harry buried his face in his hands, embarrassed beyond belief, and determined to make a better go of it later.
“Harry!” Draco exclaimed, as he dashed over to his bedside.  “You’re awake!”
After forcing his way through a stack of slightly rubbery pancakes – Malfoy had seemed so pleased with himself that Harry hadn’t the heart to tell him – he remembered the snake’s demand.

“Er… speaking of Hermione, I’m just going to give her a call and see if she’s home,” Harry said as nonchalantly as he could.

Following his epiphany the night before, Harry had sent Hermione and, because Harry didn’t feel right about excluding one of his best friends from the plan, Ron urgent owls pleading them to meet with him.  Therefore, lunchtime found the three of them, heads bent together, squeezed around a small table in the Ministry of Magic cafeteria.
The sound of their heavy breathing filled the room as Harry’s hands impatiently slid up Draco’s body, fingers trailing over ribs and circling around
Ron sputtered. “Wait, what?  Malfoy grabbed your hand?”
own stories, like the time he had received his first broomstick and promptly crashed it into the pond or the gruelling hours he had spent coming up with
Draco had been told from an early age that he was lucky, privileged, and should feel honoured to come from such a long and illustrious line as the house of Malfoy. His line stretched all the way back to the first Marquess of Winchester, his father liked to remind him when Draco showed any hint of resistance to the plans that had been laid out before him since birth. He was to attend Avebury Academy for Lords and Ladies - check. He was to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics at the University of Oxford, one of the good colleges, you understand. He was to return to Wiltshire to take over the running of their estate from his father. No, thank you. He was to marry a respectable lady befitting of his station and heritage. Double no, thank you.
Strong hands moved up to Draco’s shoulders and pushed, causing the blond to go sprawling on the bed. He glanced up and felt his cock twitch; Harry was
Harry paused, wondering where the hell to start. “Erm, not that great, Hermione. You see, I don’t really know where I am.”

Damn. That was twice now he’d been caught staring dreamily at Potter. Keep it in your fucking pants, Draco, he reprimanded himself.
She turned to face him, concern in her brown eyes as she placed a delicate, manicured hand on his arm. “Draco, you know you can talk to me if there’s something wrong.”
That Potter was in no immediate danger seemed to drain the last vestiges of adrenaline from the Aurors as together they sagged in relief.
Well, that and also that Harry had finally admitted to himself that he might find Malfoy the tiniest bit attractive.  Maybe.
The remaining dates sped past but Harry hardly noticed.  His feet jittered uncontrollably beneath his seat resulting in more than a few odd looks and, before he knew it, the sound of the horn echoed through the room accompanied by a shout.

Draco sighed. “Is it that obvious?”
“Hey, you guys see Cho tonight?” Seamus asked with an eyebrow wiggle.

Dean grinned in response. “How does she think we’re supposed to work when she’s there swanning around in
Draco's hand shook as he lowered his pen to the paper. He could do this. He could be brave. Even if Harry never saw it, Draco would know that he had been brave enough to admit his feelings to himself.
“I think Malfoy’s up to something,” Harry declared to Ron and Hermione.
As they set off toward the first of the stands and tents, Harry couldn’t help but feel unnerved by the whole Malfoy situation. Having him with them felt so unnatural and yet natural at the same time. Through the noise and bustle of the fair, he could hear Malfoy talking to Hermione, the rich, aristocratic tone so familiar from his Hogwarts days. Except now, rather than inciting anger, that tone was inciting something else entirely, something deep in Harry’s gut that he couldn’t put a finger on.
“I mean that he can’t remember anything. Nothing. Not being an Auror, not his friends, not even who he is,” Draco implored her to understand. He
“I’m just going to go for a walk, guys,” he said as he stood up from the bench.
He hurriedly searched for a mirror amongst the battered furniture. Finding one in the corner of the room, Draco edged towards it and gasped. The face staring back looked to be a similar age to Draco, but with skin the colour of honey, deep green eyes that were wide in shock and a mess of thick black hair, it was decidedly not his.
Harry looked down at his hands and slowly nodded his head.
Draco smiled back at the Gryffindor and, reaching out, clasped a warm hand around Harry’s.  “Definitely.”

As he sat on the bed – and honestly, who had silk bedsheets – he spotted a notepad and pen on the side table. Before he turned the light off, Harry scrawled a quick note to Draco.

“Are you feeling quite alright?” she asked. “You’re looking a bit peaky this morning.”
Draco slumped and let out a sigh of relief before he realised that he now had to try and explain to them that their best friend no longer knew who they

Maddie nodded slowly, finally grasping the gravity of the situation. “How bad is it?”
animatedly.
He saw Potter nod uncertainly and lay his head down on the pillow, his bloodshot gaze never once leaving Draco as he exited the room.
Hermione interrupted.  “Yes, I know what Seamus said.  But that doesn’t mean that you have to charge up here like a rampant hippogriff and shout at Harry.”
Draco glared back at Maddie, silently promising revenge, but softened as Pott- damn it; he supposed he would have to call him Harry now
Not trusting his voice to come out as anything but a high-pitched squeak, Harry nodded.
“Oh! Er, yes! That would be-“ Draco stammered, his face flushing in a very familiar way, “that would be nice.”
He felt himself relax as the tongue continued circling his hole and whimpered when Harry surged forward, pushing past the tight ring of muscle and inside
“Yes, Harry.  I think it does,” Draco grinned as he cupped Harry’s face and bent down for another kiss.

Harry shrugged.  “I don’t know.  I thought about becoming an Auror but, I don't know, it feels too straightforward.”
“Draco! Draco, I know you’re in there!”
“Of course I do,” Draco said assuredly. “As do you, Mother,” he added at Narcissa’s raised eyebrow. She did, in fact, look wonderful in elegant, silver
Outside, Cho hugged Draco in thanks. Smiling, he remembered what the moron gang had been saying earlier that day - that Harry was Cho’s favourite – and decided to do something nice for Harry. After all, a girlfriend would surely help to spice up Harry’s boring life. Draco left the restaurant that evening with a spring in his step and a date arranged with Cho the following day, the rest of the staff stunned into silence in his wake.
Just when Draco thought that he couldn’t take it a single second longer, Harry stopped. Draco whimpered, head whipping up in desperation to stare at the
“Err, right,” he replied, stumbling into the cupboard and rubbing his hand unconsciously.
“Er, hi…” Draco paused as he tried to remember her name. Something Greek. Helen? Hestia? “…Hermione?” he tried.
“Good morning!” Maddie chirped – Draco cursed himself for ever giving her access to his Floo – the a fresh cup of coffee she handed to him only slightly
So much for being adults and moving on from their childhood rivalry, Draco sighed. “Granger,” he replied calmly. “I’m calling from Spell Damage at St

Draco hesitated, unsure about how much to tell them about Harry’s condition over Floo. “He woke up not too long ago and is sleeping at the moment. Why
“Hi, there!” smiled a peppy, young witch, her strawberry blonde fringe bobbing in her eyes as she spoke.  “Are you wanting to register for the speed dating event?”
“Huh,” Harry mumbled as everything slid into place: Draco’s weird behaviour recently, the compliments, the touching, the scarf.  He had been flirting.
Of course, it didn’t help one bit that, being a NEWT student, Harry now took classes with all other students in his year.  Classes that included Malfoy.  His lack of concentration continued all through the day: in Herbology Harry had dropped a rather large pot of soil onto Ron’s foot, in Transfiguration the hedgehog he was supposed to be changing into a pincushion had spontaneously combusted, showering the entire class with spines in the process, and in Charms one of his non-verbal spells had backfired and nearly set Neville on fire.
“Oh, and by the way, Harry. I’ve invited Draco along tonight,” Hermione had said nonchalantly as she’d grabbed a handful of floo powder from the mantelpiece.

“You know, I think the food is the thing I miss most about this place.  Best treacle tart ever,” Harry mumbled as he finished his pie and shoved a forkful of tart into his mouth, a small moan of ecstasy escaping his lips.  He looked up at Malfoy to see the man staring back at him, a look of astonishment on his face.  Harry tried to smile around his mouthful of dessert and was rewarded with an amused smirk from Malfoy before the man stood up from the bench.

“What do I do, Hermione?”
Unable to stay still, Draco paced around his living room and thought about how happy Harry would be when he told him the good news. He could imagine the
Draco smiled back at him, confidence building as his eyes roamed the man's face and felt an overwhelming surge of familiarity. “I'm Draco,” he said, holding out his hand.
Harry stared at him in confusion. “What?”
“Erm, yeah, okay,” Harry said, shooting Draco a concerned look before standing up and following Maddie out of the ward.
Potter had filled out impressively in the past several years, the muscles of his shoulders and arms visible through his thick Auror robes and his strong,

Hermione frowned in disapproval but nodded, taking Ron away and further into the fair. Malfoy shot Harry a curious look before following them into the crowd.
“So,” she said, “did you enjoy your visit from your friends this afternoon?”
Draco’s fingers twitch. He took a deep breath and rapped his knuckles once against the wood.
Nearly paralysed by shock, Draco didn’t notice the arrival of the on-site Mediwitch and jumped as she placed a cool hand on his arm.
He knew that Draco had never had a proper relationship before, not that Harry was one to talk.  That was why they had decided to take things slowly.  After all, despite years of hatred and obsession, they barely even knew each other.  So far things had been sweet, innocent: hand holding in Diagon Alley, light touches over dinner and goodnight kisses under streetlamps, but the looks they had been sending each other all evening had been nothing like sweet or innocent.  It was the heated glance Draco had given Harry as the he licked the last bit of chocolate mousse from his dessertspoon that had been it.  The straw that broke the camel’s back.  Harry had cracked and asked Draco back to his before he could think about what he was doing.

Panic setting in, he jumped into motion and hurtled across the entrance hall and up the staircase, hoping and praying that it was someone else who had been hurt.  Just not Harry.  Reaching the top of the staircase, Draco pushed and elbowed his way through the crowd, cursing at anyone unlucky enough to be in his way, until he reached the front and was brought to a standstill by the sight of blood, so much blood, and a shock of dark hair attached to a body lying motionless on the stone floor.  Draco charged forward and fell to his knees in front of the man he had once hated but now who meant so much to him.
“You can do it, Draco,” she nodded at him.
Wait, WHAT?!
“Oh God,” Harry sobbed, the tender look in his eyes completely at odds with the frantic movements of his hand. “I love you.”

“Urghh,” Malfoy moaned. “I should have known that would be the part you’d pick up on. Now I’m never going to hear that end of it!”
“I hope you weren’t planning on keeping this a secret,” Draco said almost nervously, as if he thought that the unwanted attention would frighten Harry away.  “It’s going to be all over the school by dinnertime that we were here together.”
Harry dimly registered the rapidly approaching grass – in his haste to catch the snitch, he had flown much too low – before he crashed into the pitch with a sickening crunch.  The defeated fluttering of wings against his hand was the only thing Harry could feel as he lay as still as possible and hoped against hell that his broomstick was unharmed.  Bones could be mended but his Firebolt had been a gift from Sirius.
Draco froze, cup of tea halfway to his mouth. “I beg your pardon?” he asked warily.
of him?
The more he looked around, the more Harry grew to think that there was something very, very wrong. Unfamiliar clothes and shoes were dotted around the room, paintings that he’d never seen before were hanging on the walls and, even more unnerving, there was the sound of music coming from downstairs.
Harry shivered as he remembered the tingle that went through him at Draco’s touch.  He knew that he couldn’t have imagined the tension between them in that moment.  When Draco-
Draco could tell that the other man could feel it too, this almost magnetic pull, this sense of rightness. The sudden lurch of the carriage as the tube departed the station jerked Draco back to himself. He had to get off the tube. He had to find this man.
Draco hadn’t realised how raised his voice had become until he noticed the stunned expression on Maddie’s face. He coughed to hide his embarrassment and

Harry nodded once again and the floo connection cut off. He groaned as he stood up, his legs protesting at the rough treatment of having to kneel on such a hard surface for so long. Harry took a deep breath. Time to re-join the person who I could be spending my future with, he thought with a slightly hysterical laugh.
The snake rolled its eyes as if it should be obvious. “The other one. The one with white scales who brings me tasty frogs to eat. Speaking of which… I’m hungry.”

Huh. Harry hadn't thought about that.  He remembered Charlie coming out a few years ago, remembered how quickly Molly and Arthur and the other Weasleys had accepted him.  Why had he thought it would be any different with him?  "You're right," Harry said apologetically.  "Sorry, mate."
The other boy shrugged. “Ok. Can’t have you being late, even if you are Cho’s favourite,” he winked. “Oh, Hermione’s making toast. Best hurry up before it’s all gone,” he finished before galumphing down the hallway.
Draco was never so touchy with patients but Potter had always been different; had always been able to get under Draco’s skin and get a reaction out of him.

“Bloody hell,” Ron exclaimed, slumping down onto an abandoned booth. “What a night. I think my blisters have blisters.”

“Hey!  Potter!”
After shovelling down some slightly singed toast - courtesy of a girl he assumed was Hermione but who had barely lifted her head from an enormous book to say good morning - Draco was unceremoniously dragged from the flat by the ginger boy he now knew was called Ron. And there he stopped. What greeted Draco outside was so far removed from life as he knew it that he couldn’t help but gape at the scene around him in awe.
Harry stared at him, filing away Malfoy’s casual use of his first name for a time when he didn’t feel like he was going mad.
“Hello, Harry.”
Harry nodded sheepishly. “Yeah. I just can’t sleep.”
Draco was jolted out of his worrying as the ward doors slammed open and admitted two very frantic people, one with fiery red hair and the other with a very

“You know, I seem to have had the most dreadful night’s sleep and I find myself entirely forgetting what happened yesterday,” he said with mock casualness and examined his fingernails.
He slipped his hand into the crook of her elbow, the nerves flooding back at full force as Maddie and Hermione positioned themselves in front of him,

neck, his chest bumping against something equally solid as he inched forward. He moaned softly when Harry’s tongue pushed past his lips and, almost
As if sensing her friend’s hesitance, Hermione turned to him beseechingly.  “Come on, Harry.  I know it’s a bit corny but it could be a great way to meet someone.”
Draco let out a bark of a laugh, all of the tension from the evening leaving him.  In another uncharacteristic moment of bravery, and almost without conscious decision, he leaned down and brushed his lips softly against Harry’s.  Draco panicked when Harry tensed briefly in surprise but relaxed as he felt Harry’s smile against his lips and heard him sigh with pleasure.  He pulled away minutely and, noticing that his hand was still stroking through Harry’s thick hair, smiled down at the beautiful man below him.
Harry frowned in confusion before remembering that Draco had been here yesterday. He hoped that the blond hadn't done anything embarrassing. He chuckled uncomfortably and ran a hand through his hair. “Ha, er.. yeah, right.”
SQUARK! SQUARK! SQUARK!
“However,” Draco continued, the pair’s cautious smiles freezing, “it is my opinion that, in order for Harry to recover, it would be best if he is told as
After another back-breaking shift at the restaurant, serving ungrateful customers and having to listen to Harry’s moron friends wax lyrical about their manager’s skirt, Draco had developed a newfound sympathy for Harry. He grumbled to himself as he shoved open the storage cupboard, ready for this whole day to be over. Draco stopped short at the sight of Cho who was clutching her skirt in panic.
“Fine,” Draco huffed in exasperation. “Enjoy the paperwork,” he said, dumping the gigantic pile of notes in front of her.
Hermione blinked at him in shock. “Um, well I actually prefer London School of Economics. They have some excellent courses on human rights law…” She trailed off.
“You have got to be kidding,” Draco was currently ranting, hands gesturing excitedly.  “The Cannons have got absolutely no chance of beating the Falcons this year.”
“Oh Merlin,” Pansy sighed.  Sometimes her best friend was remarkably thick.  “Come on,” she said, stretching her arm around Draco and leading him back down to the dungeon.  “I’ve got some chocolate left from Christmas under my bed.  And I think I’ve got an idea.”

Maddie nodded and Draco paused, wondering whether to tell her about the one photo that he just couldn’t get out of his head.

Just as the panic was beginning to set in, a warm hand settled on his shoulder.
pride on Harry’s face as he told Draco
Harry went to walk back into the kitchen but was stopped short by the sight of Malfoy leaning against the doorway. He was watching Harry with a predatory gaze, the kind of look that made Harry want to run away and move closer at the same time.
“So, have you guys noticed that Malfoy’s been around a lot recently?” he asked, and instantly regretted his choice of topic when Ron and Hermione shared a look that clearly said
Harry grinned at the Slytherin, the strangeness of holding another guy’s hand overpowered by the feeling of rightness bubbling through him.  They finished their drinks quickly, eager to be away from the almost claustrophobic environment of the Three Broomsticks, and breathed a sigh of relief as they left the crowds of Hogsmeade behind them.
At the next station, Draco leapt from the carriage and dashed to the nearest exit. Mentally calculating the fastest way to get back to the previous stop, he manoeuvred around pedestrians and traffic, earning himself several blaring car horns and shouts to watch where he was going. He arrived at the station out of breath, panting as he folded over and rested his hands on his shaking knees, and searched the bustling crowd for the man.
Cho bustled behind the bar. “It’ll be an even longer night if you two don’t start cleaning up,” she reprimanded lightly.

Faced with her puppy dog eyes – a talent she’d perfected over the last few years – Harry sighed, resigned to spending an evening in this sickeningly sweet hell.  He supposed he at least owed her this.  After all, his friends had been his rock over the past few years: they had been there for him through his messy break up with Ginny, through his confusion about his sexuality and there to force him out of bed on days where he just wanted to bury beneath his duvet.

Harry nodded. “What happened that night? Maybe it’ll jog my memory.”
“Okay, that’s fine. Can you tell me the names of your closest friends?” Draco asked, sure that Potter couldn’t possibly have been hit so hard as to make
Harry stared at his mobile phone in panic. It seemed that Draco had been busy the previous day if the countless unread messages were anything to go by. His group chat with Ron, Seamus and Dean had exploded with everyone demanding to know how Harry had managed to get a date with Cho. Then he had a text from Cho herself asking if he was free later to grab some lunch. And finally, Harry spotted a note that had obviously been left by the posh boy himself.
“Okay, so maybe I was a little shit,” Draco conceded, “but you were always up to something. Can you really blame me for trying to get you in trouble?”

So Harry told her everything. The more he spoke the deeper her frown became until he finally finished.

Draco raised his eyebrow in interest, hoping that the tales Granger and Weasley had told Harry didn’t show him in too bad a light, but Harry’s enthusiasm
Michael, accountant, where has Malfoy been all this time? – HORN! – David, obliviator, what on earth is he doing here? – HORN! – Robert, potioneer, oh no, he’s only two seats away now – HORN! – Edgar, crup trainer, shit, what do I do? – HORN!
“You already did but go on,” Malfoy smirked.
“Hey, it’s early days still. Don’t worry if things aren’t coming back yet.” Draco took a seat next to the bed. “May I see?”
Hermione sighed. “When are you finally going to get over this stupid rivalry? It’s been nearly ten years, for Merlin’s sake! You’d get along with him if you gave him a chance.”
Great, Harry thought.  The last thing he needed.  “What do you want, Malfoy?” he asked reluctantly.
Granger nodded in agreement. “That makes sense. Telling Harry about Voldemort-“ Draco winced, silently cursing that he still reacted that way after so many

Malfoy’s mocking expression changed to one of concern and he placed a warm hand to Harry’s forehead. “Harry, are you feeling alright? You look terribly pale. Was it another nightmare?”
Draco grinned - it had worked, he had cured Harry - before the sinking realisation hit him and he deflated. He should be happy; Harry was free to go out
“Shhhh, Draco.  Head hurts.”
“Urgh, hopefully that’s the last one for the night now,” Draco groaned as he sunk into his chair.
“Er, right,” Draco said, focusing intently on the board. “As I was saying, you want to move your rook here because… er…” his brain turned to mush as he
“Oh?” Draco raised his eyebrow.  “You must have been on the receiving end of some pretty funny looks going into the Gryffindor common room wearing that last night.”
It had taken years for Draco to save up enough galleons to finally move out of the Manor – Trainee Healers don’t exactly rake it in and he was determined
“You come to see your fortune,
“I don’t understand,” Draco said, finally finding his voice. “Are you saying that you wanted me to be there when you woke up?”
That memory had made Harry surge forward until he was standing in front of Draco, looking up into grey eyes he had never imagined could contain such warmth, and lean in to capture soft lips in a kiss.  It started off as normal, just mouths moving gently together, until Draco opened his lips with a groan.  It was like the floodgates had been opened: a month of caution thrown to the wind in a rush of hands tangling in hair and impatient teeth nipping at lips.  Harry had gasped as their hips aligned, a hard length pressing into his own and making him see stars.
Harry hummed thoughtfully before grinning. “You really had a crush on me?”

Harry thought. He remembered going to bed, dreading being woken up again by countless nightmares, remembered being at Ron and Hermione’s getting ready to go out. Where were they going? Somewhere outside – he remembered wrapping up warm and travelling by floo to a small village. He remembered lights and noise and smells and a giant flashing wheel.

is the result of a powerful shock to the system. It also looks as though Potter is able to remember general things about his life, such as that magic
An hour later found Harry sitting cross-legged on his bed and staring off into space.  He had quickly hidden the scarf under his pillow – if you had accused him of pressing the wool to his face and breathing in the mingled scents of grass and lemon before hiding it he would have blushed furiously and told you to mind your own bloody business – and was now lost in a daze.
“I’ll just go and let Harry know you’re here then,” he said, turning and making his way down the ward and towards the private room. He knocked quietly just
“Yes, your team, Potter. The other Aurors you were with last night. You arrived with them a few hours ago,” Draco clarified.
“It won’t last for long,” he warned, “but it should be long enough for you to get home.” He passed the item back to her with a flourish and left the room so that she could get changed.
“Harry,” Hermione started in a placating tone, “you do realise that this whole idea is insane, don’t you?”
Looking down at his message to Harry, Draco blinked, his grey eyes losing focus. What was he doing? Putting some last touches to his homework? He thumbed through the notes scattered over his desk. The handwriting on them appeared to be a mixture of his own cursive and another, all pointy and scratchy. Draco frowned as he tried to remember who it belonged to but the memory was elusive, lurking just out of reach.
