“Of course. These are your dragons and they’ll be here every day, so you can have them lined up in any way you want, whenever you want them.” With that, the two planned out a schedule that Max liked. By the time they were done, Max had visibly relaxed. The boy gave Draco a giant grin as they moved on to the organizing the clothes like Max wanted.
What surprised him was that the blonde never lorded the children's mistakes over them. He would gently manipulate their limbs until they were in the correct position, before returning to his place. At that moment Harry would describe Draco as soft, an adjective he’d never associated with the man before. He was fascinated by this New Malfoy and couldn’t keep his eyes off the man.
She grasped Draco’s robes as he sized her up. She was younger then he’d first thought. Her head reached mid-thigh, eyes large in her oval face, ebony hair brushed against a round chin. The clothes she wore were dirty and hung loose on her thin frame. They wouldn't be able to keep a child warm.
The public needed some place to direct such strong, collected feelings. And since the Death Eaters were out of reach, they turned to their damned children to enact their own version of justice.
An hour into the trip, Draco and Jasmine were the only ones still awake. Draco was awake because he was a responsible adult, and Jasmine was still immersed in her book.
For better or worse, this broke the proverbial ice. Although if asked, Draco would say it was for the worse.
Thomas successfully diverted the goat's attention to the silk feast before it by using Draco as a human shield. With the blonde distracted by the appearance of a second head, ‘Jasper' snatched a mouth full of sleeve.
“Yes, yoga, the discipline that includes breath control, simple meditation, and body postures that is used for health and relaxation.” Jasmine stated, she had no doubly looked that up in the time they were getting ready.
“We could go play at a park and climb trees,” Isabelle supplied, blinking up at Draco a stuffed owl wrapped in her arms.
Mittsy was young by house elf standards and had been with the family for as long as Draco could remember.
Max shrugged, “I don’t know, When I’m scared or worried it helps.” This was said in a voice so small and quiet that Draco was lucky to be close enough to hear it.
“I didn’t mean to. But he’s scary.” Max explained to Draco, a fistful of the blonde’s shirt in his hands.
Unfortunately, addressing the child only increased his anxiety. Draco placed a hand above the abused forearm, causing the boy to freeze. Wide blue eyes gazed up at the older man.
A hooded figure dressed in black robes was the single blemish on the street that day. The form’s dark aura conflicted with the world around it. The others on the street were too absorbed in their surroundings to pay the figure any mind. The hood hid the scowling face of a young man. His long hair blonde, almost white, and facial structure aristocratic.
“I know not. This note Young Master Thomas sent.” Mittsy said, passing over the parchment in her hand. Draco’s brow wrinkled as he accepted the paper, they’d received a letter from them a few days ago. A letter this soon after was out of character.
A resounding crack from the branches in front of Draco, had him jump and his wand arm rose in defense. The woods were silent then besides the sound of Draco soft breathe. His eyes narrow, straining to discern a figure between the branches.
“He’s right. I’m the one who's sorry. And look I’m fine, it was only a surprise.” Harry said holding up his hands in a surrender position.
Jasmine and Thomas peered in the cart as one of the cases hanging precariously on the edge started to shift. A hissed, “Max” came from within the mass of trunks.
At this point, Luna had given up keeping them on track after the fourth reprimand and left them to their devices as long as they weren't bother anyone else.
He tossed on his most impressive outfit he owned; in these types of situations it is best to look your best. That is when a person is most intimidating. “Here’s the plan. First, Max and Isabelle. You two go get Uncle Snape.”
“I know that, you prat.” Draco said sharply, his voice becoming gentler when Max shifted at his tone, “I just don’t want them to wake up.”
Draco's stomach felt as if it were trying to leave his body through his throat every time he looked out to the moving landscape. He didn’t know how the others could handle it.
“There’s a rumor in Ravenclaw that Harry Potter had a parchment that showed everyone's exact location within Hogwarts. Is that true?”
Frustrated, Draco turned sharply and walked away from the child. The girl’s sobs followed him out of the alley. He took a few more steps before Draco spun around, cursing his altruism.
His eyes swept over the five, Draco noticed that each kid had an identical pack to Isabelle. He assumed that the packs held all their belongings judging by the lack of other luggage.
A discarded can was snagged from the street and a transfiguration spell muttered. The dented can shifted until it molded into hair-cutting shears. With his new tool in hand, Draco approached the girl once again.
His eyes opened and blinked to banish the fuzzy film that seemed to cover his eyes. From his position he could see Thomas curled up a blanket wrapped tight around himself. And Macy clinging to Jasmine, somehow climbing over Draco last night.
But Harry was here because Draco was his last hope of getting any sort of entertainment today. He would rather be at the office tracking down the arsehole smuggling exotic creatures into the country, but Terrence’s back was acting up, so Harry had the day off.
Isabelle unhappily accepted the other cloth. The three began to clean the mess when Mittsy popped in looking distressed.
Once kids finished gathering their shoes, they brought them to the service desk to pay. Looking down his nose at the cashier when he saw her judgmental look for the kids' untidy appearance.
Merlin how was Draco mean to deal with this kind of emotional turmoil. Hell, he hadn’t even confronted his own feelings about this.
“Nice to meet you all.” Harry said with a disarming smile. Although, it didn't seem to soften the kids any.
“Is that so.” Thomas said, and evil glint in his eyes. The boy wrapped one arm around Jasmine and dragged her into the group hug. She complained but went with little resistance. Thomas' tall frame dwarfed the rest, staying like that until Draco relaxed into the hold.
Attached to the document was a picture of a young man with brown hair and hazel eyes. The image showed the boy glaring at the camera before abruptly turning his head away. Draco’s eyes roamed over the words scratched on the page.
Summoning his hair trimming kit, Draco brought the razor to the side of his head and flipped the switch. Buzzing filled the room, and soon delicate blonde locks fell to the floor.
Draco's path was suddenly blocked by Max, Jasmine’s camera raised and pointed at the older man. He had just enough time to smile before Max pressed down the button.
A beeping noise abruptly disrupted Draco’s reading. Cursing, Draco waved his wand, cutting of the noise. It had already been an hour. If his estimations were correct, and they always were, he only had about half an hour left with this face.
“Can you help me choose my pictures?” He asked, a shy smile on his lips. Max had gotten better at asking for help when he began to feel frustrated or anxious. There were still times when Draco would find Max pulling at his hair and biting his lip. But these instances had declined in the last few weeks.
He looked to the rest of the group for their help on this, but Jasmine looked indifferent, Macy shrugged. She wanted to see them anyway, and Thomas smiled so Draco knew the answer without the boy uttering a word. The boy likes to torture Draco.
Thomas ignored the rest of its flight, but Draco’s expert eyes followed it around until Thomas demanded his attention once more.
Standing in the entryway were the five kids that Draco had claimed guardianship over. Thomas was leaning against the wall, one leg bent at a ninety-degree angle. His brown- leather boot-clad foot rested on the wall.
Before Draco could track where the stare was coming from it was gone, leaving behind an uneasy feeling. And he dismissed it as someone glaring at him because of his infamy as a Malfoy.
Draco stepped to Isabelle’s side. “Let me take a look.” After inspecting those small hands, Draco let out a gasp. “My goodness, you do have potato hands. Fortunately, I have just the cure.”
Draco’s nose wrinkled at the suggestion, he's track record with animals isn't the greatest, but seeing everyone's interest he had to relent. Sighing, the blonde gave the group a nod. They all dashed out the room to prepare for their journey.
Reluctantly picking up his twelve cards, Draco said seriously, “You better pray it doesn't reverse, Jasmine. Because, I have an arsenal here with your name on it.”
All in all, there couldn't have been a more perfect morning. Then, why had he been pacing for the past few hours.
From there he could see the five children, all in varying positions around the room. Isabelle and Max sat on the rug with their favorite toys scattered in the space between them. Jasmine was once more reading out of a thick, hardcover novel. Gold lines wove together creating a complex pattern on the cover. Her back rested against one arm of the couch and her legs stretched out in front of her; lounging on the couch.
“Alright, that’s it!” Draco exclaimed, storming up to Isabelle first and attempted to sit her upright. The little girl remained boneless during this process, allowing her body to flop over in Draco’s arms. It was only his quick reflexes that prevented her from tumbling off the couch.
Unfortunately, his other charge wasn’t looking much better. The older man cringed at the tear streaks and snotty nose that Isabelle still sported even an hour after they’d said goodbye. Isabelle scooped a huge spoonful of ice cream into her mouth between loud sniffles.
But seeing the absolute devastation on both faces as the train carried Macy, Jasmine, and Thomas away, Draco wanted to cheer them up fast. To be honest, he also needed a little pick me up.
Repeating the same routine with Max, Draco let Max test the temperature of the water and cleaned Max’s hair as the boy washed his body.
Ultimately, Jasmine won the 'fun game.'  Draco disagreed, mumbling that it was 'a game from his own personal hell." Nonetheless, he still demanded a rematch as they exited the train and began the short trek to the Manor.
“Look, no more potato hands!” Announced Isabelle while waving her hands around so everyone could see.
The kitchen was first up in the tour because of its proximity to the dining hall. It was a large room, with an excessive amount of counter space. Draco informed the group that Mittsy kept a tight ship in there, so to stay on her good side they shouldn't make a mess of the room.
Letting out a breath, Draco handed Isabelle to Harry, “Well, you are good with kids. I’ll give you that.” He said glancing over at Teddy.
Draco walked down the stairs to the sound of Macy and Thomas fighting over the amount of luggage she had with her.
Merlin, Harry thought, those pants leave nothing to the imagination. He was busy appreciating Draco’s strong legs, shapely ass, and the little bit of creamy skin that was showing as Draco’s shirt slide down the blonde’s body, when a high-pitched voice ratted him out.
“And I’m only an owl or Floo call away. I’m sure between the two of us, we could come up with some amazing schemes.” Draco smirked at her, only half joking.
“You don’t know him like I do. He aligned with Voldemort, and never had anything good to say. You want me to believe that’s the kind of person who should be raising kids.” Harry exclaimed.
Draco rolled his eyes at the obvious lie but didn’t call the man out on it; arguing with Potter was just a waste of energy. It’s not like he might actually enjoy the other’s company. That’s just ridiculous.
Draco then led the group up the stairs to the second floor and into the final room on the tour, the library. Most of the minors showed little interest for the room.
Isabelle preferred to run between the bookcases jumping out at people. Max kept close to Draco’s side, while the siblings looked around, bored. Though judging by the gleam in Jasmine’s eyes, he'd found a kindred spirit when it comes to his love of books.
Draco’s cheeks were flushed from the warmth of the sun-rays that had kept him company for his morning tea. It was rare that this part of England had such great weather, normally the sky preferred to grace the land with rain and clouds.
He continued to point out the different stars and constellations that shared a name with his relatives. Such as the star Regulus and the constellations of Cygnus and Orion.
His next plan was to nab Ron and Hermione for a day out. Something they hadn’t done for quite a while now since they were busy with their jobs and projects. But Ron outright refused when Harry suggested it.
Once dried, Draco helped her into some of his old pajamas, silently thanking his mother for hoarding his things. The outfit was slightly too big on her small frame, but it would work for now.
“Shut up,” Draco muttered into a pillow, but his whimsical tone betrayed the smile that was beginning to form.
Max looked to the laughing individuals hoping for a hint about what was so funny. Unable to find any, he looked up at Draco confused and shrugs.
Macy used Thomas’ shoulder as a pillow, mouth opened wide. Max and Isabelle curled up with their heads resting on Draco’s lap. The blonde stared out the window, hoping the last hour of the train ride would pass swiftly.
“I swear this thing has gotten heavier.” Macy said, giving Draco a look begging for his help with the overweight cart.
“Hey Draco, look!” The brunette drew a dark green line across the blonde’s forearm when he looked into the direction Harry pointed.
And Thomas suggested using his as kindle for the fire, but begrudgingly accepted it at the elf’s insistence.
“Don’t you need to see my credentials or ID? Or to make sure everything is correct when I sign these parchments, Ms. Tally?” he asked in disbelief.
He studies the three teenagers as they walked ahead of him, they all acted older than their age would dictate. All Draco worried about at that age was if his mother's package of baked goods would arrive that day or his next step to annoy Potter.
Draco doubted she'd ever been to the muggle world, instead using magazine articles to fill in her knowledge.
“Thomas if you're not going to help, shut your mouth!” Jasmine panted, digging in her heels for greater leverage.
He could still feel her eyes following his trek down the street. The splashes of orange and red painted across the sky alerted him to the late hour. Cursing, he quickened his pace.
Spying the scissors in his hand the girl shrunk back, even more frightened. Draco stopped the scissors’ movements at her skittishness and sat down next to her.
“I think Draco’s ready to go hunting for a date.” Then started to mockingly make kissy faces toward Draco.
Setting his now cooled drink aside, Draco stood and strolled into the adjacent room. “That’s it! I can’t take it anymore. We haven’t left the Manor for days. You all barely even go outside. It’s not healthy and I am going stir crazy. We are doing something today, anything! Are there any ideas?” Draco demanded, as he stopped in front of the lot.
His tense shoulders relaxed as Isabelle bent down to pick the flowers dotting the trail. The corners of his lips lifted with the sound of Max’s yells as he chased a hopping frog. Laughter left him when Potter pointed out disfigured clouds, suggesting things that they looked like. His suggestions getting more and more ridiculous.
Draco created this ointment specifically for the scars that slashed across his torso. Although it hadn't removed the marks, they were hardly noticeable anymore. A person would have to be up close or knew what to look for.
Macy sat beside Jasmine’s feet, her legs crossed beneath her body. She hunched over a parchment that was covered in lines and notes. Occasionally, she would straighten, eyes focused in thought, and a quill tapping her bottom lip leaving ink smears.
Macy was the only one who had redeemable manners. From this, Draco suspects that Thomas was purposely trying to annoying him with his conduct.
“As you can see, these two have decided to join the ranks of the living dead and refuse to listen to me.” Draco sniffed.
“You are a child of dark wizards who supported that evil and insane man. Your lives are never going to be easy.” Draco said, looking straight into Thomas' eyes.
Draco reached for the hand picking at Max’s fragile skin and for Isabelle’s hand, gaining both of their attention. He gave those small hands a squeeze and asked gently, “Who’s up for some ice cream?"
“And you didn't think to ask the owner if that was OK?” Draco asked, gesturing to himself when he said owner.
“No, that’s not the same shirt.” The girl glanced down, her countenance becoming cheerful when she spotted the bright color. Giving Draco a cheeky grin, she continued down the stairs with a skip in her step.
Macy took the opportunity to inquire about her new guardian's life, waiting until he was once more sitting with a cup to his lips when she pounced.
As those words passed Draco’s lips, the children did just that. Isabelle reached the sliced turkey first. Thomas soon followed, taking two servings; one for himself and one for his sister. Jasmine’s arm passed over Draco’s plate bringing the roasted potatoes closer to herself. Max looked anxiously at all the food before he claimed the untouched bowl of vegetables.
“You can’t just come in here and do whatever you want.” Her face was turning a purple color. Seems she’s not used to being ignored.
“I’m not touching them. Do you know what kinds of diseases they can carry?” Thomas said, shuttering at the thought. Draco crossed his arms across his chest, nodding along with what Thomas was saying.
Max shrugged, “They were still coloring when I went to get my camera.” And sure enough, Isabelle and Mittsy were sat at the table, brightly colored utensils scattered across its surface. Isabelle’s tongue stuck out at an angle, her arm moved in wide arches pressing hard on a sheet of parchment.
He had already ordered the padding that was going to line the entire floor. The woman at the story had assured him that the padding would be filled with only the best and most comfortable material, foam. It would be the best sleep he's ever had or his galleon back, so she claimed. The low hanging lights laid scattered in the room waiting for their placement.
This all started when Jasmine threw a red reverse on the pile, forcing Draco to play the only red in his hand, a plus two.  He felt slightly bad for Max who was on the receiving end of this card, but in this game, he’d take no prisoners. But then Max also laid down a plus two, followed by Isabelle, and then Thomas.
Draco quickly drifted off to sleep, exhausted from the long day. He enjoyed a night uninterrupted by the usual nightmares.
Figuring the three older charges could look after themselves for a while, Draco went to grab a salve from his potion’s lab.
She recounted the times the Ministry ignored her letters, how understaffed they were, that more funding was needed, etc.
“Isabelle, swallow your food first before you speak, please.” An enthusiastic “Sorry!” was the response before more food was shoved in her mouth and another story told.
“Why does everyone think I have a hero complex? I’m just at the right place at the right time.” Harry said aspirated. Draco was about to argue the point when a shout interrupted him.
“Where have you been, we’ve been waiting for ages.” Isabelle said, bounding to Draco to grab his hand.
They were finally done. Max was the only one not resting on the grass. Instead, he’d was passing out water bottles to the exhausted group. When Mittsy turned up with the seven bottles Max immediately claimed the task of giving them out. He handed Draco one and smiled brightly at the head pat he received. That is until he realized there were only two bottles left, one for Harry and one for himself.
Jasmine and Thomas were the only two who heard the noise as Draco was too busy trying to placate a panicked Macy. She had latched onto his arm, bemoaning the kids absence.
The first thing Harry noticed when Mittsy motioned for him to enter the Manor was how gloomy it looked.  During his other visits the candles were bright and the rooms surprisingly welcoming.
I'm so sorry for such a late update life has been seriously busy lately but now hopefully my schedule will become more consistent. Thank you all for the comments and kudos, y'all are amazing as usual, and without further ado here's chapter six. Let me know what you think!
The five kids were already sitting at the table. Already eating, Draco noted glumly, they hadn’t even waited for him.
Back when blood purity was important, everyone thought that magic was hereditary. But then, muggle descendants showed signs of magic, so the hereditary link was debunked.
“I knew you would understand.” She took off both shoes and added the pair of boots to her pile. “OK I’m ready.”
“You guys are making me feel like it was a mistake.” Draco said feeling rebuffed, and slightly amused.
“Macy!” Draco practically shrieks, then in a more hushed tone, “How’d you even know that, your thirteen!”
He waved a wand at the candles to light up the way as he walked. When they arrived at the dining room, he just-about jumped a meter in the air when the light revealed a figure sitting at the table.
Draco laid in the center of the group, staring up at the dark ceiling. He knew none of the others were sleeping yet. On his left, Max lay snuggled into his side, but his breathing was too heavy for him to be asleep. Isabelle, tucked on his other side, kept shifting her hands and fingers around as if she was a conductor. Beside her, Macy toss and turned. Every now and then, Thomas would give her a nudge when her movements disturbed his sleep.  Jasmine might have been sleeping - if it wasn’t for her slight movements Draco could see out of the corner of his eye.
Mittsy directed Harry to a room where Max and Isabelle were lying across a plush looking sofa. Max's face was buried in the cushions while Isabelle’s head hung off the edge, her legs resting against the sofa’s back.
Draco made a face as he surveyed the mess they’d made. He guided Isabelle and Max to Luna, but before he could utter a word, Max spoke up.
The teen was laying on the bed, above the covers. He was tossing a small golden ball in the air, one that Draco immediately recognized as a golden snitch.
Their seats were arranged with a set of three facing another set of three, a retractable table between them. Isabelle immediately claimed a window seat, kneeling on the chair to stare out. Max sat in an aisle seat, afraid of getting sick by seeing the scenery as it blurred past them. Thomas took the other window seat and already had his eyes closed ready for a nap. Macy took the middle, still dazed from all the new stimuli. And once Jasmine finished asking questions about the train, she pulled out a book and began to read.
Much to Draco’s misery and to everyone else's amusement, the group didn’t split after the primate exhibit. Draco was ready to part ways after they traveled through the jungle habitat, but Potter bribed the children with ice cream, the prick. Although, Draco hadn’t put up much of a fuss; it was free, and it would help to cool them down after the sweltering jungle.
Using brown paint, he drew a circle where Potter's ocean was beginning to form. “There it’s looking better already.”
The small elf’s long ears perked upward; her left ear slightly higher than her right. She had a long, pointed nose that upturned at the tip and wore a green cashmere gown that fell to her calves. Her woolly socks covered most of her lower legs, and brown knitted hat with holes to accommodate her ears.
The laughter of children interrupted the young man’s reminiscing. This by itself was not unusual, but Draco recognized the certain tone in the sound. He had heard often enough with Death Eaters living in his house; cruelty.
What was Draco supposed to say to that, it’s okay, because no it wasn’t. I forgive you, because Draco had forgiven Potter the moment, he saved him from the fire, but Draco wasn’t sure if he was ready to say it out loud. And maybe that meant he hadn’t forgiven the other man at all.
His final image of the girl was of her beside the fence, watching him leave. Her short, dark hair swayed with the wind. Green eyes glistened from unshed tears, and her threadbare shirt hanging off a narrow shoulder. The sight emphasized how tiny she was.
They had a hard time waking up Isabelle and Max for them to walk through the Floo, but by some miracle it was done. Thomas, Jasmine, and Macy soon followed.
“What do you want from us?” Macy voiced, picking up on Thomas' uneasiness. As she tried, unsuccessfully, to shove her brother out of the way.
“Nothing. Your painting just looks a little dull. Why don’t we add some color? Draco threatened, brandishing his brush and moving to Harry’s area.
“It's not what they've done, but what they will do in the future. With this group it's only a matter of time," she said, tapping a finger to the side of her nose knowingly.
“It’s not fair but that is the truth. So, staying won't help your social standing but I’m offering a place to live free of abuse and suspicion that you all experienced.” He continued. “Now, once you all are finished with dessert, I’ll show you around the Manor.”
The blonde man reached for a random apron, he didn’t care all that much about his design. But Potter’s voice called for his attention.
“That's true, you don’t get a body like that if you exercise regularly,” Macy accused, eyes falling to Harry’s stomach and shook her head sadly.
“Malfoy let me. I’ve gotten pretty good with the Scourgify charm. I had to cast it plenty of times with Teddy when he goes outside to play.” The sight of Potter approaching them a wand drawn had Draco shaking from memories. The blonde shrunk in on himself clutching Isabelle against his chest, using his body to protect her.
“B-but,” she stuttered, looking up sadly at Draco. Looking around for something that could stop the impending tears, he saw a pair of trainers.
Max and Isabelle were curled up in the sheets, fast asleep. When a minute ago they’d both had been sitting up; Isabelle placing her butterfly hair bands, so tufts of Max’s ginger hair jutted out from his head. A hairstyle that the boy still sported; one of the butterflies making an indent in the boy’s freckled cheek.
He still remembered the reaction everyone had when it came out that Potter was one, and he was their Golden Boy.
Harry rolled his eyes at Draco’s dramatics, “That was your own fault. You should have just bowed to Buckbeak, before you approached him.”
“Draco?” Max called. The ginger looked imploringly at the older man and held up his palette. “I can’t get the color right, can you help?”
Jasmine tried to refuse a makeover, but Draco told her that if he had to be subject to this so did she. The other girl looked into Draco’s darkly outlined eyes, accentuated with a ‘smoky’ eye shadow. Then, to his painted lips, strawberry red, and gave in. But warned Macy from expecting the same when they were at school.
Draco made sure Max’s and Isabelle’s apron were tied correctly. Max chose one with different colored butterflies painted on and Isabelle’s had a monkey swinging from a branch.
So, all these people wanted to meet the Hero, Draco scoffed. Potter probably carried around a quill for this exact situation.
“I have to stay out of trouble to stay on the team. You, Max, and Isabelle are still coming to see the game, right? It’s a charity event this time around so you better come early to get a seat.” Thomas said, his expression honest and open.
Passing the library, a light caught his eye. There, sitting in one of the lounge chairs was Jasmine. In her hand was one of those old, cheesy romance novels that his mother snuck into the Manor behind Lucius’ back.
Little did they know that they’d soon experience the taste of betrayal because of this seemingly innocent game. The rules were fairly simple, so it wasn’t long before they were flying through rounds and the game was getting cutthroat.
“I think you all should go to bed, tomorrow the train leaves early.” Draco suggested, wary of the late hour.
As she did so, Draco's breath shuddered when he caught sight of the bruises, cuts, and burns on the small body. If the others had just as many wounds and scars, he’d need a second bowl of salve.
The journey was quite peaceful. And as they walked Draco felt his sadness from the past few days start to disperse.
He was already on thin ice with his senior officer when he’d spilt a cup of coffee on a stack of paperwork. His whole team had to stay late to redo all that work.
Harry startled at the proximity of the voice. Draco had walked silently up to the brunette’s side, eyes trained on the device at Harry’s ear. Giving the other man a look, Harry waved him away.
Giving up on Isabelle, Draco moved on to Max who was being equally as difficult. Where Isabelle refused to move, Max started to squirm when Draco got him in his arms.
“My parents got me a quidditch set on my 12th birthday. This was the only thing that I could bring with me when Macy and I were on the run. When the Aurors found us and figured out who we were we weren’t allowed to go back to our house for our belongings.” Thomas recalled and sat up, staring at his golden reflection in the shiny surface.
The next few hours were spent following their route moving in and out of different clothing stores. Only stopping at other shops if the kids found them interesting.
“Well they’re not hippogriffs but saving you from a pair of evil goats must get me some points, right?” Harry said, looks up at Draco a crooked smile plastered on his face. A smile that did funny things to Draco’s stomach.
And really that flash shouldn’t have brought the image of his school hood rival into the forefront of his mind. The stranger’s hair was darker blonde rather than the iconic white-blonde of the Malfoy’s.
Max tried to imitate Draco by attempting to eat his orange chicken with chopsticks but found the task too difficult and switched to a fork. Draco assured the boy that it took a while to master the utensils and that the more he practiced, the better he’d become. This managed to lift the boy’s spirit, and he continued with his meal happily.
Thomas also acquired a sketchpad, drawing pencils, charcoal, and two felt-tip pens, which an employee claimed all beginner artists needed. As the group left the arts and crafts store, Draco realized this was the most excited he'd ever seen the boy.
“Go ahead and find an apron,” Luna said, gesturing to the hooks along the back wall, where kid and adult sized aprons hung.
“I’m not your babysitter, Draco. I was in an important meeting with the Minister of Magic. You might have heard of him before.” Harry hissed, turning to leave but Draco’s fingers on his shoulder stopped him.
Sure, he had some strange infatuation with a younger Harry and he’d be the first to admit he handled those feelings badly. Who knew that making fun of someone and their friends wasn’t the correct way to woo someone.
“Hold your brush like this and you can get the same texture.” Potter demonstrated, correcting Isabelle’s finger positions. “All it takes is some practice and you’ll be a pro. Luck for me, I’m friends with an artist, so I know all the tricks.”
All three say they are doing well. They've seen some discrimination, but nothing all that surprising according to Thomas. Macy made a new friend, Summer, a pure-blood Hufflepuff that doesn't have many friends in the house because of her blood status.  An upcoming project in Care of Magical Creatures has Jasmine ecstatic. While, Thomas is counting the days until Quidditch tryouts begin to become a chaser.
“Oh, you think that’s funny?” Jasmine frowned, launching one of her pillows at Macy, who caught it, using it to smack the blonde girl.
“Don’t you guys want to see the animals?” Harry asked. Then laughed at the identical looks of disgust he received from the two Slytherins.
“Everyone. Mrs. Tally said that if the Ministry hadn’t force her to take us in she would've kick us out. And that we were evil like our parents.” She scrubbed at the tears beginning to form. “All the kids call us Death Eaters and push us around.”
“Nowhere important. Now let’s-” he was cut off by a shout of “Malfoy” from behind him. Harry stood there panting for air, a hand resting against the door frame.
“Or if you need someone to buffer your exposure to Macy you can call on me.” Thomas said, pushing Macy’s head out of the way so he could see Jasmine.
“No.” They guiltily answered Luna. Her disruption ended the argument between the two for a limited time.
The vocal encouragements from the boy grabbed the attention of another goat and the animal began to loudly bleat at Thomas.
“That used to be my mother’s favorite novel.” Draco spoke up, nodding to the book in her hand. Which Jasmine set aside as the older man sat in the chair across her, obviously he wasn't leaving anytime soon.
When he appeared in the Manor, his potions room was his first stop. The potion had turned a murky grey color from overheating. Draco sighed seeing this, the mixture was a lost cause. He bemoaned the three months of wasted work as he vanished the contents of the cauldron. Tomorrow he had to start all over.
“Yes, I have been busy. As I see, so have you.” Snape said, eyes trained over Draco’s shoulder with a raised eyebrow.
Thomas strode to his sister’s side, standing protectively beside her. He grasped her upper arm, offering the little comfort he could to the upset girl.
An insistent tugging of his hair dragged Draco unwilling out of his slumber. He laid face down on a pillow, a weight pressed on his upper back. His groggy mind slow to process the reason he was in that uncomfortable position. Before remembering the previous night.
“Hi, Mittsy.” Max said. Taking Draco’s hand, Max pulled him to the other side of the table revealing dozens of polaroid pictures spread out on the floor. Max sat in front of them and shifted through the images.
Draco tried to keep his voice low and steady to lull them all to sleep, but Max interrupted him with a question.
“Don’t worry. By the time I’m done with your hair, everyone will be treating you like the princess you are,” he said with a small smile.
Draco decided that he has grown up and would probably continue to grow as a person, so it was time to show the world that change. That he was no longer letting the war, or his past mistakes hold him back. He was done regretting and feeling sorry for himself. It was time to move on and live his life in his way; not the way of his parents or that of a madman.
An alarm blaring in Draco's ear woke the man up the next day. This wasn't his regular alarm. No, something had breached the wards of the manor.
Draco stabbed at his melting strawberry flavored ice cream, angry that it couldn’t solve his problems. He was about to suggest they go home when the hairs on the back of his neck rose to attention and a shiver ran down his back.
Mittsy was no help. In fact, she was an enabler. The elf would say things like, “Master Draco’s guests be so good,” while patting one of the kids on the arm or “Mittsy be so happy that you all enjoy the food Mittsy made special. Master Draco be always so proper.”
“Thank you,” Jasmine said, walking to the other kids. Macy was waving them over, pointing excitedly to a poster that pictured dolphins jumping into the sea. The next show was starting soon.
But McClain called through the door, “Mr. Malfoy, please. As part of the release deal, your place of residence is susceptible to random inspections for dark magic.”
The kids were already in the tea room when he arrived. Thomas had placed himself in front of the others, eyeing the Aurors with suspicion.
“Who do you think-” She choked off with a look from Draco, who walked past her and went to Macy. She turned her head, eyes avoiding Draco’s own. He gently took her chin in his hand to move her face into better lighting. He tutted in sympathy.
Draco stayed around to make sure that the spell was cast. Before saying his goodbyes to the three. Giving each a hug. “Please stay out of trouble all of you. I’m not sure how many times the ‘I will sue you’ play will work on McGonagall.”
“I want to hang some of these with my painting, but I don’t know which ones to use.” Max explained the situation to Draco.
And that brings us here, Draco staring at Potter, who once again stood at his door, arms crossed and sans Auror robes.
“How could you run a school like this?” A high nasally voice said as Draco approached the doors, “I want these vermin out this instant. Look at what they did to my girl.”
“Impossible. Potter hated me.” Draco argued, his tone dark as he thought back to a cold, wet bathroom.
“Nothing.” Draco said, starting to walk to the building. Thomas acts so mature sometimes that Draco has a hard time remembering that he’s only fifteen.
"Luna says that if too much magic builds up around you it clogs the flow of creativity. Hence, the magic free zone." Harry said.
Walking back to the group, Draco noticed that the kids were getting strange looks from the other bystanders. Their stares taking in the unusual robes and the unrestrained wonderment on the children's face as they watched the bright screens that lined the wall.
When they had finally claimed a cluster of seats on the busy train, Thomas withdrew something from his pocket and slammed it on the table in front of everyone. He removed the hand, revealing a colorful stack of cards that had
Draco pulled up the covers to the boy's chin, tucking him in. Both said goodnight to each other before Draco walked out, leaving the door open upon request.
Merlin, he was bored. He averted his eyes, so that the living room was now within his line of sight just past the large, open wooden doors.
“When I was in school, my friends had me cut their hair. We were the best-looking kids of our year,” he said. His voice growing softer as he reminisced on the days before the war. He finished the cut in silence.
The teenagers seemed to have less injuries compared to Max and Isabelle. He assumed it was because the older children fought back while the youngest only defense was to hide from their tormentors.
“Well, I’m done talking to you.” Draco called back, picking up the pace. Hopefully, Boy Wonder would get lost then eventually leave or get kicked out but Mittsy.
The two stepped down the stairs toward the kitchen to make some warm milk. The beverage always helped calm him down as a child.
Not expecting this, the bottle hit the man in the chest with a thud and the sound of air leaving his lungs forcible. There was a moment of silence before Draco fell back to the floor laughing.
Just to prove Harry wrong, Thomas marched up to a group of rabbits hopping happily around and picked one up. He held the floppy eared creature away from his body, already regretting his rash decision as the rabbit squirmed in his hands.
Blinking at the exchange with Luna, Draco turned, and it wasn't hard to spot his group. Potter stood at the center of a crowd. He looked out of place shifting from foot to foot, a hand scratching the back of his neck as he accepted a canvas from a short man. Max and Isabelle were peeking out from behind the brunette's legs.
Her leg kicked out, sending a stone skittering across the ground. She reluctantly led Draco out of the alley, her shoulders slumped weighted down with disappointment. A long stretch of silence fell as they walked hand-in-hand along the pavement.
A bright light coming from Draco’s left distracted him from locating Jasmine. The room was completely dark room except for a cylindrical tank full of glowing jellyfish, floating lazily around.
Max didn’t have many fresh cuts or bruises, Draco figured the kid kept quiet, so the bullies hadn't noticed him. But, a plethora of scars laid across his limbs and trunk.
He was meet with the face of the little girl from the other day. Isabelle smiled cheerfully, her dark hair flowed down past her shoulders. No last name was given in the document. She was only five years old.
Cuts adorned the girl’s hands from their rough meeting with the ground. They were likely caused by a rough meeting with the ground. One of the boys forced her head upward by grasping a handful of her long, dark hair and giving it a jerk. A pair of scissors glinted viciously in his other hand.
“Go on in then,” Draco prompted, giving her arm a gentle push to spur her on. Her hold tightened once more before loosening, then letting go completely.
Draco watched as Thomas picked at a loose string on his pajama pants. Macy’s eyelids drooped, only a barrage of rapid blinking kept them from closing completely. While, Jasmine took her sweet time removing the makeup on her face. A strange sort of energy surrounded the three when Draco had brought up their trip the next day.
“My Aunt Andromeda got her name from this constellation,” he said, tracing the outline of princess Andromeda. “It’s also called the Chained Maiden, since the princess was chained as a sacrifice for her mother’s boasting. Luckily, a young hero came along to rescue her.”
“There's nothing to worry about. Muggles may be inferior to our kind, every now and then they get somethings right, like clothing.”
“Thank you,” Maximus responded quietly, giving the man a small smile and disappeared into his new room.
After breakfast, everyone dressed in their ragged robes. Then, headed toward the closest train station, where Draco bought six tickets for a trip to London.
“Don’t say that!” Draco snapped. “Just let go of my arm Macy.” He said trying with little success to shake her off.
Potter’s eyes finally fell on Draco, green eyes like acid, “Malfoy, that’s none of- What are you wearing?”
As the oldest of the five kids, he was charged to watch the rest of them until Draco walked through. The tall boy grabbed a fistful of green powder from the obsidian vase that rested atop the fireplace mantel. He walked into the fireplace and with a confidant voice said, “The Sanctuary of Helvellyn.” At the declaration, Thomas threw the Floo powder at his feet producing green flames which consumed him.
He paused before saying, “If you really want my advice, I’d say don’t bother. It’s lonely and stressful at the top. There are only a few people that you’ll be able to trust. You don’t know the number of times I wished I’d just enjoyed my time at school without all the pressure to be the biggest and baddest. It’s not worth it,”
Please, Harry. Thomas wrote from Hogwarts and something’s wrong. You’re the only one I trust to watch Max and Isabelle when I’m gone.”
Thomas started to make fake whipping noises. To get him to cut it out Draco hissed, “This is your fault for tell them what a date was!”
“Draco?” she croaked, lower lip trembling. He sat up and pulled her toward him as soon as he saw this.
Pursing his lips, Draco gave in. “I wouldn’t know. Potter and I weren’t exactly friends. But it would make sense, he had an uncanny ability of finding me anywhere and avoiding trouble with the professors.” He mused with a thoughtful expression.
“Luna,” he amended, “we really did make a mess and used up a lot of paint. Let me clean and pay for it.”
“There’s no need. I trust you, Mr. Humphrey. I’m sure there isn’t another soul who’d want to take these kids. I’ll go get them right now,” she said, giving him a wink on the way out.
Draco followed Potter apprehensively checking that Isabelle and Max hadn’t wandered to far from his side. The brunette lead them through a hill range. Where patches of small flowers were the only interruption of the solid green grass.
“Draco.” Jasmine says in greeting, not looking at the other and continued to take photos of the jellyfish.
Draco felt a tug on his hand, where Isabelle was pulling on his fingers. “Are they being mean? She asked worriedly, before he could give an answer, she was yelling at the Aurors.
A throat cleared, “Gentlemen, I don’t see you painting. Do you need some assistance?" Luna said, watching the two with a careful look.
Currently, the dark-haired girl had her eclectic collection of nail polish scattered across the floor. Her expression focused as she contemplated the small vials in front of her. Isabelle already had her nails done with a polish that allowed the color to change with her mood. Macy had commandeered Draco’s hand and was trying to decide which color would fit best on the man’s nails.
A month passed and the mood in the Manor had lifted considerably. Laughter and excited chatter could be heard from the kitchen where Draco stood with his two assistants, Max and Isabelle. They stood on chairs, so they could reach the countertop.
“We’ll use these to build a makeshift mattress to sleep on?” Jasmine asked. At Draco’s nod, she walked over to the pile and pulled out a single pillow. Throwing it to the side, she said, “I call being on one edge. I need room, so I can sleep.”
Stares and whispers followed them as they approached the train's entrance. Draco couldn’t hear what was being said but he couldn’t imagine it was anything good.
This hung heavy in the air, Thomas kept his eyes trained on his lap thinking over what was said. The golden snitch kept drawing Draco's attention, with a flash of gold or a fluttering of wings near his ear.
Draco wasn’t having a good night’s sleep. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw an image of He-Who-Should-Not-Be-Named, Voldemort Draco cursed himself. He’s dead, despite the phantom pain he felt on his left forearm during nights like this; he shouldn't be afraid anymore. The grisly man would always have Nagini coiled around his feet and remained silent. He’d look down at Draco from his perch and lift a single finger.
“For that, I'm proposing Code Insomniac. If any of us are having a particularly bad night or if you don’t feel like sleeping alone, call a Code Insomniac. Mittsy will gather us, along with all the pillows and blankets in the house so we can sleep down here.”
"Make sure you wear something comfortable. We'll have quite a walk to get to Luna's place." Harry called after them.
The Nitwiker siblings could no longer contain their snickers as Mittsy told the tale of Draco's stuffed kneazle. The man ignored the two, he hadn't played with Mr. Fuzzles since first year. Besides he refused to feel embarrassed when he was the only one who knew when to use the utensils.
The girl taught the two males a game involved in slapping their hands together in a rhythm. Max picked up on the game quickly, enjoying the repetitive motions and the rhyming lyrics. Draco did not, however.
“Potter, what are you doing here?” Draco asked, eyes narrowing in suspicion of the other man’s sudden appearance.
Draco helped Max and Isabelle with their bags, levitating the clothes as the children carried their toys. Both refused to allow their brand-new playthings out of their hands. He set Max’s bags outside the door, so he could stash Isabelle’s clothes in her wardrobe first. Max simply continued to his room to find a place for his dragons.
A red blur appeared in Draco’s vision as the boy leaned over the man’s shoulder to deliver an apology on Isabelle’s behalf.
“Jasmine, Thomas, and Macy left for Hogwarts the other day and well...” Draco let the sentence drift off, gesturing toward Max and Isabelle.
When the children noticed Draco approaching, they broke away from Potter and ran to the other’s side.
Facing the three, Draco said, “You all stay safe, and if there is anything you need send me a message. I’ll make sure you get it. Also, wear warm clothes around the castle. Trust me, the common rooms may be warm, but the halls always seemed to have chill.” Draco took a breath ready to continue but the first warning whistle sounded cutting him off.
He rested a hand on top of her head. “Call me Draco, Kiki. If you're going to live here, it’d be best if we got rid of the mister title,” he said, then looked up at the other four.
Once everyone had found nine to ten casual outfits, some formal clothing, and several sets of pajamas, they called the trip a success. Even Draco couldn't resist the temptation, getting several articles of clothing for himself. Shoving their shrunken purchases into their pockets, the group headed to the food court for an early dinner.
“I’m not even going to bother answering that question.” Draco said, leading the kids to the rapidly depleting seats. The room had begun to fill whilst their backs were turned.
And thus, began an epic tug-of-war battle between Draco and the goat. One trying to avoid ripping the cloth; the other looking for a snack.
The train started to move with Macy still sticking out of the window. Draco’s relaxed wave turned into gestures to get her back inside, cupping his other hand to his mouth to call out to her. She didn’t seem to hear him but luckily the two teens behind her dragged her back in.
Max and Isabelle loved the toy store. Isabelle ran around pulling stuffed animals off the shelves while Max examined the dragon figurines. He chose five of his favorites and carried them around in his arms until it was time to purchase them.
“No, sorry that wasn’t meant for you Luna, but I do have a favor to ask. Do you have room in your next session for two adults and two children?”
Max clapped his hands and stared in awe, like Draco had cured the young girl of a horrid ailment. Macy let out an explosive laugh, head bent back. Jasmine tried to contain her own giggles with a fist placed at her mouth. Draco even managed to spot a quick smile cross Thomas’ face.
An idea began to form in Harry’s mind as he surveyed the despondent family. He pulled out his mobile to dial the number of a good friend.
As they found their seats, Jasmine asked Draco how the train worked because she hadn’t seen a chimney for the steam.
“I’m a huge fan Mr. Potter and I am so grateful to you and your friends.” The man gushed using a handkerchief to dab at his forehead. Harry signed his name on the painting with a quill and handed it back to the man.
“I should tell you that one of the adults is Draco Malfoy.” Harry hesitantly said. Keeping his voice low so his words wouldn’t reach the man now sat with the kids on the sofa.
The redhead nodded and held his photos close to his chest. Before the rest could be gathered, a small hand pointed to a photo. The photo was taken from behind as Isabelle and Jasmine walked through the gardens, flowers of all colors in full bloom around them.
Draco took the spot beside the boy amazed at the number of photos around them. Max had taken pictures of everyone.
“Well,” Draco started, enjoying the way both Macy and Thomas leaned forward to catch his every word. Merlin, he missed being the center of attention, “it’s because I’m a Malfoy,” he finished.
Macy scrambled toward the shelves, the others followed at a more subdued pace. Draco stayed with the two youngest, herding them into the kids’ section.
“I’ve known you for almost nine years, I don’t think I have to ask permission, Draco. You can even call me Harry if you want.” Potter said, following behind Draco.
“It shouldn’t even have been around teenagers if it is that easy to provoke.” Draco threw out, face flushed.
He pushed the double doors open with enough force that that smacked the opposite wall with a loud bang. A crowd stood in the middle of the room. A thin, blonde woman had an arm wrapped around a dark-haired girl whose eyes were down cast. A row of scratches decorated her cheek. Madam Pomphrey and Headmistress McGonagall were there as well.
“Do you know how hard it is to draw with a quill?” Thomas questioned when asked about it his bag, now full of materials, clutched close to his chest. “These muggle inventions called ‘pencils’ are amazing.”
The cart came to a stop at the bottom of the mountain and a disembodied voice warned of the slight step to the ground. Draco gratefully set foot back on solid land.
“This potion is amazing. I can’t even feel this.” She said, while poking at an unusually large bruise on her shoulder.
“I don’t want to go back.” Jasmine’s voice was quiet and hesitant, like she was unsure if she should be sharing this secret. Nonetheless her soft-spoken words were heard by everyone in the room. “I know that sounds stupid, but I don’t have many friends. None that I can really talk to at least.”
“What’s a date?” Isabelle asks Thomas, who answers the girl saying. “It’s when two people want to get to know one another better, so they go out to places. Like the forbidden forest or the owlery.
Mittsy had gone overboard with the cooking, Draco mused fingers pressed to the bridge of his nose. It was clear from the display that she'd missed the extravagant socials the Malfoy’s would host.
Draco reprimanded her on cleanliness and how the petting zoo was not the place to play in the mud. Isabelle nodded in understanding not looking abashed in the slightest. Harry then comes sauntering up, holding Teddy in one arm and in the other hand was his wand.
When he had rented the apartment already fully furnished, he had planned to replace everything with new furniture, but as time passed, he had less and less motivation to do so. And now he was content with the old, ugly pieces that decorated his place. Harry spent most of his time at the office anyway.
During the show, Jasmine pulled out a small notebook to take notes on the aquatic mammal. But, soon realized that she couldn’t take notes and take pictures at the same time.
The room was set into the side of a mountain showing off a perfect view of the Sanctuary below. Large domes could be seen caused by spells that preserve the biomes within. Keeping the climate as close to the creature’s natural environment would be. From where they stood, the people below were nothing but tiny specs moving throughout the zoo.
The day started abruptly for the new occupants of the Malfoy Manor. They were awoken by a certain blonde-haired man with a wand pressed to his neck and a
He took a shower of his own and left methodical instructions on how to wash the mud splattered clothes for Mittsy. Although, he suspects that his clothes won’t be salvageable.
“Really Potter, if you can’t keep up you’re welcome to sit out or better yet leave but stop distracting my kids.” Draco said before continuing to the next pose.
This wasn’t what Harry expected when he decided to come bother Draco that day. Maybe some eye rolling and sarcasm, definitely yelling, but not this.
Draco then, dried and combed Max’s hair while the boy brushed his teeth. Once done, the two found themselves on the bed.
Thomas waved him off. “I don’t need it. Not many people felt like messing with me once they caught sight of me. The few scuffles I did get into were to defend Macy, but they soon knew better and left her alone.”
Draco placed his favorite last. Taking up the space above the fireplace, where a portrait of Draco and his parents was once displayed. The oil painting hadn't survived the Death Eater's occupation of the manor, destroyed during one of Grayback's fits of rage.
“Handler? Don’t you Aurors have more important things to do then bother me, like I don’t know catching actual criminals.”
Draco watched the scene unfold, amazed at how fast the five accepted his idea. A pillow smacking him in the face interrupted his thoughts. The unexpectedness of the attack caused him to stumble back a few steps.  Looking up, he saw Thomas with a satisfied smirk on his face and a hand fisted on his hip.
“Draco, they have to come with us! I promised Teddy that I would show him the monkeys, I can’t break a promise.” Isabelle whined.
Before Draco could defend himself, he felt a tug on his sleeve. A goat had started to chew on his expensive, silk shirt.
Tilting his head back and forth, Draco let out a sigh. No matter the angle his clouds somehow always resembled a certain part of the male anatomy.
put it on me.” Isabelle said with enough attitude that Draco knew he was not forgiven from their argument.
Even Draco’s own magic sprouted when his mother found the young boy in his room surrounded by rabbits. It took days to extract all the creatures from the Manor and to release them into the wild, with a very tearful Draco. Weeks after that Lucius would continue to find a bunny in his sock drawer nibbling holes in the material.
On the trek back to the lift, Isabelle managed to fall asleep on Draco’s chest despite his movements jostling her body.  It wasn’t long after, that Draco noticed Max was lagging. Draco’s arm reaching farther and farther back due to their connected hands.
He waved his wand, levitating the dropped item and held a hand out, waiting for a small hand to slip in his.
By the time the older man realized they had company Max had managed to climb over his shoulder and was clinging on to the fabric on his back. The boy was able to dodge every twist Draco preformed to grab at him.
Draco entered Hogwarts through the front doors with no obstructions. He strode straight to the hospital wing, still knowing the way perfectly.
The man stood at the clear dismissal and waited for some type of gratitude. Receiving none, he turned on his heel, muttering about the rude behavior of teenagers.
“Now come on. My house elf has dinner ready for us and I’m hungry. We can discuss your plans there.” With that, Draco scooped Isabelle up and set her on a hip. He offered his free hand to Max; who hesitated at first, but soon grasped Draco’s hand in his own.
Heaps of food were currently occupying the Malfoy’s mahogany dining table. It was an array that would rival Hogwarts first day dinner.
Draco was glad that the boy was coming out of his shell and finding his own interest. Seeing Thomas’ happiness, caused a swell of happiness of his own. “Wouldn’t miss it for the world. I better be on the way before Harry burns down our house. And next time please tell me if someone is harassing you. That way I can deal with them before you are hurt.”
Macy and Thomas chose rooms on the first floor. Thomas explained, quite unnecessarily, that he wanted the room farthest from Draco, and Macy followed to stay close to her brother. Jasmine decided to claim the room that was closest to the library.
No one dared to move as they waited for Draco’s reaction. Using a clean brush, Draco scooped up a glob of blue paint.
The women’s giggles were beginning to hit a pitch that only dog could hear, grating on Draco’s nerves.
“Good, because today we need to go shopping,” Draco informed them as he cast a hot air charm on Thomas, drying him. “You all are in dire need of new clothes. The ones the Ministry gave you should be burned. I will not have anyone that’s staying with me wearing such things.”
Thomas punched Draco’s shoulder lightly, “Take good care of Max and Isabelle. Remember they need three meals a day.”
Thomas Franklin Nitwiker was fifteen years old and taller than Draco, if the record was to be trusted. As his eyes continued to skim the page, a splurge of text caught his attention:
“I don’t mind,” he claimed. The three walked toward the exit where Thomas, Jasmine, and Macy gathered.
Outnumbered, Draco resignedly said, “Fine, let’s go to the monkeys. But then we part ways, Potter.” A finger pointing at said person’s chest.
The previous injuries had healed nicely over the summer thanks to Draco’s ointment and everyone keeping an eye out for Max’s anxiety. To try to curb the harming habit before the redhead started it. Now, all that there were ragged white scars on his arm.
“Absolutely not! You can't interrogate a minor without their guardian present. And as I am their guardian,” Draco left the statement open, letting the others fill in the blank.
“Potter, then.” Draco snickered at that. Harry jabbed an elbow to the blonde's side, only for him to dodge the appendage as he had anticipated the move. “Are you really able speak Parseltongue?”
Which was a goddamn lie, with how Potter’s shirt hugged his arms and torso, the Auror had one amazing body. At least to Draco’s expert eye.
“What the hell Malfoy,” Harry gasped rubbing his chest, “Are you training them to be prats like you?”
“First, you don’t have to pay for anything. My friends don’t pay. Second, don’t worry about the mess. I’m sure the Nargles will take care of it.” She then left before Draco could argue his point more.
There was no one left to fear. He couldn’t change his past, but he can choose how to live in the present. So, he had better make each decision count.
But he still tried to go back to sleep. Draco was drifting between awake and asleep when he heard the door creak open. The light from the hall fell across his eyelids.
Frank Hawkes was a big, muscular man who easily towered over people. In Draco's opinion, his most undesirable trait was his avid believe of the old ways. Men were the money makers and women were homemakers.
“You don’t need to apologize, Jasmine. If anything, it’s the adults who created this system that should apologize.” Thomas passionately said, sitting up once more to deliver his speech.
Thomas showed interest in the outdoor broom closet, as the tour continued. Draco had great fun watching Thomas' face as he detailed the brooms located within. He only had the latest and fastest brooms one could find on the market.
But those feelings were long gone. Left behind somewhere between Voldemort returning and fleeing Hogwarts. There’s just no time for such childish desires when you’re trying to survive. Maybe they were caused from over exposure to Potter. Whatever it was, it had to be Potter’s fault.
At the door, Draco glanced back at the woods that now seemed less sinister at this distance. He entered the manor, while shaking his head to clear it, only to find a stripped-down Isabelle.
“Let’s go in there!” She was pointing at a building that had all kinds of fish magicked to swim around the front. Every now and then, a shark would appear and try to swallow the door leading within.
And when she wasn’t complementing their appalling behavior, she would tell stories from Draco's childhood.
“I was declared innocent. You do remember, right Potter? You were there after all.” Draco grounded out, teeth clenched. Harry was at a loss of words at that, so Draco continued, “So unless you’re here to arrest me I want you both off my property.” Then slammed the door shut.
Upon exiting the building, the issue of travel cropped up. He couldn’t side-along all these kids without leaving some behind. Nor could they apparate on their own.
“Are you kidding me?’ Draco asked, the painting once more in his possession, “Do you know how much I could sell this for now?”
“Now, I’m going to need you to stop crying and sit still. So, I fix what those horrid children have done,” Draco said, twirling the scissors around a finger.
Draco flinched from the volume, he hoped that it wouldn’t draw any attention to them. Pulling his hood to cover his face once he was sure they had no witnesses.
“I want to stay here. Draco’s my friend.” A chocolate covered Isabelle declared a hand in the air, fingers splayed.
“You know it’s common for those of both sexes to preen while looking for a partner. There’s no reason to be embarrassed.”  Jasmine interjects, Draco stares at her, eyes wide.
Draco shrugged. The Malfoy fortune was vast. He could buy everything in the mall, including the mall itself, and still have enough to buy out ten others. The many properties and stocks he owned around the world continued to thrive, despite the war.
“You all will be staying in my wing of the Manor. I suggest you avoid the east and west wings,” Draco says gestured down the aforementioned parts of the Manor. “I haven’t gotten them renovated yet, so they’re still dark and cold. And the portraits refuse to be reasoned with.”
“You’re in good hands. I have been cutting my own hair since I was twelve. My mother took me to the hairdresser once and they destroyed my hair. Let me tell you, little princess, my father heard about it when I got home. Now, I'm the only one that can touch my precious locks,” Draco said conspiratorially as he started to fix up her hair.
“Look Malfoy, Terrence may have been fooled by your whole innocent act but I’m not!” The brunette hadn't looked at the other, instead inspected the engravings on the door frame.
Max looked dead on his feet, swaying side to side with eyes half shut. Jasmine inspected the mound of blankets and pillows with interest; Thomas looked mad.
Terrence McClain was an older man, skin worn and wrinkled, his spine curved with age. His voice crackled like that of burning wood from smoking for most of his life.
Draco marched to his wardrobe his mind going a mile a minute. He needed t get to Hogwarts fast, but he couldn’t leave Max and Isabella alone. The two children trailed behind him their expressions mirroring his own worried one.
“It’s some weird muggle thing called Elekricity.” He declared with confidence, proud that he knew the answer despite mispronouncing the foreign word.
“Thank you, Luna.” Harry said with a smile. He would forever admire Luna’s ability to forgive those who’d had wronged her.
It was a whirlwind month that passed by quicker then they’d all expected. Twas the night before the three teenagers were due to leave for Hogwarts and they were wide awake.
“Stop following me, Potter!” Draco hissed, when he saw that Harry had also exited the petting zoo, Teddy nestled in his arms.
Max is around the age of his awakening, Draco would need to look out for the signs. He will also need to look for some good training material for the two.
“And why did you fight with your fists? You’re a witch – please tell me this isn’t a habit you picked up from Potter.” He directs at Macy, missing the eyebrow arch from McGonagall.
Draco was hesitant to read the additional information on the page. After reading about the Nitwikers, he felt like he was invading the children's privacy. But he'd need the information to better understand these children. Though with what he’d learned already, Draco may need to find them all a therapist.
“Ok, I’ll watch them.” Harry gave Draco a once over. He straightened, looking puzzled. “You look nice?”
The girl’s eyes were frantic as they searched for any form of help, until they met with his grey ones.
“Come on guys let’s go back home.” He told Max and Isabelle, who did so without a word. Draco sighed as he led the two children, already forming a second plan to cheer them up. Hopefully, the next one would work.
“Well then, do you have any favorites?” The boy took his time to contemplate the group of photos, before placing his chosen four in hand.
At a closer look at the girl, it was plain that her eyes weren't as green as Potter’s. But they were no less stunning. He pushed that thought aside, ignoring the word he used to describe his old rival’s eyes. It wasn't the time to resurrect past feelings.
He tucked Isabelle into bed when he was sure every cut and bruise was looked after.  The exhausted girl was asleep before her head hits the pillow.
“You are kidding, right?” Thomas blurts out as Draco lifted his fork to his lips now heaped with warm cake. “Your family is one of the, if not the most, well-known supporters of He-Who-Should-Not-Be-Named. And you think by staying here our situation will improve?”
Draco yanked out a handkerchief from his robe pocket and brandished it dramatically, causing Isabelle to laugh.  He then took her hands into his before gently wiping them clean.
Jasmine's sarcastically remarked that they could use the Floo. Which would have been a great solution if they were actually heading to the Ministry. But since they weren’t, the group was forced to walk.
“As much as I’d love to continue our usual banter. I’m in a hurry. I need you to watch Max and Isabelle while I’m gone.” Draco said, expression serious.
“Good lord,” Draco gasped and marched over to them, “Isabelle you’d better get out of that puddle immediately.”
“I had no idea that it was that bad for the Slytherins. There have been people bad-mouthing your house, but I thought it was all harmless talk. I’m so sorry, Macy.” Jasmine said, sadness and regret coloring her tone.
“Wow, I want to try talking to the snakes!” Isabelle said, running off to a glass panel to ‘talk’ to the snake within.
Now the thing about Harry is that he had come to terms with the fact that he likes the company of both men and women. And since his relationship with Ginny never went anywhere, he’s been able to explore his options. So, he is comfortable admitting when he finds someone attractive.
It would be impossible for the six of them to finish all the food at the table. Although, the way the kids were eyeing the buffet there was little doubt they'd try their best to tuck away every morsel.
As he laid in bed that night his mind drifted from thought to thought. But as sleep was about to consume him Isabelle sprang into his mind. She was standing alone, waiting. Draco drifted off to sleep before he could delve deeper into that image.
Only a few steps in and Harry was already questioning his decision on coming here. He was trying to decide if he should leave and find something else to relieve his boredom.
At the reptile enclosure, Isabelle was once more brimming with excitement for the snakes. Max stayed close to Draco or Harry, uncomfortable with the thought of slithering creatures surrounding them. Macy, Thomas, and Draco didn’t mind so much it was their house animal.
