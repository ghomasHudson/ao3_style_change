“Thanks,” he said, downing the contents and shaking his head a little as the potion began to take effect. “How’d you make it taste good? The ones from the infirmary at Hogwarts always taste gross.”
Harry looked away, an unknown feeling bubbling up inside of him. He had a sneaking suspicion about what was going on with him.
How had Harry forgotten it was Halloween? The room was bedecked with grinning, floating pumpkins, and the ghosts flew up and down the aisles. Harry saw the Bloody Baron stab a student with his see-through sword, and cackle as the student turned and berated him for it. Bats fluttered amongst the rafters, and the false sky was dark and cloudy, with a full moon shining between the grey wisps of cloud. Candles were dispersed amongst the pumpkins, and Harry spotted skeletons jerkily moving on the sides of the room. The tables were groaning with rich food, and the three of them hastened to the eighth year table to sit and eat.
“Bloody Finnegan.” he muttered mutinously, downing the potion and barely stopping himself from gagging. It does help his head, though, he admitted to himself grudgingly.
Harry snorted and Hermione rolled her eyes with a smile, Ron’s comment having diffused the tension a bit.
“Hey, Buckbeak.” Hagrid boomed, tossing a dead ferret into the air. Buckbeak snapped it up and Harry’s eyes travel over the sharp yellow eyes, the blue-grey feathers, the clawed feet. He remembered the wonderful free sensation of flying astride Buckbeak and grinned.
“He’ll be alright.” said Ron, sounding as though he was trying to convince himself as much as he was Draco. He was sitting in a chair next to Draco, watching Harry. Draco didn’t say anything.
“Yeah.” responded Draco, repeating the spell on one of his own bags before storing all the others inside of it, so he only had to carry one. Harry copied him and soon they set off to the carriage station.
And then an arm was wrapped tightly around his middle, halting his drop barely twenty feet above the grassy ground of the pitch. Harry.
Draco stood and walked up the stairs to their dorm, sprawling on his bed as he watches Potter enter the room after him and shut the door.
But maybe that could change, mused Draco. Maybe they could be friends. He glanced over at Weasley-no, Ron, and Hermione. Then Harry, still holding his hand beneath the table. His Harry. His messy-haired, green-eyed, sweet, brave, boyfriend.
“Potter,” sniffed Pansy, eyeing him like she thought he was going to throw something at her, “What have we done to earn the privilege of your presence, exactly?”
“It’s a waste of time,” he said flatly, turning his quill between his fingers. Draco knew he was frustrated and sore that he hadn’t gotten the spell down yet, and tried not take it out on Harry. Harry sighed.
“I don’t really know what I’m doing either,” he said. Damn! There he went again, slipping up and talking about how he feels. His parents would be utterly disappointed if they knew the events of the past day or two.
Harry was studying Draco’s face, and Draco fidgeted. “You’re not telling me something.” said Harry softly. Draco sighed. Of course the other boy could read him.
He rematerialized at Platform 9 ¾, which was full of blueish steam from the train. Students and parents were everywhere, and he sidled on the brick wall trying to be inconspicuous, waiting for Andromeda, and looking for Ron and Hermione in the crowd.
“Yes,” he began. “Thanks for meeting me, Professor Sudi.” he added hastily. The professor smiled but motioned for him to go on. “I was wondering if it was possible to imbue an object with a Healing spell? Like, for instance, let’s say the patient has severe panic attacks. Could we imbue a small trinket with a spell that would help during those panic attacks, maybe like if they held it it would activate the spell?”
“I’m right here, Potter.” Draco said scathingly, and Potter shot him a look that said quite plainly, Sorry but I need you to shut up right now. Draco rolled his eyes but complied, silently cursing Potter as he did. Why couldn’t he ever say no to this boy? Oh, right. Because he’s bloody attractive and his eyes take your breath away, Draco sung inside his head, before squashing the thought. No, that’s not a good thing, he said in his mind. Bad thing. Very bad thing. With some effort, Draco pulled himself back to the present and is able to catch some snippets of conversation from where Weasley, Potter, and Hermione are sequestered at the other side of the common room, furiously whispering.
“I think it’ll be good for you. Lord knows you deserve a break.” she replied with a wry smile. Ron made a noise of agreement, now enthusiastically cutting into a piece of chicken.
Dean and Neville left, and Draco sat on his bed before pulling up his left sleeve, and Harry almost gasped.
“I never met him, but I had a lot to do with his Sorcerer’s Stone.” responded Harry with amusement. “Why?”
But when he had seen Malfoy by the carriages, and when he bumped into him, Malfoy hadn’t been insulting or rude or sneering. He’d just been quiet, and kind of indifferent. And whenever he met Malfoy’s gaze, he hadn’t sensed any hostility.
They worked in silence for the better part of an hour, the book ping-ponging between them. Eventually Malfoy set down his quill and neatly rolled up his parchment and pushed the book one final time over to Harry’s side of the table.
Harry also knew that Draco was withholding something from him. He didn’t know if he should push the other boy this time, especially since Draco’s face was quite stoic. Harry had a feeling he wouldn’t budge easily, if at all. So Harry, with a small frown, changed the subject, but resolved not to forget about it quite yet.
“G’night.” came Draco’s voice, slightly sleepy, and Harry smiled again in the dark as he turned over and feel asleep.
Then Hermione let out a little “Oh!” and Ron’s eyes went to her. Harry could tell she knew, now. She was smiling as she watched them, and Harry decided this was a good a time as any to clue Ron in.
“Oh.” Draco hesitated for a moment, wondering whether to keep up the lie to her as well, before sighing. Daphne’s much better at reading him for lies that Harry is, might as well tell her. It’s not like it’s an easy connection to make for anyone but Draco.
“Well, in her defense, we do have our NEWT exams this year,” he pointed out, and alarmed comprehension dawned on Harry’s face.
“I like the sketches.” he says, feeling slightly ashamed to have prodded so much. But Malfoy doesn’t seem to mind.
“I think your dress robes are better than mine,” commented Harry as they walked through the hallways towards the sound of orchestral music. Draco smirked, taking the edge of his sleeve between two fingers and rubbing the smooth fabric between them. He glanced at Harry, who was wearing nice robes of bottle-green.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Merlin, it was so chaotic. I forgot how energetic little kids are. Almost wore out my shoes chasing down this one kid.” Draco snorted but went to draw Harry down for a kiss.
“Doubt it.” he replied. Daphne took his hand, and he turned his head away from her knowing eyes. “Shut up.”
The past week had been a little odd, in his opinion, thought Draco. Harry had seemed very jittery, and never looked like he was fully relaxed. Draco had pestered him about it a couple times, but to no avail.
“So,” he said, trying to change the subject. “Do you want to go have an early breakfast, or do you want to head up to the Headmistress’s office and snag two spots to France?”
“Because we’re friends now, and I worry when you leave for a long time without telling anyone.” Potter replied, and his words make Draco’s heart flutter. He took a shaky breath and let it out. His hands brushed parchment; the Map had dropped into his lap from numb fingers.
“It wasn’t her fault, Draco,” she replied quietly. “I kept prying and she didn’t mean to tell me. Even when she did all she said was that sometimes you need time by yourself because-”
“You have ink on your hands,” Harry says rather pointlessly, grasping for something to say. Malfoy glances down at his hands before looking up again.
But Merlin, he was filled to bursting with hope and joy, too. Because Harry liked him, Harry had gone stargazing with him, Harry had kissed him. It was so much more, so much better than Draco could’ve dared to dream of.
“It’s hard not to be, with you around.” Draco remarked, and slid the chopped valerian root off of the cutting board and into the cauldron. A shoot of silver sparks went up and he poked the fire with his wand again to get the solution boiling.
talking around him, or that he’d gone looking for Harry tonight, like Harry had gone looking for him.
He closed the lid of his trunk with a soft thump and sat next to it, twirling his wand absentmindedly in his hand. It was a relatively warm day today, the sun was lighting up the grounds outside. There were birds chirruping in far-off trees. All together it was quite peaceful.
“Goodbye,” said Harry, trying to make the two leave. Everyone nearby is watching, and it made him bloody uncomfortable. The girl waved, and dragged the boy back to the Gryffindor table. Harry closed his eyes in annoyance for a second.
“I don’t care what people think, Draco. You said you didn’t either.” Harry said calmly as they walked through an empty hallway and began ascending one of the moving staircases. It began to shift and they paused until it was stationary again.
Not that he would mind being sick again, thought Harry with a heavy sigh. It got him special attention from Draco, which he gladly welcomed.
Harry and Daphne turned to leave, Daphne a bit reluctantly. As they walked down the empty stone halls, footsteps echoing, Daphne spoke.
Camille was perched on her bed, Daphne and Amelie on either side. Simon was lounging in an armchair nearby, Harry was sitting in another chair, and Draco was sitting on the floor, in between Harry’s legs. Harry’s fingers were absentmindedly playing with Draco’s hair, something that Draco thought felt quite nice, though he wouldn’t ever tell Harry that. It was warm and cozy inside the dorm room, and Draco was pleasantly comfortable.
Draco laughed and cut him off. “No, it’s alright. Actually, I was thinking of- of you. Us.” he said, for the first time sounding shy.
“Then you don’t need your glasses, do you?” Draco pointed out, and through blurry vision Harry saw Draco put his glasses on. “Yikes, nevermind. Your eyesight is really horrible.”
“Yes.” he said shortly, and Harry could see the walls coming back down between them. Malfoy’s embarrassed. He stared at the floor again, a pink flush in his cheeks. If Harry had to guess, he hadn’t meant to say so much and now regretted it.
Finally they reached the spot Harry had picked out, and as Harry walked to the blanket he felt the air change from chilly to pleasantly warm, and sighed in relief. Another thing that was working out. He’d set the blanket on top of the hill, and laid out all of Draco’s favorite little snacks and desserts. As they sat down, Harry watched Draco, anxious for his response to all of this.
Harry was kissing him back just as wildly, and suddenly Harry grasped Draco’s shoulders, his fingers curling, and in one smooth motion flipped them over so that Harry was on top of Draco. Draco panted, and Harry broke away and pressed kisses down his jaw, his neck, his hands slipping under Draco’s shirt. Draco yelped, and Harry’s eyes met his again, his gaze intense and rakish and wonderful.
His skin was pale, and his grey eyes were wide in surprise, though they quickly changed and became shadowed and guarded. His cheeks were hollow.
“Sorry. I tried.” he replied, tugging on his shoes. “Alright, let’s go down.” Draco and Harry walked down to the dining hall, and Draco was relieved to see that Harry was acting as normal as ever. Like yesterday had never happened. Which Draco was glad about, because it meant that they were still friends, still good friends. And his secret was still safe.
Harry nodded, and his eyes moved to the stars overhead. Infinite sprinkles of light dotted the black canvas, and Harry felt a sense of wonder.
“I’ll miss you too. And I will write.” he replied. “Don’t cry, you’ll make me cry,” he teased gently, and she laughed. Harry was then seized by Camille and promised the same to her, that he would write. Over Camille’s shoulder he saw Draco and Daphne saying goodbye to Simon, Daphne with watery eyes. Harry walked over and said a quick farewell to Simon before Draco grabbed his hand tightly.
“They’re like little stars.” Harry said softly, setting down the food. Draco and Harry sat, lit by the glow of the lights. Draco could hear the soft chirping of crickets among the undergrowth, and suddenly remembered something. He muttered a spell and transfigured a blade of grass into parchment, before spelling words onto it and folding it deftly into a paper dragon, which he then enchanted to fly back to the castle.
“Yeah, they named a constellation after me. I’m that wonderful. You should aspire to be like me.” Harry chuckled. “Yeah, there is.”
Harry hesitates before resting a hand on the chair opposite Malfoy at the small table, the slight noise making the other boy raise his head. Harry blinks.
“You sound like Hermione,” Draco snorted. “It’ll be fun. And people will treat us normally. I won’t have to deal with people attacking me, you won’t have to deal with adoring fans and the autograph-hopeful.” Harry made a noise of agreement. “Why don’t you give out autographs?” mused Draco, spinning a ladle between his fingers.
“So they brought you up to the hospital wing, you were unconscious from the pain, I think. And the spell was still going on, they didn’t know how to stop it. You were in here for two days while they researched remedies, because nothing was working except one Pain-Relieving potion, but it didn’t get rid of all of the pain.” finished Ron.
“What’s going on?” Potter suddenly walked down the stairs in front of Draco, eyes widening at something over Draco’s shoulder. “Seamus, what are you-”
“That’s Teddy, I presume?” said Draco from behind him, and Harry picked up the baby and turned around.
Draco pushed at his chest a little, and Harry pulled back. He was panting slightly, they both were, Harry could see Draco underneath of him, hair messy and cheeks flushed and lips parted, drawing in breath after breath. He looked bloody gorgeous.
“Last night you were using me as a pillow, then told me to go get you a blanket, then wouldn’t let me go get you one because I would’ve had to leave you for a second.” pointed out Harry, and the girls cackled. Draco flushed.
“Thanks, you two.” exclaimed Camille, and Harry realized that Daphne and Draco were back at the table, accompanied by someone who looked vaguely familiar but who Harry couldn’t place.
“Let’s not go to the Headmistress,” said Draco. “I’m fine. It’s not like any harm was done. I’ll just bring my wand with me next time.” Harry stared at him.
Suddenly there was a tapping noise on the window outside, and Draco looked up to see a handsome tawny owl, feathers slightly ruffled from the wind, a letter clutched in its beak. He frowned a little. Who’d be sending him a letter now? Maybe Pansy, but why?
“Draco wouldn’t sleep, wouldn’t eat,” added Hermione quietly. “He just stayed next to you.” They all glanced over at him, and Harry frowned.
Even if it means I'd have to find all the reasons for them appearing alone, I already made two of them bloom anyway.” He felt an uncomfortable twist in his stomach, knowing that Malfoy feels so desperate only because he claimed to abandon him, telling him that Malfoy didn't need his help anymore, Harry regretted these words, he really did, even though he wasn't entirely wrong either.
i've been having a really hard time with my anxiety, suffering from more attacks than usual and i found myself curled up in bed crying, writing this fic as if in search for temporary safety, your kudos and comments make me extremely happy, this chapter is a tad softer than the others, i had a blast writing it
“You murderous snake!” a certain ravenclaw seemed to shout, “get lost!” Someone else just as brave remarked, Hermione gasped, putting her hands over her mouth “this is horrible…” she whispered, Harry agreed
“Stop it Ron" Hermione said, smiling anyway, unlike Harry and Ginny,  Ron and Hermione didn't break up, their love was so intense Harry could sculpt it into the most beautiful art piece, sharp but steady, just like their relationship
“You seem to be bothered with some else’s problems” she said casually, as if it was written on his face, he chuckled “how did you know?”
"Some friends you are." Harry grumbled, looking at the tower of muffins between them. "I'm full." He said suddenly, grabbing a handful and shoving them in his bag.
I really love Draco's and Hermione's dinamic of friendly rivals, I felt like she really missed a sassy friend like Draco in the books so here I am starting their friendship, i'm trying to take my time to show character growth and romance coming with it
“You scum!!” A thud “you think you can just walk around these halls like it was nothing?!”  another kick, but with this one a pained groan followed
“Why do you care so much about them anyway? They're nagging Malfoy aren't they?” Ron was walking besides them, already munching on some chocolate frogs he brought to class but fell asleep before he got the chance to eat them, Harry frowned “honestly… I don't know, I'm just so curious what are they, and why am I the only one to see them?” Ron hummed at that, swallowing a big delicious bite of chocolate “man I wish I could see them”
“ Only Harry can see them and well...Draco Malfoy, we think” she took a sip, Hagrid shifted in his seat “what do they look like?”
“I know that.” She said it as if it was a normal thing to be, as if he just told her he ate the most delicious chocolate frog ever, no concern whatsoever.
“Shut up Draco, I thought we were friends.” Harry said, pushing the paper bag into his arms, Draco gasped and almost dropped all of it's insides  catching it in his hands clumsily. His head jerked up angrily “I thought this was your bag?!” Harry smirked “not anymore” and started making his way towards their table. “Wha-” he was about to complain, but realized that he was left alone with the two elves with all of his friends already halfway to their workplace. Draco snapped his mouth shut, giving the small pair a confused glare, as if he's unsure of how to act so he just returns to his natural state: being a dick.
to roll his eyes, recalling Draco's words mockingly. “You know what? Never mind. You can stay here in your wet clothes, freeze to death for what I care! Maybe Filch will come around and give you a blanked, I'm going to
“Harry you're not supposed to be carrying my weight!” He exclaimed, not loud enough for their friends to hear but tough enough to make an impact, Harry couldn't care less about the tone however, since his heart did an embarrassing leap when he heard Draco use his first name. It was beating hard and fast in his ribcage, and he hoped that Malfoy wouldn't see the red appearing on his cheeks. “I want to, is that bad?” He answered as casually as he could, even though he felt like screaming and running a marathon through whole Scotland. Malfoy pouted “seriously, it's my burden to- hey!” He exclaimed as Harry snatched the apple from his hands “you're too slow, Draco.” He said teasingly, stepping a bit closer to him, just so their elbows would touch. He proudly ran his knife through Draco's stolen fruit, peeling it a lot faster than the other boy did. Malfoy huffed frustratedly but didn't move away, letting their elbows touch as for the first time they bear an immense weight, but decided to share it, just so it becomes a bit lighter than it was before. And Harry, though tried to ignore this voice in his head bugging him for the last hour, failed to push away the realization that already had come, standing in his doorstep and endlessly demanding, shouting for him to acknowledge the fearsome thought; that Harry, had long fallen for Draco Malfoy.
“I just want.. for you to give me a chance.” Draco said, turning to finally look a Neville who had quit crying, but did have a mouthful of pie he was munching on, he seemed to be in deep through, his eyes still red and puffy from the previous crying. He started at the pie, and somehow staring at it made his eyes tear up again, perhaps it really is that sweet and horrible, Draco hadn't tried, he doesn't even like apple pie, but Hermione was right, feeding someone a thing you made sure feels nice, even when it's Neville Longbottom “I can't forgive you.” He said, his words followed by a painful silence, making Draco release a heavy sigh from his chest, of course he can't.
After the supposed last champion Cedric Diggory was chosen from the Goblet of fire, Harry and Ron had gone back to eating and discussing quidditch. It was first when the last member of the golden trio Hermione granger nudged to Harry's shoulder that the boys became aware of the attention that were drawn to them.
“Harry.. in the great hall you very clearly stated that you didn’t want to compete in the tournament but as it were announced during the feast, if you are chosen as a champion you are bound by a magical contract stating that you have to compete or suffer great consequences”
"Harry DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME INTO THE GOBLET OF FIRE!?" The headmaster spoke so fast that Harry (and the rest of the hall) shook their heads in confusion.
"NO, WHY THE FUCK AM I ALWAYS THE MIDPOINT I DIDNT ASK FOR THAT. I HAVE BEEN I MORTAL FUCKING DANGER SINCE MY FIRST YEAR FOR FUCKS SAKE. THIS YEAR WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A CALM YEAR. I DON'T FUCKING WANT TO COMPETE"
Harry and Draco spend some time alone before deciding to go down and deal with the chaos that they were certain was happening in the great hall.
They walked down the stairs from the astronomy tower in silence and hands in hands. They had never really told people about their relationship, of course their closest friends knew because of course Pansy and Hermione would notice that Draco and Harry stopped talking about each other in the way they used to. And Hermione and Harry could and wouldn't keep a secret from Ron, just as Pansy and Draco had to tell Blaise, Theo and Millie.
"Thank you" the words were barely out of his mouth before he had placed his lips on top of Draco's. They spend a few moments like that. Simply kissing, but after a little while Harry's tounge moved across Draco's lips and without noticing it he opened his lips, allowing him access. Their tongues met each other and they moaned as their youngest received the much decired contact. Their tounges had started battleing for dominance neither really carrying if they won or lost. While Harry loved to sit on Draco's lap he loved the feeling of draco underneath him even more. He pushed him down to the ground, so Harry was on top of Draco. Harry's hands started to feel their way up to Draco's hair and before long they were roaming through the hair and another soft moan left Draco. They continued to explore each other as they have done so many times before, before they had to stop and breathe.
Dumbledore floats Harry all the way to his office. The walk to his office is long and quiet, making it a really awkward walk. When they walked into his office the rest of the professors and the headmistress from Beauxbatons and the headmaster from Durmstrang along with the 3 champions, were always in the office. When They entered the office and Fleur saw the way Harry was being floated, she was angry. How dare that old man treat a kid like that?!
"How many people know that you're a vampire, Ivy?" Madam Pomfrey asked the young girl in front of her. She now understands the girl was born as a vampire. She wasn't turned otherwise it would be recorded in the Ministry's files. "And is your mother a vampire as well?" Ivy looked back at her, not wanting to hear anything about her own mother.
"I know when my son's plans are, Harry," said Narcissa. Her smile only widened at him. "You know, he talks about you a lot to Andromeda and me."
In a couple of days, Sirius had come over as well. Harry felt a little bit happy because he got to see Sirius from time to time, but nothing could keep his depression aside. Probably not even love. Harry wondered if there were any wizards who go through depression and anxiety just like him.
"No," Harry drawled with an obvious blush on his neck and face. Why couldn't they shut up? Honestly... "I'm heading back up to Gryffindor to get my books. Are you coming or going to your classes?"
"Only for you, my love," Harry replied and snaked his arms up Draco's back to run his hands through his hair. That soft silky hair he adores. So pretty, perfect and soft...
What kind of a friend am I? He thought darkly to himself and dug his nails deeper into his arms. That sharp pain made him focus on where he was going. He knew what he had to do, that was to get his new sharp friend out. I don't deserve friends at all. I'm just a freak, someone who doesn't deserve good friends like Ron and Hermione. Or even Draco. I don't deserve that kiss Draco gave me. It must have been a mistake. I'm a mistake, someone who should have died on the night of my parent's death but instead I had to fucking live this worthless life.
Blaise stared at Ron's hand, not knowing what to do except poke it with his index finger. "It's Blaise, to you. I hate this last name thing."
Getting a little lost in his thoughts about this rose and Draco, he looks at the chapter Draco had been reading. It was chapter one. The blonde Slytherin must have been too tired to actually read anything. He spots the word 'mate' in the footer heading of the book. Soul and mate. Hmm... It can't have been a coincidence, could it?
Ron smiled and waved a dismissed hand at him, hoping Harry was right and that Malfoy won't start anything. "By the way, who's Ivy?" He asked as he once again began stuffing his mouth full of waffles.
He brought his hands up to Draco's face and cupped his chin, he swung his leg over Draco's side and pushed him down, so he lay on top of him. Draco let out a soft
Draco remembered back in the second year when he, Crabbe and Goyle were talking about the heir of Slytherin and somehow Harry was mentioned in the conversation. "Yeah, you're right," he finally admits with a sigh, rubbing at his face. "I did nearly come out to them. It was hard lying to them as well as faking hatred when they mentioned Harry. It was something I've hated myself doing."
"Just let it all out George," Harry said in a soothing voice. "Trust me, you'll feel much better after." George let all the tears out, all the tears his body processed until there were none left. It took an hour of crying for him to stop.
Draco caught his cousin staring off at the Ravenclaw table and it was obvious to him who she was staring at. "Did you want to tell me why I've been seeing Beauxbaton girls being led by you into the sixth year's girl's dormitory nearly every evening?" he asked her curiously although he knew the answer. Bloody lesbians...
"It was hot, that's how it was Potter," Draco said softly, not sounding insulting for once in his lifetime. He didn't want to sound insulting to Potter at all. That Malfoy is gone and was last years problem.
"Malfoy! "Ron shouted from beside Seamus and Dean with his own newspaper in his hands. He doesn't know what his mate sees in Malfoy at all and why he would be friends with someone who has biased opinions on other people. "How dare you tell such lies about our Professor!"
Draco and Pansy nodded. "Deal!" they chorused and held out their hands for a handshake. The three accepted the handshake quickly and got back to eating their breakfast.
They both waited in line for their time and when it finally came, they took two pictures in the couple's section even if the older students gave them odd stares, but they didn't care. The first picture Draco and Harry had their arm around each other's waist and the second picture Draco was kissing Harry's cheek and Harry had his arms around Draco and grinned at the camera.
"Come seek us where our voices sound, We cannot sing above the ground, And while you're searching ponder this; We've taken what you'll sorely miss, An hour-long you'll have to look, and to recover what we took. But past an hour, the prospect's black. Too late, it's gone, it won't come back."
"Malfoy, everyone's over at the photographers and we want to take a group photo which must include you and Harry in it," said Hermione, and she pointed her thumb behind her. "We're all required to be there now so if you two would follow me we can get these photos out the way."
"And Cedric, he iz juzt a friend, too?" Krum asked him. "And what about Drako? That blonde boy you hang around with a lot."
Ron was staring at himself in the mirror with what looked like a girl's dress in his arms. "Oh, nothing..." he said with a bitter smile. "It's just that mum brought me some weird dress robe for the Yule Ball. It literally looks like a dress, no kidding." He turned away from the mirror to face Harry.
Harry looked around himself, his heart dropping from the sight, young slytherins who had never took a part in grown up’s wars were standing behind the crowd shaking in fear, tucking their green ties deep into their robe pockets, hiding the shameful slytherin color, the same color that was now stained crimson by Malfoy’s blood.
“I love you like… like...er…” Ron's terrified eyes ran around their surroundings, looking for something to compare it to “....like a table…?” He said in a squeaky voice, not facing his own girlfriend, Harry deadpanned, he could've chose anything, but he chose to compare his love for his significant other to a table.
“but don’t you think like..finding out what are they will kinda help Malfoy?” Harry noticed how hard Ron tried not to look worried, he hated the guy even before he saw his sneering face,Harry was surprised Ron showed any interest in Malfoy at all.
Their little walk came to a stop when both of them simultaneously turned to opposite directions towards their dorms, Draco was about to go down the stairs to the dungeons when he noticed, turning back to Potter awkwardly. “Er… that's where I go…” he pointed down the stairs and Potter nodded, shrugging “yeah, I have to continue through that hallway to reach my tower.” For a mere second them just being together felt so natural, Draco completely forgot their house differences, and the fact that they live in two different sides of the castle. “Well, good night” he said, not really knowing what to do when your rival suddenly becomes your friend, do you hug? Shake hands? He and Pansy usually hug when they part, would Potter find it weird? While Draco had his daily existential crisis Potter already turned on his wheel, waving “good night”  Harry said, Draco just nodded, biting his tongue so he won't wish him good night again. He lingered for a little while though, watching Potter's back as he descended, a part of him wanted to sigh, he didn't know why, and just as he was about to go down the staircase he noticed it.
“We're here” he heard his mother's head hit the soft seat with relief, her pale arms sliding down from the black steering wheel “driving a car is so exhausting, I don't know how muggles do it all the time” she turned around to face him, a tired smile resting on her face, Draco returned it,still not quite moving from his seat, her palm found its way to Draco's hand, sending a wave of reassuring safety through his whole body “ shall we go?” Unlike his father, his mother was asking, not demanding of him to do what she wanted him to do, and helplessly, just like he did with his father
“Would you look at that…” Draco's voice was raspy, he stared at Potter's figure through heavy eyelids, red and throbbing from his  salty tears “Harry Potter, the savior of the wizarding world, keeping his all known hero persona and helping out a war criminal” a hum left his throat, it's just so ironic that the events of their sixth year are repeating themselves,Draco Malfoy falling apart for no other than Harry Potter himself to find him and to break him more, maybe Draco will earn an another scar from this encounter.
“Did Harry tell you to say it?” He said at last, Draco opened his mouth to answer only to get interrupted “I know you guys had a fight. Probably because of me, and now you're okay again. So Harry asked of you to apologise to me.” He stated coldly, glaring daggers onto his face, Draco could only nod weakly “Longbottom listen-”
His chest throbbed,and the pain from yesterday's beating kindly reminded him where he was, just like all the other students cared to remind him, he no longer belonged at Hogwarts, somehow, the weight on his back grew, he didn't know those things could get heavier, but it seemed like they did, just like Pansy, deep inside he was hurt, longing for the warmth of his mother who kept him safe all this time, this Hogwarts wasn’t the school he once knew, a place he and his friends hung out and endlessly teased Potter and his friends, a place where his actions were always hidden and forgotten due to his father’s powerful name, Draco was thrown off into a completely different world, a damaged heartbroken world mercilessly abused by war, in which Draco fought, for all the wrong sides and reasons, Draco grabbed the fabric at his chest clinging into his button up helplessly, his cold hands cooling his throbbing chest, everything hurts and not only from his beating, everything is pushed down with the weight on his back.
It was then when Potter shifted, every movement of his noticeable on the small bed “did it hurt?” Potter, who Draco assumed to be long asleep, spoke suddenly. And he debated whether he should turn around and strangle the git for disturbing his sleep twice in one hideous night. “Shut up Potter. This is not a sleepover.” Draco growled, pulling his blanket over his ears as if it would make all the Potter-related noise to go away. But the boy didn't waver, instead, Draco felt an another shift on his bed as Potter popped himself on one elbow, his gaze sternly locked on his nape “I never had a sleepover..” the Gryffindor muttered, a tint of hurt in his voice. Draco made his annoyance known by groaning loudly before turning over to face him, his glare softening when he actually
Inside, it was a big study. With rows of bookshelves filled neatly with hardcovers, a small writing table with a quill standing on the edge of it, a long peacock feather dipped in pitch black ink. Next to it was a plush leather sofa, well used yet looking as well as new. On it, was seated his father. Lucius Malfoy, reading a piece of parchment. When Draco walked in. Gray eyes shot up, scanning him before twisting into a disapproving frown. "I had told you numerous times, do not walk around the house barefoot. It's for peasants." He said, his voice stiff, but Draco didn't mind. Instead he padded into the room, feet meeting a soft carpet on the way. "Father- I'm sorry, I just couldn't wait!" He whispered with excitement, hoping his father won't scold him further after what he was going to do. "Why are you awake? It is way past your bedtime. You know you must-"
Solus swirled back and forth on his back, and Draco felt like he couldn't watch this scene any longer. He thought about saying 'i'm sorry’ again, but he couldn't, Longbottom wouldn't take half assed apologies, and Draco, well, he was no worthy of telling a heartfelt one either.
Harry remembered what Ron had said to them the other day, that they have to be kind, not because they deserve it
Why did he even think it was a good idea? He was just walking down the hallway before he heard pained cries coming out of Myrtle's bathroom, which was a usual thing down there, but this time it clearly wasn't her, the crying voice sounded broken, it's wails sending shivers down Harry's spine, making him cringe
“So my father taught me not to fail.” Malfoy said, flinching at his own words. “He taught me to sit tight, and master my spells, to perfect my movements, because Malfoys are allowed nothing but perfection.” A memory flashed in front of his eyes, how he's seen Malfoy and his father at the beginning of his second year at Hogwarts, how tense little Draco was around his own father, it all made sense, all fell together and yet, Harry couldn't bear admitting the truth.
Not only that, but he also felt disoriented and incredibly warm. His eyes opened slowly, blinking a few times while two thoughts occurred to him: this wasn't his bed nor his common room.
“Me too” Hermione agreed, tucking a lock of her hair right behind her ear “ it's just… so weird when we can't help you, you know? We got so used to all kinds of adventures…”
“Are you.. alright?” Potter did not sound gentle nor caring, kind of bored actually, Draco felt himself chuckle, dry and tired, he slowly unraveled his eyes his bloody sight fixating on the thin person before him
“He was crying” Harry cut him off before he said something stupid, Ron closed his mouth firmly, forming a thin line
Which is bad, since Blaise is right in the room with them, and by the devious smirk on his lips, he does not know any better. “Morning love birds, you better get dressed before you miss breakfast completely and whine to be about it all day” Blaise said, pulling out a fresh button up and changing right in front of them, Harry, his mouth agape, quickly closed it moving the blankets from his feet ( throwing it on top of Malfoy in the process) and stumbling out of the bed clumsily almost tripping over his long pajama pants.  “we're not love birds!!” Harry stuttered, but Blaise wasn't looking at his desperate face. Instead, menacing eyes focused on Harry's body, not that there's anything wrong with it, after leaving the Dursleys he became a rather healthy boy. He didn't know what Blaise was staring at exactly, but Harry couldn't help but feel uncomfortable under his gaze.
He looked at the small piece in his hands, silently unwrapping it, it was a simple piece of toast, nothing too fancy, but it was still
“Why can't I just use magic?” he moaned, yanking the apple from his hand when the knife finally found its way to his finger, he hissed loudly shaking his hands which now Harry noticed had one finger colored crimson, quickly popping it in his mouth, sucking on it grumpily “I told you!!” He shouted, his eyes suddenly meeting Harry's.  He might have accidentally shoved a bunch of flour down his throat since it just went dry, there was something different about Malfoy, all worked up and frustrated like that, struggling with the dumbest and the simplest of things making him look more alive, more human. He had rolled up his sleeve just like Hermione told him, the soft yellow light of the room making even his ugly mark beautiful, platinum blonde hair all messed up and from all the times he ran his fingers through making several locks fall freely against his forehead, almost glowing white in this lighting. Something in his stomach twisted uncomfortably, and he dropped his gaze to look back at his bowl, filled with a little mountain of pure white flour, so soft yet cool to the touch, a voice in his head suggested to shove his face into it, that would make him get rid of a bizarre thought.
“He was a dear friend of mine” her usually stern voice suddenly softened, showing raw pain that had yet to sink in, such vulnerability made Draco uncomfortable, like he doesn't deserve to see this
A long shadow creeping from the corner, exactly where Potter need to turn to in order to get to the Gryffindor tower. His heart skipped a beat, and without thinking he leaped forward grabbing Potter by the arm and pulling him down the staircase. “Malfoy what the fu-” Potter yelped, being interrupted by Draco's hand clasping over his mouth, Draco shushed him, putting a singular finger in front of his lips, mouthing “Filch” to a round brilliant green pair of eyes, which then narrowed flickering back to the hallway where footsteps could be heard now. “What's this? Someone has been walking around here Mrs.Norris!” Filch’s annoying voice echoed through the halls, if Draco didn't stop him Potter would have to serve a pretty nasty detention.  “Someone's out after curfew!! And the steps are leading to…?” They could hear his steps getting closer, but Draco had no interest sticking around for him to find them, fiddling in his pants single handedly he searched for his wand, whispering a silencing charm on both of them before tearing off the wall and pulling Potter down the stairs right into the dungeons.
“Ugh…” a quiet grunt could be heard right next to him, Malfoy popped himself on his elbows lazily, sleepy gray eyes not awake enough for him to grasp what's going on. He slowly turned around, and Harry noticed how messy his bedhead is, one side of his head completely smushed, probably caused by Harry's chest, which now lays cold without Malfoy on it. His eyes narrowed, as if trying to process whether the man in his bed is invited to stay there or not, and then dropped his head back to the pillow, groaning; “quit yelling...it's too early for that.” Harry gasped, only not realizing how raspy Draco's voice sounds, and if he didn't know any better, he'd assume Malfoy just had a
. Potter's eyes widened before narrowing again, his brows curled into a frown. “I'm not dramatic, also, who said I'd let you top me?”  Draco felt like slamming his head into a wall,his cheeks definitely red now. “I can't believe we're having this conversation!” he said, and Potter had the
"Yeah, and what's the occasion? A posh blond." Ron snorted. "He doesn't care what you smell like, I bet he would get in your pants even if you wore nothing but your stinky Quidditch gear." Harry turned sharply at that, his cheeks flushing. "First of all it's not stinky! Second of all-" truth is, he had nothing to say to his defense, so his deliberate voice quickly turned into a mumble. "We are late for class.."
He didn't respond, he bit his lower lip painfully, quietly sobbing,his body stiff and frozen, loud nerve wrecking footsteps made their way towards him, it was almost soothing, to hear the loud scary sound getting bigger while he shuts his eyes tight devoured by silent darkness, and when your eyes don't see, you notice how loudly your heart is beating, in sync with each and every footstep
For a second Harry wondered if the boy is still in the bathroom, considering the state he was in,Harry is definitely right.
Maybe Malfoy didn't deserve to be here, perhaps he deserved to be locked up like his father, but still, he was there, right in front of him
No matter how much they bicker, Ron and Hermione are made for each other, since the day they met they liked each other and been at each other's throats all the same, Hermione's wit perfectly balancing Ron's kind nature, both of them are Harry's friends and he couldn't find anyone more suitable to date each other,that also means they always come in a pack, thus the pair is easier to find.
“Dear students, may I have your attention please?” the chattering hall went silent, all four colors looking at her, she sighed but her thin lips curled into a soft smile “welcome back, to an another year at Hogwarts” the crowd cheered, Harry shot a look at his friends who were smiling widely, their hands curled together, probably thinking Harry won't notice, his eyes then trailed off to the teachers table, Hagrid was waving at him just like he always did, he waved back, with professor Flitwick jumping besides him, a glass of wine in his hand, the little teacher was cheering for everyone who made it and stood here now, they all deserved it, their return is indeed a worthy toast.
"Harry." He said again, his lips stretching into a satisfied smile when Draco glared at him. "You're acting like a child."
Satisfied with his victory, Potter kept nagging him during their whole way to the Slytherin common room, stopping only when Draco had murmured “a new page” before entering, sighing with relief as the warmth of the dim fire welcomed him there, everything about his common room was so calming, feeling more like a home to him than the new shitty apartment they got in London, heck, even more than the manor. Potter clearly didn't agree with him however, freezing the moment he stepped into the room. “Um… is it really okay for me to come in?” He mumbled, all his teasing from earlier evaporating. Draco was already about to step into his dormitory, waving him to follow. “Of course, don't you Gryffindors bring friends from other houses over?” On his third step on the staircase Potter let out a whimper behind him, quiet steps following him up to his room. “And where will I sleep?”  A reasonable question for once, Draco might as well call himself impressed. “Don't worry about that, not many eight years returned to finish school, also, as you may have guessed, one of my roommates is dead so there's always a free bed.” He pulled the door open, entering a well known room: four beds scattered across a wide room with a round window in the middle, it could never be opened, but it does show a great view of the dark lake, during his first year Draco was surprised their room had any sunlight at all, but then Snape explained him how the founder charmed every window to let through as much lighting and sound as any normal window would, just so Slytherins won't feel any different than they already are. So now the soft moonlight crept through the glass, lighting up the otherwise dark room, with only one candle on Draco's nightstand, perhaps Blaise’s doing. Usually two only two beds are occupied, Blaise and his, but seems like his friend is out for the night, he did have a thing going with some Hufflepuff. “Well, that's my room” he said, walking straight to his trunk, already searching for some change of clothes. “W-where are your roommates?” Potter asked, looking around curiously yet not leaving the doorstep. “Well,  as I said, one is dead” he waved at the left side of the room while his other hand still dug through his clothes. “Goyle is in Azkaban, Blaise seems to be out, he does that often, so it's just us here.” Finding what he was searching for, he pulled out a green sweater which should fit Potter just right, together with a pair of ivory pajama pants that were short on him. “Here” Draco said, tossing Potter the clothes. Being a fairly talented seeker, Potter caught them easily, glaring down at the fabric as if it's cursed.
Confused, Draco rubbed his eye furiously before glancing at the creature again, it was still there, how was she not seeing this?? It's right there! Was he imagining things? No, it's weight was too real to be imaginary, or maybe not
“What did you do.” Harry stared at Ron blankly, his friends groaned “I didn't do anything!!! H-Hermione I really like you like-”
“I don't even like sweets.” He stated when Hermione pulled out the steaming pastry out of the oven, placing it on the counter to cool. It smelled great yes, with all the butter and sugar that went into this thing how could it not? But after putting so much effort into something he doesn't even get to eat all the bruises on his hands suddenly feel worthless. “Well then.” She gave him a long and disappointed look, casting a quick cooling spell before cutting into the thing, destroying the pretty crust she had put so much effort in. “One of the things about food is that you could also give it to someone important.” She cut out a neat slice and placed it on a plate then handed it to Draco. “How about you give it to someone? Sharing something you made actually feels really nice.” She said, cutting out slices for herself and the other two morons, who right now tried to beg the house elves for tea.
“As you may already noticed, this room is filled with Portraits of all the previous Hogwarts headmasters”  McGonagall smiled at him, already getting up from her seat “he'd like to see you, I'm getting tired of this bitter old man really”
He would flush, but it seems like his feelings for Draco were quite obvious, so he might as well act on it. It's probably wrong to search for him that way, Hermione will scold him, but that's for later. Ducking into a corner Harry pulled out his marauders map. Draco wasn’t hiding in the dungeons nor lurking in the hidden hallways of Hogwarts. Instead, his name appeared slowly passing near the headmistress office. Weird, but not totally unusual. Without second thought Harry bolted down the hallway, his heartbeat picking pace together with him just moments before betraying him and stopping entirely when his eyes landed on a certain blonde. Draco was standing right in front of the Griffin statue, a heap of books weighing down his arms, Harry would assume it to be uncomfortable and straining, but he couldn’t help but break a smile recalling how similar the git was to Hermione, both in intellect and the way the liked to carry their books. The boy seemed entranced by the statue, storm gray eyes searching so intensely Harry would assume he could see right through it into the familiar room beyond. Approaching quietly Harry stepped behind him, seizing his moment when he said; "Aren't they heavy?" A stupid question, Harry knew the moment Draco turned to meet his eyes, frowning. "Are you mocking me?" Draco spat, his words contrasting the softness of the lips who bored them. And Harry knew, since he got a taste of them yesterday. "I meant the books, idiot." Harry tried to explain carefully, he really didn't want their first conversation after the kiss to be a fight, or at least they could fight with their lips instead of their words. "Oh, right." Gray eyes widened, as if realizing where he was Draco looked around himself, worrying his lower lip in his teeth. He looked stressed, Harry noted as Draco avoided the Griffin statue like fire now, looking anywhere but behind him. Taking the initiative, Harry stepped right next to the boy and leaned to grab some books, his arms immediately screaming at him from the strain. Draco blinked. "Where are you headed?" Harry tried to keep his tone light, quirking a smile at the taller Slytherin. "Potter- that's fine I can carry this." Draco grumbled, reaching to take his stuff back only for Harry to duck out of his way quickly, praising his quick reflexes due to years and years of being his team's seeker. "Let me." He reassured, his heart clenching at the way Draco rolled his eyes. "I was about to return them to the library." He muttered at last, already walking down the hall only for Harry to follow him like an excited puppy.
Potter, he had his glasses off, making his already big eyes more noticeable, his hair was it's usual mess, but in the moonlight there was something more about it, the way the tips of his raven curls shone white against the moonlight, with each strand of hair sticking out in every direction, but his eyes locked on a certain strand, tucked neatly under the palm Potter was leaning on. Draco was ashamed to admit how
“You are a hypocrite you know that.” Draco mumbled, a desperate attempt to keep his head from reeling back to his terrible, terrible gay thoughts, he also pulled his pajama pants on before asking, he may have nothing embarrassing under his pants, but it still doesn't mean he could withstand Potter seeing it. “What do you mean?” He heard from behind him, Draco took his time to answer, the ruffling fabric behind him indicates that Potter had put on some pants, thank god. He slowly unbuttoned his wet shirt, not quite ready to expose himself as much quite yet, but eventually he reached the last button, letting the shirt slide off his shoulder, he could feel shivers running down his skin from the cold air of the room, making him hiss quietly. He was completely aware of Potter's eyes in his back, especially since the Solus scattered away from it and waited patiently on the bed as they always did when he got dressed. As he was taking his sleeves off he hesitated, knowing exactly what awaits him under the white fabric, taking in a deep breath, he took down his shirt completely. He clearly heard Potter gasp, knowing exactly what he saw; the dark mark. Still there, and it's thick black lines as ugly  as ever, quite fainted, but still very much noticeable, just sitting there, ruining a perfectly pale wrist, the air around them appeared to be sucked up by some vacuum, leaving a tense and heavy silence lingering over both of the boys. Before Potter could comment on it Draco said “your boxers are red.”
When his eyes opened again his was gasping for air, his blanket tossed to the floor besides him as he lay on his bed, sweaty and disheveled. Bolting forward he looked at his bedside table, but not for his clock, but at the piece of parchment under it.
"Tea and biscuits anyone?" Andromeda walked in the room with a small tray of biscuits and a white floating kettle with a few mugs. Even if nobody asked, the mugs were floating towards everyone slowly as the kettle began to fill each mug up with boiling water.
Draco gulped rapidly, never once looking away from Harry's face as he replied, "All of you. Give me all of you." He watched Harry's eyelids slide halfway down and then close altogether as he groaned at Draco's words. For a minute or two, Draco stared unguardedly up into Harry's face, enjoying the freedom to watch the flicker of emotions expressed there without being watched doing it. Harry bit his bottom lip in an entrancing way, mashing the pink flesh between his teeth until it threatened to break. His eyelashes were pure black and longer than you would imagine them to be. Draco watched his eyelids flutter but stay closed, unlike his mouth. He watched Harry's tongue dart out and lick his lips every so often, usually in time with a particularly pleasurable withdrawal, when Draco tightened all his muscles inside and made the outward journey difficult.
"Can you please bring us 3 small bowls each of Spaghetti Bolognese?" Harry asked his elf friend though he knew Dobby still thought as him as a master. He didn't want to be the master to anyone. He's just Harry.
Draco the ferret froze as he knew that Harry Potter was going to kiss him. Well, not technically him, but a ferret version of him. He gave both an excited and startled squeak. It was so nice hearing all that come out of Harry's mouth, and that Harry's liked him for a long time even if he knew that already. He so wanted to reply back but all he could do was squeak.
Draco then made an appearance and sat down on the other side of Harry. He gave his boyfriend a smile and sneakily put an arm around Harry's waist. "Hello, Harry," he said and resisted the urge to give him a kiss on the cheek. He can see how down Harry looks and just wished he knew how to help him. Was there a way though? There should be.
Pansy shook her head at him, not knowing who these initials could have been. "Jennifer and Lucilla?" she suggested and smiled at the thought of a Lesbian couple creating this. It would be so cute though!
"I know what you mean, Harry," Draco said and rubbed at his arm a little sadly. "Ivy and I aren't at Malfoy Manor because my father is always busy with work and my mother is in France probably visiting some popular witch. It's just always been like that; I don't mind it though because I get to spend the rest of the week with my favourite cousin."
Harry brushed his hands slowly and gently through Draco's hair, watching as the soft blonde locks bounced back into place. He chuckled softly, finding that amusing and adorable. He then leaned down and kissed Draco on the cheek, feeling his soft warm cheeks against his lips. He watched as Draco stirred in his sleep, he knew Draco wasn't sleeping so he trailed kisses down his cheek, down to his jawbone and down his neck. Draco flinched as he felt Harry kiss his neck and in a really nice spot, he leaned his head back so Harry had more room to kiss him.
"She said my hair will grow back and that it won't leave a mark," Cedric said with a laugh and gave Draco a knowing smile before walking towards another tent with Draco by his side. "So, what's with you caring for Harry now? I mean, I know you two are friends now and all..."
Draco had two people he had to watch out for. Ivy and Harry. Ever since finding those cuts on Harry's arm, he has been so worried. He is always hoping Harry is okay, someplace safe, away from sharp objects and around from people who could hurt him. Harry really is a sweetheart. He is so happy to have Harry in his life. Even if his boyfriend suffers from something, which he does hope he will let spill soon.
Ivy nodded and directed harry to the floor, signalling he should sit down. As soon as they both sat down on the chilly tiles with Ivy facing Harry, she began. "Well, I'm sure you know who Bellatrix LeStrange is," she said, and she didn't need him to answer her, so she continued. "I was actually told this from my Aunt Narcissa who is Draco's mother. Sirius and Willow apparently met at Bellatrix and Rodolphus's wedding. Knowing Sirius, he was always the one to get drunk first. All the known pure-blooded families were invited and Willow, Rodolphus's younger sister obviously got drunk as well. She began talking to Sirius and apparently, she decided to do 'the devil's tango' up in Narcissa's room with him by force. I don't know if that actually happened... but if it didn't then how could I be here? They were all pretty much in their teen years, around 16, or higher. They were that drunk as heck that they didn't even remember the wedding."
Harry ended the space between them a little hesitantly into a hug, and he snuggled into the hug as it was just so comfy and warm. He loves Draco's hugs and who wouldn't? "I hope this all ends soon, and that you feel a little better."
"What makes ye think that we would help ye?" Seamus asked him while Dean looks up and disparagingly shook his head. "And why would ye think that we would care? Ye're a damn Pureblood with loads of galleons. Ye can probably find out yer own way."
Harry sighed; might as well tell her or she'll become more curious about whose been sending him letters throughout the year. "Yes, it is from Sirius," he said with a little nod and shows her the envelope. "I've been talking to him since the start of school, just about how I'm doing and the tasks and about a someone you know and my liking for him."
"EVERTE STATUM!" Harry shouted. The orange beam of light hit the creature and sent it rocketing backwards several meters.
Draco was slowly sipping his Rose tea and taking small bites from his toast with strawberry jam. He wondered what was going through Harry's head at the time. Merlin knows how stressed and anxious Harry would be. He knew if he was put in the Tri-wizard Tournament he'd try everything he could to get out of it, even if it meant injuring himself.
Draco rubs his face over the bulge, though he knew it was a weird thing to do but he wanted to do such a thing. Besides, he liked doing it as it sent warmth all through his body and he could hear these faint sighs come from above him. He then licks from as far down the bulge goes and up as far as he could go without hitting his head on the table above him. He reaches up and rubs his palm up and down the material, seeing a darkened patch of obvious wetness where the bulge ends.
"Do you think you'll be able to sneak me down to the Slytherin common room and into the 4th year boy's dormitory?" Harry asks him and gives a little smirk. He would like to see the Slytherin boy's dormitory and be able to look out into the Black Lake. He wondered if it's peaceful like Ivy said it is.
"-Very worried for him," Pansy finished his sentence as it was obvious Draco would say the same thing. "Yes, Dray. I know. Blaise and I know. I am so glad you made a truce with him as well. Ivy is so proud of you too. You have no clue how happy she is now. You know how much she's been through. She's even given up looking for her blades which I have hidden in many different places in the Dungeons. Well, I hope she's given up looking for them. She has no idea how many spells I had to cast on them so she can't accio them to her." She pulled out of the hug with a smile and rose her hand to caress the whitish blonde hair.
Draco grabbed another piece of toast and fed it to Harry just to finish off where he was getting at earlier. He wasn't going to let Harry control this situation. He made sure Harry finished the whole plate off, so he knew Harry had eaten something and had enough energy to get around the castle.
Harry and Draco exited the secret room, as soon as they were at the wall and pulled the trigger, they hid under the invisibility cloak. The darkness of the library engulfed them; shadows reigned from parts of the castle as they walked to the Willow tree in silence. That silence stopped as they reached the Willow tree, Harry took the invisibility cloak off the both of them and placed it beside the trunk of the tree. Once he stood back up his, eyes met with Draco's eyes and he distracted himself by mounting his Firebolt and hovering in the air.
"I hope so too, and I'll see what I can do," said Harry and he rubs his forearm and looks at Draco. He decides to stand up so he's ready to leave them to find Ron. "Um... perhaps ask Blaise if he would like to hang with Ron for a while too. Those two actually get along quite fine, and if I do hang with one of you today again, he would have someone else to be with besides me."
Draco didn't know what to say. Harry was practically offering himself to him, and to touch him. He could feel Harry's hardening shaft under Harry's dress robe trousers, and it was starting his own orgasm up. "Harry, are you sure..." But he was cut off by Harry's nodding and pressing his hand down further on his crotch. "Harry..." He continued rubbing him, his hand over the top of Harry's hardening cock and the look Harry gave him, so full of lust, just told him to do it.
Harry smiled and looked back up at Cedric. He quite enjoys knowing Draco and other people do care about him. But that's just what he thinks "It's alright. It's been new for me to hear he cares for me ever since the start of the year. Oh, and-he-sort-of-kissed-me-on-the-cheek-after-you-left."
Draco let out a groan of delight, and he kept himself up by his arms on either side of Harry. He opened Harry's mouth hungrily to let his tongue in as Harry would always obey to whatever he wants. Harry's green eyes opened a little in surprise at the feel of Draco's tongue in his mouth, but he succumbed to his boyfriend's ministrations without hesitation.
"Well, look who's come back," said Hermione with her own smile, glad she could see a smile on Harry's face again. It's quite a rare thing to see honestly. "I'm afraid to ask how detention was if it gave you a smile. Or you are just happy because you're out of detention."
Pansy ran into the boy's arms and hugged them, glad they're not alone anymore. Blaise looked at Ron then to Neville, then looked down. He's glad they're here but he's feeling a little awkward now.
Ron looked at him for a moment, really wondering if Malfoy had put a spell on his best mate. "Forget about it, Harry," he said, gesturing Harry to stop with the conversation with a wave of his hand. "I think I may have been seeing things..."
Harry woke up on Saturday to the sound of grunting on the other side of his dorm room. He felt a little less depressed since he got about five hours of sleep and he only woke up twice last night. He sat up and placed his glasses on his nose, looking over at an angry Ron. "Ron, what is it?" he asked in a sleepy tone.
Harry told her everything that happened between him and Draco on their first date under the Willow tree and their most recent date which was a week ago. He didn't tell her about Ivy's suicide attempt because he didn't want to worry Hermione and apply more pressure on Ivy. He told her about a muggle garden, but not the one in Hogwarts because that will stay between Draco, him, and Ivy. He told Hermione what happened in the garden and obviously, he told her what actually happened with the kisses, the birds bringing the food, the pond and the gazebo.
Harry twisted the white doorknob to the right and opened the door. The first thing he saw was a happy beaming face and a child's voice yelling, "HAWWY!" Harry chuckled at his godson, and how the little wizard's hair turned a bright pink. "Hey there, Teddy." He picked Teddy up when he came running up to him. "How's my little squirt doing?"
Draco knew that Harry was just trapped inside his invisible box. When Hermione finished her ranting about the spell, with a flick of Draco's wand and mutter of
Harry took a deep breath and sighed. Here goes nothing. He just hoped Ron will take it well. "Have I ever told you about the truce I made with Draco?" he asked his best mate and watches as Ron's jaw suddenly parted. "I know it's shocking to hear..."
"S'fine." Draco's weight was heavy on him, but he was hesitant to lose it, to have to acknowledge or, Merlin help him, discuss the fact that Draco was in his bed again, much less that he was there with Draco's slowly softening cock still up his arse. He'd much rather bask. He closed his eyes, nuzzling into Draco's hair, smelling the salt and sweat and Citrus that caused his heart to thump in his chest.
Harry told them everything about the truce. But, of course, he left out the secret rooms, the Willow tree, everything concerning and secretive. When he was finished, he bid everyone goodnight, got into his bed, and laid down. He had the dance with Draco, his Silver eyes, his blond hair, his cock, and his smile stuck in his head. Harry fell asleep to the memories of dancing with Draco and those silver eyes.
"Oh, I definitely think so," said Hermione with a strong nod. How did she not see this coming in the first place? Those two have so much chemistry!
Cedric smiled at the oblivious boy in front of him. "Maybe is an understatement, Harry." He knew too well what could happen to the friendship between Harry and Draco if it'd progressed. They had a lot of chemistry; they both just didn't see it. "Have you talked to Ron and Hermione about your sexuality?"
Harry looked back beside him at his adorable jealous boyfriend and nudged him playfully with a cheeky smile and a wink. Why would his boyfriend ever be jealous of Firenze? Harry doesn't even like the centaur. He likes Draco. No, he loves him with all his heart and soul.
The pigman looked her way and quickly ran after her. The Jigsaw doll just continued to cycle up to Draco, Pansy, and Blaise.
"We're really happy for you guys," Ivy corrected her and just wanted to reach over and give them both a hug but knew it would probably be awkward for them. And she'd probably squeeze the air out of them. "How long has this been on for? Weeks? Months? Fortnights? Years?"
"Yeah... hotter than a 30-degree day," Potter said, almost dreamily. Where have his flirting abilities gone? Jesus... The kiss really took his breath away, and words.
His breath smelled of alcohol and his words slurred. Harry backed away as far as possible from his uncle's reaching hands, since he couldn't fit inside the cupboard. The hands inched closer to Harry, so he pressed himself against the wall and covered his face. He didn't know what else to do, he was only three years old. Only three and he never felt so scared in his life.
Hermione smiled and lowered her hand from his mouth. But she was a little wary that he might start up the chatter about Draco. "Alright," she says and pushed the parchment and quill towards Harry more. "I'm going to leave you to write your letter."
"It's the red one, my dears," the Professor said, and she went back to her desk to mark the role and watch over her students for disbelievers in Divination or misbehaving students. Although, she rarely catches anyone misbehaving in her class as she's too focused on her class and Divination.
Harry stood up from the ground and wiped the dirt off his trousers. "Thanksss, again. It was really great meeting you, Ssserpentine."
Harry wrapped his arms around his legs and nodded at the floor. He didn't mind what Draco was doing. All it did to him was make him feel all warm inside and he wants to be closer. "Yeah, it's fine with me," he said coolly as he looked up beside him and met with warm silver eyes. "So, when do we go?"
Draco gave a sad smile as their eyes locked. He practically came out to Harry, and then kind of didn't. That's okay though. "Harry, you're a really incredible guy who I love getting to know even more every day," he said and just hopes Harry believes him. It took a very long time for Ivy to believe everything he says, almost an entire month but he got there in the end. Now he knows he needs to help Harry. "Ivy and Pansy are warming up to you too. Your dorm mates all love and care for you. Our professors all do too though it might not feel like it. We all love and care for you. Know that I and all your friends are here for you and we will never leave you. You're the best thing that has happened to us all. You're important to all of us in our own ways."
With that he turned around and walked towards the doors of the great hall. When he got closer to the doors he noticed that they were closed and most certainly locked but before he could start to wonder about how he should get out, his magic opened the doors before him and he walked out past them. Inside there was heard gasps of disbelief at the show of magical power. On his way past the tables his eyes locked with a certain blonde haired wizard the concern clear in his eyes.
"Yes headmaster, listen to Karkaroff. I shouldn't be allowed to compete. I don't want to compete to be honest I would really just rather watch. I mean this just called for a disaster don't you reckon? I mean for all we know a death eater could be portraying one of the teachers and be planning to kill me at the end of the year" Harry sent Dumbledore a smirk while the students from Hogwarts laughed, they all know what kind of trouble found Harry every year. Nobody missed the way Professor Moody choked on his Pumpkin juice and Harry sent him a look full of amusement when he noticed.
“Harry my boy we need you to compete, let's go to my office and talk” Dumbledore turned around and gave a nod to the professors table indicating that they should follow him and Harry to his office. The teachers went out of their entrance and Dumbledore was almost out of the great hall when he heard the snickers from the students. He turned around only to realise that he was alone, Harry didn’t follow him, instead Harry sat down at the table and started eating.
When they turned a corner on their way to the great hall they could hear these small footsteps getting closer and closer. They didn't really pay any attention to it. When they got close to the great hall they let go and Harry slipped back into his seat next to Ron and Hermione.
my dear friend drew this lovely picture of Dumbledore and Harry's nice little " walk" around hogwarts. Thank you so much you are a gift sent from heaven, let's all applause her in the comment.
"Eh, no, I didn't, sir" the look the headmaster sent him would make most witches and wizards squirm, but when you have been trash talked every year since starting the school, you kind of form an immunity to that kind of looks.
"Harry Potter i need you to come up here" the headmaster said again waving with the note that just a few minutes before had been spat out of the Goblet of fire. Harry looked at the headmaster with a very confused look on his face, then he understood.
The headmaster took a hold of Harry's collar and pulled him up. Gasps were heard all around the great hall.
"oh fuck no, are you FUCKING KIDDING ME" Harry looked the headmaster in the eyes but when he saw no comfort or reinsurance he looked down at Ron and hermione for comfort or reinsurance but they looked just as confused and hopeless as he felt.
The Noise in the great hall quieted down in a matter of seconds and all eyes were on the boy. The boy however were so invested in a conversation with his best friend Ron Weasley that he don't notice at first.
Harry turned around and buried his face in the boys neck. The older boy took the younger boy in a hug and together they sat on the floor as they have done for a long time. No words were spoken between them for a long time as they sought comfort in each others arm's.
When Dumbledore noticed, the students gave up on being discreet and laughed out loud. Harry continued to eat and even tried to start a conversation with the people next to him, but they were all too busy laughing. Then all of a sudden, Harry was floating above the tables and moving towards Dumbledore. The characteristic twinkle Dumbledore always has in his eyes is now completely gone and replaced with an angry flair in his eyes.
Harry walked around the castle with no place in mind for what felt like hours. When he stopped it had become dark outside. As he stopped walking he noticed that he was at the top of the astronomy tower. He walked to the edge of the tower and looked down so deep in his thoughts that he didn't notice another person walking up behind him.
The headmaster was so surprised that he ended the spell without thinking about it, luckily Viktor Krum was there and catched him.
“I think I will risk it” Harry managed to get rid of Fleur and slither out of the office, once again leaving the room in a mix of silence and shock.
"no no no no no" Harry's voice were nothing more than a whisper at this point. If you looked close enough you could see his magic beginning to grow. Normally Harry could control his magic but right now he didn't care if he ended up blowing the entire to pieces. He was tired of landing in trouble.
"My money is on Moody" Harry winked to Him and the students laughed even harder. If only Harry knew how accurate it was. If only…
"So, who are you guys going to the Yule with?" Harry then asked and pouring himself a glass of orange juice. If he can't eat, then he may as well drink something that will go down into his stomach and stay there. He's better filled with fluids than with chunky foods that can come back up.
"Bring your friend over here," the Bulgarian told him with a simple gesture of a wave. "She must sit vith you or you von't be able to sit vith us."
Narcissa walked in, wearing an elegant white and black flowy dress. She sat on the armchair in front of her husband's study desk. "Hello, dear," she said and pushed a lock of hair behind her ears. "How are you doing this fine morning?"
Harry flashed a smile, a light blush crept up his face at the way Draco was looking at him and holding him in his arms. It was in a loving way, and Harry felt millions of butterflies' flap around inside his stomach, and his heart hammer against his chest. "Thanks, Draco," he said a little shyly. "See you soon." He let go of the hug and stared into Draco's silver eyes, not losing eye contact. He looked away with a blush, went the other way and headed to the Gryffindor tower.
He sliced the blade across his skin, again and again. Every new cut was deeper than the other. Until he made five, he felt satisfied. The guilt, sadness and depression had bled out of him and the wave of numbness hit him hard. He continued to watch the blood pour down his arm into the sink, staining the white sink with his scarlet blood. He feels more clear-minded. It is like his mind is back in his body and everything is in clear focus. It was weird and he wondered what else cutting can do.
He first pressed his nose to the Slytherin's cock, smelling his musky scent and inhaling more like his boyfriend's dick is a lovely smelling flower. He sticks his tongue out, grabs the base of Draco's cock, and licks up from where his nose was pressed until he reached the head, then he opened his mouth over the head and took in three or four inches of his boyfriend's length.
Hermione gave Draco a quizzical look. Was she allowed to let him into the common room? Well, Harry did say that he stayed with Draco in the Slytherin dorms last night. "I don't know if I'm allowed to let people from other houses into our common room. But, oh well." She shrugged. "We always break the rules somehow." She leaned closer to the portrait and whispered the password. The portrait then opened up.
Draco was surprised at the Durmstrang students for sitting at the Slytherin table. It was exciting because Viktor Krum was there too, the legendary Quidditch Star.
He cried out as the first kick landed in his side. Harry looked up and saw the gleaming, evil, red eyes of Uncle Vernon, his teeth grew sharper and his laugh rang out through the house, ten times louder than normal. His uncle's features began to change, until suddenly Ron was standing over him with his hand raised for another strike. Harry screamed and covered his face. He screamed until he felt someone shaking him awake.
"Honestly, mate, it's so unnatural," said Ron, and he wrinkled his nose with disgust. He hated himself for saying this, especially to his mate who he knows likes guys. He's seen Harry kiss Malfoy. If that doesn't scream gay, then what will? "Just the thought of it makes me want to vomit. It's all freakish and all. I don't know who the first poof in this world was, but they managed to carry the disease with them."
"Mm-hmm... You forgot to take her when you left 12 Grimmauld place before Christmas," Hermione said disappointedly, crossing her arms over her chest to show how pissed she was. "You were lucky we had the integrity to look after her."
Harry flew down onto the stands and sat next to Draco, placing his broom beside him and tucked his hands under his legs. "Oh," he said, a little intrigued about these places Draco has. He pondered if only Draco knows of these places. "Are these places very secretive or like under a tree?"
Draco blinked and looked at down at her. "What?" he asked blankly with no expression on his face except for a little smile. Tonight's going to be a night he will remember forever and not just because he got to taste Harry, he got to have his first dance with him, spend time with him alone, give him little kisses and hugs.
"Do you have to?" Draco mumbled to his boyfriend, stuffing his nose in the crook of Harry's neck. He actually wanted a shower too just to feel refreshed otherwise he just can't sleep at all. "Fine, and I'll have my shower after you."
"I can do that," Harry says in an almost dreamy tone as he tries to focus on the task of getting up off Draco instead of basking in this new pleasurable feeling Draco gave him. He eventually gets up from the Slytherin's waist, though he wants to stay there. It's just the feel of Draco's hard cock underneath his arse. It's turning him on, and he wants to be turned on by Draco.
Neville noticed Harry seemed a little down, which he has been seeing a lot lately. He gave Harry a little tap on the shoulder and Harry flinched at the sudden gesture and smiled back at him. Neville knew that was a forced smile as he knew them well. Even he lets out a few fake smiles here and there. He wanted to ask if everything's okay, but the professor interrupted him by talking.
"And Harry," Ron added, looking blankly at his best mates' empty bed. He hoped his best mate was all right. He hasn't seen him in a couple of hours. "Should we go find them?"
"What?" Ron said loudly with his arms raised and trying to sound innocent. It was an accident after all. He never meant to transform Malfoy into a ferret and send him away to who knows where. It wasn't his fault either that he became distracted by the latest holiday he and his family had been to in Australia.
Harry paused as he heard the doorbell ring. He spat out the toothpaste, gathered some water in his mouth and spat it out. He cleaned his toothbrush and rushed out of the bathroom, down the stairs and towards the front door. He checked himself out in the mirror just a few meters away from the door, looked at his teeth and nodded in approval.
"Very True," Hermione said, nodding while mirroring Pansy's smile. She started walking towards the door of the Great Hall as she wants to get into her warm bed as soon as possible. "C'mon Harry, we better get going before Ron gets impatient."
Draco ran his finger over the carvings on his wooden desk until an interesting looking carving with initials caught his eye. "Good. I really don't want to lose her, she's like a sister to me," he said and studied this initial carved inside a heart. "I've told her everything including my crush which you also know of," he said as he recognized the initials of the carving in a heart shape. The initials were J+L in a carved heart, Draco recognized it as James + Lily, Harry's parents. "Pansy!" He pointed to the initials inside the heart, completely forgetting about the heart on his parchment. "Look at these initials!"
Draco waved a hand at him of dismissal and opened his potions book up to the required page. "Let's get started," he said and watches as Harry got up to stand next to him at the dressing table. He really hopes this potion does the trick and helps Harry out. Food is supposed to go down and not come back up. It's what gives everyone nutrients and energy to get up and do what they must to live.
"A wizard? Like Albussss Dumbledore?" Serpentine asked, looking up at him and finding the human's hand felt really nice on his skin.
Harry had to carry all the shopping bags in himself since he wasn't there to put the shopping bags in the car. What a "great" day it's been. As the last shopping bags were carried in, and he locked the car up and placed the keys on the kitchen table, Harry rushed up to his bedroom, grabbed his blade and went to the bathroom on the other side of the hall.
"I think... the third year?" Harry sounded unsure. "I mean, did you see how he transformed over the summer? From this little rich snob to... this incredibly hot handsome little ferret."
"I'd love to spend the holidays with you, Draco," Harry said, staring down at a single blade of grass out of millions around him that slightly moved with the little breeze of the June Spring Weather.
Harry looked back up at the two older males. As if Cedric knew Harry had been staring, he gestured Harry to come over. At least it is nice to know that people want to talk to him. Well, Cedric wants to talk to him.
Harry didn't like what he was hearing. Punished for acting a certain way? That was bad. It reminded him of times at the Dursleys and the beatings he'd get but he knew he deserved them. "I understand," he told him. "Just, don't go too far and please do not insult my friends too much. Insult me, I can easily take them. I'm used to it." That last two sentence was a big ass lie but he will take insults just for Draco if that is really what should happen.
Draco walked over to the Quidditch pitch and watched as the figure of Harry came nearer. He went inside one of the Slytherin stands where everyone would be when watching Quidditch games in the Quidditch pitch and just sat there watching Harry fly. He was truly amazing on his broom. Although, the pants Harry was wearing seemed a little tight. He blushed; wondering why he was thinking of Harry's pants and how tight they were. He chuckled at himself and continued watching Harry fly around the pitch.
"Let's go and owl it to her," said Harry with a smile towards Draco. The smile is only at Draco because he loved how nice Draco was being with spending his money on someone else's needs. "It will probably reach her by Breakfast tomorrow morning."
Harry felt someone sit down next to him, and he could smell that captivating scent of citrus and vanilla. He could see the whiteish blonde hair from the corner of his eye, and how perfect and styled it looked.
Draco sighed. He knows he should tell Harry since he's right next to him but not if he's going to stutter like an idiot. And it's even harder when you're heart's beating like a drum too. "I know... It's just hard to because I either keep messing up my words or I say something stupid."
Harry sat there in silence watching his two best friends, Hermione reading a book and Ron continuing to look at his dress robes in disgust. He hugged his legs and leaned his head on the wall, wishing he could just go to sleep for a while as his cuts burn on his arm. His scar had also been hurting due to the dreams he's been having, the same dreams over and over again. It was getting to the point where he just wanted to go to sleep forever and not wake up. He'd be asleep at the Dursley's, they probably wouldn't care if he died in his sleep. Just another burden lost to the world.
"Ron!" Harry and Hermione shouted furiously at Ron and what he had done to their fellow classmate. They and everyone else in the room were panicking, except Snape as he was finding this amusing. But on the downside, his favourite student had gone missing.
Harry shook his head, knowing this was an only one-way question game. You can't ask two questions at once in this game. Not that he knows of anyway. "One question at a time. Fred, Truth or Dare."
"I believe we should go now," said Harry, and he brings his hands down to intertwine one with Draco's. he really doesn't want Hermione worrying about his whereabouts. But she's probably dancing with Viktor or Pansy. "Can I just ask..." He flushed a little at the question he wanted to ask his boyfriend. "Was that your first time giving and receiving a... blowjob?"
Harry shook his head, he never thought about doing that. But he couldn't help but think about what if they weren't there? What if they were at the Manor in Wiltshire? "I guess not, but I will try though. Thank you kindly, Professor."
"We need to get the professors!" hollered Ron, who's eyes still remained staring at the blood puddle on the floor. If that were Ginny that the Nun took, he wouldn't ever forgive himself. Or even Hermione, wherever she was.
Ron stood leaning on the stone wall on the staircase. "I'd like to apologize for my behaviour these past few months," he started with a lopsided smile. He knew Harry and Draco didn't believe him but he had to tell them everything he could. "I've been a terrible mate, believing homosexuality was bad and not normal." He looked at the two boys, but his eyes stopped when seeing Harry." It's all my fault and I was stupid enough to believe Percy's biased opinions. So, I'm really sorry."
Harry walked into the common room behind Draco and Ivy, memories still fresh in his mind from the second year. The common room was exactly how he remembered it. Long and Low, green lanterns hanging from the stone ceiling, black and green furniture, gigantic arched windows looking into the black lake, skull candles on every black architecture table and a fire burning in the ginormous fireplace. It was nothing like the Gryffindor Tower he was used to being in. He followed the two Slytherins to a familiar set of black lounge chairs while Blaise seemed to disappear behind them. Harry stared at the lounge chairs before him, Draco sat on the same one he did in the second year and Ivy sat on the other.
Harry nodded, walked arm in arm with Draco under the invisibility cloak. He made sure they couldn't be seen like if the cloak slipped up and showed one of their feet and made their way to the Dungeons. Before they were even halfway to the dungeons, Draco stopped and faced the library. "Actually, could we stop in the library's secret place? I'd like to store my broom there."
Hermione replayed the last minute in her head, hoping it's real. The look on Harry's face, the dreamy look, told her that it is real and she's so proud of her best friend. "Oh, golly, Harry!" She cupped her hand over her mouth in surprise and then gave Harry a big side hug. "Tell me everything!"
He shifted his hips upward as Harry's hands gripped the waistband of his underwear and tugged them down, exposing his erection, then his thighs. He could feel Harry's eyes on him. It was like they burned a path into him, but the burn was inside, not on the surface. Just the thought that he might soon know the pleasure of Harry's tongue licking his slit and the feel of the soft wetness of his mouth along his shaft made a heavy bead of clear fluid ooze out of him and hang suspended for a second before it fell in a steady trickle and puddled in his boxers.
Harry smiled at the question and yawned. He yet again slept like a baby last night. "It's just a figure of speech, Draco," he said as he reached up and rubbed Draco's chest. When doing so he felt something a little hard on his lower stomach. "But I am pretty sure they do have a smell but only to predators."
Harry groaned from under the blankets. It's too early for this! He thought as he got up and looked around for some clean clothes.
"What if Adam and Steve really liked each other?" Ron asked him sadly, and his brows gathered in. What if they fell in love with each other? "This feels like one of those stories mom reads to Ginny. About those weird lovey-dovey stories with a prince and a princess."
She then suddenly got an idea. It was a good idea too which she knows will work. It just has to. Harry looked confused at her and scared for what Ivy might make him do. Then she spat out what she's been wanting to say. Or what she wants Harry to do. "Harry, I dare you to kiss him."
Mad eye moody smirked at the boy and made the spider flew towards himself, landing on his desk. "Ah, it seems we have a celebrity in the classroom. Harry James Potter."
Harry gave Draco's hand a little squeeze and moved them forwards into a waltz, not looking away from mesmerizing silver eyes as they waltzed around the garden. This was the part of the day he was most excited for. Dancing with Draco.
"Nope," said Savannah and Mike who both grinned. After Timothy gave the two back the red balls, Savannah reached into her robe pocket, taking out a yellow-blue ball which Harry only saw, and threw it to the ground. Thick yellow and blue smoke rose up from where Savannah and Mike were and everyone in the room was just stunned at what they witnessed. When the fog vanished, Savannah and Mike were gone.
Harry grabbed the spider and looked at its legs, it was a daddy long leg spider, so it thankfully wasn't harmful. But still, it was a spider that didn't deserve to die. He felt rather sorry for the spider and wondered what being a spider was like. He shook his head and remembered he had a task to do, he could worry about the life of a spider after the lesson. Carefully and slowly, Harry ripped off its front leg and dropped it in his cauldron. He waited five seconds and took off the other spider's leg and dropped it in watching as it sizzled. After doing the last 5 legs of the spider, he grabbed the body and dropped it in the middle of the liquid, watching as it sizzled, popped and the liquid turned see-through.
"So, is the truce back on?" Draco asked immediately, staring at Harry's frown, and pondering what's going on in Harry's life that brings a frown upon that beautiful face of his. He wants to know why Harry looks so down all the time, and every single day. In his third year, Harry seemed happier. He remembers that clearly.
Ron and the other Gryffindors split up to look for their professors, Harry, and Dean. But, of course, because of what they saw, they had three people with them. Ron had Seamus and Neville with him, while the other girl's and guys of Gryffindor split up into their own groups.
Harry walked back over to his friends and Draco and gave a little smirk. It wasn't fun, nor was it pleasant. And the man smelt a lot like herbs and spices. "I honestly thought he would smell bitter, but he really smells like spices," he whispered to them, interlocking his hand with Draco's again.
Harry saw the snitch flying straight towards the Slytherin Quidditch stands. He kept at it, knowing he had only a few feet more. He stretched out his hand and made his Firebolt go faster. The Slytherin Quidditch stands were nearing in front of him and with a final burst, he snatched the snitch from the air. He immediately pulled up and to the right to avoid colliding with the Slytherin stand. He sighed, grateful he took that sharp turn and looked over at Draco.
"Oh nothing, let's just head to the common room," Harry said with a small grin, got up and walked in the direction of the exit. Ron nodded, jogged up to Harry and felt his stomach rumble. When will lunch be? He's hungry.
Harry sighed. The most popular question known to mankind. Nobody can escape it. "Yes," he nodded, smiling slightly at the memory of seeing Malfoy today. He wondered what Fred's reaction would be if he told him who he likes. Amused, disgusted, and shocked, flashed in his mind in bold letters.
"Oww! Stop that, Hedwig! What did I-" Harry knew what he did to deserve the peck. He left Hedwig alone at the Dursleys after that night a week ago. Harry gave Hedwig an apologetic frown, knowing she would have had to find her food on her own. Harry sighed guiltily, feeling his depression come back to him and he read the letters from Hermione, Ron, and Sirius.
Hermione's hand shot right up. She knew the spell of course. Why wouldn't she? She always reads about spells and potions before the actual term starts.
"I've never felt anything like that before," Draco whispered, seeming reluctant to speak louder and break the heady atmosphere. "Sex with you is incredible, Harry," he said with the shyest smile. "You're incredible," he finished, settling his head back into the cushions and closing his eyes again. Harry imagined he could feel his heart pumping the blood around his body, infusing it with the love he was drowning in.
After they were dressed, Draco made sure to store his citrus flavoured hair gel on the bottom of his trunk. He still went to the bathroom with his second hair gel to Style his hair before going down to the kitchen arm in arm with Harry.
Draco smiled back at Harry and nodded, a flutter in his heart intensifying from the smile Harry gave him. I want to get her something. Either to chat with each other or... Something else."
Whenever Draco did talk to Harry, Harry would just be nodding sadly and replying numbly with 'Yeah' and 'I'm fine'. Draco didn't believe those words. Just by looking at Harry, he could tell how depressed he was. He's tried getting Harry to talk about anything that's bothering him, but Harry just keeps saying that he is fine and that there is nothing to talk about. The only way he can help Harry is if Harry lets him, but Harry's been ignoring everyone, even Ron and Hermione. Harry wouldn't pay attention in his classes, even if it was the last week of school and Professor Snape kept snapping at him which Draco knew only worsened Harry's state.
After a few seconds of staring at the Gryffindor and Slytherin, Theodore left them be and whispered to Blaise, "C'mon, mate. We should get ready."
Narcissa gave her son a nod of assurance. She was so pleased to have such an amazing son who loves her dearly and cares for her as much as she cares for him. "I will, promise. Now, you two best be off, I don't want to keep you waiting."
"Mm-Hmm," said Blaise in the kiss with Neville, and Neville's blush was only darkening which made Dean and Harry chuckle at him.
Licking his lips, he reaches up to the waistband of Harry's boxers and pulled them down until a cock jumped out of the boxers, startling him a little. Breathing heavily, he calmed his racing heart with a few deep breaths. Then he grabs Harry's length, steadying it with his hand, and he licks at the velvety head. He gatheres the pre-come onto his tongue and leaves it there for a moment before swallowing it down. He does it again as he wants more.
they watched Narcissa head off to the other side of the hallway and disappear. "That was a quick greeting," Harry said, looking around the light-filled kitchen. The windows were lowered enough that you could see the red and white rose bush just outside.
Joslyn laughed even harder; she couldn't believe what was happening to her. She remembered watching the first Harry Potter film a month ago for the twelfth time, remembering younger Draco saying the exact same thing but to Ron. "No, No. Sorry," she said, grinning and shaking her head. "I'm Joslyn, Joslyn Carlsen."
"It's true!" Harry beamed. "It was the mistletoe, it just popped right out of nowhere. And I wasn't interested in Cho," he added quickly. "I thought I was, but it was actually Cedric I liked."
"Thanks, Neville," said Harry gratefully with a small smile and it lit up his face. If Draco were here, it would have made him melt on the inside. "You're the best." There was yet again, another long moment of silence.
Draco sobbed when Harry started to use his teeth. He could feel them grazing his hardness, barely pressing down against his shaft, but that one sensation multiplied all the others until his groin was a seething mass of physical feelings: lips, tongue, teeth. And eventually, fingers, as Harry raised a hand and circled the bottom of his erection, pulling the skin tight so that his rosy red head vibrated like a drum under each whisper of oral provocation.
"Then let's do it," Draco says, and his voice becomes quieter. He watches as Harry's leaning a little closer, and he looks at his cousin with a little smile. "I did say I would kiss him in the middle of the Great Hall too, didn't I?"
Harry's blush darkens and he swears the colours of his cheeks are tomato red. He leaned in for another kiss, lifting both of his arms around Draco's neck and the Slytherin wrapped his arms around Harry's waist and pulled him in closer. As soon as they felt they needed air, they broke apart, smiled at each other lovingly and walked, hand in hand, towards the gazebo which had another emblem of a badger. They both placed their wands on the table and sat down on the wooden chair under the gazebo, next to each other, Harry laying his head on Draco's shoulder.
"We don't know, Blaise," said Pansy, whose eyes were soft, and she comforted him by squeezing his shoulder.
"They're speaking in cousin," said Blaise and he walked forward to stand between Harry and Ron. He leaned back a bit to put snowballs on their heads just for fun and it seemed that the two Gryffindor's didn't notice or feel it. "I don't know what they're talking about either. Neither does Pansy at times so we just let them talk."
As much as he hated the insufferable git, he really did believe he was quite handsome. Who wouldn't? That gorgeous blonde hair that seems to never stick out of place, even when playing Quidditch. Those sharp cheek and jawbones that looks so darn kissable. Harry had the sudden thought of kissing the blonde's cheeks, and even on the mouth. He wondered what it'd be like.
"I don't think so," Harry said and shuddered at the thought of having his death predictions come true. Although, he has always wondered what it would be like to die. If there was an afterlife if hell exists or if there's nothing after death? Or if he could see his parents... "Anyway, I need to go to class. Goodbye, Draco."
"Honestly, guys," said Neville and rolled onto his other side to narrow his eyes at his dormmates. He doesn't want to hear any more about their sexual lives. "Please stop talking about this. I don't want images popping into my mind while I am trying to sleep."
"I love you," Harry says quietly to Draco's shoulder as the music gets a little softer, and he leaned his forehead on Draco's shoulder. "You know, the happiest I've ever felt was that moment I discovered you love me too. That was our first real kiss together, and the moment on Christmas day when you asked me out."
Pansy looked up as Nott mentioned Hermione being Bi. She smiled to herself and finished off her breakfast. She hasn't heard from Hermione that she likes girls, but she had her thoughts about it.
Dean raised an eyebrow at the Slytherin and asked, "What about Harry?" He found it curious why Malfoy said Harry's first name instead of 'Potter' like he would normally say. And why would he want to ask about Harry?
"I don't really see him as much as you do, so I wouldn't know," Ivy told him while staring blankly at the sausage roll in her hands as the taste was now getting quite boring. She wished she could eat like everyone else could. "Also, what do you mean changed?"
Draco looked down at the alive twin brother, not knowing which one he was. When he saw the twin look up at him, he frowned and mouthed, 'I'm so sorry'. The twin nodded a thank you and sniffed. Whenever Draco saw one of the Weasleys looking up at him, he just mouthed an apology for their loss of a loved one.
Harry was beaming with excitement the rest of the weekend. He couldn't wait till the date with Draco. Tea with the most spectacular, stunning, handsome guy in the entire world? Merlin, if he said that to his 14-year-old self, his 14-year-old self would laugh in his face. All he did was daydream about the date, what could happen and when he'll have his first kiss with Draco. Of course, he had his first kiss with Ginny, and that was okay. He just wants his other first kiss to be with Draco and he wants to know what it's like, what the other man's lips feel like on his own.
Harry just wanted to lean against Draco and hug him, thanking him but thought that would be a bit much for their new friendship. He would love a hug from Draco but knows he doesn't deserve hugs especially by an attractive guy like Draco. This Slytherin just deserves so much more. Why is he even wasting time with a person like himself? Shouldn't he be with his friends that actually mean something to him?
"Ohhhhhhhhh, who's the guy then?" Seamus asked as he raised an eyebrow, repeatedly poking him on the arm. Now, this was getting intriguing to hear and he wanted to know so much more about the love life of Harry Potter if there is one. Who's this guy Harry has his eyes on, 8and does he know him?
"Maybe we should," Harry says quietly, and he leans down for a kiss, and Draco leans up and connects their lips together and they kiss slowly inside of Draco's bed. Draco's hands come up and they thread and tangle themselves in Harry's messy black hair while the Gryffindor deepens the kiss and slides his hands down the front of Draco's dress robe.
Narcissa just kissed her husband on the cheek and headed down to her bedroom. When she entered, she walked up to her desk, grabbed a red envelope, and started writing her own letter to her son.
Like meeting up with an old friend after many years apart, it's a bittersweet feeling that he knows by heart, and it doesn't really hurt now but he
