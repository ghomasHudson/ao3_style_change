The night he finds Malfoy sitting in the seventh-floor corridor outside the Room of Requirement is the first week back from holidays and it gives him a sense of overwhelming déja vu. It's two am and that's another one of the spots he's been avoiding, but this particular circumstance seems like the right one to go face it. Besides, he sort of feels like seeing Malfoy. He hasn't since the forest last month.
"You know what I mean." He didn't. Couldn't, really. "I just can't stop ... thinking about it? But that's why I'm telling you. That's how atonement works, right? You confess, it goes away?"
“Do I … what?” Harry responds, blinking owlishly. “I — I mean … not as much as Hermione. What are you getting at?”
“Roqberry’s fine,” says Draco. He vanishes the rest of his coffee, and elbows Granger as he does because she’s looking all smug around a mouthful of lettuce. “Their breakfast blend is terribly bitter.”
He lets the air out of his lungs and looks at Malfoy, trying to decipher what's going on in his head. The shock seems pretty genuine, which. That feels good, at least.
"How the fuck do you sleep," says Draco, running a hand through his mussed hair, "with all that racket?"
Harry feels vaguely vexed, and confused, and terribly charmed. “What?” he says. And then, when Draco does nothing but laugh some more, “
overpriced, or c) a total shitehole. Malfoy is there a lot. He sits behind the bar when Blaise is working and reads. He sits at the bar when Pansy is working and chats. He sniffs and tosses his blond head when he sees Harry, and pretends he isn’t there.
, which looks ridiculous between the two of them and would have sent Harry into a fit of laughter had he been in the mood for laughing. “You’re
acquiescent. While his magic leads the plates to the kitchen he grabs Malfoy's wine glass from right out of his hand, hyper-aware of their fingers sliding together for less than a second. He brings it into the kitchen with him and even finds the new bottle of wine, but he doesn't fill it and he certainly doesn't send it back. He starts magicking the dishes into the sink instead, and wonders how long it'll take Malfoy to realise he's not coming back with his drink.
Draco told Harry he was hesitant to bring anything of Wiltshire into his new flat. He wanted a good, proper, fresh start. But “it felt criminal to leave it, you know? It’s so beautiful. And I knew it would look even better on my floorboards”. Harry knows he’s not an arbiter or style, or whatever (hence; Draco choosing all of his outfits for every event no exceptions since they started dating) but he thinks Draco was right. The rug is very nice.
No, Harry hadn’t blasted them out of Bellatrix’s vault in a paroxysm of wandless magic. Hermione didn’t discover the location of the fourth Horcrux by deciphering some Ancient Runes. But yeah, they camped in a tent in the Forest of Dean. Yeah, Ron destroyed the locket with the sword, and Hermione the cup with a Basilisk fang.
"You've been here all night, haven't you?" she says knowingly as she sits down beside him with her salad. "Your coffee looks blacker than usual."
“Oh,” Draco sighs. Harry’s touch is gentle, but he can still feel the tender pull of fresh bruising beneath it. “Of course you do.”
Arm draped across Draco’s body, head half-buried in a pillow with his mouth next to Draco’s ear, still deeply sated from a proper fuck, Harry can’t imagine a more complete contentedness.
"Enough," Hermione snaps, feeling frustratingly close to tears. She and Ron haven't fought this way since before she got pregnant. "
Harry pulls at a loose thread in his jumper. He should have thought of this before, but it really hadn’t occurred to him until their last (now compulsory) Muggle Studies class.
Draco sighs. He draws his legs together, trapping Harry’s ankle between his own two. “No, you don’t.”
Raising one shoulder, Draco says, "Whatever you want. Keep shagging the She-Weasel. Don't. Just stop forcing the image upon me before it scalds my retinas."
“You’re such a cunt,” Draco spits, twisting around in Harry’s grip to try and get more friction on his cock. “You’re a fucking cunt.”
to, Ron. Do you get it? It's, like, physically nauseating trying to convince myself not to go see him again, over and over."
Draco smiles wickedly. "When I'm kissing you," he says, "are you wishing I was Snape? I could stop conditioning my hair, if that helps."
A small lump rises in Harry's throat and he feels a huge swell of affection for Draco, part of him wanting to laugh and the other to cry. "Your dad's a prick," says Harry. He moves some hair off Draco's forehead and thumbs over his cheekbone. "But he's still your dad, so I think you're allowed to miss him anyway. You used the word 'temporary' when you first told me — d'you think they'll get over it?"
Taking the hint (and rolling her eyes fondly), Pansy indulges him and begins moving her fingers through his hair, damp a bit on the ends, using her nails to scratch his scalp. It makes her stomach hurt — perhaps 'clear mutual dislike' isn't quite accurate. If it was she'd hardly be so apprehensive about this rekindling of his Potter flame.
George’s always been perpetually droll, but since Fred died his humour has taken on this kind of satiric self derision that’s very dry and often makes Mum look anxious.
"You two are exceptionally dull," Blaise tells them. It's not a tragedy or anything — there are plenty of people in his club he can get off with. Bit of a shame, though. He'd been rather in the mood for some quality time with his two oldest friends. "Don't let him fuck Potter. And you don't fuck him either, you utterly depraved twat."
“Draco, no,” Pansy says quickly, shooting up from her chair to grab his arm and feeling bad suddenly, especially when it’s shaken off. “Come on, you know I’m only teasing you, why are you so worked up about this?”
Draco's opening his mouth to protest when a waitress approaches. Two single malt whiskeys, a gin and tonic, two of the Otoro and a Katsuo, hold the daikon, please leave, thank you, and Blaise turns his attention back to Draco.
Taking a few steps down to where Malfoy is, Harry’s inebriation robs him of boundaries and he stands close enough he can smell him. “I shouldn’t have said it,” he says. “I feel bad.” And then another thing Malfoy said finally processes and he furrows his eyebrows. “Why don’t you have your wand?”
Nodding, Harry turns and reaches to unclasp his belt too-eagerly and tug at his zip, painfully hard beneath his jeans. Completely unable to wrap his head around what’s about to happen.
“Okay,” she says. And he knows he’s fucked up, that she’ll prod later, but he’ll deal with that when it comes. For now he opens the portrait and pretends to tie his shoelace to give Draco time to clamber out, then follows.
"I'm not the one inventing things!" Harry yells before Malfoy's even gotten his last word out. He doesn't want to explain that whatever Malfoy had said to Hermione had caused her to use words like 'toxic' and 'unhealthy' and fret over his mental health, and it hadn't felt that way in the lift. Not lovely or tender, maybe, but at least
“What makes you say that?” Harry frowns. Because the only people in the world who know about the Horcruxes are Ron and Hermione and him, and that’s an unexpected amount of confidence from someone who’d relentlessly bullied him for so long.
During the war, when Voldemort had occupied the Manor, Draco hardly saw his father. Once, in the weeks they knew he was coming, he came across him stooped in his mum's arms. She was rubbing circles on his back, thin and fragile in the way she'd always been but looking so much bigger than her husband. It was the first time Draco had ever seen his father that way — misshapen and trembling. He didn't like it when Lucius spat at him or hexed him, but he liked this far less.
"You're not evil incarnate, Malfoy," he says, and takes another step towards him. "You're, like, evil's little sideshow. If I want you, it's only because it would be an absolute pleasure to put you in your place for once."
Harry’s chest feels oddly tight suddenly, but not necessarily in the bad way. Maybe tightness is the wrong word. In fact he feels distinctly short of breath. And warm. In a short and surreal sequence of movements, he checks his watch, notes that it’s almost three, and then looks back down at Malfoy, meeting his eyes. Fucking shit.
The second time they spoke was in Potions, when Harry said, “How do you get your Shrivelfig so finely chopped?” and Malfoy said, “Use a sharper knife.”
Shit, it feels good, like some incredible release that’s been building and building, and he hasn’t even come yet. Draco winces a little when Potter fucks deeper into him. “Cause,” he says, then moans and drops his head into the crook of his bent elbow, “I’m pristine.”
Draco’s hand twitches when Potter mentions his wand. He shifts it back under his thigh. “You’re welcome, then.”
It takes about fifteen minutes, but Rose finally falls asleep in her crib upstairs and when Harry returns to the kitchen, Malfoy's not there anymore. He finds him instead in the living room with a book, looking uncomfortably soft.
, with painful determination — not to be annoyed or upset by Malfoy’s curtness. Yes, it’s annoying. It’s very upsetting. He’s a huge git. But Harry’s not a teenager anymore, and one of his brand new adult coping skills is the art of compartmentalisation. Or it would be, if he was any good at it.
“Don’t fret, Potter. It’ll give you wrinkles,” says Draco, reaching up to give him a delicate flick on the top of his scar.
Granger's knock is neat and sensible, like those ghastly shoes she was wearing last time Pansy saw her at the pub. The
Draco studies Potter’s face. His mouth is a hard line, and he looks vexed, still, but not like he’s lying. “I don’t know how to talk to you, though,” he says. “If you don’t hate me.”
Thus began his confrontation of the tower, and this itself began with nightly visits, each time a step further into the curved parapet. The first few times he'd stood at the balustrade, Draco had seen shadows of silvery robes collapsed at the tower's foot, and had bile rise in his throat. That was about two weeks ago.
There are certain places in the castle Harry likes to avoid. At first it had been the Great Hall, but he’d overcome that one pretty quickly seeing as he needed to eat. The corridor near the Room of Requirement is one. The Forbidden Forest another. And Dumbledore’s tomb.
Draco wishes he could make that promise with any kind of confidence. "I'm not the one who's been hard for the last twenty minutes," Draco says. "Tell me, Potter —
Harry grins. Watches him take another cigarette out, and waits for Malfoy to look at him again. “It’s not a haircut,” he says.
"Think we could've gone the whole year without speaking?" Harry says, putting his hands on the balustrade next him. He glances out at the grounds and then at Malfoy — the same blond hair, the same pointy nose, yet different for all of that. "If I hadn't ruined it just now, I mean."
Well. It’s not what she’d been expecting at all, and suddenly there’s a pit of anxiety in her stomach. She lowers the cup of tea she’d been about to sip.
about the whole thing), he goes to see Ron. Who, yeah, is sort of really biased about Malfoy and might really, literally, non-metaphorically vomit, but it's somehow better than the extreme enthusiasm and support he'd get from Hermione. He's simply not ready for her brand of validation at the moment.
Ron has the good grace to look a little sheepish about that. Hermione had told him, though she only got about halfway in before Ron clapped his hands over his ears, and no amount of scolding him about how he’s a father now and shouldn’t be acting like he’s five literal years old could get him to remove them.
Too busy trying to steady his breathing to speak, Draco simply looks at Potter with a marginally disdainful ‘
Harry is trying to push certain thoughts and memories to the top of the pile. Granger’s face, messes of wrapping paper under a crooked Christmas tree draped in maroon tinsel, kissing Cho Chang beneath high-vaulted ceiling — “Jealous,” Draco snorts — sit in flimsy, fractured layers that can be easily peeled back to reveal those beneath.
“It’s the disparity, don’t you think?” Draco says, and Harry knows the chocolate must’ve done its job if Draco can use words like
Messing up several times first, Harry finally gets the wand back in his pocket and, belly clenching hard again, he rubs his cock up against Malfoy’s arse, repeatedly lettig the head catch at the rim. He’s got no idea if he’s stretched out enough, if there’s enough lube, if it’s fucking stupid not to be using protection, but he doesn’t really fucking care at the moment. He wants to
Until Draco says, “Enough,” managing to sound firm and breathless all at once. “Enough teasing, Potter. Come.”
The third time they spoke was when Hermione and Malfoy started studying together. Hermione asked Harry if he’d like to join them, to which Harry replied that he’d done his homework already. Malfoy raised his eyebrow and said, “Really?”. It was kind of mean, but Hermione laughed.
The blankets are making snuffly little noises, and Draco can see a  pink cheeked face nestled at the centre.
"Let me see if I have this right," she says with a grin that feels as feral as it probably looks. "Potter pinned you face-first to the wall of a stalled lift in your place of work and then fucked you without lube?"
. What was it I said the other day? If it’s a gay crisis you’re having, kindly leave me the fuck out of it?”
It’s three nights later that Harry finally takes the map out to find Draco again and sees him, interestingly enough, in Myrtle’s bathroom. Myrtle’s in there too according to the map, but she’s gone by the time Harry walks in, for which he’s very grateful.
you that, per se," Parvati says in what could almost be called a drawl, which makes Harry frown, "I was only referring to the title in the abstract."
any virtue, Malfoy," Harry says drily. "You're evil down to the core, I can sense it. I truly apologise that you're feeling threatened but seeing as we're trapped in a fucking lift at the moment can I once again suggest simply
Draco's been told, often, that he has an awful habit of speaking before he thinks. "I don't know about Gryffindors, but us Slytherins aren't in the practice of denying ourselves pleasure." Draco wets his bottom lip. "To paraphrase, Potter; do it, then."
She grabs her bag from the kitchen counter and looks around, as if something she's missing will present itself to her.
“Glad to know you were paying attention, Potter,” says Malfoy. He catches the eye of one of the bartenders and gestures expansively.
Harry lets out a breathless laugh. To have reduced Draco Malfoy to a fumbling, half-delirious mess on the very
Harry removes the hand that’s wound delicately around Draco’s neck, but he moans and shakes his head at that, so Harry releases his hip instead.
Harry stands and lets Hermione take Rose from him, rolling his eyes a bit when she apologises to him the same way as her infant daughter.
Pansy had nagged him, though. And Potter would be there. An entirely neutral environment where Draco would be able to be observed being unbothered and aloof and making out with much fitter blokes, but not approached. So it didn't end up taking too much nagging, after all.
The soft milky whiteness of his midriff would have been bad enough on its own, but Harry barely has the brain power to admire it (or imagine touching it) thanks entirely to the small silver hoop adorning Malfoy’s infuriatingly perfect little belly button. It’s covered up again too quickly but the image of it is burned into Harry’s vision.
, and you won’t admit it, because attraction to the evil incarnate would be such a terrible stain on your sparkling morality.”
He sits down next to Malfoy and, surprising himself, takes out the map and hands it over. He doesn't see why he shouldn't — he'll be gone from Hogwarts after this term, and it's not like there's any real trouble to get up to anymore. "I only used it this time. And it
Harry finally stops smirking and stays silent a moment, just watching Malfoy, thinking, contemplating. Finally, he says, “What the hell just happened? Is it my imagination or didn’t we fuck, like, twenty minutes ago?”
Harry waits in the cold when Charlie goes inside to say hi to his family, with his joint and his his light jacket and his glasses constantly fogging up, and when Charlie comes back out he nods towards the broom shed. “Let’s do it,” he says, and he offers the joint out. “You want?”
Draco has reconciled himself to being rather alone, and he thinks strangely of how Pansy would call self-pitying bullshit if he ever expressed this aloud. Perhaps, it is. Draco says, “If you get my wand back, I’ll blow you so hard you’ll die.” A moment of thought, he adds, “Properly.”
He avoids Hermione's eye and lets Neville give him a slice of the treacle tart (technically it does taste better than Malfoy's arse, but in other, more important ways, it really doesn't) before going to plop himself down next to Dean.
The lift is surely about to open: he’d only been on his way to Magical Ailments and Diseases on the second floor, he needs to get a grip, but all he can fucking think of is the when and the how and the please of getting Potter back inside him long enough to unwind the knot behind his navel, his ribs.
“I tried to slap him,” says Draco. He still doesn’t really feel bad about it, just a bit funny behind his ribs.
Harry digs it out again and hands it over, then goes back to work getting his cock out and biting back a noise when he gets a hand around himself and squeezes the base.
If Ron had known in sixth year that Harry would end up shagging Malfoy and becoming obsessed with him all over again, he doesn’t think it would’ve come as that much of a surprise. He would never tell Harry this, because Ron’s pretty sure he would find it completely humiliating. But yeah. The parallels between then and now make his stomach hurt, a bit.
-minding?" Pansy echoes, completely taken aback. She lets out a surprised laugh, which snowballs into something loud and ringing and gets a chuckle out of Blaise before finally tapering off. "Oh, don't be silly, Draco, you've no affinity for children. Come," she ushers them both towards the door, "you can tell us who you were shagging on the way out. I'm thinking seafood, what about you, Blaise?"
Lucius was never so cruel (to others, certainly, but not to Draco) before the end of the war. When he was a child, his father would take him to the lake on the edge of the Manor's property and enchant little balls of soft, wavering light to flicker out of the water. Draco never saw Lucius twirling his wand behind his back — he thought there were magical, shimmery fish living in the lake until he was eleven.
Grinning, Harry says, “My pleasure.” He kisses Draco again and then helps him zip back up, using his wand to spell his trousers and the floor clean. “Starting tomorrow you can do the cleanup now.”
"Of course," Harry says. Close to salivating, he palms the outline of Malfoy's cock and watches him carefully. Ideally, he'd like to see him break. "Silly of me. You
"Yeah, only now I'm traumatised," Ron says. Sulks. "Please tell me he's at least like, fuck, got a really small prick or something. Actually, don't. Bloody don't. No details, ever, and you can give Rose her bottle. I need my hands so I can start pulling my hair out."
“Ah, but would an egotist sacrifice his life for other people?” Harry says with a shit-eating grin. Draco’s very close, in his bed. He’s all Harry can smell. “I think not. I died, remember? Exempt from being an egotist.”
. It's because he's incredibly horny for Malfoy and had gotten it in his head he might be able to fuck him properly next time they saw each other, on
Very funny. Very very funny. “Ha ha,” Draco says. “Leave my tea alone, Potter. I’ve been kind enough not to comment on the appalling state of your hair.”
“That’s it,” Pansy says, moving her hand reverently along the artful curve of the boy’s arse who she’s buried in. Well, the
Potter, with a deep red flannel rolled up to the elbow and sufficiently less scrawny than the last time Draco saw him, looking like he’s one well placed barb away from dishing out a good-and-proper thumping is. Satisfying. Kind of. Perhaps, Draco might even venture to call it arousing, was Potter not the worst.
It's not the first Harry's heard of Ginny's aversion to having kids and he's quite proud of her for the dedication she has to her ambitious goals. He'll watch her in the Quidditch World Cup someday soon, he's absolutely sure of it. Molly won't like the lack of offspring, but then again, it's not as if she's
Draco isn’t the same spoilt, petulant child he once was. Really. He (usually) doesn’t cry when he doesn’t get what he wants. He (usually) refrains from stomping his foot when he’s particularly annoyed. He can (most of the time) keep his voice at an even temper, avoid that pettish whine that served him so well between the ages of five and fifteen.
it is, having to share Charlie with the whole family. “Definitely. Erm — I’ll be. Yeah. Out here.” He takes a joint from behind his ear. “Don’t take too long.”
“Spent seven years of my young life learning from the best. Ta, Harry Potter,” he says, and clinks his wine glass against Potter’s beer with more force than strictly necessary, and watches as some of the frothy amber liquid sloshes over the lip and in rivulets down his hand.
,” he indicates the two of them with a free hand. “And yeah, I was here,” he adds to Hermione. “I came to see you and found him with Rose, screaming her head off. So I calmed her a bit and put her down for a nap and left. I thought he would’ve told you, to be honest.”
Ron looks at her all kind of adoringly, and Charlie decides it's a scene he probably shouldn't interrupt and that he'll say hi to them both later.
He starts to scoff and then realises it's pretty sound logic: he even remembers Hermione mentioning something once about a failsafe in case the hospital ever encountered a large-scale Stifling — like, well,
Charlie’s supposed to be coming tomorrow, on Christmas, but Harry knows he’ll sneak in tonight. He's predictably unpredictable like that.
"Yeah, exactly," says Harry, crossing his arms and leaning back against a sink. "I want to do something with it and I'll have more ... you know, influence, if I'm working at the Ministry." He grins crookedly. "Besides, I'm afraid I'll get all tense and have some kind of allergic reaction if I can't save someone once in a while."
in control of the situation. “You’re a fucking deviant,” Harry informs him. “What’s that make you, then? A
“Do be a lamb and fetch me a refill,” Draco says, in the kind of drawl that would put even his father to shame, holding his wine glass out with lazy fingers. “While you’re up.”
One of the really nice things about dating Ginny had been that she never left Harry guessing what she was thinking, something that had driven him absolutely bonkers with Cho. And Draco — he's kind of like that too, only in a completely different way.
Charlie hasn’t been back home since Rose was born almost a year ago, but Ron had told him about Harry’s rather explosive break up with his girlfriend a few weeks after it happened. From what he heard in the time they were together, Charlie’s never liked the sound of the woman, but he’s tried his best to keep that him to himself.
Harry resettles himself after Draco tries to buck him off, oddly aroused by the show of resistance. “I couldn’t kill someone,” he says truthfully, and he speaks it against Malfoy’s throat like an eroticism rather than the morbidity it really is. He’s achingly hard and grinds his cock down against Malfoy’s, biting back a moan against his skin.
Malfoy cocks his head. Harry almost chokes on his own spit. “What the fuck,” Malfoy says, “is a cab?”
Harry steps out of the Floo into Ron and Hermione’s house and brushes the ash off of the files he’s holding. He doesn’t actually know for sure Hermione’s home but he’d decided to try here just in case, since she can be rather testy while she’s fretting about at work and he doesn’t like to bother her. However, he’s not standing there two seconds before he hears crying from the other room and, resigning himself to Ron rather than Hermione, goes to the kitchen to find neither of his best mates but Draco Malfoy.
“First of all, Pansy,” Draco says, getting up from his chair so he can rant his way through this thing properly. “As there’s
Sounds like classic Lucius Malfoy, though Harry elects not to say that out loud. He also resists asking, scornfully,
Draco doesn't answer, instead hooking a thumb in Harry's waistband to tug it aside and taking his cock in his mouth in one eager slide.
Harry briefly flirts with idea of toying with him but quickly decides not to. There’s nothing he wants more right now than to watch Draco come all over himself and Harry’s hand, so he spits in his palm and redoubles his efforts, sucking hard on the skin of Draco’s throat that’s so easily-bruisable. “Are you gonna come for me?” he says just beneath his ear.
Harry feels himself go taut, grunting out a string of curses as he comes inside of Draco, leaking about his cock and in rivulets down Draco’s thighs.
“But if Percy Weasley were here,” Draco says, deciding that if they’re going to be stuck for a while, he may as well act the proper, actual cunt and enjoy himself a bit. “Whatever would you stare at?”
Harry wordlessly (because his mouth is rather preoccupied) slicks his fingers and traces Draco’s rim, working a finger into the first knuckle.
Draco doesn’t really want any more wine. What he wants is to make Potter do that jaw-clenchy thing some more, so he throws up his arms and makes a whiny noise from the back of his throat that Blaise always tells him sounds like a dying Crup.
Harry feels an odd combination of emotions: pity, guilt, sympathy. Even some vindictiveness. His twelve-year-old self would have given anything to hear Malfoy admit he was jealous. He thinks he
Harry thinks he might be broken. He also thinks about sucking a cock clothed in fine lace and damp with precome into his mouth. Thin straps of elastic slid down cream coloured thighs—
In truth, Ginny’s curious about a lot of things. How exactly it happened (because ‘they were stuck in a lift’ really isn’t an adequate explanation, in her opinion), how long Harry’s had a thing for Malfoy, how he can set aside all the stuff that’s happened between them. She doesn’t ask any of that, though. “How you are, I guess. You seemed happier last night but you were in a right mood earlier.”
"Mind if I kiss you?" he says, because Harry had become more attractive in the months they spent together, less drawn and grey, less lanky and more wiry, and he's only gotten more so since. Soft lips, proper cheekbones. Beautiful eyes and long lashes. Charlie has a thing, for eyelashes. “Don’t mean to take advantage, you just, you know. Seem like you could use a good snog.”
Sometimes, when Harry’s brought home a casefile to review in the evenings, he’ll ask Draco to explain a paragraph of legal jargon to him, just to hear him talk, and see him wave his hands in that expressive way of his.
“So hard,” Draco murmurs. He helps Harry pull his jeans (ugh) down his thighs, and mouths at the bulge beneath his pants. “Gonna make you come,” says Draco.
“Second from the, ah, ngghh, the sun.” Even Harry knows that’s wrong, and he thinks he probably only paid less attention in Divination than Astronomy.
It’s typical Ginny, really. So typical he actually laughs, and remembers why he’d liked her so much when he was sixteen. Because Ginny won’t ask for details, for the why and how, even if she does want to know. She won’t pry, or be nosey, or go anywhere near a lecture. Just ‘how are you’.
Draco sniffs. He’d found the book on the coffee table, Granger’s no doubt, and it’s the same issue of Muggle Methods for Treating Magical Maladies he’s been meaning to order for weeks. He says, “I know how to work a television set.”
"D'you mind not looking at my dick every time we're around each other?" he snaps. "It's already getting old."
Dominique gives Hermione a tight little smile and says, "You can go through now. Please knock, first."
The fork is a proxy for Malfoy's neck, which he would like to be squeezing. Preferably until his eyeballs swell cartoonishly and then pop. It would be incredibly cathartic to do that, and not just because he's proper fucking annoying. Also because the longer he's forced to look at him the more Harry is forced to acknowledge a disturbing ... attractiveness about him. The flushed cheeks and the long, slim throat and especially the way Hermione's merlot (which he and Ron refuse to drink, seeing as it's fucking rancid) has stained his lips a bit red.
Potter, whose cheekbones do look rather chiseled when he frowns like that, and whose hands flex with veins when he grips his fork tight enough to warp the silver (Draco assumes it’s a proxy for his neck).
Draco can't articulate this any more eloquently than he can think it, so he says, "You have a beautiful way with words, my love.
"Great," Harry says sarcastically. He points his fork full of tart at Seamus, "No warnings. Don't do anything fucking stupid, alright? I'm gonna lose my bloody job over the lot of you."
. Why don’t I put on some hideous rags and find some stupid glasses and you can pretend I’m golden boy when I fuck you, yeah? It’s time we get you past this once and for all.”
Malfoy really is gone on Monday going by his absence in Potions, but the next day he's back again in Herbology and Harry spends most of the lesson frowning at the back of his head. Afterwards, while everyone's finishing cleaning up and Sprout heads over to greenhouse one for a first-year class, Harry tells Ron and Hermione to go on without him and goes to lean against the workstation where Malfoy's still packing away his things.
Harry can actually feel his self control crumble, like a dam reaching its limit. It happens the moment he sees Malfoy’s tongue sweeping across his lower lip. It makes sense: he’d gotten reamed more than once in Auror training for his tendency to give into urges.
The hand still on Harry’s has moved from waist to hip, and the bone is poking into Harry’s palm. “Isn’t what?”
He stares at Malfoy another second, all white hair and tantalising grey eyes, and Harry pushes him lightly back against the wall of the lift.
It’s impossible not to picture it, although Harry tries. His cheeks burn again and he lifts his mug, gulping the cocoa down and coughing when it scalds his throat. Why had he asked again?
“I’m sure I’ll manage,” Draco says, even though he’s really very much not. He clears his throat. “Thank you. I suppose.”
"I know," George says, trying for a light tone. "Just been thinking about how it's five Christmases without him. Feels like longer, doesn't it?"
the night Harry (and everyone else) found out that Malfoy likes blokes, because he pulled Michael Corner into his lap and kissed him full on the mouth.
Draco hadn't particularly wanted to attend tonight's soiree. Last time the eighth-years had a party, he'd gotten so incredibly toasted that he'd called Blaise daddy while they were snogging. He rather regrets it.
"He's right," Pansy agrees. "Although I wish you wouldn't be such a prick about it, Blaise, Draco's sensitive and quite sloshed at the moment, be gentle."
Harry blinks, surprised by what looks like genuine irritation on Malfoy's face suddenly rather than pure mockery.
Still, festive or not, this ancestral home is a luxury and he is, as ever, glad to lord over it. Especially when his son is home, as he has not been for some time. With a bit of luck, he thinks he may still be able to salvage what's left of his son and heir.
“What’s that?” says Harry. Both hands free, he lets them drift of their own accord. They find Draco’s arse. Of course.
Unsure of what to say, and knowing the uncertainty won't quite abate until his wand is in his hand, Draco steps closer. "I — thank you. Should we find somewhere — I mean, I can't do it here."
The longer he's thought about it, the angrier he's become. Telling Parkinson was shitty enough on its own, but to have given Hermione,
“You only say that because you’re still shitty that waiter turned you down.” Draco pats Blaise placatingly on one of his elegant shoulders as they descend the stairs to Venus’ main floor. “You never did handle a bruised ego very well,” he says.
already), he reaches back to hold himself open for the cock that’s teasing his cleft, only to have his wrists grasped so hard that the pointy outer bones thud against one another.
“Go on,” Harry says, palming enthusiastically at Draco’s cock. Already sensitive, it swells keenly at his touch. Harry keeps his expression impassive. He’s not
"Nobody's expected at a club at a specific time," Hermione says dismissively. "If they were it wouldn't be a club, it would be an office." She moves a bit of blanket away from Rosie's face, coos at her, kisses her soft forehead. "I really do appreciate this. I swear I'll be home at six. Maybe even earlier if I can manage it."
So he waits outside for him on the back steps, in the dark and the cold while Molly gets dinner ready. And when there’s the crack of Apparition after he's been waiting an hour, and he sees Charlie appear out of thin air, Harry smiles at him wryly.
Draco frowns. It's not what he expected. Certainly nothing worthy of Potter actively seeking him out like this. "I don't believe what I said to Granger really constitutes a discussion, Potter. She simply asked if I'd be seeing you again, and I said I wouldn't, and gave a brief explanation as to why."
Waving her hand idly, Pansy says, “You’re too kind. Certainly I haven’t given my time to anything as noble as Healing.”
What does surprise her a little bit, however, is the note of real hysteria in his voice. She hasn’t seen Draco this genuinely worked up in some time.
,” Hermione says, “this feels different. With Ginny and Charlie, they were more friends than anything else, you know? When things ended, Harry wanted to preserve that. And with Natalie — I mean, you remember how he was. It was like he only started seeing how bad things actually were the second they ended. He
“Cognac?” Pansy offers, reaching for the crystal stopper in her favourite XO. Granger looks kind of uptight and vaguely annoyed, the way she always used to in school. “It’s imported, of course. Britain has its charms but the liquor,
Lights change; orange now, and Harry grunts without meaning to, and pushes Draco against the wall by the hand on his neck, and frots harder and faster while Draco moans around his fingers.
“Sorry,” he says on a sigh. “I haven’t been here since …” He gestures vaguely instead of saying it. “Bit jumpy, I guess.” Holding up the joint, he says, “Stay a minute?”
, mostly because she thinks Pansy knows that. And because she realises they’re clearly not going to get right to it, she adds, gesturing around the office, “You’ve done well for yourself. I feel like I see your spirits at every pub and grocery I’ve been to in the last five years.”
Harry raises his eyebrows. Dark haired bloke has disappeared, but there’s still a slight slick of tequila below Malfoy’s belly button. Which Harry can see. And it makes him dizzy, which it probably shouldn’t — just like he’s not terribly unused to seeing Malfoy out and about, he’s not terribly unused to seeing him in a state of scant dress.
A lovely segue. Pansy wonders if it was purposeful. Only, she’s never imagined Granger to be skilled in the art of delicate conversation — she’s always been so incredibly blunt.
"Good, what did I tell you?" Pansy says happily. "Come, Draco, I'll Apparate us there." She stands and holds a hand out to him.
"Just a few days," says Charlie. "Mum wants me to stay a week at least, but I can't miss New Years on the ranch. Fucking incredible. You should come, one year."
“This isn’t like that, Hermione,” he says a little gruffly, not meeting her eyes. “You’re making it into something it’s not. I know you’re just worried about me, I get it, and I’m grateful, but I’m not delicate. And I’m not getting involved with Malfoy.” He lifts his gaze to her again. “Okay?”
She could hit him, really. But that's Draco. "Yes, well, it was a time-consuming hobby," she says, beginning to organise the papers on her desk and file them away. "And you were always much more passionate about the cause than either of us. I'd say your enthusiasm was rivaled only by darling little Ginevra Weasley." She stands up from her desk and
Percy says, “I’ll be upstairs,” mutters something about immaturity and juvenile squabbling, and excuses himself from the table.
"Draco won't discuss it." There's no point feigning niceties, now. Granger's not going to acquiesce anymore than she already has. Pansy drains her glass, and continues, "He did, however, make clear his intention to let it go no further."
Harry releases Malfoy’s wrist and lets his own arm drop. He looks between his eyes, tries to see something there beyond the cold anger, but he’s not easy to read. “If that were true,” says Harry, “you wouldn’t have had sex with me in the first place. Try again.”
Draco shakes his sleeve back over the Mark but leaves his hand palm up between them. Potter, in some weird duality, is both the last and the first person Draco would expect to be so forgiving. Draco kind of hates him for it. He says, “I appreciate the sympathy Harry, and I’m actually not being sarcastic, but I know what I've done,” he says.
Harry laughs, but it’s really just an exhale. “Fair.” He slides off and out of Draco and curls him into his side, stroking the damp hair from his forehead. “I suppose I should thank that Charms specialist."
Hermione nods. She’s always thought Harry had a bit of a self-destructive streak. She could see it even in school, when he went after Cho, whose boyfriend had just died, and Ginny, who was his best friend’s sister. Harry doesn’t often think about protecting himself, and he never listens to Hermione when she tries to do it for him. “It’s a pattern,” she says. “But I don’t know, I don’t think we can talk him out of this.”
fifteen; he's in fact twenty-three with a flat and a career and a revolving-door of relationships, and if he allows Malfoy to send him reeling back into adolescence with a single (outrageous) gesture then his façade of adulthood will completely unravel. And he can't have that.
“—part of life. Really, Harry, after all we’ve been through, you shouldn’t be so dramatic about a bit of—”
can probably be added to the list of the dumbest, most embarrassing, socially inept things Harry’s ever said, right up there with whatever he’d blurted into Cho’s face after being rejected for the Yule Ball. The kind of thing that will haunt him at two AM and refuse to let him sleep until he’s ruminated over it for most of the night. Perfect. On the other hand, he’s got wank material for pretty much the rest of his life, so. Not the worst trade-off in history.
“No,” Harry agrees, lowering his voice and following Malfoy down those few steps, “but I’d like it if you did.”
“Find them,” Harry mutters, fiddling blindly at Draco’s flies and pulling his trousers over the swell of his ass. “Find them. What kind of fuck-wittery—”
Surprised by the shift in position, Harry lifts his eyebrows up at him. There’s something off in his voice, just a hint of something genuinely irritated. Pushing it out of habit, he says, “It’s not my fault you’re so horny about it.”
Harry flinches at the touch to his scar instinctively and has to shake his head to rid himself of what he
“While likening it to a bird’s nest or some such. But I admire your positivity. It’s very cute. Classic Gryffindor.”
“Of course,” Draco says. He waves a lazy hand. “But what with the way you’ve been staring at me, I’d dismissed it as a possibility.”
“Fuck off,” Draco says, and with much less bite than he meant it. He’s sure he looks a sight, and his flies are still undone, and he’s probably going to have to take the lift down to the nice, cool file room and sit in there for at least an hour until he’ll be fit to treat any patients. “I get off at twelve. AM. By which time I shall’ve reached triple digits on the list of the reasons why this is the most idiotic thing I’ve ever done. Excuse me.”
"Right,” Draco snickers. He drops himself down on one of the only surfaces that hasn’t been soiled by fornication, and snaps his fingers. “If you’re not a close and personal friend of mine, kindly fuck off.”
"Yes," Pansy agrees, "but not to this extent usually. I mean, a couple weeks ago he was a bit broken up about it — that night I took him home and gave him a bath, you remember — but I thought he'd gotten over it by now. He hasn't said a word." She sighs, tracing a finger round the lip of her tumbler. "I could just
Sometimes Harry manages to get a fucking grip and will his erection away (mostly) and then pull off later while thinking about anything but Malfoy. Because he does want this to go away, and he knows it will with time, but it's really bloody bothersome at the moment.
"It doesn't have to not go anywhere," Harry says bluntly, looking over at him. "And I was never just occupying myself. I had feelings for you."
Draco doesn't like to be surprised. (In fact, last year, when he walked into his flat to see the lights off and the awkward silhouettes of Slytherins trying their hardest to forget a decade or two of posture training and fold themselves into a crouch behind his low-slung coffee table, he’d simply set down his bags and walked back out again. It had taken much coercion from Pansy (“
He might have retorted but Harry actually feels oddly sorry for him in the same uncomfortable way he had when he'd found Malfoy crying in Myrtle's bathroom. Sure, he's always been a massive fucking prick for no reason, but he's also been through some fucked up shit lately and getting disowned seems like unfairly rubbing the wound with salt. It only makes Harry more bitter towards the Ministry, towards
He scoffs. As if Potter would give his precious little bleeding Gryffindor heart to anyone of Draco's sort. Potter thinks he's, what was it? Evil's pathetic little sideshow?
Potter’s Warming Charm is beginning to dull around the edges, fingers of cold creeping back in. Draco wraps his bare arms around himself and shrugs. “I don’t know,” he says, rather stupidly. “I suppose I want to talk to you. I want us to talk and fuck and read together. I want to be able to reach across and touch you whenever I want, like it’s nothing.”
what happened. I had no intention of shagging Potter, I assure you. It's just that it got quite stuffy in the lift. What with it being stalled. Potter took off his robes and I happened to, you know, observe that he was. Excited by my presence. Once again."
“With the Chosen One so close, who could resist a peek at the goods?” says Draco, the corner of his mouth upturned.
There's a part of Harry that will always be a little bit in awe of Charlie, and that part is curious who the handler is that he was shagging.
“How about that one,” Harry says, pointing to a brightly blinking constellation towards the corner of the ceiling. Draco’s eyes are hardly open. But whatever. “What’s that one called, love?”
She gives Harry a stern look and says to Terry, “Would you mind popping out for a second? I need a quick chat with Harry.”
“No,” says Draco. “It’s here. I’m allowed to use it during classes. Other supervised activities. Otherwise, I think McGonagall has it. It’s supposed to be kept warded away somewhere, but she’s incensed about the whole thing, so.”
“No,” says Harry. “Lucius, would you believe. Down by the bar, pouring tequila into his belly button.”
bad, but still fucking infuriating. He has half a mind to demand to speak to Kingsley tomorrow and ask what the hell this is, taking kids' wands, letting the Wizengamot order it to be locked up outside of classes.
"Will you quit it, Blaise?" Pansy says. She gets up from the bed and sits beside Draco's head, running fingers through his white hair with those talons she calls nails. They do admittedly feel rather good on one's scalp. "Draco, what do you mean, darling?"
"Fuck," Draco sighs. He leans down and mouths at Harry's jaw, a muddled line of kisses to his mouth. "So sensitive."
eventually realise you're still the same pathetic, entitled, conniving little arsehole you've always been, because you can't keep that hidden for long. Clearly."
Hm. All this Greek mythology stuff is actually quite interesting. Harry will have to remember to ask Draco about it another time. You know. When he isn’t sucking his brains out through his dick, or something.
He thinks he might have actually gotten lucky, but all hopes of putting off dealing with Malfoy until next time disappear when the lift opens and there he is, dressed in the lime green Healer robes that look terrible on everyone else. He thinks of waiting for another lift and then decides that would be pathetic too. So he gets on and ignores him as well as the one other occupant, another Healer who does nothing to hide her glance at his scar.
"Oh, good," Harry says, "that image is only slightly less damaging to me than the ones conjured up by the noises I heard coming from Ron's room over the summer." Those had been bad.
“That waiter is clearly a troglodyte,” Blaise drawls. “And it has nothing to do with their fucking disgraceful oysters. Let’s go to The Rooftop, I need fresh air.”
," he says sarcastically, and he rolls his eyes. "And like I said, we didn't finish, so. I dunno." He keeps coming back to that, like it means something. They didn't finish. It can't
Draco moans again, babbles something that sounds an awful lot like “shut up,” and rocks his arse back against Harry’s finger. Harry draws it away.
Pansy raps her nails against her snifter, picturing Draco's piqued, glassy-eyed face as he left The Rooftop two evenings ago. His Floo's been blocked since.
“Oh, come off it,” he says drily. And to Draco, “She told me about Potter. Quit sulking, Draco, it’s
Draco waves a hand at his robes, popping one shoulder blade to rest against the wall of the still-halted lift. “I see no appeal in your bedraggled aesthetic.” He tilts his head. “Though I expect, perhaps, it might be rather handy.”
She snorts. Taps more ash on the floor. "So? Good, he deserved it. Bringing up Lucius." Then she pauses. "Wait, tried?"
“You’re not funny. Fuck you. Really.” Harry whacks Ron as hard as he can in the arm, grabs his head and turns it firmly back over the chessboard. Berk.
Draco huffs in incredulous disbelief. Just where the fuck does Potter get off talking to him like he’s a misbehaving first year. “I‘ve no obligation to explain myself to you. We hate each other, we’ve always hated each other. Lines were blurred, that’s all there is to it.”
Draco is rutting softly, rubbing his cock against the wood of Harry’s (largely unused) desk and fucking himself back on Harry’s tongue, babbling for—
“Here, get under it,” he says. And to the Fat Lady he gives the password again, to which she replies, “I’m trying to sleep, Potter. Going a bit far with these ‘Chosen One’ privileges, aren’t we?”
“S’alright,” Charlie says, kissing up Harry’s cheekbone and onto the shell of his ear before he rolls off him. “I’m good.” He’s hard as a fucking rock, he’ll definitely need a minute before he can get on a broom, but ultimately he wanted to make Harry feel good, and he’s done that. Plus, they really must be late for dinner by now.
Harry presses him back against the sinks, entirely annoyed with the way Draco’s obvious goading is working. “Yeah?” He drops a hand to look for a bulge in Draco’s trousers and squeezes when he finds it. “Why’s that?”
Harry’s still panting and coming back to himself when Draco — probably unaware of the bruises already developing on his neck — turns to the side and announces his imminent departure into unconsciousness and Harry pulls out of him feeling somehow surprised by the situation he’s suddenly in. He blinks at Draco a few times, briefly assesses the constriction in his chest the sight evokes, and then grabs his wand to clean them both up and cast another
“What the fuck?” says Seamus. “Don’t be stupid. Roll it, Luna. Ron’s fine. Look at him, he’s just vibing, leave him alone.”
. Harry decides not to use that word out loud. "Plus, I sort of ..." He shrugs as best he can while holding Rose. Grimaces. "I ran out on him a bit. He was pretty upset. I feel kind of shit about it."
“Harry,” Hermione warns him and he pushes her away drunkenly and follows Malfoy out of the Great Hall where he’s just disappeared behind the doors, Parkinson, who'd ushered him there, fading back into the party.
It’s an interesting thought, actually, and not one he’s had before — obvious reasons, like he hadn’t questioned anything about his sexuality up until quite recently. But with Draco’s nails on his back and stirring up a kind of angry arousal he hasn’t ever felt before, he’s not thinking about that so much.
Draco scoffs. It’s languid, but it’s still a scoff. He rolls his eyes, too. “Don’t be daft, Potter. Of course I am.”
Knowing he should get Draco out of here, Harry still gives into temptation and kisses him again, slow and deep with a hand on his jaw and their legs tangled together. It’s another world, one with soft blond boys in his bed and pleasant stripes of early morning sunlight coming through the hangings. “You’re still fucked out,” he says with a crooked grin when he pulls away. “Good look for you.”
"It was, yeah," Harry says ironically. At the time, he only remembers being pissed off. And humiliated, when he realised Dumbledore wouldn't have let Fleur's sister die down there. "I mean, honestly, that's the main reason I bothered getting rid of Voldemort. I can't get enough of the adulation. It keeps me young, Malfoy."
?” Mystifying. Completely captivating. She sits up a little straighter. “From start to finish, if you don’t mind. Where in the world did you manage this?”
"Why d'you have to be so fucking prickly?" Harry snaps. He doesn't actually know why he's so angry. Well, no, he
Curious. Hm. Draco draws back the sleeve of his cashmere jumper, dropping his eyes to Potter’s hand on the log while he holds out his wrist.
Draco's body goes taut. Potter's told him that before, at dinner on that first night they saw each other and again in the lift. That he hasn't changed, will never change. It's not true.
“But you are my lover,” insists Harry, shifting his hand so it’s teasing the head of Draco’s cock through his wool trousers. “Keep telling me about the stars, lover.”
There's an indecently immature part of Pansy that revels in Granger's annoyance. Wants to keep pushing until she storms out of the office in a huff. But. Alas. She meant to do this for Draco, not herself. "Listen, Hermione," she says. "The thing about Draco is that he can be very reticent, when he pleases. He
Two, then three, licking and sucking while he whines. Draco is thrusting his narrow hips, and Harry can
Draco whines a little. Harry knows he must be feeling constricted, his semi trapped behind the waistband of his trousers. Draco doesn’t like leaking on his expensive clothes, usually. Tonight he doesn’t protest.
Harry's heart sinks when Malfoy's wand vibrates; he can see the shutters closing, knows that whatever headway he'd been about to make is lost. There's a barrier again that he wouldn't be able to get through right now even if he'd had the energy to try.
Blaise looks as astonished as Pansy feels, which is quite out of the norm seeing as Blaise doesn't usually show feelings other than maybe contempt and satiation. She watches Draco go with a terrible weight in her chest and a cloying guilt clogging her throat. She looks at Blaise once Draco's out of sight, meeting his dark eyes. "I think he was crying," she says quietly. "I didn't mean— surely he knows we weren't ..." Taking the piss? Yeah, actually, they had been. But, Merlin, for him to have been reduced to
For just a second, sitting on top of him, Harry squeezes Malfoy’s jaw and allows himself to tap into some of that rage he’s always carried with him and only sometimes loses control of. It gets easier every year — with age, he supposes — and maybe that’s why he only squeezes for a second, and not very hard.
However, when he hears an absolute ruckus start behind him he has no choice but to look, his curiosity too great. What he finds is Malfoy bent at the waist, trousers tight against his arse (which is as unjustly perfect as his skin), digging through a cabinet that no rational person would ever believe contained wine, especially when there’s a bottle sitting on the counter.
When he walks out onto the Astronomy Tower and sees Malfoy standing near one of the balustrades, Harry swears under his breath. It's half two in the morning and he'd been absolutely
The Weasel, who is eyeing the most recent addition to Granger’s (admittedly impressive) spread, says, “What is tepenade, even?”
“Clearly you do give a shit,” Harry says loudly. He’s losing his grip on his temper, he can feel it happening. “Or you wouldn’t have made up whatever bullshit you told Hermione. You liked it, what I did in that lift, and you’re pissed off I saw you like that. Well get the fuck over it, Malfoy.” He takes a step forwards, hardly aware of another Healer walking towards them. “You would’ve let me do a lot more if we hadn’t stopped.”
"Harry," Ron says, very quietly, once recovered from his stupor. "You know how they say babies are a lot of work? Like, the hardest thing you'll ever do?"
Ron’s voice comes from inside an Extended cupboard, sounding meters away even though Harry can still see the cuff of his jeans. “Yeah.”
"I'm so sorry, Ms Parkinson," Dominique says obsequiously, standing from the desk. "I tried to stop him —" here she shoots Draco a devastatingly bitchy glare "— and he started throwing a tantrum."
Harry shrugs. He’s not wrong — he’s been thinking about Malfoy too often lately, and he’d been far too prepared to say yes to whatever imaginary offer he’d thought Malfoy was going to make the other night. He says, “You do, though. Don’t you?”
"These would be fantastic insults," says Harry, "if you weren't literally humping my hand as you're saying them." Heart racing, he makes a split second decision: "Turn around."
Harry bites down on his lip and closes his eyes, slightly overwhelmed by the sight of Malfoy trying to fuck himself backwards on his fingers. He doesn't let him, of course, but only because the pleasure he gains from being in control of everything beats it by the smallest margin.
“You feel good,” Harry expands. He wants to take Draco’s lips between his again, he wants to slide his hands firmly along the pale curve of his waist, wants to kiss and bite, wants to feel a delicate swell against his cock instead of the tight seam of his jeans. But he’s pathetic. And he can’t.
He lets his head be cradled and his hair stroked, because for all he begrudges, he loves his mother. And he had missed her while he was away, so much so he'd cried with it a few times. "I know."
Draco hadn't thought to tell Harry he had private rooms, because he finds them invaded by his friends so often that they're hardly more secluded than the Gryffindor's arrangement. Also, he'd been quite unconvinced of Potter's ability to outfox Pansy.
“You know, I expect that from most people,” Harry says, looking at Malfoy with his head tilted, “but not you. For your information, I’ve been considering playing Quidditch.” He turns and leans back against the guardrail, arms folding. “
"D'you not know how to turn the telly on or are you really as nerdy as Hermione?" Harry says, sitting down in an armchair and gesturing at the book he's holding.
Pansy barely suppresses another eye roll. Granger is so fucking proper, it's incensing. She's lovely to look at, sure (with outrageously incredible skin), and she's got this whole virtuous, heart-of-gold thing going for her, but fuck she must be an utter bore in bed. Pansy can hardly bring herself to picture her and the Weasel, in all their heterosexual missionary glory. A tragedy, for both of them.
. “It’s like, so completely gay, Harry. But not really. Read it or die by my sword”. Harry tried, and didn’t get very far. Draco ended up reading it to him, and Harry was happy with that compromise) and listens to political podcasts. He likes that Draco
Draco’s amused sneer curls into something sour before he can stop it. “I told you last time we spoke,” he says, “that I don’t give a fucking shit. You pulled out, I went home, I found someone else to finish the job. This is getting tedious, Potter.”
“No,” he answers after a moment. Honestly, he can’t remember well enough to say it with one hundred percent certainty, but he dislikes the implication. “Were you?”
Charlie sighs and wandlessly clears a patch of snow for him and Harry to sit. Harry’s always been either frustratingly evasive or completely blunt. Looks like it’s the latter, tonight. “I dunno. It’s— there’s so many shades of grey. I mean, people can do stupid shit, like, really bad shit, doesn’t necessarily mean they’re all bad. Look at Perce,” he says, even though it makes his gut twist a bit. “But on the other hand, didn’t the kid like, poison Ron? His dad tried to kill you. And, shit, I’m not saying any of this to make you feel bad, or whatever, but I guess you’ve just really gotta think about whether you can properly forgive him for that. If you can’t, I’d say yeah. Bad foundations.”
After walking for a while, the mess of trees on either side of the path open into a small glade. High above, a smudge of dark sky disturbs the tree tops. Down below, a smudge of dark hair disturbs their spindly boughs. Draco half jumps out of his skin at the sight of the figure, sending stones skittering from under his feet. He keeps to the vague edges of the copse behind him, resisting the urge to run as it turns just slightly, moonlight revealing a fine profile obstructed by round glasses – fuck's sake, it's just Potter. He's not sure when Potter became 'just Potter'; i.e., a relief rather than a threat. Whatever. Draco makes to retreat.
Shifting suddenly to sit himself on top of Harry, Draco says, "Let's just do it then." He feels horrifically fond of Potter just now, blushing and so forthright about his concern for Draco. What's the worst that could happen? As Harry pointed out, if they fight, they'll probably have amazing rough sex, anyway. Win-win.
And, of course, Harry knows Malfoy is gay. He’s at a gay bar. Harry’s just seen a man licking spirits from his abdomen. He reads the papers (or rather, Hermione reads the papers, and tells Harry the important bits.) He knows that the Wizarding public has been able to forgive their Saviour things they’ve never forgiven Malfoy for; his sexuality, his promiscuity.
"Yeah," he says. He stares at him another second, wondering at the disappointment he feels. "Whatever. See you, Malfoy."
“Oh, fuck,” Harry grunts. His cock is already swelling again and he congratulates it on it’s initiative. “Draco, you cheeky
“Yes, you did, Granger. Although you needn’t worry if you hadn’t, because there’s this handy little spell — and I’m awfully surprised you haven’t heard of it — called
He can't tell anymore if Malfoy's purposely being defiant or if he's so gone he genuinely thinks this is what Harry meant.
Harry scoffs. “What kind of a garbage aphorism is that? Gratitude can just be gratitude, Malfoy, not everyone thinks in terms of favours and debts. You’re
George bursts into laughter and kicks him lightly in the ribs. "Yeah, you're not kidding." His smile softens a little and he lets out a sigh. "Woulda gone for Freddie first if he was around. He was always the looker. Of course, I was the brains."
would he stay? He’s twenty-fucking-three and it shouldn’t feel like defeat, it should feel like being a normal human who takes themselves out of infuriating situations they know might make them lose their temper.
Molly scolds them when they walk inside (as they’d known she would) but does so as she ushers them around the table to join everyone else. Harry takes a spot between Ron and Ginny and is glad to find that he’s ravenous, not to mention in better spirits than before.
“Very much so,” he says. “Now we’ve got that out of the way, can we talk about your husband? I know you want me here for Christmas lunch tomorrow Mother, but if he continues to bother me, I shan’t stay.”
“Sounds like Potter,” Pansy says grimly. “What a prick. I don’t think it helps Draco’s been hanging round Granger outside of work. That’s the only reason he saw Potter today and I’m sure that’s why he’s all worked up about it again.” She pauses, then says, a little hesitantly, “Maybe we should tell Granger to, you know ... back off a bit.”
, as soon as Harry walks in and sets the bowl down, and he gestures sardonically to the abundance of dishes, "since Hermione barely made any food."
“My aunt tried to cut it all off once,” he’s saying of his hair, able now, ten years or more in retrospect, to be amused rather than traumatised by it. “Grew back overnight. Didn’t know I was a wizard yet, so that was weird.”
spent seven years loudly loathing someone and then tried to shag them five years later only to get essentially rejected halfway through the fuck, she thinks she too would probably have spent a week or two utterly mortified.
“Don’t be fucking glib,” Draco snaps. Of course Pansy would’ve told Blaise. He shouldn’t have expected any less, and he hardly has the sentience to be miffed at her for it. “I'm not
that happened with Potter in that empty room at Mungo's, because he doesn't want to talk about it. Doesn't, doesn't.
She's at work, thankfully. Ron's home with the baby, which works to Harry's advantage since Ron can't throttle him or whatever if he's holding his kid.
Fresh off of her rounds, Hermione's delighted to see Draco in the tearoom already when she goes to sit down for a quick lunch. She's been wanting to talk to him, gauge his emotional temperature, but she hasn't wanted to actually pull him aside and make him suspicious. So this is good.
“I won’t be here tomorrow,” Draco says. He takes a step back. “Next time you feel like manufacturing a coincidence, I’ll be sure to have it on me.”
Harry strains and makes a noise in his throat and digs his nails into Charlie's shoulder. Then he lets go, gets his hand between them and pops the button on his jeans. "Touch me," he says, getting his fingers around himself and shuddering. "Please."
Harry shoots her a scathing look but does it. He meets Malfoy’s grey eyes and practically rips the food out of his hands.
Harry's pulse jumps when he feels Malfoy's mouth on his neck. A carnal, teenage, hormone-addled, intoxicated part of him doesn't care where they are, or who it is, or why they might be doing this, or that he's only got half a clue as to what he's doing. It's the other part of Harry that pulls away again and cups his jaw in his hand to get Malfoy to look at him.
Harry feels rather than sees Draco pout. It occurs to him, then, that they’re not kissing. Just pressing closer against each other until there’s no space or sound between them, and muttering. “What’s wrong with my trousers?” says Draco.
“Although,” Ron says, twiddling a wooden piece between his fingers. “I was thinking of— fuck, now I’m nervous.”
“Harry,” says Ron gravely, pulling Harry back to stare at him in earnest. “Don’t push my foncey in a lake.”
The problem is that it’s the middle of winter and the hospital is warm to compensate, and with neither of them capable of producing a Cooling Charm the heat starts becoming oppressive after only ten minutes (in which they stand on opposite sides of the small space and don’t look at each other).
“Fuck you. Fuck you, you’re so,” Close. Harry’s lips are red, cheeks flushed with alcohol. He’s so close, so earnest, so determined to push and pry. And he’s so
"Nope. Stuck in a lift." He kicks some more snow around, eyes to the ground. "We have a bit of a history, he and I." And now he looks up again, pinning Charlie with his gaze. "D'you think less of me for it?"
Harry laughs against his cheek. He starts stroking more firmly, gathering wetness from the head to ease the slide. He's never done this to anyone but himself — the angle's weird — but he loves the noises it's getting out of Malfoy. "Now's as good a time as any to admit I'm right," he says into his ear.
Ron had sighed, and beckoned Hermione closer so he could stretch across two dining chairs with his head in her lap. "We'll talk to him. Next time he comes over, we'll talk to him.")
Well that was suspiciously easy. He says "Okay" and looks around them, trying to gather himself enough to figure something out. Truthfully he's got no idea what he's doing, where this is going, or what he's going to do when they get there, but he at least wants a private place to give figuring it out a shot.
By the time he’d stopped looking gaunt and lank and half-starved, and started looking all sort of glossy and Malfoy-ish again, the repairs on Hogwarts were finished, and the eighth year common room was ready to be moved into.
Shrugging slightly, Harry says, “S’pose not.” And then, after staring at Malfoy’s mouth for a second and trying to process the idea it had been on his dick a minute ago, he adds, “So what now? Do we go back to normal tomorrow?”
"Christ, don't be vile, Pans. As if I'd ever go moony eyed over King Pleb. And do you really think I don't know that? I've fucked McLaggen, and that was only because he's got a Beater's bat for a fucking prick. That's not the problem."
In fact Harry’s pretty sure he knows what Ron’s thinking about; he and Hermione are good (if obvious) about not bringing Natalie up, but he knows perfectly well they still discuss it amongst themselves when they think he’s retreating into himself. Or whatever.
Because he really, truly, had not thought about Harry Potter all that much in the last few years. After the mottled bruises from Weasley’s right hook and Potter’s elbow in his ribs when they fell together from the broom had faded, and he’d packed up his assorted bedrooms at the Manor into cardboard boxes, and said fuck you to Lucius and I’ll miss you to his Mum, and jaunted off to France with Pansy and Blaise to be young and sexy and not at all infamous, he had not thought about Harry Potter.
“And here I was thinking you’d be high maintenance,” says Harry. He links a hand with one of Draco’s, sliding their fingers together and smoothing his thumb over Draco’s palm. “Come stay in my room again?”
“Mm,” Draco says. Harry takes his hand in the one that’s not on Draco’s cock and presses his lips to each knuckle.
When the boy is gone (“good job, darling,” Pansy makes sure to tell him) and an oil lamp is turned on, she takes the strap off and tosses it aside, then pulls her knickers on.
The sentence confuses her for a moment, until she realises the stressed pronoun isn't referring to Potter. Unconsciously she sneers, back stiffening.
Drunk or not, Harry doesn’t buy it. At all. And his curiosity is more than piqued — he has a special interest in Malfoy’s wand, and he has a feeling other people might as well. “I know you’re lying,” he says. “Who took the wand, Malfoy?” A pause, and then, “Is that why you were gone Monday?”
“Charmed,” Harry says, crossing to where Malfoy is and tapping the branches with his wand so they untangle and retreat. The lantern over by the log throws ominous shadows over them.
Surprised and pleased, Harry says with laughter in his voice, “There’s, like, three or four of them. Don’t tell me that’s a yes.”
Truthfully, he's surprised Malfoy responds to the command so fast. Broken he'd wanted and apparently broken he's gotten. His cock (which, as he was reminded, has been hard for the past twenty minutes) twitches and he bites back a groan. With his trousers pulled slightly down, Harry can see two perfect little dimples above Malfoy's arse that make him feel half mad with lust.
Ugh. Trust Potter to wrangle mention of his fame at a time like this. Draco wants to say as much, but it’s enough effort already to pull himself shakily from the wall, and take his robes from where Potter’s holding them out.
He’s not exactly sure what Malfoy means by it, honestly, and he wants to ask but decides not to. He’s suddenly aware of how close they’re sitting, and Malfoy’s hand lying palm-up between them, and that smell of cologne.
Granger, having ostensibly given up on trying to get the three of them to play nicely, sets her fork down with a great thunk and rises from her chair. “Ronald. Could you please assist me in the kitchen?”
“No I don’t,” Harry says. Draco’s ankle is very close to his foot. He bridges the distance cautiously.
about the predicament I’ve found myself in, I’m willing to deem that little display the result of severe shock, because and only because of our long lasting friendship. Second of all, ‘it didn’t take you long’? Fuck you. And third of all, I haven’t a clue what kind of kisser Potter is. I share your assumption that he’s appalling, but as if I’d ever endeavour to find out, so don’t be foul.”
“I’m not sure how you manage work at the hospital and taking care of this.” Draco speaks out loud without quite meaning to.
“Yes, hello Dominique,” Draco says, and drops his robes on her desk as he passes. “I’d love to have a chat, but I really must speak with Ms Parkinson. She in? Lovely.”
Harry trails his lips up to Malfoy’s mouth and kisses him. When he pulls away he finds Malfoy’s hands, presses them above his head, and then finds his mouth again. His hips stutter and his pace quickens and eventually he’s not kissing him anymore but panting into his mouth as he fucks him. “Are you close?” he mumbles.
“Thanks,” says Harry. He swallows thickly.  “You know, I spent a lot of time plotting out my first big decision. I think I’m going to end up winging it, though.”
Draco turns towards the caress like a flower to the sun. “Good morning,” he says, voice thick with sleep hardly departed from. His mother used to wake him up softly like this, with kisses on his forehead and cooing his name. It’s a weird thought, Draco shakes it from his head.
He pulls back like he’s been stung by the wand, which he’s not so sure he hasn’t. He looks from it to Draco, surprised, disgusted, resentful. After a moment of silence, he slaps Draco across the cheek. Not hard. Enough to sting, the way the jinxes used to when he acted up.
, to his stomach. He might retch. It's possible. He presses his fingers into his forehead, rubs at his scar in a gesture so ingrained it's as if his brain thinks it'll still help with headaches.
Harry takes a moment to be kind of impressed with himself for having reduced Malfoy to this suppliant creature who can only manage little "oh" sounds rather than words. But only a moment, because he will definitely disintegrate into a pile of dust if he doesn't get his cock inside Malfoy immediately.
Some part of Harry had been expecting it, because there’s a release of tension when he hears Malfoy’s voice saying his name. He turns and raises his eyebrows. “Yeah?”
Draco says, "I can do without the pleasure of Granger's company outside the workplace if it means avoiding you. Inside of it too, perhaps, after tonight. You do realise she enticed us here in the hopes of some jovial festivities? Merlin, must all the women in my life be so fucking conspiratorial?"
“Well of course. What can’t you do?” Draco says. He bucks his hips underneath Harry, not really trying to toss him off but also wanting to, a bit.
“I notice you left these on,” hums Draco. He’s thumbing the elastic of his knickers absently. “Your magical subconscious is just as much of a deviant as you are.”
Pansy snorts. "Don't be gauche, Granger. I'm simply requesting that you, as I said, leave him be. Draco's quite delicate at the moment, and it's really only due to your intervention."
“There’s not much to tell,” she says dismissively. “I’d like to hear more about it, if that’s alright. You know he’s a good person to have an association with, don’t you? He doesn’t ... surely he can’t blame you for ...?”
They never actually use the word deviant, but it’s there in spirit. Despite the fact that Malfoy is, you know. A complete cock. Harry feels bad about that. It rankles.
After a moment, he says, "Is it a secret Slytherin requirement, then, that you can't be heterosexual?" And then, "Daphne's fit. Greengrass, yeah?" Amazing tits. He doesn't say that part.
The thing is, Harry didn’t think he paid Malfoy’s outfits an awful lot of attention. More to that; any at all, but all of a sudden they flood his consciousness like photos from a catalogue. Malfoy perched at the bar in a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up, Mark displayed. Malfoy making Pansy Parkinson laugh so hard she drops the glass she’s cleaning in tight black jeans and low slung checkered trousers (it's happened more than once). Malfoy looking pointedly away from Harry as he enters with Ron and Hermione, in a tailored Muggle suit; pants and boxy jacket with no shirt underneath.
Harry supposes it’s his own fault for bringing his aggressively heterosexual friends to a gay club. Hermione had worn her sensible shoes. And although it was Ron who’d drunkenly enthused ‘
“C’mon, pet,” Harry enthuses, delicately tracing Draco’s bollocks. “Want to hear your beautiful voice.” He presses a few chaste kisses across Draco’s perineum and up his shaft, slick and dripping. “Love your voice, Draco (kiss). Love hearing you talk (kiss). Makes me fucking hard (kiss). Speak, pet.”
Any irritation on Hermione’s part is eclipsed by the surprise she feels at hearing Pansy say about Draco exactly what she would have said about Harry. Which is ... interesting.
“Invited Draco over for dinner,” she repeats, sternly this time, as if they’d already said something that annoyed her. “We’re working together now, as I’ve already told you, and he’s been very pleasant and I told him it would be nice to catch up and go over some things during dinner. You two, and
Shrugging, Harry says, "Not entirely." He thumbs over Draco's chin and kisses him again. "I was already considering it ... there's a lot of reasons. Your wand was sort of the final decision-making factor for me."
"D'you ever wonder how Seamus hasn't burned his flat down yet?" Harry says as plates and cutlery begin flying out of shelves and cupboards and stacking themselves on the table.
Draco's helpless to stop the sound of complaint that escapes him when Potter stops his frotting after only a moment of friction.
Speeding his hand up and working him through it, Harry goes back to mouthing his jaw as Malfoy comes all over both of them, twitching and jerking. "Fuck, you look so good," Harry mumbles against his skin, hand slowing.
“Isn’t this a little counterproductive?” says Harry, and he’s quite proud of himself for getting out such a fucking long word without stumbling. He’s drunk, and Malfoy’s—
He’d discovered quite swiftly that the pinchy little bastard holds an almost universal fancy — every bloke he’s fucked since has groaned upon his disrobing, said “fuck, that’s hot, et cetera,” and given the thing a tug.
“Gotten used to it “ Harry explains. The way Malfoy plays with his hair makes Harry want to kiss him again. “How’s it feel, infiltrating Gryffindor?”
“Oh really?” Pansy coos, taking Blaise’s arm. “And then, pray tell, what would you do when you’re in a strop and want me to dom you a bit, hm?”
He wonders whether Malfoy realises exactly how right he is, or if it's simply a taunt for the sake of taunting. Almost three whole months since he's fucked anyone, and for what? Because his relationship had gone out so explosively he'd only been in the mood for his left hand? Here, trapped in a lift with Malfoy of all
“Perfect,” he says, “if death is coming for me I’d definitely prefer to go that way.” He kisses Draco’s jaw. “So what’s the charm?”
“Don’t be vile,” says Draco. Now that he’s come, his head feels clearer. Not entirely, since Harry’s cock is still visibly a little hard in his jeans, but enough to think straight.
“Perhaps you shouldn’t have agreed to babysit if you couldn’t stay,” Harry says sardonically. “I can’t be tied here for two hours, Malfoy, I’m still on call. Go primp yourself the whole time for all I care but you can’t leave.”
, admittedly, been nice. He'd read it at night, in bed, where Hermione couldn't see and harass him about it. "I liked it a lot. I always knew, like — you know, Jekyll and Hyde. But I didn't know the whole story. And I think you're wrong, by the way — it's not about black and white morality, it's about the exact opposite."
The angle and having to reach half-inside Malfoy’s trousers is killing his wrist so Harry stops for a moment and pulls them further down his hips, and this time he licks his palm before returning it to Malfoy’s cock. He slows the movements down, stroking from base to tip, and goes back to mouthing at his jaw. “Why don’t you just stop talking,” Harry mumbles. “I thought you wanted to come.”
Harry thinks he shouldn’t feel as pleased as he does at the compliment. Even though Draco called him an idiot. It’s a little difficult to take such insults to heart, when they’re mumbled lazily into his cheek.
Charlie told Harry he was leaving on Boxing Day. He'd meant to go in November, but Mum had convinced him to stay for Christmas. That ended up being the right thing to do, but still. Charlie missed his home. He missed his dragons, and big planes of hills and sky and nothing. He missed his work. He knew he'd miss Harry though, too.
"So don't close them," Draco snaps. "Last chance to hide any of those kinky little fantasies of yours, Potter."
Harry’s not sure when he started smelling like home to Draco, but he likes the thought. Expensive cologne and lemony shampoo and old books and lots and lots of coffee has started smelling rather like home to him, too. Draco would call him an insufferable sap if he knew, which would be hypocritical, but that’s never stopped him before.)
He says, “You’re very funny, Pans. Very very funny. No, it’s nothing to do with Lucius. It’s just— fuck, I think this might be the stupidest thing I’ve done since then.”
And he does, every part of him, when he starts pushing inside. One hand goes to Malfoy’s hip while the other guides his cock as it’s swallowed in all that tight wetness, so much he could die. “Fuck,” he groans, “fuck, fuck. Why are you so fucking tight.”
Harry sucks at the tender spot by Draco’s ear, the whiny noise it draws going straight to his groin.
Harry lowers his wand, feeling sort of silly but also fully justified, to be totally honest. He’d died here not too long ago. So.
"I get there was no one else," Ron mutters. Merlin, he hates when Hermione gets all ... vulnerable. He
Inside the office, Pansy returns to the extravagant chair behind her desk and observes Draco with an arched brow.
“Oh fuck,” Draco moans, rocking back on Harry’s fingers, which feel even better inside him then they’d looked on his cock. “Fuck, fuck. Fuck me.”
"I don't trust him either," says Harry. "I just wanna finish fucking him so I can quit thinking about it."
Babies are significantly more work when they're outside of you, she's found, even with the several months paternity leave Ron's taken from the shop. Hermione is very, very happy, but she's also tired a lot, and stressed a lot, and no longer wishes to spend the precious little free time she has fretting over Harry, who is now very much a functioning adult.
The library in Pansy's Provincial Château was well stocked with Muggle Literature. A surprise, since her parents are no more progressive than Draco's own, but also not really (hypocrisy has always been the vice of high society. Among other things). They weren't far from the Mediterranean Sea, and so much of the summer was spent at its shore, Draco reading aloud to Pansy until she got restless and kicked the book from his hands. Then she'd produce some whiskey taken from the cellars, and they'd get drunk enough to skinny dip and bored and lonely enough to snog. Draco would pull away, and Pansy would lament that if only they weren't both gay, they'd have a perfect fuck buddy setup.
"You know, he'd also tell you he's really proud of you," he says a bit more quietly. "It's been pretty cool, watching you with Rosie. I always thought it'd be Percy having kids next."
Technically he's not doing anything stupid. Yes, Hermione would probably classify it as such, but they hadn't discussed differing opinions on what constitutes 'stupid,' so as far as he's concerned he's in the clear. Anyway, if she hadn't wanted him confronting Malfoy about his treachery she should have known better than to tell him.
Draco flushes, because it really, truely hadn’t occurred to him, and it definitely should have. Too late now. He shakes his head. “No time for that. Too busy— what’s the colloquialism? Gagging for it?”
“Buy me a drink first, Granger,” Pansy says, smoothly. She gestures to the chair opposite. “Have a seat.”
“It’s your decision, mate. I think it’s a bad idea. Hermione’ll go spare if she finds out I discouraged you, though. Whatever. Just be careful. I still don’t trust him, alright?”
Draco grabs at the balustrade behind him to steady himself. "If I had a wand, I'd Vanish you. I don't want your apology, Potter, kindly fuck off."
“I was just really grateful, I think,” he says, laughing quietly against Draco’s cheek. “I mean, I didn’t really question it when I spoke to a snake at the zoo, either, so. I don’t know. Maybe I was in a constant state of Dursley-induced dissociation.”
"Well there's nothing to worry about," he says. "Please, just ... don't talk to him about me, okay? It's weird and it'll drive me insane. And I promise
, and if he is it's because of the frankly inappropriate way —" But she cuts herself off, because it isn't worth it to get worked up and start yelling about how unhealthy she thinks his relationship with Pansy and Blaise is based on the things she's seen and heard. She takes a breath. Moves some hair out of her face. "Is this about Harry?" she asks again. "What's Draco said?"
Draco says, “How about this,” and twists himself so he can press his bare chest to Harry’s and nuzzle at his neck. “I’ll talk about the stars until you get hard again, and then you can edge me ‘till I can’t even remember which
Draco says, and he can feel his cheeks colouring, "No, Potter, I don't think we shall. I've got shit to do — might come as a terrible shock, but not all of us can coast through on our reputations. I'll be taking my notes back, thanks."
Charlie's not sure if Harry thinks he's being subtle, but either way, he's really, really not. He keeps his face as passive as he can (and it's difficult not only because he knows what Harry's getting at, but also because mention of Lucius Malfoy has always made his blood boil since he learned the role the bastard played in Ginny's near death) and says, "No, never had the pleasure."
Harry laughs. "Only because I stayed down there to save Fleur's sister," he says, crouching to grab a very flat-looking rock from the water. And because he knows it'll annoy Malfoy, he adds, "They gave me extra points for moral fibre, though. So I came in second." He stands, brushes some wet sand from the stone, and flicks it over the water where it bounces four times and sinks. "But don't worry, I ended up winning the tournament."
(“Give me some of your cologne to spray it with,” Draco requested, after Harry had helped levitate the thing into place and unfurl it beside the hearth. “It still smells like the Manor. I want it to smell like home.”
“Mm, yeah, there was this one old tosser on the Wizengamot who thought that was a little soft. His sister was a casualty, I think, in the first war. Suggested a probationary period, after which they could reevaluate my privileges.”
Not really surprised by the dubious answer, Harry just nods. Besides the openly sexual relationship they all apparently have and a bit of what Harry’s seen over the years, he doesn’t actually have much idea about how close Draco is with his friends or what that dynamic looks like from the inside.
isn’t the word he’d have used. “In what, exactly? Making sure you’re not handing out cursed necklaces and poisoned mead?”
They lie for a while, Draco with his eyes closed and Harry looking at the stars a little but at Draco the most, until an arm shifts beneath his.
“Ta ta,” Draco says, and leaves before Potter can look at him like that anymore than he already has.
“Right,” says Hermione. Annoyed and keeping it to herself. “Thank you.” And goes to sit down on one of the outrageously luxurious sofas.
Harry shoots an affronted look Malfoy's way. "A little refined for me, don't you think? Also it’s ugly."
"Good." Draco indulges Harry's beckoning, deepening the kiss and clasping his hands over Harry's on his waist.
“You know, Malfoy,” he says, closing in on his space, “you’re not nearly as clever as you think you are.” He slides his fingers over the material of Malfoy’s shirt, finding the bump of the navel ring and tugging gently. The other hand goes to his hip. “How long have you been gagging for this, exactly?”
Of course, Pansy wouldn't understand. Draco himself doesn't quite understand. He just knows that wanting Potter in any capacity leaves him vulnerable, and vulnerability is something that should always be avoided in dealings with ones enemies.
George makes a face. He doesn't actually care, obviously. It was weird at first, especially because of Ginny and that situation, but in the end he was happy they were happy. Still, he likes to be a bit of a child about it, for fun.
"Yeah, he wanted to race me," says Harry. He gives Charlie a shit-eating grin. "I won. He's getting a bit old, aren't you, Charlie?"
, Harry thinks. Only half. Mostly from the straw. Whatever. “Well. There’s a bloke staring at me over your shoulder. He's very fit. A real Adonis type, you know.”
“Your assistant is a cow, Pans,” Draco says, and then louder to make sure Dominique can hear him through the door, “A daft fucking cow!”
, and she'll invite over whomever she sees fit, but it doesn't quite ring true. The cottage is kind of Harry's place, too. "Does he really make you that uncomfortable?"
She takes the cigarette back, shakes her head as she hits it. "What a massive fucking prick," she says around the smoke. "And he told you it
Hermione’s one for talking about feelings, never letting things fester, so Ron’s spent a lot of time pondering the distortion of time after grief with her. To him, that first year after the battle stretched out interminably, and those after that, with the wedding, the pregnancy, a literal, actual child, have gone very quickly indeed.
Draco laughs, but there’s no humour in it. “That Monday, I had a hearing. They were deciding whether to end or extend my probation. Guess which they chose.”
“Is this some kind of third-wheel rebellion against Granger and Weasley?” Draco says, but he moves with Potter to the arched doors of frosted glass that open out into the gardens behind the greenhouse.
Skipping past the warm little twist he feels as Potter hands over his wand without hesitation, Draco manoeuvres himself around. He feels a little ridiculous Casting on his own ass, but it’s well worth it when he gives the wand back to Potter and feels a hard cock against his now slicked hole.
Draco makes a sound of protest in the back of his throat, then says, "You only did it for the acclaim."
For a two-word sentence it riddles Harry with a lot of emotion. He stares at Malfoy for a long few seconds, taking him in from his familiar white-blond hair to the sharp nose and the no-longer sneering mouth, and it feels distinctly like it’s the first time he’s actually looking at him.
“Malfoy,” he says in the entrance hall, catching him before he starts descending into the dungeons, back to Slytherin probably. "Wait."
Blaise gives Pansy a look, who gives him a quelling one in return that he ignores. He gets up and reseats himself beside Draco with an arm slung about his slim shoulders. "Pouting is the same as sulking, baby boy," Blaise hums against his cheek. He takes Draco's chin and turns his face so he can kiss him on the mouth. "Stop thinking about it," he says. "Put him out of your mind. He's a troglodyte."
, right?” says Harry, teasing him and yet perfectly serious. “Right after it makes its rounds through the Hogwarts gossip mill.”
Sitting back on his heels, Draco bites gently at Harry's wiry inner thigh, just because it's there. "I'm surprised," he murmurs.
“I will,” he says, and means it. He loves seeing Charlie with his dragons. “Maybe I’ll come in January too. Kinda need to get the fuck out of here for a while, I think.”
Ron knows a lot about complicated histories. Of course, he never hated Hermione in the way Harry hated Malfoy, not ever, but a lot of the time he spent complaining about her or bitching at her was definitely all mixed up in really wanting to touch her hair. "So would you like, er." Ron doesn't think he can look at Harry when he says this. He doesn't think Harry would want him to. "Want Malfoy to be your boyfriend, or something?"
?" Harry says defensively. His head is spinning, to be fucking frank: what world, he wonders, is Malfoy living in where he finds the bollocks to go behind his back to his own best friend? "What the hell did he tell you?"
Draco says, "Of course." He's not quite in the mood for Granger's particular brand of support and general niceness, this afternoon. He's been here since three PM yesterday.
And frot; rutting against each other feverishly, knees pushed between thighs and closer, closer, and Harry’s head falling to Draco’s shoulder at the staggering friction on his leaking cock. Shit.
Draco grunts a little, Harry’s thighs tight on either side of him. Skidding his nails along Potter’s back, he says, “How homosexual of you. What would your fans say if they found out you were a ponce?”
Ron doesn’t especially want to talk about it, either. It’s just that Hermione thinks he’ll fair better than she will, and if Ron’s not a good enough friend to put the whole Malfoy-in-a-sexual-context thing (which is completely nauseating) aside and have this conversation for Harry’s sake, he’s at least a good enough husband to do it for hers.
tip Harry right over the edge. He pounds into Malfoy’s yielding body without restraint, his orgasm washing through him in a wave of euphoria that sparks all his nerve-endings, and he can feel his own come start leaking out around his cock, easing the slide as he keeps pumping. He slows only gradually, squeezing Malfoy’s wrists and panting against his jaw.
“Not where I would’ve expected to find you,” Harry says. He rests a hand on top of the white marble tomb, feeling its chill. Imagining Dumbledore in there with the Elder Wand. “You come out here a lot?”
At first, Charlie moved back into his old bedroom. Its angled walls were papered in posters of dragons and brooms, the weird bands he'd liked as a kid. The picture of a Muggle girl in a bra and knickers that he'd shoved into his bedside draw — when he'd still been pretending to be straight and too busy with Quidditch to ever have a girlfriend — was still there, too.
When Harry removes his mouth, the skin is red and purple and his lips are slick with spit. “Would you like that?”
“No, Draco,” she says sarcastically. “I can’t remember a thing about it. Is this something to do with your father? What’s going on?”
Until Potter’s vague motion, Draco hadn’t realised where they were. His mother had told him what happened here one night before their trials, as frail and grief-stricken as he’d ever seen her.
expected that to work, but it was worth a try. It's probably just the morning sunlight filtering in through the glass, but Malfoy looks softer than usual and perhaps more given to suggestion. It also turns his hair gold, which Harry feels really weird about in terms of the way it makes his stomach feel.
“Gonna fuck you now, Draco,” Harry says — Draco moans and pushes his arse back into Harry’s hips — “within an inch of your life. Gonna shag your brains out.”
“Good,” Charlie says. “Yes, Harry, good.” He’s about a hair’s breadth from coming as well, even though he usually has more stamina. He usually does, but not so much with Harry.
"The only thing gagging is your ego for a flattering. Go bask in the adoration of some fourth-year bints and leave me the fuck alone," Draco says. He turns, banging his way back through the swinging glass doors and into the greenhouse.
"He is a prat," Draco says, sinking back into the bath and leaning his head against the cool porcelain. He wants Pansy to stroke his hair again, so he makes a small noise and lolls it in her direction. "Do hate him."
kind of asshole act going that’s really working for him, but whatever. He’s sure his smirk says it well enough.
He's getting too close, and some part of Harry wants to toy with Malfoy a little bit too. Maybe to see how desperate he can get. So Harry slows down, rocking into him instead of pounding, and bends to press a series of kisses along his shoulders. "I wanna see your face," he says. "Can we move to the floor?"
“Yeah,” Harry laughs weakly. “Right.” He has to pause a moment, completely overwhelmed by how fucking unbelievable it feels and afraid if he goes too fast he’ll come before he has a chance to enjoy it. Once he’s regained himself he sinks the rest of the way inside, grinding into him when he’s flush against his arse. The grip is fucking unbelievable.
“Fuck,” Harry groans. He tosses his glasses to the side and shakes his sweaty hair out of his face and redoubles his efforts, finally allowing himself to focus on the growing tension in his body instead of fighting it. He fucks into Malfoy fast and hard, his hand squeezing and tugging Malfoy’s cock, and it’s with a raspy, half-gone voice that he says, “Say my name. Tell me you want it.”
“So, Potter,” says Malfoy, resting back on his elbows, popping sharp blades of slim shoulders under red fabric. “How is every little thing?”
Harry's hand stutters for a second and he groans into Malfoy's sweet-smelling neck. He stops long enough to spit in his other hand and try a different angle, and with the way Malfoy's cock is leaking pre-come the slide is perfect. It's oddly easier this way and he even finds a good rhythm that he can tell is working for Malfoy too. He wants to watch but can't help kissing him instead just to taste his panting breaths and little moans.
“Less than ten minutes, and you’ve already wrangled mention of your tedious heroics. I shouldn’t expect any less, I suppose.”
“You. And Malfoy. He’s coming this way.” Scratch that, Drunk Ron is an absolute menace. Harry wishes death upon him and his kin.
“So glad you’re joining us, Malfoy,” he says sarcastically, “what would we have done without your pretentious French food? Perished under the weight of our lack of culture, surely. Thank god you’re here to save us.
“I’m sorry, I rather thought my presence had been requested — nay, demanded, at six oh five on the dot,” Draco says, Summoning a cigarette from Blaise’s pack. “It’s not my fault you two are incapable of keeping your
"You told her?" he says loudly the second Malfoy steps through the door into the blistering cold. "Are you out of your fucking mind?"
Harry’s fingers where they are, “Mess” is all Draco manages to get out of the snide comment he’d planned. He thinks the effect is much the same.
to be charming, but still is. Hermione's mostly interested in Draco's dislike, though. It's kind of cute. "You've good taste, Draco. Roqberry is one of my favourites."
“Give me a break, Malfoy,” Harry bites out. “You didn’t immediately get the answer you wanted from me so now we’re back where we started? You can’t force people to figure things out at
Draco would have laughed, if not for the lurch in his stomach. “You're much too earnest, it's embarrassing. I was talking about you.”
means. He's too busy pushing his tongue past Malfoy's tight ring of muscle, where, by the way, he tastes fucking
good at this, Harry can feel his prick touch the back of Malfoy’s throat before he’s pulling out just to rub the head across that full lower lip, glistening with spit and come.
“Good,” Blaise says. He pushes Draco’s shirt up, trails his fingers along the lines of his Adonis belt to watch goose bumps appear on his milky white skin. Then further up, where he plucks at the navel ring which matches his own. “He had his chance, right, baby? He doesn’t get another.”
. Maybe I will go and see Blaise. You and your cold, unsympathetic heart will rue the day, Pans, when Blaise knows and you don’t, and it’ll serve you—
her cloak. "Come, let's go get drunk at my flat. Maybe Blaise will join us, I'm sure he'd be happy to give you a quick fuck."
Harry waves a hand (how is it that it looks all elegant and aristocratic when Malfoy does it? When he does it, it feels kind of grotesquely jovial.) “It’s okay. He wasn’t actually executed, did you know? Buckbeak.”
"Draco's said many things that have made me rather concerned and, frankly, aggrieved, about his little tiff with Potter," says Pansy. Granger's starting to get these pink spots on her cheeks, and she's sitting stiff and far forward in her chair. Pansy leans back. "And I'll remind you, Granger, that I know Draco far better than you should ever hope to. Really, I take no pleasure in it, he's a complete terror, but I know what's good for him, and what's not. Potter is not. You, by extension, are also not."
“Tapenade, Ronald,” Hermione repeats, flashing him a dangerous look over her shoulder. “It’s French.” Harry’s still glaring at Malfoy: he should know his audacity, that Harry absolutely does not approve of this, would in fact approve of the giant
Not the best response, but in all fairness Draco looks pretty similarly any time he has an overnight shift.
He’s clearly avoiding the topic, for which Narcissa can’t really blame him. Still, she can’t help but be interested.
"Have a nice day, Healer Granger," the receptionist says as she's leaving, and Hermione doesn't bother returning the sentiment.
“It’s your life,” Draco says, rather stunned. Perhaps there’s a part of him that still refuses to accept the extent of Potter’s good-ness, that wants to believe everything he’s done stemmed from desires not entirely altruistic. Possibly, it’s because he’s never done well when confronted with his own moral failings, but possibly, it’s because he simply doesn’t understand it. Draco doesn’t think he has it in him to be selfless.
It's the worst not only because he misses Freddie so much he was physically ill a few times throughout the day, but because everyone looks at him. They try not to, and he appreciates no one bringing it up, but he can feel their sympathetic gazes on his back and it just makes him feel lonely.
“So good, fuck, Draco,” Harry moans, and Draco mewls desperately in response. Harry feels cleaved in two (which is er, rather ironic, he supposes) at the vulnerability of the sound, the marble beauty of Draco’s naked, pliant form, bent over before him. When his hip bones are flush to Draco’s arse, he starts to thrust. Draco wants it—
“Yeah, well, unlike you, I have a conscience to worry about,” Harry says flatly. As they crest the stairs leading back up to the first floor Harry touches Malfoy’s shoulder to stop him. “Don’t say anything, alright? Seriously.”
“Hm. Of course, you could, but wouldn’t you miss seeing me fucked into complete senselessness?” Draco says. “Cock-drunk?”
"At what point," says Draco, "is it more prudent to simply eat the grounds right out of the bag? I’ve always wondered.”
,” and lets the thrum of arousal soak through him when Potter slams his palms flush to the slippery metal.
“No,” he says, as Harry turns back to the sink with burning cheeks and vigorously washes a plate that’s already clean. “Harry. Gross.”
, kind of, and now Harry pushes himself off the wall, and Draco straightens his trousers, and Harry winks or some such nonsense, and they both disappear into the crowd.
“Then we need to just not talk about it,” Ron says with a shrug. “You know? Don’t bring him round when Harry’s here or might show up, try to make sure they don’t run into each other at Mungo’s. Out of sight, out of mind, right? I mean, it’s Harry, he
Harry regrets asking suddenly; he hates the way he can see Malfoy touch his sleeve, and he hates the nearness to the subject of Lucius. The last time they'd been together, Malfoy had tried to slap him over his (admittedly a bit cruel) comment.
Number two: Granger is simply far too intelligent. Draco, in his adolescence, came to realise that there was a distinct variation between what he could get away with in Greg and Vince’s company, and what he could get away with in Pansy’s (which was precisely nothing). And now Vince is gone, and Greg doesn’t want to see any of them anymore, and Draco has no friends with whom his shit will be put up. If he wanted any more (which he does not) he wouldn't be recruiting another
Harry brushes Draco’s cock with his knuckles, softly enough to retain plausible deniability in the face of an accusation. He is a junior Auror, after all. “Is that a star? (brush) Or a constellation?”
piss off then, if I'm bothering you so much. Would you like to give me a list of places you'll be hiding out for the next month so I don't accidentally disturb you?"
"You know, t's not very politic to go around biting people you want things from," he tells Klaus, who is chirping now as Harry fills his bowl with kibble and replaces the water. He still pets his head before he leaves, though, because even when he's annoyed he's always found the little crunching sounds very cute.
“These are so much fun again now you got rid of that bint Natalie,” says Seamus, completely unnecessarily, in Harry’s opinion. But Parvati decides to agree loudly.
Harry laughs against his neck. Stalls Malfoy’s hips and puts pressure on his upper back so he’ll lean over again. “I’m sure you are,” Harry says. He slips his fingers between Malfoy’s arse again and rubs them over his tight-feeling hole. Harry’s cock twitches in anticipation. Carefully, he slides the tip of his middle finger inside, then to the second knuckle, then all the way, and it’s so warm and tight he could lose his mind. “Good?”
with me for that?” Harry says, somewhat sardonically. “I’ll do a better job of dying next time, shall I?”
"Perhaps your father wasn't as much of an utter despot as mine," Draco says, waiting until he can be certain in the stability of his voice before he speaks. Lucius has been like this for quite some time now, since Azkaban and maybe even a little bit before, but still it unnerves him. His father has never been terribly warm, but Draco doesn't remember his eyes being quite so frigid when he left for France as they were when he got back. Now they're worse, all milky and gelid, and Draco doesn't want to look at them.
Perhaps, when Potter had said fancy, he meant: I think you want to shag me. And that was true. But there was other stuff, as well.
Palming the wand with the same earnest tug he felt the night before, Draco considers this. He’s become used to self-reliance — an adjustment that was unsurprisingly rough after a childhood of whims easily catered to. He supposes the last time he was offered help it was by Severus, and the last time it was given to him, without favour, was by Harry.
Draco's leaning towards the latter, and also Pansy, who slides an arm around his waist to keep him from swaying. Perhaps he's drunker than he thought.
Ron's good, though. Surprisingly enough, he's actually been the most helpful. Having him at the store to take Freddie's place wound up being the best possible decision for a lot of reasons: Ron's enjoying it, for one. And he's got a real knack for running a business, too. The other thing is that of all their brothers, Ron was always closest to him and Fred. Ginny too, but she's off playing Quidditch and is far too energetic and ambitious to like running a joke shop.
Harry’s stomach clenches painfully with arousal. “Shit,” he mutters, pulling his fingers out and fumbling with his jeans. “Fuck, shouldn’t we … I don’t have a condom. And don’t we need … need lube or something?”
Draco asked for Harry’s hands. Harry puts them on his waist. Skims the band of expensive material he finds there. “So fucking small. Tight. With these trousers.”
He's not on Auror mode, so Harry's a millisecond slow realising Malfoy's lifting his arm. But his reflexes have always been infallible — he catches his wrist before the slap lands, surprised and angry and somehow devastated.
“I don’t think you’re pathetic,” Harry says emphatically, perhaps too much so thanks to the alcohol in his blood. He’s relieved, though, to know the Ministry isn’t confiscating wands to interrogate. It couldn’t do anything, but he still doesn’t like the idea of it in anyone’s hands but Malfoy’s, to whom it belongs. “What’s the problem then, why don’t you have it?”
“Stay a minute,” Harry repeats. The joint, when he offers it again, glows dimly in the darkness. “Please?”
“Nice,” Harry says again. He tries not to picture Narcissa wandering endlessly, aimlessly around that huge, depressing manor with only Lucius Malfoy for company. It makes him feel rather sick. “I was never really a fan of gardening myself. Couldn't get into plants and Herbology.” But perhaps that’s because Aunt Petunia forced him to do their gardening in the beating sun for hours at a time. Who knows.
“Comes naturally,” Draco says, deciding not to be offended. “Besides,” he adds, “pot, kettle. My namesake is the dragon that guarded the gardens of the Hesperides. Who’s yours? ‘Harry’ is horribly common, you know. Though you are too, so I suppose it’s quite well-suited.”
doing it, fuck absolutely everything and how much he hates Malfoy or how he's the most annoying git in the universe, because his lips have been taunting Harry all night and he's tipsy and hard and Ron and Hermione have a fucking kid and he, Harry, hasn't even slept with anyone in a quarter of a year and he kind of deserves this, whatever it is, a lapse into poor judgment he'll certainly pay for eventually ...
Hermione laughs. "Well, you could. They have plenty of antioxidants, lots of caffeine, obviously. But it wouldn't be easy to chew, and they're very acidic. Everything alright?"
Draco laves Harry’s warm, eager tongue with his own. Cloying physical exhaustion joining his emotional torpor, he thinks he would quite like to be back in the plushy four-poster, with its quilted maroon pillows and a curtain to separate them from the world outside.
Charlie got pretty good at reading Harry, so he can tell he's a little miffed at that. Charlie is too, really — Harry turned out to be a brilliant fuck and he's looking fitter than ever. It's for the best, though.
"Really?" he says sharply. His grip is just tight enough so Malfoy would have a hard time pulling away, but not enough to really hurt. "You're gonna hit me, Malfoy? Did I strike a nerve?"
Draco nods, "Yes, whatever," lets Potter guide him to the ground and gasps when he fucks into him from in front, this time, knelt with a hand braced either side of Draco's head.
. When she's drunk she likes to admit to them how grateful she is to have two such filthy and promiscuous best mates.
Harry rolls his eyes. "Course it did. You know, I could have fucking murdered you that year and probably not felt very bad about it," he informs Draco, fascinated by the way his body remembers all that rage, a ghost of the way it had felt. "You still have the badge? I would love to choke you while you're wearing it."
"Wouldn't you love that." Draco flexes his wrists against the squeeze. It's actually starting to hurt a bit.
He collapses into another fit of giggles at the gormless expression on Harry’s face, and then stops with a soft grunt of “oh” when Harry turns him around and pushes him against the stone wall.
"Potter," Draco says. He should've known a whole week couldn't pass without his peace being intruded upon by twerpy golden boys and their twerpy fucking ways.
“How thoughtful,” Harry comments. Thankfully at that moment a house-elf (not Kreacher, who must be sleeping) comes to greet them and Harry asks for his hot cocoa as well as Malfoy’s coffee with two sugars.
The weight of Charlie's arm is a presence he's missed. He thinks it might even be possible, if Charlie were less of a noncommittal person, to put the Malfoy thing away for good, never to be revisited.
“How offensive. And in this cathedral of acceptance,” says Malfoy. He hasn’t moved back. There’s smudges around his eyes. Smoky black smudges behind his lashes, on the corners of his lids. They’re a little drippy, like he put on eyeliner two nights ago, passed out on the floor of a club, and hasn’t stopped to reapply since.
Perhaps not as much of a functioning adult as Hermione had thought. “Fine, Harry. Hello, Terry. How are you?”
Lucius sneers, watching his son look anywhere but at him. Draco looks so much like himself, and his father Abraxas before him: the eyes, the jaw, the nose. But he’d inherited Narcissa’s emotional weaknesses, her penchant for disobedience when the situation doesn’t please her. It’s pitiful, embarrassing. Tragic, to be sure. Only one heir they’d made, and he’s a disgrace.
Ah, yes. She remembers well the story of McLaggen’s Beater bat but under the circumstances keeps the smirk off her face. “Then what, pray tell, is the problem, Draco? Be a big boy and get off with him, if we’re lucky you’ll break his heart while you’re at it and we can laugh about it for a few weeks.”
Pansy lifts a smug grin to Draco as he rises from his chair the same way he’s always done when he’s building steam. She decides not to point out the sheer number of times he’s done exactly this to her whilst ranting about the Pleb Who Lived.
. "Maybe I’m not in any position to forgive Malfoy anything. Maybe it’s about him feeling remorseful for what he did, and me choosing to focus on the fact that he even
Draco crosses the leg closest to Potter over the other. Fucking little cunt. He says, “It sounds like you’re trying to tell me I’m desperate for your Chosen fucking cock, or whatever, and I’m sure I’m mistaken, so feel free to elucidate.”
Unbelievable. “Just because I have opinions on what’s right and wrong doesn’t mean I see in black and white,” Harry says bitterly, recovering finally from his misstep. “But fine, I’ll give it a try. I didn’t know you read Muggle literature.”
His stomach does a weird nervous flip and Harry stops grinning. He moves a little closer, anxiously crossing his arms over his chest. “What’s the difference, exactly?”
Draco takes his tea, which is perfectly, hedonistically sugary, just as he’s always liked it. “I’ve a residency on the Spell Damage ward for the next six months. With Hermione Granger.”
“I would, wouldn’t I?” Draco says, and gives Harry’s shoulder a little pat. “See how some of the shiny white dots are bigger than the others? That string of big ones just to the left of us — left is that way, Potter — is what you’re looking for.”
“So good,” Harry says, collecting the remnants of Draco’s spunk from his lips with his tongue. “So good for me pet.”
Harry kissed Charlie first, when he'd been home for almost a year. It was New Years Eve, and Harry was drunk. Charlie was drunk too, but Harry was eighteen and Charlie was twenty-four, so he decided to be responsible.
Hermione pays the tab at the bar, and Ron leans heavily on Harry’s shoulder. Until he decides to pull Harry into his chest and bury his chin in his hair.
Klaus says nothing, probably because it's a stupid question. Harry flips onto his side, staring into the dark, and thinks that maybe next time they go to the pub and some bird tries talking to him he should give her a chance.
“Draco,” Harry says softly, putting a hand on his shoulder and running it slowly down his arm. He’s tempted to kiss it and though he hesitates, he does it eventually. When he sees Draco’s eyes finally flutter open, he does it again. “Sorry. We should get you out of here before everyone wakes up.”
intentional mistake. He stares at Malfoy another second, back and forth between cool grey eyes that he still can't read, and finally steps away, turning back to the sink just as Ron comes in.
It’s hard for him, but Harry stays silent while Charlie talks. It’s not that he doesn’t trust Ron and Hermione and Ginny and everyone else, but there’s a calm rationality about Charlie, a willingness to listen rather than posit conclusions, that Harry really respects and puts a lot of stock in. And beyond that, it’s kind of nice that Charlie doesn’t know Malfoy.
“Doesn’t count,” Draco insists. He grazes Harry’s lips with his teeth, trying to knock the stupid smile out of them.
“Why not? You were bloody voluntary with several details you had to have known would scar me for life the other day.”
Sixth year was truly the only time since meeting Harry Potter that Draco had gone long periods of time without thinking about him. Pansy ruined it, on occasion, by giggling at the irony of Draco pulling off to the thought of him. She thought that was all there was to it. It wasn’t.
There’s some kind of faint, rolling beat surrounding them, more of a reverberated feeling through plaster and drywall from the flat next door than proper sound. Harry’s glad for it; he thinks, vaguely, nonsensically, that silence would feel rather deafening after the noise of the club.
Draco turns back to him with a wicked smile. “Ask me no questions and I shall tell you no lies, Auror Potter.”
“Could you cease with the histrionics? I was walking,” Draco says. He’d like to step back for the distance Potter is closing between them, but his back is already close to flat against the branches behind him.
expected Malfoy not to notice his staring, but it's still fucking humiliating being called out on it, which makes twice now. He wants to hit him. He also wants to kiss him and see if he can taste the wine on his lips. The fact that he hasn't moved makes Harry think that maybe Malfoy wouldn't stop him if he tried, which he doesn’t currently feel like analysing.
“That’s exactly it,” says Harry. He’s glad the lighting is limited to what’s coming in through the window because he’s flushed with all sorts of emotion. “Funny, though, isn’t it? All that pussy and it’s baby Death Eater in my bed.”
Which won’t do. “Gonna flip you over pet. Want to see you come again,” Harry says, pulling out, flipping warm-pliant-beautiful Draco over and thrusting back into his supine form.
Other times (today is one of those times) he capitulates to the urge, knowing it's pointless to punish himself when he can't help it. And those times (today, now) he takes himself in hand and presses his face against his arm and pretends it's Malfoy's arse he's sliding into instead of his fist, and he remembers the way Malfoy sounded when he said 'please', and he fucks his hand the way he would've fucked Malfoy if he hadn't been such a cowardly prat in that lift, and he comes with a groan and imagines he's buried inside Malfoy, trapped against the wall, and for a blissful few moments he doesn't care about anything.
Startled, Narcissa pats Draco’s back until he seems to have moved past the episode. “Darling, are you alright?”
Wait. "What?" Harry says, brought up short by this suggestion. "No, she ... what are you talking about? She doesn't know, I only told ..." Ron. That fucking berk. "Look. No one
Ginny likes being the youngest child for many reasons, principle of which is that it means she can usually skive off chores pretty easily. Right now, for instance, Ron and Bill are trying to get Teddy and Victoire away from their presents long enough to have breakfast (fuck, they’re cute and all, but she’s never having kids), and Mum’s wrangled George and Perce into chopping potatoes and whipping cream, and she’s sitting on the couch, with Harry by her side.
At Blaise (not the person, the bar. Yeah. The Slytherin ego truly is a wonderful thing), Malfoy often wears button ups buttoned down to below the sternum, and trousers that sit low on his hips and tight on his bum.
Clawing his way out of his fucking sweater prison, Draco stares at Potter, feeling incredibly indignant but also like he might cry. "Why would you do that?" he says.
“This guy went down like a sack o’ potatoes,” Terry wheezes, banging the tabletop with his palm. Ron’s in tears as well. Harry sips his beer through pursed lips. “Sorry, mate,” Terry slings an arm round Harry’s shoulders and punches his arm, which is holding his beer, which sloshes over the rim and onto his shirt. “You shoulda seen the look on your face when you ate shit, that’s all.”
He’d only told Pansy (not Blaise; he’s not that masochistic), who had said ‘Do you want me to pretend I’m surprised?’.
“Our little Draco doesn’t have it in him, do you, darling?” She laughs again when he wriggles away from her and pinches his arm for good measure. “He told me Potter got a bit dommy on him,” she says, grinning wickedly.
Harry wants to be inside, he simply wants until he’s shaking with it, until he pushes the flimsy fabric of Draco’s knickers to the side instead of taking them off and fucks into him.
Harry's so pretty. Charlie's thought so ever since he saw him at Bill's wedding (before he Polyjuiced into another Weasley sprog, of course), looking very serious and much older than he really was.
Harry’s chest flutters a little the way Draco says good morning, all sleep-heavy and open. He says, “Morning,” and, unable to resist, presses a soft kiss to his mouth. “You sleep like the dead.”
Draco grabs her arm. Pansy slaps his hand with her heaviest ring, but he holds on. "Unhand me, Draco."
Since it's rather clear that Potter's not fucking off anytime soon, Draco creases the corner of his page and sets the book on his lap. "To be fair," he says, "I wouldn't trust you much either."
With a snort, George pulls his legs in finally. "Yeah, alright. Don't wanna give you nightmares or anything." He nudges him with his foot again, this time in the leg. It's time for Ickle Ronnie to get to bed. "Good talk, little brother. For real. Thanks."
Harry hadn’t the energy left in him to explain (yet again) the ways in which Hermione doesn’t understand Quidditch, and why that was a wholly ridiculous comparison.)
He’s coming, and Harry’s teeth are grazing over his jaw. He’s coming, hot and messy between them, and Potter’s still fucking mercilessly up into him. He’s coming, he’s blind with it, and Potter’s spunk is leaking out of him.
Harry doesn’t have time to agree (scathingly) before Hermione’s opening the door and Malfoy’s walking inside holding something, probably food, but Harry’s too busy glaring at his immediately-infuriating, unnaturally symmetrical, pointy git face.
gone to see him. It's why he's so thoroughly ticked off about this, because he'd needed a lot more time to try and figure out what to say.
, Cancer’s just by the Moon, which is why you can’t see it as well. But it’s got the Beehive Cluster, which has, hm, thousand stars, or something.”
Potter skips another stone. He’s annoyingly good at it. “I’m not sure why you’re telling me this. I’ve always known you were an attention whore.”
“Yes,” agrees Draco, closing his knees tight around Harry’s. “It’s part of Canis Major. See the way it goes back there, and then into the tail?”
"Oh, I don't think that's necessary," Pansy says. She pulls on her skirt, tucks her blouse into it, and goes to sit beside Draco, where she takes his chin and places a kiss on his cheek. "I forgot I'd asked you to come. We were only going to try and bribe you into joining our little orgy. I suppose we could do dinner instead?"
There's a brief silence filled in by the sound of the wind outside and the crackling fire. A creak of wood upstairs, probably Ginny, not yet asleep. It smells like pine and gingerbread and his childhood, which is both wonderfully nostalgic and very sad.
He looks at him across the lift and wonders what the fuck he's supposed to say, and what’s suppos ed to happen now. What he even
It’s looking at him all cagily through the folds of the little orange (of course, bleh) blanket. It doesn’t trust him, probably, raised in a house constantly inhabited by Gryffindors and Weasleys. Which are synonymous.
Charlie says, “We were catching up. Reminiscing, you know,” and George snorts a laugh and whacks Ron on the back of the head.
"Neville," says Dean, "your snores could wake the dead. If you can sleep through that, you can sleep through anything, mate."
Pansy's sharp gaze travels from her assistant’s Moschino pumps, up dark-stockinged legs, to her pretty face.
"The badge stayed on," Draco says haughtily. It never fails to make his cock twitch when Harry says things like that. Unsurprising. The guilty fantasies he'd played over and over in his mind often stemmed from pondering what exactly Potter would do to shut him up. If Draco just pushed him so far ...
Out of nothing more than desperation, he punches a few of the lift buttons again and when it doesn't work, he throws his robes against the wall. How long have they been in here? It can't be more than fifteen minutes yet it feels like hours, and he can't stop thinking about that obnoxious little navel piercing, and it's bloody
Harry doesn't say anything at first. It sounds like something Hermione would tell him — erring on the side of logic instead of emotion. He wonders sometimes if the Sorting Hat had thought about putting Charlie in Ravenclaw, like Hermione, but he's never asked.
"Thanks," Harry says, taking it from him. It's an old copy with not much in the way of cover art, just the title and author, and he thinks that suits Malfoy. "Feel like telling me where you were?"
It's nice to know that Luna is still completely batty. Hermione's friends with Malfoy, and Harry wants to fuck him, and Pansy Parkinson walks up to them in pubs and starts talking about sex, but some things never change.
"A cunt. Fuck." Draco tilts his head back against Potter's pillow, wanting more of those teeth grazing his throat. "And I don't like you."
"You know what?" he says darkly, "Good. Five years, you haven't changed in the slightest. You're exactly the same, and I don't know why you're hiding it in front of Hermione but let me assure you of something: she
Dominique nods, shuts the door with a soft click. It’s childish, perhaps, making Granger wait. But Pansy’s always been a touch the antagonist. She simply can’t resist.
“Including you,” Harry adds. “Your wand worked really well for me. In retrospect I s’pose it’s because you trusted me.”
He swallows hard. Instead of answering, though, he lets his inebriation lead him, leans forward himself and kisses Malfoy with his heart hammering and his palms sweaty where they fall tentatively to Malfoy’s hips. Everything happens quickly, mouths opening and tongues pressing together and Harry feels like he can't get enough, can't taste enough, can't
"That's different," says Harry sarcastically, going to join Draco at the row of sinks. "I haven't felt comfortable around her since fourth year when she spied on me in the fucking Prefects' bath."
Blaise grins and gives him another lingering kiss that he trails down to his jaw. His hand moves to the back of Draco’s neck, thumb making circles against his skin. “Are we done with Potter?”
Grabbing Malfoy’s jumper off the ground, he brings it to him and hands it over. “Maybe we just take it a day at a time,” he says. “I’m gonna have to deal with Ron and Hermione.”
“Alright,” Pansy allows once they’re settled and basking in the glow of the fairy lights and the view, “this was a fantastic idea.”
"Seamus, you idiot," Dean scolds him. Harry pauses with his fork halfway to his mouth and frowns at him.
"Yes, I guessed that much, you whited sepulchre. Plaster saint," Draco says. He was jesting (sort of) before, but now he's really feeling the bloodlust.
“Thank you," he says, "that’s nice of you to say. I wouldn’t actually know why they named me Harry seeing as I never got to meet them, but I bet it’s because they could already tell I’d be common.” He takes a long drag, holds it in his lungs a while and then exhales through his nose. “Yours fits you too since it’s stupid-sounding and pretentious.”
He watches him go without a word, toying with the idea of going after him (which he does not), and then presses the button that’ll take him down to the first floor, knowing perfectly well he’ll be unable to concentrate at work the rest of the day and wondering how hard Hermione will take it when Malfoy suddenly starts refusing to see her anymore outside of work.
Let the pair of them believe what they want, he’ll tell them at dinner and have them both choking on their chardonnay.
Draco sighs, and tangles the hand that’s not curled around this wine glass in Harry’s. “What else would it be? We’re compatible, you know.”
It does look rather placid. And sweet, Draco supposes. It’s got Weasley’s complexion though, the poor thing.
Harry’s hands off him now, Draco collapses heavily against the wall, shoulder blades sharp against the cold stone. He says, “Okay.”
"I can't believe you left her with him," Ron says hotly. "Just to try and convince us he's changed—"
gotten out of him. Suddenly he wants to make him say more things, make more noises. So as difficult as it is, he puts both hands on Malfoy's hips and stills them.
unsurprising, isn't it? Thank you, Pans. Yes, so, we're in the lift, and Potter is tragically hard over the stunning aesthetics of my exterior, and through no fault of my own — don't
There’s a moment of silence that draws out, both Pansy and Blaise waiting for more, until Blaise says, “
Malfoy’s pissed, the same way he is. And he’s never seen Malfoy drunk, so he’s really got no idea what pushing things will do, but he doesn’t have enough sober logic at the moment to make good decisions.
"Good," she says. "You know, I was just reading this fascinating article about the effects of a Stasis Charm on areas of swelling in —"
Maybe it's because he's tipsy. Maybe it's because he hasn't seen Malfoy in ... two years? Three? And he's remembered suddenly how much his mere presence makes Harry feel agitated on a molecular level. Maybe it's the way Malfoy says
If Granger had been Draco’s friend before (which, just to reiterate, she was not), she definitely wouldn’t be anymore.
Harry swallows, looking up at him. “Yeah,” he says. “I do. Love you. I want you to come live with me.”
Harry turns Draco at the hips, hears the thunk of his palms bracing on the wood as he tugs Draco’s trousers to pool around his ankles.
Hmph. If this is Gryffindor hospitality, then. Well. Draco is much too distracted to think of a snippy conclusion, at the present moment. It’s shit, is the gist.
"He'd have taken the absolute piss out of you for getting married and having a bloody kid before you're twenty-five. Completely unforgivable, Ron."
She says, "Salazar. I only request you keep a slight distance where possible, until he sets himself right again. You may not believe he's delicate, fine, but know that as capable as he seems, Draco's never been good at taking care of himself. He lets things consume him, without intervention. I've seen it too many times. I won't see it again."
“I don’t usually drink cognac,” Hermione says, although she accepts the glass she’s handed. She cradles it in her hand, not tasting it yet. “I’ll have to take your word for it, I suppose.”
of those feelings, that much is true, but they're unavoidably there regardless of his inability to make sense of them.
is to go home, pull off, take several quarts of Dreamless Sleep, and start brainstorming prospects for new best friends. Goodnight.”
"You haven't shagged another one of my siblings, have you?" Ron says, and is horrifically reminded of that time Harry sat him down and told him, with much erring and apologising, that he was fucking his brother. "Is it Percy? For fucks sake. It's starting to get a little incestuous, don't you think mate?"
"Oh? Listen, Harry, I've gotta go say hi to everyone, but wait here, yeah? I reckon we've an hour or so before dinner. Can go for a quick fly and catch up."
Draco says, “It just felt like everything I wanted you had. Quidditch, the House Cup. Attention too, but the right kind.” And then, at the look on Harry’s face: “I was
He allows Draco another kiss, parting his lips and sliding his tongue between the familiar texture of his teeth. He’s easily one of Blaise’s favourite fucks: Draco is soft and pliant where it counts and a brat in the best way. He’d have been happy to fuck him now, here, with Pansy watching (he likes an audience sometimes), but Draco’s clearly distracted and the longer he holds onto whatever happened, the longer this Potter thing will be drawn out. And Blaise is sick to death of Potter.
"Armond," he says and shakes her hand with a strong grip. "Armond Blewitt, down on Potions and Plants. Draco referred a case to me just yesterday, been here most of the night running tests."
Harry grimaces. And the grimace deepens as he thinks about it, analyses Malfoy's face to determine whether he's taking the piss, and starts wondering if it's possible he's not. He doesn't like it, he decides. Actually he hates it, although probably not nearly as much as Ron would.
There’s also the small addition of Draco’s hand on his cock, pressing the seam of his jeans against the leaking head, so he groans and feels the vibration run down Draco’s spine.
Draco’s hand is moving before he realises it — he couldn’t stop it if he wanted to, which is good, because he doesn’t — towards Potter’s cheekbone, and if he’s lucky his wrist holster will gash open that tragic fucking scar on the follow through.
Draco wants to say ‘I unclench every weekend when Blaise fucks me up the arse’, but instead he gives a chagrined little smile and takes the joint out of Potter’s hands.
. He has to purse his lips around it, an instinct that's been inculcated over the years with stern lectures and neat little Stinging hexes.
"I'm not sure what you mean, under my wing," she says curtly. "He's very capable. Surely you know that."
that built a sovereignty of inbreds. The Malfoys’ only sins are that of your run of the mill supremacist bigots, thanks.
Draco frowns some more when Blaise calls him baby. He doesn’t like that (and Blaise knows it), but he does like it when Blaise kisses the bracket of his ribs, so he lets it slide.
The balustrade juts hard into Draco’s naked chest when Potter thrusts like that, shuddering his hips forward. Panting slightly, Draco says, “Never one of my strengths. Do that again.”
“Of course,” says Narcissa. She puts a smile back on. It simply isn’t worth pushing. “Well, in that case. How would you like to help me water the rest of my flowers?”
"That's terrifying," Harry informs him. "I'm a shit Occlumens, but I'm sure Snape told you that. Go ahead."
"Good," Hermione says with a nod. "Good, I think it's healthy they both want to move on from it." Even though something about the entire situation still feels very silly and childish. "I'm glad Draco has someone looking out for him." She gestures to Pansy, mostly to be polite. "I don't think it'll be necessary for you and I to reconvene on this but of course, feel free to let me know if you need anything."
“Come here.” Harry hooks his hands under Draco’s arms so he can arrange him against the desk, and then sits down in front of him.
"That's because Draco keeps us well-stocked," Hermione laughs. "You've never met a tea snob like him."
Charlie really liked shagging Harry. He was young and inexperienced, but he was also a quick learner. The sex was great, and if it wasn't it was fun, and all in all it was a brilliant distraction.
“One simply had to read Hogwarts; A History” (Harry’s not even being dramatic when he says that this inspires traumatising flashbacks) “familiarise themselves with the Charms used on the ceiling of the Great Hall —”
Harry also likes it, however, when Draco gets… hmm. Harry’s friend Lachlan from five-aside-Quidditch, who is really fucking fit and who Harry and Draco have on occasion invited into the boudoir (Harry doesn’t think he’s ever laughed so much as when Ron and Hermione walked in on the three of them. Ron essentially carked it right there in the doorway, and Hermione couldn’t look at him without blushing for weeks. His friends are so fucking square, and he loves them terribly for it), calls it sex-dumb. Draco, when’s he’s emerged from said haze post-fuck, calls it cock-drunk. Harry doesn’t know what to call it, but he thinks it’s utter perfection.
“Good.” Harry releases his cock and tongues the slit, eliciting an easy hiss from Draco. “Start talking, then.”
Harry cards a hand through his hair, just about fed up with trying. It feels impossible. His stomach twists a little when he says, “Do you not think you can just be friends with me? Is that it?”
When Draco lapses into moaning, Harry pulls off him and laves eagerly at the head of his cock. “Tell me another one. A constellation.”
Harry slides his hands up from Draco’s hips to his waist, never breaking eye contact as he lowers himself. He wants to kiss him in the worst way. “Can you handle it?” he enquires, only half teasing.
“Wait,” she says slowly, latching onto that latter bit of fascinating information and turning it over in her mind. “You
Ron really wishes Hermione were here. She's a Healer; she could examine Harry and see if that scar of his has somehow seeped Dark Magic into his brain and cursed him to act the complete dick for the rest of his life.
“Can I ask you something?” he says as he sits back down, nodding towards Malfoy’s arm. “About the Mark.”
Harry looks behind him when he hears Malfoy's familiar drawl and immediately regrets it, because the first thing his eyes are drawn to is the inch or two of skin uncovered at his hip. It's very pale and looks very soft, which isn't fair since Malfoy's a prickly berk and deserves horrible skin. And a mouth that's less inviting, for that matter. Harry clenches his jaw as the soapy water starts filling the sink.
be friends. I said I’m fucking confused and I don’t wanna hurt you while I figure it out. And as for
Truthfully, he doesn't know what the fuck he wants. He knows he's still thinking about Malfoy right now, but he does love Charlie. And some part of him does very much want to try an actual relationship with him, even though he's right and it would likely not last long simply because he wouldn't be happy here in London, and Harry can't leave.
"What the fuck," he says, standing up and trying to ignore the warmth in his cheeks. "Are you kidding me, Hermione, why are you talking to Malfoy about this? And what the hell do you care if it's 'rough and angry'?" The words are heavy with sarcasm. "Aren't you the one always talking about validating sex or what the fuck ever? This has
It's not been that long. Not long enough for me to go begging to Potter, certainly. And for last time, — you, once again,
Harry's good humour deflates like a sad little balloon. A chat, sure. More like a lecture, the subject of which is anyone's guess.
"Close," says Harry, in as casual a voice as he can muster. He applies more pressure to Malfoy's hips to try and stay them, as good as it feels. He then gives into the mad temptation to bury his face in Malfoy's neck, where he noses along the skin beneath his ear and then nips at it gently. "Let you what?"
“Pansy!” Draco calls, pulling his robes over his head as he strides out of the stairwell (obviously) and into the foyer of her offices. He’s learned, from gruelling past experience, never to wear his (sickly, ghastly, makes you look like a fucking expired ice lolly) lime green Healer’s robes in front of Pansy. Or Blaise.
"Many things," Draco says, and leans forward, because Blaise has stopped kissing him. His lips are firmer than Potter's look, but they're still warm and good, and Draco thinks a bit less when they're on his. He's not in the mood for a fuck. A proper snog would be nice, though.
“Knew you’d show up tonight,” he says from the steps. He looks good, as usual; there’s a bandage on his arm, probably from a bad burn. The comfort of his presence is immediate and profound. “George set up a trap for you, by the way. I’d go round the front if I were you and didn’t want my hair strangling me.”
“Me too,” says Harry. He pulls a fresh joint from his robes (Seamus, at his request, had stocked up over the hols) and nods towards the back of the greenhouse. “I’m gonna go out back, wanna join me?”
. He lifts a hand to his cheek and kisses him for real this time. “How long d’you suppose this can possibly last?”
“Not very efficiently. It’d destroyed half the dungeons by the time you witless little picknies got to it.”
been staring at Malfoy. Today. The reminder of the disastrous dinner at Ron and Hermione’s house rankles though.
“Fine, Potter. You know it’s an act of great cruelty, to deny a man his wine? Not very Gryffindor of you.”
Draco isn’t really surprised by Harry’s sympathy. If he were pitiless enough to be apathetic, he’d probably be in Slytherin, and Draco would probably still be sharing an ensuite with the Dark Lord. “Mm,” he says. “Thanks.”
"Draco, please," Harry laughs, cheeks going warm as he steps closer. "I was — you don't have to do that, I was joking. It's not quid-pro-quo. I wanted to do it for you."
“You’re an arrogant twat,” he says, and he crowds into Malfoy’s space, looming over him where he’s pressed against the counter. “Maybe it’s got nothing to do with you. Did you consider that one, Malfoy?”
during the Stifling. That was pretty much all he could get out without gagging. Hermione hadn't pushed it, rather just neglected to mention to either of them that the other would probably be appearing at the pub on Friday night.
However. Hearing Malfoy talk, in that stupid posh voice of his, about taking someone home, is something else altogether.
A surprised laugh, a warmth in his cheeks, and Harry rolls his eyes. Cheekily, he says, “Tell me more about how into me you are.”
It's nearly two when she leaves, tucking him in and extinguishing the lights, and she sets the wards on his flat before stepping into the Floo.
Pansy keeps a deliberately straight face, but she realises suddenly he's just revealed (finally) the heart of the matter: Potter rejected him. In his mind, at least. The lift started moving and Potter jolted back to reality where he didn't fancy getting caught with his cock up Draco Malfoy's arse in a hospital.
“Utterly tedious,” says Draco. Pansy had wanted him to come home with her. The prospect of dinners sat across from her mother, who hated him (ever convinced that Draco was one faulty contraceptive spell from condemning her daughter to teenage motherhood – hello, he's fucking
Harry laughs, but there’s only a small measure of humour in it. He hasn’t spoken to anyone but Ron and Hermione about it, and they know more than enough to believe him. Malfoy doesn’t.
There’s something almost painfully raw about it when Draco starts coming, and the vague ‘wait’ that he chokes out makes it seem almost like he’d been taken by surprise. It’s the hottest fucking thing he’s ever seen and it’s with Draco still pulsing and clenching and twitching around him that Harry closes his eyes and hits his own climax. His hand spasmodically grips and loosens on Draco’s neck the whole time, his hips pumping faster and harder and then slower as he reaches some shivering conclusion. “Fuck,” he croaks. When he takes his hand off Malfoy’s neck, he finds the joints in his fingers are sore. “You okay?”
"I think you're wrong that he's fragile," says Hermione, "but I can agree to disagree about it. However, I do think you're right that it's not very helpful for them to see one another, and that it would be beneficial if we both did our part to make sure they don't cross paths." She sighs and takes a very small sip of the cognac. It burns on the way down, not unpleasantly. "I realise how ... juvenile it sounds, keeping them apart like children. But they're rather juvenile around each other, and I don't like the way their relationship affects either of them. Maybe it's what they need. I absolutely will not agree to stop seeing Draco myself, though."
Never one for these more emotionally-oriented discussions, Harry doesn't quite know what to say. He takes a last hit and offers it to Malfoy. "You wanna fake a last one?"
to be here, only he doesn’t really understand why), and when Malfoy comes closer he can smell him again, that same scent as last time that he’d liked.
Discomfort twists his insides into a hot chord. “Don’t cosset me, Potter. You’re not saying anything,” Draco says.
“You’ll be fine,” Draco says, moving his hips against Harry’s cock in the hopes of getting him to hurry the fuck up. “I’m very robust.”
. He could happily sit here letting his knees bruise against the unforgiving floor of the lift if it meant keeping his face buried in Malfoy's arse. He works him open more quickly than he'd have liked to because — well,
"I'm not getting involved with him," he says. From the fridge he grabs a beer and tosses the cap into the bin a little too roughly. "And I'm not forgiving him for anything that he hasn't apologised for. But I do think he's grown up, all right?" He pauses, then says, "He's got this belly button ring."
, it’s just that this new world is a difficult one to get used to. “You always said she was very intelligent. I’m glad to hear you two are friendly. Is she ...” She clears her throat quietly, and when she speaks her voice sounds a little unsteady, “Is she friends with Potter still?”
Fuck. Oh, god. “Want that,” Harry manages. The tilt of Draco’s arms has dragged the hem of his t-shirt higher — out of the frantic press of bodies on the dance floor, Harry can see the skin he's felt. Red cotton and slouching grey wool skirting taught, slight muscles under pale, sweat slicked skin. God. Merlin.
the next chapter (a whole ass double christmas special!) is going to be up on christmas 🎄❤️ see you then!
Draco turns for the door, knowing Harry will follow. “Your problems are pitifully easy to solve, I hope you know,” he says, over his shoulder.
Draco thinks for a second, wondering how to best contextualise what he knows Harry really wants to ask about. He said he was gay, his father expelled him from the Manor; that's what happened. However, it feels like a strangely dishonest way of retelling things. Sometimes, Draco thinks the flame of hero-worship he carried as a child was never quite extinguished, and if he could prise from Lucius the faintest flicker of remorse, he would believe it.
He tugs on the piercing again, a little harder, until he can feel the pull. He's not exactly sure what he's aiming for at this point since he's certainly
“Such a tosser,” Draco says into Harry’s chest when he finally gets his jumper off. His skin is warm from the charm, and smooth as that where Draco licks below his jaw. “Such a prick.”
According to the Prophet, being a “wanton socialite” is just the next point on a long list of evils he’s committed (attempted headmaster-cide, being Marked, et cetera). Malfoy is “too effeminate”. Malfoy engages in “hideous debauchery”. Malfoy will do “anything/one to bring favour back to the family name”.
Harry grunts "So were my parents," goes back to pulling on his jumper thread and hating his best friend, until Ron clears his throat.
"Yeah, it was more of a rhetorical question, actually," he says after a silent moment. Now he pulls the joint out and he rolls it between his fingers to loosen the bud inside, desperate to change the subject. Holding it up, he asks, "Ever done Muggle drugs?"
"Oh, Draco," Pansy sighs happily. "I've always admired your cheek. Others might call it a self-destructive tendency but you know I love a scandal." She lifts her cup as if to toast him.
“No,” he agrees, because he’s already discussed with Pansy his firm resolve to not fuck Potter, ever again. “But he’s. He’s not
“No,” says Draco. “Normal sounds excellent. I’ll see you on the tower perhaps. Just give me a bell next time you want your cock sucked, will you? I’m off to Scourgify my mouth.”
Unfortunately, he seems to want other things more. He wishes Pansy were here. She'd give him a proper scolding and remind him never to trust his own instincts (because they're completely useless), and then take him home and get him drunk enough to forget he ever did something so stupid.
Draco’s who’s still wearing that obscene triangle of black lace, and who is grinding desperately into Harry’s cock. Pleas of “put it in me, get it in me, want it now.”
“After you,” he says instead, gesturing towards the kitchen. He likes the eye roll Ginny gives him before she stands up.
Naturally, Draco’s bum is as smooth and sculpted as the rest of him. Tight and soft under Harry’s hand as he presses the pads of his fingers into the cool, bare skin, and—
He closes his eyes and tries to block out his surroundings, to find some minuscule vibration of magic in the dense air around him, and if not that then to access his own magical core through sheer will power alone. He does feel something heavy spark to life deep in his gut and for a heart-stopping moment the lift actually vibrates, but as soon as he's opened his eyes and looked wildly around, the spark is out like a flame and he feels powerless again.
