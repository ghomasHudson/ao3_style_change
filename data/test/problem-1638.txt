“He kept me at dinner one Sunday night and made me talk about what was bothering. We finally decided to get out of the house. I wanted to go island hopping, so we set up the appropriate portkeys and things, then went to Jamaica just two days ago. Yesterday, McKay and I were playing in the surf while Theresa was sun bathing and Blaise was playing Frisbee with some other guys. The Frisbee landed on one of the porches on the beach, and it turned out to be Draco’s porch. Blaise and Draco talked, and then Blaise gathered the rest of us there. We came back today to rectify everything and tell Blaise’s mother what was going on.”
Severus, that’s who cared. The poor man had walked in on the two more times than he could count. They didn’t close their bedroom door, and they weren’t always in their bedroom to begin with. No amount of yelling or threatening worked on them; they continued their liaisons wherever they pleased. Only to himself would he admit that their flexibility and stamina was quite impressive, especially with as big as Draco was getting.
Before Snape could defend himself, he noticed Po-
And just as there were deaths among the Dark Lord’s minions, there were deaths from the Order too. Tonks was, thankfully, the only person Harry actually knew on a personal level. Fred lost an ear; at least people could tell the twins apart after that. Several others had been hexed, cursed, or maimed in the attack. It would take time, but most everyone would recover to their full potential.
Harry just groaned. He flopped back on the bed and tried to suffocate himself with a pillow. Mumbling something, he burrowed into the covers to hide from the cruel and embarrassing world.
“Actually,” Hermione cut in, “there were several theories on whether their hatred was purely negative. Most of us girls were wondering. It’s actually a common occurrence to see who we think should pair up with whom.”
“Thank you, Doctor Mitchsens,” Harry dismissed as he stood. His hand was, once again, seized and pumped furiously. “Dr. Rhodes? Would you please join me?” Moments later, Dr. Rhodes stood at the doorway. “Please, sit down. And have a piece of ham.” She smiled and took the seat and ham that was offered. “Firstly, thank you for not taking the ham once again. I can’t explain why it means so much to me, just know that it does. Now, on with my questions. Do you know who I am?”
“What’s a carrier?” Hermione asked Ron, focusing all her attention on her boyfriend.
!” he cried, praying to all the known gods that someone would hear him and help him. He couldn’t hold on much longer. “Somebody help! Please! Anybody?!”
Try as he did with Lucius, Harry sent his magic to herd Voldemort's into Snape's left arm.
“Hey, Harry?” Ginny’s quiet voice popped up. “I haven’t seen you use your wand.”
“If I may?” Snape asked quietly. “I think Minerva’s talk scared Draco considerably. When Potter noticed how upset he was becoming, he silenced Minerva so as to remove the threat to his… boyfriend,” he sneered when he could not think of another proper word as to what Draco was to Harry. “I say we allow him to calm down before we resume our conversation. In a different direction, of course.”
Snape, too, was sporting a blush. “Understandable,” he murmured. “But I really cannot stand the idea of seeing either of you naked again. Please, for the love of Merlin, keep it to your rooms.”
“Hmm,” Draco said non-committally. “Shall we go then?”
And Harry James got caught passing me a note
“Mostly, yes. He’d lost his glasses before the attack, but the nundu sealed the deal, so to speak. Moving on. We returned to Hogwarts, finally, on January 28th, going straight to Severus’ classroom. He is the Potions Master here at Hogwarts. The teachers had, of course, all been searching for us as best they could while letting no one know that we were lost. On February 24th, Harry and I were married in a private ceremony here at Hogwarts after we healed from our ordeal. I have two photographs here, one for each of you, that you may print, along with a copy of our vows. If you’d like, you may also take a picture of Harry’s vows, as they were said in our gesture-based language.”
A quick trip to the dungeons and he had the potion. However, instead of the hasty getaway he expected, he found Draco and Potter, Potter-
“Oh Ron.”
This caused a blush to rise on the matron’s cheeks. “I didn’t mean the mechanics of it, Harry. I meant… When the two of you were last seen, you were heading to a detention in the Forest. You hated each other. You were rivals. You had gotten in trouble for fighting in class which was why you were serving detention in the first place! And then you come back, won’t leave Draco, won’t stop touching him, and he’s pregnant with your child. How did that happen?”
“But the Dark Lord does not let his followers simply leave. Through their Dark Marks, he has linked each to him. He is able to summon them and punish them via these Marks. And thus he began to do with my father and Severus. Upon seeing this, Harry destroyed the link and the Dark Mark on them both.” Draco waved a hand at Severus, who lifted his sleeve to show the unblemished skin of his left forearm. “No longer are they minions, but free men.”

Wow. I don’t know what to write here. Oh! I know! Sadly, Sirius is dead. The events of
“Because he was pregnant and in a right tight spot. Draco had disappeared because he found Harry and I involved in a strictly friendly hug. He got jealous and took off. I couldn’t let my friend go through a pregnancy all alone. It would be his first, and the media would be all over him. He was Harry Potter! The media knew everything about him. So I married him to keep his name clean, and to give his child a name.”

“Stop!” he cried out, trying to breathe and talk and laugh at the same time. “Harry stop, stop stop stop!”
did happen. However, Dumbledore is not dead. The events of
“I was,” was Draco’s simple response. It was quiet for a few moments.
(come on, you knew it was coming!)
Then Harry was thrusting his way in and out of Draco, building their pleasure all the way to the top of that pinnacle before pushing them both over. First Draco, who cried out loudly to make up for the fact that Harry could not. He had become more vocal in the last month or so, just to allow Harry to live vicariously through him. And then, right at the tail end of Draco’s climax, Harry began his own. He threw his head back as if to cry out, but no sound was emitted. Draco held him through the aftershocks, held him close as they rolled to their sides and cuddled. It had taken Draco a while to get used to the concept of cuddling, but Harry had demanded it, insisted it was for more than warmth out there.
“Your mum knows and she let you get married anyways?!”
When Harry seemed satisfied by his findings, he began to rub Draco’s back with one hand while supporting him a bit with the other hand on his stomach. He felt the baby kick against him them, always more active once they had been too. The first time, it had scared Harry. He’d thought he’d hurt the baby. He’d called Madam Pomfrey by force of will and magic. She merely tutted and explained, once again, that sex was perfectly fine, and the baby was sure to react but wouldn’t be harmed. Draco would know if the baby were in distress.
“Actually, I agree with Potter,” Snape said, shocking both of them. “Granger and Weasley have been hounding us for information for the last couple of months. When they burst into Albus’ office when the two of you were there, I thought for sure our cover was blown. Maybe we can allow the two of you to talk to them. Tomorrow. And on one condition.”
“But if he were in that bed,” Draco mumbled sleepily, “how could we get off like we just did?”
“Harry’s not in training. Malfoy’s not in the infirmary. They’re both missing. In the Forbidden Forest.”
“Of course, Severus. But Harry and I haven’t had sex outside our rooms since our last conversation,” Draco insisted.
“What am I supposed to do? I expected him to get upset, not comatose!”
Poppy watched as he caressed Draco’s face, tucking a dirty lock of hair behind Draco’s ear. When she took a step forward, Harry started before relaxing minutely at seeing that it was only her.
“Harry Potter! I can't believe you'd really think we'd forget your birthday!” With a swift look around, Harry laid eyes on a heavily pregnant Hermione Weasley. “We've been your friends for ten years, your best friends.
Blaise sighed. “You might as well. I’ll have to ask Harry if it’s okay to tell you and you’ll want to be sitting down if he says it’s okay. Besides, we have a medi-witch on hand here should you need it. Come on through, and I’ll go talk to Harry about it.” Blaise stepped back and waited for his mother. “Just… sit down and I’ll be right back.” He sighed as he ran a hand through his hair. “Harry?” he called through the door. “Harry I need to talk to you, it’s important. Listen, I know what’s going on is weird, and it hurts, but this is very important. My mother’s downstairs demanding to know what’s going on. She knows something’s not right, and she wants to know what it is now. Please, Harry, either give me permission to tell her or you need to come down and tell her that it’s none of her business. She my mum, I can’t do that.”
Blaise simply wrapped his arms around Harry and whispered, “It’s okay Harry. Just eat the ham and then I will tell you about the doctors so you may pick which one you like best.”
And tonight, Harry made sure Draco was alright before setting up a hurried, fast pace that would have made Draco’s head spin had he not needed it as well. Neither lasted very long, with Draco coming first with a loud shout. Harry followed right behind a few moments later, thrusting then holding still as he came in his husband. Careful manoeuvring had Harry spooned behind Draco without ever pulling out completely for a rest.
At four months pregnant, he was beginning to truly show. That being said, he was more worried about harm to his child. If he were to hold on to Harry much longer, the additional dead weight could cause him to fall to the floor. He couldn’t risk that. But neither would be let go of his husband so that he could break something as he fell. That’s assuming nothing was wrong from what caused Harry to fall unconscious in the first place.
Draco bore down on another contraction, clenching Harry’s hand as he groaned and panted. It was a long one.
“We’d get married so your child wouldn’t be shunned or looked down upon. You have to have this child in this world; there’s no way you could explain to a muggle what was going on. We’d be married in name only. There are plenty of rooms here for you to have your own and still be close to me. No one would suspect a thing. You’re already pregnant so no one will question us. You would take my name, and I would provide for you and your child. Will you accept these terms? Can you do this Harry? I know you love him, but something’s going on in his head right now and if we’re to do this it needs to be done now. We’ll keep it simple and quiet. How’s that sound?”
"So, where's the bathroom?" Harry demanded. Draco snorted one last time before composing himself and leading Harry out of the room.
To say the least  Draco was surprised. "Sure." He replied. "But only if I get to do one thing." He said warningly. Harry nodded enthusiastically.
"Merlin Draco!! Will you shut up?? I'm trying to sleep!" Millicent's voice cut sharply through my rant. I pouted. "I will shut up if you help me. Either one of you, I dont care. Just, pleaseeee". Merlin, I'm a Malfoy. Malfoys dont beg. I scoff at myself. Yes they do. Especially when it comes to Potters.
I drop my head into my hands. “I can’t believe 2 things Malfoy.” I mutter as Malfoy moves slightly closer.
"Language Draco!" Draco looked suitably chastised as his mother scolded him in front of his soulmate. He blushed before muttering a short apology.
Harry and Draco just sighed and leant forward, kissing in front of the whole school, entwining on top of the table. When their lips touched, Hogwarts was almost screamed down by the students and teachers. The two lovebirds just grinned and laughed staring at each other. That was the photo that was on The Prophet the next day.
Draco Malfoy, Slytherin Prince was holding Harry Potter, the Golden Boy over his shoulder as he ran past the Great Hall with Harry complaining.
You literally are.
Harry and Draco.
I frowned. "What do you mean?"
"Oh shut up you bore. Did you look at their faces? They looked so happy! When was the last time you saw Draco or Harry smile like that?! Be happy for them Blaisey-waisey!" Pansy scolded.
"I hope they don't come back in here in like 3 minutes time engaged because of their love for Terry Pratchett." Neville grumbled as he sat in a chair.
Draco growled, "Potter."
Narcissa stood up suddenly. "Where does he live?" she demanded. Tom turned over the envelope to find the sender address. "No. 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey" he responded. "I'm getting him now, before those filthy muggles touch him." An argument broke out between the adults who were trying to calm Narcissa down and make sure she doesn't kill anybody.
! Since I last saw or heard from you and you think you can just
Harry was confused. What did 'Mione have to show him? It was dinner now, he had 30 mins to eat before he decided to go.
"Go on then Harry." Draco whispered in his ear, and nudged him slightly. Harry smiled at him shyly before picking a bit of everything. Draco did the same, both teens not realising how hungry they really were.
"What. The. Hell. Is.
Tears streamed down his face. "Surely, I deserve to love and be loved in return? Forever?" Harry's voice cracked as he sobbed into Draco's shoulder.
"That's not the worst of it. I-, there's a prophecy about me. I hold the power the Dark Lord know not and that is what can defeat him. But, there is a catch. One cannot live whilst the other survives so that means one of us has to die. But what's even worse than that, is that I'm a horcrux." He whispered the last sentence.
The next morning, Harry was sitting at the Gryffindor table blushing hard as he looked at Draco, who was doing the same, as they remembered what happened last night. There was about 5 minutes until they had to leave for their first class and almost everyone was in the room. Except for Severus Snape.
Harry's lips formed a silent 'oh' before wriggling out of Narcissa grasp and hesitantly moved towards Draco. Silently, Draco opened his arms wide and Harry launched himself into his arms still crying slightly. Draco kissed the top of his head again but didn't blush. He had made Harry- HIS HARRY - upset!! How could he do such a thing?!
"How is your wife Malfoy?"
"Anyways, as I was saying. Why are you shagging
: HE STOLE MY HEART
Draco growled and pulled Harry closer to himself. The older man smiled fakely at him before running his eyes down Harry appreciatively once more.
I shake my head. He likes the Weaselette. Bet he is not even gay.
Draco pushed a little more into the kiss and his hand moved to cup Harry's head, holding him in place as he shyly ran his tongue across Harry's bottom lip.
I just thought I would say, that I am actually winging this book. I have no idea what happens, I am legit making it up as I go along.  There are some things that are fixed, like Dumbledore's creature and the fact the 'Dark side' rescue Harry and that this is a Drarry book but one thing I just randomly decided was to make Drarry soulmates. What can I say? I'm a sucker for soulmate Drarry.
"That wasn't a proper kiss Potter. Kiss me properly." I pout at him, knowing he can't resist me when I'm like this. This has worked for 19 years. It damn well won't stop working now.
Harry wakes up slowly. Groggily, he tries to work out his surroundings, that is when he realises there is an arm over his hip, and his legs are tangled with someone else’s. He freezes. As Harry slowly twists, he realises that his body does not hurt that much anymore and is happy. However that happiness only increases when he realises who is cuddling him like a teddy bear.

Harry sighs. Enough thinking, time to try and sleep. He checks his watch. Oh shit, 05:59. He has been awake all night thinking about his sad life. Time go get breakfast done. He creaks his door open silently and creeps towards the kitchen. Once he gets there, he grabs the bacon, 4 eggs, bread, butter and the orange juice. He lays the table whilst the bacon fries in the pan. He places glasses in the relevant seats at the table and adds the carton of orange juice. He puts the fried bacon on plates and starts cracking the eggs. As soon as he cracked the last one, he hears heavy thuds from upstairs indicating that the Whales are awake. They stomp downstairs and situate themselves at the table. Harry quickly finishes breakfast up to avoid a confrontation with his Uncle and hands them their plates. He never gets thank you’s or good mornings. Freaks aren’t allowed to be greeted.
With all my planning I forgot to eat so when it was time to go to Hogsmeade, I hadn't eaten anything. I swiped a juicy, green apple off the table and bit down into it as I walked out of the Great Hall with Pansy and Blaise.
Harry looked to the ground before replying. "I thought your family were against same sex relationships?" Next to Harry Draco sucked in a breath sharply, whether it was in anger at his comment or because of the word 'relationship' Harry didn't know.
is just off the grid due to
Pansy at least had the decency to look chagrined. As she smiled sheepishly at me I looked her over. It had been a few weeks since I last saw her. She had to go with her parents for a trip to Spain. Apparently, someone was interested in marrying her and wanted to see if they were compatible. Although they were not, she still stayed the whole 3 weeks and had a gained a glorious tan that I was certainly not drooling over. Her nails were painted the usual blood red (a fresh coat though) and she was wearing her favourite skirt.
Laters! ~Jaz
“Ah-hah yes I do.” I rub hand on back of head nervously. “Have since I first saw you in Madame Malkins.”
. "I seriously disagree with that statement Malfoy."
"Can we go to the sitting room to eat and chat there? Please?" Draco asked politely, begging his parents. He just wanted to have an excuse to cuddle Harry and where would be a better place than the love seat next to the fire? Narcissa sighed and nodded. "Of course, just don't spill anything okay?" she asked sternly. The teens grinned at her before running off with their sugary treats to claim their seats.
"I love her, yet it doesn't hurt as much as it should. Should it hurt Draco? To break up with her? I still love her. And I don't know what to feel or even to do." Draco felt sorry for his new friend.
He got a meek yes in reply.
Harry laughs making Draco grin at him before cuddling him even closer (if that was even possible). Their faces were really close, noses brushing and both had smiles on their faces. They were just happy with to be in each other’s arms surrounded by love, calm and peace. Harry closes his eyes and burrows his face into Draco’s neck making Draco squirm as his neck was really sensitive. He kisses the top of Harry’s hair and they slowly falls asleep content.
Strange, I thought. No name.
He peered back under the table. "I'm finished so I am leaving now okay? Bye."
‘Harry’ he whispers softly. ‘Harry please look at me. I’m not gonna hurt you. Harry please.’ he feels like breaking down and crying but he has to be strong. He has to be strong for Harry. Harry slowly looks up and Draco’s stormy silver eyes meet Harry’s emerald eyes. He gives a small smile to Harry. ‘Can you come over here please love?’ He didn’t realise he had said the term of endearment until Harry stated to crawl over slightly. He gives an encouraging smile and holds his arms out slowly. ‘That’s a good boy, Harry. Aren’t you a good boy?’ He keeps talking to Harry softly as harry makes his way over to Draco.
I am so cheesy I'm sorry.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Remus grinned and Sirius stood mouth agape. "Wow!" The dark haired man breathed. "That's amazing! It's so rare! Tell me the rest of the details later. I'm sure you're quite busy today."
Harry sighed, "I have been... surprised this week. I found some information about me." He looked at the old man who had a slight look of alarm in his eyes. "I discovered that... I have some powerful ancestors in my line. Did you know that? One had a demon inheritance. I read about it in one of the books in my vault. Very interesting it was." Dumbledore's look of alarm had faded slightly however he was still wary. "It was a very informative trip to Gringotts. I went over my vaults with Grapclaw and-"
He dropped Draco onto the sofa closest to the fire and called for a house elf, ordering blankets and two hot chocolates. Harry then cast a silencing bubble around them effectively blocking out everyone's questions and sat on the sofa next to Draco.
Draco Malfoy.
Harry shuffled into Draco's side more, wiggling to get comfortable. "From 3 I was doing chores. I was always fed the scraps. I didnt have a decent meal unless they were forced to take me out with them into public. It would look suspicious if I didnt I anything to eat whilst they did. Hogwarts saved me from almost dying of starvation, however, I never managed to get seconds or anything particularly filling. It was Dumbledores way of controlling me. By controlling what I ate, he controlled my body and so my mind. I have always been aware of my weight. I hated it. I always felt like I was too fat, that would be the Dursley's speaking."
The next time Harry did it, he was surrounded by Gryffindors and Malfoy nodded back before continuing his path down to class with a smug look on his face. This time, it was the Gryffindors turn to gape at Harry. (The silence was so thick; you could slice through it with a cutting curse.) Then, he was bombarded by questions by his fellow house mates.
Next day I chased him ‘round the dungeons
“Excuse me, Harry, Draco,” Luna interrupted. “What was that just now? Was there a blibbering humdinger about?”
“It is my wish.” He received a ring from Pomfrey and pressed it into Harry’s hand.
Harry smiled and helped Draco to his feet, keeping him balanced with his left arm around Draco’s waist and his right holding Draco’s right hand. They said their goodbyes and made their way back to their dungeon rooms. With the addition of the nursery, they almost had more space than Snape did. Dumbledore had said he’d take care of their presents, so neither worried about those. After settling a naked Draco into bed, Harry curled up behind him in nothing but his pants to look at the baby names book.
“This is exactly why we didn’t tell you anything,” Moody growled. “We can’t draw any unwanted attention. It was my decision to tell everyone about the training and the attack. They’re logical excuses. You two are the only ones we had to worry about asking questions, but you didn’t. Not until now.”
“I slipped and called her mum,” Blaise explained. “I never do that. She demanded answers.”
“Then you will hire Dr. Rhodes?”
“Thank you Dr. Rhodes. I think that just about does it. The paternity test is sky blue, signifying that the hair I took from McKay Zabini proves that he is a male child and has read his DNA from the hair strands. I am pouring the concoction into two separate vials so that I may add a few strands of Draco Malfoy’s hair to the one on my left, and Blaise Zabini’s to the one on my right. One will turn red, and one will stay sky blue. The sky blue on will show who the biological father is. The one that turns red shows that that’s person is not the biological father. Draco, if you please?”
“Thank-you Harry. Let the record state that Harry Zabini was formally Harry Potter. Sorry Harry, it has to be said. Do you think you could get McKay to say something just to show on the record that the child is here?”
More wild gesturing.
“All of it. Explain right now Blaise Zabini.”
“Help? Help?! What can you possibly do, Potter?!”
Harry nodded, still glaring at Snape.
“Told us what?” Ron asked, stepping forward.
Severus caved and allowed her to take the memory to view in her own pensieve once he’d abstracted it. She was gone in a flurry of robes without any word of thanks or leave-taking. She rushed back down to the infirmary, did a check on Harry and Draco, found that nothing had changed, and then went to her office to view the memory. With some excitement and a little trepidation, she thrust her head into the silvery substance.
He couldn’t explain about the DA and their charmed coins. Instead, he mimed the signs for Hermione – bushy hair and opening a book. Draco rolled his eyes; of course Granger knew a spell for their situation. Didn’t she always? He watched as Harry conjured four bracelets, simple in design and silver in color. He held each individually and concentrated on the spell he wanted cast on them. When finished, he put one on himself. Then he stood and went out to the living room to get Snape’s attention.
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..

insulted one of the hippogriffs, which caused a stampede. Harry and I were given detention with Hagrid to find the hippogriffs that had run off into the Forbidden Forest.”
“Yes, my infirmary!” Poppy yelled back. “These two young men have been through hell and back and I cannot treat them unless you leave because you have scared Mr. Potter so badly he will not let anyone near him, and Mr. Malfoy is unconscious! If I am to save their lives I will need absolute silence and no interruptions from anyone. Including you! Now get out Headmaster!” she said, brandishing her wand at him.
No way! (No way!) No it’s not a secret
“Oh, sweet Merlin. Please tell me that didn't happen. Please, Draco! Tell me I did not tell all our family and friends about our sex life. Tell me that you did not clarify the details of our sex life.”
“You know that feeling you’re having? Act on it. Do something that makes it go away. That’s pushing.”
Here, Snape spoke up. “He comes with me, his godfather, and is accompanied by all of my blessings.”
“You ask me that everyday, you know. And yes, after five years, he's still treating me right. How's 'Mione?”
“Leave them alone, dear,” Mr. Zabini chided gently, placing a hand on his wife’s shoulder.
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
Harry was quick to reply, doing as asked and shimmying up his husband’s body. After a long, languid kiss, Draco pulled back and panted for breath. “Is there a reason you decided to wake me with that particular method?” He watched as the light in Harry’s eyes dimmed for a moment. “Oh stop. Do you really think I’d forget our anniversary?”
“He’s never kicked like that before.”
“Anybody,” came a whispered interruption.
“Anywhere, Harry. You name it, and I’ll find a way to get us there. All four of us, if Theresa wants to come.”
Harry stared at his husband with an open mouth and wide eyes. It was his birthday. It was not slave-over-a-hot-stove day. Without a word, Harry stood and walked to their bedroom. He lay down on his side of their bed, facing away from the door. Footsteps could be heard on the stairs a few moments later. He ignored Draco as he tried to talk to him and sweet talk him into responding.
“Wh-who is it, Harry? Do you know?” Draco sniffled, wiping his nose on the back of his hand.
“He did. But I haven’t been sick in days, so I stopped taking it.”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
“That sounds just fine to me,” Draco said. “About what time do you get out of class?”
to see if there was anything he could do. Once Harry was sitting up again and drinking small sips of water, Blaise said, “I guess a tour of the house is off for now then.” Harry managed a weak smile before getting help with getting off the floor and walking to his new bedroom. “I’ll be right next door, okay? If you need anything I’ll be right here. Call for me or for- Oh! I forgot to introduce Kipper. Kipper!” A small crack and a shy house elf appeared. “Kipper, this is Harry Potter Zabini, my husband. He’s pregnant and I want you to care for him, okay? We’ll be getting a mediwitch or -wizard soon to help with the more specific things, but until then anything he needs you get for him, okay?”
inept every year! It’s not like it was all the complica- What, Potter?”
So yeah, that’s it.
“Harry James Potter.”
So that’s what he did.
I wish that I had Ginny’s guy
“Oh, you're not just hung over, Harry. You're about to be more embarrassed than you've ever been before.” He handed the aforementioned potion to his husband and waited for the hangover to clear his mind. He knew the exact second it happened too. “Ah, and the memories return.”
As he got ready to go home, he was very depressed. No one had mentioned his birthday. No one person had just stopped, shook his hand, and wished him a good day. Nothing. Nada. Zip. Zilch. Bupkiss. It's not like his birthday was a secret! He was Harry bloody Potter! Everyone knew his birthday! With a sigh, he straightened his Auror robes and headed toward the exit.
“Would either of you care to inform me just what is going on?” Snape drawled, crossing his arms over his chest.
“Marriage is a bond to be entered into only after considerable thought and reflection. As with any aspect of life, it has its cycles, its ups and its downs, its trials and its triumphs. With full understanding of this, Draco and Harry have come here today to be joined as one in marriage. Others would ask, at this time, who gives Draco in marriage, but, as a human being is not property to be bought and sold, given and taken, I ask simply if he comes of his own will and if he has his family's blessing.
. You reacted before we could explain, and then ran off like a two-year old. Now you’ve missed some of the most important moments of your son’s life.”
Harry didn’t move for a moment. Instead, he and Poppy stared into each other’s eyes. Poppy wanted to shudder and look away, his gaze was so intense. But she knew better. To break contact now would be admitting she was untrustworthy. She couldn’t afford that. Even if he couldn’t actually see her. Right now there were two incredibly injured young men before her, one was pregnant and the other was possibly mute and blind for the rest of his life. Finally, Harry began to rise from the floor where he’d been huddling. He seemed to carry Draco with no problems at all, as if he weighed no more than a feather, as he carried him to the bed and gently lay him down once more, as if he could see perfectly.
For several days, Harry kept Draco cooped up in Snape’s rooms. Of course, that wasn’t much different from how it had been before the wedding. Now, however, they would laugh at Snape’s attempts to remember to call Harry “Mr. Potter-Malfoy”. Usually the Potions Master would just get flustered and storm away; Draco had talked with him about using his husband’s given name rather than their combined surname. Snape was most displeased.
“Draco?” he called out as he entered their small house. Well, small to Draco, pretty large to him. “Draco, I'm home!” There was no answer. “That's odd...” He took out his wand and searched for Draco magically, only to find that his lover wasn't home. Harry stood still for a moment, trying to remember if he was supposed to meet Draco somewhere or if he'd mentioned going out today. Draco was always there when Harry went home so it was weird and unusual for the house to be as quiet as it was.
He’d also started having cravings, but they changed so fast. He wasn’t sure what to take to his godson to get him in a good mood. One time, he’d brought pickles and mayonnaise only to send the blonde into a fit of vomiting at the smell. Draco had apologized profusely, but he’d learned his lesson – no foodstuffs unless he was specifically asked.
Harry hit him on the arm.
Harry closed his eyes and let Malfoy clamp his mouth down on his, if only so he’d stop talking so much filth that Harry was worried was entirely true. Harry’s plan backfired, Malfoy’s kisses were as filthy as his words. Harry pushed down Draco’s trousers and pumped his cock, his chest tightening at the idea that he could ever have all that inside him. And that he wanted it. He wanted every fucking inch. He moaned into Draco’s kisses and Draco pulled back, chuckling in his ear.
“Fantasising about! Fine. Erections. Hermione.”
Malfoy just gave him a small smile. Harry sighed and started to wipe the dust off his face, trying not to get it in his eyes. Trying not to study Draco’s face, it had been so long since he’d looked at him properly...he silently inspected for any scars, any change...there was none. Just Draco’s angular and sharp features with his piercing silvery eyes...god he wanted to kiss him.
He’d had this before. Then it had been Voldemort’s voice. The hairs on the back of his neck stood on end.
“Containing?”
“I’m sorry?” Harry tried not to panic.
“Oh, that’s the wonderful thing about getting fucked in the dark, Potter. It could be anyone,” Draco whispered in his ear.
Eventually they touched down outside the Malfoy Manor. It was turning out to be a gloomy day, and although the rain had managed to hold off whilst they’d been flying, Harry could feel it starting to drizzle. Malfoy let Harry slide to the floor and stood up, pointing his wand at him.
Harry came in rough jerks, gasping his breath and crying out, every thrust from that thing drew it out, sent him higher, till eventually he collapsed onto Draco, a limp mess of limbs in Draco’s arms.
The prosecutor had finally finished reading out Draco’s alleged crimes when Harry came back to reality.
“God, Malfoy.” Harry muttered. He grabbed Draco’s arse and pulled Draco him down hard against his waist.
Harry sighed and took Malfoy’s plate from him and started cutting up his food.
“I came to warn you, about an attack here, by the Death Eaters.”
He looked up at Snape taking intently and refused to submit to her repeated attempts to catch his eye. He was incredibly glad for Snape’s insistence of silence in his classes. When the bell finally rang Harry faked a stomach upset and ran up to the dormitory, wondering if Hermione would ever look at him the same again.
They nodded.
“Yeah do it, come inside me Potter, fill me.”
Draco let out another soundless scream and shook as he came hard, it rocked through him as he seemed to come in endless waves, lasting far longer than he could ever remember, leaving him a shaking limp mess in Potter’s grip.
The activity ceased at once when Draco stepped in.
Hermione took a deep breath.
“We all have to make our own choices based on what we believe is right...”
Harry rolled his eyes.
“Although last time, I recall that you really quite liked it.”
“Good,” Draco said.
Draco chuckled.
“Yes boss,” Draco drawled.
A low growled meow perked his interests and he followed Draco in, leaving the door open and keeping half an eye on the paralysed Death Eaters.
“Draco says…” Harry started but stopped again.
He heard Potter lean down and rummage in the box of toys, lube and condoms that sat in the corner of every cage.
“Then what are we going to do with him?” Ron asked.
“Patience darling.” Draco pulled Harry’s arms above his head and touched Harry’s wand. His hands stuck. Harry rolled his eyes.
He didn’t know why he was being so honest. Though he supposed there was little point in lying about it. He was pretty sure Draco knew all this already.
“Oh yeah. Should have told you Potter. I’ve got an appetite.”
“Did I give you jelly legs?”
He thought this was the first serious conversation they’d had. Back at Hogwarts it had been straight up fucking and nothing more and Harry was starting to think he’d preferred it. Even if it had been torture, quite literally, at some points.
“Say please?”
Draco flicked his wand at the door to the turret, it locked, and Harry felt wards spring up around them.
There was the ten minutes inevitable snoozing and swearing followed by the thud of feet on the floor boards as the Gryffindor boys finally surfaced.
“Fuck,” Draco muttered, bucking in Harry’s hands.
“Told you it wasn’t a Tiger.”
“Potter.”
“I never agreed to be your god damn boyfriend, Potter. I never agreed to any of this. I’m not a fucking Gryffindor. I don’t do the whole self-righteous hero crap. I am who I am.”
“Now show them.”
Harry nearly fell off the sofa at the sound of Draco’s drawl. He jumped up and tried to fix his hair, before realising Draco was already in the kitchen and watching his flustered attempts with amusement.
Tonks shook her head.
“Yeah, you like fucking yourself on my cock, Potter?”
Harry rolled his eyes and turned off the shower. He wrapped himself in one of Draco’s fluffy towels and walked back to the bed. He spelled his hair dry and got into bed, lying on his back and staring at the ceiling.
Harry tried with all his might to break out of the paralysis spell. He had to do something. He couldn’t just stand here. His wand hung like a limp extension of his arm. It wouldn’t be moved. Dumbledore shook his head at him through the grate. He could see Draco’s face above him, twisted with anguish.
She reached in her robes and pulled out their wands, handing Harry’s to him pointedly.
Draco ran his teeth down his neck as he pushed down Harry’s trousers. Harry’s breath came in short bursts.
Harry swore under his breath as he heard Malfoy’s voice, that really was the last thing he want to hear right now. As he stepped closer saw that despite the person being dressed essentially in rags and covered in dust it was definitely Malfoy. He could just about see a few strands of platinum hair glinting at him through the dust.
Harry flipped over, exhausted and panting.
Draco smirked.
“Oh, yeah.”
“Malfoy is a horrible person.”
Harry didn’t bother to respond and set off down the road following the directions of the phone.
“What do you mean?”
“One of the prefect’s I’m fucking took me there.” Harry drawled.
“I...” he gritted his teeth and put on his best sick voice. “I feel awful, I think I’m getting a migraine.”
“Promise me you’ll be careful? I don’t know what Malfoy’s up to lately, but he does seem... Darker. Somehow.”
“Well what is it like then?”
“Looks good on you.”
He pushed the professional expression back onto his face and nodded.
“Draco, Drac…“ he gasped as he felt himself falling. He screamed loud as he came.
“You self-centred wanker. God, it's got to you, hasn’t it? Them telling you you’re the chosen one. The only one that can stop Voldemort? Do you really think you’re so important that it’s you he’d be worried about when taking on this castle full of experienced wizards? Potter, just how up your own arse have you become?”
“I hope you two know what you’re doing.”
“You’re shaking again.” Draco ran his other hand down his side. “Relax.”
“You’re ready when I say you’re ready.”
Harry was getting increasingly anxious about Draco. He was losing weight, not that he had any to lose, and was letting his high standards of appearance slip. Not that Harry gave a fuck about Draco’s hair not being quite as glossy as before, but it was worrying. He was quiet, too. Nowhere near as feisty, practically silent in class and eyes down in the hall way.
“I’m so sorry to disturb you at this hour, Minister.”
“Ah fuck, Potter, now now now touch me.”
Draco turned on the coffee maker and smiled as it happily buzzed and distributed coffee into the two mugs.
“Would you like that?”
“Just how long have they been undone for, Malfoy?” Harry sighed, not surprised in the least.
“Guess that’s dinner then.” Harry nodded to the petrol station.
Harry did as he was told, as by now he was past arguing. It had once again gone too far and he knew there was no going back.
Harry blinked in bemusement but did as he was told as Draco mixed various bottles at the table in the corner.
Harry sucked in a breath.
Draco snorted.
“Yes, Draco.”
“Well, I guess that’s something.”
Malfoy took a small step back, staring at him intently, jerking him off fast, waiting patiently for him to come undone.
Draco spelled him across a clean pair of socks and slid them over his feet. Harry shuddered at the soft cotton.
“Hermione!”
He gritted his teeth, shuddering in Potters grip.
Draco took a deep breath and nodded.
“Stroke your cock with your other hand, slowly...”
“Going to make me sleep on the floor?”
There was a knock on the door.
“A good dancer is a very appealing quality in the opposite sex you know, you boys should pay attention.”
They were cut off by an explosion at the door. Harry jumped to his feet, wand out. Dumbledore remained seated.
Bellatrix twisted herself round Draco, venomous and grinning, ready to pounce.
“For me definitely, you could probably get out of it.”
“I like to eat nice food, and since I’m no longer in a position to cook for myself, well. What about you, do you like to cook?”
Harry stared at him.
She pursed her lips.
“It’s okay,” Draco said. “I’ve done it before. I’ve educated him fully on safe sex.” Draco lazily did up his shirt.
“I’d expect you of all people to know that just because you’re raised by horrible people, doesn’t make you a horrible person.”
“Let’s run away together,” Harry said.
Draco. Fucking. Malfoy. He groaned. Had the last of his drink and leant on the wall, looking down out over the forest and the stars twinkling in the sky.
Malfoy grabbed the back of his head, pulling him into a kiss. Harry jerked his head down, he hated it when he kissed him, the array of emotions and hormones it sent coursing through him made him feel like a traitor.
Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco moaned in his ear and rested his head on Harry’s shoulder, making sure Harry caught every sigh and gasp coming out of his mouth.
“Wait, stop,” Ron decided to catch up with the conversation. “You let Malfoy sleep in your bed?”
“Ugh.”
“Never even gone to a club? Fucked in the dark?”
Draco placed his whole body over Harry’s, pushing him down into the floor.
Harry rolled his eyes.
“Please, Draco, fuck, I need...”
“Want some more?”
“Good.”
Harry glanced up at the train time display, sighing when he saw the train was due any minute and he definitely didn’t have time to go and get himself a coffee.
“Fuck! Potter touch me.”
People were staring. Of course they fucking were. It wasn’t every day that you saw Saint Potter flouncing round a gay bdsm club. Everyone was sworn to secrecy, you made the unbreakable vow to even get into the place, swearing not to talk about anyone or anything you’d seen inside. So people wouldn’t talk about it. They couldn’t. But people would
“Or do you really detest me that much that the only way you can imagine feeling anything but loathing for me is a love potion?”
Malfoy didn’t comment, just sat quietly, letting Harry feed him. As Harry looked back to him he thought he saw a slight sparkle in his eyes that said he was just as desperate as Harry was. He wondered vaguely what kind of excuse he could make. This was certainly new thinking for him. Before, at school, the only thing he would think afterwards was “never again” and whenever the next time was, Malfoy had initiated it. Now he was planning it himself, admitting to himself he wanted it to happen. It made him feel ill.
“Oh, it’s just bleeding. Is everyone else okay? Everyone back?”
He walked quietly up the stairs, unlocked the door with a whispered spell and let it swing open towards him. The guard sat with his back to him. Harry stunned him, yanked him back into the cellar and closed the door quietly again. They paralysed and stripped him. His glared at them from the floor as Draco slipped on the robes.
“Fucking hell,” Harry said eventually, steadying himself on the couch and experimentally standing up. Draco turned in his arms to face him, a wicked grin on his face. Harry allowed himself a small smile back at him even though his cheeks were burning bright red.
Mrs Weasley laughed.
“Yes! Potter now, touch me, please!”
Draco chuckled.
“Thanks. Feel free to come and use it anytime you like.”
“Take your fingers out.”
Harry grabbed Draco and apparated away. They landed with everyone else in a heap on the floor of headquarters.
Draco cried out above him, still pounding away at his arse, drawing out every scream, every shudder, till they were both spent and the Slytherin collapsed on top of him.
Harry nodded.
“Okay.”
He pulled off his robes, his top, his hands flying over the Slytherin as they kissed. Draco ripped open his shirt and ran his hands over his chest. He grabbed Draco’s arse and pulled him tight towards him as Draco pumped their cocks together.
They both looked bored enough that Harry could rest assured they’d been fooled. He had no idea what to do about this. He’d never had this problem before. With Cho he quite liked her. He’d really wanted to kiss her and hold her hand, but it hadn’t felt like this. Blind obsession. It wasn’t normal. Ron didn’t stare at Hermione like this. Sure, Ron and Lavender had been attached at the lips for a few weeks, but that was different. At least two people had been equally participating in that obsession. This was creepy and weird.
He brought out something that looked like a butt plug out of his pocket.
“He’s not interested in help,” Harry sighed.
“It’s fine now.”
He trailed off and ran his thumbs down his neck, across his collar bone, down his chest, staring at him hard. Harry kept perfectly still, it had been a long time, but he couldn’t ever remember Draco being this intense with him before.
Harry turned to him and glared.
He thought now and again he was allowed the occasional deaf episode.
“You stand accused of being a member of the Death Eaters, a follower of Lord Voldemort, of the attempted murder of Albus Dumbledore, of torture, conspiracy to over throw the government…”
They looked at each other for a few more seconds then heard another scream. Harry looked down at the unresponsive phone.
“That’s what locking spells are for, Potter.”
Malfoy was devouring his mouth, kissing him as if the world was ending, fully taking advantage of the one thing Harry usually managed to say no to.
Harry put his hand out towards Draco’s sleeping bag. Draco caught his wrist.
“Bye, Potter.”
“I’ve broken a lot of glasses.”
“Terrible posture? Tsk Potter, your knots have knots. Its a good job you came to have it sorted out.”
“Yes.”
Draco just smiled at him and pulled him tightly up against his body. He yanked Harry’s head roughly to the side to start kissing and biting on his neck. Harry cringed at the mewl that escaped his lips.
“No! This is a love potion Hermione, there is nothing to fancy about Malfoy. I hate him! It just happened over night, like I’d been spiked.”
“No. Keep still.”
“You are both twenty-five years old. Twenty-five. Yet I receive constant complaints of your squabbling and disruption of every project you’re put on together. And now, look at you both!”
“Oh...” Harry brought out his wand and broke them. Draco took his hand and let Harry help him to his feet.
“Fuck!” Harry grabbed Draco’s arms and pushed himself up harder on Draco’s cock, again and again, driving himself higher than he’d ever been before. He cried out one last time then flopped back onto the bed.
“Spread your legs.”
“Thanks, Ron.”
Harry wrapped his hand round Draco’s cock and pumped him hard.
“Oh yes. It’s a charm. That’s not all. How’s this?”
Draco stood over him with his hands on his hips.
“Going all Parseltongue on me Potter? Godric Gryffindor would be ashamed. And not just of your awful dancing. Step, Potter, step, step, turn, now step, step, other way... God what did they teach you at muggle primary school?”
Harry gave up trying to understand and leant back against Draco, letting him snake his arms round his waist and holding him tight. His heart beating far faster now that it was mid orgasm.
Chapter Two
Draco chuckled behind him as he slowly began to move, hard heat moving inside him.
The looked at each other in panic. Harry rolled off Draco and searched frantically through his sleeping bag for his phone. He found it and called Morgan but to his dismay it just rang and rang. He cursed.
“Where are we?”
Harry stared, gripping the sides of the couch to keep control and not throw Draco to the other side of the room and fuck him senseless. Draco bounced, slowly stretching himself over Harry’s cock.
Harry took in a shaking breath.
“Not beyond repair!” Hermione was sulking in the corner. Both of them had refused to leave to go and eat their dinner.
Harry side and put his hand up to his head.
“How about now?”
“You hate it when I fuck you too...”
“Ostracised,” Harry said.
“I’m not sure that there is.” Harry had tried multiple times to understand the game that he watched from his seat on the Dursleys’ living room floor, a book balanced in between his knees, trying not to move an inch or make a sound.
Harry laughed nervously.
He despaired of himself. This was exactly what Draco was setting this up to look like; that he was secretly a spy for the order, that he was changed, that he was lovely, and let Harry fall flat on his face for him before...
Harry turned to face her.
“Do you want me to suck it?”
Harry groaned, not finding the quick fix he wanted.
Draco stepped back off him and Harry heaved in a breath, trying to get his bearings. Draco took his shirt off and threw it onto the floor. Harry stared. His bearings were well and truly lost. Draco’s skin was so pale it was almost translucent, his waist slight, with a thin dusting of platinum curls on his chest, in between his legs. The dark mark glared up at Harry from Draco’s right forearm, and Draco didn’t seem to care if Harry saw it.
“Potter.” Draco laughed. “I’ve fucked half of Slytherin house and half the wizard population of London.”
“He does, he’s just a worrier.” Draco tipped his head forward to let her see. “That’s just fine. Any other wounds? Bruising?”
Harry’s eyes would not stop finding Malfoy in the corridor between classes, in the great hall at meal times. He already knew Malfoy’s timetable from before, when he was trying to work out what he was up to. He found himself taking shortcuts, that were actually detours, that would lead to him walking past Malfoy on his way out of class.
Draco laughed.
“I thought it was meant to be relaxing.”
He looked up. Draco was the most relaxed Harry had ever seen him. All his airs and graces were gone, his arms hung loose at his side and his head tipped back. Harry pushed his lips down further experimentally till Draco’s cock brushed the back of his mouth. Harry’s cock became painfully hard. Draco let him go at his own pace for a few minutes before grabbed his hair and pulled his head up.
It was pitch black inside and silent, from what Harry could hear. They stood for a second, listening, before Harry cast a small ball of light that sat in the palm of his hand. Draco followed him in. They were standing in a large hallway, steps rose in front of them to the second floor.
“Arsehole.”
“Good!”
“Maybe it’s because of my dancing skills?” He slid his hands round Harry’s waist. “Or do you just like bad boys?”
He waited until Hermione had come to stand next to him and tapped his broomstick on the floor three times, still feeling a slight sense of wonder as the houses in front of him moved aside to let 12 Grimauld Place appear in front of them.
Harry turned so that Draco could see his clothes.
“Mmm it looks good too.” He moved them fast, till Harry’s cock was leaking onto the sheets, his hips bucking wildly against Draco’s fingers.
“He doesn’t. And that’s what’s killing him. He thought he saw good in you, and he did, but...”
Malfoy did, giving Harry the exact same patronising smile from last night.
“Clown?” Draco teased.
Harry whirled around, suddenly furious. Malfoy was sat with his legs crossed, regarding him cooly, eyebrows raised, waiting for Harry’s outburst. He didn’t understand how anyone could manage to look as threatening in a dressing gown as Malfoy did right then. Harry raised his wand at him. He had no idea what he was going to do, he just knew that he wanted to make him feel the same pain he did every time he thought about him.
Draco rolled his eyes at her trite insult and turned back to the window.
Harry watched in horror as Draco dropped to his knees in front of him and pulled out his cock. Harry squirmed and gasped at the cool air on his sensitive skin. Harry barely had time to register what Draco was about to do before he slid his lips down his cock.
“The whole rooms got a protection spell on it. He can’t hurt himself.”
Tonks glared at him for his nonchalance.
“I don’t know! It’s just. I need it. I need him. Like I need to fucking breathe, Hermione.”
“Right, you don’t like nice. You like gone. Well after a couple of days we can go to the Burrow and then I’ll be right out of your hair...”
Draco caught him round the waist.
“Maybe I’ll put a pillow over your face whilst you’re asleep.”
Malfoy chuckled in his ear.
Draco glared at him.
She nodded. It was gone 10pm and The Order were looking tired.
“Oh god. Draco yes!” He came inside him, his fingers digging into Draco’s slim hips as he shook through his orgasm.
“But…now it’s, different.”
He felt Malfoy’s hands on his waist as he turned him around and tried to keep control of himself as Malfoy pushed him back hard against the door. He heard the metal handcuffs fall to the floor with a clatter.
“Potter...” Draco sighed in bored tone, “If you don’t start fucking yourself with that I’m going to come over there and fuck you dry...”
“I…I’m going to leave now.”
Draco undid his trousers and let them drop to the floor with his pants. Harry pulled Draco back towards him, groaning at the feel of their naked thighs and cocks together. He wanted more of Draco’s skin.
“Fuck.”
Harry moaned loud.
“Absolutely not.”
“I’m fairly sure they don’t shag when they’re on opposite sides.”
“Oh fuck yes,” Harry gasped. “Like that. Yeah.”
Lucius fell to the floor with a thud with a horrified expression on his face.
He was shaking in Draco’s arms as the thing fucked him, hard and fast.
“Have you had enough, Potter?”
“I thought I’d find you two still in here!” Ron came round the corner.
“You’re no killer, Draco.” Harry echoed Dumbledore’s words and Draco bristled.
“I... Don’t have time.” Harry managed to splutter.
Potter yanked his head back and whirled him around to face the crowd again. Draco dragged the stool back under himself for support.
The bell rang and Draco dropped Harry’s hand, turned and walked out the room without a backward glance.
Draco laughed.
“Because I’m not a tramp, Potter, and my mother instilled certain standards of cleanliness into me.”
“Are you at least going to take these bloody things off my wrists?” Draco sighed.
“Okay. We should actually get back,” Harry said.
“Yes father.”
They both winced. Harry was mortified. Now that his heart rate had settled and the had adrenaline seeped away, he saw this for what it really was. An embarrassment.
Draco smirked up at him, like he’d just proven his point.
“Can’t you just take them off for a minute?” Harry asked.
“I think I should get you to walk around naked more often.”
“Uh...” Harry blushed bright red, conscious that the toy had started to move inside him again.
The train screeched into the station and Harry pulled out their tickets.
“Then let’s go.” Draco leaned forward and started fucking himself on Harry’s cock, slow, so Harry felt every god damn inch of that tight grip around his cock.
“Fuck, Malfoy, I…” Harry’s heart beat was pounding in his ears. Every fibre of his being shouting yes and no at the same time.
Harry pulled back his slick fingers. He felt like he should say something. Anything.
“I need to buy you a drink.”
Harry supposed he might as well. He put his hands on Draco’s sleeping bag, his hands shimmered gold, it passed from his hands and spread across the folds of Draco’s sleeping bag. Draco groaned.
“So where do they think you are?”
“Oh Malfoy…” Harry winced at the bruises, cuts and scars that emerged as Draco washed the layers of dirt from his skin.
“Feels... Bigger.”
“Cos I like your cock. I like it a lotttt.”
“Was that why you got me out of Askaban, so I could be your office easy lay?”
“I do. But they don’t blind me into making reverse love potions in the middle of the night and developing.”
Draco’s hands on his skin was too much, even on his feet of all places.
Harry look in horror at Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange standing in his kitchen. Ron and Hermione were both bound and gagged, forced to their knees on the floor. They were both looking at him in equal horror.
“What?”
He walked over to the coffee machine and flicked his wand at it. Three mugs jumped down off the shelves.
Malfoy was still pink in the face.
“Yessss Potter.”
Harry groaned. It had been so long since anyone had touched him. Draco smiled and tilted his head, running Harry’s cock across his cheek and flicking his tongue out over the head. Harry was staring at his stunning ex-arch nemesis playing with his cock, a smug smile on his face. The cat that got the cream. Draco traced his fingertips over Harry’s balls and Harry jerked his hips. Draco raised his eyebrows and smiled.
Harry turned and changed quickly.
“Fuck,” Harry muttered under his breath as he ran his hands up Draco’s slight legs. The plug glinted, a purple jewel in between his cheeks. Harry took it with shaking hands and pulled. Draco gasped as it slid out. It was hot in Harry’s hand and he put it down on the table.
“Auror Malfoy you are not keeping that Ocelot. Are you both okay?”
He thought he was going to get a smack in the face for daring to touch Draco’s hair but instead he earned himself a low moan in his ear and a hand around his leaking cock.
“I’ll do it,” Harry said reluctantly. His body wanted it, sure, but his mind certainly did not. “You two probably want to spend some time together.”
Harry looked up at him with big eyes.
“I’ll trade you...” Draco gave him an evil smile and undid the rope around Harry’s wrists, only to wrap it round his head.
“Oh God.”
“Calm down, you idiot, I’m just making you look a little bit more presentable.”
“Mmm no, not yet sweetheart. We’ll go a bit bigger though yeah?”
“Apparently.”
“Ron’s right, Harry,” Hermione said. “Even if Voldemort has, for some inexplicable reason, entrusted his plans to a 17-year-old boy, I don’t think Malfoy’s going to give away some vital clue about them over dinner that you’ll be able to hear from two tables away.”
“Can talk for myself,” Draco muttered. “Alright Granger?”
Harry was glad Draco and tied him up, because now he didn’t have to worry about what he was meant to be doing with his hands. He knew it was only simple magic, that really, if he wanted to, he could break his wrists free. He left them where they were.
“You will with me. Trust me.” Draco said, pushing himself up on the floor and sitting butt naked on Harry’s sofa. He beckoned to him. “Pick a movie.”
“Fuck,” Draco muttered, straddling his waist and running a hand through Harry’s now long hair. He looked at him hard and ran a thumb down his cheek, then moved his fingers over his lips. “You are just...”
“You’re putting yourself in danger Harry.”
“I’m not bluffing,” the Death Eater said. It would be my absolute pleasure to send this brat to hell.”
“I wasn’t in a tent though,” Draco said after a pause.
“Draco. Come on.
“You look a bit spinny.”
Harry groaned as again his slammed up against the unyielding magic that was stopping him from coming.
Hermione immediately sat up straight and snapped her eyes to the front.
Harry was still surprised that Draco had stayed. Despite his sarcasm and foreboding he had turned up to work promptly on the first Monday morning, well presented, face blank of all sneering and insults. He always called Harry ‘Minister’, had a polite telephone voice and an unshakable mask that Harry actually found more frustrating that if Draco had been acting like his usual self.
“Look, you’re taking up half my seat.” Draco slapped his hand down on Harry’s thigh. “It’s called personal space, Potter.”
“You’re very quiet, Potter.”
Harry gestured to the red machine in the corner of the kitchen then went and lay down on his back on the sofa. The room was open plan, with just the bathroom and bedroom being separate. He watched as Draco took some mugs down from the cupboard and turned on the coffee maker.
“You locked the curtains, right?”
They were too close now. That had been Harry’s fatal mistake. He was straddling Draco’s lap. Could feel Draco’s hard and willing cock against his leg. He wanted it inside him. Wanted to ride him to his hearts fucking content. Now he’d admitted it to himself back at the house the thought came more freely. Which was horrifying in itself after a good five years of denial.
“How was the Farmer’s Market?” Harry finally thought of something sensible to ask him.
Draco took his cock to the back of his throat and Harry’s breath hitched.
“Well it depends which love potion he’s used, doesn’t it?”
Harry loved the pressure of Draco on his back, his weight, his breath on his neck.
Draco stroked his own cock fast, crying out as he got himself closer. Harry groaned as Draco’s arse tensed around his cock, and watched, entranced, as Draco reached his orgasm, his mouth dropping open and his eyelashes fluttering. He came hard on Harry’s chest and Harry was pulled over the edge with him. Draco slammed himself down on Harry’s cock hard and Harry cried out.
Eventually it subsided and Harry heaved in a breath.
Harry just blinked at him and tried not to come all over Draco’s hands. His eyes were rolling back in his head, his back arching when Draco whispered the spell under his breath.
“Fuck yes, Potter,” he gasped around Harry’s grip. “Fucking give it to me. Get those fucking fingers inside me.”
!” a hissed voiced and a pillow thrown at his head woke him up with a start.
Draco slid his thumbs in between Harry’s cheeks and spread them open. Harry trembled in Draco’s grip.
“Sorry.”
“Let him go.”
Malfoy was perched on the end of his bed. He wore a black polo neck, dark green boxers and black socks. Nothing else.
“Because...” Harry tried to put it into words. He wasn’t really sure why he was bothering, Malfoy clearly didn’t really care and just wanted to know so that he could manipulate him further. “Because you fuck me like you hate me...”
“So?”
This wasn’t a big deal, they lived in the same block, they shared taxis from events all the time.
Harry splashed some water on himself as a last resort to quell the madness rising within. He didn’t not care how Malfoy smelled. He cared what Malfoy was up to. About what was so important that he had to stay at school to take care of. The task that Voldemort had assigned to him.
“Now you definitely owe me a coffee.”
Harry gritted his teeth. He’d been relying on Malfoy being a brat and complaining the entire time to feel better about himself. Really, he knew he was dreading this weekend, he hated public transport, muggle or magical, and he bloody hated tents.
“Yes. Yes, Potter, yesss.”
“It felt so much better sleeping in my own bed than that bloody tent...”
Harry whipped round onto his back, horrified that someone would have heard Malfoy come in, but there was no sound from the other boys.
“Did you say something about breakfast, Granger?” Draco interrupted.
“Potter. You know how the Ministry feels about you using Wandless Magic in front of other wizards.”
Harry realised now what Draco had to do. He would have sank to the floor if it not for the spell. His heart broke for Draco. For his headmaster, who, he now realised, really had known this was happening all along. And let it continue, to protect Draco.
“Malfoy...” Harry started again, trying to reason with him even a little, the feel of Malfoy’s rough hands on his cock weren’t really helping his ability to form sentences. “Can we talk about this?”
Draco nodded.
“It’s Draco. I…”
Draco felt Potter’s eyes on him across the club. It had been a good five years since he’d felt that stare. He definitely hadn’t expected to feel it here of all places, when he was zipped into skin-tight leather and currently leaning on the cast iron bars of one of the many cages that were bolted to the floor of the club.
Harry yelped as Draco pulled the toy from inside him and dropped it on the bed. He shuddered in anticipation. Was Draco finally going to do this, or was it just another tease? Another attempt to push him ever closer to the brink of madness.
“I’m sorry, about your dad.”
“It’s only cordial,” Draco said at the look on Harry’s face. “The sugar will do you good.”
“Who wants to suck my poor boy’s cock?”
“Charming? Sexy? Irresistible?”
“They’re my parents! You don’t understand!”
“What are we doing?” Harry blurted. He couldn’t help it. It was peaceful, and warm, and Draco was lovely and naked and soft against his wet skin, but his mind was still screaming in objection.
“I’m ready. I swear I’m ready,” Harry babbled, wanting nothing more at that moment than for Draco to push his dick inside him. He was sure he could take it. The toy felt divine.
“Wow, Potter, you run here?”
Harry felt his mouth open of his own accord and despaired of himself. Why did he always submit to him like this? He was an adult now, why was he still playing Draco’s childish games?
Hermione raised her eyebrows.
“Oh, thank you.”
“Did he hurt you?” Hermione hissed.
Draco snatched his father’s wand from his fingers and snapped it. He picked his newly adopted wand from the floor and pointed it at his father. His hands shook, his mouth open, like he was trying to force his lips to speak the spell. Nothing came out.
“She knows everything,” Ron chimed in.
“Minister!”
Harry brought his wand up.
“Oh Potter that was so good...I’ve missed fucking you so much...you want to try for three?”
“Sensible. If you want me to stop, bang your hand on the floor. Safe words don’t really work when your mouths full.”
“Don’t look!” Harry hissed.
The woman’s scream came again from the room with the open door, amplified and shrill. Harry ran forward into the room, ignoring Malfoy’s hisses to slow down.
“Must be us.” Harry said.
Draco chuckled in his ear again.
“Gonna kiss me, Potter? Or have you not got the bottle?”
“I’ll go to Dumbledore, Malfoy. Can’t be Voldemort little spy if he suspends you, can you?”
Potter pulled the plug out agonisingly slowly.
Malfoy wrinkled his nose. “Veritaserum? I hate the taste of it...”
“It’s just scared. Poor little thing.”
Potter chuckled in his ear.
“You’ll be paid on the 1
Harry quirked a smile.
“Success.”
Draco’s face was golden in the glow from his sleeping bag. How he could look so innocent and be such a nightmare Harry had no idea.
He didn’t think he’d be able to think clearly for a second if Draco was still around.
“I am willing to speak on Mr Malfoy’s behalf.”
Harry and Ron exchanged an eye roll.
“What are they going to do?”
“No, it should only take a couple of hours.”
“Jesus fuck Potter.” Draco joined him on the floor, panting. He leant back against the wall of the closet and pushed his hair, wet with sweat, out his face.
Draco yanked down Harry’s trousers and pushed his face into Harry’s bulging boxers. Harry’s eyes rolled back into his head.
Harry appreciated the amount of effort it must have taken for him not to make a face. He knew the Ministry had seized Malfoy Manor and all their possessions. He didn’t even know where Draco was living at the moment.
Harry at least had the sense to keep quiet.
Hermione stifled a giggle.
Harry held his breath.
“And that’s why we’ll win this war Harry. Together. For everyone they’ve treated like this.”
He handed them out, getting curt, silent nods in return. He turned back through the window into the bedroom. He put his coffee down on the table next to the lightly glowing prophecy globe. He ran his fingers across the glass. Draco imagined someone had put it there to justify this whole thing. Harry was a friend to all of them, and he was sure Granger wasn’t the only one feeling outraged at the mere proposal of what they were putting him through. God knows where Weasley had got himself to.
Harry nodded silently. Trying to forget quite how much he’d begged for Draco’s cock.
“Harry? You smell nice. What have you been doing?”
The hot air from Malfoy’s breath hit Harry’s cheek. Harry had his wand to Malfoy’s throat. Malfoy had his wand to Harry’s waist.
“Any excuse to look at my arse, Potter...”
“How long are you going to leave him alone for?” Tonks asked.
Harry laughed.
He shook his head at his own delusion and hopped down off his bar stool. People seemed to be leaving. Draco came back over to him.
Draco shook his head silently.
“This is tearing me apart,” Harry said, quietly.
The parchment incinerated with a tiny puff of black smoke. Harry swore under his breath and sucked at his singed fingers.
Harry woke up to the usual 7am cacophony of alarms going off. He looked at Draco lying on his chest and froze in horror. Draco frowned at the noise and pulled the blanket up over his head, still half asleep.
“I’ll clear my diary.”
“Yes, yes, fuck!” he groaned, his toes curling as he still couldn’t come.
“You keep that for later.” He winked at Harry, pulled up his trousers, kissed him on the lips and was gone.
“I promise I’ll come and get you.”
“How is he?” Tonks asked.
“I just… I want.” He gave up trying to vocalise what he meant and went to push back inside him.
“Acceptable?!”
“Watch out for trolls!” Ron called after her just before the door slammed shut.
“You’re the one that said he hadn’t got the mark yet! That he’s just a kid!”
“Yes!”
“Please, please, fuck!”
“Come on darling, faster, earn your god damn keep.”
“I’d like to just stay here,” he muttered.
“Take your hands off the wall. Put them here. Like this. Hold yourself open for me.”
“Oh,” Hermione said, slightly startled. “That’s all right.”
“Oh come on...you’ll let me fuck you like that, but you still won’t let me kiss you?”
Draco released the spell. Harry was not ready.
The group erupted into giggles as she leant forward to spin it again. Harry was only half paying attention to who was about to have to snog the Slytherin brat and was watching Ron doing a victory dance on the other side of the room.
“It’s obviously gone off or something...” he muttered, glaring at the empty bottle.
“So, I’ve never seen a mark on him. I’ve never seen him do anything worse that name calling.”
Harry pushed on the door Draco indicated and found himself in a very large bedroom. He decided that ‘suite’ was probably a better word. Draco walked in behind him and grinned.
“It really is like old times.”
“So angry, Potter, aren’t you? That I came and reminded you of who you really are...” Malfoy whispered in his ear as leant up against him, pushing him back against the kitchen counter. He leant up to stroke a finger down his cheek. “So much pent up rage and denial...it’s not good for you...”
Harry shrugged.
Harry beckoned him to come closer and looked curiously at Draco’s arm.
“But always too good for me, weren’t you?”
Draco threw Harry the cloth over. Harry caught it without comment and ran it across the dusty table and chairs. Draco floated the plates over and hunted through the cupboard for some knives, forks and glasses.
Harry paused.
“Couldn’t resist, could you?” Harry rolled his eyes.
He wasn’t looking at Malfoy, he was sure he’d catch his eye and give the entire game away.
“God, I missed you.”
“Come here often then?” Malfoy quipped and came over to the table.
Harry paused, confused by the sight of Malfoy red eyed and distraught.
“Wasn’t sure if you’d be up to it.”
Harry rolled his eyes but did as he was told, working himself back and forth on Draco’s cock, bringing himself agonisingly close to the edge and groaning in frustration. Draco was grinning at him, a mad look in his eyes that just drove Harry higher.
“Then why can’t you hit me? Why can’t you even cast the tamest curse against me? Why, time after time do you let me do whatever I want to you...”
“Any progress?” Hermione asked.
He’d forgotten how tedious putting a tent up manually was. Which was impressive considering they’d had drills on it the week prior. Muggle practice. The current lead of the department was obsessed with it. How often he really thought they’d find themselves without their wands or having to pretend in front of muggles he really didn’t know.
No one said anything. Harry cringed.
“What isss the meaning of ‘carried away’?”
“These three have known for a few months now, have been helping care for the two young men. Draco, especially, needs help at this late stage of pregnancy. They were also essential in keeping the lie about Harry being off in training strong.”
“A nundu?!” Dimitri gasped, dropping his quill. He quickly summoned it back, writing furiously.
“Not there, idiot boy! To the infirmary! There is someone there needing this.” He tried to shove past them, but Potter, Potter-
“He more submitted to the nundu,” Draco explained. “Once he realized it was there, he tried to calm it and then just submitted to the gas to keep the nundu from attacking. Eventually, it left. Because of the poison in the gas, his eyes and vocal cords were damaged and … broke.”
“In case you don’t know, there’s no time to explain. We must speak with Draco right now. It is an emergency Mrs. Malfoy.”
This one's short. Sorry. :'(
They moved slowly to a bed so Harry would not lose his connection with Voldemort's magic.
“Or,” Ron said, looking around to see if anyone had noticed Hermione, “they’ve stopped looking. They said they would tell us if they found any new information. They haven’t said anything to us at all in the past month. What if they have stopped looking, ‘Mione? It’s been three months. No one could survive in there for three months. I remember when Harry and I went to follow the spiders. We almost died then. If Dad’s car hadn’t of found us… I don’t even want to think about it.”
Harry laughed again. “McKay Draconis,” he finally answered. “I do believe Blaise already told you that. It is what started this whole conversation in the first place, correct?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I slept around in school,” came the automatic response. Blaise blushed and closed his eyes, wishing he would stop speaking. “A seventh year introduced me to it when I was in my fourth year and ever since then I just slept with whomever I wanted to. I didn’t sleep with just anyone; I had my standards.”
Like Ginny’s guy
A hand around his wrist startled him out of his thoughts. “Draco wait,” Harry gasped, still laughing a bit, “wait a moment. I’m not… I’m not laughing… at you…” He coughed a few times and stood up straight to look Draco in the eyes. “I was laughing because of the lyrics. Did you listen to the songs before you changed them?”
Molly was dead set on cooking for the event; Narcissa was adamant about hosting it on Malfoy grounds, if safety allowed for it. Every detail was hashed out between the two women with the occasional input from Draco. Honestly, as much as he’d cared during the discussion of their wedding, he was less interested this time around. Maybe that would change after It was born. Right then, he was just lamenting his size and inability to move.
The merry voice broke the pair apart, and Harry moved forward quickly to hug his best friend. “Ron, you right bastard! I can't believe you didn't say anything!”
“I am not telling them that!” Draco suddenly shrieked. “No, it is not important for them to know. Harry, I draw the line. I–” He was interrupted by Harry’s gesturing. “It is
“McKay. I said he was kicking harder than normal.”
“So you like Dr. Rhodes then?”
Doing as told, Lucius Malfoy stepped forward and kissed the hem of his master’s robe once more. “Yes, my Lord?”
And Draco did. Because it was their anniversary. And what Harry wanted on their anniversary, Harry got. Just because it ended well for him too, being balls deep in Harry’s arse, well…
“Uh, Harry vetoes the idea,” Draco explained.
“Just a few more steps Harry,” Theresa coaxed. “There’s the door, right there. Okay, in we go. On the table, just like for a check-up.” She and Blaise helped Harry lay down on the table. “Do you want Blaise here?”
“And how do you know my middle name?”
“Really, it means a lot to him,” Theresa said with a smile. “The first time I was in their home in France, Blaise was frying some ham for one of Harry’s cravings. Well, he offered some to me and the three other doctors. They each took some, but remembering my sister-in-law’s cravings, I declined until Harry offered me some. Harry came in shortly thereafter and was very grateful for the ham. He learned that I was the only one not to take the ham and thanked me for it numerous times. And then, when we were alone for a private interview, he thanked me again. He didn’t know why he was so thankful, but he was. Just accept the thank-you and move on.”
“Alright, dears, just as we discussed. Once Draco’s contractions are about five minutes apart, we will begin the process. I know Harry has described a similar method of birthing in the muggle world where an incision is made in the abdomen to remove the child, but we’ll be doing something similar to Apparation to remove this child. No pushing, no cutting, no mess to clean up. Well, that’s not entirely true. The baby will be messy still!” She laughed at her own joke and went about preparing cloths and accoutrements.
Harry stopped him.
A bright light flashed around them, showing all in attendance that the union was accepted by the Powers That Be. A quick tie with a length of white silk around Harry and Draco’s left wrists, and the wedding was complete. Draco smiled and leaned over to kiss his husband. “We did it Harry,” he whispered. “Now no one can separate us. Ever.” The silk dissolved into their skin as if by… Well, it was by magic. He hugged Harry as tight as he could and felt it returned in kind.
Harry was confused, and a little afraid. Draco never just left. There was always a note or a message or something.
Draco cleared his throat. “Yes, well, thank you both for coming. As you can clearly see, we have a few things to discuss and announce. We will get to
Harry signed slowly, wanting to make sure his thoughts got to his lover loud and clear.
Harry started gesturing, but was cut off by Pomfrey. “Can someone explain to me what just happened? And why you were both on the floor? And why you both felt the need to completely ignore me?”
“Keep giving answers like that, Mr. Potter, and you will stay one very happy man for the rest of your life.” He kissed his lover soundly on the lips. Then he curled into Harry’s arms, his back to the Gryffindor’s chest, for a cuddle. Really, he’d gotten used to the idea of cuddling. And, to be even more honest, he liked it. With Harry and only Harry, of course. Two fingertips moved across this cheek and caused him to smile. “I love you too, Harry. With all my heart.”
“‘Woken’?” he repeated. “Don’t you mean ‘awoke’?”
“Blaise?” he called quietly as he knocked on the door. “Blaise are you in there?” There was a bit of mumbling so Harry opened the door and walked in. After closing the door, he made his way to Blaise’s bed and stood beside it. “Blaise can you hear me? Are you awake? I don’t mean to wake you so late, but can I stay here with you for a bit? Please?”
you can keep your trap shut. It’s a pretty simple story. Harry and I got lost in the Forbidden Forest. We wandered around for about five months. In that time, we stopped hating each other. End of story.”
Harry bowed his head respectfully and bit his lip. He could ‘say’ whatever he wanted and Snape would be none the wiser, but that wasn’t the point. Instead, he looked up at the man, pointed at him, pointed at himself, then interlaced his fingers in front of him.
Immediately, Draco seemed to shut down. His face and eyes darkened and he frowned heavily.
Harry shrugged and looked down at Draco.
And he was down for the count.
“Track their magical signatures!”
. You years of spying, your dedication to Harry, helping him and saving him, and caring for him… Thank you.”
“That’s about it,” Draco confirmed.
“Harry? Are you okay?”
Harry pulled out his tongue and quickly lined his prick up at Draco’s entrance. A little faster than he’d planned, he pushed into his husband and bottomed out. Draco cried out and came over the sheets. “Yes, Harry! Yes! Fuck me! Fill me up! I need your seed, your come! Only you, Harry!” He tried to thrust himself back onto his lover’s prick, but Harry held him still. “So big, so full. Oh, I can feel you pulsing inside of me. It’s perfect! So big… Only you, love, only you.”
Harry looked completely affronted, as did Draco. Ron just looked ill at the thought.
happen. Got it? Okay then. On with the fic.
“We don’t have to listen to you, ferret boy!” Ron shouted, taking a step forward. “You’re a part of this, I’m sure. They might not see you for what you really are, but I do! Whatever you’ve done to him, you will pay for it, Malfoy!”
“What?” Draco asked. “What was that about? What’s wrong? What’s in that potion? What did you make him smell?”
“And this is supposed to make me feel better?”
Harry shook his head in the negative.
“For Merlin’s sake, help me... Please... Severus...”
Hermione gasped. “Gone?”
“I’ve been found out as a spy. I have to go.”
“How did Mr. Potter come to be mute?” Dimitri asked.
flew out to LA for the weekend,
“How dare you imply that I sleep around with men and don’t know my own child’s father!” Harry yelled at the same time. “I’ve only had sex with one person and that’s Draco Malfoy!”
No way! (No way!) I think you need a new one
“It has been five months. What is the position of my newest catamite?”
“How did he get to that position?”
“One word Blaise: Voyeurism. Pervert.”
“It’s just not fair. I’ve done everything I’m supposed to, and now it’s all wrong! It’s all useless!”
“Shut up Blaise. I can too cook.”
“Right,” Draco said. “Well, for our vows, I said this.” He handed each reporter the promised wedding photo and his vows. “But, since Harry cannot speak, he used our gesture-based language to simply say ‘I love you’. Like this.” He turned to Harry and they grasped hands. They heard two cameras click to capture the moment.
“I want to know Harry!”
“I don’t understand why that’s so amazing. I can use Ron’s wand just as easily. Watch.” She snatched Ron’s wand from his back pocket and summoned a whole tea set, complete with biscuits. “It’s not hard. Is that not normal?”
Harry roared via legillimancy at Draco. Harry so rarely used the mind reading ability that it startled Draco into stillness.
, Harry magicked.
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
“It means that the last time anyone saw or heard from Harry or Malfoy was at dinner just before their detention with Hagrid. Remember when Hagrid returned? All the teachers were frantic! Some rushed to the Hospital Wing with Madam Pomfrey and the other half rushed to the Headmaster’s office. They told us a few days later that Malfoy was in the Hospital recovering and that Harry had been moved to an undisclosed location for training. Something weird’s going on here. I don’t think Harry was moved anywhere. Come on. We need to speak to the Headmaster.”
“So we wanted to know where they were. The last time anyone saw them was dinner before their Forest detention. When Hagrid came back that night, all the teachers were in a frenzy. Half came here and half went to the hospital wing. The story we were given was that Harry was taken out of Hogwarts and Malfoy was recovering. We know that’s not true. Where is Harry?” she asked, face firm but eyes almost filled with tears.
“How did you work out your hand language?” Madam Hooch asked.
As the tears started to dry up, Draco realized what Harry had been trying to ask. “You’re worried about publicity? Right now?”
“She’s too unsure of herself for a case this big. I don’t mean to sound full of myself, but I think she’d break under the pressure of keeping quiet about Harry Potter’s baby. She’d be a great doctor under any other circumstances, but not these. It’s too much for her.”
Harry held out two more.
Gesturing.
“Mornin', Ron,” Harry answered, a big grin on his face. Surely Ron would mention his birthday?
“I’m getting to that,” Draco said, still holding Harry’s arm.
Harry nodded. “Why are you here?” He watched the witch as he ate another piece of ham.
Rather than stand there and watch the…
Draco was dreading the interview all morning. He kept moaning about how fat he was and how ungainly. So Harry had to show him just how attractive he found him to be.
him?! Fuck Harry, when did this happen?”
“What are you yelling about, Severus?” Draco asked, walking out of the loo.
“I swear if she tells me to push one more time I’m going to kill here!”
“Albus, I’m telling you, I can’t take it anymore!” he ranted to the Headmaster. “They’re at it like crups in heat. There is no place in my quarters that hasn’t been desecrated by Potter. The kitchenette, the sofa, the rug in front of the hearth, even the walls! I cannot return to my quarters without some kind of change, a guarantee I’ll not see this again. Maybe they can have their own set of rooms?”
“Let’s go to the library and work on our projects. Lunch is over.” They left with the Patil twins, Dean, and Seamus to head to the library. Once there, Seamus and Dean stopped to ask Madam Pince where books on dragon’s blood would be so they could do some research. Padma and Parvati went straight to the back of the library to gossip. Hermione pulled Ron over to a table near the front, but enough back so as to be semi-private. “We surprised them last time, so Professor Dumbledore doesn’t know who’s there until we reach the door.”
did happen. However, Dumbledore is not dead. The events of
It turned out each layer was a different flavor. The first piece Harry tried was lemon custard; he passed that on to Draco with a puckered face. The next piece was a much nicer strawberry. Once everyone had a piece, they sat back down and resumed their conversations. Draco motioned Albus over so they could discuss their education.
“Whom is McKay’s father?”
“Okay then,” Dr. Morris said quickly. “I will get these copied so you can have a copy to take to the Ministry with you to get the annulment. You do realize that this isn’t over yet? You might be put through that again.”
“Draco, look at me. Look at me. The public needs to know sooner rather than later. Your child is also Pott- Harry’s child. This is something you will have to deal with for the rest of your life. It will grow up in the spotlight just as he did once he re-entered the Wizarding World. It will be out there for everyone to see and know about. Maybe not physically,” he rushed to assure as Draco drew in on himself. The worry and despair from the younger wizard called to Harry, who reappeared once more to hug his husband. “Potter will be there to help you through this. He won’t let anything happen to your child. There is no way he would. I will also be there. Understand?”
After a moment where Draco’s heart did not beat, Harry nodded once. Then he made the sign for water and Draco quickly conjured some up, rushing to be by his side. Harry slowly sat up and sipped the water as Draco helped him, then moved the pillows so he could lean against them.
“Well, the serum is in effect so I know that’s true. Just a moment please.” Dr. Morris turned back around and picked up a small notepad and a quill. She whispered two charms, one to make both items float and another to make the quill write whatever was spoken. “My name is Doctor Jennifer Morris. I am specialized in all basics of medical needs for witches and wizards, and specialize in male pregnancies and the such. I cannot deliver, but I can assist.” She point to Theresa to do the same.
As Harry softened inside Draco, he eventually pulled out naturally. Harry helped Draco down onto his side on the bed for a post-coital snuggle. This was Harry’s favorite moment. Not that the other stuff wasn’t nice, but cuddling with Draco had always been the reward for the ‘other stuff’ for him. He really enjoyed feeling the baby move beneath his hands. He’d been so jealous the first time Draco had felt It move, but he couldn’t yet. Now, however, it was obvious when It moved. It stretched Draco’s skin and summersaulted around as much as it could in its confined space.
With a shocked expression on his face, Dumbledore quickly left the infirmary. Poppy set up monitoring wards and spells to let her know if anyone else entered the hospital wing before closing, locking, and warding the door to the private room she, Harry, and Draco were in now. “Please, Harry, I am sorry for the interruption. I am so sorry if I frightened you. I have placed wards and charms around this room and the whole hospital ward. I will know if anyone comes in, and the door is locked so they cannot get into this room. Please, allow me to treat both you and Draco. Just place him back on the bed. I must check on the baby.”
“Yes Harry, and all for you.” This time he didn’t protest as Harry began to devour his lips and mouth, then moved down his jaw to his neck. Draco loved it when Harry paid special attention to his neck. Especially when he marked it. It was like a claim, that he was Harry’s and no one else was allowed to touch, or even think about touching. Tonight, however, was not a night to linger and take things slow. Both were wired, both had spent the last twenty-seven or so hours apart from one another. Harry needed to know that Draco was okay, that Draco was
“My apologies, Harry,” Dumbledore said genuinely. “We were unaware how much our conversation was hurting you and Draco. I believe we shall-”
Draco stiffened immediately, sobered even faster. As fast as he could, he turned and made his way to the infirmary. There was no sight of any students in the halls, no Madam Pomfrey in the infirmary, no Snape anywhere. “Where are they?!” Draco whispered frantically. His eyes darted back and forth, searching for someone, anyone. But they searched in vain. Until Harry started walking forward, away from Draco. He moved to a wall, reached his hand out toward it. “What are you doing? We’re supposed to be looking for my father!”
“He’s got charms on his doors, and he won’t return any of the notes I’ve sent him.”
Harry smirked and snatched the paper from Snape’s hand, writing something down before giving it back.
he thought to no one in particular.
“What is wrong with him?” In an instant, Lucius was by his side. “Did Potter remove his Mark as well?”
“I thought you didn’t know when It was conceived,” Snape said.
“Harry! Are you okay?”
“Potter-Malfoy,” Draco automatically corrected. “Can you blame him, Severus? He’s scared of what everyone will think of him, say about him. He’s different enough without being this powerful.”
“Should we have chicken, duck, or fish as the main course? That will decide everything else, of course. If we have fish, we can have red wine served, but not if we have chicken. On second thought, scratch the chicken. Duck or fish? I wonder if anyone has any allergies? That would be a fiasco. Hmmm, although duck would probably be best, I want some fish. Okay, so fish. What soup goes with fish? Let’s go with… A vegetable medley maybe? Yes, that sounds good. It would also show Pomfrey I’m eating healthy as well, and gaining more weight. Merlin knows I don’t need to gain anymore weight!
“Anyways!” Draco stressed. “I asked him what was wrong, why he wasn’t talking. So he started talking. Only no sound came out of his mouth as it moved. We found a patch of ground with no grass or plants and he began to write in the dirt. I suggested we find somewhere a bit safer to take up residence for a while.” Draco fidgeted in bed for a moment, then took up the story again. “After we found a nice place, well, as nice a place as the Forbidden Forest can provide, we got to talking. Harry wrote in the dirt and I talked aloud. We finally realized Harry could use wandless magic to conjure paper and a muggle pen. It was a little easier after that.” He fidgeted again.
ready to tell everyone. I believe I’ll show Harry around the château in France, if that’s okay? And may I ask for a few weeks alone?” They both blushed, Harry a little more than Blaise. “It is our honeymoon after all.”
Silence rang throughout the beach home. You could hear the children playing, and the voices talking, even the water splashing upon the sand, but it was all ignored by the two men. Draco’s eyes dropped from Blaise’s face to his feet for a few moments. “What’s his name?” he whispered.
happen. Got it? Okay then. On with the fic.
As he was about to take his first bite, someone called out, “Hey Harry, show us how you see!” There were several answering murmurs in agreement.
As he neared his quarters, he lowered his wards and checked for any of Potter’s own wards. They didn’t always remember silencing charms, but sometimes he got lucky. When no extra wards were found, he knocked loudly on the door and waited a few moments before slowly opening it. He peered around its edge to see Harry and Draco standing in a corner, with Harry positioned protectively in front of Draco and hand raised.
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
There was an audible sigh, but Snape relented. “He’s nodding.”
“Okay, take care of Draco first. Got it. You write down everything you can remember from the night of your detention to showing up at Professor Snape’s classroom today, okay? Every little detail, everything you did or ate or said. Everything Draco did and ate and said. How you two stayed alive. Do either of you have your wands?”
“Keep your mouth shut, Dr. Morris, and there won’t be any media backlash,” Blaise growled.
, he signed,
Harry sniffled and looked up. “I’m going to pick the doctor? Why not you?”
But it wasn’t enough. Draco moaned at the contact, leaning forward a bit and putting his hands on the headboard for balance. “More, Harry. More.” It wasn’t like they hadn’t had sex just last night. Draco was still nearly insatiable despite his even more constant comments about his looks and his weight and his lack of appeal. Only because he was still slightly stretched from all the recent activity did Harry push two digits in on the next pass. Draco groaned in approval, pushing back to try and hurry it along.
Harry’s eyes were on his fingers absentmindedly playing with Draco’s hair. He didn’t want his friends to see him differently, didn’t want anyone to be afraid of him. He was just an eighteen-year-old kid with a husband and a baby on the way. And, okay, he was blind and mute too. But still normal!
“Nothing. I told Harry there was no reason to involve them, and that’s the way it will stay until he is conscious and can argue against my point. Until then, they stay clueless. The way all good Gryffindors should stay.”
When Voldemort fell, all action stopped almost immediately. The backlash riveted through the Dark Marks, disrupting the battle and spells being cast. Aurors and Order Members alike began casting
They left the house and went to Harry's favourite restaurant. They had a great meal, great company, great service. Draco didn't tell anyone it was Harry's birthday, so they didn't make a scene. In fact, when he'd made the hasty reservation earlier, he'd told them to expressly ignore the fact that it was Harry's birthday or else. It was a wonderful dinner in which Harry truly enjoyed himself. As they headed home, the talisman in Draco's pocket heated up to tell him things were ready at his house.
Harry began to rant about all the things he was suffering from, all the things that hurt him. He couldn’t stop, didn’t want to stop. He didn’t care who he was telling; Ron and Hermione were so concerned about saying something wrong around him that they had practically stopped talking to him altogether. Dumbledore didn’t try to do anything else with him, and all of his teachers had given up. Well, Snape still hated him. Now more than ever if the pensieve incident was anything to go by. Harry ranted about that too. Suddenly, he wasn’t ranting anymore and a pair of soft lips and strong hands held him in their grasps.
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
“If you wish.”
“Harry did it,” Draco said in a small voice. “He wants me to apologize to you, Professor McGonagall. He planted those words and thoughts in your head through legillimancy. It takes a lot of energy for him to do so, but he knew it was the only thing that could possibly save us from being seen.”
“Uh, no. We haven’t. We were lost for five months. We’ve been here for one month. Remember when you burst into the headmaster’s office and McGonagall told you two that they’d found old tracks of ours? We were there, in the office. Harry hid us from sight because we’d only recently returned to the castle and were still too– We did not yet want our presence known to anyone, even you two.”
Draco laughed softly and turned to face his godfather. Harry came around to sit beside Draco on the couch. “It was really just my emotions getting the best of me, really,” Draco said, holding Harry’s hand with both of his hands in his lap. “I was upset when Madam Pomfrey mentioned the name for our child. We both need an heir; we’re both the last of our lines. We are both powerful wizards. I’d say we needed at least two children, but we didn’t even know having one was possible. But that’s off topic. I was upset because when a witch has a child out of wedlock, she’s shunned. I don’t want that to happen to me. I want the Malfoy name to be a wonderful name. And I don’t want to besmirch the Potter name.
“You don’t get it. I had his wand.”
“Allow me,” Severus said, not happy about it. “It was a gift from Messieurs Wormtail, Padfoot, Moony, and Prongs, a group of students long since come and gone from Hogwarts. It was used, in their time, for pranks and sneaking about. Misters Potter and Weasley and Miss Granger have used it for sneaking about, and usually getting into trouble.”
Harry sniffled and wiped his nose on the sleeve of his black robe. “Are you sure?”
“Do you know who I was?”
It was Molly Weasley who broke first. “You knew? You knew Harry was missing, was in danger? That he’d come back blind? That he was having a baby?”
“Harry, Harry calm down!” Mrs. Zabini insisted, rising to her feet to stand before Harry. “It’s not good for the baby to be this stressed out. Calm down now. Take some deep breaths. You’re okay, just come sit down and talk to me. I will say that I am unhappy about being left in the dark about something this important, but I do see why I was. Now then, come and talk to me about what’s going on. There must be more to this story.”
Harry shuffled himself and Draco out of the way so Snape could leave to tend to Lucius Malfoy. As Draco cried into his shoulder, wondering why his godfather had betrayed them all, Harry tried to think of a way to calm his husband. He decided to just let the emotional outburst pass before he tried to explain anything. However, Harry nearly lost his patience in waiting for that moment of being done to arrive. When it finally did, Harry tried to explain things to Draco.
“Y-y-yes, m-my Lor-r-rd,” Lucius panted, struggling to breathe. He was really okay with not moving right now.
“Minus three pieces? Did you eat some?”
When he'd woken up this morning, Draco had been laying there beside him, sound asleep. There was no breakfast in bed, no presents, nothing. Okay. That was okay. Draco and he could celebrate that evening or something. Surely that was why Draco didn't say anything before he went to work.
“Yes. After saving my life, Harry was stuck in the nundu’s poisonous cloud. When it and the nundu cleared away, Harry was left blind and mute. That is why we learned to speak to each other, or rather him to me, in a gesture-based language. As for his vision, he uses his magic to see. It’s a sort of sonar or echo-location.”
“It’s okay Harry. Like I said, I understand. I don’t want to keep you inside, but I do thank you for promising not to go out unless I’m with you. I promise I’ll go out into the gardens with you at least once a week until Theresa says no more. How does that sound?”
“He’s his second, his most trusted. Anywhere he is, my father is also there.”
“And, last but not least, something blue. Hmmm…” He washed his hair, then thoroughly rinsed it. “Mimsy?”
“Please, it’s not as if–” Draco was cut short by a new voice drifting through the partially open door to their bedroom.
After coming forward and kissing his robe, the man began to speak. “We were successful, my Lord. All of the crystals were obtained in a timely and efficient manner. All muggles in the area were killed… eventually. A few of the others got a bit carried away, but the task was completed as you willed it.”
“Regardless of the name given, it will be Harry’s child. If you secret it away and the news is leaked – before or after the birth – how do you think the public will take it? Surely you don’t
(See the end of the chapter for
“They’ve found Harry!” Hermione whispered excitedly, ready to jump out of her seat.
“Feel, Draco... Don’t stop...”
“Thank you Dr. Whittier. Dr. Rhodes? What is your response?”
He lead Harry out of the room, a room which is totally silent from the revelations that had been given. Ron took the initiative to get the guests out and clean the house quickly before he and Hermione left to go to their own home for the rest of the evening.
“It’s okay. Do you want me to rub your stomach? Mother and Theresa said it helps sometimes.”
“Ah! Yes!” Draco cried, arching his spine and throwing his head back. He cock gave a small jet of pre-come.
“Really?” Harry asked. “You’ll take me wherever I want to go? Me and McKay, the both of us?”
“Mudblood, you will not speak–” Lucius Malfoy started.
Pomfrey had been made aware of the situation and was on standby, also having taken a pepper-up.
“Coming right along, dearies. Coming right along.” Madam Pomfrey started waving her wand and taking readings from both Draco and the child, nodding and humming as the results were produced on a piece of floating parchment. “Very good, yes, yes, nicely sized, good readings, excellent levels. Well, all seems to be in order here. We are just waiting on you, ducky.” She patted Draco’s belly lightly.
Green eyes were blankly staring back at him, he suddenly noticed.
After nearly a month in the Hospital Wing, Draco and Harry were given permission to move around and not stay in their bed or beds all the time. Harry followed close behind or beside Draco wherever he went, casting spells or testing food anytime they came upon something not provided by Harry. While it irked Snape to no end, he had to admire the boy’s casting ability and spell knowledge. Draco was definitely in good hands. They were told to hurry to their room or cast an invisibility spell if and when someone else came into the ward however, as the rest of the school was not to know they were there.
“Where is Potter? I must thank him. This changes everything. This changes everything! Where is Draco? I saw him earlier? I must speak with him now. And Potter. I must thank Potter.”
“I don’t understand,” Draco answered, still confused and worried.
I POSTED THE WRONG CHAPTER FOR CHAPTER 6! PLEASE REREAD 6 AND 7 SO IT MAKES SENSE!!!
Harry had to laugh at that one. The music changed again to a fast pop song.
With a heavy sigh, Blaise sat across from his mother and began the long explanation. “Harry and Draco became friends and then boyfriends shortly before the downfall of the Dark Lord. It was the day before graduation when I found Harry in the Great Hall. He told me he was waiting for Draco because Draco had something he wanted to talk to him about. He also told me he was pregnant with Draco’s baby. I hugged him in congratulations and Harry kissed my cheek. We were friends, that was all. I thought Draco knew that.
“And so do you,” Madam Pomfrey insisted, standing up now. She and Snape had been sitting during the tale. “You need to get some rest too. What ails you cannot heal without proper sleep. You’re safe here, now. I will watch over you.”
it said simply. Pomfrey pressed a ring into Harry’s hand that he, in turn, pressed into Draco’s.
That did it. With a simple nod, Harry was at Snape's side with hands over his forehead and stomach. Voldemort's magic was more advanced in Snape, more spread out. It had completely taken control of his left arm, and was trying to control the vital organs: heart, lungs, and brain. Once that happened...
So, do we know the drill yet? I don’t own Harry Potter. I never have, and I’m pretty sure I never will. I don’t own Draco, Severus, Hermione, Hagrid, Petunia, Piers, Bane, or Fluffy. I don’t own Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Privet Drive, or Fortesque’s. I don’t own the Knight Bus, Mr. Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia, the Hogwarts Express, the Nimbus 2000, or the Firebolt. Do we get the point yet? I don’t own anything. Except the horrors I’m about to put all of these people through.
More gesturing.
Not that Harry was complaining, but Draco’s sixth month of pregnancy brought about a new symptom: increased libido. He couldn’t get enough sex. If Harry left to go anywhere, he was jumped as soon as he returned. If they were in the living room, there was sex on the couch. If they were in bed, there was sex on the bed. Shower? No problem. Friends over? Who cared?
“Yes, My Lord.” Lucius bowed once more and then moved back into line at the hand gesture from the Dark Lord. Voldemort continued on then, calling forth this Death Eater and that one, giving them orders. When they were finally dismissed, Lucius really did take a sigh of relief. As he turned to talk to Severus, he found the stoic man was already halfway to the door. In an almost undignified manner, Lucius rushed to him and grabbed his upper arm. “Severus wait!” he whispered harshly.
“The detention,” Severus immediately answered.
“Gladly,” Draco answered. “Now if all of you would just bugger off...”
But truly it was Severus, Lucius, and Narcissa who were the most impressive to Harry. The three took no mercy, using the Killing Curse liberally on their former comrades. They didn’t build up their curses in intensity but went straight for the kill. They knew their opponents were there to fight dirty and win at any cost. So they would do the same. The three cut a nearly straight path for Harry right to Voldemort. Having spelled his husband and son asleep then locked them safely within the dungeons of Hogwarts, Harry strode straight to the Dark Lord and wished him
“Oh.”
Harry just flipped him the bird before cuddling with Draco on the couch for the rest of the night. Snape left when it was time for dinner, making sure the house elves brought food for Harry and Draco first. Then he had two detentions to oversee, which didn’t allow him back to his rooms until late. Which was perfectly fine by Harry and Draco. They had found other things to occupy themselves with for the rest of the night.
With a shrug, Harry held up a hand and pushed his magic out through the crowd. Signing to Draco, he named several people in the crowd while Draco translated.
It took a moment, but Draco began to notice little peculiarities about his godfather. Like the soaking wet hair that was even now dripping on the stone floor. Or the bare feet. Or the lack of trouser pants below the hem of the robes he was wearing, which seemed to be completely ruined by some potion or another.
“It’ll be okay, ‘Mione,” Ron reassured. “We’ll go see Dumbledore and make sure things are okay. Come on. How about we go up now? That will put our fears at rest.” Hermione nodded and they both stood and left. Slowly, they made their way up to the Headmaster’s office, knowing he would be there. They were hoping Snape would be there as well, and maybe one or two others. They wanted answers, and they weren’t leaving without them.
Harry nodded again, the look on his face saying he was not happy with the re-breaking idea.
“Hello Mr. Potter, er Zabini. Excuse me. I wasn’t told about anything that would be happening with this appointment. Is this a check-up for one of you, or the child?” she asked.
Dumbledore turned to Draco. “Repeat after me. I, Draco Lucius Malfoy, in the name of the spirit of Merlin that resides within us all, by the life that courses within my blood, and the love that resides within my heart, take thee, Harry James Potter, to my hand, my heart, and my spirit to be my chosen one. To desire and be desired by thee, to possess thee, and be possessed by thee, without sin or shame, for naught can exist in the purity of my love for thee. I promise to love thee wholly and completely without restraint, in sickness and in health, in plenty and in poverty, in life and beyond, where we shall meet, remember, and love again. I shall not seek to change thee in any way. I shall respect thee, thy beliefs, thy people, and thy ways as I respect myself.”
“I will! But you’re not understanding. It’s the principle of the thing. I want the wedding this week so I can have semi-decent wedding photos, Harry. Can we do that? Can we have the wedding this week?”
“Again,
“Harry, Gods, help me up. I gotta pee again.”
“Oh right, yeah.” Harry flicked his wand at the collapsed table under the sofa and assembled it in the space he’d cleared for doing his exercises in the morning.
He glared at Malfoy over his cauldron. Malfoy looked up and mouthed ‘what’ at him over his cauldron.
Draco hissed in a breath in anticipation. Harry teased him, running the tip of his cock over Draco’s arsehole.
What was unnerving about the recent development in his obsession with Malfoy was that to Hermione and Ron, nothing had changed. They rolled their eyes just the same when Harry didn’t answer because he was too busy staring at Malfoy. When he suggest they take a detour to ‘keep an eye on him’.
“I’m sorry.”
“No,” Harry said eventually, pulling himself together. “Not at all. I just didn’t realise you worked here, Sam. We know each other from school.”
“I’ll find a way to prove it.” Harry hissed back.
“If you’d quite finished,” Harry said.
Harry didn’t rise to the bait.
Draco looked up at him from where he was resting his head on Harry’s chest.
“Yes, of course, I meant, would you like a drink?” He flagged down the bar tender.
Draco picked up Harry’s glasses from the floor and put them back on his face. He flicked his wand and they fixed themselves. They were also cleaner than Harry had ever managed to get them.
“Be careful,” she said again. “If I can walk in here and catch you anyone can.”
“Harry? Harry are you okay? I think we need to take you to Madam Pomfrey.”
Light steps on the floor.
“Promise. Promise, get me off and you can come with me.”
“Let me get the violin out.”
Harry stared as Draco peeled off his t-shirt and crawled across the bed towards him.
Harry stood himself up on shaky legs and walked back with Hermione, trying to ignore the sideways looks she was giving him, like he might drop down dead at any minute.
“See you on Monday.”
“That’s a Phoenix, Pixies, a Griffin, and what looked like a very large cat.”
“Avada Kedavra!” Harry was quicker.
“Mr Weasley didn’t think you’d believe me.”
“I said that to get your pants off Potter,” Draco drawled in his ear.
“It’s better than nothing.”
“We’ll see. Any time you’d rather be in Azkaban, you let me know.”
Draco leant forward as he fucked him, touching their foreheads together. Harry stared back up into Draco’s grey eyes, unashamedly falling into them, headfirst. He hoped never to return.
Draco nodded and downed the bottle, lay back and closed his eyes. He looked tiny and frail in Harry’s bed as he fell asleep.
“Locked you?!”
“Yeah? Where shall we go? Maldives?”
“Of course they did.” Harry sighed. “God, Draco, how many years ago was that? How does anyone still remember that?”
“Morning,” Draco said brightly.
“... Yeah.” Harry managed to squeeze out of his lips. “Really fucking good.”
“I’m not! It’s just sex. I just need it. It’s good for us. Like. Stress relief.”
Draco fucked him hard, his palm coming down on Harry’s leg again and again until they both covered in sweat, sliding against each other, their skin coming together in wet slaps.
“Hold on.”
Harry sighed in relief and relaxed back into the chair. It was all going to be okay. Hermione would fix him, and Malfoy’s childish little trick would be over. He jumped as she dropped a pile of books on the table.
“Your PA. He’s excellent. Mines hopeless. She can’t even take phone messages properly.”
“Now beg like a good boy.”
Harry realised he was going to have to say something to get them all to leave. He got rid of the silencing spell. Draco sucked harder on his cock.
“Why are there so many?”
“Yes, and that you’d be here.”
Harry jerked around and sat up in bed, searching in the darkness for the source of the voice.
“Easy...” Draco ran a hand down Harry’s back. “Relax.”
“The jury will confer.”
“With what?” Harry asked calmly.
Draco didn’t answer, just carried on bobbing his head. Harry groaned, resigning himself to a humiliating early finish, letting himself buck into Draco’s mouth, he clenched his fists, ready to come down Draco throat but he just…couldn’t. He opened his eyes and looked down at Draco.
“They thought because of your use of it in the Triwizard cup you were obviously part of the movement.”
“You should run away and join the circus.”
“Don’t mind me.”
The problem seemed to be quite extensive. He was trying to concentrate, but all he caught, whilst looking at Draco over the man’s shoulder, was giants, ketamine, border control, and something about a Niffler.
Draco put his hands on Harry’s hips to steady him.
“They didn’t think it would be wise, as cocky as they seem, they weren’t about to go and attack a house full of adult members of The Order.”
“You know I hate it.”
Harry couldn’t form a reply.
“Turn over.” He told Harry.
“Yes, father.”
Harry didn’t dare push further and continued to wolf down the delicious food.
He knelt.
“Okay, okay you ready?” Draco panted underneath him.
“I think I preferred it when you were angry,” Draco said.
“Harry? You alright?”
He imagined half Slytherin house waiting for him in the room of requirement, cameras out, ready to tear him to pieces.
“Hermione knows.” Harry blurted.
“Moody taught it me. He learnt it from a sword swallower.”
Harry rolled his eyes; for all the times Draco had fucked him, he still didn’t understand why he’d chosen him or why he found him attractive at all. Simpering girls and their mothers who thought he was a hero found him attractive. Draco Malfoy...god knows why.
Harry let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding and sagged against the wall. He considered turning around and punching Draco in the face.
“How were the giants?” Draco asked him.
“Potter please. I need.”
“Potter faster.”
“Oh yes. I always wondered if my Gryffindor boyfriend would like being tied up.”
“Yeah you wanna come?”
“You fought with Draco, right?”
“Poor little boy wonder.” He pulled his fingers back, moved over Harry and pushed his hard cock back inside him.
Apparently this seemed more like praise to Draco than it did to Harry, as Draco was positively beaming as he led him upstairs, wand at his back.
“Can I take you out for dinner tomorrow night?”
Harry muttered darkly under his breath, scribbled his assent on the rsvp and threw it on his out tray.
“Coming,” Harry shouted.
Harry gasped.
Draco cast a warming spell on his dinner and began to eat in the hostile silence. It was not the worst one he had ever endured in this dining room. Not by a long shot.
“That’s what they needed me for.” Draco grinned at Granger.
