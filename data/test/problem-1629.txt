he’d never felt so stupid in his life.
Potter sat back and listened, fingers rubbing the armrests again, his face intent, but Draco thankfully could see neither contempt nor pity. He just listened, and accepted. He’d probably experienced Bellatrix’s wrath first hand as well.
It was just a room—dusty stone tiles covered the floor, with stone walls and a stone ceiling and two stone pillars in the middle. Cold, hard earth that hadn’t been touched in years. Harry’s boots left footprints in the dust as he walked further in, breathing in stale, musty air.
Harry sat, cautiously, his eyes darting back and forth between Draco and the tiny bottle on the side table.
He approached the door and knocked twice. He felt a moment of envy, that Malfoy’s black front door looked anything but grim and ominous. The black door of Grimmauld Place looked actively unwelcoming, as if its purpose was to turn people away. Another black door haunted Harry’s nightmares, occasionally, a foreboding destination at the end of a long, tiled corridor, that Harry avoided in real life as much as he could.

this. You were fine, you were content, until the moment you were healed.”
“Yes, it’s highly likely that was the attacker’s goal, but I’m stumped as to why. I don’t see how this—” Draco gestured between himself and Harry, “—could be beneficial to any sort of agenda, other than getting Harry out of the way for a bit. But there are much simpler ways of getting him out of the way—Harry was pretty much defenseless, at the time. They could have done anything to him, but they did
“Master Draco is being angry at the morning again,” Timsy’s hoarse, quiet voice dragged him out of his thoughts. The elf was eyeing him disapprovingly as he served a fried egg on top of Draco’s toast—good and runny, just how he liked it. He must have appreciated the baklava Draco brought home yesterday.
He approached Draco casually, watching his pale face strain further. Draco stepped back, away from him, and Harry paused again as something
Harry shot up in bed with a harsh gasp, shaking and sweating. Draco stirred slightly beside him, his white-blond hair splayed on the pillow, his hand reaching, but Harry was already out of the bed, pulling on the nearest trousers, walking out of the room. He grabbed a blanket from the sofa and wrapped it around himself, then stepped out into the front garden, sucking in crisp, clean air.
Draco chuckled at her impeccable logic. “Fair point,” he replied, gathering her close to his side. Harry watched him fondly.
“How long is this assignment, sir?” Harry asked.
been this angry before, and it was only growing, both of their rage fueling the other.
“Complete coincidence,” Harry replied, smirking. The new snake slithered down Harry’s leg and circled Draco’s feet excitedly.
“Merlin’s beard, look at the state of him—”
“I heard a rumour, Draco,” she began silkily, still leaning against the doorway. “A silly rumour, at the Ministry, when I was filing some divorce papers. I heard a rumour that Harry Potter was cursed, and had been unable to work for several weeks.” Her eyes were threatening in their suspicion and anger, rooting him to the spot. Draco swallowed.
I know, no one could touch you while you were there, they kept you safe from
“I’m curious…” Draco hesitated, and Harry looked up at him, a little pleased. Draco reminded himself that Harry
Draco stared at him, his eyes still wide in alarm and his lips parted in shock. Then he huffed, shook his head, and leaned in.
Harry felt a deep, coiled rage building slowly within him. He had started training long after Draco had been freed, and there’d been so much going on in those weeks right after the War… He knew the Aurors had spoken of the Malfoys viciously, always talking up different ways to bring them all down, even after Draco and Narcissa had been fully acquitted. Ron had weeded out as many of the dirty Aurors as he could, when he climbed the ranks—he and Harry had thought they’d seen it all. But Harry wanted to make absolutely sure those arseholes had been dealt with. Dismembered, hopefully.
Harry hated every second that Draco remained unsafe. He couldn’t relax, his hands constantly fidgeting, fingering his wand, his feet always pacing. Fear and regret were dragging him down like an undertow. All he had wanted, all those years ago, was to keep Draco safe, to ensure his chances of success, to protect his life away from his father—and now he was in danger, trapped by his father once again, thanks to Harry’s thoughtlessness.
please.”
The long-distance Portkey gave them a clumsy landing in the middle of St. Mungo’s bustling reception area. Harry had to sidestep quickly to avoid a witch with horns and a young boy that seemed to be mostly puddle.
Harry opened his eyes again, defeated. Ron had sat down, and he watched Harry carefully, concern and sadness written all over his face—probably imagining Rose in the same situation.
Not now, Draco told himself, behind his careful Occlumency walls.
“There you have it,” Draco said. “Now you know what it is I’m writing all the time.”
Ron said. Harry fought a wave of nausea, pulling out
Harry gave a noncommittal hum of assent, taking the file from Head Unspeakable Kramer’s hands. He flipped it open to reveal one single piece of parchment, as always—Harry didn’t know why they bothered with the thick, pretentious files.
Malfoy’s face fell for barely half a second, before a stony mask slipped on, the faintest hint of fire behind cool, apathetic grey eyes. Harry suddenly felt worse than he did ten minutes ago, facing his first ever loss to Draco Malfoy.
“Weasley. It’s half five in the fucking morning on a Sunday. What in Merlin’s name do you
“I didn’t wear them for
He paused on entering, realizing the room was still in disarray from his fevered research the night before. He waved his wand in a slow arc in front of him, and the books and scrolls steadily put themselves away, leaving his study looking immaculate once more. He went to the windows and drew the curtains, letting in the bright morning sun. The walls were covered in bookshelves, holding a wide array of tomes and medical texts and curious—and relatively benign—magical artifacts. Plants stood in every corner and on the shelves that received the best sunlight.
“Merlin, what a prat,” Draco muttered, and he could feel a small spark of Harry’s amusement. “I certainly knew how to make a fool of myself around you, didn’t I?”
Harry blinked himself out of his daze, and shrugged.
“You clearly don’t have the stomach for it, Weasel,” Draco said, pulling out his own wand. “If you’re going to bully Potter, do it right.” With a casual flick, he charmed the box to life. It started chomping like a greasy, cardboard mouth, and promptly attacked Harry where he sat. Draco watched smugly as it chased Harry around the library, filling the spacious room with Ron’s guffaws and Hermione’s giggles and Harry’s indignant yelps.
“Yes, Master Draco?”
Draco was able to sleep after that, but it was fitful and shallow, his dreams marred with flashes of green eyes pleading from a swollen face, of a warm body against his chest and fiendfyre at his back, of blood in the water on the floor of a flooded bathroom.
were you able to steal a vial of Veritaserum from an Auror?” She asked, and Draco scowled at her. She would have made an excellent Slytherin. Harry was looking at her with pride, and thoughtfulness.
It felt like every mundane thing he’d observed in the last ten years had been a placeholder, something to tide his eyes over until they could see something
They walked Andromeda and Teddy to the floo, and Draco was bewildered by the carefree joy that was Teddy skipping down the dank, oppressive corridors of Malfoy Manor. The juxtaposition was absolutely baffling.
“Thank you for indulging me in that experiment,” Draco said, unable to keep the smile off of his face. It felt so good to beat Harry at something, anything. His inner twelve-year-old was whooping with joy. Harry shook his head at him, still smiling, his cheeks flushed from the wind, his dark hair utterly chaotic. Draco’s heart raced—from victory, or flight, or something else, he didn’t care to know. He simply savoured the lightness in his chest, and moved on.
Draco took Harry’s chin in one hand, tilting his face up for another kiss, so consuming that Harry nearly dropped the floo powder in his hand, but Draco ended it much too quickly.
“This is where the wards begin,” Draco explained, motioning towards the shimmering, transparent wall ahead of them. He started flying lazily along the barrier, all the way around the property, with Harry next to him, watching, listening. “They extend half a kilometer in each direction from the house, including up.” He motioned above him. “People can apparate into the front walkway, but not if they have any intention to cause harm. You probably felt an assessment of sorts on your way in.”
“Mine, then?” Malfoy clarified, and Harry nodded at him. Malfoy reached into his jacket pocket again and pulled out a card with his apparition coordinates, handing it over. Harry took the thick parchment in his hand, feeling its smooth edges under his fingers.
“No. I haven’t
Harry thought for a moment, staring at the fireplace, before turning a new page and writing again.
And there, standing stock still at the top of the hill, staring out at the turbulent sea, was Draco.
“It’s alright—” another painful spasm, harder this time, and he wheezed heavily as he clutched tightly at his waist, curling in on himself.
I realized after posting this on tumblr that some folks don't know what a Maybach is, and that's alright, but this is so much funnier when you know it's a kind of bourgeois Mercedes. It is worth it to explain my own joke. The image makes me cackle.
Harry berated himself for ever thinking this curse was easy. He was really going to have to endure Malfoy’s Legilimency for six bloody weeks.
“Maybe,” he replied, “but does it make the sound?”
Draco’s hand shook as he tried to portion the tea, spilling a few leaves onto the counter. He dropped the spoon into the container with a frustrated huff.
like that.”
“Pay them no mind, Harry. This is perfectly platonic, if you want it to be.”
“Draco’s magical core was bound to the three tenets of Healer’s Ethics, in order to get his Healer License: to protect patient confidentiality, to do no intentional harm, and to maintain ethical standards in Healer-patient relationships. He physically can’t talk about you or your case to anyone else without your expressed consent—we had to watch that happen, before you arrived, that night. It hurts him, terribly, even when he’s being as vague and generic as possible.”
She only pursed her lips at him.
Draco looked back at Lucius’ unconscious body, wondering if he’d be able to set him on fire wandlessly, when Lucius was suddenly wrapped up tightly with thick cords conjured from the air. Draco snapped his head around, causing a wave of dizziness, and saw Harry lowering his wand, still laying on the floor, gasping for breath beneath him, safe, alive,
“Then they gave me an incredible gift.”
The mediwitch smiled at him and said, “You’re welcome, Healer Malfoy,” and Harry could hear the respect in her voice. He was struck dumb by it.
“Why?”
Harry, you can’t
Harry didn’t have to be the
Potter looked thoughtful, but his eyes flashed again, with something like excitement. Draco assumed Auror Potter would probably be raring to go, eager to investigate and finally catch the bad guy. But he waited for Draco to continue.
Harry seemed to pick up on something, anyway, as he bent to write again.
Harry continued to dissociate as the blood drained from his face.
The weather wouldn’t have made for a good flight, and Draco was still feeling drained from the Veritaserum, so they spent their midday break inside. Draco hadn’t even tried Legilimency after that ordeal. They’d spent the morning in their chairs, discussing the theory, brainstorming who might have such bizarre motives, and coming up blank.
Harry raised one eyebrow, and waited.
That was odd. Didn’t Malfoy infer, what with Ron himself recruiting him, that they already had that sort of consent? Harry furrowed his brows and nodded, sitting up fully and crossing his legs under him, giving Malfoy his full attention. Malfoy blinked at him a few times before speaking, looking him carefully in the eye.
Harry said nothing, trying desperately to adjust his eyes to the darkness.
The memory ended, and the scene swirled into another. The same bedroom surrounded them, but this time, with twice as many Slytherin decorations, and twice as many books, that mostly looked heavy and old, and quite boring. Night had fallen, and thick, fluffy snow was falling outside the window.
And that was how Harry had landed his first and only job, as a Junior Unspeakable, with the very top secret title of
“Like…
“Are you ready?” Draco asked, and Harry took another deep breath as he nodded.
“Okay, Harry,” Ron said clearly, and Harry recognized his face and body language from those he used right before a chess game. “Spill.”
Harry always thought the room looked like it was underwater. It was certainly quiet enough to be.

the idiot, for trusting the Unspeakables, and for volunteering to get herself Vanished, and for believing that
“Fair enough,” he replied. Harry’s lips turned up in a small smile, and Draco returned it.
He was dressed impeccably, as per usual (the exception being this morning). He’d decided on his muggle charcoal three piece suit, because it was neutral, he’d thought, even though it didn’t look nearly as striking as the cobalt blue suit or the forest green robes, and he wore a pale blue shirt underneath his waistcoat. He couldn’t wear black, of course, that would seem ominous, and camel was far too relaxed, obviously, and the burgundy would seem
Draco led the way out of the study, straight to the kitchen, where he could hear Timsy cooking and humming something out of tune quietly to himself. It smelled incredible, and—Draco grinned with anticipation—luxurious. He summoned two water glasses and filled them with his ice-cold lemon aguamenti charm. Harry took a glass gratefully, sitting down across from Draco at the table.
He felt…
“Ham and swiss?” Ron’s blue eyes lit up as Harry tossed the wrapped sandwich over his desk, plopping himself down in the wooden chair in front of it.
“Did you just lock us in or something?” Ron asked suspiciously, hand still poised over the chess board.
“Draco…?”
“You have such little faith in me,” Harry groused, then stepped, side, back, side, dancing
“Do you have any more questions before we wrap up for the day?”
“Would they be using Polyjuice, as well?”
“He will not harm you,” Lucius mused, “no, I dare say he will protect you
“They’re broken,” Draco managed between gasps. Harry squeezed him, pressing his lips to Draco’s shoulder.
Harry hummed softly, then returned his gaze to Malfoy. He hadn’t moved. Harry could see a dusting of snow collecting on his dark jeans. That jacket was definitely not warm enough for this weather, no hat, no gloves, no scarf—
Hermione rolled her eyes in exasperation. “Childish, Ronald,” she muttered, playing along.
fuck—”
“You’re mad,” he murmured, but he kissed Harry again anyway.
The water was a little choppy, but the boat’s path was surprisingly smooth, even as storm clouds gathered overhead. Harry wondered if they were Narcissa’s doing or his own.
And that felt
Harry slipped a small note under the Warden’s door:
Fuck, that was definitely a wand coming closer. He felt the instinct to
The booth finally halted, and the door opened, releasing him into the buzzing Ministry Atrium. It was nearly lunchtime, so it wasn’t crowded enough to make Draco panic, but it was still horrible, being here. He tried to keep the grimace of nausea off of his face as he straightened his spine and crossed the floor briskly to the Wand Registration booth on the other side of the room, eyes on his destination, steadily ignoring the stares and double-takes.
“What do the Unspeakables want with me, Harry?” he asked quietly, that crease of puzzlement between his brows. “We both know you’re not here by coincidence.”
“Harry, are you alright?” Draco asked, brows furrowing with worry. To Harry’s horror, the back of Draco’s hand touched his forehead, checking for a fever. Merlin, what was
let it go. Draco interrupted her before she could get into her stride.
Draco summoned two glasses from the sideboard against the wall and poured himself water from his wand. Harry picked up his glass and held it out to him, biting his lip.
him—he felt sharp pain in his knees and assumed he’d hit the floor, as his father’s voice sounded again, above him, much closer, and his vision was darkening and fuzzy around the edges—
“Then it shouldn’t take very long at all, and you’ll be out of here in time for supper.” Draco slowly raised his hand towards his chest, but didn’t grab his wand yet. He felt Potter might bolt if he drew his wand without warning. Draco raised his eyebrows. “If I may?”
“Yes,
What an incredible life he’d stumbled into.
for Merlin’s sake, his precious day off. It was probably another incompetent mediwix unable to decipher his (perfectly legible, thank you) notes on a patient’s chart, again.
But Harry only pulled out his wand and vanished the empty food containers, folding up the blanket on the floor and picking up his notebook. So Draco pulled his own out of his pocket and stopped the record player, levitating it and the empty record sleeve out of the sunroom, back to the sitting room, inferring that they would simply pretend it had never happened.
why the Ministry didn’t want to give an ex-Death Eater a Healer License?
“No, he wanted me to see if you wanted to join him.”
Lucius touched the bars with his hand, and they wobbled, widening just enough to let Draco through.
“They said you’ll be free to go by the end of the day, Draco,” Hermione said matter-of-factly, perching on the end of his bed. “You were brought in for extensive physical and magical exhaustion, as well as a thorough potion detoxification—although it didn’t take nearly as long as they thought it would, because apparently someone had started the process using
“Did I hurt you?” he asked, worried.
“You want to create false memories,” she whispered. “Big ones.”
“I’m a Falcons fan, myself,” Draco said. “They’re not doing too well, this season, but we know they’ll turn it around.” He gave Teddy a private grin.
Harry immediately felt the strangest, quietest mental invasion. Timsy hadn’t incanted anything, but of course, house elf magic was nothing like wizard magic, even with a wizard’s wand. The wand was only a conduit, through which Timsy could focus the strength of his magic, and he marshalled it skillfully into searching Harry’s mind for traces of Draco’s magical signature. Harry was currently the only thing around that Draco had used magic on recently, and powerfully, over a long period of time. Harry only hoped that not too much time had passed since he’d left—since Draco had come to know him, and Harry had attacked him for it, not two hours after
“It’s not a party.”
Harry strode to the floo, opened his mouth to tell Timsy to stay behind—but shut it quickly at the piercing glare he was given. Looked like he’d be flaying the Minister with an audience, after all.
Harry grumbled at the intrusive owl, cleaning himself off and reluctantly extricating himself from the warm bed. He unlatched the window, and the bird flew in, dropping a heavy scroll on his bed and landing on the bureau with an expectant look.
“Legilimency only hurts if the caster wants to cause the pain. It’s a horrific headache, but the worst part is feeling defenseless, invaded, and helpless—again, Bellatrix’s favourite effect. She liked that it wasn’t as messy as other forms of torture, and more interesting than a Cruciatus.” And now, Draco couldn’t suppress his shudders. His memories of his Aunt’s twisted, gleeful face as she pointed her wand at him time and again were at the forefront of his mind—she’d enjoyed using the Unforgivables on him as well. He knew he’d be panicking if he didn’t even out his breathing soon.
to protect, Draco would murder him if anything happened to her. He lifted his head, seeing Timsy standing up from the floor, casually dusting off the sleeves of his jumper, and looking at them expectantly. Harry struggled into a sitting position, raising his wand before standing fully, and his stomach dropped upon seeing where they had landed.
He managed to hold himself together until he got to Grimmauld Place, flopping down fully clothed in a bed that smelled like dust.
Draco’s eyebrows shot up. “You must know I haven’t,” he replied, “as you probably know I plan to keep it that way.”
“Wait, Harry,” Hermione interrupted him again, “are you saying Draco kissed you
Draco probably knew that, because he was clever as anything and he knew Harry too well. But knowing it and hearing Harry say it himself were two very different things, he knew. Harry locked eyes with him again, reminding himself that he was a bloody Gryffindor, even if this felt like the scariest thing he’d ever done.
Harry started writing again, shaking his head vehemently.
Harry asked. Hermione’s mouth twisted.
“Are you doing
He wrote.
“I, er. May have.” Harry looked down at Draco’s free hand, which had subconsciously picked up a yellow scrunchie, and was stretching it between thumb and forefinger, slipping it onto his thin wrist. “Quit.”
“In a bit. Fix her, first,” Harry said, motioning with the hand attached to Narcissa’s.
“But for someone trained to feel it, your magic, even at rest, causes the hair on the back of my neck to stand up. If I couldn’t see or hear you, I would still be able to feel you, and I would know it was
Harry looked up. As if that would help.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco had done that after enough of their back and forth correspondence while he was studying for and subsequently applying for his Healer License—it was terribly inconvenient to correspond with the Minister normally, and he’d needed the Minister’s involvement to get his license approved, considering his background. Shacklebolt had helped keep an eye on him, personally, after his trial, so they had spoken and caught up every few months since then. Draco had found it odd, but knew better than to question it. He’d figured if he could prove himself to the Minister for Magic, beloved leader of Wizarding Britain, it would help ease the way into his career, and his return to England. It hadn’t, really—he still felt threatened when he went out alone, and the Licensers at the Ministry still required him to be magically bound, even with Shacklebolt’s stamp of approval. But at least, Draco hadn’t had any Aurors breaking down his door with every whiff of neo-Death Eater activity. That, he could probably attribute to Shacklebolt—maybe. There might have been plenty of Aurors who were itching to bring a Malfoy their own form of justice, but Weasley and Harry probably wouldn’t allow that either, without sufficient cause, as committed as they were to that trademark Gryffindor
“You,” she barked at a young mediwizard, who jumped a little. “Firecall Auror Ron Weasley, get him here ASAP. Speak to no one else.”
It felt like London, if London were unfamiliar and labyrinthine, and if Harry couldn’t understand anyone around him. It was a beautiful city, Harry admitted, and he found himself picturing Draco in every cafe, every park, every narrow, cobblestone street. He rented a scooter and imagined what Draco would look like riding with him, his arms around Harry’s waist, his hair whipping behind him as they weaved through the endless traffic.
Harry looked at him intently again, searching his face for something, lips pressed tightly together. He let out a huff of breath, and nodded. Draco raised his wand and cast.
“Hence, she
The door opened, and the room suddenly became a lot more crowded. Ron Weasley entered first, giving Draco a friendly nod as he stepped silently up to his bed, barely sparing a glance for their joined hands. He pulled a tiny leather pouch that jingled with galleons out of his pocket and tossed it at Draco, smirking and shaking his head, before turning away, moving on to visit with Boran.
He turned to Draco after his inspection and brought his index and thumb together on one hand, separating them by about an inch, before making a quick grabbing motion with the same hand.
Taking a deep breath, he looked at Harry again, and wordlessly charmed the hot chocolates Timsy had prepared to float over to them. Thank Merlin for foresight.
and other little notes that just weren’t adding up.
Harry dropped his wand and stepped back, glaring pointedly at Smith, gesturing towards the door to the tiny office. Smith glared back, rubbing the welt on his neck.

Draco was piling up his mountain of regrets and guilt and fear behind his Occlumency barriers. He really wished they could have skipped this year.
Draco’s Occlumency barriers crashed, and he withdrew so quickly it probably left a vacuum in Harry’s head. He let out a harsh, shaky breath, and rubbed his face with his hands. His glasses immediately fell forwards; he ripped them off, tossing them carelessly onto the side table and closing his eyes. His emotions were storming again—fear, regret, anger, loss, pain—he tried his best to keep up.
Harry continued watching Draco’s hands, as if hypnotized, as they finally landed on his chest, continuing their journey upwards, and through the seizing, Draco could feel Harry’s heart racing beneath his uniform.

Harry steeled himself, taking a deep breath. He knew what was wrong with him: he was an unlucky, cursed bastard. He opened his eyes to meet his former enemy’s gaze head on.
Ron nodded shortly.
As if that was the only signal it was waiting for, forked light shot down from the clouds, whipping him with the flaming backhand of an angry god.

He walked quickly down the hall to his study, once again facing the split chalkboard, as that Seer child’s hoarse voice started playing on a loop in his head.
He fell over in shock as the silence of the cliff was broken by loud, exuberant laughter. He hit the ground again, this time with an
He had made the ultimate sacrifice for them all—because he had to. Because he always did, because no one else could, or would. And then he
“Excellent! Tikka masala?” Draco asked, clapping his hands together in excitement.
He froze, staring out over the sea, unwilling to move a muscle. His breath hitched, a tear fell down his cheek; he didn’t know how or why he was feeling this, but he never wanted to let it go. He’d come close, before, he’d felt

Other than imbibing the final product, of course, and traipsing around Europe with a torn, thirsting magical core, and getting struck by lightning. Harry tried his best to put it out of his mind, but some of the freshly-purchased jars in his rucksack wouldn’t stop
“Now, we figure out how to Conjure a human being,” Hermione said, her lips pressed in a grim line. “And continue on with the investigation, until we can’t anymore.” She brought her book over to the table, squeezing Ron’s shoulder. “And then, probably take on the Ministry, as we are wont to do.”
“I mean, he kind of is, now,” Ron muttered, “it’s obviously not his
Draco’s eyes flew open, and he winced. The morning sun was far too bright, the sharp tapping noise far too loud, his pyjama trousers far too snug—
Harry rolled his eyes at him, the corners of his lips twitching upwards.
Unless… Draco frowned harder. Hiding Harry’s voice did limit his healing options quite a bit. It was really something only a Healer Legilimens should handle, and Legilimency was indeed a very fast and intense way to get to know someone. But Legilimency shouldn’t be used to just get to know somebody, it was horribly invasive, not to mention dangerous if done incorrectly. Draco certainly wouldn’t trust a Legilimens who cast on him
“Well, wealthy purebloods make up the majority of Harry’s political opponents,” Ron mentioned, frowning. Draco knit his brows in confusion.
Rose whipped her head back to Draco, her face shy but eager, curly hair flying in every direction with her sudden movements.
“Well, darling, this person surely didn’t curate this tape to convey their
that wasn’t a lighthouse—under a Fidelius Charm later that evening. Hermione accepted the position of Secret Keeper, which Harry had suggested because she was the only one of them, apart from Draco, who didn’t work at the Ministry. By the time the sun set, the only people who had access to Draco’s home were Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Draco himself.
Ron whirled around. “An entire vial?!” he asked, incredulous and apparently somewhat irritated. Draco felt like he was being chastised, which was stupid, because it was long over, and he was a grown man who made his own choices—these days. He bristled defensively.
… apparently it was a tool of power, a
He put his hands on the wall on either side of Harry’s head. Harry desperately wanted to touch him. He didn’t.
“I’m happy to see you, Harry,” she said. “I told you, you got the important part right.”
Harry was drawn inexplicably to those sharp edges, like the spindle of a spinning wheel—he didn’t care that it would prick his finger, that it could destroy his life, he wanted to
It wasn’t until he was safe behind his own wards that he realized Potter still had his handkerchief. Oh, well.

had changed.
It hadn’t changed at all—it still looked like Courtroom Ten, but instead of the horrible chair in the middle of the floor, there was a stone dais, upon which stood a high stone archway, with an old, tatted veil flapping gently in a nonexistent breeze. The walls held at least ten identical doors, one of which they had just flown through.
Harry smiled, but his eyes were sad. He nodded once. Draco returned it, and took a deep breath.
He’d never attempted anything like this before, but it couldn’t be
“If that’s all, Unspeakable Potter…” Kramer raised an eyebrow, dismissing him with a wave and a smile.
Harry huffed a weak laugh at him. When, exactly, had Draco’s insults started feeling more like endearments?
“I don’t mean keep an eye on you, as in make sure you weren’t doing anything illegal or nefarious,” Shacklebolt clarified, apparently getting over his discomfort with this admission. “He was… he was worried, that Wizarding Britain and the Ministry would try to hold you back, because of your history and their grief and anger. He said he wanted to make sure you got the second chance you deserved, and that he didn’t testify for you for nothing.”
His shoulders and chest had broadened, his thighs filling out those soft-looking jeans like they were made just for him. His pale hand curled protectively around the door frame, one socked foot on his doorstep, halfway over the threshold. Harry’s eyes finally met his, like a collision of metal and flint, sparking a familiar, incendiary feeling in his gut. They were the same colour as the silvery clouds above him, somehow the brightest thing around, even as they narrowed in blatant suspicion and hostility.
He was dropped unceremoniously two feet above the hard earth, hitting the stone with an undignified
“Is this where you finally do me in, Potter?” Draco asked lightly. “Good spot for it, I suppose, no witnesses, no cleanup, not a single
“Sorry,” he mumbled, and the person said nothing, thank Merlin.
Draco’s breathing was shallow and his hands shook as he replaced the sphere on the shelf. He backed away as they began to move once more, back to their original positions, and suddenly he was running, instinct driving him away.
“I don’t believe so,” Draco replied. “Why, are you making plans?”
Harry left the room without another word.
“Did you think a
“Why not?” Hermione probed.
“I had to,” Harry croaked. “I wanted you to be happy.”
A mediwitch knocked twice and entered the room, holding a bar of Honeyduke’s chocolate. Malfoy took it from her with a quiet, “Thank you, Nanette,” which baffled Harry more. Had he ever heard Malfoy say thank you before?
“In the Department of Mysteries? Level Nine?” Harry asked, and Timsy’s eyes squeezed themselves shut.

Draco took another deep breath, lowered his hands, and rotated his whole body in his chair to face Harry fully. Harry fought the urge to rest his hands on Draco’s knees, but he wasn’t sure what else to do with them. He should probably move, he thought, but logic and reason had abandoned him a while ago.
Draco opened his eyes after a long, silent moment, with an expression of stone. He picked up his plastic fork, and started eating, as daintily and elegantly as he had at that stupid French place. Harry watched, transfixed, waiting for the coughing, the pleading,
“Draco, come inside,” Harry urged. “You’re going to get frostbite.”
In his enhanced, exposed, overstimulated state, the tear felt like a razor blade as it trailed down Harry’s cheek. He traced his finger over the painful words, surprised that there wasn’t blood in its wake.
Harry huffed. “The rest is just as important.”
“Okay,” he croaked, and the feeling slowly let up. He gulped in air, stretching out his limbs. “Alright. He’s not coming.
“Weasley,” Draco replied, consciously making an effort to snap his jaw shut and school his features back into
Malfoy must have seen this in Harry’s expression, because he sighed deeply, slowly lowering his wand to his lap. His face softened as he held Harry’s gaze.
“Good,” Draco praised, and he could feel Harry’s appreciation of it. “You’re getting better, this is calmer, more controlled. I hope it feels easier for you, too.”
in such an inhumane way,” Hermione scoffed.
They both looked away from each other at those words. He knew Harry would say nothing in response, and Draco didn’t want to see relief on his face. He wondered if Harry was curious about Draco’s insane reactions to that kiss—Draco would have to answer him, if he asked.
Scowl firmly back in place, Draco reluctantly stepped aside to allow him in. Weasley let out a relieved huff and hurried past him into the foyer, where Timsy was waiting to take his cloak. Draco stepped around him and began walking to the sitting room.
I must not tell lies.
“Yes,” He replied, because he did. The whispers were even stronger than they were last time, and he knew that if he listened hard enough, he would hear Sirius, or Remus, Tonks, Fred, his parents—
“Or, you could give me all of your
one particularly shaped you?”
“Could you please bring us some coffee, perhaps some biscuits as well? And a bar of chocolate, just in case,” Draco added, remembering the day before.
Draco sighed again, and decided to tackle these one at a time.
Not that he’d thought about it that much.
“I even got fuzzy Grouch slippers, for Christmas,” he whispered, like a secret, and Rose’s eyes widened with interest. “They look quite silly. Do you want to see them?”
Today, Harry felt brave enough to try the cellar.
Ron said, in what he might have thought was a smug French accent. “He actually seemed
Draco frowned, thinking hard. “The Snitch…” he mused. “Why’d he give you a Snitch?”
“You’ll have to lock me up, Weasley, if you want me to stay behind, and hope that I don’t have my own methods of breaking out, I told you I’m not letting either of you out of my sight, since you’re the reason Draco’s in danger
“Mae,” Ron said with a mouth full of sandwich, his eyes flying open. “I gob

mate.”
“Alright, then there’s two paths we could take today.” Draco sat up, ready to work. “Option one: we go through your memories of that pub, to try to learn more about your attacker. I’d use Legilimency first, to sort through all of them quickly, then pick out any relevant ones for us to look at in a Pensieve. I’d probably go back three months, at least.”
“I know.” Harry closed his eyes, leaning his head back on the cushion. Draco sighed.
Draco’s face smoothed out into a tiny smile, which seemed to please Harry. Typical, that Harry would use Draco’s own words, like that—but appreciated, nonetheless. That Harry Potter remembered and valued anything he had to say was a miracle in and of itself, just as the fact that Harry Potter was
“I pulled out some memories, for you, a couple of weeks ago,” Draco began tentatively, “of Dobby, when I was young. We can watch them, if you’d like.”
Harry only smiled, and looked at Draco curiously. Draco returned the grin.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh. This was his new favourite muggle. Ever. Willem looked a little insulted, so Harry collected himself quickly, his lips still twitching with amusement.
“You,
“Like being walloped by a burning building.”
When he finished, he pocketed his wand and spun around to find Harry, Ron, and Hermione staring at him, wide-eyed and slack-jawed.
It was a large bird with bright, beady eyes, a white-feathered belly, and powerful, dark wings. Its beak was sharp and curved; a bird of prey. An osprey, Harry thought, though he hadn’t seen one since April, diving into the sea on Draco’s beach.

“I am,” Harry sighed, looking up at the freshly flowering branches above them. He said nothing else, so Draco continued staring at him expectantly, until he finally looked back at him.
“I do,” Harry said. Draco came even closer, his eyes burning with fury, pinning Harry to the wall with his stare.

Harry’s lips twitched as he pretended not to hear their conversation. Draco squeezed his hand again, and continued down his mental to-do list.
“No, Harry,” Malfoy interrupted, rendering Harry speechless with the novel utterance of Harry’s name,
Malfoy’s scowl turned indignant. “I am not.”
“The snow,” Draco said. “In your ridiculous hair.”

He drifted about the musty house, searching through rooms he hadn’t used in a while, reacquainting himself with the place. He hadn’t spent a night here in over a month.

Harry looked away. He wished it wasn’t true. He wished a lot of things.
“It’s not about
“If mornings would stop being so horrible to endure, I might be happier to see them,” Draco retorted. He set down his coffee mug and started in on his breakfast.
Harry takes a deep breath of warm air full of sugar and citrus, but his lungs can’t quite manage it; there’s not enough room, with everything else he’s holding in.
“I think we should put your home under a Fidelius Charm.”
He looked up, and Draco met his eyes, brilliantly green as always, even in the dim light of this awful room. Draco remembered once thinking he could do this wandlessly, if Harry kept looking at him like that, so he locked onto Harry’s gaze desperately, trying to tip forward, to fall in—
Harry eyed him suspiciously, but pulled out his wand and performed the diagnostic charms on the bottle, identifying it as Veritaserum. He wondered if Harry even recognized the bottle. It was definitely the same ones Aurors used, he knew. He’d nicked it from them himself.
“You mean you don’t, Weasley?” Draco snapped. “You still think it’s completely normal that the Unspeakables want
Ron levitated the half-completed game aside, sitting forward in his chair. Hermione continued standing, arms crossed over her chest, her face expectant and a little excited. Malfoy glanced at them, briefly, before returning his gaze to Harry. Harry thought he saw a flicker of unease in his eyes, but that could have been anything.
Harry grinned softly. “So are you.”
Draco didn’t know what was happening outside of this room, but he knew that

and she was
After breakfast, he spent about an hour perched on his sofa, fixated on the boombox and the “mixtape” which sat on the coffee table in front of him. Yes, he knew where the “play” and “stop” buttons were now, but he couldn’t figure out how to get the tape inside the thing, and though Pansy had said it wasn’t named for explosions, he still didn’t trust all those buttons, and didn’t want to risk pushing all of them willy nilly—what if Pansy simply hadn’t pressed the right button, what if it
The grumpy little owl still sat on his dresser. Apparently, he was to wait for a reply. Draco summoned a biro and quickly penned an affirmative response on a small piece of notepaper. He was about to hand it over to the disgruntled bird, when he stopped himself—he didn’t want the bird to report back negatively to Weasley. His reputation was at stake, so he summoned the pouch of owl treats from wherever it was in the house. A small thud hit his bedroom door, and he rolled his eyes at himself.
If everyone could have stopped asking him questions and let him ride this sodding panic out, that would have been great. Harry forced himself to think, to remember that inconceivable person, the ease with which they’d caught him off guard, lowered his defenses, and given him an order. He felt sick, his hands were sweaty and shaking, but he shook his head in answer.
? He felt like he’d have to look at this memory in his Pensieve later to prove to himself that it actually happened.
Draco unloaded his burden onto the wide, wooden butcher block island in the kitchen. The flowers rolled across the wood. As he stretched his arms out, his elbows tense from holding the blooms so delicately, he caught a glimpse of the Dark Mark, grayish-red and hideous and exposed on his left arm. He put his arms down quickly, hoping Harry hadn’t noticed, but according to Harry’s pinpointing stare on his arm, he most definitely had. Draco, embarrassed and defensive, reached his right hand over his torso and started to roll his sleeve back down.
But Harry shook his head, smirking, and raised his hand to his face. He tapped his forehead twice, crooking his finger with an invitation. Draco hoped he wasn’t blushing again.
“Right, yeah, that’s the thing. It’s weird that she’d turn away your Patronus,” Ron mumbled, scratching his stubbled chin.
He was the same snobbish, caustic, expensive prat that Harry had known in school—and he
“But—”
but Harry didn’t care. Hallucination-Draco wouldn’t judge him.
“I’m sorry, Pans,” Draco apologized. “What were you saying?”
Weasley shook himself then. “Sorry. Never expected to hear you being polite to a house elf, let alone a free one.”
“This should be enough to start with,” Draco said, explaining his criteria for filtering the memories. Harry nodded along, his eyes still watching the swirling strands. “We can go back for more later if you need them or decide on a different criteria.”
which was just unheard of.
Potter shook his head slowly.
“Blimey, Harry,” he said. Harry stood to accept his embrace.

“Horrible, I know,” Ron finished for him. “You would

he realized.
“Ah, you’re trying to quit again,” Potter mutters. Draco hears him lean against the wall, the rustle of his old leather jacket against stone, the sizzle of the end of the cigarette as Potter lights it for himself.
returned Draco’s smile, and it made Draco feel like his chest was glowing. He grasped Draco’s hand firmly, shaking it gently. “When you’re able,” Draco smirked, “please call me Draco.”
“Close your eyes,” Draco ordered quietly. Harry raised his eyebrows, but did as he was told.
“Okay, it’s coming up,” Draco murmured, spotting a slight glow on the edge of his vision, keeping his reactions carefully tucked away. “Here we go—”
“Ah,” Draco said, tipping his chin down. “You were praised for your own achievement, and not for the gnarly scar on your head?” Draco clarified, a wry grin on his face.
Potter watched him thoughtfully, but thankfully did as he was told. After a few bites, he was steadily improving. He was blinking normally, though still watching Draco carefully, and according to the monitor charm above his bed, his heart rate was evening out. His breathing slowed, and Draco released the tension in his own shoulders.
Camila tsked at him, so shockingly similar to her mother that Draco raised his eyebrows at her. “You’re not supposed to ask
Draco’s heart broke a little. He knew Harry hated that word.
“Do you see it?” Draco asked. Ron looked back at him, brows furrowed in thought. He nodded, took Draco’s elbow, and pulled them out of the Pensieve.

“How do you know?” Ron asked. Malfoy lifted his head, looking suddenly exhausted.
Draco retreated slowly, as calmly as he could. He could definitely see why Harry’s mind chose

but he never wanted it to end, even with the twists of warning starting in his stomach.
what you did to me, what I went through—”
He climbed off, settling onto his side on the blanket, head propped up on one elbow, watching Draco with a satisfied smile on his face. Draco couldn’t look at him directly, his heart was already racing dangerously. He looked up at his magnolia tree instead, admiring the golden light filtering through the thin branches, furrowing his brows in thought.
“Eurgh, please,
Apparently satisfied with his checks, he handed the bottle back to Draco, who quickly went ahead and broke the wax seal, uncorked it, and dumped the entirety of its contents down his throat. It felt like viscous, lukewarm water in his mouth, and Draco could feel it taking effect immediately. He squeezed his eyes shut, hopelessly trying to stop it, but he felt high, now, and it only made him feel more sick, and more panicked. Merlin, he had never planned on using that potion on himself, he’d only thought it would be helpful for a cursed patient someday. He was astonished at himself, at the lengths he would go to for this
Harry’s face was serious, but he gave a tentative nod. Draco decided to move on.
“You don’t have to keep watching me, you know,” Harry muttered, sitting on the sofa and helping her with her speech. Her mouth twisted in anxiety.
she’d say. Auror corruption was probably something Ron hadn’t particularly tried to know about—at least, when he was eighteen, and it concerned someone he’d loathed. Draco was sure things must be quite different now, under Ron’s quintessentially Gryffindor leadership.
Draco was successful, apparently, because Harry picked up his notebook and pen, opening it to a blank page to write.
influence—had Harry finally realized how manipulated he was, and confronted the Minister?
Draco kept his eyes closed, after that, his face pressed to Harry’s skin as they stripped each other down, then panting into Harry’s hair as Draco fucked him, their skin sticky with sweat and salt, their pleasured breaths indistinguishable from the rhythm of the sea.
Harry was laughing at him as they plopped down in their chairs, shaking his head at Draco’s false arrogance. He had spotted the
“Mhm.”
“Come along, Draco,” Lucius called, almost cheerfully, standing just outside the bars with his wand at the ready. Draco didn’t have time to react before his body was moving without him again, walking towards the bars without his consent, every muscle stiff and spasming in its fruitless struggle against the reins.
Draco bent over and picked up his wand from where he’d dropped it on the floor. He pointed it at the board, made yet another dot on the trail, and labeled it “Death”. Simple and succinct, there really wasn’t any way to make it look less morbid. He looked back at Harry, thinking, remembering.
Draco gently removed his wand from his jacket, and held it up in a loose, easy grip, pointing it at Potter’s forehead. He flinched minutely, but Draco caught the movement.
“That was familiar,” Draco said. “I felt the same way when I first held Camila. The weight of the responsibility, and the complete and utter joy of it—it feels like the most important thing you’ve ever done, the highest honour, to have such a special place in that child’s life. To add to your family. It’s wonderful, isn’t it?”
“How are we going to find the Unspeakables? No one knows who they are or what they look like,” Auror Bones asked.
He wondered what Draco would think. Had Draco ever found him handsome?
“Harry gave you
“Hello, Rose,” Draco uttered, keeping his body relaxed.
—but he kept his eyes on Rose, smiling gently.
Draco nodded again, eyes wide. “Sounds like something Old Voldy would do,” he said, surprising himself at the slip of the silly nickname. Harry’s lips quirked at it.
“Master Draco is putting the blooms in the kitchen, where Timsy is being arranging them for the house,” Timsy replied, looking at Draco meaningfully. The elf’s apparent hidden agenda eluded him, but Draco went along with it, as he usually did. He glanced at Harry, jerking his head toward the front door, and led him inside.
Draco shook his head, his lips twitching in amusement and disbelief. He glanced once more at Harry’s forehead—Harry looked even more confused, now. Draco knelt and started tracing the dots like a constellation on the chalkboard, in the pattern he really should have seen, because he knew it
He flung open the door. His heart stopped, joining his stomach on the floor.
Harry stood alone in the Pensieve room, staring blankly at his shelf for this assignment, which was slowly filling with memories.
Draco had barely fallen asleep when the Patronus appeared.
“Harry,” Draco said lightly, “you will explain to me what a blueblood is, and then you will explain to me why you neglected to mention that your muggle cousin is
Harry’s eyes were dancing with mirth, his shoulders shaking with his own silent laughter.
The Astronomical Clock was Harry’s favourite thing about Prague, other than trdelník. It was massive and intricate and beautiful, watching vigilantly over the Old Town Square. It reminded Harry of Hogwarts, of its ancient stone and the imposing clock in the courtyard that always seemed to chastise him for being late to class or out of bed past curfew. It reminded him of the vague-but-beautiful astrology of the centaurs, and the whirling instruments and telescopes of the astronomy tower—of a pale, terrified face, of an outstretched wand lowering an inch.
When Draco thought about all the things he didn’t know about Harry, all the things he’d been hoping to
Draco leaned forward on his hand and kissed Harry square on the mouth, surprising him.
Potter frowned, a little confused, but nodded his head in consent. He sat up, crossing his legs under himself on the bed, all of his attention reluctantly turned to Draco. It was a heady feeling. How many times had Draco vied for that attention in school? In the worst possible ways, of course. He blinked his way back to the present, where Potter was watching him and waiting for his expertise as a skilled Healer.
The Legilimency will be an utter nightmare without a basic semblance of trust.”
They spent the rest of the day finding Narcissa’s most-loved books, even using magic to look for fingerprints. Draco worked diligently, and Harry tried not to be distracted by the way his fingertips hovered over Narcissa’s traces.

He landed in Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, on the floor of his bedroom, right next to his waiting rucksack.
“Bet I can change your mind in less than ten minutes.”
Harry cast, as soon as the door clicked shut. Ron and Hermione looked at him sharply, questioning. He met each of their eyes, full of intent, hoping they knew him well enough to understand this.
“Harry, you asked me to keep the Aurors away from him—“
If you can’t handle that power, you shouldn’t have
Timsy waved his little hand dismissively and turned to walk out of the room, grumbling. He only ever
He opened his eyes and looked at Harry, who was watching him with a wary face, as if he had just been reminded of who Draco really was, which he had been. Draco continued rubbing his thighs, but the energy wouldn’t leave him. He stood up and began pacing back and forth in front of the window, occasionally shaking out his hands. Harry continued to watch.
What had happened was so peculiar, he’d never been shoved around like that while in someone’s head. Draco knew there were some parts of sixth year he hadn’t seen in Harry’s head, like the many times Draco knew Harry had been following him around, watching him. He’d had to work twice as hard just to avoid Harry, that year, but Harry always seemed to find him anyway—
Harry wanted him. Harry wanted him enough to take him out, to kiss him in his garden for hours. Harry wanted him more than he felt he needed to attend a Ministry War Memorial—Harry Potter
However, he wasn’t exactly eager to see Malfoy Manor again. He turned to Ron, hoping he could read the question in his eyes.
is it?” Draco muttered. “They got a seven year head start on their relationship. They got lucky, finding their soulmate at eleven, even though it took them ages to do something about it. You’ve been there, with them, the entire time. Notice that the first words Ron said after finding out his wife was pregnant, were ‘Merlin’s pants, Harry, I’m gonna be a dad’. You were as important a part of that moment as anything. You’re as integral a part of their lives as ever—that has not changed. They’d do anything for you. I mean, Ron Weasley threw out his pride to beg a
The room was silent for a minute as Ron and Hermione digested his words, coming down from their indignation to return to their seats on the sofa. Once again, it was Ron who broke the silence.
He breathed in sync with Harry, patient and silent, until every muscle in Harry’s body relaxed against him. Harry’s head tipped back onto Draco’s shoulder, providing a full view of the dazzling, resplendent moon and its glittering reflections on the dark waves.
Draco woke slowly, consciousness returning to him in small pieces. He became aware of something cold and hard beneath him, of the smell of old stone and potions ingredients. Then of the stiff soreness of every muscle in his body—then of the last thing he remembered, the indescribable pain of his bonds, Lucius’ voice above him—
Every Auror in the room looked grim and wary at the idea of Lucius Malfoy free from prison, and having help from inside the Ministry. They might not have fully agreed with Harry about Draco’s innocence, back then, but everyone could agree that Lucius was a real piece of work.
since Harry had last seen Malfoy, looking as exhausted and beaten down as Harry felt, walking out of the Ministry a free man with his returned hawthorn wand. He’d been too thin and too pale, a mere shadow of the smug, imperious, haughty boy Harry had clashed with for the entirety of his teenage years.

Harry was crushed by the sudden, overpowering feeling of
“Where did he go?” Draco asked, and Harry just shrugged.
Draco choked.
Harry’s face twisted in misery. He looked away from Draco, staring into the fireplace, but nodded eventually. Draco sighed deeply—that part of the work was over. Now, it was time to figure out that other breadcrumb he’d missed.
“Don’t work too hard, Draco, or I’ll hear about it from Timsy.”
Draco finally caught up, panting, and froze, taking in the incredible view. Harry looked back at him with an irrepressible grin, and it seemed to pull one out of Draco, too, regardless of his complaints. Draco ran a slender hand through his sweaty hair, sighing contentedly at the cool winds on his skin. He leaned back against a tree trunk—Harry knew he wasn’t a huge fan of heights.
“Thirteen,” Draco muttered. “We’ve found thirteen breadcrumbs, so far. Not bad.”
“What does it feel like?” Draco asked. “Getting struck by lightning.”
It had been five days of this.
“What? What is it?” Harry asked anxiously. Smith glanced at him, then rolled his eyes arrogantly.
“They have.” Willem nodded. His cheeks were a little pink, maybe from the wind. “It was quick, I’ll say that much.”
thanks, mate.” Ron tore open the deli paper like it was Christmas morning, groaning in contentment as he took an indecently large bite. He closed his eyes in bliss, chewing with no regard for anyone else’s sensibilities. Harry grimaced, but couldn’t help feeling fondly amused. It was almost like being back in the Great Hall.
“Yeah, what else is new?” Harry grumbled, keeping a careful eye on the library door.

“How long you been here?”
“Well, start writing,” Draco snapped.
“I am,” Harry croaked, his feet rooted to the floor as Draco’s hands raised, timidly, hesitating just over Harry’s arms—then lowered again as he warred with himself.
a conscious decision on both parts. Draco continued ignoring the pain—the reward was far too great.
“Would’ve done, too, if Timsy had taken a minute longer doing Legilimency on Harry, and Harry hadn’t realized what was happening and thrown Bubble-Head Charms on all of us,” Ron said, with a mouthful of curry and rice. Draco didn’t even flinch at his lack of manners, too filled with shock, staring at Harry with wide eyes.
“The fuck was that for?”
Draco sighed in contentment. He turned up the volume dial a little to hear it over the loud rush of the rain. Harry grinned at him.
He licked his lips briefly, and Draco’s eyes tracked the movement, to his delight. Draco made him feel so powerful. Draco made him feel incredible. He felt
He stayed there with his hand on the doorknob until he felt the wobble of the wards, then released a long breath, the work of the day finally catching up with him. He felt drained, emotionally, physically, magically.
“It feels better when I steal them,” Draco said again, too loud. “It’s a—ferret thing. I think. I don’t know. But I may not stop.” Underneath him, Harry shook with laughter he was clearly trying yet utterly failing to suppress.
Harry was horrified by the tear that fell down his own cheek. “I’m sorry,” he rasped, because that part, he was sorry for.
“Let me pretend—”
“Their own,” Kingsley shrugged. “Have been for centuries.” Draco just stared at him in disbelief.
Harry nearly broke his neck trying to jog down the stairs while buttoning his trousers, but it didn’t matter because he was running late and Robards wouldn’t care that he arrived broken and bloody if he was still
“The short answer is that it didn’t feel right, to use it for healing,” Draco decided. “I still have it, but it’s put away.” Harry tilted his head to the side, another question on his open face.
“Honestly, Ron,” she rolled her eyes. “You’re assuming that Narcissa would be in any of the circles
Narcissa eventually blinked a few times and cleared her throat, collecting herself. She wasn’t able to keep the colour off her cheeks, though.
“It was just a rumour, of course, but he’s been in the public eye nearly every day for years—except for the last few weeks, hasn’t he? And as of almost a week ago, he’s finally returned to his duties, in perfect health,” she said, and Draco hoped all of this was rhetorical, because he couldn’t and wouldn’t answer.
She jerked her head at Harry.
The second he was within reach, Draco stopped pacing, grabbed him by the shirt, and pushed him back into the stone pillar.
He sat up and swung his legs over the side of the bed, padding over the hardwood floor on bare feet and making his way to the kitchen for some tea. Earl Grey, maybe. If he had any.
But he could stall.
“How many?”
But by the time he made it to the third floor landing, he couldn’t help but wonder if this was it, the tipping point. Things had been going so well for them, and it felt like everything had finally settled down after the general chaos of their elopement and Harry’s job and all the shit in the papers. They had a routine, and they’d found their own little peace, and Harry had gone and mucked it all up by causing a scene in the DMLE—
It was all real, and it wasn’t. The real was stretched, tweaked, until it filled a sufficient amount of time. With great effort, he wove it all into a single thread and pulled it out of his head. His forehead broke out in sweat, his hand shook as he dropped the handmade memory into the mouth of the vial.
Draco sighed deeply. This made absolutely no sense.
Ron asked, conveying all of their displeasure.
“Be safe, boy,” he muttered. He released Harry’s shoulder to gently brush Narcissa’s hair off her cheek, his face softening with tenderness. “You’ve done a good thing.”
Harry’s face was lit up with fondness—Draco didn’t know to whom it was being directed, but it didn’t matter. He was just happy to have brought Harry joy, to have shared something of himself that he actually
Distantly, he felt a petite, warm hand on his shoulder, keeping him upright as Timsy worked.
Harry sagged with relief, tugging Hermione into his arms. She squeezed him back, her face in the shoulder of his Unspeakable robes.
“Calm down, Harry.” She swished her wand at her own head; her hair tied itself away from her face in a neat ponytail. She turned back to Narcissa and started murmuring spells, making quiet sounds of thought and frustration.
Draco mirrored her grin, but he reached his right hand out toward his mother, first. Narcissa wrapped her slender hands around his, her expression tortured. She looked as exhausted as the rest of them.
Harry was sitting in a hard, wooden chair next to his bed, holding Draco’s hand spread in his own, carefully tracing the lines of his palm with his fingers.
Would Harry even believe him?

“Oh, really? You write ‘Harry Potter is a git’ all the time?”

It wasn’t as calming as the
“The Unspeakables,” Harry answered calmly. He’d promised answers. “It wasn’t safe, for either of you.”
Malfoy floundered for a moment while Harry regarded the shrubs and flowers growing by the door, probably with magical assistance, considering the season. Roses, Harry thought, climbing a trestle against the house. They were dark and dormant, tangled amongst the wood and stone, patiently waiting for spring.
“It’s tougher than most.”

by patient confidentiality?” she asked tentatively.
Draco grinned. “The cold, marble ballroom of Malfoy Manor, of course,” he replied. “Most of the ‘pureblood nobility’ are trained in ballroom dancing before we’re old enough to go to school. Dance was a part of my lessons—I had several private tutors, before Hogwarts. Between them and my mother, I could not escape adolescence without knowing how to dance. Thank Merlin it was at least fun, though you’d never hear me admit it, as a kid.”
“Because you’re a cretinous slob who wouldn’t know efficiency and order if it kicked him in the head,” Draco replied loftily, taking a sip of his tea and pretending to read the newspaper. Pretending, Harry knew, because Draco only subscribed for the crosswords. Harry narrowed his eyes, huffing a wayward lock out of his face.
“I’m sorry for doubting you. I haven’t needed a wand.”

Pansy slides drink number four across the table, floating empty drink number three back to the bar. Draco sighs, and picks it up, grimacing at the stickiness on the bottom of the glass. At the bar, this week’s loser has his finger hooked into the belt loop on Potter’s ghastly muggle jeans. Draco feels sick. He can’t bring himself to take a sip.
the Wizarding World. ‘Speak only for yourself,’ I believe, is what they’d invoked. Harry’s subconscious mind then obeyed, and created a trail of breadcrumbs to follow, of what he had decided—unconsciously—were his most formative memories, the ones that shaped who Harry really is. We’re a bit over halfway through the trail, now.”
Draco gripped it with trembling hands, sniffling again. He stared at it for a long moment, then flicked his wand, tossing his
Harry felt warmth return to his limbs as he ate, the tingling feeling left his fingers and toes. His breathing slowed, and he saw Malfoy’s shoulders release the tension they held, apparently satisfied with Harry’s improvement. Harry was still struck by the fact that Draco Malfoy had just made him feel better, without even thinking twice about it.
“Do you wanna see my new scrunchies?” Harry asked, his voice muffled in Draco’s shirt. Draco shivered—
Draco bit his lip, suppressing a wild grin, but he was sure Harry could still see it in his eyes. Harry’s smile only grew. His eyes darted to Draco’s lips, and suddenly Draco was pushed onto his back, giddy laughter bubbling up from his throat as Harry threw his leg over him, boxing him in against the ground. Draco beamed up at him, subtly glancing at his own fingers as they ran up Harry’s powerful arms, counting them, just to be sure. This entire day felt unreal.

“You really have been too busy,” he muttered dryly. “We can talk about it later, if you want—I did way too much research, as a terrified, gay teenager.

Draco was only a little surprised that that duel wasn’t a breadcrumb—but then again, dueling Voldemort was old hat to Harry Potter. It was simply something he had to do, at that point. He had just died, after all. Dueling must have seemed a chore, after that.
