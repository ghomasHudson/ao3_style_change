“Do you want to tell me about what happened last night?” Harry whispered, pressing his lips to Draco’s temple. Carding his fingers through his blond hair, Harry gently kissed his way down Draco’s face to his jaw, craning his head to reach Draco’s neck, burying his face there. He felt Draco’s deep breath as his smaller chest moved against his own.
“Oh good, you’re finally here, Hermione,” Ron complained, “Now Harry can tell us all about this new fellow he’s met.”
Draco hadn’t known what to do, at that moment. His mind had just blanked. He’d known, subconsciously, that Harry had been in relationships before. He’d
A woman abruptly appeared from behind a shelf of canvases, no older than twenty, her curly red hair messily tied back in a high ponytail, a paint-splattered apron wrapped around her slender hips. There were a few smears of paint on her grey t-shirt and on her thin, pretty face. The nametag on her shirt read
Crashing their lips together, Draco couldn’t have cared less that he had become one of those teenagers who made out with their boyfriend in his car. Not as Harry’s tongue brushed against his own, or as he sucked Draco’s bottom lip in his mouth, or as his hand tightened on his ass.
Draco had basically grabbed Harry’s face and pulled him down to cover his mouth with his own. Harry seemed to freeze before he realized that Draco was kissing him. It took
Saturday, because now I have other after-school activities that I can't miss, and I would rather not have to keep going on hiatus. I might switch back, if I do I'll let all of you know.
,” Draco interrupted, gently but firmly. Those anxious green eyes snapped up to look at him, slight surprise in their depths. “First of all, you shouldn’t have to hide or avoid talking about your past just to accommodate others. It
But then he’d come to Hogwarts, and everything was so much different. Everyone told Harry how amazing his parents had been; his father was a bit of a rebel, always living in the grey area and causing mischief in his wake. And then James had fallen for Lily, the straight-A student who was kind to everyone. He was told of how in love they were, how they were perfect for each other in every way. Professor McGonagall had told him that after they graduated, his father worked with the government, and his mother had been attending medical school to become a nurse—until they’d had Harry and she’d had to put her studies on hold to take care of him.
“Why would you disappoint me?” Harry hesitantly asked. His heart gradually settled in his chest as he wound himself down. His lungs slowly remembered how to breathe properly again as Draco’s thumbs rubbed circles into his palms.
The sounds of bustling players permeated the air inside the locker rooms, buzzing with a concoction of excitement and anxiety. They’d been preparing for this football game all week, practicing every day, and running rigorous drills. Harry looked on as Fred and George got told off by Katie, shaking his head and grinning. Her glare was furious but her lips quirked into a smile at the corners while she swiftly braided back her brown hair. Luckily for the girls—and everyone else in either of the locker rooms—the stink bomb the twins had planted in the girl’s half of the room had been faulty.
Both Draco and Harry’s heads whipped around to look at the source of the intruding voice—none other than Lucas Ferreira himself, walking towards them. Draco immediately felt his hackles rise. Up close, he could see that Ferreira was, unfortunately,
Ron’s face was practically the same shade of red as his hair. His eyes were stone cold and unremorseful, his hands clenched on the armrests of the chair he was sitting on in the common room. Hermione’s eyes went wide, and Harry’s mouth dropped open, his brow furrowed. A sharp breath that almost seemed like a laugh came out of Harry’s mouth, his face was contorted with disbelief.
“But Harry… he has a hard time letting people in. And it’s going to be hard for him, letting you in and telling you everything. Just be patient with him, please, he’s doing the best he can.” Draco was staring intently at his boyfriend’s face. Harry’s face was so peaceful, so at odds with Hermione’s words. “He didn't grow up the way that you and I were, with parents that loved and cared about us, Draco.”
Draco knew exactly what thoughts were running through his boyfriend’s head, but he couldn’t decide whether to try and stop him or help him throttle the red-headed idiot.
Draco nodded. His face fell like he already knew where Harry was going with this. His pale fingers tightened on Harry’s, encouraging him to go on.
Cold fingers released Harry’s hair and trailed down to the pulse point at his neck—like Draco was just feeling the rhythm of his heart.
Draco finally felt Harry’s chest movements begin to slow. Though it was still too shallow and fast to be considered calming, Draco would take what successes he could.
Draco had been uneasy since Harry had left him standing there in the hall. Harry had looked so angry, angrier than he had looked when Draco had talked to him in the changing rooms before he apologized to Hermione.
“Are you going to make him carry you inside, as well?” Hermione questioned with a sly smile. With a sarcastic laugh, Draco huddled into Harry’s side and walked through the door to Suzanne’s Sushi. The rest of them followed. Inside, it looked almost like a coffee house crossed with a restaurant, it had the same cozy air. It was a surprisingly nice place. The walls were painted in color blocks of black, white, orange, and green. There were tables scattered around, little flower vases filled with purple blossoms placed in the center of each. The place was buzzing with the noise of people, not exactly busy but enough to keep the staff occupied.
He turned to Harry, his smile softer and relaxed. “Harry,” his voice was gentle and affectionate, it made Harry’s heart ache and his lungs stutter against his will, “I miss you. I’ll… um, I’ll see you around.”
And there we are! I love getting comments and hearing from you guys! Kudos are pretty cool too, but like, comments give me life, sooo... I hope you all enjoyed this!
Snuffles couldn’t seem to decide which was more important—licking every inch of Harry’s face, or trying to tackle him. Sirius laughed behind him as the dog finally seemed to decide that doing both was the way to go. His forelegs came around Harry’s shoulders, his panting, warm breath fanning over his face while his tongue frantically licked him all over.
By the time the plane landed in London, Harry and Draco had woken up a few unhappy passengers around them with their laughter and constant talking. Harry had learned that they were both heading to the same boarding school, and it was a tragedy that they hadn’t run into each other before then. Harry had asked Draco if he wanted to take a taxi together, and to his strangling relief, Draco’s eyes had lit up when he said yes.
Harry turned back to the table behind him, where Neville’s beaker was smoking an almost orange color, which definitely shouldn’t have been happening. Neville looked as frustrated as ever, staring down at the instructions on his paper with his hands in his hair. “Here, Neville, you just have to add this to the beaker, it’ll cancel out whatever it is you did wrong,” Harry said softly, with a look that told Neville he was sorry for almost setting Snape on him. He handed Neville a small vial full of opaque grey liquid.
“Do you want to go out with me?” Harry interrupted, the words having leaped from his mouth without his own consent. The adrenaline was still rushing through his veins, his chest was heaving with hard breaths.
“I love you,” Harry whispered to him, pressing it into his skin with his kisses, “It’s impossible, how much I love you.”
The smile that crept on Draco’s face was overflowing with tenderness and love for this boy. “Of course I’ll stay,” he whispered back, “though at this rate I think that I may as well move in.”
When Harry’s fingers dipped beneath the waistband of Draco’s jeans, he let out an embarrassingly loud moan, prompting Harry to kiss him harder, like he was trying to swallow the sounds and memorize every millimeter of his mouth, inside and out. He nipped Draco’s bottom lip with his teeth, then licked over the bite like he was soothing an imaginary pain. Draco could feel pleasure dripping down every nerve in his body, he was drowning in sensation, he was on fire, a fire that Harry had breathed to life.
“You’re more help than you think,” Hermione whispered to him. Draco felt pressure building behind his eyes, but it wasn’t enough to make him cry. He just held her tighter.
Hermione looked down at her hands as she replied, “We had a bit of what you could call, a falling-out, this morning. He’ll come around, though.” Draco nodded in understanding, he’d had more than his fair share of fights with his friends in past years.
Ron stopped a few feet away from Harry, his hands shoved into his pockets, his blue eyes scanning the face of each person that had fanned out to stand on either side of Harry before settling on the man himself. Concentrating on taking deep, even breaths, Harry met his gaze. The contempt that Harry had grown familiar to seeing there was strangely absent, the scorn and condescension that had grown in place of their friendship appeared to have withered.
deal was. The only thing running through his head was that this boy had hurt Hermione, that this boy that had wormed his way into Harry’s head so thoroughly, had hurt his best friend.
“I’ll stay with you if you don’t want to go. I’m sure that Professor Vector will let you make up the quiz some other time, and I don’t think we’re doing anything important in History today,” Harry tried. He felt positive that if she took the quiz now, she wouldn’t be able to do her best work as usual.
Harry whipped around to look at the Weasley twins, who were both sporting devilish, wicked grins on their freckled faces. “Party?”
A nearly undignified squeak came from Draco’s lips, barely quiet enough to not wake the others in the room. “I do
Though it was completely inappropriate at the time, Draco couldn’t help but feel amused at how dwarfed Hermione was by Harry. Her head came to just below his shoulder, now barely more than a foot shorter than him.
for you. You don’t have to be strong all the time, or put up a front to cover up what you’re feeling.”
“That’s amazing!” Blaise was smiling like a lunatic. Pansy gave Draco one last squeeze before she disentangled herself from the three boys, yawning. “I’m not supposed to be here in the first place, but all of this is amazing Draco. And you’re not allowed to leave for that date without telling me first!” Pansy stopped at the doorway, sending them one last smile before she left for the girls’ dormitories.
not to be a stranger? What was your deal in the hallway?” Draco fired questions like bullets, he could feel his chest constricting with each one, his anger giving way to fear of what Harry might say. Or do.
Draco grunted. “Not good enough.” His pale, cold fingers slipped under Harry’s shirt, sliding up the toned lines of his lower stomach. The sensation never failed to send tingles down Harry’s spine, goosebumps erupting on his skin, and a rush of a cool sort of warmth through his veins. Draco’s lips shifted down to his neck, pressing a kiss there. Harry tilted his head to give him better access, his eyes flickering shut and a soft smile spreading on his lips at the gentle manner in which Draco proceeded to kiss him.
Harry had had a smile on his face throughout all his Monday morning classes. Dinner on Saturday evening had made everything just that much better. Draco had brought his friends to sit with him and Hermione, and everything had been perfect. Even when Harry had caught Ron glaring at all of them from down the table, Harry just intertwined his fingers with Draco’s under the table and watched him as he talked excitedly with his friends; he’d even talked to Hermione on more than one occasion. Draco’s hand was a little cold, but Harry didn’t mind.
“Remember what I said this morning?” Harry whispered to her. “You’ll be okay, I promise. I’ll be back on Monday, and you can call or text me anytime, okay? I’m here for you.”
“Draco! That’s not what I meant,” Harry snorted. “I just meant sleeping, you dirty-minded scoundrel.”
And there was the laugh again, the one that always made Draco want to laugh with him, to be let in on the joke. Turning around his eyes met Harry’s with nothing but affection in his gaze.
Harry scoffed, “We? No, Draco, I asked you out. I’m paying.” A smile split his lips as he ushered Draco inside. The smell hit him like a wall as soon as he crossed the threshold, his eyes closed as he tried to take everything in.
“Boys, this is most certainly not the place for these activities. So, unless you plan on putting your brains to use, I suggest you leave.”
Ron’s eyes narrowed, Draco could see his body tense. “That’s my room too, and Harry needs me more than he’ll ever need you.”
Walking into the room, he saw that Hermione had seemingly left; Harry was curled alone on the bed with his eyes closed, but somehow Draco knew that he wasn’t asleep. He closed the door behind him and toed off his shoes before sitting on the edge of the bed, next to his boyfriend.
The waitress that greeted them had a pretty, heart-shaped face, shiny black hair pulled into a messy ponytail, and brown skin only a shade or two darker than Harry’s. Her black eyes immediately caught on him, looking him up and down, a satisfied smile pulling at her full, glossed lips. She finally noticed Draco stuck to his side and immediately looked away from both of them, instead choosing to look at Theo. A smug feeling spread in Draco’s chest.
So just as some useful information, I've been trying so hard to stick to my updating-every-two-weeks schedule, but now with everything that's been happening in my life, updates might be a little more off-schedule. I'm going to try as hard as I can to keep on top of everything, but there's so much going on that it's harder than ever.
“I met Cedric about a month before I turned sixteen,” Harry began in a soft voice. “We had both dated this girl, Cho Chang. She’s a year older than us, in Cedric’s year. That’s kind of how we found each other. We dated for a couple months—five, maybe six, I don’t really remember. But during the last month, he’d started acting strange. I couldn’t pinpoint what it was, still can’t, but something was off. I found out he’d been sleeping with Cho, walked in on them in his dorm. He tried to get out of it, tried to convince me not to break up with him, all that stuff. But I just… I couldn’t be with him anymore. I’ve barely talked to him since then.”
With slow strides, Harry walked beside Draco, towing his boyfriend’s wheeled luggage bag behind him and his green and silver duffle bag slung over his shoulder and occasionally glancing at him. Draco’s face was a torrent of mixed signals. His brows were drawn together, his eyes were stony and closed off, and his nose tended to twitch every and again. And yet, there was the smallest of smiles—minuscule, really—on his lips, and Harry could see that just behind the frigid wall in his eyes, there was a flicker of light.
Draco ignored the hesitancy flourishing in his heart and walked over; he climbed into Harry’s lap and curled up in his arms. He could have sobbed when Harry wound his strong arms around him, leaning back against the wall to support both their weights. He felt so unworthy of the warm comfort Harry offered. His heart ached and throbbed and his soul felt utterly wrecked, but it eased when Harry kissed his hair and then fit Draco’s head under his chin.
Do I sense a new pet-name for Draco? I think I do. I hope you all liked it! Comments give me life, for real, so leave one! Like, seriously, I get all tingly and happy inside when I see that I have comments, so do it!
He somehow managed to tear his eyes away from the gateway to paradise to look at the boy who had brought him to it.
Where he hadn’t really seemed to be paying attention before, Harry jolted upright. Draco quickly got the message and scrambled off of his boyfriend’s lap. His knees ached from being sat in the same position for so long, but the concerned look on Harry’s face and the uneasy feeling in his chest made him ignore it.
“Is that so?” Sirius asked, a new light in his eyes. Remus perked up at his curious tone, setting his phone down and finally tuning in to the conversation. “What mediums do you use?”
The sound of footsteps came from just outside the bathroom door. The door creaked open again and Harry entered, his arms loaded with Draco’s bathroom bag, product bottles, soaps, and everything in between. He carefully set everything down on the floor by the bathtub before he sat on the ledge behind Draco. He kept his gaze firmly on Draco’s face.
Harry’s father had been Indian, his mother had been white. And Harry looked so much like his father, his skin only a few minuscule shades lighter. If Draco knew that Harry himself was biracial, what horrible things would he say about him, if he could say those things about Hermione? Hermione, who had always been there for Harry, and who was possibly the smartest, kindest person he knew. Hermione, who was always willing to help anyone struggling in class.
“The second after you left, Harry’s ex-boyfriend Cedric Diggory showed up,” Draco seethed, “I think he wants to get back together with Harry. He was totally all up in Harry’s business, he tried to hold his hand! When he left, he told Harry that he missed him.”
“I don’t know, I just…” The shattered look in Harry’s eyes made Draco’s lungs stutter. An influx of something sorrowful and relieved and painful surged inside of him. It filled his veins and buried deep in his bones, like needles poking into his skin.
Draco smirked, recovering from his moment of self-doubt. “What a fancy way to tell me you think I’m pretty.”
Draco had already asked his boyfriend what was wrong, had already asked if he’d wanted to talk about it, but Harry had deflected and smoothly changed the course of conversation each time the matter was brought up. For all Harry’s insistence that he was fine, Draco was a little hesitant to press the issue. He didn’t want to cross a boundary that he had yet to find. He didn’t want to pressure Harry into talking if he wasn’t ready.
Boredom rolled over Draco in unrelenting waves as he listened to Professor Binns drone on about whatever it was he’d been lecturing about for the past hour. He hadn’t cared enough to pay attention to any of it. Hopefully, Draco could get notes from Hermione before he had this class again.
A waitress came to their table and took their orders. Harry wasn’t the least bit surprised to hear Draco say that he didn’t want anything, but he also knew when his boyfriend was lying—and that he hadn’t eaten since the night before. Harry had tried getting him to eat that morning, but Draco had insisted he couldn’t. So, instead, Harry just ordered a large coffee and a blueberry muffin—he expected that Draco would start stealing his food any minute. And he was more than okay with that.
The blond had fallen asleep on Harry’s shoulder once again, and Harry could only hope that this would be the second time of many to come as he gently played with Draco’s fingers, laying his head on top of Draco’s to fall asleep as well.
When Draco looked up, Harry’s eyes were sparkling, and there was a daring smile set upon his lips. Those lips that Draco couldn’t seem to stop glancing at.
“Do you want to come and sit with me at dinner?” Harry asked in a soft voice as if he was reluctant to make too much noise and break the silence. Draco could feel the grin splitting his face as he replied, “I would love that.”
Harry woke with his eyes still closed and every muscle in his body tight and unrelenting, sharply inhaling and clenching his fingers in the sheets. The rhythm of his breaths stuttered, his heartbeat was frantically hectic. Whatever memory of his dream—
Harry’s fingers gently smoothed the conditioner through his hair, combing out any knots. A different sort of ease came over Draco, more peaceful and soothing. Neither of them had said much, but Draco didn’t feel a need to. He just tilted his head back and leaned into his boyfriend’s hands.
Harry’s grin was practically invincible. Seeing Sirius, Remus, and Draco talk and laugh together was everything Harry never knew he wanted. Or
“And why exactly did you pull me out here?” Mock agitation laced Draco’s voice as he tried to keep a smile off his face.
A warm feeling blossomed in the pit of Harry’s stomach, spreading all the way to his fingertips. “Everything’s… okay. A little bumpy, but we’re okay.” Harry took this moment to look down at Draco. His eyes were downcast, his pink lips were pulled into a small frown, and his pert nose was slightly crinkled. A charged, tense air surrounded him.
After a second’s hesitation, he felt Harry’s fingers card through his hair. The soothing sensation eased the ache in his chest, if only by a little.
Draco’s hands came up, palms facing Harry as if trying to calm an animal. “Of course I remember. Harry, please, let me explain.” Draco’s grey eyes were pleading with him, and his pale face was contorted in a mixture of guilt and fear. “Please.”
him.” The fingers in his hair receded. “I’m completely and pathetically in love with him. And he loves me, too.”
“Hmm…” Hermione remained attached to his hip even as they turned into a less crowded corridor on their way to their common room. “Maybe you should ask Sirius this weekend.”
Harry scowled at his godfather’s suggestively laughing smirk and Remus’ embarrassed eyes. “Not like that, you
The only reply Draco gave was a nod before leaning forward and pressing his lips to Harry’s. The kiss was slow and careful; Harry was afraid that if he pushed too hard, Draco might shatter in his hands. He felt one of Draco’s icy hands delve into his loose tank top, splaying over his broad shoulder. Harry could taste the salt of their tears on Draco’s lips. The tender, soft glide of Draco’s mouth against his own made goosebumps rise on his skin and cool affection and fondness pool in the pit of his stomach.
“Where are you going?” he whined, dragging his nose up the column of Harry’s neck, kissing behind his ear. Draco’s fingers dug into the muscle on his chest, his lips moved from his ear to reach around to his face.
Harry knew full well that Draco had seen the expanse of scars on his back. He knew that his boyfriend had questions about where they came from, how he’d gotten them. Why he hadn’t explained them sooner. It had been slowly eating at him, keeping what was probably the biggest part of his past from the boy he loved. But he just hadn’t been ready.
The room was spinning. Or maybe it was Draco. He couldn’t really tell. He knew he was a lightweight, so he hadn’t drunk nearly as much as Harry—they were both just slightly past the tipsy stage. The music sounded fuzzy, the bodies dancing around them were just slightly blurry. But that might’ve just been his lack of focus. Or caring.
Harry hummed in response, satisfied that he wasn’t the only one. He placed a kiss to the hollow of Draco’s throat and then rested his forehead on his shoulder, relishing the familiarity of Draco’s embrace. His lean arms held Harry close. His fingers brushed against his skin in random shapes. His lips pressed against his forehead, his hair, his temple. His heartbeat was strong and comforting.
“Potter, whatever happens out there, you’ll do me proud.” Harry heard the words, but they seemed to bounce off his heart, echoing around his chest until they were twisted, crooked, mangled, unrecognizable. Instead, he heard,
Summary: Harry has a sort of flashback dream of his Uncle Vernon beating him, and he wakes up sick and has to run to the bathroom before, well, you know. After that, Draco cleans him up, and Harry tells him about how he got his scars and he was abused as a child, until Sirius got custody of him and took him to therapy and helped him through the brunt of it. Then there's some kind of sad fluffy stuff.
“For being here,” Harry closed his eyes and entwined his fingers with Draco’s, “even after I ran away from you.”
at his boyfriend. Taking in his gorgeous grey eyes—alight with the energy of the game, the sharp angles of his cheekbones, the defined lines of his jaw, the wide smile on his pink lips, the flush in his cheeks that crept up to his ears, the growing crinkle in his pert nose…
He couldn’t even find it within himself to laugh. Pansy pulled away and looked at him with concern in her dark eyes. He wished that she could talk to Harry for him. He didn’t want anyone else talking to Harry, at the same time.
When Harry’s eyes fluttered open, all quiet conversation between Draco and Hermione ceased. They had been talking for the past hour while Harry slept, about classes, school, home life. Draco had managed to avoid trying to pry information about his boyfriend, knowing full well that Hermione was more stubborn than he was. She was like a mule.
Harry pulled away from the kiss only to start peppering them over Draco’s face. First his forehead, then his cheeks and nose and everywhere else. “Are you sure?” he asked. “You want this?”
Harry watched Sirius and Remus walk away as he opened the driver’s side door to his car and got in, hoping that he really
Driving safely was truly a feat for Harry when Draco was sitting right next to him. Especially with the way he traced shapes on Harry’s palm, the serene expression on his face, the slight dampness of his braided hair.
He missed the warmth of Harry’s presence. His smile, his laugh. His body. Draco’s mind continually drifted to the feeling of being wrapped up in his boyfriend, being curled together with him and tangled in his sheets; he’d snuck some of Harry’s clothes with him just to get some remnant of that feeling—his football hoodie, a few t-shirts, a pair of sweatpants, all of which were ridiculously big on him—though he had a sneaking suspicion that Harry knew.
He could feel the blush spreading to his neck as he remembered the night that his hands had dived under Harry’s shirt to touch him, to try and get closer to him and feel more of him.
Draco’s mouth went dry, his face felt so hot he was certain he could cook an egg on it. The black-haired boy was even more handsome than at first glance, with a roguish jaw and a twisted smile to his lips, Draco could barely string words together:
Blaise, Theo, and Pansy were all piled on top of each other on the couch facing theirs, while Hermione was seated on the floor near Harry’s knees. A companionable sort of stillness filled the atmosphere around them, almost like a bubble had surrounded their little group. Pansy was testing her newfound skills on Blaise’s hair—more difficult to braid thanks to the shortness of it, but that didn’t stop her attempts. Theo was chatting with Hermione about the football tryouts that had taken place two days previous, which he had decided to participate in—if only to ensure that Cedric didn’t make the team.
“You came back,” he muttered. Laying down, facing his boyfriend, Draco kissed Harry’s forehead and snuggled into him.
“How long?” Theo repeated, his voice low and dangerous. His eyes practically glowed red with all the anger that raged in their depths. He knelt in front of her, his hands clenched into tight fists.
The door abruptly opened, causing Harry to jump slightly. Draco didn’t even seem to notice. Harry looked over his boyfriend’s slumbering body, only to see Ron walking into the dormitory. Sharing a room with him had been incredibly tense ever since he’d blown up at Harry. They hadn’t said a word to each other, going out of their way to stay out of each other’s way, avoiding the other at all costs. Harry knew it was hard on the other boys in their room, Dean and Seamus, but he couldn’t bring himself to talk to Ron. About anything. He could barely get words to form in his head when he looked at Ron, let alone get them out of his mouth.
“Dray,” Harry began, his voice threaded with cool and balance, “baby, of course, I want to have sex with you. Of course I want you. I want to give you absolutely all of me. I love you, and I want to be with you in every way that you’ll let me.”
Harry felt the tension rising like strings were pulling at his heart, knocking it around in his chest. So instead, Harry turned to Mrs. Malfoy with what he hoped was a pleasant enough expression on his face and offered her his hand.
“Then explain to me how he’s been happier since he stopped talking to you. Explain how he didn’t go to you, he didn’t ask for you, he didn't even wonder where you were. If he needs you so badly, why haven’t you been there?”
“Of course I do. You wouldn’t tell us who it was,” Harry recalled. Of course, he remembered that day. She had come to their common room in tears, and Harry and Ron tried to comfort her for a few hours before she told them what had happened. She seemed to know that if she told them who had done it, Harry and Ron may have gotten themselves expelled by beating the arsehole until he was an unrecognizable lump of flesh.
Ronald nodded sharply. “Yeah… Well, goodnight then, I guess.” He turned and walked into the bathroom without another word.
“That,” Harry said, lifting the first of the weights onto the bar, “and a hand putting the weights on the other side of the bar.”
. They meant that Harry intended to stay, to stick around. They meant that Draco was wanted, maybe even
He felt the blood rushing to his face, thanking the heavens above that his skin was dark enough to hide his embarrassment. He prayed that Draco would see through this.
Humming in response, Harry’s smile somehow grew even softer—it made Draco wish that he was there with him if only so he could trace that smile with his fingertips and feel his warmth. “You’re right. I’ve been meaning to bring it up, I just couldn’t really find an opening or the right time.” Even Harry shook his head at his own lame excuse. “Have you thought about… what you want?”
Okay, please don't kill me for the ending! I didn't really want the whole story to be OOC, you know? I'm planning on updating on Saturdays and Mondays, hopefully. Anyway, constructive criticism, comments, kudos, are all amazing! If you guys have any requests for fics, even from different fandoms, I would love to write one!
Though she nodded her head against his chest, her grip didn’t loosen, and the shaking in her shoulders only persisted.
Her eyes were puffy from tears, the tear-tracks still on her face. “It’s so stupid,” she whispered, her voice rough and cracking, “It’s so
“You too, Harry.” Joan turned back to Draco. “So, what brings you here after all these months? I was under the impression that you
Draco looked up at Harry through his lashes. His boyfriend was trying his hardest to keep his eyes on the road, but he kept glancing at Draco, a tender smile gracing his lips.
He had known about Hermione’s feelings for Ron for the past two years. He had also known that Ron was completely oblivious, and hadn’t ever considered Hermione. Being stuck in the middle wasn’t Harry’s favorite place to be, but he loved both of his friends, and he didn’t want to break the bonds that kept them together. Plus, Hermione had sworn him to secrecy the moment he’d asked her about it.
So the instant that Harry closed the trunk of the car, Draco dragged him into one of the car’s blindspots and wrapped his arms tightly around his boyfriend’s shoulders in a hug. He felt Harry’s arms come around his waist just as securely, steadying him so he didn’t have to reach up as high. Draco buried his face in Harry’s neck, trying to memorize the smell of him, the feel of his body against his own. Harry’s fingers dug into his back with how tight he was holding, and Draco couldn’t have cared less. He carded his fingers through his boyfriend’s soft, raven black hair and pulled back just far enough to plant a kiss on Harry’s mouth.
Harry had always made him feel validated and important. He’d never gotten truly angry or malicious, even when they fought. He’d never dismissed Draco or his feelings.
He was ready now. In hindsight, Harry didn’t know why he hadn’t said anything. Why he hadn’t told anyone what had been bothering him. He didn’t know why he bothered to bottle it inside him. It had never done him any good before. But now, he was ready to get everything off of his chest before it crushed him.
At the sound of his boyfriend’s—slightly hoarse—voice, Harry broke away from his team. Draco had run out onto the field with the brightest grin on his face, bundled up in warm clothes. Harry felt his heart racing even faster as he ran out to meet him in the middle, scooping up his boyfriend in his arms and swinging him around in a circle. The sound of Draco’s laughter made butterflies appear in Harry’s chest. (Even though his muscles ached, Harry couldn’t find it in himself to let go of Draco. Even though he was certain that he smelled like a barn animal in the peak of summer, he wanted to hold on to him. He wanted to share this moment with him, he wanted to share
He arrived at the library and weaved his way between the tables, chairs, and shelves until he caught sight of Harry, sitting at a table in the back, with his nose buried in a book. Draco slowed his pace so as not to appear too frantic. Harry seemed to have heard his steps and looked up, his glasses perched on his nose.
“Having sex with them?” Harry asked. A thread of uncertainty wound itself around his heart when Draco nodded his head. He quickly cut it as he reached out and tilted Draco’s head up by his chin. He remained silent until those beautiful grey eyes finally looked at him, the same uncertainty swirling in their depths.
Harry clutched Draco even tighter to his body. The images flashing through his head made his stomach plummet.
Perhaps it was the way that Harry intently stared at him with those gorgeously vibrant green eyes, or how he dragged his thumb across Draco’s bottom lip—but either way, Draco couldn’t resist pushing himself up and slanting his mouth over Harry’s, capturing his lips in a fervent kiss. Harry instantly responded in kind, gently biting at Draco’s bottom lip, something that made him gasp in pleasure every time. Everything in him was washed over in a wave of bliss. When Harry’s tongue swept against his own, Draco couldn’t help the whimpering moaning noise that sounded in the back of his throat. The hand that had been encased in Harry’s came up to rake through his dark, fluffy hair.
And Draco orgasmed so hard, so long, so nearly violently, that black spots danced across his vision. His back arched toward Harry, his whole body trembling with the force of it, and he clutched tightly at the boy above him, letting out a pathetically loud whimpering moan. It was a miracle he didn’t completely pass out.
If I'm being honest with y'all, I kind of just... gave up a little at the end, so it's not nearly as good as I'd wanted it to be, but I wanted to get this chapter updated asap. Anyway, leave me a comment! I love hearing from all my readers! *like seriously please do they make me so happy* Lots of love to everyone out there!
was Draco’s only thought as their whole group laughed, Draco could even feel Harry’s shoulders shaking next to him. Draco hid his face in his hands and practically hunched over himself.
Lifting one of his hands in surrender, Harry couldn’t help chuckling in return. “Nothing, I swear!” He gently grabbed Draco’s hand, twining their fingers together. “He’s just too polite for his own good.”
“I’m sorry,” he whispered gently. “I shouldn’t have shouted. I didn’t mean to startle you. I just don’t want you to think that. You couldn’t ever disappoint me, Harry. Or... disgust me, if that’s something you’re worried about.” Draco’s eyes held pure earnestness as they bore into Harry’s, a complete turn around from where he’d been moments ago. “I’m... more concerned that
Another thudding sound. Draco saw the laughter in Harry’s eyes, and it took everything in him to keep his own chuckles inside.
” he shrieked. The boy rushed forward as quickly as his legs would take him, the biggest smile Harry had ever seen on his face. With glee running through his veins, Harry scooped up the toddler, whirling him through the air and thoroughly enjoying the squealing laughter that burst from him. The extensive amount of energy Teddy had in his small body never failed to astound Harry.
Returning as fast as possible, Draco set his light on the couch before wrapping himself around Pansy again.
“Yeah, okay,” Hermione whispered. Harry kissed her forehead again before gingerly shifting her off of him and onto the couch as he stood up. “I’ll be right back, okay? I promise,” he stated in a firm but soft voice. She only nodded and squeezed his hand before he left for the kitchens.
“Yeah, of course I will,” Harry assured. Pressing one more kiss on his temple, Harry pulled away from Draco and started walking to the bathroom to pack the rest of his boyfriend’s things. But before he got very far, he heard a quiet, “Thank you” from behind him. A soft smile made its way onto Harry’s lips, even as he tried to quell the anxiety and uneasiness rising up in him.
Draco had in fact seen the incident Pansy was talking about and told her so. There’d been many of the same nature from the same player, over and over again. Lucas Ferreira, one of Castelobruxo’s forward players, seemed to have some sort of grudge against Harry—he’d already fouled on him twice and had come close to injuring him far too many times for Draco’s taste. Fortunately, Harry seemed attuned to Ferreira’s agenda against him and was able to avoid the majority of his moves and make a few goals in the process, without sustaining any serious injuries.
Hermione had noticed these same things about Harry, had asked the same questions, had received the same answers. But whenever Draco saw her looking at Harry, she always had the same analyzing glint in her dark eyes.
Draco handed him another glass he hadn’t seen before after he finished, which he guzzled without stopping. He heard Draco sigh through his nose, but he couldn’t bring himself to take smaller sips as he should have. The water settled his stomach, if only by a fraction.
Harry waited a moment for a reply to come, but when nothing appeared, he sighed in resignation, stashed his phone in his locker before grabbing his towel and turning on the shower water.
A delicate, tender smile shone on Draco’s face. If he hadn’t been sopping wet—not to mention naked, though he wasn’t sure he minded that part very much—he might’ve wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and peppered kisses all over his face.
Now, running his hand up and down Draco’s back, Harry asked, “Do you want to talk about it now, or in the morning, love?” He felt Draco bury his face in his chest, curling his arms around him and throwing one of his legs over Harry’s hips.
“I get it, love, I do.” Harry carded his fingers through his pale blond hair, rubbing lightly against his head. “It wasn’t fair of your father to spring this on you. But if anything, at least you get to see your mum a few days early.”
Draco was at his desk, a smile creeping over his face despite knowing that Blaise would soon see it and interrogate him again. Harry had just texted him like he’d said he would; Draco couldn’t even wait the standard five minutes before replying to seem like he hadn’t been waiting for Harry to message him.
Cutting off his own floundering, Harry leaned forward to press his lips to Draco’s in a warm, soft, lingering kiss.
Harry whipped around to look at his boyfriend, panic fluttering in his chest. He felt his breathing stutter, his heart skipped a beat, his stomach twisting in knots. His hands started to sweat. Draco’s eyes were hard, his entire body was tense and rigid. He had completely abandoned his page of lilies in favor of staring at Harry with something akin to fury in his steely gaze.
“It’s raining,” Harry explained. Looking out the window, he saw that it was pouring outside, rain sliding down the windows. A crash of thunder sounded; the lightning couldn’t have been very close to the school. The bigger boy stood up, heaving Draco up with him.
“Don’t you worry, Draco,” Fred interrupted, George beside him. Both were drenched in sweat but were practically glowing. “You can kiss your atrocious boyfriend all you like at the party in our common room tonight.”
But Pansy leaned over, and faster than Draco could stop it, snatched his cell. She tapped away and looked up at him after a few seconds of staring at his phone.
“Draco, I need to call Sirius,” Hermione said, crouching in front of Harry, “I need you to hold him tightly from behind, just like how I was.”
“What’re you grinning for, you big dope? I thought you absolutely dreaded the thought of coming back for the new semester?” Ron was sitting on the floor at the foot of his bed, sifting through a pile of sweets his mum must have made for him.
But before Draco could take it any further, Harry pulled away and continued walking down the aisle toward a shelf of picture frames, pushing the cart in front of him. The irked groan that came from Draco behind him only made the devious smirk on his lips grow, light laughter shaking his shoulders.
Making as little noise as he could, Harry dashed out of his dorm room, then down to the common room and out into the corridor. He listened closely to Draco’s breathing as he ran to the secret passage that led closest to the school’s garage, completely disregarding the fact that it was nighttime and he could very well get caught for sneaking out after curfew.
That’s why after Draco had fallen asleep, Harry had taken a quick run down to his car to grab his boyfriend’s things and stashed them under his bed, attempting to at least somewhat clear his mind.
“Joan, it’s nice to see you again,” Draco said, pulling away from her. His bright grin had only grown brighter. Harry had known that Draco knew the owner of the shop, but he didn’t think they were…
“Look,” Pansy pinched the bridge of her nose, “I get it, okay? I do. You’re uncertain, you’ve never been in a relationship before. It’s okay to have feelings, it
His phone pinged from beside him, a text from Draco that only contained the manor’s address. Harry quickly put it into his GPS and drove as fast as he could. The thought of making Draco wait made his fingers twitch against the wheel.
Harry took in all the vibrant colors and hues of the sunset. He could easily imagine them on a canvas that Draco had painted, stained on his long, pale fingers and the old, ragged t-shirt he’d stolen from Harry to paint in.
Draco isn’t the same person that he was, Ron, and you would know that if you’d bothered to take your head out of your ass. If you’d just listened to what Hermione was trying to tell you—” Harry cut himself off, trying to swallow past the lump in his throat. “We could have avoided all of this
Bodies crashed into him, nearly knocking Harry to the ground if not for the others behind him. His sight finally focused on the faces of his teammates, bright grins all around. His head cleared, and he finally allowed himself a grin. They were all yelling excitedly, with glittering sparkles in their eyes. His chest erupted with a radiant happiness, seeping into his bones, flowing through his veins, and rushing to his head. Harry wrapped his arms around the ones closest to him. A grin split his face, he had to close his eyes to wrap his mind around what had happened in the last few minutes.
Slowly, Harry pulled away from his boyfriend’s lips to start trailing over his skin—lightly over his cheek, leaving soft kisses across his jaw and down the elegant column of his neck. Every inch of Draco he could find. The feel of his smooth skin and the sweet taste of his mouth and skin made butterflies flutter in Harry’s stomach in the best possible way. Listening to Draco’s panting breaths was an ecstasy all its own. He didn’t know how he’d managed to convince himself that he was fine without Draco for a few days.
Harry felt the relief in his bones. Angelina Johnson, his best centerfield, whacked his arm as she walked with him towards the locker rooms. “Any plans for the weekend?” she asked with a tired smile on her face, a sheen of sweat over her face.
Draco decided to drop that particular subject, he wanted to be the one to bring the light to Harry’s eyes, not diminish it.
Draco had told him a few days ago that his mother’s birthday would be on the twenty-fourth of this month—this upcoming Tuesday—and that his parents would be coming the day beforehand to take him out of school for a few days. Draco had told him about the party that was sure to occur, filled with the relatives his parents were on good terms with and his parents’ friends—none of which he was too fond of or excited to see. Draco had explained how it was draining just to be in their presence, constantly having to pretend to be the boy they expected.
just for my body?” he teased, despite the pressure building behind his eyes at Harry’s words. The atmosphere had stopped feeling so tense. It was lighter somehow, now that both of them seemed to ease into the feeling that they were completely safe with each other—not that they hadn’t been previously, but it hit differently somehow. It was new territory, this conversation, and safety was beyond important.
They arrived at the garage, and Harry grazed Draco’s elbow to guide him toward the row his car was parked in. “Which one is yours?” Draco asked.
“Harry, baby, are you okay?” Draco’s voice was quiet as he stepped into the bathroom. “Do you want me to get you water, or—or some aspirin, anything?”
“Class starts in a few minutes, baby. As much as I would love to make out with you right now, I’ve gotta go, or Professor McGonagall will kick my ass.”
“Are you joking?” Harry laughed. “Of course I’m scared! I’m terrified, Theo!” With large eyes, the other boy looked up at him. The captain allowed himself the smallest of moments to feel the panic he kept at bay. He only allowed it to touch him before he locked it away again, working to convert it into stamina for the game. “But we’re all going to walk out on that field together—and win or lose—we’re going to kick Ilvermorny’s
Draco pressed his lips to Harry’s temple, nuzzling his hair and sliding his hands from Harry’s shoulders to his waist and around to his stomach, tracing random shapes and circles onto his shirt. Harry could feel his boyfriend’s gentle smile against his skin, his delicate fingers leaving cool trails on his skin through his worn shirt. He felt Draco’s heartbeat through his back, his own falling in time to match the rhythm. An almost drowsy feeling filled his head—only it was less like sleepiness and more like he was drunk on relaxation.
“Hermione, what’s going on?” Draco asked, trying his best to ignore Ronald’s presence looming over his shoulder and keep his internal screaming in check. Even he could hear the fear and anxiety threaded in his words. Seeing Harry like this… Draco didn’t know what to do. He didn’t know what this was, didn’t know what was happening to him, any of it.
That he would take you out to lunch when you can’t handle the noise in the Great Hall? Do you think that Harry would give you his football jersey to wear on game days, or his hoodies when you’re cold, if he didn’t want to be with you? For heaven’s sake, Draco,
content. Draco’s grey eyes were struggling to stay open, Harry knew he was fighting to stay awake; Harry wouldn’t mind if he fell asleep.
“Never.” Draco smiled, leaning forward to softly rub his nose against Harry’s. “Only when your godfather catches us making out in your car in a parking lot.”
“Yeah, Sirius. He was my dad’s best friend.” Harry hesitated like there was a part of the story he was reluctant to tell. He squeezed Draco’s hand and seemed to decide that he trusted the smaller boy. “He was in prison for twelve years, falsely accused of murder. When they found the guy he had supposedly killed, they let him go. He came for me as soon as he was cleared, about six months later the Dursley’s finally let him have custody. I was thirteen when I finally got to move in with him. The day I met Sirius was probably the happiest day of my entire life.”
Draco waited until Professor Binns sat down at his desk before answering. “Cedric Diggory happened.” The name tasted like poison coming from his mouth. His stomach twisted, his heart plummeted.
He’d been the one to convince Harry that therapy was a good idea. Despite Harry’s reluctance to go at first, Sirius had coaxed and encouraged him until, one night, Harry had broken down sobbing in his arms, and finally realized that he
Draco hadn’t touched this particular case in months. He’d hidden it under his bed, there was a slight film of dust on it. But on this particular day, he’d finally felt that familiar spark in his hands, finally felt some form of inspiration.
Harry would be lying if he said he hadn’t wondered about the same things before. Even before he’d gotten the letter from Petunia.
There was a long moment where the only sound seemed to be shuffling sheets and Harry’s repressed laughter. Then Harry’s phone was on the move until Teddy’s too-close face came into focus with Harry behind him. The toddler looked slightly older than he did in the pictures and his turquoise hair was fading into its natural mousy brown. His sweet face and sparkling eyes made him all the cuter.
“This,” Draco said, taking Harry’s hand again, twining their fingers together, “is my boyfriend, Harry.”
Snape’s words had gone, but Harry could still feel a lingering stain. With every strike against the bag, every drop of sweat, he felt that stain lift. His entire focus was on the strain in his muscles, on keeping his breath even. His punches got faster and harder, his kicks became more vigorous the longer he went on.
Draco laughed at his boyfriend’s faux mocking expression, snatching a sandwich before the starved athlete beside him ate them all. Draco opened the laptop and set it between them, the two quickly finding some mindless movie to watch. Draco snuggled in closer to Harry, laying his head on his shoulder and against his neck. He could already feel the contentment spreading in his chest, the warmth seeping through his skin, sleep pressing heavy on his eyelids.
Harry was happy to be able to say that he had successfully driven off his ex-boyfriend. Cedric had nearly made a fool of himself with how hard he had tried to catch Harry’s eye despite his paying attention to the other competitors. Harry had been attentively studying Theo, impressed by how much the boy had downplayed himself when speaking of his interest in football. He had some bloody
Draco smiled and replied, “Yeah, of course.” He unraveled his arms from around the other boy and walked through the door with a last look over his shoulder at his boyfriend.
As soon as Harry finished, he took deep—nearly gasping—breaths as he set the empty bottle on his bedside table. Scooting closer to him, Draco gently grabbed one of Harry’s hands and pressed it against his chest, right where his heart was. The beat was slow and steady. Turning to look at him, Harry’s green eyes looked calm once again. Exhausted, but calm.
Alright, so I've gotten a few requests for a sequel, and I decided that I actually wanted to write one. I planned on ten chapters. Since the first chapter of this was just meant to be a one-shot, there isn't really a whole lot of plot or depth of character, so I kind of had to cram some of it into this chapter (sorry). It's a little bit of a filler. I also decided that I really liked the idea of a black Hermione, and a biracial Harry (he's half Indian). I hope you guys enjoy it!
He laid his head on Harry’s shoulder, done with his questions. For now, he was content to just sit here with him for as long as he could, soaking in the pleasant atmosphere that surrounded the two boys.
Draco gestured to the foot of the bed for Harry to set the bags down before slowly making his way to his desk, trying to put the drawings away before Harry could see them.
“Class is over, Harry. You can stop fantasizing now,” Hermione teased, “We have to head to lunch now, you can ask Malfoy to sit with us again if you’re really so desperate.” Harry just smiled at her and jumped up from his seat, quickly gathered his things, and hurried out the door as Hermione linked elbows with him. There were only a few stragglers left in the hallways, making their way to lunch as well.
Pansy seemed to have caught on to his anxiousness when she jabbed him in the ribs in the middle of the lesson in English.
It was only natural for Draco to grin back down at him, then slide his hands to the back of his neck, lift his head and kiss him. Passionately, and with absolutely no regard for anyone who could be watching. He could taste the saltiness of Harry’s sweat on his lips, feel the adrenaline running through his body, feel his rapid heartbeat, and the sweet glide of his lips against Draco’s own. There was nothing else but Harry—nothing but the string that connected Draco’s heart to his.
Draco felt her words sink into his skin. This was what it meant to love Harry—he had to have control over himself when Harry needed him. He needed to be the strong one sometimes.
It was Draco walking Harry backward until the taller boy was sitting on a bench, barely breaking the kiss before he straddled Harry’s hips and sat on his lap.
of a chance of winning.” The wide-eyed, incredulous look on Ferreira’s stupid, bastard face was almost concerningly satisfying. “I hope your ego isn’t bruised too much. Now, it was delightful to meet you and catch up and everything, but Harry and I have more important things to do, so, if you’ll politely excuse us.”
The breath rushed out of Harry’s lungs, he could feel his eyes darken, his hand tightened on Draco’s side, fingers dipping under his shirt, tracing the lines of his hip bone.
was tired, that they had been at this since classes ended when they should’ve been enjoying their Friday night. But if Coach walked in and saw idle bodies, the blame would fall on Harry’s shoulders.
By the time Harry got back to the common room with a basket of Hermione’s favorite foods, Hermione was still curled together on the couch, her back facing the door where Harry had entered. He rushed to her side and knelt by the couch, gently taking her shoulder and turning her to face him.
Draco leaned over the console and planted a kiss on Harry’s cheek. Harry swiftly glanced at him and squeezed his hand.
At Draco’s nod, Harry kissed his boyfriend’s forehead and released his hand. He turned to Hermione on his other side. The shuttered look in her eyes worried him, but he trusted Draco to do as he asked. He pressed a kiss to her hair before Draco swung an arm around her shoulders, leading her and the rest of their friends to the southern common room.
Leaning forward, Draco reached up and pressed a kiss to Harry’s jaw as they walked in. He took in the bathroom around him, identical to the one in his own dorm room; the white tile floor, the diamond-shaped walk-in shower in one corner, the corner bathtub in the other, all of it.
Draco looked at her with resentful fondness before he whispered, “I saw Harry at lunch today. He seemed…
“Yes and no,” Harry started, gently. “I regret that night with Ginny—drunk sex is never a good idea, and it only ended up hurting both of us. But… I don’t regret being with Cedric, as crazy as that sounds. Even though the relationship ended horribly, I was happy—for the most part—while it lasted. And sex with him was part of that. Both of those experiences taught me a lot, and I like to think that I came out better.”
He couldn’t let himself fall asleep without telling Harry as much. Receiving a soft kiss to his head, Draco finally found himself falling into the depths of sleep in the arms of the boy he loved.
For the instant before Theo had to ball, Nicole darted in front of him and stole it, hurrying in the direction of Hogwarts’ goal which was guarded by Alicia. Harry’s stomach plummeted.
But that didn’t mean the words didn’t make his blood boil. He hated them with everything he was worth. He hated that he couldn’t know for sure what his parents were like, hated that he didn’t have a single memory of them.
He practically felt the wheels in Hermione’s mind turning. With each passing second, the silence grew like thorns in Harry’s chest and over his entire body. Thorns that pricked at his skin and demanded that he pay penance.
The hallway was where he got nervous. Harry had a pretty good idea of the teachers’ rounds schedule, but he also knew that they tended to switch it up once in a while. He prayed that tonight was not one of those times.
Harry could still feel Draco’s soft lips against his own, he had replayed the memory of the blond boy gripping his face to pull him down to kiss him throughout all his classes. Professor Snape had snapped at him more than once for being unattentive; Harry was sure he would fail the assignment he’d been given, he’d been too busy thinking about Draco to absorb any of the information. (Harry desperately wanted to feel those chilled hands in his hair, on his shoulders, everywhere. He wanted to kiss every inch of skin Draco would allow him to, he wanted to slide his hands under the other boy’s shirt, wanted to feel his breaths as they moved through his chest. He wanted, no, no he
After he nodded his understanding, Harry watched with blurry vision as his godfather turned to Draco.
Harry burrowed further into his boyfriend’s soft, worn shirt, curling his arms closer around him. “I told Hermione when we were twelve. I’d had a panic attack and she found me in the closet I’d hidden in. I told her everything. I don’t think she left my side that entire week.” Harry paused, fisting his hand in the smaller boy’s shirt. “Ron’s never known. None of the Weasley’s do.”
Breathing was nearly impossible, his lungs stuttered and heaved. One of Harry’s hands gripped his hip so tightly, he was sure he would leave bruises behind—but Draco couldn’t care less, he wanted Harry to mark him, to leave reminders that he’d been there. His other hand plunged underneath Draco’s shirt, grazing up his sides and eliciting another high-pitched whine from Draco. Having Harry touch him, kiss him,
had been nothing more than the fact that Terry Boot asked her to lunch and she didn’t know what to wear. He’d been dragged away from Harry because Pansy hadn’t known what to
His godfather nearly squeezed the breath out of Harry with how tightly he held him before reluctantly letting go. Sirius’ quicksilver eyes lingered on Harry for a moment but quickly turned to look at Draco, who Harry knew had been standing slightly behind him with an awkward air surrounding him.
Harry leaned forward and kissed Draco’s forehead before opening his door and slowly letting go of him so he could get in. It broke his heart to see how his boyfriend curled into himself on the seat, bringing his knees up to his chest and wrapping his arms around his legs, his forehead on his knees.
The sound of Harry’s fists hitting the bag didn’t relent. Figuring that he wouldn’t get anywhere being angry with Harry, Draco tried with everything in himself to calm the furious flames inside him. This had gone on far too long for his taste. He was done waiting for Harry to come to him.
He briefly recalled just how cold it had felt being away from Harry for his mother’s birthday, and tried not to let his thoughts linger on how he would feel that same chill in a matter of hours.
Draco didn’t even have the chance to say the comforting words that had been on his tongue before Ronald stepped back into the room. Needless to say, his resentment toward the boy only grew.
But when he woke up, Draco felt warmer than he ever had. His nose was filled with the scent of peppermint and cologne, and he was so comfortable that it was a miracle he had even woken up at all. But under his fingers weren’t the sleek, silk sheets he covered his bed with. Under his head wasn’t the ridiculously expensive down pillow he loved.
A tight thread woven of worry and sympathy constricted around Draco’s heart. He’d been to a few therapy sessions himself, so he had some idea of how they worked, but it wasn’t ever a consistent thing or something that stuck.
She lifted her face from her knees, and the sight of her puffy red eyes forced Draco to sit down. She curled herself tighter on the stair, glancing at Draco before fixing on Harry. Draco worried that she would send him away, but she seemed to deem him trustworthy. A flower of pride bloomed in his chest.
Harry only laughed and ran a finger down the line of Draco’s nose, easily making a soft smile appear on Draco’s mouth.
him. Harry’s arms wound around his waist and held him there, kissing him just as fervently. Draco raked his hands through his black hair, which was drenched, trying to pull himself closer. His lips slid against Harry’s, messier than he would have liked due to the rain, but he didn’t mind. His chest was filled with butterflies, his heart was near to exploding with how elated he felt. He could have frozen time to just this moment, and be content. The entire world could have been watching them, and he wouldn’t have cared the slightest bit. Harry was holding him and kissing him in the rain like a scene in a cheesy romance novel, and everything was perfect.
He took his hands from his pockets and started fiddling with the cuffs of his shirt, feeling the shame start to seep in.
While Harry spoke, the rest of their teammates gathered around them. Fred and George stood at Harry’s other side, Alicia and Katie sat next to Theo. He saw the eager gleam in the twins’ eyes, the apprehensive twitch in their fingers. Harry glimpsed the familiar bounce in Alicia’s leg, the patterns of her drumming fingers. Katie’s entire body was tensed, her grin was nearly feral—like she would tear apart the other team with her teeth if she needed to. Harry looked at each of them in the eye, garnering what courage he had to give to his teammates.
Harry shook his head at the other boy before walking in and gently setting the blond boy in his bed, tucking in the blankets before kissing his forehead and whispering, “Goodnight, sweetheart.” Harry didn’t expect any reply, having assumed his boyfriend was too deep in sleep to even hear him.
If it's horrible, I'm sorry. If this chapter was offensive to you in any way, please let me know how and why, so I can fix it in later chapters. I hope you enjoyed this chapter! Comments, kudos, requests, I take them all. Thanks for reading!
“Harry,” he whispered, “can you hear me? It’s Draco, sweetheart.” Draco licked his lips before continuing. “You’re safe, my love. You’re in your dorm room, with me and Hermione. I love you so much, Harry. I need you to take deep breaths, just like I am, okay? Deep, even breaths.” Pausing, Draco moved one of his hands so it covered Harry’s, the one grasping at his chest. “I know it’s dark right now, I’m sure the fire alarms scared you, but you’re okay. Just breathe with me, alright? You’re safe, I promise, sunshine.”
“Now, now, children,” Draco smirked and turned back around in his seat to see Harry holding back laughter. “No fighting in the car. Harry’s trying to drive.” He reached across the console and entwined his fingers with Harry’s. The sounds of Pansy and Theo’s bickering slowly died out.
The increased pressure on his hand made Harry look down at Draco, who whispered, “You don’t have to, Harry. You can walk away right now, you don’t have to say a word, and none of us would blame you.” The blond boy lifted his other hand to brush through Harry’s black hair, bringing the smallest of smiles to his face. “It’s okay not to talk to him, for now.” Draco’s gaze was steady and determined, bolstering Harry’s own confidence. He could do this.
Opening the door to Number 12 Grimmauld Place was like breathing in fresh air after being stuck underwater. Familiar smells of sandalwood, vanilla, and jasmine surrounded Harry as he looked down the familiar hallway, which was lined with countless framed photos. Sirius’ hand on his shoulder and the smile on his face reminded him of the first time he’d walked through this door—one of the happiest days of Harry’s life.
(Not that Lucius Malfoy was in any way a large man, neither in height or in girth—but as a child, your father is always the biggest person. He’s always towering over you, looming over your shoulder and intimidating with his presence. Your father is just…
Harry abandoned the toiletries he’d been packing and walked over to where Draco stood by his bed. He could practically feel the agitation oozing off of the smaller boy as he gently hugged him from behind, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist and hunching over to set his chin on his shoulder. The fabric of his pull-over sweater was soft against his hands. He felt Draco freeze, then all the tension seemed to melt from his body. His arms dropped to his sides and his head came back to rest on Harry’s shoulder.
After quickly closing his locker and slinging his gym bag over his shoulder, Harry took Draco’s hand with his free one and interlaced their fingers, leading him out of the locker room.
But then the thunder boomed closer, and Draco jolted, breaking the kiss. The rain started to pour heavier, and Draco knew that their moment of paradise was over. He realized how cold he was without Harry’s body pressed against his. Harry quickly pulled Draco to his side and started guiding him back into the school.
There was a soft smile on his face like he’d been waiting for this moment to happen. Perhaps the circumstances were less than ideal, but Draco cherished it anyway.
It had finally happened. Draco had finally seen Harry in the hallway. He had been walking from English to Maths, and Draco had caught a glimpse of that fluffy, unruly black hair, and he knew that it couldn’t possibly have been anyone else. Harry’s green eyes sparkled as he talked with another boy, a red-haired one that Draco didn’t know. Draco waved his hand, trying to get Harry’s attention. Those green eyes finally flashed in his direction and settled on Draco’s face.
With a smirk on his face, Harry dropped the shirt in his hands and turned around to look at his boyfriend. His smiling, flushed, grey-eyed boyfriend. His boyfriend that was dressed in a white crop top that Harry had never seen him in before, along with his superbly tight black skinny jeans. The shirt’s hem fell just below Draco’s ribcage, and his pants hugged his legs in all the right places.
So... This chapter gets a little more physical (I'm not really sure if I wrote it well enough or if it's really cringy, but I guess we'll find out) so if you're uncomfortable with that just go ahead and skip to the first asterisk. This chapter is a little bit longer, so I hope you all like it!
On a sudden impulse, without a second thought, Draco reached out and wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, drawing him close and nuzzling his face in Harry’s muscled stomach. Draco held him tightly, the smell of vanilla and grapefruit overpowering his senses. The feel of Harry’s damp, smooth skin only made him hold tighter.
Harry recognized the tension in Theo’s body. He knew the paralyzing dread that was warring with the anticipation in his veins. The first game was always nerve-wracking, setting the tone for someone’s experience during the rest of the season. It didn’t help that this game would either make or break their way to the championships, and Theo had only been on the team for a few days.
“When you get back,” Draco’s thumb came to caress Harry’s bottom lip, “promise me you’ll let me paint you for as long as I want.”
A grin spread on Harry’s lips under Draco’s fingers. His eyes shone with silent laughter, his head shook at how ridiculous his friends were. Draco shared the same sentiment, biting his lip to keep the snickering laughter quiet.
Quiet laughter shook Harry’s chest as he leaned closer to place a soft kiss to the corner of Draco’s mouth. A second kiss was pressed against his cheekbone, a third to his nose before Harry leaned his forehead against the smaller boy’s. A shiver raced down Draco’s spine. The indignation melted away in favor of focusing on the feeling of Harry’s calloused fingers drawing circles and random shapes on his skin. The leg that Draco had thrown over Harry tightened, bringing him impossibly closer to Harry’s body. Sighing through his nose, Draco dragged a finger down the line of his boyfriend’s nose, down to his lips.
handsome. He stood at about Draco’s height, with luminescent brown skin, a lean but muscular figure, curly brown hair, a thin, fine-boned face, and a cupid’s bow that Draco would kill for.
I'm finally back! Sorry it was a week longer than expected, my dearest readers. Thank you all for understanding why I couldn't write or post anything for a while!
“It’s nice to meet you, Joan,” Harry said, plastering what he hoped was a convincingly pleasant smile on his face. It became less forced when she smiled back at him.
“Mr. Potter, it is no wonder that you have so few brain cells. If you cannot refrain from using your cell phone in class, I will take great pleasure in taking it and giving you detention.”
Draco didn’t know how he’d gathered up the courage to do it, but hearing those words fall from Harry’s mouth must have pushed him.
Harry felt anger burning in his chest, rising up to form hateful, scornful words. But he knew that that wasn’t what Draco needed right now. So he smothered the feeling before it could snowball into something worse.
They’d stayed up for at least an hour, whispering to each other. Draco had listened to each and every word Harry said, listened to each story and fact that made him want to break down in tears just envisioning it. The insides of his cheeks were raw from biting them. Harry had dozed off in the middle of a sentence, and Draco hadn’t had the heart to wake him.
Draco closed his mouth and knew that the flush had spread to his chest. Harry laughed, squeezing his hand slightly to let him know he meant it good-heartedly. They spent the rest of the drive in comfortable silence as Draco traced shapes on Harry’s palm. (He was mesmerized by the warm brown tone of his skin, the calluses on his fingers. He loved the lines on his palm, and he couldn’t help imagining what it might feel like to have those hands on his face, his waist, his skin in general. He couldn’t help but imagine how it must feel like to have those hands in his hair, to have them caressing his face)
Harry dropped to his knees and was immediately accosted by the huge Scottish Deerhound. He couldn’t help but talk to Snuffles in that stereotypical dog-parent voice as he said, “Hey, buddy! Did you miss me? Huh? Did you miss me?” The whines that came in reply only made Harry chuckle louder as he buried his hands in Snuffles’ wiry black fur, a full belly laugh that resonated in his whole body. Petting him all over only seemed to make the dog even more excited.
So, I hope all of my dearest, most beloved readers enjoyed this chapter! Leave me a comment because they are literally the air I breathe and I love getting them, and also you just should because why not. I love you all! <3
And although he knew that he should probably be focusing on his practice, seeing as the last game of the season, the one that would make or break their team, was four days away, Harry found himself drifting in his thoughts. It was lucky for him that Coach Hooch was more preoccupied with phone calls and paperwork than closely observing the team.
When he finally found Harry, the first thing he noticed was the lack of blood and gore—which brought him an immense amount of relief. The second was why Ronald had said “them” instead of “he”.
Gently grabbing Draco’s hands with both of his own, Harry leaned over the console and kissed Draco’s cheek, lingering for a moment and smiling against his soft, delicate skin. He whispered, “How could they
“And half of Monday,” Harry slung the gym bag over his shoulder, drew Draco closer to tuck him into his side, then started leading him out of the locker room. “So,” Harry started, “tonight, we’re just grabbing some food from the kitchens and relaxing because I don’t think I have the energy to do anything else, baby.”
After pulling his phone from his front pants pocket, Hermione crawled across him to lay her head on his stomach. Out of habit, Harry’s other hand went to fiddle with the ends of her curly, dark hair. “He said seven. I can start your packing if you want to sleep for a few hours.”
“Draco, are you alright?” Blaise asked. He didn’t respond. They finally reached the Maths classroom; Draco walked to his seat and sat down, staring at the wood of his desk.
Draco cursed, once again opening the door to the northern common room. He hadn’t been gone very long, an hour at best, and yet Ronald Weasley was already making out with Lavender again.
“No,” Hermione softly replied, “no, not really. Sure, we haven’t spent as much time together, but that’s normal when you have a boyfriend, Harry.” Rising to lean on her elbows, Hermione plucked Harry’s arm from his face so he would look at her. “Plus, I’m your best friend, not your jealous housewife. You only have so many hours in the day, and I’ll be content if I get at least one of them with you, okay?”
Okay so before you start yelling at me about my horribly inaccurate trauma dream: Believe me, I know that real trauma dreams are not like this. I know that they're not just memories. But in my defense, I didn't really have the time to write an elaborate one, and I just kind of wanted to get my point across.
With that, Sirius turned and walked into the shop, the other man he had glanced at following him inside.
“Listen up, Harry,” Theo began, disdain dripping off his lips with his words, “If you hurt him—if a single
Draco ignored the hesitancy flourishing in his heart and walked over; he climbed into Harry’s lap and curled up in his arms. He could have sobbed when Harry wound his strong arms around him, leaning back against the wall to support both their weights. He felt so unworthy of the warm comfort Harry offered. His heart ached and throbbed and his soul felt utterly wrecked, but it eased when Harry kissed his hair and then fit Draco’s head under his chin.
“Oh, yes,” Harry said, his arms draping around Draco’s slim waist, a feeling of awe crawling inside him. “Someone
After carefully picking their way through the dorm room of sleeping, hungover boys, and the common room in a similar state, and calling Pansy to let her know about Draco’s newfound situation, Harry found himself in Draco’s dorm room, attempting to help fill his luggage bags with his things. Draco was currently folding his clothes in a nearly violent manner, muttering under his breath about how unfair the situation was. The line between his brows was more prominent than Harry had seen it in a while. His narrow shoulders were inching towards his ears, strained beyond belief.
“He walked you back here and you didn’t introduce us?” Theo asked in mock offense. Pansy had chuckled even harder at that, her face flushed a bright pink.
It was as they were dancing that Draco stretched up to whisper in Harry’s ear, inducing goosebumps and a shivering sigh, “Take me to your room?”
“And what might I be sneaking out for?” Harry said in a low, almost-raspy voice, his lips grazing against Draco’s ear.
Relief crashed over Harry when he saw Draco finally start to unravel himself. Every movement was slow and careful as he inched across the sheets between them. He crawled into Harry’s lap, latching onto him—his legs crossed behind Harry’s back, his chest pressed tightly against Harry’s, his arms wrapped around Harry’s neck, his face buried in the junction of his neck and shoulder. One of Draco’s hands tangled in Harry’s unruly black hair while the other fisted the fabric of his loose tank top between his shoulder blades.
for Harry. They had been full of hand-holding and laughter, tender forehead kisses and heads on shoulders. Those almost-three weeks had been packed with smiles and sitting together at lunch. They were filled with lively banter and soft gazes and golden blushes.
She held his gaze, and he could’ve sworn that he saw a twitch of her lips, and her eyes line with silver. “I can’t say that I thought I would ever hear those words,” she said, “I also can’t say that I forgive you right now, but I can say thank you. Thank you, for saying those things, and for telling me your story.” The corners of her mouth were definitely pulling into the smallest of smiles.
“I swear I will sit on you if you try to leave this bed without sleeping for at least a solid two hours.”
After so much time, work, and struggle, he’d finally been able to accept them as part of him, a part of his past that he couldn’t just lock away and pretend didn’t exist. He didn’t like it, he didn’t like that this was what he came from, that this was the story he was given to tell. He didn’t like that there were times it crept back to him. He didn’t like that it still affected him. But he wouldn’t be afraid of it.
Draco groaned when he felt Harry sucking and biting at the sensitive skin at the junction of his shoulder and neck. He raked his hand through his dark hair, tugging and fisting the now-damp strands. Draco’s mind was on autopilot, letting his body take over for him; he moved against Harry, grinding into him and thoroughly enjoying the way Harry
Draco looked her square in the eyes. “I’m truly sorry for what I said to you, Hermione, and for the pain that I’ve caused you.”
“It was after we went to bed,” Harry explained, “I think you were probably like, half-asleep or something. You were babbling about a lot of stuff before you finally fell asleep in the middle of talking about how you wish you’d had a dog growing up.”
Harry looked completely euphoric as he replied, with no hint of doubt in his voice, “I love you, too.”
The boy seemed to jerk away once he realized he was tangled in Harry, and Harry couldn’t even bite back a laugh; granted, he kept it small so as not to wake up the harpy a seat over.
victorious air to his voice. Draco knew he was done for. He clapped a hand over his own mouth to try and keep the noise of his heavy breathing low.
Harry didn’t even bother to answer until he had opened the door to his dorm and practically collapsed onto his bed, finally allowing his exhaustion to hit him. “I’m pretty sure he said six? I don’t know, check my phone, he texted me in third hour.”
“Harry, where are we going?” Draco asked, a whiny tone seeping into his words. “I was comfortable.” Harry had painstakingly coaxed him out of bed. He’d finally given in, allowing his boyfriend to haul Draco to his feet.
Draco then instructed his boyfriend to hand him several different bath salts, oils, scents, and bath bombs; he put so much in that the water he submerged himself in was a completely opaque pearly lavender color. Letting the water completely surround him was oddly relaxing. All sounds were muffled—not that there were very many to start with—and he could almost feel the weight he’d been carrying on his shoulders start to melt away. When he came back up for air, Harry was still sitting on the ledge of the bathtub, cross-legged. Only now he was holding Draco’s shampoo in his hands, an almost sheepish look on his face.
The deafening uproar from the stands gave Draco goosebumps as he cheered with them. A sense of unquenchable pride filled his lungs and then Draco was racing down to the field, his vision tunneled on Harry’s handsome, appalled face as he was being surrounded by his teammates, each of them shouting and slapping Harry on the shoulder, hugging him and grinning.
Focusing on taking deep even breaths, Harry sat down on the bed. He leaned his back against the wall, watching as Draco crawled onto the mattress and sat across from him. His grey eyes were soft and assessing. He looked at him the way a doctor would look at a young patient.
that he did that to you. I know how it hurts, how it screws with your head.” He swallowed hard, and Draco knew from the shadows in his eyes that Harry was trying not to let himself get pulled into those memories. “But it’s not your fault. There’s nothing that you could have done differently, nothing that you could’ve changed or said to him to make him stay. It’s on
Harry held the phone like a ticking bomb, still buzzing, as Draco’s eyes fluttered open and a groggy sounding groan came from the back of his throat. The smaller boy finally managed to open his eyes, scowling at Harry before he caught sight of the caller ID on his phone. His eyes widened almost comically, nearly popping out of his head.
Harry got out of the car and opened Draco’s before brushing his elbow to lead him into the shopping center. Draco was too busy perusing the different stores to notice where the other boy was actually leading him to. All the bright lights and neon signs advertising different stores pulled his attention everywhere at once. He smelled it before he saw it.
Pansy looked confused. “So are you worried about him being angry, or meeting him in the library later? Or Hermione?”
” Hermione exclaimed though she was careful not to be too loud. Draco shifted his head so he could look at her over Harry’s shoulder. Her hand was buried in her dark curls, the entirety of her small frame was tensed. Her black eyes flicked to Draco, then she said, “Try talking to him, whispering to him. It’s soothing to hear someone else’s voice other than the one in his head.”
The buzzing persisted, drawing Harry’s attention away. It felt like a phone, and Harry was certain it was coming from the pocket of Draco’s borrowed sweatpants. The drawstring on said pants was pulled almost all the way out and tied tightly to keep them up on Draco’s smaller hips. The sight made Harry smile. Draco had a tendency to steal his clothes and Harry had no qualms about it when he looked so adorable in them, practically drowning in the swell of fabrics that were much too big for his smaller frame.
Harry was crumpled on the floor, one hand clutching his chest while the other was fisted tightly in his hair. Hermione sat behind him, pressed to his back with her legs on either side of him, hugging him tightly and using her long sleeve to wipe away the sweat beading on Harry’s forehead while whispering in his ear.
“I don’t usually sleep very well after nightmares.” Harry looked at him through his lashes. Draco squeezed his hand, feeling his heart squeeze at the same time. His stomach clenched, his brows drew together. “I just… couldn’t sleep.”
It was at this moment that Draco truly realized something. He was shirtless. In front of Harry. He was
Draco was currently walking towards the Great Hall for lunch when he saw Harry. Pansy seemed to follow his line of sight from beside him and shoved him in Harry’s direction. He turned back to glare at her, but she just nodded her head in Harry’s direction as her eyes said
“That’s my boyfriend, Draco.” Harry’s bright smile seemed to overflow with complete adoration as he watched Teddy watch Draco. “Dray, this is Teddy.”
“Draco, dear, have you decided what university you’ll be studying at?” Iris had asked, glancing at Lucius, who turned toward his son with an expectant glint in his grey eyes.
Draco opened his mouth to object, but seemed to understand Harry’s earnestness. Harry couldn’t even stop to admire the blossoming blush on Draco’s face before he said, “Meet me after class today, in the library. We can study together, and I’ll tell you everything, alright?” Draco nodded eagerly, and Harry smiled at him again, kissing his other cheek before taking off for the kitchens again.
But then again, Draco loved him. He’d said so himself, with his own lips and his own words, he’d said it in the way that he kissed him, with so much passion and conviction it made Harry’s heart pound. He was saying it in the way that he took every detail from the scene in front of him and transferred it to his paper, in the way that his eyes lingered on Harry even as he drew.
to her? (Of course, Harry would listen to her, he was the kind of person who puts those he loved before anything else. He was the kind who loved fiercely and with everything he had, and Draco knew that he longed to be one of those people, to be loved so passionately) But most of all, deep down, Draco knew that the biggest thing that was worrying him was the fear that Hermione would despise him. That she would take his apology and throw it into the metaphorical trash bin.
Draco’s eyes fluttered open when Harry went to set him down on his bed, still puffy and dark underneath. His lanky arms tightened around Harry’s neck, bringing him down to the bed with him. So Harry grabbed the blanket and drew it over the both of them and tucked the smaller boy’s head under his chin.
“That’s good, I suppose,” he paused when Theodore Nott came up behind Pansy with a slight scowl on his face, “Is Draco in?”
what does it for you?” Draco’s hand squeezed his own, the other coming up to comb through Harry’s hair. If he thought his lungs would cooperate, Harry might’ve laughed. The most he managed was a pathetic huff, his lips twitching upwards.
, I will rip you to pieces. If he comes back here anything other than absolutely content and happy, you’ll live to regret it. Don’t play with him, this is important to him, and he’s a better person than you could ever hope to find yourself with.”
The smile that was undoubtedly on Harry’s face could practically be felt through the phone, in his words. Beaming to himself, Draco felt his face heating. He both loved and hated that Harry’s words still had such an effect on him.
But then he looked down at Draco, and those talons around his heart loosened. The smile on his blond boyfriend’s face had become somewhat more sincere, despite it being smaller.
There was no part of Harry that was ugly, no part of him that Draco didn’t love with every fiber in his body. It was a miracle, some work of heaven, that a person so kind as Harry had emerged from the darkness of this past. Draco would need time—time to come to terms with everything he had learned.
“I think it was Saturday. Could’ve been Sunday.” Harry shifted against Draco, sliding down so his head could rest against Draco’s shoulder. The smaller boy pressed his lips against Harry’s temple. “It said… She said that she had a few boxes of my mother’s things if I wanted to go and look through them. She said she wanted to see me. Dudley, too.”
Draco furrowed his brow in concern. Harry sounded dejected, morose. As if someone had kicked his puppy and run away laughing. The sparkle that usually resided in his eyes had gone out, he looked exhausted, his shoulders were slumped and his smile was shaky at best.
Harry seemed to hesitate a moment before chuckles poured out of his own mouth, though Draco was positive it wasn’t for the same reason. Whatever the case, it didn’t seem to make Seamus any happier.
A rumbling hum came from the deepest part of Harry’s chest. His head tilted back of its own volition, his eyes fluttered closed. Those dainty hands explored Harry’s abdomen, back, and chest with light touches before pale arms wrapped around his hips.
Once Harry had Teddy settled—if you could call sitting on Harry’s shoulders and excitedly babbling settled—he hugged Tonks, careful not to crush Astrid. The baby’s dark eyes looked at Harry widely, her mousy brown hair still a slight mess. Her nearly toothless mouth pulled into a shy, giggling smile, warming Harry all the way to the center of his heart.
Harry’s voice had gotten quieter the longer he talked. Draco couldn’t see any signs that he was otherwise affected by talking about his parents’ deaths. No teary eyes, no squeaky voice. But he couldn’t get the gruesome images out of his head.
As she closed the door after she got in the car, Draco watched as Harry did as he was told. And at that moment, watching Harry’s muscles constrict with his movements, he realized that he wouldn’t be seeing his boyfriend for nearly a week. Of course, they’d gone days without being able to see each other before, what with Harry’s football games and practices, and Draco’s extensive homework, and the need for sleep.
“So what, just because Harry wants to get in this guy’s pants we’re supposed to forgive and forget?”
He suddenly understood why some people bite their nails when nervous. He didn’t know what to do with his hands and heart couldn’t seem to decide whether to stop completely or beat up his ribcage.
, “We may not have won, but you improved on the last time you played them. I know you all worked very hard to win this game, I know you’re all sad we didn’t win. But I am proud of you all. And I’m sure Coach is, too.”
The memories of that day had narrowed down to those few moments. The way Lucius had looked at him with such disdain, the slight smile on Mrs. Malfoy’s face. Watching Draco get in the car and drive away.
The pressure behind Harry’s eyes built up until he couldn’t hold it in. Tears fell down his face, leaving wet spots on Draco’s shirt.
Harry’s face was drawn in concern when he answered the phone. Draco knew from experience that whenever Coach called Harry, it was most likely for a last-minute practice, or that something had gone wrong. Draco didn’t want to let Harry go, couldn’t let him go without making sure he was okay. But after a moment of Harry listening to her talk, his face lit up, brighter than a Christmas tree.
The woman in the window seat had been stealing glances at them, slightly disgusted and obviously slightly intrigued at what Harry would do next. Harry did not like the disgust in her eyes. Maybe he could just let the blond sleep a little longer, as long as he wanted, just to bug the hobbling toad who sat on the other side of him.
Despite the wave of affection Harry felt for his boyfriend, his fists were aching to get back to beating something, the agitation was still settled in his bones, his skin was itching with aggression, and he knew that if he didn’t work it off now it would just grow into something uglier and heavier.
“Just fine, Dray, just fine,” he mumbled, his voice deep and gravelly with sleep. Even if Draco could see right through his boyfriend’s lie, he figured calling him out on it wouldn’t help. Instead, he just rubbed soothing circles into his hand.
The only downside to Harry’s car was the heater. It always took what seemed like forever to warm up. The chill in the air seeped into Draco’s bones. He wrapped his arms around himself, trying to conserve what warmth he had left. Luckily for Draco, Harry noticed his shivering.
The way Draco whispered to him didn’t sound angry—rather it sounded like he was reaffirming it for Harry. It was gentle and knowing, and it only made Harry’s heart grow fonder of the boy in front of him. Understanding energy seemed to flow out of him, curling around Harry and whispering sweet nothings in his ear. Even though it wouldn’t even be a total of three whole days, he knew that he’d miss simply being in his boyfriend’s presence.
Harry set up the shot in one. Draco rose to the tips of his toes and clenched his hands in the jersey he wore.
He was worried about so many different things. What if Hermione tried to convince Harry that he wasn’t worth bothering with? What if Harry
Harry stopped, taking in the other boy’s appearance. His eyes were wide with concern, his lips were pressed together. Harry managed a weak smile for Draco’s benefit. “No, not exactly. I would love to explain everything to you right now,” Harry swooped in and brushed his lips against Draco’s cheek, gently taking his hand and kissing the back of it before continuing, “but I have to get to the kitchens and back to Hermione as fast as I can.”
About two hours into the flight, Draco had gotten drowsy. Flying always made him sleepy, and it wasn’t exactly a midday flight. No, they had departed at seven, much too late for Draco’s taste, but it was the only flight he could get so last minute.
look. “Some pretty shitty stuff went down with his father, and he called me in the middle of the night because he needed me to pick him up. So, I hauled ass to get there, but by the time we got back to my dorm and fell asleep, it was probably around three in the morning.”
“I’ll see you tomorrow,” he responded. He hung up first. But instead of going to sleep, he sat down at his desk and turned on his lamp. He took out his sketchbook and started to draw.
“Oh?” Draco intoned, nipping at Harry’s finger indignantly. He felt a thread of anticipation weave its way through his ribs. He’d had quite the pleasurable time—for the majority—at the last party the Weasley twins had thrown, and he had an inkling that this one would be better. “Well, darling, perhaps I’ll just have to escort you there.”
Following his every movement, Harry felt Draco’s head drop onto his shoulder, his chest rising and falling with deep, slow breaths. As the conversation slowly shifted, Harry pressed his lips to Draco’s hair and gently squeezed his shoulder, fiddling with his long, pale fingers.
“Oh.” Draco’s tongue darted out to wet his lips. His gaze didn’t move from where it was fixed. “Do you… regret any of it?”
Ron studied him closer, trying to dissect all the different parts of what Harry might have been thinking. “You met someone, didn’t you?” Ron sighed loudly, the way Hermione did before she started a lecture, “Harry, we’ve done this before. If they don’t go to school here, there’s no way that it could work out. Do you not remember-”
The only response Draco gave before they all sat down at the table was a huff of indignation. Harry gave his fingers a gentle squeeze under the table, setting their entwined hands on his thigh and running his thumb up and down the side of Draco’s hand.
“Well?” Draco asked from beside her. Theo and Blaise wore matching expressions, waiting for an explanation.
On the way to the stairs, Draco saw Hermione—fresh-faced and glowing as usual—laughing with Blaise. A smile spread across his lips and he tucked himself into Harry’s side, trying his best not to trip over his own feet. He could practically feel Harry’s warm sheets under his fingers already.
Opening his eyes, Draco scanned the corridor for whatever had gotten Harry so excited. There was nothing. He looked up at his boyfriend, eyes narrowed.
It was absolutely mesmerizing, watching Draco’s hands as he drew. It was new, seeing his typically meticulously clean hands covered in smudges, but Harry truly adored seeing this side of him. Laying across Draco’s bed, in the silence of his dormitory room, he was utterly entranced. Watching the shapes on Draco’s pages transform into stunning works of art was positively fascinating. Although there was no color on the portrait he was creating, the depth and details were incredible.
I hope you guys liked it! I don't know how I feel about the kiss scene, I don't know if I wrote it well enough to really encompass what I had in mind... Let me know what you think in the comments! And you know, kudos are always amazing.
It seemed that the fact that Hogwarts had really won the cup had finally settled in for everyone. The party that the Weasley twins had in fact thrown was even bigger than the previous one, spilling into the corridor and deafening in how loud it was. But it was all worth it, if only for the light in Harry’s eyes.
Neville took the vial with slightly shaky hands, and looked Harry in the eyes when he said, “Thank you, Harry.” Harry simply smiled and nodded his head before turning back around.
“Harry,” Draco whispered through his hands, “save me.” His grey eyes peeked out from his fingers, embarrassment writhing in their depths.
An abrupt pained groan escaped Harry’s lips. Every muscle lining his body tensed even farther, so taut that Draco was afraid they might rip apart. Immediately, Hermione leaned back into Harry so that her lips were practically pressed against his ear, whispering words under her breath to him in the darkness of the room.
to hear them fall from his lips, like honey pouring in his ear, pleasure overflowing his senses. (But deeper than that, he felt that the pet-names were
Harry had thought that once Draco had left, the three of them wouldn’t have bothered to associate with him and Hermione—except for Theo, of course. Instead, they had all huddled in this very room each night that Draco had been gone, watching movies and laughing by the fireplace. The grin on Harry’s face only left when he turned to say something to Draco—only to be reminded that he wasn’t there.
Harry’s smile softened. “Thank you for apologizing to Hermione. You have no idea how much it meant to her, to both of us.”
He looked up at his boyfriend, feeling something close to shyness. Draco’s face felt so hot he probably looked sunburned. He didn’t feel cold anymore.
The gasping breaths that came from Harry’s mouth were panicked and laborious. When Draco crouched in front of him, he was met with Harry’s tightly shut eyes and clenched jaw. Tears were trailing down his face.
With some miraculous surge of strength, Draco forced himself to open the door. Darkness greeted him—the sun having set minutes ago—along with the frightened mumbling of the people in the common room, a few of them holding flashlights. Wading through the crowd, Draco heard the telltale sounds of muffled cries.
“Lavender Brown?!” Draco restrained himself from yelling, knowing that Madam Pince would kick them out if he was too loud. He knew his eyes were wide, his mouth dropped open. Lavender Brown was well known for being extremely possessive of her boyfriends—when she got them—and being hostile towards anyone who came too close to them for her taste. Draco couldn’t believe that Weasley had gone for it, even if it was supposed to be a form of payback against Harry and Hermione.
Over his boyfriend’s head, Harry noticed Mrs. Malfoy walking down the driveway towards them with her hair pulled up in a messy bun atop her head, dressed in a green t-shirt and black leggings. She dragged Draco’s luggage behind her, his duffle bag slung over her shoulder. She looked… devastated. Her eyes were locked on Harry, but this time, her eyes were missing the calculating glint.
“Alright, alright,” Harry surrendered, a sly, mischievous smirk on his face, “you can pay me back later. But just so we’re clear,” Harry leaned in close to teasingly brush his lips against the shell of his boyfriend’s ear, lightly nibbling his earlobe, “you would be the hottest housewife on the block.”
But he also knew that Draco hadn’t eaten this morning, and was probably starving, even if he refused to acknowledge it. Harry had noticed that about Draco, that every once in awhile, he would skip meals and act like he was perfectly fine. Just as he opened his lips to say so, Blaise interrupted him.
Heaving breaths echoed off the stone walls of the corridor. Rapid footsteps slapped down on the stone floor. Everything seemed to be made of stone—Draco’s limbs included as he forced his legs to go faster, pushing as he’d never pushed before. The imposing darkness suffocated each struggling breath that tried to make its way to Draco’s lungs.
“Well,” he started, pointing at each of his friends in turn, “that’s Pansy, Blaise, and that’s Theo.”
The exhaustion that weighed on him wasn’t just physical. Everything inside of him—his mind, his emotions, whatever it was—felt completely drained. Nearly numb. These attacks were nothing new to Harry, but he knew that this one had lasted longer than most of the others. This one had hit differently. His eyes fluttered closed, his breaths finally in time with Draco’s.
Looking at Draco now, as they walked through the glass doors, Harry saw uncertainty and anxiety beneath the confident exterior he had plastered on his face. Harry squeezed his hand reassuringly as he spotted both Sirius and Remus. They both sat at a table in the corner by the window—Remus red-faced and clearly holding back laughter while Sirius waved them over as soon as he saw them.
“Ron, he apologized to me, and I’m okay with Harry seeing him. Why are you being so stubborn about this?”
Of course, Draco had no intention of being embarrassed in front of those shoulders and that hair, and so he stayed exactly as he was, head snuggled into the crook of the boy’s neck, arms wrapped around the boy’s left arm, trying to keep his breathing even.
Draco’s head snapped up, his grey eyes flashing with worry. Harry took a moment to just gaze at his eyes before speaking.
Dear readers, this took me three days, twelve hours of sleep, and two breakdowns to write. So I hope it's not complete trash. Just as a heads up, I have a lot going on right now with my school's musical, it's kicking my trash and I'm just slightly sleep-deprived. So I might not be able to post chapters as regularly as I have been. I hope you like the chapter!
Harry had eagerly agreed when Draco asked if he could draw him. He felt honored that Draco thought him worthy of his beloved pencils and charcoal.
of it—Draco loved every moment of it, craved him, wanted him in every way. It felt as though Harry’s hands were touching him everywhere at once, his heart was beating so fast he was sure it would burst from his ribs.
At this, Harry’s eyes flicked up to look into Draco’s, though he didn’t stop wiping away the emerald green paint that had found its way onto his boyfriend’s neck. He saw the mild hesitation in their grey depths and answered with his own question. “Is this going to be like your last off-topic question?”
Draco burst out laughing. Here he was, in his boyfriend’s bed, in his boyfriend’s dormitory, with no idea where his shirt was, and what he was sure was a hickey on his neck. He could only imagine the look on his mother’s face if she could see him now, let alone his father.
Skeptically, Draco considered the boy. He’d been gone for far too long to have just been getting water. He’d left without a word.
After a while, the picture came to fruition—a crown of flowers set on Harry’s head. The colors bled into each other. The flowers were hardly defined, he could barely tell what kind they were supposed to be. But Harry’s face was nearly as beautiful as it was in person; his eyes were closed and his face was turned as if he were bathing in sunlight. It was messier than Draco usually went for, but he hadn’t used his oil pastels in a while, so he thought it was at least decent.
So, Harry craned his head until his lips were pressed to the top of Pansy’s head and wrapped his arms around her curvaceous frame. “Shh, flower, I know. I’m not going to be gone very long, okay?”
Ron’s gaze immediately went to Harry’s bed, his entire body seemed to freeze. Harry clutched Draco closer to himself as Ron’s blue gaze turned cold, hard, nearly disgusted. The laptop was digging into his legs, the noise from the movie was the only sound. It was almost too loud for how tense the silence was.
“You were mumbling in your sleep,” he whispered. His voice was almost too loud for the silence. The only other sounds in the room were the snores coming from the floor, probably Theo. “You were moving around a lot, too.” There were a good six inches between them, and it felt like too much and not enough space at the same time. Harry closed his eyes, words of others crowding his head, telling him what to do.
A small, wistful smile appeared on Harry’s face. He’d been waiting to hear those words for months but had given up hope of the possibility. He hadn’t given thought to what he might do if the day ever came.
“Speaking of which,” she said, letting go of Harry so they could climb up the stairway to his dormitory, “what time is he picking you up?”
A bright grin spread across Draco’s face, so wide he felt his eyes crinkle. He pushed himself into a sitting position and waved Narcissa over to come to sit with him. She beamed at him and practically threw herself on the bed, scooting up to lean against the headboard.
Hermione opened her eyes and smiled. She extracted herself from Harry and did something Draco never thought would happen.
This time, it was Harry who leaned in, nudging Draco’s nose with his own before slanting his mouth over Draco’s in a soft, gentle kiss. Fireworks seemed to explode inside Harry, brighter and hotter with each movement of their lips. It seemed that they both melted into each other as they fit together perfectly. Harry’s hands touched every inch of Draco he could reach. He desperately wanted to memorize the shape of him, the feel of him so close, his smell, his taste—everything. Draco kissed him slowly, almost lazily. His fingers curled in Harry’s raven hair, gently tugging him closer. It felt as if they had all the time in the world when in reality they both knew that Harry needed to leave in a matter of minutes.
“Harry,” Draco whispered into his skin, “please just… Just tell me what to do, Harry.” He dug his fingers into Harry’s skin, trying to repress the pressure building behind his closed eyes. “I don’t know how to make this better, Harry. I don’t know what to do.” Draco’s shoulders trembled, but he refused to let himself fall apart completely when his intention had been to help
Every muscle in Harry’s body was aching, with exertion and with remorse. Everything went sour in the second half of the game. Harry had missed a pass to Angelina, Katie Bell had fouled on one of Beauxbatons’ center fielders, Alicia Spinnet had failed what should’ve been an easy goal. While it was a close game, they’d only lost by one goal, they had still
Rather than answering his boyfriend, Harry turned left and pulled into the parking lot of Joan of Art, one of the art supply stores he knew Draco liked. He practically heard Draco’s heart jump—and he definitely heard the excited squeal. Draco jumped out of the car immediately after it was parked, his smile wide and sparkling. Harry saw his grey eyes linger on all the bright colors of the storefront, the sweeping calligraphy and window marker drawings decorating the windows, the posters advertising different art exhibits months in advance.
It was nearing midnight when Harry finally left his dorm room that night; he’d told Dean that he would be leaving, just in case. The easiest part was getting through the common room. The prefect on duty was always asleep by this time in his shift. So, Harry just walked past him.
With a quick glance at Hermione, he leaned a little closer to Harry as he said, “I’m sorry, Pansy needs me. I have to go, sweetie, but I’ll be back as soon as I possibly can be, alright?” Harry opened his eyes, and Draco could almost see how hard Harry was working to believe that he would really be back. Draco squeezed his hand and kissed him lightly, before getting up and making his way to the door. Looking over his shoulder with his hand on the door handle, he saw Harry and Hermione settling back into sleep, and this time, Draco wasn’t nearly as bothered by Hermione’s hand in his soft hair.
After class, Draco quickly grabbed his things and headed straight for the library, barely giving a farewell to his friends as he left. He tried not to appear too rushed to the students that were surely heading to their common rooms.
Harry barely heard the ringing of his phone through the haze of sleep. Groaning, he fumbled to disentangle himself from his sheets, glancing at his clock—which told him it was half past midnight—before sitting up and picking up his phone.
Harry moved his lips from Draco’s, trailing across his cheek, mouthing at his jaw, and pulling his ear between his teeth. Shivers raced down Draco’s spine, goosebumps raised on his skin. He tried to muffle the guttural moan that slipped past his lips, but the blaring music made it impossible to hear. Harry moved down the pale column of Draco’s neck, alternating between soft kisses and sharp nips—the combination driving Draco senseless. His broad hands moved from the smaller boy’s hips to his thighs, gradually sliding up the fabric of his jeans, making him shiver in pleasure. Draco’s breaths were short and fast. His pulse beat against his ribs almost painfully.
“Don’t worry about it,” Pansy whispered, “Harry isn’t dating Cedric for a reason, Draco. If he wanted to be with him, he would be. But he wants to be with you. I can promise you that.”
“Aren’t you scared that we’ll lose this? This is our gateway to the championship cup. If we lose, we’re out. That’s it.”
Suddenly the door swung open to reveal Coach Hooch, her grey hair spikier than ever. Her piercing gaze immediately fell on Harry, then swept over each of the football players in the locker room. She looked at Theo, her face softening for the most minuscule of seconds before she turned to steel again.
The man’s scowl had deepened. His nose had wrinkled. His piercing grey eyes glared up at him, sweeping up and down his body, lingering on any place he found skin. His
Draco let his wickedly sharp grin spread and squeezed Harry’s hand. The memories of all the times throughout the game that Ferreira had come close to seriously injuring Harry played over and over again in his mind, acting as his fuel.
Harry chuckled and unlocked the car, opening the passenger side door and depositing Draco inside before getting in the driver’s side. He left the other four to figure out their own seating arrangement. Hermione ended up sitting in the middle since she was the smallest, with Theo behind Draco and Pansy on his lap, which left Blaise behind Harry.
Luckily, before Draco could fall any further into his downward spiral, Blaise nudged him in the ribs, perhaps a little too hard.
“Harry Potter! You and your boyfriend had better be decent within two minutes or so help me I will send someone to go fetch Professor McGonagall! I’m too tired to deal with whatever it is going on in there.”
Harry sat down on his bed with his head in his hands. Draco’s heart was beating double-time, his fingers were fidgeting.
Harry’s eyebrow rose and an amused smile quirked at his mouth. A long-suffering sigh blew out of his lips. “Alright, but only because you’re
“Well, Harry,” Pansy smirked, “your thoughts aren’t exactly known for their intellect or good sense.”
“I—um…” Ron’s eyes darted around to Pansy, Theo, and Blaise, ever so slightly shrinking into himself as he saw the stoniness that awaited him there. “I just… I want to apologize to you, Hermione. And you, Harry.” Hermione’s hands clamped down on the muscles of Harry’s shoulders, digging her fingers in to stifle their trembling. “I said a lot of stupid, nasty things to the both of you, and—and I really wish that I hadn’t. I’m so, so sorry.”
“I met Pansy when we were ten. She accused me of stealing her hair ribbons,” Draco chuckled, remembering how angry she had been, calling him a thief and a scoundrel. “Even though I hadn’t done it, I’d felt so awful for her that I asked my mother to pick out some new ribbons for me to give to her. She wouldn’t leave me alone afterward, so we just kind of stuck together.”
Now, as he fell asleep, Hermione took a moment to smile at how far he had come. She was glad that he was still able to let her in, to come to her. Harry’s breathing evened out, and Hermione settled down into the pillows to take a nap as well, her head on top of Harry’s.
“I was looking for you after the game, I just wanted to tell you how proud I am of you. You were amazing in that game today,” he tried for an assuring voice, hoping that he was getting through to him, “It doesn’t matter that the team didn’t win, you all did your best, and you did so much better than the last time you played against them.”
“Right, just follow me this way.” She grabbed a few menus out of a holder on the greeter’s stand and walked down the aisle to a circular booth in the corner. Once they were all seated, she set down the menus and said she would be back in a few minutes to take their orders. As she left, her eyes darted again to Harry, a speculative look in her eyes before she turned and walked away.
However, he felt a little bad about slinging his boyfriend over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes; there’s no way it was comfortable. So, Harry shifted him around, practically manhandled him, until he was carrying Draco bridal-style.
How would he explain to her how those words had tasted on his tongue? How could he make her see that he had hated himself for weeks after they had passed the threshold of his lips? How could he explain to her that he thought the deep, rich brown color of her skin was beautiful in every way?
. Draco was slightly shocked at his own thinking, the possessiveness that curled around his thoughts. But, he realized that he
There was more than one moment that he wished Hermione had been there—she hated missing these kinds of things, and she and Remus got along like wildfire—but he was happy.
The blond looked up, and Harry was met with the most stunning blue-grey eyes as they blinked open at him. The blush that rose to the boy’s face was completely visible through his pale skin, and redder than a tomato, his neck flushing as well.
Looking deep into Harry’s beautiful green eyes, finding a vulnerable spark inside, Draco said, “Harry Potter, I
Now, going on almost four hours, Draco was ready to sneak out of the parlor and curl in a ball on his bed. He felt as though he’d disconnected from his body, he was seeing everything through his eyes, but he didn’t feel anything. He needed an escape. However, there was a good chance that Lucius would notice his absence, and leaving his mother’s birthday party didn’t sound like something a decent son would do.
He felt Draco grab his hand under the table, squeezing so tightly he was sure his bones would snap. His touch was reassuring, grounding. He finally felt as if he could breathe again.
“You know,” Draco said while wiping at his face with a wet cloth in the bathroom, “you’re lucky you’re cute, or else I would really, really hate you right now.”
Draco had decided to go on a walk after Maths, to try and clear his head, despite the slight chill in the air on the grounds of the academy. He’d walked almost all the way around the grounds when he came to a stop at the football field; because there, leading the group of people running laps around the field, was Harry Potter. Harry, who was wearing a grey pair of shorts and a grey tank top, the latter of which was covered in sweat, like the rest of him. His glasses had seemingly disappeared from his nose, but as they turned a corner of the field, he seemed to be able to see just fine.
—he might have disappeared as soon as he opened his eyes, only to squint in the morning sunlight that filtered through his bed curtains. The fear he’d felt last night, the terror that something horrible had happened—he’d had a feeling that sleep would only torment him once he’d closed his eyes.
...surprise...?! I'm still alive! So, yeah, there's been quite a break between this chapter and the last one, and I'm so sorry for that, but I promise that I have some good excuses if you really want to hear them. But anyway, I hope all of my dearest readers like this chapter at least. I love you all <3
As the smaller boy understood the implications, Harry saw tears gathering in Draco’s eyes. His face collapsed, his other hand raised to his mouth. Harry’s gut twisted. The words tasted like poison coming from his mouth, he couldn’t imagine how it felt to hear them. To find out something so dark about someone you loved.
“He’s been at his parent’s house for the past few days—it was his mother’s birthday yesterday.” Harry looked at both Sirius and Remus, giving them his
Draco’s hands curled into fists as he stepped into Ron’s way, effectively stopping the other boy. Ron opened his mouth, a malicious glint in his eyes; Draco lifted a hand to stop him again.
“Theo, I hope you’re ready to work your ass off training because we have to get you in shape to go to the championship games. With Beauxbatons disqualified, we’re back in for the running.”
it was affection. He hoped that Harry would keep telling him things, that he would continue to trust him with the things he couldn’t tell anyone else.
, but the thought, the implication, of anyone else with Harry, holding his hand, cuddling in his bed, kissing him-
A comfortable silence fell about them. Harry realized that he had been missing moments like these—just being with his best friend. The person who knew him as no one else did. Whether it be going with her to her favorite book store at her insistence, dragging her outside for some sun, or simply just laying together like this, Harry realized that in the past few months, there hadn’t been as many of those moments as he would’ve liked.
Draco’s brow furrowed in bewilderment until the door opened and a familiar voice said, “Just so we’re clear, Harry, I’m only doing this because I know you’re exhausted.” Draco looked over his shoulder to see Hermione, holding a basket, an amused smile plastered on her face despite her words. “Draco, nice to see that you’ve finished your complaining over not seeing Harry.” Draco returned with a playful glare, huffing at her.
Not for the burning resentment in his chest. Not for the raging possessiveness he felt in his bones, for the ache to prove that Harry was
“Harry,” Draco said, swallowing past the lump in his throat and meeting Harry’s gaze, “please tell me we’re not actually going in there.”
Theo wasn’t a small person, he was only a fraction of an inch shorter than Harry himself, and he wasn’t exactly weak. He would be a challenge for Harry, but Harry was confident that he was more capable than the other boy.
he realized. Hermione leaned toward him from where she sat beside them, gripping his forearms and helping Harry sit up. The movement alone made Harry’s chest ache fiercely, biting back his wince.
“Harry—” Draco said from beside him, his pale hand reaching out for Harry’s bare shoulder. But Harry knew what was coming. He felt the bile rising in his throat, nausea completely overwhelming him.
Hearing Harry’s voice, if only those two words so far, instantly made Draco’s mind go quiet and nearly forget everything but
Finally, the bell rang for class to end, and Draco practically sang his gratitude for it being the last period of the day.
Almost as if in response, Harry’s hand plunged into his own shirt, the feel of his fingers on his chest, his stomach, his waist, was intoxicating. Draco’s mind was swirling with the smell of Harry, with the taste of him. His boyfriend ran his hand up the curve of his spine, dragging his shirt with him and making him shudder.
He needed to do something. Standing still wasn’t doing him any good, it only made the monster of anxiety writhe in the pit of his stomach. He could hear his heartbeat hammering in his ears. The pounding in his head was unrelenting.
Fred and George had been the one to tell him about the secret passages in the school. Harry had been thirteen at the time. This particular one was shorter than most of the others, just a tunnel staircase that led from the seventh floor to the third, oddly convenient in this case.
“I just,” Draco hesitated, “I just really like him, you know? And he likes me, and this is the first time that this has happened to me.”
“Harry,” Sirius said, quietly enough so no one around them might overhear, “how are you, really? Any new developments with Ron?”
Harry’s previously shocked face turned into one of anger and resentment. “What’s my deal?” he started, his voice deathly quiet, “Are you telling me that you’re not completely racist? That you haven’t used awful words against people who don’t deserve it?” Harry’s voice had gradually gotten louder, and Draco’s already pale face had gone even more so. Harry took a few steps towards Draco, who stepped back until he was at the wall. Harry didn’t come much closer, as if he couldn’t stand to be in such small proximity to him.
Draco felt the heat in his face but decided to retaliate. “Of course I am, I’m absolutely mesmerizing in anything I do, Potter.”
That didn’t mean that Draco didn’t want to kick a soccer ball into Ferriera’s head for targeting his boyfriend. Hard.
Brown eyes practically popped out of Theo’s eye sockets. “You… are you joking?” He hefted the first weight onto the opposite side of the bar. His gaze wandered down to Harry’s arms, then to his chest.
When they arrived at Harry’s car, all four of their friends were huddled around it, unprepared for the chill in the early spring air. Draco was still clinging to Harry’s back, but he didn’t mind carrying his lightweight boyfriend around if it made him happy and got him to eat.
“You start the water,” Harry said, his voice deep, gravelly, and low, “and I’ll be back with your things, okay?” His green eyes were so intense, so deep and focused on Draco. It was all the smaller boy could do to nod while Harry leaned forward to softly touch his lips to Draco’s cheek. He leisurely removed his fingers, taking a moment to skim over everything he could touch, and walked out the door, leaving it cracked behind him.
There were no telltale signs of anyone else in the dormitory; Harry assumed they had all left for classes already.
Draco’s arms tightened around Harry like he was assuring that yes, he really was there. Soft lips pressed against Harry’s skin, soothing and delicate kisses on his neck, his shoulder, under his ear.
Two days. Draco had already spent two days in Malfoy Manor, avoiding his father and trying to find a moment alone to talk with his mum—only she was being constantly bombarded with last-minute plans for the party that would be taking place the next night. He hadn’t been able to find a convenient time to just…
. He discovered that Draco’s neck and ears were particularly sensitive, and couldn’t resist kissing him there, biting and licking him, if only for the sake of extracting the whines and moans from his reluctant mouth.
When he finally managed to look up at Harry’s face, Draco saw his boyfriend smirking at him with an amused glint in his eyes. His face turned crimson as he realized,
He didn’t notice Draco coming towards him until the shorter boy was right in front of him. “Harry, is everything alright?” Draco’s eyes took in all of him, flickering between Harry’s eyes and the rest of his body.
There was paint smeared on both his face and Harry’s, though Harry had been mostly responsible for both. Draco had taken one look at the mess that was Harry’s “painting” and laughed so hard he’d snorted and fallen off of his painting stool. It was a horrendous rendition that could more accurately be interpreted as abstract art, rather than a portrait of his blonde boyfriend.
Harry could have exploded. Right at that moment, his heart combusted. His mind muddled every noise like he was underwater. He was in a sea of noise, crashing over him. He briefly registered Lee Jordan announcing their win, but he didn’t really hear the words. The sounds of cheering washed over him, but they couldn’t manage to sink in.
Instead of wallowing in his indecision, Draco shoved the feeling to the back of his mind for later examination and responded to Harry.
flowers?” When he looked up at Draco, there was an inquisitive yet analytical glint in Sirius’ eyes.
Hermione knew full well how Harry had been raised. It wasn’t a pretty story, filled with baby pictures, pastel rainbows, birthday parties, and fond memories. She could still remember the day she’d met him, when they had both been eleven, on the first day of school. Harry had been small, concerningly skinny, and couldn’t make direct eye contact with anyone. He’d been so… reduced. Diminished.
“Much better than anyone else I’ve met by far,” Sirius gloated. Harry couldn’t help but huff a slightly annoyed laugh and shove his shoulder. The snickers that came from both of them spoke of expired jokes and teasing that had lasted for months after Harry had gotten over the hurt.
A whirlwind of emotions—irritation, hurt, devastation, shame—all left Harry’s body in a long sigh through his nose. He slouched back onto his chair, carefully so as not to disturb Draco. “He… apologized to me. And Hermione. And I told him he needed to apologize to Draco. But… I don’t…”
He felt Harry lean closer into him as they walked, his breath fanning against the nape of his neck. “You,” he whispered, low and guttural in his ear, “are the sexiest creature I have
Laughter burst from Harry’s mouth, causing Pansy’s sharp grin to widen. He’d grown fond of her teasing in the past few months; she was something different, always keeping him on his toes.
Draco looked at Hermione for clarification, wondering what in the world his tired boyfriend was going on about. She mouthed,
“I need you to apologize to Draco.” Harry cut off Ron's protesting noise. “For what you said to him that day we lost to Beauxbatons. And to promise me that you won’t ever pull a dick move like that again.”
“It’s okay,” Draco murmured back, tugging ever so slightly on Harry’s hair. “I have more than enough brains for both of us.”
In some part of his mind, Harry had hoped that Ron would come around, that he would apologize and do his best to mend their torn friendship. But he’d gone and done that, and then ripped it apart. Again. Tore it to shreds.
If possible, Harry’s grip on him tightened more, pressing every inch of their bodies together as he kissed him. Draco never could have gotten tired of the butterflies that fluttered in his chest every time Harry kissed him like this, firm and gentle and intoxicating all at once. Each movement of his mouth sent a thrill of warmth through his body, and he knew that these next few days would be unbelievably cold without Harry to keep him warm.
“Well,” Harry said, looking up to scan over his little escort group, “Theo, I’ll see you at practice on Monday.”
Harry felt his boyfriend’s warm breath on his skin as he wound his arms around him; one across Draco’s lower back, drawing him as close as humanly possible, his other hand cradling Draco’s head. He wished that he could be zipped into the same skin with Draco. He wanted to hold him closer than this, to be wrapped up with him in every way possible.
An exploding pain ruptured in Harry’s chest. His lungs weren’t working. He couldn’t breathe. His vision blurred and he swore he could hear Hermione talking to him, to someone, but it was all too muffled to make anything out.
Some glimmer of light returned to Harry’s eyes. It was like a fog had cleared, or a haze he’d finally seen through. A sense of relief poured through Draco when he felt Harry’s fingers twine with his own.
Draco pressed himself closer to Harry’s side, wrapping his arms around the taller boy’s waist, never looking away from his green eyes. He set his chin on Harry’s chest, just looking at him.
He seemed high off of his team’s victory, shown in the way that the grin couldn’t leave his face even as Draco kissed him, in the way that his hands never left Draco’s body, in the way that he laughed with his whole body. Draco practically bathed in it all—he didn’t think he’d ever seen Harry so blissed out, with a few exceptions, of course.
Finally, a particularly hard shove from Blaise, who had come out of nowhere, got him moving again. He walked as if on autopilot, just taking the necessary steps he needed to get to his next class. It was his last for the day. Afterward, he could contemplate and overanalyze what had happened.
Draco shifted closer to the door, which creaked when he accidentally touched it. He didn’t dare to breathe, the silence that fell over the two in the hall was deafening in its intensity.
Draco snorted as he disentangled himself from Harry and stood on his own two feet with his hands on his hips. “I meant what I said.” He leaned over and grabbed Harry’s shirt that he’d dropped, only to toss it at him, smacking him right in the face. “I’m going to take full advantage of your promise. So, I suggest you put on your shirt so I can start.”
Concentration was impossible. And Draco had tried everything. He’d thrown himself into his assignments during class, hung off every word Professor Binns droned, read every single word in the history textbook assignment, but nothing worked. His thoughts always came back around to Cedric Diggory.
Harry shook his head as Hermione laid her hand on his shoulder. All Harry could see was Uncle Vernon shutting the door of his little cupboard under the stairs, shouting at him for talking back, those awful names-
When Pansy, Blaise, and Theo sat down, they made sure to have Draco next to Harry. But Draco noticed that Harry seemed to be down a friend.
“Aw, but Harry,” Draco crooned with a wide grin, drawing a finger down the line of Harry’s nose, “it was
) and stood before him with his hands on his hips, what he hoped was a stern expression upon his face.
Harry ran a hand through Draco’s hair, a thrill of pleasure running down his spine. The smaller boy was trying to comprehend what he’d just heard, what he’d just been told.
Sirius seemed to notice this as he nodded, quickly glancing over at Remus—who was intently typing away on his phone—before looking back at Draco.
for rest. And while he loved being able to help her, his conversation with Pansy at breakfast had only depleted him further—memories, especially
He’d gone into overdrive, his senses taking over him. Draco had no idea how much Harry had paid for everything, he’d been too busy fantasizing about using all his new products every morning.
The only reply Harry gave was an affirmative hum. He was far too busy simply taking in the entity that was the boy before him—Draco’s bright eyes, his elegantly sharp cheekbones, his lean frame, his jaw that was so defined he could cut himself on it. His taut stomach and navel. The distinct lines of his hips revealed by his low-rise jeans.
potential that Harry was sure he would be able to whip up into a formidable player in no time. He had been able to give Theo the spot on the team without favoritism clouding his judgment. Cedric had tried to corner him afterward, but Harry had efficiently put him in his place, as gently as he could manage. Afterward, Draco had practically dragged him to his dorm room, an easel and his assorted paints awaiting them.
Harry opened his eyes again to look at Hermione, who nodded in agreement. He waited a moment, waiting for Draco to complain again about leaving the couch or not being hungry, but his boyfriend seemed to have tuned everyone out in favor of burying his face in Harry’s neck.
“I guess I’m worried about all of them,” Draco confessed, he looked down at his hands, then looked back up at Professor Babbling, who was still going on with an incredibly boring lecture that was supposed to be incredibly important.
Draco thought as Hermione walked up to them. She smiled softly at him, which was more than a surprise.
Shaking his head, Draco pulled his shirt over his head and tugged on his shoes. Harry opened the door to reveal a very tired and slightly ticked off Seamus Finnigan.
My dearest readers, I'm seriously so sorry that this chapter is so late. There's been so much going on, my life has been so hellish and for the past two weeks... this chapter was sooo hard to write, and I'm so sorry that it's not as good as usual, so I hope you accept this apology and don't hate me too much.
Yet, Draco wasn’t ignorant enough to think that Harry’s therapy sessions were anywhere near the same as the ones Draco had been to.
Draco furrowed his brow in concern. Harry sounded dejected, morose. As if someone had kicked his puppy and run away laughing. The sparkle that usually resided in his eyes had gone out, he looked exhausted, his shoulders were slumped and his smile was shaky at best. Draco reached across the table and interlaced his fingers with Harry’s as he said, “Harry, will you tell me what’s wrong?” Draco was certain that his hand fit perfectly in the other boy’s, and he immediately felt the warmth that seemed to constantly surround him.
“You don’t… you don’t think it's too soon? Like I might be pushing him into something?” Harry stopped for a moment before continuing, “I don’t want to do that to him, I don’t want to pressure him into being stuck with me, Hermione.”
Taking the phone from his ear, Draco hung up. His hand fell to his lap. He seemed… numb. Harry pushed himself up into a sitting position, reaching out for him but giving him plenty of time to pull away. Draco allowed himself to be pulled against Harry’s chest, halfway in his lap.
They had arrived at Draco’s common room door. Draco didn’t want Harry to leave, he wanted for him to say more about how he loved spending time with Draco, more about how he wanted to do this again, more about how he couldn’t bear to cut the day short.
“The rest is strictly confidential best friend stuff. Completely classified. Very hush-hush type of thing.” Harry smiled teasingly, bumping Draco’s shoulder with his own. Draco would never admit it, but he almost fell over. It was at that moment that Draco realized how small Draco was compared to Harry. Sure, he was only a few inches shorter, but Harry was much broader, and he had more muscle by far. Draco was by no means weak, he liked to play football as much as the next person, but Harry was a whole different kind of strong.
“I think,” Harry started, trying to swallow past the hurt in his throat, “I think that I need to get to class. I don’t want to be late to first hour.” He stood up from the couch, grabbed his bag, and started walking towards the door. But he paused, looked over his shoulder at Ron, and said, “Come talk to me when you get your head outta your arse.” Hermione stood up again and follow him out the door.
He had only failed to capture the emotions that those green eyes always carried. Draco knew that he’d never be able to get them right unless he was looking at those eyes while he drew them. He just didn’t know what Harry would think if he saw Draco’s hands in action.
High-pitched laughter bubbled out of Narcissa’s mouth as she gently shoved her son’s shoulder. Draco only watched her, leaning heavily on the headboard and trying to calm his frantic heartbeat. Once her laughter quieted, he slid down the headboard to lay his head on her thigh. He felt hands come to rest on his shoulders, fingers softly tracing circles onto his t-shirt.
“It’s nightmares,” Harry muttered. His hands moved to wrap around Draco’s waist, drawing him closer. “They’ve been bad for the past few days. I just thought that if… If I just exhausted myself during the day, I wouldn’t have any dreams at all.” Harry’s fingers tightened on Draco’s light sweater. He shifted his head so his face was buried in the crook of Draco’s neck, his warm breath fanning over Draco’s skin.
Harry had never been so wound up for a football game. Well, not one that he could remember at the moment. The last time Hogwarts’ football team had played against Beauxbatons Institute, Oliver Wood had been captain, and they’d lost. Drastically. The memories were still ingrained in Harry’s mind; how Oliver had stayed strong in the face of defeat, the manner in which he had managed to cheer up the team despite their bitter moods. Despite
“Hermione’s looking for you, Harry,” George said. He caught sight of the scowl Draco was aiming his way and scooted down the couch a few inches. “She seemed kind of upset.”
There was a thump on the other side of the curtains. Then a groan. One that sounded distinctly like Theo.
A charged sort of silence fell over them. He practically felt the questions brewing under Draco’s skin, begging to be released. Harry tried to convey in his gaze that it was okay for him to ask his questions, to get them out of the way now.
Harry—whether it be curled together on the couch in the southern common room or going for a run around the school’s grounds or kissing him senseless in some abandoned classroom—made a hand of yearning wrap itself around his heart. And that feeling warred with his love for his mother. How could he possibly want to be anywhere than at his mother’s side, celebrating her birthday? Sure, he hadn’t actually been able to see much of her, and his father had been avoiding him as much as Draco had been avoiding his father—but shouldn’t he feel at least a little bit happy to be back at home? Shouldn’t he be relieved at having a few days to himself?
“Can I at least guess where we’re going?” Draco asked, trying to fill the silence that had become deafening.
After finishing the descent, he opened the exiting door- a large rectangular painting- and scanned the area before departing and closing it behind him. The abandoned classroom that Draco had referred to wasn’t exactly close to his current position. So, with careful and quiet steps, he set off down this hallway, keeping his ears open for any footsteps, his eyes peeled for any telltale signs of a professor coming his way.
Pansy’s words skidded to a stop. All sounds were drowned out by the startled screams around them. Luckily, a few level-headed students, Blaise and Draco included, quickly rushed to their dorms to grab flashlights.
“Harry, how did you even-” she paused, shaking her head in his chest, “I suppose it doesn’t matter how, just that you did. So thank you, Harry. This was
The bell rang, and Draco immediately left his seat, aiming to get to the halls before Pansy could hold him back. She caught up to him easily, shoving other kids out of her way until she was at his side.
is unbelievable.” Hermione’s small hand clenched Harry’s shirt, just loose enough to avoid choking him—but he didn’t mind. He understood the feeling.
At least until Harry kissed over his chest and discovered how sensitive Draco’s nipples were. Then he tossed his head back onto the pillows and his kiss-swollen lips dropped open with a sultry, nearly obscene moan, and he was drowning in the sensations of Harry touching him in all the right ways. And although it was an oddly new sort of feeling—somewhat awkward and uncomfortable at first—he found he quite liked having Harry’s fingers inside him.
The boy on the tile floor didn’t get the chance to respond. His stomach muscles convulsed, and his head pounded painfully as his stomach continued its nearly violent revolt. His abdomen ached. The skin on his back felt sore with the stain of his dream.
“Harry, Ron didn’t mean those things he said. He’ll come to his senses, I’ll talk to him. I don’t really understand why he’s being like this, I told him that Malfoy apologized, I told him that I was okay with you and him,” Hermione explained.
Although seeing his boyfriend and his mother shake hands and smile kindly at each other warmed the pit of Draco’s stomach, watching Harry and his father glower at each other was reasonably frustrating. The scowl on his father’s face was nothing new to Draco—he’d been on the receiving end of it more than his fair share. But the stony, icy expression on Harry’s face? Draco could use the fingers on one hand to count the number of times he’d seen it.
“Here, look at me,” Draco whispered. His fingers gently grasped at Harry’s chin and pulled him to face him. He held a damp washcloth in his other hand and began gently dabbing at Harry’s mouth.
She stopped less than three feet away from them, but Draco didn’t seem to notice her. Regret was woven through her words as she spoke, “Take care of him, Harry.”
“That’s awful, Harry. I’m so sorry,” Draco gave Harry’s hand a squeeze, and tried to give him a reassuring smile. He took Harry’s hand and started tracing shapes on his palm.
“Right, show me what you know.” Harry stepped back and gestured with his hand for Draco to hit the bag.
Gently, Harry removed Draco’s arms and turned to his locker, leaving Draco slightly puzzled for a moment. Then Harry quickly pulled on his briefs under the towel he wore before whisking it off and sitting on the bench next to Draco.
It's finally here! This took forever to write, and I really hope that it's not complete and utter trash. I hope you all enjoy this one! It's a lot longer than I first anticipated.
A rumbling hum came from the deepest part of Harry’s chest. His head tilted back of its own volition, his eyes fluttered closed. Those dainty hands explored Harry’s abdomen, back, and chest with light touches before pale arms wrapped around his hips.
Narcissa closed the trunk just as Harry reached the driver’s side door. She stopped in front of him. And then tugged him down into a hug.
from him) Conversation between Theo and Blaise sputtered out, and he could feel Draco’s attention shift away from his papers.
“Ah!” Sirius exclaimed, leaning his chair back like a teenager in a boring classroom. “A kindred spirit! My parents were the exact same way, Draco. My entire family, really. Believe me when I say that I understand how it feels. But,” Sirius stared intently at Draco, who clenched Harry’s hand, “I basically said screw it and did what
He shifted his head, nuzzling his cheek against Draco’s, the tip of his nose caressing the sensitive skin under Draco’s ear. The fingers in Harry’s hair lightly scratched against his head.
Draco stood from his chair and walked around the table to stand in front of Harry, which seemed to effectively shut him up.
Draco had so many things wandering through his head that he didn’t even notice that Harry had started walking forward without him. Harry paused and looked back, seeming to notice that his blond wasn’t there.
There was no real reason for Draco to hesitate like this. He should have already busted down the door and demanded to know where Harry was from the first person he saw.
Oh! Also, I got a tumblr account and a blog and everything so maybe go follow me there, where Shoulder Pillow is cross posted: @musicdreamer003
“Haha, very funny.” With a small laugh, Hermione’s head fell back onto his stomach, scrolling through his phone.
Draco had had to sneak out of Harry’s dorm room early the next morning after waking up tangled with him in his sheets. Everything in him had been reluctant to leave the sleeping boy, wanted to stay for as long as he could, and simply gaze at the peacefulness in Harry’s face. He’d wanted to relish in the warmth and intimacy that came from being pressed so tightly to Harry’s smooth, bare skin. Well over ten minutes had been spent simply tracing the lines of Harry’s body—softly over his face, his collarbones, down the entirety of his muscled abdomen. The thrum of his boyfriend’s strong heartbeat against Draco’s own chest seemed to beg him to stay.
Draco’s smile widened into a full-blown grin. He stood from his desk chair, pacing before he responded.
Draco leaned into her hand, relishing in the fleeting feeling of her fingers carding through his hair. It was a completely different sensation than when Harry did it; her nails were sharper, and the feeling of her motherly love flowered in his chest. “He really is, Mum. And I don’t just
Sirius recounted the same sentiment, yet even to Harry’s bewilderment, he pulled Draco into a hug—loose enough to not be overbearing and short enough to not be completely awkward. When Sirius pulled back, he snorted in laughter at the dumbstruck expression on Draco’s face and patted his shoulder, effectively making the blush in his cheeks brighter and more prominent.
The professor’s eyes glared down at Harry as he sneered, “You would be best suited to learn to hold your tongue in my class, Mr. Potter.”
“Narcissa, please,” she corrected. A wave of fondness swept over him as he nodded his head. She looked past both of them at Harry’s car, saying, “You get him in the car, I’ll put the bags in the trunk.”
As he opened the case, the familiar smell of paper, ink, pencils, and all his other supplies infiltrated his nose. And as he finally set pencil to paper, he started to draw again.
Finally, Harry allowed himself to close his heavy eyelids, to give in to the exhaustion that had been weighing on him. He felt each muscle release its tension and relax. Thoughts blurred together and his body fell completely limp, not bothering to shift around to find a more comfortable position.
“It was lovely to meet you, Draco,” Remus said. He shook Draco’s hand that wasn’t encased in Harry’s with a warm smile. The slightly surprised but pleased glimmer in Draco’s eyes had Harry’s smile growing ever further.
“I know.” Teddy pouted, his hands going up to mess with his hair. “But! Mama says we can make it bluer.”
“Father,” Draco said, stepping back to stand beside Harry, hooking two of his fingers with two of Harry’s, “Mum—Mother, this is Harry. My… boyfriend.”
After they shared a laugh, a comfortable sort of quiet took over them. It was like they were both simply basking in knowing that the other was there, even if not in person. Draco nibbled at his bottom lip, debating on how to bring up what he’d really wanted to talk about. His fingers twitched. Burning heat had already rushed to his face, and he hadn’t even said anything yet.
A gentle smile graced Draco’s lips, a hum resounded in the back of his throat as a response. Stretching his stiff limbs, he swiftly turned over himself to face the other boy. Harry’s raven hair was ruffled against his pillow, his green eyes heavy-lidded with the remnants of sleep, the corners of his lips were upturned in the beginnings of a tired smile. His fingers began tracing the lines of Draco’s ribs, caressing the divot of his spine, stroking up and down the skin on his chest and stomach. Every touch sent a burst of warmth through Draco, flowing through his veins.
So when Harry grabbed his hand and took him to his dorm room, Draco ripped it away as soon as the door closed behind them.
The blush on Draco’s face deepened impossibly, and the satisfied smirk only grew on Harry’s. He loved how his words still affected Draco, still made him flush red and drop his gaze as if he was feeling shy.
Wetting his lips, Draco gave himself a moment’s hesitation before answering. “I want you. Hell, I want all of you, Harry.” If possible, his face felt even hotter and his heart pounded even faster. “I just… I thought that maybe it would be a good idea to talk about it before anything happened, you know?”
Every instinct in Harry’s body was at war with one another, some telling him to run, others urging him to turn and punch the red-headed dimwit in the jaw. Neither sounded like it would do him any good in the long run. He felt more than saw his friends stop walking, felt their silence fall around him. He felt Hermione’s presence appear at his side, calming and unwavering; felt Draco squeeze his hand before he turned to look at the person he hadn’t talked to in months. The person he’d called his friend.
Letting out a deep sigh, he answered, “I don’t know, really. I guess I just always figured that if either of them had some of my dad’s stuff, then they would’ve shown me or given it to me by now… I don’t think I’ve ever really asked.”
Draco pressed his lips to Harry’s temple, nuzzling his hair and sliding his hands from Harry’s shoulders to his waist and around to his stomach, tracing random shapes and circles onto his shirt. Harry could feel his boyfriend’s gentle smile against his skin, his delicate fingers leaving cool trails on his skin through his worn shirt. He felt Draco’s heartbeat through his back, his own falling in time to match the rhythm. An almost drowsy feeling filled his head—only it was less like sleepiness and more like he was drunk on relaxation.
“If Petunia has your mum’s stuff,” she continued, as if he hadn’t said anything, “then where did your dad’s things go?” Hermione tucked herself closer into Harry’s side to avoid getting jostled by the other students, wrapping her arm around his hips until her thumb was tucked into the belt loop at his other side to avoid getting separated. “I mean, if Sirius or Remus had it, then you would’ve known already, right?”
Seeing her again was… an interesting experience, to say the least. He had always considered her a friend, but they weren’t particularly close. But with the way she had acted earlier, it was like they’d only grown closer in the time he’d been gone. It had been… a
Harry to be his. He didn’t want anyone else holding his hand, he didn’t want anyone else touching his skin. He wanted to be
“There was no one else?” Draco could sense the dislike towards his relatives rolling off of Harry in waves. His words had a sharp edge—as if he wished he could use them to cut any ties to his aunt and uncle.
“Is he alright?” Draco asked softly, not wanting to wake Harry, “I waited for him outside the locker rooms, but he never came out.” He took a moment to glance at Hermione before continuing, “I just…
“Do you feel okay to tell me what’s been going on?” Sirius continued. “Or do you want to sleep first? I can call you tomorrow and we can talk then.”
with him in the halls?” Harry asked, “Because if you’re not okay with it, even a little bit-” Hermione stopped him with a simple raise of her brow. “Harry, I do think that he meant what he said. It’ll take some getting used to, seeing my best friend with a boy I’ve hated for so long. But I think, I think that I’m okay with it,” she paused, her lips twisting in a conspiratorial smile, “Just don’t tell him that. I think I’m looking forward to seeing how long he’ll grovel at my feet for.”
Draco looked over at him and bumped his shoulder with his own, more like the middle of his upper arm, if he were being honest with himself, and murmured, “I had fun, Harry. I really liked being with you today.”
The captain turned away from the door, opting for the back exit instead. He felt awful, of course, leaving his boyfriend out there waiting for him. He never wanted to make Draco feel unwanted, undesirable, rejected. But he couldn’t make himself go through that door.
“Remus,” Harry greeted with a wide grin on his face, hugging the man after he stood up, “I think your kids have given you a few more grey hairs, mate.”
But somehow, this time felt different. He wouldn’t have the comfort of knowing that Harry was somewhere in the same building as him, not even a ten minute walk away. He wouldn’t have the luxury of just popping in Harry’s common room to see him, or staying the night in his warm bed.
His mind eventually started drifting to what was waiting for him in that abandoned classroom. Draco hadn’t actually said what they were doing, but with the way he’d asked, Harry was sure he had an accurate idea. He just wasn’t sure he was exactly on board. Of course, he thought Draco was attractive, he was absolutely
Harry could only think of ways to murder Ron slowly, and Hermione laying curled on herself on the couch. He could feel his fists clenching with violence, his blood boiling, his jaw muscles fluttering.
Elation bubbled up inside him as he heard the crowds cheering, and he saw the same emulated in Theo’s eyes. Their newest player looked shocked—like he hadn’t really expected to win. Like he hadn’t envisioned going farther into the championships.
When they finally parked in Hogwarts’ garage, Draco had fallen asleep with his head against the window. As Harry got out of the car, he decided to leave his boyfriend’s things in the trunk until morning. He gently shook Draco awake, but the boy only latched onto his neck with his eyes still closed, so Harry carefully lifted him up and out of the car, clutching him close to his body. Draco’s legs wrapped around his hips and his head lolled onto Harry’s shoulder.
Looking at a drowsy Harry, suddenly regretting the words that had just come out of his mouth, he replied:
Memories flashed unbidden through his head—the paralyzing fear he’d felt when he first saw the letter from Petunia, the haunting nightmares that had been relentlessly plaguing him, the anxiety over both his future and his past, all of it. Harry’s heart squeezed and ached with the force of them, his head felt both light and heavy, the overwhelming emotions made him let out a choked breath.
But nothing Draco had been told could have made him love Harry any less. No, Draco had made a promise to himself—he would be there for Harry. (He didn’t have the exact words to explain what he felt in his head. Or in his heart, for that matter. It was like the parts of Harry that had confused him before, suddenly made sense. Harry hadn’t changed. He hadn’t deceived Draco or tricked him into thinking he was someone he wasn’t. It was… another piece of the puzzle that was Harry Potter. Draco would always wish that those years of abuse and torment had never happened—but he couldn’t change that. He could only offer Harry his heart, and stay by his side through the nightmares)
Had he finally become too much of a failure for him? Had the anxiety in the back of his mind finally become a reality? Had he finally said too much, revealed too many ugly truths?
Draco’s heart skipped a beat, then started pounding double-time. He felt nearly light-headed. He crushed his lips to Harry’s, bringing his body as close to the other boy’s as possible. His chest pressed into Harry’s, his hands ran up and down his strong shoulders. He wanted to be zipped into the same skin with him, he wanted to learn every inch of him, he wanted to touch him and taste him and
Harry slowly wrapped his arms around her in return. She knew he was taking the loss hard; she knew a lot more than that, actually. After slowly extracting herself from his embrace, Hermione took his hands and led him up to his dorm room. His every step was sluggish and heavy. When they reached his room, Harry tumbled onto his bed, curling into himself in what resembled fetal position, facing the wall.
“It’s… the doctors have told him that it’s most likely a cross between a panic and anxiety attack, but they’re not really sure,” Hermione explained. Draco recalled Harry mentioning in passing that he’d had panic attacks before, but he hadn’t ever imagined anything like this. “They don’t usually last much longer, but nothing we’ve done before is helping. It’s like he can’t hear me.”
he thought, shifting so he could sit beside her. The smell of vanilla rolled off Narcissa in waves; the smell ignited a million locked away memories, reminding him of the good moments of his childhood.
Blaise sighed from her other side, blatantly glaring at Theo’s sharp smirk before turning back to Pansy with sad eyes. “How did you find out?”
“Well then, I’m glad you’re back.” She gestured to the entirety of the store. “Go look around, we’ve added a lot of new things since you’ve been here.”
Later that night, sleep found Draco easily. All the worry that had been niggling away at his brain had been silenced. Contentment and peace seemed to wrap around him, brought about by simply replaying Harry’s words over and over in his mind.
Draco laughed as Harry scooped him up and kissed him, smiling against his lips. He wrapped his arms around the bigger boy’s shoulders, holding on tightly when Harry spun him around in a circle. Harry pulled away, beaming at him with so much excitement in his green eyes.
Harry watched as the front doors opened. A man with shoulder-length white-blond hair stepped out of the farther driver’s side door, dressed in a lavish black suit and holding a cane in his pale hand. Harry felt a surge of combined nervousness and animosity hit him like a punch to the stomach just looking at Lucius Malfoy.
Just then, the waitress returned with an expectant look on her face. Everyone quickly picked something off the menus—most likely completely botching the pronunciation—and ordered before she left again. Draco cuddled deeper into Harry’s body, savoring his warmth for the rest of lunch.
