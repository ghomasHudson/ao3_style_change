to ground himself.
He hurried out of the dorm and common room, dressed and all, waking no one, and rushed to the Great Hall for breakfast. There, he tried to focus on eating his breakfast and not think of how to break the news to Ginny, so it relieved him when his friends entered the Hall not long after he had.
“Yeah.”
When I was plotting this story (which is rare as I’m a pantser most of the time), I got the idea for an ‘epilogue’ from when they’re older (adults in thirties). I didn’t put too much thought in it, and wrote it more for myself. But I decided to add it either way for if anyone would like it. There are a some changes from canon that I can’t really see happening, but thought it would be cute. Some might, though, so there you go. But for those who will read it, I won’t spoil too much. Take in mind, it’s pretty cringe.)
Weasley let out a low sound scarily close to a growl. “You git,” he said between gritted teeth. Draco winked mockingly at him.
Warning!
Weasley visibly tensed up as he tried to keep his eyes on Potter. “I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word—“
Draco was walking through the corridor, on his way back from Charms, preparing himself for a calm weekend, before someone violently grasped his arm, pulling him out of his thoughts and into a dark alcove. He was about to call for help, his left hand already moving towards his pocket for his wand, as a soft, female voice spoke in his ear.
“I’m going to check it out,” he announced, standing up and leaving the Hall. If Potter was causing a scene like this, something serious had to be going on. And Draco had a strong feeling of his involvement in it all. And indeed...
-than-average cock jumped free against his stomach) and slathering his dick with lube. He hurriedly settled behind Draco, who suppressed the urge to laugh.

“Perhaps,” Harry said as he captured Draco’s wrist and pulled him on top of himself. “It’s true. He’s a cute, tiny, hyperactive idiot and I love him. That’s one of the reasons why I fought with Molly today.”
I hope you guys enjoyed that. I still plan to finish this fic at.... some point in the future, haha.
And that was the thought that broke her. The image of Draco in a coffin. A headstone with a horribly quick death date on it. The idea of visiting a graveyard on his birthday instead of being able to hug the dramatic and wonderful son she loved more than life itself.
After reading your letter, I took a moment this morning to reflect on my actions last night. I took (as I do most nights) some Dreamless Sleep. I never drink a full bottle - not anymore. In the months immediately following the war, I was taking a full bottle every night. It was the only way I could ensure I would sleep. On nights that I didn’t take it, that’s when the nightmares came. It was just easier to keep taking the potion and it’s been even easier to just carry on. A few drops are enough now, but one day I would like to dream again without fear of my dreams being invaded by Voldemort. I don’t know if that’s something you can help with, but telling you about it is a start, right?
Draco chuckled. “I bet she would have made a spreadsheet to go with it too.”
He hadn’t even made it to the sofa when he began to cry, so he just sat down on the floor and let it all wash over him. People talking about Astoria without respect, or as if she didn’t matter or had never even existed, always set him off. It was such a painful reminder of the gaping black hole inside of him, the void left in his life and the life of his son that could never be filled no matter how much everyone else loved them. There would just always be something missing inside of him, and he and Scorpius would just have to learn how to live with that but
“It hasn’t been that long if you still can’t say it.” Suddenly Andy squeezed his hand. “There’s no hurry to grieve or recover, dear. No one’s rushing you. Especially not your mother or Harry.” She sat back in her chair and followed his gaze to the kitchen. Harry had gotten flour in his hair despite the fact that he was now making a salad before getting started on the pancakes. “You’ve caught a good one with him. Hot-headed at times, but nothing you can’t handle.”
And what the hell was he doing with Scorp’s upbringing anyway? Attaching his name to a child was a cruel act no one deserved. He should have accepted the offer of the Greengrass family to raise Scorpius. It would have been the better choice. But that would mean giving up on his only son, giving up on the last piece of Astoria that he had. He hadn’t wanted that.
“Daddy!” Scorpius cried between sobs. An irritated Molly Weasley stood next to him, a ladle in one hand and a deep frown on her face.
The Weasley matriarch had made it her job to care for her again.
.” Harry gently pried Draco’s arms loose, which he’d tightly wrapped around himself before. That way Harry could properly spoon him, and Draco both hated and loved how safe that made him feel. Malfoys don’t need affection, but Draco still wanted it.
Draco’s smile had something nostalgic as he thought of that, before he shook his head and turned back to the present. “You did good by telling her to let you go.”
“If Scorpius is okay with it,” Harry blurted before Draco could even finish asking. “My kids have been calling you their second dad for a while now. I’m surprised you didn’t notice.”
“Then you go to sleep.” Harry shot Scorpius an encouraging smile. “I promise me and your dad will be right there when you wake up.”
“Oh surely I can’t be the only one thinking Puddlemere will win this year.” Ginny Weasley had retired from quidditch a few years ago, but that didn’t stop her from loudly discussing it with her brother. Draco hadn’t paid much attention to them, until suddenly his name was used. “Anyone with half a brain can see that, right Malfoy? You’re about the only person at this table with more than two brain cells and a quidditch interest.”
Anyhow, comments and kudos are of course very welcome and loved and they feed my writer's soul, and if you have a character idea for a POV, then pls let me know in the comments. I can't promise anything, but maybe I'll get inspired!
He hoped Draco would get a good night of sleep, surrounded by people who loved him. Because they did, mental breakdowns and depressions included. No matter how long the road to recovery was.
Somehow though, along the way, Harry had lost sight of that dream. His job demanded more, Draco started making an issue about Harry’s many hospital visits, a couple of big undercover cases forced them apart for a few weeks and somehow the dream had faded from Harry’s mind.
Scorpius was already almost asleep while Draco brushed his teeth for him, something he did the Muggle way because Scorp hated the charms, so he carried him from the bathroom to the bed. Once tucked in Draco proceeded to sing a French lullaby his mother had taught him once. He knew his son was already asleep and probably didn't hear him, but it was tradition so he went with it.
“Where are we sleeping then, Daddy?” Scorpius asked between two yawns. “Here, or in the other house?”
Harry let out a small chuckle, and brushed a lock of hair out of Draco’s face. “He always gets like this, you know? Too high and mighty for as much as a handshake during the day, but violently clingy as soon as exhaustion hits.”
I regret so many of my decisions in the past, but saving you is not one of them and neither is testifying for you. I would really, really like to at least try to be friends with you. You have helped me more than you know during the exchanging of our letters and I will forever be grateful for them, even if you decide you don’t want anything more to do with me (I really hope you don’t decide that).
Draco shook his head. “Not even me.”
“You don’t have to know, okay?” Neville rubbed slow circles on Draco’s back, hoping he’d calm down soon because he actually felt better, not because he’d force himself to suck it up. “It’s nearly two am, this isn’t the time for discovering the secrets of the universe. It’s time for milky tea, ginger biscuits and some love.”
Of course Narcissa was happy to take him, as she made clear while Draco knelt down to give the finishing touches to Scorpius’ braids. It made him look a bit like a girl, but Draco had honestly never cared about that. His father’s rules about being a ‘good man’ were probably just as much bullshit as his rules about being a proper pureblood.
That was the first word to come up. Everything was heavy, as if gravity had suddenly tripled. Or maybe he was being held down by something. It couldn’t be water because he didn’t feel wet or cold, but maybe warm sand…
“Just relax, Draco, please.” Harry chuckled as he spotted Draco’s annoyed glare.
As for being your therapist, only you can decide on that. I will tell you who I am as well, once I know who you are (which I don’t know yet since I reply to your letter as I read). Once the anonymity of this exchange is gone, you would not be the first person to decide to call quits. I want you to know that you are absolutely at liberty to do that, and I will not be mad in any way, and I will not be hurt by it even if you want to discontinue because of who I am. You can request a different correspondent, no matter the reason.
hug his best friend.
“Oh Draco.” Suddenly warm, strong arms were around him, hugging him close, fingers massaging his back while their owner whispered sweet nothings in his ear. “I knew from your colleagues you were bad but I didn’t know it had gotten this far. I would have come so much sooner if I had.”
“Magical kisses are not that serious, Uncle Harry.” She offered because her Uncle Harry was looking almost constipated and that wasn’t the way to go at all. “They’re just light
As for talking to your owl, I wish I had been that wise in my early years, I think my friends would have appreciated that over me always complaining about everything to them. Now that I think about it, maybe that was why I got a rubber duck in my second year as a Christmas present. That always puzzled me until now.
as Draco always called it. And Draco was the one to help him with all his classes, going on long and entertaining rants about goblin wars, myths behind the constellations and the beauty of a well brewn potion.
Harry got a thoughtful look on his face, and for a moment Draco feared he would suggest something stupid like a holiday or a sauna visit or a massage. As if he could ever relax during those things when he still had Scorpius to worry about. But instead Harry changed the subject, and said, “We still have to pop by the supermarket, unless we want our kids to starve.”
. “Fuck me sideways, Pans. I just can’t, that guy is going to kill me and he doesn’t even know I exist.”
“You know I don’t like it when you do that.”
“Anything you’d like to tell me?” Neville gently asked as he put down the tray.
“Oh babe…” Harry pushed his fingers through Draco’s hair, shocked at what he’d heard. “I’m so sorry, love. But my family doesn’t hate you. They’re a bunch of overprotective nutters, but they don’t hate you. Sirius is my Godfather, remember? He knows what it’s like.”
the water out of his hands, not watch it leak away. He wanted to do
“You are?” Draco’s eyes grew wide and when he turned his head to properly look at his man, it was all he could do not to melt. It wasn’t fair how Harry could turn him into a puddle with one single bloody glance, it just wasn’t. Though he wasn’t really glancing, he was looking with glee as he watched Draco realise what his words meant.
“It’s fine, I just got up too fast.” He dismissed Harry’s concern with a shake of his head, which only made him more dizzy. Despite everything he chuckled at his own dumb behaviour. “Merlin, I’m a mess.”
“That’s what Harry calls it.” Draco’s voice was small, almost inaudible. When Neville began to prepare the tea and Draco spoke again, he almost didn’t hear it because of that. “Not sure I’ll hear him say that again.”
“So much has changed since then.” Harry sighed suddenly after a few minutes of silence. “
Draco’s face grew even harder, and his eyes and voice were now icy cold. “Body language is also a thing.”
I’m sorry if I’ve brought back any bad memories for you. The attack was really awful, and I hope I never am in that situation again. I will take your advice if I am though. Or, I will try, at least. I’m normally not afraid to get involved in… physical situations. My friends would tell you as much. But that night it was so different to anything I’d ever been involved in at school. Looking back, the school fights I was involved in weren’t that serious (although they seemed it at the time). They weren’t (usually) a life or death situation. I deeply regret the rivalry that I was involved in at school. I said and did things that will never be okay, and if I could see him again now, I’d apologise for them. I never got round to it in the aftermath of the war, but I definitely owe him one. I don’t suppose he’ll accept it, but I need to try. Ultimately we ended up on the same side at the end of the war. If things had been different we may have been on the same side all along.
, he didn’t understand how this man could love him when he still felt like a shell of his past self. But apparently, Harry could. “Harry, I think I’ve loved you for years.”

Draco did just that.
A recap of what I said about this chapter at the end of last’s:
“Charlie.”
“Ron!” Hermione interrupted him, pointing to the pitch. “Harry—!”
was the book’s doing, once again. Pure luck I got the book with the letter in, though,” Draco responded, taking the Charms book out of his back. “The letter’s in it,” he added as he handed her the book.
The girl looked down nervously. “After you showed me the book, Malfoy, I haven’t been able to keep my mind off of it. It’s strange no one else besides you can read it, don’t you think?”
You are born already with the start of a tale, a history from your family, from your parents and those that came before, and each memory, each event, every person in your life, all your emotions, they add a thread. Some threads are dark, some are almost as white as the blank background, some shine in the night, some are green like a forest in spring.
Draco didn’t know what to say to that. He’d slept at Harry’s place for nearly two months now, but today he didn’t quite feel like going there. Luckily, his mother answered for him.
“I know, Draco. I know. I miss her too.” His mother pulled him closer and pressed a kiss to the side of his head. “But you didn’t lose Scorpius. And whatever just happened, I’m sure you’re making it far worse in your head. You’ve always had a flair for the dramatic.”
“Oh, let me make that for you, dearie.” Draco hadn’t noticed her, but suddenly the Weasley matriarch stood in front of them, smiling brightly as she took Scorpius’ hand from him. Scorpius shot an uncomfortable look at his dad, but the need to be polite stopped him from speaking up. Draco would have done so for him, but he missed the moment as Molly kneeled down and pulled Scorpius to her chest. “Your dad can get something to eat while we make you tea in the kitchen. He looks like he could use a good meal.”
Harry’s rapidly spiraling thoughts were interrupted by Draco rolling over and settling contently on top of his chest, fever noticeably lower than before. Harry let out a slow breath, and carefully put his arms around the man. Where normally he found touch overwhelming when he freaked out, there was something about Draco’s weight on top of him that only calmed him down. In fact, after a while he even began to feel sleepy, and a few minutes later, Harry slowly drifted off to sleep.
“I would appreciate it if you kept me updated, Hermione,” Kingsley said after fighting an unexpected wave of emotions. Hermione looked surprised by the use of her given name. “As friends, I mean. Not as Minister or colleague. Without him we… Kevin and I would not be married. After everything Mr Malfoy has done for our world, he does not deserve this fate.”
“When are you planning to apologise to my mother?” Of course Draco was going to run into Percy at a stationery store. Where else would he meet the most stuck up member of the family? “She’s waiting for it you know. You insulted her, after everything she’s done for you and your son.”
“Daddyyyy!” Scorpius ran towards his father as soon as he spotted him, which more than made up for the horrible task of having to get out of bed. He could die a happy man if he never had to leave that bed again. “Daddy, Daddy, the winter orchid is in bloom! You have to see! It gives off light!”
Draco groaned, squeezing his eyes shut before opening them. “Wha-, what? Harry? What are you-, am I-, where am I?”
“Uhm, I, eh, I really like this tea, Mrs. Malfoy,” Harry stammered when they came to the end of their breakfast. Scorpius had climbed in Draco’s lap at some point and while Draco attempted to make Dutch braids in his son’s hair, his mother had taken to looking at Harry.
Draco startled awake when there was a knock on the door.
Draco hadn’t known that at first, but once he caught on there was nothing he could do except beg the Healers to be gentle. His last name didn’t help grant his wishes, but refusing Scorpius his treatment would mean the death of his only son. There was nothing he could do but stand by and watch.
“Well I’m still not a teddy bear.” Draco pouted, letting go of Harry’s hand and crossing his arms in front of his chest. “And remember the last time Scorpius got hold of one of Rose’s princess dresses and a jar of glitter?”
But that night, it felt different. It was weird. I had a feeling that something was wrong. Then I was walking past one of the nightclubs and there was this couple - a gay couple - walking the opposite way to me. They’d passed me and then there was a lot of shouting - angry shouting - and when I turned to see what was going on… a large group of men had surrounded the couple. It was… aside from the battle, I’ve never really seen violence on that level. I desperately wanted to intervene, but I couldn’t move. Even if I could have, I wouldn’t have been able to do anything. There were at least ten of them and I’m, well, I’m not the biggest and I was in Muggle London. I couldn’t have taken them on without the use of my wand and the other people that were there wanted nothing to do with it. They pretended not to see what was happening.
“Well it’s true.” Draco was fighting to keep the pout on his face now as Harry moved closer and tried to drag him back under the duvet. He really shouldn’t be behaving like this. He was thirty one years old, not three. Yet he was enjoying himself too much to call it quits. Normal parenting was stressful, but parenting a five year old on your own after losing his mother to a horrible curse was even worse. He was always worried and on edge and scared something might happen and
It didn’t take a genius to deduct that nothing had changed. George swallowed with difficulty and sat down on the armrest of Harry’s chair, putting a firm arm around him. “He’s just a bit slow on the uptake. We can’t all be practiced injured coma patients like you, you know?”
Draco’s head was too heavy for his neck. He tried leaning back but the backrest of Potter’s chair wasn’t high enough, so his only option was laying his head down on the desk. He didn’t want to, it was undignified, but now that his body knew it would be shoved back into bed by Potter soon, it no longer listened to him.
Draco refused to look at him, opting instead to keep his head buried in the crook of Neville’s neck. “I’m scared we don’t fit, and that it’s actually just me keeping him trapped.”
fucked up.”
Dumbledore knew what Voldemort was making you do and that he didn’t lift a finger to help. Things can get complicated during a war, but you don’t let children take the brunt of that if you can in any way prevent it. And I know how shitty it is when it happens anyway, but at least I got help when you didn’t. And I don’t think that’s fair.”
he was forced to choose between murdering him or having him and his family killed and never seriously tried to help him. So whose responsibility is it then? His dead father maybe? Or his mother who’s still exiled to France? Because I don’t see anyone else giving a damn.”
He wanted to die.
The look he got in reply to his question was so exhausted, Harry was almost tempted to yawn himself. Malfoy could barely keep his eyes open, and didn’t seem surprised at all to see Harry there. He made no move to say anything though, which gave Harry some time for a quick once over.
having that help. I have been too late before. I am not going to be too late again. It is why I do this whole anonymous letter program. If anonymity is what it takes to get people the help they need then that is how it will be.
I was involved, quite heavily, in the war a few years ago and I thought I’d come out of it quite well. I had nightmares, of course, but nothing more. I thought I’d managed to move on but recently I witnessed a, quite frankly, horrific incident while I was walking in Muggle London and it brought back all the memories that I’d suppressed. I couldn’t do anything to help, and that made me angry. It was the kind of anger I’ve not felt in a long time, and if I’m honest, it scared me.
in his
“A million blankets doesn’t really sound like a fix.” Draco let out a stray sob before reaching out and putting a trembling hand around his cup of tea. “Thanks for the tea, Nev.”
Draco blinked a couple of times, looking quite confused. It was endearing.
Despite the events from the previous day, Draco felt quite happy once he stepped into the floo to the leaky. Harry followed right behind him but due to the crowd and the many things they needed to get before apparating to a Muggle shop for the rest of their purchasing, they decided to split up and meet again in an hour. Draco was just about to enter the apothecary when someone grabbed his arm.
“It’s not really the same, but…” Harry sighed. “I think I understand what you mean. And I love your hidden pleas for attention because that means I can give that attention to you. When I need something I just suffer in silence. I think that’s why we would fit so well together.”
It was about fifteen minutes later when he heard the stumble of his guests making their way to his bedroom. Harry looked quite thoroughly snogged, while Draco looked like he wanted to disappear. His fingers frantically pulled on the edge of his sweater, and his eyes were cast down, as if searching for a trapdoor into oblivion.
Scorpius gave one more small nod before he fell back asleep. It took a while before Draco could tear his eyes away from his sleeping son, but once he did he reached out to Harry and briefly squeezed his hands. “Tell your kids I’m sorry I let myself panic like that when we got here. And that I’m proud of them for behaving the way they did, especially James.”
“Malfoy.” It was Ginny Weasley. “I wanted to talk to you about what happened yesterday.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry froze as something clicked. “Is that why you fainted so much in our last year? Why you seemed pained every time I tried to talk to you? I would have stopped trying if Pansy hadn’t pushed me to keep going. You didn’t stop running from me until…”
“Yes!” Scorp’s face lit up with excitement and he jumped off the couch, happy to leave the heavy conversation behind. Draco was relieved to see him bounce up like that. He would hate for his son to have a setback again. “Will I see you at dinner?”
Life is hard, Potter. I know it is not common practice in our world and I know you Gryffindors all seem very keen on solving your problems alone, even though that usually just makes things worse, but this should be a different scenario. I have never been Dumbledore's greatest fan, even though I would never have been able to kill him, and this just makes me dislike him even more. He should have looked out for you, Potter!
As Ron always said to him, tea has never made anything worse. Though in this case, Neville hoped it would actually make things better. He couldn’t stand the small, deeply hurt noises that were still coming from his living room as he went into the kitchen to fetch some tea. He added a small bottle of firewhiskey, handkerchiefs and some strong ginger biscuits just to be on the safe side before he returned.
“Still at my mum’s place,” he replied. “Merlin, it feels weird to call the Manor that.”
With kind regards,
“Now you just sound sad.”
His mother was more than a little surprised to see him, but she asked no questions when she saw the look on Draco’s face. It was one of her many great qualities, to know when to act instead of talk. Together they quickly managed to temporarily distract Scorpius with cake and a couple of nifty house elf magic tricks so Draco could have a moment for himself before talking to his son about the incident.
“You think of us as family?”
He’d brought this fate onto himself, and he’d made peace with it. And now Potter had to show up in his life and muck it all up.
, anything - feel it, touch it,
“Of course you love me.” Draco smirked. “What’s not to love?”
“You-, you’re fired?” Endearment shifted to fear, somehow looking more intense than the nightmare had done. Draco tried to sit up, sending himself into a coughing fit. Harry sat on the bed and tried to support him, letting the man cough against his sweater.
“Alright,” his mouth replied before his head had made up its mind. Nerves immediately pooled in his stomach, but they were squashed down by the genuinely delighted look he received from Potter. “But
morning no less. What if Draco was angry, or insulted, what if he just straight up left?
“Want another cup of coffee then?” Harry gestured at the empty mug on the table, trying to remain professional. He would rather ask Malfoy a million different questions, like why he was so tired, why he came to look for peace and quiet
“It does.” Harry murmured, still just as far from sleep as Draco was. Their thoughts would be racing for quite some time to come, but processing things savely in each other’s arms meant sleep would come at some point, while nightmares would not. They never had nightmares together.
His complaints were muffled against the wood, but Harry still heard them for the bullshit they were.
“Of course.” Kingsley nodded at her, still a bit shaken. “Make sure you look after yourself too, Hermione.”
Scream into your pillow, walk, write, talk to an owl, but do not hold on to your anger just because it is justified. Anger leaves no place for lightness. If we are giving advice anyway, I would also like to suggest not to doubt my loyalty when it comes to being your friend. I was not put in Slytherin for nothing, I am loyal to a fault.
Though he might be partially responsible for the whole busy schedule thing. He could have kept working as an editor for that potions magazine without starting a degree at a muggle university on the side, but he hadn’t. The menial, low effort spelling and fact-checking drove him mental. He needed a distraction, and this had been the only option he could think of.
Harry has suspected as much, but it still wasn’t fun to hear. Luna could read people better than anyone he knew, even if she was a bit odd about it and didn’t always realise it herself. Ginny had once told him that it was like Luna thought of herself as though she was a single nice lily drifting in a pond, while really she was as complex and beautiful as the entire garden, pond included. Harry had called Ginny a sap, and in turn he’d been shoved off his chair. It had been a good afternoon.
“It’s…” Draco was at a loss for words. “It’s-, it’s wonderful,” he stuttered eventually, as he pulled Harry into a giant bear hug. “I love you.”
I need you to know this because I do not think anyone has ever told you this in such a way that you actually understood it, but You. Deserve. Help. Especially as a kid, that is what adults are for. But reading your letters makes me understand that you have not been brought up with that idea, so I will try and explain it to you.
“I recorded myself,” Draco whispered after a very long silence. “Luna advised me to do that, when I feel like I can’t cope. I was doing so well, but yesterday evening…. At least tonight I had the strength to come here.”
I also promise to stop suppressing memories. Well, I’ll try to stop. I’ll try to write things down. Maybe I’ll scream into a pillow… that used to help me during school holidays. Anyway.
“And that’s the end of this update for now, Mr Malfoy.” Scorpius’ Healer concluded. “Do you have any questions?”
the man after completing Healing training and saving a million lives.
If my mother had not taught me that I deserve help for my illness, I would be dead. I do not want that to happen to you, just because no one has told you the way my mother has for me, that you deserve that help. That you should not wait for a breakdown and a mandatory ministry letter exchange. That you should not, when you feel uncomfortable saying certain things to your friends, bottle everything up.
“I’m afraid it’s a bit more complicated than that, Rosie.” Her dad chuckled even though he clearly didn’t find it very funny, which confused her. On the other side of the room her Uncle Harry just started crying even harder. It looked so sad Rose’s chest started to hurt.
“Fine.” Teddy sighed. Victoire was right. “I just… Draco loves flying. I thought he would like it if I flew to him.”
“I just did what I had to do.”
But it took a long time before Draco and Neville finally came to that point. Neville was no stranger to the relief of crying, but it seemed Draco had been building up to this moment for years, like there were decades worth of hurt to claw through before he could find any sort of relief. So Neville held him. He held him and he said a million soothing things in the hope of getting through to the man. A million reasons why Draco was strong. A million reasons why life was still worth it. A million reasons why it was okay to break down and cry and not feel okay.
“Yes please!” Scorpius nodded enthusiastically and took his hand. Draco had to duck a bit as he got up in order not to pull his kid off the ground, but he was used to that by now. He’d been a single parent for nearly two years. Some days were hard, some days felt nearly impossible, but every day was rewarding. “Can I have dar-jee-ling, Daddy?”
was the one who never made time for the specky git.
Of course he knew Scorpius wasn’t the brat he himself used to be, but he still got spoiled, he was still equally well-mannered and all things Muggle-made him uncomfortable so Draco didn’t expose him to them. Now, that wasn’t the same as teaching him blood purity, but being a Malfoy, people would always have their prejudice ready to dish out to him. If the public and even the Weasleys kept seeing him as a smaller version of Draco, and with that a smaller version of what Lucius had been, wouldn’t Scorpius be pushed into the same mould as Draco had been? If he didn’t actively teach him about equality and Muggles, wouldn’t he automatically turn into a blood supremacist just because other people saw him like that? Draco knew like no other how easy it was to turn into the person people expected you to be.
Draco wished Harry had been angry. At least then he could wallow in self pity instead of guilt for making Harry wait for him. He wouldn’t even begin to
It was probably because he never told anyone about his past. The only one who knew was his mother, and the pity in her eyes each time she looked at him had permanently screwed up their relationship. He still feared it would do the same if he told Harry. But not telling Pansy and Blaise had ruined that relationship too.
“To a normal person, maybe?” Draco whisper yelled over the music. “To mister Adonis over there I am definitely not. And anyway, I am not going over there! If he’ll smile at me, I’ll faint.”
Draco didn’t know why, probably because it was all a little too much, the stress and relief and gratitude and insecurity crashing down on him on an empty stomach, but suddenly, he was crying. Not the gentle tears from the night before, but actual ugly sobbing.
It didn’t last of course. When did it ever? Albus, Lily and James sat neatly in a row, all quiet and well-behaved. A well-behaved Potter never boded well. Draco couldn’t sit, though. He’d been here before, only last time he’d been too numb to really feel what was going on. Now everything seemed to bright. The lime green floors, the smell of disinfectant, the numerous Healers and nurses walking past with a sympathetic look on their face that only made him panic more.
“As far as I am aware, our biggest problem is right here,” he replied as he came to a standstill in front of a large glass window. There were already three people standing there, an Indonesian woman in business attire and two young children. He joined them, looking through the window to get a proper view of Draco Malfoy’s hospital room. The place was quite crowded. Harry, who looked like he’d just woken up, was getting ushered to a chair by a nurse. Narcissa Malfoy stood next to her son, looking intimidating despite her hair sticking up on one side. A Healer was checking Malfoy’s vital signs, though Kingsley couldn’t decipher the outcome of the spells. “How is he holding up?”
Draco’s cheeks bloomed pink. “I thought it was just a joke, or an easier way to say things.”
Draco snorted. “Me? Relaxed? Have you met me, Potter? Last time I relaxed was like, seven years ago.”
here? Why are you
“Draco, what happened at the Burrow… It sucked, but it wasn’t your fault.” Harry threw an arm around his chest, spooning him from behind. “Molly will come around, she always does, but in the meantime you have to stop beating yourself up about it, okay?”
When the attack is over, go to the victim, tell them help is on its way, and show them compassion, but not pity. Big emotions can stop us from acting in certain situations, but having a step by step plan of what to do can sometimes help kick us into action. If that does not work, however, or you find yourself unable to stay or help (due to, for example, accidental magic or a panic attack), do not beat yourself up about that. Someone else has already literally taken blows that night, making yourself feel bad will not help anyone.
Harry
“Hey, Draco?”
“Because I idolized my father, and look how that ended.” Draco sighed and looked at his knees. “I don’t want to be the only person he looks up to. It isn’t right. But I don’t trust other people enough for him to look up to. Well, except for you of course. And I get so protective of him because he’s been through so much, so I don’t even
“Yes, Daddy.” Scorpius nodded eagerly and immediately curled up against his chest. “Harry is the best hugger in the world, but you’re still the best dad in the world.”
“Don’t you dare!” Draco snapped, rolling them over until he was right on top of Harry, glaring down at his stupid happy face. “Don’t you dare Harry James Potter or I swear I will-, I will-”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t want to tell you.” Draco rolled over so he wouldn’t have to look at Harry anymore. He’d only just thought of how bloody stupid he would sound if he spoke up about it. Besides it wasn’t even that big a deal. He wished he hadn’t said anything.

Her breakdown just got worse as she recalled that. Because it just wasn’t

She approached Harry’s booth and carefully set Aurora down beside him. “Harry, this is Aurora. She likes to play with string,” she said, dropping a length of red wool onto the table before walking away to tidy the cups.
“Oh.” Uncle Harry’s frown deepened, but then he relaxed and smiled a bit. “Yeah, I guess they are. Thank you Rosie.”
St Mungo’s definitely still had a long way to go, but at least he had the Healer’s word now. Baby steps.
Tears dripped down his face onto their joined hands. It would be a beautiful moment for Draco to open his eyes, awoken by the magic of Harry’s tears, but of course, such things only happened in fairy tales. “I’ve been so selfish. If I think the general public is more important than everyone I love, then I shouldn’t get so close to my loved ones. I shouldn’t have gotten so close to you if that only brings you pain, since I insist on getting hurt all the time. It’s not fair. I should have made a choice ages ago, and I should have chosen
“When you were a child. When I was fourteen I believed a million stupid things, and I was surrounded by brilliant people. You’re still a good person if you have to work a little harder to achieve it than others. Maybe that makes you even better,
“Yeah, sounds good.” Harry sounded a bit distracted, and Neville soon found out why. Draco was now awake enough to slowly work his mouth from the crook of Harry’s neck to his lips, leaving slow kisses and intimate whispers as he went. Whispers that were no doubt about his episode from before. Apologies for something that didn’t need apologising, shame for something that was brave.
I’m already looking forward to your next letter. (Am I allowed to ask you questions about your life?
And after those last words, Ginny turned around and continued on her way, leaving a quite baffled Draco in her wake.
“I figured you’d like this. I put a double espresso in yours to make up for that coffee I promised you.”
“Sir?” Harry called through the office door while he knocked. He was scared Draco might fall off his chair if left alone for too long. The door swung open, revealing a Robarts who looked like he was just leaving. “I’m here to tell you Draco Malfoy is sick. I’ll be taking him home, someone else has to cover his shift, sir.”
things, and Draco just couldn’t. So he declined all invitations and spend all his nights, mornings or evenings, depending on his hours, on his own in front of some mindless television. The muggle contraption was good to relax his mind after a hard day’s work, though he wouldn’t deny the lack of company made him a bit sad.
Harry’s eyes looked like they were about to pop out of his head, he looked so shocked. Horrified. Disgusted. Or at least that’s what Draco thought until Harry suddenly pulled him close again. “I always figured something dark had happened in your past, I just never dared to think it might be this.” Harry whispered against his neck. “But that’s not a shameful thing. You fought to stay alive harder than anyone I know. That’s something to be proud of, Draco. I am so proud of you.”
She did that sometimes, sizing people up with a neutral but intense gaze. It was a perfect method to get people to comply to her will. Anything to make that stare turn into a gentle smile or approving nod. In Harry’s case it was a gentle but firm warning that he better have Draco’s back or he’d get a lot more than just a disapproving stare. Draco always thought that was a bit overbearing, but he hadn’t really noticed his mother doing it much so he hadn’t stopped her either.
“Yeah, exactly that.” Ginny nodded when she saw his response. “I didn’t tell him because my mother wouldn’t even dare to think of doing that again after the argument we had about it. I didn’t speak with her for three whole weeks but she calmed down eventually and admitted she’d been in the wrong. Or rather, that she should have respected our wishes, but I don’t think she understands what’s wrong with punishing a child like that. I don’t think she wants to understand, because it would mean she has to admit to having made mistakes while raising us. My mum is too proud for that. Your son doesn’t deserve to fall victim of that pride.”
me into a vampire, so your son still has no excuse for biting me. And no one ever asks for anything by looking a certain way, that’s not consensual.”
She’d left again before either him or Harry could comment on the fact that she saw the pair of them as Scorpius’ dads. Harry clearly wasn’t sure if he could call himself that already, judging by the insecurity in his eyes when Draco looked at him. Draco wasn’t sure yet either, but now that it was said he rather liked the sound of it. “Would you-, I mean, is it okay if-”
Casting a glance over her shoulder, she could see Harry and Draco deep in conversation. If she wasn’t mistaken, they were sitting closer than they had been previously. Aurora was still perched on the table in front of them. Her paws were tucked under her and she was purring contentedly, with both Harry and Draco stroking her fur.
And then sleep took over, and she was gone.
Draco smiled, his eyes suddenly swimming in tears. “Thank you,” he whispered.
“I won’t deny that.” Kingsley sighed and watched Hermione walk away. She was special, that one. Relentlessly hard working, like only the really good politicians were. He turned back to the window, looking at the sick man in bed. Draco Malfoy was hard working too. The special kind of hard working. It had taken him a while to see it, see past his teenage mistakes, see his true remorse.
me! It’s true and you know it. Malfoy was a dick alright, but that’s not a crime, and no reason for Hogwarts or the Ministry to fail him like they did.”
“There’s the man I love.” Harry chuckled. “And don’t worry, I’ll ask Ron for food. Knowing him, he’ll already have seven turkeys in the oven. You know how he gets when he’s stressed, especially when someone’s in the hospital.”
. She mumbled in her own head.
I want to tell you who I am, but not yet. I need to figure things out first.
I'm not spoiling anything, I'm just that reading the tags might bring you comfort....
And I hoped you guys enjoyed this new chapter, please conciser leaving kuddos or a comment if you did<3
“Yeah, well, it was just, I was a bit worried, you see, because Draco didn’t really seem alright today, and then I was awake anyway, so I thought I’d stop by his quarters, just to check, but then he wasn’t there, and then I got more worried because I didn’t know where he was and then I dug up my map and it showed you two were here and I just didn’t know why and I don’t have to know why! You don’t have to tell me, and I can leave right now, I just wanted to know how Draco was doing?” Harry was slightly out of breath after his ramblings, and Neville couldn’t help but smile at that. The man would never judge Draco for being a mess, being a mess himself.
“You don’t have to-,” Harry started, but Draco cut him off.
“Draco, you’re here!” Harry climbed out of the booth as soon as he caught sight of Draco and wrapped him up in a warm hug. Draco was glad it only lasted half a second, otherwise he might have cried. His trip down memory lane from the night before had left him shaken, and to say he was emotionally stable was a big fat lie. “Please, sit down, I’ll fetch you something to drink.”
Draco sighed tiredly. “I know it is, Hermione, and I’ve thought about it

“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there,” he drawled, as Weasley turned around in his seat. Draco grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle next to him. “Wonder how long Potter
She looked at him in surprise, just as Pansy gave him a curious glance. “How—“
“Granger,” Draco and Pansy greeted in unison, a little stiff.
“I also had a one-night stand with a boy a while ago, ‘cause I was questioning my sexuality,” he told her bluntly. Ginny’s eyes widened in disgust.
His hips arched off the bed as he came, groaning loudly. He cast a quick vanishment charm, head falling back onto his pillow, panting. He rolled onto his side, undid the charms on the hangings, and heard the door open.
“You’re in luck, Weasley, Potter’s

“Yeah, I have,” he answered, one eyebrow raised. “Your point, Granger?”
Fifteen minutes later, Sinistra let them continue their work on their star charts, so Draco, knowing he wouldn’t need much time, took out the book instead. As he opened it, Pansy’s previous question
“Mhm, emerald,” Draco agreed. Potter shrugged, eyes falling down Draco’s body again. Draco, suppressing a laugh, demanded, “Lift

Opening it, he flipped to the last filled-in page, reading and laughing about how utterly lost they were with Draco having the letter.
Draco sighed exasperatedly; this was what he hoped wouldn’t happen, the girl’s just too sharp. “We know about Norbert — because of you-know-what — and figured we’d

“What did you ask us here for, Granger?” he asked her, keeping a firm grip on his backpack, in which his ‘book stuff’
Draco and Pansy gaped at her retreating, Pansy wide-mouthed, Draco more reserved. When they got back to themselves, Pansy muttered, “That was weird,” and Draco quietly agreed.

Warm hands found Draco’s waist, and he shivered, blood pumping to his dick. He jumped up, now leaning on his hands instead of arms, as Potter’s hand found his dick. Draco felt him give it a few quick strokes, staying for it to become fully erect, before slowly inching his dick inside.

Hey there! I just wanted to say that I will be adding a chapter to Destinia every Saturday or Sunday. I also have two other stories, one of which I’m not yet sure I will post. The one I will probably be posting is a Drarry one after the war in their eight-year called Ravenclaw’s Secret. That’s all I will say! Bye and thank you for reading my story!
I hope you enjoyed this chapter. I will publish a new one every weekend. Now, for the beta submissions (only if you want to), you can message me on my other social media (or AO3, but I don’t know how that works). They are: Instagram (mchan_v), Twitter (@MChanV4) and ff.net (M-Chan V). And if you’re up to betareading the new story, I can always send you a short summary / tags of it.
“I’m gay,” he admitted, wiping the sweat from his forehead. “And that was amazing. Ginny never allows me to go that fast.” Draco almost choked on his own spit.
Potter nodded dumbly, removing his pants (Draco watched gleefully as he hissed when his more-than-just-erect and

That letter, though, was something to remember.
Potter looked like he wanted to snap back, but rephrased it to a timid, “Right...” as he lifted his arms. Draco pulled the jumper off, throwing it aside and leisurely pulling the rim of Potter’s shirt out of his trousers. He could still feel Potter’s eyes on his crotch,

“I don’t know, Ginny, I’m serious,” he told her sternly. “And,” he added after a deep breath, “I think I’m gay.” That was what he had decided on with Malfoy’s book. He couldn’t feel any attraction to females anymore, so he must be gay. Ginny, however, didn’t take it as well as he had.
The girl put down the book she was reading and looked up, giving Draco a friendly smile. “Good morning, Malfoy,” she greeted, looking over to Pansy before adding, “Parkinson.” and giving her a nod.

Hello everyone!
Ron rolled his eyes irritably. “That’s still cheating, Harry,” Hermione whispered, frowning disapprovingly. Harry sighed.
Late that night, him and Pansy met up in the common room. It was around one o’clock, so the room was empty. They had planned a meeting with Hermione, insisted by the girl, to get to know her better. Honestly, Draco was slightly hesitant. She was a Muggle-born, and
weren’t, that’s the point,” Draco shot back, grinning playfully. Pansy let out a choke of laughter.
“So, what’s this about?” Hermione whispered to Draco and Pansy in the library the next night. Draco fidgeted nervously with the rim of his shirt while Pansy sat sagged on the bench next to him, letting him do all the work as the amazing best friend she was.
, don’t you think, Granger?” Pansy said, and Draco hoped Hermione hadn’t missed the jokiness in her statement.
“What...?” Harry froze at the sudden voice, glancing to his side. Ron and Hermione were standing there, wearing utterly shocked expressions. “You cheated on my sister...?” Harry could hear at his voice that Ron was anything but pleased.
Hello again.
Dear Ron,
Hermione rolled her eyes and lowered her voice. “About Snape refereeing the match between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff,” she whispered.
After having received the agreement from Potter he needed, he undid the incantation, falling back to the wall as his consciousness returned to his own body. Feeling disoriented and exhausted, he rubbed his face and eyes, groaning quietly. Looking back at the Great Hall, the rowdy crowd of students were slowly starting to leave and head to class.
They had already made a habit of it. Every time they’d follow Potter, Weasley and Hermione to Hagrid’s, and they had to return to the castle, they’d go past the greenhouses to avoid suspicion of oblivious classmates. They were about to turn a corner when a small cough caught their attention. They turned around and looked at a disapproving looking Hermione.
The same Weasley sharpened his glare. “
It had taken only an hour to receive a letter back.
Draco smiled sweetly at her. “
Draco gave a short laugh. “Haven’t told her what really bit you, huh?” he mocked, smirking nastily. He didn’t think he would ever stop hating the Weasleys, this Weasley specifically.
, there is. I wanted to borrow Weasley’s Charms book. Can I have a word with him about it?”
you heard the news?” she returned, rolling her wand nervously between her index and thumb.
But staying true to his promise became about impossible as, after answering the question correctly, his eyes locked with Potter’s darkened ones. He held his gaze, not giving in to the pathetic urge to look away.
“Do we
“No?” he wondered innocently, frowning up at him. “What about ‘emerald’?”

This is the second to last chapter of the first part of the Destinia series. Next weekend will be the last episode (kind of like an epilogue). Just a hands-up.
With a shake of his head and a horrified expressing, he came to his senses. What was happening to him?! This was his girlfriend! Harry noticed the near shiver as he thought that. He looked down at his hands in the darkness, trying to figure out what was wrong.

up in front of the library, again on request of the Gryffindor. And, in hindsight, it might not have been the Slytherins’ best idea to meet up in the girl’s territory, but Draco felt like he could consider her some kind of friend, so wasn’t too suspicious.
“First, Weasley getting bit by Norbert was foolish,” he started. Hermione exhaled.
“If you can pay that much attention to my body, you could at least try to pay half that much attention to my voice,” Draco retorted. “I said, lift your arms, so I can get this horrendous thing off you.”
“Believe it or not, and you better, he isn’t planning on doing anything more than keep him out of trouble,” Draco explained. “It’s Quirrell you have to watch out for.” That last sentence got Hermione’s attention.
“No, he isn’t!” Hermione exclaimed, slightly too loud. She noticed Draco’s sharp look and lowered her voice. “There’s no way
Draco felt his voice break a pitch higher, which it didn’t do often, and got quickly lost to the feeling of being fucked mercilessly. He had always been one for rough play, but never one to push it onto his partners, and the pool in Draco’s stomach grew quicker than ever. He clasped his hands around the pillow

care of.
“Yep,” Draco answered shortly, giving her a small smile before shushing her and hiding beneath a window with their backs pressed against the wall. They had been following the trio a lot lately, while Draco had to keep up the pretence the book wrote for him. They were almost a hundred percent sure Hermione knew of them going there, but she said nothing... yet.

With a satisfied smile, he sunk down to the floor with his back against the door, softly stroking his already-growing cock. He knew he could manage a round two, let alone right after the best sex he had had in a long time and the reminder of it stuck up his ass, even though it might not be as good.
“How do you want me?” he asked, inspecting his nails, but not missing Potter’s body freezing and his dick, now extra visible as he had only his pants on, twitching.
. I haven’t found a thing about it, though,” he told her. She nodded thoughtfully.
, whatever. Sex for Draco, however, meant business. And he didn’t mix business with his personal life, but who gave a fuck? He was there to get fucked, that was all.
“I’ve never seen Snape look so mean,” he was saying. Draco walked up right behind him. “Look — they’re off.” And Draco made sure to ‘poke’ the back of Weasley’s head with his elbow. “Ouch!”
why would I give it to you?”
“I know... but what was that about in the hospital wing?” she tensed.

Harry broke Malfoy’s eye contact as Professor McGonagall continued lecturing, but her voice morphed to a buzz as his thoughts returned to Malfoy. He couldn’t get the sight of that writhing body beneath him, couldn’t get the memory of the feel of Malfoy’s ass around his cock out of his head.
“I am aware, Professor McGonagall. I’ll take care of it.”
To say the letter Draco got was unexpected, would be an understatement.
“How?” she wondered quietly, frowning.

Today was the day the dragon would hatch, and the book had given him a chance to watch. He didn’t even have any dialogue to practice. Just standing at a window and running back to the castle.

sat on his bed, Pansy in front of him, busy studying for History of Magic, their next and last exam. The past week, Draco had been busy worrying about the small parts the book had already added, as he had had no particular problem with most of the subjects, let alone this one.
Draco and Pansy went the opposite way, down to the dungeons, to get, as Hermione had so eloquently put it, a good night’s rest.

Draco looked up as the door opened.
To anyone wondering, yes, I will add a recap for the previous chapter if you want me to. You can ask me that in a review. Have fun reading this chapter!
“Draco, Pansy,” she greeted back, giving each of them a small nod. “Why have you been following us?”
He recalled a few of their dates, but soon grimaced, disgusted at even the thought of kissing her. With a low groan, he rubbed his face in his hands. He didn’t like her anymore, that much was obvious, but why? Why didn’t he like her anymore? They had been dating for months! Months! And suddenly, all was gone?
“What about?”
Draco skipped the following conversation, of two sentences if he remembered correctly, to keep a good look on Hagrid’s face. Right as the colour drained from it, Draco pushed himself off of the window ledge and sped towards the castle, hoping to Merlin he wouldn’t get caught. Right at the entrance, he almost bumped into a very disgruntled Pansy.
“Close,” he gasped out, followed by Potter’s moan of agreement. By the pulsing of his cock inside Draco — a feeling he preferred above most — he wasn’t very far from coming himself. Right as Draco felt his bollocks contract and his orgasm near, Potter sized up, groaning low and spilling a gullible load of cum inside Draco’s ass.
Sinistra looked down on them disappointed and annoyed.
“Emerald?” Potter returned,
the covers below him. Falling to those covers, he clenched his ass as he felt Potter’s half-flaccid cock slip out of him. Grabbing beneath the pillow for his wand, he summoned a sizeable butt plug to accommodate Potter’s girth from the box beneath his bed, putting it in to keep him stretched and the cum inside, as Potter collapsed onto the bed next to him.
This is the last chapter of the first part of Destinia. I will take a few months off before continuing with the series (don’t know a specific date), and then I’ll start publishing the second part of Destinia. To stay updated, you can subscribe/bookmark the Destinia series on my account.
Warning! This is chapter five, which includes self-harm. You are warned. The self-harm is in the third and fourth last paragraphs of the second ‘scene’ (the first ‘scene’ is clear), and there is a warning beforehand. Please do read the notes at the bottom. Also, prepare.

“Where are they?” Pansy asked frustrated, as they entered the Astronomy tower for their lesson the next Wednesday. Draco shrugged.
How are you? Thanks for the letter —
(He had had to laugh at the phrasing.)
He didn’t stop when Weasley opened his mouth to retort. “I don’t like Ginny anymore,” he said, after having asked Potter’s mind for the memories. He suppressed his heavier breathing. “That’s why I’m breaking up with her fair and square. I didn’t cheat, even if you may think that, and I don’t care. Go off, I’d say. But that doesn’t mean I don’t want to be friends with you anymore.
“Got time for a quick shag?” Harry asked. He wasn’t one for subtly planned out foreplay. Ginny snorted.
Draco wondered why he even needed help with his sexuality. And the fucking hadn’t even started yet.
“The reason I came clean is that I do. I still want to be your friend. But if you don’t want to be mine anymore, I can deal with this alone. Goodbye.” And he told Potter to walk away, leaving Weaslette, Weasley, Granger and an entire crowd of students thunderstruck. He tiredly whispered to Potter’s consciousness to not bother with them and get himself together before seeking another conflict.
“On your knees?” he asked. Draco shrugged.

As they arrived at the library, no one was there yet, so they waited just inside to not
He looked up from a list of tips on how to ride someone as he heard a knock on the door to the lounge. “It’s open,” he called, placing the book in a drawer of his nightstand and getting up from the bed, waiting next to it. His eyes locked with Potter’s nervous ones as he opened the door. He quickly broke their eye contact by looking at the floor and closed the door behind him, clearing his throat.
He should, too, he reminded himself, shaking his head to rid the last bit of confusion, and set off down the corridor, stifling a yawn.
Draco shrugged nonchalantly. “Just wanted to borrow a book,” he answered, narrowing his eyes as a warning not to deny it to him. Weasley mimicked him.

“And?” it asked, ensuring Draco of its identity. Pansy. She sat down on the bed and stared at Draco curiously.
see his dick harden steadily through his Muggle jeans, as he disposed of the shirt. He gestured to Potter to remove his own jeans.
Harry shrugged helpfully. “I’ve been thinking about our relationship for a while, and I’ve found I can’t like you anymore,” he tried explaining what he couldn’t himself. Ginny scowled darkly at him.
At first, Draco had been sure it had been a joke, a silly dare, but he had sent a letter back nonetheless.
“Morning, Mate,” Ron said, yawning, sitting down next to his girlfriend. He, like Harry himself, did have troubles with the early hours. “Where’s Ginny?”
Draco smiled cheerfully. “No time for that, I’ll tell you after school,” he whispered under his breath as Professor Sprout ushered them inside for their second period.
hope so!” Pansy exclaimed loudly, earning a warning nudge from Draco.
Enjoy!
Ginny seemed to haven’t noticed his horrified expression as he froze in the hallway because she greeted him as cheerfully as ever, “Morning, Harry!”
As Draco opened the door to his dorm, he found a girl sitting on his bed waiting for someone.
“I didn’t see you downstairs,” she said. Harry moved over so she could join him in his bed. “You
“I don’t care what you said, mate,” Weasley’s sharp voice rose over the dead silent crowd. “You cheated on my sister!” Draco bit his bottom lip sharply. He had to help Potter before he said something he shouldn’t. He took his wand out of his inner-robe pocket and murmured a quick incantation.
Draco exhaled a deep breath, despite Pansy’s alarmed look, and soundlessly approached the Gryffindor girl. Pansy, after a second’s hesitation, followed him. “Granger,” he whispered as they took a seat opposite her.
Three brief lists and a time and date had followed that mention, giving Draco enough to prepare himself with.
The warm feeling of cum filling him triggered Draco’s own orgasm, and he emptied his cock
Finally, he caught her sitting in a corner of the room, reading a book. He hurried towards her as nonchalantly as possible, sitting down next to her and discreetly hiding his erection by crossing his legs and draped his robe over his crotch. Ginny greeted him warmly, kissing his cheek.
Harry almost choked on his egg. “She’s still asleep,” he told him dismissively. “She looked like she needed it.” Ron nodded, smiling.
And from then on, both Draco and Pansy knew the adventure continued, and they were thoroughly excited about it.
“Pansy,” Draco sighed, sitting down next to the girl. Pansy looked up instantly, eyes darting briefly towards the book.
In the middle of his breakfast, his eyes fell on Malfoy, entering the Hall, dressed elegantly in jet black robes. Harry’s eyes followed him as he walked towards the Slytherin table, hips swinging slightly, one hand raking through his platinum hair. Malfoy didn’t seem to notice his stare.
But in the end, all that pain and misery did lead him to a good place. It had led him to where he was now. Standing in a bookshop, signing copies of his own children’s books for an orphanage charity, with a very small looking Harry Potter in front of his table.
Draco did nothing to hide his Cheshire cat-like grin.
to be this insecure, or hate myself this much, but I still do.”
“Well then, there’s only one solution to that.”
“I am not!” Harry countered even as he moved aside. “And besides, why does it matter? You always pull me over to your side anyway,
“Malfoy! I thought I saw something pointy walking around outside,” Potter’s greeting was warm, though his words did not reflect that. Draco declared himself mad once again for ever stepping into this coffee shop in the first place. It had been pure luck when he’d walked past it and saw none other than Potter behind the counter, but he only had himself to blame for still going in after that.
“I’m glad to hear that, son.” Mrs Weasley got up from her chair and held out her hand, squeezing a little when Draco took it. “And I wish Scorpius the very best. I hope he’ll be back on his feet soon.”
“I try.” Draco let out a deep breath and pressed Harry’s hand closer to his chest. “This entire thing just… triggered my anxiety, made it all so much worse. I was sort of doing okay before, and now, I don’t

about Malfoy. They’d agreed to help him get back in touch, and that was really all that mattered.
A few seconds later, the bell over the door chimed again and Luna glanced up once more. Her eyes twinkled as she saw Draco making his way towards Harry’s booth, confirming her suspicions. As he sat down, he immediately reached a hand out to Aurora and Luna smiled again. She knew that Aurora had been the perfect cat for the job, given that Draco owned her cousin.
“When Mr Potter is around, there is always a reason for hope, Miss Parkinson,” Kingsley said, hoping that his words would offer the woman some comfort. But instead, she whipped her head around and glared at him, eyes ablaze with fury.
Draco couldn’t find it in himself to say anything, so he just nodded and kissed his wife’s hand. He tried to make her comfortable and warm while she was dying, though it was a losing battle. Her death was not of the peaceful kind. Nor was the grieving process that followed, or the endless nights when Scorpius couldn’t stop asking for his mum.
“Hey! Wow wow wow wow, what do you think you’re doing?” Harry was out of his chair before Draco even seemed to know someone was talking to him. “You look like death. What on earth are you doing here? Get back in bed! Or better still, go to the hospital.”
Harry raised an almost arrogant eyebrow. “You’ll what? Stutter at me?”
Draco nodded. Talking was suddenly very difficult, but nodding he could do.
“I didn’t murder him! He got poisoned by his ex with some potion he nicked off his wizard brother, hence me getting involved. Kinda fell for the ambiance of the shop while working on the case.”

“What do I do, Neville?” The question made Neville look back at Harry, who looked quite lost. “It’s not that I blame him for coming to you but…. How do I help him when I don’t know what’s wrong?”
“I told you, your colleagues-,”
He thought that if he tried, he could get over Draco. He’d gotten over Sirius, even though that still hurt every time he thought about it. But he didn’t want to get over Draco. He didn’t want to put on a brave face for Ron and Hermione, for their kids, for Teddy. Poor Teddy, who might lose his favourite fake uncle now.
When he was sure Draco was fast asleep, he transfigured the man’s clothing into fresh pyjamas, cast a mild cooling charm on the duvet and cleared away the rubble. If he kept himself busy, he wouldn’t have to think about the life altering argument he’d had a few hours ago, he wouldn’t spiral, and he wouldn’t have a panic attack in bed next to a sick Draco Malfoy. A flawless plan if there’d ever been one, since Harry had never struggled to keep his attention aimed at Draco before.
Draco Malfoy
Draco shook his head with a smile. “No Scorpius, I’m not angry with you.”
“Yeah, but I’m not kissing Ron now, am I?” Draco pulled a face.
, a something which occasionally had thoughts in the shape of single words, and emotions in the shape of panic and exhaustion. But there was something more there. Something bigger that kept escaping him each time he tried to reach for it. The something was the reason why he feared the Heaviness. Feared Death.
“She’s always done things exactly the way she wanted to.” Andromeda exchanged a smile with him that made him ache for all the family moments he never had as a child. It had always been him and his parents, plus the occasional business associate of his father. Never a warm smile like this. Draco often wondered why his mother had ever married his father, but he supposed the man had been different before the war. Either that, or his mother hadn’t had that much choice after all when it came to marriage. Most purebloods didn’t.
I admire your ability to do the work you do without being affected by everything you hear. I don’t think I’d be able to do it - I tend to pin my heart to my sleeve and that sometimes backfires on me. It certainly did in fifth year, when I lost my godfather. I still feel like it was because of me that he died and that’s… tough to take.
I have never been more grateful for my best friend when she came over one day, found me staring at the bathtub, and decided that things had to change. She has never been one for patience, so the next day she had gathered all of my friends and together they redecorated the entire place, painted over cabinets, changed the wallpaper, made a better guest room, wider windows, a proper kitchen, the works.
“Yes.” There was no doubt or hesitation in Harry’s response. “Is that okay for you?”
Draco was hit by a surge of jealousy, which was stupid because Pansy was the last person to snatch this guy from him. He was so fucked. Or actually, he wasn’t, especially not by the cute bartender, and that was becoming a real problem. “I thought you were a lesbian?”
that the man would offer him an out. Like he deserved that after all the shit he’d pulled.
I’m contacting you because, well, I think the Ministry might be right. I… I need help. Or advice, maybe. I’m not sure if they’re the same thing.
I am glad you do not regret writing these letters so far. I… do not know what to say now that I read who you are. Congratulations Potter, you got me speechless. Pansy would be proud. She would also laugh at my shocked face.
But he cut Harry off again. “Nope. I won’t hear it. Unless it starts to get unhealthy I won’t hear it, and you are so far away from that point that you’re not even allowed to think of it.”
“I better follow them, Minister.” Hermione had been so quiet after Miss Parkinson’s short speech, Kingsley had almost forgotten she was there. She suddenly looked so much younger than usual. “Can’t expect Mrs Weasley to look after everything on her own.”
“Hey, there’s no need to explain, alright?” Neville opened his arms and Draco was in them before he could even blink. “And there’s definitely no need to apologise. You’re always welcome here. Even if I had been asleep, you can always wake me up. I hope you know that.”
I decided to name the chapters after the POV I'm using, I hope that's handy? If not or if you have a better idea for chapter titles I'm open for suggestions!

really angry at anyone specifically.
“Draco it’s alright, I’m here, it’s okay. There’s no need to apologise, the kids are safe. Scorpius is going to be fine, I promise.”
For a moment they just sat there, both lost in thought as Scorpius’ slow breathing filled the room.
“Oh I hate you.” Draco let go of Harry and went to pout on the other side of the bed. “You’re really fucking annoying, Potter.”
“Yes you are.”
Hello again,
“I mean, a little bit, yeah. Robarts told me not to come back. But that doesn’t mean we can’t still be friends.”
“You just think that because I’m being nice to you.” Draco muttered. He hid his face in the crook of Harry’s neck. These weren’t the types of conversations he liked to have face to face. In fact these weren’t the kind of conversations he liked to have, period. “All I’m saying is, even if it wasn’t my fault, I’m still sorry about what happened at the Burrow. Wherever I go friction and conflict follows and that might not always be my fault but I’m definitely not innocent in this game.”
,” he uttered softly, for what was probably the first time in years. The floo had brought him back to Harry’s house. The house he basically lived in now, but he thoroughly doubted he’d still be welcome there after the scene at the Burrow. Not that he regretted his words. Not yet, anyway.
“Draco…” Harry shifted his weight but didn’t move closer. He was ever the gentleman. “Please.”
“Harry…”
He’d finally gotten fed up with him and went on his own. Not that he’d gotten any further than the waiting room so far. Going to see Draco would make it real. In the end he even fell asleep in the waiting room, still no closer to leaving his spot. The longer he waited, the scarier it got. Death wasn’t funny. Jokes about it might be, but death itself, death of a loved one, it was frightening.
melt when he heard those words, and he certainly didn’t get a dopey smile on his face. “Just don’t throw them out. That’s all there is to it.”
Some part of me hopes you will write back, as an... acquaintance of some sort. I will not be so bold as to assume you would want to be friends. I hope life will treat you better for now on.
“I do.” Harry laced their fingers together and squeezed. “But there’s no need to apologise for that. Merlin knows you’re the only one stubborn enough to stick with me when I get into one of my moods. Also, if we’re going to be a disaster father and a teddy bear, you are totally the teddy bear.”
Luna chuckled. “Thank yourself. It’s not my doing.”
“I feel like that too sometimes, you know? Invisible. The only attention my aunt and uncle ever gave me was negative. They saw me as their servant, and later this world saw me as their hero. I was always so scared no one saw me as
Rose was ecstatic. Uncle Harry was smiling again. She hopped off his lap so Uncle Harry could sit on the bed. He looked very serious and focussed, which was all wrong if you asked her. The most magical kisses were gentle and light. Like the ones her dad gave her mum after a long day of hard work in the kitchen.
If it hadn’t been for Mrs. Weasley, she would not have eaten or drank anything during those days. It was very odd, being mothered over by a woman her own age who had despised everything Narcissa used to believe in. Especially because Narcissa was a mother herself, and because her own mother had never been so caring.
I knew you would say that. I can’t help it though, it’s how I’ve always been. I try not to, but it doesn’t always work.
I am glad you told me about your Dreamless sleep habit. My mother has a history of addiction with those so I never took them, but I do have experiences with people close to me taking them because of that. She says it helps her if she does something active before bed like jogging, and then reads a peaceful book until she falls asleep. Another tip would be a white noise machine, they make it easier to fall asleep and calm your mind for some, though others absolutely hate them. You have to find out and see what works for you.
That made Draco turn around. Both the words, and the fact that they were spoken as an insecure whisper. But instead of asking one of the million questions on his mind, Draco just looked at Harry. He looked and he
“Harry?”
Draco nodded and looked up. He felt his parental side take over, felt the tremor in his hands disappear. It was true, what Harry said. Scorpius needed him. He’d already lost his mother, had already been traumatized by too many prodding Healers before, and now everything was happening again.
“I’ll ask him if he feels up to telling you himself, okay?” Neville turned around to ask, only to discover that a blanket-wrapped Draco Malfoy was standing right behind him, with the purest,
“But you said it’s important to ask before you do something with other people.” Scorpius frowned. “What if I don’t ask, and you don’t feel like it? Then you can’t say no.”
Draco hadn’t been postponing this. He really hadn’t been, with his final exams coming up and Harry bloody Potter having one of his most vital books for a good grade. It would make no sense to postpone, so he hadn’t. There just only happened to be a large enough gap in his planning to see Potter two weeks after the man had reached out to him.
I’m going to confess that I cried while reading your comparison of life to a tapestry. It makes so much sense in my head that I couldn’t stop myself (I didn’t sob - just some silent tears falling). My life, well, it hasn’t been easy. I’ve never wanted people to feel sorry for me, or anything like that, but - this is something that will probably let you guess my name - I didn’t grow up in the wizarding world. I was kept away from everything I know (and take for granted) now. If I think of my life as a tapestry… it started out as dark as it could possibly be. When I received my letter, I can pinpoint that moment as an explosion of colour - bright, bright colours that I associate with one of the happiest moments of my life.
“Oh hush, my love.” His mother chuckled as she interrupted him and strode forward into the room, taking a seat at the edge of the bed. “I do hope we can move past some of the pureblood etiquette that has kept our family apart for so long. I think we’ve both found solid enough ground under our feet to let go of some of the rules.”
She couldn’t cope with the thought. What would happen if she had to deal with the real thing? at the very least the legal department would collapse. She’d joked with Harry that she could make it illegal for Draco to die, but as the days ticked by, that almost became a solid option in her mind. It felt like it was the only thing she could do right now, even though it wouldn’t actually stop Draco from dying obviously.
. It wasn’t judgement. Harry didn’t think he was pathetic. He
Within a second red hot anger bubbled up in Harry’s chest. How dare Robarts not only refuse to acknowledge the health of his Aurors, but also talk about Draco as if he were a petulant child?
“Hello, Harry,” she greeted him happily, in her lilting Irish accent. “I didn’t expect to see you today.”
It can be difficult to see that if your lens is dark, but that is why I am here. To help you past your war experience. I want to make sure that the war will become something you accept as part of your story. Something that you do not suppress (and I am thrilled to hear you will no longer be doing that) but process, then give it a place in your mind, before focussing on where you are now. Because we are no longer at war, and I want you to be aware of that in every aspect of your life. If you do not give your trauma a spot, and you see it again during a flashback, you just hurt yourself twice.
Just like talking to a pet seems silly. My rule over the years has become, if it doesn’t harm, but it does help, there is no reason not to do it. And if you still feel silly after that, just remember muggles talk to a rubber duck when they have issues.
(See the end of the chapter for
Maybe this would be the last straw for him. Which would mean that Scorpius couldn’t play with Harry’s kids anymore, which would leave the kid heartbroken, probably angry with his dad for making his life even more shit.
He was broken. Knackered after more than two weeks of waiting, hoping, praying to all the Gods he suddenly believed in. In fact, he was too tired to keep hurting like this, the maddening stage of pre-grief shlash pre-hope was wrenching the life out of him. He didn’t have the energy to keep on crying, but the tears still fell.
“Can I stay with Grandma, Dad?” Scorpius asked as they went to take their leave. Draco’s son had never been a great fan of crowds, and as it was Saturday, Diagon Alley would be packed.
Behind him a quiet sob reminded him that Harry was still in the room. He turned around to look at him, but Harry just shook his head and gestured for Draco to turn back to Scorpius. “I’m okay, Draco.” Harry smiled through his tears and stepped closer to squeeze Draco’s shoulder for a bit. “I just need to go and ask for a hug from my kids. Plus, I promised them I would tell them how Scorp is doing.”
Scorpius seemed to think about that for a moment, before biting his lip and staring at his knees. “She was holding me while she was making tea. I didn’t like that. And then she started holding me closer and I tried to get away but I couldn’t remember my words and then I saw the white masks again and…”
I am proud of you for stepping away from the situation, and hope you understand and agree with me on why I feel so proud. Sometimes there is nothing we can do and that sucks but it is the way of life, and we will have to deal with that.
Potter just laughed, the git. Draco sent him a glare for his efforts and stalked over to the secluded booth in the corner. The first time he’d come here, he’d only ordered once Potter was in the back, and had sat exactly where he was sitting now.
“Draco.” Harry squeezed his hand, making him snap back into the present just in time to hear the Healer’s last words.
“Ey, don’t kiss the messenger.” Harry chuckled and pulled Draco into a quick one armed hug. “I’m just doing the donkey work.”
“Shut up. I love you.”
“Is the-, is the tea cold now?”
No parents should ever have to see their child’s funeral.
But then he paused.
. And you can keep the coffee. It was average at best, definitely not good enough to have to see your face each time I drink it.”
. You just wait and see.”
“Yes!” he yelled, beaming at his grandmother before gesturing for Draco to pick him up. “We’re having pancakes!”
Seconds later the door opened again, and Harry came out. He looked broken. A blood vessel in his eye had burst, probably from crying. He held it together though as he nodded at Kinsley and greeted his godson and the other child. Then the Weasley matriarch materialised out of nowhere and ushered the three of them away, hopefully towards something resembling a bed.
There was a knock on Neville’s door, which was odd. But what was even stranger, was that Neville was out of bed and heard it. Standing sleep deprived in front of a class full of teenagers was the opposite of a good idea, so normally Neville would be asleep for hours by now. One of his succulents was struggling though, after a couple of students had sneaked into his personal greenhouse and had disturbed its growth. Sleeping was out of the question until he knew for sure that the little guy would pull through.
Hello
Just not good enough. He was never good enough. His son was shy but he was lively. He should have noticed that it was odd that just after getting dressed he’d gone just as quiet as Albus usually was. But there were kids to entertain, letters to answer, lunch to make and in all the hectics of the day all four of them had found themselves shocked when they saw the very, very still, limp form of Scorpius Malfoy on the couch. He was cold, he had blue specks on his skin, responded sluggishly at first and not at all minutes later. It was exactly like the worst days of the blood curse. The days Draco had been sure he would lose him, and now…
“I’m sorry. I won’t touch you if you don’t want me to.” Harry looked ashen as he sat on the floor next to him. “But if there is anything I can do to help, anything at all, just tell me. Please. I hate seeing you hurt like this. And if this is because of your past, if you’re scared my friends are judging you because of your mark, I can assure you that they don’t. You’ve changed so much, none of them even dislike you right now, even though Ron won’t say that out loud.”
“What, a brilliant man who learned from his mistakes and turned into an amazing and thoughtful person?” Harry pulled him close again, resting their heads together. “Draco, you’re not teaching Scorpius your mistakes or your past racism, you’re teaching him how to self-reflect; how to always keep improving; how to be a compassionate and kind man. If he grows up to be like you he’ll turn out to be amazing. Now stop worrying so much about him. He’s doing great.”
Draco nodded, feeling warmth spread through his chest because his view on consent was rubbing off on Harry. “Just don’t fidget. I’m not good with light touches when I’m anxious.”
“You are quite right, Minister.” Both he and Hermione turned their heads towards the nurse who had just exited Malfoy's room. “Which is why I am quite happy to share with you that we have just detected brain activity. That does not mean Mr Malfoy is waking up, but it does mean that the oxygen cut off did not damage his nerve cells. If he wakes up, odds are he will make a full recovery.”
“Everyone says goodbye in their own way.” Draco gave Harry another warm smile along with a stack of books. When he explained each book his voice went slightly into professional mode to his own surprise. Though he had never really talked to Arthur Weasley much, he had seen what a caring, loving father he’d been. He didn’t doubt he would be greatly missed.
“In my bed. You have a fever and tried to go to work anyway, you idiot. So I took you home. Well, first I got myself fired, then I took you home. I made soup!”
Draco snorted. “I suppose that’s true.”
It took Draco nearly half an hour get to his feet after Scorpius had left. His son might have bounced back from the argument, but Draco wasn’t that flexible anymore. Maybe he never had been. His own words kept going in circles inside his own head.
“Stop being so nice and understanding, you prick.” Draco sniffed as he lifted his head form Harry’s shoulder. “I can’t call you an idiot if you do that.”
Hello Draco,
George snorted. “I’ll remind you you’re a Weasley too, you know.”
His vision started going in and out of focus. A nurse stopped by and tried to calm him down, first with words and then with calming draught but the first didn’t work and the second he refused. Calming draught felt like a straight jacket, forcing his panic down in a way that somehow only made it feel worse. James had left his lap at some point, and to his shame Draco had to say he wasn’t sure where he’d gone off to.
“Why would I leave the bravest man I know?”
“What on earth for?”
without every word disappearing the very second it arrived.
Uncle Harry opened his mouth to kindly call her silly again, but then he closed it. And then he frowned. “You know what, why the hell not?”
“I fear that.” Draco looked at his knees, just like his son did when he was saying difficult things. “I don't want him to adore or follow me. I'm not exactly a good example to live up to.”
Please don’t pet your cat until she’s bald. I’d feel horrible if that happened because I stopped writing. I have no intention of stopping, even if I feel like this letter is all over the place with my rambling.
“Draco, my sweet darling, have you looked in the mirror in the past few days?” Pansy stared at him over the edge of her sunglasses. “I know you’re quite new to the gay dating scene, but even a tory can tell you’re a catch.”
“It wasn’t really that big a deal.” Draco sighed, figuring that it was best to get it over with now. “Mrs Weasley was holding Scorpius and he wanted her to let go. She didn’t, he screamed, I barged in and made a mess of the whole thing. I was trying to make her see that consent is just as much a thing for kids as for adults, but I was angry and she felt attacked and now we left in a fight. And then I met Percy Weasley today, who took his mother’s side and started the whole argument again, and before that I met Ginny who is on my side and now I’m scared I’ve caused a rift in a family I’m not even part of.”
“We should get going, though,” Hermione brought their attention back to her. “Long night tomorrow for two of us so we should get a good night’s rest.” Draco and Pansy — mostly Draco — agreed wholeheartedly to this. As they left the library, Hermione whispered, while giving each of them a brief hug, “I don’t want to see either of you at breakfast,” before setting off down the corridor, up the stairs.
Also, (if, again, you’re from Destinia) this is not the story I said I would be working on. I have been working on that one (50k+ already) and the beta reader submissions for that one and the second part of Destinia are still open (see notes at the end of the chapter for more information). I do not really need any betas for this story, but you are welcome to become one if you want to.

Harry woke up two days later with the strangest feeling ever. He shuffled restlessly, searching for what was unnerving him, as he caught sight of Ginny snoozing next to him. He couldn’t bring himself to smile as he used to and instead frowned at her.
Draco smiled as he found the parchment tucked halfway into the book. He took the parchment out, reading it aloud for Pansy.

And it was. Draco lay down on his bed, spent from his hiding and eavesdropping. The information about the Stone was useful, but that dragon sparked more interest with him. The door to his dormitory slowly creaked open, and a figure walked inside.
“Thanks,” she said. “Is there anything I have to watch out for tomorrow? While we’re bringing the dragon away,” she added.
“Don’t worry, it’s me,” it said.
Draco put his hands on his hips, leaning forward slightly and lowering his voice to a menacing whisper. “Otherwise

be slow,” Draco explained, sighing.
Hope you enjoy!
“Oh, you!” Hermione exclaimed, laughing, hitting him playfully on his arm. Draco’s grin widened slightly before joining in on the laughter of the two girls. Hermione was the first to sober up. “You know more than us, don’t you, Malfoy,” she stated, still slightly breathless, and resulted in spectacularly making both him and Pansy stop their fits of laughter.
Before he could prepare himself, Weasley had jumped up from his seat and at him, wrestling him to the ground. They were rolling on the ground and Draco aimed a fist at Weasley’s nose, making blood trickle out of it.
With a crack, the egg split into pieces and a baby dragon flopped out of it, falling onto the table. Draco thought Potter’s description of a crumpled black umbrella suited the black lump well. From his position at the window, he didn’t have as good a view as those inside, though he had a good view of the tail, black with small stubs, not long yet.

Draco Lucius Malfoy, well-known slut at and around Hogwarts, gay, bottom, and pleasantly surprised as Marble, his albino eagle owl, had brought him a special letter on a stormy November evening. It read,
“Pansy’s right,” Draco said, making the brunette’s eyes snap to him instead. “Snape’s trying to make sure nothing happens to Potter.”
Even though in the middle of class, he was achingly hard. He tried not to pay attention to it, keeping his hands firmly atop the desk, holding his legs still and slightly spread. It didn’t lessen.
“Yes?” he wondered.
“I can’t really think of one,” he admitted, biting his lip and shrugging. Draco noticed the bulge tenting Potter’s jeans and smirked slightly.
She took a deep breath. “I know you used the Leg-Locker Curse on Neville—” Draco’s breath hitched. “—and I know I could learn it myself, but I was wondering if you could teach me instead...” Draco’s eyes widened in surprise. He knew him and the girl weren’t necessarily enemies anymore, but he had never expected she’d come to him for something like that.
,” he explained briefly. Hermione crossed her arms and pouted childishly.
?” he heard Hagrid say, his voice muffled, after the dragon sneezed and almost put the wooden table on fire.
“Sure,” she said, rolling her eyes with a grin. She planted a passionate kiss on his mouth, leading him up to the eighth year boys’ dormitory.
There was only one thing that Draco was against in that whole scenario; he had to
Draco took a deep breath as he entered the hospital wing. Looking around, he quickly noticed Weasley sitting on one bed, glaring as he looked back.
“Well,” Harry started in an attempt to clear his name, “I wouldn’t call it cheating. He wouldn’t either. It was just me experimenting with my sexuality because I was unsure.”
spotted some money on the ground!” Draco’s stomach clenched as he knew what was coming.
Harry sighed wearily, glancing at Ginny’s peaceful sleeping face next to him. He had not enjoyed that in the slightest. The only thing that made him come had been the persistent thoughts of Malfoy. Well, at least he still liked her romantically...

it... and you,” Pansy blurted out, looking at Hermione apologetically.
, he reminded himself of his motto. The letter read,
Reaching the hut, he walked to the window with a gap in the curtains and looked inside. There, on the table, laid a huge black egg, deep cracks covering its surface. Draco saw as the four occupants of the small room drew their chairs to the table and started staring intensely at the egg.
“Right,” she whispered back.
I hope to see you soon.
Enjoy!
Hermione smirked. “Is that so?” she asked sarcastically, giving each of them a look. “All right.” She turned around and left.
The three spent a lot of their time conspiring about everything Quirrell and Dark Lord related until it was around four o’clock and they feared getting caught. Together, they filled about ten or twelve scrolls of parchment with information, suspicions and possibly correct conclusions. They split at the entrance of the library, and Draco had the once-in-a-lifetime experience to watch a hug between Hermione and his best friend happen.
He could easily recall when Potter’s breath had got weary, his thrusts sloppy but not any less hard and fast. He could hear his groans of pleasure, feel Potter’s dick pulsing inside him, smell sex wherever he went, even more and stronger than he was used to.
you have more important things to worry about than the book, Granger?” Draco teased, taking out the book. She eyed it confused as he started flipping page after page. “Isn’t there the thing about Snape wanting to steal the Philosopher’s stone? And him threatening Quirrell? And aren’t you planning on drawing revision timetables and colour-coding all your notes?”
.” He stood back up, confidently crossing his arms. “And we wouldn’t want that now, would we?”
“I think we’re gonna have to clear some things up with Granger,” Draco laughed at the end of the short part. Pansy looked thoughtful.
The girl, if possible, became even more nervous. “I’m worried about Harry, Malfoy... Snape hates him and I don’t want him to get hurt,” she whispered, her voice begging. Draco still had one eyebrow raised as he eyed the girl apprehensively.
to get caught,” she moaned. Draco and Pansy sniggered.
“Yes, dear?” Madam Pomfrey asked, and Draco looked up at the woman nearing him. “Is there something you need?”
Madam Pomfrey returned the smile, though slightly hesitant. “All right. But not longer than fifteen minutes, Mr Weasley needs his rest.”
“Keep your voice down or we’ll get kicked out, and then Hermione and I won’t be the only ones with detentions,” Draco said in a low, warning tone.

Draco took his own book from his bag and opened it, laying it on the table and well aware of the four eyes on him while flipping to the last inked pages.
He finished his breakfast quickly, aware of the bothers Malfoy’s presence would bring him. And getting hard was all too likely when you were still feeling drowsy early in the morning.
“I didn’t cheat, Ron,” he made Potter say, mentally cringing at the first name and telling him to straighten his back. He could finally see the situation without a crowd of bothers covering everything. Weaslette standing in disgusted shock in front of Potter, Weasley and Granger just out of the Hall to his right. “I can show you the correspondence, which strongly states that anything beside shagging would be considered cheating.”
sure of that, Madam Pomfrey,” Draco responded with a polite smile.
“You’re a fagot,” she stated, looking disgusted. “How did you even—?” She cut herself off, shaking her head while grimacing. She took a wary step back, and Harry’s heart dropped to his stomach. He hadn’t realised people wouldn’t accept him... Why hadn’t Malfoy warned him about this?!
,” she responded, shrugging, and Draco let out the breath he didn’t know was holding. He wasn’t looking forward to fighting. He turned towards the girl.
“What? Where?” Draco followed Hermione’s finger and saw Potter diving towards the ground.
They had
Draco laughed a little and leaned back in his seat, arms folded behind his head. “That’s Severus for you.”
**Notes at end of chapter**
“Bonkers!” she whispered, aghast. Draco nodded enthusiastically in agreement. There seemed to be something wrong in the
“You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?” Draco said when he thought he had waited long enough, catching two of the people’s attention in front of him, determined to make it three. “It’s people they feel sorry for,” he continued in a drawl. “See, there’s Potter, who’s got no parents,—” That one hurt him emotionally. “—then there’s the
Draco sat on his bed the next night, leaning against the headrest and busying himself with a sex book to get him fired up, as he waited on Potter. He wore only an oversized black shirt and black stockings. No pants, as the letter had asked (it hadn’t really been a demand). He would have sex with Potter in about five minutes, and he wasn’t at all nervous. Most people would, naturally, if you were planning to have sex with your

He started reading, occasionally saying things like: “You’re gonna be late
He dropped the Cloak upon entrance, groaning in his hands as he rubbed his face. Fuck, he was gay. That had to have been the best sex he had ever had. Hurrying to get ready for the night, he ignored his half-hard cock as he changed into his pyjamas and climbed into his bed. He lay on his back, looking up at the canopy, ignoring the aching of his cock telling him it wanted more.
well;
!” he spat. “Now, what do you want?”
After fifteen minutes, he groaned, grabbing his wand and spelling the hangings shut, placing a silencing charm on it. He pushed his pyjama bottoms and pants down, cock jumping free. He jerked off quickly, mind effortlessly supplying the image of himself pounding into Malfoy.
Well, two truths out, let’s go for three.
(Weird, as most greetings were along the lines of ‘hey, slut’.)
Hello everyone!
night, one o’clock in the library.” She walked over to the door as Draco gave her a confirming nod. “Anything else to do?” she asked, right before closing the door.
“Now, what do you say?” He held out his hand as Weasley’s frustrated frown turned into a glare. “See it as a payback for the Quidditch match.”
This is the last official chapter, and I hope you enjoyed the story!
, who’ve got no money—” He did not feel sorry for that one at all, while turning to focus his attention more on his next target. "—you should be on the team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.”
Two days passed, and Draco had severe trouble keeping up with Transfiguration. He kept glancing at Potter, sitting to his right in a row in front of him, absently looking him up and down. Getting Potter off his mind had been a big trouble those past days. It kept mentally coming up in moments not very suited for it. Slowly, small details he hadn’t even noticed, returned, catching him off guard.
how was I supposed to know?”
“Neither of us meant that...” he admitted softly, arms wrapping around himself, unsure of how to protect himself anymore.
idea, Pans,” he whispered as Professor Sinistra started the class.
Draco sighed and, together with some of Pansy’s help, explained everything they’d found out about Snape and Quirrell. By the end, Hermione’s mouth was gaping open, though her eyes shined with understanding.
crazy!” she whispered.
!?” she exclaimed, her voice an excited whisper. “How was it?”
well if I say so myself,” she answered, grinning. “Now, spit out. What do we have to know about Snape?”
It seemed like the three were skipping.
“You can go to sleep now, alright?” Harry pushed a sweaty strand of hair out of Draco’s face, getting a grateful murmur in reply. It made him smile. “I’ll be here when you wake up. You can just focus on getting better.”
laugh, which Rose hated. She wished people would just explain what she got wrong instead of laugh at her. But at least Harry looked a tiny bit less sad. “Uncle Harry, I think you should kiss your princess.”
“Probably, yes.” Draco stepped back and tugged on his arm. “Now come on, big man. I’d like to sleep for a bit and we can’t start without you.”
“He is, isn’t he?” And suddenly Uncle Harry was looking sad again as his eyes went back to his Princess. “But kissing him doesn’t work. Oddly enough I tried that already.”
I can’t explain it, but… your letter does make me feel that I can trust you. You have a way with words, and I believe you could be the right person. It’s comforting to know that you’re an expert in this kind of stuff, because like I said in my last letter, I’ve never done this before.
“I was, but I can’t let my customers walk out looking dead on their feet. It would be bad for business.”
My boggart in fourth year was my bed. My own bed, where behind closed curtains, my mind was doing a damned good job at preparing me for the fear of war we were about to experience. It was not triggered by trauma, but by my bloodline. The Black family has always had a history of mental illness. I still take medication now, because even though my PTSD is as well managed as it can be, a lack of what the muggles call ‘your happy hormone’ will never get fixed with therapy. I will have to take medication for the rest of my life in order to stay alive. It is a chronic illness, and one that I cannot possibly deal with on my own.
idea. Drinking away your problems didn’t work,  Draco had first had experience with it. Not that anyone knew that, and he was definitely ashamed about it, but he wasn’t going to tell anyone about that. Which only left him with one more option, since most of his humiliations had been made public during his trial.
Kudos and comments are much appreciated!
“Stop,” Draco whispered into his neck. “You’re worse than Harry.”
be legal dammit!
“Something else happened before I went to Andy with the kids.”
But Draco stayed as he was, breathing in and out, with no change in sight. Maybe it was time for Harry to accept that.
“Are you feeling alright, Draco?” Luna asked when all chatter had died away. “Your energy is quite dark.”
I could say I'm sorry, but I'm really not.....
about.”
Or at least she thought she wouldn’t, until that horrifying moment when Narcissa’s swan Patronus had flown into her office. Apparently, Potter had let her down. Though that wasn’t actually fair of her. Pansy was the one who knew Draco better than anyone. If she hadn’t left him with Potter, she could have stopped him from going in, maybe. Could have stopped this stupid, reckless action.
“There is.” A smile pulled on her cracked lips. Astoria’s breathing was laboured, shallow, and accompanied by no good noises. They were talking about days now, possibly hours. In all likeliness this was the last conversation he would ever have with her. “Don’t devote your life to raising our son. Be strong for him, help him learn his way in life, but don’t forget yourself. Don’t forget to live. Go find yourself some happiness, love. Find yourself a new life and live it like there’s no tomorrow. That’ll make me smile from up above.”

As for feeling guilty about not using your magic, I really would advise against that because it really is not a good idea to use uncontrolled magic in a situation like that. When you are angry or afraid or you try to hurt someone when you are in that state, things can quickly go too far. You might try to push people aside with a spell and end up crushing them against a wall. Someone tried to stop me once when I was doing something catastrophically stupid and ended up nearly killing me, while in hindsight not doing anything would have saved both of us a lot of harm.
Draco fell more than sat down in his chair and only replied in the shape of a groan. Harry shook his head. The idiot would work himself to death one day if he kept this up. Not that the rest of the Auror department was any help, with the way they encouraged Draco’s unhealthy work addiction. Harry doubted Draco was even happy here, but they hadn’t been on friendly terms long enough for him to ask. Plus, it wasn’t like Harry himself was having the time of his life as an Auror, yet he’d never told anyone about that either.
He hadn’t, though, because no matter his cold exterior, Draco was nothing if not loyal and concerned about his friends. She distinctly remembered waking up in the maternity ward with Ron in the other room looking after their newborn together with Harry, while Draco sat right next to her, knitting away like he was giving Molly a run for her money. Draco couldn’t knit when he was stressed, his hands shook too much, which meant Hermione didn’t even have to ask about her child. The tapping of Draco’s knitting needles told her enough, which was probably exactly why Draco had been doing it.
I am so sorry for taking so long! i was moving house and didn't have any internet last weekend....
“A very normal thing to do, enjoying time spent in a murder cafe.”
At least that’s what he figured happened when he woke up many many hours later, just past two AM with the Weasley matriarch asleep next to him in a family room of the hospital. He couldn’t recall much. Just some talking between him and little Rosie, and an idea… that probably didn’t work. But he didn’t remember trying it, so maybe…
“Oh.” Rose deflated a bit. She really thought it might have done the trick. “Maybe it will work if you really want it. If you give him a magical kiss.”
“Ha bloody ha, Malfoy,” Harry replied. He still hadn’t mastered the craft of creative non-swear word use. “Just because you-”
The stern look that went with the last of her words had Draco mute for several seconds as Molly walked off with his son. This was only their second meal at the Burrow. The first had been a while back on, New Year’s eve, but Scorpius had fallen asleep by ten, providing an excellent excuse to leave early. They had no such luck now, as Ron’s birthday party had started in the early afternoon.
“Okay.” Harry sniffed again and finally managed to pull Draco properly under the covers again. “I promise I won’t throw you out, Draco Malfoy.”
“Harry, I’ve been drawn to you since that very first time I saw you in Madam Malkin’s getting your robes fitted. That’s twenty years ago now and in all those years it would have been best for me to hate you, or leave you alone at the very least, and I’ve never been able to do that. I’ve always been drawn to you, I really doubt that will ever change. Weeds are hard to kill.”
did choose to have you one way or another. When you sign up for a kid, you sign up for giving them love.
His face hit the hardwood surface with a dull thud, his eyes closing soon after. Somewhere far away he heard an agitated discussion, but his mind was too slugging to process that information. Merlin, but he hated Christmas.
Potter’s eyes shone with mirth. “Oh, but I think I can be both,
“Draco…” Harry sighed in such a way that Draco knew he would have to come clean. Harry would never pressure him, but he would come up with all kinds of sob stories and feel guilty about those all night. Draco couldn’t have that.
“It was your safe haven when the rest of your life was utter shit.” Ellis came to sit next to him and put an arm around his shoulders. “It reminds you of your brief, blissfully safe breaks between all the work you had to do, but it can’t do that without also bringing back the memories of what you were trying to escape.”
Harry was at anchoring him. How incredibly grateful he was that he had someone at his side this time, someone to keep him warm and make sure he ate and make sure he wasn’t
“That’s what I thought.” Draco once again tugged at Neville’s arm, and soon enough he found himself next to Draco and Harry in his own, now enlarged, bed. Harry was safely plastered against Draco’s chest, not unlike the way small children slept with their stuffed animals. Neville found it rather endearing, though he would never say that out loud.
“I try,” Draco whispered, sadness tugging at his soul as he watched his son. “It's not easy, being Draco Malfoy's son.”
Draco wasn’t awake enough to really register what Harry was saying, just awake enough to hug back, latch on to the kindness in the words, try to bury himself in the warmth and comfort that was Harry.
“I did.” Draco glared at Harry before starting to undress. “James didn’t think your story telling had been adequate, so he thought it was a good idea to join us. Albus demanded a longer story because James was there, taking up half the story, and then Scorpius tried to explain that James took up a third, not a half, but he was already half asleep so you can imagine how well that went.” He tossed his clothes on the laundry chair, skipped his own pyjamas and grabbed an old pair of joggers from Harry. When he was awake he’d complain about how vulgar and horrid the things were, but for now he just needed their cozy warmth if he wanted to survive the night. “Budge over, Potter. You’re on my side.”
“But you
“No, no, I mean why are
Harry sighed. “Draco…”
“Potter!” Robart’s fury looked like it could match Harry’s. “You better come back with a better attitude tomorrow or don’t come back at all!”
And revealing magic to muggles is never a good idea. Some take it well, but a lot of them are terrified of the unknown and can get violent, plus the harm of a botched obliviation job is quite severe and more common than you might think. Not stepping in in this case prevented hurt rather than caused it.
“Anything you need. Just say the word, alright?”
. But that was exactly the offer Astoria didn’t want him to make, so he didn’t. “I wish there was something I could do.”
“Yes yes I’ll hurry up!” He whisper-yelled, though there was no one around to hear them. “I’m just not a very great flyer, okay? You know that. Just give me a minute.”
. I want to quit the aurors and be a stay at home dad.”
Nothing. He had nothing to claw at. He didn’t even have anything to claw with. He was just a
Draco hadn’t had many panic attacks when Harry was there. Usually the other man calmed him down before things got that far. Still, it had happened a few times and Harry hadn’t forgotten about how to deal with them. He removed the suffocating blankets and pulled Draco up, letting him rest sideways on his chest while Harry began to rub his back. No doubt a tip he’d gotten from his mother.
Draco curled up further, hands pressing against his hip and upper leg. He had a curse scar there. It looked horrid and twisted, like something had boiled him from the inside out. Harry had never dared to ask where it came from, he just knew it acted up in bad weather, or when Draco felt low or upset or stressed. Mostly all the time, really.
“You don’t bother me with your rants. In fact I love your rants, because if you rant then I can do the same. Ginny hated it when I did that. The brooding, the explosions of frustration, the fixation on certain things, she refused to put up with them, and rightfully so. And I do still try to stop doing that, but when it does happen you mind them an awful lot less. I’m nothing if not grateful for that.”
“Breathe for me, okay? Here, hold my hand, squeeze it as hard as you can and

refuse to let you and the other Aurors bully him to death with your petty antics. He’s coming home with me. Find someone to cover his shift. Or don’t, I honestly couldn’t give a flying Hippogriff’s cunt.”
“I said he looked famished and exhausted, I never said alive and well,” he snapped, pissed that his friends didn’t have his back. “Look, all I want is for you two to ask around to see if anyone knows how to contact him. He left a book in my shop, and I’d like to know that he didn’t faint somewhere or fall in front of a tube in the underground, alright?”
That last line raised a million questions for Draco, but he felt a bit too overwhelmed to say anything at the moment. He just gaped at Potter some more before taking a sip of his coffee. Despite it having gone tepid, it still tasted amazing.
’s to it, but Draco had never had a such a hopeful talk before. Something inside him told him this was going to work, and he resolutely refused to listen to any of the other voices inside his head.
Narcissa stayed silent, her breathing slow and steady. Harry took a deep breath, tore his gaze away from her, and winced. However much it hurt to look at Draco’s mother, looking at her son was way worse. His pale cheeks, firmly closed eyes, greyish skin tone, expressionless face…
“You spoil him, Draco,” his mother criticised after she told the kid to go fetch his coat. Draco rolled his eyes. As if she hadn’t fed him sweets at every opportunity she’d gotten when he was young.
“I’ll bring dinner to the greenhouses, how does that sound?”
I really do not expect you to write back to me, but I do hope that you will consider listening to some of my advice. Cut off this part of the letter and throw it out if you have to, but I would hate for your progress to be lost. I will communicate with my superiors about getting you a different correspondent. I know I said it was up to you, but I do not think I can continue to write to you like this. In my head that will never be my place. I am so sorry.
“You feel that too?” Harry’s question sounded so genuine Draco looked up, straight into tear filled green eyes. “Like you’re just trying to postpone the inevitable? Like you can never be fixed, you can just pretend you’re not broken?”
He wouldn’t say he was close with the man, but Malfoy’s boyfriend was by far his best Auror he had, and the things Malfoy had done for queer rights in the magical world had left him in awe. It had been Malfoy who’d dug out and dusted off the many accounts of same-sex relationships in the old, really old, days. Relationships between ancient pureblood families still in the Wizengamot today. A brilliant move. No proper pure-blood would ever speak evil of their ancestors, and with the powerful voice of the old pureblood families behind their cause, same-sex marriage had been approved as a new right within a year.
In the end that attention just made him feel more alone.
George huffed. “It’s a little more than a scratch, though.”
.” Neville sighed, trying very hard not to sound annoyed or pitiful. That wasn’t how he thought about Draco or Harry. He just wanted the both of them to see that they were loved, that they loved each other, and that they didn’t have to be perfect in order for that to happen. “Why can’t you see that?”
He didn’t think he’d ever go back to any parts of his old life. Ten years after his exile, his sentence ended and he was allowed back into magical Britain. Immediately he was scouted by the newfound Muggle Integration Department from the ministry of magic, founded by none other than Arthur Weasley and now run by Dennis Creevey. Life had really started looking up after that.
“I’m sorry about her. I still haven’t gotten around replacing my friends with decent human beings.” Draco was so

tea. Something told her that she needed to be at the hospital tonight. As soon as she realised that, she slipped out of bed and quickly got dressed before Flooing to St Mungo’s. She knew the way like she knew her broom. She was friends with Harry after all.
He did care about his grades and his internship, that wasn’t what he meant, but everything else in his life could fuck off for all he cared. His sense of fashion, keeping his flat somewhat clean, not drinking juice straight out of the bottle or having dinner with ice cream. Or his friends for that matter.
“I’m fine.” He scraped his throat a couple of times before he spoke again. Harry squeezed his hand under the table, and the gesture brought tears to his eyes. This had been bound to happen at some point, but it didn’t mean he had to like it. “It’s just, I used to work here, and I wasn’t in a very good place at the time. It just brings back memories.”
Malfoy frowned. “I thought you were closing shop.”
“You’re
“Then maybe ask for his number?” Pansy pushed her sunglasses to the tip of her nose and let out a whistle. “Holy Hell, Draco. You weren’t wrong, that guy can eat me for breakfast, lunch and dinner.”
Harry turned his back on the eggs he was baking and smiled when he saw Draco, though his face fell when he saw the half pulled on robes.
“And you don’t agree with her.”
“Ugh, you’re impossible!” Draco swatted him and pretended to look mad. “And I’m still not a teddy bear.”
“That’s not our standard procedure, Mr Malfoy.” The Healer pointed out. Draco grumbled. It wasn’t just Mrs weasley who was stuck in old patterns and habits. Besides him, Harry sat up a little straighter, no doubt wearing his old but still effective Auror face. Though he hated that this was what it took, Draco was more than happy when the movement finally made the Healer recoil. “But I’ll make sure to pass the request along to our staff, Mr Malfoy.”
“Draco? Nev? You in there?”
“You hold him close.” Neville found the answers came to him quite naturally. “You hold him close, you make sure he knows he’s loved, you get him tea, you make him see a therapist. He doesn’t have to tell you anything, because this is
Draco fell silent then, but something told Harry his story wasn’t over. “The things they did… I was captivated by it. Terrified and fascinated. I wanted to belong so badly back then. But when I didn’t fit in, my father…. He cast me out. Some ancient warding demons rite, in our seventh year. He knew I was…
It took a while before Draco began to talk. Harry thought he might not speak at all at first.
Harry pulled him even closer as Draco tried to gather enough courage to keep talking.
George had never been very good at dealing with death. Even now, many years after the war, he still hadn’t come to grips with the loss of Tonks or Remus or Mad Eye. He wasn’t as bad as Fred though. There had been an almost manic fear of death in his twin ever since he nearly got buried under a pile of rubble during the Battle of Hogwarts. It had taken years for them to be comfortable being apart again, the fear of losing the other too strong.
“I’m alright,” Scorpius piped up, trying his best to make his voice sound full instead of cracked from exhaustion and narcotics. “‘M just tired.”
You are right to think I do not agree with beating yourself up about things that happened in the past. I know how tempting that can be, but it will not change what happened and you can use that energy for something more useful. Not that emotions listen to that kind of reasoning, but it is always worth a try.
“No, having to question every day if you’re good enough yet. If you’ve atoned enough, if you’re a bad person, if you work hard enough. The stress, it
“He’s really quite sad when he thinks no one is looking,” Luna continued, her eyes studying the grain of the wood she sat on. “Tries to run from it, sometimes. But he’s never fast enough.”
Just after the war ended, that house was a safe haven for me, a good, quiet place to go to. Somewhere to be alone with my thoughts, where I could fight the demons inside my head without having to fight the demons of the house as well.
“Thanks.” Harry shot him a small smile, and had nearly turned away when he thought better of it and said, “And Draco, in case you can spare the time, you’d be more than welcome at the Burrow. Or my house, if you’d like. I reckon your son is about as old as my kids. And Molly would love having someone as skinny as you around to feed all her baked goods to. It would help to fill in the gap you know? It’s harder to miss someone when you’re busy.”
“Oh god that was a marvelous day.” Harry snickered. “But I must say you looked quite good covered in glitter. And you did an excellent job convincing Scorpius to get rid of the dress and put on his pyjamas. I would call that fabulous parenting, not disaster parenting.”
“I ripped them, it happens.” Malfoy snapped, the tentative friendly ambiance gone within a second. Malfoy himself looked like he wanted to follow the ambiance right out the door with matching speed, grabbing his coat and the notebook he fell asleep on. “We didn’t all graduate with a million opportunities presenting itself to live our best life,
. It wouldn’t be far from the truth if Harry kept looking at him like that. “Hi, I’m gay. Draco! I’m Draco.”
A child deserved settled down parents who could handle the responsibility. Draco, with his mental health struggles and history of self harm, just didn’t think he was ready yet. He’d even been scared Harry would leave him for that. Which was obviously the most ridiculous thought Draco had ever had. If anything it just made Harry more determined to love him and make a family once they were both ready.
“Good.” Draco smiled, and Scorpius smiled back. “Now, do you want to look at the orchids with your gran? The ones in greenhouse five are just coming into bloom now.”
“Are you mad at me?” Scorpius asked.
It is nice that writing things down helps you, since it is one of the easiest ways to put some distance between you and whatever the thing is you are writing about. Some of my friends found it did nothing for them, and though the alternatives that they found, like talking groups or some very peculiar hobbies, did help them, a piece of parchment and a quill are usually easier to find.
your therapist.
“Draco!” Footsteps. Boots running. Warm hands wrapped around his icy fingers, squeezing them, trying to get him back to the present. But Draco didn’t want to go back to the present. He wanted to stay in this limbo where his thoughts went so fast he couldn’t decipher them, because that way he didn’t have to think about the possibility of losing his son.
Harry threw his head back and laughed. “Oh Merlin, don’t remind me. Or don’t remind Ron and Hermione, actually.
“You could celebrate Christmas with us? I mean, if you’re not too busy with your exams. Because if you’re swamped with work then it must be harder to find someone to spend the holidays with. That’s the sad part, how can anyone invite you over if you’re busy all the time?”
To be happy, and safe, and loved.
There were some
He was too tired to keep clawing at something that wasn’t there. He wanted something to be there. But if nothing came any time soon, he would cease the fight. There was only so much energy one could gather from fleeting thoughts and an empty
“I did.”
? Why do you care? Why are you making me breakfast?” He took a shaky breath, trying to calm himself down and failing hard. He’d ignored Harry, taken ages to reply to his letters, never made time for him, never did anything
“Why-, why are you here?” he asked, his voice shaking as well because
“That’s quite convenient, actually.” Draco turned his gaze to Harry, giving him a good excuse to stop looking at his mum. He chuckled when Harry silently sighed with relief. “My ingredients order came in at the apothecary two days ago. I’ll join you and pick that right up.”
“Doesn’t mean I’ll stop teasing you at every opportunity I get mind you,” Ginny added sharply, a joyful twinkle in her eyes. “And I don’t agree with everything you do. But for the big stuff, for being a parent, you’re doing alright.”
“Did Draco’s hand just move?”
“Come on Draco, I have a lovely couch. Theo made it for me, you know how amazing he is with furniture.” Draco nodded and let himself be guided to the couch. Neville threw a blanket over him as soon as he sat down.
“Truth or dare?”
Until next time.
“Uh, thank you, Potter,” Draco swallowed thickly and bit his bottom lip. He didn’t know what to do with himself in front of Potter, and it didn’t help that the other man seemed quite a lot more confident than he was. “How did you end up owning a coffee shop, anyway?”
I am welcome with you, not because of pain or guilt or anything, but because you want me to meet your family. Because you want me in your life. I can literally feel that in my bones, okay? So don’t be an idiot and stop panicking.”
“Don’t worry, I’ll bring him.” Draco promised with a small smile. And he would. He wouldn’t fail to show up to the Burrow or Harry’s home and the many festivities held there for years to come. First as friend and father, then as blushing date, confident boyfriend, and eventually happy husband. He had never once failed his promise to Astoria, to live each day like there was no tomorrow, to learn how to love himself, to raise their son to be a good lad and a splendid father once his time came.
“I’m sorry daddy,” Scorpius murmured, a heartbreaking quiver in his voice. The little guy was trying to distance himself from Draco, which was difficult as Draco was still carrying him. He would have put him down, but Scorpius couldn’t floo by himself yet and he had to leave this place before Harry came barging in. Scorpius had heard more than enough yelling for one day.
I honestly do not care whether or not you think it is my place to say this. You said you would like to get another letter from me, well, here it is. It is hard to miss, though a lot of things seem to be going over your head, Potter, but I am quite passionate about these things.
late. “I’m more than an hour late! I have patients! Why didn’t you wake me, Harry? Why are you here at all?”
“We’re sleeping as a family?” Scorpius asked, directing his hopeful eyes first at Draco and then at Harry. On her good days, Astoria had insisted they would all sleep together in the same bed so she wouldn’t have to miss anyone. It made Draco both sad and happy that sleeping in the same bed as Harry now meant the same to his son.
again. Though he hadn’t expected his encouraging words to make a very big difference, he had hoped they would steer Draco away from the edge for now. Away from that dark place. It hurt just to think about that not being true. He couldn’t imagine what Draco was
“Says the man who eats more than I do yet still doesn’t have an ounce of body fat.” Harry jokingly poked him in his side. It was true, Draco was and probably always would be skinny. It had its perks, but he would prefer to look a bit more like Harry, with his soft stomach and great,
“You know, we don’t have to have sex, Draco,” Harry said, way too gently for a man who’d just been attacked with a pillow. “I’m quite content to sleep for another hour or so. This bed really is terribly comfortable.”
But even with the Spark gone, he felt less Heavy. The fight in him that had almost died out was back again, not really full force but definitely more present.
“Night, Draco,” Harry whispered, putting an exhausted smile on Draco’s face. “And just so you know, you are a brilliant dad, to more kids than just Scorpius, and don’t you forget it.”
“Which is why we are a better fit than me and Ginny ever were.”
“I fought with her worse than you did.” Harry spoke softly after a few minutes. “I called her an old-fashioned tart. Might have even said something about my aunt and uncle compared to her, but I don’t really remember. I hurt her with what I said, I know that much. But she hurt my family first and I won’t stand for that. And I’m not going back to the Burrow until she apologises.”
“Maybe not your younger self,” Harry agreed, “but you aren't him anymore, Draco. You changed. You are someone to be proud of now. Someone to admire.”
“Would you mind terribly to watch the kids today? I was supposed to meet up with Oliver today and sort of forgot.”
care for him, but apparently so did his colleagues.
. And of course he would. What else was he supposed to ask about? Neville honestly didn’t understand why Draco and Ron weren’t better friends. They were the only two people he knew whose solution to so many problems was
“Only when it comes to such blatant lies.” Draco stuck up his nose. “Now come along, Potter. We have some shopping to do.”
I wasn’t sure what to expect when I sent my letter off. I suppose there is some truth in your words that writing things down helps though because once I had dropped my letter off at the Post Office I did feel a bit better. I don’t have an owl myself. Not anymore. When I did have one, I used to talk to her a lot. Much like you and your cat, I expect. It does help to know that I’m not the only one to talk to a pet.
“Because you
“...Really say how long it will take, but we expect your son to get out of surgery in two to three hours, and as soon as all his vitals check out correctly he’ll be moved to his own room here on the ward. You can wait for him there, the matron knows you don’t have to stick to visiting hours.”
shoulder getting soaked in tears, and hiding the hospital bed from view. And yet it was.
“Don’t-, don’t like sunlight?” Draco sputtered, maybe with a bit more drama than was called for, but he knew Harry liked that about him. “Excuse you, but I happen to
“Harry, it’s barely eight o’clock.” Draco looked at the disaster he called his boyfriend with a raised eyebrow. “Since when did you turn into Lily?”
For once this time though, the difficult words weren’t just a shield to hide behind while presenting bad results. Scorpius had a long road to recovery to go because his natural magic had basically been knocked over the head with a hammer, but only because that cut off the magic supply to the curse, meaning that it would be weak enough to remove fully in a few weeks. Scorpius would have to stay in hospital for that time, getting thrice weekly check ups to ensure the curse wasn’t up to any funny business. If all went according to plan, Scorpius would be fully healthy again in just two months.
It is great to hear I have gained your trust so far; that will make it easier for you to benefit from these letters. Do not be afraid of the unknown, I say, for I promise I will clue you in on everything I am trying to do, and if I ever say something you do not understand, do not be afraid to ask me about it.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy, I would love to.” Harry planted his knees on either side of Draco’s hips and gently cupped his face, angling his head just right before planting one of the softest, nicest kisses on Draco’s lips that he’d ever had. “I love you.”
“He has to be, otherwise he wouldn’t get the official Weasley family member certificate. All of you are absolute nutters.”
I am so sorry for not posting for so long, real life was doing things and I just completely forgot about the existence of this fic. But I promise I'll finish!
“I can’t do this, George,” Harry gripped the back of his shirt so hard it almost ripped. “I can’t keep watching him, hoping in vain that he’ll open his eyes, praying to all the gods I don’t believe in anymore. I can’t, I can’t, I
“The pain is a reminder of what I did. I can’t face your family knowing that.” Harry hugged his boyfriend closer when his voice threatened to break. He knew that besides being a bully, Draco had helped trying to rebuild Voldemort’s troops, even if the bastard was long dead.
In case you are worried about my cat, she’s been rolling around on my best coat ever since I started writing this letter. I think she is offended that I think writing you is more important than petting her. Judging by the amount of hairs she has left on my coat you would say she will go bald very soon, but so far no luck. Maybe I should have gotten a sphynx instead of a ragdoll, but I would rather die than get rid of her now, even if she ruins all my clothes.
, you have to take this. You have to calm down, love.”
He hoped this time that wouldn’t happen. They knew more about the curse now, and if anyone treated Scorpius unfairly he could always set Harry on them. His boyfriend hated using his fame, and Draco was even more reluctant to use Harry’s name to fix his own problems, but when it came to kids they would use everything they could.
You do not have to talk to them about your bad days, about the times when things feel shit, about your mental health issues. You can keep things light and happy, just as long as you make sure there are
“Because I felt like I had to. You came back so upset yesterday, and you never did tell me what happened.” His mother pulled him close the way only mothers could, and Draco both hated and loved it. The hug made him feel vulnerable, but also safe enough to fall apart and still come out alright. “You don’t have to tell me now, but if you want to get it off your chest….”
.” George shoved Ron back and finally got out of his seat. “I’ll go call him some names.”
“I know.” Harry kissed his nose again. “I’ll make dinner after I owl my parents, okay? We can eat in front of the telly, I know you’re knackered now.”
Draco dropped his head on his drawn-up knees. Honestly, it was a cheap shot, and McLaggen was the one who should be ashamed of himself for it. But alas, the rules left no space for arguing. It was either speak or take a shot, and with his history with alcohol, that would be a
For a short moment, Neville feared Harry meant Draco’s breakdown, but of course that wasn’t true. He meant their getting together, him and Draco finding happiness in each other’s arms. And it was true, Neville had helped a bit here and there, but honestly, it wasn’t much more than occasionally walking past Draco with a bit too much sway in his hip, depositing the potions professor right in Harry’s lap during breakfast.
“I know, Malfoy. Merlin, relax.” Ginny let go of his arm and rolled her eyes. “You seem to forget I was raised by her. The little girl she’d always wanted after six sons. She loved us all to bits, I won’t deny it, but all my clothing was pink until I started putting up daily fights about it. She wouldn’t let me fly with my brothers because Quidditch wasn’t meant for women. I love my mother, but that doesn’t mean I deny her having any flaws. I just wanted to let you know I’m on your side.”
“Draco, you’re awake!” Harry wiped his hands on his apron, which really shouldn’t look sexy on him, yet still did, and walked towards him. “Please ditch those robes. You don’t have to come into work today. I-”
him, to deserve him. He
“No of course not you silly.” Harry sniffed before kissing him square on the lips. “But I have no idea how to care for weeds, so I thought maybe he could help with that.”
Yours,
Harry laughed at that, and Draco sighed with relief. This bit of banter felt like the fresh breath of air he’d been craving for ever since his son had taken ill. It was one thing he had learned from all those weeks in the hospital; Being sick was a serious business, but if that meant being serious all the time you’d go insane. Relieving tension by laughing was always a nicer option than crying your eyes out.
“I can get ugly,” Harry suggested half seriously. “I could inject botox, wear black lenses, remove my nose, maybe get a huge facial tattoo….”
When Harry entered Draco’s room after silently sneaking away from Mrs. Weasley, he was met by another mother. Draco’s mother, who was curled up next to her son, fast asleep. Harry didn’t think he’d ever seen her this stressed and tired before. She looked crushed and scared even in her sleep.
. Fucking dimples, it wasn’t
I know it’s a bad idea to use uncontrolled magic. I found myself using accidental magic as a child - though I didn’t know it seeing as I didn’t know I was a wizard - and it wasn’t received well. My aunt and uncle… well, they used to hide me away because they were terrified that people would think I wasn’t “normal”. They used to tell people I attended St Brutus’ school for the criminally insane. To be honest, I’m surprised I never developed some kind of complex.
But Draco didn’t even respond. He just slumped against him, seemingly too tired to even sit up. Neville’s heart ached with worry as he watched the pain of his friend.
, Draco’s mind mumbled.
George shook his head.
His heart rate shot up, even though he wasn’t sure he actually had a heart in that moment. At the very least the panic was back, full force as he clawed and clawed at-
“No, no, Potter. I’ll do it.” He’d only been teasing Harry. In fact he rather liked his chill work schedule now that it meant he could play stay-at-home-dad with Harry and occasionally Ron. Which reminded him that if he wanted some entertainment, he could always send the four kids to the Granger-Weasley’s with a jar of glitter and watch the chaos unfold. He held out his arms and beckoned Harry to come closer. “Kiss.”

as he always says.” Draco smiled at the thought, before growing serious. “Would you kill me?”
something, but there was nothing to be done except sit tight and wait.
“It’s not a bad sign?” Teddy and Parkinson asked in unison. They were competing for the title of pulling the most shocked, surprised and carefully hopeful face. Ginny almost laughed at the sight, but the pain in her heart stopped her. The hope in the faces of the three people next to her was so pure and so painfully desperate she couldn’t possibly laugh anymore when she saw that.
“Yes, sweetheart.” Pansy chuckled before sipping at her own beer. “You can thank me at your wedding. His name is Harry, by the way. Best remember that before you go down on one knee for him. Or, you know, when you go down on both.”
for me. Etiquette for all kinds of situations have been drilled into me since I was two years old
I’ve watched my best friend suffer under his stupidity and impulsiveness. He’s nice to the world, but he’s terrible to his lover, and I am left to pick up the goddamn pieces every time. And if there are no pieces left to pick up this time, I swear to Circe’s pierced clit that you’ll find your precious saviour flayed alive and pickled on your doorstep,
it was nice to let that all fall away as he childishly tried to annoy Harry.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You know you can always reach me when everything else becomes too much, right?” Neville squeezed Draco for a moment, hoping that somehow this time his words would stay in Draco’s memory. Usually, Neville had to come find him on his own when shit got bad. Draco never really believed he deserved the help when his mental state went downhill. “Even when you can’t get out of bed. I’m always here.”
“Eh, hi, I’m Harry.” Now that Harry was suddenly up close, Draco was too shocked to do anything but stare into his gorgeous green eyes. Despite Pansy’s warning, he couldn’t be sure he wasn’t drooling. At least Harry blushed as well, though with his dark complexion he was less obvious about it. “I normally don’t do this, but my co-workers egged me on, and I was near the end of my shift anyway, so, eh, hi. I’m Harry, and I already said that, sorry. How are you?
“Draco!” Harry repeated, dumping his entire weight on his lap before he wrapped Draco up in a bone crushing hug, anchoring him down until he came to a standstill. Slowly Draco became aware of his rapid breathing against Harry’s chest, the smell of his quidditch sweater drowning out the hospital stench. Strong hands rubbed at his back, massaging out the tension to the best of their abilities.
I think I made my tapestry sound more bleak than it is really. It’s definitely dark at the beginning. My years before Hogwarts were miserable, losing my parents is something I can’t really remember, of course, but living with my aunt and uncle wasn’t a happy time. Being beat up by my cousin happened regularly, my aunt and uncle couldn’t have cared less and usually blamed me for it all. It was lucky that I could outrun Dudley if I had the chance, he couldn’t catch me on foot and neither could his friends. My time at Hogwarts is certainly the brightest part of my tapestry - almost every day spent there was enjoyable. Fifth year was a bit duller, I suppose, but still not as dark as the times spent in my aunt and uncle’s house. Sixth and seventh year were darker still, but there were bright spots in there - put there by my friends. I know that whenever I spend time with them, they’re adding more bright threads, so no worries there. I am going to fire call them as soon as I’ve finished writing this letter to ask them over for dinner - and I’ll mention redecorating the house too.
“And sometimes that’s the hardest thing of all.” Harry sat closer to him and put an arm around his shoulder. “I have no idea what you must have gone through, Draco. But just know that I admire you for it. This isn’t something to be ashamed about. It just makes me love you more.”
“Maybe a little,” Draco replied, which coaxed a laugh out of Harry. “But at least we’re both equally messed up. That helps.”
Scorpius frowned. “Is Mrs Weasley angry with me?”
If only that Spark would come back, then maybe he could keep fighting.
“Do you?”
Scorpius’s eyes sparked with joy at the prospect. “Yes please! Can Daddy and Harry come too?”
“I’m sure it’s not that bad, Draco. And if it is, then that’s the drama caused by them, caused by friction already in the family, and that is out of your control. You stood your ground on a very important topic and you should be proud of yourself, not doubt yourself.” His mother squeezed him once before letting go. “Besides, I doubt Harry will agree if you tell him you think you’re not a part of his family. In fact, I might just tell him to see how he responds.”
an update that's actually on Sunday evening like i said it would be! thanks to Saphira for reminding me<3
As for being offended by your last letter, please. I don’t think you’ve ever offended me (aside from once or twice) and even if you have, I’m not easily put off.
I thought it was ridiculous and patronising at first, but it really is not. It is just love. A warm body next to you, keeping you save and greeting you with a smile in the morning can make a world of difference. But again, this is all very personal and you will only find a solution with trial and error. I hope you do try to find that solution though. A good dream can do wonders for your mental health and usually calms the mind during the day.
“Of course,” Draco chuckled, because if he cried then he didn’t think he’d ever be able to stop. No matter how determinedly he said ‘of course’, in the end he still didn’t know anything. They still anxiously had to wait for another three hours before a nurse came to tell them that Scorpius was out of theatre and would be joining them shortly. Draco’s heart jumped up when he heard that, but it settled down into a pit of fear again when the hospital staff rolled the empty bed out of the room and replaced it with the one Scorpius was in.
“If you say so.” Draco struggled not to listen to the never-silent voice in the back of his head, telling him that he didn’t deserve anything at all, least of all nice. Andy wouldn’t accept it, and after years of therapy he knew the voice was lying anyway. It was very difficult not to listen to it though.
. “I love you, Harry.”
“Come here, Draco.” Harry beckoned and pulled him back down under the covers again. “You’re thinking too much again.”
“Oh, so it’s back to Potter now, is it?”
Watching Potter go about his business that day had made him feel nostalgic to the bone about his past life. About easier,
“Hungry hungry hippo isn’t stupid, it’s brilliant.” Draco countered, mostly for the sake of lightning the air a bit. He gave Harry one last squeeze before he felt that the man was ready to let go. “Now, a book. I do happen to have some of those.”
“Finally got Scorpius and Al down?” Harry chuckled when Draco didn’t even deem that question worthy of a reply. As if he would be headed for bed if their sons were still running rampant through the house. They loved sharing a room together, but it took a million years to get them to fall asleep now. “I figured you’d have the hardest job tonight.”
Draco felt his face turn a deep red. He preferred not to think about his little tantrum. In his  head he was all grown up, aged by war, society, trauma, the death of his father. The entitled tantrum-throwing child he had once been was long dead and buried.
It’s always been an odd thought for me to be friends with a Slytherin, but… maybe I should have paid more attention to the Sorting Hat when it was trying to promote house unity. If we’d all made more effort at school maybe things would have turned out a bit differently. I can assure you that I won’t be asking for another therapist. I don’t think I’d feel comfortable talking to someone else like this.
“Like Draco would ever admit that.”
“No.” Harry sat up and shook his head. He didn’t meet Draco’s eye anymore now, and his voice was suddenly quite a lot softer. “I know it’s still common practice in the magical community to cuff a kid’s ear and stuff like that, but I just won’t do that. It was hardly physical abuse, but my aunt and uncle weren’t exactly gentle with me as a kid and I never
about it, saying he would wait until Draco did have time, if Draco was comfortable with that.
okay so this chapter is not super long but it was sort of already written and I'd totally forgotten about that so I figured I would post it today anyway to make up for the short chapter before this. I hope you enjoy!
As for what you said about not feeling like you can talk to your friends, I find myself very understanding of that feeling. I have been there. Your friends move on, start new things, and when you feel stuck in the past they are growing out of, it may seem like they are leaving you alone, like they are moving on, not just from their old pain, but from
. I have no idea what I’m doing, or what I am supposed to do for that matter.”
Draco didn’t reply. There was no way he could force the words past his lips. He felt so bloody
him. But with friends like Draco and Harry, it was hard to forget. “I mean it, you know? This never would have happened without you.”
I very much doubt I know more about you than you do yourself, though. We sometimes need the insight of an outsider to see certain things, the way we are talking with each other now, but in the end,
, though he wasn’t really sure what that something was. His head was spinning, thoughts buzzing, even though he had zero sensory input. For all he knew he no longer had a head. It was confusing, but above all else, it was frustrating because he knew there was
“Yeah. You’re too bloody nice.” Draco sniffed as he moved to curl himself up at his side. Neville was briefly worried what Harry would think of all this, until he remembered that he and Draco had been friends for over ten years. They had shared beds on many nights, yet Neville couldn’t think of a single friendship he had that was more platonic than this one. It would be like Draco being jealous of Ron.
