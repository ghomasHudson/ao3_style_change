“Yeah, I dropped him off after his appointment. Ernestina is with him.” Harry comes nearer. “I… er. Came by to see if you needed me. The agenda for the afternoon wasn’t clear on that, I thought maybe you wanted me to be with you on your way home.” Another rattling sound, softer this time.
“Why?” he asked, relishing the Niffler’s anguished look immensely. That should teach the sneaky little beast to spy on his, er,
“If you’re mine, oh Merlin, if you’re mine I’ll make you feel so good, Harry. I’ll show you — I’ll show you
“Okay,” Harry says, rubbing the back of his neck. Whatever he was expecting to find in the kitchen this morning, it sure wasn’t a free house-elf, paid by Draco Malfoy to take care of his son and make a huge breakfast for three because, apparently, she’s also part of Malfoy’s family. So he points at the pan of eggs instead. “Can I use some of these for a sandwich?”
“You’re even more skillful than your CV led me to believe.” There’s a glint in Draco’s eyes, and his mouth twists into a playful half-smile.
“Origami is an undervalued Muggle art,” Draco smiled back. He snapped his fingers and the Quick-Quotes Quill sprang to life next to him. It hovered half an inch over a floating sheet of parchment, quivering with anticipation. “Ready when you are,” he told Luna.
Malfoy let out a soft snort of laughter. “You’re right.” His eyes flicked to Harry’s, almost shy. “I was just being… sentimental.”
He was here last night, so odds are he still is. When we returned from Paris last summer, Daddy said Harry would go back to his own house for a while.
She throws her hands up. “ I’m telling you, girls. And Draco. I don’t know where all the good people have gone, but they’re not in London anymore, I can assure you.”
“Er, yes. Thank you.” Harry takes off his coat and hands it to her. She practically disappears behind the bulky cashmere as she’s holding it against her chest.
Malfoy moves to face Harry fully. He’s tall and lean — nothing new here, he already was tall and lean back at Hogwarts, Harry thinks — but Harry now notices the shape of broad shoulders and toned arms under Malfoy’s white shirt. His blond hair catches the low candlelight; it’s longer where it falls in his eyes, shorter on the sides. Malfoy’s eyes gleam with something that’s part curiosity and part smirking malice, and something in Harry thrills.
“Shhh!!” Draco pushed the Niffler off his boot, looking left and right. “I’m not supposed to know you!”
Draco pressed the swollen head of his cock against Harry’s entrance. It was still tight. He wanted to wait, but Harry rocked back, fitting Draco inside him an inch further.
“Piss off, Malfoy, you wanted me all along,” Harry said with a crooked smile. Draco rolled his eyes and took his hand.
“Don’t listen to her, mate,” Ron tells Draco. He’s got a mouthful of green beans and doesn’t seem to notice Narcissa’s slight scowl. “Anything to get you to say yes. She’s talked my ears off about this project.”
Without a word, Harry sits across from Malfoy, choosing the grey silk chair. Malfoy follows his movements with a slight lift of his eyebrow. Then he pulls a piece of parchment from a pile on his desk and examines it.
“Here you go,” he hands her a steaming mug of tea, sitting across from her at the big table. They look at each other for a moment, the easy, familiar gaze of long-time friends who know one another inside and out. In Hermione’s arms, baby Hugo waves his little hands in front of his face like he’s just discovered them. Then again, maybe he has.
Only, when Potter is done, his eyes are drawn back to Draco, wide and intense. It’s unsettling. Potter hasn’t looked at him like that in
Draco’s eyes are shining in the darkness. “I can’t do this anymore, Harry,” he says, defeated. “It’s over.”
“Really? I don’t think there’s been one day when you haven’t complained about them and threatened to hex their bollocks to their nostrils.”
And maybe Draco’s right, and that’s exactly what Harry is. But he undresses Draco still, his hands slow, deliberate, reverent, until Draco is shivering, naked across the sheets. And maybe Draco won’t allow him to say it with words, but Harry will make love to him all the same. Trailing kisses down his neck, down his chest, his hot breath lingering over each of Draco’s scars. Feeling Draco’s body arch into him in a wordless
But for reasons that he doesn’t care to examine too closely, Harry feels compelled to take this one.
“Here we are. Though if someone had told me I’d end up with a bespectacled prat with a disaster of an hairstyle for a boyfriend, I might have reconsidered.”
Luna took his scarf and cloak. “Thank you, Draco. It was a nice room. That’s very kind of you to say.”
Draco stared at Harry with his mouth open. For all their talk about personality tests, he had not seen this coming.
“No, Mistor Potter,” Ernestina shakes her head with a half smile. “We met in Paris. Ernestina was working for another wizarding family but they were moving to Japan. And Ernestina was recommended to Mistress Narcissa who offered to hire her.”
“Why, Draco dear. Haven’t you guessed? It’s easy as pie.” Mephistopheles grinned like the old shriveled demon he was. “They want you to
Harry latched his lips to the side of Malfoy’s neck and pushed Malfoy’s trousers and pants down in a gesture that left no room for interpretation. He felt Malfoy wiggle his clothes as far down his legs as he could, and then Harry’s cock slipped between his bare thighs.
“Fine,” Draco sighs, tucking his hair behind his ear. Potter’s eyes follow the movement of his hand, and Draco’s heart — the treacherous thing — jumps in his chest. “Let me—” He lifts a finger and walks to the filing cabinet near his desk, ducking to avoid a form flying from Parvati’s side of the room to join the piles of parchment on Lavender’s desk. He scans the cabinet. Receipt forms, receipt forms… ah yes, in the bottom drawer. He bends, opens it, and grabs a blank form.
Harry’s head snaps up. So does Malfoy’s. Two deer frozen in headlights, only one is on his knees and the other still has his spent, softening cock out.
He pointed his wand at the book and waved it in a slow, complex motion, holding still and visualising the thought he hadn’t quite dared forming until now: ‘This is what I’d like to be...’. The questionnaire on the page started filling itself, ticking the boxes that matched what Draco’s answers would have been. At the bottom of the page, a score of 98 percent appeared in dark green ink.  Draco lifted it up to admire his wand-work. He wasn’t surprised by the test’s result, even though it was comforting to have his intuition validated. Harry had moved close behind him, looking at the result over Draco’s shoulder.
Draco exhales a soft laugh. “I would not have lived as long as I have without your help, that’s for sure.”
“Thank you, Harry,” Hermione watches him with her deep brown eyes. Then gives him a small half-smile, almost lewd. “That way, I can check that he looks as fit in person as he does on the cover of the
He shakes his head, chasing the thoughts away, and reaches for his joggers and his favourite Nike trainers. He’ll need to talk to Harry eventually, soon. Without breaking down.
He strides over and grabs Malfoy’s wrist. The grip is forceful — more so than Harry intended — and Malfoy opens his hand with a grunt. Whatever he was holding clatters against the metallic foot of the rack and rolls away on the carpet. Harry catches gold and silver from the corner of his eye. Galleons. Sickles. A glinting pocket watch — platinum?
with something else, but I doubt the other party would be willing,” Harry blurted, then froze. Had he really just said this? Fighting the heat rapidly spreading from the back of his neck to his face, he kept his eyes in front of him. Maybe Malfoy didn’t hear—
kind of money. The Malfoy vaults were entirely confiscated after their trials, along with the rest of their properties. Even the Manor was taken once Narcissa and Draco Malfoy finished their three-year house arrest. There was only a small vault left that guaranteed just enough income for Narcissa and her son to live for a few years until they both put their lives back together. Draco Malfoy should have had nothing to start a business with, let alone three million Galleons.”
“If you want to join us,” Malfoy speaks, at length, “tea’s ready. And…” He hesitates, just a fraction of a second. Harry sees the moment he changes his mind in his eyes. “...you’re welcome to it.”
Sorry I asked you to help. You seemed like the best person for it, though. I’ve seen Ron’s handwriting. I don’t trust him with a pencil around my eyes. And you looked like you could handle some more… delicate… er… tasks.
In the middle of the garden, his silhouette cutting a familiar shape against the immaculate backdrop, Harry stood with his back to Draco, his face turned up towards the stars.
Harry throws the parchment on the desk and closes the gap between them, pulling Draco in for a fierce kiss. Draco grins into it, his eyes closed, humming with pleasure. They part, forehead to forehead, eyes sparkling with joy.
“Fuck, I’ve wanted you for hours,” he moaned as he attacked Draco’s mouth with hungry, desperate kisses.
Harry’s eyes go from the fallen coins to Malfoy’s face. Harry’s hands are fisted at the collar of Malfoy’s elegant shirt. Malfoy’s pale grey eyes hold the ominous calm of a sky before a storm. “What are you?” Harry demands. “A
Malfoy pulled away with a gentleness that set something loose in Harry’s chest. His glasses were fogged up and slightly askew.
“To put a stop to this travesty of an investigation,” Harry says. Draco snorts, a bitter sound. “I’m serious,” Harry presses on. “What is this parchment for?”
Blaise waves his arms like a conductor. Next to Harry, sitting on Hermione’s blanket, Draco holds his sides and collapses from laughter. They’re all pleasantly tipsy, laughing and smiling and finishing the little conversations they started over dinner, and Balzac goes from one friend to the other, begging for pats on the head and belly rubs.
The flip side of these memories assails Harry with equal force and frequency: he can’t forget the whiplash of Malfoy’s Disapparation. He remembers standing dumbly in a cloakroom aisle in the aftermath, his softening dick still out, scrambling to pull his pants and trousers back on before Ron could find him.
“I could have been a professional Quidditch player, under different circumstances. A better one than you.”
I was just — I haven’t seen one in a long time. It’s always a bit of a shocker, you know? The Mark.” He smiles, a small, wry thing. “You’re right. It’s your office. And even if it wasn’t… it’s not my place to judge you. I’m sorry I… reacted.”
He deserves someone who’ll stand by him, stand up for him, and not just do the reluctant, half-arsed job Harry’s been doing since January.
Draco walked and walked. The snow thinned; the vegetation thickened. He wasn’t mindful of the noise anymore. There was nothing in the Forest for him to fear.
She’s the one waiting at the door, indeed, and she does look him up and down when he opens the door. Her pinched, judgmental expression only softens when she sees Harry’s sheepish air, bottom lip caught between his teeth. Next to her, the tiny pushchair she and Ron bought when Rose was born shakes with one sharp little cry, and a miniscule hand appears from between the swaddles.
“Look, mate, did something happen? Is there something you want to tell me?” he’d asked, but Harry had shaken his head with a hasty smile.
They stared at each other for a moment that seemed to stretch and stretch, Luna’s expression of placid earnestness unchanging. Eventually, Draco lifted his eyebrows, perplexed.
She laughed. “Maybe. An unrepentant Draco Malfoy would never have lowered himself to including Muggle parametres in his calculations, would he?”
“Fuck,” Draco hisses into his arm. Harry’s panting behind him. Draco’s still bent over the desk, arse in the air. He feels the hot trickle of Harry’s come on his balls, the inside of his thigh, and wonders what a debauched spectacle he must make for Harry. His cock twitches again at the thought. He moves just a few inches back and away from the desk, enough room to wrap his fist around his own straining cock. He gives it a meaningful jerk, turns to look at Harry over his shoulder. “I’m not
And the piano keys explode in a blast of air, like a hundred bullets, all over the room, breaking shelves, shattering the glass of the windows, getting one of the Aurors — the one holding Ernestina — in the shoulder, blood splashing Harry and Scorpius’ faces and clothes.
“Merlin, Draco, you need to get more serious about your health!” she’d chided, staring pointedly at the dark circles under Draco’s eyes. “And you too, Harry,” she’d added, possibly because Harry’s state wasn’t much better. “I know you two are—” she made a vague gesture between Harry and Draco, lifting her eyebrows “—
Meander down the corridor, push the door open. Daddy’s study. Bright. Warm. Thick rugs everywhere. Embers in the fireplace, glowing from last night. The dragon and unicorn chair, repaired. The sofa, new cushions, comfy throw pillows. Daddy and I put all the records back on the shelves in September, before school started (Daddy said he had a
“Yes, but Ernestina is not most house-elves, Mistor Potter. Ernestina is a free elf, sir,” she announces, straightening her back. Harry’s heart sinks. The words have a painful echo to them.
Harry’s heart squeezes in his chest, but he smiles and winks in response. “I doubt that Draco can hurt me. He might be a clever bastard, but I’m still stronger than him.”
I didn’t expect to encounter a familiar face, let alone find that familiar face on stage. At least, I
“It’s time for me to retire. I don’t want to sound ungrateful… I know I wouldn’t even have anywhere to retire to if it wasn’t for you. There’s no way I could have found a job after the war. And I don’t have the brains to do what
“Glad you approve,” Draco murmurs back, and they’re kissing again. It’s a blur, really. Harry is everywhere. Hands in Draco’s hair, fingers pulling lightly; tongue in Draco’s mouth, hot and unbearably soft; taut body crowding Draco’s against the door, erection sliding against Draco’s own, and it’s good, so good,
It’s a simple acknowledgment. For a moment, silence surrounds them, only disturbed by the crackle of the fire and the birds chirping in the garden outside. The atmosphere shifts to something different, and Harry struggles to maintain eye contact with Malfoy.
“Told you,” Draco smiled back, and then they stood smiling at each other for what felt to Draco like a embarrassingly long time.
Malfoy wore glasses now. They were simple understated spectacles with a thin silver frame. Harry’s first reaction was to go weak in the knees. God, what was wrong with him? See one fit blond bloke in glasses and nearly come in his pants? It wasn’t like he didn’t have his pick of partners. Hell, he’d had sex three days ago. It wasn’t like he was desperate for it.
“Erm,” Harry says, brushing his palms down his Auror uniform. Draco rounds on him, gaping. He’s about to say something biting and snarky, Harry’s sure, but Penelope Clearwater smirks, putting her arm over his shoulder.
“I can see you really want it,” he mused. “Shall I ask Mephisto about giving it to you? Wonder how he’d like to hear his
“Or…” Harry continues and takes a step closer, “you’ve spent too much time in here already, and you’re worried she’ll make fun of you. Which she will, when you admit you could have asked her right away instead of wasting half an hour looking for a quill.”
Harry and Malfoy stare at each other in the muffled quiet of the study. The grandfather clock mirrors the beat of Harry’s heart in his ears. There’s a pop in the fireplace. Birds chirp in the garden.
How could anyone in their right mind enjoy returning to the scene of one’s most shameful, most humiliating moments? How could anyone actively want to reminisce the time when one was, to put it mildly, an entitled, bigoted brat?
Harry fusses with the kettle and mugs while Hermione takes a seat at the table, pulls Hugo out of his pushchair and just folds the thing in two clicks and a pull of her hand. Harry whistles.
“Oh, Draco. Darling. If something really happened with Potter... you must be over the moon. You’ve wished for it for long enough.”
Harry surveyed him from a safe distance of a few feet. A gust of wind swayed their brooms, sending a swathe of hair flying into Harry’s eyes. He lifted a hand to tuck it behind his ear.
“That’s what they want you to think, Draco,” she answered with a sweet, candid smile. “Mainstream media, that is. It’s not your fault. You work for them, after all.”
He touched the tip of his index to one of the small, round, white contraptions that Harry had worn in his ears when Draco had entered the common room. Harry seemed to jolt out of a trance. Regretfully, Draco watched his hand retreat into his lap.
When they’re gone, Harry stares at the door for a long time, adjusting to the feeling of the big, silent house around him. Balzac has gone up to Scorpius’ room for the night, and there’s nothing to disturb the hush. He goes to the study, takes one last breath of the cool, night air, heavy with the smell of wet grass. He closes the French doors, lifts the needle from the record idling on the player, puts the record in its sleeve. Then he braces himself, and climbs the stairs to the second floor.
Harry stares at her, at a loss for words. He continues to stare long after the front door has opened and closed behind his friend.
Draco shook his head. Twisting his wrist, holding Harry’s chin more firmly, he forced Harry to make eye contact with him.
Draco snorted. “About you? What is there to ask? Everyone in Britain and beyond knows every single thing you do, Potter.”
The thought of it hits him as he’s arranging his things into the wardrobe and chest of drawers. The two attic rooms are going to be his home for the duration of his employment — or, more truthfully, the duration of his
Not only would he have to work with Harry on this assignment, but he’d have to convincingly lie about a future he didn’t have. He’d have to convincingly lie about a future he didn’t have to
“Nobody’s having fun anymore,” Hannah Abbott chimes in, running her fingers through her short hair. “Like, Matilda and I went out for drinks last Friday, see?” She gestures at Matilda Vance, sitting across the room, and Matilda nods so vehemently her thick-rimmed glasses almost slide off her small nose. “You’d think someone — anyone! — would have come and chatted us up! Flirted a little! Bought us a drink! We’re fun, smart, attractive ladies! We deserve some good old fashioned Friday night game! But
Draco can’t blame him, even if he knows it’s far from the only one. Ernestina’s cooking is bloody phenomenal.
Harry’s head snapped up. Malfoy’s eyes were fixed on him, intent and hungry. He licked his lips, exposing a row of glinting white teeth, and Harry’s brain short-circuited.
“Very well, Mr Potter. I shall,” she tells him with a sharp smile that doesn’t bode well for Harry. “In fact, I’m looking forward to it.”
Andromeda’s flat was small but warm and cosy. A few years back, Draco would have sneered in disdain. But the place reminded him of the Eighth Year common room—all thick rugs and mismatched furniture and crackling fire in the hearth—and he couldn’t bring himself to feel the slightest hint of condescendence.
He gave his head a shake. “I wasn’t brave enough to even pick a side and stick to it. People died because of me. I never meant for that to happen. I never thought...”
.” Draco closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose. “What animal have you brought into our home? It had better not be a snake.” Draco hated snakes. All Nagini's fault, he supposed. He shuddered at the very thought.
Harry had kissed him again and again last night, pressing Draco against the wall and his body against his. It was all Draco could do not to let go and rut against the thigh Harry had pressed between his legs, unnoticed at first in the scramble of lips and hands and hot breaths. It was the best thing Draco had experienced in a hundred lives—the burning desire for another human, enthusiastically reciprocated; Harry everywhere, his hands roaming Draco’s body, his lips kissing his mouth, his jaw, his neck, exhaling hot little breaths into his ear. Draco wanted to live in this moment, and he wanted so much more, things he didn’t know about, things he couldn’t name.
Instead, he forced his own desire down and closed his right fist around the base of Harry’s cock. He’d touched Harry already. Yet this was something filthier, sexier,
Draco wants to melt into him. He opens his legs to let Harry slip a thigh between them. He pushes his hips forward, his cock hard and rubbing against Harry's leg, hoping Harry's as eager as he is—
At that, Ginny’s face went pink, although she looked proud, not embarrassed. “Oi, that’s too much information!” Ron protested. The others laughed and Finnigan elbowed him in the ribs.
With a resolute shake of his head, Draco pushes his wet hair away from his face, his mouth twisting in a self-loathing sneer. Certainly, if word of their relationship got out, Draco’s fate would be far worse than Harry’s — there would be no helping him in the investigation the Ministry would launch this time. But Harry… Harry had given too much. He’d suffered enough. Draco wouldn’t allow it to happen again. How presumptuous of him, really, to have assumed Draco Malfoy deserved a happy ending. His selfishness has caused enough damage. He can’t keep imposing it on Harry. There’s only one way to put a stop to it, and Draco knows what it is.
Harry let out a sharp exhale. It must have burned, but he didn’t ask Draco to stop. His hands clenched into fists on the countertop, the most heavenly moan escaping his mouth, and Draco, with rhythmic, shallow thrusts, finally pushed all the way in.
things, you’re awfully thick sometimes.” He nudges his nose against Draco’s. “Of course, you berk. A date.”
“How did you know where to find me?” Harry asks. He smiles, and Draco smiles back at him. They seem unable to look away from each other.
“Fine.” Draco places a hand on his desk — his rings clink on the polished dark wood — and stands. “I will show you a trick.” He unties his silk scarf and folds it, puts it on the corner of his desk. “But only because your pathetic sex lives are spoiling the atmosphere of this office,” he walks around his desk and to the middle of the room, “and I can’t be the only person taking one for the team every weekend.”
“Hands on the wall, Potter,” he’d growled, draping himself against Harry’s back like an animal in heat, and Harry had done as instructed, thrilling at the sensation of Draco against him. Draco’s fingers had fumbled with his flies before he’d reached round him and brought him off like that, and Harry had come all over the wall with a muffled cry and stars bursting behind his eyelids.
“No time,” he whined, clutching Harry’s shoulders for fear his knees might give away. “No time. Next time. Just—touch me, Harry. Make me come.
Harry laughed, and it seemed to mellow Granger out a bit. Glancing at Harry, she said, “It’s not just filling out the form. Sending the payment in can be tricky. Waterstones is a Muggle shop, so unless you actually make the trip to the nearest Muggle town—I’d like to see the two of you try—you'll have to find a way to pay that isn’t Galleons and Sickles. A Muggle cheque, or a bank transfer. For which you need a Muggle bank account.” She crossed her arms on the table and surveyed Draco and Harry expectantly. “Remind me again, at which Muggle bank do you have accounts open?”
Draco steps inside. He walks around the wrecked coffee table, the sofa with its cushions ripped open. Slow, deliberate paces. Like he’s taking it all in for the first time. He reaches out, lets his fingers linger along the ridge of the back on the sofa, the sound a soft, hissing slide. Then he sags to the ground, his back to the side of the sofa, his long legs stretched out in front of him.
Harry thinks with an odd twist in his gut when he sees the inviting queen-sized bed sitting in the middle of the room, flanked by two bedside tables and a round Muggle lamp that looks vintage. Across the room, there’s a beautiful carved pine wardrobe and a chest of drawers topped with a vase containing—
It’s cold and drizzling when Harry and Draco reach the gates of Hyde Park. They’ve jogged through the Sloane Square streets at a mild pace, so neither of them is particularly affected by the run yet. Except Draco’s cheeks and ears are pinker now, after the effort.
He lifts one hand from his lap to fiddle with the handle of his mug of tea without looking at Harry. Harry isn’t sure what to say next, or even if he should say anything. Draco looks almost lost in thought, a swathe of blond hair falling across his eyes, obscuring his face. Eventually, Harry leans forward, touching Malfoy’s shoulder with the tips of his fingers.
“For both our sakes!” Draco seethes. “We’ve the plans of the entire Ministry to thwart, and we’re nowhere near done! Now is not the time for sentimentality, do you not see that?”
“We’re really doing this,” he said, somewhere between a statement and a question. “The world must really have come to an end.”
Passing their table, other Eighth Years shot inquisitive glances at them. It was common knowledge that Harry and Draco had left their old enmity behind when the school year had started, but it was another thing to see them sitting together in class. In the distance, Slughorn announced the lesson plan of the day.
When Slughorn finally dismissed the class, Draco had no choice but to pull Harry into a dark corner nearby, press him against the wall and kiss him. Harry tasted of hot chocolate, candied orange and Christmas, and his eyelashes tickled Draco’s cheek when he smiled against his lips.
After months near Harry, though… Draco’s starting to wonder how long he can keep up with his side of the game.
Draco looked up from his scroll of parchment. There he was again, standing near Draco and Harry’s table in the corner of the Eighth Year common room: the same small boy that McGonagall had sent to fetch him and Harry from the Library that first time. It had been the beginning of December, back then. It felt like a lifetime ago.
Harry shakes his head and pats Ron’s arm. “Hey, at ease, Senior Auror Weasley,” he says. “I’m a big boy. I can keep myself safe. And you—” he gestures between Ron and Hermione, “—are here to have a good time.”
And the strange feeling has followed Harry everywhere since then, like the chaffing of a rough label on an otherwise comfortable t-shirt.
“Well,” Draco sighed, “I suppose you’ve named her now, haven’t you? It'll be nigh on impossible to change your mind. Your stubbornness is only matched by your utter recklessness. It’s a good thing you’re so pleasing on the eye, Mr Harry James Potter.” Harry grinned up at him and winked. “Why did you name her Tamara by the way?”
“All right, then tell me why you left Paris. And be honest,” he adds, hoping to sound casual and playful.
“I like every bloody version of you,” Harry growls, wrapping his arms around his waist and bringing him flush against him. “You damned fool,” he adds, a whisper in Draco’s ear.
a sleeping dragon,” Draco said drily, “but yes, I suppose the sentiment is the same.” He gave Harry's hand a squeeze back.
“It’s nothing… It’s just a magical sprain,” Harry says weakly. “With the bandage and potions they gave me, it’s only going to be a matter of days.”
“I know,” Harry teases, following Malfoy down the last flight of stairs. “I’m a terrible employee. Insubordination, insolence, tardiness… you should see my recommendations.”
They stay like this… how long, Harry doesn’t know. Under him, Malfoy moans softly again, arse twitching, but this time it’s closer to discomfort. Harry’s oversensitive now, and— oh god, so must be Malfoy. With all the care he’s capable of in his breathless state, Harry pulls out. He grabs a few tissues from the box on his nightstand and cleans himself, handing a few more to Malfoy.
“Is it a fucking competition? All the choices I’ve made in my life… I turned them on their head for you.”
He quietly steps out of the box while the last act of the ballet plays out. Malfoy had been right: the spectators are too entranced to pay Harry any mind. He finds himself alone in the silent corridors of the opera house. The nightly stillness sends a shiver down his spine. The place is warm, low-ceilinged and padded, Tchaikovsky’s epic chords echoing from the closed doors leading to the orchestra. The sense-memory brings Harry back to Hogwarts. He recalls the corridors past curfew, the thrill of sneaking around unnoticed. The corner of Harry’s mouth lifts in a wry little smile when he remembers he was after Malfoy half the times, even back then.
Before sleep takes him, the thought crosses Harry’s mind that it doesn’t matter what he’s allowed to tell Draco. He’ll keep proving it to him. Actions have always spoken louder than words.
“Am I, though?” Malfoy licks his lips and pushes off Harry. He straightens his clothes and winks. “‘Til the next time, Potter.”
“I think I do quite all right on my own, Potter,” he says. Harry’s name in Malfoy’s posh accent sounds like it’s always done, the short, contemptuous ‘Pottah’ that signals Malfoy’s status as much as his dislike of Harry. Harry’s longing for an anonymous walk through London by night morphs into melancholy for the old times, his early Hogwarts years where he hated Malfoy, Malfoy hated him, and everything was simple and magic and wonderful.
He wasn't sorry. When he ventured a glance at Harry, he could see Harry looked anything but heartbroken.
“I— I wasn’t lying,” Harry says, eyes locked on Malfoy’s. He can hear the chatter of guests getting louder down the corridor, and he doesn’t want to draw attention. Especially not here, now, having his conversation with Draco Malfoy, of all people. He doesn’t even know if Malfoy was rightfully invited here, or if he’s just sneaking around on one of his stealing missions. He keeps his voice low. “It’s all so new to me. I’m not… ready.”
“Right now we’re considering several leads,” Ron chimes in, and Harry struggles to keep his expression neutral despite his growing wariness. “Old Death Eater ties, obviously. Dark artefacts contraband. Illegal potions and drugs. Money laundering, possibly.”
Ron is leaning over a vase of grey hydrangeas, sniffing with a suspicious air. Ernestina watches him with a nonplussed frown, and Harry swiftly catches his friend by the elbow and leads him to the study, nodding at Hermione to follow them.
Draco’s stomach dropped. Jeff had stopped running to bat his little paws at the birds. Charybd and Scylla took flight only to dive and peck him with their sharp beaks again. Protecting his head, the poor animal was half howling in pain, half cursing Mephistopheles’s ravens to the ends of Hell.
“If the formula still doesn’t give realistic results, I thought a combination of Predictive and Algebra spells could help. My understanding is that all these tests have a Muggle base to them. It would be brilliant if we had access to more, but the Library has wizarding books only. Then we could just help the personality tests along with magic.”
Draco wanted to ask what Jeff was seeing in him that was so grim, but before he had time to open his mouth, the Niffler had Disapparated, leaving behind only a puff of purple, sulfur-scented smoke.
Potter marches to Draco’s desk while Draco makes room for the box. He doesn’t have to look up to know that his colleagues are watching the scene like thirsty hawks. Ever since their last collective encounter with Potter, when that green-eyed spoilsport had walked in on the entire DLF striking sexy poses for fun, Draco has not had a minute of peace. ‘
Draco watches him, Harry’s words having seemingly stunned him into momentary silence. Then he makes to leave. “Maybe this has gone too far.”
His chest swells with almost unbearable affection. There’s also guilt in there, hidden in the shadows. He ignores it.
“Thank you, Head Auror,” Malfoy bowed his head slightly, the very picture of respectful deference, if not for the tiniest hint of a smirk playing at the corner of his mouth. Harry grabbed his arm and all but threw him out of Head Auror Smith’s office. Malfoy’s delighted chuckle was more damning evidence of their illicit off-piste antics than Harry’s burgeoning erection was.
“Oh,” Draco said, exhaling through his mouth. He kissed Harry’s forehead, his lips pressed to the now-familiar ridges of his scar. “Okay. I’m—I’m glad I’m here, too.”
Aquaera, another potion that helps the systems of premature babies to adapt faster to life outside the womb.
Malfoy goes still then, Harry’s cock deep in his mouth, his breath strained and skirting Harry’s skin. He gives Harry’s hand a careful squeeze, and Harry sees all his want mirrored in the small gesture — the need for connection, the proof that Malfoy is as human as he is. And then Malfoy sucks him deeper on an exhale, and all of Harry’s thoughts fade to blissful white.
Not a group outing with a bunch of ex-Gryffindors, most of whom seemed to only tolerate Draco thanks to his recent friendship with Harry.
“Why do you assume I did something? They’re at the premiere of one of the most beautiful ballets ever played. They’ve got better things to do than pay attention to you. Believe it or not, you’re not that interesting.”
“Okay?” he asked, his breath shallow and hot against Harry’s skin. His face was pink and shiny with perspiration and there was a swathe of blond hair falling in his eye. Harry had never seen him look so debauched.
“I have, unfortunately,” Draco conceded. He listened to the song until the final notes of the guitar faded out.
“Gentlemen, I apologise for keeping you overtime when you’re obviously in need of a rest. I’d like to give you the next three days off as a thank you—and as an opportunity for you to catch up on much needed sleep.”
“You’d forgotten about it until my mother caught you walking around looking thoroughly debauched this morning.”
for God’s sake.” After Draco’s stared at him for a long moment, blinking and stunned, Harry rolls his eyes and marches up to him. “I don’t care about your mistakes. I don’t care about your fucking Mark, Malfoy,” Harry says, and he engulfs Draco in a hug.
“I was what?” Harry asks softly. “Gay? Queer? I haven’t put a name on it yet. As I said, I only realised recently, due to a certain chain of events. Due to a certain someone.”
When Scorpius sleeps, Draco goes on runs, hoping to outrun the nauseated dread. He runs for miles, alone, sweat prickling between his shoulder blades. He runs until his breath becomes a stabbing pain in his lungs; he runs until his thighs and calves burn and he has to walk home on shaking legs. He runs, Harry’s words hammering in his brain.
He muttered a wandless lubricating spell and slid his dripping fingers back along Malfoy’s crease, feeling him squirm and moan at the touch. He gave his own cock a pump, two pumps, slicking it nice and wet for Malfoy’s arse. One hand still on Malfoy’s hip, he lined himself up and gave a push.
He still doesn’t know what it means that he wants Malfoy that way. He’s never thought about his needs and wants and the teenage fantasies he’d kept at bay with a steady routine of blank-minded wanking. He’s never thought of himself as — Merlin forbid —
When he walked into the office, Harry was already sitting in one of the chairs across the Headmistress, a cup of Lapsang Souchong placed in front of him on the desk. He took the teacup’s handle between index and thumb. His blunt fingers held the small porcelain cup with a delicacy Draco wouldn’t have expected from him. The smoky aroma of the tea drifted to Draco. Mixed with the scent of firewood in the hearth, the presence of Harry, and McGonagall’s kind expression, the scene indicated a casual conversation more than a telling-off.
They were being too loud. Around the table, Greg, Blaise and Theo threw them quizzical looks. Even Harry and his friends glanced at them briefly. The red-haired Weasley girl murmured something in her brother’s ear. Harry’s green eyes lingered on Draco’s for a second longer than the rest of them. Draco’s stomach resumed its acrobatics.
“Then what do you suggest, Draco? That I keep going back to Kingsley, telling him that the only information I have on you is what an outstanding citizen you are and hoping he’ll take my word for it?”
“Draco!” she squealed. Draco put his hand over her mouth again. She shook out of his grip. “I can’t believe it! You have a boyfriend! Oh,” she wrung her hands enthusiastically, “and it’s Potter! You've lusted after him for
It’s true, though. Scorpius establishing the use of given names was the first step towards a more personal relationship than Draco would have initiated.
The sight of Malfoy in the DLF office, his back turned to Harry, striking a sexy pose to entertain his colleagues, struck Harry like a
“I just explained the rough content of the job to you. Is it really the only thing you want to ask me?”
“Yes, Headmistress,” Draco and Harry said in unison. Draco caught Harry’s eye before he turned his head firmly ahead. The corner of Harry’s mouth twitched with a smile.
“Shut up,” Harry laughed, a little embarrassed and pleased with Malfoy’s reaction. “And hurry. It’s the end of the world, alright? Just—take your clothes off, and make it good.”
When Harry moves to the sink to wash his own cutlery, Malfoy steps back. With a flash of hurt, Harry remembers how this whole thing started: with him going out for a jog just because he couldn’t get over Malfoy turning him down at the Royal Ballet House. It doesn’t stop him from grudgingly regretting the lost proximity.
“Mind your own business,” Draco glared, crossing his arms over his Potions book and thumbing his ring. He knew he sounded like a petulant teenager. Then again, that’s what he was. Demons didn’t usually reach maturity until well into their second millenium.
Harry’s spell tickled against his naked skin like a puff of cool air on a hot night. He made sure to hit Malfoy with it, but even after the spell, Malfoy still looked like he’d been shagged six ways to Sunday.
There was a hunger in Harry’s staring that alarmed him. He put his fork back in his plate, food untouched. “I didn’t know that—”
Malfoy clearly likes men, fucks men, and wants that information to be plain to everyone who lays eyes on him.
“Fine.” Harry walks to Draco’s door, puts his hand on the handle. Hesitates. “Can I go in? I need to…”
“Talk to me,” Harry’s voice reaches him. He sounds strained. Wrecked. It’s all Draco’s doing. “Tell me how it feels…”
There was a small boy standing by their table. First or Second Year, Draco thought. Had he ever been this tiny? The boy was red in the face, his eyes flitting between Draco and Pansy as though he couldn’t decide which one of them was more intimidating. He fidgeted, wringing his hands. He obviously had something to say.
“I’m fine, Potter,” Draco pretended to be absorbed in the contemplation of the new cauldrons displayed in the shop window. The skating rink incident still stang. He wished Harry wouldn’t bring it up.
“Thanks,” Harry laughs shakily, and starts pumping his fist. Draco’s head falls against the cushions. He closes his eyes, giving himself over to the sensation, the heat coursing through his body like magic.
Potter stepped closer. Maybe in an attempt to threaten Draco with the size of his biceps, the chiseled lines of which were visible even under his shirt. If so, he’d failed entirely. Far from being intimidated, Draco felt…er…
Ron’s joking, but only as a cover for real concern. Harry can read it in his eyes: Ron’s mentally calculating Harry’s alcohol-to-blood ratio and the possible itineraries Harry might take. The ones that might end up with him tipsily tripping and drowning in the Thames, for instance.
“Back there, when that Cavendish fellow assaulted you. He’s a Muggle, isn’t he? You could have used magic to escape.”
“It’s your job…” Draco repeats. Almost a question. The way he’s gazing at Harry… like something isn’t quite right, like he wants Harry to tell him something, like maybe he knows…
“Jemima?” comes Draco’s voice from behind it. There’s an office supplies storage cupboard, door ajar, previously hidden by a perfect blending charm. He hears Draco rummaging for something inside it, like he’s rattling boxes of quills in there.
fate. Yet I remember how it was when it was your turn to bring us food and water: you sneaked in little pieces of bread, sometimes. They were dry and stale, as though you’d managed to scavenge them from the kitchens where they were supposed to be thrown away. You spoke softly. You didn’t cringe when our hands touched over the plate of food. You even smiled at us. Oh, Draco, I know it was your way of trying to make us feel something—make us feel better, more human, more worthwhile. But...your smile was worse than tears, really. As though you would rather happily trade places with me than go back to them. It made my heart ache for you. I could hear screams upstairs, sometimes, through the ceiling. Thuds, like bodies falling to the ground. I always hoped they weren’t you.”
Malfoy must see the question on Harry’s face. He pushes up to his elbows and knees, and Harry’s brain does that weird thing where it catches up and short-circuits at the same time. Hastily, he sits up, scrambling with the covers. He feels about as graceful and certain as a— well, as a twenty-five-year-old virgin. Harry’s afraid to look, yet he can’t look at anything else. The previous times, he could pretend that it was something that he let happen. This time feels deliberate.
“Well, I’ve tried to talk to him about it! I go to see him three times a week! What do you do when you hang around at his place?”
And also because he was interesting, and challenging, and infuriating, and so bloody fit Harry couldn’t wait to get him naked and begging for his cock. He pointedly pushed his hips into Malfoy’s and relished the strangled moan that came out of Malfoy.
“You’ve changed,” she murmured. “Harry’s right. It wasn’t just the apology you gave me at the beginning of the year, was it?”
“You are only doing your job, Mr Potter, I believe,” she says evenly. Harry blinks and stares. It’s been over ten years since he last saw Narcissa Malfoy, but she barely looks a day older than forty. A regular user of
Draco was waiting in the queue for lunch when Harry just. Walked up to him and. Grabbed him by the front of his lab robes and. KISSED HIM.
Hermione and Ron both stop in their tracks. They slowly turn wide eyes towards Harry. Ron has his wine glass halfway to his mouth. Hermione’s lips are forming a perfect little ‘o’ of surprise.
He should have been honest with himself and admitted it: from the moment he’d seen Draco’s form on that blurry photograph amidst a stack of Ministry papers documenting his case, there had been no other outcome than the one he was facing today. This time, it was all in Draco’s hands.
The young woman who firecalled him had booked an interview for Harry two days later. She was professional and polite, and Harry could barely detect the faint tremble of awe he usually heard in people’s voices when they addressed him. With a smirk, he thought it was to be expected, coming from someone working for Malfoy: for all his faults, the man was one of the few people who had never grovelled in front of ‘Boy Who Lived’ Harry, so perhaps birds of a feather did flock together.
“I’m getting there,” he said. His other hand holding Harry’s trembling thigh, he gave his cock a pump, then licked the leaking slit, getting his first taste. It was salty-sweet and earthy, but far from unpleasant. Harry whined a little at the teasing contact.
“Yeah, thank you, ‘Mione," Harry said, shoveling more eggs into his mouth. Lucifer, the man still had the manners of a caveman. Draco's mother would choke if she ever witnessed her favourite hero’s table manners.
Draco puts his hands to Harry’s chest, ready to push him back. He doesn’t, though. “Because you said I’m your friend?”
“Are you done with classes, then?” Hermione asked the Seventh Year girls when the laughter had died down.
Malfoy raised his eyes to meet his. His expression shifted with a lopsided little smile. “You’ve been on my celebrity to-do list for a long time, Potter,” he said. His eyes sparkled with humour and mischief, and when he saw Harry’s exasperated eye-roll, he laughed.
“Let me guess,” he says, eyes on Harry. “Some high-ranking acquaintance invited you here as a result of a recent donation, am I correct?”
Suddenly, the Warming charms they had cast all over the balcony hadn’t been enough. The cold wind of December had pierced their protective bubble, the snow had resumed its fall, and Draco had shivered in his cloak.
Draco lowers his eyelids, touches the tips of his ring-clad, green-nail polished fingers to his lips. He’s the picture of guilelessness — not that anyone here will be fooled. They’ve been out with him at the clubs. Vogue Fabrics. Heaven. Ku. They know Draco attracts them like a magnet. All of them, like Seekers after the Golden Snitch. Girls, boys, and everyone in between.
He rested his forehead against the small of Harry’s back, his chin wet with his own saliva. Panting, he watched the needy clench of Harry’s hole as he asked, “Do you still want me, Harry?”
Still, Harry is hardly objective. I think it’s the whole goggle-wearing, crisp white lab robes-sporting, cartoon mad scientist look that Malfoy has going on for himself these days.
Harry could hear Malfoy’s lewd smirk in his question. He threw a surreptitious glance at him. He found him staring at him, grey eyes focused on their goal.
“See you later,” Greg waved at them. He was smiling, sitting close to their classmates. He still had that sad look in his eyes, and Draco doubted it would ever go away.
Harry feels more than sees the hand working his flies open, pushing the waistband of his boxers down. The warm air of the opera box feels cool on the heated skin of his aching cock.
When Harry steps into the room after her, he finds it furnished with two black leather sofas facing one another across a round walnut table where a single white hydrangea sits in a vase. The room is filled with sunlight. It’s warm and quiet, with a view over an outdoor garden. It’s so unexpectedly peaceful that for a second, Harry forgets that he is in a house in the middle of London, a house that belongs to Draco Malfoy, whom he’s about to meet again for the first time in a decade.
Draco felt several pairs of curious eyes on him. The Headmistress hadn’t asked to talk to him face to face since the beginning of Eighth Year. Theo lifted an eyebrow. Pansy stared at him with concern. At the other end of the table, Blaise murmured, shaking his head with a small smile, “What have you done this time, Malfoy?”
“Catch,” he says, and throws the balled-up t-shirt in Harry’s direction. Harry reflexively grabs it and holds it against his chest, his mouth hanging open a bit in a way that makes Draco’s face heat. “And stop gawking, for fuck’s sake,” Draco snaps. It sounds an awful lot like teasing. “It’s like you’ve never seen a topless man before.”
“Don’t worry about them, Potter. My concealment charms were always better than yours, even back at Hogwarts. I’ve only gotten better since then.”
“What is it?” Harry smiles at him. “You want me to get you a rasher of bacon from the kitchen, is that it?” The dog lets out a soft woof, lifting his ears. Harry laughs, hand on the dining room door handle. “All right, let me see if Ernestina would be okay with it.”
“That’s an accurate description of your wife." Draco smiles. "Give her my best. And good luck with the move.”
do it,” he tells them with a tilt of his chin, “and I’m going to walk among you and watch.” He claps his hands. “Bend and snap. Come on, ladies. Bend and snap! We’re not leaving here until you turn pro!”
Harry shuffles off to Draco’s desk. After what they just did —  after having Draco pinned under him against the door, after almost unhinging that door with the force of their — er… Eagerness? Yeah,
“Yes,” Draco concedes. “It’ll take some time to get used to. You’ve been working for me since I came back to London.”
isn’t it? Knowledge is lucidity, lucidity is power, power safeguards against going through life without noticing you’re madly in love with
“Merlin help us if I ever turn that sweet, Potter.” Harry lifts his brows, and Draco gives him a crooked smile. “I’m weirdly grateful for them, you know?” he confesses.
by the inexpressible pleasure of plowing into Harry’s tight, scorching heat. The kitchen was no longer quiet, filled instead with the filthy sounds of Draco’s flesh slapping against Harry’s arse, of Harry’s uninhibited moans, of his body rattling the cupboard doors with each of Draco’s thrusts. It was so good, and it’d been so long, and Draco didn’t want it to end, ever.
“Next steps, Scorpius, what are the next steps?” Harry had asked, trying to keep the desperate edge out of his voice. Eventually, Harry, with the help of Balzac gently nuzzling Scorpius’ side, had managed to get Scorpius back on a semblance of a routine; they’d all walked upstairs after Harry had Accio’d some bread and cheese for a quick snack for Scorpius — he’d doubted anyone was in the mood to eat a proper dinner, let alone cook it. Up on the first floor, he’d helped Scorpius get undressed. The boy had refused to even touch water. Harry had cast a mild Scourgify on Scorpius' face and hands, vanishing the grime and dried blood there. A proper bath would be a battle for another day. Then the three of them had moved to Scorpius’ bedroom. Harry had tucked the sheets around Scorpius, the way Draco had told him he always did. The boy’s magic had felt like an immobile dark mass tonight, like Harry was standing on the shore of Hogwarts’ Great Lake, wondering when the giant squid would burst out of the water. Balzac had jumped on the bed, curling at Scorpius’ feet, his big brown eyes blinking at his little master, and Harry’s heart had felt threateningly full.
In short: how could anyone enthusiastically subject oneself to a school reunion? Draco had no idea. He’d gone straight to Pansy and Blaise’s when he’d received the invitation, hoping to find a sympathetic shoulder to complain on. No one wanted to go to a school reunion when one was at a low, did one? In Draco’s case, the low in question was an uncomfortably public divorce. Astoria, his now ex-wife, was now gallivanting on the Amalfi Coast with a Muggle investment banker she’d met in one of the fundraisers Draco had always been too bored to attend. Blaise and Pansy, much to Draco’s dismay, hadn’t been the commiserating kind. They had already decided they’d go to the reunion, and Draco, by extension, had to tag along at all costs.
Harry clasps a hand to his mouth before a snorts escapes. He’s fairly certain a seven-year-old Scorpius would object to being called a '
Harry watches him move away, the toned lines of his back and arse shifting under his tight running clothes. If Draco was a stranger whom Harry ran into while on his daily jog…
“Draco!” he squealed. “I saw my final hour coming! Thank Lucifer you’re here to save me with the Fiendfyre-haired girl!”
Harry moved, his chest brushing against Draco. “No wonder your wife left you. No one would stand a prick such as you for so long and not pack their bags and leave.”
Potter’s hands closed into fists. For a split second, Draco felt the tiny thrill of anticipation that came before a fight. But Potter didn’t punch him in the face. He just stood very, very close, his angry breath on Draco’s face. Draco shifted on his feet. He hadn’t been in the spotlight of these intense green eyes in so long…
“Seriously, though. I mean no offense but… time has passed. You could try something else. You could do something else. How can you…”
“Well,” Harry says, eyes on the auditors’ certificate. His own voice sounds sour to his ears. “My job here is almost done. I hope you’re happy. I'll be out of your hair soon enough.”
Harry pulled back just a bit more. Draco stared. What a sight Harry made: mouth open, lips pink and wet, eyes dark with need. He was the most mind-blowing thing Draco had ever seen. It wasn’t just the way he looked, but just the fact that he was who he was. Harry Potter.
And now, here Malfoy is again. Picking the pockets of rich witches and wizards in the cloakroom of the Wizarding Chamber of Commerce. Harry can’t reconcile what he’s seeing with his memory of Malfoy. Granted, he’s thinking of old Malfoy —
it's six o’clock. Everyone in the house will be up soon. With a sigh, he swings his legs over the edge of the mattress and pats the bedside table for his glasses. His muscles are just sore enough to remind him all day of the night he’s just had. With anyone else, he’d perform a Numbing charm. With Draco… Well. Harry loves the feeling of having fucked so much he can barely walk. He doesn’t want to erase the proof of it lingering in his body.
is one thing,” Draco snapped back, “but this isn’t mourning, this is you feeling sorry for yourself!”
“I came to check in on you, Draco,” he said. He had a low, gravelly voice that had always seemed at odds with his size. “I have to admit I didn’t expect to get
“Fine,” Ginny rolled her eyes fondly. “We give him a week, see how it goes. If he behaves, he stays.”
I don't like metaphors. (Dr Dawson said that’s what that type of sentence is called.) I think it's the adults’ way of keeping private the things they don't want to share.
In the middle of the wreckage, when everybody else had left, Harry had cast a gentle Renervate on Balzac, helping the poor dog up on his feet. Balzac’s limp had been worse than before, and Harry had worried about a broken limb before he’d realised Balzac had a long splinter of wood stuck in the paw of his hind leg.
“Yeah.” Harry fiddles with the bottom of his jumper. He’s the one who agreed to jump down this rabbithole of confessions. “Many people I admired were Aurors… lots of members of the Order, you know.” Malfoy nods, his expression level. Harry carries on: “I thought I wanted to be an Auror because it was the only thing I could think of. It was a cool job; an important one. Kind of like wanting to be a firefighter when you’re five.”
When they step inside, the light mood from a few seconds ago dissipates, leaving a quiet solemnity in its wake. Draco’s office is as he left it in the evening before he joined Harry at the pub. It’s a mess of papers and cardboard boxes. The doors of the filing cabinets and the office supplies cupboard are still hanging open — the auditors apparently needed to check
When Harry pushes the door open, Draco is sitting on his bed, fully dressed, hands between his knees and head hanging forward.
They lay in each other’s arms for a while, but it’s a thoughtful stillness, like their words have opened a rift between them and Harry doesn’t know how to bridge the gap. He can’t help feeling like he’s freefalling through the air, like a Seeker diving after an elusive Snitch…
The Niffler pushed the cover aside and climbed over Draco’s duvet. He had a look on this tiny face... Lucifer, there was something almost
Draco sighs. He had hoped for more time… He thought he could at least go for a run, take a shower, feel blissfully empty by the time he’d meet Harry. On the other hand, Harry’s here right now. Might as well pull the metaphorical bandage, see where that takes them.
Draco groans and lifts himself off Harry. Despite his sex-mussed hair and disheveled clothing, he manages to sound bored. Harry is grudgingly impressed. “You can stop torturing us right now, Penelope. Yes,
“Sorry about your elbow,” Harry said as they walked out of Dervish and Banges. “That fall looked painful.”
Needless to say, he felt rather safe as to the latter. In his first ninety nine lives, he’d never loved anyone and no one had loved him in return. In the hundredth, the loveless status quo, sadly, remained. If Draco had recently started feeling something that wasn’t rage or frustration for a certain Gryffindor prat... well, no one needed to know.
Harry suddenly knew what he wanted out of this overrated evening. Knew what, maybe, he’d been chasing all the nights he’d pulled strangers in clubs and groupies on bleachers and fans on autograph tours. He’d been looking for someone who would make him feel that lightening bolt of attraction.
“Weekend breakfasts are big tradition in this house, Mistor,” she says. “It’s family time for Mistor Draco and
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake, mate,” Ron had yelled in his ear while the conga line he led passed by Harry, “get yourself a drink and stop looking so dour!”
of what makes me who I am. The rest is...the rest is my friendships, my family, my work. My memories from Hogwarts—yes, those too. The rest is Neville, our animals, our plants. Our home. Our future.
Just when they’re walking back up from the kitchen, the front door opens and closes, a flutter of footsteps, gentle murmurs and Balzac’s soft, happy barks.
“Mistor promise Ernestina he will not make rash decisions?” she asks, her hand coming up to cover the one resting on her shoulder.
“You fucking tease, Potter. Is that why you followed me around? Showing up at my interviews? Is that how badly you want me to fuck you?”
Harry reached the cabin first and flung himself against the door. Malfoy’s body slammed into his a second later with so much force it pinned Harry against the heavy wood.
In Draco’s opinion, the one thing that didn’t benefit from McGonagall’s decision to break up Houses and group students by year instead was Quidditch.
“Who said anything about flaunting? If we’re in this together, then why not just — tell me where you stand?”
They might not know I’ve an open invitation to all of the Holyhead Harpies matches—courtesy of my friend Blaise’s beautiful fiancée. They also might not know that I’m a rather good pastry chef.
“Mixed signals?” Malfoy’s eyes narrow. “You really are an idiot, Potter. I’ve wanted you—” he bites his lips, says, “I wanted you so much I went on my knees for you in public. Twice.” Malfoy pushes his hips against Harry’s with a grudging, helpless little sigh, and Harry bites back a moan, reaching for the table behind Malfoy. “Just look what you’re doing to me now…”
The room is a library. It’s magically lit with wall torches, lined with bookshelves from floor to ceiling, with a ladder in the corner to reach the higher shelves — the room must be thirteen feet tall — and a few club armchairs huddled around low, round tables.
“Because—” Draco’s hands clench into fists. His eyes turn stormy. “It will only make it so much more difficult. Hearing it won’t change a thing. Not when we can't be open about who we are.”
Harry’s face lit up. “Of course! Here,” he said, handing Draco one of the headphones. “Put it in your left ear, I’ll put the other one in my right. Like this,” he inserted the rounded tip of a headphone in his right ear, “See?”
As if Harry hadn’t spoken at all, Draco continues. “I’m sorry if it does. But… this is my office. I’m not going to hide, and I’m not going to police how I behave and what I wear—”
Ron casts a stasis charm towards the kitchen and sits across from Harry on the coffee table. Hermione doesn’t seem to mind. Since they’ve become parents, she’s grown a lot more tolerant of the mess and people sitting and standing where they shouldn’t.
“Oh, did you mean—” he lifted a paw, “All hail Lucifer, the Adversary, Destroyer of Kings, Angel of the Bottomless Pit, Prince of The World, Father of Lies, Spawn of Satan, and Lord of Darkness?” He gave Draco an exasperated look. “I did announce myself properly. You just chose to ignore me and to listen to the call of your knob instead.”
Last night was… Harry is at a loss for comparisons. He’s never had anything like it. He studies Draco’s calm, sleeping face as his eyes adjust to the darkness. They had honest-to-god made love until the fire had died in the hearth of Draco’s study. Until Harry had felt like he’d shown Draco all the overflowing desire he felt for him, and then reached within himself to find more. Yeah, he’d always find more. He doesn’t think he can ever reach the bottom of it. He sees it now: it’s been there since he was a teenager — dormant under layers of antagonism too intense for comfort.
me?” There’s a dangerous undercurrent of sarcasm to his words, and for a second Harry’s certain Draco is done with him for good. Then the mocking glint shifts in his eyes and they turn flinty once again. “I don’t need you, Potter. I’ve never needed you. Not when I was bleeding out on the tile of that horrible bathroom, not when I was facing trial at the Wizengamot, not when I was grieving my wife and raising my child, not when the Ministry fucking decided I was the next man to bring down, not now. I can take care of myself just fine without you.”
The way he said the word made Harry groan, his cock twitching needily against his belly. “Mmh, yes,” Malfoy said quietly. “You really want this, don’t you?” He sat back on his knees so that Harry could see his face. With a smirk that looked too confident for Harry’s good, he brought his middle finger to his mouth and sucked it in with a moan, slowly,
I’ve seen that name so many times before. It’s on all the kid paraphernalia I see, all over London. Hell, even Hermione raves about her Nesting pushchair...  How did I not see it before?” He drops his hand, and the parchment falls to the ground. “This has got something to do with you. Doesn’t it?” When Draco doesn’t reply, Harry lets out a frustrated exhale. “Draco… You’ve
Dewey has known Harry for years now, but he still calls him by his last name when the rest of the wizarding world thinks it’s perfectly okay to call him ‘Harry’ as though he’s their friend. Their family. Their Saviour.
Harry walked up to him, bag in hand, cloak thrown over his shoulder. He placed his hand on Draco’s shoulder for him to follow.
“If you’ll excuse me,” he says. He stalks inside before Harry can take his hand, and disappears through the French doors.
Harry wanted to see how this evening would end. A fist on the mouth or a kiss on the lips? Either was a possibility.
And you won't even let me—” He rakes his hands in his hair, lets out a frustrated groan. “You're the one who made up that rule!”
“I haven’t said anything,” Harry says with a small smile, “and anyway, I would imagine other kinds of ‘guests’ might not need a guest room.”
By experience, that’s a surefire way to make him look like he belongs, like he’s a normal person just going about his job. It’s always worked brilliantly in making him look inconspicuous.
It was a cruel twist of fortune that Draco had seen Harry more times in the past month than he had since that ill-fated night two years ago.
Harry leans in and kisses him. It’s supposed to be a soft, sated kiss; but there’s a wistful edge to it, because Draco’s laid out his conditions, and Harry isn’t ready to meet them yet.
Malfoy pulled out with a filthy wet sound, his long, thick cock pink and gleaming in the darkness. Sitting on his knees, he grabbed Harry by the hips and pulled, leveled him up with his pelvis. Harry squirmed, frustrated, as Malfoy studied his arsehole, which he imagined fluttering, swollen and glistening with lube. By the hungry, focused look on Malfoy’s face, he was certainly right. Because Malfoy lined up his cock again and slid slowly, impossibly,
“What?” Draco hisses, eyes narrowed. His hands fist Harry’s soaked shirt, and he doesn’t seem to notice. “What are you saying, Harry?”
“Gentlemen,” she started. “I have called you in this evening to discuss the matter of your post-graduation career choices.”
“I know. I can’t risk it,” Harry says. “It has to be me. Anyone else they put in my place would be Kingsley’s lap dog. Or worse,
“Really?” Her eyes were shining excitedly. Harry had warned Draco that Granger was the kind of person who could never turn down a problem to solve. Clearly, he had been right. “It is Professor Vector’s homework? Because I solved the triple equation problem two days ago and I could show you—oh, Draco, you’ll see, it’s simple once you understand how it works—”
Penelope Clearwater stands from her desk, her chair doing a half spin as she does. She lifts a regal, placating hand, and the argument falls quiet. The girls look at her reverently. Even Draco leans back in his chair, expectant.
“Everyone’s so used to the cold now, it’s become part of Hogwarts’s winter traditions. You know: Christmas pudding, glowing fir trees, enchanted ornaments everywhere, and then there’s also the occasional sneeze and runny nose.”
Potter downed half his glass, his emerald-green eyes intent on Draco. He was still frowning, this time more in curiosity. The line between his brows was annoyingly endearing. “So you’re wearing glasses now?”
Malfoy,” he said. “So I’d appreciate it if you could just let me enjoy the view and bask in my misery.”
Potter lowers his eyes. It’s a relief — his stare feels like a burn on Draco’s skin. “Nothing. Whatever you like. You asked me what bothered me and… I was honest. You’ve always felt… inevitable. To me. And now I— I finally understand why.”
he mouths, and they scatter with a round of quiet giggles. Draco goes to sit at his desk. He watches, blatant and teasing, as Potter finishes with Penelope.
“Hello, Mr Potter,” says Dewey, the Minister’s secretary. He looks up from the large diary on his desk, a golden curl falling on his forehead.
Hermione thinks he’s coming down with a new bout of depression. She and Ron take on popping by Harry’s flat three times a week. Hermione brings curry and chicken soup, Ron brings crisps and beer. Harry is touched by his friends’ solicitude, yet he can’t tell them the truth.
His hand jerked away from his prick so fast he almost toppled over and out of the bed. This time, there was no doubt. Someone was in Draco’s bed. Panting hard, he sat up and pulled the covers over his straining cock.
“Old metal and—” Jeff’s paws flew to hold his face. “Draco, have you no shame?” At that, Draco threw the ring in the air and caught it like he would a ball. It seemed to work to stress his point, as Jeff positively looked like he was about to have a stroke. “You haven’t,” he said, appalled, “you truly haven’t.”
The red flash hits Smith square in the chest, cutting him off and sending him stumbling backwards, limp body falling against the ravaged grand piano.
Mrs Weasley greeted Draco and Harry with pink cheeks and chocolate sauce splattered across her forehead.
Thanks for sticking with Harry and Draco through this rollercoaster of feels. I hope you enjoy today's chapter <3
“The only thing I’m saying is that you’re still alone all these years later, and so am I. There’s a reason for it.”
and the seeds are always highly unstable, and they could explode any minute if we don’t attend to them.”
“I thought so,” he says in icy tones. “Well, I think we’ve said what we needed to say, Potter. I’ll be sure to do a better job of avoiding you in the future.”
Because there were only two things that could kill a demon, and plotting Harry Potter’s assassination wasn’t one.
“Merlin, Ron, you’ve got to stop acting like me and Harry splitting up is the end of the world,” Ginny chaffed him. “I assure you I’m happier with Luna.”
The Prothimioscope was buzzing at the foot of Luna’s armchair. Quiet and innocuous like the glossy black beetle that was attempting to scale the potted Asphodel nearby, the golden device anchored Draco in the moment. A mundane, reassuring reminder that this was just another day at Draco’s job, even though it felt like anything but. He didn’t regret coming up with the idea of the
Pansy says, waving her hand offhandedly. “As if Draco would ever sleep with someone for anything less than
“Mistor Draco was expecting you laters, sir,” Ernestina tells him. A stark contrast with Balzac’s merry welcome, there’s no effusion in her tone — it’s cold and practical, all the goodwill Harry built with her in the past months gone up in smoke. Draco must have told her, then.
Mephistopheles took a deep, steadying inhale. “The bosses want him gone. They can’t afford to let the Boy Who Destroyed An Opportunity walk away unscathed. Humans like him need to be taught a lesson.”
Easy for Hermione to say. She and Ron had been together for ten years, and happily married for three. They had brilliant careers at the Ministry. They were well-adjusted, functional adults. Getting to that point after everything they’d been through seemed like an impossible feat to Harry. Because Harry… well, Harry was nothing of the sort. He had a brilliant career, all right.
Ugh!” Mephistopheles reached up to rake his fingers through his hair. Sadly for him, there wasn’t much of it left, the few remaining strands brittle and singed. “That’ll teach me to agree to tutor younglings. Teenage demons are
Draco lowers his eyes, the pleased blush unmistakeable across his cheekbones. Harry wants to kiss him again because kissing Draco Malfoy is intoxicating, just as he expected. It’s about the only thing that is expected about Draco Malfoy. And Harry might never want to stop kissing him at all.
at the Paris Opera. He turns around to review the room once more. It looks like a small, less-used version of Malfoy’s office downstairs, but Harry’s trained eye doesn’t spot anything out of the ordinary. He walks over to Malfoy’s bedroom, feeling oddly guilty, like he’s snooping around. Which, to be fair, is exactly what he’s doing.
Draco opened one of the books just to have an excuse to peel his eyes away from Harry. “The options are countless, apparently. There’s too much choice, and nothing to guide us through the various alternatives.” He pointed at a decision diagram that started with the question, ‘Do you enjoy riding Hippogriffs?’. “I'm starting to think McGonagall is as clueless about this as we are.”
for days after she leaves. Brought me the chocolates I like from Paris, the ones with whole hazelnuts inside. Texture melty but not too much. Sweet. Crunchy, with a bitter aftertaste.) Uncle Greg is in London for a week, with his wife. (The tall, scary one.) (I really like her.) He asked me if I could draw him a unicorn, but I prefer the piano now. Unicorns when I was four. And dragons.
“Choices you made years ago might not apply anymore.” Draco's expression softens, almost sympathetic. “You don’t owe them anything, Harry. You’re…
The truth of what they’re doing, of what they’re about to do. He blushes again, hides his face into the cushions, embarrassed by his own innocence. On top of him, Harry holds still, his lips against Draco’s shoulder, trying to control his breath. God, the feel of Harry’s body covering his is like a revelation. The pliant weight of him is like water to a man dying of thirst. Draco is suddenly glad for his years of chastity; suddenly glad Harry gets to be the first one in such a long time. The last person he got to touch like that was Astoria… he lets his mind rest on the thought for a second, wonders if she'd be happy for him, if she'd poke good-natured fun about Harry —
“No,” Harry said, mulish frown firmly in place. It still sounded like a ‘yes’ to Draco. Draco drew a breath, trying to collect himself. As much as he loved Harry, Harry needed to hear this from him.
Harry obeys Malfoy. Possibly for the first time in his life, but then again when has Malfoy ever been so persuasive? When has he ever been so… hot. So —
Malfoy takes the tip of Harry’s cock in his mouth, giving it a few slow, flat-tongued strokes, and Harry bites his lip to avoid crying out in the hushed quiet of the cloakroom. Merlin, he could come just from this… Fucking come in Malfoy’s mouth, right here and now, and his legs shake with the effort of keeping his focus. A sound comes from Malfoy’s throat, a low, satisfied rumbling and his lips slide and stretch around Harry’s cock, slowly taking him in. Harry closes his eyes. His senses are too full, and watching Malfoy is just too much. He thinks,
They stepped onto the lawn and set off in the direction of the Quidditch pitch. The night was quiet around them, stars twinkling in the black sky. The sounds of music and chatter filtered out from the castle, but the reunion party seemed like worlds away. Next to him, Malfoy was silent, a tense frown on his face.
His face was shiny and pink, his glasses fogged and askew. His eyes were guarded, but he was wearing a small, smug smile that made Draco’s heart flutter. Merlin, he might never want to pull his pants back up again…
Draco studies him for a long moment, the light of the day’s sun slowly fading from red to a pale blue. Harry holds his breath and waits, hoping, wondering. Draco nods eventually, but the glint in his eyes doesn’t soften. “I’m starting to
At Pansy’s thoughtless comment, Draco freezes next to Harry. Slowly, all eyes turn to him. Pansy’s hand lifts, as if in slow motion, to cover the quiet
He takes a breath, and the pages of sheet music flip back to the beginning, as if on their own accord. Then Scorpius starts playing again.
Once they were outside, Malfoy lengthened his stride to match Harry’s quick walk towards the exit. He gave his arm a light pull.
like a job, and every look, every word, every little change in Draco’s mercurial moods hits Harry in a very real, very personal manner. Maybe he’s overthinking this. Maybe he’s just on edge after reading Kingsley’s and Ron’s notes. Maybe he feels like he’s failing them — he’s failing
Nothing has seemed to wipe the skeptical look on Ron’s face, so Harry had skittered away and out. He’d stopped on the steps of the Chamber of Commerce for a minute, face turned towards the starless London sky, and had taken a deep breath.
“Yeah,” Harry says. “It’s not just the house preventing me from doing my job, no matter what you say, Hermione. I’ve had this gut feeling about Draco since I started on the case. And the fact that I’ve—” He swallows, slides his eyes away. He knows he’s blushing. “—that I’ve fallen for him doesn’t change that.”
Harry eyed him dubiously. They walked in silence, further down the main street. Harry stopped in front of Scrivenshaft’s Quill Shop.
To Hades with it. No use in standing around. He’d fulfilled his end of the bargain. He’d only got polite nods from a few ex-Slytherins who’d stayed at an insulting distance from him. Nobody’d come to strike up a chat. Pansy and Blaise were dancing the tango in the middle of the Great Hall now, for Merlin’s sake. Draco clearly wasn’t needed. He set his glass on the corner of the buffet and shrugged his jacket on, not trying to hide his petulance. He didn’t care. He was getting out of here.
On behalf of the Department of Mysteries. It was all very formal, if that worries you. No breach of protocol that would impact the case against my company. At least until I answered personally and she… got rather enthusiastic about the prospect of our working together on her project.”
but there are a few others that we read and paired with Muggle personality tests and career suitability research.”
“I think you’re doing a pretty good job of it,” he tells him. “Being real. Being a father.” He’s not even lying, and he doesn’t know where the impulse came from.
Harry lifts his hand and knocks on the heavy door, the golden serpent hitting the wood too loudly in the morning-quiet street. The door opens. Ernestina is inside, hands clasped in front of her, her clothes — a floral blouse, a pair of navy capris — perfectly pressed as always. The hydrangeas in the vases look fresh and dewy. Grey daylight is falling from the skylights, bathing Draco’s foyer in soft, welcoming light. The yearning in Harry’s chest rears its head, claws at his ribs.
play a part in my reconstruction?” she repeated. “Of course, Draco. Of all the questions in this interview, this one is the silliest. The fact that you’d even ask it tells me a lot more about
Like any sane person, Harry had questioned his decision to come to the tenth year Hogwarts reunion from the moment he’d set foot in the Great Hall. He couldn’t imagine what drove people who actually looked forward to these things. To him, a school reunion could be summed up in three “X”s: ex-friends, ex-girlfriends, ex-people he’d gotten into fist fights with. The people he was still friends with, he obviously still saw. The people he liked to date nowadays had little chance to be here. As for getting into fist fights, he’d dropped out of the habit after one too many of his drunken rows had made the cover of every wizarding tabloid under the British sun. As such, Harry’s interest in the school reunion was minimal. The event was bound to be awkward, full of unpleasant memories, and constantly interrupted by sycophants hoping to get Harry Potter’s autograph.
Harry pushed himself deeper. He pressed his forehead against Malfoy’s nape as he thrust inside, inch by inch, the feel of Malfoy’s arse enclosing him almost enough to make him come right there.
“They’ll assign another team of Aurors on it, probably. Smith is the Financial Auditing Director. He holds no police power.”
Pansy found him in the Magical Careers section of the Library. He was so lost in thought he didn't hear her coming.
The girls giggle behind their hands as a furious blush creeps up the side of Potter’s neck and he swallows helplessly. Draco glides out of the pose and turns to face him, arms crossing against his chest, fists pushing his biceps into a more prominent position, still smirking. Penelope is the only one with the presence of mind to put Potter out of his misery.
Harry stumbles inside beside him, bewildered but laughing along. It’s one of those rare evenings when Draco’d chosen not to work and instead let Ernestina watch Scorpius. He and Harry had gone to the pub together. It wasn’t anything anyone would ever consider exciting, but it’s not like Draco’d ever made a habit of it before Harry. After all, he was a single father and, in the words of Harry, grinning and poking his side,
“Put your hands on the door,” Draco said. His voice was low but his tone was purposeful. As though in slow motion, Harry nodded and obeyed. His arms bracketing Draco’s face, he waited, shivering. Draco smirked and slowly, so slowly, fingers trailing down Harry's sides, he slid down Harry’s body and fell to his knees.
The rosy glow of late afternoon is turning Draco’s face softer. It’s almost dusk — Harry didn’t notice the sun starting to set over the line of the buildings beyond his window. The sky is fading to a pale red, Draco is offering him something in this response — a yearning for trust, an admission of some sort — and Harry suddenly feels so relieved he could choke. He considers his answer for a moment.
“I know. Late morning, right? Half past eleven. But I was in the neighbourhood and…” And it’s lame. Harry just couldn’t stand pacing around his living room at Grimmauld Place, so he came here two hours earlier on the off chance Draco would be available to see him.
Harry hesitates, then curls around Malfoy’s back, hand on the dip of his waist. Malfoy doesn’t move, but doesn’t push him off either, and Harry takes it as a good sign.
“So,” Harry says. He doesn’t know if he should smile or scowl, so he settles on watching  Hugo play with his fingers.
“Merlin, Harry, should we start looking for a replacement for Malfoy? You’ve caught the Snitch at nearly every game, it’s almost not fun anymore,” Dean Thomas was saying.
The next few seconds feel like an eternity. Harry considers reaching for his wand, feels idiotic for it. When Draco’s form finally appears in the doorway, Harry’s breath leaves him in a rush. He doesn't know how long he’d been holding it.
“Seeing something that interests you?” Draco quirked an eyebrow. “Did you really hope to have me believe you were here out of genuine concern for me?” He opened his hand, keeping its content inches away from Jeff’s reach. Inside lay his signet ring, the one his father had given him on Platform 9 ¾, minutes before his first boarding of the Hogwarts express eight years ago. The ring shone mutely in the dim light filtering through the four-poster’s curtains, the silver circle embossed with snakes and dragons. The emerald engraved with the ‘M’ of ‘Malfoy’ at its centre gave off a dull gleam, like light filtering through pond water. The twitch of Jeff’s nose intensified and he took a step closer before Draco closed his fist around the ring again. “You want this, don’t you?”
“She won’t bother you too much. You can get on with your writing. She sleeps a lot right now. You’ll just need to feed her a bucket of brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour—”
“Thank you for confirming you don’t have any,” Ron pulled her close and kissed her cheek. Hermione giggled and pushed him off.
Three: I’m still waiting for your answer to my question. It’s not very polite to leave a bloke hanging.
“How is Scorpius?” he asks, trying to sit upright. Draco moves the chair to the side of Harry’s bed, a frown on his face. His features are gaunt, deep, dark circles under his eyes. He looks like he’s been through agony and back.
Harry reluctantly pulls away from Draco’s orbit. It’s not an easy thing to do, and even the foot of distance feels cold. He leans against the counter and crosses his arms in a rather unbelievable show of nonchalance. “So are you going back out there?”
“Hey, mate,” Ron greets him. He stands as Kingsley and Harry walk in, his freckled face crinkling with a cautious smile. “Nice seeing you again.”
If he had… If he’d even had the image of Draco’s scars in mind when he was going over that moment of his life with his therapist (over and over and over, analysing every one of his thoughts, motives, gestures, the feel of Draco’s hot blood gushing out of the wounds and the freezing water seeping through his trousers... he’d talked about it for weeks before he even started to get a sense of closure) — if he’d had that image in mind, he’d still be sitting in Angelica’s office, tearing his hair out over his own stupidity and blindness.
“Oh, I think the answer is tailor-made for this moment, Potter,” Malfoy murmured. “Without hesitation, I would do
You think I’m sorry? Nah. I hate those lifts with a passion. Just standing in one makes me shut down like I’m having a panic attack. Releasing some
“Draco Malfoy,” Auror Boyle’s words echo in the quiet study. Her voice is trembling, barely — but Harry hears it nonetheless. “You are under arrest for obstructing an investigation and attacking a Ministry official.” She takes a breath, casting a quick, apologetic glance at Harry and Scorpius. Then her eyes turn to Draco once more. “I’ll ask you to follow us without making more of a scene. You are entitled to a lawyer and a firecall once we arrive on Ministry premises.”
according to some people who call themselves my friends, and your loneliness shines like a fucking beacon. You and I are perfectly suited for this, aren’t we?” He pulled back a second, releasing his grip on their cocks. “How much more nicely do you want me to ask you?”
“Draco, a rock on the moon would get your meaning.” Blaise had said, swirling the last dregs of his whiskey around the bottom of his tumbler. “I daresay even rocks on the moon know you’re dangerously underfucked. Time to remedy that.”
Draco pushes himself off Harry’s body, lifts his head just enough to give his colleagues what Harry guesses is his best murderous glare.
Draco bursts out laughing. “Fuck off, Potter. You’ve spent too much time listening to Ministry gossip about me.”
Harry’s eyes snap to hers. He’s surprised that he never thought about his feelings for Draco in those terms. “I— maybe,” he tells her, as honestly as he can. “Maybe… I could be.”
“I knew you’d done something to them,” Harry chokes as he feels Malfoy’s hand move between his legs. His palm presses against Harry’s erection — fuck, god, he’s already so hard — and Malfoy gives a contented little sound from the back of his throat. Harry needs to be certain that they’re safe, before they go— before they go any further. “And— the sound?”
was so much more than he had ever hoped to be with Harry. This in itself was nothing short of a miracle. Asking for more was the most ungrateful Draco had ever been.
This was where Draco had sought refuge that year, when Snape's harsh support wasn’t enough to keep the nightmares at bay, when he was so scared to die that the mere thought of falling asleep gave him panic attacks: Pansy’s bed. She was so patient with him, and so was Blaise, his dark eyes glinting in the darkness of the closed drapes around Pansy’s four-poster bed. Pressed between the bodies of his lovers, Draco could forget about the rest of his life for a few moments. The cabinet that refused to be fixed; that room,
“And you dashed off so bloody fast that day, I was certain you regretted our night together. Of course I wasn’t going to firecall you. You see, I usually prefer my men fully enthusiastic about a relationship with me.”
“What about this one?” The Auror who’s holding Ernestina’s bound wrists asks, shaking her slightly. She whimpers in fear.
He glanced at Draco, and Draco felt his cheeks burn. “Maybe take a year, two years off after Hogwarts. See more of the world. Travel. Think things through.”
Harry dropped himself on the rug at the foot of Draco’s armchair and set his cup of mulled wine next to him.
Harry turns a frantic, pleading gaze at Malfoy. He’s already rehearsing a promise for silence in his head, anything to keep Malfoy quiet about the whole incident, and Malfoy must see his intention written all over his face.
“Yes, Harry, yes,” Malfoy was mumbling against the side of his neck, “I can feel you, oh, you’re going to feel so tight around my cock, I—”
He wonders, hazily, if he’s being rude, if he’s being rough, if Malfoy wants to slow down… just when Malfoy’s hand slithers up his thigh and cups his balls.
He exhales in an attempt to relax. His leg is jiggling and he makes a conscious effort to keep still, his fingers clasped tightly in his lap. God, he’s nervous. This is a first for him. He hasn’t felt nervous at the start of a job since his first case for the Ministry, when he’d wiretapped a Floo network connected to Death Eaters’ safehouses. Back then, he was barely a few months over twenty one.
“Sure, Malfoy,” Potter said, rolling his eyes. “So you’ve come to the reunion to brag about your perfection, then?”
Want. The driving force behind these encounters with Draco Malfoy. He wants, with a force that takes his breath away.
“Not yet,” growled Malfoy, marching up to Harry. He grabbed him by the shirt, rammed him against the lockers, and crashed his mouth to Harry’s.
“Aww, love,” Ginny Weasley wrapped her arm around her girlfriend’s shoulders. Jeff the Niffler, his emerald collar glimmering in the firelight, jumped in Luna’s lap and snuggled closer to her. “You
“I’m going to make you come,” Malfoy announced, breathless and delighted, “fuck yes, you’re going to come and squeeze my cock so tight, Potter.”
Draco nodded cautiously. Whatever career plans he may have had were moot before he even fully formed them. After all, he’d never had a chance to pursue any of them in the course of his hundred lives. His lives always ended right before he turned nineteen, before he’d even have the chance to give a thought about potential careers. Why would he bother, really?
Harry hesitated before joining him on the bench. It was cold in the cabin—definitely not as cold as outside had been, or was certainly now, yet cold enough for Malfoy’s body heat to feel like the most enticing thing in the world,
It’s dark. Nobody thought of building a new fire, or switching on the small lamp on Draco’s desk. And now nobody thinks of casting a Lumos
Potter’s odd, awe-struck expression cleared. He frowned, leaned around Draco, and grabbed a glass of champagne. “You haven’t changed one bit, have you?”
and Draco stops, hands fisted in his shirt, panting lightly. He looks at Harry, eyes suddenly wide — then lets go of him and takes a step back. “Merlin,” he says, rubbing his jaw. “Sorry. I don’t know what got into me. I’m — out of line, sorry—”
“You’d be surprised how many Muggles know about it. The Statute of Secrecy is a fluid thing when you reach the social strata where secrets are dealt at the same scale as money and privilege. Cavendish sponsored a lot of his little magic friends during the war — shady actions that went undetected both by the magical and Muggle authorities. Money transactions involving Gringotts accounts can easily be covered on the Muggle side, and the magical community’s willful ignorance of all things non-magic makes it all the harder to trace questionable transactions back to the Muggle world.”
“Oh, don’t rush! I’m putting the kettle on!” Luna waved her wand and conjured two tea cups. “Let’s make you a cuppa. And Harry, too. Here.” Luna gave a cup to Draco, and the other one to Harry once he finished drying his hands.
Harry thinks about his own best friends, and how he would share Saturday breakfast at home with them without a second thought. They’re
When he finishes, he stays like that, leaning slightly over the keyboard, fingers caressing the white keys. Harry swallows. There’s a lump in his throat that wasn’t there before. The sweet poignancy of the music lingers in the air.
something for the man. He straightens, turns, nods at Harry. “You’re early. We’ll talk later. Now. Let’s go now.”
And honestly, that one would open a whole can of Flobberworms Harry isn’t ready to examine too closely.
The second level has darker wood on the floors, with matching furniture. Unlike the study upstairs, this one has a wall covered from floor to ceiling in shelves of vinyl records. So the ones he thought he saw in Malfoy’s office weren’t a trick of the eyes, then. Harry walks to the shelves, pulls out one of the records. It’s a copy of Janis Joplin’s
As quietly as he came up, he walks back downstairs. Balzac is waiting for him at the foot of the stairs. He lets out a soft, questioning whine.
“I know you don’t need it.” Harry lets his arm fall to his side. “I’m still doing it. I didn’t know… I don’t know how to make amends for it.”
He very well knew it wasn’t fear that made him shake. He refused to acknowledge that particular thought. Now was not the time.
Draco’s birthday dinner is surprisingly delightful despite the mismatched crowd. They all gather in Draco’s study, the wide open French doors letting the sounds and smells of a late spring evening drift inside. After a few minutes where everybody seems to stare stonily at one another, Scorpius interrupts the stilted conversations by announcing he’s going to play a piano piece for his father’s birthday.
Was it the Snitch? Could Malfoy hold Harry’s unwillingness to share that personal bit of history against him? Or had he been hurt by Harry’s wish to keep their relationship under wraps? Malfoy couldn’t very well expect Harry to run to the press and make a big official announcement about them, could he? They’d only seen each other a couple of times — and none of these times had been planned. Until the last night they’d spent together, Harry hadn’t seriously envisaged being involved with Malfoy in any way. It wasn’t until Malfoy had settled in Harry’s kitchen, and later, in his bed, that Harry had let himself dream of starting something more with the man.
“Yes. You told me about you, and Ginny, and how she was dating Luna, and how you preferred men...” Draco knew he was blushing but he pushed his bashfulness away and trudged on, “and I think it would have been a good opportunity for me to be honest with you about something too.”
The door opens with a slow creak. The lumbering frame of Greg Goyle appears, silhouetted in the light coming from the parlour. He seems to dither in the doorway, eyebrows drawn down against the relative darkness of Draco’s study, lit only by the fire crackling in the hearth and the small Muggle lamp on Draco’s desk.
“In the getting fucked in the arse area.” Malfoy says, his voice a strained whine. If Harry wasn’t desperately hard, he’d feel pretty proud for eliciting that kind of sound from him. “Alright, hold on— let me— do the spells.”
Malfoy laughed. “Really? I fucked you into the ground barely a minute ago and you’re already asking for a do-over?”
Fleur Delacour. George Weasley. Blaise, even. He’d interviewed them all, and he had survived. What was the worst that could happen today, really? Lovegood had always been the most harmless of the bunch.
—” he lifts a suggestive eyebrow, “—these days.” And smirks when all his coworkers gasp in shock and start arguing,
Luna had suggested a cup of tea at the end of the first hour of the interview. The rhythm of questions and answers had been gruelling, more so for Draco than for Luna, he suspected. He’d brought the Prothimioscope and his notes with him when they’d moved to the kitchen. The golden top was still spinning brightly on the thick wooden counter covering the central island, indicating the interview was still in progress despite the informal setting.
Harry turns his hand, palm up, fingers brushing against the edge of Malfoy’s hand. He supposes that the orchestra still plays, somewhere down the balcony; that the dancers still spin through the moves of the choreography. He can’t hear a thing over the thundering pulse in his ears.
He made his way around the dancefloor, pushing through the crowd with soft “excuse me”s. People moved aside to let him pass, and by the time they realised who he was, he was already walking away. The faces all looked familiar, but Harry was surprised by how few names he remembered. It was safer to avoid everyone, rather than spend uncomfortable minutes in conversation with people he couldn’t even place.
“I enjoy my… anonymity, as you can very well imagine. I usually wear a glamour when I’m on a job. Having Harry Potter on one’s security team is a double-edged sword.” His rueful smile is perfectly practiced. “I’m… er.
“Something about it bothers you, though. You find it… provocative. That I am who I am. That I dress the way I dress, that I move the way I move.”
“Mistor Potter says he is in the neighbourhood, sir,” Ernestina rolls her eyes, clearly not fooled. “If Mistor Draco wants to sees him now.”
“I know how much it means to tell people,” Harry said softly. “I’m... touched. That you’ve told me.”
They had two beers each, and now Draco is tipsy and giddy enough that he wants to celebrate. Up in his Caduceus office, where the cause for celebration awaits them.
“Of course, yeah,” Harry said, casting a look around them. “I don’t think there’s any avoiding the personality tests, though.”
Malfoy. I kind of have… this ridiculous fantasy about you. You’re fit and—I like—” Merlin, he was struggling to get the words out. “I like to imagine how you could… feel like. If we ever… you know.” He shrugged with a dismissive laugh. “I told you it was stupid.”
Granger turned her thunderous gaze at Draco and Draco threw his hands up. “Don’t look at me! I don’t know a thing! I am beyond grateful for your help!” He scowled at Harry. “Leave me out of it, Potter.”
Sensing the flood of sadness rolling from everyone around him in waves, Draco gathered his courage and said: “I want to write.”
“Okay.” Despite Hermione's admonishment, Harry laughs. “You do talk about it like it’s a car.” The pushchair sits folded against the leg of the kitchen table, and little Hugo bats his arm, trying to reach it. Hermione laughs, a soft, domestic sound, and ruffles her son’s hair as the baby squeals in delight. Something about the scene tugs at the corner of Harry’s subconscious, but he can’t pinpoint it. The kettle whistles, and he loses track of his thoughts.
What brought you to this life? This occupation? I might show up again, see the play another time. I was too distracted
Was that blowjob a way to repay Harry for the testimony that had saved Malfoy’s life all these years ago?
Harry just stares back. “That’s a lot of money, but I’m not sure I understand why it’s a problem. The Malfoys have been wealthy for generations. That’s all Malfoy ever talked about in school. What he did with his family money is none of the Ministry’s business as long as it’s not illegal, is it?”
“I have noticed,” Harry’s breath tickled his neck again before he sat back with a smug smile. “Get ready to have your mind blown.”
“Fuck yes,” Malfoy breathed, his cheeks colouring. A slow, genuine smile spread on his lips. “Yes. Let’s do this.”
Draco’s eyes dropped to Harry’s flies. The sneaky bastard had managed to open them and  pull his jeans and pants a few inches down. His long, beautiful cock was jutting out, hard and already leaking at the slit, and Draco ached to touch it.
Wiggle out from under the covers, legs hanging on the side of the bed. Bedside table. Mummy and Daddy smile (at me) from inside the frame. They’re always the same, in the photograph. Daddy looks young. (His eyes joyous, bright.) (Sometimes I have to look away.) Mummy looks big, soft, happy. (Daddy says it’s because I was there, in her belly.)
“The Headmistress wants me to tell Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy that they are expected in her office,” the small boy announced, quivering with the importance of his mission. “You can join her there now.”
Draco fought the impulse to grab Potter by the collar of his shirt. “Well, it must be like looking in the mirror for you, then. Which is your favourite activity, isn’t it?”
Malfoy was human after all. “And secondly, yes, actually, that’s how I survived until the ripe old age of 25. By taking one problem at a time.”

“Breakfast shall be ready in a few minutes,” they hear Draco say as he climbs the stairs back into the dining room. He flicks narrowed eyes from Harry to Narcissa, taking in the tense atmosphere. “Merlin, Mother. Did you just give Harry the
This time was different. Malfoy slipped into the kiss like only a Slytherin could, lithe and long against Harry, pressing him into the locker door. His thumbs traced Harry’s cheeks while he kissed him, slid down the sides of his neck, around his shoulders, into the small of his back. Harry gave himself to it, kissing Malfoy with joyful abandon. God, Malfoy was a good kisser. Harry couldn’t remember the last time he’d been kissed like this, with the same mixture of dedication and hunger. That was what felt so different. Harry felt
“During the war, there was one thought that kept nagging me as I read article after article of shite I couldn’t trust. How could one be sure that the person writing it is doing so on their own free will? Or that the person they’ve interviewed is not coerced, bribed, Imperiused, or threatened?" He gave his head a shake. "After the war, I spent three years in a juvenile rehabilitation centre for wizarding delinquents. They allowed a few hours of free activities a day. We could read, play cards or chess, listen to Quidditch games on the wireless. There were also tools and materials available to those of us who felt like working with our hands. Over the course of those three years, I made the Prothimioscope my own little project.”
a voice that sounds like a suspicious mix of Ron’s and Hermione’s remarks in the back of his mind, but he shrugs it off. Harry’s in this cloakroom for a mundane, legitimate reason. He’s certain the stranger is not.
It may come as a surprise to you, but I don’t go around telling everyone everything that’s on my mind at any given time. Even my friends. I had the most ridiculous crush on you for years. I’d just spent the night with you. I needed time to process what happened between us...what could happen after. I wasn’t ready to regale Pansy with stories about your favourite position or the size of your dick.”
Grimacing, he casts cleaning and drying charms on both their crotches. Harry watches the swirl of magic, eyes crinkled with a playful grin. “If I’d known you’d be bestowing gay wisdom on me when I came here, I’d have brought my school supplies.”
“Draco, honey, you were sixteen, emotionally and sexually repressed, and prone to mood swings and panic attacks. I know this was through no fault of your own, and you’ve had ten years of therapy, amazing friends, and marriage—while it lasted—to become a better person. Let’s face it: you weren’t exactly the hottest eligible bachelor in your last years at Hogwarts—”
He took a step back. “I don’t know if you show up at your friends’ when I’m interviewing them by coincidence or to keep an eye on me, because Merlin forbid I’ve become trustworthy. I don’t know if you’re here to rile me up, or to tease me endlessly with something I’ll never have.”
He walks down the stairs, Balzac on his heels. The dog sits in the middle of the foyer, his tail excitedly swishing back and forth on the white marble, and yaps some more.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Harry deflects, sitting gingerly on the corner of the sofa not taken up by Rose and Hugo’s toy Quidditch team and levitating wooden cubes. There’s a merry fire burning in the hearth across the room. Harry feels simultaneously cold and feverishly hot. “I’m just there all the time, doing my bloody job, as you very well know.” He eyes Ron pointedly. “I’m getting closer to Draco, but that’s what I’m supposed to do in this situation, aren’t I?”
“Fine! Fair enough! As a journalist, I deserve your distrust,” Draco gritted his teeth. “I was a stupid little brat back at Hogwarts. When we were fucking
Scorpius is the best thing that happened to Ernestina. Ernestina is very lucky that Mistor Draco keeps her employed.”
Draco huffs, a sound between laughter and moan. “Yeah, right. As if I can think straight with you doing— ah— what you’re doing now—”
like that,” Harry said, fighting down a chuckle. There was something in Malfoy’s accusations… something almost
The memory of the third member of their trio, who hadn’t survived to live out the past twelve years with them tugs Draco’s heart. He can tell by Greg’s shadowed eyes that he’s thinking about him too.
Ah. Here’s the catch. This is what happens when Harry’s so desperate to prove his friends wrong that he speaks before he thinks. Because… he hasn’t really thought this through, has he? He hasn’t decided how much he wants to reveal about the person he was snogging just a few weeks ago. If he wants to tell them what that person’s name is, or even what their gender is. That will sure as fuck open the pandora box of Ron being awkwardly supportive of Harry’s newfound sexual identity and Hermione bringing him all the books about LGBT history and forcing them down his throat. Maybe even creating a PowerPoint deck to walk him through his own coming out.
“Wha—” Ron asked around his mouthful of sandwich when he noticed Harry staring slack-jawed over his shoulder, a forkful of salad halfway to his mouth. He turned around and simply said, “Oh.”
“Harry,” Draco whispered into Harry’s hair. He conjured lube on his fingers and smeared it between Harry’s arse cheeks and then his own cock. “This is unfair. Why does this feel even better than the first time?”
“Oh?” Ron lifted his eyebrows and bit into his sandwich again. “What, then?” he asked, spraying crumbs across the table.
It was the most amazing, exhilarating, toe-curling, stars-bursting-behind-his-eyes blowjob he’s ever had.
“They’re not my friends," Harry protests. "You know I’ve nothing to do with that shady raid. I would never put you or Scorpius on the line like that. You bloody well know it.”
“Private, my arse,” Lavender shakes her head. “You couldn’t help bragging about your conquests if you tried!”
“I know,” Draco says. He taps his fingers against the leather blotter on his desk. “I understand. I need to find someone to replace you, though. And trust me, that won't be an easy task.”
It’s a slow, exploring kiss. The swell of Malfoy’s lower lip is soft under Harry’s tongue; the angles of Malfoy’s hips, pressing into Harry’s, are shocking and wonderful in their maleness. For a passing second, Harry’s mind rifles through the kisses he’s shared with girls. The mental inventory crumbles to insignificance when Malfoy opens his mouth with a soft moan and lets Harry in. Harry surges in, deepening the kiss. He brings his other hand up to cup the side of Malfoy’s neck, his jaw. He tastes cigarettes and the bitter sweetness of his own come on Malfoy’s tongue, and something melts in his chest, hot and trickling. He could get to his knees for Malfoy in this moment. He could drop to his knees and free the erection he can feel straining against his own and suck Malfoy until he hears him cry—
“Harry,” Draco says after a moment. “I’d prefer things to be simple and straightforward. Of course I would. Merlin, I… Given the circumstances, I don’t see another way.”
Real life's caught up with me... The final chapter of this fic is still in early draft mode and should be ready in a coupld of weeks. Bear with me while I finish writing it, polish it, and deal with everything non-fic-related in the meantime.
“Do you wanna…” Harry asks, trailing off. His eyes are so green and so desperate from this close. His breath is coming out ragged and rushed. And yes. Draco
“I did, and I’m sorry. You were a right bastard at sixteen, but maybe so was I.” Malfoy barely hides his surprise at Harry’s freely provided apology. Harry continues, buoyed by this small success. “And you saved me the year after, and I saved you too, and twelve years later, we’re both alive and well. Let’s call it even, shall we?”
“Are you seriously comparing our situations?” Draco stops, runs a trembling hand through his hair. “You’ve got
He wasn’t sure he wanted to try the spliff again. After that first shared drag, his head had swum a little. He’d found himself giggling and leaning dangerously close to Harry’s shoulder. Eventually, Blaise had pulled him up—”Here you go, big boy”—and had dragged him upstairs to their dorm room. As for kissing Harry Potter...
“You realise this could only be the door to the storage room,” he said. His voice was lower than usual. He sounded like he was trying to avoid waking a sleeping Hungarian Horntail.
Harry grabs Scorpius by the shoulder before he can go closer to the Aurors, and the boy lets out a strangled whine.
Malfoy watches him, eyes wide. If the light weren’t so dim, Harry would think he looked… almost disappointed. “That’s… quite alright, Potter.”
“Luckily, we have plenty of material, see?” Draco picked one of his books and opened it at the page he was interested in, placing it in front of Harry.
I also apologise for going with the criticism first - criticism on things you can’t change, like your face or your accent or those interminable legs of yours. I probably missed a few lines of dialogue at some point, staring at your legs.
The rooms are sunny and light, like the rest of the house. It’s probably a coincidence that Harry has come here during the only two sunny days of January in London. He takes it as a… sign.
“Yes,” Draco said. At Harry’s doubtful expression, he stepped closer. “And no.” He touched his fingers to Harry’s jaw, gently tilting his chin until their eyes met. “Ideally, I would have picked a more romantic spot for our first time back together again. But really, anywhere would do, if I could have you again.”
What hurt more than the pain of the fall was the feeling of five pairs of Gryffindor eyes on him. There had been witnesses to his failure. Draco closed his eyes and thumped his forehead on the unforgiving ice.
“Isn’t it what we’re being paid for? Solving cases?” Harry half-smiled. There was something about Malfoy’s hesitancy that asked for gentleness.
“This is Scorpius’s and Ernestina’s floor,” he tells Harry. “They’re out at the moment, so you can take your time if you want to look around. It’s a rare opportunity — neither of them like having uninvited strangers in their rooms.”
He dropped himself on the other end of the sofa, arms still crossed, eyes on the crackling fire. The fireplace was decked with glittering tinsel and branches of holly. The merry, Christmassy look of it only added to the hurt Draco was feeling.
“Mmh,” Draco tapped his chin with the tips of his fingers. “I don’t know. I could, you know? Give you the ring.”
Ron’s coming closer. Harry feels a cold rise of panic. Malfoy stands then, with a feline grace at odds with his previous posture. He takes Harry’s chin in his hand, and leans in.
Just in time, too: black clouds had veiled the sunshine from moments ago and it was dark as night. The wind was blowing fiercely now, sending a dust of snowflakes flying around them.
Hermione beams at him. “And when I read that Draco’s company had started training its research teams in Muggle medicine and pharmacology… I just had to talk to him. Imagine putting the Unspeakables magical knowledge and Caduceus’ expertise into developing the future of wizarding and Muggle cures!”
Harry comes with his hand clenched around the coat rail and the other fisted in Malfoy’s hair, hips stuttering in helpless, blissful thrusts. Part of him vaguely knows he’s supposed to let go, but he keeps his hand in Malfoy’s hair and fucks until he’s fully spent, until come drips down Malfoy’s chin. When he finally relaxes his grip, Malfoy pulls back. His face is pink, his lips red and raw, a vein popping on his forehead. Harry feels like apologising. Jesus. He got… He got carried away, he should have stopped it, they shouldn’t have… He opens his mouth, but his excuses stay stuck in his throat. Malfoy wipes his chin with the back of his hand, lifts glazed eyes that still feel predatory, and— swallows. A pointed, deliberate gulp, with Malfoy’s smug half-smile as punctuation. In this moment, he looks so much like Malfoy — the version Harry’s always kept in the back of his mind, all these years — a hungry, debauched version of Malfoy, that Harry’s cock gives a treacherous lurch at the sight. Malfoy shifts on his knees, spreading his legs a bit wider. The movement draws Harry’s attention to the bulge tenting Malfoy’s elegant trousers. He lets go of Malfoy’s hair. He moves his hand around, a careful, tentative gesture. He wants to cup Malfoy’s cheek, to run his thumb across those swollen lips—
that skittered across the counter and floors, tickling Draco’s skin. He pulled his pants and jeans back up, then turned.
Coming with a muffled sob, all over the sheets, letting his orgasm tear through him at the sound of Draco’s voice. Letting his breath slow down after, his cheek still resting on Draco’s hip. Draco’s fingers carding through his hair, soothing, lulling him to sleep.
Potter, Caduceus wouldn’t be the company it is today. You don’t build a successful business on ashes.”
From up here, the Atrium looks like an anthill, busy but innocuous — nothing like it does in the nightmares he sometimes still has — and he lets himself relax a fraction.
And more than anything… He’s not sure if he’s ready to tell that, until a few weeks ago, he felt like he might actually start to like Draco Malfoy, even though they’d barely had more than a few half-conversations interspersed with, admittedly, amazing sex.
more,” Draco says, eyeing Harry with an odd mixture of wariness and provocation. Harry’s heart feels full to bursting.
Matilda Vance, formerly known as Matthew (Penelope had bought the biggest champagne bottle she could find when the Ministry had finally let Matilda change her name).
either! This is bigger than us. This is about talking to the public for the first time since the fucking war, Potter! This is about showing people like you, people who went through hell like you, survivors of
“Right,” Auror Boyle says. She opens her mouth, the slight hesitation of those who’ve never had to arrest a house-elf before. When she finally speaks, though, it’s evident she’s at least checked some of her facts. “Ernestina Yolanda Maria Ramirez Granado, you are under arrest for obstructing an investigation and for failure to comply with Auror orders. You are also suspected of participating in a potentially illegal business.”
“Oh.” Malfoy turns his attention to Harry. “I was getting fed up with all the delicious French food, cheese and wine, obviously.”
I sit down. Balzac lies on the rug next to me. Soft fur. Black, white, rust. He looks at me like he has a question. My thumbs trace the velvety edges of the boxes in my pockets. (Dressing gown. One in each pocket.) I pull the boxes out. Place them on top of the other presents, side by side. Dark blue. Matching. (They will wait here, until Daddy and Harry come downstairs. Until they find the boxes, and realise they had the same idea for a surprise.)
“Limping. Looks like his chest still hurts. But he’s with Scorpius now.” Harry watches Draco, the way he still seems to hesitate on the threshold. “How are you? Ernestina?”
Harry thinks with petty satisfaction. He watches Draco as he clenches his fists, then deliberately unclenches them. Takes a deep breath. Looks at Harry with a weary tilt of his brow.
I apologise for waiting by the back door in the hopes of catching a glimpse of you. It wasn’t very polite, or straightforward, especially after you’d asked me to leave you alone. I won’t come again, unless you’re fine with it.
He takes a flute of champagne from the tray proffered by a waiter at the end of the foyer. He wanders from room to room. Hermione was right: the event is small and tasteful, with the exception of the decorations. The organizers removed all the chandeliers of the house and replaced them with giant paper mâché spiders. Harry supposes it all makes sense, given the theme. He’s not sure how Ron will handle it, though. The other guests notice him, move towards him as if to start a conversation. Harry nods, polite but distant, and ends all attempts at socialization by stalking off to a different direction. He’d rather look at the art and the exhibits of the museum than make small talk with wizards he barely knows. That’s Hermione’s strong suit, after all. She’s here to network. Harry’s just here because it got his friend the invitation she desperately wanted.
“I don’t think there’s anything like that,” Harry says at last, so quietly that Draco almost misses it. “It’s only what we do with the cards we were dealt, you know?” He turns his earnest green eyes to Draco, which has the same heart-speeding, breath-stealing effect as always. “And you… you were either dealt a wonderful hand, or a terrible one, depending on how you choose to look at it. I think… when you were younger, you thought you had it brilliant. And then you realised it wasn’t as it seemed, and you worked to change it.” Eyes still fixed on Draco, he lifts his chin as if challenging him to disagree. “Am I wrong?”
“Mufflatio,” Malfoy whispers. Harry doesn’t know if it’s to cast the spell, or to tell Harry it’s already taken care of. At this point, he wouldn’t care even if the whole opera house heard his gasp. Malfoy slides from his seat and sinks to his knees, between Harry’s spread legs. In the darkness, only lit by the spotlights on the stage, his neat white-blond hair forms a halo around his head. He looks like a debauched, fallen angel, about to send Harry to hell — or, more likely, to heaven — and to do so with a ferocious grin on his face.
“I want you,” Harry says between two shallow kisses, “and I’m sorry. I’m sorry if you ever thought—”
“Quite by mistake, and it won’t happen again.” Malfoy frowns as if annoyed by the emotion he gave away. “I was saying, most of my ‘victims’,” he mimes air quotes with a roll of his eyes, “are wealthy arseholes. In the case of Cavendish, an arsehole who knowingly deals with ex-Death Eaters. Most of them have escaped overseas before the Aurors could catch them after Voldemort’s fall, but some of them are still in Britain, safely under the radar — where they were clever enough to stay even at Voldemort’s high point, unlike my power-hungry, cowardly father.”
An ex-Death Eater, my former school nemesis, if that’s not crazy enough. You can imagine how amazingly that would go for both the Saviour of the Wizarding World and the ex-Death Eater in question.”
Harry leaves the bathroom door and walks back into the bedroom, towards Malfoy. “I really like it here, you know.”
“Surely defeating a madman who's tried to kill you since you were born would do that to someone,” Draco muttered, unsettled by the direction the conversation was taking.
“All right, Harry, I’m done bothering you.” She stands straighter and gazes at him thoughtfully. “Ron is perfectly fine with you seeing whomever you like, you know. He’s like me; he trusts you to choose someone who’s good for you.”
“No, it’s not,” Harry says. “But she’s in it with you, if I can’t bring proof to the Ministry that we can solve the case.”
There’s only the sound of the rain falling on the leaves of the cherry trees outside. Inside, the grandfather clock ticks the seconds away with grim finality. All around them, the disaster of the day remains — the upturned unicorn and dragon chair, the parchments everywhere, the ivory keys of the ruined grand piano gleaming on the floor like teeth.
“Mmh,” Draco murmured, rubbing his cheek against Harry’s erection. Lucifer, this felt so good; if Draco wasn’t so focused on his goal, he could have come in his pants just from the feel of it, the smell of it, musky and masculine and
“I’m sorry, Narci—erm, Mrs Malfoy. Hi.” Harry aims for the most normal, casual tone he can muster. “I didn’t know you were visiting.”
Fortunately, the idea didn’t seem too off-putting to her. It was what brought them together the summer before fifth year, when she, in turn, admitted she found the idea of Draco wanking to thoughts of the Chosen One disturbingly hot. She and Draco spent fifth year sneaking into broom cupboards and into each other’s beds. The first time was, retrospectively, disastrous — in the moments when his brain likes to replay the most mortifying moments of his life, Draco still has flashes of it, him coming in Pansy’s hand after three brief pumps of her fist — but they quickly got better at sex the way they did everything else: fast, and determined to be the best. Pansy moved against Draco with the same pent-up anger that he constantly felt for everything and everyone — except her,
one o’clock. A few more hours to go, then he would be free to go back to the office and wrap up the last article of the series. He let them while Dennis set up the equipment for the photoshoot. Dragging his feet, he walked to the kitchen.
“I can definitely see you writing for a living,” Hermione said, “provided you reassess your journalistic integrity. I hardly think we need another Rita Skeeter.”
“Hi, Balzac.” Harry pets the dog’s head, and is rewarded with a big doggy grin and a soft yap. “You didn’t wake Scorpius. Good boy.”
Harry thinks wryly. It’s funny how easily he can spot those who overdo Caduceus’ youth potion after working only a few months for Draco. Not fooled by Harry’s discreet scrutiny, Narcissa lifts an eyebrow. “It’s actually reassuring for a mother to witness the skills of her son’s bodyguard firsthand,” she says. And she then proceeds with giving him a once-over, quick but blatant. Harry blushes hard when her eyes come to a stop on the side of his neck. The largest, purplest of the love bites Draco gave him yesterday is there — he forgot to heal it after his shower, and there’s no way to hide it now. He desperately wants the earth to open beneath his feet and swallow him, especially when Narcissa’s thin lips curl into a knowing, almost-salacious smile. “But now I don’t see why I ever doubted your competence, Mr Potter. It looks like you’re quite…
“Sorry about that,” he apologised with a tight-lipped smile. “Let’s pretend the Prat Who Lived didn’t cut us off. Where were we?”
“Like what you see, don’t you?” he gritted out, though he couldn’t tell who had the hottest view between him and Malfoy.
“We’re really doing this, aren’t we?” Harry asks in a low voice, his eyes on his hand stroking Draco’s skin.
In the distance, someone whooped. Maybe it was Harry. Someone was watching him, then. Bursting with pleasure and pride, Draco raced to the other end of the rink, ready to do another spin. This time he might try to add a jump to it, see if Harry would like it, see if he’d be impressed. He sped forward, head down, visualising the figure he’d try this time. At the last moment, as he neared the end of the rink, just when he was preparing to jump and spin, he looked up.
Harry doesn’t need to be reminded of it. In the months he’s worked as Draco’s bodyguard, he’s never once come across the financial aspects of Draco’s earlier life. He remembers Draco’s desperate whisper in a hospital room —
“I was going to say it’s a calamity.” He’d corrected Potter for old times’ sake, though his heart wasn’t in it. Potter’s hand was strong and firm and enclosed Draco’s narrow palm and long fingers almost entirely. Hot tingles sparked in Draco’s belly. He dropped Potter’s hand, embarrassed by his body’s eager betrayal. “I’d been thinking that if I never saw your face again, it would be too soon.” Which was a big fat lie, as his browser history could attest.
“What are you talking about?” Harry forces his voice not to tremble. His entire body seems to have frozen on the spot, rooted to the carpet underneath his clenched fists. “Draco… you weren’t weak. You weren’t
It was also, reportedly, the first time these four had ever agreed on anything. It might have been the reason why McGonagall had given in, more so than their stubbornness. What better example of House unity was there than two former Gryffindors and two former Slytherins organizing a sit-in to get something they all wanted?
“Nice repartee, Malfoy.” Harry put his hands on his hips, looking smug. “Or are you just bitter after Luna called you out on your question?”
Malfoy lifts his head. “I will,” he says. He shuffles to the side of the bed and turns to his side, like he’s putting an end to this conversation.
He felt Malfoy lift his body off his and heard the muffled yet frantic rustle of clothing being removed. Then Malfoy’s hands were on him again, pulling at his uniform, helping him out of his cloak, his robes, his shirt. In the pale light of the
“It’s Harry.”Harry stands still, careful to keep his tone neutral. He pats his pocket once more and closes his jacket over it, just to be safe.
“My prick is about to fall off from the vigorous treatment you submitted it to, Potter,” he heard Malfoy say behind him, “but maybe I can give it a try.”
The song Harry and Draco dance to isn't mentioned, but I like to think Ernestina is a fan of good old Spanish classics, so you can give my fave
“Hello, Mephisto.” He schooled his features into a practiced bored look. This never failed to annoy his demonic tutor. He lifted the piece of red parchment streaked with a scribble in blood-red ink:
He touched his lips to the tip, feeling the silky skin and the wetness underneath the cotton, and Harry’s legs trembled.
to Draco was only making matters worse. “I did change my mind.” He swallowed, surprised by the painful truth of his next statement. “I want to be better.”
“You’ve already been here — the parlour, a waiting room for my personal appointments,” Malfoy tells him, gesturing towards the beautiful sunlit room that was Harry’s first impression of the house. The vase on the table has been refilled with a fresh white hydrangea. “Otherwise, most of my professional meetings take place in my office at Caduceus. You’ll notice a lot of people coming and going into Caduceus in the next few months. Financial auditors from the Ministry. However…
“They’re all right,” Harry said, “especially on you,” before reaching around Draco’s neck and kissing him again.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “There are several leads pointing to Ben Macdui. It would be preposterous to overlook them and you know it.” It was his turn to flash Harry his best deathly glower. “Or do you?”
“Fuck,” he heard Malfoy whisper when they broke for air. He was immediately back at it, kissing Harry with a desperation unlike Harry had ever experienced with any other lover, hands everywhere, in his hair, on his neck, his arms, his back, pushing his hips into Harry’s, rutting into him. Harry broke the kiss with a cry and Malfoy latched on his neck instead, sucking and lapping at his pulse point. His hand slid down Harry’s side, searching under his Auror robes for the button of his trousers. “Fuck,” he said again, “fuck, Potter, I want you, I want you so damn much—”
“—Malfoy worked at the Ministry? Yeah, mate, he just started,” Ron told him. “My dad found out last week. Penelope Clearwater hired him.”
Malfoy’s head rests on Harry’s shoulder. Harry slowly reaches up and threads his fingers through Malfoy’s fine hair. Malfoy lets out a long exhale against Harry’s collarbone. “Merlin, no wonder you’re so fucked up. And you asked me why I was scared.”
Up until two days ago, I thought you’d never worked a day in your life. Not that I care what you do with your life,” he hastens to add, “but it sounds like something the Daily Prophet would have picked up on, doesn’t it?”
And then he didn’t think of anything else, because Malfoy stood and pulled his boxers down. His cock, pale and pink and just as big as Harry’s for all he could judge in the semi-darkness, stood proud and fully erect, a long, beautiful vein throbbing on the side.
