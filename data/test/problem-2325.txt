“Death Eaters! Voldemort, and I’m sure the list continues. We’re not going to be friends. There’s no way it would work.”
He’d taken Longbottom back to his flat and they’d shagged into the wee hours of the morning.
Harry was struck by the sheer politeness in Malfoy’s voice. He eagerly handed the document over, taking a seat across the desk from the blonde and wringing his hands together. Harry had had no idea Malfoy had gotten a job at Gringott’s, though, he admitted, he hadn’t really kept tabs on the bloke after they were free from the shared dorm at Hogwarts. Harry and Malfoy went their separate ways and had barely crossed paths since. Harry recalled only one or two times where he saw that white blonde hair disappearing behind a corner in Diagon Alley, but other than that he’d practically been a ghost in society.
“It’s nice to see that your hero complex hasn’t faded over the years,” someone said behind him. He turned to see Malfoy leaning against the outside wall of the locker room. The sunlight was so bright that Harry had to squint to see his face. All he wore was an old t-shirt and some fancy, dark wash jeans that accentuated how long his legs were.
He pulled open the basket and pulled out the thermos of tea and a baggie of biscuits. He also grabbed a small plate and a teacup before turning the basket over and using the top as a makeshift table. He wanted this to be as formal as possible. He poured the tea, added a cube of sugar, and stirred.
He wordlessly handed her the glowing deed, deeply wishing that if he leaned back far enough, the couch would swallow him whole. Hermione scanned the page quickly before her eyes shot up to his and she sank down on the sofa next to him. “Oh, Harry…” Her hand reached out to grip his forearm, nothing more than a comforting gesture that he appreciated. “Did you go see it?”
He sensed Potter walking up behind him and felt a light touch on his elbow. “I wouldn’t miss it,” he said quietly, his fingers slipping down Draco’s forearm and then squeezing his hand lightly. “I’m going to go chat with Ron in his office.”
Potter’s face turned sour for the briefest of moments before he spoke again. “You’re flirting.”
Harry’s cheeks burned, and he felt a wave of embarrassment wash over him as he slowly nodded. He couldn’t believe he was twenty-three and still couldn’t make any big steps without his best friends by his side. He was scared of what he’d find at the property. Maybe he’d find portraits of his relatives. Maybe his dad still had a bedroom there, littered with quidditch magazines and school supplies. Or maybe it’d be empty. Harry couldn’t tell which he feared more—finding bits and pieces of his parents and other relatives’ lives, or finding nothing.
“Oops,” Harry automatically said as two pairs of eyes turned to him. The woman instantly recognized him, he could tell. Her expression moved from shocked to excited and then to something else that made him a little uncomfortable. “Uh...I’ll come back later, I think.”
and Harry resigned himself to complete his tasks for the day.
“But it helps me sleep,” Harry whined. His head tilted back and he adjusted the arm around Draco so he could continue reading. “’She felt the touch of his tongue. Opening to him, she drew him deeper, hesitantly using her own tongue in a slide of silk-on-silk…’ Merlin, keep doing that.” Harry paused, eyes closing briefly as he felt the soft sucking of Draco’s lips on his neck, the light scraping of teeth. His free hand curled in Draco’s hair and tugged.
The group cheered after Thomas spoke, watching Draco. Thomas placed Draco’s glass back in his hands and grabbed onto Draco’s shoulders, giving him a light shake. “Listen, mate. Listen, you can do this. You were—” Thomas paused to belch off to the side, laughing. “You were a great Quidditch player, just don’t knock it down. That’s the rule.”
“Nope,” he once again replied. “I kissed him and it opened.”
“Interesting,” Malfoy simply said, giving Harry a calculated look. “Did you try asking it to let you in?”
“It’s okay,” Harry replied quickly, “it’s not your fault.” Bippy wiped her tears away, sniffling.
Harry felt a shiver climbing slowly up his spine, as if it possessed legs that propelled itself using every bone as another step. He didn’t like when people vowed to protect him. Especially considering many of those that did died at some point in the war, and considering a vicious enemy had been looming over their heads, overpowering them for years and it seemed as if only Dumbledore’s protection was effective enough. Though that hadn’t lasted nearly long enough. But something about Draco’s words made him feel more safe than he ever had, even when he’d been staying at the Burrow.
Harry had been distraught when he arrived at the gate on Tuesday, after opening the gate the day before, just to see that the fog had returned and there was no sign of that luscious green grass that had appeared. It looked the same as it had since he’d discovered it, but he found as soon as he touched the gate, the fog again dissipated and the plants grew more colorful. He’d wondered if the mist and the abandoned look were just for the manor’s defense.
Potter didn’t seem interested in him in the least, despite Draco’s attempts to not only flirt, but also make Potter jealous. Draco had to do the only thing he could think of to get Potter to look at him as something more than just the bullying kid he used to be. Merlin, did he really have to do this?
Hermione corrected, “Razor
“How come it won’t open? I’m supposed to be the owner, right?”
The Weasleys had some general inquiries about Harry’s house, now they all knew he’d been inside, but quickly moved on to Ginny’s most recent accomplishment- reserve seeker for the Holyhead Harpies. Harry briefly wondered if there would be a Sunday dinner at the Burrow in which one of them did not have some sort of announcement and celebration. Indeed, just last week Molly had announced that her carrot crop was ready to be harvested and Arthur broke out a bottle of mead just for that. He couldn’t blame them; they had many things to be proud of, especially their children.
But then, he thought, visibly deflating, how is it possible that his parents came out of Voldemort’s wand, back in fourth year? How were they resurrected by the stone during the Battle? Harry wanted to yell out in frustration and pain, but only shot the ground a glare and, with one last look at the dark building beyond the iron bars, he apparated home.
The sunlight grew more intense, warming his face and making Draco see red behind his eyelids. He rolled over, burying his face under the covers, drifting back to sleep.
“Watch where you’re pointing that, if you don’t mind.” The familiar voice spoke again, not even approaching the bed so Harry could actually see him.
Suddenly, Harry snorted. Draco moved his book so he could see Harry’s fave. The green eyes were alight with amusement and he had a shit-eating grin on his face.
When he’d heard Hermione enter, he adjusted his posture, pulling his leg off the back of the couch and sitting up. “Hey,” he greeted her as she bustled around, setting down her bag and taking off her traveling cloak. “Did you just get off shift?”
Harry stood up quickly, his eyebrows rose as he watched the fog on the grounds clear. He could actually see the gargantuan size of the house and entire property now, and he was blown away. It was five times bigger than he initially thought. There was clearly an extension charm on the inside of the gate, because when Harry peeked his head around the corner, he couldn’t see the end of the yard, but when he stood outside the gate, it was only several metres wide.
He felt a hand rest on the small of his back, comforting.
He pressed his back to the gate and slid down into a sit at its base, setting the basket of tea next to him. He took a moment to just feel the air around the grounds. He sensed a sadness, but could not decipher whether it was the house or himself.
“It’s not unheard of. A magical residence needs care and nurturing just as much as its residents do. If things fall apart, they need to be fixed. If it's abandoned for a certain amount of time, like more than twenty years, it needs to trust you before you can enter. Read that,” he gestured to Harry’s hand, “and try those tips.”
“So-” Draco started at the same time, facing Harry when he heard him speak as well. Harry gave him a smile to signal he could speak first. “I wanted to let you know that my mother has been my best friend for my whole life and I have never kept a secret from her, and I do not want to start. With your permission, I’d like to tell her about us.” He sounded incredibly formal, as if he were speaking to a colleague about some files that needed transferred.
“Thank you,” Harry quietly said, making the elf curtsy again. “Bippy, could you tell me how long the house has looked like this?”
“Thanks, mate,” he said, slipping the canister into his pocket. “Maybe one day you’ll let me pay for it.”
“Lunch then,” Harry confirmed, fingers pulling softly at the hairs at the nape of Draco’s neck.
“Potter, can you really blame me for all that?”
, right? I know all about you, Malfoy. Donating just enough money to make people think you’re a changed person, even living in Muggle London, paying your elves. And you know what’s worse? I believed it all, at first. I thought you were a better person, going to become someone with honour. I even…” Potter used his thumb and forefinger to rub at his eyes, not quite chuckling, “I even fancied you at one point.”
Around a year ago, Harry had joined a minor league quidditch team. He had missed being on his broom during that last year of school, since eighth years weren’t able to join their house teams. He now had matches almost every Saturday during the season. He had bought himself another Firebolt for this purpose, despite newer models arriving in stores.
of drinks,” he pointedly emphasised, “but there’s too much in our past that I just can’t set aside. We don’t like each other, and we never have.”
“Actually,” Potter began in a hushed, warning voice, throwing several Galleons on the table without so much as a glance at the check, “I was thinking more along the lines of me hexing your bollocks off.”
Harry sat up. “In love with- I’m not in love with him!” A light flashed through the room from the window and soon after Harry heard the patter of raindrops on the glass. Ginny just stared at him, expectantly, with an eyebrow raised. “I’m not!” Harry insisted. “Alright, I like him. I don’t know about
“I think we’ve earned it,” Draco justified as they walked down the path back towards that gate. Harry had trouble pulling it closed; not because the gate wouldn’t close, but because part of him was certain that he couldn’t open it back up again. After a little convincing from Draco, they apparated to the Leaky Cauldron.
Draco leaned in for a proper kiss despite both of their lack of brushed teeth, hands splayed on Harry’s waist. When they pulled apart, Draco’s eyes glanced past Harry’s head before returning. “You know your elf has been watching us this whole time,” he informed, a lazy smirk appearing and making Harry weak in the knees.
“Merlin, what’s got into those people?” he inquired while taking the seat opposite Neville’s desk. The other man was looking quite frazzled himself, typing away on a muggle calculator.
They made their way up the path, taking their time and admiring the views. Harry was grateful for his best friends, allowing him to take it slow. The closer they got to the front door, the more his palms sweat, the harder his jaw clenched. Before he knew it, they were standing there, on the stoop, and he was reaching for the handle. He gripped it firmly and turned his wrist.
Harry slid a hand through his hair several times. He wanted to run, run as fast and far as he could until his lungs were fighting for air and he couldn’t go any further. But Harry had never really been that kind of person. Gryffindor blood rushed through his veins and kept him rooted to the spot, awaiting a house elf he’d never met before.
charm considering how loud the music was. Both Draco and Potter turned to look, and Potter immediately smiled and waved at whoever had called over to him. Draco turned back to stare at Potter, waiting for him to return to their conversation, but Potter, it seemed, was not nearly as interested as Draco wished he was. Mere seconds later, Potter had his coat slung over his arm.
Malfoy held his hand out. “May I?”
Draco folded his book closed, slipping it back where it belonged. He ordered another drink, draining his current one and sliding the glass across the counter to indicate he was done.
“Do you really think I’m that thick, Malfoy? You actually think I would go to
“I’ve never—I mean, who does it—uh…where?” Harry asks stupidly, utterly flabbergasted by Malfoy’s piercing gaze. Something unnerved him about the blonde, but he couldn’t tell if it was something as a result of their going-on-twelve-years animosity or something completely different.
“Merlin, you’re such a prick,” Potter muttered, tugging Draco down on top of him and connecting their lips once more. Draco pressed his hips down against Potter’s, feeling one of Potter’s legs wrap around him. Potter’s tongue wedged its way between Draco’s lips, tasting Draco’s own.
“What are you doing?” Potter asked, setting his glass, heavy with Firewhisky, down with an audible thump and turning to look at Draco expectantly.
“Mm,” he grumbled, muffled by the chair in his face, “soft.” Harry barked out a laugh in response, probably too loud for the situation and pretty much unwarranted as what Draco had said wasn’t even funny. He lightly wrapped his hand around Draco’s ankle, not pulling or gripping, just feeling. The soft hairs caressed his fingers as his thumb moved to trace circles around Draco’s ankle bone.
Draco suddenly grabbed Potter’s wrist, pulling him close and Apparating them both before Potter had any chance to protest.
Draco had half a mind to stay right there, Potter’s hand on his prick bringing him off. But he needed more, he wanted to get closer.
“That is an interesting, and false, accusation.”
Harry wondered what those legs would look like without any trousers, and then shook his head. He couldn’t help that Malfoy was such a distraction lately, but he had to focus. Though at the moment, he couldn’t quite remember what he was supposed to be focusing on.
“Malfoy,” Ron clarified with a quiet sigh. He handed Harry another screw when he moved to grab one.
“Can I open my presents now?” Teddy pleaded, his bottom lip protruding dramatically. Harry nearly rolled his eyes.
“How can I help you, Mister Potter?” Malfoy began. Harry held himself back from snorting. Never in his life did he imagine Draco Malfoy calling him
The man below him squirmed, only releasing whimpering or choked-off moans when he couldn’t hold his breath any longer. He understood them, their desires. Most of them just wanted the experience; to be fucked by Draco Malfoy, the most prominent Slytherin they knew. They didn’t want word to spread around, even though it was whispered in private conversations, under silencing spells, and written on parchment attached to an owl’s leg. He didn’t mind. He knew he was a good shag. If word spread, it only helped him.
Rosita’s was a crowded restaurant, yet the noise level was so low Draco surmised that nearly every table was under a
, and continuing, “seven in the morning?”
“No, thank you. I really should be getting home.” Malfoy interrupted. Harry nodded and watched as the other man stepped onto the apparition spot and disappeared with a crack. He sighed and followed suit, coming to a stop in the middle of his living room and trekking up to the bathroom.
“Don’t want to snog in the moonlight?”
“In the garden, playing with his little friends.”
“Why would I want to hex you?”
It took him a minute to realise that he still had some heat in his groin, what was he thinking about before?
Draco couldn’t hold back the whimper that slipped from his wet lips, his bottom lip grasped harshly between teeth as he bit down. Pain flooded his senses but only succeeded in mixing into the pleasure and causing his cock to rise some more, he was fucked. It was soon gonna be difficult to hide it. Draco felt mortified as he remembered the noise that had slipped out of his mouth, his chest rising and falling more rapidly than it had all night.
A slick finger slid into Draco’s warm heat, barely giving him any time to adjust. The moan that was pulled from the boy told Harry everything he needed to know, he was loving it.
“Such a slut.”
Harry’s hands were ever so slowly getting tighter in the blonde’s hair, the wet heat starting to surround his hard on filling him with pleasure.
“Draco?” Harry stepped closer, his eyes dropping down to his mouth.
The jeans were incredibly, no, ridiculously tight. At first he had thought Pansy had picked the wrong side when she had informed him that it was just how they were, he had disliked them at first. Not really comfortable, that didn’t last for long though. Considering he had an awesome best friend who loved to hype him up, sharing her confidence in him and making him gradually less and less self conscious. He really did appreciate and love Pansy.
When he felt the mattress dipping, he had no choice. He shifted his eyes to see that Harry was now sitting on the edge of the side of the bed, twisting his body to look at the shivering blonde.
Now that Harry’s hand was off his cock, there was nothing between Draco’s eyes and him. Since he first saw it he knew but his brain was only just processing how big the other truly was, he couldn’t help but gape again.
He hadn’t meant to say it loud, his intention was for only Ron to hear. That didn’t happen, goddamn for him not realising how loud his voice was. He should know how to whisper after all this time.
Harry had taken the hand, that wrapped around his base, off. Draco wiped the spit that had trailed down his chin. He returned his hand to Potter’s other thigh, feeling a lot more stable now he was gripping both. He felt ready for more, he regained eye contact in hopes that he would be understood - he was.
“No! I’m just really fucking horny, god fucking damnit!” His voice was dark and raucous, the tone made Draco jump as he felt his heartbeat decrease slightly now that he knew Voldemort wouldn’t be paying a visit - his heart still hammered though, purely from Harry’s voice.
“The size of my dick is common knowledge?” Harry’s voice was a little raspy as he pulled a curious face, looking at his friends intently.
“Harry!” Hermione both yelled at his words and actions whilst the other half of her was just incredibly amused at the same time.
During this time, Ron had pulled out a chocolate bar from his robes. That earned him a disgusted noise from his sister as he unwrapped the bar as quietly as he could.
Harry groaned in realisation that he’d just said those words out loud as he let his head fall forward, for the umpteenth time today, and banging it onto the table.
He was ever so grateful for Harry, he had been there at his trial - testifying against him. This was back before Draco had realised he really wanted to be fucked by him and they were still “enemies”, that day felt different though.
Potter then leaned back down to his neck, wasting no time as he began sucking and biting the unmarked patches of his snowflake skin. He took grave enjoyment in knowing that Draco wouldn’t be able to cover these up, he’d be forced to have everyone know that he belonged to Harry.
His eyes were on Draco’s in a millisecond, he watched as his eyes looked down to his mouth - at the expression he had. It only made his smirk more powerful as he noted the way Draco’s adam’s apple moved in as he gulped.
“Yeah, thanks.” The small talk between them wasn’t awkward, it was strangely comfortable. Draco felt safe in there with Harry and he must’ve let it show on his face, Harry wasn’t grinning enticingly at him - not yet anyway - but smiling softly at him. It was nice.
“-like a fun night.” George finished.
“-make your head hurt?” George finished. They both wiggled their auburn eyebrows at him.
He noticed how his “enemy” muttered some words back to them before instantly breaking away from their eyes and continued to look at Draco.
He then forced his attention away in order to focus on not spilling the damn drink, he reached over and grabbed the glass. It was bitter against his fingers, a welcomed cold when compared to the heat of his body.
He knew he’d been told a command, that thought alone made his stomach swirl, but he just couldn’t look away. He wanted to make sure he wasn’t actually drooling as the outline of Potter’s cock strained heavily against his black jeans. Pushing so hard against the seams that Draco was surprised they hadn’t ripped from the pure amount of force against them, another shiver wracked his body.
“Hermione and Ron, the way you care for your friends is wonderful. It’s very nice to see your support and how you’ve grown together.” He flashed them all a genuine smile, they couldn’t help the slight happiness they felt.
After towelling himself dry, he stood bare arsed naked in front of his wardrobe - pondering what the fuck he was going to choose. He didn’t want it to seem like he was trying to look good but he did want to look good, Pansy would come in very handy at a time like this. She always knew what looked good on him, he was on his own this time.
If the man could do this to himself and be completely fine, what the fuck was he gonna do to tease Draco. The thought made him squirm, he knew that Potter was going to make him suffer in the best way.
“Ohh, you wouldn’t believe it. So many visuals going through my damn fucking head.”
The words that eased so teasingly and derisively in a way that made Draco’s “tough” exterior crumble to pieces, he was so easily taken apart by his rival and it made his skin itch with a desperate need.
Only after he gave the finished potion to Pansy, who was the one appointed to sneak it into Potter’s drink, had he realised his error. He explained his mistake nervously to the rest of his friends, just as Pansy walked back through the door to explain that she had been successful in her task.
“Amazing.” The twins replied.
Draco looked down for a moment, a small smile on his lips. Harry noticed and couldn’t help but smile too, even when he was literally stroking his dick. It filled him with glee that he had just made the other smile like that, made him feel good. He would be making him feel good every second from this day on, both sexually and emotionally.
Draco’s voice was scratchy and croaky, completely fucking wrecked. Harry revelled in the fact that he had been the one to cause it, it was incredibly pleasing to him. It was taking everything inside of him to not just fuck the boy up against the wall, purely from how wrecked his voice was - he quickly decided that what he had planned was infinitely better. Harry’s reaction was immediate.
In, out. In, out. In, out.
Draco had instantly scowled, he wasn’t adorable. The expression had lasted about 5 seconds, as soon as their gazes collided his face fell - leaving no more than a slight pout on his lips.
“Back to the story then.” George muffled out through a mouth full of chocolate, Ginny lightly punched his arm.
“Turn around.”
“I’ll tell you when he’s out.” The twins nodded, even though they were definitely not the most patient - they knew that it’d be worth it.
A pro and a con was that the potion gave the ability to be incredibly imaginative, any thoughts were turned into something crystal clear and visual. Like watching a movie but just made from horny thoughts, also distracting but Harry couldn’t help but let himself get sucked in.
“I like it, it’s really relaxing and warm.” The blonde allowed himself to look up at the ceiling, it was seemingly bewitched to match the weather just like the Great Hall. It was extremely comforting, the ceiling was tall and at the highest point the colour was a captivating blue with “stars” distributed amongst them.
“Huge boner?” Pansy pointed out, forcing herself to giggle faintly. The last thing she wanted was to expose what they had done just because she couldn’t keep a laugh in.
A glass then broke on the table, well, not broke. A glass then shattered on the table, quickly forming into tens of thousands of tiny little pieces. It was no longer glass shards, just dust that now covered part of the table. The poor cup had been eviscerated, to put it simply.
hope you enjoyed! the next upcoming chapters are leading up to some smutty shit so if you're here for that then you're in luck lmao, hope i can make it decent enough lol. also when all chapters have been posted i will then be going through the whole thing to check for grammar, i've gone through it a little and have run it through a grammar thing but if you a mistake i'll eventually be going through it (i'll stop babbling now) :)
Draco looked mortified and Harry thrived off of it, the boy still hadn’t looked up to him. He knew why, he was scared.
“Jesus ‘Mione, he’s boiling!” Harry made a noise of gratitude at the cold temperature of Ron’s hand against the heat of his forehead, Ron just felt bad. All jokes and teasing left his mind, his only objective now was to make Harry feel at least a little better.
“-not surprising.” George finished, his cheeky grin matching his twins’.
“You finish that sentence.”
Draco pulled them from his wardrobe and tossed them on the bed, he hung his discarded uniform up as it wasn’t dirty at all. Now he just had to find a shirt, this is where he could definitely use Pansy’s help.
“Welcome back.” He could hear the grin in Ron’s voice as his friend patted him on the shoulder, he already knew what had happened.
“So, Malfoy, I have a question for you.”
“Oh my god, Harry.” Her eyes sparkled, igniting the curiosity in Harry. As he gave her a questioning gaze, hoping the look explained his question.
“Harry, remember. I know with this potion you lose your very well kept control, but you know you have a hold on your magic. Remind yourself of that.”
“That was adorable, Malfoy.”
Hermione tried to ward the small grin off of her lips, the memories of Harry explaining those imaginative scenarios to her, Ron and Ginny flooding her mind unhelpfully.
Draco gulped audibly, feeling like the breath had been stolen from his lungs - Harry chuckled deeply.
“R-Rough, please.”
“We’ve never seen you like that before, it was so entrancing to watch.” Their laughing settled down as Pansy explained, mouth open a little to show her astonishment.
Harry came to a decision in his head, he’d been standing up for way too long and his legs were beginning to go numb. It didn’t help either when he was still experiencing shocks of pleasure every couple minutes. It was finally time.
Then he felt it, the last particle of self control imploding into nothing. Harry opened his now, even darker, eyes. Settling them on the ones responsible for making him feel like this before dragging them back to his friends, he could see their slightly unnerved expressions.
“Malfoy.”
He sent a look of ‘I’m sorry’ before quickly looking back to the Gryffindor to try and figure out his feelings by his facial expressions, he realised that it was impossible. Potter always had a way of masking what he truly felt, making himself unreadable. And that was unnerving.
Harry couldn’t help the look of sympathy on his face, his heart ached at the thought. The Dursley’s and Lucius must’ve shared some traits, just slightly different.
“Touché.” Ron slanted his finger towards Harry as he spoke whilst the twins’ curiosity got the best of them.
All he wanted to do was slam Malfoy up against the wall and fuck his brains out. And it was taking everything inside of him not to do it, he felt his hands shaking as they rested by his sides from the pure effort he was using into not giving in to his horny desires.
All 5 of them couldn’t but softly smile at his words, it was rare that Snape opened up or even just complimented them. Spoke nicely, it was very reassuring and just nice.
Harry shoved his fingers inside of the open fabric, wrapping his fingers around the flesh of his thighs and digging in roughly.
“Oh yeah! That’s how he made sure of his sexuality.” Ginny rolled her eyes at how her brothers’ interest peaked up at the conversation, she was about to fill them in before Hermione decided to relieve her of the responsibility.
Draco took the scrolls from his professor’s pale hands and groaned inwardly, why didn’t he just complete it earlier like everyone else.
“Answer the question then, little brother. How can being horny-“ Fred started.
“We’ll explain more about the fantasies later, we’re a bit ahead in the story.” Ron explained as if he were telling a fairy tale, not sex fantasies that his best friend spewed out to him in a horny rant.
He had once again, began to choke on it. It didn’t take him long to adjust to the cock that was practically fucking down into his oesophagus, it may sound dramatic but it's definitely how it felt.
He made his way to his broad shoulders, still hesitating to make the final leap to eye contact. He knew it was because the probable dark gaze that would shoot straight back into his own, assessing his damn soul, he’d lose the control he’d shakily attempted to build.
“Gis' us some.” Fred spoke and the other raised his eyebrows, a silent plea for him to share. Begrudgingly, Ron broke off a couple pieces and handed them to his brothers. He rolled his eyes at the pleased sound they both let out. Before he decided to inhale it all by himself, he silently offered the rest some - secretly glad when they politely declined.
Draco knew that the next day he would probably find bruises of Harry’s fingertips from how harshly he was holding him. He also couldn’t help but let his mind wander that bruises of the other’s fingertips would be left after being fucked by him, the thought made his body quiver.
Draco’s mind was swarmed with thoughts, he couldn’t stop asking himself what punishment he’d be getting. He had a feeling that it wouldn’t be a punishment like detention, the thought scared him and intrigued him.
His glanced feverishly across his surroundings, feeling reality kicking in. It took him a little while to really come back down to earth, he tried to ignore the part of himself that was aching to go back to visualising.
“N-No.” Draco’s voice was slightly raspy, absolutely nowhere near the level that Harry’s was, no. There was something about the other’s voice that made his body tense up in pure fear as pleasure constricted around him like a snake of arousal, it made his thighs tingle at his power.
The bone-chilling chuckle that Harry let out had Draco whining needily, he’d already been reduced to such a mess - just from the other.
“Good, you’re doing so good, Draco.”
“With our bets, we do rock paper scissors. Whoever wins gets to flip the coin first, whichever it lands on then belongs to that person. We flip the coin again and whichever it lands on, that person gets to choose. So I got heads and Fred got tails, when the coin was flipped it landed on heads. Due to our rules, I picked my answer first and Fred got the one that was left. I said yes, Harry was a good kisser and Fred got stuck with no. So, now I have 5 galleons.”
Harry took looked down at Draco’s body, noticing that he no longer had a boner. He was curious to know whether had he had obeyed him or not, grey eyes followed his gaze.
Every so often, the books that he had held tightly against his crotch to hide his arousal from showing, would rub against his still hard prick. He had to bite back the groan of pleasure that wanted to rip its way out his mouth, his walk getting increasingly faster. It took everything inside of him not to start full on running, he knew that it’d look to suspicious and weird though.
“I don’t think I can face him, or them. Even if it is me that he smells, what if everybody makes fun.” Hermione couldn’t hide the sympathy from her face.
“On the bed, right now.” Potter’s voice was low and sadistic sounding, fuck if Draco was going to disobey.
“Actually, nevermind. Fuck doing nothing.” He swung his leg over the bench, alerting his friends of what he was about to do.
“Already soaked your jeans, just from getting your throat fucked.”
“Sorry Professor, just letting them know.”
“So pretty. Open your legs wider for me, sweetheart.”
“W-What do y-you want, P-Potter?”
Hermione’s hand shot up, temporarily distracting everybody for a moment. Snape nodded towards her, a way of silently saying ‘yes’. Nobody would’ve thought Snape’s behaviour would change in this way, now they were sixth years - he showed more affection. Kinda. Very rarely, the class still appreciated it.
Draco felt dizzy from the amount of blood that was still rushing down to his lower half, however, the blush on his cheeks still remained - the burning of them reminded him of it.
Harry felt himself starting to sweat as he made his way to where his friends were sat, slamming his books down on the table - more harshly than he intended too. He felt slight guilt pang in his stomach at how his friends had jumped, it faded when he saw them quickly look down and get back to whatever they were doing.
“After seeing you two about grinding on each other, it shocked me when you told me you liked me.”
He tried to distract himself from the other’s highly arousing words, reverting to his slightly argumentative persona to stop himself from growing hard too soon. His body was way too sensitive from not having cum earlier.
“Yeah, I know.”
“I think your skin would look divine in lace, pretty baby. I’ll just have to put you in some next time.”
A large and warm hand then made its way to the other side of Draco’s neck, a possessive hold as Harry let his tongue lick in an upwards motion. He then slid his hand up to his cheek before he bit down, Draco’s jaw went slack as an unintentional moan attempted to make its way out of his now agape mouth. Potter’s hand was covering his mouth in an instinct, muffling the noise before it escaped into the air.
The addition she had added was a few extra cuts right at the thigh, asymmetrical on either side. Draco had to admit, they did look good.
The words that flooded out of Harry’s mouth next did not fucking mean too.
Harry’s friends had never seen him act so confident before, seeming so naturally dominant. Maybe it was because they had never seen him with an actual love interest before, nevertheless, they couldn’t take their eyes away.
“How many times have you worn these?” Harry’s voice was controlled and confident, everything that Draco’s was not.
Gradually, Harry started gaining speed with his thrusts. Hitting the back of his throat and making him choke before allowing himself to slide down Draco’s welcoming throat, constricting every so often around him.
“If you don’t want this, tell me. We can forget all about it, it’s fine, I will not hold it against you.” Draco wanted to interrupt and explain how much he wanted whatever was going to happen, to happen. He didn’t get the chance as Potter continued speaking.
“Don’t speak with your mouth open! It’s gross.” Their sister grimaced as she scolded him, Fred cackled - also with a mouth full.
By the time he finally reached the door, he was out of breath and had a hand against the wall for stability. The other still covering his crotch with his books, not trusting anyone not to see him. His eyes had closed to purely focus on getting his breathing semi normal, counting his breaths inside his head.
“-Parkinson and Malfoy, please stay behind.” Harry gulped. The remaining class stared at them all, a fog like whisper hitting the rest like waves. Unable to do anything but discuss what the fuck had just happened.
“Cockslut.” Harry muttered out the words but from the glowing blush on Malfoy’s cheeks - which seemed to have taken a permanent residency there - he knew he’d been heard.
He’d been so lost in his thoughts the he’d barely noticed that Harry had reached into his jacket pocket before pulling out his wand, placing Draco’s cloak back over the top of it.
His words were not a question, they was a statement. A demand almost, Draco wanted to sob at how they filled his body with arousing warmth - he could tell it wasn’t gonna be long until his body started to physically show it.
Harry was squeezing his hands into fists, trying to do anything to distract his mind from the downright sin that was flowing through it. He felt himself slowly starting to lose control, he could feel it.
“No, no. I mean, they’ve ripped but they aren’t ruined. They’re even fucking better, oh my god!” Pansy’s voice sounded giddy, suspiciously so. He had no idea what the girl was talking about, he furrowed his eyebrows as he turned around to look at her - a grin had appeared on her lips.
Draco knew that he was being riled up, he was aware of it. He just couldn’t resist it, the growing smirk on Potter’s face only made it worse.
His eyes fluttered as he tried to maintain the eye contact, his body convulsing in his own pleasure. He focused on breathing through his nose, in and out, in and out…
Harry turned the key, quickly pulling him inside and shutting the door. Actually turning on the light this time instead of using his wand. As soon as the door shut, Draco dropped his bag to the floor - as did Harry. Neither knowing who was gonna find the courage to speak first.
His legs were still a little numb but before he got a chance to try speak some shaky words, he was being guided to a chair. He graciously sat down on it as Harry sat on one directly across from him, hands still in the exact same place.
He was sitting oh so perfectly in the v of them, he gulped - closing his eyes so tight that his vision became a whirlpool of swirls and made up patterns as he braced himself for what he was about to see and hopefully not beg to get fucked.
He let his gaze drop again, feeling too weak to look at the way Potter’s eyes burned through him.
Harry’s tone was low and dangerous as he leaned in and licked a stripe up Draco’s neck, not biting just yet but nipping ever so lightly. He had been thinking about this for years, he was going to take his sweet time whilst teasing him. The blonde’s frame shook, pressing his lips together in an attempt to stop the whimpers from falling from his mouth.
He let his jaw go slack, knowing he’d need too. Harry pushed his hips forward slowly, pushing his head into that pretty mouth.
The first thing he caught sight of was those pale and light blue, practically grey eyes that were shining up at him. Flickering from reciprocating the eye contact and back down. Harry didn’t understand at first until he too flicked his gaze down, realising that the boy was staring at his bulge.
“You okay?” Hermione asked, her voice now soft and concern lacing her tone. This caught Ron’s attention as he looked over at his best friend and grimaced a little, noticing the sweat dripping from him. He, carefully, placed a hand on his forehead.
Potter’s lips pulled up into an almost taunting grin, he really did not want to see the look in his eyes - for good reason too. As soon as they made eye contact, those tenebrous eyes were gazing straight into his soul. He couldn’t help how his mouth hung open a little, his bottom lip shaking from the raw intensity of the look being shot.
“Yes actually-“ Fred grinned whilst speaking,
The question was clearly rhetorical, its only purpose was to get under Draco’s skin even more.
Harry knew for a fact that all he was looking at was his shirt, but he also knew that his strong gaze was affecting Draco in all the right ways. He could see the way his body shook slightly, the harsh grip of his lip between his teeth. Harry relished in it.
Ron groaned as Harry allowed himself to grin a little at his friends annoyance, no matter what the situation; it seemed that his friends could always make him laugh and smile. The wholesomeness of his thought was majorly undermined by the pleasure that pulsated throughout his body at the next moment.
His thoughts were full of all the sin that it was before and it made his prick swell even more in the tight confines of his trousers, his bottom lip wobbled as his eyes jolted back up to Harry’s.
“But. You must bring him back, he can’t be missing out on anymore lessons now, can he?” Ron gave the other a slight worried look, knowing Harry would not wanna come back into the classroom after this. Nobody had laughed though, but if anybody could persuade him it was Hermione.
“We’re fucked.” Pansy muttered to her friends, not caring if the others heard at this point.
The touch was subtle enough that he could get away with the ‘conceal attempt’ excuse, when really - he just craved a hand on his arousal. The pleasure shot throughout his body like shocks of electricity.
“What do you smell, Malfoy?” Ron couldn’t help but ask, turning around in his chair.
“Think that has anything to do with Malfoy?” His name coming from Neville’s mouth had caught him off guard as he covered up his reaction with a cough, now listening intently.
Harry was quite surprised at how collected and controlled his voice sounded when he was literally having to squeeze his thighs together, tightly, as he tried to will away the intruding thoughts in his head and the even bigger intrusive problem growing in his pants.
“Bloody hell, mate. You’re hard as a rock.” Ron blinked dumbly, looking to catch his friends’ eyes before turning back.
Potter had pulled out fully, allowing Draco to gulp in air through his mouth and coughing a little before getting it under control. His throat hurt already but he craved for it to hurt more, he didn’t even want to start thinking how fucked that sounded.
Potter groaned lowly, sending his own vibrations down through Draco and making his body twitched. Even now, the other sounded authoritative and controlled.
“You did, Harry. And pretty loudly at that.” Hermione whispered, trying to ignore the quickly growing smirk from Ginny - it only made her own smirk harder to will away.
In a matter of seconds, he had set a punishing pace - all because Draco had complained. Harry was the devil, a particularly lustful devil that the blonde didn’t mind at all.
What he didn’t expect, however, was for Potter to start smirking at him. His gaze, once more, turning into one of pure hunger. Draco’s body wracked with icy chills that kissed each ridge of his spine, that only made the bastard smirk more.
He tried to focus on how soft the sheets were, silk against his hands. The room was silent, he wondered how long Potter would purposefully not say anything; his only motive was to build even more tension to - no doubt - break Draco just a little bit more.
Even though he was fully clothed he felt his breathing increase, he felt completely naked. He was almost in awe as he watched as Potter repeated the process, dragging his assertive gaze up and down Draco, assessing the boy from what he could see.
He tucked a finger under Draco’s chin, pulling his face up to look at him. Draco couldn’t help but blush at the gesture, his heart hammering in his chest.
He sucked on Draco’s tongue for a few seconds, quickly moving to focus on his lips. Harry was nipping and biting, making the other’s already swollen lips; swell even more.
From the way Harry gestured to the dorms outside, Draco had turned around to see himself standing in front of a door.
"I.. I was thinking about it," Malfoy hisses internally, feeling the way his tongue goes lax, the truth properties from the potion already starting to kick in with its effects.
"What's the matter Malfoy, I would have thought you of all people would be used to it by now. Did Daddy dearest not put you in your rightful place all those years ago?"
from any further embarrassment by a furious ginger.
to behave? As much as a Slytherin can, anyway?"
At the words, something in the blonde snapped, as his eyes heated up and he released himself glaring daggers at the brunette.
A dark silence in which even Harry knew he had gone too far resinates, although he knew he couldn't
Malfoy wants to protest but decides he's rather too riled up with excitement.
Squirming desperately against the brunette's grip and gaze, Malfoy's pale body flushes with heat at the use of his first name. It felt unfamiliar…
Potter seems to have the same idea, fingers coming to curl around the blondes sharp jawline as he yanks him firmly; forcing the thin-framed man to look up at him.
"Congrats Weasley, you seem to be aware of my name,
…  the Slytherin swallowing nervously as he

distracting way.
.. Hn..."
He can feel the hot shame spread across his pale skin, but thankfully Malfoy was no stranger at hiding his outward appearance as he masks his weakness with arrogance instead. "What, because I'm a faggot that instantly means I want to suck every blokes cock, including your own does it? My you must think pretty highly of yourself Potter," he scoffs with a raised eyebrow, glaring daggers at the other boy.
“Ow! You bastard.” Harry rubbed his cheek, the pain already ebbing away quickly under his fingers. He looked up to see Hermione hissing in pain from the pure velocity that her hand had collided with his face at, he couldn’t help but thank karma. The girl always did have a mean slap and punch. But he also understood why she had to do it and was grateful, as much as you can be for getting slapped anyway.
“So, w-what do you want, P-Potter?”
“Aguamenti.”
“Drink, so you don’t have an excuse not to answer my question.”
His mouth no longer directly at his ear but had shifted down slightly to his neck, he could feel the ghost of his lips on him. He wanted nothing more for Harry to close the gap, he knew though, knew that he was being teased. He almost let a whimper slip past his lips, then he remembered that he needed to reply. He did not trust his voice.
hey, before you read, i'm sorry if some parts are a little cringe; this is purely just something to let out creatively and i hope you enjoy :)
Ron laughed but Draco could tell he was being serious, it made his cheeks grow an even darker red. How Harry’s friends were talking about the fact he was going to get fucked so hard that he’d struggle to walk, he felt so very exposed.
“You’re just asking for it.”
Potter’s tone was low and powerful, Draco had his eyes open as soon as the demand left his mouth.
Without any sign of warning, Potter had slammed Draco against the door behind him; a dull throb radiating throughout his head from the force of hitting it. A mix between a groan and a whimper of pain slipped past the blonde’s lips, his head throbbed in time with his prick.
Harry’s eyes soon slipped back down to his mouth as the grin reappeared on his lips, his thoughts full of sinful images. He couldn’t help but think about using that mouth, watching the bratty blonde drop to his knees eagerly and have Harry’s cock shoved down his throat.
At his answer, Potter let out another tantalising chuckle that made him weak all over. He flinched at how harsh it sounded, he was starting to become addicted to the darkness that Harry carried.
He’d just think about Snape or something, that would stop his body. Nevermind, he’d just think about what he was going to wear.
He had a sly thought that Potter had not told him he wasn’t allowed to touch inside of himself, he quickly realised that he probably included that. Draco did not want to risk anything so if he had to hold off for longer just so Potter could be the one to touch him and be inside of him, then that’s what he was going to do.
Draco, however, would never admit to the slight chill that wracked his body when Potter’s dark eyes had connected with his own grey ones. He barely even registered the muttered agreement around him at his comment.
“And to answer your question, I don’t know exactly. All he said to me when I last saw him was to not wait up for him.”
More embarrassment flooded through his senses, he could not believe that his old rival was the one breaking him down like this.
“I just wanted to say, when Potter comes in. Anything homophobic comes out of any of your mouths and I’ll shove my fist so far down your throat that-“
What Potter was offering had his mouth watering, he wanted everything that the other had to give. He almost got lost in his head at the pure visuals of what was to come if he agreed, pain and pleasure. His hard on had began to throb in time with his heartbeat, shocks of want made their way up his body.
“What were we talking about again?” Both Fred and George said in sync, wiggling their eyebrows.
Hermione pitched in, chuckling more when a blush crawled its way up Ron’s neck; yet again. It took Harry a moment to realise what had been said.
“Yes you fucking would, you’re so very transparent. I can see through your charade so easily so don’t even try to argue with me. The way you looked earlier tells me different than what you’re saying, kitten.”
The two began walking as Harry led the way, taking the other to the closet where he was not long ago hiding.  Hermione, Ron and Pansy who were hiding behind the wall all grinned. Finally deciding to give them their privacy as the walked away.
“Could you not put your cloak back on to try help..conceal it?” Hermione suggested, bringing back the earlier topic of conversation.
The potion’s effects were having a moment of calm, which allowed Harry to be able to joke around with his friend again. He put a hand over his heart and on his face was a fake offended expression, the others giggled.
“Would you please explain why you just groaned like someone was-“ Fred started,
(See the end of the chapter for
His eyes were then off of him, Draco didn’t know whether he was relieved or disappointed. Hermione had nudged Potter’s shoulder and spoke some words to him, he hadn’t caught what was said. He watched as the other’s gaze looked towards his best friend and then to his other friends, Draco’s heart stuttered in his chest.
Harry wanted to hear the other speak, wanted to hear how fucked his voice was - how fucked his own cock had made it.
Draco couldn’t explain it but being so close was intoxicating, the feeling that Potter gave him was almost indescribable. It was everything he needed, craved and wanted.
Ron reluctantly turned the handle, walking through as Harry followed. The class didn’t immediately look up, way too immersed with what they were brewing in their cauldrons.
He couldn’t help but beg, it slipped out of his mouth before his brain could even register it. He had also just embarrassed himself for the hundredth time just for Harry’s pleasure and it made his own cock throb in his jeans - he hadn’t even noticed himself getting hard.
Draco knew his words were useless, he had already shown how willing he was for Harry in the Great Hall - how he melted through his fingers like butter. He also recognised how he was beginning to lose his fake cool exterior whilst Potter’s voice and how he held himself was still so very controlled.
“You’re just lying to make me feel better.”
He watched as Harry’s almost obsidian coloured eyes wretched themselves from reciprocating the eye contact to then glide down.
“P-Please, Potter.” The grin that placed itself on Harry’s lips had the blonde boy reeling, he recognised the teasing expression that always left him aching for it.
He was also talking down all the sinful visuals and thoughts in his head, he did not need his prick to rise and ending up getting stuck in the zipper or some shit. Draco cringed at just imagining it, that managed to keep his filthy mind at bay for a little.
Draco’s lips could barely stretch to the girth of Potter’s cock, incredibly overwhelming yet everything he needed and craved. He swirled his tongue around best he could, realising that he almost couldn’t move it; his mouth already so full. His lips stretched to their absolute, maximum limit and Draco fucking loved it.
"Did...did..." Voice hesitant and despite himself, Harry couldn't help but offer a small smile to the other man, encouraging him to continue.
when he notices the brunette reaching into his robe and pulling something out from inside his pocket insert.
After trusting the boy with making the potion, they should’ve expected something to go wrong.
Harry was hard, fully hard. He knew that he wouldn’t be able to keep it from showing, he was a little larger than average - he would just have to deal with the fact that he could not conceal the hard on that was throbbing in his pants.
His instinct was to nibble nervously on his bottom lip. To try distract himself from the arousal growing in his pants and to try and keep his lip from shaking so much, he did not need Potter seeing him so vulnerable. But he did at the same time.
It didn’t take him too long, as soon as he was finished he swat his feather down and rolled up the scrolls. He stood up on his numb legs and almost fell, he managed to grab on to his desk in time. He placed his work on the desk and moaned softly in relief that it was done, the cramp in his hand pulsed slightly as he stretched it out and hoped it would go away.
He was being grabbed harshly by his hips and spun around, he was faced with an unnerving figure - who he had strain his neck up to look at properly.
“P-Please.” Was all the Slytherin could get out, it was an answer. He didn’t dare try to say a full sentence though, he wouldn’t be able to force it out. Harry licked his lips in a way that was downright predatory and Draco fucking loved it.
“My mother wasn’t mad, only scared of his reaction. I started acting out at school, he was trying to force me to be a person I didn’t want to be. I didn’t and still don’t want to be an evil person, I want to be good. He hated that. I’m not blaming him for it all though, I was a prick.” Harry laughed softly.
Draco had to admit that he was a little more curvy than other guys his age, his arse much more filled out. More so than most girls, even. He had grown to love it, he was proud of how far he had come with his body confidence.
“I think I’ve been patient enough. How about we finally shut you up, hm?”
He nodded desperately, wanting to cry out at the way Potter’s lips had dragged against the sensitive skin on his neck from his own movement. He was glad he remembered that he had eyes on him, or else he would’ve been emitting noises that he knew would’ve only embarrassed him. But like Harry said, he wouldn’t be keeping noises from him anymore.
They finally arrived at what Draco recognised to be the mirror, he cast a quizzical gaze to his friend.
“You can’t avoid speaking forever, you know.”
“Oh no, no, no. Don’t be embarrassed, I don’t think you understand how fucking hot you are.”
His lips had barely even began adjusting to the stretch before Potter started gradually pushing in his cock, the hand on his thigh was holding onto him like a lifeline.

Harry seemed to watch the other boy almost thoughtfully before deciding something between himself; startling the blonde
form and to his horror, his resolve breaks instantly, as the obsessive need for **more** takes over.
"I couldn't agree more," his nemesis scoffs  and the thought of Potter agreeing with anything he had to say leaves a sick taste in his mouth.
"Thank you," he whispered quietly, a small smile gracing his lips and Harry's heart absolutely melted at the scene, wanting to replay it over and over again.
"What was the book Malfoy," and the lithe blonde doesn't miss the softness of the tone as the boy continues to stare into the fiery embers.

"Come on, drink up now, I don't got all bloody night," he's waving the vile arrogantly, the crystal clear liquid sparkling and swashing around as the blonde eyes it wearily.
"Come on then Malfoy, let's go. I'll protect you."
"Y-" he tries to resist but knows the action is futile.
"I don't see why I have to be when Weasley isn't behaving himself."
Draco knows he would have squirmed, thick course rope rubbing raw against such delicate wrists. He knew it would hurt, an unnerving sensation that rattles through the lithe boy's body in excitement; all too aware that the wounds left afterwards would sting and a noticeable imprint would stay for days.

gapes like a flounder, unsure what to say or do as luckily he's rescued by the Room of Requirements door returning, and an angelic face popping up into view.
Surprisingly, the blonde didn't resist, just simply nodded almost shyly, as he followed meekly by his nemesis's side as they walked back through the tall grass of the outside courtyard.
The salacious image of the blonde being held down against his will sends unintended heat stirring in his groins; a desperate want that angers the Slytherin.
Malfoy again, and he would gladly seal that with an Unbreakable Vow.

"You heard me. I said your right. So is Blaise. I mean look at me. I'm.. I'm just asking for it," he hangs his head even lower at the last words, ashamed to admit such a thing and to Harry no less.
In the background Draco can hear his friend chime out, "Perhaps pink and frilly?"
Dread resonates within the blonde as he realizes what he was just about to say.
"Is Voldemort coming back?"
Okay so...
He hadn't noticed the truth serum when he had first entered the room, but Draco's not the least bit surprised that the Room of Requirements would somehow

"Well you know me, always have a nasty habit of sticking my nose in other people's business," he calls dryly, no humor.
Seemed almost silly, the sudden change in thought, but as Draco nestled close to him, body practically ontop of Harry's, the brunette didn't comment. Instead, simply moving his hand behind the blondes back to rub soothing circles in the back of his spine; causing a quiet purr to escape past thin lips.
At this Draco rolls his eyes, shooting a scowl at the red haired boy accompanying the brunette.
A low whimper snapped Harry's attention away from his thoughts as he looked at the form beside him.
Draco Malfoy knows he's fucked as soon as
"When Pansy grabbed me and smacked me against the wall, I guess," he shrugs innocently enough.
"Right? That's what I thought," the ginger puffs out proudly as he snuggles up closer to his girlfriend.

His head is getting worse, swimming in edged blurs by the minute and he wants to relax, to rest his head and he's almost tempted, eyes growing impossibly heavy before realizing he'd have to rest his head on Potter's shoulders; would have to nestle close and bury his angled chin in the crook of the

And Merlin, if that name doesn't send the Slytherin in a full out whine, eyes closing and squeezing tight to fight back a fresh wave of arousal.
"How did you get that nasty bruise on your face Malfoy?"
But when the Slytherin thought back on all the memories they shared, good and bad, his newfound feelings for his long-time nemesis suddenly didn’t feel so unexpected.
Judging by his discomfort, it was something Potter wished he hadn't of said.
Harry is up from the couch in seconds- body practically towering over Malfoy now, as a predatory smile slips upon etched lips.  The lithe blonde shakes, terrified of being humiliated and hexed by his enemy.

He knew what his friends would think, getting up so hastily after their completely absurd conversation, only to follow the blonde Syltherin but the boy was looking...nervous.. and Harry had every intention of finding out why.
"Don't worry Ron," Harry speaks up, his demeanor quiet but demanding as he puts a hand on his friend's shoulder for moral support.
"'Fraid she's right mate. The way your looking at him isn't the best look. People might get....ideas.." the last part he whispered as if afraid anyone else would hear.

He was right.
Hating himself but knowing he had to play coy, his dry mouth found the words to utter darkly, "Do I get to have the first go?"
Harry felt the curl of shame bubble up in his chest at his heated words from earlier, desperate to take them back. As he swallowed dryly, he couldn't help but notice that for the first time ever, Harry was unable to look at Draco.
"AFTER Malfoy takes his."
He had been right, unfortunately.
Everyone was laughing at him now, even Potter.

"Malfoy, it's okay. He's gone now..." when the shaking blonde still said nothing, instead curling in on himself, Harry pushed on, desperate to fill the awkward silence of witnessing such a moment between his enemy and what was supposed to be Malfoy's 'friend.'
Harry's warm breath is ghosting against Draco's neck, tickling the light blondish hair's on the Slytherins neck as the lithe blonde wishes he was anywhere but here.
Let it be known, that even the bravest of Gryffindor's can be a coward at times for he found himself saying nothing of such comforting things that he was sure would help the pure-blood in some way or another, instead replying softly, "Come on Malfoy. Let's go get something to eat. I got you okay? I'll take care of you."
The words from just mere moments earlier ringing in his ears.
"You like being all bruised up and put on display, don't you Malfoy?

Panic pierced the Slytherin as he screamed wildly like a trapped animal, fighting and squirming against the Gryffindor.

Body stiffens for a minute, as a look of guilty fear crashes over Zabini at being caught before realizing it's not a Hogwarts teacher, and rather just a student.

"Sides it's not your father I'm jealous of," the last part is quiet, a huff to himself that Malfoy can pick up on, though he does not understand what the Gryffindor means by the words.

truthfully. Sometimes I think the answer is no, but then I get this terrible feeling in my gut and I can't help but second guess myself."
The two stare at each other, both breathless and excited as Malfoy can’t seem to tear his eyes away from the bright emerald greens.
"Ron are you in here?"
He closes his eyes, trying to concentrate on quieting his heart that races anxiously, but finds it even more difficult when he's forced to
"W-what?" Malfoy
"Fuck Draco I'm-I'm so sorry, I didn't mean-"
"Common Draco, don't be such a bloody tease."
“Fucking hell…” the Slytherin hears the Gryffindor curse quietly, and Draco can’t help but smirk before he discovers the reason of the brunette’s distress.
And thoughts of

Harry clenched his fists, bile rising to the top of the surface.
It disturbs him that
"Knock it off, Zabini or my father will have words," the pure-blood hissed hoping to deter the other man with threats as he squirmed against the tight grip his 'friend' had him in.
Draco hesitated. He rather liked his bollocks where they were, thank you very much. But Potter was walking out and Draco was running out of time to think. Did he even have a chance at this point? Was Potter only going to yell at him some more? Should he just cut his losses and Apparate back to his flat?
’ So unless you have a long lost sibling…”
Malfoy waved his wand and a file shot itself out of a cabinet behind him. He gingerly opened it and laid it flat against his desk. “9 Milford Lane, Weybridge, Surrey.” He handed Harry a piece of parchment with the address written in a fancy script.
Harry had gone back to Malfoy’s office several more times over the last fortnight, despite there really being nothing that the blonde could do for him. Harry always found an excuse to pop in, whether it be because the gate moved a millimeter, or because Harry thought he might have seen something move past the gates.
Maybe there was still a chance…
George took a long sip of his wine and then leaned forward, enunciating clearly as if he had slurred his words the first time. “I said, ‘So, Harry, how’s Malfoy?’”
Malfoy--
“So it was a date,” Harry confirmed, laughing lightheartedly. “I liked it.”
“Yes, obviously.” Though Draco wanted to point out the last two times they’d seen each other, it was Potter who had “shown up”.
“Have sex on the sun-soaked sand of a private beach?”
Maybe it was the fact that he’d just woken up, or that he was still thinking about that damned sock he needed to find so he could snog Draco again, but Harry nearly said
Harry pulled back a few moments later, lips red and glistening. “I don’t know if that was a furor,” he panted, giving Draco a knowing smile. “Hell, I don’t think that was even a hubbub. No brouhaha, foofaraw.”
“I meant what are you doing
The fireplace burned green for a moment before Hermione stepped through. Harry was busy in the kitchen making a pot of tea and packing up some biscuits for the road. Hermione pressed a kiss to his cheek and sat at the table, a round piece of cherry wood that Harry constructed himself.
“Hullo Longbottom,” Draco returned politely, taking a sip of his pint.
Another hour and a half of work went by and Draco’s cubicle mate, Charles, got up. “Lunch?” He asked, grabbing his jacket and slipping it on.
“That’s it. Outside,” Potter demanded, throwing his napkin onto his empty place and hailing the waiter for the check. They hadn’t even gotten to the appetisers.
“You need to stop reading the dictionary,” Draco mumbled, burying his face in Harry’s neck and planting a few kisses there.
Draco cleared his throat once more and declared, “I apologise.”
Somehow Draco was doing this. He booked a harp player, set up tables and stations, and even went to one of those Muggle party stores to pick up sickly sweet decorations. Through all of this, we still wondered why Weasley was having them celebrate Valentine’s of all holidays. Only a few of the aurors had partners or were even dating. The job is too time consuming to have any sort of romantic personal life.
Their lunch was simple, so simple it was gone within a few minutes, but afterward they laid on the grass and took in the smell of the fresh air, feeling the sun beating down on their faces. Every once in a while, a butterfly would flutter above them, but often for only a second or two. Ron finally sat up, leaning on his elbow to face Harry.
be his family. But he ached for his parents to be sitting across from him at this table. He wanted to see his father’s unkempt hair, possibly greying by now were he alive, and his mother’s easy grin, smile lines creasing her cheeks. He wanted to talk to them, be comforted by them, hear all the family gossip and stories of the past. He wanted to know his family.
“We launched the newest salve today,” Neville started, flipping over a few pieces of parchment while he read them, “bubotuber pus and shrivelfig leaves. Mostly for beauty purposes, but helps with healing as well.”
Twenty minutes later their plates were cleared and Harry had just finished scrubbing the last fork, setting it delicately on a towel next to the sink to dry. Wiping his hands off on a separate towel, he turned back to the table to find Draco watching him with a small smile, head resting on the palm of one of his hands. Harry hung the towel up without breaking eye contact and then asked, “What?”
Harry only passed two people in the corridor on his way to Draco’s office, both of which were curse-breakers that were too busy speaking to each other in hushed whispers to pay any attention to him. All the better, he thought. He’s not sure Draco is ready to be seen with him in public quite yet. When he reached the door, he opened it without thinking, only to find someone else sitting in his usual seat.
The next day he went back to the gate and did the same thing, only this time he decided to try talking to the house.
“Um,” he continued when Draco slowed down the assault on his neck. “’A new weakness flooded her, her senses starving for his hands and mouth and b-body…’
He gathered his clothes, startling when something thumped to the floor. His little blue book had slipped from his pocket, lying open on the shag carpet. Draco tossed his clothes in the laundry, scooped up the book, and deposited it in the bin.
“No, Kingsley wanted to have lunch because he,” she threw up two air quotes, “‘found out about Ron and I’s anniversary last week’. I told him it’s really okay, but he insisted.”
“Well, you might want to stick around to watch it crash and burn,” Draco laughed awkwardly. “I didn’t get the party planning gene, I suppose.
Potter’s head pulled back so fast it thumped against the wall behind him, but that didn’t slow him down. His lips found the pulse point on Draco’s neck, scraping his teeth against it while his hips ground up into Draco’s hand. Draco’s knee wedged between Potter’s legs, pressing the shorter man fully against the wall.
It was over and one quick look at Draco’s face made Harry panic. He ran his hand through his hair a grand total of four times just in the thirty second silence that followed their kiss. His eyes darted from Draco to the gate behind him and back again. He eventually stepped closer and grabbed Draco’s wrist.
“Were you watching me?” Potter asked, sliding his empty glass across the counter so it could be taken away when the bartender brought them each a fresh one.
“Don’t you have quidditch practice?”
“Sorry,” he said quickly, and then, “I was grabbing coins from my vault when I came across this and I was just wondering… If you could tell me anything about it.”
Ron tilted his head back and laughed. “Malfoy, probably,” he jested.
Thanks to everyone who's been reading so far! I've worked really hard on this fic and I appreciate any feedback! Hope you guys enjoy this chapter.
Potter’s behaviour was very interesting, as Draco could generally pinpoint which type of socialiser one was just by observing them at a bar. Potter, however, didn’t fit into any category. He kept to himself a majority of the time, spinning his tumbler on the counter as if by nervous habit. He looked around a lot, as if wishing someone would talk to him or wishing he could join conversations, but he never made a move. Draco couldn’t help but wonder why Potter was here, if not meeting friends. Unlike Draco, who considered himself a solo artist at the bar, Potter changed over the course of the night. A couple next to him pulled him into a conversation and his entire face lit up, like he’d been waiting all night for someone to speak to him.
“Of course,” Malfoy said politely.
As the team headed off for the showers, the coach stopped him and demanded he get his arm checked out. Harry sighed and obeyed. Luckily the healer was quick. She pressed a potion to his chest and instructed him to take it. It tasted slightly of peppermint and felt icy cool sliding down his throat. The pain faded away and Harry started to get up, but the healer pushed him back down in his seat.
He apparated just outside the front door, tucking the large, wrapped present under one arm before knocking. The door creaked open seemingly on its own and Harry peered around it. “Hello?” His voice echoed through the foyer, but no one replied. He slipped inside and shut the door with an audible click. After standing there for a minute waiting for someone to greet him like usual, he ventured further into the house. He glanced into several rooms but found them all empty. Starting to feel rather embarrassed, he slinked into the kitchen.
After the war, Harry decided to return for his last year of school with Hermione and Ron, but ended up spending much of it helping Headmistress McGonagall rebuild. He still had no idea what kind of job he wanted, and several tea times with the Headmistress only served to confuse him more. Since the end of that year, McGonagall had asked him back several times as a guest speaker, and once as a substitute teacher for a week. He’d be lying if he said he didn’t like those times. Being back at the school was difficult, but teaching reminded him of fifth year when all his friends stood by his side against Umbridge and the only death had been Cedric.
The gate wouldn’t open. Harry had tried pushing, pulling, a simple Alohamora, and even a blasting curse, but it wouldn’t budge. He’d thought it might recognize his magical signature, or something like that, and let him in, but the lock remained tightly shut. He grabbed one of the iron bars and rattled it back and forth furiously before letting go with a huff. He turned to Hermione.
Ron jokingly said, “Maybe he wants you to be Minister.”
“James....Right…” He was at a loss for words, mouth opening and closing every so often, but void of sound.
“What happens if I do?” Draco questioned, the glass almost slipping out of his fingers. His reflexes were fucked, he could tell that easily. He wandered closer to the table, swaying with the weight of several strong drinks in his system.
“Hey,” Potter said, “I’ve got your order.” He stepped into the room followed by three levitating trays. Each one floated into place onto the front table and Harry quickly removed their coverings, revealing a display of beautiful heart shaped cookies with various designs on them. The chocolate ones looked especially good, and as Draco walked up to observe them he almost wanted to try one now.
“What are you doing here?” Potter said in an accusing voice, the sound echoing throughout the lobby.
“You’ll have to ask your nana.” He set Teddy back on his feet and sat in a chair nearby. The garden was decorated in every color imaginable. Balloons were tied into animal shapes, mostly giraffes and dogs, and hanging off the back of every chair in the garden. A bounce house was set up in the corner, and several children were inside having the time of their lives, from what it looked like. Harry knew Teddy would drag him in there eventually. He just hoped it was over with before cake, otherwise he might get sick.
It had been more than twenty years since anyone had set foot on that property. When he did this afternoon, he didn’t really expect so much to change, and it gave him a fleeting hope that just stepping into the foyer or the kitchens would allow the house to restore itself to its former glory. But there was also the possibility of losing those memories, those connections to his parents that were tied to the manor.
“I kidnapped Draco and kissed him by the gate,” Harry replied in a deadpan voice. He could feel Ron’s stare on the side of his face, almost like it was another sun.
The toe of his shoe hit a slab of concrete and he finally looked away from the scenery around him to see the beginning of a short staircase, leading up to a front door. Without thinking, he took the step, and the next and the next, until he was pressing his palm against the front doors.
“That’s alright,” the woman — Draco never did clarify her name — started, “I’ve got to be getting home anyway.” Neither of the men paid any attention to her. Draco wasn’t sure what sort of conversation they would be having once she was gone, but maybe it would play out.
What would he do if there was nothing left? It’s possible he could rebuild, but he had no memory of ever being in this place. There was no way he could restore it to its former glory. At least, his imagination made it seem glorious. For all he knew, it could look like the Burrow. That’d be nice. Cozy shag rugs surrounded by mismatched couches and chairs, the essence of functionality.  Or it could look like Malfoy Manor, dark marbled floors with rooms that held nothing but a few sculptures to take up space. Not that he’d exactly gotten a clean look around the place when he had last been there.
“M’sorry,” Harry confessed, overtly attempting to walk as if he wasn’t struggling, which made his walk even stranger. “I didn’t mean to leave you out when talking to Nev.”
“Can we…Will you come with me?” Harry started, and then changed his question.
Draco rocked their hips together, feeling the hardness of Potter’s prick through the layers of fabric. Potter gasped, their lips parting for mere seconds before finding each other again. Potter’s hands slid down Draco’s sides, tickling his ribs and making him shiver, before they landed on his belt buckle. Before he could even blink, Potter had his trousers undone and was shoving the fabric down his legs, as far as he could reach without breaking the kiss. Potter’s fingers curled around Draco’s prick, giving it a firm stroke to the tip and making Draco whine against his lips.
What the hell happened last night? He couldn’t remember ever being this hungover. The last thing he remembered was Thomas’ hands wrapping around his waist, lifting him up. Oh, he thought. The tower. Draco hadn’t knocked it over. Thomas had kissed him in celebration, Potter had looked disappointed. Was that due to Draco’s success or Thomas’ kiss? He couldn’t tell. Flashes of the rest of the night went through his head. Another bottle of Firewhisky was purchased. Someone knocked over the tower, the sound of shattering glass still loud in Draco’s brain. Thomas brought him out to dance, the band replaced by a DJ playing Muggle party music. Draco could almost still feel the bass thumping in his chest. Then Potter had shown up again, whispering to Thomas. Thomas shaking his head, Potter leaving. Thomas’ hands on his arse, their hips grinding together on the dance floor. Potter again, angry this time, trying to talk to Draco over the music. Draco couldn’t remember what was said.
He finally came to a stop outside the last office. There was a large sign on the door declaring, “MAGICAL DEEDS AND REALTY” and, in a slightly less offending size, “Draco Malfoy – Director.” Harry only had a few seconds to panic about seeing his longtime school nemesis before the door swung open sharply.
“Woah,” exclaimed Ron as he took in the scenery around him. The open field full of soft, beautiful grass and dotted with flowers and trees was truly a sight to behold, Harry could admit. This was his fourth day in a row having lunch in this field because he loved how cushiony the grass was under a blanket. He could honestly spend forever out here watching the clouds and then the stars after the sunset.
He turned on the tub to its hottest setting and stared at himself in the mirror until it was so fogged over he couldn’t distinguish himself from the wall behind him.
Draco allowed him a few seconds to recover, then returned to his brutal pace. Sweat dripped down the side of his face as he fucked into Potter repeatedly, Potter mouthing at his neck. Draco’s release took him by surprise. He buried his face in Potter’s chest, letting out a deep groan as the pleasure peaked.
“Because I’ve kept tabs on you, Malfoy!” Potter nearly exploded. “You really believed I haven’t thought about you? You think I don’t know your little ploy to get all the Gryffindors in bed? You
“It’s nearly lunch,” Draco smiled down at him, a genuine, if not sleepy, smile that made Harry’s heart melt. As kids, Draco’s expressions mostly consisted of mirth and hatred, but seeing his eyes crinkle around a goofy grin that he strictly reserved for when he was alone with Harry made him want to faint. Harry couldn’t remember what his life was like before that smile, before seeing genuine happiness on Draco’s face. Draco’s cheeks always bulged out when he did it, and many times they flushed red when he saw Harry looking. But to tell the truth, Harry could never stop looking. He was quickly becoming a man obsessed, watching Draco’s eyes light up and his frown lines practically disappear. He had vowed on their first official date to make Draco smile as much as he could, and he mentally extended the vow indefinitely. He’d make the blonde show those teeth one way or another, everyday for the rest of his life if he needed to.
The elf grumbled and began his slow descent down the stairs, gripping onto the handrail to keep himself upright. He could be heard whispering and grunting to himself as he passed the interlocked couple- were they a couple?- but the two men paid no mind, returning to their moment together.
“Malfoy,” Potter addressed without emotion. He then craned his neck to look at the tower, smirking, as if he knew Draco couldn’t possibly place his glass without knocking the whole thing onto the floor, and waved his hand. “Go on, then.” Draco watched Potter for a moment, that smirk throwing him off.
Most of the ones he’d had were fine with one fuck, never trying to score a second round, never sticking around long enough for a pot of water to boil. And never asking questions.
Harry though for a moment before nodding. “It sounds like he’s planning on giving you some sort of promotion, but he’s talking in riddles.” He finished the rest of his tea and handed his empty mug to Hermione, who packed it back up in the basket they brought. The cake was gone at this point, finished off by Ron who had just licked his fingers clean.
“It’s alright,” Draco replied, trying not to smile at the hilarious way that Harry was walking. His ankles seemed to wobble with every step and he clung tighter to Draco’s arm the closer they got to their destination. Draco had a fleeting thought of a baby deer trying to walk for the first time after being born. In the effort to not look drunk, Harry was taking overly cautious steps that backfired, making him look like a lunatic. “I even have a few ideas on retail space, if he’s still looking for it that is. And if he’d accept my help as well, I suppose.”
Draco’s hair was unkempt, sticking up at odd angles that didn’t suit his face very well. Harry briefly remembered tangling his fingers in that hair and tugging on it while they snogged heavily the night before. The blonde’s shirt was untucked, wrinkled beyond belief, and his eyes were tired, but alight with something Harry couldn’t quite place. Maybe it had just been a trick of the light. He only had one sock on, which seemed pretty odd considering he definitely had two last night. Harry couldn’t think of where the other might have gone, but the thought of Draco leaving something behind made him slightly giddy. If he found it, he had a reason to visit. An excuse to show up at Draco’s house or work and possibly get another snogging session in before he had to leave. Harry told himself he’d look for it later.
“If anyone could be a better minister than you, I’d eat my hat,” Harry told her seriously, offering the bag of crisps. She delicately took one and then nibbled on the edge of it.
“I don’t think I can…” He almost whispered, avoiding eye contact with the blonde.
He sighed and looked up at the sky. “Sometimes I think it’s best I let my parents go, but all I knew of them for so long is what other people had told me. I wish I could discover things for myself.” He sat in silence for long moments, watching the clouds roll by in the sky.
Potter merely raised an eyebrow. “What do you want from me, Malfoy? I can’t forgive you. I can’t understand. Your entire life, you chose the wrong side. Snape,” Draco flinched at that, “the executioner in third year.
When fresh drinks were presented to them, they both silently sipped and stared across the bar. Of course, Draco was really only watching Harry through the mirrored back of the shelves holding various bottles of spirits.
He swung a leg over his broom and took off into the air, muttering a quick spell to attach his glasses to his face so they wouldn’t fall. He flew around the pitch a few times before hovering near the stands. He heard Mrs. Weasley shout, “Be careful Harry!” Ginny, sat next to her, rolled her eyes and mouthed what looked like the word “buzzkill”. Harry just laughed and winked at Ginny before taking off around the pitch again.
Flushing, Draco closed the book and set it on the side table. “For your information, I’m reading it ironically,” he muttered in a matter-of-face tone.
“Tell her,” Harry interrupted, with finality.
Harry’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion as he watched Draco’s retreating silhouette, but summoned a pair of joggers and a loose t-shirt from his wardrobe.
Harry was beginning to feel lost and hopeless. He’d been there for more than two weeks straight and the gate hadn’t loosened up at all. He was trying not to doubt Malfoy, against his better judgement, mainly because he was one of the only people he knew who had a manor to take care of. He could use someone with experience.
Hermione hummed. “That’s what I was thinking. On Tuesday he had me go to his office and he gave he a list of the duties he has to do. Not that he does all of them so much as he delegates them, but I thought it a bit weird. Do you think he’ll make me his personal secretary or something?”
Hermione and Ron tagged along with him on the next trip to the manor. It was a dreary day, the sky full of dark clouds.  Hermione had made a small loaf cake for them to snack on with tea. They sat under umbrellas on the sidewalk outside the gate like it was perfectly normal for three adults to do so while having tea and cake, catching up on the latest news from the Ministry.
Potter pressed another peck to Draco’s lips and then whispered, “I have a surprise for you.”
Harry choked on his cake, coughing and sputtering before bursting out laughing. “No way,” he wheezed, “one of
Harry went back the next day. And the next day, and the next. Ron and Hermione tagged along for another day, then his friend Luna had come. Harry had asked all his friends to come, despite it sounding like an odd way to spend a couple of hours. Neville had passed, too busy with his flourishing business, but told Harry once he gets in he’ll gladly do some landscaping if Harry would like. Dean and Seamus were on their honeymoon currently and could not come. Molly, Arthur, Charlie, George, Ron, and Ginny came with him one day, and they spent several hours chatting and chowing down on the sandwiches Molly had brought for the crowd.
A waiter came by with a bottle of wine, making a point to show the label to Potter, who just nodded without really taking the time to look, before uncorking it and pouring them both a tasting. Potter, the heathen, didn’t even wait for the waiter to walk away before grabbing the bottle and dumping enough wine in to fill his glass to the brim. Draco watched in fascination (and disgust) as Potter downed half the glass without a word, or even the barest glance at Draco, and then proceeded to peruse the menu for the next several minutes.
Harry took a generous gulp of his pint, taking a moment to think over the offer. “Like a manager?” He finally asked.
you trust me?” Harry emphasized.
Draco almost laughed. “That wasn’t surprise enough?”
They walked into ruin. The grand entryway was littered with shards of glass, which seemed to be due to the ceiling cracking, sending the chandelier falling to the floor below. Half of it still hung from one long chain. The staircase was missing several planks of wood, and the paint was so chipped and faded that it honestly looked rotted through. Despite his contracting experience, Harry walked over and set his foot on the first stair; however, when he leaned forward to take the next stair, he heard a deep crack and his foot fell through the first. He pulled his foot out of the stair and brushed the splinters off his pant leg. Windows on either side of the room were cracked or shattered, and one window was completely gone, frame and everything. Harry felt a soft breeze hit him when he approached the window, and he sneezed. A thick layer of dust covered the place. The fireplace was a disaster. It looked as though bricks had been pried from the wall, compromising the structure so much that the rest of it collapsed in on itself. Harry walked over to it and prodded at a few of the broken pieces, crouching down. A large cabinet leaned dangerously on an angle, one of the legs having broken off. The floorboards creaked under his weight as he made his way back to Ron and Hermione.
“Us?” Harry asked, because he hadn’t really realized there was officially an ‘
“Do people perform here?” He asked without really thinking about who he was asking.
Harry apparated to the Burrow the next evening. Despite his newfound home full of memories from his parents, grandparents, and beyond, he wasn’t going to give up on the family he’d had since he was eleven. It just wasn’t done. Plus he could never give up Molly’s treacle tart. He was weak.
By the time he returned, Ron had arrived and was just brushing the ash off of his cloak, the green flare of the fireplace dying down behind him.
He gave Draco’s bottom lip one last nip and forced himself to pull away. “Thanks ever so,” Draco said after they caught their breath, a lilt of annoyance present in his voice. Harry pressed one last kiss to Draco’s red and swollen lips before getting off Draco, pulling the blonde to his feet in the same motion. Draco adjusted his trousers before giving Harry a withering look that he didn’t mean.
“No!” Harry laughed, trying to shield his face from an onslaught of poking. “Have mercy!” Eventually even the kids on his team were tackling him, even Teddy whose knee landed straight in Harry’s gut, knocking the wind out of him. He surrendered pretty quickly after that, but not before getting in a good tickle session with the birthday boy.
“Deal,” Draco agreed, following when Harry turned and entered the kitchen.
Harry turned towards his friend, a small smile playing on his lips. He pressed his hand against the gate and it immediately unlocked and began to swing inward. Ron’s mouth flew open.
Finally, Malfoy sat up and leaned against the back of his chair, almost casually. “How did you try to open it?” The way Malfoy was looking at him was not the cruel or spiteful looks he was used to. There was humor in his eyes, but there was also something else. Something Harry couldn’t quite put his finger on.
Draco distractedly followed suit, taking a delicate sip. He’d never noticed the way Potter’s eyes shined so bright when he smiled. It was almost intoxicating. Potter was attractive, Draco had already admitted that to himself earlier in the night, but the thought kept repeating in his mind. He’d had a mild, fleeting crush on the bloke in school, but once the war began he could no longer allow himself to think about it. Liking the one person Voldemort was after was too risky, too dangerous. Over time, those feelings had faded out and Draco had only thought about Potter when he was in the news, or in this case, on the list.
Draco waited, ordering a second drink for himself, watching Potter out of the corner of his vision. Potter had drunk from the glass Draco had sent over slowly, as if he thought maybe Draco had had the bartender poison it, but it was merely a generous pour of whisky. Potter ordered his next one with ice and Draco filed that information in the back of his mind for later.
Also hung up on the wall of the living room was his old broomstick, a Firebolt whose branches were frayed and broken after so many years of use. The handle of it had broken in two places. He’d dropped it when Death Eaters had attacked them on the journey from Surrey to the Weasley residence, but went back after the war to look for it. By his luck, it had been in the backyard of a sweet old muggle woman, who had merely waved to him from her kitchen window while he trespassed on her yard.
Harry could feel his grin go sappy and part of him wanted to kick himself for it, but he couldn’t really help that Draco basically turned him into a huge caldron of Elixir to Induce Euphoria every time he so much as smiled at him. It was all Draco’s fault really. Harry wasn’t sure why, but he had never been this affected by anyone he’d dated before. He’d been attracted to them, sure, but never had he felt so undone by a single facial expression until Draco came into the picture.
“Uncle Harry!” Harry suddenly found himself with an armful of excited, wriggling six year old. Teddy clung to his leg, until Harry finally stooped down to lift him up. Teddy placed a great big, slobbery kiss on Harry’s cheek.
“Thanks, uh, thank you, Malfoy,” he said earnestly. Malfoy gave him an odd look, as if he as well couldn’t believe that they had managed to have a civil, adult conversation. Malfoy nodded his farewell as Harry took his leave. The door clicked gently shut behind him and he made his way back down the corridor, shoes still squeaking obscenely.
Draco just stared at him for a moment before scoffing and continuing their walk. “I didn’t realize how sappy you are when you’ve had wine.”
“Yeah, well…” She deflected, busying herself by examining the crisp between her fingers. Harry just watched her for a moment as she seemed to think very hard about something.
Harry sucked down the last of his beer before standing up as well. “I best get you back to your office before the day’s out,” he chuckled, meaningfully placing his hand over Draco’s on the bar. “I’m sure you’ve plenty of important meetings to get to, now that you’re half drunk.” At this, Harry outright laughed, and Draco finally got out of his seat.
That failed to happen, though. In fact, when Longbottom had finally caught sight of him, he’d merely closed his eyes again and smirked. Draco could only imagine him lost in the euphoria of several alcoholic drinks and good music, as Draco, himself, had been nearly there as well. And when Longbottom had dragged him out to the street for “some fresh air”, the space lit up by the moon overhead and a single lamp several doors down, Draco had kissed him.
“My flat. You were saying you were in love with me?”
“Let’s go back,” Draco suggested, pulling Harry into his side and turning away from the doors.  “We can grab a pint if you’d like.”
“Harry!” She heard some slight banging, storage closet. Of course. She ran over to the door, muttering ‘Alohmora’ as the lock clicked.
He raised both eyebrows at Draco before letting them flick back down to their natural placement, he knew what that meant. He wasn’t the only one who had heard Pansy’s explanation, if he wasn’t sure it was them before; now he sure as hell did.
“L-Like you said, y-you already know.”
His whole body shivered violently, an almost inaudible whine melting out of his slightly ajar mouth that nobody else bar Harry heard. He liked it better that way, being the only one to hear the sweet noises spilling unintentionally out of Draco’s pretty mouth.
Harry, not so subtly, looked the other up and down in an antagonizingly slow and purposeful manner. Shamelessly fucking the other with his eyes, Draco whimpered softly - his body not knowing how to act in this situation.
At the mention of the word ‘cock’, his friends’ eyes slid down Harry’s body. All by accident, of course. Just hearing the word made them all unconsciously look down to said cock, they couldn’t contain their reactions in the slightest. All of their eyes widened, Harry couldn’t figure out why at first.
Harry just stood there for a second, showing and revelling in the blatant power that he held. Draco looked down to observe the other, eyes widening as he gulped unintentionally. Looking down was a mistake.
Shit, he was staring. Instead of being met with the face of certain death, he was met with a blushing Draco. Unexpected, certainly not a bad thing though. Their moment was interrupted as Snape moved to the front.
Hermione put her hand over her mouth in an attempt to stop laughing more as she noticed how Ron’s cheeks were now dusted with red pigment.
Harry plopped himself down right in front of Draco as he sat on the table, legs spread as his boots sat on either side of the blonde’s thighs and cock right on show for Draco.
Harry revelled in the fear that combined with excitement that he saw in Draco’s eyes, he had definitely found a keeper.
“I-I once had to wear s-some of P-Pansy’s underwear, y-you can’t see them through the holes l-like you can w-with boxers.”
George looked pretty pleased with himself whilst Fred just rolled his eyes, Harry just looked puzzled as to why they cared so much.
It had taken him a little longer than 5 minutes to reach the outside of the Gryffindor dorms and he hoped that Potter wasn’t angry, from the clock on the wall it had shown that it was 10:03pm. He wasn’t extraordinarily late but he wasn’t on time either, Draco had a valid excuse that he was ready to give.
His jeans really left nothing to the imagination, he could get away with nothing if a person looked down. The outline so very clear, obscenely showing off his very large size.
Draco could not breathe. His friends around him were muttering about what the fuck was going on, Potter being in a legitimate trance and all; also how he looked and how his friends were reacting. But none of them had noticed where, who, Potter’s gaze was stuck on.
“Anyway. So, what visuals?” Fred and George asked, a cheeky tone lacing both of their words as grins spread across their faces.
“If you start lying, Draco, you will not cum - I will make sure of that.”
She pushed the door open to see Harry sitting on the floor, head between his legs.
“Now come on, Ron will be worried.”
His face was so close to Potter’s cock, he could practically feel the heat radiating from it just from their proximity. He struggled to swallow around the dry of his mouth, contrasting to how his mouth wanted to water at the sight but physically couldn’t. It was even better up close, he couldn’t rip his gaze off of it.
“Throughout the day, Ronald and I were subjected to listen to all of his fantasies. It made the day a lot more interesting, I’ll give him that.” Hermione almost started laughing aloud as she noticed the pure intrigue coming from the twins, they hadn’t been that quiet since they were sleeping babies.
Draco and his friends’ conversations were abruptly cut short as they watched none other than Potter, waltz into the room. His hair was more of a mess than usual and fluffed up, telling how his hands had been threaded through it. Draco also couldn’t help but notice the dark look that resided in the other’s eyes.
“You wanna come hang out with me and study for a bit?” They caught what she meant straight away, Pansy gently pulled their robes towards her and they started to walk off.
He had heard the expression before but never really believed such thing, now he couldn’t deny it. To anybody else, this might’ve terrified them but to Draco; it only made his own prick throb harder. He never thought he’d be such a size queen but here he was, very turned on and very intimidated.
All his focus was put onto not thinking about Harry, thinking about the Gryffindor did nothing but fill him with enticing desires that made his cock want to harden.
Whimper's vibrated through Harry’s cock, causing his hips to jerk slightly; pushing himself further down the blonde’s throat. Draco, once again, choked. But what surprised Harry a little was the unexpected and almost aggressive moan that Draco let out, swallowing around him purposefully this time and using his tongue.
Draco showed no signs of hostility, he literally couldn’t. Narcissa had looked at the other cautiously, wondering what he was going to do. Harry had raised his hands in mock surrender as he sent a soft smile over to his mother, she looked a little taken aback at first since all she’d ever seen of him was his enraged expression towards Lucius.
His gaze was on his friends as they stared at him with baffled expressions. His entrancing eyes flicked towards Draco momentarily, which filled his body with a buzz of need.
“Remember, there’s no counter potion, unfortunately. We just have to wait till it wears off.” Ginny spoke with sympathy in her voice, pouting slightly.
Both his friends and the Slytherin’s whipped their heads up, immediately full of panic.
“Maybe he thinks it was somebody else.” Goyle tried to persuade them all but deep down, they all knew they were royally fucked.
‘After a good punishment’, his heart stuttered harshly in his chest at how much his cock throbbed at that.
The Great Hall wasn’t too full but in no way sparse, people only taking their time to study in the space - the room buzzed with quiet conversation.
He shoved his boxers down to where his jeans were around his thighs, watching his cock as it sprung out. He couldn’t help but groan lowly now the restrictions of his clothes were out of the way, slightly cold air hitting his erection.
Draco’s eyes shot up to Harry’s, mortified. His face burning like he’d fell head first into lava, he could feel his heartbeat pumping violently in his ears. He snapped his mouth shut, he had no idea that it was still open. The taunting was something embarrassed him yet made his prick throb in his jeans.
“I-I’m not adorable.” To enunciate his words he had crossed his arms as he sent a weak attempt at a scowl towards Potter, and from the mischievous glint in the other’s eye, he knew he would regret it.
Potter’s own eyes were flickering from his hand on his neck, back to reciprocating eye contact. That teasing smirk on his features growing wider, the Slytherin couldn’t decide whether he loved or hated how nothing ever got past the other’s scrutinising eyes.
“Only just added the bed in here earlier.” Potter waited until the other had reacted to his words with a confused glance to carry on speaking, he wanted Draco’s full attention on him - just so he could see how his next words would affect him.
hey so from now on - just about - the updates may be a little slower as i need to actually finish writing it but i now have my motivation back for writing so it shouldn't take me too long. thank you so much for reading :)
He shouldn’t have even bothered worrying, all she said was that he looked ‘fucking fabulous’ that he should ‘wear more clothes like that’ and to close it off, that he should ‘show his skin more’. His mother being so supportive of him and his sexuality, which she had admitted to him that she had known for a while but she just wanted to wait until he felt comfortable enough to tell her, was an incredible feeling. He’d cried tears of content and joy many times, he was so thankful for Narcissa.
His bottom lip wobbled at the thought, his fears coming true as he felt the stirring in his gut. One of pleasure, he wasn’t even being touched and he felt little shocks surge throughout his body - straight to his rising prick. It wouldn’t surprise him if it were somehow Potter’s magic causing his physical feelings, the thought only added to his struggle.
He may be under a lust potion but Draco came to the conclusion that he wasn’t looking at anybody else like that, only him. Maybe he was just making excuses, hoping that the other wanted him like Draco did.
“Okay.” With a nod from Snape as his response, he watched him turn dramatically and make his way back down the hallway. He waited until he was far enough gone as he bolted inside and made a beeline for his room, he had 2 hours.
“Who do you fucking belong too?”
“Muffliato.”
Before any of them could try and attempt to talk themselves into any more trouble, Harry was moving. Using his threatening aura to spook them all as he slowly made his way over, Draco refused to look back at him - scared that he’d just whimper on the spot and show Potter how much he was really affected by him. How much he secretly, down deep inside, liked him.
“Maybe this is happening because it was ingredients for a love potion but turned into a lust one, it wasn’t supposed to happen so as it changed from love to lust it might’ve got fucked up slightly along the way.”
He had caught him looking at his hard on, oh fuck. Harry had seen him practically drooling over the other’s cock, his cheeks flooded with colour from pure embarrassment as he quickly averted his gaze away from Potter’s enticing and dark eyes - choosing to stare at the very interesting floor instead.
Before he could even begin to think about what happened, Harry had covered Draco’s mouth with his own.
“God what did we do this time?” Ron whispered to Harry, as the other shrugged his shoulders. Hoping it wasn’t about his and Hermione’s talk outside, damn these walls were thin.
“Enjoying yourself there?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Anyway, when it kicked in more-“
He recognised it as Neville’s voice, the one who had ratted him out. Normally, he would’ve felt anger or a need for revenge residing in his stomach but the only thing he could feel at the moment was lust. And being honest with himself, he was feeling gratitude as without him; this may have never happened.
Draco was lightheaded as he watched Potter lean against the wall, his eyes trained on the blonde.
Draco whimpered again as his cloak was taken off of his body, Potter physically hadn’t touch him but the tingling sensation that had wrapped itself around his body made him realise that it was the other’s magic - his heart stammered in his chest. Never would he get tired of watching Potter do wandless magic. He watched as his cloak was hung up before he was once again, the centre of Harry’s attention.
“What a silly, pretty boy. You know full fucking well why I asked you here and we both know why you decided to come here. Now, don’t play dumb with me.”
“E-Either nothing o-or once P-no.” Draco’s entire body shivered under the dark gaze that was shot his way.
“Hermione, what on earth are you-“
That was until he heard someone clear their throat from behind him, he whipped around to meet a smirking Harry Potter. Oh merlin, he’d been thinking about what was going to happen for the past 2 hours and now that he was here, all he could do was stare at the other.
“Interesting.” Blaise joked back.
When Harry had the heart to look up, he saw Pansy Parkinson sitting on his table. God, he didn’t think he could use his voice right now. All she did was smile, warmly at him? Before winking towards Hermione, which made the girl blush slightly, as she made her way back to her seat. She was instantly sent a questioning look from Harry.
“Such a good boy for me, Draco.”
“Okay, Draco.”
“Unexpected yet surprisingly-“ Fred started.
He felt slightly unnerved at how all his friends were now just smirking at him, like they knew what was going on. Pansy winked at him before making a shooing motion with her hands.
Kneeling down, Draco ends up with a bigger mouthful than he ever expected to have.
Draco nodded at Potter’s words, getting slightly lost from his hypnotic voice. He was still a tad confused about how the ceiling became enchanted, the other understood the expression.
“-tease!” And George finished the yelling. The other’s could not even try to be annoyed at them for that as they all cackled, all except for Harry who was in a predicament right now.
Potter still hadn’t moved, allowing his intimidating presence to wash over Draco. The lust potions effects were still circulating in his body and overruling his mind, pleasure washed over his body in unyielding waves.
Malfoy’s arms were wrapped loosely around the other’s neck, his entire body full of warmth. Still in a little shock that he was kissing Harry Potter, the one he used to hate, used to be his enemy, now their lips were moving together in sync. So close that they couldn’t possibly be any closer.
“Absolutely.”
“There’s nothing to be nervous about, Harry. The worst thing that could happen is you and Draco have a duel in there, or that could be the best thing - depending on what kind of duel.” Hermione winked, revelling in the blush that dusted Harry’s cheeks. He gave her a nudge.
“I’ll see you later.” Harry picked up his cloak and swung over it over his shoulder, not even bothering to hear his friends’ responses as he winked at them and turned. Walking confidently out of the Great Hall, the grin that shook Draco to his core in the best way still played on his lips.
After he knew he was clean, he had immediately turned the temperature to cold. In order to physically stop himself from cumming, he knew the only thing that would work; was a cold shower.
“I smell a scent of bubbles, treacle tart and a woody scent - like from a broomstick handle.”
Potter was taunting him. Not in the usual way that he was used to though, this was incredibly different. This time, Potter was sexually taunting him. Draco whimpered, he tried to ignore just how many times - in the short time he’d been in the same room as the other - he’d whimpered. It’s not like he could help it though, he had lost control of his noises ever since they had locked eyes in the Great Hall.
But now…
"Well… no.."
"Touchy
He let's go of his nemesis jaw suddenly, and Draco stutters at the unexpected drop of his chin as he growls angrily.
Draco stiffens at her insinuation, and pushes her pointedly away, dusting off his rich green emerald robes as he shoots his friend a dark look.
"Well, on with it then, before the Gryffindor spontaneously combusts on us."
Harry's thoughts came to an abrupt halt when eyes caste on someone familiar coming in through the doors and his body stiffened automatically.
pants with need.
And Harry doesn't miss a beat.
Both Ron and Hermione stopped eating at the same time, glancing at the Slytherin with pointed looks but thankfully said nothing when Harry came up behind the smaller man and coaxed him to sit.
"I SAID you would like that. If

He whispered quietly, so as not to alert anyone but him.
The Gryffindor had two drops, and Draco assumes the same for himself, choking when half the bottle
Harry Potter was a Gryffindor, and he hated not having that power over everything; of ALWAYS being in control.
"Oh, fucking hell it's Moine, thank Merlin," the ginger breaths easily as he hurries to the door and further away from the madness and insanity.
He yelps in surprise, face blushing red in embarrassment before reality sits and he realizes the Gryffindor is the reason for his discomfiture.
"I-If you must know you nosy git, it was a spell book of sorts that deals heavily in Seducing and Wooing," Draco grits out between ground teeth as his fists ball up to his sides.
Harry couldn't help the warm feeling that spread through his body at the sight of that, but he didn't dare comment. It was highly inappropriate considering everything that had happened...and was currently happening.
Draco's eyes roll slightly back as he catches himself mid- arousal.
, Draco?"
A quiet whimper of need betrays the blonde as he can't help but feel his legs shake in anticipation against his will.
"S-Sorry Ron," Harry flushes as he shoots his friend an apologetic  frown.
"I- I think I got the forbidden book for you..."
He can feel the burning shame creep up in his throat as the mortified blonde tugs his body away from the loose grasp that the shocked brunette still had him in.
" he hisses with stormy eyes, hoping to deter the other man and finally be rid of him for the night.
was you, why am I not bloody well surprised. What is with you Potter, do you enjoy seeing me all bruised and mangled up or something?"
And boy, did he want to taste it.
"Ron!" Hermione beamed, attention drawing to her boyfriend and Harry hoped that would be the end of the discussion.
-please..." and god does he sound needy and wrecked; voice a wobbled strain.
Malfoy, not trusting his voice, shakes his head no as he can feel the poisoned truth bubbling and rushing to the surface.
Malfoy doesn't know.
The blondes not sure why Potter is reacting the way he is, choosing not to voice his thoughts which suited Ron just fine, still angrily throwing out insults, "God the sex between you and Pansy must be dreadfully boring."
He snapped, eyes growing stormy as he cast the most malicious glare at his nemesis.
Quirking an eyebrow, the brunette stretched high, broad shoulders moving high above the petite blonde as he holds the door open.
"What the hell are you doing?" Pansy hisses nervously, as she shoots both Gryffindor boys a perplexed look before falling perfectly in step with the blonde pure-blood as he continues walking forward, refusing to bend.
"Bloody hell, it's Filch," Pansy bulks, looking around frantically for somewhere- anywhere- to hide.
"Open."
He had been so worried that the Chosen One would
Harry freezes at his words, a look of horror breaking through the irate stance as Draco's skin burns hot to touch; a dark red against his snow white complexed skin as the Slytherin can do nothing more than sputter in mortification.
"Uh-huh…… right, SO anyway," her voice breaks loud, catching the attention of the other two boys in the room as Ron jumps with a start.
"Oh um, no, that was uh, me..." A quiet, almost shy, voice calls and Draco whips his head to the uncommon sound.
"Surprise, surprise. Why am I not shocked?

him, body spasming and jerking up in pleasure at the sound of Harry's voice on his skin; the way forbidden lips press against his flesh.
Unfortunately his nemesis was a Gryffindor and apparently being such meant not knowing when to bloody well back off.
"Perhaps you'll find out before me though Malfoy, what with your father's lovely connections and all," the mark hit's deep, the brunette cringing as he bites his lip in mortification; as if he can't believe what he just said himself.
He wants to sharply cut back, to put Potter in his place, but his delicate body shakes and he finds he can't trust his mouth to say the proper words so he chooses to say nothing, instead throwing his trademark scowl and hoping it would be suffice.
before Harry was stepping in, hand placed firmly on his mate's shoulder.

The gesture almost seems light-hearted, something that

"Well,
"What did you just say to me, you filthy-"
"Good one Weasley, come up with that one all on your own did you?" the voice is directed as cold, cutting and perfect for the tone he wants to portray.
Draco's hoping that if he's lucky enough, the Gryffindor might just ignore this entire awkward conversation.

"For the record, I'm blaming you 100% for all this."
"What?" It's the only thing he can think to say, mouth slightly agape in a not-so Malfoy fashion.
"Fuck you and your muggle loving family," The Slytherin seethed, making to get up before Pansy puts a well-placed hand on his knee, forcing him back down.
"You??" He says the pronoun tasting the way it feels on his tongue before he shakes his head in disbelief.
Harry may of saved the boy for an unholy act, but he had still acted like an asshole, enemy or not and as both boys headed inside Harry swore he would make an Unbreakable Vow if need be to set things right.
"What are you doing you idiot, are you trying to get us all caught?" and a harsh quiet whisper beckons as lips press against the edge of Draco's ear. He knows Harry isn't doing it on purpose, that there's simply no other place for him to move, but the knowledge doesn't stop the shivers that spark against Draco's body as he tries to calm his racing heart.
He's flustered, and he knows it, can tell by constant years of being teased by his friends of how 'pretty a shade' Draco turned when embarrassed. Pale ivory skin that left little to hide. Body pressed flush against body, Draco feels suddenly stiff, moving despite his best judgement as he realizes the position is now far worse then the first and is now faced with the reality that he's now forced to tilt his chin to rest his head on his nemesis shoulder or risk pressed lips against lips.
If Draco was

Harry knew he should of been understanding gathering everything that just happened. He knew if the roles were reversed Harry would of been just as equally embarrassed to have his nemesis come to his rescue as well.
He wants to thank Potter, and not because of the potion but because he genuinely wants to and is about to do
To love him...
"I… t-tell me, H-Harry?" and his heart clenches tight when it hits Draco just how bad he wants it.

Harry seems to neither care nor perhaps hear, eyes lazily drifting around before

The Slytherin thought with an edged smirk to his face.
No, rather the blonde was out of sorts with his current friend and HIS nemesis. The Slytherin girl didn't need any extra attention.
He's angry that he can't control what he says around his nemesis
"Your coming back to my room right the fuck now," Harry growls out darkly,

-cupping his hands as he sits snug on a charcoal black couch that complimented the white one that sat parallel that the Slytherin's had shacked up on.
Harry couldn't help but feel his heart begin to beat louder in his chest at the tone of Zabini's voice and the way Malfoy suddenly stiffened in discomfort.
"Go on, Draco," he whispered soothingly, and his tone seemed to finally ease the other man as he blinked gingerly, looking back up at Harry before averting his eyes shyly, as if afraid.
The blonde sputtered, coughing angrily as he pushes the offending potion away.
The reality of his situation, of being honest and vulnerable around his enemies, sits heavy in his mind.
Well, Draco refused to even acknowledge whatever Potter was doing or thinking.
Suddenly Blaise got an idea. Harry could tell by the way his eyebrows crinkled a slow smile struck out stupidly on his face. He had a thought, and hoped he didn't miscalculate.
He hated to admit it to himself, but the way Potter held so tight to his pale white wrist with barely a strain, well... Draco couldn't hide the disgust over the little rush of thrill that the Gryffindor was much stronger than he was.
The question worked, everyone ceasing laughter immediately.
And Draco Malfoy knows he should say... something, ANYTHING.
Malfoy. You still haven't explained what you two are doing outside past curfew..."
All in all, Harry liked girls...
At this the petite blonde turned positively beet red, glaring poisonous daggers at the girl.
"LET ME GO, LET ME FUCKING GO THIS INSTANT POTTER!"
He followed Harry's gaze to his face and gingerly placed a well-groomed hand on the corner of his eye, tracing it up to the side of his head. Sure enough, a nasty lump was
"I.. I'm not
He'd rather be best friends with Dudley Dursley then see Malfoy as anything more then the annoying prat that he was.
"Fucking sodding Potter. I swear-"
"Yes, well, we all can't be compulsive manipulators," Draco grumbled back, lips barely moving above a whisper.
"Me two, oh gods, me two
"No, I was thinking about you, you bloody git!" he snapped back, although no sooner had the words left does the blonde desperately wish he could take them back as his eyes widen in horror; clamping his hands over his mouth in a futile attempt.
"You fucking wish, Potter," he hisses back as he turns quickly, storming on his heels without once looking back.
She didn't appear mad, but
He hadn't been looking for it, hadn't asked for it, but somehow as if the room had known, it appeared.
Unfortunately all thoughts of escape soon depleted when he turned once more and realized he had reached a dead end.
Truthfully, he doesn't understand what's going on besides the complete helplessness of his situation…
The look doesn't last long as the blonde
The wand moves, steadfast and quick, and it takes everything in Draco's being not to bolt, as he digs his knuckles into the couch and waits.
Pansy's whispered words from earlier sit heavy on his chest as Draco snarls in denial to himself.
If anything it had the opposite reaction, Balise growling animalistically as he pressed a leg between the blonde's thighs, prying them apart. He let's go of one of his hands, using one arm to still force Malfoy's wrists above as the other moves Over eagerly, roughly pressing and touching where ever he saw fit as Malfoy squirmed at the feeling.

as he squeezes his hands firmly together.
A beat of silence passed before the group, Malfoy still too terrified to say anything, and Blaise's smile turned to a frown as he started to piece together that he had guessed wrong. He was still holding onto Draco, almost as if a human shield, and Harry had to think quick if he wanted to get Blaise without hurting the other pure-blood.

The blonde's heart was beating irrationally, and he swallowed dryly, forcefully closing his mouth into his trademark scoff as he realized he had been panting.
"Yeah. So what of it?"
From the corner of his eye he saw Pansy turn slightly, hugging herself close. He almost felt bad.
bemused and mortified with his enemy's words.
Fingers curl around the perfectly tailored and pressed pants that clung to the Slytherin in all the right way, as Blaise hungrily drinks up how small and weak the blonde looks underneath him as he slides a finger down the front of Draco's pants, teasing the hair just above his naval before moving further down, stroking against the inside of Malfoy's clothes. An unwanted whimper escapes from scared lips as Blaise finally responses to the threat.
"Nothing wrong with looking good Potter," Draco sits straighter, trying to present an air of confidence even if his reality feels like it's crumbling from the inside out.

His gesture is frantic, but the boy finds a way to not only cover the emotion up well but also remain eloquent through the whole process as he finally bites the bullet and looks at the brunette that remains a constant torment in his life.

Harry cups the lithe blonde's sharp chin in his hand,  a finger running lightly against his skin as he forces stormy grey eyes to look at him. “I can tell. You're the perfect little fuck toy, aren’t you?" the voice is harsh and husky as he laughs darkly at the way the Slytherin boy is responding to his words.
