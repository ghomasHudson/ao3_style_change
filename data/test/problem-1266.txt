Potter nods, then takes the shrunken bag of Tasha's items and resizes it to the correct dimensions.
-----
The velvet drawstring -protected with a cushioning charm- takes up most of the counter. Potter undoes the tie and takes a look inside.
I can't stop it. My heart picks up its pace and I feel unbalanced.
The muggle paper had a section where they gave out jobs as well. Most of the listing asked for a telephone call, which was a box Muggles got into and used a machine to talk. I couldn't quite figure out to make the machine work or where to enter the listed numbers.
Sitting on the ugly green corduroy couch at Hermione and Ron's, I turn my tea in my hand nervously as 'Mione sits down.
Luna laughs, a sound as light as bubbles, "This shop has theft charms just like the others in Diagon. Though perhaps I should go back down in case anyone needs help. You can look at anything, none of the doors are locked, Cousin."
I sigh and plonk down onto the sofa, hands scrubbing down my face and my 5 o'clock shadow scratches my palms.
"Years of obsession. You can't deny your part either." He tosses out as if it were nothing, "Malfoy, why would you want me to have Tasha? You've had her with you since fifth year, you can't just give her away. And to me of all people?"
I tried to make her as comfortable as possible, bringing food and blankets for her and the other prisoners when I could and sending a house elf when I couldn't.
Finally, the door unlocked and Potter hauled it open, only for me to thrust a familiar white snake into his face.
I glance over at Draco to see his soft smile and gleaming eyes as he strokes Tasha's scales. His face is open and relaxed, long fingered hands lightly petting the content snake. His longish hair is falling over his forehead in fluffy white locks.
"Don't tell me to calm down, Potty!"
"Harry." She scolds, looking slightly terrifying, "You're telling me that
I find a seat and the rest of the people swipe their cards, filing down the aisle. The bus doors slam closed and the large machine roars before pulling onto the road.
We're sat at a booth, directly across from one another and Draco is biting his lips, wide eyes panning around the restaurant in curiosity. A lamp hangs over the table and the booths, the floor, the walls are all rich and vibrant in a way that makes me rethink my style choices for Grimmauld.
Draco nods and a painful stretch of silence forms. I want to breakout and say, 'Draco, you're so pretty. I dunno when I started to think of you this way but I suspect it was longer ago then I care to admit.' And then take his face in my hands and kiss him.
The Kneazle pads calmly to the center of the room and lays down on the floor, licking one of its shiny black paws and I hop around in pain, clutching the door knob.
I turn back to the oven, looking at the rich meal and a wave of doubt hits me.
?" My face screws up and I realize I’ve yet to right my tilted glasses. Luna smiles serenely and holds Tasha close to her, "Her bodies here but her mind's not. Something must have come up and she with whoever she's bonded to."
Her face turns pissed and she snaps, "I can hear that bell from my office you know. And it's never busy on a Wednesday."
in a bubbly font and cute creatures surrounding it. A variety of noises from a wild assortment of magical beasts fills the shop, some wrought iron cages full of pastel pygmy puffs and others completely empty. The shop is free of towering shelves and light bathes the interior.
"You're welcome. Now, tell me the rent price."
The night bus should be illegal. It should have been the first thing taken out in the reforms, without a doubt.
"So you're doing this just annoy me? Don't you have a girlfriend or something to torment." I feel tormented alright. My heart, mind, and cock are never on the same page.
With a final Scourgify of the capybara's filthy excrement pool, I toss of my apron and run to the loo. My appearance is just as bad as I figured.
this job.
"Calm down!" Potter says earnestly and it fills me with molten rage.
Draco nods, hands still plastered over his face.
Hope you enjoyed! Bookmark, kudos, and comment plz.
I shake my confusion away, shrugging her silliness off with a laugh, "
Like the interior of Grimmauld being restored, Draco is beautiful potential. He just needs proper care and encouragement to rebuild himself in a better light. If only I could nurture him and help him be his real self.
I think back to Tasha for comfort, to slow my thundering heart.
He puffs out his thin chest, "A Muggle coffee shop. I figured it would be the best shot as it's only a short walk from my flat."
"Has she been eating?" I ask Potter, going to sit on the sofa and my eyes fly wide at the steaming dishes resting on the coffee table. It smells
Draco's a warm and solid weight but feels unreal because
When will this nightmare ever end?
I stop and squat down, "Come on, I'll carry you."
Or while I lick the water droplets off of him, greedily tracing my fingers over his prominent V muscles until they met the soft white towel.
She croaks out a distorted hoot and lifts her leg once more for Potter to hold with his own manly fingers.
in here."
I need a job to get her back. Even with the hefty price I calculated for Potter's rent, I can't rely on him. I can't rely on anyone.
She bustles out of the hallway and pauses with a frown, "Charles, I thought I told you to show Draco here the ropes?"
His pointy nose wrinkles, "Is the tube like the floo? And no, I don't have a bus pass. Only Muggles are offered one."
I'm greeted with a dirt pile and rat bones that had been hiding underneath the beast which I Scourgify with a snap of my fingers.
I rest my head against the grubby window just in time for the rumbling bus to screech to a halt. I brace myself against the driver’s seat back, then shoot to my feet and towards the exit.
I just want to feel safe.
When Draco sees Tasha his scowl melts into a stunning smile and he rushes over to take the almost uncontrollable snake from me. She happily winds around his neck and face, hissing happy sounds right into his ear. He throws his head back and lets out a snorting laugh.
A muggle coffee shop wasn't ideal. I don't even drink coffee, having been raised on the ever-sensible Earl Grey with the occasional expensive Oriental tea for variety.
, what's that smell?"
I straighten my robes and walk over to the tall, loud men.
I turn on the shower and wait for it to warm up as I begin the process of removing my fur coat as well as the two layer of clothing underneath.
I almost made a mistake.
Snakes with healthy, thick bodies are curled up inside hides and laid out for me to see the richly patterned scales and severe faces. A tank of tiny vipers mists water all on its own, coating the live plants with droplets for the high humidity the brightly colored vipers require.
Draco
And Potter.
"Potter knows best does he? No more wine then." I scoff and slump down in the seat. Potter laces his fingers together and rests his chin on top of the knot, doltish grin aimed towards me.

I stroke Tasha's scales and hold her close to my chest as I Apparate back to Grimmauld Place.

I turn to the elderly Muggle woman sitting on the bench, "Is the bus usually this tardy?"
"Take her."
I crouch down and give my hand to the big bird and it hops away before boldly hopping up.
I nod along despite the growing sense of panic, glancing over to Charles who's looking directly down at me with a curled lip.
I want to wrap up in my blankets with the comforting presence of my snake and sleep for a year. I'm so tired of everything. My cold apartment, my shoddy meals, the constant struggle of living. I just want a bloody job. I want to feel the ground underneath my feet, grounded instead of free falling.
"I enjoy riling you up and having a bit of fun after all the years of fighting. Nobody gets under my skin quite like you."
." Tasha hisses in a whining tone and I wave a hand to the bathroom door.
I was a lot more thorough in editing this chapter! Also, I don't live in the UK so the language is not 100% percent accurate. I hope you enjoyed the chapter! And Draco's shower wank ;)))
The owl that was perched on his head earlier swoops down in a wave of feathers and lands on Potter's strong shoulder. Now that I’m closer it looks...not unpleasant but definitely strange. The small owls’ feathers are half molted, patchy bald spots showing on its breast, and its expression is that of a young crup. It lifts one clawed leg and holds it in the air, balancing on only one knobby leg now.

The urge to run was growing inside of me, but I have no place to run to. I'm quite literally holding my house in my lap.
"That's a decent idea. I'll set the price and we can decide installments later. But I have one thing I'd like to add."
"You alright there, Malfoy?"
I drag a hand through my hair, groaning aloud in the empty room, the sound echoing off of the bare floor and old windows.
A rich, well bodied smell comes from the new oven and I open the door to check up on the two dishes inside. The
I stare down at the apron and the name tag I had failed to notice, turning red.

"YOU IDIOT, JUST BECAUSE ANNIE WOULDN'T PUT UP YOU, YOU GIANT
.....
The door chimes and a large gaggle of young Muggles comes in, loud laughs echoing.
"Come to the living room and I'll go get her," I offer and he agrees stiffly, combing his untidy hair with his fingers to smooth it.
I wanted to know what was so vastly different about him, why I couldn't ignore him, why he wouldn't leave my brain.
"No, I’m not!" I say, panicked.
The Night Bus takes off and Draco turns green in the face as the beds shift and tumble about. He clutches onto me and closes his eyes.
So, so nice and strong. Perfect Harry.
It doesn't add up in my head. Though I am speaking to a snake and a playful one at that.
with the whole worlds respect,
And I have a job interview today.
"Alright, I'll be back here next week, same day unless something happens." He breaks the shake off and gives me a tight-lipped smile.
Once the snake is handed over, Potter lays her over his shoulders and wordlessly conjurers a Gringotts bank note and muggle ballpoint pen.
"Hmm," She tucks her curly, chin length hair behind her ears, "I recommend you have seven kids then."
I wanted his insults back. His mocking jokes and defiant stares, when he still thought he was a prince and ruling by divine right.
Draco
I unbutton my wrinkled shirt and tear it off, tossing it across the room and unstrap the leather wand holster encasing my left arm.
"Door's open!" In the staticky background Ron cut off as he calls hello.
Draco
Its bowl is empty so I refill it and check its litter box in hopes that it will be soiled.

. If you must know, I had the single worst interview known to man. My coworker hated me at first sight, I broke a machine, and the manager slipped and barreled into me in the resulting puddle. I've had a headache ever since."
All cleaning, shrinking, and vanishing spells have had no effect on the oven. It seems to have been a part of the house for so long that it holds all of the same protections. Just as I can't Bombarda a wall for a more open floorplan, I can't alter the stove.
I wonder how Hermione and Ron would take it if I did.
Oh, Merlin he's perfect.
him. Despite how totally wrong it is of me. I don't deserve him. Or his misplaced kindness. I'm a wreck, a ruined boy with no family or prospects.
He follows me into the living room and immediately spots the terrarium, "Did you have trouble setting it up? What about the daytime bulb?"
?" I shout, pulling Tasha from around my neck and wrapping her seized body around my arm. Even the jostling of Apparating didn't snap her out of her fixation.
Hermione chose to work at the Ministry for this reason, as well as giving rights back to creatures and reform.
I could just go by Potter's later. If the interview goes well.
I ungracefully kick out of my jeans and leave them in a puddle beside the bed. Now in just my pants, I slip underneath the dark covers.
"Stop looking at me like that!" I shout and a dam bursts inside me, anger and grief and worry overflowing, spilling out as daggers aimed towards him. Always him.
. I thought it was interesting."
The burning tightness in my chest softens its grasp. I'll be able to have my own place, to be on my own for the first time in my life.
I see Potter in the mornings usually, he stops by to check on the owls and help Luna with different tasks. I'm not sure whether I'm thankful or not that we rarely speak, but I know that it is for the best.
"Did you eat all of your food?" I ask the cat/Kneazle, checking it's food and water in procrastination of going out. Luna gave me a bag of Kneazle food since she hasn't rescued or contacted a breeder and it was gathering dust.
"Wha'd you think strippin' means?"
Hope you enjoyed and if you like my writing check out the drabble I just posted before this chapter :) It's not in the same story as this but on its own. Bookmark, Kudos, and comment plz!
"I work all day at the Ministry, Ron, and both you and Harry do as you please." Hermione leans back in her seat with an exasperated breath.
I nod along and Luna beams, "Do you want to see the reptiles now? They have space all on their own upstairs though I have to keep them separate. They're very territorial, you know."
I eventually still and stare blankly up at the high ceiling for a moment, before I haul myself up. I look dazedly at my cum on the clean sheets then spell it away wandlessly and fall back to the pillows.
It was
Dean looks at me as if I've lost my mind. Seamus elbows him harshly and sends him a pointed, stone faced glare.
"So you found an apartment? Where?"
"Just have her alright?" I end on a broken note and, Merlin's saggy tits, a strangled sob bursts free from my chest.
A deep sickening sensation has enveloped my chest and I force myself to stop crying. Disgusted at my own self-pity, I stand and break the warding spell. With notorious Malfoy mannerisms intact, I prepare myself to Apparate and get the exchange over with already.
"What? I said I would go. I want to."
The front face of the Indian place blends in seamlessly with it's undeniably English neighbors, but for the large window showing the inside.
"How?", I ask perplexed, the question applying to so many different things.
The machine makes an angry, steam-filled noise. I find the correct lever and pull hard, hot liquid jetting out and- knocking the cup over. Hot liquid splashes all over my stomach and I yell, jumping away as the machine still shoots liquid out. The Muggle swears loudly behind me, "Need help, mate?"
"I don't want to say that he's
Not that this is a formal dinner.
Finally, he sets the last cup down and turns to me, "Did you get that?"
Potter is-
I really don't want to see Potter right now.
I make it to Ollivander’s old building unscathed and I pause a moment to take in the beautifully reworked exterior. The twin bay windows are bright and the stone is polished, fantastic birds sit in the large windows on each side of the door and the sign simply declares
I unbuckle my trousers and kick them off clumsily, rubbing a hand over my half-hard cock and biting back a moan.
"I don't have another lined up at the moment. I'll probably try the next closest shop."
I stumble as she drags me a few steps down the hall, glancing back at Draco who hovers awkwardly, I say, "You can stay with Tasha as long as you like, you know."
And I didn't want to risk talking with my mouth full in front of Draco- he is a Malfoy after all.
I hold the door open for Draco and he passes by with a faint smile, the intense aroma engulfing us.
He scrawls the information quickly and slides it towards me, "500 Gallons even. For the bag and all."
The business was down the street from my apartment building and quaint. It was on the corner and the front was made of glass, a sign above it reading 'The Java Bean' in a squiggly font and a charming little coffee bean to the side.
I exit the house, footsteps lighter with the promise of tomorrow and the rest of me weighing heavy with the anxiety of yet another job interview to potentially botch.
Imagining someone beside me, waking up in the morning next to, and spending the day with always makes a warm feeling unfurl in my chest. Tangling my limbs with another pair in sleep, holding someone close, my arms wrapped around their stomach.
I toss my jersey onto the bed and reach for a old, paint-splattered T-shirt. Tasha immediately darts for the jersey I discarded, diving into it and curling up into a content ball. The whole 90 centimeters of her doesn't quite fit, the bottom half of her body hanging out of the neck.
Draco is looking at me as if I've done gone around the corner.
"Stop it or I will ruin your face." I groan. Not sure if I want to hit him or kiss him. In a Muggle restaurant no less, what a disgrace I am.
A pathetic sniffle escapes me and I grab my wand from my forearm holster and Apparate to Grimmauld Place.
"I've always liked you Potter. You're just the right type of handsome."
this can't be the place."
The owls are in a large aviary at the back of the store, the space was a strip of concrete between Diagon Alley and the windowless backs of Muggle buildings. The concrete's been spelled to grass and a large tree sits in the center, fed both by magical and natural light. The birds sit on the branches and play on rope toys all day long, owls of all different sizes and colors coexisting until they are adopted.
"I came for a job interview.
that has a presence of its own.
He's carrying me as if I'm no heavier than a house elf. An airy laugh works it's way out of my mouth and he squeezes my legs, "What're you laughing about?"
"Oh." I turn back to my magazine, cheeks warm. Uncomfortable, I change the subject, "I was thinking about the kitchen. It is one of the most important rooms in the house and it's barely useable now. There's no place for the fridge and even if I knew how to use the stove, it's ancient and would burn the place down anyway."
It's Charles, looking on in shock.
I stumble back a step, almost tripping over my hideous, moth-eaten carpet bag.
Words clipped and bleeding together in rich tones, sharp and soft and I wonder what he would sound like saying my name.
I hurry down stairs to let her in and near trip when I hear my name called from the direction of the living room.
Draco looks at me with fire in his grey eyes, but it didn't burn like anger, but passion. "What do you mean you can't? Why aren't you like everyone else? Why do you have to be so
I step aside and she floats past with a pleasant smile.
When I sit down at the wobbly table and finally take a bite of the unappetizing breakfast, I screw my face up and immediately go in search of the salt.
Ron takes the oven mitts off his hands and snorts, "I'm betting two galleons he was a right ponce, right Harry?"
out of the oven and set it beside the
Luna sighs softly, grabs my arm and drags me out of Grimmauld and Apparates to the Portkey site, taking me by forceful side along.
Draco's voice is warm in my ear, "It's awful. Whatever dignity I possessed has been crushed."
"What happened?"
This seems too good to be true, working in an actual Wizarding shop with someone I admire no less. There are too many variables that can go wrong to get my hopes up.
Unable to return to the formerly lazy afternoon activities, I shut off the telly and settle Tasha is my old Quidditch jersey for warmth.
Harry. You have hearts for eyes when you talk about him. Even Ron noticed."
I jog to the door and breathe a deeply before opening the door with a smile.
"Erm- it's this way," I say, a touch awkwardly. Draco silently nods, following me out of the Apparation point and into Muggle London.
The door cracks open and I ignore Harry's voice, waiting for it to open all the way.
I could have said any of these things and they would have all been true. But what would my opinion matter when the rest of the Wizarding World praises him, but a drop in the ocean of praise Potter must receive on the daily.
breeder with Luna.
"Didn't you wash your hands?" I ask, picking up a piece of deeply seasoned meat and taking my first bite. The flavor was brilliant, making me want to shove the whole thing in my mouth, but the spice already setting my throat on fire cautioned otherwise."
Taking Draco to a restaurant didn't have to be a date...right? Just friends experiencing something new together. In a friendly way.
Harry's eyes sparkle behind his ridiculous, round wire frames, "Thank you. "
Suddenly, he began jumping up and down and I had to plaster myself to him to keep from falling, "Stop!"
I've lost my bloody mind.
"Yes, he's engaged to be married to Daphne Greenglass and told me Parkinson is living in America now. Can you imagine?"
I drag myself to my bed and fall on top of the mound of blankets, burying my head until I can't breathe.
?" I think and she gives a rumbling hiss as acknowledgment.
The warmth in my chest spreads until I can't help smiling at her, "Thank you, 'Mione. And I doubt Draco's gay so nothing will probably come of this. But I accidentally invited him out to eat and I'm not sure what to do besides panic."
His lips look dry, I notice, the thought barely registering but filling my brain at the same instant.
I've got a problem. Sixth year all over again.
He smirks and the doorbell chimes with a customer.
Hermione shoots Ron a look and he huffs before sitting down at the table. The food looks delicious, the smell thick and unmistakably a Weasley recipe and three plates and butterbeers were already set out.
I laugh and run a hand through my hair, working it free after my tangles catch, "Easier said then done."
She has a strange look on her face, like she's trying to bury a smile, hiding behind the magazine.
I grin boldly, "Brilliant."
. Where's Tasha?"
For this being the first Indian dish I've cooked, it’s a rich red brown and smells amazing. I'll have to thank Parvati if it tastes anything like I hope it will.
I set down my fork, "Hermione, you
this, I think while I scrub shampoo into my scalp. Despite what Draco always said, I do in fact wash and comb my hair. It's simply unmanageable and I don't bother with it most of the time.
The idea has only hit my brain a moment before my fingers are in my mouth and I'm coating them in spit, rubbing them over my hole. I grab the pillow with one hand to rut into it properly and with the other I work a spit-slick finger up my arse.
"Um-yes. I just rented a flat." I say. Technically, I am a new citizen of Muggle London.
Charles slams into my shoulder as he passes by, "Hurry the fuck up, shorty."
I snort, slapping the magazine at her, "Oh shut it. I think I want to do the kitchen before we start on the guest room. You should’ve seen the look Malfoy had on his face. Though it could've been aimed at the microwave, I'm not sure."
"Not until you apologize!"
"I don't have any food for you."
I laugh as Ron sulks and Hermione cracks a smile.
I was the Great Squid if it had been dumped in the Forbidden Forest; out of my element and helpless.
I arrive home at ten p.m., worn out and my feet aching. I toe off my boots and toss my jacket back onto the arm of the couch. I check in on Tasha who sleeps curled up on top of a rock and switch to her darker, nighttime bulb.

Draco
I drop my hands, feet itching to make my escape through the Floo before Potter comes back. I shouldn't have come inside in the first place, even if the door was unlocked. Potter didn't appear to be home and the sooner Tasha was returned the easier the transfer is back into her own body. Without a consciousness, her body is vulnerable and can't function as it's supposed to.
"That was what I was going to say. That you're very good with them."
Wherever she is, I just hope Draco's alright.
, gather my map, and Apparate.
Draco looks up at me and the distance between us feels to large. I can just see his pale eyelashes and the slight wear on his fancy purple robes. The delicate curve of his jaw would fit wonderfully in my hands, to tilt his aristocratic face to look up at me.
It watches me with wise eyes, cocking it's ears as I scratch its back.
"No, but in some sections of the city there is. Lots of people take it because it's faster than a bus."
Everything is coated in dust and clearly in the midst of remodeling.
"I saw Pansy Parkinson yesterday at the Ministry," Dean said, "She was just released from her house arrest I heard."
I receive mail proclaiming affections and disturbing marriage proposals daily. My stomach turns at the thought of
I sit up and straighten my robes to cover my legs. The Muggle vehicle is gone as if I had never seen it in the first place. Street lights have switched on in the time that I’ve lain on the ground.
"Hello, Draco," I say and step aside to let him in, he glances at me nervously, cheeks pale and nose red from the cold.
Harry
"My bed's been laid now I will lie in it. Now take her."
I sigh and pat my pockets one more time to make sure I have everything; I won't come unprepared and if that means bringing two pairs of dragon-hide gloves, so be it.
Potter's making sense. The dolt is being more rational and...and adult-like than most actual adults. His tone holds authority, but not like Father's. Despite the rivalry between us, he's being level headed.
I groan in annoyance at myself, squeezing my shaft before lightly slapping it. My teeth catch my bottom lip as I try to contain my moan, eyes darting over to the pillow.
TWELVE
"I would tell you how good it tastes, but I don't think I'll be able to taste anything for the next week." I say, pushing my numb tongue against the roof of my mouth. It may be a good thing if I have to many more egg meals, I don't add.
"Fine, have it your way," He huffs with a faint smile and climbs awkwardly onto my back.
I fall onto my duvet and take off my glasses, resting them on the nightstand. My old Quidditch jersey is still on my bed, so I set it aside to put in Tasha's terrarium tomorrow.
ogle Potter’s back as he retreats. He could completely cover me up if he were to lay on top of me, his sturdy weight pinning me down and strong muscles keeping me there.
Merlin and Morgana, he's perfect.
I shrug my robe off onto the ground and root through the piled-up clothes and blankets on my bed for a warm jumper, which I slip over my head. The sleeves come down over my hands and the hem hits my mid-thighs, but I can't make myself resize it even if I look like a house elf.
Carefully, I fill the order, cap it, and set it on the tray. My confidence gaining, I grab another cup and face a more complicated machine, painstakingly pressing buttons.
"Just move to London?" The bus driver asks, stuffing his mouth with something from a flat tin.
I had researched extensively about Muggle job interviews, even formulating my own pretend work experience. The list was impressive, though not overly so.
I trail my shaking right hand over the brand, teeth grinding not from pain, but lack of sensation. My fingertips registered the feel of flesh, yet I feel nothing in my arm where the tattoo lies.
I push back from the counter before she can reach me and cross my arms over my aching chest, spitting archly, "She's a snake, of course she doesn't whistle."
"Been busy." He replies shortly.
Maybe Hermione wasn't mistaken, she is after all the smartest witch I know. Maybe Draco is bent.
The owl, Matilda, lets out a throaty quacking noise and Potter steps back, "'Tilda, do you need some water?"
He groans and gets up from his chair, "Fine. I'll show him how to work the machines, alright?"
"Could you pick me up? My magic's usually tired after all day there. I really don't want to splinch myself, I've heard it's quite bad." Draco laughs softly.
My fingers dig into my palms as I trail behind him.
"Perhaps Harry can tell you? He's more familiar with Muggle things than I am."
Guilt rots inside me, a simmering sick guilt that floods my throat like I'm about to lose my stomach. I'm worse than the crowds of pining witches fawning over Potter, desperate to sink their claws into the Savior.
Another chapter! Kinda late but considering I don't have a set schedule can it be late?
Hollowly, I nod and take a seat on a stool, carpet bag pressed tight to my hollowed-out chest. Potter rearranges Tasha and goes about making tea both wandlessly and wordlessly.
The tall man startles, "Oh! You're here for that? Uh, Kevin doesn't swing that way..."
? And Tasha?"
Scraping them off the skillet is harder than I thought. Once the over cooked eggs are plated, I throw the pan in the sink to wash up later and turn the water on for the baked-on egg to soak. Steam instantly hits my face and knuckles. I yelp and grab my hand, before thinking to shove it under the still running cold water.
With a sigh I kick my robes underneath the bed and toe off my shoes, limping sock-footed across the freezing floor to the bathroom. My ankle stings sharply with each step. I'll have to cast a warming charm on it or wrap it with something for stability.
The feeling of rebirth rampant throughout the Alley feels stale and moldy to me, aware that I'm undeserving and unwelcome. I slip through the crowd, darting through tight spaces, grateful for my small, easily unnoticed body. Covered head to toe in a cloak spelled to be oversized, I am indistinguishable from any other witch or wizard.
He shakes his head hard and his hair, longer than I had ever seen it, untucks from his ears and frames his face. "My new flat is a nightmare compared to this."
A small spark of admiration spells a Lumos in my chest.
I fish the address from a pocket inside the robe and begin the trial of deciphering the muggle address system.
"You are such a pretty cat," I say with a loud laugh, rolling onto my back to look at the ceiling and remembering seeing Harry's smiling face. Smiling at me. So tall and dark and handsome.
All I have to say is that the next chapter you guys are going to love and it's not even what you're thinking lol.

Why is he so calm? Where is the Potter I knew from school? I could always count on finding a fight with him but now...he's grown up and I’ve become a pathetic mess.
Only in my socks and joggers I hurry inside the old wandmaker's shop. Front windows are now full of brilliantly colored birds and ‘

which read 7:49. The sun had mostly set, making everything dusky but not dark.
Luna cocks her head to the side, "Are you sure it's a Kneazle? You live among muggles so it may be a cat."
A small watery sound slips from my mouth and I roughly swipe the hot tears from my cheeks.
I stop, looking around as I try to orient myself. The towering shelves of dusty wand boxes are gone and instead a wide-open space and high ceiling allows the light to shine through. Countless numbers of animals make their own unique calls, mixing together into

It's turned dark out- not an ideal time to ride the subway- and I make it a point to not Apparate with any alcohol in my system. The night bus is the most logical and fastest route home.
The bus seat is unpleasant, sticking against my robes and the window is cracked halfway, letting cold twilight air flood inside.
He shakes his head, crossing his arms and snaps with a glare, "Don't spell me,
I shift, uncomfortable on the previously very comfortable couch. "The tears didn't start until a bit later..."
Luna hasn't changed at all, her expression earnest and her day-dreamy words holding no motive. I'm more than happy to call her my cousin regardless of her blood purity. How I didn't find out our shared family tree before the war I have no clue, as much as I had to study my family’s history and how similar the two of us look.
Potter freezes in surprise before a goofy grin appears, "I'm not sure if I should be insulted or not. Draco...are you drunk?"
It doesn't react so I slowly close the door and skirt around the perimeter of the room, shuffling over my bed to get to the kitchen where the cold box hangs open, avoiding the threatening Kneazle.
Draco rushes over to inspect it and seems to deflate seeing she's not there. I took a trip down to Luna's new shop in Olivander's old building the day after Draco dropped her off.
Potter nods along and I move closer to the counter, letting Tasha slide her smooth scales along my hand and twist around my arm.
Anything more than an hour could be harmful to her, but how can I teach differently when it's her instinct?
Potter's shadow envelopes mine and I glance up into his face to see him focused on me with a faint smile. Dark stubble defines his jaw and I can barely see the silver scar branching across his forehead for the untamed waves of his hair.
No one is paying attention to Luna practically announcing me over the sound of the animals but my heart seizes all the same. I rush over to the desk with my head down and hiss, "Luna, not so loud!"
"Marvelous," I sigh reaching into the cold box to retrieve the carton of eggs. With my luck the owners will beat down my door at two o'clock in the morning.
"Tasha?"
The side walk I land on is, Morgona blessed, deserted. The crup is still barking far off and the houses are all lit up but motionless.
The cats laid out on my bed asleep, shedding it's black hair all over my silk pillow and blissfully unaware of the churning doubt inside of me. It's been a constant presence in the apartment and besides for the mystery of the empty litter box the cat is halfway decent. Most of the time it's sleeping, completely ignoring me even as I bleached the apartment in a manic cleaning spree.
Blankets Mrs. Weasley knitted are piled up on the couch. I grab an armful of them and toss them into the hall closet before scanning the living room for any other easily solved mess.
" She seems more curious than panicked.
I cast the spell, throwing the weight of my magic through my wand until the stubborn stove quivers and gives up with a
"So you don't have a job? If you want you can work with me. I have been meaning to hire someone but I've been too busy." She says to Draco.
"He doesn't have to, Luna," Draco mumbles to the floor and I feel bad a moment before I remember my reasons. I can't pretend to be his friend when I want more, it wouldn't be healthy for me or fair to him.
It's not even a proper job, I
Draco sits up straighter, if possible, "I finished my research and know about what a snake like her costs. Are...are you sure you want to rent her? You could just get another animal like you said."
I blink at Harry, "What?"
I laugh and his arms snake around my chest for a better grip. I try not to be paranoid about him feeling the racing of my heart.
I don't know what time Luna's shop opens so I decide to leave at eight which gives me plenty of time to worry about my appearance and cook three breakfasts- the first one having burnt, the second batch of eggs not being totally unsalvageable, and the third plate of eggs being for the Kneazle.
Draco blinks, then frowns, "I've been cleaning animal cesspools all day and now I need to eat with my

The heat in my throbbing cock becomes unbearable and I moan loud enough to echo in the shoddy room, spilling over the shower floor and imagine that dark hand speeding up, milking me 'till I’m over sensitive.
"Do you still have your bird? That large snowy owl?" I ask, composing myself.
The transfer of Tasha isn't an easy one. She's a smart snake, incredibly so as her breed is quite magical, and seemed to pick up on the switch of residence. She slithers up my arm faster as Potter lifts her belly to reel her in. Potters warm hands were perfect for snake handling while I had to cast warming charms on mine for Tasha's comfort.
"Why aren't you clothed!"
The back of my head slams on the counter before I fall to the ground, Tammy sprawled on top of me. I yelp, shoving her off, the coffee on the floor burning my back. She scrambles up and reaches for the lever as a loud as the machine starts a loud beeping. It doesn't give, so she bangs her palm into the side of the machine and it sputters.
"You're very..." I stop myself from finishing the sentence. The sun hitting Potters eyes lights the green on fire, his serious expression of his handsomely rugged face offset by the feather still perched in his raven curls.
"Parvati Patil?" Draco asks and I nod slowly, uncertain about the look on his face.
And I've always been curious about my Indian half, having little experience with that culture. I've never been especially close to Padma and the only real interaction I had with her was the awkward date to the Yule Ball fourth year. It was nice to see her though and she, like many others, is getting married in a few months.
," I say again, this time in Parseltongue and give her a shake. She doesn't react still.
Light footsteps approach and I collect myself just in time to see Luna Lovegood followed by Potter still in his towel. Water drips down his neck from his soaked black hair and kisses his wonderful pecs.
"Oh," I look anywhere but him, cheeks reddening. He has the snake now, I should just leave. Good riddance.
My apartment has been cleaned spotless and the nervous energy rushing through my veins has yet to cease.
, I think,
Hermione freezes while unwinding her scarf, "You're helping him?"
. I've always been a scared coward and I always will be.
"So, uh, hows your cat?" I ask, cringing at myself even as I do so.
I dash off to the large room and spell the mountain of magazines off the coffee table and to beside the fireplace where building materials are piled.
I decide to stop beating around the bush, letting my words fall out in an unobstructed rush.
"Are you ready to go?" Potter asks and I hesitantly nod.
But it's worse than ever and I don't know what to do.
to make up for the lack of affection. Now I have nothing.
Not wanting to linger on the street, I open the door and go inside.
"Yes, of course." I say, nervous excitement bubbling inside.
They would step out of the glass stall with a loosely wrapped towel and fight me for mirror room. Carefully spelling their hair dry, they would slip into one of my larger shirts for bed which would come down to their pale thighs. I would finish up my teeth and catch them around their waist. Tugging their back into my chest and pressing a kiss to their neck and they laugh and push me away.
"OH MY LO- DRACO!" I look up to see Tammy running over, and it's like a time spell was cast as she slips over the coffee on the floor and crashes into me.
Hope you enjoyed! Draco's first job interview...was a surprise. Everything that could go wrong did lolol. Next chapter will have a whole lot more Draco/Harry dialogue and don't forget Tasha...
"Night bus. I don't Apparate when I've been drinking and the Tube isn't too friendly at night." I can feel his heart underneath my palm, the beat strong and comforting. I wish I could rest my head there and listen to the rhythm.
"Should be cooler now, I forgot to take the
I turn and near trip over myself to get back indoors, hopeless when it comes to Harry Potter and his...
I duck my head, glasses knocking sideways, and Tasha turns to stone. Her muscled body clenches around my shoulders and arm, her head hovering, unmoving.
That eagle owl swoops down and snatches up a white rat, bringing back memories of my own owl. I lost Hyperion a few weeks before the Yule Ball Fourth Year. Some Gryffindors cursed him after I sent him off with a letter, I could see them below on the castle grounds but couldn't tell who they were besides them being older. Father gifted me Tasha soon after, but I still missed the large owl.
"Uh..." Potter nonsensically says, but I feel Tasha's weight leave my arms and she -no doubt- gleefully receives Potters attention.
And I need to deposit Potter's check into my painfully small account so I can transfer it into muggle money.
His cheeks fill up a pretty pink and I can feel my heart expand.

She waves her hands, "Oh no, no, love. This isn't that kind of place. We're family owned and operated. Hands on is the only way to test the fit!"
and I Apparate off the doorstep and into the center of my apartment where I trip over my robes and bash my knees into the hard flooring.
I laugh out loud at her picking up his scent so quickly. I scoop her up and she wiggles like a happy puppy in my arms.
Luna steps forward and wraps Draco in a hug, her sharp chin resting on his shoulder, heads reaching the same height.

" I can make out Tasha say.
It's two hours later before I see Tammy again. Thankfully Charles largely ignored me while I stood bored out of my mind, tapping away at some sort of Muggle device.
"It's a miracle I didn't get spliced", I note hollowly, my voice frail. The old houses shift and warp to allow room for the magical residence, it's foreboding exterior warmed by a welcoming foot map.
I bite back my uncertainty and the smile threatening to grace my face at Tasha's familiar weight, and thrust my nose in the air, "I'll be coming around every week to check on my...property to make sure it isn't being mistreated?"
His eyes are still wide, brain obviously processing this information. "Alright, I'll look into this Muggle tube train. Thank you."
My stomach is full of fizz. I feel like I'm about to be sick with nerves because Harry Potter is carrying me. This will probably be the closest I'll ever be to this gift of a man.
Its decor is as dreary as the rest, old fashioned even for a pureblood home, with a wood stove and water basin. The only new appliances are a large white box humming by the pantry, taking up an unfair amount of walking space and a matching smaller one on the counter with a glass front.
Hermione nods, "Alright. If that’s what you think, I support you. But it'll take some time before I'm ready to forgive him."
At least as a child I had
"You've never been on the Night Bus before?" I ask, wrapping my arms around him a bit tighter and planting my feet for stability.
I could just tell him I’ve completed my research. He'll believe me. He has no reason to believe anything else.
I rest my head against the shower wall and pant, the horrific realization burning my consciousness that I just....no.
Tammy turns colors, pink to red to a violent purple, and she raises a finger at him, "WHAT DID YOU THINK YOU WERE DOING LEAVING HIM ALO-"
Despite having enough money to go grocery shopping, I haven't yet. I don't know what to buy and the Muggle packaging is confusing, to say nothing of the money struggle when it's time to pay. The different notes and coins bring my heart to my throat and makes my pulse race.
"Alright, we can make that work."
Breaking a multiple years long habit is not a good feeling.
I made it.
The cold breeze cuts through my robe but I barely feel it for the adrenaline pumping through my veins. I fumble with shaking hands for my wand, walking as fast as possible in the opposite direction of the road.
Worry eats away at my stomach like a potion gone wrong. The house seems to echo audibly without Tasha's mostly silent presence. I hurry up with my shower as Luna's coming any minute now and wrapping a fluffy towel around my waist I exit the guest bathroom just as a magical aura I easily identify as Luna flares up at the front door.
Harry stops walking and I nearly have a heart attack at how loose my tongue has become. I grab a fist full of his hair and pull it, "So messy you could never be a true threat." I say, rushing to cover up my blunder.
Aside from the stacks of boards, tile, and gallons of paint, it seems alright. Maybe a bit too comfortable by Malfoy standards, but alright.
"Do you not like cats?" I laugh, leaning forward and folding my arms on the table. The light from the lamp is catching Draco's pale eyelashes and the effect could make anyone believe in magic.
I throw on my clothes, a pair of muggle slacks and forest green button up. Halfway through the buttons I realize the similarity between the shirt and Potters eyes. With a sharp flick, I spell it off and decide on another shirt.
"Well, a Kneazle showed up at my door yesterday. I'm not sure who its owner is but I can't get it out of my apartment. It's very...insistent." I tell her, but a strange feeling stirs in my stomach, like I shouldn't say anything about the creature.
"No!" I shout, pulling the scorching apron away from my skin, trying to untie the tight knot behind my back and failing. The coffee puddles on the floor quickly and I panic, shooting out a hand to slam the lever back up.
"What's a stripper?" Luna asks, confused.
THREE
I find myself alone, my stomach still growling, so I go back to the counter and reach into the pastry bag for another scone. A Stasis charm must have been cast over the bag as the pastry was still warm and soft.
"Harry?" Her head of wild blonde curls pops up from behind a miniature rat enclosure, "Did someone steal your clothes?"
I accept the sheet of parchment back and ignore the height of the man looming overhead. Eyebrow raised, I attempt to exert my confidence as I tuck the paper into my pocket.
Despite what 'Mione had to say about whether or not he's gay, I can't imagine any scenario where he would appreciate being manhandled.
And Harry has so many friends, so much support and love. What use would I be, a drop of oil in the ocean. Insignificant and unwanted.
"I thought it meant cleaning!" He shouts, staring at his shoes in mortification. I dust myself off to distract myself from the warmth at my crotch and awkwardly nod along.
I ease open the door, and feeling like an utter dolt, say "Hello?"
My knees grow weak at his soft voice and I bite my lip to keep my face from melting into a sappy grin.
"Hey!"
it. The animal’s calls make a certain music, their personalities and colors spellbinding. I interact with them all day, socializing them so they aren't as timid with their eventual new owners. I walk around all day with Pigmy Puffs tucked into my pockets and riding on my shoulders, for Merlin’s sake.
Handsome.
"Hermione, the war is over." I make an effort to keep my tone normal.
I have a pair of yellow rubber gloves on have spent the last two hours scrubbing the kitchen. The ancient stove has a cooked-on layer of grime a centimeter thick, narrowed down from the three centimeters I started out with.
"Uh...right," I agree, not sure whether to be happy he wants to go or let down that he only wants to go out of practicality. I shake the feeling and smile at Draco,
----------------
A large eagle owl swoops down to me, landing on the ground at my feet to hoot loudly, which stirs some of the others.
I nodded, dragging my chips through ketchup and popping it into my mouth. The food here was good considering the place had just opened the week before. I was on my second plate of chips and thinking of ordering another sandwich.
Kneeling at eye level, I call lightly, "Tasha. Hey, Tasha wake up." I peel the Gryffindor red and gold jersey back from her face and she sleepily lifts her head.
, Potter. When will you stop it and just be selfish!"
Harry grins, twin lines framing his wonderful smile, "I know, right? People come in all the time to look at them. Like a zoo, almost. I told Luna she needs to start charging admissions"
He winces, ferret nose wrinkled cutely, "Sorry for trespassing, I won't do it again."
Pushing down the violent desire to grab my wand, I spin and stalk off down the sidewalk from where I came. The cold air does nothing to cool my scorching cheeks, aflame with a toxic mix of anger and embarrassment.
He gives me a sheepish smile and my heart physically hurts.
After only four days, my mind is constantly coming back to Tasha. How she's doing. If Potter is taking good care of her.
I unlock my door, stumbling inside both from the fire whiskey coursing though my veins and the dizzying after affects of a trip on the Night Bus.
his money.
"What are you talking about?"
I sit up and stretch, unleashing a shrill yawn which is interrupted halfway through by a violent shiver. Clutching the white fur coat I slept in (because why not? It's the warmest thing I own and I have no one to show off for) I shift my legs from the mountain of blankets and find my heated slippers. They're as soft as clouds and feel as if the sun is defrosting my frost-bitten toes.
It doesn't feel right to linger at Potters residence without a reason for being there. As curious as I might be about the history held in the old walls and vacant rooms, the idea of snooping or anything close to it is distasteful.
There's a beat of silence and I open the door all the way to see the only person that the wards don't pick up already pushing past me.
"Look Matilda, this is Draco." Potter goes to lift the bird on his hand but it viciously nips his finger and he draws it away quickly.
"Ouch. Keep that up and I'll drop you," He warns.
I step off the sidewalk and storm across the street, wanting to find a secluded place to Apparate as soon as possible. To reach my apartment and find something to hex.
But the awful ride isn't even in the forefront of my mind. I'm sitting in Harry Potter lap. I'm sitting, indirectly, on his cock.Morgan and Morgana what have I done to deserve this. I can't help feeling hot and the alcohol in my system is doing nothing to dampen the effects Harry is having on my erotic regions.
"Harry, ever since you fire-called Friday I've been worrying that it's something dreadful- why else would you tell me to get Ron out of the house for the day? We both know I can handle bad news better."
Or maybe Tasha will tell him herself.
Harry clearly hadn't known what to expect when the I rapped my fist on the scared front door of Grimmauld Place one uneventful Saturday. I waited a good minute at the stoop, anxiety a boa constrictor around my ribs, trying to keep Tasha from slithering into my cloak.
I shake my head hard, a bit of tea sloshing over to burn my fingers. "Nothing like that Hermione, I swear. It's just that...you're more open minded?"
Tasha's companionable hissing calms me enough to stand up and pat myself down, checking my wand and pockets.
, and you're
His tears make something inside me drop and I lean forward, reaching out a hand to catch one of his, "I just mean, does it really matter what the press thinks? They'll say what they want, but your actions
The Zabini's were acquitted of any charges- they never officially joined with Voldemort and took off long before the war truly started. Or so the Quibbler printed in their special edition paper. Luna's father's mad theories have taken off since the war and they were doubtful to begin with.
I grimace, taking a mouthful of scorching tea. "Sorry, 'Mione."
Both of our plates were cleared but Potter shows no sign of leaving. With my current state I know better than to attempt Apparating home so I'm left reliant on Potter. With that realization, I gulp down the rest of my wine.
She offers me a large, white pastry bag and the smell makes my stomach cheer embarrassingly loud. I've lived off of nothing but eggs and toast for so long I can’t really blame it.
I nod and stand up, "Do you want something to eat for lunch? I can't promise I'm any better than you, but I know the basics."
The water streams over my shoulders and back, Muggle shampoo making bubbles swirl down the drain. I climb out and towel off, hair clean and laying neatly before I button my white shirt.
"So, you've never ate Indian cuisine before?" I ask, picking my plate back up and finally getting a bite in my mouth. It's unlike anything I've had before, not thick and hearty like an English dish nor light and delicate like every French meal I had at the Manor. It tastes as if a gallon of seasonings were stirred in, stunning my remaining taste buds with too many flavors.
Harry
She raises an eyebrow, "Oh
"Is Draco Malfoy here?" Hermione asks, her warm brown eyes filled with shock. Tasha's tank was set up against the accent wall in the remodeled sitting room. The large fireplace she had come out of was one of two fireplaces with floo accessibility in the old house. The intricate fireplace is one of the only remaining remnants of the old room, the mahogany wood holding the same warmth as the honey toned walls and soft furniture.
"Did you not think I heard you the first time you utter dolt? I don't want you to have my bloody snake!"
"I thought you meant you were here as a stripper? I'm so sorry, mate."
And it must weigh a ton because no matter how hard I shove it, it seems to be bolted to the ground.
Potter leans over the table a bit, "You don't weigh as much as a Beater's bat, French blood or not. I think you're drunk."
"How about Rory? Or maybe Fanny. I don't even know what sex you are." I shake my head at myself, fully aware that this cat can't understand a word I'm saying. I move to roll it over onto it's back to check the gender, but it sinks it's claws into my skin and bites my reaching hand.
"Oh, what job? I believe Gringotts is hiring."
I shake my head firmly though he can't see me, "No, you get those free. I have no use for them."
This is so friggin late i'm sorry. For some reason this was a really hard chapter to write but one of the longest so far! Enjoy :)
He laughs, "No, you're name tag."
I don't deserve such a job, but I'm glad I have it and I'll be Crucio'd if I let anything muck it up.
"Just fine."
I don't want to let go of Draco's cool hand when we land in the alley of a vacant building. He makes the desicion for me, tucking his hands into his pocket for warmth as the freezing mist drizzles down.
I leave the skillet in search of a plate and return to the eggs to see them seemingly done. The white part seems opaque enough.
"I won't take charity Potter."
If Draco hadn't shown up at my door I probably never would have seen him again after the Battle of Hogwarts.
MMM'kay. What do you guys think of the ending there? Also sorry if there are any inaccuracies. I'm not Indian but I love an Indian Harry. I haven't eaten Indian food before either so Harry and Draco aren't alone. Also I realized this has been mostly written and was just waiting for me to finish it so I did and edited it really quickly to get it out today! This happened after I spilled tea all over my writing computer and desk and my life flashed before my eyes. I snatched my laptop up so fast lol.
? Surely this can't be normal.
"Didn't have to. Milk and three sugars."
Draco
I quickly eat the treat and before I can second guess myself, I walk to the back of the store and find a door with a large owl painted on it, probably from Luna herself. My heart leaps into my throat and my hand shakes as I pull the heavy wood door open.
Harry comes to pick me up from Luna's as I'm cleaning a capybara's enclosure.
The floors are stripped of dirt and my hands are scrubbed red and raw from the Muggle cleaning products underneath the kitchen sink.
I rush down the hall and towards the front door, which I fling open to see Luna patiently waiting.
I realize what he's not speaking about and cut in softly, "And no matter what you'll always be a Death Eater."
And there, his uncertain sincerity, is the change I can't get over. If I could Legitimus inside of his head to see Draco without his rigid armor, see the full expanse of the light shining through the cracks in his damaged mask. Or even better, if Draco by some slim chance, let me see past the crumbling facade willingly.
"I've never heard of that type of magic, but I doubt I can do anything of the kind." Harry says, clearly amused
Another chapter! I meant to post it tomorrow but why wait?
She beams at me, "Oh you're precious. I'm sure you'll do just fine with Charles here teaching you! Now, I’ll be in my office sorting through paperwork. There’re two doors on the left in the hallway, one to the loo and the other to the break room. I'll be coming in to check how you're getting on."
"That one's a Shiny Bellied Goliath. It's very bright, like you're snake. And so pretty. It's endangered because it's skin is often used in hair potions, sadly."
"I think Draco's first day at Luna's went well. I had to leave at nine but I got to show him the owls." I say, the image of Draco so close still fresh in my mind and refusing to leave. I wonder what it would be like if I had actually kissed him.
Reparations from the selling of Pureblood estates and properties as well as vaults were more than enough to rebuild and pay the survivors. The Order and all that helped fight, including all creatures and students at the Battle of Hogwarts, were paid ungodly amounts. The sheer fortune of the fallen Pure Bloods accumulated from the centuries was mind boggling.
I shut my eyes from the painful onslaught of memory and focus on the room, the kitchen.
I Apparate into my apartment, half convinced I would splinch myself with my magic being drained from a day of
His face falls slack with wonder, "How is that even possible? You're telling me there's a train under us?"
"Did I say something?"
I wanked to the thought of
His expression turns pained and he slips his wand from his forearm harness underneath his sleeve. Bowing his head goodbye, he Apparates away.
He bites his lips, "Alright, Potter."
. What was I thinking that a Muggle job would be easy? My Malfoy decorum could get me nowhere in this environment full of strange machines and rude nephews.
"I can't." I say and this time it's my turn to blush uncomfortably.
Draco lifts his pointy nose in a haunty manner and crosses his arms in a way that is very, very
My mind continues racing for who knows how long, all thoughts of sleep gone.
Potter's laughing, hand over his mouth and green eyes alight with humor, "I'm so sorry, I should have told you it was hot." He apologizes and I manage a weak smile.
"Potter," I great him and he stuns me with one of his brilliant smiles.
"I'm content with spending my mornings at Luna's and fixing up Grimmauld, 'Mione."
If only Potter really wasn't home, leaving me to quickly slip in and out so I wouldn't have seen his wonderfully tight stomach and strong shoulders free of his messy Muggle clothing, a sight that will surely haunt my dreams. And fuel more unfortunate wank sessions.
I swallow, suddenly queasy.
"Oh fine you big bully," She shoves me with her foot again and I make to grab it, "It's just that you called him
Wand in hand, I kneel down, cast
Potter makes a hissing noise and I look up to see Tasha curling around Potters broad shoulders, pressing her tapered snoot into his ear.
So did Harry figure it out? And what about Drunk Draco? I couldn't help myself, Harry had to give Draco a piggy back ride XD
"Don't worry about that. The only way to bring change is to challenge it, you know." She lets go and smiles brightly at the both of us, "What was the purpose of the war if all are still not equal?"
I shake the bag, "Yeah, plus some. I wasn't sure what Draco would want so I got one of just about everything."
. It's not to hard to imagine his legs wrapped around me and his heavy breath in my ear for a drastically different reason.
The food looked good and smelled edible which was more than I hoped for since I've never been a good cook, always getting punished for burnt meals at the Dursley's.
I need to think of literally anything else.
Many of the creatures are fantastical, not average wizarding pets but exotic animals with magical powers of their own. Like Tasha, many of the animals are rare or not commonly kept in homes. Luna tells me of all the breeders she has made friends with across the continent, how often she travels to pick up creatures, and how she recently became the most popular magical creature shop in Europe.
The way things are going I'm going to be a virgin until I die.
Parvati and Harry are close still? If he's not dating Luna, does that mean
It's been a week since Draco's first day on the job and with it being Thursday, he's coming over to see Tasha and get his cheque after his shift at Luna's.
"Thank you,"
Another one?! Sorry for the wait! Didn't edit very closely since I didn't want you waiting any longer.
Instantly, I can see cars, a fence, and a street lined with houses. They seem boringly calm, larger than my current residence though nowhere near the splendor the Manor used to be. Wind ruffles my ear length hair and a crup yips far off.
"You're so good with animals." I blurt and shrink into my robes, still dazed and endlessly embarrassed, hoping Potter didn't notice any distraction.
"Ah. First time rider I assume. Give me your address," He reaches a hand back and I deposit the sheet of paper there.
She hums a little tune and shoves my knee with her socked foot, "Just saw a rather clever idea"
She never takes the floo, convinced it leaves a person weakened towards invisible creatures of some sort. As much as I appreciate her friendship, there are some things she'll never be able to convince me of.
"What?" I turn to her fully now, leaving the tile design article.
, I start to worry I won't make it in time, even if I Apparate. There is no telling how close I will land if I Apparate as my location spell is old and inexact. I'll have to buy a map, find the location, and hope for the best.
The bus comes to a jolting stop and I shoot off a goodbye to Harry as I launch myself off the bus, heart beating out of my chest.
After leaving the Leaky I dropped by Luna's, then the Daily Profit to make sure Skeeter isn't up to her old tricks, which thankfully she wasn't. George's store was next and I helped Ron sort out a box of living love letters (They were god awful. Kept nattering on about handsome boys and squealing.)
Immediately, Charles grabs a tall cup and starts,
Draco's gone quite, head rested on my shoulder when the Night Bus screeches to a halt. I let him down and help him up the steps. The shrunken head is singing a Latin song and the driver isn't the same one I remember, but a quiet, tiny witch with bulging eyes.
I don't move from my spot, the internal panic roaring anew and I know for certain that I
Tasha's hissing is a soothing background noise and her presence is a grounding weight while I find a suitable spot to sit and manage my panic.
"Yes," She drags out, giving me a look as if I've lost my mind."
"Is that one of her magical powers? Are you okay? Luna said- Fuck- I mean I have to go get the door. Wait here?"
Did I go unconscious? How long have I been lying here?
"Draco! I brought Tasha for Luna to watch while we're out. I went ahead and found the restaurant."
"I really like the Weasley's kitchen. I want something like that. And lots of space to move. It's crowded now with that gigantic island in the way."
A giggle falls from my mouth as I bolt the door shut and cast my eyes around the open room for Muffin. She's on my pillow, getting her dark hair all over it, and is looking at me with her green eyes. I rush over and kick off my shoes, running a hand over her sleek fur.
Ron makes a face.
The lull of painting the walls flat grey makes the time blur, only interrupted some time later by a ringing alarm I sense from the wards.
And on Draco's first day at Luna's as well. I just saw Draco, standing there with his eyes vulnerable and face unreadable. Looking up at me and cheeks flushed as he not-quite tripped over his words, that poncy accent of his. I've never met anyone but him with an accent so...unique.
"Father b-" I cut myself off from my automatic response. No, in the end the only thing my father gave me was shame and self-loathing. "Yes. She's an albino Blue Scaled Whistle-Tongue."
happy, then I'm happy for you."
As comforting as her presence in my mind is, I'd rather be holding her, utterly spoiling her in affection. Does Potter give her his affection?
I found the job after a curiosity search through a Muggle newspaper. I was perplexed by the unmoving images and then got wrapped up in a confusing article about a player in something called 'football' which I assumed was the Muggle version of Quidditch. It sounded quite boring, frankly, but the player in the picture was very handsome even if he was as still as a corpse.
Potter shook his head sternly, his birds’ nest of curls coming alive, "No, I was thinking more like a rent situation. I enjoy her company but you raised her, right? So why don't you set a price and I can pay you for her. Not necessarily rent to own either, you can keep her as yours the whole time."
Draco is even more pissed than I thought, face ruddy and eyes shining. His feet are unsteady and he's eyeing the icy slush around the gutters.
As the minutes tick by, the pressure inside me increases until I'm fuming at myself.
"We came up with an agreement. He isn't doing so well Hermione. He wanted me to have her."
Potter is as close to perfect as any man can be, I'm convinced, he has no right to be so
He's a
, with a starstruck 'fan' makes me sit up on my bed, instantly uncomfortable.
"I never thought of going to one of those. I'd like to see how other people make it and... since you like it too would you want to go with me?"
I smile back at her, though it's strained under the sheer weight of the dark glare aimed at me.
I scratch the back of my neck, "Er, yeah? He was a bit upset so I made tea."
"Uh, no. Something's wrong with Tasha and I Apparated straight over." I rush over to her in my socks.
Draco's half asleep, I reason, as I find a seat and sit him down in my lap. He's not awake enough to brace himself properly, but he is awake enough to gasp and protest.
She looks at me, cocking her head, "You can give me your resume and I’ll take a peek at it if you really want?"
She tucks herself deeper in the fabric and makes a sound almost like a purr. I stroke the exposed patch of glass smooth scales and get up off the soft carpet.
What if- are Harry and Luna dating? Surely not. She called him a
I lift her from her tank and carry her up two flights of creaking stairs to the master bedroom, placing her on my dark green duvet while I suit up to begin painting the master bathroom.
My whole foot is black and blue.
I return to the alley, my Lumos still glowing brightly. My consciousness re-centers with a feeling like a feather falling on a windless day.
Harry bounces me, "Don't say that. I like you however you act."
Draco
up their arseholes!
possible per say. I didn't enjoy sex with Ginny and had never been able to...imagine sex with any girl like I had just done.
A loud crash sounds behind me and I jump, head snapping in that direction to see Potter pick himself up off the floor and staring at me with wide green eyes.
Draco
My hand is too dry against my cock so I spit into it and continue, rolling onto my back and pulling my pants down some to free my hand.
ELEVEN
, popping away to the attic.
"I don't want to talk about it," Draco grumbles, trying to smooth his clothes down. Tasha is settled over his shoulders, her head hanging down his back, and she lifts her head to hiss at me.
"Um, I have a job interview." I say, hyperaware of my words and the Statute of Secrecy. A violation is the last thing I need.
My previous good mood takes a nose dive down a cliff after my Potter tainted shower wank.
"What? Why?" He turns his head to look at me and our faces are side by side, angles a bit awkward but his gaze so powerful.
"He was in the kitchen?" She is once again taken by surprise.
"What's with the name tag?"
She hurries off after another overly excited goodbye and leaves me with her 'nice boy' nephew Charles.
The door rattles again, the ward magic flashes an angry red as it blocks the spell. Despite there being no one according to the wards, someone is outside that door.
, Hermione?"
"We've all noticed how preoccupied you are with him, Harry. Of course I'm okay with it and glad you told me, Harry. I'm still not entirely convinced of Malfoy but if you think he'll makes
Alright. I start on the easiest, a plain black coffee with two sugars.
"I always look bored. And I like your stories." I force out in a cold voice, not sure why. Irritation flares and I take a gulp of my spicy wine.
I remember what happened like a bolt of lightning striking me, "
I laid out my clothes the night before, so I can immediately start getting ready, trudging my way across the one room apartment to the bathroom for a hot shower.
We sat in a circular booth next to the empty stage and caught up as it was about a month when we saw each other.
The walls were bare and stained where Hermione and I ripped out the old wallpaper and everything was ready to begin painting. Casting a bubble head charm over myself, I get to work.
I hold her on the living room couch, worry gnawing at my stomach.
My ankle burns when I put weight on it, but otherwise I'm unharmed.
I nod and follow her inside, setting the pastry bag on the counter as she switches on all of the lights and coos at the still sleeping birds.
I bury my burning face in my cold hands, an onslaught of emotions swallowing the air from my lungs, and the shame was overwhelming. I need to go.
Potter smiles. Harry Potter smiles at me, Draco Lucius Malfoy. I'm shocked stupid as I stare at his teeth with their slightly crooked canines.
A little girl and her mother came up to Luna not long after, the girl practically bouncing.
Just breathe, I remind myself. Please...
I shake my head, swallowing another mouthful. I'm sure I look ridiculous stuffing my face like some unmannered cretin, but I can't seem to stop.
I rub my neck, instantly imagining eating at a Muggle restaurant with Draco, taking trips to zoos and museums together. Showing him how Muggle things work.
The owl cocks its head and pecks Potter's face hard enough for him to wince and a surprised laugh is forced from my lips. Potter's soft voice has already melted my wax core, I feel my body relaxing and my face going warm, almost all barriers broken down.
"Am not!"
"What's that supposed to mean?" I shoot back, clutching Tasha closer to me and she gives a minute hiss in annoyance.
I want him to own me completely, I don't care, I'll gladly gift myself to him. Even if we would have to hide our relationship and I would feel jealous from the sea of girls out there vying for him.
Either the restaurant has risen 5 degrees or the alcohol is stronger than I previously thought. My face is warm and my hands feel somewhat detached from my arms. Potter is saying stupid things and I can't remember the last time I've had as much fun.
The jersey I had witnessed Tasha snuggled in, I wonder what miracles it would work if I wore it. It would smell like Potter, uniquely worn from the planes of his body and soft from hundreds of washings. I would have to constantly pull the too-long sleeves up to free my hands.
"Luna, what type of lizard is this?"
Suddenly, I realize, "Nobody's at the counter."
Draco
A flash of annoyance crosses his features before he settles his jaw back into a determined square, "Consider it a down payment then."
I bite back a grin, "Just about how moody you are."
I have not. Had any visitors, that is. I've been busy with renovations, investing, and it's only been a year after the war. Many students, like Dean and Seamus, paired off immediately, and some are already starting families. Hell, even Hermione and Ron moved in together.
My feet forget to work at the mental image of Draco on a stage in revealing lace and glitter, dancing sensually to a Muggle song. Would he be my height in soaring heels?
"Alright then. You can handle the next customer just fine, I imagine. I'll be in the breakroom if you need anything." He stomps away.
I spill more tea in shock, choking on air. "How did you even know I was talking about him?"
But Potter just doesn't know when to give up.
The kitchen window had to be opened by breaking the rusted lock or else I would've passed out from the overpowering smell of bleach and vinegar by now.
The stubborn door swings open and she beams, "That's awfully sweet of you. I really did enjoy seeing him yesterday, it felt like both closure and seeing an old friend, you know?"
I wake up to a bed spring grinding into my hip and even though I’m up to my nose in blankets, I'm still shivering. I curl into a tight ball, tucking my frozen feet closer to me until I'm gripping my knees to my chest, morning erection squished.
I'm not laughing because this is funny. It's just the affects of my brain rattling around in my skull and bile rising in my throat.
Though I don't think Draco is going to make it to the closest pick up site.
Hermione grabs my hand and squeezes her cold fingers around mine, "Harry, just help me understand. Please."
"I'll chase you and win," I warn and can see him giving in.
She hisses excitedly, tongue flicking wildly as she scents the air. Her scales are warm from her heat rocks and still smooth- her shed’s still a long way away.
I find myself smiling, tuning out the witches and wizards in the shop and listening to Luna's overview of all the creatures.
I find a seat on the couch and watch the reunion, not being able to help my smile at watching Draco being so drastically different than...Draco. He actually looks 18 for once, with his usual solemn face and blank grey eyes out of sight and replaced by joy. I've seen him laugh before. His face pinched and expression cold, backed by Slytherins with matching expressions of cruel appreciation.
I honestly am not sure. It seemed likely, there are so many restaurants and pubs.
Draco looks as if he's worked all day, hair fluffy and there's a dirt smudge on the edge of his jaw. Something about this Draco is driving me mad with want. Because
When the food is finished, I turn to him, "You don't have to. I won't be offended- I mean, we're not close friends or anything."
Charmed instruments played in the corner and lights danced and darted around the room. It was brilliant.
I'd invite Hermione over to help puzzle out a spell to move the damned thing, but she's up at the Ministry and Ron's shoddy at spell work. Dean and Seamus were about average in school and Neville was more interested in plants than anything.
I shrug, "It's Luna who suggested it. She needed a new employee anyway. Free labor isn't enough anymore."
Is this a date? It seems like a date, the lighting is intimate and Potter is gazing at me through his glasses in a way that halfway makes my bits tingle but mostly makes me nervous.
to work at the Ministry. The rest of us are just taking a breather after the war. It's only been a few months and there really is no rush, we've all got more than enough money."
I'm so warm.
For my fellow Americans! Tasha's length is 3 feet, or a yard, but I wanted to make it more authentic to the British setting. She's been with Draco since 5th yr so she's around 3 years old. Same age as my cat 0-0
"Uh, I have a lot going on right now with renovations and everything," I mutter, face flushing. It wouldn't be a good idea. Being around Draco so much my feelings being as they are and surely unwelcome. I couldn't take advantage like that, it wouldn't be right.
There was
This hits him like a Stupefy and tears immediately well in his eyes. Tasha jolts and goes to investigate his shifted mood.
, he's worthy of
His stupid eyebrows stay in orbit, "I didn't say anything. Though I was going to ask why you're here with Tasha?"
Harry
Cars line the street and a small group of laughing men stand on the front sidewalk. They look to be late twenties to thirties, standing in a drunken circle and holding glasses piss colored liquor.
"You can have her. She's yours now. She always liked you better anyway." I sneer.
Harry bloody Potter hasn't a clue what he does to me.
"Guess not. It's our mate’s bachelor party and we're havin' a bit of fun."
A towel is tied over my nose to block some of the fumes and Tasha is banned from the kitchen as I clean up. I've probably lost more than my share of brain cells from the fumes and I don't want the first thing I say to Draco is that I've killed his snake.
"Really?" I ask, gears already churning on whether I should bring it up to Draco or not. He never mentioned his friends before, but given he's been living in the Muggle world and it's already so hard to reconnect, he may not be in touch with any of the Slytherins.
But that wasn't quite right either. I wanted his serene smile when he held Tasha and his snorting laugh.
Draco bows his head slightly with a slim, bright smile, "Alright."
"Sorry, I'm sorry!" I give in and Potter stops bouncing and continues walking. "Were are you going?" I ask, suddenly realizing that if Potter was going to Apparate us he would've already.
"Er...sorry for the mess." I apologize, cheeks heating.
I'm waiting at Luna's when she comes to open up in the morning, the bag of warm pastries in my hands wafting delicious smells over my cold face.
"Yes. I'm looking for a female but haven't had any luck," She says and looks closer at the lizard then smiles brightly, pointing, "Look, I believe he's about to go into shed. His skin does look milky."
I should have taken the Tube. I should have gone with the corner shop job. Or looked somewhere else that was decently close by.
(See the end of the chapter for
I stare at the door, slipping my wand into my palm as I creep, feeling ridiculous, towards the sound.
He wants to be friends. And I should be content.
What good is etiquette classes in times such as these. I haven't the faintest idea of what to say or if the silence is comfortable or not given how uncomfortable I am. I know my hair is awful and I'm paranoid that I am smudged with dirt like a Weasley, but know it doesn't matter either way because Harry Potter doesn't give two sickles how I look.
The thought of entering a relationship,
. I should hex their guts and send a
I groan and smack the back of his head, "You are so awful, Harry."
"So, her mind is with Draco? Something's happened to him?"
It looked divine. Like a luxurious meal compared to the strictly egg based diet I’ve been eating. The colors are rich, deep reds and warm browns, peppers and spices enough to shock my half-dead taste buds back to life. It definitely wasn't an English dish.
I look around at the full bus bench and then cast a discrete
"I like having her here. The only other people that stop by are Ron and Hermione, so it's nice to have the company. I was actually thinking of getting a kneazle or maybe another owl."
Good.
I smooth down my slacks and examine myself in the glass of the building. The backup white button-down shirt was nowhere near as flattering, but it did its job.
"Shut up, Potter." He sniffs and grinds the heels of his hands into his eyes.
"How much do you want?" He asks and I'm instantly aware of the state of my stomach. I haven't eaten anything but a single egg all day since my stock pile is running low.
I suck down a deep breath and let the stretch of my lungs burn. "I can't care for her anymore. She's expensive. Her food. Her heating lamp bulb burnt out yesterday and I can't afford another. I can't find an apartment with her; no wizarding establishment will take me for obvious reasons and she's not a normal Muggle pet. I can't have her."
"Well, you must. Otherwise I wouldn't like you as much as I do."
I groan and lift my head, taking a final swig, I get up and pay the barkeep for the drink, then exit onto Diagon and go about the task of distracting myself.
The yawn I make climbing the stairs pops my jaw loudly and makes my eyes water.
Also, I don't think this will be a 10 chapter fic but more of a 15 or so. Not super long, but not short either.
Harry
I...I just wanked to a fantasy of a boy, of
I could have gotten a better apartment. But why would I risk it without a job and the deal with Potter not a signed guarantee?
I jog up the stairs and enter my bedroom, the thick carpet masking my heavy footsteps. Tasha's completely buried up to her nose, silently sleeping in my old jersey. I smile at her cuteness.
Not that the mad urge to rush into partnership didn't hit me. A month after the war, wounds were just beginning to heal and Ginny and I held onto each other like we would die otherwise. When we lost our virginities, I realized that I wasn't attracted to her like a lover, but as a close friend. She's a sister to me.
"That's good, Harry, that you helped him get a job." Ron mutters, looking to Hermione who gives him a pleased look.
Three minutes later the bus rumbles up and stops. People line up to file on and I get my bus card and address ready.
I stare at the inebriated man for a long moment, then turn to the previous man, "So this
His face has turned handsome, strong jaw and tanned skin, a shadow of facial hair. This couldn't be the same Potter.
Almost as soon as I head for the bathroom where the paint and supplies already are, Tasha stops me.
I take the lift to the third floor and find Hermione on the couch, still in her Ministry suit, and Ron carrying a dish to the table.
Luna turns to me, "Tasha's doing well, I hope?"
"I wonder why she's living with you then. Maybe its just her personality and she doesn't mind you at all? Cats are known to be like that."
I really need this job. But I really hate that fucking twat Charles already. My Malfoy pride has been at my disadvantage my whole like, though. I won't let it ruin this opportunity too.
"I just returned her back to her body." His eyes are still covered and my face is on fire. I fold my arms over my chest.
That is the Muggle way of healing a minor sprain, right?
I try not to look at her trying to reach me, it's just adding salt to the wound. Best have a clean break, or however that Muggle saying goes.
"I'm serious. I don't know who you belong to, but get out!"
utterly different about him.
Three days ago, I saw Parvati Patil, who now works as an Auror, and she gave me her grandmother's recipes, including one for naan bread.
I stared at Draco wide eyed for a moment before I mentally shook myself and stuffed naan bread into my mouth.
My grin widens and Tasha hides her head.
The goofy grin Harry gets makes my guilt multiply. He takes my robe and leads me to the sitting room where I immediately go to Tasha's terrarium.
I shuffle my feet nervously, "Uh, no thank you. Maybe another time? I'm tired from a...job interview." It's not a lie.
This is supposed to be simple. Straight forward. Not 'showing the ropes' and a
But this isn't the only job I can get, just the most convenient. Less time walking through the frozen sludge of a London winter.
From deeper in the house I hear the old grandfather clock chime and I count the deep booms to ten- giving me six,
I suppose Draco would be the rightful heir so it makes sense.
He glares at me but it holds no weight, "Oh hush! It's just I know what you're doing and you've already done too much as is. I'll never be able to pay back my life debt to you, much less anything else. You saved the bloody
The muggle flat has a strange kitchen. In the corner of the room is a large white box like I had seen in Potter's kitchen. Except this one rattles and hisses, the inside unable to maintain a cold temperature because of the bad seal. I have to spell it every day so it's contents don't go bad.
I don't bother to manually brush my teeth but cast a cleaning charm instead, the residue magic tasting like a spicy mint. I strip off my shirt and toss it in the wicker laundry basket in the corner of my room.
Her presence is a comforting weight in my brain, I've felt it so many times before throughout the war while under a Crucio or when I retreated into myself as I witnessed the horrors of the Dark Lords table.
"I think not. How uncivilized are you Potter?"
"You do magic with your eyes, Harry. It's the only logical explanation. You look at people and a spell is cast."
Draco
treating me this way. The whole of the wizarding world and now Muggles too?
"Uh- sorry if I'm talking too much. Just realized how bored you look." He rubs the back of his neck with one hand and picks at his napkin with the other.
Seeing no response, I beat the door again before switching to the morbid knocker which dented the ancient door further with a resounding bang.
"Oh, no, I think with traditional Indian food you use your hands."
"This is just pathetic, Malfoy," I say loudly, my last name like sandpaper to my throat.
"I thought I was having an interview? With questions and such? I brought my resume."
"Um...weekly. I'll come over and see Tasha for a bit." Draco says, uncertain.
"Want me to cast a cleaning spell?"
"I'll have a Double Shot Cappuccino, Iced Vanilla Latte-" He rattles off three other orders with ease and I struggle to catch them all. My smile is strained as I turn back to the wall of machinery.
