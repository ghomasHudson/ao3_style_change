"Not until you get an Outstanding on your O.W.L.s, you little scamp." Their voices disappeared further into the manor, leaving Harry and Draco alone in the wine cellar, in silent thought and glad for the welcome interruption.
minutes." Scorpius decided. He laid his head on Draco's chest, feeling his father's heart against his cheek. "Tell me when five minutes are over."
Scorpius flicked his eyes from Hermione to baby Hugo who was held against her hip. "Thank you," he responded for the lack of anything else to say.
"Think of Teddy, what he's got to go through at Hogwarts," Ron interjected. "Those kids are ruthless. You know that better than anyone else. Would you sit back and watch if Ginny did something like this?"
"What's happening?" Scorpius asked helplessly. He was at a complete loss. Something was going on and he was the only one who didn't seem to know what to do about it. The tiny cogs in his head were grinding hard. Scorpius stared at the magazine that lay face up on the floor while worrying his bottom lip. The photographs continued to move idly. They were a bit blurry and fun to see. He had never really seen himself in pictures like these before. He was usually made to pose and look proper. No one took pictures of him like this. They had had a fun day at the fair. That's where the pictures were taken. He picked the magazine up off the floor. One of the photos showed Draco laughing at Harry who had been drenched by a sprinkler that a clown had pulled out of his sleeve. That had been too funny.
"Are we?" Harry faltered as Draco opened the door to reveal his only heir dressed in ripped rags, blood dotting his green-tinged face, holding a severed foot in one hand and an empty pillowcase in the other.
The teacher's lounge was bustling when Harry arrived, Gabrielle giving him a narrow-eyed glance when he placed the sandwich box on the table aside from his plate of chicken and rice. "From Scorpius," Harry answered her questioning look as he took a seat.
"I wouldn't put it that way." Draco dropped his gaze, playing with the spoon on the table. "It's been bizarre. Brings back a lot of..." He shook his head as he trailed off.
Draco knew what Astoria meant. And he thought about what Harry had said about trying. Still trying. Always trying. He couldn't imagine that. If he and Astoria had kept trying to get along, to have the perfect marriage for the sake of Scorpius, it could have ended in one of them snapping for good. What was the point of that? What was the point of them being miserable for the sake of a relationship? "Should we have kept at it?" he wondered aloud.
how pathetic your future is because of your actions. You have only yourself to blame for your mistakes. But you have no right bringing your child up to be the same as you. Do you know how isolating his life must be for him? Do you have any idea how hard it has been for Gabrielle and me to bring him out of his shell? To get him to interact with children his own age? To encourage him to even
"Well, there are so many reasons. Where to begin?" Theo tapped his chin. "They were both quite rude to each other when they were at Hogwarts. Harry was a Gryffindor. Your father was a Slytherin. They fought over just about everything. They were both Seekers, so Quidditch was a big deal to them. There were a few other topics of... contention, let's say. It was a very confusing time for everyone."
"You will not be arranging anything!" Harry realized that this was quickly getting out of hand. He had to put an end to it before it spun out of his control. "A handful of pictures, Percy. I haven't murdered anyone. I haven't stolen anything. I went to a goddamn carnival."
Draco was much too spent from the hike up to argue anymore. He should have known Potter would pull a quick one on him. It had only been a matter of time. He let Harry usher him down the hill. Teddy and Scorpius were already speeding towards the bustle, having honed in on an ice-cream stall.
"Sheesh." Teddy threw an arm around Scorpius. "No wonder Harry likes you." He flipped the page of his album. "Let's look at some more of these." He started pointing out different people. "I think you'll like Dominique the best. She's not like you at all. She loves to talk. You can listen to her all you want." He tapped at the photo of a pretty blonde girl in one of the Christmas pictures. "She's probably the same age as you too. If you want to come over to the Burrow tomorrow, you can see her."
Harry felt an overwhelming rush of sympathy. It wasn't often that he saw Draco like this, defeated. At the moment, he was keeping his anger in check as well. When he had been asked to confirm Draco's alibi, it had taken all his power to not throw a royal fit. If the Aurors had been anything but polite and hesitant, Harry would have demanded Draco be released at once. But his intention wasn't to make more of a scene. He had answered their questions as concisely as possible, all of which took no more than two minutes. But releasing Draco took another hour. It was ridiculous. He couldn't begin to imagine how humiliating the whole ordeal must have been for Draco.
"I don't need you. Nanna will owl it." Scorpius loved feeling this superior and independent. It didn't happen often when he got into fights with his father.
"Also, sorry for what's about to happen now." Harry gestured at the door just as it shot open to reveal Molly, Arthur, Hermione, and George, with an embarrassed Ron and Patricia hanging back behind them.
Draco pushed off of the credenza with a tired sigh and walked up to the couch, resting his elbows against the back of it as he leaned forward to accept a bite of cake his son was holding up. It was cloyingly sweet and barely tasted of chocolate. Not bad for a first try.
Ginny pursed her lips dramatically and leaned in close to glare at Harry. "Who is she, Harry James Potter?" She kept leaning in until her nose was squished against his and they were both cross-eyed. "You have a lot of nerve. A
Harry grabbed the hood of Scorpius' winter coat to stop him his tracks. "Come on!" He tugged Scorpius back towards him. "Tell me." He crouched down so they were eye-to-eye. "Is it a secret?" he hummed. "I can keep a secret."
Scorpius rarely asked for things. Draco often made sure he didn't need to ask. But when it came to spending time with Scorpius, all Draco knew was to watch him draw and read with him. When Scorpius was younger, they would spend time in the large grounds surrounding the manor. But the two of them had never ventured outside their sanctuary together before. Draco had never initiated it, and Scorpius certainly hadn't either. Until today. With Patricia available almost everyday for Scorpius' needs, Draco had never really needed to play with his son. But now his son was coming to him, wanting to spend time with him.
Draco could tell that Scorpius was feeling miserable. He had recognized the look on the young boy's face while singing and had cringed. "You looked very grown up, Scorpius," he said. "And this was just your first performance. Many more to come."
Scorpius stilled for a moment with his chin tucked against his chest and his shoe scraping against the rough cement steps. But then he kept walking his solitary path along the edge of the stairs. "Because… no one is
Draco rolled over and pushed Harry back against the bed, straddling his hips, and taking him by surprise. "Why?" He studied Harry intently. "Is there more?" He kissed Harry hard without waiting for an answer.
Over the course of the night, he must have fallen asleep at the desk because, when he woke up, his neck and back were killing him and... something else.
Teddy was getting fed up with the curious stares he had been receiving since the start of his third year at Hogwarts. He had tried glaring, which usually worked because he could pull off a
In a rush, chilly November turned to festive December. Scorpius spent his evenings cutting out snowflakes from scrap paper, practicing his carols for the performance, and helping Patricia with holiday bakes. Draco had to diligently wrap and hide presents that were owled almost daily to the manor, courtesy of Astoria. Harry became busy with the winter pageant and planning a packed Weasley party schedule.
"We haven't spoken to him since summer break, and it's almost Christmas now." Draco thought back to last Christmas, when Harry had made up his mind to mess with both their lives with a bold kiss. He wrung the wooden spoon between his hands. Infuriating. "I suppose he has every right to be angry." He turned to the eggs again, extinguishing the fire and scraping the bottom of the pan sullenly.
Teddy picked one out of his collection. "It's a Muggle picture book, so it doesn't move. Harry gets them for me. He used to read them when he was kid, you know? He would steal them from Dudley's bookshelf." He sat on the furry rug and pulled Scorpius down with him. "I especially like the superhero ones. Do you like superheros? My favorite is Spiderman."
Draco squinted at Theo, suspicious as he often was around him. Theo was usually up to no good. "What? Why?"
After their snack, they cleaned up all their crumbs and finished their milk before retiring to the living room where Harry laid out Scorpius' workbook on the coffee table that was just low enough for Scorpius to kneel beside and write diligently. Scorpius was even more nervous because Harry was sitting right next to him, watching him write. But he didn't make any mistakes and he flushed with pride every time he finished one line perfectly. Sometimes Harry helped him with some of the cursive letters so they could be curlier. Even though he never asked for help, he liked being helped if it meant that he could do things better. He was finished his work in record time too because he wanted to impress Harry, just like when he wanted to impress his father. He looked up at Harry after he had closed his book.
Teddy was regaling them with stories from the Potter archives he kept in his head, exalting the moment his godfather had 'tamed a dragon in Gringotts, freed it, and then flown atop it to safety'. Scorpius was listening intently, mouth agape, dinner forgotten. Any meal with Teddy present often ended in Harry's embarrassment. Scorpius had so many questions, all of them directed at Harry, who answered begrudgingly while leaving out gory details. After dinner, Scorpius learned the hard way that adding more cocoa to his hot chocolate only made the drink more bitter. They played dice and card games for a couple of hours, Teddy managing to win most of them. A few mugs of hot chocolate and eggnog later, the clock struck eleven. The boys had run upstairs to continue their shenanigans since Teddy was sleeping over. Harry was thoroughly exhausted. He flopped onto the couch in the living room and marveled at the enormous Christmas tree from his vantage point. Malfoys sure knew how to decorate for the holidays. The tree had to be at least twelve feet tall, all the ornaments matched, silver twinkling lights shone between the needles, perfectly wrapped presents lay under it, and there were stockings filled to the brim hanging at the mantle. "You've been busy."
"It's not a secret. I know it's not a secret." Scorpius narrowed his eyes at his teacher knowingly and elicited a soft chuckle. He sure was shrewd like a Malfoy.
"What pictures?" Teddy asked excitedly. He loved drama and there seemed to be a whole lot of it brewing in the foyer. He wasted no time in bounding down the stairs and snatched the magazine out of Harry's grasp. "Cool! Whoa! Look at that!" He held the Witch Weekly out for Scorpius to see. Scorpius had ventured into the foyer, slinking between Ron and Hermione. "It's us, Scorp! We look grand," Teddy declared. His eyes popped out when he saw more pictures. "Did you even know they were taking these? I had no idea."
She ended up flat on her back on the foyer with children crawling all over her, showering kisses and hugs on her. "Oh, alright, alright," she laughed at their exaggerated displays, "You can open my luggage." Yet
"But you are a functioning member of society now," Harry argued. "You have a steady job, you pay your taxes, it's been almost fifteen years, you were a kid, and you were never charged with anything. I mean, if that happened to me, I would be furious."
Winter break meant no school for ten days. Harry and Gabrielle sent the children on their way with little goodie bags filled with cookies and small presents, wishing them 'Happy Holidays'. The kids were excited to have time off from school. Bundled in their winter clothes, they skipped away, chattering among themselves and saying their goodbyes until the New Year.
Draco didn't know. He didn't know the rules. He dropped his gaze to a splinter in the old wooden bench and began picking at it. "What does telling Scorpius accomplish?"
Draco was trailing behind. He would rather be at home, cool and dry. Instead he was trudging up a bloody mountain because Potter was adamant that he join the boys. His hair stuck to the back of his neck and he was wearing the most Muggle clothes in existence. He looked down at himself and cringed. Harry had picked it out for him and would not hear a no for an answer. Honestly, whoever thought of this indecent rubbish for grown men? Khaki pants and a grey short-sleeved linen shirt that showed, rather prominently, the Dark Mark that he strove to hide every day of his life.
"Happy birthday!" Scorpius and Teddy exclaimed as they surprised Harry with a wonky neon blue cake that had a couple of sparklers sticking off the top, shooting yellow sparks over the icing.
Harry stretched his legs out in front of him and watched the crackling fire. The sun had set, so the flames cast a warm orange glow in the otherwise dark grounds of the Malfoy Manor. Draco sat opposite him, poking at the embers with a stick. Scorpius and Teddy were making s'mores.
Harry was shaken by the point-blank answer, but he tried not to show it. "I see." He realized that he was being too nosy and getting into personal affairs. That answer was definitely not a typical one. "So if you
Loads of questions hung in the air, tense and unsettling. But Draco stayed put, as did Harry. Eventually they reached for their tea. They sipped the hot beverage while unraveling their own thoughts, trying to find the right words, unhurried. Harry had no delusions of what life was like for Draco. A man with a criminal record linking him to the Dark Lord would never be able to scrub his past clean. He would always be high on the list of 'persons of interest' when it came to any situation related to the Dark Arts. And if he was called in for questioning by the Aurors, he was in no position to argue.
"Yes, yes," Draco conceded. "You are all knowing and I'm just your lowly servant, here to serve her highness."
"But I won't be able to stop myself from eating it every day," Scorpius lamented. "It's so good! How do
Harry snatched the fallen parchment off the ground. "Why are you opening my mail?" He grabbed the rest of the Christmas correspondences out of Teddy's grasp. "What are you on about?" He glared at the elegant handwriting in the highly offensive letter Teddy wanted nothing to do with. His expression softened when he recognized the script. "Oh." It was from Draco.
He was sulking in his bedroom when Draco found him after some searching. He didn't even look up when he heard his father enter. He pretended to be busy rearranging his books. Draco sat down on the floor beside him and watched him pretend for a while longer. Scorpius kept up the act for a minute, but there was only so much he could do with books that were already neatly stacked up. So he sat back in his chair and looked down at his hands.
"I've been practicing with Dad almost every night," Scorpius told Harry at school, by the playground. Scorpius was on the monkey bars, swinging with ease between the rungs, while Harry helped a little girl near the swings with her coat zipper that had gotten stuck.
Harry was astonished to find dimples on his cheeks. That must be from Astoria. Scorpius was quick to compose himself and hide his smile though. "I won't," he promised. "You're nicer than him too. But I still like him better."
Harry couldn't bring himself to stumble through the same excuses yet again. He looked away guiltily, readying himself for more rants similar to the ones he had already heard from the rest of the Weasleys. He glared at the carpet and waited.
Harry shifted on the couch and pressed his hands to his knees. "This is being blown out of proportion. So they've snapped a few photographs of me. What's the big deal?"
An hour later, Draco, who had just walked into the kitchen after putting Scorpius down for a much needed afternoon nap, stopped short when he saw Harry, who was leaning against the counter, sipping on a cup of tea he had helped himself to after having cleared the table. "I really am quite famous, you know?"
Harry snapped his teeth together, clamping his mouth shut. Ron and Hermione exchanged a look. Hiding his annoyance, just barely, behind a low grunt, Harry turned away from them as he shuffled the letters into a neat pile and began walking out the room.
Scorpius whooped. "I gotta tell Nanna." He zoomed off to the manor so Patricia could hear all about the neat trick he had learned.
"That he's really nice," a girl chimed in. Harry looked down while blushing modestly. Just in time too because the children now turned their attention to their teacher, admiring him from afar. "My brother said that I'm so lucky that I get to be in Harry's class. He said that when Harry was still a little boy, he was called the Chosen One. He fought a lot of monsters. He knows a lot of spells. And he-"
Draco knew there was no stopping this storm, yet he couldn't help but try... "I don't know why he said that. I'll talk to him-"
the time. He's busy too, you know?" He laid his head against her shoulder, atop her flowing golden curls.
alright with this." He had been right about feeling regretful. Remarkable how instantly he had felt that regret. "This never happened." He began rolling down his sleeves while waiting for an answer. When he didn't get one, he glared at Harry. "It's forgotten. Understood?"
"Yes, I think I had better let them know. I will be right back, Scorpius." Harry moved towards the outside office where the receptionist helped him with Scorpius' emergency contact.
"You should have woken me up." Draco ran his fingers through Scorpius' hair. "You can always wake me up."
Ginny pulled her legs up onto the couch and flicked through the magazine while Harry cried into his hands as the gravity of the situation kept hitting up to him no matter how far he fled. Draco had been right. He had been selfish, entitled, childish, and so ignorant to not expect things to end this way. He wished he could take it all back. He would use that Time-Turner in a heartbeat. Every time he shut his eyes, he heard a dozen voices telling him he was a mess, asking him what he had been thinking, jeering at him. The worst part of it all was how upset Scorpius had been when he had left the house that day. He had never meant for this.
"He's fine," Draco bit out before Harry could respond, and reached down to help him up without shifting his scowl from Astoria. "You said after lunch." He kept a tight hold on Harry's arm despite Harry attempting to pull away.
"But now they are all grown up," Scorpius reasoned. "And they need to be nice. That's how it works. When you grow up, you can't be rude anymore."
Draco shook his head in defeat. "You're already extra nice to me." He turned around and handed the plate to his son. "You're already taking care of me just by being with me."
Harry nodded. It's what he had been saying over and over again to anyone who would listen. He brushed his cheeks dry. "Yes. Everything will go back to the way they were. It's only a matter of time."
He tried to think of the last time he had gone out to a restaurant. Likely with Astoria a few years ago? He had certainly
Draco had had enough. "No," he snapped. "I've been trying to speak to you for weeks. I can't find you at school, I can't get a hold of you at your place, and I can't even talk to you when you're standing in front of me?!" Draco was too fed up to bother keeping his tone civil. "Fine, if you want to freeze out here, that's fine. But the least you could do is listen to what I have to say for once if your life, Potter."
At first Draco was so taken aback that he didn't know what to say. If that wasn't the most outrageous thing he had heard... "If you want to show off a trophy, you're barking up the wrong tree."
"I love you too," Harry managed to gasp out. Once Teddy let go of him, he finally breathed easier. "You're growing up way too quick, Teddy." He ruffled the boy's hair. "I remember when you were just
the time. He's always wrecking the kitchen. In fact, I'd be surprised if he didn't blow things up at least twice a month."
Hugo and Rose cackled at Teddy's theatrics while Ron and Hermione simply shook their heads. They were used to scenes like this whenever Harry and Teddy were around.
The scathing look he received would have stricken down a common man, but he was used to glowers by now. Draco slammed the door shut, prompting Harry to laugh out loud as the past few months melted away like the snow on his flushed cheeks. He took the first truly carefree breath he had taken since the summer, reveling in happiness for a moment before disapparating. Ron was right. Fresh starts weren't bad.
"I won't," Scorpius whispered back. "I don't want to sleep. Not ever." He shivered as the breeze made his clammy skin cold. "I hate it."
Harry waited. He knew Draco had heard him. He watched the faint pulse on Draco's neck, beating a gentle rhythm, and waited.
They flipped through pages and pages of broomstick history, gawking at old illustrations that showed posh women sitting atop a broom with sour expressions on their faces and wind whipping their cumbersome skirts to the right and left. They read the book until Harry nodded off onto Teddy's shoulder.
Harry was knocked out cold a minute later, curled up on the couch. Scorpius tsked and patted Harry's head gently. Draco rolled his eyes at his son's concern before ushering him into the kitchen. Patricia was beginning to prepare dinner when the Malfoys joined her. "How's he doing?" she asked.
to his classmates?! All I am trying to do is bring him out of his shell and all you are doing is pushing him back in. I don't care about your misery. But don't you dare make him miserable with you. You say I have no right?! Well, I
," letting it click open. When Harry shuffled in, he gestured to the bed. Harry sat down, knowing that Teddy was about to give him an earful. Teddy strode forward and stopped in front of his godfather. "Do you know why I'm angry with you?" Harry nodded. "Remember how we're never supposed to lie to each other?" Harry nodded again. "You broke that promise." Harry stared at his hands. "Why would you keep secrets from me?" Teddy pressed on. "I'm not a kid anymore."
"Does he really have a Dark Mark?" a Seventh Year asked, knowing that was what everyone was wondering about.
Harry caught himself on the doorjamb before he could trip over the threshold. He looked at once contrite and bemused, wide-eyed and slack-jawed. "I don't... uh... I mean, is there more?" he stammered.
Harry stifled his exasperated sigh and sat quietly with his hands folded on his lap while he listened to many pieces of unsolicited advice flying at him from all corners of the crowded dining table full of redheads. He was at the Burrow for brunch and he should have known something was up. Rumors had been flying around through Ron's accounts of Harry's talks and Teddy's weekly letters. The Weasleys had heard enough to point incriminating fingers at the Malfoys.
He frowned, clearly offended by Gabrielle's mocking tone. "I'm not." He picked up the sandwich and bit into the jammy spread. Scorpius was rather liberal with the strawberry, jam sliding down the other end of the bread and plopping down on the table. "I don't know what I'm supposed to do," he said between chews. "It was a lot simpler until last week. Now I'm wondering if maybe..." He didn't finish his thought, opting to take another bite of the peace offering instead.
He practically stumbled all the way to his mum and dad as the children dispersed after Gabrielle's short 'thank you' talk. He just wanted to sit in Astoria's lap and cry, but he couldn't possibly do that in front of all his classmates and their parents. He would have to wait until he had gone home.
. Isn't that what you said?" He looked out at the bright blue sky, not a cloud in sight. "Sun's still up." He looked down at her legs. "Feet still on. That's good."
Once again there was silence. Harry might have asked the question more for his sake than anything else. He drew distracted lines on Draco, his fingers moving over pale skin in time with the pulse. This was something that had been on his mind for a while now.
Draco had missed two days of work already. He couldn't afford to get even further behind on tedious paperwork. He was much more productive working in his office than at home. Patricia was still away visiting her mother. If Harry was offering so graciously...
That's exactly what Scorpius did the next day. He waited patiently in the emptying corridor with a lunchbox clutched in his hands, counting the little five-year-old children leaving the classroom. He was nervous, evidenced by his shoe tapping on the floor. If he was nervous, then he was doing the right thing. That's what he kept telling himself. The stream of kids subsided as everyone funneled into the mess hall for lunch. Only once the last student was out the room did Harry appear at the doorway, wand in hand as he began to flick the lights off. He paused when he saw Scorpius in the corridor. "Oh. Hello."
Draco had felt his small black heart grow three times in size that day as he watched his son with friends skipping around the park on the most beautiful spring day. This was a side of Scorpius he rarely witnessed - a rambunctious, playful, excited schoolboy. What more could any father ask for? He looked down at Harry laying beside him, as flushed as the children at the party, mud staining his pants, eyes squeezed shut against the bright sun that was high above them, blades of grass stuck in his hair. Draco reached down and began picking the grass off, to restore some semblance of civility. His fingers twisted between Harry's black locks, a stark contrast of light and dark.
Harry bumped his forehead against Draco's, as if trying to knock some sense into him. "One foot out the door, huh?"
Harry tapped the banquet table with the edge of his wand distractedly, lost in thought. "Hypothetically." He paused and raised his brows at Draco to indicate that he was speaking very hypothetically.
"I can't," Harry blurted out. He deposited the startling figure back into the box and shut the lid. "You can't just give it away."
Draco looked at Harry in disbelief. Scorpius had the same look on his face too as he stepped closer to his father's leg.
Caught completely off guard, Harry snorted and let out a defeated chuckle. He should have known. Luna was the most romantic of them all. He helped her up onto the bank and squeezed her hand hard to show that he appreciated her. "What if you thought of it as damage control?"
Harry looked back to find Draco Malfoy standing with one hand at his hip and the other pressed to his forehead. From the looks of it, he had been interrupted at work as he wore a dark suit that was still creased and polished black shoes that echoed authoritatively on the floor when he tapped his foot. "Potter. Some privacy?" Then he pursed his lips to indicate that he didn't have the time or patience for any arguments.
of an effort than Draco possibly could. The straw that broke the camel's back was Harry lecturing him on the merits of Halloween, of all the godforsaken days to argue about. Draco knew he was on the wrong side of the battle, but he'd be damned if he recognized that in front of Potter. He dropped the bag of candy on the floor of the playroom with an angry huff. All he ever did was indulge them.
"He is," Harry agreed with a twinge of pride in those words. Scorpius was trying so hard to be on his best behaviour. Harry was impressed by how much the boy had changed since that first day at school. He glanced up when Molly tiptoed towards them to unfurl a thin blanket over Scorpius. "Thank you," he mouthed. The Weasleys had done a great job making Scorpius feel at home. Harry was proud of them too.
big." He pretended to hold baby Teddy in his arms. "And now look at you! Almost thirteen. Time flies."
Draco wasn't so sure. "Remember that time, you asked if it were someone else, whether I'd care." The answer was simple. "This would be a lot easier if you weren't Harry Potter." Being Harry Potter in this day and age still held a rather significant amount of power and responsibility. A fling with Draco Malfoy would quite possibly be considered the most irresponsible thing Harry Potter could do. "You're a celebrity. The Golden Boy. People practically worship the ground you walk on." To Scorpius, there was the added dimension of Teddy being his cousin, and by proxy calling Harry Potter his family. When, in the not-so-distant future, Harry and Draco couldn't see eye to eye, it would be Scorpius who would be caught in the middle with no real idea of what happened between them. "I like having a private life, without people scrutinizing my every move. So does Scorpius. It would be a disaster for all of us if anyone found out." Draco decided to leave it at that. This was enough torture for one day. Maybe more tomorrow. "Anyway." He stretched his arms above his head with a quiet groan. "Want to have sex?"
The stew began to sputter, interrupting their conversation. Harry swished his wand at the hob to lower the flames. He got up to give the stew a stir and taste. It was missing a touch of salt. He added a pinch and gave it another stir. "When everything inevitably goes to shit between us-"
"Of course I care!" Scorpius pulled away from Harry. He looked a mess. Tears streaked his flushed face, he had a snotty nose, and his lips were turned down into the saddest frown. "I know what Daddy did when he was a kid," he began, stumbling over his words between sobs. "I know that no one likes him. I know your not-so-proper family doesn't like him. I know
Draco pulled a face behind them before flicking his wand at Astoria's luggage and sending it off to her room.
Draco yanked Harry forward by the shirt before he could finish his gloating. Harry, caught off guard, yelped when he suddenly found himself way too close to Draco and likely due for an oncoming punch. He flinched in anticipation.
Harry smiled wanly as he got up. "He gets nervous. He wants to be perfect for you, that's all." He shrugged. "He's getting better, though. I'll make sure he's more comfortable in front of a crowd."
Harry rubbed the back of his neck when he saw horror wash over Malfoy's face. He had figured as much. He shrugged and said, "I'm just as surprised as you are."
Harry was brushing crumbs off of his hands, having sent the boys off to the dining room to decorate the cookies. He was caught off guard by the question. "No?" He was hesitant because he was unsure if that was the right answer.
Draco hid his face against Harry's shoulder. "He had nightmares last night. I didn't know what to do. I'm fucking useless."
"No, thank you." Harry slipped a finger between the collar and his throat to loosen the noose disguised as formal wear. "Would you like to go?"
made fun of me," Scorpius said in earnest. "He says if you tell people how you feel, then they can take care of you."
"No." Scorpius jumped off the countertop and scurried to the front door. He opened it a crack before Draco could stop him.
First Harry wouldn't let him say a single meaningful thing, and somehow he got the last word in too?
"For God's sake!" Harry exclaimed. "He's six, Draco. If he wants to dress up for one blasted night, let him! It's no skin off of your back."
"There we go. I'm sure he appreciates that." Harry grabbed a chair and dragged it towards the bed so he could sit down next to the Scorpius. The nurse seemed to have tended to the small scrapes on Scorpius' hands and elbows already. Everything looked as good as new except for his healed ankle that still seemed a bit swollen. "Are you aching anywhere else, Scorpius?"
Harry Potter pulled himself out of his muggy dreams only to wake up in his stuffy bedroom with a storm beating against the windowpane. Lightning briefly lit up the cramped space as he blinked groggily to glance around. Just a nightmare, he thought to himself. He swallowed to wet his sandpapery throat before falling back into his sweat-soaked pillows. But just as he curled onto his side, the loud pounding started up again.
Scorpius startled and the book that had been held in his hand fell to the ground with a resounding thud, waking him up. He sat up suddenly. "Dad?"
"Yeah." Scorpius' eyes went wide too. "That's it, Theo! They used to fight when they were boys, but they aren't boys anymore. I need my father to grow up now."
"Oof," she grunted and dropped her luggage on the floor dramatically, all the while keeping her eyes on her ex-husband from over their child's shoulder. He didn't move away from the banister he was leaning against. She scowled at him and pushed her bag forward with her foot. He arched a brow in contempt.
Draco picked Scorpius up and disapparated from the school grounds, landing in their foyer. But he didn't let go. Scorpius let his father hold him, carefully staying still and not saying a word. He knew what Draco meant when he was hugged like this.
from this fantastic magical pub because everything smelled so good. He was used to eating food Patricia made. All of this seemed most exciting. There were many different people inside and outside. They reminded him of busy bees, flitting about in a hurry.
A very amused Theo followed him in and set Scorpius down once they were inside. "Like she was some kind of what?" he asked. Scorpius was startled, so he didn't say a word.
Harry and the boys worked on getting all the gingerbread men out of the oven. Draco set about brewing a much needed pot of coffee while deep in thought.
A minute later, when Scorpius strolled out of his playroom and ran into Harry and Draco in the corridor, he had to do a double take. "Gosh, Harry," he gushed. "You look handsome!"
"What in the bloody hell are you doing here?" Ron swore as he burst into the hospital room with classic Weasley comedic timing. "How is this even possible? You work at a school
"I'm not sure," Draco said after a short pause. "There aren't many opportunities for someone like me."
that their teeth fall out," Scorpius answered honestly. "I tried it one day and I got into trouble. So I don't do that anymore. Instead I told my teacher and they got in more trouble. Serves them right."
Draco caught the pillow and threw it back at Harry, smacking him straight in the face. "I'll see you around, Potter." He walked away with a smile.
Harry nearly jumped out of his skin when a loud shriek erupted beside him, followed by heavy sobbing.
"No." Scorpius snatched the mug from his father and gulped the milk down in three huge swigs. He wiped his milk mustache with the back of his hand as he handed the empty mug back. Draco wrinkled his nose in disgust. "What do you mean he had to go?" Scorpius marched over to his stool and used it to hop up onto the countertop. "He hasn't had his ice-cream yet."
Tom didn’t know why the twisted little thing had decided to come crawling through its door and into his mind, but he was positive that Marvolo had something to do with it. The connection between them was very… he glanced up at the door that had once been labeled ‘ring’, smiling weakly at the iron-plated door that now stood there. The connection was quite... impassable, from Marvolo’s perspective at least.
He jerked, caught off guard by the sudden voice as the short boy beside his lord spoke up, peeking out from behind his lord and leveling an accusatory glare his way. Barty blinked at the shadowed figure, trying to piece together an understanding of the child’s relationship with his lord, or perhaps his lord’s vessel? It seemed unlikely that a Malfoy would bother with Harry Potter, though perhaps harboring his lord’s soul made the boy more appealing to the family.
out between clenched teeth forcing itself to the surface. Xenophilius’ smile widened, and he motioned Theo over to one of the well worn couches as he himself took a seat.
Harry’s eye twitched, rather violently, before he made a point to close his eyes again. Blaise pursed his lips, sparing Daphne a long-suffering glance that she happily returned. He didn’t try to poke the beast again though, knowing that Theo was apparently no longer viable as a discussion topic.
Harry sighed, shrugging on his shirt as the massive, shadowy mass of his owl, Hades, soared through the window. The creation of Death stared at him blankly, its large golden-green eyes blinking out at him from behind inky-black feathers. They stared at each other for a moment, blankly, before Hades dropped a crumpled envelope from his beak onto the floor, before flying out the window again without a single noise to his coming and going. Harry looked at the envelope now lying on his floor for a moment, studying it, before his eyes skated over to Luna’s letter, sitting on his desk with a few sparse pieces of glitter still stuck to it.
Perhaps more importantly than the nonsense with Sirius, was Barty Crouch. Harry had, somehow, managed to set aside a few sparse seconds of the past week to discuss things with the half-crazed and, oddly enough, genuinely loyal man, though the entire ordeal with the psycho had barely been much of a thought in his mind as the final days of summer crept to a close. Now that the majority of his issues had come to a successful finish, the death eater was seemingly all he could keep his mind on for an extended period.
"Here," Draco said as he pulled the backpack away from Scorpius' shoulders. "No need to act so thrilled."
"Because you shouldn't." Scorpius then resorted to actively turning his back to Harry. He scooted away quickly before hunching over and pressing his hands against his ears so he could read in peace.
The class worked on their alphabets for the first half of the day, which was a chore in itself. Then it was time to get ready for their winter pageant. There was organized chaos in nearly every corner of the room. Gabrielle helped some of them with their costumes while others practiced their singing loud and proud. There was loads of shouting and giggling going on. Harry had a few of the quieter children help him set up the classroom. Scorpius diligently pasted drawings on the wall by the blackboard. He hoped his mother would love his drawings. He had worked quite hard. She had liked everything he had shown her so far. He couldn't wait for her to hear him sing. Gabrielle said he had a lovely singing voice, but he just needed to be louder. He had been practicing in his bathroom where his voice sounded
"It's okay that you do." Scorpius pulled his legs up onto the couch, cross-legged. As if readying himself for a long conversation. Draco had to stifle his groan. Scorpius didn't notice as he went on to say, "Do you know something? I think it's okay that you like someone other than Mum."
Harry examined him for a beat. All those years spent in Hogwarts with Malfoy and he had seen this expression on him once and only once. This defeated, depressed and embarrassed expression had been very apparent on Malfoy's face just before Ron knocked him out with a punch after calling him a 'two-faced bastard'. All those years ago, Harry had reveled in that expression. Malfoy had deserved every bit of humiliation for what he and his family had done. Back then, Harry didn't think twice of leaving the boy to fend for himself in the Battle of Hogwarts.
"I know. I didn't really... That is, Teddy and I didn't really give them a chance to back out." Not for the lack of trying. Draco had tried to talk his son out of it. He had snapped at Harry for interfering. He had thrown fits. When reason and arguments fell on deaf ears, Draco had had no choice but to go with the flow.
“Was this my fault?” He whispered, staring at the large expanse of wall in front of him. It seemed that he had reached the back of the store, somehow. Theo rubbed a hand down his face, groaning into his clammy palm as he realized how far from the group he had strayed in his pondering. He couldn’t even hear the others anymore.
“Of course, we found that the stone would slowly start to chip away as it was used, so every two centuries or so we would… well, the death toll didn’t need to be nearly as high, just a few hundred people here and there.” Harry bit down tighter onto the inside of his cheek, thinking of Draco and how he was
understand either, so after a brief pause of attempting to understand, he gave up and nodded along anyway. She seemed to understand that he didn’t understand, and gave him a patent smile, setting down her cup of coffee as she reached for another pastry.
he could manage it. Right? He had been planning to give the Black lordship to Draco anyway, since Sirius clearly didn’t want it and he didn’t have any use for it besides the title and galleons in the vault. He could write to Griphook and get the paperwork sorted before the new year without much difficulty. He could manage it. He could do it. Draco would be okay. He would be angry and upset and separate from his cowardly,
She reminded herself, about to focus back on the task at hand before she was unwittingly pulled away by the headmaster’s commanding voice.
“Yes!” She squeaked, immediately climbing up onto the couch and rather brazenly clutching his arm. Draco made a noise between amusement and annoyance as she did, and Harry quickly leveled him with a look that he hoped was slightly pleading. Draco merely rolled his eyes, before turning away. Taking that as an agreement, Harry let it go, rubbing his eyes with his one free hand as Gabrielle clutched tighter to his arm.
He pat her large hand comfortingly, before standing, an empty wine glass in one hand. “Think nothing of it, my dear. By the way, I do apologize for not inviting you to celebrate my birthday. Me and Perenelle were scrambling to prepare our house for a summer guest, so there really wasn’t much of a celebration to begin with.”
"Cicatrice...? Oh! Ça doit être Harry Potter! Le garçon britannique avec la cicatrice en forme d'éclair, non?" The distinct sound of someone saying his name was unmistakable, but Harry held back the urge to turn around and look for the perpetrators. The young voice that was speaking made him feel like it was just some kid talking a bit too loudly.
Harry stood there silently for a moment, watching as his soulmate disappeared into the fire, before he glanced back over his shoulder.
Harry screeched, his voice layering on top of several others and distorting beyond repair as he ripped his hand away from his face, glaring at the man with all the hatred he could muster. Crouch yelped, pressing himself further backwards into the sharp stone wall in an effort to disappear into the cracks between each brick. Harry seethed for a moment, glaring down at the object of his abject fury, before hissing out another curse and turning sharply towards the wall behind him, taking out his anger on the old stone instead of Crouch’s face as inescapable thoughts of
Draco grinned, feeling affection bubble up from his chest as Harry’s voice tapered off. ”Yeah? I climbed a tree.”
The man laughed, finally turning to face him from across the room. Theo realized that his eyes appeared to be unseeing-staring off into the middle distance as if there was nothing to look at. Was the man blind? “Oh I’m sure you know who I am referencing, young man. Or do you not know of the cold eyes of Fate?”
Draco : "Et tu es bien trop jeune et... femelle pour qu'il te voie d'une façon romantique, donc on dirait que j'ai de bien meilleurs chances, non?"
The man was pale, almost unnervingly so, and his hands shook slightly as he carefully folded the letter back up and clutched it tightly in his offhand. She watched as he flexed the fingers of his free hand, before reaching up and adjusting his wand’s holster from where it was fastened around his forearm.
“I’ll be fourteen in a month or so, yeah.” Harry hadn’t really thought about his birthday much that month. He briefly considered that it might be a good idea to write to the Dursleys, just to see how they’re fairing without him. “It lines up rather well actually. Since I've got a summer birthday I’ll always have the number in my age, so this’ll be my fourth year.”
Theo stood very still, studying his grandfather as he contemplated the fury inside of him. It was so… potent. He couldn’t quite figure out why. For so long he had pushed himself aside for the issues and demons that his friends had, perhaps this was him finally rebelling from that? It certainly made sense. After all, why did it always have to be him who held back from everything? Why did he have to be the put together one? Harry and Blaise clearly went about whatever they liked, constantly going against his subtle advice despite knowing that he held knowledge of the future. Draco was hardly any different, and always reacted with fire and fury if there was ever an instance of anything even remotely upsetting happening.
The perpetrator had him between a rock and a hard place, and there was no plausible way out. Albus had been played like a fool, the faceless murderer getting away with it while striking a decisive blow on Albus’ own forces. Was it Tom? No, the man was ingenious but didn’t have the ability to maneuver in such a way, especially if he was simply possessing Harry Potter as Albus suspected. It was possible that Tom had written to one of his death eaters, but all of the most loyal of Voldemort’s followers were rotting away in Azkaban or dead, and Albus found it unlikely that all the others who had served Tom would be so inclined to help him without physical proof that he had returned. Or… Albus’ eyes widened, a realization slowly dawning on him. Had Tom already regained his body? If he truly had Harry Potter’s body under his control, then was it at all possible for him to have done some sort of ritual to regain form?
“Of course, because you were certainly brewing that potion. Tell me, dear, how much of it did you actually make?”
He paused abruptly, halting the budding rant in order to gaze out into the empty hall, an indescribable emotion bubbling up from his throat as very a far more distinguishable unease slowly set in.
“This is the question that you have for me, isn’t it. You want to know if I’m willing to go that far.” Nicolas looked stricken, his face pinched as Harry finally looked up and stared him down. “My answer is the same, if that's what you want to know. I’ll still make one, no matter the costs.”
“Twelve galleons for the pouch and that rock, Luv. And tell Harry Potter that I hope his afterlife is going well.”
He wondered distantly, slowing to a stop in front of the half-closed door as another voice rose up from inside. He stopped for a moment, momentarily caught between his concern and manners, before throwing it all to the wind and silently pushing the door inwards, eyes scanning the room for anything out of the ordinary. He stopped short as he caught sight of Harry in one of the chairs, with a look of utter exhaustion across his face and Perenelle, standing over him with her brows furrowed and a hand resting on his shoulder.
“That is a hope of mine, yes.” He replied, wincing at the strained tone to his voice. Luna didn’t even look up, still humming as she waited for the wax to melt. It was quiet for a time, in which Theo took a moment to glance around Luna’s beautifully decorated room, as that morning had been the first time he had stepped foot inside and he had been too concerned for her to pay it any attention. It was rather on theme with the rest of the house, to say the very least, with trinkets and things covering every available surface, including Luna’s bed. The walls were, strangely enough, just as cluttered as the horizontal surfaces, covered with beautifully painted pictures that ranged from portraits to landscapes to song phrases and poems. It was all moving too, the people smiling and laughing silently, moving through the landscapes without a care. It was a bit unsettling, but in a strangely fitting way-like Luna had pulled her own soul out of her chest and painted pictures with it.
Draco: "And you are far too young and... female for him to ever see you in a romantic way, so I suppose I have far better chances, hm?"
“Perenelle?” He called, Draco stopping in step with him as well, realizing the situation as well before quickly pulling out his wand, lighting a lumos as the old woman turned to face them from a few paces ahead, her own wand alight and glowing faintly. “Why are we out in the woods? The campsite was ages ago.”
Draco blinked, mouth opening slightly as he nearly chided Harry for being utterly full of shit. He held back the thought though, strainingly smiling instead before shakily taking the plate of biscuits and cup of tea that Perenelle offered to him. He set both onto the table, mind running through every little thing that happened in the past week as he slowly dunked one of the biscuits into the tea. Something about Harry was incredibly off, in a way that he couldn’t easily ignore, but he also couldn’t ignore that Harry clearly didn’t want to talk about it. It was so obvious, that even Perenelle seemed to be trying to change the subject matter towards something else. At least, her hovering seemed to be insinuating that much.
He turned a corner sharply, quickly traversing through the nonsensical halls on a straight path towards his room. Everything was packed and ready, and Luna’s father as well as his grandfather had already agreed to it over letter, so there was nothing stopping him from taking what he and Cantankerous had both agreed would be a well deserved break.
Draco’s voice was searing, and Harry muttered an agreement as he edged closer to the warmth, hand coming over to grip Draco’s robe as he settled his head on the shorter boy’s boney shoulder. There was a shuffling behind them, and a soft something danced across his cheek. A feather, maybe? He didn’t have time to question it, not as his eyelids grew heavier and the warmth all around him encompassed his cold body like a cocoon. He was sound asleep within seconds, his entire body slouched along the seat, his legs stretched out in front of him and head resting heavily on his soulmate’s shoulder.
Purple erupted across his vision, the floor giving way to light as he spun through space. Draco tensed his body, tightening his hold on the trunks as the force threatened to rip them both away from him. The intensity of the international floo seemed to be
“What’s wrong…?” He echoed, watching as Draco’s eyes narrowed, a frustrated blush racing up his neck as he leaned forward across the coffee table threateningly. Harry coughed into his hand, averting the accusatory eyes as the feeling of Draco’s gaze burning a hole into his skull became noticeably more pronounced.
Turning a corner, Nicolas stopped dead at the sight of horrendously colored robes, the gaudiness of which feeling particularly familiar in a particularly unpleasant way. They were a bright purple in hue, with a vaguely maroon-like coloring as trim. He grimaced, considering if he should just turn tail and run.
No, cold wasn’t the right word to describe the emotions racing through them both. They were hard, stiff, unyielding feelings, bogged down by shock and fear to the point that all Harry could do was take the brunt of it so Draco could actually
He had always wished desperately to keep Harry safe, because the woman that had died for his creation had given up her life in the pursuit of that very wish.
There was another, far more tired sigh from Tom, who just waved vaguely in the air as they reached the bottom steps and traversed the hallway towards the large circular door. “I don’t understand it any more than you do, I assure you, but it’s the only explanation.”
“I do wish we could reconnect, Nicolas. I am deeply regretful for how I have treated you in the past.”
Pansy had been born when her youngest brother was twenty three, and had come into the world just barely before her mother experienced menopause. Her father, who was a decade older and far past the time in which a man was producing enough to reasonably have children, had taken it upon himself to call the pregnancy a miracle of magic, and had been very vocal about some sort of male-tailored fertility potion that he had used to get the job done. Shockingly, no one had questioned it for even a second, as he was known to be rather spry for his age. The pregnancy had gone on well enough, and Pansy had been born a healthy baby girl nine months later. Of course, no one outside of her older brothers were told the truth of her conception, and despite her parents seeming quite happy with the situation now that their reputation was not at stake, the ‘family dynamics’ had quickly taken root. She had not grown up with any siblings in a traditional sense and had actually been rather spoiled, but each time one of her eldest brothers visited, the family dynamics quickly came into play.
“Centaurs and the Worship of Callisto? No that's not-why are so many of these about centaurs?” He grumbled to himself morosely, eyes darting over the worn letters on the spines of ancient tomes. Despite the various and immense issues that he had had with Cantankerous Nott over the expanse of his years, Theo could admit that the man at least cared for his grandson and wished him the best. Of course, what was best for him was oftentimes up for debate, and Theo had the long-standing opinion that the man’s idea of ‘best’ was rather skewed towards him having a place in high society. As it was, by his grandfather’s logic, more recent events were most certainly
He considered later on in the day that it was very likely his grandfather had seen the defiance in his eyes a few seconds before he actually spoke, as the man swung just as he had opened his mouth. The second slap was sharper than the first, but Theo didn’t let himself react to it besides a jerk of the head, already having expected it.
Harry's horcrux ie. the OG: Tom Riddle. Repeat nickname(s) (there are a lot of one-offs): Riddle, Tom, and dad
Lavender Brown had never been one of his favorite people, of that there was little doubt, but she did make a remarkably efficient timepiece. He should take advantage of permanent transfigurations more often.
"Je veux aller lui parler Fleur! S'il te plaît?" There. He heard the name clear as day. Harry cursed under his breath as he connected the dots and began scrambling to set the pile of clothes down in the least ridiculous manner possible.
“How much polyjuice have you prepared?” He questioned quietly, eyes narrowing in on the makeshift potions setup that was currently taking over the kitchen table. Crouch surged forward, scrambling around Harry in a wide circle that would have been comical if Harry was in the mood to enjoy the man’s terror. Instead, he merely rolled his eyes, wondering if he should really be putting so much trust in a man who was scared shitless after being kicked in the chin
I like to think that all gods and goddesses, in this story at least, have green around the exterior of their iris, and then a different color around the pupil. This is because I see green as this tie-in with not only death (the killing curse) but also life (plants? lol idk) so it is this great equalizer that signifies immortality in a way. I want to incorporate this concept into the story during this book especially, mostly because (as the title hints) Harry will be doing a lot with his creature side and all the bells and whistles that come with that.
“Merlin, please don’t,” Draco mumbled, yanking him further along towards the fireplace. Harry made a noise of protest as Perenelle pulled out a handkerchief and began dabbing at her eyes. The blond stopped for a moment, eyes closed and heavy, before he turned to the elder couple with a fatigued smile. “Thank you for your hospitality. I will send word of my potioneering explorations if you’re interested, Perenelle.”
“It is a pleasure to meet you, Lord and Lady Flamel.” He finally forced out, the effort making him feel as though he was one more attempt away from losing his breakfast. A woman laughed, the distinct scratching of porcelain against wood causing him to, after a pained pause, look away from the heels of his hands. A teacup filled to the brim with steaming hot tea was now sitting next to him on the coffee table, and the older woman who had seemingly pushed it his way smiled kindly. He blinked, taken back by her appearance. How could someone look so young and so old at the same time? Her hair was white as a sheet and her hands and face were old and wrinkled, but there was a feeling of potent childishness about her that felt incredibly out of place. She looked timeless, whatever timelessness was supposed to look like.
Harry stopped where he stood, squinting in confusion as he watched the ‘ink’ swirl around in an oblong glass jar. “How is that possible? Bottling your own magic, that is.”
Twenty minutes and three bags of tea later, Harry felt the wall of ice around him slowly grow as he stared blankly at his cup of steadily cooling tea with absence, slowly stirring it with his spoon as his mind swam from one thought to the next. Ever since reading Luna’s letter the night before he had been feeling disjointed, somewhat separated from reality as if he had been forcefully removed from it. Lucius Malfoy’s letter certainly hadn’t helped, and now that he had calmed down from the initial anger all he could feel was… detachment. Confusion and frustration and detachment from everything else. He would call it horrible if he could even grasp the emotions. Was he going into shock?
“Oh how curious! You must be 'ere with your family then, yes? I certainly wouldn’t 'ave been allowed into another country at your age.”
Harry bit the inside of his cheek accidentally, cursing as crumbs of the biscuit came tumbling out of his mouth as he lurched forward. Perenelle laughed, patting his shoulder as he coughed in an attempt to clear his throat.
Locket howled with anger as Tom grabbed the back of the seat again and started pulling it towards the door, deteriorating from hysterics to insanity as it lost all humanity it had left, thrashing about like a caged dog as he dragged it deep into its own mind, chains and all still keeping it tied down to the chair that was quickly turning into a small, maddening confined prison.
Jolting, Barty nearly fell out of the chair, scrambling for stability as his legs flew out haphazardly, his arms barely managing to keep under the security of the invisibility cloak as he fought for balance. Gripping at the armrests, he sucked a deep breath in, eyes wide and crazed as his head swiveled around the room, searching out his father instinctively. The man wasn’t there, he hadn’t been for the entire game. Heartbeat in his ears, Barty took great gulps of air, entire body electrified as he gazed around the room in wonder. Why had his father broken the imperious? Why then, of all times? How? Where had he been? The thoughts and questions swam through his head, disrupting all other thoughts as he fought to understand the autonomy he was suddenly being allowed.
Theo stared at the man blankly, before silently turning around and leaving the kitchen, writing off Xenophilius’ words as nonsense. They usually were anyway, so he really shouldn’t have been expecting much.
as his fist met the brick and shattered it. His vision was overtaken by red, his anger clouding his judgment as he whipped around and slapped the letter down onto his desk, shaking with unsuppressed rage. What exactly did Lucius Malfoy think would come of asking a
He had no idea what had caused the resounding noise, but it had to be something that one of the horcruxes had done, especially considering that the doors to them were on the west wall where the noise had originated. He could easily cross out the diadem and cup as potential culprits, as both had been the last of his horcruxes besides Harry and were either too bitter or too passive to want to destroy or hurt him in any way. Despite being created at almost the same time, the passive magics prevalent in both Slytherin’s locket and Hufflepuff’s cup that he had not been able to get rid of had deeply influenced both shards of his soul in very different ways. The cup was far more inclined towards empathy, something that had made it considerably depressed over the past decades, especially considering all that he had done in his life. The locket was much different, and had seemingly lost its mind, to say the very least. He wouldn’t put this past the locket in any respect, but already had a sneaking suspicion that neither were at fault.
Draco let the smile win out over his common sense as Harry howled with laughter, falling back against the plush couch cushions as his joyous voice echoed through the sitting room, his previous anger and Draco’s own concern well and truly forgotten as Draco grabbed for a nearby throw pillow, intent on getting revenge for the embarrassment he had experienced, regardless of if Perenelle made them clean up the scattered feathers afterwards or not.
The entity's eyes glimmered in amusement, “I'm sure you both think that way. Pick a new name, soul shard, or remain nameless.”
The blond didn’t reply, his expression shifting quickly from disgusted to cagey, and in an instant he quickened his stride, practically
was going on with Draco and Harry. Well, mainly just Draco; he had decided sometime over the summer to just...
“I believe that… yes, right here.” With a rather subdued flourish, Crouch pulled a large box from beneath jars of various potions ingredients, undoing the latch to reveal a case full of expertly crafted and packaged vials of polyjuice. Harry hummed, leaning in slightly to pick one up and observe the color.
smell things? You’re just a soul with no physical form. You’re incapable of feeling anything that a soul can’t feel you-you are aware that smells and taste fall under that category, right? You’ve never been able to taste the tea you serve when I’m here-”
The week before his birthday went on that way, with the days as uniform as they were leisurely. Each day started with him waking early, eating breakfast with Perenelle and eventually Draco, until the three of them would then wander down to the potions laboratory for a few hours. Around lunch Nicolas would find him and drag him away for the rest of the day, and then all four of them would reconvene for dinner, chatting about what they had done and what they had learned. After that, everyone would go in various directions, with Harry and Draco tending to stay in the parlor and talk until they either had nothing left to talk about or didn’t feel the need. Sometime after that they would both be tired enough to call it a day, and would depart to bed, only to start it all over again the next day.
Harry let out a sigh, closing his eyes as he pulled away from her warm embrace. “Thank you. I think… I think that I need to take some time after today just to think about things. A lot is going on right now that I don’t understand and need to start making sense of.”
The two shared a heavy look, one that conveyed far more than he could discern. Harry felt himself wilt slightly, regret for his situation growing quickly as Perenelle reached over and settled her other hand on his upper arm.
They pushed through the crowd slowly, though it was marginally easier than Harry expected it to be. Students got out of his way quickly enough, and their parents swiftly followed suit, all of them with odd looks on their faces as they regarded him. Harry didn’t know if the expressions were because of his height or because of who he was, but he couldn’t really bring himself to care. If he needed to use his infamy or stature to his advantage, then he damn well would.
He let out a stifled snort, finishing the bite that had been in his mouth before replying. “That’s just fine with me. I actually have a few questions for you, if you wouldn’t mind answering them.”
“I ask you this, Tom Riddle, and I beg that you consider the question before all this ends and my consciousness falls away into yours. Will Hadrian Potter be the cause of Ragnarök, or will he be Ragnarök itself? And, because I truly must ask, has he already become it?”
As soon as it had started, everything began to slow, and Draco forced his eyes open, searching for his footing as the ground got closer and closer at a shockingly fast speed. He winced slightly on impact, stumbling forward several feet before managing to right himself, nausea quickly making itself an issue as the world swam around his face.
It seemed as though all of Britain was holding its breath, waiting to converge in on him like a swarm of locusts.
“Brilliant, thank you, Potter.” He wheezed out, barely managing it before he was back to fighting down his stomach, waging a war against his body with nothing but determination and a desire not to vomit all over his shoes. A large hand landed on his back, rubbing soothing circles into the space between his shoulder blades and wings. Draco let out a low groan, swallowing down the burning bile as the distinct sound of someone vomiting hit his ears.
She turned to him again, a small pouch of purple silk in one hand as she sent a knowing, pointed wink his way. “And if that boy was destined to die in May and not October, then that’s what I had to make happen. You understand that, don’t you Luv?”
“It’s going to be okay, Dray. I’m here and I’m not leaving.” He whispered quietly, carding a hand through Draco’s unusually messy hair as the fire slowly, steadily started to dull from the blazing blue inferno to a familiar red, before slowly simmering out into harmless sparks, the fury all but extinguished.
“I fear Death, yes, but I also fear its master.” Tom looked up sharply, his eyes blown wide. He opened his mouth, unsure of what he would even say, before the blue-eyed man continued without pause. “I fear what will come of the world when you go through with this plan. Is it wise to give the boy even more power than he already has? He already is plotting to kill tens of thousands of muggles as it is, what else will come of his rampage once you bestow onto him this gift? Will the world be destroyed or saved for it? Can you be certain that he deserves-”
That was when the thought finally struck him, so obvious in its simplicity and yet completely and utterly impossible.
Glaring at the mysterious letter for a moment, Harry weighed his options. Clearly, something about Luna’s letter was putting him on guard, but it was a ridiculous notion to think that every little thing from here on out would be just as discomforting. He was being ridiculous.
“Focus on the most pressing concerns, Albus, and everything else will follow.” He reminded himself, straightening back up in his chair with a sigh. First, he would come to a decision on what to do about Lupin, now that the man was safely locked away in a safehouse where the ministry would not find him. If he decided to throw Lupin to the wolves, he would simply bring the man to the ministry with the pretext that he had hunted him down, feeling partially responsible for both the man’s crimes and his peculiar escape from law enforcement. If he decided to side with the man, then there would be much deliberation over what had to be done, but such a thing would take even more time to consider. The next thing to do would be to write to not only Hermione Granger, but to Madam Maxime as well, and open up a discussion between the two over Miss. Granger’s potential return to Hogwarts for a year. Perhaps he would argue that the girl had far too many friends still at Hogwarts, and forcing her away from them so suddenly would be unhealthy and cruel. If that didn’t work, he would go to Nicolas and try to save their withering friendship and ask the man for help.
He couldn’t help but return his gaze to where the iron shelf now laid, knowing what was beyond it had to be the ring horcrux’s mind. How that was even possible was beyond him. The only way for the door to have been removed but the connection to have remained would be if the ring somehow gained a body or form, making it the main soul and therefore giving it power over his own mind.
Something about the way it moved was off-putting to him. It was… separate from the whole, if that was even possible. It felt incredibly different from the rest of Harry, in the most innate sense. It was
Luna’s bedroom was her very favorite place in her home. The walls were covered with murals that she had painted over the years, some only a year old and a few that her mother and father had helped her with when the woman was still alive. Some of the murals were simply landscapes, weaving around corners and dipping out of sight behind her bed, but others were of people important to her, and of phrases that she felt resonated with her. It was busy, admittedly, but the busyness was comforting in a way, only elevated by all the decorations she included in the space. Hanging from the ceiling were wind chimes, several elaborate woven strings of twine weaved around rocks, and a few new additions of hand-made dream catchers. They were all beautiful, and all wonderful to listen to when there was a breeze, which there was quite often in the summer months when she kept her windows wide open. Well, except for the dream catchers, which were surprisingly silent-likely because they were made of feathers and string. She liked the dreamcatchers plenty despite that, sure, but they had a certain uselessness to them that she felt rather bitter about. Simply put, Luna didn’t think they helped with her dreams all that much. Though… maybe she was putting the label of ‘dream’ onto the wrong things. Her nightmares about her mother had stopped after all, even though the red woman continued to visit her.
Has anyone realized that I don't know how to draw children yet? I'm so glad that I can get away with making them all look pretty grown up-ish now because I was really suffering through those first three years. Harry and Draco here are likely my very favorite drawings in the entire thing. I really enjoyed adding Draco's canonical 'pointy-ness' to the drawing while still keeping the personality that I have made for him in this story. I know that, at this point, my Harry is a completely different person than canonical Harry, but I think that that is a healthy distinction. In making an AU that strays so far away from the canon as this one, it is important to really
“Yes, it is the amount of blood in ten thousand full grown men, to be precise.” Harry felt his fingers clench around the table as Nicolas watched him. He had known there would be a price-there always was after all. But ten thousand muggle men… it was so much. It was
“Have you considered, dear Favorite, that you are misplacing emotions onto my daughter? Yes yes, that is very possible, you know.” The man remarked, his eyes still pinned onto the jar of honey. Theo didn’t notice the look, or the expression of sharp focus on Xenophilius' face. Instead, he just scoffed, crossing his arms as he began to tap out a jerky beat on his left shoulder.
I've been messing around with Daphne's aesthetic quite a bit, and while I think she could rock any other vibe if I put her in it, I just really wanted to draw a veil (lol). I said it was goth on the drawing but it's really more of a gothic cottagecore than anything. Tracey, on the other hand (since she was raised predominantly in the muggle world) wears very much what your typical 90's kid would, though I've added some casual slytherin pride to that as well. Blaise, on the other hand, was just used as my excuse to draw a turtle neck because I thought that one would look really good on him. (why did I draw Tracey and Daphne's hands like that? Like, why did you do that, past me? Were  you trying to insinuate 'gal-pal' with their friendship even though Daphne is straight? Oh well too late now.)
Searing, unimaginable pain screamed through his soul, disrupting every sensor and attacking every phycological nerve until he was writhing in agony. The golden-green strings surged forward, multiplying by the second as they forced his soul back together. He screamed louder, feeling as every little inch of him was overtaken and forced to rewind and come apart only to be reformed together again. Every millisecond was utter agony that he felt as his very existence was rewound and reworked.
Harry bit the inside of his cheek, shifting from one foot to another as the scratch of a quill overtook the silence. “I’m… well, somewhat.”
Draco sobbed, the fire burning bright blue as his wings flew outwards, reacting and trying to propel him up into the sky. Harry grit his teeth, centering himself as he tightened his grip to force them both to stay on the ground. He wouldn’t let Draco fly away from him to deal with the heartache alone, not after everything that had happened that day, and the weeks and months before that.
“Mr. Lovegood, some of my friends are going out shopping for school books and other supplies on the third of August and invited Luna, is that alright with you?” He asked, turning away from the window with the letter still in hand, glancing over the postscript with furrowed brows. Just what was going on at Hogwarts next year? That certainly seemed to be the question, though the answer was evading him at every turn.
He tried to keep his focus away from the display, feeling as though he had just intruded upon something.
Theo seemed to be doing well enough at her home, though he seemed to do well enough whenever she was around him so she rather thought that that wasn’t particularly unusual. He did seem troubled with something however, which she could understand to be relating to his rather fun prophecy that he had been relaying to her daddy the week before. She thought that it was a tad concerning, especially now that he seemed to have solidified his distrust in Harry before he was even done being angry at him! Really, Luna lived her life by the ideology that one should never commit to anything while they were angry, as it was bound to cause issues further down the line.
“Alright.” He started warily, watching with a mix of curiosity and confusion as his mentor placed the full jar next to an empty one. “But
The old crone barked a laugh, the noise grating against his ears as it echoed through the store. “Oh, not at all Luv! That poor boy was a rare case. Most people who need my help would only lose something important to them, like a leg or their family, not their life!”
Harry couldn’t bring himself to be surprised. Considering the over five centuries of marriage the two had shared together, he had doubted since meeting them that they were anything but soulmates. He doubted that any couple could manage to stay faithful to one another for all those years, and surely would have left each other for other things and people at some point in time. It certainly didn’t help that he saw a comfort between them that reflected how he felt with Draco, though like most things he had been too busy with his studies and too nervous about overstepping any boundaries to ask about it and confirm his theory.
He couldn’t help but grimace again, watching as Gabrielle gave another great tug at her sister’s hand before finally being let free. He steeled himself as she rammed into his leg again and held tight, her head resting on his hip as if she had not a care in the world.
He was pulled from the thought as Harry’s hands let go of his, and instead reached up and brushed along both of his temples with cold, feather-light touches. Draco froze, his heartbeat skyrocketing as Harry’s hands lowered slightly and cradled his face, the other boy’s thumbs brushing softly against his cheeks. He looked up and caught Harry’s eyes, his own blow wide as the other boy continued to brush gentle touches across his cheeks and jaw.
“Of course Mr. Malfoy, I would be happy to help wherever I am necessary. Now, I suppose you two must have much to get caught up on.” This statement was punctuated with a strangely pointed look in Harry’s direction, one that did good to confuse Draco even more. “So I’ll be taking care of things in my laboratory if either of you need anything from me. Tata!”
Barty watched his fingers as they rested on his thighs, his thighs resting on the wooden seat underneath him. Nothing moved, not even a twitch, just as it had been for hours upon days upon years upon a decade. He tried to reach out, tried grasping for some semblance of bodily autonomy with strained effort, but nothing changed. Nothing ever did. His fingers did not twitch, or shift from where they had been sitting for five hours now, nor would they ever. His legs had gone numb, feet even more so, and there was a wretched crick in his neck that refused to go away. If he could move, even for one moment, maybe he would be able to give himself some manner of relief, but relief would never come. He would never move without his father deciding that he would, and would not get to choose what he would do once his father did indeed allow his body movement.
The universe has a very funny way of making things happen, regardless of if you want them to or not.
Draco just stared at him, before an unbelievably sharp smile cracked across his face as well. Harry stiffened slightly, watching as Draco shook his head before taking the plate of biscuits and cup of tea as it was handed to him by the ever-attentive Perenelle. He didn’t look like he believed a single word Harry was saying.
“Shall we be off then?” She questioned cheerily, getting a quick nod from him as Draco didn’t stop walking, continuing forward on a warpath as he continued to drag Harry along behind him. Harry wanted to ask if he was alright, or if he had done something wrong to make Draco upset in the first place, but forced the idea away. Draco had been feeling understandably wound up for the past month, and Harry was hardly going to go out of his way to agitate him for no reason.
“I’m… my name’s Barty.” He mumbled, not quite sure what to do with the woman’s questions as his lord continued to seemingly ignore him in favor of the Malfoy boy with him.
“Mhm.” Came the reply, his lord’s tone a familiar blend of uninterested and cruel. Barty shrunk back, eyes ripping down to look at the dirt beneath him as that burning gaze latched back onto him. His lord didn’t sound forgiving today. Perhaps he should have attempted an escape from his father sooner.
Harry watched blankly as the Veela took the field, the roars of adoring fans echoing through the amphitheater. He observed as they started to dance, watching the display with idle curiosity and nothing more. If anything, he was feeling compelled to look
“Not before the Quidditch world cup, I would wager.” Said Tom, his voice edging towards amused as he spoke from… behind him-?
“And I want you to thank Sir Flamel for apprenticing Hadrian. It is a great honor, and such a thing does not happen very often. The last person to be apprenticed under the man was headmaster Dumbledore after all.”
He had not spoken to the Frenchman in some time, ever since Harry Potter’s first year and the issues with the philosopher’s stone. He was certain that Nicolas would still be angry with him, but perhaps enough time had passed that the man would be willing to make amends. The least he could do was write a letter, if nothing else.
The Burrow was packed with festivities in lieu of Ginny's return from her tour with the team. Molly had spent the entire day cooking and cleaning, charging her children with chores and chiding the little ones when they got in the way. The table was set with the most delicious food that George and Bill kept sneaking morsels of. Not all of the Weasleys could make it, but the ones that could were enough to make a racket in the house. Ginny was the coolest aunt, after all.
Standing in front of the Malfoys was a young boy in a purple jumper and green overalls, with mussed-up brown hair, freckled cheeks, and an ear-splitting grin revealing brilliant white teeth.
Harry's irritation was plainly visible on his face when he answered. That expression softened immediately when he saw Draco's weary eyes and slumped shoulders.
Draco sat next to Scorpius and handed over the leaves he had collected. "I found them near work. I thought you might like them," he said. "Do you?"
"What's the rush? Keep the Christmas spirit up a bit longer. I love Christmas." Harry closed his tired eyes. "I had a good time today." He waited for a response. When he was met with silence, he cracked an eye open to watch Draco, who was standing in front of the tree, idly fiddling with some of the glittering ornaments, a cup of eggnog in the other hand, making a concerted effort not to answer, apparently. Harry shut his eye and yawned. "How about you? Did you have a good time?" He paused again, waiting. Silence again. He smiled thoughtfully before saying, "You can say yes, Draco. You're allowed to have fun."
"I might have." Harry was sheepish, because he knew Scorpius had been hesitant about those artworks.
A strange prickle ran up Draco's spine. Behind his hand, he felt a steady thumping at Harry's chest. "I haven't done anything..."
"Just an accident," Harry reassured Scorpius. "I was trying to catch one of my boys who took a tumble and I got hurt. People make a big deal when I hurt myself. I didn't break my neck, so don't worry anymore. They mended me in a jiffy. I'm feeling much better now."
"I'm bringing Scorpius and Teddy over next week," he said over the loud arguments in an attempt to shush them. "And you know how Teddy gets when you say no to him."
Harry stepped away from the kiss with a quiet laugh and a baffled shake of his head. Teddy had clapped his hands over his eyes, dramatically crying, "I've gone bliiiind." Scorpius was gawking at the two men, blushing pink all over.
"It's been interesting," Harry said abruptly. "Scorpius and Teddy get along. Then again, Teddy gets along with everyone. When I brought Scorpius to the Burrow, I was nervous. But they took him along with them the whole day. And now I've been teaching Scorp to fly. He got a new broom a month ago. So... it's been interesting." He dropped his gaze to his scone and started to spread jam on it.
And that's how Harry ended up spending a Saturday morning at the grounds of Malfoy Manor with Scorpius, a dish full of bird seed, and a large metal cage with a stick propping up the door. The two of them camped out behind a tree until lunchtime before giving up because they couldn't feel their toes and their stomachs were rumbling. When they trudged back into the manor, they were met with Draco, who had on an I-told-you-so expression, which was entirely unhelpful, and bowls of piping hot beef stew, which was entirely helpful. The cold bird hunters slurped up their lunch with gusto. An hour later, the three of them went back out to the orchard to find an empty dish, an upside down cage, and disturbed mud. Scorpius was ecstatic.
Dejected, he sat on the bathroom floor, all hope lost. He inspected his broken-now-mended wrist. He touched his painful ribs, feeling the gauze running diagonally across his torso. He brushed his thumb over his swollen eye. He licked his split lips. "Pathetic.”
Scorpius eyed the jams. He wanted something sweet, not salty. Harry observed him for a moment before reaching over to split the sweet stuff from the other stuff. Scorpius beamed. This was the best! He wondered if he should try the red jam or the purple one.
Draco had been having a bizarre few weeks. After suddenly being thrust into the public light once again after years of hiding, he had been expecting picketing at the gates, angry graffiti on the walls, mobs even. That was how it had been after the war. He had been expecting his life to be mayhem. However, none of that transpired in the aftermath of the Witch Weekly article. Work was much the same except that none of his coworkers or clients met his eye. Everyone quit talking as soon as he walked into the room. And, once ignored on the streets, he now received many double-takes and puzzled stares. But there was no vulgar confrontation with strangers or badgering from reporters.
"No, thanks. I'm on a raw diet," Harry said as he reached for the bag of marshmallows. "Unroasted marshmallows and unmelted chocolate only."
Scorpius could hardly sit still. There seemed to be an almost endless smorgasbord in front of him. He shifted in the seat so he could sit on his knees, which gave him a much higher vantage point. He wanted to get a good look. Harry was already helping himself to the shredded lettuce and turkey slices. There was also butter and strawberry jam and orange marmalade and tomatoes and this strange jar of black things and half a loaf of bread.
"Of course." Harry winked at Arthur as he was handed a sweet tart. He was quickly accumulating many small plates of sweets around him. He picked the raisins off the tart carefully. "He's alright."
Scorpius tugged at his pouting lip, utterly guilt-ridden and contrite. There must be a way to fix this.
Draco and Theo Nott were sitting at a table in a small café by Theo's office, as they always did once every few months, catching up on things. Theo spent much of his life traveling for work and pleasure, so whenever he was back in town, he made a point to reach out to Draco. Theo was one of the few people from Hogwarts that Draco could stand. Theo was also one of a handful of people from Hogwarts who would give Draco the time of day. He had helped Draco when it came to rehabilitation in the adult world, after all the court dates and probation he had to deal with. Draco owed a lot to his friend. And his friend knew it.
"GAH!" he screamed when he ran headfirst into Ginny, who seemed to have materialized out of thin air into his living room. "What the hell are you doing here?!"
"No one knows." Patricia shook her head. "People say she left him heartbroken. People say he doesn't believe in true love anymore. He loved her so, so much. And he was so, so sad."
Scorpius stayed just outside the kitchen. He was quite close to tears. Draco noticed and his laughter subsided. He ruffled Scorpius' hair to let him know that everything was alright before venturing into the mess. "Let me see."
Harry tsked when he understood. Malfoy wasn't safe at home. "Do you have somewhere else you can go?"
Draco shuffled out of the room, followed closely by Harry, who was still getting used to seeing Draco like this. Today Draco looked lived in, wearing a rumpled cotton shirt and pajamas. He wasn't as foreboding or put together when not in a suit. Even Draco Malfoy was capable of looking like a mess at times. It was a comforting thought for Harry. "He seems to be doing fine. How many bowls of ice-cream did you feed him?"
"I know that," Draco murmured. He could feel Scorpius pressed against his leg, squeezing his hand, obviously wanting him to say no. "Would you like to visit, Scorpius?" he asked.
Draco clenched his jaw and let go of Harry, then smoothed his sweater down, turned away, and began walking to the door.
Teddy kicked Draco's shin, earning a sharp bark from Harry. As he seethed, his hair flickered orange and then fire red. "I hate you," he spat out before running up the stairs. His footsteps echoed down the creaky corridor. The door to his room banged shut.
"Yes!" a chorus answered. Scorpius couldn't even open his mouth, that's how dry his tongue had gotten.
They stopped at a brightly lit stall and bought two cups of piping hot apple cider. Scorpius even got a sip of the spicy drink. They spent a long while wandering the quaint neighborhood. Small fires crackled in makeshift firepits on the pavement. Performers created art out of a bit of ice and magic. Happy holiday music played from the street corners. It was a truly enchanting season.
Draco glanced into the classroom to find Astoria and Scorpius standing in front of the window. "Want to meet Stori?"
The next day, Draco left for work at eight, which meant Scorpius and Harry could be up to any number of mischievous deeds all day long.
asked him to help out with projects. In fact, he always turned to his nanny for that. "Can't Patricia take you?"
Draco hadn't thought about it and he really wasn't in the mood for her games. Astoria went back to rearranging the presents. Draco wondered what brought this on. "Is this about Harry?" he finally said.
"I like that. I'm really happy too. See?" Scorpius beamed at Draco. "I'm happy about many things." The Malfoys were in Scorpius' playroom, working on crafts for school. Scorpius picked up his colour pencil and continued his drawing. "I'm happy about my friends. I'm happy that I can fly again now that it's spring. I'm happy because I get to go on another vacation with Mum. And I'm happy when we play together. I don't think I have anything to be sad about at all."
“What is it?” He questioned quietly, watching as the sun refracted unnaturally through the stone. Her smile widened, as she handed the chain back to him.
Tom forced himself to nod, his eyes still trained on the booklet as he read the small text furiously. It was silent for an uncomfortably long amount of time as he did, in which the man across from him finished off his biscuit before moving on to the lukewarm tea they had both forgotten about.
What was so different? He couldn’t quite sort it out. He knew something was different though, something incredibly important. So, he sat there, not quite sure what exactly was wrong, but knowing that something was happening.
Well, Harry wasn’t a moron in the intellectual sense, but he was just stupid enough in everything else to not question a mysterious, red door if he came upon it.
Harry spoke to empty air, staring blankly at the large expanse of wall across from him. The basement was confined. At least, that was the best way he could describe it. It weaved in the way that an anthill did, and likely felt just as compressed, with winding halls that were both too short and too narrow for him to comfortably maneuver through. He honestly didn’t know why it was called a basement and not a dungeon or, hell, maybe just a tunnel system, but assumed there were reasons that Nicolas and Perenelle had settled on ages prior. It could be for tax purposes, for all he knew. Regardless of the reason behind the name, he didn’t enjoy spending time down in weaving, tomb-like halls. And, honestly, if it weren’t for his current, particularly pressing issue, he would surely be up in the study with Draco, pouring over legal documents and law books as he had been before the damned Quidditch World Cup threw a Barty Crouch shaped wrench into all his plans.
him. Not once, but twice. The first time he could excuse as a heat of the moment action, but the second had been premeditated in the very least. Did his grandfather truly hate the Lovegoods so much that he would lash out in that kind of way? Or was it due to something completely different?
The older woman waved them both off with a laugh, gently tugging the stone out of Harry’s grip as she did. He gave it up wearily, his eyes following her every movement as if she was seconds away from smashing the thing under her shoe.
Draco lifted his arm, waved slightly as his soulmate’s eyes landed on him. He felt some of the weight lift off him as Harry grinned back, before quickly disappearing back into the shadowed interior of the house, the window shutting behind him once again. Draco watched the empty window for a moment, before letting his arm fall back to his side, his smile falling in tandem as the dull ache returned.
Patricia shook her head in defeat. These days Scorpius was absolutely ravenous for her food. He was hitting a growth spurt, that must be the reason, she thought, as she flicked her wand at the sink to fill it with sudsy water. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw through the kitchen window Draco pulling Harry near.
Harry flipped the letter to reveal Scorpius' drawing of the three of them on broomsticks, flying in the clouds with the manor beneath them.
"Did you see me?" Scorpius asked excitedly. "What did you think, Harry?" He dismounted from his Firebolt, but kept bouncing on the balls of his feet. He couldn't believe he had accomplished such a maneuver.
Turns out the Malfoys had a case of strep throat. The doctor prescribed some potions for the pain and to kill the bacteria. Scorpius had the worst of it. He could hardly speak or swallow because of his sore throat. Draco had gotten away with a fever and cough. The potions made them entirely too sleepy, so they slept most of the day away once they got home. Scorpius thought it was great. He had never felt this gross before. He had also rarely been coddled like this. He could tell that his father was feeling bad for him. He felt bad for his father too. So he lay very still as Draco wrapped him up close in his sleep.
Scorpius responded with a sad sniff. He had his eyes closed and he was clutching a stuffed golden-brown bear fiercely.
Scorpius perked up when he heard the passing whisper. He was eating his snack in the mess hall with his friends and whoever had spoken was sitting at the table behind him. He was used to listening in on other people's conversations. It's how he gathered most of the gossip in the school. He knew all about how pretty nine-year-old Lacey twisted Pip's nose because he was bullying her, and then kissed his cheek by the back of the school, much to her admirer's elation. He knew Margaret's friends were planning a sleepover with popcorn and sweets. He knew what sort of pranks were going to be played on Mr. McGillis, the meanest teacher in the whole wide world.
wants it to be. So what if we're separated? It's not like it's the first time a marriage hasn't worked out! He's acting like it's something to be ashamed of, that I should be
He spent the rest of lunch worrying about this and that. He couldn't even remember what he had eaten or any of the conversation topics going on around him. The more time he spent with Potter and Teddy, the more anxious he was becoming. He kept telling himself that he was concerned for his son, but he was also concerned for himself. This was not something he had planned for. He had planned for everything else but not this.
Back in the great room, Scorpius had snuck in without making a sound. Draco caught him looking intently at The Quibbler that Theo had conveniently left behind on the coffee table. Draco walked over and picked up the magazine off the table, startling Scorpius. The boy nearly jumped out of his skin and attempted to wipe the guilty look off his face. "Bed." Draco motioned for Scorpius to scurry along.
The next morning, when they awoke to rowdy boys running around the manor, and Harry began fumbling out of bed, Draco pulled him back in. His chest was pressed to Harry's back, arms wrapped around his waist, and chin resting on Harry's shoulder. His eyes remained shut against the bright sunlight. It was hot under the sheets. He moved his legs to tangle them against Harry's. He was hopeless. He screwed his face at the thought. He was hopeless around Potter. He had always been hopeless around Potter. He listened to Harry's breaths even out, long and deep.
Harry rubbed his hand on his pants to get rid of the warm tickle that slowly subsided as Draco's magic dissipated. "I'm fine," he told the boys who were standing on the landing. Scorpius peeked from over Teddy's shoulder to look at his teacher. Harry held out his hand to show him. "See? It doesn't even hurt anymore. Not even a scratch."
Harry had to smile. He shut his eyes and took a deep breath. "Only a little." This was turning out to be a rather complicated day. "Knowing that you care makes me feel loads better."
One afternoon, in cold January, Harry was on his way in from recess when he was called to the front office for a message. After ensuring all the children were accounted for, he made his way down there and got a note from the secretary. He frowned at it for a good minute, ignoring the quizzical looks he was getting from everyone in the hallway, before stuffing the parchment into his pocket and returning to class.
"NEVER!" Teddy shouted. His arm shot out through the snow pile he was buried in and he grabbed Scorpius by the ankle. Scorpius yelped as his leg was pulled out from under him. He landed with a thump onto the soft ground, hardly getting a moment to grunt before he was being buried in the snow by Teddy's furious digging.
Harry really wasn't expecting Ron to elbow him hard in the arm, jostling his sore shoulder wildly. "Ah!" he exclaimed. "What the hell?!" He gawked at Ron in astonishment.
"No, that's what you have to look at." Scorpius knelt down and carefully began doing up his laces, crossing them over, pulling one end under the other, making loops and twisting them together into a pretty bow. "I did it." He beamed up at Draco, waiting to be praised.
The park was soon overrun with shrieking children kicking a ball around. Parents milled around the picnic table, grazing on snacks while making idle conversation. Harry had his hands full, refereeing the match, making sure the kids weren't running headfirst into trees. Teddy had invited some of the Weasleys to the park as well, which made the party that much more raucous. Over the course of two hours, they had played a rousing game of kickball, hide-and-seek, and Grandmother's Footsteps. Then came time for cake and presents.
"Harry's not your teacher, and he's coming over tomorrow to teach you to fly?" Theo once again threw a pointed look at Draco, who did not deign to react.
"I would rather have him learn at home. Private tutors and all. But Astoria has less sentimentality than me, I suppose, so it was easy for her to see the big picture."
"What imposition?" Theo glanced back at Draco, and Draco quickly smoothed his face into an indifferent expression. "There will be plenty for the four of us, don't you think, Draco?"
Scorpius shook his head. He didn't bother to look up from his picture book he had chosen for reading hour.
The Burrow was absolutely packed like a winter market in Central London. There were Weasleys and Weasley-adjacent in every nook and cranny of the home. Plates of pastries and sweets appeared on a whim for the guests, cups of hot apple cider going along with the never-ending snack. Children shrieked with excitement as they unearthed toys from gift bags and wrapping paper. Most of the Weasleys were sporting sweaters from Molly. Conversation was loud and laughter even more jovial. A typical Christmas morning.
Harry unscrewed the lid off of one of the jars in front of Scorpius. "There you go. Try this first." He dug a butter knife into the creamy brown spread that smelled much too incredible.
Scorpius whined, "Oh, come on, Dad. Look at what we've been working on!" He was talking about the ripped clothes that lay on the floor of his playroom.
"It's hot enough to fry an egg out here," Draco complained, "you've put me in clothes that I would rather be caught dead in, and this is a weekend I wanted to spend in my home, preferably not nursing a sunburn. But you, Potter, seem hellbent on an excursion."
"Have I?" He picked his head up and marveled at her inquisitive brown eyes, faintly freckled cheeks, tumbling red waves of hair, and he wished he could want her.
"He's better now," Scorpius added when he saw the aghast expression on his father's face. He clutched Harry's hand. "Don't worry. The Healers made him all better."
Harry didn't press Draco. He stood up, gesturing for Draco to lead the way. Some whispers followed them along the unmarked, winding corridors. Harry hung back on purpose, his eyes trained on the back of Draco's head. Draco refused to show his lethargy in front of those Ministry officials. He'd be damned if he let them break him. Once they had turned towards the elevators, the stares started to lessen, which made Draco relax more. After they were on the elevator and on the way out of the Ministry, no one looked twice.
"Well, I've heard rumors about Harry Potter, you see?" She gesticulated mysteriously. "He used to be
Draco eyed the chilly grounds covered in a fresh foot of snow. "That was the idea," he said deliberately. "I want to speak to you. But I'd rather speak inside."
Draco growled in frustration as he pushed his fingers through his hair. At the moment, it seemed to be Harry's mission to humiliate him. That mission was going a little too well. Theo's taunt rang in his head - you can never be friends. Truer words hadn't been spoken, but surely this wasn't what Theo had in mind. This wasn't what anyone had in mind.
The not-Moody’s soul was orange—it was quite a pleasant shade actually, reminding her of the fruit with the same name—and whipped about in excited coils of light. It was wonderfully boyish, really, and had an air of ache to it that felt almost infantile. Luna rather thought it was the soul of a previously withdrawn person, with the way it whipped around the room as if it had never been able to before. Yes, that was it; the soul seemed to have been contained tight to the body for a very long time, and had just recently been freed to do as it pleased.
Harry felt terribly foolish, or perhaps just terribly immature, for thinking that he could get anything past someone who had spent centuries studying human expression. It was no wonder she could read him so well; was she not the one who had spent her centuries of life traveling the globe, meeting people and gaining an understanding of them? He had just barely stepped out of the little sphere of influence that Britain was, while she had a firm grasp on the entire world and where it rested in relation to her.
The time that he did get to spend time with Draco, however, was typically spent in the adjacent potions laboratory, where both of them would talk about anything they wanted as Perenelle pretended they were being productive. And they were... on occasion. Harry had none of the materials necessary to recreate his golden potion in the lab, sure, but he got quite a few good ideas from a supportive Perenelle on what he should try once he got back to Hogwarts, and had been writing out ideas for more extensive experiments. Her general consensus on the potion, based entirely on his description of it, seemed to be quite similar to his own, that being that the potion was some sort of psychological attacker that induces psychosis, though it was really quite hard to tell the exact effects without using it on a human. Perenelle cautioned him against the thought severely, positing that a potion like that should only be used when necessary, and never for the pursuit of knowledge. He agreed with her from a moral standpoint, but the thought stuck with him. Was there someone in his general vicinity that he would enjoy watching go mad? Certainly, but could he handle the fallout? That second question seemed to effectively hold him back from contemplating the first any further.
“Harry, why are you always either inconsolably angry or pretending you aren’t? You haven’t had even the faintest grip on your emotions ever since you ate that girl. I’m concerned you’re letting the wendigo control you.”
correct.” The man took a small bite out of his biscuit, chewing slowly in thought for a moment as he seemed to consider how best to explain himself. “But I am afraid that the truth is far more dire and complicated than a simple difference in opinion.”
They both nearly let go of the chain then, as a sudden burst of green light ripped its way across the sky. Draco made a pained noise in the back of his throat as Harry watched the dark mark rise high in the sky, the familiar skull laughing with seething hatred as a long, thick snake weaved out from inside its mouth like a tongue.
“If you don’t shut your mouth, I’ll have no choice but to cut out your tongue.” He snapped, stalking forward as the Locket roared with laughter, yanking at its restraints furiously as he threw an arm out and slapped it
There was the light again, twisting through the air around his soul as if waiting for something. It was… cold, and smelt like smoke and brimstone. The light felt completely unlike his own magic, which had always been searingly hot and viciously burning, a strike of fire in an utterly wasteful world. Many akin to spices and bitterness, the heat vicious as it cut across you like a dull knife. This coldness, this nothingness that it vacated… he couldn’t help but be curious as to what it might be. It was clearly an intruder, but had no obvious intentions that he could discern.
They made smalltalk for a time as they discussed the curriculum of Beauxbatons and Hogwarts respectively, with Gabrielle occasionally butting in to ask him a random question about his life. Sirius hadn’t come back with his clothes at all during that brief period, so Harry let the knowledge that the man was probably fine fall to the back of his mind as Fleur lamented about the beautiful school that she went to, and of how she was quite excited for her final year there. He had realized quickly enough that she likely didn’t know about the triwizard tournament, and that it seemed the other schools had made it as much of a secret as Hogwarts had.
“That had been my belief as well. Now though… ah, I suppose you must be finding your seats. It was wonderful talking to you, Harry.” Replied Krum, who gave Harry one last handshake before falling away into the crowd again, gone for the time being. Draco rolled his eyes at the man’s retreating back, before pulling Harry along towards a different path, causing the taller, clumsier boy to stumble slightly as his long legs got locked around each other.
“I… uhm… ‘ello.” He muttered, gaping like a fish as the old lady grabbed him around the wrist and pulled him forcefully through the door, her unnaturally purple eyes lighting up with glee as the red door swung shut behind them.
She giggled, head in both hands as she stared, cross-eyed, at the vague brown hues of the Ravenclaw table below her. She hadn’t been feeling well at all that day, the discomfort starting very early that morning, though she hadn’t been able to discern for what reason she was feeling ill. She eventually settled on the vague thought that someone wanted her to pay attention to things, and had done her best to do so from that second onwards. Theo had noticed her odd actions that morning, if the half-frozen appearance of his soul had been any indication, though he hadn’t said anything about it and seemed to have been hoping she herself would bring it up. She hadn’t though, not feeling particularly inclined to do so, and they had gone along to the school with nary a thought and had quickly separated upon entrance to the great hall.
Whirling around, his eyes wide, Harry stopped short as his gaze landed on Perenelle standing there behind him, her arms overflowing with folded towels and an amused look on her face.
Taking a deep breath, Tom slowly peeled his hands away from his ears, the ringing slowly becoming less prevalent as time passed. Cracking open an eye, he blinked through the pain before forcing the other one open. There was rubble strewn around him, as if a wall had been blown inwards from the outside. He frowned, looking down at the floor as he pulled his hands fully away from his ears. There was only the dull ringing that he could make out, the only discernible noise coming from his own mind. Raising his hands up into the air in front of his face, Tom couldn’t help but frown deeply in concern at the splotches of blood on his hands. Reaching up with a finger, he whipped it gently against the tender flesh of his ear, pulling it away to see glistening red there as well.
They came to the clearing they had first appeared in, and Perenelle quickly turned to the both of them, unclasping her bracelet in one smooth motion. Draco made a confused noise as she held one end out to them, her amused face barely visible in the low light.
Shrugging to himself, he slowly followed the man, blinking far more than usual as his eyes began to water as the peppery magic in the air became more pronounced. The walk felt agonizing as he stepped in tandem with the visibly suffering man next to him, the stinging in his eyes seeming like child's play next to the physical assault Tom seemed to be experiencing. Eventually though, he found himself standing in front of an iron door that appeared about on the brink of collapse, his eyes watering to the point where he wasn’t sure whether or not he could even properly gauge if the door was fortified or not.
There was nothing for him to do but write to Griphook about the Black lordship and hope for the best.
“She would be incredibly bored.” The diadem horcrux finished the thought for him, the man’s smile very nearly breaking his face in two. “Very good Tom, very good. I must admit that I have only heard of Fate through you, but your argument is extremely compelling, and very likely. If she was half the monster you make her out to be, the destruction of our universe would come to her as a great annoyance, not a delight.”
“Oh come now, Draconis. The poor man is still injured. The basement is secure, he won’t get out.” The woman supplied, her voice appearing suddenly to his left as she delicately grasped his arm. “And Hadrian, please, stop dragging him along like that. He isn’t a dog.”
“I… okay.” He muttered, not sure what to do besides agree as his lord moved further ahead, leading the charge up the narrow path they were walking. Instead, he focused on walking as the noises of night and wildlife rose up around him, reveling in the unfamiliar feeling of autonomy as he walked of his own accord for what felt like the first time. It was a truly wondrous feeling, one he knew he needed to get used to if he had any desire to be of use to his lord once again.
“I love you too.” Harry replied, just as quiet and just as sincere. Draco glanced up at his soulmate’s face, following the path of his scar down from his hairline to the tip of his nose. It felt so strange, and surreal, sitting there and holding onto each other’s hands. It had been so long since they had even seen each other’s faces, touching felt like a novelty.
He sighed, rubbing his eyes as he looked back up to Harry’s window, blinking with surprise as his soulmate appeared in front of it again, swiftly opening it before quickly vacating the space. Draco soon learned why, as the massive form of Hades quickly flew out and into the sky, carrying with him a large bundle of what Draco had to assume was all the paperwork tied with thick twine around the owl’s talon. He watched as Harry waved the bird off, before his gaze shifted down to the three of them on the ground.
They stared at each other for a moment, before Harry slowly nodded, somber. Nicolas smiled tightly, before immediately turning back around to his notes as if nothing had been said at all. “You’re free to go. Please come back in an hour to check on the potion with me. You did place it by the window, yes?”
“The cup isn’t even conscious!” Locket screeched, quickly returning to his thrashing as Tom started to test all his keys on the door. “It doesn’t have enough soul to it to even comprehend emotions past sadness, much less things like movement! Tom-please, brother, don’t do this to me, I’ll go mad!”
“Well, I suppose you’ve gone and been adopted now, haven’t you.” He started, unsure how to break the silence. Harry cracked a smile, his bright green eyes finally turning to pin Draco under their gaze. His breath hitched, completely against his own personal wishes, and Draco cursed any god that ever existed for a moment as he was swallowed up by that blasted
“Good enough, I suppose.” He muttered, placing the vial back within its confines without a second glance. “Keep at the pace you’re going and we should have enough to keep stocked till June.”
She had gazed at him familially, or perhaps even grandmotherly, in a way that he had never been addressed, and Harry was unsure just how he felt about it. Warm, of course, and strangely comforted, but terribly confused and just a little bit scared.
“I must find where this Wormtail is so, that he will find and return my wand to me, and then I will call the Death Eaters.”
Harry’s voice, sounding so relaxed and calm, would have been soothing if the bastard wasn’t acting as if Draco wasn’t seconds from throwing up the day’s worth of meals. Coughing wetly, he crouched down, head between his knees and a curse readied on his lips as his head throbbed and stomach idly threatened to come racing up his esophagus.
Through the pain, through that unimaginable suffering, an inkling of logic shone through, and Voldemort realized that he understood what was happening. Souls couldn’t be healed like bodies could, as they had very little capacity for change after being destroyed past a certain point. When you died, there was no coming back, and when your soul was ripped to shreds, the pain of putting yourself back together came with the cost of death.
Albus whipped around, stumbling over himself in an effort to get to his desk as fast as he could. Fawkes squawked angrily at the sudden disturbance, bursting away in a small explosion of fire as Albus practically
the time to patronize me. You know my reasons all too well, you bloody hypocrite.” He finally bit out, turning on his heel as the words hung heavy in the still air for a moment. He sighed, falling back onto the wall across from the blasted door and slowly sliding down it. Calm. He just needed to stay calm. He needed to get a grip on his emotions before he
He sipped at the drink as she groaned disparangly, falling back with a thump in her chair as she drank straight from the bottle. Nicolas raised an eyebrow, not so concerned that she would get drunk than he was for her liquor supply.
“Harry Potter! Happy birthday!” She shouted, sprinting around her sister and Perenelle to quickly come to his side, jumping with glee as he smiled.
“You see, it was found that, after a great deal of bloodletting, that you simply can't use your own blood to mix with your own magic, as nothing will happen, and the use of another magical person’s blood will combine the two seperate magics and create great complications, so the only possible way to create this mixture is to use the blood of another human who has no magic of their own. During the time of the ancient Greeks this was a nonissue, since the ‘muggles’ as you Brittons call them saw the Greek sorcerers as gods to be ruled by, and would give up their blood gladly. However, it is not that simple of a task these days.”
He held up both hands in assent, stepping away from her bed as he did. She watched his magic churn with curiosity and concern as he cautiously left the room, a feeling dread pooling in her stomach as he did. She had seen the woman a few times of course, distantly, and had been surprised that she could not see the woman’s core at all. Those times had always been from a distance of course, and sometimes the woman had whispered her thing in the dead of night, but Luna had never been
That was the only thought he could keep concretely in his head, and it was one he was desperately clinging to. All he could do was wait for a good time to tell Draco about the letter, nothing more than that. He couldn’t change Lord Malfoy’s mind about the whole thing, and he certainly couldn’t go to an authority figure about it to get the disownment rebuked. It was a family matter after all, and both parents seemed to be in agreement.
Tom stared at the locked door, shut and sealed with a sharp finality as Harry’s nerves were finally expended. The locked door, which forced their minds apart so that nothing from his could bypass into Harry’s and no information from Harry’s could bypass into his own.
“Do not worry yourself too terribly over your openness, Hadrian. I have difficulty not immediately searching for answers when I have a question, and you seem to be endlessly full of unanswered questions.”
Albus’ eyes widened in surprise, before he quickly shook his head. “Not at all! In fact, I actually requested a meeting with her to discuss something of only mild import about one of the students transferring to Beauxbatons from Hogwarts. Tell me, Nicolas, what do you think of the TriWizard Tournament that is to be held this year? You have seen many of the prior tournaments, as I recall. Do you have any thoughts?”
Maybe it was because his argument with Theo still felt fresh in his mind, and the separation from his soulmate was already starting to wear on him, but Harry felt like a bit of a twat for leaving things where he had. Maybe he should have tried to get Draco to come with him to France. Maybe he should have just swallowed his pride and apologize to Theo for scaring him. Hell, Harry didn’t even know what had come over him in that moment in the dorm. He didn’t know why the term ‘little prophet’ was at all important to Theo, it had just felt like the right thing to say at the time.
time, not since he had revived that one fawn when he was a child. Something about the entire process hadn’t exactly felt right to him after that, and he couldn’t help but feel like he would be crossing the point of no return if he started using necromancy again. The magic was sickeningly addictive, and he had no idea how he would react to it now that he was, technically, an undead creature in his own right. No, that was a thought that he had pushed aside for contemplation at a
Xenophilius looked at him blankly, as if he didn’t understand the question. “Well I suppose, if she wishes.”
He blinked open his eyes, gaze trained on the vague expanse of the sitting room ceiling. Harry let out a disgruntled noise of confusion, Draco’s pale face coming into view as he leaned his head forwards, rubbing the sleep from his eyes as the other boy placed a tall glass of water in front of him. Blearily, he took it, sipping at the cool liquid as Draco settled into the seat across from him, elegantly crossing his arms over his chest before leveling a calm-yet-annoyed look in his direction.
Draco’s sudden voice made him jolt up from his slump, blearily blinking the half-asleep daze out of his eyes as he looked back to the shorter boy’s face. Draco’s expression was practically glacial, his hands working diligently to set the letter aside and pick up a paper and quill.
Everything went about how one would expect it to, as the pair, while inebriated past the point of decency, still had quite a few decades of sexual escapades under their belts and knew how to get things done with impressive efficiency. The issue that was discussed prior to this situation arose when a rather flustered owl clawed its way into the study, squawking and tumbling through the air and generally making a rather large mess of itself. Narcissa was the first to notice it, as she had a rather good view of the windows and of the things that might potentially crash through them, and was startled so thoroughly by the bird that she completely forgot about wrestling her husband’s belt off his person. The man groaned at first, feeling rather strained in some very sensitive areas, but quickly came to attention as the noises of distress from the owl finally registered in his mind. Turning slightly, the couple watched as the bird wrestled itself up into a standing position, before flapping its wings a few times and jerkily nearing them. Narcissa let out a noise between annoyance and surprise, before sliding off of her husband’s lap in order to meet the razzled owl halfway and snatch the letter from its beak. The bird seemed immensely grateful towards her for taking away its burden and immediately took off again, soaring out of the window as if it hadn’t just nearly cracked the ancient glass with its efforts.
They sat in silence. The only movement was the shifting of Draco’s cooling wings and Harry’s hands as he ran them up and down his soulmate's spine in slow, steady movements. It was quiet again, save for the crickets as they sang their peaceful tune, and Draco’s unsteady breathing as he slowly expended himself. Harry could feel the cooling emotions, as the anger and hurt settled once again into a bitter, emotionless shock, cool and lifeless as it flowed steadily through his empty veins.
Draco’s disapproving voice jolted him from the thought, and he turned around to look at his soulmate, an eyebrow quirked upwards in confusion. “Did what? You like quidditch and other things like it, so didn’t you enjoy meeting him?”
Draco grumbled, feeling the heat slowly dissipate as his embarrassment receded. “You’re so bloody dense Harry, I do sincerely hope you know that.”
“You poor boy. The lives you have lived have not been kind to you. Perhaps… perhaps I was wrong in stating that our souls are not ours to keep. Hadrian, yours is a soul that has lived through hardships I could only bear to hear of from your own mouth. If you truly believe I would turn you away for being so brave as to confide them in me, then I have not embodied my own character properly. You will always have a place here, Hadrian, of that I am certain.”
Scorpius said, "I got a Firebolt last week and I don't know how to ride it. Teddy says you're the best."
Having these bizarre conversations with Draco was thrilling for Harry. It was a thrill he rarely felt, and he was both unnerved and intrigued enough to keep at it. He took a few steps forward, stopping in front of Draco. "No," he said, "I've never been with a man."
"What makes you think that?" Draco asked as he shuffled books together before putting them away on the shelf, taking care to keep his back turned to Scorpius. "Did he say something?"
He turned back and started to say, "Listen-" Then he glanced away from Draco, over his shoulder, at the grand staircase.
Harry Potter was a grown-up. Scorpius wondered if he would live alone when he was all grown up. Probably not. He wanted to get married to someone really nice and live with her. As long as he had one person with him, he was fine. "You don't even have
"What I want, she doesn't. What she wants, I don't," Draco said. "Especially when it comes to Scorpius. We're both stubborn. Spoilt in our own way." Both he and Astoria came from very affluent wizarding families, and were used to getting their way. When things didn't go their way, they both reacted with anger and resentment. "Similar upbringings, so we know what to say to make it hurt. Yes, she's perfect. She thinks I'm perfect. When we're together for long enough, we became far from perfect."
Harry didn't have any pretense in either his voice or his expression. "We could forget all about it."
Scorpius closed his eyes and went over the argument he had heard in the classroom, even behind closed doors. He didn't understand what was happening. He had
"Whoa." Harry closed the space between them in three strides, resting a hand on Draco's arm to stop him and turn him back around. Draco slapped Harry's hand away. Harry conceded by raising that hand in surrender. "Can you forget it?"
Scorpius felt calmer after hearing those comforting words. He unwound his arms from around Harry, keeping his eyes down and letting Harry wipe his cheeks dry. He felt loads lighter. He really believed that Harry would help him get better and better at singing. Because he knew he could count on Harry. Because he knew how much Harry cared. He gathered up his courage to ask, "Am I your favourite?"
"I've tried many times. But he keeps telling me the same thing all the time." Scorpius shook his head sadly, as though feeling very sorry for his idiot father. "Maybe you should tell him it's not true. He'll believe you." Scorpius felt that sometimes Harry seemed to have more of an influence on Draco.
Harry shrugged sheepishly. "I was going to drop by after, to talk to you, but you got ahead of me, and kept going on and on. I figured I should let you finish."
Harry had much to be preoccupied with. Ginny was right, he didn't often keep secrets these days. And this one was a whopper of a secret.
"Much." Draco pressed his smile to Harry's and they moved as one, falling onto the dusty sofa as their hands began to wander.
Draco sighed awake as he felt his son shift beside him. The first thing he saw when he opened his eyes was a very sly smirk.
Draco was still frowning when he made his way up the grand staircase with an armful of candy. Lately he felt like all he ever did was indulge Scorpius and Harry's exploits. What irked Draco the most was that Scorpius seemed to have more fun with Potter than with his own father - whether it be at school, with their inside jokes, or with Teddy, with their games, or at the manor, with flying lessons. It's not as though Draco didn't make an effort with Scorpius. It just seemed like Potter always made
Scorpius immediately tried to look sullen, which was comical to see because his big smile dropped in an instant and his shoulders sagged theatrically.
Draco sat beside his son while watching Astoria and Harry walk away to a secluded corner of the crowded dressing room, talking amongst themselves. "What are they saying?" Scorpius wanted to know. "They're probably talking about me, huh? Do you think so?"
Teddy gasped. "How dare you?" He wiped his thumb on his pants and pointed an accusatory finger at Harry. "
Molly and Arthur sat beside each other, their lips pursed into a thin line, and they let their children argue with Harry. Percy, Bill and Ron were the most vocal. Hermione tried to mediate the 'conversation', but that generally meant yelling over belligerent comments. "You have reporters hounding you day and night," Percy exclaimed. "How else are you going to stop them? Classic formula is to issue a public apology. They get what they want and this fiasco is brushed under the rug. I can arrange-"
Draco slumped into the sofa and hid his face behind his hands. "Potter's right. I'm a bad parent," he realized.
Hermione handed her husband a plate of fresh apple pie, exchanged a meaningful look with him, then gave the second plate to their best friend who hadn't said more than a handful of words all dinner long. They were gathered in the living room with their desserts, the children already in bed. The three of them made sure to meet at least twice a month, a time to catch up and reminisce.
"What if I am?" Harry snapped back. He knew that to be true, but had never seen that as a fault. Right now, however, he really wished he had a newer model. He swept his gaze over the horizon, squinting at the setting sun that coloured the skies with vivid red. Whose big idea was this anyway? He looked down at the small speck below them, and he could make out Scorpius waving wildly at them from the ground. Their friendly Seeker match had turned quite a bit more competitive. Draco had hardly broken a sweat.
"He's nicer than you, so I might start liking him more." Scorpius grinned smugly at his father and planted his fists on his hips. "You'll be sorry. What will you do then?"
Teddy whipped his head to the side, his eyes crackling icy blue. He couldn't make out the owner of the voice but everyone in the vicinity of the culprit shifted anxiously, not liking the look on his face. "What does it matter what he's like?"
Harry gathered Draco in his arms as they staggered into the middle of the foyer, leaving a trail of melting snow, wet shoes, and mittens in their wake. Harry broke away for just a moment to breathlessly ask, "Are the boys asleep?"
She heard pitter-pattering footsteps skipping to the bathroom and she turned away from the kitchen window with another defeated shake of the head. Honestly, where would the Malfoys be without her?
As far as anyone was concerned, yes, Harry was a rather good friend. That's all this was. With Scorpius gone for three days, at least Draco didn't have to come up with more excuses for being away from the manor. A small reprieve. It was getting difficult to keep track of the lies. Not just the lies they told others, but the ones they told each other.
Then he realized that pushing his luck had yielded rather favourable results. Maybe he should keep pushing his luck.
Scorpius was sure this was not allowed the moment he bit into the most decadent dessert he had ever had. He turned to his father with an expression of amazement. "Dad!" He held half the s'more out to Draco. "Try this!"
At half-past eight, when Scorpius returned with his haul to the manor, Harry in tow, and the front door opened again, Draco seemed composed and much less displeased than when they had left him. Scorpius was glad. He couldn't wait to show Draco all the candy he had gotten. "Dad! Dad! Dad!" His makeup had rubbed off around his nose and mouth, green mixing with red to make a muddy brown. The severed foot was now in Harry's hands because Scorpius needed all his strength to drag his enormous pillowcase around. He displayed the loot inside. "Look at this! Can you believe it?!" He could hardly believe it himself. "Rose was a princess and Hugo was a bee and Louis was a pirate and I was the scariest of them all!" With some effort he dropped the pillowcase at Draco's feet. "I won't eat them all. I'll share with you and Nanna and my friends." He couldn't wait for school tomorrow, so he could trade his candy away. "Next year, I want to be a dragon." He scratched his itchy nose, then his itchy cheek, then his itchy neck.
"Astoria said Scorpius said he had a great time having a snowball fight with you and Harry Potter on Christmas."
... And the next thing Harry knew, he was opening his sleepy eyes, buried under the weight of a heavy blanket.
Scorpius and Teddy shot up to their feet, then stumbled about a few times as dizziness took their feet this way and that. "Cookies are done!"
Harry turned around to look down at the Malfoys, shielding his eyes from the sun with one hand and raising the other in a short wave. Scorpius waved back happily.
"Some people are like that," Draco explained. "Some people are nice and they smile at everyone. I know it makes you feel special. But he is just your teacher. Teachers have to be nice to their students. That's all."
Harry was in the middle of a dusty endeavor up in the attic at 12 Grimmauld Place when the doorbell chimed. Andromeda had tasked him with finding some old albums and books her grandmother had stowed away for safekeeping. Harry was tempted to ignore the door since he was elbows deep in some boxes, but the ringing didn't stop. He was still brushing cobwebs off his hair when he finally got downstairs. He was not expecting to find Draco standing at the stoop when he opened the door.
The children turned as one to look up at Scorpius in wonder. Scorpius stood his ground with his hands at his hips and his lips pursed into a determined line. Harry was taken aback by the initiative the child had taken in asking the question despite not being included in the conversation.
"I didn't mean it that way, Scorpius. It's just that you have never invited me to the park before, that's all. If you want, I could spare an hour right now. Shall we go?"
Astoria laughed. "Better you than me. I have a busy weekend planned with Scorpius." She was taking her son to Cornwall to explore from castles. She usually spent a few days with her son on his birthday. "Give Draco a break." Just then she saw Scorpius zooming up to the three of them in a dead sprint. "Here comes the troublemaker."
In the upstairs playroom, Teddy stretched his arms out for a few seconds before sitting up with a groan. He had to hunch over a bit to keep their makeshift tent intact. Otherwise his head would lift the whole thing off. He rubbed his eyes and yawned. "Did you sleep okay, Scorp?"
Molly made sure the bandages were done up properly because if there was anything she had learnt from keeping so many raucous children alive for this long, it was how to fix up broken bones. "How is the other party of the fall doing?" She made Harry tilt his head up so she could examine that cut on his cheek.
Scorpius gasped and clapped a hand to his mouth. "Oops." So much for that promise. "I wasn't supposed to tell you."
Scorpius made Teddy sit down and told him all about the past three months. How miserable he had been for being so awful to Harry and Draco. How Draco had tried to hide that he was affected at all, but Scorpius could tell he felt sad too. How quiet it had been in the manor. That maybe they had blown this all way out of proportion. He told Teddy about the ways they had tried to tell Harry that they were sorry about everything. How he had wanted Harry to speak with Draco again. "It's like they're not even friends anymore," Scorpius sniffed back his tears.
"Shut up." Teddy threw the parchment down in disgust. "I've already wasted five sickles on this stupid thing. I don't want you making me feel any worse."
Harry noticed Scorpius' good mood just as the boy walked into class. "My, don't you look excited," he commented.
Teddy wasn't far behind. He shoved Draco aside and skidded on the sauce in his hurry. "Are you okay?"
Draco hazarded a glance at Harry. He didn't seem any different. He was laughing with the children, like nothing was the matter. Like Draco was the only one who had had a tough time sleeping the night before. Damn him. "Breakfast?" Draco asked begrudgingly.
Sunlight filtered through a crack in the thick maroon curtain, striking him. He tried to blink against it, but it was difficult. He brought a hand up to his swollen eye, then to his painfully dry lips.
Scorpius' smile quickly turned into a scowl. "Well, if you don't want it, I'll take it." He snatched the note out of Draco's hand.
Harry sat beside him one afternoon as they got ready for nap-time. "Why don't you join that kickball game this afternoon, Scorpius? I heard they need more players."
Draco searched Harry's expression to try to discern what he was actually trying to say. Before Draco to read into it, Scorpius asked, "Can my father come too? He can play with us, right? He's really good."
Draco bristled. "I missed the part where any of this is your concern. I don't interrogate you about your relationships."
Snow fell on the first week on November, ringing in winter. Scorpius was sorely disappointed by the turn of events. He complained to Harry at school that he shouldn’t have to stop flying just because it snowed a bit. Besides, when he goes to Hogwarts, sometimes he would have to fly in the snow, which means he needed to start practicing now. Harry assured him that he still had five years to practice. Scorpius wasn’t satisfied with the response, but he was in no real position to argue either. As it is, he had pushed his luck with the whole flying lesson business.
Harry brushed the splinter off of his shirt. He realized maybe he had to switch tactics. He asked, "Does Astoria tell Scorpius when she's seeing someone new?"
Scorpius nodded and held still when Hugo rested his hand against Scorpius' ear. But he wasn't expecting the baby to grab a handful of his hair and pull hard. His head jerked down and he hissed in pain. Before Hermione could do more than gasp in dismay, Scorpius had his fingers wrapped around Hugo's wrist. "That hurts," he chided as he managed to get his hair away from Hugo's itching fingers. "You have to be gentle with me too, baby," he said. "You can't pull my hair, okay?"
"I know." Scorpius folded the important letter back up and put it in his pocket, like he had seen his father do many times. "And Teddy said I need to write to him more."
Scorpius opened his eyes to reveal tears welled up in them. He looked down at the bear as though just noticing that he was all but strangling the poor doll. He relaxed his grip as best he could while still hugging it close.
Now he was doing something for himself, and surrounding it with many lies, pretending the lies were meant to protect Scorpius, when in actuality it was to protect himself.
Harry slapped a hand to his face, forcing himself to keep his words even. "The nurse has suggested that he spend the day resting his leg, so it would be best for him to do that at home," he said with marked irritation and deliberation. "Which is why I'm asking you to come take a look and decide on what to do, as per school protocol. He can stand on his foot but I think it hurts him too much to walk. He is a little distressed. The best thing-"
"Now, now, Draco," Astoria tsked. "If you go around acting all sweet like that, hell might freeze over."
Harry could easily retort with 'why not'. Those words could slip out at the moment, when plainly confronted. But the more time he spent thinking about it, the more resolutely those words echoed in his mind. Why not? Why not fancy someone other than Ginny? Why not get his rocks off with someone else if he felt like it? She obviously didn't care who he was doing what with. It could be anyone at all. Anyone.
Harry kept his hand on the Firebolt to reassure Scorpius that he would be fine. "How about a quick flight around those trees?" he asked, pointing at the large poplars ahead of them.
Draco nearly swore again when he glanced at the clock in the hall. Patricia would be here in less than five minutes and Scorpius hadn't even washed up yet. "Go to the bathroom. Brush your teeth. You can choose your clothes for today. Make sure you've packed your books," he quickly rattled off while ushering his son through the corridor.
He steeled himself with a hand at the doorknob. Damn Astoria and her sly remarks. He opened the door.
"I bet he's really happy now, it's been years since all that. You don't have to get married to be happy, you know? That's old-fashioned thinking." Now Patricia seemed to be comforting herself with her words.
"I'm taking him home," Draco said. Scorpius had his arms around his father's neck and his face was hidden. "I need his knapsack and things."
Draco all but stomped a foot on the ground in frustration before storming away, leaving the two lunatics in their madhouse for the next hour while he angrily glared at some paperwork in the library downstairs. That's where Harry found him and decided to confront him.
"This is in relation to an incident that occurred in Cardiff Saturday night. Standard procedure, Mr. Malfoy."
Harry was mouthing the words along with the class. When he saw Scorpius staring at him in absolute misery, he smiled wide and indicated for the boy to stand up taller. Scorpius squared his shoulders and blinked hard a few times to clear his eyes. Then Harry motioned for him to breathe deeply. Scorpius imitated him. He felt his breath shaking in and out of him, but it steadied his hands. When Harry started mouthing the words again, Scorpius got his squeaky voice to cooperate. Although hoarse and barely noticeable, he started singing sadly. He was doing such a poor job. He wanted to cry.
Molly smiled at the young Malfoy. To her, Harry was like a son. And when she had a bad feeling about things, she was usually right. She always had a bad feeling when it came to the Malfoys. However, she swallowed her lecture. She had already been on Harry's case since that dreadful tabloid piece. There wasn't anything left to say. "Will you be going home?"
Draco dragged a hand through his hair. Deep down, he was glad that Harry wasn't having a fit like he was. One of them needed to be levelheaded at that moment. Ignoring Scorpius' question, he asked Harry, "What do we do?"
Harry, desperate to fill the silence, kept speaking. "I wanted to apologize for last week. It was inappropriate. It was unprofessional. I let my personal feelings get to me. Scorpius is a wonderful student, always respectful and very studious. He's shy, but there's nothing wrong with that. I didn't mean to- That is, I'm sorry I-"
"Oh, I'm just saying." Harry swirled the amber liquid in his mug very attentively. "In case you had forgotten." He then gestured at another mug filled with steaming tea sitting on the counter. "For you."
"You felt bad." Scorpius realized this as he looked down at the five leaves his father had brought for him. "I didn't want you to feel bad."
"Has he?" She let out a musical giggle. "He is very unlike the people you surround yourself with nowadays."
"Your favorite student, apparently," she smirked. "Scorpius Malfoy, it says." She showed the letter to Harry through the fire. "Interesting kid. He wrote it to Teddy. Teddy sent it to me."
get dressed. Trust me." He tried to wrangle away from Harry, but Harry held firm. Draco let out a heavy sigh, piqued a brow, and asked, "Again?"
For the first time, Harry saw a genuine expression on Scorpius and he couldn't help but laugh this time.
Draco clenched his fists. He didn't want to lose his nerve, not now. It wasn't often that he let his guard drop like this. "If something were to happen, and I know this will sound preposterous... Scorpius is all I have. That is-" His words broke but his gaze never wavered from Harry. This was an important moment. He knew what the answer would be. All he had to do was ask the right question. Let go of his pride for a moment to ask Harry Potter the right question. But he couldn't bring himself to say the words out loud.
"You know those times when you did something so awful that you just want to curl up and disappear? Well, I'm having one of those moments."
"Seems that way." She tossed the cucumber slices onto the plate before reaching for the salt. "Just a simple misunderstanding."
Harry saved face by saying, "We'll see if he's free that weekend, okay? It's a long way away, in any case."
Patricia paused for a moment from her bed-making to glance at her charge who was blinking at her in all seriousness. She turned back to the bed to conceal her smile. "You know what? I don't think he is, Scorpius," she answered. "Why do you ask?"
"Eat your veggies, Harry," George piped in. He nodded once at Scorpius, who smiled back, and then he followed his brother out the door. That left Arthur and Molly. Patricia wandered out of the room again to evade more awkward conversation.
Harry's grin faltered when he recognized Astoria and Draco standing behind Scorpius. It had been a couple of weeks since the incident with the collarbone. Harry could tell by the way Draco was staring at him that he was waiting for the right time to say something. Harry averted his gaze and turned his attention to Scorpius instead. "How was your play, Prancer?"
Scorpius had been swinging for a few minutes before his father and his teacher walked out the front doors of the school. He nearly fell face-first onto the slushy gravel in his hurry to get off the swing. He caught himself in time though, and ran up to them. "Shall we?" Draco asked him. Scorpius nodded. He had a lot to ask his father. Draco glanced up at Harry again to say goodbye. Scorpius mimicked him and then the Malfoys were on their way home.
"You don't like him either. I heard you. If you don't like him and I don't like him, then he shouldn't come to my house," Scorpius declared.
Astoria marched into the dining room, loudly proclaiming, "He won't give me the ginger snaps." That was followed by a chorus of protests. Draco slumped his shoulders in defeat. Always the villain. There was no winning in this house.
When Harry arrived at the grounds of the Malfoy estate that evening, he saw Scorpius and Draco flying high ahead. He walked over to the clearing by the trees as he watched Scorpius go through a few false starts before gathering up the courage to swoop forward and up, and then jerk his broom even further back to complete a tight backward roll. From the loud exclamation that followed, it seemed Scorpius had surprised himself with that move. As he celebrated by flying wildly around his father, he caught a glimpse of Harry watching down below.
It was a little before six when Draco awoke. He reached over instinctively and he felt an empty bed. He rolled over. Harry wasn't there. He sat up and looked around. The sun was barely peeking at the sky, so the room was filled with soft shadows. There was no sign of Harry. Draco fell back into bed with a quiet groan. As he did so, he heard a quiet rustle beside him. He looked over and saw a small note resting on the pillow to his side. He picked it up, holding it up over his head to squint at the scrawling words in the faint light.
