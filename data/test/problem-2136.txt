Harry picked up a goblet from the table, thankfully it did not disappear, and quickly swallowed the orange juice inside and pushed himself off the bench.
"I'm so sorry," Harry looked down at the floor.
Harry hung in the air a little longer while the rest of the Gryffindors descend onto the grass below. He caught Ron and Ginny slowly flying in his direction out of the corner of his eye. He forced a weak smile as he turned his Firebolt to face their Cleansweeps.
Draco jumped at the mention of his name, he turned to see Harry standing in the hall, smiling at him tentatively. Malfoy began walking briskly away from him.
Draco placed a hand on his chest and fluttered his eyelashes sarcastically.
"Last potions lesson? I did see you struggling. We can go over that now if you want." Draco feigned an interest.
"Yeah?" Harry lay on his stomach next to the blonde haired boy with his arms folded. "And then they'll cart your sorry arse off to Azkaban."
"That wasn't exactly his choice," said Harry. "He didn't know any better, and when he did, he was forced to do all those things."
"You wanted to speak in a private place? You had somewhere in mind?"
"If you're not in Gryffindor, we'll disinherit you," said Ron. "But no pressure."
He did this for a while, looking behind him every so often at Malfoy who still refused to look at him, hovering only a few feet above the ground.
Draco's eyes snapped up to meet his. Their breath intermingled. Neither of the boys moved for several seconds. Harry purposefully flicked his eyes down toward Draco's lips before returning to his grey eyes to encourage a reaction from Draco.
"I thought we'd play a little game," Voldemort chuckled, lowering his hood. "Before I kill you, you have to choose which one of your friends for me to kill."
The pieces in Harry's mind we're coming together.
-year-old niece and nephew."
"Probably thinks he's too good for it," Ron rolled his eyes.
"I did hear that rumour," Draco sighed, shuffling closer to Harry. "However, during my lesson yesterday, we were notified that it will only be required in the written exam."
Harry smiled to himself and raced toward the wooden structure, confident that he would arrive before Malfoy in any world.
"I don't have a broom."
Something in Harry's chest was tugging toward Draco like a magnet but Harry couldn't imagine how they could be any closer.
Excited chattering broke out amongst the students, especially those in the older years who had been too young to attend the Yule Ball during Harry's fourth year. It took but a tap of her wand on the podium to quiet the noise.
"Well, if there is ever anything you need, please don't hesitate to ask."
Harry walked out into the frightfully cold air of the English countryside. The sun had almost completely set, a thin blanket of orange light still peeked of the trees in the distance. Without a wand, Draco couldn't have gotten far.
"It was my conversation she overheard," Harry sighed. This caused Draco to look up at him through his eyelashes. "In potions, probably, she came up to me at breakfast and told me herself."
"Shhh!" Draco scolded. "You're gonna wake people up."
And Draco already had his broom, so no need to head up to the dorms.
The darting around after the quaffle did not help. He found himself having to pause quite a lot, claiming he was watching the other players for a moment.
Harry rolled his eyes. He still didn't want to go back. He knew what would happen when he walks those halls, when he sleeps in that four-poster bed. The memories will flood back stronger and faster than they already have been. The nightmares will seep into his conscious mind.
"You wish."
"I don't have a broom." Harry spun on the spot quickly to see Draco in his school robes with his arms crossed against his chest.
"I'm not sure," Harry murmured. Their lips were so close, he just had to reach up and touch them.
"Shut it." Draco cut him off. "My family issues are the last thing I want to talk about today."
"It's mine," Draco said quickly, looking down at his lap. "I saw it in the Prophet and imagined you'd like it. I apologise."
It was after ten more tedious minutes of this in which Harry only wrote another hundred or so words when Hermione kicked him in the shin. He looked up at her, obviously annoyed but she simply nodded in the direction of the boy's dorm. There, Justin Finch-Fletchley had obviously decided that he was done for the night and was heading up to bed.
"I guess some people didn't want their kids going to school with Snape running the place," Ron shrugged his shoulders, watching as they all gawped up at Hagrid and headed in the opposite direction to the boats.
"He'll be alright," murmured Draco.
"Okay, good," Harry breathed a sigh of relief. "But you know, as my boyfriend, you can call me Harry."
Harry guessed that is what he used to trip him and snatches it out of the air, still scowling at Malfoy. Draco smirked shadily, and he held the handle of his Nimbus 2001 with both hands, leaning on it a little. Narcissa must have sent it
"What do you want to talk about then?" Harry, of course, knew exactly what they were to talk about but any opportunity to drag out the moment that he was holding Draco Malfoy in his arms and Draco Malfoy was holding him was one to take.
"What! You wish! I'm not paying you for something I don't actually want to do. And even if I did, no," Harry rolled his eyes.
Happiest memory. Maybe winning the Quidditch cup for his last year at Hogwarts. Sure, let's go with that.
"He needs to rest now, please shoo," she flicked her wrists at his friends who give him one last encouraging look before they made their way out of the room.
"Hi," said Regulus, sounding immensely relieved.
Draco finally pulled himself out of Harry's grasp. "We've got to go, Slughorn won't tolerate our lateness much longer.
"Please no!" Harry screamed. "No, no, no!"
All while this was going on, a young wizard was constantly taking photos of every handshake and smile which began to hurt Harry's eyes after a while but he managed to resist the urge to rub them.
"Slughorn explained it like this; the potion at that stage was very unstable, the small splash on your hand sent you into a fit where it forced you to relive all of you darkest memories and then manipulated them to attack you. Thankfully the antidote was easy enough to throw together and Madame Pomfrey gave you a dose of Dreamless sleep."
"No, I mean about last-"
in black ink with his quill.
The temporary pain relief was definitely working. Harry's hands held Draco's waist, holding him tight as the two moaned into each other.
"Are you ever going to call me by my first name?" Harry raised an eyebrow.
"Why can't you just leave me alone? You and your goddamn hero complex. You just have to save everyone, don't you? Well, guess what Potter? I don't need your pity!" Malfoy raised his voice so that the whole room could hear, whether this was on purpose or not, Harry could not tell.
"Maybe I need more tuition," said Harry cautiously. He just wanted to keep the conversation alive, but he knew how strange that sounded. Malfoy stopped what he was doing and looked at him with his eyebrows furrowed.
"I'm not going to let this happen again, Malfoy," he promised. Malfoy ignored him.
Harry looked out the window again, trying to figure out what was happening. It was impossible to tell from the distance. A blue dot scores a goal.
They continued to lounge into the afternoon. The couches were filled with drowsy or reading eighth years. On opposite couches, Draco and Hermione snuggled into their boyfriends' chests as they dozed in the sunlight pouring in through the window.
"I have to agree," Hermione folded her arms. "This may be your stupidest idea yet."
"Do you reckon glasses suit me?"
"Uh, yes, right," Hermione pulled herself together. "Any reason though? For your sudden change of heart?"
"You're all up to speed with the basics, but a little owl has told me a few of our members can cast a Patronus charm," the professor's gaze fell to Harry. He looked at the ground. Harry hadn't cast a Patronus since before the war and he didn't know if he could. He recalled how Tonks failed to produce such powerful magic after the death of Sirius, and the grief that she had felt. Thankfully Hermione stepped forward and with a swish of her wand, a silvery otter glided through the room gracefully. Ron followed suit and a ghostly Jack-Russel-Terrier bounded through the air after it. Ginny conjured a graceful horse that cantered across the classroom and a Hufflepuff boy sent an elephant parading around the desks.
"Oh," Draco smirked as if getting an idea that Harry would certainly disapprove of.
"Excuse me," Draco tutted. "You're the one who interrupted a perfectly good moment with questions about my sex life."
"I would concoct a witty answer with reference to my childhood trauma but I feel like this is not the time nor place," Draco joked, well, Harry hoped he was joking.
"This is all your fault!" Draco grumbled as he threw the Shooting Star and the Quaffle into the Quidditch shed.
From the few weeks he had been sharing a dormitory with the Slytherin, Harry knew that Draco was not a morning person and would never leave the common room without looking presentable. He had also not seen the boy go to bed. In fact, he had not seen him since Ron caught the two of them on the Quidditch field. Ron was not happy with him, nor was Hermione for that matter. After a long and tiring argument, Harry and Ron went to bed without making up and Harry fell asleep trying to think of ways to make it up to him.
All colour drained from Harry's face as he sat bolt upright. "Malfoy?"
"He's not-"
Draco walked a little behind Harry while they retreated upstairs. Harry shoved his hands in the pockets of his dressing gown while he pondered why Draco was acting so cold after last night.
"How does it work?" Harry asked, getting to his feet. "Two guys dancing?"
"I've had so long to think about it. Too long actually. Second guessing myself, bailing at the last minute because I was nervous. But I guess I can't wimp out now," Harry closed his eyes, steadying his nerves before turning his head to look Draco in the eye. "Draco, do you... do you want to be my... boyfriend?"
"Well, I've already sent the letters and what happened to setting aside our differences?"
Until Ron gripped Harry's shoulder and pointed it out, he did not even notice the unfamiliar incorporeal figure of a ghost who was entertaining a group of second years.
"Can I ask you something?" Harry returned his gaze to the boy next to him.
Harry couldn't complain. He couldn't even think. All reasonable thought disapparated from his mind. His hands left Draco's waist and travelled up into his white-blonde hair.
Malfoy simply huffed, readjusting himself so that he was out of Harry's reach.
"I'm so sorry, Harry," Hermione tried a supportive smile. "McGonagall mentioned something like this might happen."
The group turned the corner to where the large wooden doors of the Great Hall were wide open, the sound of chatter pouring out. There were a few students of the younger years which Ernie shooed from the entrance in order to make the entrance that he envisioned.
Harry noticed that Ginny stepped closer to him as they walked through the hawthorns.
Malfoy laughed. "Well, of course you had to be the new captain," he said with distaste. "Guess what, Potter. I'm captain too, and I already booked this pitch this morning. You're the one who shouldn't be here."
It was Ginny, watching him closely. Harry blinked. Ginny was pretty, though she reminded him of his mum and that was a bit unsettling. He felt a headache just starting.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh?"
"It's fine, really," he assured the girls. "I'll eat in the castle."
Draco paled, and before he could say a word, Lucius Malfoy stood from his chair at the other side of the table and snatched the photo from Dobby's little, shaking hand.
Harry allowed Elle to sit by the window while he put their luggage away.
"How do you know I didn't let you win?"
Harry's eyes wandered through the house tables, knowing exactly what, or
"We can decide right now who's going to be using the field this morning," he said. Malfoy wouldn't like it, though.
"Oh, I'd love to write letters to send to my friends!" Elle complained with a dramatic sigh. She was sitting nearby and her new friends seemed intrigued by everything she did, by the look on their faces.
Harry made room for Elle to sit right next to him and got to work. Hermione saw this as a clear indication that their conversation was over and she focused on her book.
Once again, thanks for reading, don't forget to leave a comment or kudos :)
The two girls went right to the girls' side of the dorms, ignoring Ron pointedly. He didn’t seem to notice though. Harry cast a last glance at his friend and for a second there he imagined himself in his place. It didn’t even surprise him that instead of Lavender, he saw Draco Malfoy.
"Oh, good morning, Harry!" James said, pushing his glasses up. His grin was radiant, and Harry found himself smiling in return.
Harry had Herbology after the try-outs, where he was with his friends. And Malfoy. The other boy didn't look at him once, and Harry hated to admit that he was disappointed but not surprised. Malfoy always did this. He had a way of making Harry believe things would change between them, and then reality came and ruined everything.
"See you in an hour, mate," Ron said. Harry nodded and watched them go.
Their first class had been exhausting and Harry couldn't wait for Christmas break. He knew he was exaggerating but if this was the first day he could only imagine what awaited them.
"Fine," he grumbled. He didn't want to talk about it.
It wasn't easy. Not that he was scared about feeling rejected by his own family (that would be absurd, considering his godfather was gay and all that), but it was some kind of a taboo in the magical world, with some wizards and witches obsessed with pureblooded-ness and maintaining family names. It would be a huge scandal, and Harry didn't want that for himself. He just wanted to be happy.
Harry heard him brushing his teeth and flushing the loo. Harry was already under the duvet when Seamus came back and went to his own bed.
He was going crazy. Draco Malfoy would never say those words, not to Harry, at least. They were enemies, for Merlin's sake. They hated each other. Harry hated Malfoy. He hated the boy's arrogance, his drawl, his platinum hair slicked back, and his eyes that looked like a stormy sky.
It had happened on a windy night in May. For some reason, Potter had challenged him to play Quidditch that night, just the two of them. And Draco had accepted, the idiot. For a second there he felt like Potter was interested in him, too. But it was just his mind playing games on him. Potter was just too competitive and Draco was just there for it.
How could someone say something so nice,
Harry didn't feel well of all a sudden. Something was weird. This wasn't the usual Malfoy. The usual Malfoy was annoying and nasty but this one was... dark. Something had happened, something bad, and Harry could feel it, even though he couldn't explain it.
Draco wasn't in the mood to speak, especially about that idiot. He grunted and grabbed his Advanced Charms book, pretending to read.
It wasn't until they were almost in Hogsmeade that he sensed something (or someone) just outside their compartment. When he went to inspect this, he was surprised to have smelled Potter's usual scent. It was hard to explain, even to himself, and he was glad he didn't need to. It was divine, a bit addictive, and made Draco hate himself for enjoying it.
"Uh, sure? It's not
Draco never had any kind of contact with Sirius Black, but Harry Potter did. The man was his fucking godfather and apparently, he was an amazing one, according to Potter himself. He talked about Sirius and his longtime boyfriend, Remus Lupin, all the time. Sirius had given the Firebolt to Harry in their third year. Draco had been so jealous. He was always jealous of Potter.
"What did Sirius say?" asked dad. Sirius was his best friend, after all. They had met in their first year, exactly twenty-five years ago.
And perhaps it was because of that fact that he'd said, "
!" the hat shouted and the little girl went running towards her older brother, who had a massive grin as he hugged his little sister. Merlin, he was beautiful when he was happy.
"Still with his family. His mother's giving him a lecture because apparently he didn't de-gnome the garden in the summer as he said he would," replied Hermione, rolling her eyes fondly.
Harry's face burned. Oh no. No, no, no. He wasn't being that obvious. Was he? WAS HE?
"Yes?" she perked up instantly. Her eyes were shining.
He smelled of cold wind and pine with something underneath that Harry couldn't identify but he liked all the same.
"Ginny! Hey!"
Ron looked at him with suspicion but didn’t say anything else. The carriage began moving and Harry let out a sigh. He was suddenly tired and didn't want to chat. He closed his eyes but he could still feel Hermione's and Ginny's eyes on him, while Luna chatted away about nargles and other creatures whose existence was yet to be confirmed.
"Just what?" Dean pressed.
"I'm sorry, I can't help it. I missed you," the half-giant said with a nostalgic smile.
"Mother, please," Draco snorted. What did his mother know about all of this, anyway? It wasn't like he would marry Harry fucking Potter. That would never happen and thinking about it was just ridiculous. And painful. Ridiculously painful.
He came back to himself, noticing he was still standing there like an idiot. He sighed and went to the castle.
"I won last time, didn't I?"
Once dinner was over, Prefects took the first-year students to their respective common rooms. Ron and Hermione were both Prefects so they had to be there. Elle was relieved that she already knew them and Harry saw that she felt a bit more secure.
"What? I can sit here if I want," she said, avoiding everyone's eyes. She focused on Elle instead. "How are you feeling, Elle?"
"Hey, Seamus," Harry said absently while putting his books in his trunk and getting his clean pyjamas. "Why aren't you with Dean?"
They found their usual compartment toward the end of the train. Students tended to choose the same spots over the years, and Harry and his friends did the same, which was nice because they felt protected from outside noise.
(Thanks to 7HedwigtheBoo7 for being a great beta.)
When Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the classroom, Professor McGonagall was already there, looking very serious and strict. They waited a couple of minutes until the classroom was full. Harry and his friends occupied the seats in the last row on the right side of the classroom, as always. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry could see Malfoy sitting at the other side of the classroom, with Parkinson and Nott at either side of him. Malfoy didn't turn, but Harry felt like he was being watched anyway. It was always like this with Malfoy.
"Yes, I know. But I'd like to see you there. You're really good, you know that."
But just before he extended his hand, the door slid open from the inside and Malfoy's confused face appeared just in front of Harry, making him freeze instantly.
"What the fuck do you want, Potter?" Malfoy said from his seat when the rest had left. Harry wasn't even shocked he'd been discovered. He just wanted to take his cloak off and move his limbs.
Only wizards who had seen death could see these creatures, but Harry didn't want to see them, and he didn't want to think about death right now.
"I will."
He turned his head just in time to see Draco Malfoy reluctantly lead first-year Slytherins. Harry didn't mean to stare, but that's what he did. But then Ginny sat directly in front of him, her long red hair blocking Malfoy's frame from Harry's view.
Neville, Dean, Seamus, as well as Katie Bell, congratulated him. They chatted happily into the late hours and Hermione advised them to go to bed. It was only when Harry was sitting on his bed that he thought about how Ginny hadn't been there.
"Where's Ron?"
"Well, Professor Snape signed mine," Malfoy said, looking annoyed. "Looks like our elders have even worse communication between them than us."
"What is the meaning of this, Draco?" the man asked furiously. Draco stayed silent, staring at his shoes because he didn't want to encounter those cold grey eyes glaring at him.
"And what will you do, Harry?"
"You okay there, mate?" Ron called and Harry opened the door.
He heard heavy steps down the stairs just outside his bedroom and Elle's voice screaming in joy on the first floor. Harry rolled in his bed, not wanting to wake up just yet.
"You should put your uniform on, Harry," his dad joked. He knew that Harry liked his muggle clothes better, and that he always changed on the train. "Your sister would like that."
Lucius left the room, his long platinum hair waved with each step. Draco stood there, frozen, while Dobby made the ashes vanish with a click of his fingers at the same time he apologized profusely for being a bad elf. Narcissa was looking intently at her son but he couldn't even glance at her. He was too embarrassed to give any kind of explanation.
"Could you please fix my braids, Harry?" she asked.
"What is it?"
"I'm just tired," Harry said. It seemed reasonable enough, so they wouldn’t keep asking.
"You said before that you wanted to try it! You said you've been practicing for years!" Dean was shouting, exasperated and confused. Harry was confused too. He had seen Ginny play and she was talented.
"You haven't mentioned Potter in hours," Pansy commented offhandedly after a strained silence, which earned her a glare.
Harry wasn't sure why he kept staring, and then Draco Malfoy lifted his head and caught his eye.
"Life's a little hard for humans, you know?" Harry said. "You're lucky you're only an owl. Don't have to think about school or stupid crushes or... a sexuality crisis." He gave a sad laugh because that was just what was happening to him. He was ready to start writing that letter.
He followed her without making any noise; he didn't want to scare her. She went up the moving stairs, and just before entering the common room, Harry took off the invisibility cloak and called after her.
Harry clapped and howled with the entire Gryffindor table while Elle ran happily towards him. When she was within reach, he lifted her off the ground and they both spun around. Elle giggled, delighted.
Hagrid laughed. "Yeah, yeah. That young lady is the smartest in your year. and Ron... well, he's Ron. He'll do alright."
Harry grunted once more and sat up. The floor was cooler than he'd expected. He opened his bedroom door, still half asleep. Elle entered in a rush and started jumping around, too excited to stop.
His parents laughed. Elle was telling Sirius all about her new wand and books, and how much she would miss her muggle friends. Sirius promised her she would make new friends at school, and she would be a great witch, and Elle laughed, delighted.
I won't update more until next month so Happy New Year!!
After the incident, Draco hid his other photographs inside his trunk and put a spell on it so they remained invisible for anyone that wasn't him.
(See the end of the chapter for
, Harry thought. And how did he know that, anyway? He couldn't remember the moment he'd learned that fact. And here was, thinking about Malfoy again! He wished his brain could just shut down about the Malfoy problem for once.
That night, Draco couldn't sleep, but he didn't dare to take out the clipped photos. He wouldn't fall into temptation again. Not tonight, at least.
To Harry's utter relief, the train began to slow down, and he’d forgotten why he decided to enter Malfoy's compartment in the first place. It'd been a stupid idea, he should stay away from Malfoy. And he could imagine Ron and Hermione's expressions if they knew. And just like that, he decided that he wouldn't tell them.
Parkinson made an offended noise and crossed her arms over her chest. Zabini snorted. Harry tried not to make a sound, but he was getting tired of being in the same still position. It was too late to try and leave, though. Draco started talking to Crabbe and Goyle, or more likely, ordering them around. Harry suppressed a snort. Crabbe and Goyle were more like bodyguards than friends to Draco Malfoy, and that would never change.
"Okay, you go with them, if that's what you want," she said, crossing her arms over her chest. Harry thought about doing just that. A moody Hermione was not something he looked forward to, but Lavender looking at Ron, batting her eyelashes, and smiling way too much was even worse.
"Yeah, I guess I feel a bit lighter, now that you ask," he said, smiling.
"Hey, Ginny," he forced himself to remove his eyes from the general place Malfoy was standing, making
"No," Malfoy said a bit too fast. "I- I think we can fix it on our own. Your idea is not as bad as I thought. But we don't have much time."
"Are you wearing your uniform already?”  Harry asked, amused and annoyed at the same time.
There was an announcement in the far wall of the common room. It took him two seconds to understand what this was all about.
"Yes, I think she did, Ron. Come on, we don't have much time to change."
His father had found out about the clipped photograph. It had been an innocent mistake. It had fallen to the floor from his bed when he got dressed to go down for breakfast that summer morning. Half an hour later, Dobby, their house-elf, had appeared by Draco's chair at the dining table and asked in a rather loud and chirpy voice what he should do with the photograph of Harry Potter that he had found on Draco's bedroom floor.
The truth was that he didn't know what to say in the letter he wanted to send. How do you tell your godfather and his love that you might be like them?
Thanks to 7HedwigtheBoo7 for being my beta.
This was going to be a long night.
"Yeah?"
Harry took his invisibility cloak with him. Just in case.
Seamus cleared his throat. "Sorry, I- Sorry," he said. He put his book down and went to the bathroom.
Harry suddenly noticed how close they were, and it didn't feel like that day with Ginny. It didn't feel wrong. They stared at each other's eyes for a long time. But then Malfoy pushed past him and walked away.
"Yes, because neither you nor Ron were around, and you know Luna- anyway. Whatever you're thinking, it's not what's happening."
P.S. I don't have a schedule for this, I just hope it gets updated regularly lol
Soon enough was time to go. Harry took his trunk along with Hedwig, hooting softly in her cage. Elle didn't have an owl; she wanted something different so she got a frog. There weren't many options for pets at Hogwarts. At least Neville would find Elle's pet charming.
That arsehole. Harry wanted to hex him right on the spot. But he knew better than to expose himself in this enclosed space. Parkinson snorted but Malfoy didn't react.
So this was chapter 4.
Lavender giggled at his left side, and Hermione just scowled. Harry sighed. It wasn't the time to explain to his best friend what had happened with his sister. Harry was sure Ron wouldn't want to know anyway.
Harry fumed. What the fuck was this? Was Malfoy messing with him? First, he avoided Harry, and now he said they had scheduled their Quidditch practices the same day and at the same time?
"Please, I don't want Ginny to think I fancy her or anything."
"What do you care about what my father tells me, Potter?" Malfoy was on him in a second, his grey eyes boring into his, but Harry didn't back off. He wasn't scared of Malfoy.
"Did you see Ginny? She wasn't there in the common room."
"Uh-huh, I love it!" said Elle, who couldn't stop moving. Harry rolled his eyes. He took his wand from his bedside table and dragged his feet to the bathroom he shared with his little sister, who followed him until he closed the bathroom door in her face. She wasn't at all discouraged by this, as she kept talking through the door.
"Are you sleeping well?" asked Sirius. Him, too?
In a clearing up ahead he saw a tall cloaked man facing away from him. Harry's foot hit a root and he toppled to the damp forest floor. He looked up to the cloaked figure who was slowly turning around to face the source of the noise. The blazing red eyes under the hood locked into Harry who scrambled to his feet, terrified, and ran behind a tree.
Harry chuckled softly. "Thank you."
"You didn't have to," Harry smiled.
Harry knew the answer but was too stubborn to admit it. Making eye contact with Draco only made him feel worse as his smug expression only reminded Harry that he was, in fact, right.
"That's good because lover boy came to watch," Ron winked at Harry and pointed up to the stands where Draco indeed sat next to Hermione doing school work presumably. Ron's attitude toward the Slytherin had been slowly shifting from one of disgust to almost tolerance over the past few weeks. It was strange to see Ron this amicable with Malfoy.
Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Draco, and Parvati, who spent the celebrations with her seventh year friends rather than her fellow cohort, made their way back to the eighth year dorms briskly to avoid Filch and Mrs Norris.
The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.
Draco's slim fingers came to rest on Harry's shoulder which made him feel a little better. The lines began moving again and the slender hand fell from Harry's shoulder. He took a breath to steady himself and offered his arm back to Parvati who was still giggling a little after Ernie and Ron's comments.
produced a Patronus before and are being a right pain about it. I have
The two walked in silence up to the castle before parting ways to attend their separate classes.
"It wasn't a date," Harry rolled his eyes. "It was an outing."
He looked back to Ron and Hermione who were too busy arguing to notice his discovery. He picked up the piece of parchment, unravelling it gently.
"If you break my bed, I'll have to Crucio you," Draco chastised.
"Of course it's him," Ron complained loudly as Harry and Draco arrived by the set of couches the eighth year students had claimed.
"Alright," he shrugged. The two stood silently for another few seconds as neither of them could decide on the best way to begin a conversation. Harry was caught up in his head, fully realising the stupidity of the situation.
"I feel absolutely honoured that you decided to wake up on my watch." Harry turned his head to the side where he saw Malfoy sitting sideways in the plastic visitor's chair, leaning on one armrest with his legs over the other.
"Draco, I could never do that to you."
Harry was very surprised at Ron's offer. He looked back down to Draco about three meters below, mounting his broom and kicking off to meet them in the air.
"Well, we certainly won't be interrupted," Malfoy noted.
"It feels like it was," said Harry. "I don't even remember why we hated each other at first?"
"In the Easter holidays of the fifth year my Mother, Father and I took a trip to France and we stayed at the home of a family friend. Beauxbaton boys really do know how to dance," Draco smiled cheekily.
"How come you never told me you were gay?" Ron whispered, quite offended.
"Don't tell me you're also going to be a stuffy ministry man too," George scoffed at his younger brother which earned him a punch in the shoulder
They kissed passionately and fiercely, Draco threw himself over Harry so that he was straddling the younger boy's lap, fingers buried in his dark, and still slightly damp, hair, as their faces touch, hot and salty tears smeared against their cheeks, intermingling and drying as they fought to forget.
"Then what is this?" Ron waved the piece of parchment in his face.
Once every Slytherin student had received their diploma, the Hufflepuff students followed, then the Ravenclaws.
' respectively in a delicate cursive print. Harry looked to the bed beside his, the one closest to the wall. He tilted his head to see the name and his face turned white as his eyes landed on the jade snake, coiled around itself with its head held high and the cursive name printed beneath it '
"Harry!" he exclaimed, placing a hand on a royal blue armchair to catch his breath. "You will never believe... bloody hell... Ginny!"
"Even Ilvermorny showed up?" Whispered Draco.
"Well," Harry sat down on his bed facing Malfoy. "I was thinking about staying here... with you." Harry's voice was so quiet that Draco had to stop what he was doing to hear him.
"Yeah? And no one will ever believe you, Potter," Draco teased.
"I thought I would have. The first time I rode a broom, boarding the Express to Hogwarts for the first time, my first kiss, my first time. Nothing seems to be good enough," Draco sighed.
After a lap or two, the team made their descent. Harry dismounted his broom and walked to the centre of the field to meet the Ravenclaw captain, Victoria Smith.
The question stunned Harry to his very core. It was something that he had avoided thinking about ever since he and Malfoy began their friendship.
The Ravenclaw seeker hung in the air beside him, clapping solemnly in defeat as the rambunctious Gryffindor team all descended around Harry, cheering along with the crowd.
"Draco, that is not true," said Harry. His heart hurt for the damaged boy in front of him.
What was unexpected, was the letter that landed on his empty plate.
"Come on, you lot," Mrs Weasley announced. "I think it's ready."
"Because we haven't," Draco murmured.
Double transfiguration moved similarly as the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff students listened to Professor Larrowreed list every possible spell that may appear on their N.E.W.T exam.
"Doesn't count," said Draco. "It was your full name."
Harry collapsed to his knees in the dirt, staring up at the horrifying scene before him. Muffled screams from behind their rope gags pounded Harry's head and their pleading and tearful eyes pierced his heart. Green light fills his vision.
Harry watched them leave, still walking miles apart. He turned back to Ginny who grabbed him by the forearm and dragged him down the corridor and into an empty classroom.
"Harry dear, would you like seconds?" Molly Weasley asked as she flicked her wand, raising the rectangular glass dish, half filled with lasagne off the table.
"There is a difference between cowardice and self-preservation, a quality you don't seem to possess."
He decided to shower. The lock of the door echoed through the tile room. He threw his pyjamas and towel into a pile on the shelf and stood under the water, letting it trickle down his body soothingly. HIs soaked hair fell in his eyes so he let his head fall back so the water was hitting his face.
"I thought you didn't get me a gift," Draco said while tracing his fingers along the balustrade.
"Harry, could you please focus," Hermione placed her hand upon his comfortingly.
"Come with me," he got to his feet and extended a hand to Malfoy who didn't take it, instead pushing himself off the floor. Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry turned his head left and right, he was still unable to see his box. Slowly and discretely, he reached for one of the silver bowls and picked up a ladle. He dipped it into some chicken and pea soup and poured it into his bowl. To his surprise, it didn't disappear.
"Student, Staff and guests," she began. "I would like to welcome you here tonight in remembrance of the lives lost throughout the First and Second Wizarding wars as well as the battle that occurred within the walls of this very castle a year ago today. But we must also celebrate the new age of prosperity that has befallen the wizarding community across the globe. Our decorations tonight were chosen to reflect this prosperous season that we find ourselves in, but also it symbolises the new beginning of our society into a more accepting and beautiful future. With that, I encourage you to enjoy the evening and enjoy the hospitality our school has to offer!"
"Oh, Mr Potter," she seemed surprised that he had approached her. "It's a pleasure to meet you properly. I have to thank you so deeply for what you have done for me, and my son."
"Wait, how long have you been having gay feelings for Malfoy?"
"Choose one to live, choose one to die."
The living room of the burrow was filled with Weasleys. Though Fleur matched Draco's complexion, the Malfoy still stuck out like a sore thumb.
"He was tolerable," Draco let out a small laugh under his breath. "I think we were both stuck in our own heads."
"Are you okay?" Harry asked quietly, not wanting to anger the boy.
"He deserves to know!" Ginny leant over the table slowly. "They're saying that Malfoy slipped you a love potion."
Draco pulled back before Harry could catch up with reality.
"What if I asked, really nicely?" Draco glanced up at Harry.
Potions was the last class of the day, Harry feigned an emergency bathroom visit, telling Ron and Hermione he'd meet them in the Dungeons. It took a lot less convincing than anticipated to get Ron to leave him alone in the common room after their free period. The entire hour he had kept his eye on Malfoy who was across the room, bent over a table studying intently.
"Oh, just one." She waved her wand and two cups on saucers gracefully glide into the room and settle in front of the two of them. The cups themselves were white with pale yellow roses decorating the sides which danced in an imaginary breeze across the ceramic surface.
"Dark, mysterious? Exactly like me," Draco smiled, pulling away from Harry.
"Thank you?" Harry smiled unsurely.
He looked over to Ron and Hermione and realised that there was probably nowhere else in the world that this could happen. Maybe one day, Harry thought, perhaps sometime in the future, he could walk hand in hand down the streets of London with Draco Malfoy. From what he noticed, among the witches and wizards of the world, the matter of same-sex relationships seemed to be at the very least tolerated. Nobody talked about it much though, it was just an accepted part of society. But it is difficult to recluse oneself entirely behind the protective walls of the magical world and Harry personally knew a few muggles who would disapprove of them completely.
The classroom was just how he remembered it. Except for this time, instead of Snape or Umbridge sneering down at them, the dark haired witch from the start of term feast was watching them enter indifferently, leaning back into her chair. They took their seats and waiting expectantly for the witch to do something, move even.
"I don't need money," he stared down at the desk.
Ron's shouting grew to a chant throughout the entire common room. Harry looked to Draco apologetically whose face had morphed from shock to amusement.
The dorm watched in anticipation as Anthony's face remained untelling. He seemed to swallow and he looked around the room. "Under-ripe banana."
"Can I borrow Pig?"
"Malfoy!" He called after him. Draco didn't stop, he kept walking. Harry quickened his pace to a jog, trying to keep up with him. "Draco!" Harry reached out and grabbed the Slytherin's upper arm, forcing him to stop.
"I'm trying to have a genuine moment with you here!" Draco rolled his eyes.
"Well, at least now you don't look like a twig," Ron smiled, holding a bread roll in his hand. Harry grabbed one from the basket and tapped his to Ron's in a toast.
"At the trial. You told the Wizengamot that my mother and I saved your life, saving us from Azkaban and sentencing us to house arrest. After all the shitty things I did to you, why did you defend me?"
The Gryffindor list was the longest. He bit his lip as he thought of the students who should be there right now, celebrating the victory with them.
Neville had caught up with them and was conversing with Hermione about the theory of Switching spells which he could just not understand. Harry and Ron stood on either side of the two of them, silent and looking ahead. Harry was in no mood to grovel to Ron, he believed that his apology was enough, he was here for Hermione. He knew in the back of his head that they were both right about his lack of subtlety in ditching the two of them to go flying with Malfoy, but it was just a onetime thing. He wasn't going to become Malfoy's best buddy and spend all his time around him. He was just tired of school work and he needed a break. That is, at least, what he was telling himself.
"Are you insane, Potter?" Draco scoffed. "If the Ministry gets wind of any wands previously or not under my name, they'll come breaking down the Weasley's door and haul my arse to a premature family reunion."
"I'm flattered," said Harry sarcastically. "And what made you think that, anyway?"
"Do you need to see Madam Pomfrey?" She asked with a hint of scepticism in her voice.
Harry sat by himself at one of the many tables in the Entrance Hall laden with food. He picked at a dinner roll as he looked around at all the commotion.
Harry raised his wand, inspired by the energy in the room. and summoned his happiest memory.
"Potter." Harry stopped in his tracks and saw Draco get up out of one of the many armchairs.
The seventh and eighth-year students boarded exclusively on the final carriage, given privacy from the younger years. Harry managed to catch Draco as he was boarding and interlocked their fingers as Ron and Hermione found an empty compartment.
"I assume he was unaware that you cannot use the pitch if it is reserved!" Ron crossed his arms. "Why are you still here?!"
Harry closed his eyes as he tried to think of why McGonagall had lied to him about the reason for Malfoy's disappearance. Harry found himself losing consciousness after a while and let himself fall into what would be an uneasy sleep.
"I... uh," Harry dropped his hands below the table and fiddled with his fingers, staring at the angry burn on the bak of his hand.
Exchanging smiles, Ron, Draco, and Harry packed away their things into their bags.
"No, no, no," Harry slid off the desk and held both her hands in his. "None of that is true, Gin."
Harry grit his teeth and tried his best to memorise the pattern that Draco was creating with their feet. He steeled his nerves and slowly looked up from the floor to meet his eye. Draco smiled at him and began to add more movement to their stiff step.
Excuse me? Come again!" Ron yelled.
"You insulted Ron," Harry reasoned.
"Definitely," said Hermione. "I'll see you around."
It was a relief when they stepped inside the building and felt the warm air grace their skin. Quickly shrugging off their coats and scarves, they ordered four Butterbeers from Aberforth and chose a booth near the window. Hermione sneakily grabbed Neville's wrist and pulled him into the seat next to her, forcing Harry and Ron to sit side by side. She smiled innocently at Harry when he realised this, and he slid into the seat first before Ron begrudgingly joined him.
"I like your hat," said Harry, hiding a snicker.
"Oh, Harry dear. Did the young Malfoy like his sweater?" Molly asked.
"Seems fitting," Draco folded his arms, smirking at Harry who rolled his eyes. "You only prove my point."
Ron and Harry headed up the stairs first and found themselves in a long rectangular room with nine beds lined up on the opposite walls, four on one side, five on the other. On the walls behind each bed was an ornate animal, the house mascot, with a name underneath each. Ron and Harry found their beds next to each other, close the far side of the room on the left side with their trunks at the end of their beds. On the stone wall behind them, there was an image of a lion reared up on its hind legs composed of different shades of red metal with the words '
"Scared, Potter?"
girls. That's me by the way, hi."
Potter," Draco snapped. "Perfect, Chosen Potter's dedicated followers. That's who did this to me! I was minding my own business on the way to class when I was cornered by a bunch of fourth years by the looks of them. They disarmed me before hexing me, over and over, and when I was on the floor and they run out of imagination, they kicked me, Potter. They ran off and I was found an hour later by Flitwick who brought me here. That's how my week has been going Potter, so I don't want to deal with you blaming me for things I had no choice in. Now get out. I said get out!'
"Harry!" Coote yelled as he passed the ball to him. Harry's reflexes did not respond and the ball hit him square in the face.
Harry felt himself being pushed toward a sofa table by Draco and Ron. He stumbled up onto it and looked out across the rowdy Gryffindors.
"Is she okay?"
Herbology passed uneventfully, though Professor Sprout promised them that next lesson they would be studying six-foot tall carnivorous daisies which amused both Harry and Ron.
Harry laughed as he was pushed against Ron and Hermione and up against the wall. He wrapped his arm around Ron's shoulder and smiled as the photographer began taking his photos. The flash was blinding but Molly continued to insist they do more and more.
Draco smirked, clearly figuring out for him and closed the gap between their faces. Harry felt as if Draco was breathing life into him, the darkness clouding his mind was evaporated as their lips moved against one another's.
He dashed back over to Ron's bedside and shook him awake. In the Weasley household, if you wanted the best serve of breakfast and you wanted it hot, you had to get there first.
"Potter, I have no choice but to present you with options and you have to choose one of them," McGonagall sighed, twirling her wand between her fingers. "You can either help me to help you in aiding your recovery. You are an adult now and I can not force you to do anything, I can only advise."
Again, neither Harry nor Draco spoke up. Harry looked past her out the window. In the distance, small blue and yellow figures dart around. He could barely tell what was happening but one of the yellow blots seemed to score a goal.
"It's Park versus Potter, who will get the snitch?"
"I love talking about me," Draco chuckled.
Harry turned to Ron to demand that he return it but Ron was already reading the letter.
He waved over the Professor who tapped his wand to the tip of Harry's finger. A strange feeling shot through Harry's body as the magic mended the cut.
"Some positive reinforcement would be nice," Harry mumbled.
"Sit with us at dinner, I won't let them near you," Harry promised.
"You want Malfoy to sleep in your bed?" Hermione laughed.
They hung in the air on their brooms, soon getting bored of tossing the Quaffle back and forth and instead discussing pressing topics like whether Ron would ever be on a Chocolate Frog card.
"Did I forget to lock the door?" Malfoy sighed. "Morning, Potter."
Ron was convinced that she was going to announce the return of the Tri-Wizard Tournament while Hermione was adamant that it would be somehow academically related.
"You know, I think you may be on to something with this friendship thing," Hermione admitted, much to Ron's disgust. "I'll come."
. That's definitely what she had said.
Together, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Harry had apparated to the station, the last with Draco under the invisibility cloak on his arm.
Harry grumbled to himself about how of an unhelpful friend he was being, intentionally loud enough so that he could hear.
"In your tea, dear."
"For Merlin's sake!" Hermione walked ahead of him. "Talk to Justin or Ernie then! Harry, as your friend, I am concerned about your wellbeing and am forcing you to sort this out.
Harry stepped out into the pitch and saw two green dots flying back and forth across the sky.
"What am I supposed to say?" Harry sighed. "It's weird, it's a weird thing to talk about."
"And lastly, this year will be focused on inter house relationships. Forming bonds with people outside your house can strengthen our school and your personal lives." Ron let out an over exaggerated groan
It took all of Harry's self-control not to laugh. "I wouldn't know about that, Professor," he said calmly. "I was on my way to Herbology."
"I never thought I'd say this but I am so relieved for these holidays to be over," Ron leant on the window.
"Maybe you should be more careful as to where you have these, uh, delicate conversations." Everyone's head turned behind Harry where a very smug Slytherin girl was standing. It was Park, she must have overheard the conversation during potions and told the whole school.
"I have sent a message to McGonagall with my recommendation of regular checkups regarding your eating habits and whatever else you may want to discuss," she looked at him sadly. "You must realise that mental health is a serious issue-"
"Harry." The use of Harry's first name on Draco's tongue made his heart skip a beat. "You seem to forget who you're talking to," he rolled up the sleeve of his left arm. "I've hurt so many people, and I hurt myself because of it. Everyone grieves in different ways. As much as I hate to admit it, you and I are very similar."
Harry was beginning to reach his breaking point and just elect Michael Timms, a chubby fourth year who almost fell off his broom while taking an impressive shot at the goal posts which Ron just barely missed. That was when another boy stepped up (figuratively, they were on brooms after all) and managed to weave his way in and out of the other chasers and score a goal to the cheers of the team.
"Before we start our feast, there are a couple of announcements I would like to address." Groans echoed across the hall from the tired and hungry students. "Hogsmeade visits have been reopened as all third years and above will know," Harry recalled with his seventh-year book list came a familiar permission slip for the wizard only town that Mrs Weasley signed for him. "And as most of you know, several students that should have sat their N.E.W.Ts last year have returned so we have an excess of students. So, in our reconstruction, we have a new wing where we have a new common room and dormitories where they will all be staying."
"Well, I'd rather not catch something nasty like that this close to Christmas, especially from Malfoy," Ron leaned back on his pillows.
The library contained many sixth, seventh and eighth-year students making the most of a free period. Harry made his way to their previously decided upon table. It was in a section of the library that was mostly empty, in amongst the Advanced Alchemy books.
Harry slept with the curtains drawn around his bed, painfully aware of the boy lying on his right. The entire cohort of the eighth year boys watched as Malfoy walked in almost as soon as Harry had seen who the bed had belonged to. No one said a word as the blonde haired traitor walked down the room to his bed.
"You better go back to lover boy," Hermione smirked. "Slughorn's coming."
"What? About skipping lunch?" Harry asked.
"Well now that you've said it, it seems obvious," Harry sighed, letting Hermione drag him back in the direction they came, toward platforms nine and ten.
"This is the last time we're seeing this place, huh," Harry sighed.
The names continued. Ginny seemed very pleased with herself upon hearing she had received two more Outstanding N.E.W.Ts than her brother. Soon Brian Yellowbird returned to his seat and the hall became silent again.
Ron and Hermione both laughed at his nonchalant attitude and his concern about his broom rather than himself. "Hardly a scratch," Ron assured him.
Harry sat himself down again grumpily. He took another biscuit. "I don't know where he is. He's been missing since yesterday morning."
"That's amazing Harry," Ron smiled. "It'll be good to get back on the pitch."
"Oh, hi," Dennis beamed, quite flustered at the attention from Harry. "I spent some of the summer at my friend Makrov's house. they're a wizarding family see, so he taught me how to play."
"What?"
Draco obeyed and Harry felt the other boy's cold cheek rest atop his head.
Harry found himself glancing at Parvati Patil next to him awkwardly, an uncomfortable feeling of déjà vu swirling in his gut. He felt a kick in the back of his calf and turned his head quickly to see Draco's sinister smirk.
"Shut up, Draco."
"I think that's them, Reg," said Draco suddenly.
Harry nodded. He quickly downed the rest of his Butterbeer. "Okay."
"I was too distracted, too caught up in what you said," Harry ignored him.
Harry struggled to find any sort of words that would be appropriate to say after someone declared something like that. He simply reached his right hand up to cradle Draco's face. There were only three inches between them but it still managed to annoy Harry every time he had to rise on his toes a little every time he wanted to kiss him, but he did anyway.
Malfoy sat down without a word to Harry, he reaches out for some of Harry's notes and reads through them.
The crowd begin to disperse soon enough, leaving Harry, Ron and Hermione on the landing in front of the portrait. The three stared in disbelief at Fred who was very amused at this reaction.
"Shit, what time is it?" Draco asked as he caught the Quaffle thrown at him.
Harry couldn't fight the smile on his face as he saw the common room. It was large and homey, a fireplace crackled against the far wall and there was a staircase either side of it. Around the room there were couches and chairs in the middle and desks and bookshelves against the walls. They entered, marvelling at the size of it for their small number.
Harry squared himself. Looking up into Draco's grey eyes, and puffing out his chest.
Harry was determined not to stare just to spite Draco, so he didn't. Focusing instead on the fake Snitch in his hands, tossing it up and down.
"Yeah, because the look on his face when I walked in was incredibly suspicious. Was he doing anything, you know, Malfoy-y before I arrived?" Ron asked.
"Of course you did."
Harry sat down into the sofa he had left before and patted the space next to him for Draco to sit.
"Oh, it would be lovely if they got married," whispered Lily ecstatically. "Teddy would really be a part of the family then!"
As McGonagall began naming the Gryffindor students, the reality of it all sunk into Harry. This was it. The end. Goodbye Hogwarts
Harry laughed awkwardly at his comment before grabbing his wand to stir the potion.
"No, of course not. I didn't even know how I felt about him till after Christmas this year," Harry shook his head.
"If you tell another soul what I am about to tell you I will eviscerate you, Potter. But I have known that I was gay for a long time, sometime during the third year but it was the fifth year when I found myself becoming hopelessly and disastrously infatuated with you and by the last few months of the sixth year I had fallen so deep, Potter. I hated you so much for it, for making me feel this way about you. That kiss at breakfast, I can without a doubt call it the happiest memory of the last two and a half years. I did so many stupid things and most of them I could never expect you to forgive but if dare you think for one second that I don't have feelings for you, you are only fooling yourself."
Draco Malfoy was lying deathly pale (more than usual). He was nowhere near as disfigured as the last time he was here, perhaps he had even defended himself.
A basil green tangle of wool. Draco lifted it up hesitantly to reveal that it was a knitted sweater with a silver 'D' on the front.
"See you at Christmas."
"Kiss!" Ron yelled, startling Draco greatly. "Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!"
"No, I'm a neutral party," Hermione insisted.
Draco sat down by the window and pulled the hood of the cloak back to reveal a floating blonde head.
"I guess I'm... I'm scared," Harry admitted. "I before a few weeks ago I didn't even realise that I could, you know."
"Accio Quaffle!" Harry pointed his wand at the broom shed. A small red ball flew out the open doors toward him, he tucked his wand up his sleeve just in time to catch the Quaffle with both hands.
He picked up the white length of fabric which, from a glance at its cut, Harry assumed was to be his tie. He threw it around his neck, not bothered to tie it yet, when he heard the heavy click on the ensuite bathroom door being unlocked.
Harry smiled as Jessica Silver narrowly missed the Quaffle as it flew through the hoops she was protecting.
He managed three forkfuls before sitting back in his chair and looking around at the table. The entire Weasley family had come home for Christmas. Ron sat to Harry's left, wolfing down his second helping of lasagne, and Percy sat to Harry's right who was making quiet conversation with his new girlfriend whose name was Audrey. Even Charlie had returned from Romania to celebrate the holidays at the Burrow. Bill and Fleur sat near the head of the table with Mr Weasley discussing something Ministry related Harry assumed, while at the other end of the table George and Mrs Weasley were arguing about something almost definitely Wizard Wheezes related.
"Oh;" Harry snickered. "That is kind of old news now. But no, Malfoy and I had a discussion about it and came to the conclusion that some people exist to cause trouble."
"This is the match that will decide our fate!" Harry bellowed, standing atop a wooden bench in the Gryffindor team room. He looked at all his teammates dressed in their scarlet and gold robes, a sight he would be seeing for the very last time. "If we win today's game by at least fifty points Gryffindor will win the Quidditch cup!"
"Potter, you know I'm all for the dramatic but you really shouldn't have done that," Draco glanced around at the bar patrons uneasily, most of whom had returned to their newspapers or food, a few still whispered amongst themselves about the boy they perceived as evil.
Harry never once argued. The bell soon rang for the final class of the day and the three of them packed their things for Charms.
Another nightmare. Hogwarts in ruins.
"The deadline was Friday, Potter," McGonagall sighed. "You have until the end of the day." Harry nodded.
Harry sighed, staring out the window into the street, trying to distract himself from himself.
"Why I haven't received notes of any meeting between the two of you?" She asked. Neither of the boys spoke up, not daring to meet the headmistress' cold stare. "Mr Malfoy?"
"Maybe you should stop being a defensive twat and let me help you!" Harry rebutted.
Malfoy threw an embroidered cushion at Harry's head.
Chapter Summary.
"Oh, don't be a sore loser." Ron laughed. "I expect five sickles on my nightstand this evening."
"Well, you seem to be in a situation where you don't have any friends Malfoy," said Harry, getting frustrated now. "All your little friends have run off into hiding but you. Why is that huh? Why'd you come back! The only reason you and Mummy aren't in Azkaban with your Father right now is because I gave my testimony before the Wizengamot saying that you both were caught up in something you didn't ask for and defected in the end!" Harry whispered loudly, as to not get kicked out by Madame Pomfrey.
"Isn't this nicer?" Harry smiled.
The trio sipped tea out of Hagrid's homemade mugs as they filled an interested Hagrid in on some of their mishaps during the last year.
They both returned to their marks and mounted their brooms, waiting for Madame Hooch's signal.
Harry shrugged. "There isn't much to say I guess. He yelled at me to get out before we could get anything done." Hermione looked at him disappointedly when he announced this, but he ignored her. "And you'll never guess why Malfoy was really in the infirmary," he quietened his voice to a whisper and leant across the table. "He was attacked by a bunch of students, they hit him with a bunch of curses and kicked him!"
The Dursley's hadn't taken Harry to the beach much during his childhood but one of the times they did begrudgingly allow him to play in the sand with his cousin, the waves had been very powerful.
Harry had two slices of toast the next morning feeling considerably more hungry after not having dinner the previous night. The familiar swooping of owls delivering the morning post arrived in feathery style, amazing the first years who stared up in awe. Hermione had immediately stuck her head into the Daily Prophet and Ron had received a skiving snack box from his brother and successfully hid it from his suspicious girlfriend.
Harry whipped his head around the corridor worriedly.
Harry did not know how to reply. The eyes of the entire pitch were on his conversation. After a few seconds of awkward silence, he could tell Dennis was no longer the babbling and carefree first year that fell in the lake. Dennis sighed and looked at the ground some twenty feet below, he definitely knew why everyone was staring.
"I didn't know what it did, I-"
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry chuckled lightly. "Relax a little."
"Two Butterbeers," Aberforth grumbled, placing them in front of Harry.
Harry blushed as the whole room cheered for him.
"Uh, no thanks," Harry's cheeks reddened against his will. "Can't we just ask your mum for more bedding?"
Soon, the stomachs of the students were stuffed and McGonagall stepped up to the podium once more.
"Terry, you promised!" Hermione scowled. "Fine."
"Oh, you know you're welcome anytime, dears," she cupped Harry's face with one hand and Hermione's with the other. "Go on, take your things upstairs now."
Harry sat on the wooden bench in between Parvati Patil and Annie Price, watching over his shoulder as parents and family of the seventh and eighth-year students settle into the rows of seats behind them.
Draco, Harry, and Ron sat by the fireplace in their pyjamas as the Weasley Christmas began.
"I'm not staying here. I'm going to emigrate, perhaps to France."
"Us. I was caught up in a fantasy when I know that you do not feel the same way about me," Harry looked to the ceiling again. Draco's laugh, however, made him frown and turn his gaze back to the Slytherin boy.
When they reached Ron's bedroom Harry dropped to his knees in front of Ron's dresser, reaching his hand underneath it, feeling around for where he hid it.
However, Harry's stomach plummeted when he spotted a red-haired figure glaring up at him from the ground. He slowly lowered himself, so his feet were firmly on the grass before meeting his eye. Ron was positively fuming, his face, becoming increasingly red with anger.
"I must say, when Minerva told me that you had accepted her invitation to return for a final year I was overjoyed. I am so proud of what you've done."
"Yes."
"You distracted me!" Draco complained. "That's cheating."
"Thank you, Draco," Harry held the box gently. "I'll get you something, I promise."
"Draco. You've helped me more than you can imagine. I can't tell why you've chosen me, but I'm glad you did," Harry said out of nowhere. He meant every word though. Having a boy sitting in his lap, Draco Malfoy no less, made Harry feel so full. Like there was a little over missing that he didn't know was lost until it was filled.
Harry was humming his approval at Draco’s reaction. The slight burn of stubble and the expert way his tongue moves making Draco see stars. This was their favorite non-penetration position by far, as both got equal pleasure. Harry loved making Draco feel good, and Draco loved making Harry happy. Win-win all the way around.
“Mate, I’m pretty sure he knows who we are,” Ron chidded, giving Potter a bit of a cheeky grin, Draco being surprised that Ron found his way out of his reverie.
“I’m Dr. Inkwood, but you can call me Clementine. I find it more personal and intimate to call people by their given names. Since we’ll be getting to know each other pretty well, I feel it appropriate,” the woman says, clasping her hands over the floral dress stretched around her protruding stomach. She notices Draco staring at her obviously pregnant belly, and smiles. “Ah, yes, and I may as well introduce you to baby Ella, as well,” she said, rubbing her belly in soothing circles.
Draco slowly came down from his high, and was a moaning mess again as Harry worked his cramps and tight muscles out with his skilled hands. He always knew what to do for Draco. He always showed how much he cared and loved for his husband in his own way, and right now Draco could feel the enormity of it all.
Draco crept back into their shared master bedroom, admiring the way the sheets had slid down Harry’s lean body to reveal his toned, sun-kissed skin. Working in the Auror program definitely led to Harry’s bulking up and Draco absolutely loved it. He may have salivated a bit at the sight of his husband sprawled out, naked and sleeping without a crease of concern on his face.
With another smile and a “thanks, mate”, Potter disappeared and left Draco alone to his own devices. Thus leaving Draco alone in the room like he had been only just minutes ago, though this time Draco felt a bit uneasy. Why was he feeling so awkward around Potter? It’s not like he has a choice to be in this house, and like everyone said, he might as well try to be civil and take Potter’s advice and enjoy himself tonight.
“Yeah, enjoy yourself. You don’t have to be miserable your whole time in my house. I understand you’re here to serve your time, but I think what you’ve been through and continue to go through is punishment enough,” Potter can’t be serious. This has to be some sort of joke. That’s all Draco could think, because
“Harry! I cannot believe you!” Granger shrieked, smacking Potter on the arm. “You bought a house elf and didn’t have the audacity to tell me first? You know how I feel about elvish welfare and I cannot believe you went behind my back like this. I still haven’t gotten around to the idea of Kreacher, let alone another undeserving servant!”
Today, unfortunately, it looked like, was going to include a particularly awkward and upredictable visit. Draco had been in the living area next to an open window, letting the late July breeze fill the room. He was currently reading a newer book he found in the library,
Draco looked around the room, scanning it as if to make sure he wasn’t still in his dream. Making sure there was no Fiendfyre to consume him. His eyes fell onto the glass of water on the nightstand and immediately grabbed it, downing it in seconds. The Fiendfyre in his dream almost made Draco feel like he had been really there again, his skin smoldering hot to the touch, throat parched dryer than a desert, it felt like.
“But you’re a free elf,” Malfoy spoke up, astonished at the thought that one, his mother freed house elves, and two, that one of said elves is here wanting to serve him.
FINALLY!
Draco clears his throat, wincing from the experience. His throat is immensely dry, and gladly takes the water handed to him by this new Dr. Inkwood.
“Well, if you remember correctly, we have tickets to that matinee showing of
Draco almost couldn’t recognize himself in the reflection. He looked like a ghost; pale and spooked. Splashing some water onto his face felt like ice on his flushed skin, only momentarily soothing the burning skin.
“More than. I’d like to introduce myself,” Draco said, catching his breath.
They lay like that for a while, enjoying their post coital haze. They talked about everything and nothing at the same time, just appreciating one another, whispering
“Is Master Potter and Master Black ready for breakfasts?” Kreacher drawled out, wanting to continue to please his masters but secretly waiting for a moment alone with the intruder.
Harry carefully pulled out of Draco and flipped him over, the blond going boneless from the lack of oxygen and the blood flowing back to his brain. He looked totally blissed and fucked out, but Harry wasn’t done with him yet.
Draco spends the next hour or so dozing in and out of slumber. Whatever medication he is being administered clearly has a dose of sedative in it, since he had just woken up from sleep and felt like he could sleep even more.
When Draco didn’t respond, Potter took it upon himself to make the new member of 12 Grimmauld Place as acquainted with the house as possible, as he would be an inhabitant after all.
“Well it helps to have a husband as sexy and enticing as you, especially with all those delicious noises you give me,” Harry leaned down and left a trail of kisses across Draco’s neck, sending shivers down the blond’s spine. “Wanna hear more of them, if you’re ready,” Harry rocked his hips against Draco, making his dick rub into the wetness from his leftover saliva.
is not a
“Gonna make you come again, baby,” Harry whispered and didn’t give Draco enough time to react before sucking his hard dick down and shoving two fingers into his gaping, wet hole. All Draco could do was moan and grasp at Harry’s hair, holding on for dear life and Harry began bobbing his head and fingering his hole with clear purpose.
Anywho.. please let me know what you think about this chapter, I changed my mind on things quite a few times and I'm hopeful that I chose the correct path for this fic.
“I don’t think you do,” she countered, smirking into her tea mug and taking a sip.
“I haven’t the foggiest idea what you’re going on about,” Draco commented nonchalantly, sniffing his nose.
? What?
Before Draco could respond, Fissy popped over to Kreacher’s side of the room.
“No, I meant who sent for you?”
, leaving Potter to sit on one of the giant arm chairs.
Draco’s nerves were getting the best of him as he trudged down the street until he was met with an unfamiliar twang of strong protection wards, sending shivers through him as he stepped through them. That was odd, he thought. He had never felt the wards at Malfoy Manor feel so strange, and it was especially strange since this was technically his familial home. If a ward wanted Draco out, he would not be able to get through it so easily. If a ward had accepted Draco as family, it wouldn’t have felt like that. Draco’s heartbeat picked up. Just what kind of situation was he being led into?
Again,
Draco had been quite peeved when he got the owl from Ron Weasley stating that there had been an accident involving Harry at the Ministry. He had specifically asked Harry ahead of time to take the week off including the day they were to travel, but Harry, being the stubborn, workaholic prat that he is, asked if he could work up until it was time to go for the port-key. Draco only conceded because Harry asked him while batting those pretty lashes at him, not being able to say no to his gorgeous green eyes. Well, that and Harry sucked him off twice that night in means of convincing him to change the plan.
Carrunia Joro stepped up with an arm snaking into Draco’s elbow, locking him into her arm as if he might run away. “Well, Mr. Potter, here is your ward, one Draco Lucius Malfoy. He is not to leave the grounds, as I’m sure you’re aware, until the clock strikes midnight of his 23rd birthday. If you have any problems at all, you are more than welcome to contact any of us, by floo or owl, and of course the Minister for Magic,” she handed Potter a business card that shimmered with golden words on the black cardstock. Potter pocketed the card rather unperturbed, and Draco found the courage to look up at the person he was now warded to.
“Apologies,” Draco said, and corrected himself. “Clementine.”
Soon enough, the languid strokes of Harry’s broad tongue turned into pointed, jabbing actions. Draco fell to his forearms at the feeling and Harry delved deeper into the man, pushing the cheeks apart for an even better angle. Had they been anywhere but home, they would have to put up silencing spells; the moans coming from Draco and the obscene slurping coming from Harry was almost deafening.
, that’s basically what Potter was to Draco now. Like a surrogate or foster parent to children that didn’t have adequate parentage. This situation was a bit different than that, unmistakably, yet that’s how Draco felt. A lost child, an orphan. Draco almost snickered at the thought that at least Potter and himself had
“Malfoy! Wake up!” Draco startled awake as he was being shaken at the shoulders, giving out an indignant cry of surprise and terror, being woken from such a vivid vision. Harry Potter stood over Draco, looking with concerned eyes through his glasses down at Draco’s sweating, heaving body, taking in the sight of the blond.
Harry released inside his husband with a loud shout, coming hard while hammering his hips until he couldn’t anymore. He lessened his hold on Draco and let him fall forward with a gasp for breath.
“I was a slave to parents who were more concerned with blood purity than raising a child, I was a slave to the wrong side of a war, and now I’m a slave to this bond. Do you think I can really change what my fate is?” Draco asks hesitantly, not able to meet her eyes anymore, wanting to curl in on himself and not be seen any longer.
So they got engaged and had a large party to celebrate the both of them, and an even bigger wedding the following year. Anybody who was anybody was in attendance of the union between Potter and Malfoy. Of course, everybody was there but Malfoy’s own parents. His father was rightfully rotting away in Azkaban and his mother had been so distraught about losing her husband to Azkaban that she literally went looney. She had to be sent to the mental ward of St. Mungo’s and they kept her there until Draco was able to find a more permanent setting for her to be cared for. She still knew who Draco was, but sadly wasn’t able to cope with much more than simple small talk. The day that she was transferred to her nursing home, Draco had cried and Harry had rocked him to sleep. That was the day that Draco decided he only needed Harry in his life, and coincidentally it was the same day he decided to sell Malfoy Manor, in favor of living at Grimmauld Place.
“No need to speak, save your voice as I won’t be here long. I just wanted to introduce myself while I was here today before we meet in a few days. I’m your mind healer,” though her voice was soothing, it did nothing to calm Draco’s heart from racing.
,” Draco was a mumbling mess, but his message was clear. Harry gently scooped him up and helped him roll over to rest on his hands and knees; giving himself the perfect view and angle to work Draco the way they both loved the best.
“Give me your best answer, nothing is off limits or wrong to say,” Clementine assured, resting a comforting hand on his elbow as they strolled between roses and other various plant life.
or too

Kreacher gave a look to Potter, who merely nodded in response.
“I’ll never get used to hearing those delicious noises,” Harry mumbled into Draco’s upper thigh. “Think I’ll be down here a while so I can get more of your sounds.” That elicited another loud moan. Draco loved when Harry talked to him like this, his voice getting deeper and sexier than normal. Draco felt like puddy under Harry’s wandering hands and wet mouth.
“Oh, I thought that much was obvious. Mr. Harry Potter sent an owl to me about a week ago, asking for my help. Harry cares about you, you know,” Draco scoffed at that. Had she not heard him droning on for the past hour about how much Harry Potter was his enemy for the majority of his adolescence? “He does, it was clear in the late hour and urgency that he sent the owl that it was important, and when I met him a few days ago, it was evident that he’s concerned for you.”
“We know you’ve been here for a bit, and Harry and everyone else here agrees that there really isn’t any point in you moping around for the next few years or ignoring everything going on. That isn’t a way to live,” Granger looked softly at Draco. He wondered how much Potter had told Granger about what had been learned about Draco.
close to kissing Harry bloody Potter.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco suddenly had three pairs of eyes on him. “Fissy?” Draco was so confused.
She was a cute little thing with her oversized eyes and pointy little ears, though Draco would never admit that outloud. She had smooth features and a cheery look about her, contrasting Kreacher’s deep wrinkles and scowl. She was also quite tall for a house elf, the top of her head reaching Draco’s waistline, beating Kreacher by almost ten centimeters.
The food was good, but Draco couldn’t quite savor it as he had other things on his mind. After spending several minutes thinking of how to do it, Draco finally decided to break the tense atmosphere of the room. He was tired of watching Potter stare off into space, clearly lost in his own thoughts.
Draco mentally cheers, admiring the way he can move his extremities again without pain ripping through his body. He’s especially thankful that he no longer has any spasms that had contorted his body so uncomfortably.
Draco also saw it as a thank you present, to a degree. Nothing would ever be an adequate thanks to Potter for offering the use of his home, but Draco didn’t really know where else to begin. And maybe Draco wanted to show Potter that he wasn’t such an arse
Draco was sentenced to twenty-five years of house arrest. He had been held in the dungeons of the Ministry of Magic until his trial was brought before Wizarding Britain’s highest court of law; Wizengamot. Draco had not been allowed to be present for his own defence. He was told his presence was only necessary to be read the disciplinary actions bestowed upon him. Draco wanted to fight it, but there really was no way anything good could come about it. It wasn’t fair, no, but why would anyone in their right mind be
Harry’s thrusts were getting a bit skewed, having a hard time holding back his own noises, grunting on every thrust in. He didn’t think he could hold off from his orgasm again, he wasn’t that strong of a man.
The kissing definitely was working, short whimpers were coming from Harry’s mouth now, and Draco never wanted them to stop. Everything about Harry got him feeling so overjoyed and full of love. When green eyes fluttered open to stare into Draco’s baby blues, it felt like he was falling in love all over again. He could never get used to the sight of such deep green. They’re breathtaking.
Draco was a mess. Keening and pushing his arse impossibly closer to Harry’s greedy mouth. He loved when Harry ate him out, and loved the afterburn from the stubble even more. When he felt the familiar tightening in his lower stomach, Draco reached a hand back to grasp Harry’s hair in a tight fist, holding him firmly in place.
I know I just updated yesterday but I had to get this out!
He makes a promise not to entertain the idea of doing
“Yeah, always ready for you,” Draco whispered, preparing himself mentally for what was to come. He was rock hard again, not needing much time to recover when his husband takes such good care of him.
It was true. Draco had nothing that came from the Manor, the only things he ‘owns’ are that which Potter has graciously bought for Draco through Kreacher or Hermione. Fissy really was his only connection to his past life.
“Drake, baby, I know you wanted to have a proper vacation and I’m sorry I messed it up for us-” Harry starts and Draco interrupts him to protest; he didn’t want Harry to feel guilty about their anniversary last year. Harry puts a finger over Draco’s mouth to stop his protest. “Let me finish, love,” Harry plants a kiss on Draco’s lips and lingers for a second before continuing. “I know you wanted us to go on a Malfoy level fancy anniversary vacation. Hell, the last time we even left the country was for our honeymoon,” Harry was right. They had gone to France on their honeymoon, and it was entirely way too short of a trip for Draco to have been satisfied with spoiling Harry abroad. Two weeks of fun wine tasting, seeing all the tourist attractions, and mind-blowing sex went by incredibly fast. “I know I messed up everything with fucking up my leg last year and I’ve been thinking about making it up to you for a long time. I just want you to know that no matter what we do or where we go I will always love you more than anything in this world. Whether it’s eating at a fancy restaurant on our anniversary, or just a cup of tea on a Wednesday; you are and will always be my favorite place to be.” Harry placed a kiss on Draco’s forehead before leaning their foreheads together. Staring up into Draco’s bright eyes was like staring up at the clear night sky. He was always in awe at the depth he held in his perfect eyes.
"Sit up straight. Mr Potter, I strongly advise you start thinking."
"That was easy wasn't it, or are you going to need me to hold your hand as you go in?" Asked Hermione in a patronising tone as they arrived outside the doors to the Hospital Wing.
"Thestrals are nothing to worry about," Harry told Regulus. "They're gentle things, there's nothing scary about them. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the carriages, you'll be going in the boats."
"You can be the boy now," said Draco, batting Harry's hand away from his own shoulder and placing his hand on Harry's.
Much to his surprise, a large horned owl dropped a letter onto Harry's empty plate. A pang shot through his heart as he was suddenly reminded of Hedwig, his late owl who died trying to protect him. Just another soul caught in the crossfire.
Harry nodded.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had all taken the offer extended to all seventh years who want to repeat their final year. At first, Harry and Ron didn't want to go but Hermione talked them both into it. Ron had only taken a 'pretty please' and a kiss on the cheek to write up a letter to Hogwarts, while Harry wanted to be anywhere but those haunted halls. It would be like his first year all over again. People pointing and staring at the boy who defeated He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. But he had reasoned it would be better to be with his two best friends than sulking around the Burrow till he found his own flat. He had no intention of returning to Grimmauld place.
"Yes, I did," Harry shook his head. "You are not what they think you are. And if I have to spend the rest of my life convincing people of who you really are, so be it."
But the vapour was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody's faces. Detached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud. Harry thought he heard Percy discoursing loudly on the broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello.
"Everybody listen up!" Harry got the team's attention in the small room that connected the male and female locker rooms. "We're going to give our all to Slytherin out there today if it is the last thing we do. This, of course, will be my and some of your last year at Hogwarts, so I want everyone here to play their best so we can finish this year with a Gryffindor winning streak!"
"I'm so sorry," said Harry in a hushed tone.
"Is that a challenge, Malfoy?" Harry lifted his arm above Draco's head to twirl him around, causing him to let out a repressed sort of giggle. This did not go unnoticed by the group ahead, who turned and looked suspiciously at the two boys before going back to their own business.
Harry could not bring himself to focus on his Transfiguration essay, instead, he kept looking around blankly at the other students dotted around the room. He could see the back of Malfoy's head as he sat alone on a table near the restricted section. He couldn't help but wonder to himself if Malfoy felt lonely or upset in his own little corner of the library where any other students were giving him a wide berth as to not disturb the former Death Eater.
"Neville, I'm so happy for you," Hermione smiles. "Be sure to send us a copy when you're finished."
"It smells like you," Malfoy noted, scrunching up his nose.
"By what he learned over the past seven years, are you possibly referring to how you groomed him to die?" The familiar sneer of Professor Snape entered the conversation as he reappeared in his frame.
Ron and Harry probably should have been practising their Protean Charms with Hermione, Ginny, and Luna during their first-period charms class. Instead, they sitting at the back of the class playing Gobstones under the desk.
"Met for tutoring," he grumbled.
Their lips moved together as Harry felt Draco's hand slide around his waist.
Ernie levitated the box of sweets over his empty bed and toward Anthony Goldstein who stared at the box for a while before plucking a white bean from the box and inspecting it thoroughly before placing it in his mouth tentatively.
"How would that even work?" Harry grumbled. It was Hermione this time that paused their walk.
"You regret it?" Draco asked.
Harry got to his feet, knowing that Draco was probably right. "I'll see you later."
"What are you looking at?" said Park before racing after the snitch.
That was a loaded question. Harry suspected that he had been thinking about asking him about that summer's day in the Ministry of Magic.
"Come on, guys," Hermione rolled her eyes. "Gryffindor Tower."
Harry glared at Hermione, feeling his cheeks redden in colour while Draco laughed.
"Just try not to be yourself until we get back to school," Ron suggested. "Is that too much to ask?"
"Don't call yourself that!" Ron clung onto his girlfriend's arm protectively.
Although Harry was sporting a Ravenclaw scarf that chilly morning he couldn't help but cheer on his, well, he wasn't quite sure what they were.
Draco pulled his arm away and folded them. "It was after you left, I don't care. Just open it."
"Hospital wing," Harry looked up at him. "He's uh, got a stomach bug."
Harry was pushed in the direction of Madame Hooch who was now accompanied by Professor McGonagall in the centre of the field holding the large silver cup, beaming proudly at him. He tucked his broom under one arm and slipped his gloves into one of his pockets as he looked around at every student and staff member peering down at him, still applauding his victory.
"I think we should go back inside, it's getting late," said Harry, barely above a whisper. Draco pulled away from him harshly and nodded. Harry retracted his arm and got to his feet, watching Malfoy nervously as he followed suit. They walked back to the house in silence but Harry was thinking of only one thing; the image of Draco Malfoy's face so close to his own
"I..." Harry scrunched up his face and dropped his head into his hands. "It's the Patronus study. I can't conjure one anymore."
"No," said Harry. "Can we talk about you now?"
"I don't want to lecture you, but McGonagall promised me that she'd make my life hell if I didn't," he said.
"Well, I'll show you." Draco grabbed his partner's wrist and dragged him into the middle of the floor amongst the other couples. "Place your hand on my shoulder."
"And now, try not to be too embarrassing."
"Draco," Harry whispered, lifting his hand up to his boyfriend's face but he only turned his head.
"I'm not feeling too good," said Harry quickly.
The boys laughed about stupid things until Hermione returned a few minutes later, dumping an armful of packaged sweets and snacks into each of their laps.
Harry and Draco parted ways on the way to Defence Against the Dark Arts as their two houses did not take that class together. In fact, out of all the classes that Harry took, he only had potions class with the Slytherin house. He, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny arrived to DADA barely in time for class to begin thanks to Peeves the Poltergeist's antics on the staircases.
Harry, Draco, and Ron headed to dinner that evening on Hermione's orders as she had some 'urgent matters' to attend to before she was to join them.
"He didn't know any better, he was just a kid brought up with a different view of the world than us," Harry calculated his words very carefully. "And he, you know. Hurts himself," Harry rubbed his left wrist.
"I don't know what you want from me?" Harry turned to Draco, his complexion exhausted.
"You say that like it was such a long time ago," Draco mumbled.
The Boy who Lived crashed into the ground unceremoniously and when he didn't move Ron rushed to the ground after him.
"Mother," Draco groaned which made Harry laugh a little.
Harry nodded absentmindedly, looking around the hall with only one person now on his mind. Draco.
Harry lost track of time as he and Ron through the Quaffle, taking it in turns to defend the goal posts. Ron felt very proud of himself never letting a single one of Harry's shots get anywhere close to the three hoops. Harry was definitely not the greatest Keeper either, laughing along with Ron when most of his attempts to block his best friend's attacks failed. They both heartily joked that Harry should definitely stick to his position of Seeker lest Gryffindor suffer the greatest defeat in history.
Leaving the change rooms with the rest of the Gryffindor team, Harry was greeted by the entire eighth-year cohort wearing an assortment of Gryffindor paraphernalia. In the front was Hermione and Draco, the latter fussed with the platinum blonde hair peeking out from under a Gryffindor beanie with an unamused sort of expression.
"Draco, wait!" Harry called. The Slytherin's head snapped back around. "Come in, just for a while."
The trio managed to ride up to the castle in their own carriage. Ron kept craning his neck out of the windows to look at the Thestrals in awe. "Wicked!" He remarked.
"I... I don't know," Harry stammered. Harry really didn't know. He had this urge to be close to Malfoy, to figure him out. Harry needed to know why Malfoy was acting so strange as of late, and also why he himself was so anxious to find out.
He wallowed in his thoughts as they entered the common room and sat down by the fire to start on their charms homework.
Harry looked at Draco, and Draco was looking at him. He could not tell what the blonde boy was thinking, it was like Draco was trying to understand how he worked. This made Harry uncomfortable, so he scowled and looked back to McGonagall.
"Well I'm joining the Ministry," said Hermione, holding on to Ron's arm to keep him involved in the conversation as he seemed eager to leave for more food. "I'd like to be involved in the Department for the Control and Regulation of Magical Creatures. Make a difference you know?"
"He's got a point," Hermione looked at Harry worriedly. "But anyway, it will be nice to be back at Hogwarts without any looming threat over Harry."
"Downstairs?" Draco raised an eyebrow. "People will worry. And by people I mean Ronald, and by worry, I mean jump to conclusions."
For the first time in the last eight years of Harry's life, he really didn't want to return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
"It's, fine," Draco folded it neatly beside him. The sides of Harry's lips lifted as he watched Draco so carefully brush a crumb off the sweater. "What are you looking at, Potter?" Draco sneered.
Draco Malfoy was glaring at him beside a pale green armchair close to the fire.
"Hello, Professor," said Harry.
So he knew that Draco didn't hate him. That was good. But he was sure that he had still scared Draco off by his actions the night before.
Something stung his hand. He pulled his hand away to see an oddly shaped area of skin, burning and fizzing grossly.
Harry froze, unsure of how to react. He looked over to Draco who was intently trying to find a page in his textbook, well, with only one hand. The other was resting gently on Harry's thigh. It was probably a few inches above his knee and a slim finger tapped every few seconds very gently against the cotton of Harry's trousers.
"Hey!" Harry punched him in the bicep. Draco just laughed and flopped onto his own bed before patting the empty space beside him. The Gryffindor rolled his eyes, shrugging off his own jacket before tossing it on his bed and jumped next to Draco.
"Huh?" Harry replied dumbly.
"Lumos," Harry whispered. The tip of his wand illuminated a little of his surroundings, but most importantly, it illuminated a trail boot prints left in the snow.
"You have the face," said Draco. Harry wondered if he expected him to understand what that meant. "The face you make when you're having an emotion," Draco rolled his eyes as he made his way over to his bed, planting himself right in the middle. "I refuse to tutor you if you're going to be depressed the whole time. Out with it, what's wrong?"
"Are you saying you didn't believe in me?" Harry laughed quietly as he raised an eyebrow. Malfoy shoved him jokingly before returning to his notes.
Harry nodded. Then time seemed to freeze.
"Yeah, I'm going to stay here and convince Ginny to let me bunk with you two."
"Well, I decline," Aberforth went back to cleaning the bar. Draco turned to leave but Harry grabbed his wrist.
"I don't know," said Harry, barely audible. "I don't know."
"No, I just. You were brilliant!" Harry reiterated hopefully. Draco held a straight face, taking him apart with his eyes.
They fell silent again, simply staring into the flames together and being comfortable in each other's presence for the first time in their lives.
"Sure you will," Ginny rolled her eyes, she got a punch too.
Harry's senses were overwhelmed by the sheer volume of two hundred screaming teenagers. He laughed as the room finally came to a sort of settle, as settled as you could get any number of Gryffindors.
Soon enough, they were neck to neck again, reaching out to the golden snitch which fluttered erratically just out of either of their grasps.
He couldn't help but notice, every time anyone was talking about the ball, Draco was always watching him with a strange look in his eye, completely unnatural to his usual straight-faced demeanour.
He sat up the back of the Gryffindor table with the seventh and eighth years, chatting about things other than their looming N.E.W.Ts for once. Hermione, Parvati, Ginny, and one of Ginny's blonde-haired friends were discussing Kingsley Shaklebolt's current campaign as Minister for magic while Harry, Ron, and Neville chatted animatedly about the Chudley Cannon's chances in the upcoming Quidditch season.
Harry slumped down onto the bench seat of their compartment, Hermione and Ron still waving out the window to Mr and Mrs Weasley getting smaller and smaller in the distance. Harry watched as Ginny entered the compartment to ask Ron for some money for when the trolley lady does her rounds later. Harry ended up throwing a galleon at her when she started to argue with her older brother, this seemed to satisfy her and she headed off to her friends.
Harry watched as Malfoy showed up to breakfast late on Monday morning. He wanted to talk to him but he knew with Ron by his side so soon after their fight that he could only watch the boy from the other side of the Great Hall.
"Hi, Harry," the girl said sweetly. Harry vaguely remembers her name. Amy? Amelia? "We were seeing where Malfoy was going. Kind of suspicious sneaking off from dinner, don't you think?"
"You sound like Hermione," Ron chuckled.
"You're here!" Ron beamed as Harry made his way onto the Quidditch pitch for training. Yesterday morning was his meeting with McGonagall and that morning at breakfast both Ron and Hermione were watching him closely.
Draco definitely noticed, which was what Harry dreaded. He felt Draco squirm next to him but he still did not remove his arm, it was as if Harry had lost control of his body.
Harry squirmed uncomfortably. "The first one."
"Seriously, not helping."
"I can't believe it's finally here," said Neville as he tripped over a shoe he had left by his bead. "Nineteen Ninety-Nine. We're actually graduating!"
Well, flying's a lot more fun.
"And the offer I can't refuse?" Harry raises his eyes to hers defeatedly.
The day passed slowly. Draco had insisted that Harry go and spend some time with Ron and Hermione as the both of them were also grieving. Even though Harry initially resisted, talking about the war felt like the least appealing thing to do, he found some comfort in his best friends.
Harry picked his wand up from his bed stand and summoned the box from the Slytherin's empty bed.
"This is my dorm too," he began slowly walking toward his bed next to Malfoy's. "And I need to tell you something."
"Draco that was brilliant," Harry ignored his cocky facade. He pulled Draco into a hug which the taller boy pretended not to enjoy. "A Thestral is so perfect for you."
"It was worse before. Stop gawking and get out your homework," Draco rolled his eyes. Harry felt rather embarrassed as he rummaged around in his bag to pull out the parchment he had been using in Potions earlier that day. Malfoy held out his hand for it and Harry passed it to him carefully. Their fingers touched just for a moment and Harry pulled his hand back suddenly as he came in contact with the near burning sensation of Malfoy's cold hands.
"Who?"
"And are you keeping up with your studies?" Asked McGonagall.
"Yeah, whatever," huffed Ron, not taking his eyes off Malfoy as he walked to his bed. "I don't want any funny business from you, alright?" Ron pointed at Draco accusingly.
Harry glared at the Slytherin for a few seconds before slowly pulling his wand from his robe.
"What? About us lounging around the common room together?" Draco's hopeful eyes didn't sit well with Harry. Why was he so happy about his potions partner's mistake?
Harry took his usual seat near the back of the classroom with Ron and Hermione as Professor began her lesson on the unforgivable curses, something that the whole class had already been taught during their fourth (or third) year by Bartimous Crouch Jr who disguised himself as the Auror, Alastor Moody.
"I've been almost sure for about a week but if I think about it, ever since he started opening up I haven't been able to help myself being a little interested," Harry admitted.
Silence fell between them as it so often did. Draco was playing with his hands while Harry fell deep into thought.
"Parents, family, and students," McGonagall stepped up to the podium. "This past academic year has seen great success amongst our students. I have been lucky enough to see their growth from the day they first arrived at our gates to today. I know that this cohort will do amazing things for the wizarding world and I wish every single student here the best for their futures. I invite the seventh, and eighth, year students of Slytherin house to stand as I call them up. Professor Slughorn, Head of Slytherin house will present you with your N.E.W.T certificate."
"Biscuit?" She waved her wand and a tray of chocolate chip biscuits appeared on her desk. Harry walked over grumpily and sat down on the guest chair, dumping his bag beside him and taking a biscuit, biting into it unashamedly. The Headmistress walked over to the desk before sitting down gracefully. By this time Harry had angrily eaten two biscuits and had a small pile of crumbs began pooling in his lap.
"What do you mean," Harry frowned, grabbing Draco's wrist. He half-heartedly tried to pull away from Harry but let his arm go limp in his grasp.
"Does someone need me to give them a right jinxing?" With a flick of his wand, the Gobstones returned to their box.
"Okay, Finch-Fletchley," Ron folded his arms. "Truth or dare."
With a deep breath, he turned on his heel and headed back to the Great Hall.
The door creaked open and Ernie Macmillan's face popped into view.
"At least I get to escape this hell hole of a dorm room," Terry muttered, clearly intending to be loud enough for the entire room to hear.
"In memorial and celebration of this anniversary, I have decided that we will host a ball in honour of those who fought and of those who gave their lives."
The portrait of the Fat Lady was in sight and Dennis did the honours of opening it. The golden frame of the painting swung open and the nostalgic image of the cozy red common room could be seen from where Harry stood on the stairwell.
"Of course." Harry sort of knew that McGonagall didn't believe him, but she dropped the topic so she must not have been too upset. "I'll let you go to Potions now, remember, I need your decision by the end of the day."
"Pursuing a relationship?" Harry frowned. "We're... friends."
"I thought they were invisible.
The three didn't say much during the trip. Neville Longbottom showed up at their compartment and caught up with them for a little while and Luna Lovegood tagged along too. Ernie Macmillan and Justin Finch-Fletchley said hello hand in hand which made Ron raise his eyebrows, earning a jab in the side from Hermione. By the time the train screamed to a halt they had met seven other eighth years returning to retake their N.E.W.T year.
Harry's face involuntarily cracked into a smile.
"How long are you on probation?" Harry asked. He knew there was an unspoken rule between them to not talk about Draco's unfortunate situation but Harry couldn't help himself.
Draco stared in disbelief at his lost wand held in the palm of Harry's lightly tanned hand.
The two walked in what Harry felt was an awkward silence before Draco took a seat opposite Hermione where Harry had been sitting just before. Harry took a seat next to his right and moved his parchment in front of him.
"You and him, did something together? For me?" Harry brought his legs up onto the bed and down the other side to sit beside Draco.
"Did he get hit on the head or something?" Ron frowned.
"I'm just stressed, I think," lied Harry. "Doing our N.E.W.Ts after a year of being out of practice."
"I will not hesitate to kill all of you and then myself if we do not walk in there and impress," said Ernie as he placed his hands on his hips. "Smiles please, and Harry you look positively depressed. Could you please at least pretend to be straight for five minutes?"
"I know I want to be an Auror," Ron smiled smugly. "That's how you make a real difference you know."
Draco dropped his forehead against Harry's. "I think he took that rather well."
"Probably all the Ravenclaws," Ron flicked his wand to make a ball of paper bounce above his head while he lay on his bed. "Knowing Neville's grandma, he'll be coming back too."
Ron turned quickly and headed out of the room before both Draco and Harry could burst out into laughter. It felt wrong, to laugh on a day like this. Harry's chest stung with the force of it.
"Hi," said Harry.
He began running drills focused on the chaser position but he found most of the applicants bull-headed and seemed to just have shown up to get a glimpse of him. He had Ron play keeper as three at a time Harry assessed how willing they were to cooperate as a team and if they could actually get a quaffle past Weasley.
"I'm not worried about him," said Draco. "In six months I'll never have to see him again."
"Potter, Granger." Draco's voice appeared behind the two. Harry turned to face him and for a second he wondered how he somehow moved from one place to another before his brain caught up to the reality of magic. He smiled, he loved magic.
"In summer!" He made his point clear. "Why'd you do it anyway?"
her!" James added, as though worried he had not made himself clear.
"I know." Harry resisted the ridge to apologise again.
"You make it sound worse than it is," Harry grumbled. "Any ideas to where he may be?"
He climbed the winding staircase, slowly mind you, in no desperation to get caught out of class early. once he reached the top, however, he absent-mindedly knocked on the door, his mind in another place. Unsurprisingly it swung open by itself and he sees the Headmistress send of an owl out of the grand window.
"Friendship is one thing but you're not bringing Pig into this!" Ron jumped up, waking up the poor owl asleep across the room with his sudden noise.
Double potions on Monday morning got off to an awkward start. Harry replied to all of Malfoy's inquiries with single worded answers. He could tell that Draco was becoming increasingly more frustrated with him like he had every potions lesson since, the incident.
"I just get a feeling you know. All dark and mysterious, he styles the hell out of his hair too."
"How bad was it?" Draco dropped his voice in tone dramatically.
"There's barely anyone here, anyway," he said. "And I'm making sure you weren't lying earlier." He was right. It was Easter tomorrow so students had the option of returning home for a week.
Harry's vision flickered every so often, switching from the potions dungeon to somewhere else.
"I'm sorry. It's just, who was the one who spent a good thirty percent of his adolescence taking a dig at this family?" Said Harry in a tone that could not be perceived as anywhere near apologetic.
Ernie and Justin both laughed. "It may just blow your mind but Justin likes both boys and girls," Ernie explained. Ron's frown got even deeper and Harry raised his eyebrows in surprise. The whole dormitory seemed to have this reaction and the two lovebirds sighed.
"I'm not going to listen to your sob story, Potter, I'm here to make sure you get through your potions N.E.W.T with a passing grade, against my will, I might add."
"Maybe that would have earned some praise back in the Slytherin common room but here, you've got to remember who you're talking to," Harry nodded in Ron's direction. "He'd do almost anything to have what you have:"
"I'm just trying to understand!"
"You're definitely cheating," Harry complained.
Hermione nodded and walked off, placing an arm on Ron's bicep as she did to make sure he wasn't going to encourage Harry to do anything dumb. He did, however, glance over his shoulder at him and mouth 'Good Luck' which Harry received with a grim smile.
"Oh, and Potter?" McGonagall called just as he reached the door. He turned to face her. "Please make an effort to eat something, we can't have our star seeker off his game."
"Harry, Hermione, Ron," the booming voice of Rubeus Hagrid wasn't easy to miss even over the commotion of the platform. "I can't believe ya finally graduating"
"No snarky remark?" Harry folded his arms. "Not even a scoff?"
Every time he saw George's face his stomach twisted and hot bile creeped up his throat. It is all his fault Fred had died. Fighting in his stupid battle Fred Weasley had lost his life in the halls of Hogwarts no more than a few months ago battling a Death Eater just as so many others had. Looking at George was like staring a ghost in the face, a ghost that he had caused.
"Of course, Professor," said Harry as he picked up his bag to leave.
"Anyway," Draco placed the mug back down onto the table. "I did want to talk to you about... what has happened between us lately."
. Harry realised that he had no choice but to consider the possibility that he had somehow developed more than platonic feelings toward the Slytherin boy. He couldn't be gay, could he? He was sure the feeling he felt for Cho Chang in the fourth year and Ginny Weasley barely more than a year ago was real. But so was this.
From a distance he could tell four of them were boys, around fourth year, and there was one girl whose dark blonde ponytail swayed as she walked. They rounded a corner and Harry sped up, careful not to make much noise, so he would not lose track of them.
Hermione pulled him to the wall out of the sea of people to think. "The entrance to platform 9 and three quarters." Hermione guessed.
"Very funny," Harry croaked.
"Ginny!" He calls, making all present company lookup toward Ron's sister who was approaching the group with her husband Dean Thomas who held their twin girl's hands as they made their way through the steam. "I thought you weren't going to make it."
"Don't you dare."
"Have you tried to cast one since?" Draco raised an eyebrow, unimpressed at Harry's attitude.
"Freddy, I need to write to mum about this... and George," said Ginny, tears pooling in her brown eyes as she gazed at the ghost of her dead elder brother.
"Goodnight, Potter." Draco flicked his wand and pushed himself off Harry's bed calmly, slipping past the curtain and returning to his own bed a few feet away.
He gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction.
After the battle of Hogwarts, Harry, though glad he had finally rid the world of Lord Voldemort, he couldn't help the overwhelming darkness of the guilt and trauma.
"He's not going to cause any trouble," said Harry. "He's just here for a Butterbeer."
"I don't know, it just sort of happened, I didn't plan it. It's just been a lot harder to do anything lately."
Harry shuffled closer to Ron, looking around the room and lowered his voice. "Don't say anything, don't react."
"Potter, I don't have the energy to argue with you right now. Can I get a rain check on this disagreement?" Malfoy looked exhausted but all these ailments he was suffering did not point to any plausible sickness.
That was easier said than done, however. The fast motion of kicking himself off the ground and into the air made Harry extremely dizzy. He took a second to regain his composure.
Harry froze as George Weasley sat next to him, eagerly digging into his breakfast. "Oi, Harry. Could you pass me the salt?"
"We had an, uh, disagreement," Harry looked away.
The boys went about shuffling around, taking turns in the ensuite and getting ready for sleep. Harry laid his head back on his pillow, staring up at the blurry canopy above as his glasses sat on the nightstand. His mind raced with thoughts as it so often did. He was hyperaware of the presence of Draco Malfoy, lying in the bed mere feet from his sign who hadn't made even a sound since his arrival. Harry didn't know what to think. Malfoy was a Death Eater, pledged to the cause of his death and the oppression of Muggles, yet, he seemed so defeated, so ashamed. He clamped his eyes shut and fell into a disturbed sleep riddled with the nightmares he was now painfully used to.
"Of course not," Draco cautiously wrapped his fingers around Harry's hands. "I can imagine the sort of stuff that has been on your mind the past week, plus, my declaration of my love to you was a tad dramatic."
Instead of going to the Great Hall for lunch, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Draco all paid a visit to the house elves who were all too happy to see them. They ate scones and drank tea before saying their goodbyes and retiring the common room.
"Well, I'm honestly not sure," Fred placed his translucent hands on his hips and sat on the balustrade. "I was doing a brilliant job of kicking some Death Eater's arse, and then I died, and then I was watching everyone else run around and my body being carried off. No one could see me at first which confused me, but slowly over the summer I've been able to make myself visible."
"Have you told him?" Ginny panted. "Just show him!"
"And the matter of the Quidditch game this Sunday," McGonagall continued. Harry clenched his fists in his lap in anticipation. "I'm going to allow you to play."
This caused some murmurs across the hall. Harry felt conflicted, on one hand he knew that reuniting with his old dormitory would bring a comfortingly sense of nostalgia, while also bringing back hoards of unsavoury memories to the front of his mind. Ron and Hermione shared looks with the other eighth years around them.
"Well, I'm sure the Ministry wouldn't mind if I teach you a lesson myself," Ron reached for his Willow wood wand.
"No, I just never thought..." Harry trailed off. He wiggles his fingers a little in Malfoy's hold. "Do you moisturise?"
"You know McGonagall will take you off the Quidditch team if she finds out you skip breakfast or dinner," Draco folded his arms across his chest.
was engraved in beautiful cursive writing on the top. Harry lifted the lid back and saw a perfectly balanced meal laid out inside.
Harry watched her slowly ascend the boy's dormitory staircase curiously, wondering what she could be doing. He sat back into the red armchair and folds his legs underneath him. Soon enough Professor McGonagall returned from the dormitory with a basket of clothes floating in front of her. Harry didn't say anything, in fact, he pretended not to look at her but he couldn't help but be curious as to why she has taken a basket of clothes from his dormitory.
"Can you not call them 'gay feelings'?" Harry slumped in his chair, rubbing his face tiredly.
"It wasn't on purpose, I promise," Harry gave Draco a small smile and reached for the blonde haired boy's hands.
The Boy who Lived forgot how to breathe for a second. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione who were both looking at them with completely different expressions. Ron's face showed clear signs of disparagement while Hermione was visibly containing her excitement.
"Then," began Draco slowly. Harry could almost hear the cogs turning in his brain. "You have... feelings for me?"
"Then you fail," Draco shrugged. "But at least you tried instead of being a self-pitying, lazy, arse!"
Harry fought the urge to fall asleep in front of the crackling flames, he'd rather postpone the inevitable nightmares for as long as possible.
Harry thought on this for a moment and realised that Ron was right. He popped a bean into his mouth.
"Was it really that bad?" Draco whispered in Harry's ear while Neville and Ron were arm wrestling much to Hermione's embarrassment. "What I said before?"
"See you Reg," Harry said as his son hugged him. "Don't forget Hagrid's invited you to tea next Friday. Don't mess with Peeves. Don't let James wind you up. And don't duel anyone 'til you know how." Draco's eyes met Harry's with a slight smile
"I don't know," he shrugged. Draco scoffed and Harry turned to look at him.
Soon it was dinner but Harry passed, feigning a sore stomach. He was soon left alone in the common room, his charms paper, though messy, was finished and tucked inside his bag and Harry stared into the flickering flames, his mind drifting off to unsavoury topics.
Ron and Hermione all but nodded in acknowledgment of his announcement and Harry felt safe to sneak out of the common room.
Voldemort seemed to grow impatient and shoved Malfoy to the ground. He held his wand high and yelled; "Avada Kedavra!"
"Hey!"
He swung the door open and grabbed the first broom he saw, tucking it under his arm and flying back to an unimpressed Malfoy.
"So why don't you want to talk about it?"
"You act like I'm not just naturally a great person," Draco placed a hand on his chest in mock offence. Hermione and Ron shared a concerned look before turning back to Draco which did not go unnoticed. "That was a joke, just by the way."
"What are you sorry about?" Draco asked in a choked sort of whisper. "Not everything is about you."
"No, no need," Harry placed a hand on Draco's forearm. "If I knew I would have gotten you something."
"Oh."
Draco was already in the dorm room when Harry, Ron, and the rest of the Eighth year boys entered for their first night back after the Christmas break.
"Where is Malfoy anyway?" Anthony asked nobody in particular.
"I'm so glad you came, Mal- Draco," Hermione smiled, Ron stared at her, mouth agape as if she had said something so incredibly controversial.
Ron rolled his eyes. "Shut it. And who am I going to tell? Come on. Between you and me."
He and Draco were no longer holding hands as they entered the common room last. Some still looked at Draco with judgement heavy in their eyes but that was so beyond Harry's ability to care anymore.
"Of course," Draco replied, not looking up from his book. "Though bear in mind that now I know of its existence and know it's whereabouts, I may be borrowing it."
"Harry, are you gay?"
"No, no, no," Draco grabbed Harry again, making sure he was listening to him. "I meant every word, I just can't imagine that it helped you in any way." He guided Harry over to a two-seater couch and motioned for him to sit with him.
Harry sat on the end of Draco's bed as he waited for him to return from the en-suite bathroom which he had excused himself to.
Harry awoke on Christmas Eve clutching his duvet around him. He curled himself into a ball as his conscious mind made him so much more aware of the freezing temperature. He looked up to the window to see nothing but white sky. It was snowing.
He pulled the curtain back slowly to reveal Malfoy sitting up in the white bed, the sheets pooling around his waist. He was an odd sight to see. He was wearing his school white button-up shirt but all the buttons were one-off, making the shirt sit wonkily on his thin frame but Malfoy had not seemed to notice. His blonde hair was neatly brushed and parted to the side, not a hair out of place which suggested that it had taken a priority in the process of 'making himself presentable'.
"I didn't bring my Nimbus," Malfoy folded his arms.
"What is with you and running off?" Harry asked.
Harry didn't acknowledge his comment. He was too busy thinking up ways to get back at the horrid students. Malfoy sensed this and opened his eye again.
"Thought you'd never show up," Malfoy mumbled. Harry chuckled under his breath and brought his legs up beside him on the chair. "I got you this by the way."
The presence didn't speak, that was fine by Harry, he wasn't in the mood to speak. The silence continued and Harry could eliminate the suspects in his mind. Ron and Neville could not stand silence for this long, Terry was not the sentimental type and Justin and Ernie weren't likely o seperate on a day like this.
, much quieter at apparating than Kreacher. Maybe it was the fact that Fissy was so young.
“Malfoy, your presence has been requested by the Minister for Magic,” came Officer Otters’ deep, booming voice, echoing easily in the confines of his small cell. Draco didn’t respond, he never responded verbally unless specifically asked to. It went without saying that not many people liked Draco, or any Malfoy for that matter. Instead, Draco nodded to the authoritative figure in the room, quickly putting on the clothing he was wearing when he first was brought to the dungeon, but had been quickly taken from him to be replaced by the appointed thin sleep pants and dingy white t-shirt. Seeing his own clothes in a pile on the chair looked like a good sign. Why would they allow him to get dressed in his personal clothing if he was to be carted off to Azkaban, right?
“Gods, you’re so perfect. Always so perfect for me, Drake,” Harry complimented holding onto Draco’s hips to steady himself and resist the urge to pound his husband right away.
He stood there in dark muggle jeans, blue and white checkered plaid button up, sleeves rolled to his elbows. He looked like any normal teenager, except to Draco, he was the vision of nightmares coming true. He had many dreams about the War, most of them containing Potter. He dreamt of being cursed or beaten by the boy in front of him, knowing that Draco was partly the cause of some of his friends’ death. Draco almost wished for Potter to show up while he was in the dungeons of the Ministry. Maybe if the guards had just walked far enough away, Potter could have put Draco out of his misery without any fuss and never have to worry about anything ever again.
Kreacher and Fissy really went all out. There was cinnamon toast, bacon, petits pains au chocolat, omelets, yogurt with granola, tea, coffee and even mimosas were served to the pair. If Draco didn’t know any better, he would have thought this looked like a date with Potter.
Potter put his hands up in defense, not wanting to feel any more of Granger’s wrath. “Woah, Hermione, wait! She’s not mine, she’s Malfoy’s.” Potter said.
his D.M.L.E. badge read, his identification picture obviously hadn’t been updated recently as he was clean cut and shaven in the photograph, and younger then but he was now sporting a shoulder length tight braids and a tidy beard speckled white from age, perfectly contrasting his dark, blemish free skin.
Sometimes Draco had to be reminded just how powerful a house elf could be, especially if they had been within a powerful magical house with strong magical masters. Depending on how well the elves were treated, they could become more powerful than their own masters. That’s why most house elves were treated like scum; to keep their powers diminished just enough to serve what their master’s required and nothing more. Kreacher obviously had strong magic within him, but his allegiance to the Black house and Black family were much more potent than any desires to overcome his masters.
"Um, I don't know yet. I mean, I like a lot of things, you know. It's hard to choose one."
He left the dinner table to go for a walk. He went to the lake, which was pitch black as always, and sat under his favourite tree. He took out the piece of parchment and cast a
"Knock, knock," said a cheery voice.
He gave Hedwig half of his bacon and let her go to the owlery to rest after grabbing his uncles' letter and kept it inside the pocket of his robe the whole day. He didn't want anyone knowing about the letter, it would be so embarrassing. He wasn't ready to talk about this to Ron and Hermione, even knowing that they wouldn't make much of a fuss.
"Yes. What?" he said, now confused. "What's going on?"
Ginny turned back with a pale face. She was scared to see him.
, his brain supplied helpfully.
"She's worse than I was at her age," Harry thought, chuckling to himself.
"Where's Elle?"
"Potter," Malfoy sneered. He looked tired but energetic, just as Harry did. "What the hell are you doing here?"
I've been really busy these days because I'm studying again and I also have to work so yeah... life sucks. So next chapter could take a while, sorry about that (:
"Yeah, you know Ron wants to be an Auror, and Hermione will be the next Minister of Magic or something," Harry said as a way to apologize on behalf of his friends. "This is not exactly a useful class for them."
"Well, Elle is like having a pair of Weasley twins, I swear she never stops moving."
Harry entered the bathroom first. He took his glasses off and put them on the sink while he fumbled with his uniform robes. He put his muggle clothes on the little bag he carried. He sighed. The invisibility cloak was lying at his feet on the bathroom floor. He picked it up, knowing what he was going to do now.
Draco followed Officer Otters, and another guard, unfamiliar to Draco, flanked him in the rear. He was brought to the lift that was promptly opened upon their approach. Draco had only been in this lift three times, now four, but it never made him any less nervous to be trapped in such a confined space with people he didn’t know and with no protection.
Harry chuckled, working a particularly difficult knot out of Draco’s shoulders. “Just wait until you get my dick in you.”
Draco barked out a laugh. “What, so I have to save Potter from near death situations again? In case you haven’t noticed, I can’t leave this god forsaken house. Even if I could - the fact is that Potter isn’t in any imminent danger now that Voldemort is dead. It doesn’t seem that he’ll be needing saving anytime soon.”
The planning for Potter’s party was actually quite meticulous, though Draco quite liked the busy work, being cooped up for so long was taking its toll. It was going to be a rather large event, hosting almost every Hogwarts alumni that had ever crossed paths with the Savior; that is, the ones that are still alive.
“Whatever you say, stud. Just know I’ll probably fall asleep in the second act, if I can even make it that far,” Draco joked and tried to steal another kiss from Harry, but was denied. He may or may not have given Harry an indignant
Draco had finally looked up, only to stare incredulously at the Minister. His confusion diffusing into the stuffy room and the burn of eyes upon him escalated.
Draco pushed Potter’s hands off of his shoulder as he sat up and walked out of his bedroom to the bathroom in the hallway, the only room separating Draco’s and Potter’s bedrooms. Once in the bathroom, Draco shut the door, locked it for good measure, and stared at himself in the mirror above the sink trying to catch his breath and bring himself back to the present. He was alive, whether he liked it or not. He wasn’t in any imminent danger. There was no Fiendfyre.
, darling, it’s a classic! Sorry that you and your ‘mightier than thou’ family never let you read such lovely works just because Shakespeare was a muggle,” Harry leaned down and gave Draco a chaste peck to the mouth. “Besides, I didn’t forget, I just haven’t fully woken up yet.”
It was enchanting, and Draco was mesmerized. He barely heard the slight clearing of a throat, so caught up in the flora bombarding his senses.
Draco says goodbye to Clementine, having been uplifted tenfold. He immediately rushes back into the house, beaming with desire. Desire to start over and rewrite his history, and get a second chance at life. It was almost like Clementine had slipped him a delirium potion because he felt like he was on the clouds, floating above the weight of his mistakes and doubts.
, Draco thought. A tray holding six cups of tea with all the fixings and a plate of tarts on the side was placed upon the table between everyone, Kreacher having made one for Draco even after he refused. He wondered if Kreacher had heard Potter ask Draco to stay, or if the house elf took it upon himself anyway.
“I- I want your mouth, Harry,” Draco was so out of breath and he hadn’t even been doing any work. “I want you naked,” he added, wanting to see and feel all that Harry has to offer. Harry chuckled at Draco’s words and effortlessly vanished his clothing, earning himself another groan from his husband.
“Drake, baby- oh gods, I’m gonna come, oh-oh,” he punctuated each word with hard thrusts, feeling his core clenching with the effort and impeding orgasm.
Draco lays in bed for a few more days, only moving to use the bathroom and to get washed up. He had been looked after by a young witch, new to the nursing program, probably all that St. Mungo could spare for an ex-Death Eater, but she was nice and helpful. By the end of the third day, Draco feels like he’s been stuck in hibernation for a year. He hadn’t seen the sunshine in days since the curtains were charmed to completely block out all light, and he was craving being outside.
“Fuck, I love this,” Harry moaned into Draco’s mouth, bodies moving together with the air of familiarity. Draco moaned back, his hands traveling anywhere he could reach and Harry pounded into him from behind, his leaking erection bobbing with each thrust.
