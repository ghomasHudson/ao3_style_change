He had half a thought to be bitter about it, but then Harry was pressing down the flush for the sake of lame pretense, and kissing Draco quickly under the sound of running water before opening the door slightly and slipping through, and Draco could only think he was in love and leave it at that.
‘No. He will be, though. Can I go n-’ the telltale sound of stone scraping on stone behind Draco signaled that the stairs were changing paths once more. Ron’s sigh was too tired to be properly angry. ‘You absolute fucking prick.’
'It doesn't matter, because I don't want to fuck Potter,' and he took a big swig of his drink, hoping the sickly sweet taste would tame the bitterness of those words.
Harry groaned, and he was tensing again, his muscles trembling under Draco's hands, 'Fuck, Malfoy, I'm gonna- Malfoy,
'Relax, Potter. I'm just here to watch the show,' he answered as plainly as possible, that detached inflection he was never brave enough to shake from his tone. The boys he'd come with leaned against the tapestries as well. Ron swiped the bottle from Neville and Harry's grip, and tilted it into his mouth. Draco started his second beer in nervous and majorly irresponsible gulps.
He considered changing shirts, was halfway through sliding off it before he changed his mind, sat in the common room until everyone had turned in and the flames had gone out and passed the time by watching the lazily swirling waters of the lake. When the hour approached, he gingerly walked out, making sure the entrance morphed to smooth stone once more before heading down to the Potions classroom.
Harper arched a brow, inching closer to the sofa where Draco was still resolutely wishing that everyone would leave and let him return to sleep.
Neville let out a self-conscious laughter, curls of hair falling over one of his eerie red eyes, and Ginny and Fletchley were urging him on while he fiddled with the little shot glass, and it wasn’t that Neville seemed uncomfortable but he didn’t seem unquestionably up for it either, so Draco sighed and spoke over the chatter:
With an insurmountable effort to keep his tone levelled, and an acid feeling like bile on his throat, he bit out, ‘She hardly seems like Potter’s type.’
happiness. The type of joy he got for foolish things that meant nothing at all, little tokens he’d keep in self-indulgence, signs that Harry might not be truly his but at least he wasn’t someone else’s yet. He didn’t know anyone’s touch, wasn’t hiding some affair with someone, couldn’t picture anyone in vivid detail. It wasn’t much - it wasn’t anything, really - but it felt
It was difficult not to melt at that. Not to suppress his own arousal and bury Harry in the warmth of his covers and relish simply in that innocent intimacy. But Harry was gyrating his hips ever so slightly against the mattress, and his nerves seemed tied with excitement, and Draco's own want was so overwhelming that he could barely think besides it.
Draco's lips pressed into a bitter line. Of course he was. Who wouldn't want to be Harry Potter's friend? And whom would Potter not welcome with a friendly smile? Everyone - absolutely fucking
; wanted to eat him out and finger him and grip his thighs still as he tortured his prostate; wanted so badly to fuck him, to feel him convulse around him all warm and tight, to fuck him bent and spread and balanced over him; wanted to explore the way he’d gone all red and evasive the night everyone was sharing kinks, to see if he did want to be choked, if he’d moan so prettily if Draco spanked him, if he’d let him tie his wrists with his red and golden tie, just once, just to try it, or cover his eyes with his own tie to match the green of his irises. Wanted, wanted, wanted so desperately that the forms and scenarios and sensations flashed so quickly they blended into pink and blurry and dangerously urgent, the type of growing heat that doesn’t only burst to flames but explodes.
that it might be Potter became intolerable, and he stalked off before the sun had gone under the snowy mounds.
So Draco nodded, keeping a smirk at bay when he innocently asked, ‘Do you know what happens today, Harry?’
Digging nails into his back, Draco walked them blindly against one of the desks, not bothering to break the kiss. Harry had been precisely as presumptuous as him - no robes, only the thin white uniform shirt, the flimsiest barrier keeping his fingers, lips, tongue from plains of gorgeous skin… the thought made him groan into Harry’s mouth, a ragged sound pitifully premature in the situation.
That, at least, got Draco to fully face him. Banging an impatient fist on the corner of his workbench, Ron stood with an uncertain type of anger - pressing, intense and entirely purposeless. Overall, it was quite a standard look for Weasley.
time, and it would inevitably feel strange, and what if he didn’t like it? What if Draco couldn’t make it good?
Harry cut him off with a firm kiss, pushing him against the door. Draco’s back snapped against the wood, his hands fell instantly to Harry’s hips - and his lip had healed, and he could kiss
. Like he was so good at endurance that he craved the hurt. And it was the sort of thing no one talked about, the type of thing not solved by words, so Draco kissed him instead, swallowed the laughter since it wasn't
not frightened, not regretful, and now at last the colours brightened into carnival hysteria, the icy air felt sweet in his lungs, and the world was better, the world had
Harry hummed, a thoughtful little thing, but said nothing else. As silence descended upon them, Draco could feel sleep coax his eyelids closer together. Harry’s body, half draped over him, rhythmically shifting with each slow intake of breath, was the most pleasant weight. How wonderful would it be to fall asleep every night with the subtle graze of black hair under his chin? The warm press of lips on his sternum? Perhaps together they’d fend off each other’s nightmares. Lazy nights between sheets, sleeping with their limbs entangled. He figured he’d quite like that.
'You're not thinking of going down those stairs by yourself, are you?' he ended up saying, rushed, impulsive, in the entirely wrong tone.
Harry nodded, and Draco drew a smug smile as he opened up to take in Harry's dick again, deeper than before, hollowing his cheeks for that extra bit of suction, just to hear Harry's lovely moan. His hands, as Draco had instructed, found their way to platinum strands and twisted into them, steadying Draco's head with a slight sting. Draco let out a pleased hum around Harry that made his bony hips jump.
for support, just the most innocent of hands on the crook of Draco's arm, like he did with his friends. Draco wouldn't have minded. He might even have slid an arm around his waist, for the pure purpose of support.
His tone was soft, that usual stubborn edge dulled. It occurred to Draco that he’d never quite seen his work - the way his words, that wisk of his wand, had cut forever through Draco’s skin.
‘You kinda had it coming,’ Ginny remarked, at the same time as Harry uttered an amused ‘It was bloody daft, mate.’
It didn't take them much time to find Potter's group. Pansy, whose legs had been growing numb, demanded they go to the nearest pub and warm up. As they entered Hog's Head, a flare of familiar voices overcame them.
Harry laughed against his lips, a joyful little thing, arms winding around his neck to pull him closer.
Harry and he hung a bit back, in the edges of the group. It made Draco heady, knowing that Harry was choosing to stay behind with him, while his friends were just a few steps away. It made him feel like they were
‘D’you know,’ Harry said through a little smile once they’d parted, ‘They might still hate me anyway.’
Around the table, there was a shared intake of breath. Dean Thomas choked on his laughter; Ginny seemed distinctly uncomfortable; the others were a mix of surprised and curious. Harry, so preciously stubborn, did his best to look unaffected. Draco, however, could feel him tense against his side. Oh, and Draco loved the question, suspected Pansy had meant it as some sort of perverted gift, to feel Harry shift against him and know unequivocally that he was trying out scenarios of himself being fucked by Draco, or rather being the one fucking, and seeing which one he liked best… Merlin, and he
Harry rolled his eyes. He wasn’t shouting anymore, however. More a tone of exasperation. Like Draco was an
‘Squeeze me in, would you?’ he said, all wild eyes and red knuckles, and immediately forced his way to Draco’s side at the bar. Draco, who was still incredibly surprised, did little more than watch as his blood pooled rich and viscous in the cup of his hand. His lip had split, his cheekbone was tender - and pain, as it seemed, did nothing to relieve him, since his mind orbited obediently to Harry, to his fractured arm, to the purple marks littering his body.
‘Oh, come on,’ Harry smirked. He was already searching for a pair of combustion spoons. ‘We’ll do it like a shot. About the same thing in the end, ain’t it?’
Harry nodded, tapped him once above the sternum, this fond little thing before he stepped away. Their goodbyes were quick, Draco quietly debating whether he should kiss him goodbye until Harry, who was fussing with his shirt, flashed him a wave and scurried out the door before he could make a decision. With a sigh, Draco disenchanted the candles and left the classroom, making his way through the cold halls. It all felt colder now, lonelier with the memory of Harry’s skin still so present in his mind - and when he slipped into bed and idly trailed his fingers to the edges of the mattress, finding himself completely alone under suffocating sheets, he felt an overwhelming urge of sadness, a pang of despair, frightening in its intensity, like he’d never be able to sleep again unless he walked right up to Gryffindor’s dorms and tucked himself around the soft curve of Harry’s sleeping form, gently kissing him on the nape as a proper goodbye.
Pike nodded absently. He was fiddling with the sleeves of his cloak, which was a care he seldom took.
The Healer left the infirmary; the door swung close slowly, whining as it scratched on the stone. They were alone, and Harry was alright and Draco had been terribly afraid, and he wanted to gather him into his arms and feel his heartbeat against his ear. But Harry was angry and, even if he wasn’t, there was no reason he’d allow Draco to do that sort of thing. He hadn’t spoken of last night, nothing but lighthearted mentions. Maybe that’s all it had been: some impulsive episode to joke about in the most abstract of terms, never quite real, a drunken anecdote.
‘Well, it ought to just be weaker now it’s burnt. Shall we taste it and see?’ Harry craned his neck to look up at him. The beginnings of a joke, devious and dangerous, were twinkling in his eyes.
'We should make good use of the bed,' Harry's smile turned devilish, eyes blown black. 'I want you to fuck me.'
Draco huffed a laugh, releasing the reddened flesh from between his teeth and starting to walk them to the pedestal sink. Harry had been right: it was a perfect height, right at Harry's hips, and Draco pushed him back firmly until his arse hit the edge.
He lasted for a few more lines of Longbottom’s lovesick wonderings before he stood, feigning nonchalance.
- Harry's hardness slid along his lips so nicely, a hot, solid weight on his tongue, salted and leaking, and his pale, jutted hips were already shaking, but he kept himself still against the cold tiles, letting Draco do as he wished, bob his head up and down and swirl his tongue over the slit and set up a lazy rhythm while he bit off desperate moans.
At first, Harry’s features were closed, dazed, impossible to read. Slowly, they gained colours and lines, the telltale crickling of a fire, and he smirked.
, verging on the side of him that loved the thrill of a dare, the unpredictability of it. Oh, and he had to say yes, he had to, for Draco would never be able to shake off the picture of him with red stained lips regardless, and it’d be much better for his day to day focus if he could actually
Draco knew he ought to be understanding in his answer. It was an incurable symptom of fame to crave discretion - he couldn’t blame Harry, the Boy Who Lived, for suffering from it. Oh, and he actually feared he wouldn’t mind a life inside closets and under beds, nestled between shoe boxes, if only Harry took him out every so often and kissed him. But he wanted more, and he wanted to say so selfishly. He wanted all the pretentious pomp of official relationships; he wanted to kiss Harry in the Great Hall; he wanted their fingers entwined in the bloody Daily Prophet.
'Of course we do,' Pansy replied easily. They'd actually bought the butterbeer as a fleeting nod to sobriety, but Draco supposed this olive branch, given by perhaps the purest and most virtuous of Potter's group, could not be wasted.
Harry bit his lip to stop from grinning, and stood himself so Draco could slide out. Draco turned, meaning to hand out some half-hearted complaint, but Harry had already plastered himself to Ron’s side, in Draco’s old seat, immersed in the game.
night?’ he tapped the box of treacle tarts in Draco’s hand, ‘Or the night you lied about being there at all?’
Outside, in the icy street, Draco recognized all the usual members of Harry’s group. They were scattered, shivering in the cold, Luna and Sue closest to the door while the others stood a bit farther, forming tight circles with their arms linked and their hands in their pockets.
‘Cowardice and care are two very different things,’ Draco muttered, but he laid down on the ungodly thing all the same. It felt to him like a thick layer of dirt was already sticking to the back of his neck - the sense of discomfort took hold of him, thus it was only a moment later that he realized he was effectively sharing a bed with Harry, arm to arm, laid out so they could easily face each other and share a breath, a perfect picture Draco could tweak and twist until it depicted lovers on a winter night. The thought rose colour to his cheeks. Alcohol, that’s what he needed. Even that damned rum: it surely couldn’t be as sickly sweet as his fantasies.
‘Of course it fucking is!’ he shouted. ‘You damn Gryffindors always think being reckless is a point of honour. It’s not a quality, Granger, it’s a bloody birth defect.’
about marriage. With a small, reverent exhale of breath, he slipped into bed besides Harry, pushing the warm covers over him. He settled on his back, all muscles tense, trying to take as little space as possible, just like a little kid promising to be still so their mother doesn’t shoo them away. Harry let him adjust with a quirked eyebrow that looked entirely too amused, then moved himself, first the gentlest pressure of his leg against Draco’s, then an arm around his middle, finally his cheek right over his heart. All fluid, silent, like they did it all the time.
Harry's laugh was surprised, and wasn't that its own type of heartbreaking? Like no one had told him his life wasn't the norm - like he hadn't been
She hadn't even looked up at Potter before reciting some vague answer. If he'd asked Draco, he wouldn't have minded leaving his own brew alone for a second and personally analyzing Potter's potion. If he'd just
‘If you hadn’t hidden it, we wouldn’t be as curious,’ Blaise said, all faux reason, a small smirk betraying his amusement.
It felt so peaceful - that was the problem. Decadent, to have Harry so close and soft. And the potion still ached inside him, and humour brought forth the curse of recklessness, of impulsive honesty - because it felt funny now, all that had ever tormented him, and jokes were meant to be
‘Sorry, mate, came in through the Quidditch cave,’ he said. When he finally looked up at Draco, his eyes brightened. ‘Hey.’
Draco huffed, and took another sip of his drink. ‘Go ahead, then. But don’t think you’re off the hook.’
'Fuck, Malfoy,' Harry breathed, trying not to buck his hips and further the careful stimulation, 'Will you fucking- go faster, will you?'
Pansy's lips curved into an amused smile. Behind her, the door opened, and there was a growing of voices as more people filtered in.
Draco clenched  his teeth. He supposed the words were meant as a friendly gesture, but they only brought him a sour anger. They went under an archway, crossed a corner, caught one of the moving staircases as it was sliding along the ledge. Most students were at the Great Hall eating right about then; Draco wondered if Hermione had sneaked out just to find him.
‘Nothing, Tracey,’ Draco answered in an appeasing tone. Tracey, Blaise and Rowena had reached them now, identically dangerous smiles flashing shiny canines, heads tilted, a trio of sharks sniffing for blood. Looking to make it pour. Romance did always bleed so prettily. ‘I’m surprised you came back. I was sure you two would be off in a corner somewhere attached by the mouth.’
Draco scoffed. ‘That’s for him to find out, isn’t it? That is, if you’ll actually let me pass before he’s discharged.’
, looking up so fucking lovingly - he knew he had, it wasn’t like he was able to stop it when Harry was looking like
Pike chuckled, tucked into Blaise’s lean figure. ‘I don’t mind. I find her a bit tiresome as well, to be honest. Figure she’ll make quite the pair with Zabini.’
‘Yeah,’ Harry prolonged the word. Draco wondered if Seamus would be able to hear the hint of nervousness in it. ‘You know how I get when I drink too much.’
Draco relented, easing the suction with one last kiss before pulling away to admire his work. The bud was shiny with saliva, swollen and red, so sensitive it seemed to quiver in the air. Draco felt entirely too proud, and his smile was dark as he mouthed at the skin around Harry's other nipple.
be bothered, if he let himself. Could feel the simmering of shame at Blaise’s words. Mainly, though, prominent in the part of him that cared little for dignity and lived on Harry’s smiles, there was only blinding love and simple pride.
When Harry stared up at him, his lips twisted into something mocking. ‘Haven’t you heard? I’m the Boy Who Lived.’
to understand. That he loved Harry Potter, and that, in this damning, miserable fact, he wasn't alone.
Pansy’s laugh was unfairly levelled for someone who’d drunk so much the night before. Perhaps she hadn’t drunk. No, she most likely hadn’t - how could she, when Draco had drunk all the alcohol in the entire bloody village?
Every single moment of the year, it was a cacophony of overly pompous frails and kitch, grandiloquent laces, but in the
The thought made all potential friendliness disappear. He picked up the rest of his books, glancing curtly at him.
'Yes, but you are competing against no one,' Harry said, amused and unimpressed - and then, because he truly was the Gryffindor of the two of them, all unashamed impulse and unbridled bravery, he pulled Draco closer by the open edges of his shirt and kissed him again, nibbling lazily at his bottom lip.
He walked right up to them, in the Great Hall no less, by the bustling Gryffindor table, touched Harry’s arm and spoke:
Pansy laughed, which Draco admitted was quite justified. He truly was pitiful in how predictable his concerns were.
‘You’re a cruel woman,’ he said, though his eyes were unwittingly fond, and he took two big sips of the crimson alcohol.
Harry impatiently picked a bean - wet dirt, it turned out - and drank his shot without batting an eye. The game progressed. Harry jabbed him in the thigh.
‘Yes,’ he answered after a pause, and it was clipped, reluctant, like he wanted to say more. In the end, however, the word hung alone in the wind.
‘Can I go next?’ it was Neville asking, and Ginny bumped him on the side encouragingly. ‘Never have I ever given a blowjob.’
him, and Draco reckoned that it was only fair that he’d be allowed to speak a bit more plainly, to just hint at the suggestion, to implant the idea in Harry’s mind, because Harry seemed, in that moment - though it might just be the lighting, and the alcohol, and the conversation - almost
‘Come on, then. We’re headed to the first floor,’ Ron said at last. Seamus huffed a laugh, and they both started around the corner.
‘McGonagall doesn’t tell us anything for Transfiguration,’ Harry countered, eyes flashing between anger and disbelief.
- he sucked another one on Harry's other cheek, then trailed down the cleft with his tongue, steadying Harry's hip when he instinctively flinched away.
Harry bumped Neville's side softly. 'They were Snape's potions, but Slughorn must not have moved them.'
Not that it lasted long. No, because his body could be quite slow to get on with things, but his mind certainly hurried - sharpened, as it were, and decided, without seeking consultation, to pin on Harry in a tangle of those previous wonderings: what was he doing? where was he? how did he feel?
‘Do you know everything in this bloody castle?’ Draco huffed as he collected them. Figures he wouldn’t be able to prove himself to Potter. Now he just looked like a useless fool.
it. It couldn’t have been a fantasy - in them, it never felt as good, and Harry always loved him back. If Harry had liked him before - as a friend, as a partner, as a warm mouth, Draco wouldn’t complain - perhaps not all was lost. Of course resent would linger, the side effect of pain. Eventually, however, the bruises would fade, the fractures would heal, and with this soreness so too would his grudge disappear, and their friendship, with a bit of effort, would hopefully reform. Draco could be patient - surely it wouldn’t take long.
Harry picked up their discarded robes and opened the door, head primly leaned down, eyes on the floor. There was a row of men around it, tall, clad in black and staring with drunken eyes.
‘What the actual hell do I do, Malfoy?’ Harry asked, a soft laugh escaping him. The way his eyelashes fluttered as he looked up at him - so trusting, so lovely - made Draco’s cock twitch in his hand. And he’d like to instruct him, to guide him through it with gentle words and clear sentences, but he was pretty sure that verbalizing any of his thoughts - ‘Lick my cock, Harry’ - would make him come on the spot.
‘Guess now I know you really do mean it when you say that,’ Harry snorted. He seemed more amused than insulted, and it made Draco smile. ‘I have another question.’
He stood by the door until Potter was done, shifting his weight impatiently from foot to foot. More than once, he was tempted to leave - he could preserve the exchange just as it had been, lovely and unspoiled, and not risk ruining it with further words. Still, he couldn't bring himself to go, not only because it seemed, at that moment, so very easy to pretend like he was Potter's friend, but also because Potter's words nagged him, a reminder of his past cowardness. He wouldn't leave this time.
?’ Harry teased the name - and really, lit in red, his eyes twinkling with challenge, he was irresistible.
After Charms he had a free hour. The rain was loud against his umbrella as he hurried down through the slippery paths to the greenhouses. By the pots of Mandragoras that were growing for the second years, Draco unearthed a book from his bag and settled down to read. Even through the glass he could feel the gusts of wind against his back; could hear the drops heavy on the tilted roof, the frequent rustling of tree branches on the panels.
And the confession washed over him in dense, breathless darkness, and he was nothing but a Malfoy, black and perverse, faceless, evil, no first name.
Harry smiled - not an amused smile, something serious in its happiness, in the brightness of his eyes - and kept his hand warm and sure on Draco’s nape to pull him even closer, their lips grazing together.
‘Proud of that one, are you, Weasley?’ Draco crossed his arms, kicking at the grass. His head was still aching, a stinging constriction between his eyes; around them, Slytherins and Gryffindors were shouting, exchanging brief words, starting to gather around for the start of the game in deafening noise. He focused on Harry again, urgency in his tone. ‘Sit this one out, Potter. For fuck’s sake, you know you should.’
'I'm going,' he uttered, even though he was firmly rooted to the ground, and the crowd was so dense around him he couldn't move, and all he could do was search in a frenzy for that familiar - fucking
Harry shook his head, biting away a smile. ‘It’s not that interesting a story. Besides, isn’t it my turn to ask a question?’
‘It’s bloody not,’ Draco glared. He’d been obsessing over that question since friday; dreaming of it for years. ‘Merlin, Potter, I thought you’d like me asking for consent.’
Was that what he was? A dark root in Harry’s life? As sharp and cold as Ron saw him? He never quite felt like it - no, for years he’d strived to hide the softness inside him. Perhaps he’d buried it so deep that it’d decomposed. Harry deserved more than that. He deserved care unparalleled and unafraid. The simple love of someone who’s never had to hide it. Someone who’d never hurt him. Someone who deserved him.
'Just the helmet,' he tried, but his voice ran unsteady, and he brought a hand to his forehead. 'Bloody hell, I threw it into the Potions classroom, didn't I?'
, he’d finish his rounds at the end with his irises swirling in his eyes, his feet crisscrossing on the dirty floorboards of the pub.
Hermione frowned, and Draco thought he might have gone too far, strayed too much from safe politeness, and he was readying himself for his
Harry helped by absent-mindedly creating a pile - untidy, using the smallest books as a base, because he truly had no concept of order. Draco, on his part, left his chair to sit on the desk behind him instead, crossing his arms as he watched the others slowly filter out the room. When they were finally alone, Harry spoke:
‘I’m glad you came,’ Harry said, incredibly genuine, the type of sweetness Draco wanted spilled directly into his lips.
‘Does he? Ron and I thought he’d been getting better. Do you know Leanne? Harry was talking of asking her out.’
‘We’re not,’ Neville chimed in; he’d started with a burst of confidence, and trailed out into a self-conscious chuckle, ‘I’m a virgin. Just know things, you know… people talk.’
happened. Just an inconvenience. Granger was a stickler: she wouldn’t break her promise. He’d trust her. It was alright. All he had to do was slip back into the crowd and leave, get back to Hogwarts and get a good night’s sleep.
,’ she jerked her head back, at the door - and Draco was so fearful of what was beyond it, how hurt Harry was, how bad
,’ Draco repeated. Harry broke into a disbelieving laugh. It made Draco shift in his seat. ‘You already knew I never hated you, and that I found you handsome. When did you think I started fancying you?’
And he’d asked it in a taunting tone, but the very thought of it made him falter. Harry on his knees for him: he didn’t really know if he could cope.
Snape's old storage room was around the corner, easy to spot between the luxurious tapestries. Draco stood in front of it, staring at the dark wood of the door pensively, and tipped the bottle against his lips. He recognized the taste immediately - it was the American liquor Harry had ordered for them, the one that had been burning in his throat while he watched Harry leave him for the dancefloor.
. Open and vulnerable and trembling in nothing but that obscenely red lipstick, trusting Draco to take care of him - because he did, didn't he? He'd said he was the only one who could fix his hair, and it had spoken so much of permanence, of
The stairs Draco was on slid against the Fat Lady platform; Ron moved to get on them, but Draco stepped up first and stilled him with a hand on his chest.
‘Really, Potter?’ he said, aiming for amused. Harry actually had the nerve of pretending he hadn’t heard him. It made something panicked and fearful twist inside Draco.
This feeling of inadequacy only lasted so long. Hermione, not making any mention of his sudden appearance, handed him a bottle of Wizard’s Brew to place over his bruising cheek. Sue complimented Finnigan’s technique, someone else asked her what she was on about, the story spread. Spinnet asked him if it hurt, Draco answered ‘Of course it bloody hurts,’ and his voice echoed so clearly that it was impossible for anyone to have missed it. They knew he was there. He faded back into silence, but their words weren’t blurry any longer. He was no passerby.
He could always leave. The first glimpse he got of Harry - of his smiles and humoured eyes and fading bruises - if he couldn’t bear it, he’d leave.
Draco laughed as well, exclusively because of the neon liquid. He felt sour inside. Shaken by danger that had never been. He ran a gentle hand up and down Harry’s back and tried to keep his voice some semblance of steady when he spoke.
But Harry didn’t leave. Though his fists were clenched, and he was glancing out the greenhouse door every so often, and he was surely so uncomfortable in his wet clothes - and Draco, in a surge of weakness, wanted to take them
'I knew you fancied him,' Pansy said then, running one manicured finger through the brim of her glass, 'Not that you loved him. When did that start?'
Sue and Dean Thomas seemed fine with the situation; moreover, they spoke like it was a regular occurrence. Draco himself had no quandaries with the decrepit house. He did steal a look at Harry, though, over the heads of the others: he'd thought his godfather had taken residence in that place before he’d been killed. But Harry was still immersed in his conversation with Neville, and when they finally reached the house Ron forced the door open with a practiced gesture and they all filtered in, Harry included, without so much as a pause at the threshold.
Harry simply laughed again, unbothered, eyes bright - when he stopped, his lips pressed into the softest of smiles, a type of fondness that caught Draco’s breath.
He realized - with a violent pain flashing through his head and a growing urge to vomit - that he ought to start looking for the Snitch as well.
Draco nodded. Neville’s words, even in the haphazard way they’d been spoken, rose something solemn and grateful in him. A foreign sense of relief, a bashful hope for acceptance.
‘I always want you to say please,’ he said, voice painfully tight. ‘Right now, though, I just want to talk about it.’
He’d dug feet into cobblestone and spied on Harry’s little group from the narrow windows of those pubs. He’d watched Harry’s smile, the dip of his throat as he drank, the way he slipped friendly arms over his friends and swayed his hips on the dancefloor. He’d looked as wistfully as one reads a magnificent book, certain that he’d never become its character.
, even in this ridiculous situation; bloody perfect as he let Draco control the rhythm, intoxicating in the myriad of little sounds he let out: from ragged breaths to groans and the most precious high-pitched moans, and the occasional slip of a 'Malfoy' that sounded so sweet to Draco's ears.
And what could Draco say to that, what words could he string along as a reply, when he knew his voice would falter so pathetically? No, he’d save Harry from hearing that - Harry who was looking at him with eyes so fond, so sure, so
Harry was only tipsy that night - that was the first one. He’d told Draco that they should do it again. Kiss again, fuck again, Draco didn’t care for the specifics. That was fact number two. Ron knew. He’d seen it and looked properly disapproving and ran off. Harry hadn’t cared: he’d kissed him despite it. Numbers three and four, respectively.
'Take off your fucking clothes,' he said, red lips grazing his, hands already tugging at his suit jacket. Draco made quick work of it, infernally hot as he was, suddenly desperate to feel Harry's skin against his. They both worked on his shirt, Harry threw it to the pile on the floor and went for his slacks.
‘If you weren’t so bloody stupid, you would have been a great Slytherin, Potter,’ he said, because every other response he could think of was something undignified and downright needy, and Draco was not stooping to that level. He did, however, beckon Harry to the side with an impatient, slightly shaking hand. ‘Well, are you going to let me stand or not?’
He tilted Harry's hips up, kneaded both arsecheeks with thumbs digging into the plump flesh - and bloody hell, he'd stared at that arse for
‘Not that you’d know, Potter,’ he said, and his tone had gone a bit lower, because that conversation at least would be for both of them only, and his lips were twitching into a smirk. ‘But sex is one of those things you make time for.’
And that pretty fire of anger and despair was so delightful that Draco considered keeping him there a bit longer, shuddering in the cold air as he waited to be touched, but then Harry - because he was heartless, soulless, because he wanted to
-, the limber fit that had endured so much and was yet so fragile, lean and small, perfect to be held; and then that fire, paradoxical with his appearance, fueling his spirit into a restless frenzy; that drive to fight for what was right, that little smirk from jokes in his own head, that kindness he’d never learnt how to shield; strength and vulnerability more virtuous than in any other soul; and that laugh, when he laughed free and private; and the little moans that spilled from his lips, when someone kissed him right… Draco reckoned he’d fit anyone’s taste.
Draco only hummed, but he did replace Harry's hand with his, firmly encircling the shaft and giving it an indulgent tug.
. Black hair, pale skin flushed rosy from the dancing, lips a deep scarlet - like the princess from that Muggle fairytale, but without the dress, no, with a fitting suit instead, black and lean and so suggestive of the lovely skin underneath, just begging Draco to peel it off, to fold it neatly beside Harry's bed, to spread him out over linen covers and suck and bite every inch of skin until it was as red as his lips.
‘If you and Harry really are an item,’ Neville began, ‘Was it really a coincidence that Harry found that book yesterday?’
new was this kind of proximity to Harry, friendly and lighthearted, without any urgency or alcohol or lily-white confidence from the moon.
Then again, Draco hadn’t been much concerned about Harry’s self-respect when he was blowing him in the stall.
. He'd just tired of staying in the common room all night, wondering how many people had gone to Hogsmeade, how many hangovers he'd see plastered on dehydrated faces the morning after, how many mistakes were being committed under the guise of cheap alcohol - picturing who was drunkenly grinding against whom; who was hooking up with people they'd never even
Harry, who had seemed to be weighing his choices, ended up tilting his chin up in that daring way that was so characteristic of him - that Draco had seen countlessly, with soft eyes, from across the room, for years.
They were vague words, yes. Harry’s eyes, brimming with fondness - and how strange was it still that it was directed at
Surprised at the words, Draco thought back to the game - the ruthless wind, the blur of colours as chasers and beaters zoomed by, Harry sitting precariously on his broom, one arm curled into his chest like a wounded wing. Thought of the times he’d
With that thought in mind, he was about to retreat into the common room again, letting the two drunk boys go on with their undoubtedly terrible plan while he wallowed in peace, when Harry’s words resurfaced wicked in his head: uptight, he’d been called. Uptight, which was to say the polar opposite of Potter - spontaneous and brave and fun.
‘Thanks, Malfoy,’ he said, and skittered out the corridor, towards the counter. Draco stood there a little while longer, willing his heartbeat to slow. His father had always said he was terrible at hiding his nerves: trembling, thrumming with fright when the Death Eaters met, when Voldemort entered the room, when he was assigned a task. Too emotional - that’s why he always failed.
Such was the thing with alcohol - even Granger, so contrite in her sharing when sober, was rendered generous and carefree. And Draco knew he’d deserved it, he’d asked for it, he’d
‘Ron, mate,’ Harry whined, bending forward so he could stare at the ginger on the other side of Draco. ‘I know we defeated Voldemort together, but we’re hardly close enough for
And then he had Draco's cock in his hand, twitchy fingers stroking it firmly, fingertips grazing his balls - and he angled it just right, gripping the base and taking the head into his mouth to suckle on it for a couple of seconds before he was venturing further, opening wider, welcoming half of Draco's cock inside.
‘Malfoy, just… Thanks, yeah? But we’re fine,’ Harry spoke at last. He’d probably meant it to be appeasing, but to Draco it just sounded like a dismissal, and his blood boiled.
'Not on purpose,' he licked his lips, looking devious, 'It tastes bloody awful, I don't know why you put up with it.'
She meant it, Draco could hear it in her voice. It didn’t ease him, however; it made it worse, because now she surely knew, he’d vanquished any doubts she might have. She knew,
been too much. Draco felt tired. Dangerously about to retch, heavy-lidded and slow moving. And everyone else still teetered on the risky edge of fun, the phase of alcohol that’s so
‘I was actually worried you’d hurt yourself,’ Harry rolled his eyes, ‘But if you want to be a tosser about it, then sure. Suck me off, Malfoy.’
Hermione was leaning against the doorframe. She looked angry again. Perhaps she wasn’t, and Draco was simply poor at reading her.
‘I didn’t want to be obvious,’ she answered and, bringing her hand to her hair, pulling just slightly, with an utterly indifferent look on her face, she detached her head from her neck - not completely, no, a little inch of muscle connected chin to neck, but the rest was cut off bone and dark-blooded flesh, only the slightest glint betraying the Charm. ‘Nearly Headless Nick is as much Gryffindor as gold and scarlet.’
we doing anyway?’ Harry asked. He wasn’t even looking at Draco when he spoke - he’d given up on the hope that Draco would tell him.
Harry laughed at that, though it was a soft sound. ‘I would, if you asked me,’ he said. He turned serious then, the subtlest change, a tweak in his jaw. ‘Where do you want me to be?’
'You're very impatient,' he said as he kneeled on the bed, hands on each side of Harry's shoulders so he could lower himself and properly feel the warmth of his chest. 'Should I take that as a compliment?'
Contrary to how it might look, this is not going to unleash 20.000 words of angst or some shit, so no one worry, fluff is imminent!
‘We all left after the sun rose. It looks quite beautiful from the Shrieking Shack, did you know? A shame you didn’t see it.’
'Are you tasting yourself on me, Potter?' Draco asked, cursing the obvious wantonness in his tone. He felt Harry's smile against his mouth.
The gentle ease that had been reigning inside him, coloured firewhiskey crimson, evaporated. Sunk right through his esophagus, weighing impossibly in his stomach, the memory of Harry spiraling towards the grass. Some sort of bitterness must have shown on his face, for the table quieted.
‘We don’t expect you to either,’ Harry replied, his eyes landing on Draco for a second with a hint of challenge - like he
‘Because you hated me,’ Draco shrugged. He took another sip of the blasted drink as an excuse to look away from him.
‘Oh, sod off,’ snorted Harry. He downed his shot all the same, throat bobbing so beautifully as he swallowed the nasty green fluid, peeking his tongue out to lick his liquor-slick lips in a way that was undeniably
‘Merlin, Malfoy, I was just asking,’ Harry turned his back on the mirror so he could properly look at Draco. ‘D’you apologize to Hermione then?’
told him once, when the Alihotsy had made everything so hedonistic pink, and he wouldn’t tell him again, not for a while, certainly not there.
- I mean, he doesn’t… He deserves someone with his particular brand of idiocy, alright?’ he said, but his words had trailed off into something defeated, something
…' he chuckled, bold fingers creeping down to cup Harry's cock. He gave it a vicious squeeze, and bit off a grunt at the sheer
‘Sickles on the bar, mates!’ came Ron’s voice, loud and excited. The rest of the group was moving towards them, huddled together to take up as little space as possible. ‘We’re all having a shot before we go.’
‘It’s the second time you’ve bought me these,’ Harry remarked. Color had risen back to his cheeks, and he sat up straighter, smiling, holding onto the sickly treat with his bruised arm.
She raised an eyebrow, but didn’t comment. The pause between them unfolded tense and antagonistic. She didn’t seem much eager to leave her spot in front of the door - the argument hadn’t repaired her opinion of him, only given it, at most, a dissuading sort of pity. Draco, on the other hand, was resolute to get inside and visit Harry. An itch was growing in him, insidious in the back of his eyes, tormenting his focus, so he could only think of finally seeing Harry: and they had no sense nor cohesion, these pictures, only scattered, impossible little things. He saw himself apologizing on his knees; Harry bruised an unsightly purple; Draco pressing his lips ever so lightly over the burst capillaries; Harry screaming at him; Harry
… then Harry, paradoxical in nature, caught him by the shoulder and kissed him lightly. ‘We really should do this again. You know, when we’re actually alone.’
Yes,’ he tried a disconcerted smile, then turned pensive, then looked as though he’d figured out a difficult puzzle. ‘You did chase each other a lot when you were young, didn’t you? Always spying on each other… yes, makes sense, really. It’s what we did in my time, did you know? Chase each other,
Potter straightened at once, shook his head a little as if the position didn’t suit him, and then promptly toppled towards Draco, head hitting his shoulder, their sides impossibly squeezed together in the narrow stairwell. It almost felt indecent; Draco could feel the beginnings of a blush prickling his skin, all because Potter was leaning against him, linking arms with him,
‘I fell.’ Draco said, retrieving his coat from the stool he’d been sitting in. It should at least cover some of the blood stains. ‘I’m off. Have fun in whatever strange threesome this is.’
Draco snorted. Drinks poured, he took a sip of his. The froth was bitter in his tongue. He regretted having bought it, should have stopped drinking after those blasted shots, but there was something about those nights that made him reckless.
‘Fuck,’ Draco moaned. Harry had the audacity to look smug, so Draco squeezed both his nipples at the same time - a bit viciously, but the twat deserved it -, earning him an actual goddamn
Draco bristled - and even her eyes, calm and resolute as they were, inspired in him no sympathy. He turned and kept walking. Hermione strode until she was beside him.
The corner of Harry’s mouth tweaked into a smirk. ‘A’ight, but it’s not my fault if you fall over. Oy! Four shots of lobe-blaster, please!’
The tea came in two light blue mugs, steam charged with a warm, herbal fragrance. It was a nice distraction: Harry’s eyes had gone very wide behind his glasses, his lips twitching into a smile that didn’t quite come to be.
The night felt incredibly cold in comparison to the overheated bathroom. Much quieter too. No expectant buzzing in their ears, no ringing, no blood rushing.
They knew, he’d realized. From the first row on the stands, it would have been obvious that Draco had pushed Harry. Invisible had been the terror inside him, the crushing concern, the blind, frantic urge to help - no, all they’d seen had been their bodies colliding. Harry crashing into a cloud of dirt. They ought to think him mental - Draco bet they’d be quick to let the entire school know the rotten, pathetic Draco Malfoy had not truly changed nor found redemption inside the Golden Boy’s intimate circle; rather, he’d wormed himself between them, then thrown Harry off his bloody broom.
‘It’s fine, Goyle,’ Draco huffed, voice slightly shaking - they were high up now, and the wind was wisping ice cold under his shirt. ‘I’ll get us the Snitch. Just… don’t send any more Bludgers Potter’s way, alright?’
, to Harry had been nothing but unremarkable conversations; and that slow, honey-sweet moment where Harry had been close enough to kiss, and looking not exactly like he wanted it but like he was at least
'Don't be ridiculous, Pansy,' Draco rolled his eyes, 'I simply don't understand why he's decided to make friends with absolutely
‘Nothing too strong, aye?’ Draco managed to say, though he’d twisted his voice into a parody of his own, all soft and rounded.
‘I… What?’ Draco uttered, and then trailed his eyes to the table, to that spot Harry had glanced at before, and he saw Hermione sliding through the seats, moving to stand. When he turned back to Harry their closeness was gone, and Harry was leaning back with an offensively proud look on his face.
He waited stubbornly inside the train until the herds of students had wandered off the platform, scattering across the glistening white streets. He didn't see Potter, but he did catch the fiery head of a Weasley skittering off to the right.
‘Would you quit whining? I’ll stop in a minute,’ Draco dismissed, still tracing the fabric over his cock. Harry twitched in overstimulation and Draco smirked, pressing a kiss to the shell of his ear. ‘You
'Yes,' he said, a low, sickeningly tender word to summarize his thoughts; a kiss to Harry's forehead to go with it. 'Mostly kiss you.'
, searching for the pesky, cruel Snitch, but an idle thought would linger in each of them, and they’d glance at each other now and then, and they’d
Still, he wondered when that voice would finally leave. Certainly Potter's group wouldn't stay long - they'd ask for their shots and go on their merry way, each of them blissfully drunk, stumbling, giggling, holding onto each other with thoughtless,
Draco huffed, though he stepped in all the same. A tight, painful knot of anxiety inflated at the base of his throat as the door swung closed behind them.
‘You talk so much, Blaise,’ Pansy sighed. 'Why is it that you never say anything worthwhile? Draco, my hair.’
Harry obliged, though somewhat hesitantly. Draco swiftly brought them into the right position, shaping Harry’s body to mold his, chin tilted up, back primly straight, and then he led them away, small steps amidst the swirls of ghosts and Slytherins around them.
'Because you were insufferable, that's why,' Draco snapped, and it was true, in a sense: unbearable in this chaos Draco could only covet from afar; infuriating in this jumble of limbs he wanted to touch for
The words eased a dull, regretful weight inside of Draco - with Harry’s forgiveness his guilt dissolved, leaving nothing but a spotty soreness and the occasional fit of panic when wind wisped too close to his ear. With tentative steps, Draco took a seat beside him. Harry lifted an appraising eyebrow, then promptly laid down with a sigh.
Harry shimmied up until Draco could see his entire head, clumsily propped on his pillow, hair tousled and skin pink. He wasn’t wearing glasses. It was frighteningly endearing. ‘Shouldn’t I be the one asking you that?’
The rest of the day was an agony of expectation. Time dripped too slow; the sun, surely in some stubborn fit, refused to go down. He finished his book, then had to reread the pages, having realized that he’d barely paid mind to the ending. When the night finally came, he’d gotten himself into a fit of nerves - after all, this was the first time they’d do anything sober. There was a conscious difference between fooling around drunk in bathrooms and bloody abandoned houses, and meeting up in school without a drip of liquor. This was planned, and unignorable, and all too likely to go wrong.
Draco watched as various heads turned to each other in questioning, a succession of confirmations rippling through the crowd. No one asked them, nor had Draco assumed they would, and the decision was made in less than a minute.
People went beet red again. It was entertaining to watch, and Draco prided himself in not having to drink this round - unless Harry fucking Potter qualified as a fetish, he’d been pretty straightforward with the few partners he’d had. Not having to drink made it easier to take in the people who
‘Hey,’ Harry grinned, crooked, bloody adorable, and he tilted his head up to kiss him. A soft thing, and still the clatter from the tables - which was always so dreadfully loud, because no one had the smallest sense of table manners - fell completely from Draco’s ears. He heard the buzz of his own blood, and followed Harry’s lips when he pulled back, dazed, shocked, but Harry didn’t indulge him. He stayed out of reach, eyes twinkling, sinfully tempting, until the sounds from the Great Hall tuned up again.
‘Off to Honeydukes we go, then,’ Ron shouted, and the different little subgroups began their synchronized walk, turning left on the narrow, slippery cobblestone streets.
At least his question served as inspiration for the following ones. Everyone seemed entirely too amused with the prospect of discovering each others' kinks. When Harry and Finnigan returned, significantly giddier and redder in the face than before, they were still talking about it, and Draco couldn’t help but grin smugly after Harry sat beside him.
‘Well, it’d be a shame for you to fail the test after creating such lovely memories here,’ Draco mused, a tentative smile on his lips. Harry, to his relief, huffed a little laugh.
Draco should buy him a better coat. He could owl it to him, an anonymous parcel. Potter would most likely think it was by one of his enamoured fans.

There was a slim man there, the type of man that fades into walls, that passes unnoticed wherever he goes, and this same man was quick to bar the door when Draco moved to open it.
. Hated that young Slytherin thing that only listened to what his father wanted and his blood hissed and his insecure little mind urged. He was always so
‘Yeah,’ Harry drew an amused smile. Around him, a puddle had begun to form. ‘Think you can make it?’
Draco hummed, a very sudden - very inappropriate, for how crowded the pub was - spike of arousal stirring in his stomach, pooling amidst alcohol. ‘Well, you do. Bloody sinful. Though I’m sure you’ll be much worse when I
Harry was flushing a delightful shade of pink, and he rolled the sleeves of his white shirt with a frazzled, disbelieving laugh. He took another gulp of the firewhiskey, then said lowly, so only Draco could hear:
Draco rolled his eyes. The music figured to him very loud, though the Weird Sisters were more the soothing type, and it was slightly difficult to keep his head upright on his neck, and Draco really shouldn’t have taken on Potter’s dare.
'Oh, you're a fucking arsehole, Malfoy,' Harry said, but the angry tone was undercut by a laugh, then a downright sinful sound as Draco took his dick further in his mouth.

Draco smirked and shifted a little, moving so he was straddling Harry's hips, hands planted on his flushed stomach, arse pressing on his erection.
‘You said you hated rum,’ Sue called out. Draco didn’t bother answering; he left the living room through an archway from which dangled a series of spiderwebs. In the kitchen he procured a half empty bottle. He took the stairs up.
Everyone’s eyes flickered up to him. He pointedly ignored Hermione’s - he had yet to apologize to her - and stepped even closer to the scratched-up table. There was a gathering of cups at the center of it already.
and it could get difficult to balance schoolwork and war strategy - and yet it all seemed so small now, the exams, the classes, the occasional assignments, that it seemed more like an extended holiday - like the week before Christmas in a normal school year, when most students were home and only some filtered still through the halls, lazy, sleepy-eyed and uncaring.
been that amicable with him -, and she’d consent when he asked to leave, and they could return to Hogwarts and forget the whole night had ever happened. He’d sweep it out his mind, treasure the picture of Potter’s hand in the crook of his arm and be content with it, only with it, and try nothing else.
A week later, Draco had not forgotten his conversation with Pansy in the slightest. He'd mull it over while he walked in the corridors; he'd hear it murmured through his professors' voices when he got distracted; he'd be a second from sleep when Pansy's challenging stare would resurface in his mind and he'd stand in a jump. No, he hadn't forgotten, because it had never been in Draco's nature to let go of things - particularly when it came to Harry Potter.
Leanne. A whiny little girl, Katie Bell’s friend, an awkward face to see around the halls. The polar opposite of Ginny Weasley, all tame energy, crossed legs as she read in the grass, mediocre in every class, pretty smile but not
Not waiting for a response, she left the antechamber. Draco thought it fair. It pained him, however, to think Finnigan and Neville would be holding this grudge against him. He did still want to play nice with Harry’s friends, after all - at least if Harry still wanted him around.
And Draco, who’d been nurturing those words under his tongue for years, felt, as he spoke them properly for the first time, as if he was taking his first full breath in that school.
, had the oddest effect of at once tethering Draco to reality and utterly throwing him from it: because what was indeed happening was that, after years of pining and aching and repressing until his heart had gone rigid, Draco was in some sort of relationship with Harry fucking Potter, and able to talk about it with others, with his friends moreover; able to speak quiet and tender into Harry’s ear and have him tucked in the crook of his arm like he
‘I’d been thinking about how to tell them, you know,’ Harry said suddenly. ‘I just figured - I’ve never been good with words anyway.’
at it, at least. Pansy had spoken to Harry before, Crabbe and Goyle would likely be more awkward than anything else, and Pike seldom talked to his friends, let alone his friends’ partners. It was people like Blaise and Tracey that worried him - people with quick mouths and a vested interest in any romance that didn’t involve them. Those were frightening. Those had Draco convinced he wouldn’t survive the night.
'One I definitely don't regret,' Draco smiled as they neared the smooth wall that bore the Slytherin common entrance. 'Severus.'

a loo,' Draco trailed off to suck at a spot in Harry's neck, a pretty little place just over the collar, high enough that Harry wouldn't quite be able to cover it. He closed his teeth softly around it, eliciting a hiss from Harry - he hoped it bloomed deep red, so Harry could look at it the next morning and remember Draco's lips, and blush deep enough to match it. 'A good alcove would do, if you could be quiet.'
It honestly was no cause for disappointment. Still, because Draco had been, since the war, unbearably sentimental, he found himself disappointed. Potter was supposed to know Draco had been waiting for him - like a friend, like someone who
They tumbled onto the pavement in a poorly lit residential neighbourhood, and Draco barely remained standing as Potter crashed into him with his full weight.
“Okay,” he said. “So maybe calling this a D.A. meeting wasn’t exactly right. This is not about me teaching defence against the dark arts or anything-“
“Why are you telling him that?” snapped Draco. “How long do you think he’ll remember it? It’ll be gone an hour after we’re out of here. He’s dead – look at him, he’s fucking dead! We came all the way in here to talk to a corpse, and as soon as we walk back out all that shit you’re telling him will just seep away. He doesn’t even know who you are!”
He had been mentioning Draco often enough in his letters to the Weasleys, and he was sure Ron must have too ever since Draco had started spending time with them, but in truth it had taken him quite some time to work up the courage to tell them they were more than just friends. It had been agony waiting for a reply to that letter. Mrs Weasley had been very supportive, but Harry was still pretty nervous about introducing Draco to them, though he wasn’t about to let Draco know that.
The clack of his shoes on the marble floors echoed in the hall. He saw a sudden movement out of the corner of his eye and started, whirling around to see Harry standing up from where he had been sitting, on the staircase to the upper floors.
“But if the aurors say they saw us, we’ll probably be questioned, and the investigation will focus on people who might have been able to get a hold of hair from all of us. And even if they don’t suspect us, if they recognized Malfoy, that could be a problem…”
“You don’t look like you’re up for teaching me the patronus charm right now,” he said when the silence had stretched too long.
“There’s the silver lining I’ve been looking for,” she says, and then she is kissing him, and Harry is kissing her back, and for a moment she is the only thing in the world, and everything seems alright.
Draco smiled meekly at that and Pansy did too. He reached for her and pulled her into a hug. Her arms tightened around him immediately, reflexively. He held onto her and breathed in the familiar scent of her hair, felt the rhythm of her chest rising and falling against his, and the calm and safety that her closeness promised.
Draco grimaces, something between a grin and an eye roll, but he keeps his gaze fixed on the far corner of the room, as if turning his face away from Harry will keep him from noticing the tears in his eyes.
While one side gathers at Hogwarts to mourn, the other flocks to Malfoy Manor to celebrate. Draco doesn’t participate and no one notices – he’s not important anymore; it is suddenly painfully clear to him he never was. He roams the empty parts of his house, he feels anxiousness gnawing in his chest as he wonders what he should do next. Technically, he did betray the Dark Lord, and he tries not to think about what would happen to him if all the monsters and murderers in his house were to find out.
“We’re not in mortal danger yet, just planning to get there. If Hermione ever figures out what to do about the dementors. It’s driving her crazy.”
“No, you need to use fire to kill it properly. The hard part is getting to the roots without pulling them up, and I don’t think scissors would be a big help with that...”
He was only halfway asleep and it was only halfway a dream: the icy, feathery touch of Malfoy’s fingers on his skin. The strange look in his eyes when he leaned towards him. The soft press of his lips against Harry’s. The way the kiss had trickled through him. The violent burst of
It was slightly warmer inside, but only because there was no wind. They couldn’t risk casting their patronuses until they were inside the actual prison, so they walked in near darkness.
“Hermione’s right, you’ll be fine,” said Harry. “Ron and I have been giving regular reports on how much of an idiot you’ve been ever since first year, I’m sure by now actually talking to you can only improve their impression.”
But when they finally made their way onto the train, all of Pansy’s luggage included, it turned out that despite the number of people on the platform, the train was far from full. Even with the returning seventh years added to the pool of students, it didn’t make up for all the missing ones. Pansy told him they had reported it in the
For a moment he was at a loss for words. He wanted to pull out his wand and cast his patronus – that would prove how wrong she was about him. But she couldn’t cast the spell herself, so maybe she wouldn’t understand the significance of its shape. She wouldn’t know that the snake meant that he hadn’t turned his back on her or his name or his family, even after the Dark Lord had poisoned everything he thought he knew was right.
Malfoy hesitated. He looked back at Harry and the silence stretched between them, brittle and awkward. Harry noticed for the first time the way Malfoy had curled in on himself, how tense his shoulders seemed, and the answer was right there on his face. That it hadn't been a joke. Eight years of hatred seemed to hang suspended in the air, and Harry saw Draco's fingers curl seemingly unconsciously around the left sleeve of his coat. Then a car rushed past them on the street, bright headlights flashing over them, and the stillness broke. They both looked away quickly.
Ron pulled out mugs for both of them while Harry scraped eggs onto his plate. Ron cleared his throat.
Then he pulled out his wand and twirled it between his fingers for a while, already knowing which spell he was going to cast, but putting it off for no reason other than that it was slightly embarrassing even with no one there to see him.
Draco frowns. He picks up Harry’s hand. He looks repulsed. He swallows hard and Harry doesn’t really feel anything, he’s not even angry.
"Alright, so I think maybe that girl saw it? I think he had his sleeves pushed up when he handed her the cup, and then sort of pulled it back down when she was yelling. Oh, and she pointed a
This time it was after dinner on Saturday evening in the same secret room that they had used before. It was dark out and the glass in the windows was black and mirror-like. Draco had taken up a seat in the corner, sitting half in shadows. He spoke quietly and even breathed carefully, trying to take up as little space as possible. He tried to be polite enough for the both of them, because Pansy would bite back her venomous words when he had asked her to, but she would not apologize for her presence. If he wanted friendly cooperation, it was all on him.
“So should we get back to our common rooms?” he asked. “I’ll check if Pansy has killed anyone and you can go see if Granger still has her head or if Weasley has bitten it off.”
!” cried Ginny and the red light caught Pansy in the chest, throwing her off her feet next to Granger, the wand flying from her hand.
Maybe Potter noticed the look on his face – he let go of Draco’s arm and the smile faded a bit but did not go away.
It felt terribly wrong to go towards the source of the deadness and the cold instead of running away from it, to safety, but he made himself move forward, the others pushed through after him and Longbottom pulled the door shut behind them. They crowded onto the topmost gallery of the prison, all of them with their wands out, all of them facing the door, Draco's heart pounding hard in his chest. A second passed and then another, and no aurors burst through the door.
She nodded. Draco pulled out his wand and pointed it again to Hermione’s throat and then her chest, muttering the incantation.
She was speaking fast and excitedly. She had put the book down in front of them next to her sketches of the dementor’s possible area of influence, pointing to the pages from which she drew her points. To say that they had talked about all of this before was something of an overstatement. He vaguely remembered having glimpsed her sketches, but they definitely hadn’t pursued any of her ideas.
“Yeah. As far as I remember, that was right after you had been beating each other up in some classroom, and you also said that you’d never trust him again. Have you been confunded?”
And then, as soon as that thought manifested itself, it made sense, of course. That Draco would be odd in this world which he had, in fact, just dropped into.
They made their way through the dark, empty halls of the castle, which seemed bigger and colder this time of night.
“He might have been resistant to dementors,” said Malfoy hesitantly. “Some people are. That would explain how he was able to escape. Obsessive people are less receptive. As long as it’s not a happy thing, it gives them something to hold onto that the dementors can’t take away. There were some of the Death Eaters who went to Azkaban that definitely hadn’t been the Dark Lord’s most loyal servants when they were locked up. But they were different when they came back, and they were very… devoted.”
The anger he felt at that thought pounded through him like a fever, except it felt right and natural, and it was mending something inside of him that had been broken.
can apparate to “some stretch of the of coast of Great Britain from which it’s possible to reach Azkaban”?” said Hermione sharply.
He had gotten quite good at passing the time when he didn’t have anything to do. It was all about emptying your head, not thinking about anything. Except today it was very hard to make his head stay empty.
was the title of the first one. It had a picture of a light switch on it, the switch being flipped up and down and a light bulb going on and off next to it. The next one was
“Okay,” he said. “So when Malfoy found out he was going to Azkaban he decided to get drunk up in the astronomy tower – remember I mentioned that? He got his hands on some firewhisky, I’ve no idea how. And I was with him. He asked me to come, so I went up there. I got sort of drunk with him, and he erh… kissed me that time too. He said he was just fooling around, so I thought after today that maybe it was… the same thing. Maybe he’s just very casual about that sort of thing. Maybe it’s just something he does? I mean, I don’t actually know him very well...”
Harry kissed him again and Draco slid his fingers into his hair, clenching his fist in it and kissed him back. Harry pushed himself closer, and then Draco felt his hand on his thigh and everything he knew he had to say was pushed from his mind, because this was new, and he hadn’t admitted to himself exactly how much he wanted it or that it had any part in what he had meant when he told Harry he had missed him, but it did. He pressed himself against him and felt the hand move to his stomach, following its dip at Draco’s sharp intake of breath. He pulled back to catch his breath. Harry pushed his fingers between Draco’s shirt buttons and Draco had just leaned in for another kiss when someone cleared her throat.
They stopped when they were close enough to peer through the windows. There was hardly anyone inside.
The stone Gargoyle stepped aside and he walked past it unto a spiral staircase that carried him to the door of the headmistress’ office. He knocked and it swung open.
. Even if it wasn’t all his fault everything that happened, that doesn’t change what it’s done to him. There is nothing left in him that’s worth saving or forgiving.”
“Uh, I don’t know. I sort of wanted to spend some time with Hermione tonight, and she doesn’t like flying, so I doubt she’ll want to come. Maybe some other day?”
Ron stared at him disbelievingly and Harry looked away. He hadn’t wanted to tell Ron, but it had started to feel like a secret more than something he just hadn’t bothered to mention. And that just made it all worse, the kisses and the talks, made it feel much more illicit than it actually was. Luna had to be wrong, Harry had just misread the situation, and the only reason he felt bad about it was because he was keeping it from his friends. And the only reason he kept it from them was because he worried they would get angry, but it wasn’t like he had done anything wrong.
Draco was making his way to the owlery. A breath of cold air brushed against his skin as he reached the top of the stairs, the scent of coming winter was in the air and mixed with the smell of the owls. It was too dark to see any but the nearest birds, but the soft rustling of their feathers gave a sense of the hundreds of animals in the room. They swooped in and out the glassless windows, hunting on the Hogwarts grounds and returning with their prey. He crossed the straw-covered floor and headed towards one of the openings in the wall, an empty archway facing the lake. He had only just sat down on the ledge when he thought he heard the sound of footsteps. Someone else was coming up the stairs. He swore under his breath. Of course he didn’t expect to be the only one who had designated this particular corner of the school to be their place of privacy, but no one was supposed to be there now.
It wasn’t just him – Hogwarts was different this year. For one thing, the division of houses had weakened dramatically. Harry and his dorm mates all found seats at the Gryffindor table, but around them were just as many blue and yellow ties and badges as there were red. Many of them were former members of the Dumbledore’s Army that had reformed in his absence under the leadership of Ginny, Neville and Luna. Some of them were the same as when Harry had been leading the group, but many were new. There were kids from Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff whose names he wasn’t even sure of who were closer to Neville and Luna than Harry had ever been himself, and little kids who approached Ginny with things that Harry thought they should have gone to their prefects about, until he saw how familiar she was with them. He had been pretty surprised that Padma Patil had visited the Burrow while he stayed there over the summer, but apparently her and Ginny were friends. And now that people no longer cared so much about being seated according to housing, it seemed silly that they ever had. It had never been a rule that you had to sit at your house table except for the feasts at the beginning and end of the year, during the sorting and the announcement of the winners of the house-cup.
“I can’t say for sure,” he finished, “but it’s the only way it makes sense to me. It would also explain why there hasn’t been any public debate about removing the dementors even though they joined the Dark Lord during the war. The safest way to avoid any discussions of an uncomfortable issue would be if everyone agreed that it was fine as it was and nothing had to change, right? And as far as I know, it was a unanimous vote to keep them as guards of Azkaban. Unanimous votes don’t happen on the Wizengamot, so that in itself is a sign that something is wrong.”
When he was finally done, he felt completely drained. His feet were sore from standing up that long and it felt like he hadn't slept in a year just from keeping himself together. He dragged himself to the underground, wishing for the thousandth time that there were fewer restrictions on apparition in London. It was ridiculous how deep his gratitude was when he was lucky enough to get a seat on the train. He sank back, stared emptily ahead of him as the train shot through the tunnels hollowing the ground beneath London.
“What about you?” he asked, not because he actually wanted to know but because staring at Malfoy in awkward silence was actually worse than listening to him talk.
So she had seen them, then, she had just hoped he wouldn't. A second later, Blaise and Greg caught up with them.
When they read the charges, they mentioned that Malfoy had been on the run for a few weeks after the battle of Hogwarts, and that he had been kept in custody under dementor guards for a week before his trial. Harry knew well how hard dementors could affect you, but he hadn’t thought it was possible to physically wither away so quickly. The Malfoy he was seeing now in the Great Hall was miles from that figure – perhaps still thinner than he used to be, but nothing you would notice if you weren’t looking for it.
how to feel about it. And this was just… a free fall, a tumble of things that were completely out of his control. He wasn’t even sure whether to blame his house or his family for the fact that he had already envisioned every single possible scenario in which this could be used against him.
And here it was. He was going to burn to death. He tightened his grip on his wand, tried to recall the details of the wand movements, and all he could think about was how painful it would probably be, and that after that, there would be nothing. He didn’t want to die; he didn’t want to die here in the dark-
“Maybe not for you, but I have to watch you sucking up to him, and trust me, that is deeply unsettling. And you know it’s not going to work. He’s not going to forgive you, and you don’t need him to.”
“So what do you want me to do? Publicly declare that I was wrong all along and Draco Malfoy is actually a really nice bloke?”
“I hope you come to your senses soon,” he said. “As soon as this whole thing with Azkaban is over, I’d like it if we never have to deal with him again”
Harry explained. He walked Malfoy through the incantation, the wand-movement, both fairly simple, and Malfoy listened attentively and copied him easily. He didn’t protest at all until Harry started on the need to concentrate for single happy memory.
Draco wasn’t sure if Blaise even recognized the kid. He had probably never heard anything about her, but it didn’t matter. Pick a random student at Hogwarts and the odds were very high that Blaise’s accusations would be true. He flicked his wrist again, this time her
“Don’t!” he yelled, losing his balance in his hurry, stumbling into her and almost dropping his own wand as he dragged her arm down.
“There were enough people outside of Azkaban who were trying to kill me. I never felt the need to go check out the ones still in prison.”
He glanced over his shoulder towards the bar. It was getting crowded up there, there were a lot more people in the pub now. It might take a while for Mark and Draco to get back, and Harry felt strangely untethered without Draco there.
year, Draco would know where to go from here. They had an easy script back then, one that allowed for a simple way around all the things they don’t need to talk about.
Then she turned on her heel and the left the room, slamming the door behind her. Pansy stood frozen. She looked like she would curse the first thing that moved. Then she hissed something that sounded a lot like “Gryffindors”, before storming out the room just as Ginny had. When the door had slammed shut, Hermione let out a sigh and stood up.
"The problem, Potter, is that now they're going to send someone over to follow up on this. I'll have to deal with tons of bureaucracy, and they're pretty fucking uptight about the statute of secrecy these days."
That smirk – it really wasn’t a wonder that Harry had always suspected him of being up to something when the guy managed to look like a cat that had just devoured someone’s goldfish about eighty percent of the time he came close to smiling. Harry turned away so he wouldn’t have to look at him. It was good his control of the patronus was so secure now; he was pretty sure he wouldn’t have been able to focus enough to cast it with a smirking Malfoy in the room back when he was thirteen.
Draco didn’t take long to gather himself before he got out of bed. The others were probably still awake and would hear him leave, but that didn’t matter. He had asked them to leave him alone, so they would. Besides, in the wake of his nightmare, in comparison to Azkaban, everything to do with Slytherin and his reputation seemed utterly insignificant. He got dressed and left the dormitory as quietly as he could. He walked down the dark staircase and through the dim common room. There were movements in the shadows, and a house elf who hadn’t noticed him and remained absorbed in his work of polishing the dark wood of a coffee table. Draco strode past and out into the corridor.
Ron’s suspicions about Azkaban being what was bothering Hermione seemed to be confirmed when she, Harry, Ron, Ginny and Neville happened to get the common room to themselves for half an hour one evening. The number of meetings up in the secret room had thinned out over the last couple of weeks.
“No, I’m not,” he snarled. “What exactly do you think you’re doing? You won’t talk to me out in the corridor where someone might see you, but you still expect me to tell you all about what it was like to visit the wreck of my father in his prison cell?”
“Mr Malfoy,” she said quietly. “I have been a teacher for a very long time and I have taught hundreds of students over the years. I have talked to more students than you can imagine about worse things than you would like to think about. And I have gotten very good at noticing when something is wrong. Sometimes it’s something I can help with, and sometimes it’s something you can’t do anything about as a teacher. These last few years there have been way too many children that I couldn’t help, but that doesn’t mean I don’t try. And you might not consider yourself a child anymore, but you are still a student at Hogwarts, and as long as you are, it is my responsibility that you are safe and that you are well.”
“That’s because you and I have very different approaches to the purpose of making friends and going to school. My house mates are heirs to the houses of Zabini, Greengrass, Nott, Parkinson and Bulstrode, and since I am the heir to the house of Malfoy, I can’t just base my friendships on whether or not I like these people, since later in life, they will have to be my political allies or they will be my rivals. We all do better if we don’t fight each other, and it’s easier to be allies than friends. Did you honestly think it was a coincidence that every single major pureblood family has its oldest child in our year?”
"Harry who - wait, are you shitting-" the connection cut off, and then Harry was left standing there on Draco Malfoy's doorstep.
"Since they started jumping at every little chance they get to get me in trouble, Potter. I'm not exactly popular with them at the moment."
And at Hogwarts is Malfoy, who knows perfectly well that Harry isn’t crazy because his summer has been terrible too, though in other ways than Harry’s. He hasn’t been kept from anything, he is already hearing and seeing too much of what his parents have gotten into, the first Death Eaters frequenting his house, and where Harry’s wake-up call from childhood was Cedric’s death, Draco’s is seeing his parents scared and realizing that they are not as all-powerful as he has been allowed to believe for so long. Now he constantly overhears Lucius and Narcissa fighting, because things are different this time, Lucius’ high position with the ministry is useful to the dark lord, but he is also traitorous for having achieved it in his absence. Bellatrix is out of Azkaban, Draco has never met her, he doesn’t know what she is yet, only that she is his mother’s sister and that his parents are afraid of her.
“Remember how we talked about cutting the dementors off?” she said. “How they thrive on misery, so what would happen if you could keep them from feeding on anyone?”
They entered the Great Hall, and Draco halfway expected the aurors to be waiting for them right inside the doors. Or that the hall would fall quiet when they entered and everyone would turn to stare at them. No one did. No aurors rushed out to arrest them. They walked to the Slytherin table and sat down like they would on any other morning. Draco poured himself a cup of coffee. He kept an eye on the doors, and didn’t have to wait long before while, McGonagall and Sprout showed up. They looked a lot less grim than he thought they had outside. They didn’t even glance towards the Slytherin table.
Draco and Mark finally came back and Harry felt his shoulders drop in relief. He accepted his beer gratefully.
Harry slumps against the wall, heart thundering, his whole body feels electric, his fingers might be trembling. He watches as Malfoy pulls out his wand and locks the door before turning back to him. Malfoy’s face is flushed. He takes a step toward Harry, Harry leans in but Malfoy shoves him back, his hand flat on Harry’s chest, and about half of Harry’s excitement is pure adrenaline, because they didn’t use to lock the door, that was part of the game, and Harry was always the one who shoved. He can feel Malfoy’s breath on his face. Malfoy is looking down, eyes fixed on the hand on Harry’s chest that keeps him pressed back against the wall. His mouth is slightly open, Harry wants to kiss him again, which is weird now that he is so painfully aware that Draco shouldn’t be attractive. It’s something he’s been trying to focus on all year, looking for everything ugly about Malfoy, all the marks of his desperation; his sleep deprived eyes, hollowing cheeks, sallow skin, as well as the things that were always there; his too narrow, too pointy face, his too long nose, his thin lips. And he’s an awful person, obviously. And once again it doesn’t seem to matter at all. Harry laughs.
It was a serpent. He had not been certain that it would be. He thought perhaps he had changed too much, but as soon as he saw it, he knew that it was right. He was a Malfoy, he was a Slytherin: of course it was a serpent.
That night, he lies awake again, like he’s been doing so often lately. He listens to Ron’s snores and the creaking of the house around him. He finds himself listening for Malfoy’s quiet footsteps on the stairs. He can’t be sure what time it is when he hears them but it seems later than usual.
“Inter-house unity and all that,” he continued, blabbering away to stop himself from thinking. “It would probably be a better bonding exercise than plotting to prevent the atrocious crimes of our government.”
Harry crossed and uncrossed his arms. Ron released Hermione and she looked up at him and then at Harry with a wry smile.
“Sorry,” she said without much conviction. “I’m not mad at you, I’m just waiting for you to get over your stupid guilt trip. I mean, we both know the Potter-thing isn’t really the big political plot you’re pretending it is.”
He considered ringing the bell again, but then he honestly didn't fancy trying to persuade Malfoy to let him in. He dug his hands deeper into his pockets, his fingers finding the wand. He was doing Malfoy a favour here, and if he didn't want it, well then that was his own problem.
Of course it depended on how you looked at it. Of course it wasn't actually very long ago. Harry still had nightmares about Voldemort, he still slept with his wand next to his pillow, he still sometimes thought of things he wanted to talk to Lupin about before he remembered he was dead. This wasn't about that. This was him telling Malfoy as politely as possible that he would rather not look at it at all.
Draco looked up at Potter, who turned away the moment he noticed his glance, but the brief eye contact still sent a flickering jolt through him.
He was in his crumpled school robes, hair sticking all over the place as usual, a wry smile playing around his lips and Draco’s heart made a strange jerk at the sight of him. He felt suddenly self conscious in his stiff robes with all their silver clasps and polished jet bead fastenings. It wasn’t as if Harry didn’t know where he was going, but Draco had so far avoided telling him much about it.
“So you might have defeated the Dark Lord,” he said, “and sent my father to Azkaban and stolen my legacy. You might have stopped muggleborns from being murdered in their homes and Death Eaters from terrorizing the school, but it’s still the same elite group of people who hold the power in this country, which means that everything is just as it’s always been. You might receive an Order of Merlin and your friends might become aurors, but one day my children will be sorted into Slytherin along with the Parkinsons, the Selwyns and the Zabinis and they will continue to rule.”
Instead, he goes down there every meal, gets a plate of food and returns to his room. He doesn’t skip meals, because when he does, some Weasley kid inevitably appears sooner or later with a hateful look and a plate for him, and that’s actually worse.
The force of the dementors rammed into his brain like a sledgehammer. He froze in the doorway. Lovegood’s patronus was shielding them, but it couldn’t be as strong as the one of the auror who had escorted him the last time, or maybe it was just that they were more people this time, that it was stretched thin. He felt his energy drain away.
He and Granger were in the secret room again, reading though the books, going over their notes. They still weren’t getting anywhere closer to figuring out how to kill the dementors. It seemed like all research on them had stalled when the patronus charm was discovered, and that was so long ago everything they could find was mostly guesswork. He had mentioned that perhaps it wasn’t possible to kill them, to which Granger had said that if anyone knew that for sure, they would have written it down. From what they were reading, it looked like nobody had even tried to find out. That was maybe an hour ago and they hadn’t said anything since.
The air in the room was thick and stale. He really needed to open a window, let some air in. He wasn't sure he could move without throwing up.
Narcissa stood up. She put one hand on his shoulder, the other one against his cheek, turning his face towards hers. Her rings were cold against his skin.
And the Weasley family would all be there, of course. Mrs Weasley would stand up to greet Harry and then stop in her tracks when she caught sight of Draco, who wouldn’t know what to say. Harry had seen Mrs Weasley angry plenty of times, but that was mostly directed towards her children or husband, and the anger towards a Malfoy in her home would surely be much colder.
He was hit suddenly by vivid memories of the time he had spent guarded by dementors before his trial; the way a smell can trigger half forgotten childhood memories, so his fear tasted queasily of dementors. The fear convulsed in his chest, he was about to turn around, tell them it was hopeless and – and there was the tower. It materialized suddenly about a hundred meters ahead of them where before there had been nothing; a looming, triangular building shrouded in unnatural silence. Draco breathed a sigh of relief. He adjusted their direction. They began their descent.
“Yeah, no, I just remembered something. Do you mind if I talk to Draco for a second?” he said, standing up.
“I wouldn’t worry about that, with your luck you would probably end up saving everyone with heroic sleepwalking or something like that.”
He was already in his dress robes. They would go to claim the body as soon as he came home and then have the funeral immediately after. There would be a memorial service later on where everyone who ought to be invited would be. Today, it was only himself and his mother.
Draco woke with a start. He had no idea where he was, what time it was, had no sense of anything but the feeling of wave upon wave of panic crashing through him. His whole body was grimy and damp with sweat, the sheets were twisted around him and clung to his skin. His heart was pounding away. He gasped for air. When he tried to sit up, his arms collapsed beneath him, weak with sleep and panic. He swallowed sharp gulps of air as if trying to scream backwards.
“I needed an excuse to come over here. Hermione asked me to tell you to meet her up in the room when classes are over.”
He didn’t particularly want to face the dementor-boggart again either. If he failed this time – he wouldn’t fail this time, of course he wouldn’t. It would be unbearable if he did.
, because her wand flew from her grip and Ginny caught it with a triumphant cry. They watched the two of them catching their breath, then Ginny walking over to Granger to hand her wand back. Next to Draco, Pansy stepped forward.
“Yeah. I thought we were – you said you hadn’t told anyone else about your father, so I thought I should ask. As a friend.”
“I probably would too. Okay, so how did the knights move again? Can I do this?” she asked, and took out one of Ron’s bishops.
She stabbed at another Brussels sprout. Harry tried to imagine that conversation and couldn’t think of anything he could say that wasn’t likely to end with Malfoy cursing him.
He wanted to ask him about politics too. He still wasn’t sure he understood all the implications of what Malfoy had said, at the pub and in the Owlery, and he thought that if he did he might find out why things still weren’t right. But he didn’t really trust his tongue to form an intelligent question, nor his mind to comprehend the answer.
He turned around to leave. Draco watched him, still clutching his arm. He rarely had outbursts like this. Perhaps it was the lack of sleep that made him hot-headed, but right then he was almost trembling with rage.
“That’s not the point, I know he couldn’t,” Hermione snapped. “The point is that that’s not something normal people should be able to just watch, but he’s probably been practicing the cruciatus curse on first years, and he’d lived in that house with all those Death Eaters for who knows how long, so he’d probably seen it a hundred times before, so he
“That’s why I asked Potter to help me destroy it,” he said. “I didn’t ask him to bring any of you, but he said we would need help, and I trust his judgement.”
Draco fumbled for his wand, but she hadn't raised hers and she didn't hex him. She leaned over the counter and spat at him. Then she spun around and stormed out of there, her friend hurrying after her.
It was a phrase they had been repeating to each other since the first morning after Voldemort’s death. The first time they woke up and looked at each other it had been relief. Later, it had become a reassurance for when they couldn’t feel the relief they were supposed to, or for when it felt like it wasn’t over or that what they did hadn’t been good enough. Right then, Harry could hear himself putting too much force into the words. It sounded like he was trying to convince her.
They were on their way up the last staircase, the one that led to the corridor with the fat lady’s portrait, when Hermione broke the silence.
Ginny sat down in the grass and the others followed. They formed a small, irregular circle of teenagers with tired faces, still recovering from the shock and relief from the duel, still with adrenaline pumping through their bodies. After all the noise of their spells, the night seemed completely quiet. Draco could feel the cold air drying the sweat on his neck.
“I just said it wouldn’t be the same thing,” said Harry, trying not to sound annoyed. “You make it sound like we did something wrong when we started it.”
"So, Harry, what do you do?" asked Maya, when Harry had apparently been quiet for too long and some participation was required if he wanted this to not be weird. Or maybe she was just being nice, he reminded himself.
The smile resurfaced immediately, bright and genuine, and Draco’s insides dissolved into anxious fluttering.
“Those are females. The males have antennae – really, Potter, such a big mistake and you haven’t even started on the potion yet. One might think you didn’t listen when the professor was going over the instructions.”
He wanted desperately to turn and see Potter’s expression, but he was sure he would burst into manic laughter if he did. Or maybe he would start crying, he honestly wasn’t sure. He was so far from having any control over his body. He had still been rushed with adrenaline from the encounter with the boggart, and now he felt like his brain was rapidly short-circuiting itself. He kept his eyes fixed straight ahead. He was going to die.
He had thought a lot of uncharitable things about Malfoy over the years, but never that he was odd. Cruel, yes; petty, cowardly and pathetic, absolutely, but never odd. It was a word he would have used about someone like Luna Lovegood, who was kind and lovely but did always seem as if she had just come from another world.
“Nah, she doesn’t want us to. I think she finds it distracting when I try to help. I noticed you and Gin have been talking a bit more since this whole thing started.”
“Where are the rest?” asked Hermione, her voice hoarse and not at all like her own, and in the brighter light up here the burns on her face and arms looked worse.
He reached up a hand and carefully touched his neck, and Potter looked confused, but he didn’t pull away. He didn’t let go. Draco’s fingers rested lightly against his skin. Maybe he had flinched just a little at the touch, but it might just have been because Draco’s fingers were cold and Potter’s skin felt burning hot beneath them.
There were a few rows of desks along the walls, but the centre of the room was empty, except for a raised dais probably intended for duelling demonstrations. There were scorch marks in the wallpaper and dust on every surface. Draco lingered in the doorway.
In the library Theodore Nott was already seated at one of the desks. Draco pulled out the chair across from him.
The other two began moving, but Draco was still staring at his watch. It was an expensive one. Goblin made, silver with the Malfoy crest engraved in it. It had been running perfectly for four generations.
“Of course. The Selwyns messed up, but I’m sure they’re thrilled that Matthew is in our year now. No family would want their heir to be the one who was left out when the rest of Britain’s wealthiest witches and wizards meet with their old friends from school. The Malfoy family used to be the most powerful of the pureblood houses, we practically ran Britain. So they all knew they couldn’t afford not to be friends with me.”
hadn’t heard from you, I actually went St. Mungo’s to see if you were being treated for dementor-exposure or something and–“
Draco did not return to Hogwarts when school started. His mother wrote the headmistress, telling her that Draco was sick and would stay at home until he felt better. He had packed and unpacked several times. He would be seized by a strong urge to leave the house as soon as possible and throw all of his stuff into a suitcase, ready to apparate by himself immediately, but then he reached the door of his room and he changed his mind. Unpacked everything again.
Because he had been keeping an eye on the Slytherins. Malfoy had left them, it had only been Zabini, Greengrass and Parkinson at the table. Terry's friend had asked if Harry was interested in her, and laughed, telling him it looked like that ship had sailed. Because Parkinson was snogging some bloke and that was when Harry had gone outside to… Harry nearly choked on his coffee.
"You don't have to stay hovering in my kitchen, you know," he said, glancing back at Harry. "You can sit down, I won't hex you."
There was more than a hint bitterness in that last comment, but he ignored it. She gathered up her books and he removed the silencing charm.
“Okay, well I know you don’t like Tracey and Millicent, but they’re nicer than your other friends, so you could always just join us.”
It was three days ago that he and Potter had trained with the Dementor-boggart. Three days since he’d kissed him, and Draco hadn’t had a chance to talk to him since. He had been going up to the secret room a couple of times, on the off chance that Potter might be there, but he never was and instead Draco had had two very awkward conversations with Potter’s friends of mumbled excuses for why he had come and would now leave again. They said there was something Granger wanted him to look at, so he supposed he would have to deal with that at some point, but at the moment he had told them he was busy.
“No,” she said. “It was war. We just did what we had to to survive, exactly like everyone else. That’s what you said, remember? We were just surviving. There’s nothing for us to be ashamed of.”
He passed through the great oak doors and out into the chill evening air. It wasn’t completely dark yet. Great clouds were rolling over the skies like soft mountains, coloured gold and rose by the last rays of sunlight. Autumn was coming and though the day had been fairly warm, the temperature was dropping quickly. His school robes were charmed to adjust to the weather within a certain limit, and they would be fine for flying, even if they weren’t as good as his quidditch robes. Harry mounted his broom and kicked off. He sped upwards, accelerating to greater height as his mind went quiet, his thoughts unable to keep up, and blind relief surged through him. He headed towards the forest.
As if he had other options. But Malfoy's expression changed when he said it - if Harry didn't know better, he might have said he looked hopeful.
Potter had just been drunk out of his mind and willing to kiss anything with a pulse, and Draco had been stupid enough to tell him he was gay, and somehow that had made him an acceptable target.
"It was Blaise's birthday," Malfoy said coolly. "My friends wanted to go out for drinks. I wasn't actually there to ruin your night. Also, may I remind you that you were the one who started talking to me?"
More silence. He couldn't make out what Ron and Hermione were saying. His stomach was inventing entirely new knots to tie itself into. His heart was beating very fast.
Ginny rested her head in her hand as her eyes surveyed the room, watching the remaining Gryffindors still hanging around, doing homework or talking in little clusters.
“They’ll have to find something safer,” said Draco. “It won’t be inescapable with the dementors gone.”
“Unsurprising. Though she’s been a bit difficult to be around lately. Bossy, really particular about some things.”
Potter let out a quiet groan that could have been a garbled swear and bent over, hands on his knees. So that probably wasn't good. Draco's gut twisted - Merlin, he did not feel like hearing Potter express his disapproval of his sexuality right now.
But he didn’t say anything. Pansy turned away from him to look out the window again. The anger seemed to have burned out of her and now she just looked sad.
And Draco would sit down carefully and and say thank you and politely ask Mr Weasley about his work in the ministry, and it would be tense and difficult but it would not be wrong. Maybe it could happen like that.
Apart from the veiled figures the only other person in there was a crumpled, dust coloured man in the corner with at least ten greasy glasses in front of him.
“The aurors have to get in and out of here on a regular basis, I don’t think it’s closed with fucking blood magic-“
"Really? He doesn't talk much about his friends but the ones we've heard of all have super pretentious names."
There was another gap of silence. They stood across from each other, the two of them alone in the Entrance Hall, the flapping sounds of bat wings above them, and Potter was looking at him. This long, uninhibited stare, as if he was trying to figure something out.
The smell of smoke filled his nostrils, he saw a house collapse in flames over and over again, or perhaps they were different houses, hundreds of homes. He saw his own hand raising a wand and flashes of green light, and then in between death and destruction were childhood memories of praise, of catching frogs in a garden, a field littered with dead animals, gashes open in their sides and guts spilling onto the grass. A distant, physical sensation of bile rising in his throat, the strain of holding on to invasive thoughts.
This evening, his failure had continued as usual at first, and he had cast the useless, silvery shield twice more. And just as usual, they kept going. Potter came up with some lame reassurance and Draco assured him he didn’t need it. Nothing in particular had changed, Draco was still going through his cycle of happy memories. He raised his wand a third time and he picked a memory that he had already tried a hundred times before. And it felt different. He knew it even before he spoke the words, that he would succeed.
Harry looked at the closed door and thought that maybe he did too. He knew better than to think a spell was easy just because Hermione made it look that way, but it still seemed like there should be more to erasing someone’s memories than that. She had just saved Hermione’s life, and they hadn’t even thanked her. They hadn’t bothered asking her to keep it secret.
Harry turned to reach for the clock on his desk and winced. His head hurt. A nauseating tightness behind the eyes, an insistent pounding in his temples. Everything hurt. His mouth tasted like something had died in there.
“Then why the fuck are you here?” Malfoy snaps, and Harry is surprised at how angry he sounds – not his usual, aloof mockery, but a genuine edge to his voice.
It was ten to midnight, so really not that late, but too late for the phone to ring. No one but Mr Weasley ever called them, they had really only gotten the thing installed in the first place to indulge him. But now the sharp noise was cutting through the quiet like a siren and Harry’s chest tightened. He got up from his chair but didn’t reach to pick it up. It kept ringing. His heart was beating too fast.
There was a slightly manic glint in Draco's eyes, right behind the sneering irritation, and for a second he reminded Harry absurdly of Mr Weasley.
Draco took Pansy’s hand and as soon as his fingers closed around hers he felt the familiar jerk in his gut as the ground pulled away, air pressed itself hard against him and darkness pushed his eyes into his skull. He held onto Pansy’s hand as hard as he could, and a second later the air cracked around them. He felt a hard jolt up his legs as his feet made contact with the ground once more. He stumbled a few steps forward before regaining his balance. Then he straightened up and looked around.
She shut her mouth abruptly when the door to their compartment was pushed open. A tall, red haired boy stuck his head inside.
A glass was pushed into his hand. His fingers were shaking, he thought he might drop it, but then his mother put her hand over his and helped him raise it to his lips. He drank tiny sips, tried to get the world back into focus.
Even if the git had actually gotten it into his head to start a fight, it didn't look like he would pose much of a problem in that condition. Potter steadied himself with a hand against the wall.
“Hermione said she had found something, I thought maybe it was about that?” said Potter, interrupting Draco’s train wreck of thought.
“You hate me,” he said, sounding indignant and childish, and hating himself for it. “You’ve hated me for no reason since our first day of school. You decided you were better than me because of something that happened to you when you were a baby, and you chose Weasley over me just to spite me, thinking you could do whatever the hell you wanted because you were Harry Potter.”
The silver snake appeared in the air and lunged at the shape of the dementor. It stopped, stumbled. Potter was still standing between it and Draco, so it didn’t change shape.
And then there was silence. The rain wasn’t hammering as hard against the roof as before, but it was still pouring down out there. Harry took a gulp of whisky and tried not to grimace at the taste. Malfoy was swirling the remaining contents around in his own glass.
Ron frowned. A large group of Hufflepuffs pushed past them on the stairs and Ron waited until they were gone before he answered.
“He’s on his own so he could have been telling the truth, but what do you think they could have fought about?”
Harry ignored him. He dropped the dried poppy-petals into his cauldron and looked at the instructions again. He had to let the potion simmer for five minutes before doing anything else. He let his eyes wander down the page, looking for other ingredients he could prepare. He had to slice his mandrake root. He found a knife and cutting board and went to work.
. Harry could feel a headache growing behind his eyes. They had only been able to make out a fraction of this floor from the stairs, but none of it had held anything but dementors.
He took a sip of his coffee. It was only lukewarm but at least it wasn't as bitter as when Hermione made it.
He’s still on his bed, his clothes tangled, his hair probably a total mess, watching Potter pull away from him exactly like he used to, and Draco feels just as small and humiliated and ridiculous as he did when he was fifteen.
Golden sunlight poured through the windows of the transfiguration classroom. It was still only early February and outside the wind was sharp and biting cold, but the soft sunlight made it feel like spring was coming closer and the castle seemed warmer and friendlier than it had in months.
“I know you plan to go into politics once you leave Hogwarts,” she said. “I am sure that when you do, you will be able to change things.”
"Yeah. Did uh…" Harry's shoulder brushed Malfoy's again and he opted for leaning forwards, resting his elbows on the table. "Did Malfoy tell you about me?"
The last hours of his shift passed like weeks. Chris and Irie didn't ask about it, just pretended nothing had happened, only casting wary glances in his direction when they thought he wasn't looking. He kept his sleeves pulled down. He was an idiot for having been that careless. And it had started out as such a perfectly okay day too. He had even managed to halfway forget about Potter for a while, but then here was his past and the fucking magical world intruding on him, and suddenly Potter wouldn't leave his mind, and now Draco had to watch all of this through his eyes,  and it became so pathetic to him, the way he wasn't really friends with his coworkers, and was actually bad at his job, and had fucked up the coffee machine twice so he had had to ask Chris for help, and even Irie became too impatient with him to keep up any pretense of sympathy.
This time he was alone in the room. He had decided to go up there early, just to make sure it was free. He leaned on the edge of the armrest of the sofa and watched the door, waiting for Harry show up.
"He really is an idiot, isn't he?" said Pansy thoughtfully. "You know, sometimes I think the two of you deserve each other."
Pansy had practically been in the guy's lap when he left and it had been pretty obvious where things were headed. It was part of the reason he had decided to skip out in the first place - he didn't fancy having first row seats to that performance.
“I do. But this isn’t me having an issue, so don’t make it out like that by apologizing to me. I was worried about you and I wanted to tell you that, and that’s it. You should just do whatever you think is best.”
Ron and Harry left Draco and Neville with Pansy. They didn’t even make it across the Entrance Hall before they gave up on letting Hermione walk by herself. Ron picked her up and Harry pulled out the invisibility cloak. It was very early morning and the corridors were deserted, but on the off chance that they did run into someone, it would at least be less suspicious for them to find Harry wandering around by himself than the two of them helping an injured Hermione through the castle.
“No, there’s a voice that speaks inside your head,” he said, though calling it a voice didn’t seem exactly right – when he tried to recall his sorting, he remembered how the words had appeared in his mind without bothering to pass through his ears first. “It kept saying I would do well in Slytherin, but Ron had already told me that it was the evil house, so I kept thinking that I didn’t want to go there and instead it put me in Gryffindor.”
“Expecto patronum,” said a voice behind him, forceful but not loud, and he turned to see a hare patronus erupt from Lovegood’s wand.
“I can help you pick out the petals if you want,” said Neville. “I’ve been drying monkshood down in the greenhouses for a project, so I know how it’s supposed to look.”
"Sorry," Malfoy said quickly, interrupting Harry's train of thought before he could even formulate some sarcastic response. "That was a stupid suggestion. I'll just head back then," he said, already turning away from Harry.
“Yes, after she’s been hit head on by three of Weasley’s spells – do you know what Weasley’s casting? Disarm
As soon as she said it, they all felt the acid in their muscles. The castle was very far away. Draco thought of how wonderful it would be to sink into his bed, but right then apparating anywhere felt like more than he could manage.
“I don’t know why she went off like that. It has never happened before. Whenever I talk about last year she just looks bored and tells me to get over it.”
Of course, when he had daydreamed about it, he hadn't imagined Potter too wasted to walk or unlock the door to his own house. Hadn't added the detail of Potter throwing up in the gutter either.
Potter nodded and went over to the table. He pulled out a grubby piece of parchment and laid it on the table between them. Draco only had a moment to wonder what the point of it was before Potter placed the tip of his wand against it and said:
The Great Hall was half empty when he got there. His eyes skipped quickly to the Slytherins, but Malfoy wasn’t among them, which was a relief. He couldn’t see any of his friends at the Gryffindor table either, but Luna was sitting by herself at the Ravenclaw table reading the
"Yes," Draco said, and there was a flicker of understanding on his face. "You didn't say he'd be coming by tonight."
"This is muggle London, Potter!" Malfoy hissed. He gestured to the street: "You can't just apparate anywhere you want, someone could have seen you!"
Draco handed his broom to Luna. He reached his arm out to Harry who took it, trying not to think of how much significance that simple gesture seemed to carry.
A loud, mechanic beeping interrupted him and they both started. A second of silence and then it beeped again. Malfoy slid back to the floor and hurried to the door. He pressed the little button on the speaker.
Draco slumped into the soft couch and eyed the stacks of books on the table. They had been through all of them by now. Nothing but disappointment. He sighed and leaned forward to pick one of them up. That was when he noticed the note. It was a piece of parchment on top of one of the stacks and under it, he saw now, was a thin, black book he had not seen before. His heartbeat picked up as he took the note and the book. The note was addressed to him in what he had come to recognize as Granger’s orderly handwriting. It had his name at the top and then
Harry had stopped himself there. Forced himself to start over from Mrs Weasley’s look of surprise. There would probably still be that painful flash of anger, but it wouldn’t be Lucius who stood in her kitchen. Harry had reminded himself that Mrs Weasley was the only one who had never, at any point, forgotten that they were children when they fought in the war. So maybe she would remember that for Draco too.
Sometimes Granger would be there and they would work on the research together, but since neither of them were getting anywhere, they mostly sat in silence.
"Oh, hey, there's Mark," said Irie suddenly, half rising from her chair as far as the table allowed, and waving at someone behind them.
He told himself he wasn’t avoiding her when he followed Dean and Seamus down to the pitch to play a bit of practice quidditch with some of the Hufflepuffs. And since he went back to the dining hall with them when they were done playing, it only made sense that he sat with them during the meal. And because she was hanging out with Ron all evening anyway, he went down to the study area on the third floor to do homework rather than staying up in the common room.
Once he had started crying, it felt like it would never stop. His nose was running, he sniffled and all his breaths came out as loud sobs. He clung to her and he cried over the humiliation of his family, over the hearings and his mother’s distance from him and his own distance from her, and over Azkaban and his father’s imprisonment. He cried because Harry liked him and he was terrified by how much that mattered. He cried because his father was dead and as awful as it was, as sad as it was, it was also a relief. It felt like the real end of the war, the one he had been waiting for. The moment from which things could finally get better.
Harry slammed the living room door behind him and rushed over to the couch, pulled out the phone and then stopped, staring at it. He didn't know Malfoy's number. For a second he just stood there, feeling like an idiot. Then he remembered that he was a wizard, and this was stupid, and he
His mother’s gentle hands lifted him up from her lap and he slumped against her shoulder instead. There was vomit on her robes. She rested a cool hand on his forehead.
"About the flat. I know it's shitty, and you're wondering why I live here. You don't have to pretend otherwise."
There came no reply. Draco reached for the bottle. There was still a bit of brain activity left to kill.
Harry ends up on a couch flanked by Ron and Hermione as the Minister reads Dumbledore’s will to them. It’s a solemn moment, a harsh reminder of their loss, and Harry wishes he wasn’t so angry. Despite the Minister being one of the last people Harry wanted to see that day, he does feel a spark of hope when he finds out why he is there – he thinks for a moment that Dumbledore’s will might hold some answers, maybe a clue about where they should start. And of course, it doesn’t. It’s just another nonsensical riddle from the old headmaster, this time passed to them from beyond the grave.
“I need to speak to Potter,” he said calmly, as if he had any right in the world to demand such a thing.
“And the punishments were bad. Unpredictable. If you did something wrong, they might punish your friends or your siblings instead of you. We would have been punished just as hard as anyone else for getting out of line, but we couldn’t expect help from the ones already fighting. I mean, imagine if Pansy had stood up to the Carrows, do you think they would have let her into the room of requirement to hide her? Or hide me or Millicent or Evelyn or someone else that Pansy cared about who might have been hurt? So I think that’s why she doesn’t think she has to feel bad about it.”
“Fine, just don’t overreact on this, please. If you could just stop making everything about your future political career this wouldn’t be such a big deal.”
“You really shouldn’t walk by yourself!” called Draco after him. “You’re going to fall and break your neck on the stairs, and guess who will be charged with murder when you do!”
But Potter ignored him and took his arm again so Draco had to follow into the small empty room, an extra space meant for group work. There was a circular table with chairs around it in there, some shelves with a couple of spellbooks, and a window facing the grounds outside. Draco folded his arms and looked impatiently at Potter as he closed the door behind him. He ran a hand through the hopeless mop of hair on his head.
“Yeah, you’re spending a lot of time with him, aren’t you? I feel like I’ve hardly seen you lately.”
Harry nodded. He had been staying at the Burrow for most of his summer and in the beginning things had been weirdly awkward with Ginny – as if they couldn’t talk normally to each other or joke around like they used to. After he broke up with her before the search for Horcruxes, a mountain of stuff had accumulated between them: death and war and terrible experiences, decisions nobody had wanted to make. They couldn’t ignore it, but neither of them were really the sort of people who could sit down and talk things out. It had helped when they started playing quidditch with Ron and George in the garden and that had felt normal. By now they had a sort of relaxed, non-awkward friendship and Harry was happy that their past relationship wasn’t messing up the dynamics of the team. But even though he still liked her and she was still just as pretty and funny as she had always been, they wouldn’t be getting back together. That had been obvious after the first week of summer. Something was different; a seriousness had settled in her that somehow wasn’t compatible with whatever it was that had changed in him.
“Don’t be silly. They’ve really been worried about you, Draco. My mum would love to talk to you, Narcissa hasn’t written her a lot this summer, she wants to know how the two of you are getting on.”
“There are snatchers and possibly some of Voldemort’s own people too,” he continues. “Besides there aren’t a lot of purebloods left in Britain, he’s not going to want to kill them even if they’re against him. He seems to… care about Hogwarts. It might be the safest place for them.”
“I don’t think Hermione and Ginny are coming back. We should probably call this a day, but we’ll have another meeting later. I’ll tell you when it is. Is that alright with everyone?”
“No. I’m not. He isn’t just some mean, spoiled brat anymore; he’s emotionally amputated – no, listen to me! He’s been a Death Eater since he was sixteen, that’s not just being a bully, that’s wanting people like me killed, and he did. He tried to kill people. There’s something deeply wrong with him, Harry.”
Her eyes flicked back to The Boy Who Lived (twice), who was just then very focused on wiping leeches off his desk.
He wouldn't have believed it was possible to add another chair to the table without using some kind of space-warping magic, but by the time he came back, there was a narrow opening between Malfoy and the stringy, white boy to his left. Harry sat down between them, trying and failing to keep a reasonable distance between them. His shoulder would brush against Malfoy's, but when he tried to lean away he found himself leaning into the boy on his other side.
“Look, it’s fine," he said, biting back the sharper words that were queuing up in his mind - Malfoy seemed to be actually trying to be civil, and Harry knew he would feel like an idiot later if he didn't at least try not to hex him. "I get that you want to-“
Draco was quite proud of himself that he only felt awful about Potter's visit for about two days. Well, actively, constantly and mind-numbingly awful. He still cringed whenever the memory resurfaced. Merlin, the idiot was so incredibly unpredictable. Sure, Draco had sort of looked forward to their meeting at the pub, and it hadn't been perfect, but it had been… well, dignified, at least. And then Potter had shown up on his fucking doorstep less than two days later. He had seen the flat. Even Draco's friends hadn't seen the flat. Draco was acutely aware of how sad the place was. He should have burned the curtains as soon as he moved in, but then he would have had to get new ones and somehow that had seemed an insurmountable task, and after a while he had just sort of stopped noticing them. That only lasted until the second Potter stepped through the door and Draco had to see it all through his eyes. And now that was how Potter would remember him, in his washed up, depressing muggle home.
Granger threw herself into the seat beside Draco in transfiguration that morning and shoved her paper at him.
“So everyone knows what to do next time?” asked Longbottom, looking around when it seemed they were done.
Draco shook his head almost imperceptibly. He walked with his eyes empty and fixed straight ahead, his hand resting against the doe’s flank, his wand held limply down his side.
“I was just bringing my plate down to the kitchen,” he says, calmly, as if his heart wasn’t hammering madly in his chest.
“Because all the rest of us already know it. We learned it when we started Dumbledore’s Army back in fifth.”
Ron frowned at him, but didn’t say anything. He resumed his reading of the chocolate frog cards. There was a stretch of silence before Draco cleared his throat and in a strained attempt at a casual tone asked Harry:
"You're not. Most wizards don't care. It's only for densely populated muggle areas, so it's not like most people need to know. And you don't normally get in trouble unless the muggles see you, but since I'm… newly immigrated they're keeping an eye on me. Monitoring magical activity around the flat and such. And they put the Trace on me again."
He flipped through the paper, though if there was anything about Azkaban in there, it would have been front page news. Apparently the Ministry was keeping the whole thing quiet for now.
Lost in comfortable self-pity, Draco drifted down empty corridors and followed changing staircases randomly. The halls were empty and quiet this time of night, since only seventh year Slytherins had classes, and they were all away in the Astronomy tower with their star-charts and arithmancy books. He soon found himself in a part of the castle he didn’t know. It had grown dark outside and he saw his own passing reflection in the black glass of the windows. There was the soft glow of oil lamps in some corridors, and magical, sourceless light in others. Even when deserted, the halls of Hogwarts had an unpleasant, occupied quality, and he soon got the sense that someone was listening, following him, that they were breathing just quietly enough for him to be unable to trace the sound. Powerful magic could have that effect on you; he knew there were no real sounds in the corridor apart from his own footsteps and the low mutterings of people in paintings, but after a while he resigned and pulled out his wand, chiding himself for being paranoid and childish. He passed a portrait of a fat woman in an extravagant, pink dress. She was fast asleep, resting her head against the frame of the painting and snoring loudly. He thought perhaps he recognized her, but it might just be that she was some noble woman he had seen paintings of before.
"Doesn't look like it was fine," he said in that disarming, unimpressed way of his, and Harry's anger deflated a little.
Draco watched Potter, who had positioned himself by the window again instead of sitting down. He looked tense. The thought hit Draco that they must have been angry with him. He hadn’t even thought about that, because their hatred was centred on him and Pansy, but Potter’s eyes kept darting anxiously to Granger and the Weasleys.
“I get it, but it’s fine. Don’t worry. We talked about everything over the summer, right? I have to get down to practice now, but I’ll see you later.”
this time. All Draco’s pent up anxiousness, his fear and anticipation, was spilling over in relieved, triumphant laughter, and the boggart retreated into the darkness of the wardrobe. Potter stepped forward to push the door closed behind it, then he turned to look at Draco, grinning broadly at him.
It was only the second after he had sat back down he realized that that would have been a perfectly valid excuse to give. They all thought he and Malfoy were friends.
“Yes. But she is very pretty and she’s really good at quidditch, and people like her a lot because she’s funny and strong and she cares a lot about everyone. She’s very smart too, and all the boys like her. I think it’s very understandable why other girls might be jealous of her.”
“I’m not going to France,” Draco says, watching Harry from the doorway as he starts down the stairs.
Harry lowered his wand and allowed it to fade away. There was a scuffling behind him and he turned around. Malfoy had stood up and had already pulled out his wand. His eyes were wide and bright and excited.
“Because you can’t just decide to stop hating someone. That’s not how people work – if we simply pretended the other person didn’t exist, our image of each other wouldn’t change, as there wouldn’t be another one to take its place.”
But he had never seen any books on Azkaban then, and if he was right about the way the prison made itself a void, it was hard to imagine anyone would have thought enough about the place to want to write something down. Still, he ought to at least look for those first, just to be sure. Then he would search for something specifically on dementors, though he didn’t imagine there would be much success with that this time either. Then it would all be branching out from there – books on defense from dark creatures, dark magic, possibly philosophical texts on the nature of evil, and there might be some books going into detail about the patronus charm too. He did have an idea of a few titles that could be relevant.
They stand too close together in the quiet and the darkness of the attic room at the Burrow, not touching and not talking. Harry listens to Draco’s quiet breathing. He feels the weight of the fake horcrux around his neck. The wedding is tomorrow, and after that he and Ron and Hermione are leaving, and all of it is so incredibly unfair.
He gestured vaguely. He sort of expected Malfoy to protest, people always did when he tried to tell them this, but even if Malfoy was asking for his help, he wasn’t about to insist on Harry’s greatness. He just shrugged.
Harry comes and they only take a couple of seconds to catch their breaths before they disentangle from each other and Harry leaves. Draco takes a bit longer, needing a moment to steady himself, his dick still hard, his heart still beating, his fingers sticky with Potter’s come. He stays alone in the classroom and gets himself off before he leaves.
“And I of course asserted that if anyone has earned the right to a year of goofing off, it’s you. But I wonder why you haven’t mentioned this to any of your teachers? You know I would have been happy to talk to you about your future.”
She scoffed at him and left. The door had hardly closed behind her before it was pushed open from the other side and Nott came in. He looked back over his shoulder, then at Draco.
“I talked to Ron about it, and he said he was really scared of Azkaban when he was little. And his mother told him he was being silly, that there was nothing to be afraid of because he would never go to Azkaban, and then he said something really interesting: He said he hadn’t cared that he wasn’t going there, he’d been scared because it existed, and he’d wanted it to go away. Do you see? That’s exactly what you said: It shouldn’t be allowed to exist. So I thought that maybe kids know about it, the evil, maybe they can even feel it, and the older you get, the better you become at ignoring it.”
Shrugs and nods around the scattered group and Pansy made as if to follow Weasley and Granger. Draco grabbed her sleeve.
The silver stag erupted from his wand, filling the room with light. It looked much bigger when it was cast indoors like this. He couldn’t help imagining what it would look like to Malfoy, who had never seen it before; who had possibly never seen a patronus up close at all. And he knew it had to be impressive.
The wind outside was freezing, but after the stuffy air inside it was pleasantly sobering, the cold lifting some of the drunken fog from his mind. He put a cigarette between his lips, fiddled clumsily with the lighter. The flame wouldn't hold for more than a second no matter how he turned to shield it and it took him upwards of seven tries before he remembered where he was and pulled out his wand. He took a drag and felt the gentle buzz of nicotine flood his veins. He did kind of want to go home. He was tired and he wanted to sleep and the thought of going back inside the noise and the stuffiness didn't feel very appealing. He supposed he would have to go back in to say goodbye, though. Pansy would kill him if he just left.
It felt weird saying that now. It had always been unspoken between them, maybe because they knew how thin it would sound when it was said out loud. It felt weird saying it to Potter. Draco shrugged.
“I thought about it, but from what Luna said I suppose that had to do with exorcising a dementor. I think it’s too dangerous to try… besides, she said it didn’t work.”
“How is that unreasonable? When was the last time you looked in a mirror? You look like shit, Malfoy, even Mrs Weasley is concerned about you, and it’s not like she has much reason to care.”
In the glow from his wand, Harry watched Draco unfold the pamphlet and the light jumped over a detailed map of London. Draco put the tip of the wand to the paper.
“Alright,” he said. “I’ll remember that in the future: Beware of Hermione Granger, even the chosen one is scared of her. Anyway, shall we get started?”
Draco and Pansy appeared on the path that led to the gates of Hogwarts. Weasley and Granger were waiting for them a few feet ahead. A second later, Longbottom and Lovegood appeared in close succession. Two more cracks snapped behind them and they turned to see Potter and Ginny stumbling onto the gravel.
“His father has disappeared, that’s all I know. I assume he’s fled abroad. Theo lives with his grandparents now.”
The way his patronus had just flickered out worried him. It suddenly seemed like a feeble protection from whatever was down here. He finally understood what Draco had meant about the building itself being evil – it was like it resonated the powers of the dementors. There hadn’t been any dementors near when he went into the hallway, but when his patronus vanished, he had heard his mom screaming. He thought he would probably have passed out too if Draco hadn’t collapsed first and snapped him out of his hallucinations.
He slept a lot. He ate chocolate and didn’t throw up all of it. He knew that the worse things a person has experienced, the more vulnerable they become to a dementor attack, and that the effect of dementors was even stronger on people who had been overexposed before. Still, he could only have been out of reach of the patronus for a couple of seconds, and that shouldn’t be nearly enough to cause permanent damage no matter how weak he was. He kept reminding himself of this when, two days later, he still didn’t feel normal. His mother insisted on nursing him. He told her to leave him alone, but she didn’t listen, so he dragged himself out of bed and locked the door to keep her out. Then she sent the house elves, but he ordered them to stay away. He barricaded himself in his room and didn’t speak to anyone, didn’t read his letters and most days didn’t even get out of bed.
Another summer passes. Harry, Ron and Hermione follow Draco to Borgin and Burke's. Once again Harry is trying to point out the obvious to people who won't listen. It's really entirely rational of him when he sneaks off to the Slytherin's compartment on the train.
Harry walks back to the door and Draco watches him. He rests his arms on his knees, the watch still dangling between his fingers.
She coughed into her sleeve, letting go of Harry to steady herself with a hand against the wall instead. Harry was about to protest when a curse and a scream sounded in close succession from above.
Draco waited half a metre behind him while he looked out the door to make sure the corridor was empty. Then he stepped out and Draco followed quickly.
He pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes and tried to breathe normally. He remembered his visit to Malfoy's flat, when Malfoy had told him he didn't go into Wizard London anymore. And how he had assumed Seamus wanted to beat him up when they met in Diagon Alley. That had been yesterday. It seemed so long ago already.
“Yeah, I think it’ll be alright for now. I checked, there aren’t any detection spells and no one would be looking for us, so I think we’re good.”
Harry rolled his eyes. He had sliced more than enough mandrake root, but he needed to keep his hands busy, so he took the knife again, picked out another root and started over.
“We were discussing his right to go to school! And you’re right, I don’t think he should be in Azkaban, I think he deserves to be forgiven by the school and by the court, but not by
He and Pansy only duelled for a few minutes before she got tired of it and let him disarm her. She walked over to him and he handed her wand back.
Draco had read all the letters and comments himself that morning, but he didn’t interrupt her. This was more than they had dared hope for.
Of course of all the students at Hogwarts, Potter was the one who seemed to have missed the note that Draco was to be ignored. Draco noticed he was looking at him in potions, trying to get eye contact. It was a theory oriented lesson, so they didn’t get out of their seats, and Draco didn’t look up from his notes at all until they were dismissed. He was the first one out of the classroom.
Draco was just as fast, he had kept his wand ready and the spell bounced off, but Potter was already stepping over the shiny, black puddle on the floor. He grabbed Draco’s collar and pushed him backwards, rage in his eyes, curses on his lips and his wandpoint inches from Draco’s face. Everyone in the room had to be watching them, but no one intervened, and for just a second real fear gripped him, because Potter was furious and Draco had no idea what he might do.
"Where the hell are you?" snapped Pansy before he had even gotten through the second syllable of hello. "You are about half an hour past fashionably late and deep in the territory of outright rudeness."
Draco woke up in a bad mood. The dull sting of the failure of the night before still lingered in his gut. The flat was cold, the sky outside heavy and grey, the light somehow lightless. He flipped back his covers, stumbled to his closet, pulled out his black shirt, his black jeans. He let his fingers brush over the soft, expensive fabric of the robes on the hangers, not worn once in several weeks, and the last time it had just been for that one evening at Pansy's place. He missed wearing wizard's clothes. There were practical advantages to muggle fashion - he did not fancy facing the tube rush hours in a cloak - but at least they were
The words hang there between them. Potter’s eyes are locked on him, his gaze is intense but Draco doesn’t know what it means. If this isn’t about revenge, then what the hell is it? His lungs feel too tight, he knows the words aren’t going to come out right, but he has to say them anyway. They fall like a stone from his lips.
There was a second of hesitation before Potter released Draco’s shirt and stepped back. He did not take his eyes off him.
Immediately, images flashed through Draco’s mind of saws and leeches and everything horrible he had ever heard about muggle medicine. The revulsion must have shown on his face, because professor McGonagall let out a small sigh.
He brings the plates down again himself, at night because he’s never actually washed dishes before and doesn’t want anyone to laugh at him if he’s doing it wrong. And one night, when he’s on his way back to his room, he hears low voices speaking urgently from the living room. He hesitates for a moment, then sneaks a little closer to the door. A floorboard creaks under his weight and he freezes.
“I talked to Malfoy after you left,” said Harry. “And it didn’t sound like he’d told Parkinson what we’d be meeting about or who were coming or anything, so I suppose she wasn’t prepared for it. I think Malfoy really wants to cooperate, so he’ll probably tell her to… you know, he’ll probably talk to her if we ask him to.”
Irie had gone to the bathroom and Maya was talking to the people at the other end of the table and Draco had mostly turned away from him and was deep in conversation with Mark. Harry pushed his chair back and stood up.
But he couldn’t go back to sleep either. The feeling of the dream still clung to him. The sense of terror had lessened, but the urgency had not. That must have been why he had dreamt it – because he hard started to forget, and this had been a violent reminder of why they were doing all of this and, more importantly, why it could not wait. That was what he desperately wanted to be able to tell someone, just to be able to say it aloud. Just to make it real, to detangle it from the dream-logic of his own head: That every day Azkaban was left standing was another defeat. As soon as they had even the slightest chance of success, they had to go.
Harry wanted to grab him as soon as he was within reach, to shake him and scream at him and hold on to him and never let go again, but Draco hardly even looked at him.
“It’s-“ Harry began, but didn’t get any further before Draco pushed past him, all signs of his trance-like state vanished in place of sudden urgency.
," she cut him off with that heavily condescending tone of voice she reserved only for discussions about Draco's current life situation, specifically designed to convey in every syllable how exasperated she was with him. "About half the time we actually talk to each other, it’s because you want to hear my opinion about whether or not some new rumour is true or not. Don't try to lie to me - I mean, you’re free to stay in your state of denial if that's what you want, but please don’t try to convince me you are not still absolutely obsessed with him.”
Draco nodded and stepped away from him. He waved quickly and then walked the last few feet down to the marker that meant he was outside the area under the anti-apparition spell.
, he had said and sounded absolutely disgusted. It should have been painful to hear anyone talk about themselves in that tone, but Harry couldn’t help feeling relieved. The things Hermione had said had still been haunting him. Despite what he had told Ron, he had worried that he was wrong after all, that he was misreading Malfoy because he wanted to believe that he had changed, that he was better. Now he felt like he had finally been proved right. They could trust him. He could trust him. There was something left in him that was worth saving and forgiving. Part of him wanted to tell Hermione. But he knew how dumb that was, so he pushed the thought away.
Harry glanced up at Granger, who nodded stiffly. Then he stood up and allowed Draco to take his place. Legilimency had always been tied to Slytherin house, and because the Dark Lord had been so skilled at it, it was closely associated with him. Draco couldn’t tell if the expression on Harry’s face was one of worry because of what Draco was about to do, or distaste because he possessed the skill at all.
“It was a pretty short chapter, you can probably skim through it in the beginning of class,” said Daphne.
Draco’s heart was beating too fast and so hard he could feel it, he thought he might be dying. He had already watched an entire life, but now the stream of images was picking up speed, the scorched island didn’t fade, but he could also see and feel a second life starting over. He had already seen some of those images, he thought, as the woman poured all her memories of grief into the man.
He was already lecturing Malfoy before he had even come through the door, preaching about the importance of secrecy for wizards living in muggle areas, and how this was especially important after the war, where so much magic had become noticeable, and if Malfoy couldn't respect that, his permissions would be revoked - and then he stopped in his tracks when he caught sight of Harry. His entire body seemed to deflate and Harry almost felt bad for him - his confusion was something tangible in the room, and Harry could see him struggling to wrap his head around the situation: the idea of Harry Potter (the Boy Who Lived, war hero) in the home of Draco Malfoy (Death Eater, disgraced) was obviously absurd.
It has been weeks since Draco was separated from his mother, when they were both supposed to leave the country and only she made it out. They haven’t been in contact since. The people from the Order assured him it had gone well, so he tries to believe that.
Draco dug his heel sharply into Blaise’s lean thigh. ‘Unless you want me dead, you’ll be glad I’m choosing not to play. I’m not going to practice, Harper; you’re lead seeker.’
He elbowed his way through the mass of bodies and set his glass on the bartop. He’d order a shot, he decided, as soon as he was done with his first drink. Something different, exotic and vicious on his throat, that would clash with the firewhiskey. Maybe then he’d get a headache, or he’d feel nauseated, or some other kind of physical discomfort that would blissfully distract him. He’d hardly think of Potter if he was retching in the bathroom.
Harry’s gaze flickered momentarily at the other side of the table, caught on something, and then he was leaning to the side, closer to Draco - suffocatingly close - and his eyes glinted mischievously.
The symphonies blurred together without pause, long crescendos and the thrumming of strings in their ears lulling them into a wordless rhythm. It was Harry who, after a while, broke the strange spell with a mild complaint of his feet hurting. They walked out to the edge of the dance floor, their fingers still entwined. Luna followed them out.
'You've no idea,' Draco murmured against his sternum, 'How long I've waited to have the time to do this.'
‘I know, I know,’ Harry tried to glare at Neville, but it ended up fond. Draco slid his hand neatly from Neville’s shoulder, and watched with secret glee as Potter tracked the movement. ‘Anyway, we don’t have enough seats to stay here, we’re thinking of heading back to Hog’s Head. You opposed?’
Draco laughed, though there was something wistful in it. In second year, he’d been a snotty brat trying to please his father, weaving stories about the heir of Slytherin to the most impressionable of his schoolmates. Potter, on the other hand, had been just like he was now: ridiculously brave and preposterously reckless.
for his honesty, fingers firmly circling the half he couldn’t swallow around. He bobbed his head once, slowly, testing, the sweetest little thing, then let out a moan that reverberated around Draco’s cock - and Draco
Hours later, long after the sun had set, once the castle was dark and deserted, Draco left the library and retired to the dungeons for the night. Against the smooth stone wall, right where the secret entrance to the common room laid, rested a black umbrella.
perfect, fucking delectable in the elegant outfit, in the subtle way he fidgeted and rolled his shoulders as if oppressed by the fabric, just promising he’d keen so prettily if Draco laid him out and undressed him, so bloody precious in the way that, despite it all, his hair remained an irreparable mess of wild strands, like a blur of crows’ wings when they lifted flight. Beautiful, and Draco knew at once that night would be a terrible mistake, for he’d always prided himself in his dignity and now, with Harry there, what would his friends see but him soft and mooning and pitiful in his love?
The smile Harry gave him was so genuine it made Draco’s stomach clench - and he pictured an alternate reality where he could have wrapped Potter in his arms, steadied him against his chest and bought the damn box without having to lie about his reasons. Where Harry knew Draco loved him, and he didn’t have to hide, terrified that any nicety would be too revealing.
He didn’t want to stray too much from Harry, however. A very inconvenient, irresistible urge to protect the idiot was about the only thing keeping his flight somewhat straight. The game, for all the adrenaline it dispersed into his blood, was practice. It didn’t count - his team would give him shit about it later, yes, and Goyle would most likely punch his arm with that brute strength of his, but it’d be mostly inconsequential; he’d like to catch the Snitch, if only because Harry’s eyes always got so lovely when they were alight, and fury was the brightest flame of all, but he wouldn’t die if he lost this time around. His priority was Harry.
‘You’re a prodigy at Quidditch,’ he snorted. ‘This can’t possibly be that difficult. Give me your hand.’
The word was spoken with the vaguest sentiment, the most anonymous grief, and Ron, Seamus and Dean all glanced down awkwardly.
he was - had let himself spin the most wistful hidden intentions behind that night. He’d thought that, when Harry had invited him in the greenhouses, it had
‘I know,’ Harry shoved absently at Draco’s chest, twisting fingers in his robes. ‘I meant that this might not be the best place to do it.’
He left the stall, composed himself in front of the mirror, walked out of the bathroom. Resolutely stuck to the walls, shadowed and unseen. He didn’t dare stare at the moving bodies wriggling like sardines in the center of the pub.
His thoughts led him up the Grand Staircase. Right in front of the Fat Lady - and Draco had never been quite so glad to see him - was Ron, waiting for one of the moving stairs to clasp on his level.
‘Well,’ there was a pause, and then Harry was gingerly taking the bottle from his hand and bringing it to his own lips. When Draco dared to look back at him, his eyes were dark green under the weak light, his lips shiny from the golden drink. ‘Yes. You hated me too, didn't you?’
‘I hardly think he does,’ she said, though her tone had taken on something pensive. She leaned against the scratched wooden boards of the wall, sipping her drink, and Draco did the same. ‘We’re still best mates, the three of us. My relationship with Ron hasn’t changed much either, apart from the obvious,’ she flushed a little, which Draco thought was very understandable, since he had just sat in a table while they subtly listed off all their sexual preferences. ‘Besides, even if he does, it won’t be for long. He’s bound to find a girlfriend soon, once he gets over Ginny.’
? He’d bought him those horrid treacle tarts twice now, hadn’t he? Perhaps that hadn’t quite translated just how nice Draco wanted to be - with foreheads kisses and hands smoothing down his clothes; walking him to class, carrying his fucking books, spoiling him, tethering him to the ground, his beacon of support and outlet for anger; a lackey, essentially, in his lovesickness - but it surely ought to have counted for
He did flick his thumb across his chin a few times. It came out just a little bit red, and he left it at that.
‘Precisely,’ Draco purred. ‘Have you any idea-’ he dipped lower, sucking at the lovely skin below his jaw, drunk on the thought that he got to explore, that he got to
Harry was one of the last ones in line. When he finished paying, he walked straight towards Draco, holding the box like it was a treasured possession. Draco, who was used to either spying Potter from afar or to face him with a sneer, had to clear his throat before he could ask:
Their voices quieted down. He pointedly met their stares, for he’d never been one to show embarrassment, then glanced at Potter, who’d gone somewhat still for once in his fucking life. He wondered if Harry remembered that night in sixth year, in the bathroom - the leaking pipes, the footsteps across the tiles, the scream:
