"I'm simply pondering which subject to study first, is all."
Harry nodded. "We don't know what happened or where he disappeared to though."
"Oh, er, nevermind," Harry said weakly. Draco's eyes narrowed and he looked about to speak, but Harry began pressing open-mouthed kisses across the skin of his throat and he groaned instead.
"So, do you ever drink anything non-alcoholic, Malfoy?" Potter asked, settling comfortably into the plush armchair. "Or is it just my company that drives you to it?"
That peace of mind, while apparently as fragile as glass, had been hard-earned and Harry liked it being there. He didn't want it shattered. The earning of it had been so hard, damn it.
Potter's grin grew wider. "You totally are!"
"Definitely these ones."
"You know, Potter, I do believe I doubt your sincerity," the blond breathed.
on the man, watching as his eyelids fluttered before flickering open. At the sight of the three Gryffindors standing over him, Justin gasped, sitting up and scrambling away on his hands and feet.
The question made Draco stiffen. "I have no idea," he said indifferently. "You know they never tell us where they're going."
"He kissed you," Draco repeated flatly. "When?"
"The fittest," Draco responded honestly. "He's bloody gorgeous."
"No, I just…I—" Harry floundered uselessly, unsure what to follow that up with. Had he wanted to protect Draco? He supposed that he did; he certainly did not want to see any harm come to the man. But what did that mean? Did that have to mean something as significant as what Hermione's tone had implied? Harry wanted to protect everyone; he did not want to see any harm come to a single person. "I should probably get back," he muttered, gesturing toward the door. He had no idea what anything meant anymore; all he knew was that the longer he was away from Malfoy and the others, the more anxious it was making him, especially now that Zacharias knew where they were. How long before Smith told all the others? What if they all took it upon themselves to form an angry mob outside Draco's bedroom door? What if they were there right now? Harry took a step toward the door. "You two go find the others and make sure they're still okay. I'll go back upstairs and—"
Breathing heavily and attempting to calm himself, Harry waited as his rant was met with silence.
"Finished, then?" Harry asked, eyeing the pocket Malfoy had just tucked the potion into.
"How are you feeling?" he asked Harry suddenly, grey eyes sharp and clear, studying him intently. Harry offered him a weak approximation of a smile in response. "I will shut down that Floo immediately and close the entire drawing room." Fingers continued to stroke Harry's robed back and he realized that Malfoy's hand had never stopped its caress.
, and he felt a flush at the thought of what that
"Oh, I dunno, Harry," Wood said, eyes glinting mysteriously as he finally dropped his arms but made no move to step back. "I think I've read just about every article that even mentions your name. Many of 'em are shite, of course, but there are more than a few I found fascinating."
But Draco could picture it all so clearly. He could picture them doing
"What happened, Potter?" Malfoy demanded, taking a step closer. "Something bad has clearly happened, what is it?"
"It was Lisa and Susan," he told them in a soft voice.
"Your son is one of the dead ones, though, Crabbe," Harry reminded him harshly, skin prickling with discomfort. "How could he have broken you out when he was the first Slytherin to die, hmm? He died years ago."
Blaise paused, pressing one last kiss to Draco's chin before pulling away to stare at him with a wounded look. "But, Draco…"
"Oh," Harry mumbled, turning red and looking away.
"Well," Draco sniffed, "the next time you find you can't fight your overwhelming attraction for me and it
"Either Lord Byron or Walt Whitman," he answered slowly, sounding as if there were more names he wanted to add and yet was restraining himself from doing so, something Harry wished he wouldn't do. He longed to hear the blond speak freely, without the stiff self-awareness that he always seemed to possess. Harry wanted to watch him talk about the things he loved, face open and relaxed, silver eyes glowing as he explained the many reasons behind his adulation of his favorite author's works, the latter of whom surprised Harry yet again.
At that, a feral grin spread across her face. "I bet Potter would like it if you sucked
"I'm not staying here!" Smith said angrily, stepping forward to follow them before Hermione froze him in place with a single look.
in the other boy's voice. How was he supposed to keep them away from the bed and keep his thoughts away from ugly mental black chasm-filled oceans when Potter said his name in such a way? He could feel Harry's fingers flexing, squeezing and releasing his hips as he panted, and Draco suddenly realized that Harry was fighting the urge to move his hands lower.
"Harry," he gasped as the brunet wriggled his tongue deeper inside Draco. To Draco's eternal shame, he felt himself pressing back into the feeling, unable to help his movements as he alternated between pressing back and grinding himself against the mattress. "Harry, please, just—just fucking fuck me already!" Christ, how had they managed to switch roles so drastically? Only minutes ago, Harry had been the one pleading to fuck a reluctant Draco, and now Draco was practically
"Ginny," Ron blurted, shooting both Harry and Hermione an apologetic glance.
"I don't care what anyone thinks," the other boy said softly, closing the distance between them until he was standing even closer to Draco than before. "Anyone who has a problem with it isn't worth knowing. I'm not ashamed of you, Draco, or embarrassed to be seen with you. So stop worrying already."
"Hard not to 'round her," Harry grinned, wrapping one arm around her shoulders and messing up her hair, laughing as she struggled to get free. "Won-Won's wight earlier, 'bout her being fun t'be 'round, and all that. Right laugh, she is, when she's not being violent."
As dusk slowly crept up on the Manor, Draco lost track of the time as he stared into the fireplace, contemplating his upcoming meeting with the ex-Hit Wizard. Would he confirm what Draco had initially believed to be impossible? Would he inform the blond that Cyril Crabbe really had somehow escaped Azkaban? Would he affirm Draco's fears that the man was now out murdering his late son's classmates in some form of twisted, gruesome vengeance?
Hermione sighed heavily, exchanging a long and complicated look with Ron before finally turning to Harry. "Do you want us to come with you? We can come sit with you and wait."
Unable to help himself, Draco traced his throat with one hand, glancing down to notice the dark finger-shaped bruises circling his wrists like shackles.
A sudden tapping at the window drew his attention from his aching muscles, and he set the half-empty bottle of lager down on the table before reentering the sitting room. An owl stared at him from the other side of the window, and Harry crossed the room to let it in, noting that it was a very large, very handsome owl holding what appeared to be some sort of scroll with a rather fancy-looking seal and a black satin bow.
Draco blinked down at him. Three others coming to stay in the Manor? It sounded as if they had already moved in. Draco had the space, of course, but they could still try
"Do you always sleep half naked these days?" an amused voice drawled to his left. With a start, Draco jumped as his head automatically swiveled around to find Blaise seated in an armchair before the fire, sipping a cup of tea. "I remember when you used to wear even less to bed." Hungry brown eyes raked up and down Draco's bare torso, causing the blond to flush and shiver at the same time.
When the world finally righted itself, Draco found himself staring down into green eyes glittering above a coy smile. "I'm ready whenever you are," Harry said slyly, and Draco ground down against him at the realization that the man was
. I mean, I would know, wouldn't I? I would definitely know if I were under a potion!"
It was over in seconds.
Sighing, Harry ran a hand through his hair. "Get the others and bring them back downstairs. We all need to talk as a group to decide the next best move."
that you would never
George snorted. "Who says he's innocent though? You don't even know him, mate. What if he belongs to Riddle?"
"The Floo!" Draco suddenly shouted, wondering why it had taken him so long to think of. Turning simultaneously, they both sprinted to the fireplace. Draco reached it first, picking up the entire bowl of glittering powder on the mantle and hurling it directly into the flames.
Seek jerked back as though struck, and Draco wasn't sure if it was the words or the tone that made him step away.
"You don't know anything," Harry muttered, still blushing. While it was true that Malfoy didn't have a tiny cock, Harry had no idea why he had felt the need to inform Ron and Hermione of that. The man's cock was none of their business. It was only barely beginning to be Harry's business.
"As if you care about my sake, Potter," he muttered, crossing his arms. As if
. He said it was their reactions to discovering the bodies that he liked the most. He would Disillusion himself and hide close enough to watch it."
"But…" Draco glanced away, unable to look Harry in the eye, "I thought you hated me now. What happened to hating me?"
"Hey," Harry interrupted, unlocking the shed at the side of his house and tucking a small box of tools under his arm. He locked the shed back up and crossed to the garage, tugging it open enough to wheel his bike out. He tucked the phone under his ear and shoved the small box of tools into the leather saddlebag. "I'm coming to get you and I'll take a look at your car, it's okay. But I need you to look around and tell me what you see. Any street signs? Buildings? Landmarks? Anything that sticks out?"
Draco fixed him with a stern look reminiscent of McGonagall's "headmistress" face. "Potter, you've hardly eaten anything at all these past few weeks. You're
"So, it wasn't me you were hiding from, then?"
"I would like to speak to him first and determine what sort of mental state he is in before you have the chance to speak with him, okay?" she said in a sympathetic voice, rising from her chair and crossing to the large cabinet to rustle through the glass bottles until she found the one she was looking for. She walked back to Harry and held out a tiny opaque vial. "If you need any help sleeping tonight," she explained, and he pocketed it with a grateful nod, knowing he would most likely need it. He was not looking forward to closing his eyes, that was for sure.
"Harry doesn't want to hear about your tiny cock, Blaise," Draco sighed in absent pity. "No matter how tiny and minuscule it is, there's simply no room for it at the dinner table."
"He is here, sirs, he is back again to see Master Draco! Pibby is wondering for so long where he is vanishing to, but now, sirs, he is back!" The elf beamed.
"Well," a voice said to his right, "if he won't, I will." Two slim fingers plucked the half-straw from Fenrir's loose grasp, and Draco turned to see Tracey grinning at him. She held her hair back with one hand, using her index finger on the free hand to plug one nostril, balancing the straw in her other fingers before bending down and snorting the thin white line. She straightened up, inhaling sharply once more before dropping the straw onto the counter and grinning at the two of them.
"And then what happened?" Potter's voice was impossibly patient as though in no hurry to receive the answers Draco knew he so desperately sought.
Draco and Blaise nearly fell over laughing, Draco collapsing into Harry's lap as he howled with mirth, the laughter doubling at the outraged look on Pansy's face.
Malfoy's mouth lifted to whisper into his ear. "Do you have any idea how many times I've imagined you saying my name like that?" His hand yanked at the buttons of Harry's trousers and Harry cried his name again as pale fingers wrapped around his cock. They kissed as Malfoy stroked him leisurely, his hand pinching off the head in a delicious twist that had Harry's toes curling.
"He's right," Harry said, staring at Malfoy, "nothing will touch any of you."
to learn what true contentment was really like. Happiness had always felt like such a fleeting emotion for Harry, but for the first time in his life, he was truly and perfectly
"I highly doubt we'd have believed us." Harry could only imagine what his sixteen-year-old self would have said to someone telling him that one day he and Malfoy would be comforting each other over the war in a sitting room of Malfoy Manor.
"I can't stand this, Draco, I can't stand knowing that you're still there. I can't stand knowing he's hurt you. I'm coming to get you right now!"
But Draco had never wished to see the girl dead.
Harry smiled into the kiss as he tightened his grip on Draco's thighs before spinning them around and marching them both over to the wide bed in the corner of the room. They tumbled onto the springy mattress together, feeling like randy teenagers as they giggled into each other's mouths, taking turns rolling each other onto their backs before leaning down to snog the other one senseless.
"Erm, yeah, I mean, course…but not now. Now's not really good," he said lamely.
It had never been just
, Draco mouthed silently to Tracey, knowing that she had taken the line to spare him from the pressure of having to do so. No matter how casually everyone else in the clubhouse seemed to treat drugs, they had always made Draco nervous. He had watched far too many of the members and hangarounds, including his aunt, lose themselves to addiction, and he had never wanted to become one of them.
"Not exactly untrue, though," Draco disagreed in a low voice, familiar slithers of shame creeping up on him. He knew better than most just how scared of the world he truly was and, excepting the times he was in Harry's arms, the fear did not seem to be going away.
"Checkmate, Malfoy!" Ron whispered in triumph to a puzzled-looking Malfoy.
"On the other side of the estate," Malfoy drawled, eyes twinkling. "Past the stables. And next to the entire shed full of racing brooms and the personalized Quidditch equipment."
"Don't!" Harry snapped, body tense and practically crackling with rage. "I fucking heard! So don't you three fucking lie to me now! Don't you dare try to defend his disgusting actions! And don't you dare call me Harry like we're friends!"
"Well," Hermione began thoughtfully, "I would say a big part of the reason they tend to be popular, especially amongst the younger crowd, is the way that love potions have always been romanticized throughout the wizarding world. I mean, look at the name, for one.
on her essay so viciously the quill punched a hole through the parchment.
"…magic?" Draco repeated, mind a blank. That was not possible. What Gregory was saying was simply not possible. What did he mean he took Blaise's magic?
For some reason it sometimes—not very often, just when Cae hit a certain low pitch—perversely reminded him of the sound of Snape's healing spell, the one he had used to seal Draco back together where he lay on the bathroom floor, bloody and shaking and face stained with tears, cold tile covered in water from the exploded sinks, broken glass everywhere from the cracked mirrors, crimson splashes of blood staining the stone beneath the boy's flailing body; Malfoy sobbing, clutching at his chest,
Hermione asked him a question and he answered her absently, his eyes drifting past her to the Slytherin table, where Malfoy sipped his coffee and thumbed through the Daily Prophet. Yawning, Harry pulled a cup of coffee toward himself and gulped it bitter and scalding, stealing glances toward the Slytherin table all throughout his hurried breakfast, towards Malfoy, who finally folded the newspaper neatly and tucked it away before standing and, flanked by Zabini and Parkinson, swept gracefully from the Great Hall.
Draco longed to ask him what the hell a
"Come on," he grinned, climbing to his feet and holding out a hand to pull her up. "Let's go look for some marnadines, yeah?"
"Susan," Harry whispered, gazing down at her cold blank face in horror. Her eyes were glassy and half-open, peering up at the ceiling with a vacancy that made Harry shiver. Her body was stretched out on the ground, limbs akimbo and auburn hair spread out over the icy tile of the floor like a copper puddle. Her skin looked unnaturally frozen and pale, the light from Ron's wand casting her face at haunting angles and making her appear skeletal and gaunt. The sight sent another shiver racing down Harry's spine. What the hell had happened to her? Why was she alone? Where were Lisa and Stephen?
Did Ron really not hear how stupid that advice was? Did he not even realize that
Harry grinned at the words. "The most charming warthog in the entire country."
he had heard before.
A sharp cry tore from Draco's throat as Harry's lips wrapped around his cock, tongue sliding wetly over the shaft as Harry bobbed his head before pulling back to the tip with a hard suck, tongue dipping into the slit and causing Draco to shudder.
― Emily Brontë,
Wandering deeper into the room, Harry continued to look around in awe. The library was wide and round, bookshelves wrapping around every inch of the circular walls. In the center was a dark staircase, winding up to the second-level where Harry had found Malfoy the last time. It was there that he headed, one hand sliding along the oiled wood of the banister as he ascended the coiled staircase.
It was with a sigh of relief that he finally made it to the portrait of the Fat Lady, who gave him a disgruntled look at being awoken. At the password, she swung open to reveal the dimly-lit common room, fire burning low in the grate. But it wasn't until Harry had taken two steps into the room that he glanced up and stopped short at the sight of Hermione pacing back and forth in obvious agitation, appearing upset and sounding as though she was breathing far too quickly. Ron sat in the chair nearest her, face expressionless as he watched her pace, but Harry could see definite worry in his blue eyes, even in the darkness.
"Jesus fucking wept," Harry muttered into the air, trying to roll the tension from his shoulders. It felt as though they had been searching for days. The sky outside was steadily getting darker, drenching the inside of the manor into thick shadows and black gloom, a gloom so heavy Harry could taste it on his tongue and feel it settled over his skin. He felt coated it in, soaked in it—they were drowning in gloom. They were drowning in fear, drowning in shadows, drowning in their own damned lack of answers. Harry felt nearly suffocated beneath the uncertainty, lost beneath an entire ocean's worth of questions and doubts. Confusion had become nothing more than second nature to him at this point, falling just behind lingering fear and mounting frustration. All three emotions were slowly curling tighter and tighter within him, coiling into a tense ball of turmoil within his torso, sitting heavy in his stomach and seeming to press on every vital organ it could touch with its sticky, clawing fingers. His heart felt weighted and thick, his stomach was tied in painful, twisted knots, his lungs felt dry and strangely raspy, feeling raw and sore as though they had been scraped with something sharp. There was a cold, dense feeling in his guts, an odd agglutinative feeling, icy and yet strangely syrupy at the same time, as though he had swallowed the shadows around them and could now feel them sloshing through his insides.
"Far, far too tempting," Draco breathed, his lips brushing the skin of Harry's throat.
Draco frowned as he appeared to consider the question. "You know, I don't think I ever actually have," he mused, sounding surprised. Relenting with a shrug, he placed the bristled end of the toothbrush in his mouth, studying Harry intently and copying his every move as they cleaned their teeth together.
fault, it was just your own anger and stupid fucking insecurity that's to blame, hmm? Don't you dare give me any excuses right now, Malfoy, not one single goddamn excuse, do you hear me?!"
But Weasley and Granger had never had the delights of such experiences.
"The person who would rather Potter sit on them instead of some old chair," the other boy grinned. "I'm sure he wouldn't object."
"Yeah, Hermione, he's finished," Ron answered for the man, crossing his arms. "Right, Smith?"
"Just flying together," Harry answered, but held his hands up palm out when Malfoy's eyes flashed. "I swear Draco; I
Pansy shot him a two-finger salute over her shoulder, her other arm still linked with Granger's.
Draco wasn't sure if the compliment was genuine or if the man just wanted to change the subject, but he went along with it willingly. "Of course they are, Potter," he said, one eyebrow raised. "Do you think my ancestors would have built their home anywhere
"That doesn't sound like the worst idea," Harry admitted grudgingly, catching the heavy cloak Ginny threw at him. Three minutes later and he was dressed in boots and a jumper, pulling the cloak on and grabbing one of his handknitted hats from Molly to tug down over his ears. Ginny grabbed one of them as well with a grin, and Harry shook his head at her in fond amusement.
"Been a while for you, has it?" Wood called. "Other than earlier when you discovered your Chasing abilities?"
of his ears pierced?
"But I
"What is it?" Harry asked in a soft voice, running the tip of one finger across the skin of his forearm, as though that would help him figure out what exactly it was that was surrounding them. A crackling sort of energy was spreading throughout the room like poisonous smoke, slithering across Draco's flesh in an uncomfortable prickle and raising the hairs on the back of his neck and along his forearms. The air felt hot in his lungs, as though he was inhaling fire.
"Huh?" Draco asked, staring in confusion. "What are you doing? I thought you were leaving?"
But no, Draco corrected, shaking his head internally. That wasn't right. It was more than that. He
Eyes flashing with heat, Harry placed his hands on Draco's waist and began dragging the shirt slowly up his stomach and chest, pausing to press a line of wet kisses along the center of his torso before helping Draco free from the offending article of clothing.
, the man was tight. A heavy groan escaped Draco as he paused, holding still and silently counting to thirty in his head before beginning to move.
"You're the one who used the word, not me," the brunet pointed out, combing his fingers gently through Draco's hair and, despite not wanting to feel as though he was hiding, his eyes couldn't help but flicker closed at the sensation.
"No, they're for you," he told him, jamming his hands in his pockets and appearing uncomfortable.
"Tony," a soft voice said, and suddenly, Padma was standing before Anthony, both hands on the sides of his face as she gazed at him with teary eyes. "Tony," she repeated, and Harry could see Anthony's lower lip tremble as he looked down at her.
Zacharias opened his mouth to respond but Michael spoke up before he could. "He's right, Smith," he said through narrowed eyes. "You are way too comfortable making enemies. Do you even realize how many people here you've completely alienated yourself from?"
Shaking his head with a sigh of amusement, Harry took it back and wet the bristles of both brushes with water from the sink before spreading toothpaste over them and raising one eyebrow at the blond as he began to clean his teeth. Draco still looked confused, making Harry laugh.
"So, this is what kills you?" Draco studied the bullet up close, marveling at how so small a thing could be so deadly.
"All right then," Draco said reluctantly, tightening his hold on Harry for a moment before releasing him. "Do you feel a bit better now though?"
"I have to, Ron," Harry sighed. "Blaise is right. I need to speak with Draco."
"No you don't," Blaise said cheerfully as they fell into step on either side of him. "You could never stop loving us and you know it."
Ron bumped her shoulder back with a shake of his head and a grin.
was in love with
"Are you sure you're okay?" Draco asked, studying the injuries. The worst of them seemed to be his elbow, but there were bruises and a bandaged cut on his face, and Draco noticed that he had been holding his ribs and torso rather carefully. What had Seek done to him? Draco didn't even know that Seek could fight, and to stand his ground against Wolf was damned impressive.
"Well, I should…" Harry gestured awkwardly toward the stairs. When had everybody else left? Oliver's fingers twitched as though he wanted to grab onto Harry and keep him from leaving.
Draco narrowed his eyes. "You are such a fucking flamingo sometimes, you know."
The thought of their time having a limit on it made Harry frown, but he chose to ignore it for the moment. Draco was planning to stay there for at least a couple of days, so Harry would have plenty of time to convince him to extend his stay more permanently. Harry wanted Draco to be his forever, not just for a day or two.
"That we'll be together." And with that, she leaned forward and gently pressed her lips to his. It was automatic, pure instinct. She kissed him and without thought he kissed her back. Her lips were soft and so very, very familiar. Those lips knew his body intimately—more intimately than anybody else, and he felt the ghost of what they once had between them stir weakly. Her arms wrapped around his neck as she deepened the kiss and he began to panic slightly, wondering how to pull away even as he responded. How did he end this? How did he let her down gently? He had hoped that her feelings for him had lessened the longer he had kept her waiting, but judging by the way she had molded herself to him, that hope had been in vain.
"Yeah," Harry said softly, a small smile spreading slowly across his face, "I think I do. You've been in love with me the entire time."
"Only the most selfless of friends," Ron said seriously, and Harry snorted again.
"No," he repeated, unable to make his voice rise above a whisper. "No, I left. I left you. I'm not coming back."
"What a disgusting little rat," Draco said angrily, and Harry nodded in agreement.
else."
"Thanks," he said hollowly, climbing to his feet and staring down at the Cloak for long moments.
"Er, all right," Granger said uncertainly, following behind Pansy on wobbly legs.
"Why not?" Ron demanded.
"Draco," Harry murmured, surprising them both by pulling the man into a quick embrace. It was over just as quickly as it had happened, and Malfoy's eyes snapped open in surprise, staring at Harry with caution and shock and a strange gleam that Harry thought might just be hope embedded deep within their silvery depths.
The sound of Ginny's voice cut through Harry's frozen shock. "Can we help you, Malfoy?" Her hands clung tightly to Harry and he felt a frantic pounding beginning behind his eyes.
"I definitely won't stop you," Harry whispered, shivering at the look in Malfoy's eyes, almost as though he didn't want to swallow just Harry's cock, but his body and his entire being, maybe even his soul, as well.
"Do you really think they would be stashed away like that?" Parkinson wondered, and Harry turned back to find the others all huddled in a close group. "I mean, all the others have been practically put on display for us. Why would whoever did this hide them?"
"How long 'til you think George gets worried about Ron not coming home?" Harry wondered, trying not to think about Hannah Abbott's murder. Horrid was not a word that even began to describe the spectacle of her death. "He lives with George and Lee, so the Aurors won't even need to break through any wards to get access to his flat. Do you think George has called them already?"
kiss him; I will not be ensnared by those eyes. I will not entrap myself in the emotions swirling within them; I will not be cornered into accepting the type of commitment and emotional intimacy that someone such as Potter so clearly desires. I am well aware that it will never be with me he seeks such things.
Even through the thick fog separating his brain from the rest of his body, Draco remembered that he did not trust Blaise and longed to test the bottle to make sure it was indeed a Pain Relieving Potion, but he had no idea where his wand was and was in far too much agony to think clearly enough to find it.
Feeling bemused, Harry twisted the knob and entered the room.
Buuut I hope everyone who made it to the end enjoyed this incredibly sentimental story of teenage true love :)  Feedback is always appreciated, lovelies!
For several long moments there was solid silence; then, finally, the lock clicked, and the door creaked open. "Draco?" A deep voice asked fearfully. The door was pushed open to reveal Goyle, clutching his wand tightly and looking to be on the verge of bolting.
"Harry!" Ron said loudly, walking out onto the balcony and stopping short at the sight that greeted him. Caelix's palms were flat against Harry's chest, Harry's arms still loosely—and uncomfortably—holding his waist. They were standing too close to be easily explained, and Harry could feel a flush creep across his entire upper body.
Draco wanted to argue that what he was wearing was perfect and that the man looked more edible than any food Pibby could prepare for them to eat, but he held back the words and nodded. "Would you like to eat outside in one of the gardens?" he asked, surprising himself yet again. "I can have Pibby set it up out there, and you did say the grounds were beautiful, and I can show you more of them if you would like…" His voice trailed off and he had to fight against the urge to summon the largest object close to him and begin bashing his head against it—he did not want to appear too deranged in front of Potter.
Pansy shrugged. "He gets points for not being you. Since I'm not allowed to take points
"…okay then," Draco finally said in a tentative voice.
The question seemed to startle the other man as the quiet was suddenly broken. "Erm, I dunno," Goyle shrugged his massive shoulders. "I mean, I haven't seen you since yesterday or anything and you looked really upset then, and I s'pose I was worried, I guess, so…" Looking confused, his voice trailed off and he fell silent, appearing to have either run out of words or else maybe expecting the final syllable to explain what he could not.
After what felt like an eternity of silence, Harry rose. "I know," he began quietly, glancing to Malfoy before looking around the room, "that none of us here are strangers to loss. Not too long ago, fear and grief made up the entire world we lived in, and loss was almost part of our everyday lives. And I know that we're all scared, and I know that we're all grieving. And I know that what's happening is horrible. But I also know that we're strong. We've already survived so much. We made it through the war; we were strong enough to make it through the fear and the pain and the loss. And we're strong enough to make it through this. We'll find a way out of here, we'll find whoever is responsible, and we'll do it for Hannah, Mandy, and Terry. Whoever is doing this won't get away with it, I promise." A ringing silence followed his words, and Harry glanced around to see several people nodding in agreement.
. It just…it changed how I saw you. It changed everything about how I saw you. It somehow…made it easier to reconcile my existing attraction to you, I suppose, once I was able to start seeing you as an actual person with actual real feelings. And watching you bleed out all over the floor like that…" he swallowed heavily, refusing to look at Draco. "It was awful. It was one of the worst moments of my entire life. I couldn't stop thinking about it. And before it happened, I never would have guessed how upset it would have made me to think of you nearly dying. And that I had nearly been the one to kill you. But it did. And that's when I started realizing that…maybe physical attraction wasn't the only thing I felt for you. I just couldn't hate you anymore after that day."
that felt so good and amazing and Draco was amazing and with a start Harry pulled back to look the blond in the eye. "Draco, stop." For a moment Harry felt like everything was too bright and shook his head to clear it.
"No," Draco said softly, shaking his head. "He wanted to, but…even just the thought of him touching me like that…it was enough to make me feel sick. Anyone else touching me now just feels so wrong."
suffer, Malfoy?" The words were steeped in indignation. Did Malfoy really think that was the type of person Harry was? Was that really the way that Harry came across to him?
"I was just saying bye to Hermione," Weasley answered as if Draco had been speaking his thoughts aloud, something he fervently hoped he had not been doing.
At the thought, Draco took a sip, grimacing slightly, and flicked his eyes around the room, despite the fact that he knew it to be useless. Wisp always arrived in disguise, never making himself known before he felt ready. Draco still had no idea what the man actually looked like, only knowing that he was excellent at what he did and that he more than understood the concept of secrecy.
"Hello, Draco," Granger greeted politely from the fireplace, startling him into place. Was she speaking to him cordially? As if their past did not exist? Had the Gryffindors always been this easily forgiving, or had the war changed them? Draco supposed he would never know.
But then again, he had also promised Daphne that she would be safe. And now, she was dead. How much of that same promise made to Draco could Harry realistically keep? What would he do if Draco was ever hurt on his watch? What if Draco was worse than hurt? What if Draco d—
Because, despite what everybody around him seemed to say, Draco was a very controlled person. His emotions were normally never out of his control. He was so controlled, in fact, that he was considering nominating himself for an Order of Merlin First Class for his control. If Harry got to have a million and one medals for things like brushing his teeth and tying his shoes and having green eyes and whatever else the hero of the world was thrown his daily slew of intrepid accolades at for, then Draco should get at least
"Well, I suppose you would know best," Blaise shrugged, "considering the flamingo has only ever sucked one of us at this table, which frankly, I think is a bit rude. I am an absolute delight to suck. Just ask Daphne or any of my thousands of fans."
He stared at the parchment for several long minutes before Hermione slipped it from his loose grasp and scanned it quickly. "Oh, Harry, tell me you're not going to meet with him," she sounded worried. Harry turned his stare to her. "Eventually Draco will calm down," she continued, "and you'll be able to explain."
I asked you to stay away from him!"
"No!" Harry snarled, turning back to the door with a determined expression. "Fuck that!" And with a newfound fury guiding his actions, the man doubled the spells he began hurling like lightning bolts at the thick wood. There were several curses in there that Draco knew to be just a shade past illegal, but nothing worked. The door held.
The moment Harry sank into Draco's body, he had to grit his teeth to control himself through the wave of pleasure that washed over him, somehow seeming in perfect time with the steady crashing of the waves against the shore.
"Thank you," Potter cut in unexpectedly, gaze shifting between all three Slytherins. "For last night. For inviting them back here and trying to get along with them. I know that none of you had to do that, especially the two of you," he nodded to Pansy and Blaise, "but…it means a lot that the three of you did. For me. So thank you. Really."
"No!" Potter's eyes snapped open as a horrified expression crossed his face. "No, that's not how it happened! I found that spell in a book and all it said was that it was for enemies, I had no idea what it did! I honestly don't even know why I used it! There were a hundred other spells I could have used, but…but when you started trying to hit me with the Cruciatus, I just…I dunno, it just happened! I'm sorry, Draco, I should never have used it and I should never have followed you into that stupid bathroom in the first place!"
"You're my good karma, Draco," he whispered shyly in the blond's ear. Malfoy's arms tightened around Harry's waist as lips were pressed briefly to his collarbone. And everything was perfect.
"I needed it, 'Mione," Harry said sadly, turning his saddest puppy dog eyes on her and wondering if they actually looked as heartbreaking in reality as he pictured them to look in his head. "I was all sad and mopey, 'member? And Gin came to cheer me up! With alcohol! Only," he felt his nose scrunch, "not with gin. Gin doesn't drink gin."
," Blaise explained. "But you will, love, you will, because I'll prove to you that you can. I love you, Draco, and I'll prove to you that I love you. Just let me show you." As he spoke he rose smoothly from the armchair and took a step toward Draco, who instantly shot to his feet and began backing away. "I love you," Blaise repeated in a serious voice, continuing to stalk closer to the blond.
Madam Pomfrey sighed, glancing back at the dark shape lying several meters away in a narrow hospital bed. "Well, I've given him a potion to help him sleep through the night, but I'm afraid that I have no choice but to report this to the Headmistress. I do have a basic bit of training in Mind Healing, but I am by no means an expert. I'll speak to him at length in the morning, but if I feel as though he needs more help than I am able to give him, he may have to be transferred to St. Mungo's temporarily to begin seeing a professional there, at least until it's decided that he is no longer a danger to himself. If I feel like this is something that I can help him with myself, then he will begin undergoing mind healing sessions with me at least twice a week, possibly more, depending on what state I determine him to be in and how stable I believe him to be.
Daphne screamed again, louder than before. Draco's eyes snapped open and trained automatically on Harry, who began casting even faster. Sweat was dripping down his forehead, but his wand hand seemed steady as he rained down curse after curse without hesitation. Finally, with a groan that seemed to vibrate through the entire room, a portion of the door gave way. Harry had finally succeeded in magically punching a hole straight through to the hallway.
"So, what happened with Emsworth?" Harry asked her, hoping it would be a severe enough punishment to scare everybody else off from trying to slip him another stupid love potion.
Sighing again, Harry raked one hand through his hair. "Honestly? No, I don't think it was just random coincidence."
"And you couldn't find anywhere else to wait?" Draco snapped, feeling uneasy with the predatory gleam lurking in Blaise's heated stare.
When he had first received the folders, Draco had immediately sat and started looking through them, hoping to find answers or closure or
A Muggle pencil? Draco Malfoy?
"Oh please," Draco scoffed, "I'm so far in the lead I actually feel sorry for the two of you!"
"Wow," Ginny said, blinking at him as she tried to process everything Harry had told her. "Wow."
Aaaand that is the thirteenth chapter down! What did we think? Resolutions still have yet to be reached between the boys, but we did get Luna—my second favorite HP character— and I do hope it was all worth the wait! (Which was a bit longer than I thought it would be; haha for some reason jail cells do not come equipped with access to the internet and it took me a minute to scrape together enough money for bail.) But I am a free little sparrow once more and hopefully shall remain one! I'll try to update quickly, 'cos the next chapter might just be the most dramatic one yet :) See you then, lovelies! Can't fuckin wait!
"What?" Harry whispered, scared to hear the answer.
"What, Malfoy?" Harry asked, cringing at the overly-defensive tone to the two words.
"I'll make you a deal," Malfoy smiled, "once we find a way out of here, I'll show you the Quidditch pitch and allow you to try it out if you show me that blasted tolly box. I can't even imagine what I'm meant to be picturing."
Harry nodded, carefully averting his eyes as he studied the table in front of him. All he needed were answers, and then he would be able to put Malfoy forever from his mind. The school year would be over in just a few short months and he would never have to see the heinous blond or force his unwanted presence on Malfoy ever again.
And Draco cried for himself. He cried because he was scared, he cried because he was alone. He cried because everybody in his life up to that point had somehow abandoned him, somehow left him behind. He cried because he had thought like an idiot that Blaise might actually have possibly loved him, only to find out that the man had been having affairs for
to breathe! He had hurt Draco, probably forever! He had most likely traumatized him and now Draco would be even more broken than he had been before; he would surely hate Harry forever!
"Too late!" Blaise sang, bouncing across the room only to eye Draco's mattress suspiciously. With a pointed look, he took a seat at Draco's desk, scooting the chair closer to the bed. "So, my little non-albino friend, what happened? Something is definitely wrong."
"That's what I warned Tracey as well," Parkinson sighed, reaching out one hand to twirl a lock of Davis's hair around her index finger. "Poor girl is now hopelessly smitten."
"Just under an hour ago," Harry said, checking his watch.
Draco's breath caught as he stared up at him, unsure how to respond. Nobody had ever admitted to falling in love with Draco before. Fenrir had never once said those words. He had desired Draco; he had taken Draco; he had claimed Draco as his, but never once had he told Draco he loved him—never once had he told Draco that he meant anything to the man other than as a belonging.
"All right then," she shrugged. "Malfoy, you lead them there. I'll inform the others of the plan."
But now that everything was over and Harry was finally, after eighteen years,
Slowly, Draco turned his head to eye Harry. "No," he agreed, "it's really not."
Harry tore through his bag until he located the Marauder's Map, tapping it and scanning quickly for Draco's dot.
and Draco marveled at how strangely comfortable and oddly trusting the brunet was around the three Slytherins.
"Oh please, I was doing him a favor!" the blond defended. "You saw how he used to dress!"
to the Continent, instead of trying to run there across the channel like a sodding moron.
At the words, Harry's entire upper body flushed red as he darted over to Draco's side of the room to snatch up his t-shirt from the previous night and tug it over his head hurriedly.
's he would assault Ron with first thing in the morning, Harry quickly piled his books together and folded up the map, tucking it into his bag atop his Invisibility Cloak. Both Ron and Hermione had asked him why he still carried it around with him everywhere he went, but he could only shrug and tell them it was habit.
"You are so fucking beautiful, Draco," he said, keeping his voice soft. Waves crashed and broke nearby, accompanied by the cawing of birds overhead and the rustle of wind through the long grass peppering the large hill leading back up to the road. But Harry had not seen a single soul on the beach, and they were tucked away in a neat, secluded little spot he had happened to stumble upon by accident several months ago. The sun was peeking out past a fluffy cloud, falling on Draco and making his hair glitter and gleam like pale gold.
At the question, Draco really did smile. "Over summer hols," he said, amusement coloring his tone. "Pansy and I went together after both our parents were sentenced, some form of teenage rebellion, I suppose. It was the first time either of us had ever been in the Muggle world."
Draco threw his knapsack on the floor, sinking down onto the bed and trying to control his racing heart. But all he could think of was Seek. He needed to speak to him; he needed to warn him.
Harry shot a half-hearted glare at Ron in response.
"We'll find it," Harry said automatically, but even to his own ears, the words sounded empty. Three Aurors had all been within one hundred yards of Daphne at the time of her murder and yet none had been able to reach her. "We should send Wescott a Patronus."
"I, um, was just wondering i-i-if…" she stammered, pausing to take a deep breath before blurting out in a rush, "I was wondering if maybe you would like to go to Hogsmeade with me sometime!"
"I want you so much, Draco," the brunet whispered, kissing his chin with a soft groan. "You cast all those spells, the others can't hear us. And you can't expect me to lie next to you in the same bed all night and not touch you."
In fact, dropping to his knees right then and tugging open the fastenings to the other man's jeans sounded like an utterly brilliant idea to Draco, but he squashed it down before it could happen. Potter, no matter how he was looking at Draco, would most likely not take too kindly to an ex-Death Eater struggling to wrest his clothing from his body in attempts to molest him. It was hardly the way to earn the man's friendship and trust.
"God, that means you too, Harry!" Weasley snickered. "I don't want to hear any more about how perfect Malfoy's alabaster skin is or how his hair resembles silken moonlight."
"Goddamn it, tell me where they are!" Morgue roared, charging at Draco, who automatically flinched.
"Finch-Fletchley!" Malfoy said suddenly, head snapping up. "He didn't show up until after dinner was over and we had already moved to the ballroom!"
The words seemed to cause Malfoy to nearly cringe, but the next second he was stiff and glaring and Harry decided he had imagined the uncharacteristic reaction.
Fenrir didn't hesitate to throw it back, coughing as he clutched at his ribs once more. "Found out which of them took my truck though," he growled, slamming the glass down on the counter so hard Draco was worried it might shatter. "And that little black-haired cunt is gonna fucking pay."
With another sigh, he tapped his fingers impatiently against the farthest corner of the curved wooden bar he was seated at. He took a swallow of his butterbeer, wishing it was stronger, wishing he wasn't on duty and could order firewhisky. He felt as if he needed
"Tomorrow then," Seek finally said. "I'll be waiting. If you're not here by the time it starts getting dark, I'll come up to that clubhouse myself, Draco, I don't care how many Death Eaters there are. I—" his voice broke, "I need to know you're safe. I can't stand the thought of you being in that place."
be willing to do to be with me? Where would you draw the line for what you would be willing to do?"
Draco sighed. "I can't help it if my knob is simply irresistible, Pansy. You should know this more than anyone."
"Er…" Potter flushed as he raised one hand to rake through his wild hair. "Well, I'm not sure when it actually started, but…sixth year, I suppose? Maybe the end of fifth? I mean—" he hurried to continue at the sight of Draco's mouth dropping open in shock, "don't get me wrong, I did genuinely hate you. Even at the same time I was…" his blush darkened alarmingly, "even at the same time I was, you know—" he looked absolutely mortified, "attracted to you. But then…"
But for the rest of the day, Harry could not help but wonder what Malfoy had been thinking as they'd stared into one another's eyes in wary silence, just as he could not help but remember the way Malfoy's gaze had traveled over his entire body before looking away.
"Are you still upset from earlier?"
"Many?" Harry raised one eyebrow at the blond. "What are the others? You know, besides how apparently stunning I look in the house colors."
"Later," Draco rasped, trying to stop himself from panicking. He needed to remain calm. "Tomorrow, Fen, please."
Tracey simply shrugged, ignoring the intensity of Wire's stare. "Not as pretty as Pansy," she grinned, and Morgue chuckled.
Draco reared back as though slapped and sent his most evil glare—the one he saved for extremely special occasions—at the Gryffindor, fingering his wand and reminding himself that he really couldn't afford to get into any trouble, and hexing Weasley dead would, unfortunately, be guaranteed to upset one or two people.
"Better hair than yours, definitely," she laughed, reaching out to tousle his hair affectionately.
"Fine," Harry said shortly.
"Demanding git," Harry grinned, shaking his head but settling more comfortably into his bed as he dutifully gave in to Malfoy's demands and began telling him everything that had happened in the time since leaving school.
I want to be with you, because you're sodding perfect, you twat, even when you're not! Actually,
Blaise Zabini had never been one for sentimentalities. He had never been a particularly sympathetic person. He had never been one to wallow in emotion; he had never been one for remorse. Only a fortnight ago, he wasn't even sure if he would have been able to accurately describe the feeling of guilt.
to know him?
A reluctant chuckle slipped from Harry's mouth as he shook his head. "You're something all right, Zabini."
holding fucking
"I—I dunno," Harry stammered. Every passing minute was only serving to confuse him even more; he had no answers for any of his own earlier questions. "I dunno, Caelix, I just…" he dropped his hold on the other man's shoulder. "I just don't know." Taking several steps away, he sighed and folded his arms atop the marble railing, burying his face into the blessed darkness that his limbs afforded. "I'm sorry," he added, words slightly muffled.
Malfoy nodded.
Wordlessly, the Slytherins all nodded as they fell into step, following Harry through the labyrinthine corridors back to where Ron and Hermione still were. Malfoy walked beside him, as silent as a wraith. He looked drawn and exhausted, and his skin seemed even paler than normal. A flush spread across Harry's face as he gazed down at Malfoy's hand, swinging slightly as he walked. Would it help ease some of the tension in Draco's shoulders if Harry were to reach out and entwine their fingers? Holding hands was something he had always done so little of in his life but had always enjoyed it when it happened. When he had been with Ginny, holding her hand had always somehow seemed even more significant than sharing a kiss. Would Draco feel the same? Harry glanced back at the others, wondering how they would take it if he were to reach out and take Draco's hand. He was sure that at least one of them would have some snide, sarcastic thing to say, but at that moment, Harry didn't care. All he wanted at that moment was to feel connected to Draco and hopefully comfort the both of them with the action.
Harry could make out the shape of furniture spread across the floor and along the walls, but he could not see anybody there. Cautiously, the four Gryffindors moved forward, wands raised. Harry and Hermione stepped forward to take lead, both approaching the door together. Hermione sent him a quick hand gesture, signaling that she would take shield and allow Harry to take point. He nodded in agreement, tightening his hold on his wand. Hermione raised her left hand, flashing another hand signal to the four of them, a quick starburst followed by a closed fist. The three men nodded, shielding their eyes with their left hands.
"Oh, as if it was the plan that made you go," Blaise said, waving his hand carelessly.
"Harry," Draco said quietly, stepping close enough to touch; Harry frowned at the distance still between them. "What happened?"
"What the fuck do you think?"
He wasn't sure what to say to the other boy or when the best time to approach him would be. The blond never seemed to be out of the company of Zabini and Parkinson; in fact, the three were rarely, if at all, ever parted from one another. They traveled together in a tight triangle—Malfoy always at the front—holding hushed conversations that were never audible to the other students.
¡Hola, mis amigos! Before we begin, there is a very heartfelt and serious warning for the grief in this chapter. So, you know, brace yourselves for it. We braced? We good? All right, lovelies, let's do this thing!
Zabini's eyes narrowed. "The only one who knows where we are is Smith. I'd say it's pretty obvious who was at the door just now."
"I'll come with you," he said instantly. After everything that had just happened, he was damned if he was letting Draco out of his sight, even for a moment. Malfoy nodded gratefully and sent him a shaky smile.
Did Draco really think that Harry was the type to parade around doing
"I'm fine," Tracey said, stepping up beside Draco and grinning at Zach. "This little bitch is too weak to ever hurt anyone."
At the question, Malfoy smiled and relaxed slightly, as if just the thought of poetry was enough to calm him. "Fifth year," he said.
"Both," she shrugged. "Either. Take your pick."
"Shut the fuck up, Zabini!" Harry growled, shaking him roughly. He longed to shake him to pieces, shatter him beneath the violent force of his rage. He wanted to curse him into unrecognizable shards. Aside from the Dursleys—and Umbridge—he could not remember ever having hated anybody as strongly as he loathed the man in his grasp. "You don't fucking know him!" Harry lowered his voice but his hold on Zabini, if anything, tightened even further.
"Draco," Zabini murmured, wrapping one arm around Malfoy's back and pulling him into his chest, away from Harry's light touch; Harry's palms felt cold.
"Nobody is stalking anybody!" Draco snapped. "We all just happen to be in the library at the same time! Coincidence is faultless! Now stop pestering me already and let me study!"
how everyone finds out that I—that I-I raped—"
"Fuck," Harry growled, running his hands over Draco's chest and sides. "Fuck, Draco."
"No, just Molly Weasley."
A loud clapping drew the attention of the class, Slughorn's usual way of silencing the chatter. As he began to ramble on, picking up steam in his oftentimes long-winded lectures, a slip of parchment suddenly appeared on the table before Draco. Glancing down, he noted the untidy scrawl as belonging to Potter, glancing over to see the brunet studiously taking notes, mouth apparently tugged down in concentration. Turning back to the note, Draco's heart began to pound as he read the message Potter had written, a short
"I—I'm not sure," Harry admitted with a grimace. "I honestly am not sure what this is or how I feel about you. I intended to tell you everything tonight—be completely honest and confess to everything. This was not how I was intending you to find out about it," he ducked his head, face flushing.
, and yet…yet Malfoy had been so prepared to take his own life simply because he had thought that Harry hated him.
"How did you get out of Azkaban then, if it was just you?"
, he thought wryly.
Hurrying after him, Harry called out, "Draco, stop! Look, I'm sorry! That's not what it is at all!" Reaching out one hand, Harry grabbed him by the shoulder and swung the blond around to face him. "I care, I really do! I—"
"And that one as well," Harry yawned, gesturing to Pansy, who had fallen asleep with her head on Blaise's lap.
Harry laughed weakly. "What, you can't guess from what I've not said so far? You seem to be doing a really good job of telling yourself my side of the conversation."
"What is it?" Ron wondered, staring around the hallway as though the answer was spelled out on a wall somewhere.
But while Draco was willing to allow the gossipers to spread their nasty rumors, Harry was much less controlled than his lover. He would leap around corners or bookshelves to confront anybody he overheard speaking negatively about his boyfriend, usually resulting in his furious echoed shouts and once or twice in the accidental shattering of a window. Draco would stand behind him and eye Harry smugly whenever such a confrontation became particularly escalated. For as many years as he had spent actively trying to make Harry Potter furious, it was so much better to be on the defending end of his anger.
"No," Hermione said, "but we will need ink."
"Nobody gets along with you, Blaise," Draco sighed, shaking his head, "we merely tolerate you."
he heard with every tap. The wind around him was picking up, whispering through the long grass and kicking up dust near the side of the road. Above him, the sky was churning with dark clouds, and Draco hoped the rain would wait until he was at least back in his car. In the distance, a metal gate clanged shut, creaking open before slamming back against the bars with a sound loud enough to make Draco jump. The nearby trees were beginning to bend beneath the increasing force of the wind.
Grinning widely and feeling tonnes better than he had when he had first arrived at the library, Draco allowed himself to be pulled from the maze of bookshelves and down the corridor, not sure where they were going and unable to bring himself to care. He trusted Harry.
The comment made Wire frown at her. "You think Blaise is pretty?"
"But did you see that picture?!" Draco raged, hearing his voice bounce back to him in the empty corridor.
"Definitely the second one," Draco declared, cheeks pinking at the realization that he had basically said outright that the thought of dating Potter was not a disgusting thought. "I mean, you act like the entire world isn't dying to date you, Potter."
A sigh of relief brushed Draco's upturned mouth as Potter—Harry? —smiled impossibly wide at the admission and kissed him soundly. Draco held nothing back this time, kissing him in every way he knew how, a tiny voice in his brain deciding that even if this was a cruel prank, maybe he could still get something out of it.
Caelix smiled at the pathetic attempt at humor, but it was not his usual cheerful grin. This one was smaller, tighter. It did not reach his eyes. "Yes, well, I s'pose I should get going," he said quietly, pushing away from the wall. "This latest letter might give us something. I'll let you know if it does." He turned from Harry and began striding down the corridor toward the main entrance.
The man gave a short nod and Draco rose from his uncomfortable chair, praying his limbs remained steady.
"We'll put the two of you in separate rooms for now," Hermione said, "and speak to the both of you in turn."
Sighing, Harry pulled his glasses off to rub at his eyes with both hands. "Malfoy," he said finally, speaking in a low voice. "He knew. He fucking
"I'm not lying, Malfoy," Potter frowned, wrapping one hand around Draco's upper arm and tugging until the blond turned to look at him. "I hadn't realized, or even really thought at all, what it would be like for you to come back here. I hadn't wanted to think about it, I thought I had wanted it to be difficult for you. But after seeing you the other day…after being the one to take you to the Hospital Wing…"
dad that most of their possessions were sold to pay war reparations and legal fees, and the entire nation looks down on him now as nothing but a Death Eater, so he really has no status of any kind anymore at all.
Draco was only as temporary as everyone else in Harry's life had ever been.
Draco drummed his fingers impatiently on the table until she walked away. "Well?" he began immediately, leaning in across the empty space and lowering his voice, despite the privacy ward still in place around them. "It was a guard?"
That theory was shattered as the cold apathy of the blond vanished to be replaced with anger. "Well, then there's nothing stopping you from saying
"So, this is where you're hiding them then?" a voice suddenly asked, and Harry nearly jumped as he turned to face it. A figure was stepping out from the shadows and Harry felt himself both tense and relax at the sight of Zacharias stepping away from the wall. "This is where they've been holing up?" Using his chin, he gestured back to Malfoy's bedroom door.
"When was the last time it was opened?" Harry wondered, stepping closer to Malfoy. "You said that Justin was the last person to arrive at the party, didn't you?"
The fingers Harry had fantasized about so often in the past few days slowly popped the button of Harry's trousers loose and worked the zipper down teasingly. Harry wanted to groan and beg him to go faster, but the look on Draco's face silenced any protests. He looked
enough to be able to kill three of us here and still have gotten away with it?"
Glaring, Harry muttered something beneath his breath that Draco did not catch before turning back to the broken doorway. Stepping through, the man was immediately swallowed by the thick darkness, and Draco felt terror grip his heart and squeeze.
"Of course it was," Blaise said patiently, flicking a shapeless piece of veg back at the blond. "Because it was a brilliant one."
Then, the day after New Year's—a New Year's that Harry had found to be very enjoyable, indeed—the brunet received a letter of apology from Oliver, as had, to his eternal shock and everlasting surprise, Draco as well. Wood had written asking forgiveness from them both for making a move on Harry, as well as for the comments he had made about Malfoy. He also insisted that Harry keep the broomstick as a gesture of friendship, to which Harry simply shrugged and relented, deciding it would be much easier than trying to force the situation once again.
"What about his partner? Where had he been?" the dark-skinned man continued. "Surely he's the one you should be looking at the closest?"
The second he woke up, he knew it was going to be terrible. The entire room was still dark; the water of the lake swirling past the thick glass of the windows was murky and black, and Draco could already tell without looking that the sky would be a gloomy reflection of the ugly lake. For a moment, he considered simply going back to sleep and ignoring the entire world and hiding away from all the horrible awfulness that he knew was creeping his way. Draco had never believed in Divination; he had never really believed in premonitions or the Sight, but somehow, he just knew that the day was going to be awful.
Heart pounding, Draco stared at him in rising panic, feeling lightheaded and dizzy. The blood was rushing through his veins in terrified surges, making him feel as though he might faint. He could hear every pounding thud of his frantic heart. "Harry," he choked out, stumbling forward half a meter before Harry's glare made him halt.
Malfoy shrugged again. "Maybe they saw whoever is behind this do something guilty and were killed as a result."
"There's no way anybody would be able to enter through a bedroom," Draco reminded him. "The wards will keep everybody who is not Daphne out, unless she extends an open invitation, such as now," he gestured around. "And it's impossible to enter through the balcony, regardless. The ground's wards prevent such a thing, besides the fact that whoever sent it would first have to get past the gates and the wards there. These grounds are not easily breached, I assure you."
"Prove it," Draco said in a low voice, and Harry tilted his head in confusion.
A weak laugh escaped Draco as he took another tiny step forward. "Christ, Potter, you really are a fool."
The handle of the staircase beneath his palm was smooth and oiled, as were the stairs beneath his feet, which thankfully did not creak as Harry climbed them with careful steps. He did not want to give himself away too early and scare the other man off.
"Of course it is," Blaise said patronizingly, turning to Pansy. "It's better just to play along to make him feel better," he said in a loud stage whisper. "You know how temperamental hedgehogs can be."
"And how did your son break you out of Azkaban, then, if he's still alive?" Harry asked in a calm voice, wondering if Crabbe really did believe that his son had somehow risen from the dead in order to break his malicious father out of prison.
"Well, yes, but…I…" Draco trailed off, suddenly looking flustered, "You…you really never said things like that to her?"
"Is this dragonhide?" he asked curiously, holding the thing up to look at it more fully.
"What the hell does that have to do with fingerprints?" Ron asked behind them, and they both turned to find him standing with his arms folded and nose wrinkled. "And why do you need Spellotape? How do you two even know how to do this? The Ministry doesn't bloody well fingerprint anybody."
Madam Pomfrey was silent for a long time, and Harry finally glanced over to find her staring at him sorrowfully, gaze sweeping over the brunet as though attempting to pierce his flesh with the power of her stare. "I'm not sure if that will be a good idea, Harry," she said finally, sounding far older than she looked, "for either you or him."
Nott laughed, and Harry nearly fell over in shock. Nott
"And then," Malfoy continued as if he hadn't heard him, "then you accept that
"Does that mean you feel your protection no longer necessary?" Even though he had asked the question, Draco was unsure what he wanted the answer to be. He hated feeling as if he needed to be watched over, by both the Ministry and Harry sodding Potter himself, for fuck's sake, but he also was not sure how much he wanted to be left completely on his own with a killer on the loose and a shining target above his head.
A genuine smile slid across Seek's face in response. "Draco," he breathed, typing in the name as his smile widened. "I like that. I really like that. I told you that you would have a name as pretty as you are. I've never met anybody named Draco before."
"Um, maybe because it's only February?" Harry pointed out, excitement starting to spread through him as he sensed Hermione's nearing capitulation to his freedom. Escape was so close he could almost taste it. "We still have
Blaise snorted. "Yeah, trust me when I say that none of us miss him."
"All right," he relented, slumping in his seat. He supposed he could wait a few more hours to see Seek if he really had to.
None of them had uttered a single word in hours.
"Would you like some tea?" he asks politely, gesturing me to sit.
"Technology?" the blond said the word slowly, as though it tasted strange on his tongue.
that I love you! Nobody can convince me that my feelings for you are not real when I'm the only one who knows what I feel! I was willing to give my life for you, Harry, that's how much I love you!"
"What did you want to tell me?" Harry finally asked, unable to take the tense silence any longer.
Granger rolled her eyes. "We still need to go to our own beds."
"Is it?" Harry chuckled, trying to shake off any lingering sadness that always accompanied thoughts of Sirius. He squinted, trying to picture Draco as a child. Yep, the man was right. It was definitely strange.
"But…I do know that a big part of me
"I hardly think any of us are going to start wandering around on our own at this stage," Nott responded dryly.
"And that was all without even having to try," Nott said in a bored voice. "Congratulations on your personality, Smith."
"It's not
. "All these are yours?"
the bat, because you're way more shrill than I am!"
"Burnt toasted fannies are not an image I want in my head, thank you," Blaise protested, looking rightly traumatized—it was not an image Draco wanted in his head either.
Harry shook his head, opening his mouth to inform Ron that he was going to spend the night with Draco and the others, but the redhead was speaking before he could get a chance. "Oi, Nev," he called, and the room silenced as everybody turned to him. "You're coming with us, mate. The four of us are gonna find somewhere private to kip as well."
"Please, Draco. I just…I think one of us should go with you, wherever it is." He took another step closer until he was just behind Draco's shoulder, and Draco felt his breath catch. "It doesn't have to be me," he added quietly, words sounding suspiciously pained. "I can get Ron if you would prefer."
"She did
After all, Harry had known! He had known that there was no way in hell Draco Malfoy would ever have been romantically interested in him! He had
"Oh, Harry," Draco sighed, resting their foreheads together. "Now who's the insecure one? My feelings for you have never been…" he took a deep breath, forcing himself to be as honest as Potter, "they haven't ever been the same as yours." The words caused Harry to pull away with a hurt expression, and Draco hastened to continue, "You only recently stopped hating me. You were still hating me at the start of term. You hated me right up until you found me in that corridor. But," his grey eyes searched Harry's own, who was not even blinking as he listened intently to every word Draco spoke, "I haven't felt that way toward you for a very long time. It's true that there were times when I truly did despise you, but those seemed to come and go, the vast majority of them mired in feelings of rejection and self-directed disappointment. You hated me for who I was as a person; I hated you because you were my exact antithesis. You were my opposite in every single way, everything in this world that I was not, everything I should have looked down on and yet, I still wanted to be close to you. I still craved your approval for some reason and yet knew I would never get it.
Raising one eyebrow, Harry ran one finger lightly over the marks on Draco's throat, mouth tightening at the other man's open cringe.
Slipping out of the portrait hole, he swung the cloak over himself, disappearing into the heavy darkness. It was well past curfew. The corridors were empty and Harry's footsteps echoed lightly off the stone walls as he made his way to the dungeons, pausing every now and then to check the map to make sure that Malfoy was still in Snape's office.
. In the
And under the overwhelming power of those eyes, Harry found himself blurting out what he had initially been too embarrassed to say. "I want to find out why you make me feel like this, Draco," Harry whispered, and he heard Malfoy's breath catch at Harry's use of his given name. "I want to find out why you're the only person who's ever made me feel so…"
Draco couldn't even speak. How was any of that true? That story was absolutely insane; it could not be true! Finally, after only twenty or so years of silence, Draco opened his mouth to speak. "You were
conversations with people outside of the five of us, Potter. You clearly underestimate how much society dislikes us."
"Sod off," Draco yawned, twisting the kinks from his back before climbing from his bed.
"I second Theo's idea of not having to sleep next to a bunch of blokes any longer," Zabini stated. "I think I'll go with you girls tonight," he nodded to Parkinson and Davis. "Pansy can sleep in the middle of us, Trace, if that's all right with you."
"Yeah, well you're a…" Draco struggled for a moment as he tried to think of an animal repulsive enough for Blaise to be compared to. "A
Potter had not given him a chance to reply, pressing Draco against the thick wood of the door as they traded smoldering kisses, Draco trapped deliciously between the warmth of Potter's firm body and the unyielding door of the broom cupboard. One hand slid down Draco's chest, caressing the length of his side before settling on his hip and giving it a squeeze, fingers digging in tight but nowhere near tight enough. Potter's other hand moved restlessly over Draco's upper body, grazing over his throat and chest, sliding down his stomach and around to his back before clutching at his waist.
. Even if the older two Malfoy's had still been living there, the house would have been far too large and still would have felt empty and lonely to Harry. It was just too big for three people, let alone one person and a house-elf. How had they ever found each other in a house that size? Harry felt as if people could live there together for years without ever catching a glimpse of one another.
"Okay," Harry nodded. "Good. I know exactly where you are. There's nowhere around that's going to be open at this time of night, so get in your car and lock all the doors. Make sure the bonnet's down so you don't attract attention. I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?"
"Of course," Draco smiled.
"God, you are so fucking gorgeous, Draco," Harry murmured, eyes searching Draco's face before they slid shut and the brunet was kissing him once again.
"Yeah," Harry agreed, eyes twinkling as he rose from his seat and waited for Draco to rise as well, "who would have guessed."
One day it would break him completely.
Potter blinked at him for several moments. "You can't stay here, Malfoy," he spoke slowly. "There is a Ministry-approved safe house waiting for us. The other Aurors are already aware of the location and the situation, we can protect you much better there."
"And Parkinson and Zabini?" he asked hopefully.
"Whatever," Ron grumbled, slamming his textbook shut. "I can't concentrate anymore, I'm going to bed." Joints popping, he stood and collected his parchments, books, and quill from the table in the corner of the Gryffindor Common Room the two had been working at. "You coming?"
, I knew you would ruin this somehow by being a git. I'm going back inside now, you can stay out here and have fun being a sad lonely pervert wanking in public by yourself."
"And we still don't know where he is."
"But still true," the other boy whispered against the dip between Draco's collarbones, tongue darting out to taste the skin and grinning when the action earned a shudder.
" he pointed out crossly, sitting up and folding his arms across his chest. "We've practically moved into the sodding place! Madam Pince is going to start charging us rent if we stay here any longer! I don't want to pay her rent!"
Either way, he pulled a face and shook his head. "I doubt a Hufflepuff has ever been inside the Manor, and I won't be the Malfoy to shatter that record."
"Do we know what happened in there?" he asked, jerking one shoulder toward the house.
"Perfect," Draco breathed, staring down at the ring on Harry's hand. Even if it wasn't an engagement ring, everyone who looked at it would know that Potter was taken. "You really like it?" he asked in a small voice, giving in to one of his very,
"I won't deny it," Draco grinned, carding his fingers through Harry's hair. "I've spent eighteen years being this incredible and I'm still not even used to how overwhelmingly incredible I really am."
Shaking his head, Draco sighed. "I doubt we'll be able to stop ourselves from bringing up the past, Potter," he said ruefully. "We have far too much of a history for that. It's going to happen regardless of intention. But let's agree no more apologies, all right?" He fixed the brunet with a hard stare. "It's not your fault the Dark Lord decided to live here. It's all in the past, and I have dealt with it." Draco had survived. He had healed—mostly. There was still the occasional nightmare, but other than that he was fine. Right?
Ron rolled his eyes. "Oh yeah, real mature."
do?" Fen said, responding aggressively.
Hermione still looked doubtful, but the doubt disappeared from her face in the next second as she clambered through the flames and onto the hearth. Climbing to her feet, she looked around Ron's guest room in surprise. "I can't believe the wards let me in. When did he adjust the wards to allow me in?" Harry wasn't sure if she was speaking to either of them or if the questions were rhetorical, but they both shrugged. Continuing to look around the room, she frowned. "Why didn't I try that much sooner?" They both shrugged again in response.
"It's fine," Malfoy muttered. "It's nothing I haven't heard before, I can assure you."
, it was pounding with anticipation and desire and excitement and nerves and lust for
that you can't put that decision on me! We've only been involved for a few days, for Christ's sake!"
That was the moment he had fallen in love with Draco.
Seek swore loudly. "I'll fucking kill him," he growled. "I'm going to rip that fucker's head off with my bare fucking hands!"
"Whatever you need to tell yourself, Potter," Draco smirked, breath catching as the other boy moved lower to trail his nose and lips across the sensitive skin of Draco's throat, earning a shiver from the blond.
Honestly, though. Who the hell had ever decided to make an entire holiday celebrating
"And where have you two been together?" Draco asked, eyes narrowed.
"Come on, Harry, cheer up!" Ron leaned forward to thump him on the arm. "What are you getting so mopey about? I'd understand if you tried to kiss him and he turned you down, but it doesn't sound like that's what happened, yeah?"
kind," she snorted, but Harry thought he could see a slight blush dusting her cheeks.
"Fucking hell Potter, you really are quite set on taking on far more than your fair share of martyrdom, aren't you?" Draco sounded frustrated. "Listen to me," he jerked Harry's chin down to force him to meet his eye. "It. Is. Not. Your. Fault." Each word was pronounced slowly. "I know exactly what you're thinking; you're shit at hiding your emotions. So stop it right now, because I'm telling you that you did
"Do you need someone to stay behind with you, Neville?" Hermione asked, but Neville shook his head.
"You're with him already," Pansy said, patting Draco on the leg again, but this time, he let her. "Blaise is right. If you like him now, it can be real now, it doesn't need to be just some plan that the three of us cooked up in secret. He doesn't ever need to know."
"All right, well thanks," Harry sighed. He wasn't sure what to make of this new information, or if it was even worth pursuing. Malfoy's private business was his own, after all.
"When the hell did she say that to
"And how many people in the Ministry did you have to fuck to get that piece of information?" he asked sardonically, voice dripping ice, and Harry felt chilled. What had happened between the two of them?
And with that sufficiently dramatic outburst hanging in the air behind him, Draco turned and wrenched the bathroom door open, stomping through it and ignoring the cry of "No, Malfoy, wait!" that echoed behind him. He did not want to admit to himself how much it hurt to think that Potter thought him stupid, but Draco could not fight the pain that twisted his insides as he realized that Blaise's plan would never work because Potter would clearly
"Everything's okay, yeah, Harry?" she asked him, still grinning.
"Obviously," Harry huffed. "With a shitload of grown man baggage and everything."
But the last question was ridiculous. If the Weasley's were anything, it was anything other than traditional purebloods. Of course they would not have reacted to Charlie's sexuality in the same old-fashioned pureblood way that his father would have if he had ever known. But Draco had never met another pureblood who was out and comfortable with it. Blaise hardly counted, since his mother had always been much more concerned with money as opposed to blood-status. Was everyone in Weasley's family as accepting of and comfortable around Charlie as the redhead before him appeared to be? Surely Charlie's parents would not have demanded that he continue on the family line before seeing to any of his depraved, perverse urges, as would have been expected of Draco if the issue of his sexuality had ever been brought to light.
"You stop it, Draco Malfoy," Hermione said sternly. "I mean it. You were a different person then; you were a
"Y-yes," the man breathed, finally exhaling. "B-but I didn't take anything! I didn't take a knife!"
"Oh come now, Harry," Oliver snorted. "You can't honestly expect me to believe that the Saviour is going to remain single for any length of time, can you? Not with the entire wizarding world lusting after you." He pinned Harry with a heated gaze that traveled slowly up and down his body. "Not without good reason, too. You're certainly all grown up now, aren't you?"
"And Potter?" Harry turned, surprised by the man's tone of voice, which was much less flinty than normal. He was fixing Harry with his regular serious stare, but there was something almost…gentle about it. "Stopping these murders and saving the remaining Slytherins are worth more than some childhood grudge, aren't they?"
, to relax. He needed time and space to come apart, to take a break from holding himself, binding himself together so tightly in the presence of strangers in his home. He needed time to sort out his mistrust of Blaise and all the hurt associated with thinking about him. He needed time to sort out his attraction to Potter and all the blistering hope associated with thinking about him. He needed time just for
"Look," Harry sighed, and Draco heard a thousand different emotions buried in that single word, "I really need to talk to you. I really think we—"
"So, a clean, mutual break, then?"
"Back off, slag," Draco growled, scooting closer into Harry's side, who happily wrapped an arm around him.
"Well," Potter—Harry—cleared his throat. "I suppose I'll let you go to up to your room, then." He gestured toward the staircase. "And I need to talk to Ron about a few things." They both glanced down the hallway, where the sound of voices was steadily growing louder. "I'll see you in the morning, yeah?"
"I just want to see if it really will make me feel better," he said with a shrug.
The moment the horrible words entered his ears, Draco's mouth dropped open and he came to a screeching halt, staring in angry horror at his traitorous friend. "
"Stop acting as if you don't have magic, you git," Harry grinned. "You don't have to be cold unless you want to be."
"Did you fuck him?" Pansy's smirk had widened, and Draco wanted to curse the expression off her dumb face. "Or did he fuck you? I can't really imagine Potter letting himself get fucked."
"Been following my career, eh, Harry?" Wood smiled slyly and for some reason, Harry blushed.
"What does that mean?" Harry wondered, sounding confused, and Draco gave Blaise his best glare in a silent attempt to shut the stupid idiot up.
But Oliver just shook his head and sighed, looking defeated for a moment before he crossed his arms and pinned Harry with a stony stare. "It's not because of Malfoy, is it?" Harry choked. How had he known? "I do have eyes, you know, Harry," he continued, voice slowly hardening. "I saw the way he was looking at you on the pitch and I saw him watching us kiss after the match."
"They're not even real people!" the brunet objected.
. "You won't hurt me, Harry, I trust you. And if it makes you feel any better," Draco chuckled, continuing to explore Potter's perfect body with his hands, "I've never done that to a man before either, so you're not the only one here." Draco was not exactly sure what sort of response he had been expecting to the statement, but it was certainly not the one that he got.
Harry and Draco exchanged a glance as he crossed the room to pull Hermione into a distant corner. "He was upstairs," he said quietly, turning his head as he saw Malfoy come up behind him. "But where we found him, Hermione…"
Harry didn't know what to say. He wanted to wrap his arms around the slender blond and comfort him until the tautness had fled from his mouth, but he could see the walls in the other boy's grey eyes and the defensive straightening of his back and wisely kept his arms to himself, deciding he wanted to continue living with both limbs still attached to his body. "Shame," he said instead. "You were good competition."
Harry reached down to help him to his feet and Draco wondered if he should point out that he had been trying to get them out of that filthy cupboard for quite a while, but it had been Potter who had distracted them from leaving by being crass and arousing. Draco decided not to say anything as Potter opened the cupboard door, grateful he had chosen to remain silent as they exited the cramped room to the sound of applause.
"Nothing," he said, studying Draco's face. "I just needed to make sure that you lot were still okay."
"Yes they can," Ron frowned, "Dobby Apparated us out of here once before."
"Why don't you maybe try talking to him about it first before making shit up in your own head, though, yeah?" Ron suggested.
"I haven't," Harry said with a shrug. "I haven't gotten a single one so far. I think people have finally realized how serious I am about Draco and decided to respect our relationship." His words were serious and expression hopeful, and Draco had no choice but to pat him on the cheek in the least patronizing way he was able to.
"Please tell me you have at least
"Too bad," was the response, but it sounded slightly shaky.
fancy you, Harry. And of course I would be willing to do anything to be with you."
"Bit hard to do," Nott responded, sounding bored, "since none of us were even on the same floor as him."
"Your faith in me is very moving," Malfoy drawled.
"Shut up, Malfoy," Harry muttered, feeling as though his face was on fire and wondering how the rest of his body was not consumed in flames just from the force of his blush.
"Yeah," Pansy cut in, "so stop trying to cut us out of this relationship already, it's clearly not going to work."
!" He paused to shudder at the feel of Draco's teeth scraping lightly against his bottom lip. "This really is you, right? Oh, Christ,
"They were always far too good for Wire and Morgue," Draco said in a faraway voice, and Harry wondered what he was thinking.
Oh my god…" His voice hitched and trailed off brokenly as Draco kept up the fierce assault and it was only moments later that Harry was shaking and attempting to warn the other boy. "Dra…Draco…Draco, fuck, I'm about to—" Malfoy's only response was to tighten his grip on Harry's hips and pull back just far enough to flick his tongue over the engorged head.
"Right," Malfoy said flatly, keeping his gaze fixed on the stone floor ahead of him as he began to shuffle forward once more.
"No, Blaise." Draco shook his head, trying to clear it while also trying to reconnect his brain to his body. "Not right now. This is just…today has just been too fucking
But Draco hadn't even finished deciding whether he wanted to speak or remain silent before Blaise began to answer for him. "Well," he said matter-of-factly, "from what I understand, Draco is no longer a virgin, Potter is great in bed and rather generous with his usage of lubricant, nobody got their dicks bitten, and Potter decided to tell Draco how much he's in love with him and Draco is now wallowing in an entire emotional river of regret. And then I'm pretty sure that's when I came in, right as the river and the wallowing began. After that I know for sure is when
"Yes," Draco drawled, tensing in anger, "whatever would he do without your permission to go to his own common room. Thank god he has you in his life."
