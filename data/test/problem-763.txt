Harry gazed down at the ring on his finger, mesmerized by its beauty and awed by its history. He never had anyone to explain the meanings of precious family heirlooms— there were just vaults filled with valuables sitting in Gringotts that nobody seemed to know anything about. Knowing that he would be carrying a piece of Draco’s family, of Teddy’s family, of
“Then what IS??” Harry pleaded.
After casting a couple of cleaning charms, the oyster in his hands was now spotless and germ-free. He pulled his mokeskin pouch from the side pocket of the bag he was carrying and took out the small velvet box. Opening the box revealed an 18K yellow gold ring, inlaid with five white natural saltwater pearls. There was a pearl in the center that was surrounded by four more, forming a cross pattern. The band was intricately carved with a leaf design, giving the piece a very romantic look.
“I love you too, babe,” Harry said.
“What do you reckon we do with them?” Harry asked.
He’s so used to everybody knowing that they’re a package deal. Oh well, the Italians will probably be pleased to have another player to practice with. They could even have 2-on-2 matches! He was pumping himself up more and more as he approached his boyfriend, still lounging on the chaise.
Draco sighed heavily with relief once they were back in their hotel room. He was glad Harry would be fine, but he had still been very stressed by the whole situation. Did he not predict something like this would happen? Trust the king of the Gryffindors to absentmindedly step on a bloody sea urchin.
date!” Harry replied.
Draco felt his face getting warm.
- of yourself as if you’re a bl-
“Oh, where did you find those?” Draco asked, leaning over for a closer look.
Harry was still in shock as Draco ordered them wine and the waiter walked off the deck. The ship already began pulling away from the dock, which was odd. He attributed it to magic and didn’t think too hard about it. He was reeling from the news— he was about to have a romantic dinner on a yacht under the stars, alone with his boyfriend. If he was not able to successfully propose tonight then his luck was officially cursed.
Draco chuckled, “I thought you would appreciate a family heirloom. Especially one that was smuggled from my mad ancestors and kept safe by my more quietly rebellious relatives.”
Harry looked over at him now, and admired his appearance. He had styled his hair back tonight, accentuating his bone structure and giving those expressive eyebrows a chance to shine. He was dressed in a pale pink suit with a white shirt and silk lavender tie. Despite his stylistic choices and slim figure, Draco’s confidence and commanding attitude gave him a strong, masculine look.
He said this, but Harry saw the way Draco was fussing with his hair and, was that makeup? His cheekbones did seem to be sparkling a bit.
Harry blew out all the air in his cheeks and gasped, laughing again.
Draco crawled out of bed and began switching out his pajamas for his swim shorts.
“You’re a disgusting, Gryffindor sap, Potter,” Draco replied. His flush and gentle smile belied his dismissive comment.
“You know you’ll never manage it. Not without a net or something,” Draco said, brushing his wet bangs out of his eyes, “Or, you know,
He moped about his two spectacularly failed proposal attempts earlier that evening. The second one was especially disheartening, how could he possibly fuck up that bad? He groaned just thinking about it. He tried to put all of that behind him. As he was getting dressed for their dinner tonight, he knew that this would be his chance. They would be pleasantly full from dinner, so there was no chance that they’d argue because they were hungry. There would be no dangerous sea creatures in the immediate vicinity. The setting would probably be romantic. So, hopefully he had a moment alone with Draco to pop the question.
“A little louder for me, hmm?”

“I think you’ve experienced firsthand just how
“I didn’t realize you were so eager to admit defeat before the entire world, Malfoy,” Harry grinned confidently, “Don’t worry, the papers will agree with your shirt.”
blow him in the mens’, did you?” Harry asked, sarcastically.
Draco held up his inebriated boyfriend and smiled to himself. He really didn’t need validation from anyone but Harry. Carefully, he walked Harry up to their hotel room for a hangover potion and an evening nap. Hopefully, when Harry woke up, they could finally go for a swim together— and Draco could finally show everyone who ‘Mr. Baker’
… What about those two underwear models that came after? Were they drunk too?” Draco asked.
Draco’s voice dripped with a sultry tone into Harry’s ear.
“Harry, do I have to treat you like a toddler, telling you not to stick everything in your mouth?” Draco asked. He immediately realized his mistake as he saw Harry’s shit-eating grin and continued, “Don’t you dare fucking say it.
because you are an angel born of Light magic and us mere mortals are blessed to be in your heavenly presence,” Draco stated as though it was an undeniable fact and not a gross exaggeration, “But imagine a whole generation of children named Baker due solely to your sinfully delicious pastries and unadulterated sex appeal.”
“That man… that man bought you twelve drinks… from this fancy, overpriced hotel bar? How the fuck did you pull that off? Did you have to suck him off in the mens’???” Harry asked, sarcastically, but with genuine astonishment.
Draco waved them inside as the man in the suit began apologizing profusely, “I am so sorry about the delay, Mr. Malfoy. There is a flu going around, so our Mediwizard is out sick and the hospitals are busy. We are so lucky that Dr. Rodriguez offered to help us out,” he gestured towards the healer.
Harry started laughing.
He was so excited to give this ring to Draco— there was no doubt in his mind that it was anything less than perfect for him. Harry commissioned this ring from Dennis Newitt, the top magical jeweler in Britain. It had all sorts of intricate charms and spellwork on it, which his boyfriend would certainly be fascinated by. Draco approached charmed trinkets with the same enthusiasm that Hermione showed for books.
“Should I?” Draco grinned and stuck his tongue out, ready to take all of it in.
“Mr. Hoffman has been called away on urgent business just a few minutes ago. He sends his most sincere regrets for missing his appointment with you. By way of apology, he insists that you enjoy the dinner he arranged for you gentleman. We have planned a three-hour cruise for tonight. He expects to be back at the resort by the end of the week and he hopes that you will agree to reschedule your meeting,” explained the dark-haired waiter, with a polite, pleasant speech.
“Why do you speak -
Fortunately for him, Draco understood the gist of his boyfriend’s discontent.
“Merlin’s fucking balls, Harry. He’s buying from me because of my superb business sense and negotiation skills, not to mention Malfoy Tech’s sterling reputation,” Draco responded, indignant. He then sighed in resignation, “However, he’s likely buying ten-thousand without having even seen the product first hand because of my nipples, yes. And the mimosas.”
Draco chuckled to himself at Harry’s confusion.
“Oh, really?” Harry asked, genuinely surprised. This was easier than he expected. Was Draco perhaps telepathic? How did he know these girls were interested? “What could you possibly have to say about a guy you just met at the diving board?”
After five minutes had passed, Harry pulled himself out of the pool and was about to head over to Draco when he was suddenly surrounded by four bikini-clad girls. They looked to be about 18, definitely quite young and excitable. In fact, Harry was having a bit of a hard time following what they were saying due to all the giggling. He was having flashbacks to being mobbed by fans in Diagon Alley. After a moment, he realized that the girls had a German accent and hadn’t mentioned his name, so it was possible that they didn’t recognize him. He sighed in relief and his smile became much brighter. When one of the girls asked if he wanted to play pool volleyball with them, he politely declined— saying he’d love to see them another time. The girls quickly left, giggling and speaking rapid-fire German on their way.
“A long line of handsome, wealthy suitors given the boot without a second glance, but you’re impressed by sardine-catching and—what was it? My

“Why, I thought that was obvious. The gentleman you just shook hands with, Mr. Leo Hoffman, gladly offered to pay for my refreshments this afternoon,” Draco replied.
“That doesn’t count! You’re the Saviour of the Wizarding World, you could be half-troll and your sycophants would still sing your praises as if you were Merlin himself,” Draco responded, “
Harry looked up at Draco’s face and realized that he was being spoken to.
And what about those people hanging all over you a few minutes ago?? Were they just

She turned to Harry, “You’re lucky Mr. Malfoy takes such good care of you.”
“You’re admitting defeat, then? I suppose I’ll take pity on you,” Draco replied, “Besides, you’ll need your lungs intact for what I had planned for tonight.”
“No, as a matter of fact, everything is
Draco chuckled.
“By those rocks over there. I’d never eaten one before. Can’t tell if I like it yet or not,” Harry replied.
Draco raised one eyebrow and gave him a smug grin.
“That would be cheating,” Harry replied without looking up, totally concentrated on his task, “I caught my first Snitch with my mouth at eleven. Draco, this should be no problem.”
Figures they’d show up after Draco did all the work.
Harry already didn’t like where this was going. He waited with bated breath.
“Oh Potter. You poor thing. I bet you even drank all of them, didn’t you?” Draco asked, giving Harry a pitying look.
“Watch where you step,” Draco warned.
Draco was staring intently at the ring with interest.
--------------
He realized he was rambling again. And still seated on Draco’s lap. What were they doing again? Oh, right.
“You have to wear my talking watch for two weeks and write me a detailed, honest review,” Draco declared.
Harry smirked and started flexing his muscles.
impulsive.
“Ah, you like that?” Draco smirked. He stopped to brush over Harry’s abs once more, drawing lines over each muscle. His stomach was warm to the touch, and Harry shivered at the contact. Draco’s hands moved up Harry’s body, pushing the shirt higher and over his head. When it reached Harry’s hands, he leaned forward to tie the shirt at his wrists.
“Hey Draco, look what I found! Oysters! Aren’t they amazing?” Harry exclaimed, his nervousness probably coming off as excitement.
Harry sighed, knowing he was about to give in. He just hoped he wouldn’t regret this later.
Harry asked.
“You already are my family, Draco,” Harry whispered, holding his face and giving him a kiss on the lips.
“I think your fanclub may be a bit nicer than mine,” Harry said, “I haven’t gotten shite from them except for fan letters, used underwear, and a lot of really questionable food items. Oh wait, there was that old lady who knitted me the mittens with the cupcakes on them! That was really sweet. I sent her back a signed photo and everything,” he reminisced, “I love those mittens…”
After rinsing the shampoo out of his hair and applying a dollop of conditioner, Harry waved him off to finish bathing on his own. Draco sat against the side of the tub, just in case Harry needed any help with his foot. His assistance wasn’t needed in the end, but it was still pleasant spending this time together. He almost felt back to normal afterwards.
That is, until he noticed that he was not the only person ogling his boyfriend, who was currently getting out of the pool and being approached by a group of young women. They were wearing the most scandalously small bikinis he’d ever seen. Harry was friendly and good-natured, but the girls quickly left him alone, causing Draco to breathe a sigh of relief. This was short-lived, however, as there were suddenly two very attractive men talking to Harry and they were
“All right, I’ll help you. But I refuse to touch them,” he stated firmly. He then whipped out his own wand and got to work.
------------
Harry! Explain to me how that helps your argument.”
Draco was covering his mouth with his hand, cheeks stained red and tears streaming from his eyes.
“Not dramatic, my arse…” Harry muttered under his breath. Draco was really starting to piss him off. He just wanted to go for a swim with his boyfriend on his day off and here he is arguing over nothing, “Fine. Is that how you want it? Well, maybe I
“... A favor to be chosen at a later date.”
I can be,” Harry leered. His hand slid down confidently to the area below Draco’s belly button.
“Yes, they name their babies
“Horse breeding is a most noble profession, Harry. Why, the Malfoy stables are full of prized stallions. It has taken generations of work— in fact, the first man to put our horses on the map was Bertram Malfoy circa 1664. He was devoted to his animals and on occasion he even slept in the stables with his horses. According to his servants, he paid
Dr. Rodriguez then addressed the man in the suit, “Maybe you want to warn your European tourists about the dangers of marine wildlife. That would be a big help.” She gave him a big, false smile.
and found that his watch was about two minutes fast.
Draco took a shower, washing off the sand that managed to wedge its way into every nook and cranny. Harry wanted one too, but he couldn’t get his injured foot wet. He settled for a bath with his leg sticking out of the side of the tub. Draco was still feeling a bit stressed and he noticed Harry was looking rather dismal, so he offered to wash his hair for him. The water was warm and Harry’s inky black hair was soft underneath his fingers. He probably spent more time rubbing the coconut-scented shampoo into his scalp than he strictly needed to, but Harry wasn’t complaining. In fact, he looked totally relaxed, almost making Draco wonder if he was falling asleep. It was nice.
Harry gave a bit of an awkward grin, and silently hoped that this man he
Flying with professional Italian Quidditch stars??? Draco was going to be so excited when he told him! He bet Draco’s even seen them in those magazines he hides in his bedside drawer and denies having. Wait a minute, did he completely forget to mention Draco to Antonello and Luca?
It was Harry’s turn to drop his jaw.
Harry smiled and felt his cheeks growing warm. Goddammit, if he didn’t love this man.
“PROVE IT!” Harry yelled, “Right here, right now.”
Draco quickly grabbed the medical kit— thank Merlin Harry thought to bring it. He handed him a Pain Potion and Harry chugged it down, shoulders immediately drooping with relief.
Draco felt slightly ashamed. He hoped that the flu outbreak wasn’t too bad.
He sneaked looks at Harry’s face when he could and was startled to see an expression of utter misery that hadn’t been there a few moments ago. He confirmed with Harry that the Pain Potion had worked. So why did he look like he was about to cry? Draco decided not to push it too far and just focus on his task.
Draco nodded in acknowledgement and took a very careful step in that direction.
He had learned
Draco reached over the table and grabbed his hand, looking up with wide, innocent eyes. “Please, Harry?”
“Well, that’s
Third time’s the charm, right?
Draco immediately stood up, whipping out his wand, and stepped closer to see what was going on.
couldn’t screw it up.
After adjusting the time, he slipped the watch on his wrist and admired it. The black dial contrasted with the white circular hour markers, and the rotating bezel gave it a more casual look. He loved to stare at the second hand as it made its pleasantly smooth rotation. It was oddly hypnotic. Draco had gifted him this sporty black diver for his birthday, claiming that no boyfriend of his was going to walk around with bare wrists. It was typical for Draco to make a kind gesture appear totally selfish. The truth was that Harry had been paying a bit too much attention to Draco’s watches since they’ve been dating and it hadn’t gone unnoticed. He would never buy something like this for himself, despite having quite the fortune in both the Potter and Black vaults. Luckily, his boyfriend had no such reservations and Harry was slowly learning how to spoil himself a bit more.
“Are you sure it’s safe to hold those? What about the pincers? Circe’s tits, Harry. Did you really have to grab it with your bare hands?” Draco grimaced, growing increasingly worried. He began to realize that he was alone on an island in the Gulf of Mexico with a reckless, impulsive Gryffindor. His shoulders drooped with the weight of that responsibility.
He lowered his lips to press a kiss to Harry’s collarbone. A hunger flared within Draco as he kissed down to Harry’s chest. He nipped at the patch of skin under Harry’s right collarbone and sucked at the redness to leave his mark. A rolling moan left Harry as a small
Heart beating fast and stomach fluttering, Harry pulled out the oysters from his bag— including the one he had specially prepared.
He saw a familiar white-blond head of hair at the bar, next to a not-so-familiar head of… salt and pepper hair? Harry squinted but he couldn’t get a good look from this distance. As he approached, weaving around several people and refusing servers offering more drinks— he was able to view the situation more fully.
“Three margaritas and four cocktails makes... seven drinks. I’d like to see you beat that,” Harry replied. He was totally confident in his victory. After all, he had the attention of everyone at the pool. Surely, that didn’t leave many fans for Draco, right?
get?”
“It’s important to clean the wound. You don’t want it to get infected, after all. Cleaning charms don’t quite do the job,” Draco explained in a calm tone, more for himself or for Harry, he didn’t know. He carefully washed Harry’s injured foot with soap and water, cast a drying charm at it, and rifled through the medical kit again. He pulled out an antibiotic cream and an ointment for wounds. He didn’t know what to do about the venom, but surely it wouldn’t be a problem, right? After applying the potions to the sole of Harry’s foot, there wasn’t much else he could do. He stood and started cleaning up the tent.
He was ready to end the night relaxing in a pool under the stars with his favorite person in the world.
“And the loser has to wear a t-shirt that says ‘My Boyfriend Is Sexier’ to the Quidditch Cup Finals,” Draco decided.
“It’s quite simple, really. I discreetly asked the bartender to make virgin mimosas after the third,” Draco replied, “Frankly, I’m more worried about the state you’re in. How could you possibly have four cocktails in a row?”
Draco gave him a look that said,
Harry teased.
. You have quite the taste in men, Draco. Not that I’m complaining,” Harry replied, still cupping his prized sardine in his hand.
“Playing that game, Malfoy?”
“Jesus fucking Christ, Draco,” Harry groaned, regretting his choice of a Slytherin boyfriend.
“Wait, you prepared a speech? Well, let’s hear it then,” Harry demanded.
Harry gave a small smile. “That sounds perfect.”
“Get your mind out of the gutter, it wasn’t like that!”
“That was a horribly cheesy line, I hope you realize. You’re lucky your profiteroles are the best I’ve ever had. Otherwise I’d have to run off to Mallorca with that Spanish nobleman from the Ministry Ball,” Draco replied.
Draco smiled to himself as Harry excitedly ran over to see the tiny crabs. He knew him far too well.
“Come on,” Harry said, patting his back, “Let’s go back to shore. There’s something I want to show you.” He turned and started swimming.
and that perhaps if you
“Both names are disgustingly plebeian,” Draco spoke in a haughty tone, “But I suppose that it’s necessary in order to shine a spotlight on a specimen of fine breeding such as myself.”
” Harry argued.

“We’ll see just who will admit defeat,” Draco replied. “Two hours, the highest number of drinks wins?”
There were a million ways to answer such a vague question. Harry smirked, closing both of his hands over Draco’s.
He pulled out his mokeskin pouch from his inside breast pocket, and grabbed the oyster he had prepared this morning.
“Well, that wasn’t
and yet everybody at this goddamn resort is drooling all over
“Yeah, over there,” he replied.
Harry swallowed audibly.
Harry lowered his hands into the ocean, allowing the sardine to swim freely once more. He turned and wrapped his arms around Draco’s shoulders.
Harry was standing on a dock, the sole of his right foot now fully healed. According to his watch, they had arrived at the marina at 7:58 pm—  precisely on time. He was wearing a charcoal suit that Draco insisted was ‘casual’ and looking up at a truly massive yacht, belonging to Mr. Leo Hoffman. It was the biggest boat at the marina by far, looking more like a small cruise ship.
“Don’t be obtuse! That isn’t the problem!” Draco cried.
Harry dug into the tiramisu, crème brûlée, Black Forest cake, éclair, and tres leches. His favorite was the crème brûlée— his just never seemed to turn out quite this flavorful. He could see the fresh vanilla beans, maybe that was the secret? He was meaning to find a supplier of fresh vanilla for ages. Hmmm. Maybe Neville could help him with that? He’d never thought to ask before.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy, you are the funniest, bravest, and most brilliant man I’ve ever known. Will you do me the incredible honor of becoming my husband?” Harry asked, voice rough with emotion. He felt his eyes begin to water.
there’s sea urchins,” Harry grunted.
Draco tried to keep a straight face but his rapid flush revealed his true feelings.
Harry’s jaw dropped.
It was mid-afternoon, the sun was beaming hotter than ever, and the pair finally spent some quality time amongst the warm, salty waves. There were teeny little sardines swimming around them and Harry kept trying to catch one with his hands— he had been unsuccessful so far.
Draco reached further down and Harry wasn’t able to give a coherent reply. He supposed sunscreen wasn’t so bad after all.
Harry’s hands had begun wandering a bit lower down and he was contemplating whether or not he should make a move when Draco abruptly turned his head and said, “Thank you, love. Now it’s your turn. Make sure to get your ears.” He hopped off the bed and began looking through his luggage.
Lips roamed to Harry’s cheek and to his ear. The warmth of Draco’s breath tickled him as he kept kissing.
right, and everybody here wants to get in my pants. I still don’t understand why you’re offended if you know I won’t cheat on you.”
you? You should feel blessed to be in my very presence,” Draco sniffed.
“Absolutely, it would be
“Coming!” Harry yelled back. He gently lifted a beautiful pink starfish, splashed a bit of water on it and began jogging over.
Harry chuckled.
Harry quickly assented and the next moment they appeared in the living room of the tent. Draco asked Harry to send a Patronus to the hotel to get help. In too much pain to protest, Harry did as he was told.
“I know we’re eating lunch soon, but I figured we both needed a sugar boost before we start biting each other’s heads off,” Draco said, handing Harry a chocolate muffin whilst popping one into his mouth.
His hair was more relaxed than Harry had remembered it, with a side part that swept a little over his eyes. Harry thought this made him look more approachable than the stiffness of his former style. He was wearing a dark teal button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, and brown trousers that hugged the thin muscular shape of his legs.
“Hey, can I...uh...use your bath?”
“Shut up, I’m serious!” Ron waited for Harry to continue guessing.
Potter slightly raised his brows and looked to his right, pretending to notice something outside the window.
Harry was finally able to release the breath he was holding. He filled his left palm with the oil and rubbed his hands together to warm up the grease. Draco’s toes were cold, so he squeezed them between his hands, releasing his warmth into Draco’s skin.
“We're going to take you to Spell Damage, where I normally work. You'll need to practice walking again and I'd like to make sure you heal correctly.”
“So...how long have you had your shop?” He decided to jump right in, not knowing how else to break the ice.
“There. It'll help with the redness and swelling.”
“Probably not, mate.”
Draco hated that he cared and that he was curious. All the gay wizards he met at bars were nobody he knew from school or grew up with. He wanted to know more about Potter, but as friendly as Potter was to him all these years later, it was still under a very professional exterior and he was sure his job had a lot to do with it.
“Yeah, I know. I’m ashamed to say that some of that was my own doing. I gave him quite a hard time in school, when I was obsessed with impressing my father and trying to feel like a ‘chosen one’ like Potter was.”
“Is Draco going to be okay?” Harry wasn’t hiding his tears anymore.
“Well, I'm glad you don't hate them,” he laughed.
“AHHHHH…...HARRY……….GET IT OUT!!” He felt Vasilia pull a slippery little body out of his own, and immediately put the squirming little infant onto his chest.
Draco was shocked to hear this. Potter had been away from wizarding society? “What's LGBT mean?”
“Who, Ron? Who is it? Voldemort’s daughter?” Harry laughed as he took another sip.
“I’ll try,” Draco softly laughed, giving Harry a final kiss before spreading his legs around Potter’s hips. After some satisfaction from snogging, Harry made his way down Draco’s body and took his cock inside his mouth, not hesitating to go all the way down to the base. Draco moaned loudly in pleasure and he grabbed Harry’s hair again, massaging his scalp to show his gratitude and enjoyment. Harry held the backs of Draco’s knees, pushing them towards his chest, until Draco’s hole was exposed right in front of his face. Draco shut his eyes and took a deep breath. It wasn’t too late to stop all this. He could still go home and forget this ever happened. But he couldn’t. Harry was enjoying this as much as he was, and he couldn’t think too hard or too much about it. Drunk or not, he wanted this. He may never again be able to get this close to Harry Potter. It felt way too good to stop any of it.
“Take your clothes off too. I want to touch you.”
“No, Frida, it’s really not. I may like him, but it’s not mutual, alright? He had sex with me because he was drunk. I could've done it sober to be perfectly frank, and that’s the difference. We both came out to one another as gay, and he saw an opportunity to have sex with a bloke. Lots of guys do that. Then you never hear from them again. You know how many men I had in Paris?”
Draco's hands were shaking as a struggled to pull the black pants up to his waist. His legs felt like there was lightening going through them. Fucking Potter. He loved and hated him for this at the same time. No man had ever gifted him anything, much less something so thoughtful. He had tried to replace what he had, going all the way to Hogsmeade in his busy hospital schedule. He hated that he couldn't say more. He wanted to say more than 'thank you' but it wasn't going to come out right. Potter made him feel weak and strong at the same time. He was afraid of the vulnerability lurking right beneath his tongue if he spoke too much.
He took a deep breath and loudly sighed. “My father doesn’t want anything to do with me. My mother is torn, I think. I sometimes get letters from her, asking to visit, but I don’t want to. I’m just as angry with him as he is with me.”
Malfoy’s hands dropped to his sides. “For an ill-advisedly long amount of time.”
Harry had remained where the portkey had dropped them while Malfoy had walked off, staring into nothingness and stewing in his frustration. The thought that this would be Malfoy’s first official foray into fieldwork hadn’t crossed his mind.
Harry had nearly jumped out of his skin at the sudden movement and had only barely managed to curb his impulse to fling a hex.
Why did Malfoy have to make it so
He didn't think and he didn't pause; he launched for his wand and apparated the second his fingers closed around the wood.
The massive skull and snake had bloomed like a sickly green flower in the sky, more massive than any Harry had seen produced since the war. Men and women in skull-like masks had crawled out of every bush and dark corner, swarming them in seconds, and the light of spells had flared through the evening gloom like lightning.
“Are you absolutely sure I can’t get you anything?” Malfoy asked again. “I am quite certain there’s still some of that Firewhiskey around.”
“Hardly uncommon, in our age bracket,” Malfoy said eventually, magnanimously.
His whole bedroom had been covered by a layer of tissues at that point and, with his whole brain clogged with snot, it had taken him a couple of minutes to remember that a simple
He turned around and started walking.
“The delights of an overburdened justice system,” Malfoy had commented with a sneer, after having looked over the case file.
“It doesn’t,” Harry had assured him sharply, forgetting to deny the presence of a hero-complex altogether.
contentious about the whole thing. "He'll be certified before June and not join you before then. There’ll be no issue with his credentials."
Harry's attention had been caught by Malfoy’s fingers drumming against the file he carried.
"What for?" Malfoy asked, that little wrinkle on his nose appearing as it ever did when he thought Harry was being ridiculous.
“Potter.”
"I can't fault your tastes, I suppose," he said, mouth curling into a small smirk. "My own, on the other hand..."
Harry hadn’t even had the wherewithal to properly protest for the first couple of minutes; he’d just sat there, frozen in disbelief, mouth slightly agape.
Harry’s throat closed up; this, for some bloody reason, apparently crossing over the edge of what he was willing to admit.
“Yes, please,” Harry said, not because he particularly wanted it, but simply because it seemed like the thing to say.
Harry just about jumped out of his skin.
Harry had been so caught up in trying to figure out what the hell was the appropriate way to answer
It took a while but, eventually, Malfoy’s breath went deep and even. With him asleep, Harry dared move around enough that he could find a comfortable way to lay. It ended up being on his side, turned so that he was staring at the back of Malfoy’s head. The faint light that escaped through the cracks in the curtains was enough that he could distinguish between the light of his hair and the dark of his pillow; the black of his shirt and the paleness of his skin where the covers had slipped down.
“Potter, let me spell this out for you,” Malfoy had interrupted, tone abruptly gone a bit short. “I had discovered a vocation I wanted to go into. Something that, Merlin willing, might even help make up for some of the shit decisions I’d made previously in my life. And, through some great bloody miracle, the ministry was even willing to let me have a go at it.”
?” Harry had asked, turning to him sharply. “But they told me that you’d already been working with them before we partnered up.”
They’d been well-practiced at this point, Malfoy near perfect in anticipating his moves and adapting their guard to let Harry’s magic through. Their opponents were more skilled –
He’d flicked a wordless, wandless scourgify at Malfoys face as he reached the gate.
“Okay,” he repeated then, seeming to deflate slightly, even though some of his prickliness remained: “Well, you’re welcome to have the couch if you want, but it’s never taken transfiguration particularly well and whoever constructed it had a severely deficient grasp of what might pass for a sufficient amount of stuffing
or something, to purchase it in Diagon, then
“Fuck,” Malfoy had said behind him.
“What the- Are you
Malfoy had bent and put his briefcase on the floor, and had then proceeded to pull a bottle rack from it. Six faintly glowing flasks were lined up in it.
Harry let out a shaky exhale, the tension easing from his body.
Harry just about jumped out of his skin at Malfoy’s mumbled voice, snatching his hand back as if burnt. He stammered to find some excuse or explanation but, of course, there was none. Again.
For a moment, Harry had been mystified. Then the duel they’d had during their second year had suddenly resurfaced in his memory, and smile had turned to smirk. He’d had a taunt on his lips, something about the snake being safely behind glass and that he’d promise that he hadn’t been giving it any instructions to attack, when something in Malfoy’s eyes suddenly stopped him short.
had not been helped by the fact that the photo was one taken as a part of the criminal charges brought against Malfoy, his face looking taught and young, left arm lifting every now and again to show the camera the Dark Mark.
Harry couldn’t seem to tear his eyes away.
On the afternoon of that sixth day of suffering, he’d been sat in the kitchen, cocooned in the thickest blanked he owned, nibbling at some biscuits. His appetite always tended to go when he got sick, and he’d frowned over the stew and potatoes Kreacher had put in front of him earlier until the house-elf had removed it with a contemptuous glare. When the doorbell had rung, he’d appeared by Harry’s chair with a small
Then, one day, Harry had looked up and Draco Malfoy had been standing in the door to his office.
He hardly noticed any of it.
The words, which had slipped out so treacherously easy before, would not come now.
“Gladrags in Hogsmeade. They didn't have green but these are at least the same fabric.”
Harry could feel Draco’s body shake against him. He gently kissed his temple and swept his hair back. It was wet from a mixture of water and sweat.
Draco was skimming through the book. “I found this from
Frida leaned over Draco’s shoulder to glance at the open book laying on top of the desk.
Draco's eyes were full again.
“I think you’re absolutely beautiful.” Harry kept his eyes on him. Draco squeezed his hands harder and Harry squeezed him back.
“Just tell me Ron, I don’t know.” Harry smiled and kept his eyes on his best friend, happy to have a conversation that got him this excited.
Harry's face turned serious as he got closer to examine his thighs.
Draco's bruise looked much lighter in color but still very swollen. Both his eyes looked tender and red. Harry's thoughts went to how heartbroken he had felt watching him cry yesterday. He wanted to give him a tissue but Malfoy kept using his sleeves to dry his tears. He figured that the tears along with the rubbing was the reason why he looked sad and exhausted. He opened his case and took out a few ointments. He twisted the cap on one of them and put his middle and ring fingers in the light yellow oil. Draco looked at him quietly, not saying a word and sitting very still. Harry gently dabbed his wet fingers on the bruise and Draco twisted his head back.
“It was invented by my grandfather. I didn’t know him but this quadrupled the family’s wealth I was told,” Harry exhaled sharply, as if to laugh.
. He tried pulling himself up in a sitting position and groaned in pain and shock of how strong it hit through his lower body. “FUCK.”
“Did this other man hurt you, Draco?” Harry sounded genuinely angry.
“Potter….fuck me.” He didn’t rationalize his desires. He promised to himself he wouldn’t think. He was drunk and he didn’t care. Harry started to kiss him again, keeping his hands on his face. He wasn’t gentle this time, Draco felt his passion on every inch of his skin. Potter wanted him. Badly.
This time, Harry's mouth sank even lower at what he saw: Draco had a triangle of light brown pubic hair between his legs that lead to what was clearly female genitalia. His slightly open knees and thighs were just wide enough to show the outer labia, which was pink and shaven. A larger-than-average clitoris was also visible between them. Blood had stained the entire area and more trickled down from his stomach when his shirt was finally lifted. Harry looked up to see Draco's pale and hairless chest. There was no sign of damage here expect for the two pink straight lines below his pectorals. The thick scars were clearly old; even if the color and tenderness made it seem otherwise. His nipples were a darker pink and perked out of his inch-wide areolas.
I didn't waste two seconds upon hearing Parkinson's screaming.
Harry locked the door behind the small office. He leaned over the desk and touched his groin. He was internally sweating the entire time while rubbing the potion onto Draco's legs. He knew he'd gotten very hard and it took all the power in him to keep a calm, undisturbed face. Draco had well-toned, lightly muscular legs with soft blond hair that covered them moderately. And when he took his shirt off, he thought he would have to run out. His broad shoulders, round biceps, and forearms covered with the same blond hair kept Harry staring. His eyes had gone to his nipples once more, hard again and the same shade of pink as his lips. Draco looked very upset and Harry sensed his guilt. He felt ridiculously protective and like he would do anything to stop his grief.
“Well, thank you for this,” Harry said, holding up the potion bottle. “How much can I give you for it?”
“Here, I got it,” Harry said, giving him a plate. “Draco...I’m curious. You have a midwife that you like?”
“Let’s start opening the shop and re-stock some items,” he said, in a steely voice.
When he arrived at his shop the following morning, he saw a long branch of jasmines laying down on the counter. Potter’s graciousness made him smile. He took the flowers to the back room.
“He's crying?”
“Okay.”
Draco’s eyes widened in panic and shock.
___________
“Draco, enough. Its done and over with. Please accept them as gifts, alright?”
“Because maybe it’s true. Take the potions and go. Get some sleep,” he said gently, turning his piercing gaze back to Harry. “I hate pain. I’m sure you do, too. Goodnight, Potter. It was nice seeing you.” Draco went back inside the small room where he had come from. He shut the door behind him and lights appeared from the bottom gap.
Harry came up and starting kissing him, not moving his penis at all, giving Draco time to adjust. He played with his nipples, softly twisting them, and getting sounds of pleasure from Draco's throat.
“I didn’t have sex with anyone else, Harry. The baby is yours.”
“I’m in labor.” Draco didn’t move. He had a hand on his belly and closed his eyes again.
“That’s alright. It isn’t a sin.”
“Hello again, Potter.” This time, Draco didn’t look at him for very long. He kept his concentration on wrapping the bottles Harry had placed on the counter in front of him. There were two bottles of
Harry’s eyes bulged out of their sockets, staring directly at Draco.
Draco didn’t go into work the following day. He bought more things for his baby and cleaned his flat. As eight o’clock was nearing, Potter came to his mind. He thought maybe he’d be visiting at this time. He was tempted to go downstairs and see, but quickly changed his mind. What if he didn’t come tonight? What if Draco was getting hopeful again, which always led to disappointment. He sat down at his dining table, taking out a quill, ink and parchment. He decided to write to him instead.
“Alright….fine. That’s fine. You were both drunk. I know you’re attracted to blokes and I have to be more understanding of that...so,” he went back to picking food off the table.
“Did you use your own money or the hospital's for the clothes?”
He stepped in his living room, holding a small bottle in his hand. “I had to take a hangover potion, do you wa-”
The day had fallen into night. Draco had asked to get out of the water and was now back on the floor of his bedroom on all fours. Harry was rubbing his back, and continued to squeeze his hands when his contractions hit. Vasilia was checking his progress from behind.
“I don't have one either. I haven't had the chance to develop any sort of attraction pattern. Most of the time, it never gets far enough. Either I get nervous and back out, or when they know about, you know, my 'identity,' they back out themselves.”
“Why are you being so kind and civilized, Potter?”
“How did it go, lad? What did she say?!”
“You’re not obligated to talk to me, Potter. We’re hardly friends.”
“What do you remember? We're going to report this...” Potter continued.
“Yes,” Malfoy said, looking up at him as he put the quill back. “We’re required to sign for controlled potions. You’re an auror, right?”
“I brought you some chocolate croissants.”
“Forget it. Its fine,” Harry replied, quite civilly.
Harry looked genuinely shocked at his question.
“Take your jumper off, Malfoy, it looks suffocating.” Draco chuckled and rolled up the ends of his sweater over his head, throwing it on the floor next to Harry’s discarded jacket. His erect nipples appeared behind his cotton undershirt, which came to Harry’s attention immediately.
“I’m going to restock some items, dear!” Frida called out, walking to the back room.
“Harry…..look at her.” Harry was gently feeling the baby’s forehead with his middle finger, looking mesmerized and relieved.
“You’re enough. You’re better than most.” Draco started to rub the top part of his belly. Harry was watching him, captivated.
“Oh you sly, sly fox you!” She blurted out, laughing.
“Have a seat,” he walked past Harry and set the tray on the coffee table between two sofas, Potter sitting across from him.
“Yeah. I think he was flirting,” Draco smirked.
“Yeah...I just ...sorry I...really needed-”
Frida started to laugh, shaking her head in knowledge and understanding.
“Can I help you find something?”
Draco nodded. “I’m grateful to have Frida, for those days where a potion might be an absolute disaster and fuck with me massively.” He turned back to polishing the money register.
“That’s my own herbal mixture,” Malfoy nodded to the object inside Harry’s hand, polishing some glass bottles with a white flannel as he spoke. “Since it works through smell, it goes straight to your head and the effect is immediate. It won’t replace the potion though, which will last much longer in your system.”
“Potter…..hi. Um..”
“No. Don’t stop. Just….slow down.” He looked at Harry and ran his fingers through his hair again. Harry looked down at him.
“That’s rubbish, you’re thinking something!”
Draco pulled his knees slowly towards his chest once more, helping Harry to move. He felt more lube around his rim and Potter started to pull on his cock, which gave relief to the pain that was now dissipating.
Harry was looking straight at him. “Would you like to come over to my place? Have some drinks?”
“Oh FUCK! That feels amazing. Harry.....”
“Fuck, Malfoy, you’re so fucking hot, I’m going to come so soon.” Harry was pushing more aggressively against him, pushing Draco’s knees far into this chest.
Their orgasms came to a hilt at the same time, both men groaning and panting loudly, Harry's head falling onto Draco's chest. Harry kissed Draco again, carding his fingers through his hair. “You're so fucking gorgeous. That was incredible.”
“You just had ice cream, Jaz. Plus, we get to see your Papa now, remember?”
“I know the wizarding world hates talking about these issues. And you're the first transgender magical person I've come across so far. Are you friends with any others?”
“So you both know?” Draco's tears continued to fall. From pain and from anger.
Draco took a deep breath and sighed loudly, slamming the register with more force than required. Maybe there was nothing to be afraid of. Maybe Potter might never come back again. Maybe he really did need
“I want to get inside my bed," Draco frailly whimpered. As soon as they got him there, Vasilia started to check him again.
Harry pressed his warm, smooth lips on Draco’s wet ones. He slowly pushed his tongue inside, and Draco immediately took it with his own. He moaned in pleasure and disbelief. He was kissing Harry Potter and couldn’t get himself to stop. He grabbed the collars of Harry’s denim jacket, pushing them back.
He apparated right on the spot, leaving Harry with more hope than he had felt for a long time.
“Let me get the tea.” Harry needed a reason to leave for a moment. He didn’t completely understand why but, all of a sudden, he had an urge to protect Draco. His bit of anxiety made him want to further take care of him, comfort him, and shield him from any possible harm or danger.
“I fucked Harry Potter. He fucked me, to be exact. Sorry to be so blunt and crude, Frida, I’m still recovering from the whole ordeal.” He downed an entire bottle of hangover potion in one gulp, squinting his eyes tightly from the strong, bitter taste.
“Frida, please! Keep your voice down,” Draco kindly whispered, as he rubbed his head. The potion hadn’t taken his throbbing headache away completely yet.
potion was now behind the glass cabinet. The days went by normally, and though he was still hurt and disappointed that Potter never showed up, he knew time would heal his wounds. It was better this way. It was better than seeing him and getting his hopes up.
"I found her!” Frida squealed excitedly. “Annnnnd…..I even owled her for you! She was so thrilled to hear from me, though I broke her sweet little heart when I told her I now haunted this store, but she is very much looking forward to meeting you, lad! Her Floo address is in the letter she sent.” Frida handed Draco a rolled up parchment that smelled faintly of rose and frankincense.
“That feels so good.”
“Yes, I have it. One second.” Malfoy’s movements were neat and gentle as he opened the glass cabinet behind him to find “
“I didn't apply the potion as good as you do,” Draco said, a little too sadly for Harry's ears.
Harry pulled off Draco's pants completely and put his mouth on his penis. It was two inches long and felt so perfect between Harry's lips. He licked underneath it and heard Draco moan loudly. He wanted to see him orgasm. He wanted to witness his vulnerability.
“Did you leave this here last night?”
,” he spoke while he signed the bottom line of the prescription with a bright red quill.
“I'm sorry too, Potter. You've showed nothing but kindness since I've been here, and I've snapped at you twice already. I'm sorry, I'm on edge, I can't think straight.”
Draco held his breath in surprise. He stood up slowly, waddling his way towards the corridor. “I’m coming.” He unlocked the door with his wand and saw a disheveled looking Harry Potter carrying a large paper bag and the same type of white box from a week ago.
“Draco, wait!” Harry made his way over to him, grabbing his elbow gently yet firmly and turned him around. He laid one hand behind Draco's head and the other on his cheek, running his thumb again against his jaw, up and down, stroking his soft stubble, looking intently into his eyes.
Harry started to palm Draco’s erect cock, his thumb on the head. Draco knew he was completely undone.
“No, I don’t.” He took another sip. “You have a girlfriend?”
Draco's breathing was rough and labored, even with the help of spells and charms placed around his nose and chest. I was told he'd still be in some pain, as the potions given were only strong enough to take care of the major damages.
“How is he?” I asked hoarsely. “Has he improved?”
“Does it ever move?” He asked.
“He’s in the back, dear, let me take you.”
“Harry….go faster.” Now it was all pleasure and he wanted more of what he was getting. He felt Harry down to the base, and gave a loud moan.
“Hey Frida.” His voice was hoarse and pained. He walked straight inside the back room, Frida floating behind him.
“You don't have to read every word...”
Harry heard the sound of his Floo when he was still in the kitchen. He had prepared some simple hors d’oeuvres while anxiously hoping that Malfoy would actually show up. His stomach twisted in nervous excitement as he took out a couple of drinking glasses, firewhiskey, and a bottle of brandy.
“You’ll be shocked. You might not even believe it.”
Draco looked down at his body. He wanted Potter's touch.
He hadn't felt this lonely for a long time.
“What’s on your mind?”
“I have something that might help,” Harry replied, turning to rummage through the potion cabinet next to the mirror. He walked over to Draco with a bottle and a wooden comb. He put them on the corner of the tub, moved a small stool right near the edge, and sat down. Draco picked up the bottle and read the label to himself.
“Please don’t remind me,” Draco cut in, putting his elbows on the desk and resting his head in his hands.
“Should I call your midwife?”
“Well, that all depends. I think you should open the cage and let them fly. But nobody ever said to stop loving them while they are free. To shower them with food, and gifts, and songs, and shelter. You let the bird go, and they might think you don’t want to remain loyal any longer. You must show them you still love them outside of that cage.”
“Yes,” Harry didn’t waste a second. Draco knew he was just as pissed as he was when his trousers came off too. He started to fondle with Draco’s front button and zipper.
“He's still allowed to find you attractive,” Draco replied.
Harry walked out of the room. Draco took some potion out of the bottle and rubbed it all over his lower stomach, with none of the loving, careful attention that he had felt from Harry.
“No, no,” Harry shook his head. “The healer confirmed it wasn’t that. She said it’s from stress and pressure. Not getting enough sleep, all that stuff.”
Harry grabbed Draco's elbow and gently pulled him up as Draco grabbed him back; gripping his upper arm. Potter smelled divine. Like pine and vanilla and the fresh morning after a rainy night. Draco closed his eyes and breathed him in while trying to find his balance through the pain.
“He’s getting water. He’s very worried about you. He just asked me a few questions.”
Harry walked quickly towards the loo and looked around as he relieved his bladder. Draco’s flat was modest and clean. He didn’t have much decor but everything was tidy and organized. Harry particularly liked the clawfoot bathtub in the corner. The small window above the sink was splashing sunlight right onto it. When he left, his curiosity made him take a quick peek at the bedroom to his right. The door had been left open and Harry only took a couple of steps in to look around. Next to Draco’s bed was a wooden crib and a drawer with a nappy-changing station. A mobile with a variety of magical creatures hung from the edge of the crib. There was a phonograph in one corner and a large area rug in swirls of blue and green. Above Draco’s bed, the large branch of jasmines Harry had left at the shop was laid out on the headboard. This made him smile, but his heart twisted at the fact that Draco would be alone with his baby. He felt proud that the man had done all this by himself, welcoming his child with so much love and attention.
Ron’s mouth dropped. “Holy shit…..” He covered his mouth to avoid saying anything anyone might hear. Harry nodded and looked down.
Great. They couldn't do the later part of the “9 -11 am” time slot. He needed tea. And a shower. He skipped the bathroom and walked downstairs, tying his robe around himself as he reached the last stair. Potter stood in front of his fireplace, looking disheveled, yet composed at the same time. Draco swallowed as he stared at Potter's muscular arms and legs, covered by a tight-fitting crimson jacket and trousers. Harry swallowed back, deepening his frown and looked down; kicking pieces of ash off his black, polished shoes.
Harry touched his nose to Draco's, kissing him and saying, “You stop me anytime, alright? Anytime you want.” Draco kissed him in acknowledgment.
“Hm?” Draco opened his eyes right away.
They both looked down at the two, delicate white cups, which were never touched.
It seemed like Potter needed more information after all.
“I missed you,” Draco whispered to him.
“Thank you, Potter.” Draco’s voice was gentle and quiet. Harry wondered how long he had been like this.
“Mr. Potter, I’m so sorry sir, we are closed,” Frida tried to keep her voice as kind as possible.
“Male conception potion? Why, I thought you couldn’t find anything like this in England.”
“I was, yes. A long time ago.”
“No, I can't. I'd give too much of myself away and even my closest friends don't know. Its not that important. Plus, we have a patient/healer relationship now and it would be very awkward.”
“No.....just...go slow, you're fine.”
“Here, take some of this.” Harry handed him a pain potion. “Its not a strong dose, just enough to take the edge off. I don't want you too drowsy,” he laughed.
“You know I’ve been going to Malfoy’s shop. Well, I haven’t gone in weeks, but I visited often at one point.”
“Um...I…..I don’t know, Malfoy.”
“Oh yes, I think so. Draco!” She called out to the open door behind her. “Two bottles of
Harry gave a lazy smile and pressed his lips to his forehead. As a pulled away, Draco laid still, with a watery, worried gaze in his eyes.
Harry hesitated before saying the next words. “I really do….you make me feel a lot of things, Draco. I can’t stop coming in to see you. You’ve got me all….all….wound up. Inside.” Harry’s voice was soft and sultry, and Draco had to close his eyes to keep himself steady. Not only was he drunk on brandy and whiskey, but Potter’s words were also intoxicating him. That and his hand on his shoulder. Draco knew he should pull away, but he couldn’t. He felt himself getting warmer.
“I don’t want to take up any more of your time if you have an early day tomorrow,” Draco spoke, yawning and slightly stretching his body, his head now definitely touching Harry’s fingertips. Harry waited until Draco realized this and expected him to move away, but he didn’t.
“About time you did something you want. Fuck what others think, that includes me.”
“Exactly! He has no shame, right? Showing his face again around here. Should’ve stayed wherever the fuck they went.”
“I’ll do it,” Draco groaned. All articles of clothing were now a heap on the floor, entangled and wrapped around together. Draco noticed that Harry had an erection as well. He could stop now, put an end to this, apologize for drinking more than his fair share, be the level-headed, rational man that he’d always been, and get inside his own warm bed in his flat, and feel safe away from other people. That had been his reality for years. He’d kept his deep, subconscious desires at bay by re-focusing his mind on other matters, on his job, his inventions, his creations, and not stepping out of line in legal matters. He’d behaved well, kept his boundaries within reasonable limits, disciplined himself to be civil and distant. That was all before Harry Potter showed up and fucked with his head, opened up that secret chamber inside of his heart and managed to unlock the one place he’d suppressed for so long. He knew Potter didn’t feel the same way back, there was no way. There was no way he could have the depth of attraction and passion that Draco had felt for him all these years, only to intensify once he saw him again. He decided he shouldn’t care. It did not matter. Right now, he was going to enjoy this lustful moment with Potter, even if they never saw each other again.
“I wasn't offering a full breakfast.”
Draco shook his head. “Use….use your…..cock.” He panted his way through his words.
“Fuck, Harry....fuck me.”
“Room 108! Clear out room 108!” He heard the ward manager, Healer Modley, yell across the corridor. Harry ran toward the room, took out his wand and cleared everything to its proper place. He'd only had a small handful of emergency situations since being asked to cover the night shifts at this ward.
“I'm hoping they will with time and more dittany.” He picked up one of Draco's legs and slowly bent it back toward his stomach. “Let me know if it hurts too much and I'll stop.”
Modley entered the room with a patient file in his hands. Harry's heart sank. Something wasn't right.
Ron paused, slowly sipping his drink and waited a while to answer back to Harry after putting his mug down.
“Thank you, Frida. Maybe one day. But let’s forget Harry Potter. He’s way out of my league. It was just one night and it was just sex. It won’t ever be anything more, and I’ll never do that with him again.” He looked around the room at some shelves, his eyes wet with unshed tears.
Malfoy stood at the counter a few feet away from Frida.
Jasmine jumped out of Draco's arms and ran towards the old man.
“Will you be seeing him again?” Frida asked, hovering next to him.
Harry looked at him with compassion and a bit of sorrow.
Harry laughed.
Draco knew this wasn’t going to go anywhere.
He could still smell Potter. Incense and vanilla and cinnamon and those arms and legs and hands. Bright emerald eyes piercing inside his head. He fell against the wall as he heard the floo take Harry away, and softly landed himself unto the floor. Painful tears rolled down his face.
“I don’t know either, Potter.”
Harry didn’t know what to say.
“I can take the next customer,” he called out, not looking at anyone in particular.
“Yes,” Draco sighed, loudly.
“We have the time!”
His face, paler than usual, was patched with dark blue and purple bruises, blood seeping through the cotton guaze on his left cheekbone. I slowly laid my hand on his forehead and swept away his hair sticking to his moist skin. His swollen eyelids and wet lashes twitched with my touch, and I couldn’t help to softly put my lips to his temple.
Draco slowly opened his eyes to a bright room that smelled like metal and bleach. His brain felt numb but his entire body was in pain. He was able to somewhat cope because of the dazed sensation inside his head. His blurry vision came almost to focus when he saw a dark-haired man enter from the door right across the bed he was lying in.
“Oh, it stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender.”
“That will be two galleons and a sickle, good sir! And a bag of Fizzing Whisbees for the children,” she exclaimed enthusiastically, handing the man a bag of the
“Good for you, Harry. You’re so forgiving. But I’m not like you. I’m not Jesus Christ.”
“Hi, Potter. Thank you for these. How can I help you?” He was happy that his tone sounded genuinely friendly without a single sound of the resentment he felt a few months ago.
“Draco,” I whispered.
“Potter, I....I mean, thank you. Where did you find them?”
There were a few customers at every corner, chatting among themselves quietly and pointing to whatever struck their curiosity. There wasn’t any sign of Malfoy or anyone else overseeing the store.
“Tea?” Draco raised his eyebrows, astounded.
“Not yet, but almost.”
“Draco? You alright, dear?”
“Its a long sto-
“Are my hands too cold?” He kept his tone as calm and collected as possible.
“Yes...thank you for your hospitality.”
It hadn't been five minutes into their conversation at the bar when Draco had followed him outside to apparate to the stranger’s flat.
“Where do you get these jasmines?” Draco’s voice stopped him from walking. He turned to face him again.
“I suppose,” Malfoy replied, taking his eyes away from Harry. “Very Slytherin of you to think that.” Harry chuckled at this. “I’m not going to risk illegal potion business, Potter, even if I did need the money. Living in fear and paranoia is no way to live.”
Draco gave her a weak smile. He sat down at his desk, looking over his inventory for the following month.
“You didn't do anything wrong and you're not a freak! You don't owe anyone an explanation either. Ever. In any situation. And non of what happened was your fault.” Potter's voice changed at this. He sounded like he himself was offended.
This made Harry come not too long after. The sounds coming out of Draco’s mouth, the smaller moans which were like soft, delicate sobs after his initial scream, completely made Harry lose his mind.
. He told himself.
“I haven’t forgotten. At least Draco apologised. Maybe he’s better than his parents.”
“Just got some things to replace the ones you had,” he said as Draco unwrapped the brown tissue paper off of a pair of navy blue velvet trousers.
Harry stood up and straightened his belt back to its proper position.
He touched the tip of his nose to Draco's for a few seconds before pressing his lips to his, tasting the salt of his tears. Draco kissed him back with much more fervor and Harry wanted to remember this. This kiss that silently spoke a promise to never leave one another. This kiss that would end the rigidity of Draco's life and the unstable remoteness of his. This kiss that would begin their new freedom.
“Sorry, I’m sorry,” Potter slurred his words, resting his head on Draco’s chest. “We can stop if you want.”
“Are you serious? You hate him.”
“Thanks, Potter.”
“So, how does this work, exactly? I leave this prescription for you to mail back?”
“What’s going on?” Ron asked, taking a bite of a bread roll.
“Nothing..”
“Oh my dear….you think I was some nice little lady during my living years, don’t you? No, no, no, the Frida that you know and love has had her fair share of adventures in vice. Not just virtue, my dear.”
“Don’t be silly, dear! You know I can handle the shop all on my own,” she said, giving him a dramatic wink.
Harry knocked on the door, holding a white bakery box.
“That’s not what I want. I don’t just want another father to randomly come in whenever he feels like it. I want a family. A whole one, not a broken one. Potter doesn’t like me like that. I want the chance to have someone who will, then we can raise the child together.”
“Oh, and your clothes are washed. I left them on your bed. I also set out some extra clothes and pajamas for you.”
“You want…..tea.” Draco stated, with no hint of a question.
“I have, apparently,” he said proudly, squashing the hurt deep inside his stomach. “After all, you are here, the saviour of our world, sitting in my own living room, doing me a great, tremendous favour by returning my rights to practice magic without constraints. How did I become so lucky?”
“Let me check you, Drakon.” Vasilia was between Draco’s legs, one hand on his knee and another which looked like it was going somewhere inside him.
“Draco c’mon..” Harry looked exasperated. Draco silently continued to clean.
“Was I supposed to stay? You know how many men have left and walked out on me? That’s how it works, doesn’t it?”
Harry saw him walk towards the loo. He picked up the book that Draco had been reading. It looked well over a century old, if not older. The binding had been repaired quite a few times.
Harry returned to the store the following day carrying a handful of jasmine sprigs. He was a bit relieved to see that there weren’t too many people here at the moment, and saw Draco sitting behind the counter, reading a book. When he spotted Harry, he put down the book immediately, the cover facing down. He stood up and took out his white flannel. By now, Harry understood why Draco always did this when he saw him.
Draco was silent. He willed himself to not feel, to not cry, to not push Potter off his chair and run out the door. Even if he had to crawl.
The thrusting sped up, and Harry was hitting his spot every single time he rammed into him. Draco was seeing stars.
“I am. I’m alright though. I’m worried for him.”
“He’s only three. He’s a Snowy, like my old one.”
“Alright,” was all Potter said, and Draco slowly looked up at him for the first time.
“Go to the living room, I’ll be back in a sec.” Draco told him, walking away.
“Uh, no, I don't think so. There's a rule against dating people you work with. And he's straight,” Harry laughed quietly.
“Yeah, um...that herbal pouch you made...it’s great. Smells good. And I thought….maybe you made teas similar to those things.”
“This is for your child?”
Peter leaned down next to Harry, his presence calm and gentle. “That’s actually perfect. There’s a spot here,” he pointed to a place in the middle of Draco’s lower back, “if you apply pressure, it gives some natural relief. Use your knuckles.” Harry did what Peter demonstrated, looking around to see how Draco was reacting to this. He looked beautifully peaceful. Letting air out of his mouth and keeping his eyes shut.
“Potter….I,” he tried to speak, but his words were getting lost somewhere inside his chest. His head felt numb and for the very first time in a very long time, he wasn’t thinking. He remembered Frida telling him not to think. And it felt so good to be able to just let go.
“Why would I do that, Potter?”
