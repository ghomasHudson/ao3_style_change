“So, what are you two talking about?” Weasley asked as he settled down a few feet from where they were. “Kreacher’ll bring up a plate for you all too,” he added.
Potter seemed to take this as an invitation and moved to place hot, open mouthed kisses along the length of Draco’s neck, moving upwards until he came to the particularly sensitive patch of skin behind his ear. Draco shuddered as Potter began to torturously lick the spot before sucking it into his mouth, reducing Draco to a whimpering mess. He found himself rutting helplessly against Potter, not caring if he showed his desperation, his whole body thrumming with desire. Potter ran his hands along the length of Draco’s back until he settled on cupping his arse, pulling him harshly closer and holding him in place as he grinded deliciously back against him.
Draco glared. “I’ll have you know, I made the team fair and square. Higgs was due to retire anyways and apart from a couple of third years who could hardly fly a broom straight, I was the only decent flyer who applied for seeker.”
James hurried after his brother, his trunk levitating haphazardly behind him and Lily followed him, still going on about James’ unsuccessful dating portfolio. Harry went up after them, wanting to make sure that they wouldn’t start fighting. They’d re-plastered the walls and he obviously didn’t want damages their first day back.
With that she left the room and Draco sat back down with a thump, his legs suddenly feeling weak. Rose regarded him with a searching look.
furniture. But there are a few rooms that I haven’t been able to deal with yet – namely the library and attic. It turns out they’ve been infused with old magic, some of it Dark, and since I’m not a true Black heir, I haven’t been able to deal with them. The house doesn’t recognise me as its rightful owner yet.”
“Next time, just come with me,” Harry says wryly, “instead of appearing behind me like a fucking spectre. You’re so pale too.”
“Makes you wonder what she did to get off so easily,” Thin Lips continued. “Probably whored herself off to gain the favour of the Wizengamot. Tell me, does your husband know what you’ve been up to while he’s off in Azkaban? Or perhaps it was his idea in the first place? Did the plan include obtaining pardon for him as well?”
Left behind, Draco went down to the kitchen to get their customary welcome-home milkshakes. Kreacher had already left them ready on the table so all he had to do was lift the cooling charms and carry them back up with him. He reminded the house elf to make a fresh batch of sugar cookies too. Ginny would be along for supper and her twins simply adored them. Their father wasn’t too far off in his love for them either, and Harry often wondered aloud if Daniel was such a quick Seeker because he practically ran on sugar.
“Mama…” Draco hadn’t called her that since he was six years old but his mother made no comment about it, instead taking him into her arms and holding him close. A light weight landed on his shoulder and soon he had a crooning owl snuggling up to him as well.
“Okay, okay. Let’s all just calm down first,” Pansy said in a rush, more to herself than anyone else. “Draco,
Minutes pass and Draco has yet to say a word but Harry refuses to sabotage his own trick by opening his eyes. Eventually though, there is what sounds like a muffled sob and a small thump. Harry finally allows himself to open one eye, just a crack to see what is going on, but what he sees makes his breath hitch and both his eyes shoot open.
The blush that had finally begun to subside came back in full force and Draco could have decked Potter right then and there. “How. Dare. You.”
“What do you mean ‘by now’, Mother?” he asked sharply. His eyes widened when she deliberately schooled her face into an indifferent mask. Having done so himself on many occasions, he knew
Draco seems to pull himself together then and shakes his head. “I’ll stay here. I have my wand and really,” he sniffs, “it’s just a Muggle film.”
Draco snapped his fingers, a thought crossing his mind. “You know how most magical toys already have the magic implemented into their design, and that’s how they run on their own? Well, I remember some of my old toys weren’t like that, and Mother would have to add her own magic to get them to work. If she forgot to replenish their stores, they’d stop working when all the magic was used up.”
arse cheeks and he quickly got to his knees, hands instinctively grabbing at his backside in a most undignified way. Apparently she wasn’t a mirage after all.
Potter looked stunned by Draco’s sudden attack but then his eyes flared in a familiarly challenging way and he jutted his chin out belligerently. “I wouldn’t say I was ‘too good’, but yeah, Slytherin didn’t seem like an attractive prospect.” He shot Draco a cool look. “Not to mention,
“He wasn’t trying to prank me,” Draco answered truthfully. “We were all just… talking.” He couldn’t help blushing again as he remembered
“Hermione calls it that too.” Potter sighed. “So, we joined up and eight months later we graduated from the academy. It took us two years to round them all up but even afterwards, there was always some wannabee dark wizard cropping up on a daily basis. Kept us busy. At the time, I’d also started dating Ginny again.”
“Caught the first Portkey we could and got here about half an hour after he told us what happened,” Blaise answered glibly.
“I’m single,” Draco interrupted in a rush, defensiveness creeping into his confession as he added, “It’s not really easy to meet someone when I never go out. Makes it even less easy when I have a bloody Mark on my arm.”
The owl seemed to delight in offering his opinion about everything and everyone, going so far as to engage the house elves in one-sided conversations; hooting away while the house elf in question stared at him as if he was a wonder of the world. He also appeared to be somewhat of a snob, as was clearly seen when Draco tried to call him such things like ‘Pipsqueak’ or ‘Teeny’. For some reason, he hadn’t seen the logic in those names and had only given Draco disdainful hoots and contemptuous looks in response, along with the deliberate ruin of his seventh favourite pair of boots.
Suddenly there was a loud crash from the house and they sprang apart as if shot. Draco slumped against the wall, not trusting his trembling legs to hold himself up anymore. He looked up to find Potter in a similar state, leaning heavily against the porch railing.
interested,” Draco replied with as much confidence as he could muster. “But there wasn’t anything I could do about it when I thought you were dating Ginny.”
heritage,” Potter cut in harshly, shooting him an annoyed look that had Draco drawing back in consternation. He’d grown unaccustomed to such expressions directed his way. He probably should have left off then but the thought of something happening to the tapestry was excruciating.
Draco sniffed. “It might surprise you to hear this, but not all of us want to bask off the power of your name.”
“Pansy, are you– Sweet mother of Merlin!” He hurriedly retracted his head and tried to shake the image of his best friend getting thoroughly buggered by some tanned Adonis of a bloke. Grimacing as the shock wore off, he grabbed another pinch of powder and threw it into the grate again.
His mother turned to him. “Did you try one?” she asked eagerly, wringing her hands together. Draco obligingly took a cookie off the top of the pile and broke off a piece. He popped it into his mouth and instantly sighed in pleasure.
James seemed to understand this logic and nodded. He held out his hand which Draco solemnly clasped. “Hullo, it’s nice to meet you. I’m Mr James Sirius Potter.”
Harry is trying his best to keep them both balanced on the tiny kitchen chair they are currently standing on, and Draco shaking him is certainly not helping.
know that everyone at Hogwarts knew about your little crush on her,” Draco replied with an incredulous frown. “You were
“Oh Merlin, no. It caught me right on the arm. If Hagrid hadn’t stepped in after it slashed me, I might not be here today. Our matron Madam Pomfrey was able to heal it in the end but I still had to wear a sling.”
territory. Before he could make his escape though, Luna was already dragging him to the front door. She knocked loudly on it and took a step back.
Harry rolls his eyes at Draco’s dramatics. “We don’t have to kill it; we just need to get to our wands and then we can change it back to normal and get it out of the house.”
Ginevra gave him a friendly push. “Harry got frustrated with you avoiding him so he went to get some apples from the orchard.” She pointed to a small path leading into a copse of trees. “Go get him.”
Mercury hooted loudly and angrily, suddenly jumping into the fray with vengeance. He dove at Potter’s head with talons extended, making a great racket, and soon Potter was too busy trying to fend off the irate owl to hold Draco’s arms down any longer. Draco tried to scramble out from under him, but Potter’s thighs were still steadfastly clamped down on his own, and he couldn’t budge. Not to mention, with the way Potter’s arms were flaying about like mad, Draco feared a cuff to the head.
“Do you make it a habit of giving up on projects you’ve taken over?” Granger raised a brow impressively. “If I recall, you’re usually more tenacious than this.”
“Actually,” Potter called down to Bob. “I was hoping I could get a bag of the deluxe mixed flavour pellets.”
“I was the one who gave you the book. I wasn’t paying attention and you ended up hurt, and even then all I did was gape like an idiot and I couldn’t even cast a Patronus and–”
“The problem wasn’t that he wasn’t holding the broom properly.” Draco explained patiently. “It was that his tightened grip made him seem unsure of his movements which made the broom not respond to his touch as well as it should have.”
Potter snickered. “You should have told us to keep some for you. How were we supposed to know you wanted biscuits?”
When he reaches out to the trip for the third time, he isn’t even surprised when he hears the sound. This time he turns with a scoff, fully expecting to see nothing again since apparently he’s going crazy and is hearing unidentifiable sounds now. Instead, Harry chokes on his spit and jumps back so fast he bangs the back of his head hard on the wall.
Draco felt like he’d just burst into flames and he made a grab at his bedpost as his legs went wobbly. “Potter, you have to know that I didn’t mean to–”
“There there,” he crooned in his best cheer-up-and-kindly-get-the-fuck-off-me voice. He tried to remember how his mother had comforted him when he was little. “It’s going to be alright. You’re a big boy after all, and big boys don’t cry.” Merlin, he was glad no one was around to see this little exchange.
” He looked pained now and his voice had lost all traces of anger. “You called me Harry, and you looked at me like you actually cared. Like you wanted me as much as I want you and I was stupid enough to hope. And now? Now I think I’m falling in love with you, you’re all I ever think of and it hurts so fucking much when I’m not with you. But you made your feelings all too clear and I get it. After all, how could someone as beautiful as you love me? Yeah, I get it and I –”
Draco shut him up the only way he could, pouncing on Harry and crashing their mouths together so hard that their teeth clashed painfully. At first Harry was frozen in shock but he soon melted into it and kissed back with just as much abandon. They were both panting and uncomfortably hard when they broke away and Draco knew he was grinning like a complete loon.
. In that split second of thought, everything seemed to fall into place and Draco felt his mouth curl into a smile.
Draco poured himself a cup of tea and added a dollop of milk and heaps of sugar. “It would seem so.”
Draco smiled fondly as he thought of his mother’s pretty smile, much more apparent these past months. “She used to smile a lot more when I was small. Things changed after that.”
Kreacher was busily cooking something up on the stove, and whatever it was, it smelt absolutely divine. Draco could feel his mouth watering and he wondered what his mother had requested for dinner. He hoped Potter let him leave soon.
“They can have it by tomorrow, yes?” Draco asked and pushed the pile of books away from him. “Enough sorting for today.”
Potter came straight up to the counter, ignoring Draco as he did so. “Could I have some owl pellets, please?”
“The house looks fabulous,” he says, practically preening as they stand on the sidewalk surveying their work. Harry has to admit, Draco’s outdone himself. He’s liberally conjured fake cobwebs and spiders as well, and has managed to create one of the most tasteful Halloween houses Harry’s ever seen. It sure beats the house on their left, with splashes of red paint all over the lawn, probably meant to look like spilt blood.
“Only because I’m tired,” he reminded Potter as they sat side by side at the long stone table in the kitchens, munching on the best chocolate chip cookies Draco had ever had in his life. He’d make sure to send one of the Manor elves to get the recipe from Kreacher as soon as possible. “Don’t think it’ll happen again.”
Draco found himself nodding at that. “She’s like a bustling hen with the presence of a mad Bludger when she gets going. And she has this way of making you feel like a child when she scolds you.”
Potter moved to stand beside him, his hip resting casually on the countertop. “I wouldn’t say ‘property’. You’re really more of a gift.” He stroked back a lock hair that had fallen over Draco’s forehead and gently tucked it behind his ear. Draco did his best to suppress a shiver. Bloody Potter.
“So you received it after all.” Potter said when he finally tore his eyes away from the hawthorn wand.
great,” Weasley grumbled and then grunted when he got a sharp jab in the ribs from Granger. “Come on, ‘Mione. I’m sure Harry agrees with me, right, mate?”
He made his way to the wardrobe and contemplated what he should wear. He wasn’t sure if he was supposed to be dressed in robes or Muggle attire.
“Goodnight Draco.” Potter said softly with a smile, letting go off his hands and taking a step back.
“So it was my very first Care of Magical Beasts class.” he began. “All us third years had been asked to meet Hagrid near the edge of the Forbidden Forest.”
when he’d brought it on himself, but it still did. He hadn’t heard from Ginny either, and the dissolution of their friendship was clear evidence that the Fates had a sick sense of irony.
Harry sighs and proceeds to clean the pumpkins as instructed. It’s tiring work but he gets it done in the end, and twenty four pumpkins and an hour later, Draco is satisfied.
“Malfoy, stop.” Potter placed a surprisingly gentle hand over Draco’s and stilled his motion, voice softening. “Can we not fight? I’m sorry I got angry.”
They came to the front door and Draco gave a firm knock. Almost immediately it was opened and for a moment Draco wondered if his Aunt Bellatrix was standing before him. On closer inspection he saw that this witch was taller, and held herself with a grace that reminded him of his mother. While Bellatrix’ hair was always a mess and her eyes glittered with cruelty and madness, Aunt Andromeda’s dark hair was pulled back into an elegant bun and her eyes were gentle and kind.
Draco swallowed hard. “Well… I just mulled about the Manor. Nothing special.” He wished fervently that Charlie would drop the questions.
Draco doesn’t make him wait long, the Floo flaring up about ten minutes later. Harry forces himself to lie limp even though all he wants to do is tense in anticipation as he listens to Draco stepping out of the fireplace and dusting at his clothes.
She didn’t try to hex me at all and we managed a civilised conversation. She says I’ve gotten paler,” he added with a frown.
“You didn’t have to come all this way, you know,” Pansy spoke up first. “Draco was just getting ready to visit Potter himself.”
He wasn’t sure how long he lay there, staring unseeingly at the ceiling. It could have been a few minutes or an hour for all he knew, but he was eventually jerked out of his purposeless vigil when his door slammed open louder than it had ever been slammed before – and that door had already been slammed
Draco actually apologizes for the snake incident, that night itself in fact, and that is probably why Harry stupidly believes he won’t try another trick on him again. He’s sadly mistaken of course, but he takes some amount of pleasure in the fact that Draco suffers through this one just as much as he does.
“Malfoy, look at me.” He waited until Draco did so before he continued. “I’m not trying to push you, I swear. It’s just, there’s something between us, right? I know I’m not imagining it.”
.” He made his smoke hippogriff stalk over to the children who shrieked and tried to hide behind each other. “And then –” he paused for dramatic effect. “It pounced!” His smoke hippogriff sprang forward and the children scrambled away, half-screaming and half-laughing.
“Ginevra.” Both Draco and Potter said at the same time and again Potter regarded him with a stunned expression.
“Oh, Percy’s fine,” he replied breezily, and now Draco was seriously wondering if he was talking to some sort of imposter. Percy reached up to scratch at his neck and his collar gaped for a moment. Draco’s eyes widened.
“I’m sorry it took me so long to get this to you,” he said softly and then gave a small chuckle. “I sort of had to find it first. My cupboard’s a mess.”
“Lily,” he tried again. He really didn’t want another one of Potter’s offspring using him as a human tissue again. “If I promise to visit you all will you let go?”
Harry scowls. He’d regretted his decision the minute Draco had asked for a cart to carry all the pumpkins he expected to choose. In his defence though, he’d honestly been afraid that Draco would break the Statute of Secrecy if he was allowed a wand. Draco
His eyes had saddened now. “I don’t know why it happened, but one day I woke up and when I looked at Ginny, her back turned towards me like she always did, I realized that I couldn’t remember the last time she’d slept in my arms. After that, it was just one thing after another. I noticed that we never shared those fond looks like Ron and Hermione. We hardly even talked anymore, and when we did it was always about something involving the kids. We’d not even properly made love since the night Albus had been conceived.”
“He did, and I can honestly tell you that he was a really good teacher. Probably the best DADA professor I had at Hogwarts, including Snape.”
Potter left but not before shooting Draco a concerned look first. Draco gulped, regarding Weasley with apprehension.
“Yes, most people tend to do that as opposed to beginning at the end.” Potter said with a smirk, and when had he even learnt to do
Draco threw the letter down, jaw tight with frustration. He thought back to the library when Potter was snuggled in his lap; how he’d leant on his shoulder afterwards while they ate sandwiches and insisted Draco feed him. Then there was what had happened as he was leaving that night… Certainly at the moment he was
With the few shreds of dignity he still retained, Draco stormed out of the room and back to bed. If Potter had indeed intended on leaving soon, his mother was sure to be in his room in a few minutes to lecture him on his ‘rude conduct’.
like I have anything better to do,” he grit out, wondering why she’d chosen this moment to become unbearably difficult. “When do I start?”
The boy seemed comforted by his words, and even loosened his grip on his robes. He sniffed one more time before lifting his chin bravely, obviously wanting to act like a ‘big boy’. He was rather cute actually and Draco found himself patting his head again.
Teddy grinned and for a moment his eyes flickered to grey. As they walked Teddy told Draco about his Gran and the little house he’d grown up in. He told him about how it was his first year at Hogwarts and he’d been sorted into Hufflepuff, a fact that he was greatly proud of since his mother and grandfather had also been of that House.
At one point he saw Victoire trying to unsuccessfully plait her hair and offered to do it for her. In school he’d often had to help style Pansy’s hair when she grew bored of her bob every once in a while. He’d always had an eye for detail and such things that involved style or beauty often came easily to him – a fact that Lucius had absolutely hated. Yet another ‘pansy trait’ of his.
“Draco, I swear to god, I will smack you so hard you’re pretty face will have the mark for a week if you don’t stop faffing about and tell us what hap–”
“Draco…" Potter breathed out softly, and suddenly his lips were on Draco’s and they were warm and soft and wet and everything Draco had ever dreamed of, and everything he could not accept.
“We only broke the barriers on the entrances for now,” Potter answered. “We’ll probably start with the contents tomorrow, if Malfoy’s up for it.”
“That sounds great. How ‘bout we go after this? I’m done with the rest of my shopping anyways and we could have lunch in Muggle London too.”
In the end, Draco suggested a game of chess and Potter had gratefully accepted the idea. Better to play a game that happened to have little talking involved, than stand awkwardly in the middle of his aunt’s sitting room. So Draco pulled out his wand and summoned the chess board which came flying from on top of one of the cupboards. When he turned to Potter, he found him staring intently at this wand.
“Molly and Cissa get on better than you would imagine.” Luna told him with a smile. “I’m glad. Molly’s always been so kind to me and I’ve always wanted her to see Cissa for how she really is.”
Draco wanted to tell Potter that the best course of action would be to continue from where they’d left off in the kitchen. He wanted to walk up to the man and kiss him again, knowing that there was nothing holding them back. He wanted to ask Potter if they could go out for dinner some time. He dearly wanted to return to the party hand in hand, showing everyone that Potter was his now.
The last thing he saw before he whisked himself away was Potter emerging through the open door, a flushed Ginny close behind.
“It was good to get out of the house,” Draco returned simply, trying his hardest to maintain an unaffected air at the invasion of his personal space. As Weasley had predicted, Potter didn’t seem to remember the aborted kiss at all and was acting the same as usual, which meant Draco needed to do the same.
“Is everything alright?” Potter’s voice asked from behind him and he turned to see him standing there with two paper cups in his hand.
Draco saved Potter from having to come up with an excuse. “I can’t anyways. It’s growing late and I really should be getting home. Perhaps another time?” he said smoothly.
“I said to lean on an armchair, not me.” Draco tried to keep his tone as even as possible. He dared not look down, knowing that Potter was probably staring up at him with those goddamn eyes of his.
“You were so happy,” Harry continued with a bemused shake of the head. “When you caught sight of the change in our names and the new branch, you stared with this look of complete awe.” Draco’s breath hitched as Harry leant to speak directly into his ear. “You were stunning in that moment and it made me realise just how lucky I was, having you in my life. To be able to call you
Draco took the armchair opposite. “I never did thank you for the wand.” he began hesitatingly. “And for everything else you did too.”
“Because the expression on your face was definitely worth putting a pumpkin on my head,” Draco replies, still grinning like the evil person he is.
Draco laughed. “I’ll take that as a ‘yes’ then.” He placed Lily in the one next to Al and then surreptitiously cast a sticking charm on them both to alleviate any risk of them falling out. Lily was already squealing in delight and jiggling up and down.
He leant back onto the tree trunk with a sigh. Al, his green eyed friend was sitting on his lap and seemed content to simply snuggle into the crook of his arm. He looked to be on the verge of dozing off, probably tired out by his dash through the wilderness. His big brother James, was leaning against Draco’s other side, and seemed intent on talking his ear off.
“Thank you. Do you like my earrings as well?” she asked, tapping one of the carrot-shaped earrings with her pinkie.
Narcissa’s face lit up. “What a coincidence, I was on my way to buy Ms Gretchin’s new novel as well!”
“Okay.” Draco cleared his throat. “I’m just going to go out on a limb and ask: are Ginny and Potter dating?”
Draco looked at Harry for support and found him watching them with a soft smile on his face. He turned back to Al. “I’d love to.”
It had been a week since Teddy’s birthday and as he’d asked of him, Potter hadn’t tried to contact him in any way; no owls, no Floo-calls, no unexpected visits. Draco knew he had no right to feel hurt by Potter’s desertion,
Draco nodded mutely and was then whisked away to the house by Ginny before he could get his bearing straight. Harry Potter had just pulled a wand on him, and it hadn’t resulted in duelling or injury. Draco really had no clue what to think of it all.
“I’m just going to say what everybody else is thinking,” Granger began once the teams were made. “Bill’s teams has a handicap and her name is Hermione Jean Granger.” She raised a hand to silence the indignant protests. “It’s fine; I’m not offended. Quidditch was never my strong point anyways.”
Weasley looked sick and Draco let out a squawk of outrage. “What is with you Gryffindors and your perverse fascination in my clothes? What I wear in my room is my own business.”
“I may have expected something a bit grander though,” Granger added teasingly. “Like a guest list going up to a hundred. A grand ballroom as the venue. Perhaps with a gold statue of Teddy as the centrepiece?”
In the fortnight that followed, Draco spent more and more time with the Potters. It seemed that the children requested his presence wherever they went and Draco was only too happy to join them. Potter had turned out to be the type of parent that wanted his children to experience all the joys of childhood, and Draco found himself reliving his own by accompanying them. His father hadn’t seen the need for such things but luckily for Draco, his mother had. Sometimes Potter would invite Draco to meet up with them at Diagon alley and then promptly ask him to think up a place to visit. Draco had already taken them to the magical zoo, the museum of magical history and the observatory he had loved as a child. The children had enjoyed these trips immensely but the strange thing was Potter seemed just as excited whenever they visited a new place. Only later did his aunt tell him that Potter hadn’t been allowed the childhood one would have expected of the Chosen one. After that, the trips weren’t only about the children. Draco wanted Potter to experience everything he had missed as a child and more.
“Alcohol,” Blaise stated plainly. “The necessary evil. Last week we went out for a party and the both of us got seriously sloshed. I don’t remember much of the night but somehow we got back to the house and… things happened.”
“More like I did the picking out in the first place.” Draco laughed. “The man’s sense of fashion is very similar to Hagrid’s wariness towards beasts. They both don’t exist.”
“I’ll come back to help you tomorrow,” Draco went on, ignoring the voice in his head that rose up in protest, reminding him that he’d vowed not to go back for anything and that to do so now was a sign of weakness. The voice sounded very like Lucius though, and that was proof enough that it knew fuck all. “I promised anyways, and I’m not usually one to go back on my word. Even if I still think you’re an annoying tosser,” he added just in case Potter thought they were pals now.
Potter’s lips quirked with amusement and he lifted his eyebrows. “I still need help walking about but I have my trusty cane for that.” He gestured to the beautiful, ornate cane propped up against his armchair. “I’m pretty sure it’s an antique but it gets the job done and is miles better than having Ron lug my sorry arse around.”
A smothered laugh, however, quickly pulls him out of his horrific fantasy, and Harry’s eyes narrow as he looks around him, finally noticing two indentations in the cut grass a few feet away from him that look suspiciously like feet.
“To get back to the matter at hand,” Granger interjected. “Harry, is there anything you want to say?”
“Well, I’m just– I mean, I realised that I’m pretty much taking up all your time, right?” Potter looked so adorably repentant and it was all Draco could do not to reach out and smooth his wrinkled brow.
Draco smiled as modestly as he could. The party really had turned out well and Teddy’s hair had been a vibrant turquoise all evening, which was a known indicator that he was extremely happy. The birthday boy was currently doing a quick circuit around the room atop George’s shoulders, waving grandly at his guests. They’d just cut the cake – an enormous confection of chocolate fudge, covered in an array of sweets, that had had the little boy squealing in delight the moment it had been brought out – and he was busily sucking on a lollipop as he impressively made his rounds.
,” he murmurs, giving Draco a light smack to the arse, pleased by the delicious little squeak it elicits.
Draco’s breathing became erratic as a bubble of panic swelled up inside him. The rational part of his brain told him to remain calm and think this out clearly. With the Easter holidays upon them, Diagon Alley was teeming with activity, garishly decorated shops luring children in droves with the allure of chocolate and goodies, their helpless parents trailing behind in resignation. It was the simplest of things to get lost in such a crowd and there was no reason for Draco to lose his cool and make a spectacle of himself. He wasn’t about to run around calling for his mummy like a complete ninny.
Everyone turned to Draco with varying levels of judgement and Draco stared back, completely flummoxed. He had no clue what was happening right now but he was starting to get the idea that he’d made a blunder in his understanding of things somewhere along the line.
Draco made a loud explosive noise – a strange mix of a growl and a scream – which made the children stare at him with wide frightened eyes. Draco felt like a complete arse. He sighed, running a hand through his hair that probably looked a real mess.
“Well, he’s only a friend right now, though I wouldn’t mind more.” Luna admitted, flushing even more.
Draco smirked again. Potter was going to flip. “Let’s just say that she didn’t take it too kindly when she found out that Blaise was also shagging their son.”
He reached the sitting room in a matter of seconds but tripped over a throw rug just as he entered, tumbling hard onto his front. Gritting his teeth against the pain, Draco crawled over towards the fireplace. His hands were trembling so badly that he ended up dropping the pot of Floo powder and it smashed to pieces on the stone hearth. Paying no heed to the mess, he scooped up a handful off the ground and flung it into the hearth. “Teddy’s nook!” he cried, thrusting his head into the green flames and immediately yelling for his aunt.
When they were both standing on the porch, Draco turned to Potter. “I had a wonderful time today.” he said somewhat awkward. No matter how much time they spent together, the goodbyes always ended up stilted and awkward “And again, thank you for dinner.”
And just like that, Draco was suddenly angry; the bitter taste of yet another rejection souring his mood. He knew he shouldn’t take it personally, and really it had already been years and surely he had to be over it by now. Yet, Draco knew that deep down he’d never gotten over the fact that Harry Potter didn’t want to be his friend. His lips twisting into a sneer that would have done his fifteen-year-old self proud, he found himself snapping, “Too good to be slumming it out with the snakes you mean?”
Draco cut into Potter’s rambling. “I really don’t care about what will or will not happen to your bollocks.”
Draco tutted. “Now Potter, patience is a virtue, you know. Besides, I wasn’t finished. After an invigorating conversation, I suddenly found his arm around me and the next thing I knew, he was kissing me. I’d been kissed before, mind you, once by Daphne Greengrass – I still shudder at the thought – and a couple of times by Blaise when I first identified as gay.”
. A few drops that flew out as a result came dangerously close to Draco’s sleeve, and he surreptitiously moved it away, handing Potter a napkin when he didn’t immediately reach for it himself.
“We need to clean up,” Draco suddenly announces, wrinkling his nose in disgust as he looks down at them both. “You’re literally a bloody mess, and you’ve contaminated me as well.” He looks so endearingly petulant that Harry can’t help reaching behind him to swipe at one of his ‘wounds’ and rub the mess onto Draco’s pristine cheek.
“Blimpy is sorry to disturb Master Draco, but Mistress is wanting you to accompany her in the sitting room.”
She stared at him open-mouthed and Mrs Weasley may have pinched herself. Draco lifted his chin haughtily in response and tried to give the impression of a man who still saw them as much beneath him in every way. Not that he actually thought that – well, not anymore, at least – but appearances had to be kept and all. The flame-haired girl seemed like she wanted to say something but before she could, a loud taunt cut cleanly through the air.
Draco stepped across the threshold and found himself in a narrow hallway. He opened his mouth to comment on the absence of the troll leg umbrella stand he remembered from his last visit, but Potter hurriedly hushed him. He gestured wildly and Draco got the gist that he was to remain silent and follow Potter. Compliantly he did so, and Potter led him to the first floor where they entered what looked like a sitting room. Only after he had shut the door firmly behind him, did Potter finally let out the breath that he’d been holding.
“Harry, come back here, you utter berk!” Draco looks torn between staying safe on his chair and following Harry. “I will not be accounted for your early demise.”
“I was wondering, did you have to go shopping for those clothes? I never pegged you as the type to own jeans.”
Blaise was staring with an equally blank face, and he hadn’t uttered a single word since Draco had told them about what happened. His silence was as unsettling as Pansy’s composure and Draco was starting to feel alarmed. This alarm only further grew when Pansy abruptly cut the Floo connection, leaving Draco with his head in a cold grate.
“I guess I do have an unfair advantage,” Ginny accepted, manoeuvring her broom closer. “I get a lot of flying done at school after all.”
“Oh you know,” Potter waved his hand rather absently and Al’s shirt was instantly cleaned. Draco tried not to look too impressed by the wandless act. Potter continued. “The fact that the I’m here eating ice cream with the infamous Draco Malfoy, old school rival and missing for years?”
“From what you’ve told us about him, it seems like you get along well now,” Blaise offered up hesitantly. “Is it really so horrible that you like him?”
When they reached the library, Weasley unceremoniously let go and practically threw him into the room. Draco stumbled on the rug and almost fell over. He shot Weasley a dirty look.
Draco rolled back onto his stomach. “I was hoping to have a nice pleasant conversation with my two best friends. Instead I get a first-hand look at your very active sex lives. Lucky me.”
Once Potter reached the base of Draco’s neck, he nosed at the neck of his jumper, nudging the loose material to a side until he’d bared one pale shoulder. Potter buried his face in the warm juncture between Draco’s neck and shoulder and bit down hard enough to make Draco let out an embarrassingly high-pitched keen. Potter licked gently at the stinging bite as if in apology, and then proceeded to suck at it, this time consciously and painstakingly marking him. Draco moaned at the attention Potter was giving to the now oversensitive patch of skin; he’d never known that the act of someone physically marking him could be such a turn-on.
Draco considered the note for a moment. He wasn’t sure how he felt about picking out a gift for the Weaslette but he was willing to admit that it would be worth it to spend time with the Potters. He hadn’t seen them for almost a week now, and he had nothing planned for the day anyways. Making up his mind, he quickly summoned a parchment and quill to jot down a note for Mother. She was out having lunch with Aunt Dromeda and he didn’t want her to go into a panic if she came home to an empty Manor. She seemed to think that he’d pick up and leave again the minute her back was turned, no matter how many times Draco assured her that he was back for good.
“Draco Malfoy.” he replied, taking her outstretched hand in a firm handshake. Her lack of reaction to his name told him that she was a Muggle.
“I haven’t seen you around before. I come here with my grandson Nigel every Thursday and I’m sure I would have remembered you. Your hair is rather distinctive if you don’t mind me saying.”
Draco would later excuse his sudden loss of sense to be due to too much time spent in the sun that day, because surely if he’d had his wits about him, he wouldn’t have answered James’ query with a “Not busy at all actually.”
“Yes, I see that it would be for the best.” Draco replied with an indulgent smile. “Follow me boys, we have robes to pick out.”
In an illustration of pure recklessness, he released his broom and threw himself bodily forward. The Snitch smacked into the middle of his palm and he closed his fist around it in triumph, savouring the wonderful feeling – no matter how short-lived it turned out to be. Without his broom underneath him, Draco’s sudden flight sent him tumbling head over heels onto the pitch, crying out as he did a couple of somersaults before finally coming to a rest on his stomach.
He took a quick shower, scrubbing furiously at his left cheek, and changed into the pyjamas he kept reserved for occasions like this when he felt truly poorly. They were a gag gift from Blaise and a tad embarrassing with cartoonish baby dragons wobbling about the muted blue cloth, but they were also so soft.
an absolute coward!” she spat, looking utterly appalled. “What happened to the little blonde brat who used to whine and fuss and scheme until he got what he wanted? So what if people throw a fuss? When have you
“So, do you have any plans for the day?” his mother asked, taking a seat in one of the chairs by the window. Aunt Dromeda moved over to one of the bookshelves and began to browse.
“After Molly made her rescue, she invited us along on their shopping expedition,” Draco continued. “She and Mother share a love for Joyce Gretchin novels.”
Yes, Draco should most definitely back down and yet here he was, currently clinging to Potter like his life depended on it, while the Muggle taxi driver drove like one who was intent on ending their lives as soon as possible.
Weasley went over to put his arm around her and loudly kissed the side of her head. “Don’t worry, your nosiness is one of the things I love about you,” he chuckled, and Granger smacked him slightly on the arm.
“The brooms,” Draco interrupted heatedly, “Were my father’s way of showing his appreciation that I’d joined the team. I suspect it was Mother’s idea though, seeing as how he’d constantly bemoan the fact that I played the ‘pansy position of seeker’ instead of being a beater like he’d been hoping.”
“Draco, stop.” Pansy looked like she wanted to bop him on the head but settled on just glaring disapprovingly. “You are not going to be murdered by a pack of Weasleys and buried in their garden so there is no reason for you to be dictating the conditions of your will.”
“I eat enough,” Draco huffed defensively. “It’s not my fault I never get fat. I quite like my build as it is.”
Draco could understand the feeling. Potter’s gladness over his two weeks finally being up could hardly hold a candle to when his house arrest had finally ended.
“Merlin, Draco, what’s the rush?” She laughed as she cleaned herself up with a swish of her wand, but quickly stopped when she took in his dishevelled appearance. “Are you alright?” she asked, and the sweet concern in her voice made him want to cry.
Draco looked away. “I didn’t want to hear about your relationship,” he said quietly. “Not when I…” He blushed at the words left unspoken.
it – even when I used it, I could feel how much it loved you. It never stopped and it never will. It’s
to be at your service.” Draco rolled his eyes as he leant his head on his hand. “Perhaps Ginny could join us too?” he suggested hopefully, and was genuinely startled when both Ginny and Potter responded with a loud and vehement, “
Dean packs up his briefcase and is gone soon after, shooting Harry a slightly worried look as he steps into the floo. Harry closes his eyes and wills his heart rate and breathing rate to slow down. He throws his wand so it rolls a few metres away from his outstretched hand and then waits, breathes coming out slowly.
“You talk as if you’re some old crone about to keel over any minute.” Draco said with an amused smile.
Harry gets up and takes Draco into his arms again. “How about I clean up and you go draw a bath for the both of us? I’ll join you as soon as I can.”
“Draco, there you are!” Ginny exclaimed as if she hadn’t been the one to disappear and leave him to the wolves.
Draco was stunned. He’d known that the public wouldn’t exactly accept them with open arms, but he’d always assumed that they would be more lenient with his mother. Narcissa didn’t have the Mark, after all, and had never been a Death Eater. He’d thought the worst she’d come across would be hissed words behind her back or a mild snubbing.
Draco smirked though his next words brought a twinge of hurt. “If I ever talk to Blaise again, he owes me a thousand galleons.”
“I think Ron just wants an excuse to drink. Get away from his heartache, and all.” Potter smirked, but still rose to get the drinks.
“However,” he added sternly when Potter finally looked up with a startled expression. “That was then, and this is now. I’d prefer not to be reminded of my less than commendable past and I hope you’ll respect that.”
“We’re planning on calling it a night, Malfoy,” Weasley said with a friendly clap to the back. Apparently braving peacocks was enough for Weasley to regard him as a sort-of friend, though Draco wasn’t really complaining. He’d found in him a worthy chess player and they’d have gone all night if George hadn’t threatened to destroy the chess board if they didn’t put it away.
Potter grinned sheepishly. “Next time I’ll be more careful. Come on,” he gestured for Draco to follow him as he exited the room and made for the stairs, “we’ll break through the attic and then that should be enough for today, I think. It’s much more guarded than the library and we probably won’t have the strength to do anything else afterwards.”
“Only a tad though, right?” Potter actually smiled in a faintly teasing manner. “So I needed Ginny’s help to get a hold of you,” he went on. “And she told me I’d find you here.”
Draco had forgotten about dinner with his aunt and cousin, and much as he was enjoying Ginny’s company, he was also immensely fond of any time spent with his little cousin. He rose to his feet.
A befitting name when one compared the owl’s incessant hooting and never-ending energy to that of the messenger of the Gods, known in tales for his speed and love of gossip.
It’s a few days before Halloween and Draco has been on his best behaviour since the spider incident. Not to say that Harry has let his guard down, because he hasn’t. Draco started this weird trick spree with Halloween in mind, Harry’s positive of this, and if there’s one thing he knows about his boyfriend, it’s that he’s as stubborn as a crup with a bone when he’s executing one of his plans. So really, Harry shouldn’t be all that surprised when Draco finally strikes again.
“Unfortunately,” Pansy sighed. “Anyways, you both should be off. Don’t want to keep the Weasleys waiting, right, Draco?” She winked.
“Draco?” an unapologetic voice called from the fireplace and he tilted his head backwards, giving Pansy’s upside-down head his best glare.
Draco left the suggestion unanswered and headed down towards the kitchen, not caring if his mother followed or not. He hadn’t been close to Tiberius, not in the way some people had been with their owls, but he’d still felt a certain amount of affection towards him. It wasn’t fair that Greyback had shot Tiberius out of the sky for no reason other than to satisfy his sadistic needs. It wasn’t fair that he’d engaged some of the other Death Eaters in his sick little game to see how many Cruciatus Curses the owl could handle before he died. It wasn’t fair that Rodolphus had caught sight of Draco watching from his window and forced him to count aloud as they proceeded to take turns casting.
“I’m beginning to see that.” Potter replied, and Draco turned away to hide the blush that had suddenly come to his cheeks. He blamed it on his mother, filling his head with strange ideas.
friends. Best friends, in fact, and it was just a bit of friendly experimentation. Now stop interrupting or I won’t give you the dirty details.”
Draco looked down at the shirt for the briefest of moments before looking up again. Luna’s pale eyes had a knowing look about them. “Most colours look good on me.” he replied, trying for a flippant tone that came out sounding too forced. “I like what you’re wearing today though.” he said sincerely. Luna looked lovely in a pale yellow spring dress, her hair tied pulled back into a thick braid with flowers woven in.
“You won’t find me complaining,” Potter replied with a shrug. “The more people looking out for Gin, the better. Okay, it’s my turn now. Ferrets.”
“I came by Floo. Your mum let me in.” One of Potter’s hands twitched and Draco bet he was just itching to get to his own wand.
“Yeah, Sirius Black was my godfather and left it to me in his will,” Potter explained. “If it wasn’t for that, the house would probably belong to you, right?”
“I’m fine.” he said in a strained voice. “But er…I have to ask, how could you be so sure Ron and ‘Mione would end up together.”
Probably no more than a second after the saucepan touches the ground, Harry’s toppling onto his back with Draco seated happily on his midsection. Harry opens his mouth to tell him to get off him, but he’s soon having the living daylights kissed out of him and decides it might be better to just keep quiet.
?” Draco could hardly believe his ears. “And you still kept kissing her? Isn’t that like rape of the lips?”
“A good Healer could probably sort him out, but otherwise, it has to be the caster who withdraws the jinx. Of course I’d have to be somewhere in his vicinity to do so… and I really have no need to cross paths with him again.”
“Is that safe?” Draco asked nervously as Potter led them to stand on a platform beside the tracks. “What if the roof collapses?”
” He tried to put as much exasperation as he could muster into that one word alone, hoping it would make Potter leave him alone.
For all his previous blustering, Potter had grown deadly silent now, staring at Draco as if he was truly seeing him for the first time. Draco wasn’t sure if that was a good or bad response, but continued with his explanation regardless.
Ginny took a seat at the foot of Draco’s bed beside Blaise. “So I take it you two gave Draco a good talking to?”
The two nodded understandably. “We’ll talk to you later then,” Pansy said, leaning forward to ghost her lips over where the flames made his cheeks.
“Is everyone alive in there?” Yet another voice called from outside the room and the remaining Weasley twin sauntered in with a dark skinned woman who Draco recognized as one of the Gryffindor chasers, Angelina Johnson.
Potter promptly tripped even though he wasn’t moving, and Ginny choked on air. Weasley grabbed his girlfriend’s arm and propelled her out of the room, closing the door firmly behind them even as she began to complain. “Not our business, love,” Draco heard him say before their footsteps died away. An awkward silence settled in the room.
Potter quickly turned away and Draco was sure that the arse was trying to hide the fact that he was quite obviously trying not to burst out laughing. Draco tried to unsuccessfully reclaim his hand but Bob clung on like a leech.
“I mean, sure you have your father’s colouration and height,” Potter said next, almost as if he knew what Draco was thinking, “but everything else is all your mum’s. You’re really slender like her, and you have her shape of eyes and mouth. I only noticed that night she ambushed me with tea. You both smile the same and have similar mannerisms too.”
Almost immediately running footsteps could be heard from within and the door swung open with a ‘pop’ to reveal a small army of what had to be Weasley children, if the freckles and red hair gave any indication.
Draco blushed as he saw that most of the room had heard the comment and were regarding him with varying looks of amusement. Though Harry looked like a veritable thunder cloud.
Potter took a bite out of a cookie too and he also voiced his approval. They were both on their third cookies when Aunt Andromeda came in with a tea tray. They all settled down and the tea was conducted with his mother and aunt trying to outdo each other in most outrageous childhood incidents.
!” A voice called from behind him and pretty soon his wife had also joined them, her curls tamed into a rather pretty bun that made her almost unrecognizable for a moment. She too seemed stunned when she took in the scene before her.
“Why don’t you all introduce yourselves then?” Potter suggested. “I’m here so it’ll still be official enough.”
Draco looks positively disdainful. “I cannot believe you actually said that,” he deadpans, shaking his head slowly. “Seriously though, you’re certainly not getting any tonight if you don’t clean up the mess you’ve made. You better pray
Draco found himself staring into green eyes that were much closer than he’d initially expected. He took an involuntary step back.
“Well, I didn’t ask for your opinion in the first place. Now for the last time, will you get off my pillow or must I resort to force?”
“I was just about to ask you if you normally allowed your very young children to gallivant around the meadows by themselves.”
When he’d gotten his breath back however, he wasn’t the least bit surprised to see James and Albus standing in front of him.
“Potter!” Draco gasped, the breath practically knocked out of him. “What the –” He wasn’t allowed to continue as Potter’s mouth descended on his own and then all Draco could do was wrap his arms desperately around the man’s shoulders and kiss back for all he was worth.
Blaise gave a shaky sort of smile. “Don’t go all sentimental on us now, Draco. You know we rely on you to uphold the aloofness that we Slytherins pride ourselves on. The moment you start telling us about your feelings is the moment the world ends.”
His mother shared a strange smile with his aunt and then gestured towards the closed door of the sitting room. “I was taking Andi down to the kitchens to get some milk for Teddy, but why don’t you head into the sitting room and wait for us? We will join you in a bit.”
. Needless to say, I had this bet won from the beginning.” Draco said modestly. “Now if I can only find the bastard, I can get my money.” He tapped his chin. “He’d usually be in Spain at this time of the year but unless they’ve elected a new Minister of Magic, he’s not allowed back there. Potter, are you alright?” Draco asked curiously. Potter looked like he’d just been hit by a
This time around there was thankfully no buggering in sight, and he called for someone to answer his call. Eventually a house elf appeared and soon he’d directed the creature to go get his friends. Draco summoned a cushion to lie on and got himself comfortable as he waited, crossing his arms and resting his head on them.
“No, this doesn’t give out smoke seeing as how it isn’t a coal burning train. It runs on electricity.”
Potter looked mildly concerned. “Please tell me you didn’t do anything illegal, because in case you didn’t know, I’m an Auror trainee – as in, it’s sort of in the job description to do something if you’re gadding about breaking the law.”
“We’re pretty forgiving people. Your mother already apologized to Mum for all the things that your family did or said, and I guess that’s enough for me. I’m tired of all the fighting and hate. I’m just so happy to have
“After she’d gotten over her little hormonal fit, she practically threw me out, telling me to have a good time with the family and that I deserved a break.”
The impromptu massage continues for a few more minutes until Harry wonders why Draco is so quiet. “I was thinking, maybe we could invite Ron and Hermione over for dinner later this week,” he says as a ways of starting a conversation. “Hermione’s been begging to come have a look at the place, but I figured you wouldn’t want anyone over until we were properly settled.”
close to fainting dead away. Harry isn’t sure how exactly they’d ended up in the kitchen, but with the door closed they can’t summon their wands without snapping them in the process, leaving them otherwise defenceless against their eight-legged foe.
Draco’s heart ached for him at the moment. All he wanted to do was tell him that it was all an act and let Harry take him into his arms and comfort him. Instead he set his jaw and erased all emotion from his face.
But then Potter laughed and the weird tension dissipated so fast, Draco wondered if he’d imagined it all.
“What? Lily fell in a hole?” Potter looked frantic again, and began hurriedly checking her over for injuries. As she was still in Draco’s arms, it brought them into close proximity and Draco got a whiff of gingerbread. He wondered for a moment if Potter had been baking before he’d come after the children, and then wanted to bash his head on a rock for wondering in the first place. It wasn’t as if anything Potter did interested him in the least.
“A missed opportunity I know.” Draco sighed. “It’s hard being so talented but I bear the burden bravely.”
Ginny flopped down next to Draco and yawned. “I’m exhausted,” she announced to the room in general. They were all lounging in the Weasley living room, tired from their gruelling match and fit to bursting from the massive supper Molly had provided. She and Arthur were having a quiet cuppa in the kitchen. “Leaving the youngsters to their business,” they’d said.
“What do you mean?” The question came out sharper than he’d intended and Mrs Spencer looked at him strangely.
“Oh?” Potter’s hands settled firmly on Draco’s hips and he gave a dangerous smile. Draco smirked back as he leaned in to whisper in Potter’s ear.
Draco turned around so fast he might have given himself whiplash, and he was just in time to see Potter drop the cursed book – which Draco had
“Well hasn’t this conversation taken a depressing turn?” Draco finally said with a shake of his head.
“Are my guilty pleasure and very pleasing they are indeed. Comfortable too,” he retorted. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ll be on my way to talk to actual human beings, lest I confirm my mother’s suspicions that I am a few steps away from going completely round the bend.”
“I thought… maybe I could do something about the Black tapestry. As gratitude for returning my wand.” This was what he’d told himself before when the idea had first hit him, but he knew it was really a selfish excuse to prolong his time with Potter. If things still ended up pear-shaped, Draco would at least have enough memories to get him through the storm.
“I already told you, it’s ‘Harry’,” Potter replied, stepping closer. “And yeah, I do. I’m not saying it’s going to be easy, but at least it’ll be interesting.” He tilted his head and gave a small lopsided smile that did strange things to Draco’s heart. “Still want to give it a go?”
–” he jabbed a finger in Al’s direction and the boy gave a sleepy smile. “– he was all ‘But if you get stuck too, what am I s’posed to do?’ and I was all ‘Don’t worry Al, I’ll save the day just like dad!’ Hey Draco, have you met my dad?”
He’d asked himself time and time again, how Ginny, who was brilliant and bright, could possibly remain with someone who couldn’t compliment her in any way. It was only through his own acquaintance with Potter that he found himself sometimes wondering at how lucky
“Harry, we need to kill it,” Draco whispers urgently, never taking his eyes off the spider. “It’s the only way.”
He took a seat on one of the tall wooden chairs and a few minutes later his mother joined him, looking subdued. The meal proceeded in silence save for the occasional clink of cutlery on the plates. Soon the house elves were clearing the dishes away to bring in dessert. Only then did Narcissa finally speak up.
“Impressive.” Ginny looked between them approvingly. “We broke out of Hogwarts and then kidnapped Harry to bring him here with the intention of forcing Draco to talk to him or else.”
“Fat lot of help you were,” Draco sneered back. “I should be heading back anyways. Goodnight you two and thanks for the drink.”
Draco hadn’t known his aunt for very long, but he already loved her. She was delightful company and very much like his mother, if you discounted the lack of dramatics that his mother was prone to employing. More than anything though, she made his mother happy. She’d smiled and laughed more in the past few days than she’d done in years, and as Draco saw this difference, he couldn’t help feeling like an arse for ever leaving her alone. He was glad Aunt Dromeda was back in her life now.
Draco accepted his glass with the slightest trepidation. He wasn’t sure if drinking around Potter was a good idea but thankfully, he was fairly good at holding his liquor. Lucius had had his heir attending societal soirees from an extremely young age and Draco had practically been weaned on champagne as a child.
Draco circled above the game, keeping a keen eye out for a flash of gold. He swiftly ducked as a Bludger headed his way and smirked when it almost took Weasley’s head off. In place of Beaters, Granger had charmed the Bludgers to pelt about within the limits of the playing field, randomly changing direction every now and then. Potter was on the other side of the pitch but instead of searching for the Snitch, his gaze was firmly fixed on Draco.
Potter seemed amused by his topic, smile widening into a proper grin. “Yeah, I’m a morning person if that’s what you’re going for. I had to wake up really early when I was a kid, and I got so used to it that I can’t really enjoy a long lie-in even now. That is, unless I’ve tired myself out the night before,” he added with a wicked grin.
Potter returned quickly and it was obvious that he held something behind his back. He shuffled his feet nervously.
Draco let out a frustrated breath; if only he could catch the Snitch, the game would be theirs. George was already starting to look a fair bit winded. Chasing required a good deal more stamina than Beating and he was steadfastly growing more and more tired as the game dragged on. If Draco didn’t finish this off soon, Ginny would be on her own.
in a snit but his anger was in no way directed towards Potter. He was furious with himself and his inappropriately growing desire to kiss Potter senseless. In fact, the only way he’d been able to stop his most recent attempt was by dousing himself with piping hot tea. Not his best decision but effective nonetheless. All he wanted to do was go home and have a long rant with Mercury. He supposed he should have been embarrassed that an owl had turned into his confidante, but Mercury was a good listener and Draco really had no one else he could talk to about this matter.
“There, there,” Draco cooed in mock concern and Potter snickered. “She’ll be coming for the party at least. McGonagall gave them permission so you’ll get to see her tomorrow.”
even happened?!), standing unsteadily on legs that threatened to give way. He was panting as if he’d run a marathon and his body and face refused to cool down. He was sure he looked completely fucked up. Potter sat up on the ground, staring up at him in concern now.
“Let’s just say that I did something rather foolish. The first thing we were taught about the beasts was that they were extremely proud creatures. One of my friends compared them to me actually.” he said with a rueful smile. The memory of Pansy telling him this was bittersweet now.
“Darling,” his mother said slowly, reaching out to hold his hand, “that doesn’t really make it any better, now does it?”
The two began arguing good-naturedly, walking a bit in front of Draco and the rest. Al continued to quiz Draco about his preferred chocolate while James butted in with his personal opinion on each of the mentioned chocolates. Draco however was hardly paying attention to either of them.
“How does the smoke go out if we’re underground? Are there passageways to the surface for it to go through?”
Potter frowned. “That’s another thing. You’ve finished up with all the Familial spells and all you’re doing now is sorting out the books to arrange for me. So doesn’t that mean that we’re pretty much done?”
Still looking at Potter, Draco replied. “I wasn’t very nice to him. I was rather…mean in fact. Not to say that your father was nice to me, I assure you he wasn’t.” he added.
Draco reached out to pat the child gently on the head. “No Al, I like you too much to turn you into a human bonfire.” He smiled. “You’ll find that the best way to find someone who is hiding is to scare them enough that they come to
Draco pursed his lips in distaste. “The thing that threw me off the most about that whole conversation was the fact that he didn’t appear to know who I was. Has he been living under a rock all this time?”
Fleur looked delighted now. “Eet is so nice to see an Englishman speaking French as eet should be spoken. Me, I have been trying to teach Bill for years now and yet zat man still cannot say ze simplest of things. His accent, eet is horrible!”
Draco looked away. Luna had this way of making him feel like he was on display. Sometimes when he caught her staring at him it was as if those pale eyes could see right through him, shifting through all the protective layers he’d erected around him until she was looking straight at his soul, bruised and tarnished as it was.
‘calm the fuck down’! What are you even doing here? How the bloody hell did you get in?” It was disorientating seeing him like this so suddenly and Draco hated that Potter could make him feel ill at ease in his own home.
“I live to please.” Draco replied with a bow. He held out his hand to help Potter off the ground. “So, do you have an idea of what Ginevra might want for her robes?”
.” Even as a boy, Draco could never take the sight of his mother crying – there was just something innately wrong about it.
“Malfoy,” Potter cautioned, his mouth pulling down in a moue of disapproval. “I’m not playing around here…”
“Of course Luna, don’t mind little old me.” Draco placed a hand dramatically over his heart. “It isn’t as if I’ve been gone for ages and yet you’re still ditching me to go on – Merlin help me – a
“It’s a free country isn’t it Potter?” Draco sneered back, feeling his hackles being raised. Seems Potter was the same self-righteous prat as always, brilliant smiles notwithstanding. “You’ll be telling me next that you own the whole field.”
The Weaslette finally stopped when they reached a less bustling part of the street, and Draco eyed her warily. He’d never admit it, but Ginny Weasley had always intimidated him a little, and he was at a complete loss over what to say or do in the face of her nonchalant stare.
“So the baby’s expected in May?” Draco wondered how he’d feel if he was to be a father in such a short amount of time. Frankly, it was a terrifying prospect.
“Oh.” Potter looked like he’d die of chagrin. “Right. Sorry. I’m pretty much killing this apology, aren’t I?”
“Well, there’s not much to tell.” Draco said with a shrug. “Apparently the Minister didn’t take too kindly when he found out that Blaise had been shagging his wife.”
A small break appeared in the crowd ahead and Draco thankfully sprang towards it, but just as he tried to make his escape, someone stepped in front of the gap. Unable to slow his momentum, Draco hissed out a curse as he forcefully slammed into them. The person gave a feminine squawk of outrage as she was bowled over, instinctively grabbing at his robes and subsequently pulling him along with her. He managed to manoeuvre himself so that he didn’t fall completely on her, but still wound up draped across her middle.
“No, Draco don’ goooo,” Potter whined, wobbling over to flop onto his chest and staring up at him pleadingly.
“It was in the bloody papers, for fuck’s sake!” Ginny exclaimed. “Our breakup was splashed across the papers for a full month before we managed to get them to stop.”
“That’s complete shite,” Ginny snorted. “There must be loads of people out there that share your birthday, whenever it may be, and–”
“Ginny and I had broken up at the end of sixth year and even after the War, I’d needed time.” he’d continued. “Getting back together had been surprisingly easy though and obviously the family had been thrilled, though let me tell you, it is
Realization seemed to dawn on Potter. “Oh yeah! Sorry, I forgot for a minute.” he said sheepishly. “Robes, right. Well…” he trailed off
“Malfoy.” She gave a curt nod which Draco found himself returning out of shock, and then turned to Potter and the boy.
“No, tomorrow morning would be better,” she replied firmly. “I don’t like sending Athena on long-distance flights after dark, and I know you won’t use a hired owl. You really should consider getting a new owl.”
Potter shrugged, leaning back in his chair comfortably. “It might. I think the Daily Prophet is running out of things to write about me. I haven’t done anything even close to heroic in years.”
was the one doing the mooning. Perhaps she finds that I am preferable to a boyfriend who just isn’t attentive enough,” Draco finished harshly.
Mrs Spencer tutted sympathetically and Draco silently congratulated himself for the proper pronunciation of ‘electricity’, though he was still lost when it came to understanding what it did exactly. Potter was forever laughing at him when he tried to bring it up claiming that he sounded like a child stumbling over a big word.
“Stop calling me ‘Draco’, you bastard!” Draco yelled, sorely tempted to throw something else at him. “And what
“So dramatic.” Potter sighed, rinsing James’ hair. Draco stuck his tongue out at his back and Al giggled.
“And what’s not to like about you? You’re handsome, educated, charming. I think you’d make a wonderful match.”
Potter returned with a couple of bottles and three large glasses. “Luckily I had a few chilling in the cooler for a special occasion.”
. He gazed down at the sleeping child and the feelings that swelled up inside him almost scared him with their intensity. Before he knew it he was smiling widely and was still doing so when he walked out of the room and promptly collided with Potter.
Draco huffed in amusement. “Fear not, Potter, I’ve been the most upstanding of citizens these days. All I did was leave the lout with a little gift as we parted ways, and for all I know he might turn up tomorrow after all.”
Draco’s eyes widened. He’d never thought about it before, but they really were finished. All he had were a few piles more; about a hundred books that he could probably finish today if he really tried.
“Alright, alright,” Draco relented, raising his hands in a placatory gesture. “I gave him a permanent hard-on.”
Potter didn’t respond for a while, and then Draco saw his shoulders lift in a shrug. “I was just about to head home.”
“Um, I’m not so sure…” Potter glanced at him uncomfortably. “I’m not so sure that’s a good idea Jamie.”
“Oh, thank Salazar!” Draco exclaimed as soon as Ginny told him that it was only she and her parents that were at home that morning.
?” Harry points at the spider, placidly squatting a mere few feet away, and still as big as a bloody Quaffle.
“’Cause of the way Mummy was looking at you.” she answered seriously. “And, you’re eyes are sad.” She reached up and placed a hand on his cheek below one eye. Draco leant into the touch.
him. He’d enjoyed being friends with him and if everything went pear-shaped, he wouldn’t even have that left. It was such a gamble and Draco had never been a betting man. He preferred things to be planned out; the less variables, the less likely it was that he’d be blindsided.
“No one told me any of this, alright,” Draco argued back, the idiotic feeling only getting worse. “How the hell was I supposed to know?”
Potter didn’t need any further prompting and he suddenly made a dash into the room, much to Draco’s horror. He’d expected the daft git to
“Also, it’s not that I think you can’t take care of yourself,” Potter smiled wryly. “Far from it. It’s just– people can be vicious and sometimes things go too far.”
“Oh come on Malfoy, just because you don’t like the prat doesn’t mean you do that.” Potter argued. “After all, he wasn’t buying them for himself. He was getting them for his wife.”
“You’re alright Malfoy.” He suddenly glanced at somewhere behind him and gave a conspiratorial wink. “Don’t look now, but you might want to run. Harry’s on his way over.” And with that he was gone.
Potter took a warning step closer. “You better watch yourself, Malfoy.” And his voice oozed authority. Must have been something they were taught in Auror training.
for her. Robes of the richest burgundy with bronze trimmings, that would bring out the vivacity of her hair and the paleness of her skin. Hell, they’d even make her freckles look elegant!
With a final weary-sounding hoot, Mercury lifted himself off the pillow and landed on the top of his cage. A cage that he refused to re-enter. Draco had tried to reason with him but he might as well have been talking to a wall for all the good it did him.
“Leave him alone. Mum won’t be pleased if she finds you harassing our guest. Or Ginny for that matter.”
Draco shuddered at the loaded words. He took a deep breath and opened his eyes. Potter watched him earnestly, and it was all too much. Draco couldn’t think straight with him so close, and he moved away to get some breathing room.
Draco wiped at his mouth with a napkin. “Well, I don’t usually overindulge but yes, I eat a fair amount. Why?”
“Only if you’re fine with it, of course,” he added in a rush. “I mean, it is your house and I don’t want to step on your toes or anything. I just figured it might–”
Having spent the day unproductively, it was no surprise that Draco decided to retire early for bed. It didn’t say much about his social life – all but deceased by this point – that he was turning in at eight o’clock on a Friday night, but it wasn’t as if anyone was around to mock him for it anyways. He might have retired earlier too, if it wasn’t for a certain winged menace bent on keeping him up as long as he could.
This time, Draco made sure not to show any outward sign that he’d seen the Snitch hovering near Charlie. Potter didn’t seem to have seen it the second time around and Draco decided to take a chance and do a quick circuit around the playing field to throw Potter off. Unfortunately for him, the moment he darted upwards, Potter suddenly went hurtling down. The sneaky bastard had been playing him the whole time!
Draco stopped and turned to him quizzically. Potter also came off the porch and Draco could finally make out his features in the silver light of the half-moon. His brows were knitted together and he looked anything but happy. “I just wanted to tell you to stop flirting with Ginny. She’s already taken, in case you didn’t know.”
By now they’d reached the door but Weasley didn’t stop there and led them all up to the library. Draco hated that he was being manhandled like a ragdoll, but as Weasley looked like he would happily body-bind Draco if he struggled too much, there was nothing he could do about it. Ginny and Potter followed close behind, the former looking even more concerned now, while the latter looked… resigned?
,” Pansy sniffed waspishly, crossing her arms. “You might try to play it off as drunken behaviour but it seems to me that anything he may have felt for Ginny just isn’t there anymore.”
“Such a shame about Ginny though,” Mrs Spencer gave a weary sigh. “I really don’t know what went wrong. They always have and still do make a beautiful couple.”
Draco scrambled to his feet and put a good distance between them in case she went through with her threat. He stuck his nose in the air haughtily.
Eventually Potter found his voice, supposedly having had his fill of staring. “I… didn’t know you’d gone to bed, or I’d have called tomorrow. It’s still pretty early and I figured you’d be free so Andromeda brought me here and– and I’m rambling again, aren’t I?” He laughed and the easy sound of it took some of Draco’s tension away.
“Ron’s picking up the cake on his way back,” Potter said, keeping his arm around Draco’s shoulders as he steered them out of the room. “We still have time but it can’t hurt to finish up with the rest of the decorations early.”
The momentary pleasure at knowing that Potter missed him was quickly quenched by the reminder that Potter still wasn’t well. He’d kept himself updated through his aunt and he knew that although the curse had been removed, it had still left him exhausted, both physically and magically. It made sense that his two best friends would volunteer to look after him.
Draco gave a weak smile. “Nothing for you to worry about.” he said reassuringly but the children still looked sweetly concerned.
“You should come for the Easter party on Saturday.” he said in voice devoid of emotion, and what Draco wouldn’t do to get the warmth back into his voice. “The children would love it if you came.”
Draco wasn’t looking at him but the concern in Potter’s voice was evident and his words cut straight through him. Suddenly, it was difficult to breathe.
Potter took a deep breath. “Okay, bollocks aside. This morning like I said, I told Ginny about how I’d pretty much ambushed you in the middle of the night and acted like an arse. The only reason I told her about it in the first place, was because I really did feel bad about it and wanted to make it up to you but I didn’t know
Opening his eyes again, he saw her kneeling over Potter, whispering something to him, though she dared not touch him. Aunt Dromeda was still casting and a light sheen of perspiration was visible on her forehead now, wand hand firmly aloft in spite of her fatigue. Draco looked down at his own shaking hands and wanted to laugh. Here his aunt was, doing some powerful spellcasting to keep Potter alive, and he was the one shivering like a frightened crup.
“That was a delightful turn of events,” Narcissa said as soon as Draco landed them in the foyer. "Molly is a lovely witch and I confess I’m glad Lucius isn’t here to spoil this friendship for me.”
“Harry also told me that you helped him pick out those dress robes.” she continued, a smile beginning to form. “I have to say, you have wonderful taste and the robes are beautiful. I’m planning on wearing them for the upcoming quidditch fundraiser hosted by the Puddlemere United team manager. Will you be attending?”
“Okay, I’ll admit that the fact that you did that to Smith made me want to do a bit of a happy dance back there, and possibly take a picture of the whole thing to show Ron but honestly, all that for a robe! Plus he got there first.”
“And I suppose all of them happened to be blokes around your age who are big Ginny Weasley fans?” Potter looked amused.
Draco recoiled when Potter suddenly reached out for him, and was immediately ashamed of himself when frightened green eyes stared back at him through a sheen of tears. Shaken out of his stupor by the desperation on Potter’s face, Draco quickly sprang to his feet and almost stepped on Kreacher when he suddenly appeared in front of him. The sound of the elf’s croaking wails echoed behind him as he raced out of the room.
Ginny hummed in understanding. “I completely forgot that you’re a Black on your mum’s side. Have you gotten far?”
Draco cuts off abruptly and silence descends on the room. Harry has laid himself so that his face is turned on its side, facing the fireplace, but he doesn’t dare open his eyes even a crack to see what Draco is doing. He barely resists the urge to laugh but somehow manages, and he waits.
Back when his friendship with Ginny had just begun, Draco had not seen any of this. All his ignorant self had seen when looking past Potter’s hero factor, was an awkward, socially inept, train-wreck of a wizard, all rash decisions and brazen luck, and he’d been baffled that Ginny had settled for
The twin Weasley gave a low whistle as he took the room in. Roxanne rushed over to him and began to show off her hair which Draco had done in small braids before tying it all back in a low ponytail.
Draco scowled, using his irritation over Potter’s flip attitude to mask his genuine relief. “I don’t really fancy joining Lucius over at Azkaban so…”
“Remember, I’m not likely to go after some kid – no matter how cute he may be–” He winked at Draco “–when I know Liam is waiting for me back home. But you know how much I love setting people up, and I know a couple of blokes who would
“I will.” Luna promised. “He’s out of the country right now, but when he’s back you both can come over for dinner. He’s a magizoologist and is currently on one of his expeditions.”
!” Draco spluttered, but to no effect as she placed the owl on his shoulder and returned to her letters. She waved her hand in obvious dismissal and with a huff of annoyance, Draco snatched up the owl cage and supplies and stalked up to his rooms, his new roommate clinging onto his shoulder for dear life.
“Come along.” she continued briskly and shepherded everyone out as if they were all children – Harry included. When Draco made to follow though, she held up a hand with a small smile. “
with a stumble but was able to right himself before he fell on his face. He made his way into Diagon Alley and headed directly to Twilfitt and Tatting’s. His mother had been quite fond of the shop and Draco knew it well. When he entered he was instantly thankful to find the shop empty apart from what he recognized to be Potter, crouched in front of a row of robes, his arse in the air. Draco might have felt embarrassed by the fact that he could identify the man by his rear alone, but he was too busy trying to stifle his laughter. He must have been unsuccessful though because Potter turned around almost immediately, a grin coming onto his face.
Draco frowned to himself as they left him, wondering what his mother was up to. It was obvious she had something up her sleeves and if Andromeda was in on the plot, it didn’t bode well for him. With a shrug to himself, he did as told and went into the sitting room – and immediately let out a loud shriek.
“Did I strike a nerve?” Thin Lips jeered and Nasal Voice snorted out a laugh. “Come now, all that rot about you aiding the Saviour reeks of horse shite. You’re nothing more than the wife of a Death Eater, a common whore really. Bet they kept you around just to entertain You-know-who and the rest of his fucking followers. Did Lucius know about that too? Probably liked to watch, sick bastard that he is.”
“We were taught basic First Aid spells during training,” Potter said as a way of explanation, tucking his wand away again. “I’ve healed what I can but you’ll still want some of Molly’s paste, unless you want to wake up black and blue tomorrow.”
When his mother entered she was holding a newspaper and not looking very happy. Aunt Andromeda was right behind her but she looked more amused than anything else. If the newspaper happened to be the Prophet, then Draco could understand what had sent his mother into a bad mood. They’d long since stopped subscribing to that rag, but Potter had kindly sent him a clipping that morning. He’d laughed so hard, he’d fallen out of his seat.
“And of course, you jumping me and begging me to take you right there on the carpet was a welcome outcome as well.”
Ginny’s words from that Quidditch game all those weeks ago came back to him in an instance. It had been absolutely terrifying to dive for the Snitch like that, not knowing whether he’d catch it or not, and the possibility of getting hurt a very real thing. And yet… he’d still gone for it anyways, hadn’t he? He’d done exactly what he’d never been able to do before; he’d gone for what he wanted, repercussions be damned, and it had
“Very well, Potter. I see that you are sincere in your repentance and I suppose I can be a good person here and accept your apology with grace and goodwill.”
“Dear Merlin, can you even hear yourself Cissy? They aren’t children anymore and I think Draco is perfectly capable of choosing his friends wisely.” She took the newspaper out of her clenched fist and smoothed it out. “Don’t they look like they’re having a wonderful, if not rather undignified time?”
“Well then, I suppose you’ll be pleased when he doesn’t make an appearance.” Draco observed casually, although the effect was probably belied by the cold smile on his face.
Draco blinked. “Oh…er, it’s good to see you too, Granger.” He grasped her hand and gave it a quick shake before dropping it.
“And I suppose this is why you haven’t been around these days?” Potter continued with a frown. “You somehow think this is your fault?” Draco nodded jerkily and everything began to spill out at once.
He found Lily’s nightie to be just where Potter had said, and the searched through her chest of drawers for some socks. The weather was mild but there was always the chance of her feet getting cold in the night. He quickly dressed her and then settled her down with a blanket wrapped snuggly around her. His mother had always read him a story before bed but the little girl’s eyes were already drooping so Draco decided not to. She had to be exhausted after playing all afternoon.
She reached out and gave his sleeve a quick rub between her fingers. “And seriously, how expensive is this robe? It
Granger beamed. “Brilliant! We’ll wait outside until you get ready.” She stood up and Weasley came to her side.
When they emerged from the path they were greeted by cheers all around, as well as a couple of catcalls and whistles. Draco could see his mother and aunt standing beside Molly and all three women looking on proudly, his mother even pulling out her handkerchief to dab at her eyes. George sidled over and started ribbing Harry at once, teasingly asking when the wedding would be. Harry laughed even while his face went bright red. Ginevra was standing with her sisters-in-law and she raised her glass in a strange salute, blowing Draco a kiss before nudging at Luna who had a serene smile on her face.
“Oh Draco, it’s lovely!” she sighed, holding the soft cashmere up against one smooth cheek. “But you really shouldn’t have. I’m in possession of a multitude of scarves as it is, and winter has already passed.”
“Draco is a pretty name.” Al announced suddenly, and this brought a smile to Draco’s face. “Thank you, Al. My mother will be pleased when I tell her that.” Potter was now staring at him as if he’d announced that he was planning on marrying a hippogriff and moving to Alaska.
It took only a few seconds for all the children to be seated placidly in front of him. Teddy had also come over and Lily and Hugo toddled over to be taken onto Draco’s lap. Draco got himself comfortable and then began, feeling thoroughly in his element now.
The men must have heard it too, as they burst out laughing. “Oh, sweetheart, you can drop the prim and proper act already,” the taller of the two said, his extraordinarily thin lips spreading into an oily smile as he took a step closer. “We all know you’re long past that now.”
Draco was nodding before he even registered it. Apart from wanting to spend time with the children, he found that Ginevra wasn’t as bad as he’d once thought her to be. She was being
Potter looked like he didn’t quite believe him but thankfully didn’t press the matter. He gave Draco’s hand a final squeeze before letting go and taking up a balloon. Draco followed his example and took up the balloon he’d been trying to inflate before, although this time he used his newly-returned wand and it worked perfectly.
“This calls for celebration!” Draco announces, bounding back into the house. “Take a seat while I get us some wine,” he calls back.
“Dress robes it is.” Draco said. “Now, does she have a preferred colour? Actually, never mind that. I think a nice lavender would suit her, perhaps with pale pink trimming. Or how about cobalt blue with light blue accents?”
“Nothing much,” Draco replied quickly, adopting a casual tone that sounded horribly fake even to his own ears. “This whole week was pretty much spent improving my Seeking skills with Ginny.”
Draco found himself clasping her hand with a bemused smile. “Pleased to make your acquaintance, Ginny. Draco Malfoy at your service.”
Potter winced. “Well, I’m sure he was just busy. You know us grownups, always have something to do.”
When Draco found Harry, he was leaning back against a large apple tree, a half filled basket on the ground beside him. His eyes were closed but as Draco approached him they shot open, widening marginally when he saw who it was. Draco felt some of the courage leaving him as he was subjected to Harry’s intense gaze but rallied himself valiantly, drawing strength from Ginevra’s words. He would tell Harry exactly how he felt about him. However as usual, Harry beat him to it.
“Oh, same old, same old.” Ginny waved her hand flippantly. “Mostly worked the register and the front because George says I
More voices came from the hallway and Draco sighed. It was like a Weasley reunion was happening right here in the playroom. Sure enough two more Weasley brothers strolled in, the pompous one who he remembered as being headboy, and the one that worked at Gringotts. Draco winced as he took in the man’s scarred face, though the scars did nothing to take away the fact that the man was gorgeous. Draco blinked.
sorry I said those things to you. My mouth tends to work faster than my brain most of the time, and when you sneered, it was like we were back at school. I reacted on instinct.”
“That girl really needs to learn to keep things to herself,” Draco muttered to himself, making a mental note to have a talk with her.
Draco kisses him again, sweet chaste pecks until they are both smiling against each other’s mouths. They end up cuddled against the fireplace, Draco somehow ending in Harry’s lap, and he relishes in the warm weight of him against it. They sit like that for a while, and Harry has one hand stroking at Draco’s neck over his pulse point. He can feel the rapid beat of his heart gradually slowing down to a steady thrum.
Harry seemed to shrink before his eyes then, the anger leaving his face in an instance as a lost expression took its place. “I don’t understand.” he finally said helplessly. “I don’t know what I did.”
Eventually he finishes with the lawn, and quickly puts the mower away in its shed, already mentally cataloguing everything he’ll need to make the stew. He’s walking back towards the house when suddenly he’s stopped by a voice.
I could book and lo and behold, I was back. That day you found me with the children had actually been the very day I’d come back. I’d been visiting Luna.”
“So to what do I owe this impromptu visit?” Draco asked, settling down in the armchair beside Granger.
“Don’t you think we’re moving too fast?” he spluttered after he’d coughed his lungs raw and had Ginny pounding on his back with a rather terrifying amount of strength. “I mean, we’ve only known each other for
“You shouldn’t have provoked the beast in the first place.” Draco continued, gently pouring water over Lily’s head.
“Yes, yes, until we finish the two rooms, I’ll come,” Draco replied distractedly, rubbing at his temples. Sweet Salazar, Potter was worse than a child at times.
“Oh I’ve missed these.” Al groaned after taking a bite out of his one. James also said something though it wasn’t exactly understandable with his mouth crammed full of one whole brownie.
Just because he was divorced didn’t necessarily mean he played for Draco’s team, so to speak. With a sigh Draco headed to the
“It’s a start,” Granger muttered, rolling her eyes. She came forward and held out her hand. “Good to see you out and about, Draco.”
“They didn’t?” This was news to Draco. He’d assumed the Golden Trio were living it up at Hogwarts, basking in the adoration that they’d surely get from the rest of the students.
Bill idly stroked the end of his ponytail before flicking it back. “When my wife heard that you were coming, her exact words were ‘Do not take any nonsense from that snotty Malfoy. You put him in his place if he acts out’. With a French accent of course,” he added with a small quirk of his lips. “So Malfoy, will I have to put you in your place? Planning on acting out?”
“Turns out, you’re actually really soft, Mal-mafloy.” He stroked a hand down one of Draco’s cheeks. “Ron, you gotta feel this! It’s like– like a kneazle kitten without the fur.”
Draco stood outside the entrance of the Leaky Caldron, nervously plucking at the hem of his shirt. He’d arrived almost half an hour early but instead of sitting inside and ordering something to eat or drink, he’d stood outside like an idiot. He didn’t know where the nerves were coming from but he blamed it on the fact that he hardly knew what they were going to do. His mother had noticed that something was up but hadn’t said anything even when he’d come to tell her he was going out with ‘a friend’ and wasn’t sure when he’d be back. She hadn’t even asked about his attire, simply telling him to have a nice time and to let her know if he wasn’t coming home for the night. She most probably thought he’d gone clubbing. Speaking of which, perhaps after this he could find a nice Muggle club for some dancing and shagging.
“Maybe you should sit down.” Mrs Spencer suggested kindly, gesturing to one of the many benches that littered the park.
A moment of silence passed before Potter spoke up again in a low voice. “You reminded me of my cousin, okay. The way you kept boasting about your father and not making friends with the ‘wrong sort’ and how you were so obviously rich and privileged, you sounded just like him and I didn’t want to have to live with another Dudley. Not after I’d finally gotten away from him.”
“You should have seen her,” Blaise sighed wistfully. “She came right up to us and dragged the other girl away from me and then backed me against a wall and snogged the life out of me. That was when it clicked for me too. I’ve been ploughing my way through the population but nobody’s ever made me feel what I do when I’m with Pans. Apart from you, she’s the only one who sees the real me.” He grinned. “Not to forget, she’s in possession of a smashing pair of tits.”
“And you’re going to have to tell her, you know,” Pansy said, equally as firmly. “Tell her about your feelings and that Potter might feel the same. Better talk to the speccy tosser too, before you do anything else. Call him out on his shite and get some answers.”
Narcissa’s glare softened and a tired expression took its place. “I’ve had a fair share of spells shot at me but I quite pride myself on my Shield Charm and do not know what they would have done had they actually hit me.”
“Of course it’s a bad thing!” Pansy shot back harshly. “You think he’d almost go into a panic attack over nothing?”
It doesn’t take Harry long to come up with the perfect revenge trick and he decides to implement it the next day itself. Draco is still humbled by the mishap in the shower and it’s not difficult for Harry to send him off to deliver pumpkin pies to Narcissa at the Manor. Draco doesn’t seem to suspect a thing, leaving with a bright smile and promises to actually help Harry prep for dinner. Harry almost feels bad about what he’s planning on doing.
“Cookies and cocoa?” Potter suggested, rolling his neck with a sigh of satisfaction and smiling at Draco in a beguiling manner. “Come on, Malfoy, you know you want it.”
Potter leant forward suddenly, an unexpectedly wicked grin on his face that had Draco feeling strangely suffocated. “I could offer you money if you wanted, or other… compensations.” The way he said ‘compensations’ was almost obscene, and Draco wondered for a mad moment if Potter was
Draco didn’t say anything more, instead staring around at the room. It was much more welcoming than he remembered, and he noted with approval that Potter had made use of light colours in an effort to mellow out the room a bit. There was a large tapestry that took up most of one wall and curiously, Draco moved to get a closer look.
So whenever he saw the proof of their bond, displayed so beautifully in gold, reminding him of all that he
Harry decides to ignore him and focus on the task at hand. He slowly creeps his way to the kitchen counter and reaches under it for a large saucepan. He manages to get close to the spider without startling it, and from the corner of his eye he can make out Draco with a hand pressed over his mouth, his eyes wide. Taking a deep breath, Harry bends at the knees and finally places the saucepan over the spider.
“It does have its merits,” Draco snorted in amusement, “But if your father is anything like mine, the necessity of an heir would drive him to find some discreet family to marry you off to, gay or otherwise. Why, just the other day Lord Greengrass called on us to ask if we were still planning on fulfilling the contract.”
“Don’t think too much of it.” Weasley said gently, a painfully understanding look on his face. “When he gets this drunk, he’s not likely to remember any of this in the morning.”
Her foot began to tap. Never a good sign. “I take it you haven’t the slightest clue about this particularly interesting article?” She held up the paper. “I’m having a lovely shopping expedition with your aunt when I suddenly see
“Something like that,” his older brother replied neutrally, which did nothing to settle Draco’s nerves. He gulped as he looked up at the tall Curse-Breaker and a wave of panic hit him when Percy unwittingly wandered away and left them alone. Arthur was conversing with his wife near the back porch and Ginny was nowhere to be seen.
“My arse aside, Potter can’t do this to Ginny,” Draco snapped. “I don’t care if I’ve fallen for him, he needs to back the fuck off.”
“Sorry Aunt ‘Mione.” he mumbled and his hair quickly melted in to an unassuming brown whilst his eyes also turned brown.
“The thirty-first of July is still a few months away; you have time.” Draco waved his hand dismissively.
“No.” Potter shook his head and his stoic expression softened a little. “Well-groomed and thoughtfully put together, maybe even a little cold at a glance, but make the effort to look further and you’ll notice the hidden warmth and loveliness in every corner.”
“All done Draco.” Dominique announced in satisfaction after they’d completely cleared the floor of all the toys. The paint still remained though so Draco pulled out his wand, removing it from the walls and the children.
“Charlie’s the second eldest in the family,” Ginny told him. “He works with dragons in Romania and he’s bloody brilliant with them.” There was evident pride in her voice and Draco nodded, vaguely remembering the redheaded dragon trainer who had come to Hogwarts during the Triwizard tournament.
Draco’s hands lifted from where they’d been gripping the edge of the counter to tentatively hold onto Potter’s waist, and Potter hummed happily into his mouth. His hands moved into Draco’s hair and tangled in the blonde locks as he changed the fit of their lips. A hot flick of his tongue, and Draco’s lips were parting for him to immediately dive in. He licked a heated path into Draco’s mouth and Draco choked on a moan when Potter painstakingly stroked the sensitive roof of his mouth with an extremely supple tongue.
Draco allowed himself to relax at that. So she just thought that it was some fancy academy. “Oh yes, it was rather an old fashioned school too. We didn’t even have electricity!”
He didn’t blame his mother for her vindictive attitude. It would seem hypocritical of him to defend Lucius now after he’d all but told him how much he loathed calling him his father. Draco winced in memory; it was definitely a conversation he was unlikely to forget in a long time.
him – but he still couldn’t quite shake the feeling of guilt that persisted in the recesses of his mind. An active conscience was
Draco let out a hissed curse as he pulled his broom up short. Ginny triumphantly held up her hand, the fluttering Snitch still struggling to get loose.
“His work keeps him away a lot though,” she went on with a sigh. “We’ve gotten used to it but I do miss him. He was always fun to be around; kind of like the twins but more of a friend-to-the-world rather than a full-blown prankster.” She brightened up suddenly. “Though he
. Very gentlemanly of him, if you ask me. We did everything else though,” he finished with a dreamy sigh. “Best day of my life, tops, and sadly my one and only real experience with a man.”
He turned on the spot and when the world came into focus again, he was in his room. He’d already informed his mother that he might be late so all he had to do was strip out of his clothes and flop into bed. He was asleep before his head even touched the pillow.
Splash me one more time and you’ll have no desserts for a month.” Potter threatened, glaring at the five year old.
Draco agreed wholeheartedly. “She was rather amusing actually.” He took a sip from his drink and was met with a burst of chocolate and caramel. He sighed happily.
Draco’s heart was pounding painfully and he snatched up his wand, flicking it wildly at the balloon and trying to inflate it the wizard way. When nothing happened, he tried again, frustration building. What good was he as a wizard if he couldn’t even get a stupid wand to listen to him?
“I think you’ve broken Harpy-lady though,” Harry laughs when he catches sight of her, blatantly gawking from her front porch. Draco sends her a vicious smile and then pulls Harry in for a heated kiss, which Harry reluctantly breaks with a murmured, “We’re outside.”
“I’m just happy you had a good time.” His mother placed her hand on his cheek in a tender gesture before stepping away. “Well then, I’ll be reading in the garden if you need me, darling. If not, I’ll see you at supper.”
“Leave it to me and go upstairs. Mistress Andromeda wanted to speak to you about the food. She seemed quite impressed with it all.”
Draco let out a sigh of relief when they complied without a protest. He took a seat on the window seat and leant his head against the window pane as he watched them tidying up. When Mrs Weasley had invited him in as if he were an old friend he’d felt severely off-kilter. She’d proceeded to exclaim about how thin he was and enquired on his eating habits. Before he could answer with a ‘yes, I do eat three times a day’, she’d sat him down in the kitchen and placed a plate of stew in front of him. He’d been unable to refuse and having slept through breakfast
“Mind your own fucking business, Potter,” he snarled, horrified to find that he was choking up a little. He refused to cry over a wand of all things, and certainly not in front of
never apologized,” he began haltingly. The old Draco wouldn’t have apologized, but then again, he wasn’t the old Draco now, was he? He looked down at his lap for a minute before looking up again. “I’m sorry for- for ever making fun of your family, or your wealth, or your clothes. And I’m sorry Lucius almost got you killed your first year. And I’m sorry
to imagine Potter as a fellow Housemate. In all truth, it would have been unsettling to think so; Potter heading down to the dungeons instead of up to the tower after dinner; lounging about the common room that had so much green that it was practically designed to complement his eyes. Potter could have been in his
made Draco pause to turn around, but only almost. He practically leapt down the steps and as soon as his feet touched the pavement, he turned on the spot, not giving a rat’s arse if any Muggles caught a glimpse of him Disapparating
“Come on Malfoy,” Potter began with a smirk. “It probably looked like that to that girl and I wasn’t going to pass up a perfectly good discount. Where’s that cunning that you Slytherins are so proud off?”
“Ah.” Honestly, he wasn’t all that shocked by it all. “Where are they now? Please tell me they aren’t waiting somewhere out of my line of vision until you get back to them.”
Bill grinned wickedly. “I was planning on Charlie for Seeker if I could get him, but let’s make this a little more interesting. I’ll take Harry.”
Narcissa Malfoy had always held her head high in the face of adversary but right now she looked like a frightened school girl being sent to the Headmaster for the first time, staring up the walk way to the house with wide blue eyes.
They waved a quick farewell at Narcissa as she read by the window, and stepped into the sitting room Floo, Ginny first with Draco following soon after. He figured there was no use prolonging it any longer.
“Harry.” This was growled into his ear, and the heady feel of hot breath made him shiver. Potter pressed him even harder against the counter and the edge of the counter dug painfully into his lower back.
took his wand in hand. A rush of pure heat shot through him as soon as he made contact, originating from his palm and spreading to his very toes. He gasped at the sensation and clutched his wand to his chest, hunching over it and simply
“Can’t you give it a try?” Pansy whined. “You said it yourself, you’re turning your life around. You want to be your own man, then go for what you want.”
There was still a bit of tension in the air but this was to be expected, considering who they were and the history they shared. Potter’s game ensured that conversation was relatively flowing, but at first they never spoke about anything of real worth; sticking to the most mundane of topics. There were just too many ugly things left unspoken between them and Draco was afraid to bring them up and spoil the tentative friendship they’d begun, preferring to continue as if their shared pasts had never occurred.
“Alright then… I’ll, er, accept it as a gift then.” Potter reached out cautiously and snatched up the bag before retreating away from the counter again.
“Well I have the unfair advantage of having learnt French from a very young age.” Draco said in Bill’s defence. “I’m sure your children are quite capable of speaking in French even though they normally speak as any English children would.”
surprise, Pansy – the girl who’d once tried to have sex with some bloke while Draco was sleeping in the same room, and had shown no shame whatsoever when she’d been caught – blushed as sweetly as a virgin bride on her wedding night, and shot Blaise a quick look that spoke volumes. Draco took a sharp intake of breath and his own problems were forgotten in place of a shocking realisation that hit him like the Hogwarts Express.
“Well they seem to be getting along fine.” Potter said with amusement as he sidled over to Draco. “She’s…different from what I expected, I’ll admit.”
Draco stared at the closed door for a moment, resisting the urge to go in after him. He was still painfully hard but he’d have to contend with a nice long wank when he got back. Eventually he shook himself and walked down the steps and out of the wards, glancing back for one final look at the house before
There was some more fidgeting and a bit of shuffling, then suddenly Potter was dropping down to the floor next to him. He started in alarm.
Draco blinked as he stepped out into the sunlight. It was still light out and it took his eyes some time to adjust after being in the dark for so long.
Potter actually smiled at that. “What would you expect when you take two fucked up individuals such as ourselves? Shall I continue?”
Another book came flying over from a faraway pile and Potter caught it neatly. He held it up triumphantly.
He was just finishing up with the last of the girls – Rose – when who should suddenly yank the door open and stride in, but Weasley, his wand drawn and a fierce scowl on his face. When he found Draco busily plaiting his daughter’s hair he stilled in apparent shock, his wand hand lowering.
“Mother, you’re being ridiculous.” Draco said with a forced laugh. “I’ll admit we’ve put aside our differences, but Potter and I are just friends. You’ve nothing to be worried about, seeing as how nothing will ever happen between us.” He abruptly stood up. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ll be going now. I’ll give Luna your message.”
“You know, people usually knock before entering a room.” Draco replied, taking out a pair of pants before closing the wardrobe door.
“He’ll be properly stuffed when I’m done with him,” Ginny promised, giving him a slightly terrifying grin. Satisfied, Molly gave him a pat and then went back in, taking the clock with her.
“Mafoy, you’re really pretty,” Potter told him seriously. “Not pretty like Ginny-pretty; pretty like Malloy-pretty.”
“With Slytherin close behind I might add.” Lily interjected. “We were second in House points too. Probably would have won if Patrick Finnegan hadn’t lost all those House points when he accidentally set the dinner table on fire.”
“Well, they may be divorced but I’ve still seen them here together, and they seem as jovial with each other as they’ve always been.”
Weasley was muttering something about getting a camera and Draco tried to sound as firm as he could when he spoke to Potter.
Potter frowned. “Be nice. She’s really happy with Nev. He’s abroad right now attending a Herbology convention in Germany, but he’ll be back in a week or so.”
. For one thing there was the fact that his son would also be present, then there was the whole ‘buy a gift for my ex-wife’ factor and not to forget the crucial fact that Potter would never in a million years be interested in
Weasley turned to Potter with a bewildered expression. “Mate, Malfoy’s talking weird again; make him stop.”
Potter gave him a sardonic look. “I’m not lying though. It really was planning on Sorting me with you lot. I just asked it not to.”
Al dragged him to the swing set and once there, Draco picked the little boy up and placed him in the seat of one of the toddler-safe swings.
“What you say is also true.” Fleur sighed. “Ze rest of ze family is no better, though ‘Arry does make an effort.”
Draco placed a couple of cushions in front of his fireplace before settling down on his stomach. He reached for a pinch of Floo powder and threw it in, calling out “Zabini estate, Pansy’s room” before thrusting his head into the flames.
“Er…” Potter blinked. “I think you look fine.” He gave Draco a look that would have looked appreciative on any other person, but only served to make Draco scoff.
Pretty soon all the girl wanted their hair styled, so while he continued to relate his stories, Draco found himself plaiting and clipping and tying. He made sure not to do anything permanent though, knowing that their mothers’ would have a fit otherwise.
Draco smiled and came forward to scoop the child up as Harry took Lily. “You’re mommy is a very intelligent witch.” he said and Al threw his arms around his neck to give him a tight hug.
“I’ll just go down to the kitchen to get some more mini pies. I’m pretty sure Weasley ate the last plate all by himself.”
“Bite your tongue Potter, I’m older than you and I assure you I’m as fresh as the day.” Draco shot back haughtily.
“Percy!” he called out loudly, startling the slim wizard who had just emerged from the house. “Come over and meet Draco.”
“Ginny, dear, are you alright?” a voice called from the crowd and soon her mother came hurtling through with the force of a rampaging erumpent.
going well,” Draco shot back, and it was true. He’d actually been enjoying himself. “That is, until you had to remind me all too clearly of how much of a brat I used to be, and that you hate my guts.”
Granger shrugged unremorsefully. “I’m not feeling very benevolent right now with Harry upset. He misses you.”
“Daddy actually did that?” Al asked in delight, his eyes shining like the most dazzling of emeralds. Draco had to force himself to look away from them.
He heard his mother take a sharp intake of breath beside him and suddenly she was pushing past him in a rush, her arms wrapping around the older woman with a fervour that Draco hadn’t known she had. His aunt returned the hug with as much passion and for a moment all the witches did was to hold each other, sobs muffled into the others’ hair. Draco could do nothing but stand uncomfortably by as they exchanged rushed words and tearful smiles.
“Alright,” he finally said after a moment of contemplation, the slight uncertainty in his voice at odds with the steady way in which he met Draco’s gaze. “Relationship.”
Ginny sagged with relief. “You gave me a right fright but if you can still run your mouth, then you’re going to be fine.”
“If it wouldn’t be too much of a trouble.” Potter replied gratefully. “I’ve kept her nightie on her crib. Could you put her to bed too? I’ll put these two to bed and then join you.” He was already towelling off Al whilst James wiped himself. “I think they’ll be asleep as soon as their heads touch their pillows, so boys say goodnight to Draco now.”
was the one who had been waylaid in the middle of a busy street for some inane conversation that was leading them nowhere.
“Well, all you did was thoroughly confuse me,” Draco told him dryly, even as he felt a reluctant smile tugging at his mouth. “Delicacy doesn’t suit you, Potter. Stick to being foolhardily direct.”
Draco listened indulgently as James took to the floor with a flourish. Lily sat beside him and as of habit she gripped his shirt with one hand, leaning comfortably against him. He placed a soft kiss on her head. It’d been her first year at Hogwarts and he’d really missed her.
Harry kissed him again and Draco sighed happily. It seemed like everything was going to be alright after all. In fact – Draco gasped as Harry’s hands found their way under his shirt, smoothing over his back before dipping into his jeans and digging shamelessly into his arse cheeks – it seemed like things were about to get even better. However, just when their antics were about to cross over to best-conducted-in-the-bedroom-and-not-where-all-the-world-can-see, they were interrupted by the arrival of the Potter children.
He’d managed seventeen counts before having to rush to the nearest bathroom to sick up. When he’d returned to the window, the Death Eaters had left and Draco had gone out to retrieve Tiberius’ abused body, ordering a house elf to bury him in a corner of the garden. He still visited the little grave once or twice a week.
Narcissa let out another huff, and Draco shot her a frown. He wasn’t sure what had gotten into the Weasley girl, but whatever it was, it was not to be encouraged. Mrs Weasley came bustling towards them then, her cheeks still lightly flushed from her outburst.
When Saturday arrived, all Draco wanted to do was bury himself in his covers and never come out. Unfortunately for him, his mother had other plans. She sailed in with a cheerful ‘Good morning’ and then proceeded to aggressively strip him of his covers.
Ginny returned Pansy’s shrill enquiry with a cool look. “Just that I figured since Draco’s a certified recluse now, it meant all his so-called friends had abandoned him.”
Once he’d made certain that Potter was neither dead nor dying, Draco had fully intended to keep to his word and lock himself away in the Manor. However, he hadn’t counted on a guilt-tripping Granger storming into his room a couple of days after the accident, Weasley trailing warily behind.
“You’re still coming back tomorrow though, right?” Potter persisted irritatingly, words jumbling together in his haste to get them out before Draco could step into the Floo.
Weasley chose this moment to enter and when he took in the sight of Draco glaring and hissing from his sheet cocoon, his face went bright red.
“Goodness Nigel, haven’t I told you not to pull?” She gave them Draco one last concerned look before allowing herself to be dragged away, calling back, “It was lovely to meet you Draco. Harry, make sure he’s alright. Good day to you both.”
do it this time, instead of you, I should be fine. Merlin Harry, couldn’t you have transfigured them into something even remotely attractive?”
Draco raised a hand to silence him. “Yeah, see, I’m not here to actually make a purchase so you might want to save the sales speech…” He squinted at the nametag pinned to the front of the man’s robes. “…Bob.”
“Hear hear!” Blaise cheered. “Pity for little Astoria though. She was quite besotted with you if I remember correctly. A sweet thing really, unlike her sister.”
After the War, Harry had wanted a pet to keep him company. More specifically, he'd wanted a snake. He’d known how it would look, picking such a companion right after defeating old snake-face himself, but Harry hadn’t really cared what the public would think and all he’d wanted was a pet that he could talk to. However, he’d soon realized that being able to speak Parseltongue really had been all Voldemort, and no matter how much he’d tried, he’d been unable to understand a single hiss from any of the lively snakes in the tank.
“Okay, I did not mean it like that,” Potter protested slowly, blinking in confusion. “Of course I know I’m lucky to have Ginny. The fact that she’s stuck by me despite everything… well, not many would.”
“Potter, you have ice cream on your nose.” Draco laughed, handing him a napkin. Potter didn’t take it though, instead sticking out his nose for Draco to wipe it off instead. Only after he’d done it had Draco realized that it had been an oddly domestic act.
, even though he was quite pleased with what he’d decided to do. The other two were watching him curiously, waiting for him to continue.
“It’s the least I could do after you invited me for dinner.” Draco replied with a shrug. “And I would be surprised if you
Draco smiled up at the two of them and then withdrew his head. He quickly changed into more respectable clothes and headed downstairs. They no longer dressed formally for dinner but he knew his mother wouldn’t approve of him coming downstairs dressed sloppily. She was constantly telling him that just because he
“We don’t want you here,” someone else called out shrilly. “Diagon Alley doesn’t welcome your sort.”
“Merlin, you’re overdramatic.” Ginny actually rolled her eyes at him. “This is ridiculous and you’re acting like a baby. Buck up and stop being such a coward.”
“Good. Now, could we start by cleaning up the room? Pick up your toys please; your parents will be back any moment now.”
Draco didn’t wait to hear more, rushing away as fast as he could. A stupid part of him almost wished Potter would just stay down in the kitchen and then he wouldn’t have to see him again. If Potter would just let it go, they could act like the kiss had never happened and things could be normal again. As if to dispel that very notion and rub his misdeeds in his face, when Draco made it back to the party, he immediately ran into Ginny and made her spill her drink all over her front.
Ginny and Granger looked delighted, Weasley closed his eyes with a frustrated groan and Potter let out a loud, “Oh, for fuck’s sake!”
Potter looked up for a brief moment and then dropped his gaze again. “He’s fine now. We kind of made up during the War. But back when we were kids, yeah, he wasn’t nice.”
Granger blinked quizzically at him. “Well, you’re his friend who until a couple of days ago, came over every day and then you suddenly disappear. I think any of us would have done the same in his position.”
“What are you doing, Ron?” Ginny hissed, glancing at the others in the room. “You’re making a bloody scene, and I don’t even know what this is about.”
Draco panted loudly and was shocked to find himself moments away from cumming in his pants like a schoolboy. Gripping Potter’s hair with both hands, he dragged him back for a kiss, swallowing his moans and whimpers with relish. Draco’s whole body felt like it was on fire and he was so close now.
“And by ‘this’, I suppose you mean the two of us stranded over here while our wands lie somewhere on the other side of that door?”
“Fine fine, I’m a complete arse. I should have come back ages ago. In fact I shouldn’t have left in the first place. I made my mother miserable. I abandoned you when you’ve always stuck with me. I, Draco Lucius Malfoy am sorry.” He bowed his head to emphasize his point, only lifting it when he heard a giggle.
when my jinx will take effect. It’s quite ingenious really,” he added with a modest shrug. “Completely alleviates suspicion and is embarrassing enough that he won’t go straight to St Mungo’s about it.”
“What’s there to understand? It’s simple. I haven’t been in contact with Blaise since I picked the wrong side of the War, but back when we did talk, we made a bit of a bet in fifth year. I bet that the Weasel would end up with Granger while he bet that Granger would end up with
“I think we both gave each other grief.” Potter spoke up in a quiet voice, and the silence that followed spoke of things left unsaid. Bathrooms and unknown spells.
Eventually they reach the top of the hill, which means that their home is only a couple of houses away. When they are finally walking up their drive, Harry can’t help smiling. It still feels surreal to think that he has a house
“I suppose that has its merits if ever they find themselves unable to perform magic.” Draco said and it was obviously the correct response as Potter gave him a radiant smile.
Draco turned to see Mrs Weasley advancing on them with purposeful strides, her mouth set in a disapproving line.
The banter – Draco finally accepted that it was indeed banter after they’d had a particularly spirited debate of the merits of treacle tart versus that of apple pie – went on, and before he even knew it, he’d spent an extended period of time with Potter and they’d actually been engaged in civilised conversation. Now, curled up in plush armchairs in Potter’s sitting room, they were in the middle of crooning over the new Firebolt model when the fireplace flared and Weasley stepped through. He seemed surprised to see Draco there but didn’t seem too bothered by it. He did give Potter a strange smile though, and Potter’s good mood went away in an instance.
The girls gasped and even Teddy looked up from his book. The trio by the door froze in their tracks, turning slowly.
Weasley let out an anguished groan and banged his head back against an armchair. Draco shared an amused look with Potter, knowing what was coming next.
As a reply, Draco only gives his shoulders a small squeeze before continuing with the massage. Harry frowns, wondering if he’s done anything to piss him off.
protest, but seeing as how Potter wouldn’t let it go, he decided not to waste his energy. He took a seat while Potter rummaged through a cupboard.
“Yes, well you might not believe me when I say that my exceptional potions marks had nothing to do with Snape.”
“And is that what this is?” Draco pressed, suddenly desperate to know where he stood with Potter. “Is this our second chance?”
“Trust me, Bill,” Charlie said sagely. “The kid plays Chaser for my team. I’m never wrong about these things.”
Once he’d finally reached the bottom of the stairs, he was met by his mother and aunt emerging from the sitting room, Cousin Teddy gushing away in Narcissa’s arms.
“I seriously did not want to see you, you know,” Potter continued casually, easily speaking over Draco. “I was really mad after you left, but Hermione reasoned that you were probably just scared.”
Making a score of hasty excuses that he couldn’t even remember later on, Draco practically ran out of the shop. He hurried away, blindly bumping into witches and wizards alike. Many of them cursed at him and even shoved back, but Draco was numb to it all. He plodded on until eventually he came to a more abandoned part of the alley. The shops here had long been out of business and no one was there at the moment. Only then did he lean against a nearby wall and take a shaky breath.
“Couldn’t you have just been a prat?” Harry continued angrily. “You just had to be all friendly and understanding and sarcastic in the most refreshing way possible, not to mention being a wet dream walking! Do you know how hard it was not to jump you the first time I saw you wearing those bloody Muggle jeans? I was practically
“It’s kind of obvious that you’re both head over heels for each other.” she continued. “All you have to do is let go and let it happen.”
Draco expected Potter to take out his wand for the job but much to his surprise, he appeared to be putting it in his mouth.
“They’re ready!” Teddy’s excited voice drifted into the sitting room and his body soon followed. He bounded in carrying a plate of steaming gingerbread cookies which he thrust under their noses.
Draco smiled, even as he felt a twinge of sadness at the remembrance of his godfather. “Have you… seen his portrait?” he asked hesitantly. He’d heard that the Ministry had finally relented to having Severus’ portrait join the other Headmasters at Hogwarts.
Potter uncomfortably shuffled his feet but didn’t contradict him. A moment of silence passed when James suddenly chimed in.
“Draco, I am not some helpless flower that you must protect,” she replied coldly. “I am a grown witch of sound mind and body, with a capable wand and a steady hand. I did not ask you out today for my own protection, but for the simple fact that I worry about my only child wasting his days away with no company other than myself and the house elves.”
“Fine, I suppose I should have rung before putting my head through,” Draco conceded before turning to give Blaise a flat look. “What’s your excuse then? The sitting room, Blaise. Your
Draco swung around and gave Potter a venomous glare, rudely dragged out of his reverie. Potter glared back, crossing his arms in a gesture that
“I don’t know what I did wrong! I’m so confused and angry and hurt, and it’s like my mind is in a mess. This whole thing was crazy to begin with I know. Ron thought I’d finally cracked when I told him that you were going to the movies with us and when I kept meeting you he even suggested seeing a Mind Healer. And at first I thought this was just about getting over stupid school rivalries and the kids liked you so I thought what the heck, I might as well hang out with you. But you just had to go and be
Draco raises an amused brow. “Why, I believe I am playing an absolutely fabulous trick on my gullible boyfriend. Really Harry, did you honestly think you were some snake lord?”
“Might I remind you that not too long ago I caught you having a heated argument with your reflection?”
Draco felt as if he’d been petrified by a basilisk as he watched Potter’s frantic look morph into one of utter relief. He knelt down and took them all in his arms at once, peppering kisses all over them. And then he smiled and Draco felt the breath leave him in a rush. Since when had Potter been able to smile like
Potter flushed a pretty pink. “You’ll find Al is to blame.” he replied with a weary shake of the head. He’s hidden somewhere in
“I’m not supposed to do even the easiest of spells for at least two weeks,” Potter sighed. “That’s been a bit harder to get used to. I never really realised how dependant I’ve grown to magic until now.”
Pansy actually gave her a small smile and a nod. Blaise blew her a cheeky kiss and then the connection was cut.
Kreacher had already pulled a fresh batch of pies out of the oven and they were resting on a cooling tray. Draco reached for a plate to pile them on and waved Kreacher off when he hurried over to help.
If possible, Bob’s smile brightened. “Certainly, Mr Potter! Let me just show you our selection.” He completely ignored Draco as he started rummaging below the counter, making a fine racket, and Draco was deeply offended. He may have been a fake customer at this point, but he’d still got there first! Talk about biased customer service.
“From the way he used to dress, you’d never figure Potter was swimming in galleons. It explains how he could afford to get you such an extravagant gift though.”
“I’m not asking if you find him handsome,” she continued. “That’s a bit of a given. What I want to know is if you see a potential partner in him.”
“If you want, you should come.” he said. “The children will be spending the day at the Burrow though so it’ll just be me, but I’m sure Dromeda would love to have you. I have lunch with her every Saturday.”
“After a few minutes of general ogling, I noticed that one of them seemed to be looking back. I sort of panicked at that point and quickly looked away, pretending in vain that I hadn’t been drooling over his gorgeous body emerging from the waves. When I risked a glance back, I was further panicked to see that he seemed to be coming towards me.”
“I can be romantic,” Harry protested, looking insulted. “And anyways, the hot sex that followed only added to an already magical moment.”
At the same time, Draco also knew that he’d overreacted and quite possibly made an utter berk of himself. He shouldn’t have flared up and huffed away like a child throwing a tantrum, but he couldn’t seem to help it when it came to Potter. He had a horrible tendency to making Draco feel insecure and defensive and uncomfortably sixteen all over again.
Draco wasted no more time, quickly casting a levitation spell on the girl, and gently easing her up out of the hole and onto the ground near the others. The next thing he knew, there were squeals all around him and he was being tackled by three excited children.
Draco pretended to consider this. “I suppose evil birds surpass prankster brothers in terms of danger, but I’d still have paid good money to see the Weasley twins take on the Lucius peacocks.”
“Er…” Potter visibly struggled with himself, fidgeting and rubbing at his neck. “I just– where are you going?”
Draco unintentionally opened his mouth to ask a question but Potter seemed to have read his mind and beat him to it.
As soon as he’d rushed home from Grimmauld place, Ginny had appeared in his fireplace, demanding that he talk to her. He’d told her, in as little words as he could, that he hadn’t agreed to help Potter just to be insulted and reminded of his past, and that he had no intention whatsoever of returning. She’d been understanding, if not a bit too bent on getting him to allow Potter to ‘apologise’. He still scoffed at the thought, not needing to hear another one of Potter’s Ginny-induced apologies.
Draco sent him a grateful look, promptly seeing the mocking words for what they really were – Weasley’s way of diffusing an awkward situation.
“Who doesn’t what?” The amused voice that cut in was one that Draco knew all too well. It had featured in his dreams last night after all.
As they passed a darkened alleyway, the Weaslette pulled out her wand and shot a quick spell into the darkness, hardly even glancing at it beforehand. She laughed at the crash and sharp exclamation that followed, and tucked her wand away.
“You know, you’re sort of terrifying when you talk like that,” Ginny told him seriously. “You’d make a brilliant banker. I’m sure the goblins would love you for your ruthlessness.”
Draco heaved a weary sigh as he saw Harry making his way towards where he was standing alone. The unrelenting bastard had his mouth set in a hard determined line and Draco quickly darted over to where his mother was chatting with Fleur, almost bowling over George in his haste. It was too troublesome to think of them all as ‘Weasley’ so he’d taken Hermione’s advice and started calling them by name, though he still continued to call her husband ‘Weasley’. When her prompting had made him try out ‘Ronald’, they’d both given exclamations of disgust and Weasley had begged him never to call him that again lest he be sick. Draco was all too happy to oblige and Hermione had relented with a muttered “
“I was planning on having a short read before meeting up with Potter.” Draco answered, pushing the book back into its shelf. “We’re taking the children to see Luna. She wants our help catching ‘tufflepoks by the brook.”
George nodded. “They got married a few months after Harry. It was splashed all over the papers and it came as a bit of a surprise as we’d thought Parkinson was madly in love with
Draco gave his back a bemused look and then went on his way. His wand was in a temperamental mood that day and he didn’t want to risk a splinching trying to Apparate home, leaving the public Floo at the Leaky as the only other option. No one liked him there of course, but there wasn’t a sign outside that barred his admittance (yet), and there wasn’t anything they could really do about. Draco took an inordinate amount of satisfaction in cheerfully waving at the glowering bartender just before he stepped into the Floo.
Just the other day they’d fixed up a lovely crib mobile and if they managed to get the carousel back into shape as well, Draco was certain the two items would be perfect presents for Teddy’s upcoming birthday. Potter had initially been against the idea of giving Teddy ‘someone’s old junk’, but Draco had assured him that giving family relics was what was generally done for a wizarding child’s first birthday and that he could offer him more than one present if he truly wished to.
“Oh, bollocks!” Pansy suddenly wailed. “I wish we were back in the good old days when we’d be lounging by the Lake without a care in the world. I’d be leaning against a tree with Draco’s head in my lap, Blaise sprawled beside him…”
“Your concern is touching – though unwarranted,” Draco eventually managed. “I think word has got out that Molly Weasley’s adopted me and now everyone’s practically walking on eggshells around me. An Auror I’ve never met before even came up to me and
that,” he manages to grit out, teeth clenched against the pain. Draco reaches out to gently prise his hand away from the impressive bump, and then murmurs something, his wand already out and pointed at Harry’s head. The relief is instantaneous and if Harry wasn’t already in love with Draco, he would be now.
“Ginny already told me you were gay actually. It was her idea that I try my luck with you, but I was nervous and I didn’t know how to go about it. You seemed interested though.” He looked so forlorn now and Draco desperately wanted to give him something to smile about.
His mother looked so carefree as she nattered on about the many things she would make for him when she’d mastered cooking, and he swallowed the lump had suddenly come to his throat.
“Are you alright?” Mrs Spencer suddenly asked with a sweet motherly concern. “You look rather pale, dear.”
Rose frowned. “That isn’t a very nice thing to say Draco. Mommy says to never say things that could hurt people’s feelings.”
“It’s a weekday afternoon so it isn’t crowded.” Potter explained. “I never take the kids during rush hour because Merlin knows, with this lot I’m bound to lose one in the crowd.” He sent a fond look over at the children. “They’re a handful, but they’re
Draco took in her earnest expression and sighed. “I suppose that was… kind of you,” he bit out grudgingly. “Deals a rather solid blow to my pride, but in my defence, I haven’t been on a broom since…”
“If it bothers you so much, Weasley, I can go change,” Draco said as he got up from bed. “Would dress robes suit his majesty?”
“That shirt really does look lovely on you.” Luna commented as they walked down the driveway. They could always have
“No need. He was just moaning on about how he was going to die and if you hadn’t come along, I’d just have to suffer through more of it.”
“I’ll be applying for the Healer programme next,” he went on with not a small amount of pride colouring his voice. “With my aunt’s help, I spoke to the head of the programme and he said that as long as I obtain the required N.E.W.T.s, he’s willing to overlook my part in the War. He thinks it’ll be a good way of making amends anyways.”
Draco carelessly got to his feet, only to lurch forward almost immediately as sharp pain shot through his ankle. To his immense surprise,
Draco gave an anguished exclamation and pulled his head out of the flames again, flopping onto his back with a loud groan. He wondered if he’d be able to self-obliviate himself without ending up in the Janus Thickey ward.
“Actually,” Granger spoke up again. “We were talking about how I pose a hindrance to my own team. As such, couldn’t we call someone else to play Chaser? George, you’re dating Angelina, right? Think she’d be up for a game?”
“So, I suppose I should start off the annual Potter-Malfoy family Hogwarts discussion.” Albus began self-importantly. “Not beating around the bush, the wonderful House of Ravenclaw took the House cup this year!”
“That’s wonderful Mother.” he said in a voice that wavered a bit. His mother eyed him narrowly for a minute before turning to his aunt.
Draco stared at the boy, struck speechless. His mother had told him about her eldest sister who had married a Muggleborn. Though his aunt had been disowned and labelled as a blood traitor, his mother had never spoken an ill word about her and Draco could see that she missed her sister dearly. Draco had never met his cousin Nymphadora but he’d heard from his mother that she’d died in the War. He’d had no idea she’d left a child behind – his own cousin in fact.
Draco smiled tightly. “Was there any reason you called for me, Mother? And it’s nice to see you Aunt Dromeda, and Cousin Teddy too.”
rubbish. Ms Joyce had a certain flair for the dramatic and he’d been shocked by the sheer number of ways to indirectly mention a man’s cock.
For the rest of the time spent blowing up balloons, Draco steadfastly ignored Potter the best he could. He certainly wasn’t sneaking glances down at him, and if his hand happened to brush against Potter’s hair every now and then, well, it wasn’t done on purpose. Most important of all, Draco was definitely, undoubtedly, most assuredly,
Draco felt stupid, even as he forced out a laugh. Really, he was turning into a Hufflepuff, getting his hopes up over every little thing.
,” Draco added when Potter got a hopeful look of his face. “And most probably dream about a sexy blonde wizard with rather exceptional acting skills.”
Weasley laughed, though not unkindly. “I’m not going to say anything, Malfoy. Not really my business, now is it?”
Blaise looked entirely too smug for a disembodied head floating in a fireplace. “All that says is that we were so impassioned with each other, we couldn’t even make it to my room.”
“Bloody buggering fuck!” he screams and then yells again when he unconsciously steps back under the shower and shampoo drips into his eyes. Snape is still standing there sneering at him and Harry quickly reaches down to cover his bits, but ends up knocking his elbow against the tiled wall and then slipping on the sudsy floor quite spectacularly. He makes a wild grab at the shower curtain but it isn’t strong enough to support his weight and he pulls it down with him as he falls, landing in a tangled heap. He narrowly misses banging his head on the ground, but his arm takes the brunt of the fall and he groans piteously.
Draco was busy arranging plates of buns and sandwiches on the long table they’d set out on the lawn. The others were either setting up the tables and lawn chairs or helping to carry plate after plate of food out of the house. Molly seemed to have made enough food to rival the Hogwarts welcoming feast. He was just finishing up when he felt a hand on his arm and he swung around at once, assuming that Harry had finally caught him.
Harry gave him a fierce look and he obediently shut up again. “And then we kissed and it felt like I was dying all over again but this time I never wanted it to end, and you called me
“Malfoy, has anyone told you that you’re amazing?” Potter cut in abruptly, looking completely wrecked. “You can really add me?”
“I was just thinking…” Potter trailed off, biting his lip for a moment before continuing. “Since I’m at home all day now, you’ve been coming here first thing in the morning and leaving late.”
“Are you sure you want to do this?” Dean asks in way of greeting, but he’s already unpacking and enlarging the items in his briefcase, setting them down on the floor.
Potter kissed like he fought; with reckless abandon and pure intent. He moved an arm to wrap firmly around Draco’s waist as the other gripped his jaw, and Draco whimpered softly as the kiss quickly gained heat. Potter was just as good a kisser as he was at pretty much everything he did, and it wasn’t long before Draco was kissing back, clumsily trying to catch up to Potter as he sailed ahead confidently.
“Well now, I don’t think that’s very hygienic,” Draco pointed out weakly, desperately trying to bring the conversation to safer waters.
“This was a bad idea,” Draco said out loud and immediately regretted it when Potter gave a small grunt and opened his eyes groggily.
“Oh Draco,” his mother sighed. “You really need to catch up on the gossip. You’re dreadfully behind. Why I remember when you were at the height of it all, always bringing me tit bits about everything and everyone. I never did find out who you’re sources were but I always thought –”
The ‘wounds’ are still wet and rapidly stain the t-shirt just the way Harry had wanted. Dean sets his brushes away and picks up the small bucket of paint.
“He’s so mean to me,” Ginny grumbled. She pulled Harry’s hand towards her and took a sip of his drink, casual as can be. Draco deliberately looked away.
Draco shook his head in disbelief. “Honestly, Weasley, everyone knows that you should never interfere in the kitchen when a house elf is present. It’s like one of the laws of the universe.”
“Why, were you afraid my brothers would eat you?” she asked with a laugh, leading him to sit out on the veranda overlooking the fields behind the house. “I’m pretty sure none of them have a taste for ferret so you needn’t worry.”
? Draco watched as the children were cuddled within an inch and felt uncomfortably as if he was intruding on a private moment. Eventually Potter seemed done with his barrage of kisses and held them tightly against him one last time before letting them go and standing up. Only then did he look over and finally see Draco still sprawled under the tree. Draco hurriedly got to his feet, cursing when he stumbled.
“I didn’t think,” Harry finally says helplessly, gently kissing first one cheek and then the other, tasting the salt of Draco’s tears. “I’m an idiot, I’m sorry.”
” Potter said with a wry smile. “I thought I’d never get the hang of being a dad, but it turns out I’m a natural. Diaper-changing happened to be one of my specialties.” He laughed. “I don’t think Ginny changed a diaper more than five times during the whole of our marriage.”
Potter looked at him with grudging respect. “A worthy parry,” he acknowledged and then grimaced. “How do you even know about that?”
“What are you doing here?” Draco snapped, wanting to get away from Harry as fast as he could, but finding himself unable to move.
“Maybe if you didn’t dress like a cross between a homeless kid and a gay stripper?” Weasley suggested gruffly.
His aunt paused in her rolling to take a look at the contents of the bowl. “A cup should suffice. You’ve mixed it beautifully Cissy.”
The resulting violent shudder and grimace are answer enough and Harry pushes Draco none too gently aside as he exits the bathroom, the towel slung low on his hips. He has a feeling this will be Draco’s last trick, but right now he’s not in the mood to appreciate that. Instead his mind is whirring with ways to get Draco back.
Harry is almost finished now, and begins to plan out what to do about dinner. He’s been meaning to try his hand at making stew, which he knows Draco simply adores. It’s one of the only ‘plebeian foods’ Draco will admit to liking and Harry is sure he’ll be able to produce something edible, even if it’ll be his first time trying.
Draco’s breath hitched as he took in the man before him. Not too long ago he’d had that mess of hair tangled in his fingers and those stunning eyes looking at him with such
There was a chorus of ‘aww’s and ‘come on’s and Potter lifted his hands in a placating manner. “Hey, we don’t need a house to fly. We’re wizards aren’t we? We have brooms.”
“Malfoy, just stop,” Potter cut in wearily. “You can be such an idiot sometimes, so I’ll keep this simple. You didn’t do it on purpose, I’m fine now, I really hate apologies,” he ticked these off on his fingers, “And I’d like to move on with my life, if you don’t mind. Can we just
James whooped again and did a small dance that made Lily squeal with laughter. “Dwaco come?” she smiled up at him and he nuzzled his nose into her cheek.
A competitive gleam came into Ginny’s eyes. “No, I think we should make this a fair game. What’s your broom model?”
“Oh Draco, what if she doesn’t want to see me? I was so horrid to her after all.” She wrung her hands pathetically.
“I’m gonna call you Draco,” Potter announced. “Draaa-coo. It makes my tongue tickle.” He then proceeded to clumsily climb onto Draco’s lap. Draco was too stunned to do anything but gape as Potter settled down with a contented sigh.
Draco Floo-ed back to his room with a heavy heart, knowing that he was unlikely to get any sleep that night. Usually he’d speak to his mother before going to bed, but he didn’t feel fit for company. He’d go to bed and try to forget for a moment that Potter had come back into his life and set it to flame.
It was a Potter-Malfoy tradition of sorts for the family to sit down at the end of each school year and discuss the events that occurred. They’d been doing it from James’ first year and it looked like it would continue on until Lily graduated. The children were all keen letter writers – James surprisingly being the most attentive, sometimes sending them in the space of a few days, but Draco personally loved these little family bonding times. Sometimes he could hardly believe that this near perfect life was actually his and just sitting together with them, talking about menial things like House points and detentions, helped to make it feel
George pushed himself off the wall. “I’m a pretty good listener no matter what anyone says. And thank you for sharing it all with me. I think you
“I’m so glad you called,” she said gratefully. “My mum was about to drag me to go hat shopping, and she always takes
“Edward Lupin!” she barked and the boy looked sheepish, hiding behind Potter. “We’ve told you before, you cannot just change your appearance when in the Muggle world. You’re lucky no one else was around or you’d have been in big trouble.”
“Master Draco!” Kreacher trilled happily, wizened face twisting into his version of a smile. “Is Master Draco wanting something to eat? Kreacher is so happy to serve the child of Mistress Cissy.”
have looked like that of a petulant child but instead turned out as if Potter was exuding masculine authority from his biceps alone. Draco bit the inside of his cheek, not liking the direction his thoughts were headed.
“You must introduce me to this mysterious Rolf.” Draco said with a delighted smile. If there was a man who could make his sweet Luna blush like that, he must be very special indeed.
“It’s true,” Ginny chimed, stealing a sip from Potter’s mug. “The Sorting hat wanted to put Harry into Slytherin.”
They eventually came to the apparition point and Draco transferred Lily back to Potter. The little one had fallen asleep towards the end of the movie and he’d managed not to wake her. Draco looked at Potter and suddenly felt awkward. What was one supposed to say in a situation like this?
She took James’ hand and led the way down Diagon. Al held Draco’s hand and they followed close behind. As they walked, James and Al began to tell him about their plans for the coming Saturday.
Weaslette nodded and bestowed on him a comradely grin. “We’ll get along swimmingly then. Oh, and even though I know who you are, I don’t think we’ve ever been properly introduced.” She held out a hand. “Ginevra Weasley, Ginny if you please.”
Potter didn’t seem to know what to say to that and the rest of their walk up to the house was done in silence, they entered though the back door into the kitchen and to Draco’s surprise, found his mother vigorously mixing a bowl of batter, her sleeves rolled up and pretty robes covered by an enormous apron.
… wouldn’t invite you if she wasn’t certain you’d be welcome. Just charm them the way you handled her and Mrs Weasley. You’ll be fine.”
Potter gave a loud cough and Draco gave Lily one last nuzzle just to spite him before looking up. He didn’t look angry though, and even bent down to pick up Draco’s bags.
“Come on,” he said, patting the seat beside him. Draco settled down next to him with Lily snuggling up on his lap.
“Young man, you should be ashamed of yourself!” she reprimanded fiercely, glaring up at Thin Lips. “In all my days I have never witnessed such disgusting behaviour. Good heavens, and in the middle of the street, no less!”
“Really though,” Potter continued more seriously. “All I can offer you is the satisfaction of doing a good deed by helping a bloke out.”
“And do tell me,” Draco continued with a grimace, “Why do both your boy toys look the same? Some weird kinky game of yours involving Polyjuice?”
“So Malfoy, have to be somewhere or would you like to join us?” Ginevra asked in a genial tone. “We’re headed to get some perfume for my mum and I’m sure you’d be able to find some to suit Mrs Malfoy as well.”
“No excuses, Malfoy,” Potter spoke up from the doorway. “If you’re helping me, the least I can do is invite you to join me for dinner. Take a seat, unless you want to eat in the dining room.”
Draco picked up the clothes and examined them. They seemed to be in his size alright and the short-sleeved button down shirt was in a lovely shade of green. The exact green of Harry’s eyes in fact.
“Draco, why…” Harry trails off. His eyes are stinging, his whole body is aching, and he’s shivering with cold now too. He can’t even muster up the energy to be mad at Draco, meekly allowing himself to be helped off the floor and wiped down with a warm fluffy towel.
Albus smirked. “Even if we had cheated, you brawny Gryffindors would never figure out how we did it.”
“It was a bloody brilliant catch too,” George called out from the other side of the room and nearly upset his drink over Angelina. Draco lifted his own glass in salute.
Draco closed his eyes momentarily. “It’s tempting, but the answer is still no. I can’t leave my mother alone over here. Apart from Aunt Dromeda and Teddy, I’m all she has.”
“The point is,” Granger continued sternly. “You really should visit him, and if you don’t want to help him with the library anymore, at least tell him that.”
“Go on then, blow,” Potter whispered, and was it just Draco’s perverse imagination, or had his voice suddenly gone husky?
Draco weakly returned his smile and then turned away again. Maybe… maybe it would be better if he told Potter how he felt. It would probably ruin their friendship, not to mention his friendship with Ginny. His heart clenched at that. He was going to miss her, maybe even more than Potter.
“That’s Harry for you,” Ginny said with a fond smile, and Draco remembered that the two of them had become a couple during sixth year. Well, good for Potter. To think the messy-haired git could actually land a catch like Ginny Weasley.
As he’d eaten, Mrs Weasley had puttered about the kitchen chattering away about Merlin knew what. He thought she’d said something about radishes? But he wasn’t too sure, having been too busy trying not to groan in pleasure after each spoonful of stew. It had been divine. He’d been finishing up when the children trooped in. They’d disappeared for a while but eventually they had come back, this time including Teddy and the Potters. Introductions had been made and then somehow he’d been roped into babysitting and shooed to the childrens’ playroom.
“Oh, did Narcissa get the new release?” Pansy asked excitedly. “I must borrow it. The last one with the chimney sweep was simply delicious!”
Soon she was with him in the sitting room and he led her shakily back to the library. Kreacher was hitting himself with a large book and was bawling about how his master was dying, but Potter’s screams seemed to have subsided, replaced by exhausted whimpers. The streaks had spread up to his elbow by now and when Andromeda caught sight of them, she gasped.
