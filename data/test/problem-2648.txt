“He’s on our side now,” Hermione said reprovingly.
“Fine,” he said, “Not Snape.” He relaxed back in his chair. He glanced down at the book, his heart was beating fast. “Are you nervous?” he asked.
“You have no idea how good it feels to hear your annoying voice,” Harry sighed, spotting Draco. The Alpha just raised an eyebrow as he smirked.
The lanterns came on at some point as the night sky rose around them, and a little after that the train started to slow down into a station. Harry looked out the window to see rows of carriages waiting for them, and a new round of nerves filled him. An announcement filled the train telling them to leave the luggage and exit the train. “We can run,” he said. “We can run and just disappear for a while. Find some way to Durmstrang.”
“I did,” Harry nodded, “and with Viktor gone, my heats ended as well. I was dry during fifth year. I actually thought that I would never experience a heat again. Then I met Draco Malfoy out of school and, yeah he’s a gigantic prick I won’t even try to defend him on that, but we started talking, our talks became more serious and before I knew it…” Harry lifted up his bonding necklace, “my heat came back, and Draco and I entered a courtship. However, I’m still yelling at him to fix his attitude. And though we are dating, Draco and I have never, you know. Viktor has been the only Alpha, the only person, I’ve ever been with. And that’s basically it,” he ended. “That’s the truth.”
“I know, even still this is bad business, Mr. Riddle,” Professor McGonagall said. She looked at Harry, “I expect you have all of your assignments your professors have given you completed before you come back on Monday after the trial, Mr. Riddle,” she said. “I will see you then.”
“With my arms of course,” Harry said. He placed both back in the bag and laid down. “I needed this,” he sighed. “I just… it was hard in there.”
“Yes Sir,” Harry said. Draco’s hand moved from Harry’s wrist to the back of his neck, where it laid firm but comfortable. The two walked, Harry telling Draco how to get into the Room of Requirement.
“So what does that mean?” Uncle Remus asked.
“You are not a Romeo character,” Uncle Sirius chimed in, sitting down with two cups of tea.
“Harry, you are the strongest wizard I have ever known,” Sirius said, smiling. “Believe me, after all, you have gone through, your mother and father would be so proud of you Harry.”
“The two sound nothing alike the way you say it,” Uncle Remus ranted. “You always use a high ‘a’ for basil and a low ‘a’ for the other word so don’t you dare tell me you were going to say basil!”
“You said… that you were unkillable,” Harry said, looking up at his father. “Because of your Horcruxes.”
“Why is that, Harry?” Dumbledore asked.
“What?”
“See? Confidence and dominance,” Cedric smirked, “come on,” he patted Ron’s back and led him away. Ron followed eagerly, smiling happily to himself at the thought of his new lessons.
Voldemort smiled at her, “Professor McGonagall, there is no need to be tense. As we have spoken about, my irk and the trial on Monday is solely on Dumbledore, not Hogwarts.”
Harry glared at the photo of Umbridge smiling widely and blinking slowly at him. He turned up to the staff table to see Umbridge sitting, looking smart and proud. “This is utter bullshit,” he muttered. “They reward this woman for butchering my hand! And you—” he turned to Draco, giving him a sharp look, “Did you know your father would do this?”
“So our Dark Lord gotten himself pregnant by himself and gave birth to you?” Draco asked.
“Just watch,” Harry winked. He walked towards a dark corner and looked around but found no red eyes. He frowned, “Shadow walkers,” he explained. “Creatures that exist only in the shadows and darkness… they allow me to move from the Dursleys’ to here… but I guess they won’t show themselves if you’re looking.” He frowned and turned, “Sorry Draco.”
“Excuse me?” Draco said immediately. “Weasley said what?” He glared at Neville, who jumped a little.
Harry blushed and hugged Draco, kissing his cheek. He turned to Ron, who looked sheepishly.
Harry handed in his potion with the others and grimaced at the state of some of the potions. One looked like complete tar while the other looked like boiled putrid puke. “Is there a problem Mr. Potter?” Snape said, getting his attention.
“I just won’t Harry, that’s all,” Uncle Sirius said. Harry didn’t like that answer, however he stayed quiet about it.
“You like me,” Ron repeated.
“We need better than good,” Draco said, “or else I’ll steal your boy for myself.” He laughed with a smirking smile. Blaise glared at him while Theo laughed as well. “I’m joking,” Draco said. “But I am serious about this trip being a date for everyone. I don’t want to hear about any of us not on a date.”
Harry did not hear him as he was busy checking the fire under the cauldron. He then took out a knife and started cutting the ingredients he’s chosen. Draco moved to the front of the classroom and sat on the teacher’s desk. He now had an uninterrupted chance to watch Harry work, and he didn’t want to miss it.
“Brothers! Sisters! An Unholy Samhain to you all!” Mr. Riddle, now in his official robes, called out. “As is tradition our younger members have practiced a dance to appease Lord Satan and his demons! Let us all witness their effort and pray for Lord Lucifer to bless us on this eve.” The candles all went out before burning with a bright, furious red, giving everything a red tint. The teenagers walked on, Blaise’s eyes on his boys. Music drifted in from the wind, as though a ghostly orchestra was leading them, and the dance began.
His thoughts were interrupted when Professor McGonagall walked in, followed by Madam Pomfrey. “Students,” she began. Her usual stoic features with her thin lips quivered and broke. She clenched her heart as sadness washed over her face. “I am terribly sorry to say, that we have lost one of our own today. Fred Weasley, our source of great foolery and tricks,” she sniffled and tried to smile, but failed. “I’m sorry,” she interrupted, reaching for a tissue from her pocket. She dabbed her eyes with it before holding it. “Fred Weasley is gone. He has passed away overnight. I would like that we keep this quiet for now while I inform…” she took a breath, her face scowling momentarily, “the headmistress,” it went away, “and his family. I thank you all for understanding, and empathy for the Weasley family and friends for this sudden, tragic lost.”
Theo shrugged and looked around; it was a cloudy, cold night. “Just wanted to walk around for a moment,” he said, “believe it or not, Slytherins can be insufferable at times.”
Uncle Sirius stood up quite suddenly and turned to Mr. Malfoy. “I would ask you, while you are under my roof, to keep your opinions to yourself, Mr. Malfoy. Especially if they are nothing but empty insults.”
“Wow,” Harry said, rolling his eyes. “I told you this is the quickest way. I know that this isn’t the most… exciting, but it is the safest method.”
His hand ached as he worked through the night, deciding to finally go to bed around two in the morning when he could barely keep his head up. His sleep was restless, and all he thought about was sending his letter when he woke up the next morning.
Sirius whirled around to see Mundungus Fletcher standing in the doorway. “Well, that’s a surprise, ain’t it?” he said.
did not fade from the back of Niall’s hand, but remained scratched there, oozing droplets of blood. His pause made Professor Umbridge look up.
“As if we would be the ones,” a high female voice said, “would you imagine being stuck with him for the rest of our lives?”
Mr. Riddle smiled at that, he kissed Remus’s hand then cheek. “I love it,” he whispered, “and if she is a beautiful girl, I am sure we can come up with feminine versions.”
“Viktor?” Harry said hesitantly. “Viktor it’s me… Harry.”
Loki stretched out on his floating throne. “Oh no worry mortals, I already have several plans—do you want him maimed, dead, decapitated—”
“I wouldn’t worry about it too much, Omega,” Draco whispered, “just focus on you and me, eh? Only opinions who matter.”
Krum’s Tale
“Oh god,” he muttered and rushed to his bed. It was an impossible task, sifting through the piles of torn pages and envelopes, looking for anything that resembled his friends’ handwriting. He saw much more insults than he heard. Words like “whore” and “disgrace” written multiple times. It hurt him, seeing the words, but he was thankful in that none of that handwriting looked familiar at all.
“That you will tell your godfather and friends,” Draco said. “You did disappear yesterday without a trace.”
Harry laughed and allowed his Alpha to pull him along. “This is going to be so much fun!” he smiled, “Who do you think is going to yell first? You or my friends?”
Detention with Delores
“Aren’t you angry?” Ron demanded. “She called Harry a whore!”
“It wasn’t until the middle of October that they came back to me about it. This was a week or two before the other schools came here, Cedric. They cornered me in the Gryffindor common room and dragged me away to an isolated place. ‘We have the solution to your problems, Harry,’ Fred said. ‘We know what you are and how you can get your man!’ George said happily. I asked what they meant, and George said, ‘Well from what you told us, you want to be kinky Harry!’ ‘Or,’ Fred said, ‘You have desires to enter into a relationship that, compared to others, seem off or weird. What we mean is that you are naturally a submissive.’ I was confused, so I asked them what exactly they meant. It was a long explanation, they told me about dominant/submissive culture, sex, it was very awkward and very, uhh, well you know, don’t you Cedric?
His awareness began to fade, feeling in his body started to nub before a cold sensation took over. Voldemort inhaled deeply and felt his awareness move from himself to Nagini. When next he opened his eyes, he saw his body sitting in front of him, his eyes closed. In Nagini’s body, Voldemort hissed and felt the magic swirl around him as he teleported away, using his son’s memories to find the Burrow.
“Now, do we all know each other here?” Slughorn asked. “I take it you obviously know Draco Malfoy and Blaise Zabini here,” he motioned to Draco and Blaise. “This is Cormac McLaggen, perhaps you’ve come across each other—? No?”
There were two spots open, and Harry took the one next to Theo, smiling brightly at him. “Good morning Theo, how did you sleep?” he asked as he lifted up his wrist.
“So we’ll have to find a way to keep him away,” Uncle Sirius said, “And I’ll be dead before I let a crucifix in here…”
“What’s happening to Harry?” Niall asked.
Dumbledore knocked on the door half an hour later, and the boys sat down behind Remus’ desk. Remus opened the door for the headmaster and returned to sit with his boys. “Harry, Niall, it is pleasant to see you both are well,” Dumbledore said, giving them both a grandfatherly smile. “And Remus, it is good to see you are settling in.”
The gang came together after classes were over, generally hanging out. Draco couldn’t help but notice Ron giving Blaise strange looks and decided to pocket that thought for later. They had dinner together, Hermione and Daphne dragging the boys into the library to study for a while before they separated to sleep.
Thankfully, their food arrived a couple of minutes afterward. Two huge slices of pizza both with bacon, ham, sausage, and pepperoni, and a serving of mozzarella sticks between them with a small cup of marinara sauce. “Jesus, I’m dragging you to the gym after tomorrow,” Draco muttered. Harry laughed and immediately grabbing his pizza. He folded the crust and took a large bite, moaning. Draco picked his pizza up with both hands and took a smaller bite. It was good, really good, and Draco immediately took a second bite as soon as he had room in his mouth.
He took his wand from his bedside and stood facing his bedroom door, listening with all his might. Next moment he jumped as the lock gave a loud click and his door swung open.
“Yeah, I’m more concerned about Ginny,” Harry nodded. “Sorry that that had to happen.”
Nagini hissed.
“I’m—so—stupid!” Harry huffed as he continued to run all the way down into the dungeons where he followed his instinct to find his Alpha. The Omega reached a dead end and clawed at the walls before remembering the password. He screamed it and ran inside before the doorway was fully open.
“That is not how it goes, Potter,” Voldemort said. “Who will you kill first? You are to provide to me a name.”
He lifted up Harry’s hand, so all could see his mark. Harry did not know what to do or how to feel about it. A sense of dread began to bubble as well as guilt as he remembered the lustful eyes that were set upon him. He looked around at his coven and saw the smiling faces, beaming with pride as their applause filled the air. Uncle Sirius and Uncle Remus looked just as confused as Harry was, yet they clapped with the coven, though Harry could see the pure concern in both their eyes. And then there was Draco. His silver eyes were full of such wondrous pride and happiness as he clapped the loudest and the fastest. On his face was the largest grin Harry has ever seen, which offset the bored, mask-like faces his parents wore. Their eyes met and Harry couldn’t help but feeling a little proud, happy that whatever happened caused his boyfriend happiness. With Draco’s support Harry was able to look around at the coven, his coven, and smiled.
“Missed you too boyfriend,” Harry smiled. “So, did you get it?”
“How so?” Voldemort asked, both amused and offended.
“Well… I was kind of trying to get his father—” Harry stopped when he saw the pale look on Mr. Riddle’s face. Blaise saw that and smirked, “And he would have gotten him too, if I didn’t intervene.”
was talking about was true? And that it was actually talking about Longbottom instead of Potter?”
Draco was sitting with his friends, he looked happy, as though nothing was bothering him. Harry frowned a little, wishing that Draco could feel at least some discord of what Harry had inside him. The blonde, either by coincidence or feeling Harry’s gazed, turned to stare at the Gryffindor table. Their eyes met and Draco’s lips turned upright in a smile. Despite his feelings, Harry found himself smiling back, filled, temporarily, with a love so raw and passionate that only the young and naive could know it. He wanted to kiss Draco and be with him, to sit next to him at such a time, and yet know that he needed to be away, at least for tonight, until he was done with his confusion.
“I know that the Son of Lucifer is bound to you, however, he is not the only demon in our town at the moment,” Mr. Riddle said. He took a step closer and stared at Harry, making the boy feel uneasy. “Remember, Harry, what I have told you the first day. Keep your wits about you, boy. Keep your head low, and do not do anything stupid. You have been chosen by the Dark Lord for his mission. You have a special womb, it would be wise to protect it.”
“James Potter was a man who fought for what he believed in, meanwhile Lord Voldemort is a ruthless monster who needs to be overthrown,” Harry said. He looked up at Greengrass, his emerald eyes cold and hateful. The girl flinched at the stare alone. “You seem so fearless talking so openly about stuff like this,” Harry said, glancing around the pub. “So full of students, so full of people from Dumbledore. Just one word and you’ll be in trouble, Greengrass.” He chuckled and shook his head, “Not even mentioning what my husband will do when he catches you here.”
Harry felt an awful feeling in his stomach and kept his head down for the rest of class, silently taking notes. He was grateful when a low bell rang throughout the school signaling the end of class. Harry and Draco immediately held hands, their other hand with their schedule as they compared them.
Harry asked Theo to show him where the owlery was, and the two boys went down there before breakfast. “I didn’t see you get into bed, when did you come in?” Theo asked as they climbed the stairs to the owlery.
“Because I’m an Omega,” he said simply.
“That was weird what he said,” Blaise nodded, “however now I’m worried, who else would be here besides me? I would notice immediately.”
“The First Task was tough… well, you know personally how tough it was, Cedric, however it was harder for me. I didn’t want to embarrass myself in front of Draco, I didn’t want to die in front of him. So I did all I could, flying around, however by the end of it I knew that I needed to learn more afterwards. So I did something I never thought I would… I’ve delved deeper into the dark arts. The more I learned… the more I understood that I knew nothing.
Harry thought,
Harry’s heart, however, was too sunken to give a response. The Dark Lord was coming here. To Little Whinging. He did not know how to respond to this; however, he was scared. Not for his Lord appearing so suddenly, but what he will do to his Aunt, Uncle, and cousin. Harry was scared of what the Dark Lord will do once he has learned that he lives with muggles… and these muggles do not treat his new apprentice all too well.
“I’m sixteen… it’s too soon… this can’t be right,” Harry whispered to himself. “No…”
“Are you gay?” George asked.
“Are you and him really dating?” Dean asked.
“What I mean,” Blaise said, ignoring Harry, “that if you want your nephew to live peacefully, you will order your familiars to get off of me right this second.”
“Come on, Harry needs to rest,” Remus said. The boys pouted but Niall stood up and followed Remus out of Harry’s nest room and downstairs where Sirius was sitting in the living room. Niall sat down across from Sirius as Remus joined his husband.
“Don’t worry about her, Harry, she’s harmless,” Blaise said with a smirk. “Pansy Parkinson, her family’s rather small-time.”
“It does indeed Lucius,” Uncle Sirius said. Both men grimaced.
“Very well,” he said, turning the knife in his hand so that the handle faced Harry. “Then you will give me your blood.”
She left Ginny with her husband Arthur, telling them both that she just needs to pop into the Apothecary. There was a cheerful man standing behind the counter, smiling warmly at her. “Hello, how can I help you?” he asked as she approached.
“Ginny—”
“Zabini!”
ago!”
Bellatrix Lestrange lived by herself in a cozy little cottage on the outskirts of the town. The place was lit mostly by candles and filled with horrific figures and statues that would make a normal person’s skin crawl. The main room of the house had a dusty television that was never used, couches that were situated instead towards a fireplace with a coffee table between them. The fireplace was grand, having a marble mantle on top of which several statues revering Lucifer stood, along with an old oil painting of the Dark God hanging above, it’s figure horned and dark, just as Lestrange remembered. On the coffee table were several dolls in the process of being made, one of them was of a pretty boy with green eyes and black hair, and a full tea pot and biscuits.
“I’ve remembered reading about that as well,” some muttered.
“That’s a load of waffle,” Ron muttered.
A Deadly Meeting
“They’re for Harry, the poor dear,” Mrs. Weasley said sympathetically. “Thank you,” she said, taking the bag that the man placed on the counter. She exited the store happily and placed the small bag into a bigger bag from Flourish and Blotts.
He realized. Shoving the other books away, he began reading with a fevered passion that made his body feel hot as the witch continued to describe the intimate parts of their Lord and how the two met and continued to meet. When he was called for dinner, he brought the journal with him and continued to read as he ate, lost in the witch’s words and her continued meetings with the devil. It was late at night, pass the witching hour, when Harry finished the journal. He stared at the mark on his hand and for the first time felt excited about it. The journal had miraculously given him almost everything he needed. Now he just had to talk with Draco and prepare.
Nobody moved so Harry sighed and began his story. “Yes when I was fourteen, Viktor Krum and I were dating. He was my Alpha and I was his Omega. He taught me everything I knew. He never mentioned a bonding necklace however when we talked, it was always about after school. Marrying after school, carrying his children, becoming his boywife he would call it,” Harry blushed. “I loved the idea, even the name is nice to me, however now I would argue to be called his husband,” he glanced at Draco. “By the end of the year, though, Viktor went away without a goodbye. I was heartbroken, obviously, but fifth year made me quickly forget about my old Alpha. I don’t need to tell you guys what happened last year but during the summer, I met my father, my real father.
“I don’t know,” Harry sighed. “You were amazing but, I always thought the day I lose my virginity would be more romantic.”
Still, Draco will admit that he looked good. He had a lean build and his androgynous face that made him look pretty or hot in anything he wore. Draco Malfoy might have tons of baggage; however, he would always be confident in what he wore whenever he put in the effort. Even when he was with Theo at his worse, he always put in the effort…
Harry told Draco that Blaise and Neville lived on the top floor. The apartment housed college students, so there were little to no strict rules about noise which meant that they were able to practice whenever they wanted. It also helped that the two went around soundproofing the place. It was a nice place, they walked into a large living room with a flat-screen television hanging on the wall with two old armchairs and a leather couch facing it. There was a large speaker from which music was playing, as well as a mic already hooked up for Draco to sing into the blond figured. Through an open window and archway, Draco could see a basic kitchen with a table pushed against the opened wall, stacks of random books and papers just left on there. A small hallway led to three doors, all opened and leading to, Draco guessed, Neville and Blaise’s bedrooms as well as a bathroom.
“My womb is alright,” Harry said, “my father checked it as soon as I told him on the train station before I left for Hogwarts. My womb was weak but still functional. It’s healing now, and my father sent me potions to help with the healing process.”
“You’re doing enough—the desserts and tea and treating my wounds,” Harry said, his cheeks turning red.
“It isn’t a situation that you should worry, Draco,” Uncle Sirius said. “Maybe once you’ve dated for half a year, but for now the two of you barely know each other. To be fair I am shocked you are still here.”
Harry nodded and their lips were together. The kiss was soft and lasting, the boys pressing their lips together as their eyes slid shut. The boys wrapped their arms around the other, Harry feeling electricity coursing through him followed by a heat that warmed every inch of his body. He never wanted to leave, never wanted to get out of Draco’s arms. Finally, everything was over, and he felt safe. They separated for only a moment and smiled at each other before kissing again, cameras flashing all around them.
Blaise first noticed something was wrong by the smell. Everyone including him was focused by the dance, that at first he missed it, however over time the smell grew thicker and more noticeable. It was a rotting smell, a smell that was like raw flesh burning away and rotten eggs mixed together. Blaise stood up and looked around. He heard a slow sound, like something large and heavy was pushing against the floor. The smell became worse with each passing second. Then, quick as a flash, he saw the source jump into the firelight. It was a disgusting monster with a serpentine body, its flesh a pale pink, ooze or slime still sticking to its massive body. At one end was a curved edge while at the other were three appendages, each a long tube like a worm and each five feet long, and a foot thick, at the center-point where they met was a maw of sharp teeth. On each head was more teeth, but no eyes. All four mouths gave a high-pitched screech and the room froze in fear, eyes moving from the dance to the monster.
“Yes, he is. As a matter of fact, he’s a tiny bit late. But don’t worry about him, go straight to bed with you,” Mrs. Weasley smiled. Harry nodded and turned to leave the kitchen. He made it quickly to Fred and George’s room, which seemed to look more like a storage room for their Weasley Wheezes supplies as stacked boxes took up much of the space. Hedwig was perched in a cage by the window, its door opened. She was sleeping, and Harry did not want to disturb her. He placed the letter in the cage and immediately fell to the floor, kicking off his shoes before he fell asleep.
light!” She hiccupped and gave another squawk as tuffs of dull-colored feathers popped off of her fingers. “What—
“When I was about sixteen,” Sirius said. “I’d had enough.”
“I don’t know what would have happened if it hadn’t been for you, Harry,” she said in a muffled voice. “They might not have found Arthur for hours, and then it would have been too late, but thanks to you he’s alive and Dumbledore’s been able to think up a good cover story for Arthur being where he was, you’ve no idea what trouble he would have been in otherwise, look at poor Strugis…”
Harry could feel his hand pulsing at the demon’s sight and presence. Draco’s hand squeezed his other and he glanced at Draco to see the blonde grinning madly. “We did it,” he whispered.
Nagini commented.
“Excuse me?”
“Draco, you don’t need to do that,” Harry said.0
“Now you look like my bitch, Harry,” he said, “My omega.”
“Two idiots who took longer than I thought to get together,” Theo said, and before either could argue, he summoned a house-elf and ordered lunch for the three of them.
“Hmm I don’t know,” the demon shrugged.
“What if it was Draco in detention then?” Harry argued. “What if it was Draco whose hand she was carving into?”
Harry took it from her without saying a word and left the room, not even looking at his twin as he slammed the door behind him. Truth be told, Harry had no idea where Professor Snape’s office was, however, he figured it would be good to start by the dungeon classrooms where he had Potions that morning.
Harry and Draco blushed and quickly removed their clothes, revealing leaking cocks. “Draco get on the bed on your back,” Blaise demanded. “Harry, you’ll lay on top of him.” The two got onto their positions, Harry laying on top of Draco, his back to Draco’s stomach. The blond wrapped his arms around the boy, groping his chest and the two kissed as Draco grinded his hard cock against Harry’s wet, needy hole. Blaise removed his clothes as he approached, his cock fully hard and leaking profusely as he joined Draco teasing Harry’s hole.
Uncle Sirius paused, “More so,” he after a while. “Was this your plan all along, demon?” he asked, looking at Blaise.
“That fucking bitch,” Niall growled. “I told you we should have dealt with her personally, Harry. I told you!”
The door closed and Harry sighed. He looked at Draco and asked, “How many of their families here are loyal to my father? All of them?”
“Okay Dad, and it’s great to see you again Remus,” Harry smiled.
Draco looked down and read,
“Is there anything else?”
“That’s horrible!” Hermione gasped. “But why wouldn’t he? He was your best friend, right?”
Harry nodded and thought for a moment. “We met each other in Diagon Alley,” he began. “Things were happening to the two of us, things that I don’t want to tell you guys yet… Draco can if he wants to. We talked and, did things,” Harry’s cheeks blushed while the others leered lewdly at him, “and I brought him home to the Burrow, the Weasleys’ place.”
“Guys—guys it’s fine… seriously,” Harry said. Hermione still looked annoyed at Ron but kept quiet. Instead she looked at Harry.
“And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching the subject. Professor Slughorn, however, is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with ‘Exceeds Expectations’ at O.W.L. Do you wish to proceed with Potions?”
His pace matched Blaise, and soon all that could be heard in the room was the wet slap of skin the two moans and Draco’s gargling groans as Harry fucked himself on Blaise’s cock and fucked Draco’s mouth spontaneously. The overwhelming sensation caused his balls to seize up and with a high groan, he spilled his seed into Draco’s mouth, the blonde drinking heavily. Blaise spanked Harry’s ass as Draco pulled away, smiling with his eyes shut as the cum whipped all around his face as Harry finished cumming.
“Yup! They were going against the Falmouth Falcons—now that is a violent team! Sirius and Remus refuse to even allow us to go the Magpies games whenever they’re against them!” Niall grinned.
“That remains to be seen,” Yaxley said. Harry resisted to roll his eyes as the old man still kept his charade up.
Harry flinched for whatever curse Parkinson would cast but it never came. Instead there was a shriek and when Harry opened his eyes, he saw Parkinson dangling by her hand in the air. Mr. Riddle was standing at his desk now, Harry never even heard him come in. “Miss Parkinson,” Mr. Riddle sighed, “even though we are in a classroom environment, class has yet to start. I would wish to remind you of the Academy’s rules on magic… now since this is a basic’s course, I see no reason of why you would require both hands.”
“Of course.”
Remus came in with dinner ten minutes later, and Voldemort stood up to help him set the table only for Remus to push him back. “Just relax, you’re going to need to be sitting for this,” Remus said.
“I am,” Draco said carefully. “What about it?”
“No, I don’t think so,” Harry chuckled. His wand fell into his hand from his robe, and with a small swish, the door locked. He looked up at Umbridge, red flakes shining through his green eyes. “I think we should instead, talk about you, Umbridge, and how much of a bitch you are.”
“Like what?” Harry asked. Blaise smirked and pulled Harry’s hand closer, forcing the boy to stumble forward, almost stepping onto the stump.
Harry nodded and immediately started cooking, starting with the coffee. Voldemort sat back and watched both amused and highly curious. Harry made sure that the coffee was ready first and poured his own father a cup before filling his own. Harry glanced at Voldemort to see that the man did not touch his cup at all yet, his dark eyes still on him. Harry brought his cup with him to the oven and sipped casually from it as he cooked. Voldemort watched, Harry could see his mind working behind his eyes, before he reached for his own mug of coffee and took a cautious sip before taking a larger one. He snapped his fingers and a house-elf appeared with a copy of the
“Oh, cool,” Draco hummed. “You’re lucky, having them that involved in your life. My godparents, I mean I saw them but… they weren’t really involved in my life so directly.”
“I don’t want to—I—I grew to like you, however…” Harry found his throat caught. “I cannot condone what you are after Voldemort.”
“Complications…” Harry repeated, his heart dropping. “What do you mean?”
“Oh shut it,” Draco said, “Congratulations, you’ve won…” He looked both happy and annoyed as Harry turned around. “You want your reward here or somewhere else?” he asked. Harry’s face went red and muttered vile things at Draco.
“That’s wonderful,” Draco whispered, “See, focus on the positive. We already know now, you have your dad’s approval. You can start dating Ron without worrying.”
“What do you want Malfoy?” Angelina Johnson, Gryffindor’s Quidditch Captain, said, glaring at him sharply.
“Harrison!” Voldemort said, having enough of his two Omegas arguing. He looked at the two, Harry met his eyes, but Remus looked away, crying. “Remus,” he said, putting every feeling of sorrowful melancholy into his voice. “I regret everything I have done in the last fifteen years. I am not excusing what I have done. The grief of losing both Adrian and Harrison has brought me down to a level of insanity and despair that only meddling recklessly into the Dark Arts can bring. I have lost my mind, my goal, and my sense of being. I cannot excuse what I have done but I can repent. Already I’ve started to take steps to get rid of the Death Eaters. The most dangerous will return to Azkaban where they belong, the others who are not as dangerous will still be punished, however, they will not suffer a life in Azkaban. Only the Malfoys are being forgiven fully because of Harrison, and only because of Harrison. I do not want forgiveness, I know that I do not deserve that, especially from either of you. However Remus, my love, I want repentance. I want to repent, to right everything that has done wrong. I love you, Remus. You and your love has dragged me out of the deepest pits of despair. Please, out of our love, would you please allow me the chance to repent?”
“Thank you for taking me Alpha,” Harry breathed, “I love my collar.” He shifted closer to Draco, a dangerous glint in his eyes as his hands went to the top of Draco’s pants.
This made Malfoy stop. He blinked and looked at Harry, “Hang on, The bloody Boy-Who-Lived is really good at the Dark Arts?”
“In your dreams,” Harry said. He walked around, getting used to the feeling of being plugged, before putting his pants back on while Draco washed his hands. “This plug will be out in twenty minutes,” he said, “when
Harry helped cracked the eggs and cook the bacon while Mrs. Weasley cooked the rest. “No, Harry,” she said at one point when Harry tried to flip the bacon like he always did. “Take out your wand—Dumbledore won’t like this but it’s a bit necessary now.” Harry took out his wand. “Swish it around, like your doing the motion—not to rough now. You boys are always too rough with this sort of things—yes, that’s it good.” Harry moved his wand, and the bacon flipped itself, as well as the melted grease and fat vanished, only to drizzle from his wand to evenly coat the bacon. “That’s how you give it more flavor,” Mrs. Weasley said. “Now keep doing it.”
Harry gagged, spittle drooling from his lips as he became very sweaty, his fur matting against his body. He focused on breathing, each inhale filling his nose and brain with more and more of Draco’s musk. It acted like a relaxant, the boy’s mind going soft and his gag reflex dulling until all he could do was moan as Draco pushed further and further into his throat. Draco moved in long slow strokes, his cock opening Harry’s throat with each thrust, his mouth filling with a mixture of his spit and precum. It all drooled out of the corners of Harry’s mouth, but he didn’t care as his lips tightened and cheeks hollowed. “Good Harry, good pet,” Draco mewled. “Such a sweet omega.”
“Tom Riddle, you idiot,” Remus said, shaking his head lightly. “You could have trusted me with this. What is it with the men I am attracted to and rushing off to do things ‘for Harry’ without thinking?”
“I am trying to figure out a few things, one of them including how a mage so young and inexperienced was able to summon me, of all demons, as well as putting the two of you under my protection until this whole thing shows itself for what it really is,” Blaise said. “You should be thanking me for those marks, these will protect you if the Riddles decide, for whatever reason, to go hostile. Or worse if my father appears. Because believe me Harry, you are too pretty and too innocent to join his harem, if that is what he means to do.”
“What did you do to them? That wasn’t the Imperius Curse,” Harry said.
Somehow, Viktor Krum was here, at Hogwarts once more. Viktor Krum, his first Alpha, the man who taught Harry everything he knew about how to be a good Omega. The man he loved, the man who left him. He was here, now, kissing Harry as though nothing has happened. “Harry, my little wife, oh my sweet Omega,” Viktor Krum said, still holding Harry.
Harry hated him. Draco could feel it. And yet, he didn’t know how to fix it. How to get on the omega’s good side. He heard Harry’s laugh and saw his smile and wanted above all for them to be direct to him. So that was why, after taking the entire day to swallow his pride, Draco Malfoy decided to do the most unMalfoy thing he could think of: he looked to others for help. He decided to go for the source: Niall Potter.
“Infractus” Malfoy said, and with even more reluctance than usual, the couple broke apart, revealing the corridor to the common room. Harry and Draco stepped through holding hands. They reached the common room, where a fire lit itself in the hearth. A couple of fluffy towels were stacked conveniently on the dining table, along with two bath robes. Harry suddenly had an idea.
“None of your bloody business, Potter. Just, look. It’s important. I’m not planning on doing anything evil or god knows what your heroic brain has decided I’m capable of. I just want it back. Don’t you understand that?” Malfoy said, the irritated inflection staining his once calm demeanour. Harry raised an eyebrow.
Draco just cocked an eyebrow and grinned, revealing Harry’s blood staining his white teeth.
“Hah, me neither, been running round this place like a lunatic, didn't even notice the days were also running past me. Well, have a good one Harry.”
Another smile issued from McGonagall's countenance.
It looked as if a bomb had gone off in the room. Harry looked around, bewildered, trying to remember if this really was the way he'd left it. Any piece of furniture that had storage had been emptied, drawers hung from their compartments, shelves were bare, and the floor was strewn with their entrails. Harry knew he'd searched the place, but was this really how he'd left it?
“Yea, well, thought I’d come and take a look at the place before everyone got here. How’s it been, Hagrid?”
Harry knew he had to go, leave right this instant. Harry looked around the room, and haphazardly grabbed his bag. What else did he need? Thoughts whizzed around his brain but nothing seemed to land. The only thing he could hear pounding in his head was ‘Malfoy. Protect Malfoy’ over and over again.
“Ron, I just remembered, I don’t know if its really important but I saw someone a while back go down to the lakeside late at night - I watched them from my bedroom window, I have a view of the lake from up there, and I happened to spot someone - they were sat there for ages, not moving, until it started raining and left.” Harry paused, considering if he should tell Ron about his suspicion that its was Malfoy, but decided against it. He didn’t need telling from a second Weasley that he was probably jumping to conclusions. Ron raised an eyebrow.
“My wand, Potter. I know you have it.” Draco said this in such a quiet, low voice, it was almost a whisper. Harry looked over him. He was cloaked, but Harry couldn't tell if he was armed, he’d not seen beneath his cloak when Malfoy was knelt on the floor. But if he'd wanted to get into Harry’s room so badly, he could’ve attacked him at any point while Harry was busy healing his hand. Harry was still unsure, and now Malfoy’s hands had disappeared beneath his black cloak.
Harry looked hard at the figure. He had no lantern or light of any sort, Harry could barely see it, and if it weren't for Harry having watched it come into view, he knew he wouldn't have noticed it at all. Harry watched the figure, but it just sat on the rock, legs folded beneath them, unmoving for several minutes. It was so still, Harry wondered what on earth the figure could be doing. Meditating maybe? It was facing the Lake, an unmoving speck of black among the silvery rocks. About 10 minutes passed of the stranger staring at the Lake, and Harry staring at the stranger, before the first drops of rain started to tap on the pane of glass Harry was gazing out of. Harry glanced at the rain now coming down hard and fast on the pane, before returning his gaze to the stranger below, who suddenly got up onto its feet. Harry, who had sat back down on his bed by this point, hot chocolate and biscuits forgotten about, also got up, pressing his face once again against the glass. He watched as the cloaked figure walked back over the pebbles, and onto the lawn towards the castle, and then out of sight. Harry waited, breathing clouds against the glass, to see if the figure would return. It didn't. Harry sighed in mild frustration, but pulled himself away from the window and got into bed, the sound of the falling rain luring him into hypnotised sleep.
“You read correctly, Potter. However, his Mother insisted on him returning to Hogwarts as he is still entitled to finish his education, just as you are.”
The screaming had stopped. It was instead replaced with something horrible. The Inferi were mumbling, moaning, the screams sounding different underwater,  like they were in pain. Horrible, agonised, tortured moans. The water gave their voices new meaning. Harry felt his limbs being held, but did not fight it. He would either die like this, or his idea, as mad as it was, would work. Harry waited for the pain, the monsters to start attacking and tearing at his flesh as they did to Malfoy, but something bright made his eyes open in the water. He saw the blurred outlines of the rotting Inferi surrounding him, but also a shimmering ball of fire just out of his reach. Something started to come into focus, and he saw Malfoy swimming towards him, a halo of flames protecting him from the scaled hands reaching towards him. A hand grabbed his, and he was pulled into the flaming sphere, two arms wrapping around Harry and holding him tight. Harry breathed in Malfoy, held his head in one hand and wrapped his other arm around the boys’ shoulder. He could hear the moans of the Inferi becoming louder, confusion and pain deafening his ears, but he closed his eyes and felt the magic between the two boys working. He focused only on Malfoy, the image of him pounding in his head, letting the intensity of the feeling he'd been trying to suppress all this time free to be acknowledged by the other. He felt Malfoy’s magic reciprocating, and he'd never felt anything quite like it. It was if his whole body was on fire against the other. It was almost painful, but wonderful at the same time. It felt like a promise, a bond. A magic so magnetic, nothing could touch them. They held each other like this for a while, the sounds of the Inferi slowly ebbing away, until all Harry could hear was the roar of the flames he and Malfoy were suspended within. Harry opened his eyes carefully, squinting at the bright flames. He lifted his head from Malfoy’s shoulder and slowly turned to see the other boy looking back at him. Nose to nose they stared into each other, something invisible chaining their eyes together. Harry pushed forwards, his whole body urged him to do so, until his lips collided with Draco’s, who immediately responded. The heat intensified but Harry only felt Malfoy’s lips and how they moved perfectly, all of his senses reacting at once. He felt a hand enter his hair and felt every follicle on his body stand on end. It was like a surge of static, his muscles tightening at the sensation and he pushed further into Draco.
“Thanks.” Harry said, taking the teacup and blowing on the hot liquid.
“I think you should just do what you think is right, Neville. Stick to your instincts. There’s a reason McGonagall made you Head Boy, she trusts those instincts to make the right decision.” Harry nodded encouragingly, and felt at ease when the corner of Neville’s mouth curled into a smile and he nodded too.
“Mother!” Draco yelped, a wave of sickness rolling in his stomach.
“But… Professor, I saw what Voldemort made him do, the things he was involved in, he’s dangero-”
A crumpled figure knelt before him, head bent, obscured by a hooded cloak, with one slim arm clutching the other in what looked like an agonised embrace. As Harry's wand light illuminated the figure its head slowly raised up to make grievous eye contact with Harry. Harry blanched.
“Oh right yea, Merry Christmas. yea I suppose I will be heading home then, can’t believe its come round so fast.”
Malfoy’s flush drained from his face immediately, and his eyes widened. He sat up and looked at Harry. A few moments of silence passed and Harry decided to take that as confirmation of his suspicions. He felt like an explanation was probably necessary.
“On my mother’s life.”
“I hoped you might pay me a visit Potter. Please, take a seat. There are biscuits in that tin there, please help yourself.” Harry glanced once more over his shoulder at the portrait of Dumbledore, who was now snoozing, or at least pretending to, in his painted chair, before stepping forward and taking the seat opposite McGonagall. He picked up his tea, which has just finished adding milk to itself, just to Harry's liking, and a custard cream from the biscuit tin.
“Where you going-”
“You think you can help everyone don’t you? You think you can just go around, saving people, winning wars and avenging the dead?” Malfoy looked furious. His hands were in fists at his side, his shoulders tensed.
Turning back into the room, Harry noticed Kreacher busying himself, fussing with bedsheets and pretending to be hard at work. Harry rolled his eyes.
“Why am I alive?” Harry blinked, and turned around. Malfoy stiffly pulled himself onto one elbow and looked seriously at Harry. Harry didn't know what to say.
“It is if people's lives are in danger.” Harry said, biting his lip after saying the words. He had no evidence that whatever Malfoy was up to could be dangerous, but he had more than a small suspicion that, knowing Malfoy, it was definitely a possibility. Malfoy was still, his fists at his side, and he stared at Harry, eyes darting between his own. His lips were parted, the bottom quivering slightly, the look of anger melting into fear. Harry swallowed and felt himself go slightly colder.
“Harry, you realise he's just about to go on trial. The whole ‘stolen wand’ drama probably scared him straight, he probably just doesn't want to ruffle any more feathers or he’ll end up rotting in Azkaban for as long as his father is.” Ginny looked at him with eyebrows raised, and then looked back at her parchment and carried on scribbling out an essay. Harry considered her words. It made sense that Draco wouldn't want to cause any more trouble, but he seemed more distracted than just ‘trying to behave.’ He was totally unavailable, like his attention was focussed elsewhere entirely. Harry thought about earlier that day when he tried getting Malfoy to pay attention to him by ‘accidently’ launching a potted fig plant across the greenhouse, making it explode loudly against a table, grabbing everyone's attention except the one boy he wanted it from. Malfoy didn't even bat an eyelid, and Harry lost 10 points for Gryffindor. He hadn't mentioned to Ginny about seeing the figure at the Lake, but that was such a stretch he thought she might find it strange that he was making such conclusions after only seeing the figure one time, and hearing Malfoy go into his room many hours afterwards. Even Harry considered it a bit far-fetched, but something told him he was right in believing that the cloaked figure was Malfoy.
“Of course it is.” Harry grinned.
“You were watching me from your bedroom every night like some personal lifeguard?” Draco scoffed again and shook his head, disbelief painting his features.
“I always hated this statue. When I was forced to come back here it felt like it was mocking me, making them separate for you to walk through. It was like it was trying to show me just how much my actions and my involvement with the Death Eaters had torn people's lives apart, for me to walk forward. And then, once you're out of the picture, they come back together, happy again at last, now that the bad guy is out of the way.” Harry looked at Malfoy, and then, not being able to help himself, threw his arms around him, sending the blonde stumbling backwards.
“And why on earth would I give it to you? What do you need it for?” Harry said, shifting his weight onto his back foot, both hands now deep in his pyjama bottoms, the waistband slipping a little further down his hips. He could see Draco eyeing them, and a pleased little twist erupted within him, knowing he was starting to irritate the other boy.
“Shit!” Harry hissed. Trickles of crimson blood oozed out of his index finger and thumb as he touched the edge of the paper, dripping red circles onto its surface. Harry’s heart hammered once again. It was Malfoy’s self invented charm. He looked down at the paper eagerly and saw writing emerge onto it in an elegant black script. Harry laughed humourlessly as he realised Draco had also charmed it so that only blood could reveal the message. That was some dark magic.
“Yes, of course,” Dumbledore nodded. “Which reminds me, I never did give you a congratulations over your nuptials, though I wish that it was under better circumstances.”
“So uhh what happens, because of this thing?” Dean asked carefully.
It was almost midnight and Voldemort was still up in his personal study in his manor. His thoughts kept running around the Weasley situation and how he should deal with Mrs. Weasley’s actions against his son.
Next to him, Ron cheered and grinned at Draco before continuing to pull him towards the group, “Harry—hey Harry,” he said, letting go of Draco’s arm to high-five Harry. Draco couldn’t help but just stare at Harry, who now because he was standing correctly his chest looked even bigger.
“Of course, I wasn’t even planning of seeing the old fool,” Niall nodded. “Come on, we should probably go before our new friends think we’re into incest. Lord knows that would make Ron blow his lid.”
“We had no visitors,” Blaise said, “I did not even smell my father inside the house, we were able to have a peaceful night of sleep.”
Blaise chuckled, “Now, how can I say no to two sexy mages like this?”
“Precisely Harry, as well as how our relationship will develop from here since, well as I said last night boys, we’re stuck together,” Blaise said, giving the two boys a soft smile.
Harry nodded, “Actually yes,” he said. “I saw the Dark Lord, I saw the Devil… a couple times actually.”
Harry looked dejected and sighed, “Didn’t mean to,” he muttered. “Why aren’t I dead?”
“I will also need more fitting robes, obviously my school robes will not do at all,” Harry jested, pointing to his Gryffindor crest.
“When Draco’s going to collar you?” Crabbe demanded. Harry stared at the bully, slack jawed. He looked at the two of them, “When are you two going to apologize to me for five years of bullying?” he asked, crossing his arms. The two stared at each other for a moment. “Sorry,” the grunted.
“Oh?” Ron looked at Draco amused, “Well now I have to see this! Please tell me Daph looks embarrassing, I need something on her!”
That night was the first night Harry dreamed. It was wonderful needy dream. He and Draco were alone, naked. Draco was inside him, moving quickly as both husbands were lost in a moment of pure lust. Harry begged for more, pleading the Malfoy to fill him, and just before both boys reached their climax—Harry woke up.
“Parkinson, ignore her, she’s just an ugly mutt,” Draco muttered. He touched Harry’s shoulder and muttered, “It’s okay Harry, you’re a beautiful boy. They’re just jealous.”
“Either way I’m sure he’ll be here soon enough,” Lupin said, “Let’s not worry yet.”
“Yeah… I do,” Harry said, but there was some uncertainty in it. Cedric didn’t notice it, instead giving him an honest smile as he stood up and opened the door.
“It can be a very dangerous spell if used wrongly,” Harry said, looking up at the members of the Wizengamot. He did his best to avoid Minister Scrimgeour who he was quickly growing to dislike. It was created for common tasks such as cutting cloth and hair, as you said Madam Bones, I even saw Mrs. Weasley use it once to cut up a really stubborn potato. However, the spell was to cut, it’s incantation is
Niall stopped and turned swiftly to them. “You do not get to think like this,” he said harshly. “Neither of you understands the things that Harry and I had to go through—had to live through! For
Harry put out his tongue. …He tasted the man’s scent on the air. …He was alive but drowsing …sitting in front of a door at the end of the corridor…
They smashed together in a fiery kiss, their cocks pushing against each other. They moaned in the kiss, Harry thrusting up to meet with his Alpha as he turned his head to the side, bearing his neck. Draco licked and kissed his way down Harry’s neck, staying in one place and biting it, causing his sweet boywife to mewl highly. He needed Draco to mark him. To bite him over and over until he was covered by his marks, by his scent. Draco bit down harder and Harry moaned, his cock throbbing against Draco’s, pre-cum leaking out. Draco moved away, licking his neck and smirking at the large red bite mark that will bruise. “You want more, Omega, don’t you?” Draco growled.
“Of course,” Uncle Remus said. Harry made his way slowly out of the room. The heaviness lifted, and the relaxed feeling of normality settled on the house as life moved on.
“No! That’s horrible—”
“And I feel for your plight, truly,” Niall said, “but I am not that teacher. You all may believe that I’m like the Boy Who Lived or whatever they call me—but I never cared for any of that. I’m Niall Potter first and foremost. My biggest priority is none of you but looking after my younger brother. And followed directly behind is now my Omega, who we just had an amazing first date so please don’t ruin my mood from that.” He sighed and stretched in the chair before standing up. “Look, I’m sure the Umbridge problem will solve itself. My brother is stubborn, and we’ll either get rid of her his way or mine, so it’s not really that much of a terrible problem.”
“Oh god no,” Niall groaned, and Harry’s smile grew. He gave his brother one last hug and Harry said, “I’ll see you in class.”
“Okay, ma’am,” Harry nodded. Down the corridor, they went and turned a corner where a door waited at the end. Madam Pomfrey opened the door for Harry, and they walked in. “I hope you have memorized the path, Mr. Riddle,” she said. “Here is where you’ll be spending your heat.”
Remus Lupin was desperate. His Alpha, his mate Sirius Black was in Azkaban for a crime he has not committed. He knew that Peter Pettigrew was the Potters’ Secret Keeper. They all knew. Dumbledore and himself argued with James over that matter, saying that Sirius would be safer. He was stronger. And it hurt Remus to know that he was right. The rat they thought was their friend betrayed them, his friends were gone, his godchildren sent to live with those horrible muggles instead of with him, and his love sent away without a trial. For four years, Remus tried everything he could think of. He went to Dumbledore first, yelling at the man and demanding that the twins be placed under his custody. “They are my godchildren damn it! Lily and James wanted them to be with me and Sirius! It was in their wills Dumbledore!”
“I don’t know… I never done that before,” Harry said. He looked around, wincing at his head. “He told me… that one day I could control the shadow-walkers, make them do my bidding more than just passing notes.” Harry had a thoughtful expression while the others looked around confused, Theo mouthing ‘shadow-walkers’ questionably. Harry shook his head, “I’ll be alright I think, just tired,” he yawned.
His body felt smooth, powerful, and flexible. He was gliding between shining metal bars, across dark, cold stone… He was flat against the floor, sliding along on his belly. …It was dark, yet he could see objects around him shimmering in strange, vibrant colors. …he was turning his head. …At first glance, the corridor was empty … but no… a man was sitting on the floor ahead, his chin drooping onto his chest, his outline gleaming in the dark. …
“Niall!” Harry whimpered. “What are we going to do?”
“Yup,” Draco smirked. “Was starting to turn into a lizard but I forced it to drink a potion of my own creation. I always wanted a dragon to be my familiar, to match my name, you know, and now I have Typhon. He’ll won’t be the actual size of a dragon of course, but he still has all the powers of a regular familiar… it’s just that he can breathe fire in this form. No wings, however. That’s a pity.”
The next morning, the Church held an emergency meeting. Harry found himself sitting with his Uncles and Blaise in the front pew with the Malfoys while Mr. Riddle addressed them all. “On yesterday, a day that was supposed to be a celebration, the day of Samhain and celebrating all that Lord Lucifer has given us, we instead found ourselves in the grip of a horror, a monster, a creature of malice intend that comes from neither heaven nor hell. We had one fatality from this attack, Ms. Warrington, who was a good woman, a devout follower, and a loyal member of our community, who never missed a mass in her sixty-seven years. Today we honor her memory, and rejoice for today she has entered Lord Satan’s eternal Paradise in hell…”
“How ironic since that is our next date,” Draco chuckled. He hooked his arm around Harry’s waist and Harry held onto his side. The two walked towards the couple, and Draco said in a loud, authoritative voice, “Blaise! You really should treat your submissive with more respect.”
“Don’t call me Nymphadora, Remus,” the young witch said with a shudder, “it’s Tonks.”
“What do you mean?” Niall asked. He was still holding his younger brother as they eyed the two men in front of them.
“You two barely known each other,” Kingsley explained calmly, “it would have been better for him to move on if he had forgotten any source or connection to magic, and that included you as well. For all he knew, he was just attacked by a random wolf.”
He stood up and pocketed his wand, he’ll allow the spells’ effect to wear off naturally. As he turned to leave, he could have sworn he saw red, but when he looked again, he could only see the usual nighttime darkness. Shrugging, he left Goyle where he was and left the dormitory, ignoring Daphne and Pansy, and sat down next to Blaise. “Where’s Theo?” he asked casually.
“I’m expecting that, Potter,” Draco smirked. He kissed Harry once more and took his hand, pulling Harry out of the classroom. The hallway was empty, and they made their way down towards the nearest stairway. They talked about anything and everything, Draco hinting about any and every dirty thing he planned on doing with Harry that night, while Harry proved himself to be just as lewd. They left the secret stairwell and walked the short corridor towards the Great Hall.
“Uncle Sirius…” he said apprehensively, still staring at his mark.
Uncle Sirius stared at the Malfoys and said in a snappish tone, “If you have things to say or want to here this at least sit down!”
“Yes ma’am,” Harry nodded, his cheeks starting to feel a little warm.
“That is fine, Draco has brooms you can borrow,” Mrs. Malfoy said, “His Nimbus 2001, for instance.”
“Quite a few people—”
“Well you tried too hard,” Draco muttered. Harry nodded in agreement. “Yeah… just let it go naturally,” he said. “You’re a hundred and sixteen years old, you should know how to let a relationship develop naturally by now.”
“Bendable, are we Potter?” Connor chuckled. “That school of yours must really be good for you if they’re teaching you how to be nice and stretched out.” He took off his shirt, revealing a perfect set of pecs and abs. “Come on boy, I don’t wanna be the only one naked today.”
Harry nodded. “Your sorting involves looking into a child’s head for their strongest qualities rather than testing them. In essence, you are saying with your bias that the qualities that Slytherin prefers are wrong and automatically evil. Is that right?”
Niall got up and stood to the side, barely opening a blind to peek through. He sighed, “Students,” he muttered.
“I think we should switch it to a weekly thing,” Draco suggested, “instead of switching nightly. It might be easier on everyone involved.”
“Right! But we should keep it secret—for now at least,” Harry said. “If things look bad, really bad, then we use it.”
“You don’t tell me what to do!” Draco growled out. He breathed deeply, and his eyes shifted towards Ron, “Fine,” he said stubbornly. “Sorry.”
Harry nodded. “Not good things,” he frowned. “Selfishness and unrequited love.”
“Faked, obviously,” Voldemort began. “Your birthday is not even at the end of July; it is in the middle. July 16
Instead, the Minister nodded, “We have,” he said, “when it is needed.”
Harry pouted, “I don’t need a babysitter!”
“It’s all innocent questions, isn’t that right George?” Fred said.
will leave the Gryffindors alone. Or else. I am not afraid of killing any of you in front of everybody.”
Lord Voldemort stood in front of his son and Draco Malfoy. His handsome, older face scowling with a silent fury, a deadly aura surrounding him as his dark eyes glared at Harry and Draco. Harry and Draco stared up at him with fear, and he tightened his grip on Harry’s throat before dropping him unceremoniously onto the floor. A book fell from out of Harry’s hand, but Voldemort did not look at it. “It is kind of you to finally show yourself, Harry, Draco,” he said, his voice seeping with an icy venom.
“And it’s what got me drawn to you Harry,” Draco said, “believe it or not you have something similar to that. People are drawn to you Harry, for better or worse. I have for years.”
Flowers for Alpha
“Don’t push your luck, Ron,” Niall sighed. “But hey, did you read about Puddlemere United’s reserve team? I saw a picture about their reserve Keeper, Oliver Wood I think his name is, he’s rather hot.”
He retraced his steps to the marble staircase and descended them until he was back in the entrance hall. Then he turned and went further down into the cold dungeons that made Harry a little homesick for Durmstrang. The dungeons were a little confusing, but he somehow found his way back to the classroom where they had potions. It was, expectantly, empty, so Harry had to wander around the dungeon, knocking on doors and peeking into empty classrooms. Until, at the end of the hall, he heard a soft voice say, “Enter.”
“Like how the Ministry is interfering at Hogwarts,” Hermione said.
“Then can you listen to a mother’s suggestion?” Mrs. Malfoy asked. Harry nodded.
“Wizards,” Niall whispered. He looked at his brother and smiled, “Right, then we should like learn spells! Get another stick I want to set it on fire! We can use this to protect ourselves.”
“Alpha,” Harry whined as their eyes met.
“Sod off Draco,” Ron muttered softly.
“Nah, I love your pussy too much for that,” Draco chuckled. Harry laughed and held onto Draco. The two walked around the store for a bit, eventually buying a butt plug. They returned to the entrance area and Harry knelt on the leather pads while Draco stood in front of him. Draco slipped his ring back on and held onto Harry. The world shifted around them once more, and they were back in Hogsmeade behind Honeydukes.
“Well… we have Harry, yeah, but we always wanted a child of our own Sirius, and we’re not getting any younger, are we?” Remus asked. “I was just going to suggest that—”
“What—no!” Draco yelled. Fenrir chuckled and stepped towards Draco. Draco stepped away, only to be hurt by a Cruciatus Curse from Voldemort. His screams filled the room as Greyback closed in on him.
“That would never happen,” Draco said immediately, “I don’t want that girl near my Harry!”
“Yes, I am, and you’re Harry Potter,” Greengrass said, rolling her eyes. “Again, why is he here?”
Blaise gave him a deep glare and said, “I’ll have you know Malfoy that I wear my straps for a reason. I produce heat naturally, I’m the damn Lord of Hellfire I’ll let you know, so the less clothes I wear, the easier it is for me to breath. This button-down shirt and slacks… along with this damnable vest—it’s suffocating!”
“You’ve called my son by the wrong surname. Harrison’s full name is Harrison Salazar Riddle. You have called him by his wrong name, Harry James Potter,” Mr. Riddle explained smoothly. “There is also the further titling of my son as ‘the Chosen One.’ I have made it quite clear in my initial charging as well as with follow-up documentation that the prophecy that labels my son as such is fictitious.”
“And Malfoy in yours?” Niall asked.
“Thank you, sir,” Draco said softly. Mr. Riddle nodded before turning to Blaise.
October 18
He waited for any reaction only to be met with silence. Pansy Parkinson stepped forward, her face looking smug as she laughed, “Yeah right! You’re just a liar, Potter!”
“Of course you’re a moody one,” the Alpha to his left, what was it that Blaise called him, Draco, said.
Alone in his office, Dumbledore worried about what he saw. It was a glimpse, barely a second long, however, what he saw scared the old man. It was a face he thought he would never see again, a face he thought was fully corrupted by Dark Magic. “How can it be?” he muttered to himself. He watched Harry all day, worried about what he should do. He cannot move openly against the boy, no, he needs more information. But still, if it was true, if the boy knows about his true lineage, then Dumbledore must act! But he couldn’t bring himself to. He was too worried, too scared of that single second, of that handsome face he saw that is filled with much evil and power. If people knew that he had a hand in creating that insanity… “All I can do now is watch,” he muttered gravely. “Watch and hoped that I am wrong.”
“I understand, don’t worry.”
“Later, when I find the right collar,” Draco shrugged. He smirked at Harry and petted his hair, “You’re going to love it.’
“Hermione’s books—anyway,” Harry continued, never looking at Dumbledore. “That is the spell. To split open. It does not mention cloth or hair or potatoes, the target that is being severed or cut is the caster’s target. So it would then be, I would argue, the caster’s intention that makes this spell dangerous or not, and not the spell itself. Though I am sure that it cannot lob a head off of someone’s shoulders, it can give a person cuts, I would imagine.”
“Fine, whatever,” Niall shrugged. “I’ll talk with you guys later.” He waved the others away and followed Draco.
“Uhh right,” Harry said, nodding dimly.
Voldemort frowned at that, looking visibly dejected.
Dumbledore’s hands made a small bang on the table, getting their attention. His face drained as he stared at Harry. “Harry, repeat that, please,” Dumbledore said. Harry stared at him, he could have sworn that he heard fear in the old wizard’s voice.
“I’m a Malfoy, money is no problem,” Draco said.
Harry snatched the Blood-Replenishing potion from his father’s hand and pulled the cork off, swallowing the thick disgusting potion in one go, his brain dizzy and woozy from the loss of blood. With it empty, Harry collapsed onto a wooden chair as Voldemort busied himself with the potion.
Harry laughed and bit his bottom lip. “Well, I don’t know about now, but I think the baby conversation might be a possibility between Draco and I after we graduate Hogwarts. We just have too many things to worry about now.”
“Then why did he attack Professor Umbridge?” Hermione asked. “I know that he is your brother, but, you’re in different Houses. Normally that isn’t a problem but, you’re in Gryffindor while he is in Slytherin. Two completely different Houses. Haven’t you thought that maybe there’s a reason for that? That maybe there is something underneath him, something that he is hiding from everyone, even from you?”
Harry coughed, eyes stinging as he stumbled out of his fireplace into Grimmauld Place. He’d used too much floo powder in his haste to get home and now his eyes were watering, blinding him from the excess smoke the floo had produced, along with the horrible sensation of taking the floo network, which he never had really got used to.
“YOU DID IT!” Harry bellowed, and grabbed Malfoy’s wand arm, thrusting the wand into his hand once more. The magic exploded between them like an electric shock, and Malfoy’s eyes opened, looking at the wand, then up at Harry. He searched his face for a moment, before throwing himself into Harry and kissing him, knocking Harry backwards onto the shore. Harry pulled Malfoy closer and felt the heat between them warm his whole body, deepening the kiss as if it was all that mattered in the world. Everything he wanted to say, he said in this kiss. He felt Malfoy’s breath tracing his features, their bodies fitting perfectly together despite the cold damp clothes separating their skin which Harry longed to be removed. Malfoy pulled back, his pupils blown, a look of pure relief on his pointed features.
Harry appeared at the top of the high street, head spinning. He blinked, and looked around him. The street was nearly deserted, A thin layer of frost coated the buildings and floor around him. He looked up towards the castle, and saw a tiny figure disappear behind the crest of the hill. He hitched his backpack higher over his shoulders and broke out into a run up towards the castle, hot breaths escaping his lips in clouds of pale white as he ran, the cobblestones echoing his loud footfalls. The wind lifted his long hair, and the cold air burned his throat as he made up the steep hill. As he neared the top he looked down into the grounds and saw the edge of the huge shimmering lake below. He stopped, doubled over panting, and squinted down to find the other boy. His eyes burned with the cold and watered slightly, blurring his vision. Harry rubbed his eyes, squinting, but he saw nothing. Harry remembered the boulder he could see from his window, and knew it was out of sight, a bit further across from what of the lake he could currently see. Deciding that this was likely his best shot at finding him, he jogged down the steep path towards the shore, slipping a few times on the loose gravel. Harry made it to the edge of the lake, and began to run along the shoreline, the huge castle above him casting a shadow over the shore. Harry could hear only the sound of his feet against the stony shoreline and his own desperate breaths as he ran. The lake was deathly still, unsettlingly so. Finally, after what seemed like a marathon, Harry looked up at the castle and saw the tower his room was situated in, and followed the line of sight from his window down, until he saw the boulder. Harry’s eyes widened when he saw the figure wading into the lake. Oh god, what was he doing? Harry swallowed and sprinted towards him, the burning sensation in his throat nearly unbearable. He skidded to a stop on the pebbles when he reached the boulder, which was strewn with expensive clothing. Harry looked out into the lake and saw the blonde head and naked, pale torso he’d seen so many times from his bedroom. Harry didn't know what to do. If he called out to Draco, it could end in a duel, but if he did nothing… Harry decided to squat down beside the boulder to recover his breath and watch Draco, see exactly what he would do now that he had a wand.
“That’s why I tried to sneak a wand in. I needed it to perform the summoning spell. That’s what you saw me doing now. The Inferi have been awakened. They were supposed to kill me, Potter. Merlin knows what is about to happen now that I’m still alive.” Malfoy became quiet, and Harry took a moment to process what he'd heard. His skin crawled slightly as he realised the implication of Malfoy saying the Inferi had been awakened. He was reminded of the mission he took with Dumbledore, at how those bodies did not relent, how they only just made it out alive. This lake was about 50 times larger than that one, and filled with a lot more life. But then Harry looked at Malfoy, and remembered that he’d caught his wand when Harry threw it to him, he had fought them off.
“Sorry Hermione I just… I’m struggling at the moment. I think I need to be alone. Sorry.” Harry got up from the table and strode out of The Great Hall, without looking back at Hermione. She would never relate to how he was feeling. Harry thought the war might have just broken him. Why did he need some sort of conflict To feel normal? He frowned as he considered the illogical nature of it all. A pit of something churned in his stomach, uncomfortably.
“I thought I heard something down here. You, I suppose.” the way Malfoy spoke was gentle. Harry looked, confused as the blonde stepped down from the archway and approached the dinner table. Harry just stared at him, but Draco had broken their eye contact to look down at the table's offerings. He surveyed the food, and reached for the chicken bone Harry had flung across the table. He picked it up between a slender forefinger and thumb and examined it, turning it in the candle light to examine its bumps and lines, before placing it back on the table, brow creasing, Hooded eyes downcast in introspection.
“Has his behaviour been satisfactory Headmistress?” The taller of the two inquired, a bald, lined wizard, that Harry found slightly terrifying.
Harry lifted his cup and blew on the black liquid, steam clouding his glasses, before a deafening SCREECH made his whole body lurch, spilling scorching coffee into his crotch. As he stood up, searing pain flashing over him, something large and feathered collided with him, sending the coffee cup flying, smashing against the wall, and Harry stumbling, only just managing to grip the kitchen counter rather than fall flat on his arse.
After looking in each other's rooms and admiring the views out of their respective windows, Harry’s being the only one with a Lake view, eliciting many murmurs of envy from the others, the boys went back downstairs to join the girls in pursuit of snooping around their tower. Harry, who was now exhausted, told them to go on without him. He lingered on the small landing for a moment, feeling happier than he had been in months. As he turned to re-enter his own room, he glanced at the door of the one room they had not entered. Upon it, the golden initials “D.M” glimmered in the candle light. Harry paused, hand tingling on his own door handle, the thought of having to share a dormitory with Draco Malfoy lingering in his mind. His absence at the feast raised curiosity within Harry, but he quickly rid himself of the thought, and reminded himself that this year, he'd promised McGonagall that all would be well, no more fighting, no more rivalry, which also included no more being suspicious of Draco Malfoy. He pushed his way into his room and the solid door clicked shut behind him, marking the end of his first day of his final year at Hogwarts.
“Wake up. Draco wake up.” Harry spoke, gentle but desperate. Everything around him was silent. Not even a breeze. Harry leaned over Draco and felt hopeless. He pressed his forehead against his chest and felt a sob escape his lips. The sobs came as freely and as painful as he'd ever felt. He was sure this would work. Harry lifted his head and a thought crossed his mind, and a small flame of hope relit itself in his chest. Malfoy had sacrificed himself, yes, but Harry was still alive.
A few days went by, and Harry’s life suddenly became much less interesting. There were no insults, no jinxed parchment, no tripping hexes or brawls in the corridor. Harry hadn’t seen the blonde since the courtyard incident, and although a part of him was relieved to not have to see his stupid sneer all the time, another part of him was getting restless. This year had been strange, having had come back to Hogwarts after the war and everyone treating him like some kind of hero. It was uncomfortable. But fighting with Draco was normal, grounding, and helped Harry get out the emotions that he just couldn't articulate in any other way than fighting. And now that he’d lost the only thing that was letting him feel normal, he was more pent up and frustrated than ever.
“Of course Harry!” Draco declared. He took a step away from Harry and gave the younger boy a victorious smirk. Opening his jacket, Draco pulled out his familiar, “Harry, my boyfriend, meet my familiar, Typhon.” The familiar was surprisingly small, about the size of Draco’s arm, the familiar had skinny body with emerald green scales, four legs an a long neck that led to a flat wide face with fangs bearing out of the mouth. His tail was long and ended at a point. It took Harry only a second to gasp and stare at the familiar. “Is that a dragon?” he asked.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, hugging his uncles.
Draco chuckled, “Only if you don’t know the right spells.” He took out his wand and pressed the tip against Harry’s tight hole. He bent forward, his body pressed against Harry’s and whispered a spell in Harry’s ear. Harry gasped, his butt felt wet for one second before becoming dry and slightly loose. “That was a cleaning spell Harry,” Draco whispered, “and this spell will make you wet like a girl. Theo taught me this.” He whispered another spell.
“Shut up you old hag,” Lestrange said. “Just you watch, I will become our Lord’s favorite in one move with this.” She motioned towards the writing. Lilith took a moment to read it all before rolling her eyes.
“Oh,” Harry said awkwardly, looking between the two. “Um… sorry.”

“But that is ancient!” Mrs. Weasley said, “Nobody even thinks of using that anymore! Where did you even learn about that?”
“That’s good,” Sirius said. “It’s important to keep up on your studies Harry, but that shouldn’t mean you can’t have some fun too. The Academy has many clubs and sports teams. You should consider joining one.”
An Attempt at Normalcy
“Yes, sir,” Harry nodded.
“A week! No,” Harry said. “Just please think about it, think about how Dumbledore treated me, how every year I had this immeasurable expectation on my shoulders and hell even how he handled this! The Ministry running with me being a Ruined Omega! For all we know he was the one who leaked it. How can Mrs. Weasley know to poison my food? How can the same poison be in my food and only my food? It makes no sense at all. It can only be Dumbledore.”
“And we’ll win, right?” Harry said. “They can’t tear us away from Durmstrang, from Viktor.”
“I always knew I would give my virginity to you,” Draco nodded, he smiled and turned to face Harry. “You’re too annoying in my life to not have a significant effect.”
“No, no! I didn’t,” Ron said.
“Wait,” Ron interrupted, his eyes going wide, “you don’t mean that your—”
“By Satan what have you humans been teaching each other the last century or two?” Blaise sighed. “Know what? I’ll sweeten our deal even more. I will personally teach the two of you everything that I know. No need to refuse sweeties, because I know that what I’ll teach you two will be very useful… but before that, my dear sweet Harry Potter, let’s go introduce me to your Uncles. I’m sure they’re going to be thrilled at our new relationship.”
He tried pulling up his sleeve again but couldn’t. He refused to look up, he didn’t want to see their faces. Faces full of disgust and pity, he assumed. Hatred and empathy, he didn’t want any of it. His eyes wet with tears. He continued talking, “I had to go under Voldemort’s wing… because I wanted Draco… I wanted to save Cedric. He killed Wormtail… and marked me.” Finally, slowly, with an agonizing pain that burned his hand and heart, he pulled his iron heavy sleeve. Inch by inch, his Dark Mark revealed itself, burning black against his skin. There were gasps, he could hear Moody growling to himself while Mrs. Weasley muttered.
“I love you too, Remus,” Voldemort said before kissing him once more. The two parted and went to their bedroom for Voldemort to get his traveling cloak and receipts. They walked out together and gave each other one last kiss before apparating, Remus going to visit Mrs. Weasley while Voldemort visits the Malfoys.
Harry nodded and watched his brother go to the cheering table. The girl and redhead from earlier immediately moved to make room for Niall, and he sat down, looking stony face. “Harry Potter.”
“Excuse me?” Harry said.
“Well, Parkinson fancies Draco, and I thought she was going to try and tear my sister apart to get him! But now instead she gets to tear you apart instead, or you tear her apart, either way, happy ending for my sister,” Greengrass smiled.
“Well woo hoo,” Draco drawled, “We are both queer, if that is all you wanted to talk about, I am leaving.”
“I’m not a—”
Harry thought. He left the fishnets alone and looked to the top that he will be wearing. The top was a dress shirt, like the boys all wear, however it was cut short near the bottom. Harry guessed that when he wore it, he would be showing his midriff. The shirt was tighter than the boys, and felt heavier, as though it was leather somehow mocking a cotton. The usual mark was over his heart, however there was no sword. The arms of the shirt extended down into solid parts that led to a ring on each side. “The ring goes on your middle fingers, Harry,” Mr. Riddle explained, “it is what holds the shirt up.”
and give them to first years!” Madam Pomfrey fussed, looking extremely ignored. “So in you go, Riddle. I will be back to check on you after your heat is over. And try not to stain the bedding.”
I want this gone,” Harry said, looking down at his mark. “No longer how much I scrub it won’t move.”
you can treat me like this after what you’ve done!”
The man jumped, whimpering slightly, “So sorry, Alpha,” the man said. Voldemort smirked, “Then get to work,” he commanded.
“Would she be the type to do anything the old man asks her unquestioning?” Voldemort asked.
“Yes.”
?” he asked, glancing back at Lestrange. “They all look deathly ill. Surely you will not punish me for natural causes?”
“Of course, Professor, that was why I’ve made them,” Harry said easily. “Good day.”
Blaise was unusually silent as they left Mr. Riddle’s classroom. Harry and Draco were walking on either side, concerned. When they’ve reached the main hall where the statue of Blaise’s father stood, Harry asked, “What do you mean Blaise, when you said Mrs. Lestrange smelt funny?”
“So what? This when you kill me or something?” Draco asked, a cocky look on his face.
“Riddle,” Harry nodded. “Terry, can you come with me for a second? Ron has something he wants to ask you.” He smiled at the other Omega. Boot glanced at his friends before shrugging, standing up. “What’s up?” he asked as the two took the few steps towards where Ron was standing.
“Ten points from Gryffindor,” Umbridge said, “And for the record Mr. Potter, we are not in that savage school, we are in Hogwarts! Where we live and learn in a just and orderly civilization.”
“Maybe,” Niall smirked, “Sexy thing named Neville Longbottom. The boy is filled out in all the right places.”
“Yes but just think of the children the two of you would have,” Mr. Krum insisted. “He talks only of you and Niall, and quite honestly I rather you than this new girl poor Viktor is talking about.”
“But…but,” Harry tried to articulate his confusion, his doubts and worries, his lostness. “I don’t know who I am,” he said slowly.
“Three days of this,” he panted. “Come, love, two more times before I feed you.” They kissed and embraced each other, Remus muttering words of love.
Harry frowned.
Nagini hissed.
“Both of you are acting so damn childish it’s actually amazing and really annoying at the same time! So take your egos, stuff them where the sun don’t shine and make up!” Harry screamed. His chest was huffing when he was done, his eyes darting between Draco and Blaise.
“Maybe,” Harry said, feeling downer than when he woke up.
“Can’t!”
So yeah we going down the Voldemort/Remus route. Also next chapter I get to add a tag I'm REALLY excited about.
There was more skittering, more soft noises, like an icy breeze lofting into the room. Were they talking, Harry wondered before one by one, red eyes appeared. They stared at Harry and Draco, unblinking and unwavering. Harry looked up at Draco, who stared at the red eyes. For a moment, Harry thought Draco was afraid before the teen smirked. “You will listen to me,” he said, “just as my sweet boy has told you. You’ve whispered that spell in my ear, I want to learn more. But for now, get rid of these disgusting baubles that plague this room.” Clear sounds of movement filled the room and Draco looked down at Harry, satisfied. “As for my boy,” he said. He unbuttoned his pants and pulled out his hardening cock. “Suck.”
“Yeah, don’t you think it’s rude for an Alpha to not kiss the Omega he’s dating?” Lavender asked.
“And what’s wrong with that?” Harry asked.
“We knocked her out, dressed her in some noble’s clothes and toasted as we watched her head rolled from the guillotine,” Bellatrix laughed, smiling openly, “It was much easier than, you know.”
“Okay Daphne… I was honestly not expecting this,” Harry said.
“It was! The beds here are so much more comfortable than Durmstrang’s,” Harry grinned. “I had to steal blankets and pillows from the others there. They were mad and went to Professor Karkaroff about it, but he laughed telling them that if an Omega can successfully steal their pillows then they didn’t protect their beds properly enough.”
Hermione was silent for too long a moment for Harry’s liking. It was not until the doors opened and Professor McGonagall led the first years in that she gave in and gave Harry a soft nod. Harry smiled and relaxed, feeling a weight falling off of his shoulders as he turned to focus on the sorting.
“I know, but it is not your fault Harry,” Blaise said. “Come on, I’ll help you with your meditation.”
“We talked about him as well,” Remus said gravely. “In the end, both Sirius and I agreed that watching over both of you, and especially teaching you, is much greater than any threat Dumbledore might do. But just in case, we have an appointment to talk to him, all three of us, actually.”
“When,” Draco paused before asking cautiously, “when was it?”
“Sounds like he can’t,” Draco commented. He leaned back and gave a soft frown, “To be honest, we haven’t planned that far ahead. It was Blaise who suggested to bring this old god in. Harry and I thought up on tricking the devil using his own laws of marriage. Specifically, that which says ‘a man’s spouse can neither be coveted nor taken by any other.’ It is targeted at humans, yes, but since Blaise is a demon, and we are both marrying him, it should refer to demons and the like as well.”
“Well they are dating, and it is very serious,” Theo shrugged.
“I uh need to talk with you,” Ron said, glancing at the first years, “alone.”
“Oh god!” Draco groaned. How was he supposed to face him now? Hell, how was he supposed to face anyone?
“Muscles maybe?” Theo suggested, “What do you think Draco? Would you think Harry would look good with a nice big butt and thick muscled chest?” Draco blushed for a moment.
Harry sighed, “I guess that’s what he did as well,” he muttered. “Viktor always cast a spell on me during my heat, but it was nonverbal, so I never questioned it.”
“I don’t agree to your ideology…” Harry said.
“Oh no reason,” Harry hummed.
“You can’t—”
“Good, old magic still flows through it,” Lord Voldemort said. “Now, Harry, I am sure you have questions regarding this ceremony? And I would like to know how you’ve met Draco Malfoy.”
“And now… we address the followers, come my son,” Lord Voldemort said. Harry nodded and followed his lord out of the room.
With his purchases in hand, and because he did not want to deal with seeing people nor being seen, Draco walked further down Knockturn Alley where the lights started to fade, and long, dark shadows took over. Draco stopped in the darkest corner he could find and waited until he saw the red eyes. “Bring me to Hogwarts, seventh floor,” he commanded, and walked into the embrace of the shadow creatures. Not afraid of them, Draco added, “Do not tell the Dark Lord about this. If you do, I will bring in the brightest fire I can find and burn you all.” His threat echoed in the shadows, and Draco couldn’t help but notice that the red eyes quivered slightly as he walked.
“Killing a demon, and killing me are two different things, Bella,” the figure said with a feminine voice. She sat down across of Lestrange. She was a very beautiful woman, with short black hair, dark eyes, and a light skin inhumanly flawless. She looked seductive, attractive, yet her eyes were old, very old, as though they have looked upon many a millennium.
Smiling, Harry nodded enthusiastically, calmer and more energetic than he has been for a long time. He felt like himself as he and Sirius made their way, looking for the most clean and cheery looking room in this dread, dreary house. “Well I have a boyfriend,” Harry began. “We’ve been dating since September but we knew each other for years, it’s going very smoothly now.”
“No… at least I don’t think so,” Harry frowned. “But wouldn’t you agree that in the long run it’ll be safer for us… for our family if we leave him?”
“I’m just trying to act as a good submissive son,” Harry said.
“Yes I am!”
“No way that English boy got into Volkovio!” one of the boys who sneered at Harry and Niall said. “That’s the best Semey.”
“I don’t see any of my friends here,” Harry said before he could think.
Harry choked on his food, coughing violently as he grabbed something to push it all down. He downed a large glass of water and sputtered at Ron. “What?”
“What do you—”
“Who does not believe me?” he asked, only to have no answer. “Good,” he purred. “Draco, can I borrow your parchment? I need to write a letter.”
“I did,” Theo said. “I did not know that they would actually do it—nor was I watching the game. Instead I have heard of them planning, making up that stupid song with it’s awful rhymes. It was I who told Draco, who in turn told both you and Harry earlier today.”
“I know,” Voldemort said.
Ron and Hermione got on and quickly started to make their way to the prefect carriage for their start-of-term meeting. “I’ll bring you to our compartment before I have to go,” Draco said. “Come on, pet.”
“That’s horrible!” Niall gasped, “but Neville, if you want to learn how to control a broomstick, I’m happy to help.” He looked over at the adorable omega and smiled once more.
talk with him,” Remus muttered.
There was a crack, and Kreacher appeared in front of Sirius, bowing so low that his nose pressed against the floor. “What can I do you for, Master?” Kreacher asked in a sarcastic tone.
“Okay… dad,” Harry said, Voldemort smiling with pride. “Can I ask one more question? What was my name? My full name.”
“You could have said something,” he said, disappointed.
“Slughorn?”
“You’re not scared or freaking out?” He asked.
These strange occurrences kept happening, and it wasn’t until Harry brought home a large fairy tale book a year later that it all started to make sense. “We can do magic!” he said happily.
A great swell of song rose from the Slytherin stands below:
“…Fleur is here,” Ron said. “Did you know Bill and her are dating?”
Nagini said.
“No, she’s too stubborn to be ignorant,” Draco said.
he emphasize with a wink, “isn’t that right pet?”
“And I tell you over and over again the potions do not affect me!” Uncle Remus yelled back. “You know that was always a possibility!”
Draco just smiled. “Harry Potter you are the best boyfriend a guy can ask for,” he said. “Come on, we should probably get to Herbology before Mrs. Treadwell gets angry too.” Harry nodded and allowed Draco to pull him through the corridors, smiling to himself as he felt a strange sense of happiness and rebellion bubble inside him. He could feel the answers he needed close by, just around the corner in fact. All he needed to do was a summoning ritual. He knew from common knowledge that other warlocks and witches tried summoning the Dark One, and they all ended in failure, however, as he stared at the spiraling horns on his hand, he felt that his attempt would be different. That just because he was chosen, he would succeed where others would fail.
“I know you won’t Alpha,” Harry mewled. Harry didn’t want to stay in the tunnel, so he took Draco’s hand and ran the rest of the way until the tunnel leveled up and started to rise into the basement of the Shrieking Shack. They both immediately gotten their wands out and started casting every protection and barrier spell they knew. Harry had to stop, gasping as he felt the moon’s call for him to shift, but he fought it off until the whole shack was protected, and he and Draco were in the bedroom.
Harry giggled and thought,
Remus nodded and patted the space next to him. Mr. Riddle stood up hesitantly and sat down next to Remus, cautiously putting a hand around his Omega. “I’ll always love you, Remus,” he whispered.
The twins looked at each other and nodded, “We can do that, can’t we Fred?” George asked.
“Well, with that settled, I have a question for you Weasley,” Draco said, changing the subject. “Is there a particular Omega you have your eyes on or sense?”  Ron blushed, and tried to answer the question but only blathered nonsense.
“Yours,” Harry moaned. “Please fuck me.”
“Professor Lupin?”
“I don’t know,” Harry said, “It’s just a feeling I have. Something bad will happen if Draco and I are left apart.”
“Draco!”
“Oh,” Lavender said, her smile deflating a little, but Ron did not notice, he was too busy focusing on making sure he didn’t trip. Lavender’s smell made it awkward for him as it was very distracting. “Uh Lavender,” he said, “what perfume did you use?”
“They will! Trust me, we just need to find the right combination, the right dosage,’ Sirius said. He turned around with a hopeful look on his face and kissed Remus. “Come on love, we had a long day, and a longer day tomorrow. Let’s get some sleep.”
“A correction?” the Minister frowned. “What do you mean?”
Harry replied to that small part of his mind.
Harry felt his breath leave his body. He stared at Lestrange, and he felt a small fire burning inside him despite the depressing numbness. His hand twitched and started for his pocket. Voldemort saw this and continued, “Tortured both hours on end… first as interrogation, then it turned into pleasure… in fact, it was a little after I’ve attacked you, Harry. They missed their Lord and they wanted to find me… even if it means making your friend’s parents insane.”
“It’s worth the risk, there’s a major meeting they’re having,” Fred said. “Even Snape’s there!”
They both glared at each other, Harry could feel both their anger growing. “You are my apprentice—I spared you,” Voldemort seethed, “You do not get to choose to go against me!”
“What’s going on?” Harry asked, “What are you all doing here for?”
“Just one.”
“If you even think of finishing that sentence, I will make you regret it Harry,” Draco threatened. “We’re married now, I love you and you are my submissive! Under law and the Clause, you will do everything I tell you to. As such, you will involve me in this plan of yours.”
“Alpha,” Harry groaned, “stop—someone could see us.”
Remus shuddered. He stared at Voldemort, who stared at him remorsefully. “I did not mean to—”
“But milord—”
After Harry left, Voldemort had Nott Snr’s body deposited right in the front room of Theo’s home, where the teenager found him. Draco didn’t have the stomach to tell him what happened, how Voldemort forced Harry to kill him. He thought it was best to keep that to himself. Instead, he held onto his friend, rocking gently as he rubbed circles on his back. “We’ll get through this,” he whispered. “Everything will get better Theo.”
An anger took over him, a Heated anger that he couldn’t control. Slamming his bathroom door opened, he dressed and left his room only to find Greyback waiting for him down in the foyer, smirking at him. “Looks like it worked,” he laughed. Draco saw red. His fist tightened and he felt blood rush towards it as he ran towards the laughing Greyback. Before he even knew what he was doing, Draco swung his fist at Greyback like a common muggle, landing a blow directly against his cheek, pushing with his whole body.
“Nothing more,” Lilith said.
“I’ve stayed home most of my life or just by myself,” Harry said. “People… they always insulted and bullied me because of my looks.”
“I guess… I’m just worried,” Draco sighed, “about everything, it’s just still happening too fast.”
“Someone placed my name in the Goblet of Fire, someone who wanted me dead… and who wanted me to win also, all so I can be at that graveyard tonight. They turned the Cup into a portkey and teleported us to the graveyard. However, they only wanted one… me. They didn’t account for you, you almost died Cedric. They casted a Killing Curse and, by some miracle, I was able to push you out of the way while a gravestone jumps up to take the blow. You were knocked unconscious by the action, and I became very dizzy.
“There’s no bloody way I’m calling you Harrison,” Ron said strictly. Harry laughed and smiled He gave Ron a one-armed hug and grinned.
The three nodded and worked quickly to make a menu that they were happy with. Compared with the seating, this process only took a couple hours. “Good,” Uncle Remus smiled, “I will make phone calls and arrange for a tasting then.” He quickly wrote something down, “Now, for the invitations…”
“What a wretched existence it must have! To be named a boy but to act like a girl? My, someone needs to set the boy straight.”
“Thank you… you’re the first person besides my uncles who told me that,” Harry said.
“God that felt good,” he sighed. “You alright, love?”
Back in his room, Harry stared at the pile of letters he tore apart. There were just little scraps of paper, and as Harry looked at it, a sudden fear exploded in his mind. What if one of those letters were from Ron and Hermione?
Harry dropped his fork as soon as the flavor hit his tongue. Dread washed over him as his stomach lurched and cramped immediately.
“Great not you too,” Ginny muttered, “God are all the boys here so stupid over a pretty lady?” The trio glanced awkward looks. Ron opened his mouth to say something, but Harry shook his head. “What? Did I say something?” Ginny asked.
A party. With people. Wasn’t the point of going to New York was to disappear? To become another face in the crowd? If he went to this party, Draco was scared that somehow, though illogical, someone might recognize him. It was the small anxious part of his brain that fired off all the worst possibilities. Someone would find him. Someone would recognize him. Someone would tell his parents… tell Theo.
“Is it free?” Harry asked.
Draco thought for a moment before shaking his head, “I’ve never seen her before either,” he said. “And father never mentioned her, and he complains about everyone.”
“Because you’re a monster,” Harry answered. “You’re a disgusting monster who only cares about turning others into monsters.”
“No you don’t,” Daphne said, “Draco’s family had a contract with mine. He was supposed to be courting either me or my sister, but then it turned out that both of us are gay. Also, who do you think you are coming here and talking like that about our friend!”
“Uh night… Nott…”
Harry smiled and chuckled to himself. “Uhh Potter, you okay?” Greengrass asked.
“A stupid joke,” Draco shrugged. “Good news, I got Blaise and Theo to not wear it—not that Blaise would, he called it tacky.”
Identity
Satisfied with his answer, Mr. Riddle turned back to Harry. “Have you seen anything strange tonight? Anything weird phenomenon that would help explain your hand?”
“Harry are you sure that’s a good idea?” Hermione asked immediately. “What if—”
“Of course you support the most successful team! That’s not being a fan that’s just following the trend!” Ron said. “You have to be with a team during their ups and downs!”
Harry raised his head slightly to look at Blaise. Blaise smiled and cupped Harry’s chin with his fingers gently, “Are you okay?” he asked.
“It’s going to be awkward,” Harry admitted, “calling you dad.” He looked up at Voldemort.
“Honestly, Ron, do you really have to ask?” Hermione said, her cheeks tinted pink. Ron looked at her, confused. “I don’t get it,” he said.
“I don’t know,” Harry said, “Neville has improved a lot over the semester.”
Harry and Draco sat for a second before turning to each other. “We did it,” Harry said.
“You’re—you’re not mad?” Harry gasped between kisses, their mouths and tongues pressing against each other, dancing with one another as small moans drifted from their throats.
The familiars greeted them first, Loki in particular happy to see Harry as he and the two dogs followed Harry and Draco into the kitchen.
“So you really just expect us to just do what? Sit?” Draco said, staring at the pillows rather offensively.
Ron grinned, “How about you? Any tats?”
“With the help of an old god,” Blaise said, the attention turning to him. “My father is powerful, yes, but he is not a god. Something that many people forget. He has conceived and birthed me; however he isn’t all-knowing or all-powerful. He’s just a fallen angel. With the help of one of the old god, the lost deities that my father and his minions locked and kept captive more than a millennia ago. It was they and my Grandfather, he who your coven calls the False One, who brought magic into the world. My father locked them away until it was just him and Grandfather, and then he took magic for himself, bastardizing it into the form you all know. There is an old god who is known as the Trickster God. The Greeks call him Dolos, however he is known better by a different name.”
“You’re such a good brother,” Harry muttered as he sat up and pulled the tray towards him. “Stupid but good.”
“Yeah,” Ron nodded, “See you there.”
“Right! Come on—Draco I’ll meet you in the common room,” Harry said. Draco nodded and squeezed Harry’s hand. The two stopped and stared at each other for a moment. “I—” Harry began but found his words failing him. “See ya,” he muttered and pulled his hand away.
“Harry,” Dumbledore breathed but Harry did not stay to explain or listen. He ran out of the office, down the spiraling staircase and away from the gargoyle. Dumbledore did not chase him. Nor did he yell for Harry to stop. Not that Harry would listen. He just kept running, his legs carrying him further and further away from the Headmaster’s office. For a second he thought to return to Gryffindor Tower but thought better of it. If Dumbledore would look for him, there would be the first place he would check. So instead he ran down. Jumping down steps, skipping them three at a time whenever he could, almost tripping over himself as his heart raced and his brain ached as the vision of his father seared into his mind.
“Yeah fuck that,” Niall said shortly. “All I care about is my friends and omega.”
“Yes, father,” Harry nodded. “Tomorrow I’m going to look for how exactly the Alpha Protein is getting into my food. I know that it is tied to my usual seat for whenever I sit with Draco, it doesn’t appear. I’m thinking of going to ask the house-elves in the kitchen.”
