“Mr. Draco Malfoy should be going to Mr. Harry Potter. Dempy has everything under control here.” Dempy beckoned Draco to the Floo with a stern face.
Jonathan took the remote control. “Let’s see what Draco is doing.”
“Would you have joined me?” Harry perked up.
Please note that I added a warning for a mention of potions addiction. The person manages to stay sober despite temptation.
But unlike most people, they treated him like any cafeteria employee, and not someone they suspected of spitting into their soup.
“Please, call me Harry.”
“Did I say that out loud?” Harry ruffled his hair. “I just wish you had told me you weren’t planning to sleep in my room.”
And in their eyes, Draco had gone out of his way to change his ways. He was working alongside the elves, which most wix considered humiliating, he didn’t complain or hex anybody who dirtied the tables on purpose after he had just cleaned them or shot hexes at him. And from his meagre salary he donated what he could to two charities: A pre-Hogwarts children’s centre, where kids from Pureblood and Muggleborn families got to know each other and could form friendships beyond the old barriers in wizarding society, and Padfoot House, a place, where kids from abusive families could find safety.
As soon as Weasley was out of Draco’s mind, Potter sent his Patronus to a person called Uche to bring a cup of tea. When she brought the tea and the chocolate, Potter didn’t, as expected, give them to Weasley, but pushed them in front of Draco. “It may be only Twinings, but it will help you feel better.” He gave Draco time to finish his tea, before casting his own Legilimens.
“I was there when Lucius did it. There is one way out. But the thing is, Draco can’t do it. He can’t even know it before the wedding day. There’s a fifty percent chance of success.” Narcissa smiled at Harry encouragingly.
Harry sat down, cast the shaving charms, and then said calmly, “The only thing my uncle taught me was when to run away from him and when to pretend I didn’t exist. It was Sirius who started teaching me, when it was actually still a bit early, and then Arthur Weasley continued when I really had enough facial hair to need to shave.”
Harry wanted to flee, but the stylist stood between him and the way to the exit. Fuck, they are witches, or Squibs. They will want autographs.
Draco had casually inferred two months ago that they would like to get engaged to Harry. They had also mentioned wanting the proposal to be done publicly if and when Harry was ready for it. Harry had been ready for the engagement back then, but had wanted to find the perfect ring. To do everything perfectly. There had never been a question over whether he wanted to be married to Draco. Not once since he had first seen them again. Harry had been drawn to them. Their spellbinding stage presence in drag; their love and understanding of Muggle culture; and the sexy, intelligent and amazingly soft person they had proven themself to be.
Draco glared at him but reluctantly agreed. Hermione and Harry moved to the kitchen to warm up the quiche Ron had baked. They had agreed that Ron would bake something salty, as Goyle was going to bring sweet baked goods. The Slytherin had opened a bakery that was one of the two things helping him overcome the stigma from his parents’ actions, the other one being his engagement to a nonbinary Muggleborn. But his spouse-to-be would not be around today, they were on a business trip to Portugal.
He pushed the chair towards a mirror, and Harry was astonished. He had never looked this good.
“No, Pureblood. We’re riding my motorbike to Neville’s summer house, where we spend the night at his greenhouse suite. He lent it to us for tonight, and tomorrow evening, we’ll take a Portkey to Grasse.” Harry said softly, as he helped Draco put on the contraption. He led him to a big motorbike. Draco knew it was one, because in Aunt Andromeda's house he had seen pictures of his first cousin once removed riding one, but Sirius had not worn the Bubble Head thing.
As soon as he felt in control of himself again, he vanished the mess and fell into a dreamless sleep.
Draco just gave him a smile and nodded.
A short time later, Potter slowly opened the curtain. He was clad in velvet trousers in a dark purple, a berry-coloured silk shirt with intricate details of gold and silver embroidery on the collar, a waistcoat that was the same rich purple as the trousers, the front of the waistcoat was lined in velvet and the back in soft adorning silk. It looked perfect with his skin tone, and the trousers hugged his arse perfectly, so perfectly, the discreetly cast Flaccidus failed Draco.
“Were you even listening, Harry?” Since Luna had gotten serious about her relationship with Ginny, she had also become more insistent on people listening.
It had not only been Harry’s love helping Draco break free from their past.  With Harry, the Weasleys came into their life. And while every member of the Weasley family had threatened them with their own version of a harsh punishment should they hurt Harry, their brother in all but blood, as soon as the Weasleys had seen that Harry was happy with Draco, they protected Draco just as fiercely as their adopted family member.
“I came here to report witnessing a failed attack--against you. You had an incident with a strange transfigured Cupid who poured a liquid on you and tore out a strand of your hair on February 14, Potter.” Draco started.
“Harry Potter. At least you’re bonded to a decent man.” Greg sighed sympathetically. “I’m sure he won’t blame it on you and look for the person who sicced the gnome on him. You can trust him.”
The elf Apparated with a pop. “Mr. Draco, you called?”
The letter from Lee Jordan was a bit rude, if he thought about it, as if Jordan assumed that Draco would love to give his hut away for filming and camp in a hidden spot in the copse for two whole weeks instead. Yet, there was nothing he could do. He knew his place.
“A brilliant choice, Potter, you will get the best makeover of your life, impress the fuck out of your ex and the git who marries him, and maybe before the wedding is over, you’ll have someone better than that Finch-Fletchley in your arms. You know, we Slytherins are experts in dressing for success.”
more,” Hermione exclaimed in a gentle voice. Harry wondered, not for the first time if Hermione was a discreet legilimens. No, she seemed to be just the best at that subtle legilimency everyone but him seemed to have mastered. When had they been taken aside and taught it?
“Harry, you know what, Meowfoy reminds me of James when he was in detention at a Hogsmeade weekend just after getting together with Lily. All this whinging and pining. Even Binns let James go that time.” Sirius’ grinned, like there was a very interesting prank story behind it.
“So, how is living with Draco,” Hermione asked immediately after they had closed the kitchen door.
“Let this be the last time I hear such a thing.” An exasperated look appeared on Harry’s face, making Draco flinch. “Here we come to Rule number four, actually the most important rule of all. In this house, we respect each other’s friends. I won’t insult your friends, and I expect you not to insult mine. Name-calling will only be tolerated as part of a consensual friendly banter, and definitely not behind the person’s back.”
“Hey, darling. How was your morning?” Harry hugged him from behind, and Draco wondered where he had come from. After all, behind him was the way to the kitchen.
“Ah, good morning, Mr. Potter, I see that you Apparated in.” Their voice was soft, with a slight Wizarding Southampton accent.
“I hurt a lot of people before the war already, because I parroted my father’s beliefs,” Draco stated, grabbing handfuls of Legos and piling them on the scale pan closer to him. The first handful he called his pre-war guilt. He kept piling until the pan touched the tabletop.
That was unusual. Nobody ever wanted to go to Draco’s tiny cubicle. Usually, people activated a protean charm to make him come to them. It was not really good for the efficiency of his work, but what could he do? He was obliged to obey his superiors, and compensate for interruptions by working longer.
“Yes, I became one in the summer between sixth and seventh year. I wanted to go unnoticed, to escape the attention, but for that, my Animagus form is worst. I’m a unicorn. I could only transform in my locked room. They would have killed me for potions ingredients if they had seen me.” Draco had never told anyone about this before, not even Luna or his mother.
“Oh, he does.” Astoria said with a smile. “He told me you were his gay awakening the day you both got your first Hogwarts robes. He waxed poetic about you being the most forbidden and most desirable person back then, and about you being the person whose friendship makes him happiest today and whom he secretly and hopelessly loves today.”
“Paaaaansy, you’re supposed to be on my side.” Draco exclaimed with a pout.
When they awoke the next day, the rays of sunlight that would usually wander across the bedroom floor on sunny days had already disappeared, indicating that it was past noon. They didn’t even need a Tempus to tell that. They turned their head a little and looked into Harry’s beautiful emerald eyes.
But Harry knew that Sirius would not let him off the hook about it, if Meowfoy didn’t calm down by himself, Sirius would surely insist.
Harry stifled a laugh and leaned against Draco’s shoulder; it was just for credibility, wasn’t it?
“You must be fucking kidding me.”
“Can you give me a little advice on the house bonding later? Also, for now, what clothes would you recommend for me to wear to impress Harry?” Draco asked.
“Marls, most people aren’t Animagi,” a boy with turquoise hair said.
Maybe Malfoy would watch him, as he was cooking but Harry knew that he was good at cooking, all his friends praised his culinary skills.
“Come on, Harry, you’ll share the bed with me tonight. I put a board in the middle, so we won’t disturb each other. I can’t have you suffer from backache while you accommodate my elves, my best friend and me. Also, remember, the cats sleep on the sofa.” Draco said with a smile.
“Oh, Draco. Our Harry is very well aware that you didn’t ask for that mark, that he who splinched off his nose occupied your house and would have killed you had you said no.” Sirius touched the invisible border beyond which portraits could not reach, and Draco knew that if the Animagus could, he would squeeze Draco’s shoulder.
“Yes, I would like that. But you have to know that I haven’t – haven’t done it with any person yet. My only sexual experience is with toys.” As soon as Draco had said it, he was afraid of Harry’s reaction.
“Thank you for responding in the middle of the night. Harry needs our help. He’s having a horrible nightmare. Can you give him this message and ask him to read it immediately? I know it will help him feel better.” Draco asked.
When they stepped into the sitting room after redirecting all Floo interactions to the sitting room fireplace, Draco and Ron were engrossed in a chess game, and Ron had a pleased smile on his face. “Hey, Harry, finally someone who is a challenge on the chess board.”
“Of course not. Remember George Weasley’s invention Amor’s wellness? You smell what Amortentia would smell like to you, while everyone else just smells an ordinary, but well-chosen cologne or perfume and it doesn't fuck with your mind.”
In the following weeks, they fell into a routine in each other’s life. In the mornings, just after getting dressed, Draco and Pawter would floo to 12 Grimmauld Place. Every other day, Dempy would Apparate in with an impressive breakfast, and the day it wasn’t breakfast it would be dinner. They would bicker over their breakfast, but instead of annoying each other, it would feel rather – nice, to be honest, very nice, Draco mused.
“No, I wanted to be his friend the first time I saw him, but I insulted two people he cared about. Then, of course, he didn’t want to be my friend. And I was a sore loser when he rejected my friendship and decided if we can’t be friends, we must be nemeses. I was such a dramatic kid. It was not until fourth year when I realized that I was attracted to him. But by then Voldemort was back. And, of course, the boy was on the Light side.” Draco looked down.
And at least Harry would always be Draco’s friend and colleague. They had the days together, breaking curses, playing Seekers’ games. It was no use to grieve for what he couldn’t have. He had to be grateful for what he did have.
Trust Luna to spring the news on you that your former class- and housemate came out as nonbinary and you are to re-integrate them into your friend group when you need a cattery.
“Nobody needs to kill Lestrange. He’s dead already, perished through messing up his own very dark ritual, as the Unspeakables who examined his body found out. I saw the body.” Ron scrunched up his nose. “It was a disgusting sight. But his head, his wand-hand and his magical signature were intact enough to identify him beyond a shadow of a doubt.”
He didn’t brew that afternoon, instead, he cast cleaning charms on every surface until a throng of five worried elves followed him asking if he was going to fire them.
Draco Malfoy,
He had noticed how Draco had stumbled through his show before.  Had made plans of using it to tell him clearly that this freakshow was not what a Malfoy should do, especially as he wasn’t even good at it. Then Draco had transfigured his jumpsuit - at least the jumpsuit had had trousers - into a dress that had an elegance that Narcissa could have worn during their courtship. But honestly, a dress! And Draco’s hair, it wasn’t a manly long hair, tied back strictly and straight, but the untamed curls of the Black family with a sparkling tiara! All the Malfoy ancestors would roll over in their graves at the thought of Draco dressing up, wearing makeup and playing Madame Eltanine!
“Healer Creevey, could you go to the other end of the corridor and cast a Muffliato? I need to tell Lucius something.” Achilles requested.
Harry had the vague feeling of having seen Emily, the brown-haired hairstylist before, but he couldn’t place her; maybe she was a friend of Dudley’s, after all. Dudley had apologized to him, and they had formed a tentative friendship, and Harry had attended Dudley’s wedding and the baptism of his daughter.
Will you marry me?
“Firstly, he’s working somewhere, and secondly, I said something utterly embarrassing, Dempy.” After mumbling these words, Draco asked the elves for help, and together they continued with housework.
As Harry came from the bathroom after brushing his teeth, his blanket and pillow were gone. Instead, Draco was sitting on the sofa.
“Mr. and Mrs. Walters?” Harry asked, beckoning them into the house.
“Technically yes, but it’s a bond used by mediwix to stabilize emergency patients, usually with a close relative as the giver. It’s the magical equivalent of when Muggles donate blood. Only we don’t need blood donations but magic donations. Both your magics take a week to replenish, during which you may spend as much time apart as you want, but it’s not advisable to cast any spells of any kind then. Harry, if you are around Malfoy, you can cast whatever spells you like for this week, but he can’t cast at all for the first two days, then for three days he has to limit it to first year level spells, even in your presence. It doesn’t do anything with your minds or your affinities for each other, it just helps Malfoy replenish his magic.” Granger lectured. “Although, it’s unusual for people who are not relatives or lovers to form a magic replenishing bond without knowing such a thing even exists. That usually requires a medical training or a pre-existing bond of any kind. Hmmm, perhaps the reason it happened between you both is that you defeated Voldemort with his wand… I’ll have to do some research on it. But if you know nothing about it, this is risky. You could have ended up a Squib if you hadn’t taken him away from Malfoy Manor immediately.”
“If only your parents hadn’t given you such an asinine name.” Draco snarked. He couldn’t let on that he, in fact, loved the name Harry, but only tended to say it when he was indulging in some clandestine activities in his bed.
Astoria looked at him quizzically. “Did Draco analyze the curses on his rings with you? He only told me about discussing the matter with Bill Weasley.”
“Draco doesn’t want to meet Prongs in person. He says that Prongs would only hate him if he knew who was hiding behind the pseudonym.” Luna melted into Ginny’s embrace.
“Mr. Harry told Kreacher to check in on Mr. Draco Malfoy.” It was an old, ancient elf. “Does Mr. Draco Malfoy need anything?”
“Hello, Mick, how are you?” Draco leaned over the table and exchanged air kisses with Mick.
Draco popped the candy into his mouth and started getting up, but Harry stopped him. “I fancy you, too.”
“Breathe with me, Lucius, in - and out…”
Draco didn’t know how it was for others, but for him, after becoming a ghost, time had become a rather blurry matter. Apart from the time Potter had been here (was it an hour or a year ago?) the hours might have ticked away like seconds, or he skipped a lot of them. He could see days and nights passing, but while he could easily count the leaves on the cherry tree outside the kitchen window, despite their large number, he was unable to count the days.
Meanwhile Draco  had scooped up Paw into his arms gently, and made his way to the Floo, shouting “Bye, Mick, Potter. Mick, I’ll firecall you.”
Another day in the shitty ministry cafeteria. Another day of having to clean tables and wash dishes. Another day of people insulting him at any opportunity. But Draco was aware that it was necessary to go to work. If he didn’t want to starve, he needed to work, and the only way to earn money was to work as the kitchen wizard alongside the House Elves. And also, maybe he didn’t deserve anything better.
Whitley and Dawlish. They were high-ranked Aurors, very pompous, and they both tended to leave their table especially dirty whenever they ate in the part of the cafeteria where Draco cleaned.
and Draco had become Wizarding Britain’s first Drag Queen.
“I can’t tell you much except that it had drops in a green web around its eyes and smelled of artificial flowers. Its mane was between yellow and grey. And its voice sounds like a flying stinger.”
“Mad Eye Moody showed me the nose in the DMLE evidence room when I was in Auror training. He splinched it off close to the beginning of the first war, and there was evidence that he was drunk as a skunk.” Sirius gestured vividly.
The girl just shrugged. Something about her features seemed familiar to him, although he couldn’t place it.
I can’t claim that I’ll ever find it easy to accept your way of life. But
“It feels good to wear it, especially because it reminds me that even if nobody looks I can still make myself feel pretty,” Draco admitted, feeling bold and stroking over Harry’s chest.
With a soft growl, Malfoy woke up. “The elves cook faster,” He mumbled.
“It’s Malfoy. And it didn’t make him hate me less when I saved him from the Fiendfyre or when I spoke for him at his trial. How could anything possibly help if saving his life and keeping him out of Azkaban didn’t?” Harry muttered with a frown.
The next nine days didn’t feel like a witness protection program at all. When they weren’t shagging or sleeping and cuddled up against each other, they researched and prepared the house bonding ritual. Harry had to meditate for preparation in every single room — including en-suites and the pantry — and Draco learned more about the horrors of Harry’s childhood when Harry asked in a small voice if it was necessary to meditate in the cupboards, too.
Luna returned with a white cat in her arms and placed him on Harry’s lap. To his amazement, the cat just rolled up and purred, looking rather like a white fluffball. The shade of white looked just like Malfoy’s hair. But why did a cat make him think of Malfoy? Malfoy would hex him and not roll up on his lap and purr. Also, why would they allow Malfoy to become an Animagus?
“In the next two weeks, we are going to help not one, but two wizards!” Karamo announced as the black car turned into a nondescript street in a London suburb.
“Scared, Potter?” a new but all too familiar voice drawled, and Harry succumbed to his knee jerk reflex and replied the way he had always replied to it during their Hogwarts days.
)()()()(
“They would - have - killed me.” By now big tears were streaming down Draco’s face.
Well, Draco didn’t smile. He was wearing his best poker face, which the Malfoy traditions valued more anyway. He assumed that his relatives never smiled in their wedding pictures because they too had to marry someone they didn’t love.
Just as he was about to apologise, a young girl who appeared to just have graduated out of Hogwarts appeared through a door at the back of the room. “Cousin Mick, is Harry Potter bringing Mr. Malfoy’s cat? I didn’t know they were friends.”
“Meow! What an asinine name! If you had a dog, would you call them Woof? And a pig Grunt?” Draco lashed out.
Something caught his eye at the window. He took a closer look. Potter was pacing outside, his posture revealing that he felt tense, probably nervous. Was Potter going on a date here, too? Or did he have a meeting with a bunch of Weasleys? It was a humiliating thought that Potter might witness him being stood up by Prongs.
Officiant Abbott started his speech about marriage, and spoke banal words about raising children and the magic of getting married in spring. “And now, let us come to the ceremony itself. If anyone has objections to this marriage, may they speak now or forever hold their peace!”
“There’s enough room for you all at Grimmauld Place, I inherited it from Sirius Black, so you have a family connection with the place. It should be easy for you to interact with the magic, as Narcissa Malfoy is from the House of Black.” At his words, Harry saw a flash of relief cross the elf’s face.
Harry got down on one knee looking more elegant than ever. “Draco Eltanine Malfoy, will you marry me?”
“Canus sit!” Draco made the wand movement for colour spells, a circle.
Harry wanted to pull him into a hug, but that wasn’t possible.
“If your father were still alive, I’d hex him six ways from Sunday.” Dennis reached out and stroked her cheek.
She smiled at him and mouthed “I’m proud of you.”
Harry rummaged through his cabinet for an empty notepad, he knew he had one somewhere.
He massaged Harry’s scalp with shampoo so tenderly, it was the most relaxing feeling. The shampoo didn’t have the usual salon fragrance, but a different one, one that seemed to be exactly Malfoy’s cologne mixed with Treacle and the air above a Quidditch field.
“Can’t have my friends stay in such a horrible place.” Harry tried to make it short.
“Hello, Harry. Your hair looks exactly as it should. Ready to go?”
If only Narcissa had done her duty better. Draco was thirty already! He should have married and sired an heir and a spare before now. But when he had told her yesterday, she had just laughed in his face, and her new husband had told him to leave lest he call the Aurors.
“Wouldn’t you help me most by leaving me alone?” Why did he have to sound so whiny when he wanted to sound like Snape, maybe. Who would take him seriously if he sounded like a spoilt brat?
His attitude towards visitors depended on how they made Harry feel. The only visitors allowed to touch Meowfoy were Andromeda, Teddy, Luna, and surprisingly, Neville. But he would sit in Harry’s lap and act comfortable around Hermione and the Weasleys. With Oliver Wood visiting, Meowfoy had a major hissing fit lasting until the Quidditch player left. And Meowfoy watched Dean and Seamus critically, not allowing them to go into the kitchen or drink alcohol.
The hand slowly moved lower, as the voice said:
“I know he has become a good man, but why would he fancy me? He’s not impressed by the hero myths around me, and nobody has ever wanted just plain simple Harry.” Harry’s voice got small and high pitched.
Harry, who had a shy look on his face and said in a very soft voice. “If you want to, I’ll be your bride. Your mother said that you had to promise that you’d propose to one of the Greengrasses and get married.You followed through with the proposal to Astoria but it's never specified that you have to marry her. I talked to her. She would rather marry Dennis Creevey. She only had to promise to say yes to your proposal and get engaged to you. You could break the engagement today and marry me. If you’re afraid of your aunt and cousin, I’ll take Polyjuice and look like her, and Officiant Abbott will know and someone can mess with the microphone, so we can include my name in the ceremony.”
“This is your case. You have the right to get a lot of information on the results, as soon as having them won’t mess up the test.” Granger gave him a reassuring smile. “Call me Hermione. I think we have some acquaintances in common.”
Pictures Draco's first outfit was modeled after:
Ron rubbed soothing circles on his back. Hermione came over and both Granger-Weasleys hugged Harry muttering words of comfort.
“The Golden Boy is the persona the press wants you to be. I know better than to assume that you were him.” Draco said quietly, so only Potter could hear. Shame flooded through him, thinking about all the times in the past when he had fed into the gossip.
“No, he thought pureblood men don’t hug and from when I was seven years old, my mother also only hugged me secretly. He was very abusive, to me and to Mother. I’m glad he will never be part of my life again.” It was the first time Draco had said this to someone face to face who wasn’t his therapist. He had written it to Luna and Prongs, but then he had not seen their reactions in the same second.
“I would like that, too.” Draco moved closer to Harry.
The headmistress and Paper Magnate Dennis Creevey came in last, while the string quartet had already started playing the tune to which the priest, the groom and the Best Man walked in.
Dudley laughed. “That explains how she always gets the biscuits no matter how well her mom and I hide them.”
“I  -  I woke up – and – the board - had disappeared – and you were – spooning – me with – morning wood. And I pretended – that – I was still – asleep. Because I fancy you.” Harry cried.
“Yesterday, as I was cleaning the tables, a gnome with wings collided with my face, dousing me in a weird potion. Since then, I’ve been hearing somebody’s thoughts, I think as soon as he’s a little emotional the thoughts get transmitted. I couldn’t manage to transmit my thoughts to him, on the other hand.” He hid his hands under the table. Pansy didn’t need to see them shake.
Friday had come, and Harry had agreed with his friends as well as Draco’s friends that this week instead of pub nights, both friend groups would have a little potluck get-together at Grimmauld Place. The first to arrive were Hermione and Ron. Harry noticed that Draco tensed when Ron greeted him. He excused himself for a moment and brought a wizarding chess set from Regulus’ room. “Draco, you told me yesterday I’m pants at chess, Ron’s the best chess player I know. Maybe you guys could play a game until the others show up.”
“I never felt offended by you following me. In sixth year I was forced to fight against you, and was afraid that someone might want me to kill you or take you to Voldemort. I wanted to make you avoid me, but I never considered you creepy, quite the opposite. But asking you to share the bed with me while ifancyyou… That was creepy of me.” Draco started loud but his voice got smaller and smaller until it was reduced to a mumble.
“I’m a vegetarian. No allergies, just a slight aversion to Brussels sprouts.” Draco smiled despite the situation. It was decent to ask about his diet.
Harry had discussed it with Ginny, Luna, Ron and Hermione, who all had told him they trusted his judgement and would be on his side if anyone was to tell Malfoy bullshit. Ginny had said: “Even if Percy is my brother and the groom, he would catch my meanest bat-bogey hex if he insults your plus one. On the other hand, Merlin and Morgana have mercy on Malfoy if he doesn’t treat you perfectly well.”
“Like two men who have been communicating by anonymized owlpost for over a year, but need a confidence boost to meet in person,” Karamo said. “Their nominators have set up this penfriendship for them, because they have watched each other for years before, and despite a very fraught past, the sexual tension between them has always been immense. Like one of them has dated No-Maj lookalikes of the other in the past and the other collects the first one’s charity calendars.”
He gently kissed Draco’s forehead. “I’ll be back in a moment, but that eagle owl out there will break the window if I don’t open it soon.” Harry  exclaimed as he padded to the window.
Yours, Luna
“I can’t. I’m here for work, not as an Auror, I quit the Aurors, but as an estate agent. The owner died and her heir wants to sell the house.” Harry locked eyes with Malfoy in a silent challenge.
Then Harry collapsed on the ground and curled up in a ball.
Draco took the Potter Armiger ring from the cushion Ron was holding and slowly slipped it on Harry’s finger. “With this ring I wed you and I will from now on be Draco Potter. I will love you with all my heart, be there for you, and be true to you forever and ever.”
Harry put a beautiful gold-and silver ring with an emerald and a diamond on Draco’s finger, got up and they met in a sweet long kiss. Draco felt their cock stir up under the notice-me-not.
“So you save lives on your job.” Karamo added more colourful Legos. “Draco, can you look at the scales?”
Theodore Nott! Harry remembered the boy he seemed to be at Hogwarts, silent, always a bit grumpy, and in comparison, Emily looked happy.
and after that our love will still be standing tall.
“Will Draco be there, too?” Dennis asked.
The end of the day lead to Mary skipping cheerfully alongside Dudley as they strolled to the local cafe to discuss the upcoming renovations.
“I believe, he’ll wake up soon. And he’s a very brave little cat. Before he came to Theophanu, he spent his first six months in the house of someone who didn’t treat him well. He still has a scar on his forehead from this time. It’s amazing how he overcomes his trauma. I believe he can help you overcome yours.” She brought out a rattling cat toy, and the little black cat stirred.
A nightmare about what Potter obviously feared about the night before Draco’s trial.
“The thought of blowing a fit bloke?” Draco blurted out. “To be honest, at that moment it just felt hot, and when I found out it was you, I was more worried about you being uncomfortable with me receiving your thoughts and sensations.” As soon as he said it, Draco wished he could take it back.
“That’s a whole messy lot of feelings, small wonder it overwhelms you.” Ron concluded.
“That’s what one calls a friend.” Potter’s voice sounded like a deadpanning voice, but his smile was like the sun coming through between the clouds.
Looking forward to working with you.
“May I introduce to you Uther Weasley,” Achilles lifted Weasley’s hand to his lips, then continued.”...bonded to me in matelotage. We had to borrow pirate customs back in the day, Your child will have it significantly easier when he…”
It was too silent to really recognize the person speaking, but loud enough for Draco to find it familiar.
“I won’t. At least not yet, and I’d rather avoid Obliviating people if I can. Did you hear Harry think of a Department I might or might not be in?” Granger’s voice sounded friendly, but could he trust her? He had never given her a reason to treat him well.
“Draco. We’re not credible on last name terms.”
“Er, I need to talk to you. And this house has to  be sold, and I want it to be only bought by people you want to have here.” Potter’s voice sounded shy.
The scent reminded him of green eyes, fights in school corridors, and desperate wanks behind the drapes of his four-poster immediately after the fight, still smelling Potter’s scent. “This reminds me of a boy I went to school with. He loved treacle tart. How often I watched him across the great hall!”
“Merlin forbid that I see Rabastan Lestrange! I’d cast an AK without even batting an eye!” Harry finally brought out through the choking rage.
“Look at them, too stick up their arse to even dance a waltz, no, they do a Minuet that was out of fashion before Binns was born. And that idiot calls you broken! You deserve a boyfriend who only has eyes for you, someone who knows you are the best thing that ever happened to him, you deserve someone who reminds you every day that you deserve the best. I wish I could be that boyfriend.” Draco pressed his hand against his mouth.
“It never was a bird’s nest. I was just a very sore loser. Actually, throughout my Hogwarts years, I wanted to touch your hair, just once. Maybe I became a hairdresser because it fascinated me how much I liked your hair even though nobody styled it well.” Malfoy’s hand twitched for a moment, as if he had stopped himself from caressing Harry’s cheek, but that couldn’t be.
Draco stumbled through his Saturday morning rituals wondering how he was supposed to behave. He brought the gnome, who had spent the night in the winter garden, a plate of fruits and vegetables, and noticed that the gnome’s wings were significantly smaller. “Do you remember your name?”
“House rules – I knew you wouldn’t take me in completely for free.” Draco drawled.
“You wish.”
Harry bit his tongue in order to hold back the laugh until after the couple had driven away.

Draco realised it at that moment, all the threat in Father’s gaze was nothing but a mask.  An Illusion that he could still intimidate Draco. But in reality Lucius Malfoy was just a wreck now.
“Yes, I wanted to end all allegiance to my father. I am my mother’s son, because she loves me unconditionally. Father would have disowned me if he had anything he could disown me from. He doesn’t deserve me walking around with his name.” When he spoke of his father, Draco’s voice sounded harsh for the first time.
“Come on, Malfoy, I’ll sidealong you.” Potter stretched out his arm.
“Harry! Are you ashamed of fancying him? You said yourself that he is so much better than he used to be. There’s no need to be ashamed of him.” Hermione stilled his hand and cast a grooming charm on Harry’s hair.
Harry kept thinking about his conversation with Narcissa and Pansy. He could hardly focus on anything else. He looked through all the informations he had on D1 Armiger rings and Heir rings in Grimmauld Place’s vast library; that was as usual his primary source for cursebreaking research. A curse could be dismantled easier if you knew how it was structured. But he knew he couldn’t hope to dismantle the curse if he couldn’t first get Draco out through the loophole Narcissa and Pansy had found.
“Uncle Harry, which one is your cat? I love cats but Mum says we can only have one when Abbie is bigger.” Mary and her friend Lucy jumped with excitement.
“Prosecco on the house. Let’s celebrate.” Blaise’s voice rang out between cheers.
You’re the one I’ll be with till the sky will fall,
Then the elves had integrated him into their community and he had learned how to be himself among the others. They may not be human, but they were still people, and very decent ones at that.
“A good morning to you, too, Harry. Are you alright?” Pansy gave him a concerned look.
“Oi, he has become much more eloquent since he no longer has to focus all his strength on surviving and saving the world.”
“Sorry, Mrs. Weasley, but I severed all contact with my so-called father and changed my name to Black.” Draco spoke softly, and Harry heard a slight shakiness in his voice.
He remembered the decontamination of Grimmauld Place. It had taken two long years to decontaminate, during which he had lived first at the Burrow, until he had lost his patience with Molly trying to get Ginny and him back together. Then, he had moved to Dean and Seamus’ uncomfortable sofa, and then for over a year, Luna had persuaded her father to rent a room to him. Xeno had proved to be a bit too eccentric for Harry’s liking but until Ginny had told her mother that she would never get together with a man again, that she just didn’t fancy men at all, he had managed. Finally, Harry had been able to move back to the Burrow, when Arthur had convinced her that their way of getting a son-in-law was not recruiting Harry for the position but Harry’s future boyfriend. It had helped that all Weasley siblings, even Percy, told her that they saw Harry as a brother.
Something was off. His hand was resting under his head, why did it feel as if he was ghosting his fingers across his chest? And he was wearing silk pyjamas. How could he feel bare skin on his fingertips and the touch of a bare hand presently brushing across his right nipple?
Pansy guided him into her flat above the Parks and Greg Café. Draco sat down on her sofa, as she went downstairs. Two minutes later she came back levitating a tray with hot Matcha chocolate and an assortment of cakes. “The way you look, you need the hard stuff.”
“Thank Merlin! It took me two years to make them understand that they deserve rooms and proper beds.” Draco sighed with relief.
Nothing had happened while they were drunk, but there had been no way back from Draco’s half-sleepy, but very audible murmuring “Am I dead? Is this heaven?” the next morning.
Harry was still holding his hand, and caressing the back of it with his thumb. It felt perfect.
She took takeaway out of her handbag. “I hope you like Vietnamese food, Malfoy. I’m in the Sub-Department of Statistics, Magical Phenomena Squad. We deal with the influence of magical phenomena on the lives of Wix.”
“Mr. Malfoy! I almost wouldn’t have recognized you!” A dark blonde woman of Draco’s age, maybe a bit younger, stood in front of him. He knew her face, she must be a descendant of one of the Sacred 28, but he couldn’t really place her.
“That’s what I eat. That’s all my cooking skills amount to. The most elaborate thing I can cook is fried potatoes.” Draco looked down. At least he had cleaned his fridge yesterday and eaten the last potatoes. “When I was a kid, only house-elves could enter our kitchen. I learned that not everybody lived like that only when I came to Hogwarts, and spent more time away from my father, and my house teacher mentioned that his mother had to cook for his father.”
He forced his eyes away from Regulus.
Goyle had learned to duck his head and stay out of it, unwilling to take sides between them.
"What—?"
Draco sighed. He said, "Malfoy, Draco Malfoy. I was born in 1980."
He couldn't get the images out of his head— Sirius tormenting Snape, James preening in front of Lily, Wormtail sitting there in their midst, laughing and playing along,
But no, that wasn't quite right, was it? There was a version of the Cloak in this timeline. It just belonged to James still.
"Uh, not really," Harry said with an awkward shrug. Sometimes conversations with Lily took on a bizarre undertone when he remembered
"What save?" asked James.
"And you," Harry said to Potter Senior, with such a look of
James didn't know what to think, and he wished Remus would stop asking questions about every detail because that only gave Sirius more opportunities to cast Harry and Mallory in a negative light.
Harry abruptly realized the phrase "extendable ears" probably sounded strange to someone who had never met the Weasley twins. However, he rubbed his throbbing shins, scowled, and didn't deign to explain.
His sacrifice, made from love, would ensure the Death Eaters upheld their end of the bargain, though. They wouldn't be able to kill Ron, just as the defenders of Hogwarts had been protected from Voldemort after Harry's death.
He hoped she didn't ask for details. He had read the brief paragraph about Ilvermorny in
Oh. Oh, he had forgotten that Snape
It was one of their first jaunts on the full moon after the long summer break, and Padfoot had been too wild, too excited. Remus had been feeding off that energy in his werewolf state, getting more and more ferocious, until their play-fights had turned downright vicious. James's threat of antlers hadn't driven them apart as it normally did, and, once Moony had gotten hold of Padfoot's throat and wouldn't let go, James had been forced to kick.
And Draco couldn't even save him from a stupid schoolyard bully.
"My mother was a Black, as I believe I mentioned," continued Malfoy slowly, apparently choosing his words with care. "She taught me how to duel. She was afraid for me when the Dark Lord returned. She taught me how to
Harry's horror mounted as Malfoy failed to turn him down straightaway.
green eyes.
Sirius's shoulders were tight, and he still wasn't looking at any of them.
Sirius wilted, giving James the chance to respond.
He was in the past, and once he helped Malfoy find a way back to their time, he could move on. He could move on to parents who remembered him, to his real godfather and friend. To Ron and Hermione, who at least were together beyond the veil.

Remus, James, and Peter looked at each other, still lost.

Professor Bowie took a long swig from his whiskey flask.
Harry couldn't breathe.

He gave Lily a dark look, as if blaming her for ruining their first Quidditch event of the year.
"Sorry, sorry…"
on me?"
Gertrude flashed Harry a small smile, which helped brace him against the desire to melt into the floor to get out of the conversation.
Snape scowled, but Harry couldn't tell if he was frustrated at being caught or frustrated that Harry couldn't piece it together for himself.
It would take some getting used to. Since deciding they would join the student body in order to stay at Hogwarts and continue their research, they had defaulted to calling each other "Scar-head" and "Ferret-face" to avoid the awkward alias thing altogether.
It made a small part of him angry, and he didn't know why.
"I did," said Harry, and he surprised himself with how earnest it came out. He found himself grinning as he leaned back and told Lily about it, even though he knew Lily wasn't much of a flyer and equally didn't care about Quidditch. But she listened fondly, her Potions text ignored, as he finished, "…and then Regulus came back out looking for his broom and chased us off. Threatened to tear my spine out through my ar— ah,
the first time. Now, it seemed to debate with him, and Draco muttered under his breath just as Harry had done his first time through. In the end, though, the hat called out again, "SLYTHERIN!"
He was panting by the end, right in James's pale, startled face.
The snake lifted its head and flitted its tongue to taste the air. Its head wound to face Slytherin table.
A lurching, groaning corpse appeared out of nowhere, arms outreached for Lily. It was surprisingly fast.
"Really?" Lily's tone was pleasantly surprised. "You're Muggle-born, too? Somehow, I don't think you've ever mentioned that before."
Surely, Draco could do one thing right for his godfather.
He couldn't argue, but he wanted to. It wasn't right. It made sense, but it wasn't right.

he heard himself yell.
Malfoy's jaw clenched. He straightened his shoulders, the muscles going taut, and deliberately lifted his chin as he marched up to face Sirius.
The snake was a gorgeous piece of magic. Emerald green and antique silver, individual candle flames curved in an intricate pattern to create the illusion of scales.
"Why would you say that about me?" Sirius's question finally broke the uncomfortable silence. He looked so lost, so confused. "You don't even like me."
Draco scrubbed his hand over his face. It looked like he hadn't shaved in weeks.
There were no other Gryffindors in Alchemy. Draco thought privately she had been very brave to come up to him as she had without any friends for support, especially with the way Rosier and Mulciber were looking at her.
Harry shoved the broomstick back at Malfoy, his mind shutting down even harder against the thought of staying. "No. I told you, I don't… I can't play anymore. I'm done with it."
would know all about what's right," Harry snarled, turning his back on Malfoy. He made his way back to Gertrude.
Nothing. The dementor slowly advanced, reaching out a skeletal gray hand toward Rosier's throat.
"Yeah," said Harry. "Keeper."
"Of course, I remember the purple spirit quest potion!" snapped Sirius. "This is different. I'm

Harry and the others gave a respectful and somewhat surprised round of applause for Professor Flitwick, who chuckled and gave a good-natured bow.

What was going on? He hadn't used
And Sirius comforting Harry with a grin that looked so happy and so close to tears:
"Potter," said Malfoy sharply. When Harry glanced up, he motioned with his head to the mouth of the alleyway and said, "A word, if you please."
Draco was delighted.
Malfoy would be horrified by the thought he and Ron could be mistaken for one another in any way, but maybe.
"The ultimatiest," Sirius confirmed. His bagel, last supporting a tower of bacon and eggs when Harry looked, was now stacked with strawberries, cantaloupe, porridge, potatoes, and cornflakes.
" Harry demanded.
Harry gasped like a man drowning.
Harry braced himself, watching Dolohov unblinkingly. He thought about reaching for the enchanted coin, but Dolohov was too fast. He'd never get his fingers close enough to brush it before Dolohov killed both him and Ron.
"Such as?"
Bellatrix's shrill laughter, a rippling veil—
Hope and giddiness bubbled within him, and Harry found himself smiling back helplessly. "Yeah, I think I—"
Lucius and Narcissa had fled to their summer home in France, but Draco had stayed after the battle.
"Fourth year was canceled because of the Tournament," Harry continued, feeling vindictive satisfaction in leaving Malfoy hanging when he was clearly hankering for an argument. "Fifth year…. What happened fifth year?"
The students and teachers stared, transfixed, holding their breath.
Remus clearly understood it without any further explanation. He rolled his eyes and huffed another sigh. "Fine."
(See the end of the chapter for

"Wait," said Draco, taking an aborted step after them.
"Oh, shove off!" Malfoy laughed. He seemed lighter than he had been in weeks. "We can't all be as bloody reckless as
"Focus, Prongs! What are we going to do about this?"
The broken pieces of his scattered mind snapped back into place.
Severus-the-teenager was a hard kid to get to know, though Draco could hardly blame him. Even after a single night in the Slytherin dungeons, Draco could tell Severus was an outcast. Elodie Greengrass had been the only one to speak to him with any civility. Their dormmates were crude and mocking, and it was clear they found his status as a half-blood something to torment him over. The other years actively avoided him as if he were contagious, and Severus made no attempts to ingratiate himself with any of them.
"Me, too!" cried Malfoy, literally crying.
Finally, Dumbledore rose and held his arms out, as if to greet each and every student with a simultaneous embrace.
him leveling Sirius a scathing look. "I am considering it, however. I've always made a handy Keeper as well as Seeker, and the spot is open."
something, and if I can just figure out which part…."
James laughed and held out his hands in surrender. Inwardly, he calculated how much quicker they could get to the Hospital Wing if they took that secret passageway behind the bouquet of sheep portrait.
had he grabbed onto Malfoy like that?
"Backup—" Harry tried, as he managed to duck behind a shelf and give his shield a rest.
Therefore, Draco noticed when Severus started relaxing during the second week of term.
Sirius wielded his wand like a sword. His arms were a blur of sharp flashes, jabs, and parries. He advanced, step by step, never pausing his spellcasting even when it meant ducking or leaping over a jet of light. He was a raging storm of motion, never hesitating, never letting up.
He took a few steps back, put his hands in plain view hanging harmlessly, wandless, and said, "It's okay. They're gone now. You're safe. My name's Harry. What's yours?"

Oh, that was… that was uncomfortable, Draco thought, eyebrows raising. Then again, there was a reason Severus got to be the Head of Slytherin House. Manipulating family politics to get him a willing third… that was good.
As they got into the strangest slap-fight Harry had ever seen in his life, McGonagall appeared over their shoulder with a deadpan stare.
—" he heard Hermione say, startled, behind him. She swished her wand to signal Ron and the Aurors, and then her pounding footsteps joined his on the dark street.
you must have missed something or
He gripped his wand so hard his nails dug bleeding crescents into his palm around it.
It was something neither of them wanted.
He pulled his wand on Black.
Feeling uncomfortably like an outsider, Draco edged off to the side and watched as Dumbledore performed first aid and Potter supported McKinnon, though he looked as if he needed the treatment just as badly. Potter's face was unnaturally pale and gray, and Draco could see the way his muscles trembled even under the heavy cloak.
"Harry… you are dumb as a fucking rock," said Malfoy thickly. "He was trying to kill you. He would have killed you; he would have killed all of us if you hadn't found those broomsticks and gotten us out. He was my friend, but he was
"What are you saying?" asked Harry suddenly, giving Snape a hard look. "You say you're warning me, but what do you get out of it? Why would you help me?"
"Huh?"
"What," said Malfoy, "in the name of Salazar's saggy left ball, is going on?"
"When I leave him alone," Sirius began heatedly, "he makes stupid decisions that get him in trouble!"
"Eloquent as usual, Parker," Malfoy's voice drawled behind them.
"We can Floo to St. Mungo's, I suppose. One of these shops ought to have—"
He thought, delirious.
Harry couldn't tell her it was okay that she was dead.

And Harry wanted that. Even as it pained him in ways he hadn't known he could hurt, he

He walked with Malfoy off to the side, where Gertrude wouldn't hear them.

a plan.
," Hermione repeated, rubbing his arm.
"I wasn't reckless… unnecessarily."
It was only confirmation of what Draco had already known.
"You were taking your time, weren't you?"
Thank you again for the support, my lovely readers! I always enjoy hearing from you. And thanks to Stoneage_Woman for the invaluable thoughts and advice as a beta reader. See you next week!
"I didn't—" he began weakly, the trembling migrating into his voice. He stopped, closed his eyes, and said, helpless against his own devastation, "You were supposed to be…
"Morning!" James said cheerily.
"I'm going to cast an illusion," said Bowie, "of a Dark creature or wizard. They will attack immediately. Defend yourself!"
"Let's go see," said Harry, starting in the direction of the noise.
But a single night and a single spell and
"Right," said James. He clapped Sirius's shoulder and drew away. "I've got your back, Pads. We can do this. We're going to do this. Together. We'll be okay.
"You're a Seeker?" asked James and, as if the Snitch were in on his plan, he caught the flyaway Snitch out of the air, cheeky and effortless.
"It was fashioned after Hogwarts," said Draco, shaking himself from dismal thoughts, "so it was rather similar, I imagine. Four houses, teachers and tests. It's a castle on a mountain rather than a lake, though."
And Wormtail…
But of course Sirius Black would know.
His heart hammered as he wandered up to the Gryffindor tower for his cloak.
His hysterical laughter burst out, strangled, sounding not unlike a braying donkey. He clapped a hand over his mouth, but then he couldn't breathe because he was laughing too hard, and he needed his hand to prop himself up on his knees because he couldn't stand up straight….
Parker was staring at them, the look of disapproval melting from his expression. He looked even more mesmerized by
He coughed. "Sorry."
Malfoy was a good Keeper. Better than Ron by a longshot, if only by his consistency.
Harry didn't know why he was shouting, why he suddenly wanted to
Though obviously worn thin, he hadn't lost his tone of utter disdain.
A lot of good chickens had sacrificed their young for this prank to come together, James noted with a solemn nod of gratitude.
unbearable at this point in their lives."
"Marle—
Harry catalogued the changes. Honestly, he should have noticed the differences immediately given how much time he, Ron, Hermione, and the Aurors had spent studying the street for their surveillance. But didn't they have bigger problems to worry about? Who cared if his imaginary Knockturn Alley wasn't perfect? They needed to figure out how to get out, move on.
Dumbledore caught it effortlessly and scanned the note.
"Secondly, caretaker Filch has asked that I remind you for the, ah, two-hundred-and-
He was amused, and a little saddened, to see his teenage godfather doing the same.
But they weren't listening.
"Boys!" squeaked Flitwick, hopping anxiously from foot to foot. "Boys—"
James wondered if he was remembering their conversation from the previous night on their walk to the hospital wing— about the world not being separated into Good People and Death Eaters. About how they needed to make sure they stayed good even as they fought evil.
She had it anyway. Rosier and Mulciber were watching her closely and whispering to each other with rather lewd-looking smirks.
Malfoy had probably heard Beetle the Bard's stories.
If anything, it kept him up more at night. Why was he at Hogwarts going to lessons, making friends with Lily, Mary, and the McKinnons, when he could be out there hunting Dolohov down like a
Wormtail had the small-animal behavior down pat, though.
Whatever it was, he would have been incredible.

)— blood everywhere and puncture wounds in his throat—
, Harry thought, trying his damnedest to put Nott Senior down fast so he could help Hermione. But the old man was as stubborn— and as skilled— as Mad-Eye Moody. Whatever he lacked in youth, he made up for with experience. His and Harry's wands were blurs as they tried to annihilate one another.
Snape whirled to give Harry a look of shock, then Sirius roared, "SNAKE!" at the same time James's voice carried,
The thought was tantalizing, even if Dumbledore had expressly forbidden him and Malfoy from changing any major events they knew of in the past.
"Hogwarts," said Gertrude firmly, and then she winced, hand gripping her ribs. "I don't… I'd feel safer at Hogwarts."
There were other Death Eaters in the small supply room, at least six that Draco could see. And— what in Merlin's name?— chains and handcuffs, covered in blood, lying on a table in the center. A table just behind Harry. Behind Harry, whose bare wrists and ankles were bathed in scarlet and gore.
"Whoa, what's your issue, Parker?" said Black, frowning and leaning away from the wand tip. "It was a joke!"
But maybe that was what the Savior of the Wizarding World looked like. He had been gone for a while between the end of their sixth year and that final duel with the Dark Lord.
international championships!"
Defeating Voldemort still didn't feel real most of the time, even when he had been back in his proper timeline. After spending the past seven years agonizing over it, sacrificing for it, fighting tooth and nail with everything he had, with everything at stake…. It was surreal to think it was just… done. After a single night.
He thought of the first years, so
Draco waited impatiently for the stroke of genius.
But their own trap worked against them.
The blinding light fizzled out amidst the cloud of steam.
"You're not Dumbledore," said Harry stupidly, and then he realized he was speaking aloud.
Together, James and Sirius inched closer and listened.
He had almost lost his godfather again before he'd even had him. He had almost just watched Sirius die a second time because Draco Malfoy had, of course, been trained by Bellatrix Fucking Lestrange, who had been Voldemort's protégé.
Dumbledore leaned back in his chair, expression shuttering as he heard Draco's last name.
Harry didn't answer but, as Malfoy shook his arm with the sleeve Harry was clutching, he forced his fingers to release one-by-one.
They had less than forty-eight hours to come up with a plan.
It passed, though, when Black grinned a cold little grin and told Severus, "You heard the Lily-flower. Move on, before even the
"That doesn't make sense!" Remus said, and James had lost count how many times he'd resorted to that argument. "You must have misunderstood—"
As the girls led the way to the next class, closely followed by the Marauders, Harry resisted the urge to look back at Malfoy. It was bad enough Malfoy had made him look weak in front of the entire class— for once, a class of strangers who didn't know him as the Boy Who Lived or the Savior of the Wizarding World— now he'd made Harry look like a Slytherin sympathizer in front of
It was a sobering thought.
Harry was the only wizard alive who ever found out what had happened to him. His family, his friends, Voldemort… they had never learned the truth.
Here he was, yet again at odds with his future father and godfather.
Draco had a bad feeling, too.
. Remus and Tonks, even with their newborn baby Teddy at home… they'd come back to Hogwarts to fight for him. They'd refused to give him up when Voldemort had demanded it, and they'd
The Marauders were in the clear.
feet. Co-dependent, that one, Draco thought with dry, dark amusement.
The sight beyond made him want to vomit.
Harry shook his head, breaking eye contact just in case, and took a deep albeit shaky breath.
To his credit, it took longer than his first Sorting. Harry recalled how the hat had barely grazed his hair before screaming "
Maybe it was the school that did that to them both.
He saw Ron crumple one last time under that same wand, his face still red from the force of his screaming.
"I'm perfectly well, thank you!" Draco said, the wild look not leaving his eyes. He cast about frantically, mouth working silently as he apparently tried to find an argument against Harry's logic.
"They sure seemed chummy in Defense when Mallory stepped in like Harry was a bloody damsel in distress," said Sirius relentlessly, "and when Harry grabbed onto him like a harlot in Transfiguration."
"And what were you and Reggie chatting about before he started shrieking like a banshee?" asked Sirius archly, taking off his gloves and wrist braces.
There had been that terrible power, that darkness and cold that had built around Potter. It had flooded over them in a torrent even as Dolohov had released his curse.
Remus looked at the clock again and raised his eyebrows. "Better hurry if you want to catch Gryffindor's. Ravenclaw went first thing this morning, and Slytherin will be starting anytime now. Hufflepuff is waiting until tomorrow."
He stood up and nodded to Malfoy. "Come on. Library."
He threw the owl into the air and then promptly disappeared under Sirius's bulk with a surprised
"First years, line up, please," said McGonagall. "Seventh years, at the back of the line. And in we go; follow me."
Insanely, he thought of the seven Harrys escaping Privet Drive for the last time, that stupid, stupid plan that had gotten Mad-Eye killed and could have gotten all of them killed—
"What did he—?" began Draco, looking at Severus's bed for the source of the problem.
There was a mix of groaning and cheering in response.
Together, she and Dumbledore levitated McKinnon to the infirmary while keeping up a steady stream of healing spells.
"From surviving a Killing Curse, obviously."
All four of the Gryffindor seventh year girls crowded around Harry to show him the way.
"I wonder where your true loyalties lie," murmured Regulus. Then he looked at James and said, much louder, "
eyes warm and knowing. He smiles, ever so slightly, like he didn’t even realize he’d been doing it all this while. “I guess I do.”
“Thanks for the help,” Draco replied flatly, even though he knew full well that there was no real way for Potter to help him. “I guess I did everything I could, then.” He cleared his table with a flick of his wand, ignoring Madam Pince’s glare when the books flew haphazardly back into their respective shelves with a soft
They broke apart as Draco trailed kisses down Harry’s jaw, and yes, here it was,
Draco added. He stirred. The overwhelming peppermint scent faded away and he sighed, breathing in what now smelled exactly like a warm, comforting mug of hot cocoa. Merlin, he had to get a grip on himself.
“Alright, alright,” Draco said hastily, reaching for his wand and cringing when he found that it, too, had suffered a similar sticky fate. “Stop moving, will you?” With a wave of his wand and a
Harry looked like he wanted to smack himself. “Oh,” he said again. “I was wondering where I put that-”
Harry smiles, eyes suddenly gone a little watery. “It’s true, what they’ve been saying,” he goes on. “All those years and people kept telling me that my mom died to save me, and I thought they were just saying things, speculating, but it’s true. I never…” he trails off, clears his throat, voice closed off and choked. “My dad didn’t even have a wand in his hand. He didn’t stand a chance.”
a toady green. “The flowers, the cookies. I’m willing to bet that the storm was you too, wasn’t it? That’s what Amortentia smells like to me - rain and jasmine and ginger cookies. And, well,” he started, but he didn’t get the chance to finish his sentence before Harry leaned forward and sort of
Stormy nights were warm ones, ones where he could come downstairs for a cup of cocoa or tea, fall asleep by the fire without being chastised for it, and wake up the next morning feeling the kind of well-rested he hadn't felt in a while, the kind of deep sleep that lingered on the inside of his eyelids and the joints of his limbs all day.
Somewhere along the line, though, storms didn’t seem so scary to him anymore. Draco got accepted to Hogwarts and suddenly, his world was filled with things that actually
he amends, figuring that if he can listen to Draco cry about his mother at arse-o-clock in the morning, then he can call Potter by his first name.
“I heard you say you needed basil,” said Potter, holding up what was definitely more than the required sprig. “I took the last few in case I messed up. Which, you know, I usually do. Anyway, here,” he added, pressing three sprigs into his hand, speaking much faster than the average person could probably make out.
“Yes?”
With a huff, he picked up the cloak again, intending to send it to be laundered and sent back to Harry’s room, when he saw a neatly folded, unsealed piece of parchment flutter slowly out of the pocket of the robes. From the messy scrawl at the top of the page, he recognized it as a letter, possibly the letter Harry said he was writing the other day in the library, and he picked it up. His fingers itched to open it.
“Four sugars or five?” Potter teases lightly, and Draco opens his mouth to argue that he only takes two sugars, sometimes three if he’s really feeling like it, before three sugars are already floating their way over to his cup, along with a splash of cream,
A shape emerges from the bushes, definitely human, walking straight towards where the tent is pitched. Draco’s heart hammers, and he clutches the wand tighter. The figure comes closer and closer, stands in front of the tent, right where the boundaries of the protective wards are, and raises a wand. Their face is hidden in shadow, and Draco can’t see it. “Just like a squirrel,” he reminds himself, and opens his mouth to hit them with the
They don’t talk about it, in the morning. Everyone has bad dreams, Draco reasons, pulling on a jumper and a pair of worn jeans. Everyone leading this life has bad dreams, nightmares, they’ve all seen people get killed and they’ve nearly been killed themselves. It’s nothing to make a fuss over.
Draco doesn’t ask what it means. He looks at it some more, feels it tug at him, feels it laugh, feels it whisper.
“Just leave,” Weasley grumbles, pulling Granger closer to him. Draco does, because he’s sure that they’re about to start snogging any moment and he has no desire to witness any of that.
, or maybe
, it hurt like a bitch, but he supposed he had acted like a bit of a diva, trying to get Hagrid sacked like that, and he definitely hadn’t meant to get the hippogriff executed… he was definitely more than a little rude when approaching it, but how was he supposed to know that his father would suddenly start caring about him? Most of the time he threatened to write to his father, he was making empty promises - his father never really wrote back. It would usually be his mother, fussing over whether the food was adequate and whether or not he was too cold at night, usually advising him to order the house-elves to make him feel more comfortable, wheedling over his arrival back home for Christmas…
“It’s different to me,” Potter whispers. “I can feel
“Okay,” says Granger at last, visibly relaxing. A little pang of hurt strikes him, that she doesn’t quite trust him even after the four of them have been on the run together for weeks and he’s not only refrained from so much as hexing them, but has also saved
Draco grabbed his hand and hauled himself up with a soft grunt, dusting off his cloak. “Why do you keep sneaking up on me, is the question,” he grumbled, trying to ignore how warm Potter’s hand was, even without a glove on. He had nice hands, he noted, calloused from years of playing Quidditch but still very soft. He made a mental note to see what kind of moisturizer Potter used.
He walks into the kitchen to find Potter putting the kettle on. He balks for a moment, not sure if he should say something, but then Potter turns around and gives him a smile, curly hair flopping into his eyes over his glasses, wearing another hideous jumper, this time in Gryffindor colors, red monogrammed with a large gold H. Draco’s stomach does another funny flip at the sight of Potter like this, all loose-limbed and pink-cheeked from sleep, the side of his face lined with pillow creases, and he frowns.
Potter frowns. “Not exactly, I- I’ll explain later. Are Ron and Hermione in there?” He starts towards the tent.
of a lifetime, just before the wards shimmer and Potter walks through.
. “And, well,” he looked at
“You’re awake,” says Weasley, not turning around, and Draco wonders, briefly, how he knows, because he hasn’t made any sort of noise or indication to it. “How’s your head?”
but it was rather hard to do that when all he could feel was the clasp of his cloak pressing against the spot on Harry’s sternum, the soft, curly strands of Harry’s hair tickling his nose and the soft pressure against his bottom lip. He exhaled so forcefully that he really did think that he was going to pass out, and it took everything he had to bite back a particularly revealing moan - Harry had none of these restrictions, it seemed, because Draco’s hand seemed to have wandered its way under the hem of Harry’s uniform shirt, which had also blessedly come untucked from his trousers, and he let out the kind of sigh that made Draco admittedly a little weak in the knees. It seemed that any and all space between them was completely gone, and they were pressed up from lips to toes in one beautiful, glorious, line.
“My lord,” Draco hears himself say, voice barely a whisper. “I can’t-”
“Hey,” Draco said, nudging her in the shoulder as he took  another sip of juice. “You’re averaging at least an Exceeds Expectations in every class you’re taking, and you’re up until three in the morning every day working your arse off. If you don’t get an Acceptable, I’ll eat a flobberworm. And,” he added, holding his hand up like he was taking an oath, “I’ll personally curse your creep tutor’s buttocks off myself.” Sometimes he thought that Pansy would have been really good friends with Granger, in another world, maybe.
but instead what comes out is a weak groan, and the crease between Potter’s eyebrows deepens. “He’s really hurt, Hermione,” he hears Potter say. “We should leave, go somewhere that’s not out in the open.”
Slughorn didn’t seem to mind that he had walked in late, or maybe he just didn’t notice Draco slide quietly into his seat on the left side of the room. He saw a shock of red hair in the row in front of him as Weasley turned around to see what everyone was looking at. His eyes took in Draco’s appearance and he turned back around and leaned to his right, probably whispering to that nuisance of a boy - and sure enough, a moment later, Potter turned around in his seat to glance back at him. His eyes widened just the slightest amount, and yes, Draco had to concede that seeing him at anything less than his finest
“Well, yes,” Draco replied, not bothering to hide his impatience. “Clearly, that’s why I wanted it in the first place. But Potter hasn’t returned it to the library yet and I need to finish Slughorn’s assignment now-”
All that was well, but he couldn’t help thinking about the last thing he had smelled...something like apples and pears but also not quite… he supposed he could try and find an ingredient pertaining to apples but that was such an unremarkable and strange ingredient that he doubted there was much written about it. Was it something Filch used to clean the halls? It could have been, seeing that he definitely spent hours crooning over his cupboard of cleaning supplies.
Draco’s face is cold and wet, his sheets gone damp with sweat. He dreamt about the cup, today, the voice speaking to him when no one else could hear. The pain came later. The pain always comes later, just when everything goes quiet and he thinks it’s morning and he can wake up safe. “Draco,” says Potter again, hands sliding down to his wrists. The room is dark, the rain outside soft and soothing, already lulling his heartbeat into something marginally steadier. “Tell me about the storms.”
Ah, shit. Potter probably hadn’t told them about meeting Draco in the Astronomy tower last night, then, or that he had left to go study. Not that there was anything to tell, of course, but he just didn’t want to create any more drama than was necessary. For Potter’s own good, of course. “Just assuming,” Draco stammered. “You know, because he’s always messing everything up for me.”
With a sigh, Draco pointed his wand at the flame and it grew just barely bigger, and his potion started bubbling gently just as described in his book. With a pleased grin, he chanced a look over at Potter as he was reaching for his dandelion root, just to find that the other boy was staring at him again, with another weird look on his face, but this time, he glanced away the second their eyes met, staring very pointedly at his own potion, which Draco could see was turning the exact crimson color which the book noted meant the potion was almost complete. Draco frowned and went back to stirring his potion, which turned a rather odd shade of puce when he dropped the dandelion root in.
Pansy laughed. “Thanks Draco,” she said gratefully, standing up and gathering her books. “Have fun staring at your boyfriend. He’s staring at you too, you know.” She said the last part in a conspiratorial whisper, and flounced off with a wink, before Draco could make any sounds of protest. He looked up casually, trying to play it off as if he were examining the contents of his goblet - he was looking for more Hair-Removing Solution, he could say if anyone else insisted that he was making eyes at Potter over breakfast - to see that indeed, Potter had a stare fixed on him with the intensity of a hippogriff. Instead of looking away or scowling at him like he normally would, though, Potter gave him a tentative smile and a wave when their eyes met, making Draco start to turn pink again. You know, he really hated being pale sometimes because he ended up blushing a hundred times a day for absolutely no reason at all.
Harry keeps his gaze locked on him. “Nothing?” he asks, taking a step closer.
Outside, the January sun is holding on to its last rays of light, even though it’s barely five in the evening. The protective bubble around the tent is holding soundly, for now, although it only seems to amplify the roar of the rain. The ground outside is cold, but blessedly dry, and Draco sighs and sinks into a seated position. He’ll be on watch for a few hours, and he’ll wake Weasley for his shift around ten, seeing as he wasn’t on watch yesterday. Until then, however, it’s just Draco, the rain, and his bust loaner wand to keep him company.
“It’s a horcrux, Draco,” Potter says, like this word is supposed to mean something to him. “We’ve got to destroy it before we can kill Vo- You-Know-Who,” he says hastily as Draco lunges towards him to slap his hand over his mouth.
It wasn’t until later, with all of the rest scarfed down and cleared up, that he noticed the neat little note placed on the plate:
“Draco? You all right?” Potter looked concerned, and for good reason, because Draco had probably been sniffing his cloak and staring at him like a madman, so he dropped the handful of fabric and sniffed distastefully.
Potter looks him up and down, sweeping his eyes over the length of him, his torn-up jeans from running through the woods, the jumper he stole from Weasley, his mismatched socks. “You need to do it,” he says at last, stepping back. Granger and Weasley give Potter a strange look, but make no objection. “Go on.”
No, Granger was too smart to use a potion like that anyway.
, but Slughorn’s shout of “pay attention everyone!” snapped Potter and Weasley’s eyes back up to the front.
“I just knew,” says Draco simply, “I could feel it,” like that explains anything.
, Draco.”
Draco vaguely remembered a rumor going around their sixth year, that Weasley had spent two weeks in the hospital wing after being poisoned by a love potion - or something to that effect. He hadn’t entirely paid attention; he
“Yikes,” he says instead, sipping his own tea carefully. There’s not enough sugar in here, but Potter moans something awful when he makes his tea too sweet, like Draco’s forcing his cup down Potter’s throat. He drops in another sugar cube for good measure, ignoring the fact that they don’t have enough money to be throwing sugar cubes around like this. Hot, sickeningly sweet tea during a raging storm is one of the few comforts Draco has left to enjoy.
and a copy of
whined Goyle, fidgeting anxiously by the wall. “Help me! If I’m late for Charms again, Flitwick is going to curse me into a teacup.”
he thinks numbly in some far-off corner of his brain. “With me now, that’s it.” One more deep breath, and then another. He can feel sensation coming back to his fingers, Potter’s heart beating along the line of his pulse, the warmth of his skin through the worn fabric of the jumper.
“There’s no one way to be traumatized,” Harry says pointedly, slipping to the ground beside him, and Draco feels rather stupid all of a sudden.
Potter gives him a sad little smile. “I’m used to it,” he says. He surveys the cup, sitting on the rock. It seems to tremble as they near it, like it knows what’s coming. “Here,” he says suddenly, handing Draco the sword. He takes it carefully, in awe, like he’s in shock.
“Fine,” he grumbles, “but I have a shitty wand so please forgive me if I can’t use it in time to save you two.”
Too late. Draco closed his eyes just in time to feel a burst of sticky sap cover him from head to toe. He sighed. It was going to be a long morning.
Draco leans over and touches it, and immediately he feels it, cold and hard and unforgiving pressure around his heart, just enough for his breath to catch and his hand to pull itself away. “Christ,” he says, breath coming in gasps. “It feels like that all the time?”
, and picking up
but none of those words come out. Instead, he reaches out and grabs Harry’s hand, pressing it to the pulse of his wrist like Harry always does for him. “Hey,” he says, squeezing. “I’m alright, see?”
Draco frowned, staring at where Potter was standing. The rain had almost completely stopped now, the air cool and calm from where it was coming in through the window. He stood there, breathing in that soft, earthy smell that he loved. He shook his head to himself and started back down the stairs. He did have an essay to finish, after all.
“I guess not,” he says, still smiling enough to make his eyes get all crinkly. “All mums are the same, I suppose.”
He spotted Potter’s bag in the corner, filled to the brim straining the seams with unnecessarily large books like the one he was holding -
Draco looked down at the list, eyes widening at the long list of books crammed onto the small piece of parchment in cramped, tidy handwriting:
“N-not at a-all,” Draco said, wholly unconvincingly, even as his traitorous teeth began to chatter and he started shivering uncontrollably. “I-I’m fine, r-really.”

He looks at Weasley for a moment, and then shrugs. “If you want,” he says, “but honestly I think Potter can take care of himself long enough to find his way back. Plus he knows how to get through the wards.”
that he had found after it had, to Potter’s word, tried to rip the fingernail off his thumb.
Pansy greeted Draco in the common room with a cheerful “Merry Christmas!” and a peck on the cheek. She handed him a small parcel wrapped in shiny red wrapping paper, and he took it, feeling immediately bad that he hadn’t gotten her anything - “I’m so sorry, we didn’t have any Hogsmeade trips this year - but she waved off his apologies. “Don’t worry,” she said, “it’s really small and I just asked mum to owl it here because I saw it in a catalog, but anyway go on! Open it!”
Harry doesn’t even blink. “Who?” he asks, eyes darting between Draco’s own.
Draco had woken up on Tuesday morning in a pool of stinking, sticky liquid, covering the floor of the boys’ dormitory in a layer at least half a foot thick and splashed onto the beds. His trunk was open, clothes scattered across the room and drenched from when he was in a hurry to get dressed the day before. Goyle was standing on top of his desk, holding a horribly lumpy, bruised-looking plant a foot away from his chest and muttering frantically under his breath.
Slughorn shook his head. “Nothing at all, m’boy. Remember to turn your heat up.” His shoes
boiling hot, this time - Stupefies an unsuspecting squirrel, casts a halfway decent shield charm, summons a barrage of pebbles from the base of a large tree, until he’s surrounding by enough rocks to build a miniature fort. He levitates a good bit of them, and then puts his shield charm to test as the levitation fails and they fall around him. “Ow,” he says aloud, rubbing his shoulder where a bruise will definitely form tomorrow, but he can’t say that he didn’t have it coming.
Draco breathes, again and again. “C-Cocoa. The- the fireplace. The floods.”
god he honestly didn’t know how he missed it, any of it.
He couldn’t put that into words, though, not even if he tried. “Yeah,” he mumbled lamely, hoping that it would convey whatever words his stupid, verbally inept brain refused to sound out. “I don’t, though.”
“What the
Wait. “His
” he says to the pile of tea leaves in the sink, and the wand twitches sharply in his hand and vanishes about half of it. He sighs and throws the rest away himself.
“No,” croaks Draco, esophagus burning something terrible and eyes tearing up again. He’s sure he looks a right mess. Potter’s face, however, breaks out in relief at his voice.
to keep the relief out of his voice. “Where were you?”
“I have dreams, too,” Harry admits one evening when they’re about to switch shifts for night watch. Draco’s limbs have gone stiff with the cold, after being slouched in one position for so long, the minutes ticking by before he even noticed. Harry looks down at him with a steady expression on his face.
,” said Potter, completely ignoring Draco’s question. He put his wand away and stared at him like a deer in headlights. “I could ask you the same thing,” he said quickly, turning away from the window and slamming closed the book he was holding -
the hell out of their tent, and Weasley had gone to help her. The protective wards didn’t do much for weather, unless the rain was being conjured by someone else. Still, when they come back in, their hair is dripping wet splotches onto their shirts and their shoes leaving muddy prints all over the floor of the tent. Potter has conveniently vanished off somewhere, like he always does when there’s spell-casting to be split up amongst them, chores to be done, lunch to be made. Even Draco is being helpful by making everyone tea, though he’s seriously contemplating putting an extra-strength dose of Sleeping Draught in Weasley’s after hearing him snore for all of last night.
“Thanks, Malfoy,” Granger says gratefully, taking a hasty gulp of tea before trying desperately to dry off her own clothes. She manages to siphon off most of the water before giving up with a groan and casting a warming charm on the pair of them. “Where’s Harry?”

“Don’t say his name!” Draco hisses. “Are you crazy? They’ll be on us in a minute flat!”
” Draco all but screeches, “and you just
“Ugh,” said Potter, smiling and reaching a hand to where Draco had fallen, sprawled surely very gracefully on his arse. “Why do I keep surprising you like that?” He was bundled up in three cloaks, which was
“Sorry Draco!” Goyle shuddered and huddled closer to the wall. “I borrowed Longbottom’s
for my Herbology paper, but he forgot to tell me how much bloody Stinksap it would make. Every time I try to get off my desk or reach for my wand, it makes some more. See!” He slowly took one foot off the desk and the plant twitched violently, letting out a spray of Stinksap onto Goyle’s bed, a fair amount landing on Draco’s next to it.
“Yes?” Potter replied, not looking up from his newest book.
It really was dreadful weather outside. The storm wailed at a pitch that would’ve made Peeves jealous as rain pelted the windows. Draco had already tried to cast
The next day was completely and utterly exhausting, to say the least. The castle was full of the kind of festive jollies that would usually have Draco counting down the days until he could go home for Christmas, but this year, he simply slumped along to class behind his classmates, trying to plaster a smile on his face when Pansy gloated about the E she had achieved on her History of Magic end-of-term exam and nodding along with some semblance of enthusiasm when Blaise and Goyle discussed the Christmas dinners their families liked to put on. He handed in his Potions assignment to Slughorn in a rush, shoving his scroll of parchment under the pile of others on his desk, rushing back to his cauldron without acknowledging Slughorn’s exclamation of “
Harry turned to look at his face asking for a kiss. He gave it. He didn't have to say anything. Harry knew he sickly loved him and it was a fatal sickness in his blood.
He sniggered, took another intake of smoke and blew it out through his mouth.
'Thank you! But you didn't pay attention!'
Ron came without a word and sat next to sobbing Hermione. Malfoy held Ron's hand just above Harry's heart and cut open his artery with a curse. Ron started bleeding and Harry saw the blood falling on his heart. Harry felt the pain was decreasing and his body becoming calm again. Malfoy held Ron's hand, put the wand away and started chanting a spell straight from the Grimior and when he released him the wound was completely healed.
'I know, Draco breathe in. Your heart is failing. Try to breathe in slow,' he kissed Draco's hair.
'Shall I?'
'I read!' he points at a cookbook.
He takes three more intakes of smoke watches how the smoke swirls around his head like sinful haloes and drifts into thin air as nothing happened.
'So many happy memories related to this place!' he sighed.
'Stop making that face. Just ask!' he pourd him his cappuccino and gave him his toast at breakfast the next day.
'So you have spare time to pry on me Potter, now that you are done with the Weasleys?' he pulled his wand out casually but Harry instantaneously pulled his own out and pointed it at him.
He literally lived in Grimmauled place and slept in Harry's bed. Some weekends and some days if Harry had to go out on field duty he spent the day at Malfoy Manor. Narcissa Malfoy was not concerned the slightest about him sleeping at the "Noble and Most Ancient House of Black" at all. She sometimes sent a box of sweets including a generous amount of treacle tart.
Harry froze. He didn't want to see the marks of that horrible past. The horrible pain. That hellbound moment on the Astronomy tower. He unconsciously held Malfoy's pale wrist and stopped him. He even felt his pulse beneath his palm and the comfortable warmth of his skin.
'Do you really love me Potter? You are sick!' he pulled away and gazed into Harry's eyes.
'Harry!'
Even if it's,
'Why did you rescue me from the fire you saviour?' Draco shot abruptly glowering at him.
Narcissa Malfoy returned and said that she had settled it  but Harry and Malfoy would have to see the minister the next day. Ron and Hermione's names were cleared. After Ron and Hermione had left she ordered Harry and Malfoy to stay in Malfoy Manor and sent an owl to Kreacher.
Harry was happy.
'Turn around,' he whispered softly kissing his neck and his cheeks.
'Fansy him Ronda? But no chance, he's already taken.'
They didn't say anything to each other after that. They came out of the shower together and started getting dressed. Potter was unusually silent and thoughtful.
'I had a lovely time the other day!' Harry said looking at him that he turned involuntarily.
They came home and spent hours sitting on the living room floor holding and embracing each other in silence. In that spacious house, they spent the whole afternood cuddled in each other on the living room floor.
'Yes,' he caressed his hand.
Potter kissed his pale skin now so pink, thorougly. He wrapped his hard fingers around his angry, very red cock and gave it a few strokes. How Draco loved those calloused palm and rough touch on his skin! Draco gasped moving in to his hand desperately. Symultaneously Draco felt him running the thumb of his other hand over his aching hole.
'You still have the ring on,' she smiled.
He kissed the bottom of his spine which was his favourite place. Harry felt his teeth sinking in, and kising and biting him desperately.
Harry avoids his gaze  and obtains the second coffee cup he holds,  allows him to observe, with no complaint.
'Plus sex!' he affirmed laughing.
'Why is it necessary?' Harry's voice sounds uneasy enough to stir the calm, and he doesn't want to hide the reproach.
His head ached. His eyes burnt. He was dying of this agony. He thought he was losing his mind.  And he knew before he completely went insane he had to tell him. Draco had to know.
And he loved Harry too. He still loves him. He longs for Harry. Craves Hary. Those grey eyes are full of hungry adoration. It was the sweet bitter truth screamed in his head.
He sat on the rock and let the rain wash his pain. The rain drops were raging on him beating him so hard, his skin hurt. Weeks of blinding agony in his head, in his heart, in his soul was pouring out. Hot actual tears were streaming down his cheeks and hot blood was pouring down his nose. But everything got dissoved in tropical fresh water falling from the blue sky and ran down his shaking body and ran down the rocky mountain and got absorbed in the earth. He gasped, coughed and cried. His whole body shook under thundering sky and he cried.
He kissed him. He pinned Draco to bed and kissed him intently. Draco felt his warm mouth kissing all over him, soft but a little aggressive.
'I need a favour!' he gives the shirt back with a mild expression, shows no reluctancy watching him putting the shirt on, fabric touching his skin and then the  fingers working on buttons. 'Can you call your elf?'
10 o'clock-
Harry was a happy man.
He sighed and moved.
'I'm sorry Goerge! I'm really sorry! I know it never ends.'
And Draco loved whatever was happening between them. He loved fucking Potter. He loved his rough battle scarred hands all over his body. He loved Harry's tight abs, hard muscles and strong biceps. The auror trainig and fighting the Dark Lord had made him a hard rough man. But he was a Rescue Auror. He saved lives. He risked his life to save others. He was smooth from inside. Draco just wanted to give him everything he had, do everything he could to please him. He really wanted to stay next to him and hold him till he fell asleep but Draco knew better not to.
'Potter!'
'Yeah? Thanks.'
Once they wakled out of the ministry to the apparating area Harry heard his name being called again and swore under his breath.
But he would hug him and kiss him anyway.
Draco blinked looking into his eyes. Potter continued.
'But there should be a way. Right? There should be. In your huge library there should be one way or another? Right? You can do it? Tell me you can do it.'
Malfoy gaped in shock but Harry saw the soft amusement in his eyes. He shuddered slightly when Harry stepped towards him with his hands in pockets.
'Your stupid HAO sent an owl!
While he was living a luxurious life in Malfoy Manor very much spoilt by mother's and father's adoration Potter might have cried for milk in that muggle house. No one might have sung him a lullaby. No one might have cuddled him, pampered him. Then he grew up to die for the world. If these two people had lived Potter would have lived a happier life.
'Draco!'
'Plus sex!' Draco squinted.
their lips together, and the initial sensation was so jarring that Draco didn’t even have time to think whether it felt nice, and then Harry made some sort of noise and moved his head just slightly, and oh
“You-you guys are
“Tell me about home,” Harry breathes out in a rush, except this time, Draco isn’t shaking and crying and gasping for breath on the edge of a burst of nausea. “What is it like there?” he asks, head on Draco’s chest and fingers tracing idly down the line of his ribs, tracing over the scars when he thinks Draco won’t notice.
, he finished.
An owl must have brought it to him when he was in class, or maybe it had just appeared. It was clearly from someone in his family, as it was folded into a rich, cream-colored envelope that his parents used to write their letters and the Malfoy family crest was stamped into a wax seal on the back. Maybe it was from his father, who rarely ever wrote to him unless it was very important, and clearly this was important if it couldn’t wait to be delivered with the rest of the post the next day.
Potter laughs, and Draco’s stomach does a little swoop. “I was out looking for this,” he says, and holds up a little golden cup.
, but he couldn’t bring himself to write any of those things.
What the hell was going on here?
, that was the musky, sharp tang he hadn’t recognized before. His head was spinning and a couple of third-years were definitely giving him a weird look from the staircase.
This, he can’t argue. “Don’t talk about my father like that,” he says anyway, but it falls flat before the third word. He cracks a smile, despite himself. “Really though,” he says, “I’m sorry, about it all.”
He wrings his hands, suddenly looking very, very small. Draco swallows, overcome with the unwanted urge to give him a hug, press his lips to his temples, run a hand through his hair, except that’s the thing, isn’t it, that it isn’t unwanted, not at all.
Potter grimaces. “Ew,” he says with a look of mild annoyance. “Again?”
The wind howled like a Whomping Willow outside the castle, and although the Slytherin common rooms were underground, it really wasn’t much quieter in there. The sound reverberated through the walls and bounced happily around the room for a good few minutes before reaching Draco’s ears, and at this point, he’d had had enough. With a groan, he pulled the hood of his cloak tight around his ears, as if that would keep the noise out, and looked around for the quill he had lost amongst the sofa cushions. The pile of scrap pieces of parchment, broken quills, and hastily repaired bottles of ink on the table in front of him was growing larger by the hour, but his essay for Charms stubbornly refused to get any longer.
screeched a little voice in his head.
“Yeah,” says Potter -
“Potions,” he muttered to himself, working his way towards the back of the library. For all his time at Hogwarts, he had rarely come in here to sit down and work, preferring the cool quiet of his common room as opposed to the crowded tables of students who spent most of their time shuffling away from him and his Slytherin friends, as if he’d hex them in the middle of the library. Most of them were still at dinner now, though, or were probably walking around the halls trying to catch themselves under the mistletoe and Christmas decorations that had been put up, and the library was blessedly empty and quiet. He passed the Herbology books, then Charms, and finally found a cozy table in the Potions section at the back. He looked at the list of books Granger had given him, and summoned the first three with a wave of his wand and an
to the library yet, and in a fit of desperation, he approached Granger after lunch to ask her if she knew about any other books that might be worth his time.
Every instinct he had was telling him to
and waving his wand at random as he ran desperately through the halls definitely wasn’t the most accurate way to clean something. He was looking forward to a nice, long,
and rolls away, under the bed, ignored. “You can’t lie to me Draco. I can read you like a book.”
To his surprise, Harry nods. “Me too,” he says quietly. This takes Draco by surprise, that the Golden Boy would lay a finger on anyone, really hurt them. Harry only disarms, he notices, he stuns and immobilizes and disarms but he’s rare to do anything other than that. Even himself, in the throes of a struggle at the Manor, he disarmed Draco, Bellatrix, his mother.
Draco takes another sip of tea. “About time,” he murmurs, over a mouthful of sweet liquid. “We’re not kids anymore.”
Harry frowns. “You don’t have to apologize. You saved my life.””
Granger stared at him for another moment, suspicious expression not entirely gone when she handed him the piece of parchment. “Alright,” she said slowly. “Anyway, here are some of my favorites. You might have to do research using multiple ones, depending on whatever it is that you smelled, but you should be fine.” She suddenly fixed him with a strange, unreadable expression, much too similar to the one Slughorn had on his face. “You know,” she said, eyebrows raised. “I was wondering…” she trailed off, eyes never leaving his face. Draco fought the instinct to squirm under her gaze - she reminded him of his mother, sometimes.
Draco waved a hand at him, still clutching the mercifully warmed cloak. “Don’t baby me, Potter. I’m perfectly capable of taking care of myself.” Still, he wrapped the cloak around himself, trying his hardest to pretend that the Gryffindor seal wasn’t etched over the breast, and that Potter’s cloak wasn’t warm and soft, and that it didn’t smell like-
Yeah, love potions were a tricky business, but not exactly the kind of tricky business Draco preferred to be wrapped up in. That mushy-gushy, ogling-each-other-over-dinner business wasn’t his style. Something more low-key, he thought, as he poked through the shelves of ingredients, maybe he would be interested if there was a potion to make someone want to help you with your homework, or give you sweets, or maybe even hold hands…
An hour later and Draco hadn’t moved from where he was sitting in front of the fire, one hand clenched up in a fist and other clutching Potter’s robe to his face, the one that smelled
“Who?” asks Draco, both wanting to know the answer and not. Harry meets his gaze, and then it slips down over his chest, eyes searching through the fabric for the scars he knows are there, now a silver-pink-white and nearly forgotten. He looks away.
, there were the warm and fuzzy bubbles again. “Seriously, it’s fine. I’m tired and if Seamus and Dean haven’t finished chucking their books at each other then I’m going to give them both a triple dose of the Draught of Living Death. Thanks anyway, Malfoy.” He looked at where Draco was blocking the entrance to the stairs, then put his hands on his shoulders and with a smooth step, turned them around. “‘Night,” he said, and with a little wave, turned the corner and was out of sight.
Storms in a tent, however, don’t have the same soothing atmosphere. At the first crack of thunder, Granger had sworn something foul, rushing outside to
, or that they were
“Yeah?” Potter says, like this is old information. “Christ, Draco, how much do you even know about what we’re doing?”
“My lord,” he whispers again, sinking to his knees. His wand slips out of his grasp. It’s not his wand, either, he doesn’t know whose it is.
Draco stared. “You’ve...you’ve already done Slughorn’s assignment, then?” Was he just thickheaded or was his potion just unnecessarily complicated?
With a final step into the alcove, Draco peered out the window, stuck his hand out to catch a stray drop of rain, closed his eyes for just a moment-
“I was never good at Meteorological Charms,” Harry admitted somewhat sheepishly, with a shaky breath that had Draco wanting to press him up against something and kiss the satisfied grin off his mouth.
he thought.
“Yeah, but I wouldn’t go in there right now if I were you.”
, which, consequently, Draco had been looking for in the library earlier that day. He couldn’t see any parchment or quills. “Just doing some light reading, then?” he asked, gesturing to the books.
“They’re not my friends,” Draco says slowly, taking another sip of tea. “They bloody tortured me, if you don’t remember.”
bloody way-
He felt the kind of safe he hadn’t felt in a while, too, even though the water would wash away the soil in the gardens and flood through the front gates, to the point where he’d have to charm his galoshes in order to really keep from getting muddy, sweeping through the grounds of the Manor like it was trying to wash away everything that kept him awake at night.
Potter waited.
The coward in him wants to sit there for hours, waiting until their pulses fall into step together, pulsing on the same pathetic, contracting beat. The coward in him wants to lean in and slot their lips together, and maybe it was a mistake to keep Harry’s hand pressed up against his wrist, because he feels the line of his pulse flutter, for one fleeting moment, the steady in-out of their breathing thrown off in a stutter. Harry yanks his hand back, face blooming red. “I-” he starts, seeming, for the first time in his entire life, to be at a loss for words.
He nodded along, encouraging, and Remus wondered why it felt so much like he was talking to
So tame. So sportsmanlike.
Suddenly, Rodolphus's wand flew from his grasp and into the waiting hand of Draco Malfoy. Rabastan's followed suit a split second later.
Remus took over the next bit while James floated on his Lily high.
Just like the Elder Wand had appeared in his hand in their first moments in the past, back in Diagon Alley when Gertrude had been attacked.
Dolohov was standing with his wand pointed directly at Harry's face. Instead of his usual sadistic amusement, he looked furious.
Harry clenched his fists.
, but he'd needed to learn it so he could alter it to do…
He registered Dolohov's wand in his face, intent obvious in the dark, lunatic look in his eyes, and something in Harry broke. It was like a dam giving out all at once, the power rushing forward in a tidal wave of soul-crushing, all-consuming darkness.
"But Regulus—" began Severus.
No, he didn't think he'd try sleeping again soon.
It was so easy to get lost in the everyday hustle and bustle of classes, of research, of the drama of teenagers.
"Not all of us are as impulsive and rash as you Gryffindors."
His left ear went warm, then prickly, and then the volume of the conversations around him increased while, at the same time, the words became muffled. He reached up and felt a warm, floppy, shaggy ear. His mirror confirmed it was black and reasonably like a dog's.
"Gertrude McKinnon died," said Malfoy without preamble. He had that feverous look again, like he had when he'd asked Harry if they were even.
"Boys," said Professor Bowie, appearing on the stage next to Harry and Malfoy in a fog not of steam but of cigarette smoke. "Mr. Black, it rather looks like you dropped your wand."

Draco grimaced. But Salazar, Bowie did look a bit like that idiot Lockheart, didn't he? He could only hope their similarities ended at the blond hair and jewelry.
"Sorry," said Harry again, side-eyeing his future father and godfather with mounting apprehension. "Just studying in the library with Mallory again."
Snape finally came to a point, stopped, and turned to face Harry.
He's been hurt, and he's obviously grieving. And I doubt Mallory is a Death Eater, either. Haven't you noticed how protective he is of Harry? And even when they're arguing, he's always giving Harry this look, like… like he's looking for Harry's approval or something, I don't know. But that's not how real enemies act.
why he doesn't shut up about her."
"It's alright, quite alright," said Remus dismissively, as he always did.
He was going to have to stand up and start walking, he realized with dread. Naked. In front of Draco Malfoy.
Sirius's smile twitched and then took an even sharper edge. He cast the first spell— yep, there was the fiery orange of a Blasting Curse— and Malfoy countered it with a Shield Charm in the same breath.
More silence.
Green light. High pitched laughter. His mother's screams. Dementors and a Killing Curse.
Draco? When had he become Draco to her?
"I really wish everyone would stop referring to him as 'my friend,'" Harry muttered back.
Harry clenched his fist around the edge of the desk, halting their circle again.
"Alright, Mallory," said Sirius, raising his wand. "Your sense of humor is abysmal. Let's see if your wandwork is any better."
. It's like I don't even know you anymore."
Harry loved Albus Dumbledore. He loved him in the way he suspected family loved each other: unconditionally, even when he didn't necessarily agree with him.
TBC...
never done that before." Harry was surprised he didn't choke, he used so much sarcasm.
Remus looked up from his essay and frowned. "No," he said slowly. "I think he's… confused. We all are, honestly. It's rather unheard of for a Gryffindor to side with a Slytherin on something like this. You might have noticed our Houses have a bit of a rivalry."
"Hullo, Harry," he said. "Mind if I sit down?"
Putting every ounce of bitterness he had into his voice, Draco said to Black, "We'll be in touch."
"What," said Malfoy, equidistant.
"I almost had it this time, Prongs!
She shot a nervous glance past him towards Rosier and Mulciber and shifted weight from foot to foot.
Sometimes being in the past still felt like a dream, like he would wake up and find that it had all taken place in his head over a single restless night. Like he would wake up to Hermione or Ron shaking him awake to take his turn watching outside the tent.
Draco gritted his teeth.
was her name; Severus had mentioned it several times), "Like anything you see?"
Behind and a little below him, Draco called, "Told you, Scar-head!"
Draco made it to the Alchemy classroom in a pensive mood. He sat next to Severus and was rewarded with suspicious, furrowed eyebrows and silence.
Harry paused on the threshold and turned around.
Before Harry realized what he was doing, he reached for Malfoy's sleeve and gripped the fabric as tight as he could.
"Ah, well," said James, preening. Harry suspected he was trying to feign modesty with that shrug, but it ended up looking more like he was flexing to show off his well-muscled shoulders, which were a bit broader than Harry's.
"My father taught me dueling etiquette as soon as I could hold a

"You survived a war, Malfoy," he hissed, low enough that Snape couldn't hear, especially as enraptured as he was by the spectacle of professors hurling jinxes and hexes at each other. "Are you seriously concerned about a

"And I'm not dead!"
"You got it," said Sirius with a flourishing salute, made more eye-catching by the bagel topped with a sheer tower of bacon and eggs that survived the motion. "Screamy McMindfuck it is. You know, the one that—"
He sat down on James's back, too.
The three boys looked
It made him… softer. Something about his pointy face just smoothed out with a frame of darker, loose hair highlighted by gentle waves. It made Harry focus on his eyes, he realized.
All in all, James thought it would be a great and necessary test of character.
There were only a handful of students in the common room, most outside to enjoy the pleasant weather before winter shortened the days and chilled the ground.
I'm not dead!! Without further ado, here's the chapter. Enjoy! More notes at the end.

"So you
James was the star of the team. He flew… not quite like a bird. He was steadier than a bird's sporadic, playful flight, and Harry got the impression he knew his weight and knew exactly how to move it to his advantage. He winded around the other players with speed and grace and
—!" He whirled on James, fastening his eyes on his
He held onto it, knuckles turning white, and said as evenly as he could, "So was I."
"Lily's already asked Harry to Hogsmeade for the weekend," said Peter blithely.
Sirius's grin had taken on a wild energy, a sharper edge of teeth.
"Anymore," said Harry.
"What do you mean 'last time?'" he asked slowly.
He was shaking. There was something wild and consuming in his chest, too big to fit in his half-starved body, and Harry struggled to fight it down.
As the mismatched Gryffindor trio left, Harry turned to Malfoy and said, "You're not allowed to have a crush on my mother. I can barely handle Snape. I might really spring a leak if it were you, too."
Harry remembered seeing through Voldemort's eyes as he'd dug Dobby's grave by hand. He remembered how brutally Voldemort had tortured the Malfoys and Bellatrix for summoning him only to allow Harry to slip through their fingers.
Draco was fine with that.
"…How do you mean?" asked Remus.
Lily leveled Harry a truly incredible look of blanket disbelief.
"Damn straight," said Sirius.
. We've got less than nine months before you lot are out in the real world where there's a war on, and at least half of you are going to be targeted. I don't care about the N.E.W.T. curriculum. I care about your lives. Anyone got a problem with that?"
"I don't have a—

as Ron woke from the Stupefy and watched—
Something jagged lodged itself in Harry's throat, and he couldn't speak. He could barely breathe.
He tried to breathe.
Harry tried not to think about it. He really, honestly, desperately tried. He couldn't bear thinking about returning to his own timeline, about having to
He didn't know what his face looked like, but it must have been discouraging.
"That'd be a no," said Malfoy, his normally composed expression slightly wide-eyed and wild around the seams. "He's a bit slow, but he would definitely decline, thank you. Now. Don't we have a field to take over from the Gryffindors?"
"Parker," he said sharply, to change the subject. "What's got your knickers in a twist this time?"
In the second week of term, Severus stopped casting wards on his bed and all his possessions. He had gotten comfortable enough with Draco's presence to do homework with him in the common room and had even muttered a dry but surprisingly filthy joke under his breath during their potions class earlier that day. The older Severus would never have referenced those body parts engaged in those activities within Draco's hearing before.
Severus whipped out his wand, snarling, but that was when Evans caught sight of them from the far end of the table.
Draco paced.
"Hey!" protested Black, looking both confused and offended, while Potter Senior said,
Harry found himself smiling despite himself.

of them, and Remus… Remus alive and happy, unburdened by the stigma that would plague him the moment he stepped foot outside of Hogwarts.
James released the Snitch again, preparing to toy with it some more, but Harry couldn't take it anymore.
"To our new students, welcome!" he said in a ringing voice. "To our old hands, welcome back! I have only a few start-of-terms notices before we sink into this delicious feast and become too befuddled by good food and good company to pay attention to an old man's ramblings.
"Uh," said Harry. "Just… you know. Stuff."
dead."
The green light gave way to blackness.
Draco had first noticed it the night before when he'd found the large group huddled together in the common room when they should have been at dinner. Their heads had been bent forward, and they were talking lowly with unusually serious expressions for a group of mostly teenaged boys.
But Severus continued pouring over his book, a Transfiguration text, and didn't even glance up at the attention.
Harry followed him up only because he couldn't force himself to let go of that sleeve yet. He needed it, or he'd fall again, back into that blackness in his mind where there was only pain and laughter and purple fire.
"I'm not a figment of your imagination!" Draco howled, throwing his hands in the air. "Whatever else you're hallucinating,
"Yes, exactly," said James. "Here, this is the wand movement, and the spell for mammals is
," Harry growled, thinking of Cormac McLaggen for the first time in months or more. "I woke up in the hospital wing already planning his murder. Never hated a teammate more than that one. I guess you're a better Keeper than him."
Harry shuffled awkwardly under it and rubbed the back of his head, the picture of a chastised child.
him."
"First, before we get into that, let me give you an overview of dueling," said Bowie. He was standing on the stage with Flitwick, in clear view of the students. "Although dueling is now, first and foremost, a sport in which wizards demonstrate their aptitude with offensive and defensive spells alongside their performance under pressure, dueling was long before that a means to settle disputes between two wizards. As you may have noticed in the Great Hall this morning, a challenge between competitors was issued, according to the Old Ways, by throwing one's wizard's hat at another. If the challenge is accepted, the challenged wizard picks up the hat and states the first term: weapons.
to be a Greengrass.
Sirius huffed out a deep breath and turned away. He ran a hand through his dark hair. After an unbearable silence, he said quietly, "Regulus took the Mark over the summer."
The library was an odd place to be on the very first evening of term, James would admit, but he still felt a twinge of guilt over his role in Harry's… distress… during Transfiguration, so he didn't want to judge him something as horrible as 'bookish' just yet.
“No, I can’t let him know before the wedding day. Even though the Armiger ring lies in a box on Draco’s desk, it’s still connected to Lucius, because he conducted a blood ritual before they took away his wand.” Harry sighed with exasperation.
Harry whispered in his ear, “I’m keeping you.”
“Mr Draco?” A boy with dark skin and cornrows asked.
“Bye, it was a pleasure to have Meow here.”
“Nah, he wouldn’t alert Molly because you want to experiment with threesomes. Last year they forgot to block their Floo, and I firecalled while Angelina and George were making out with Leroy from Eeylops. But the idea that one’s brother or brother-in-law knows too well what goes on in your bedroom is still cringy.”  Harry placed the quiche in the oven and made tea.
When the waitress came and brought their vegetable pakoras, Harry ordered mild to medium vegetable thali with extra raita and naan.
“Draco Malfoy?”
Please, do ask him.
“Like a couple?” Jonathan asked as it was written in his script.
Draco neighed and transformed back.
“Hold on to me as if we were riding a broom together.” Harry said when they both were sitting on the bike. Then, Harry started it, and it moved forward making noise, then it even got off the ground.
“Sorry, Draco, this time Pawter knows better on what is good for you and himself.” Pansy patted his arm reassuringly.
“Merlin and Morgana! How does he live here? This building is even in a worse state of contamination than Grimmauld Place was during the war. Despite all the efforts he takes to keep it neat, it could still kill him!” Harry muttered under his breath.
“Is he sick?” Pansy demanded. “My animal healer takes emergencies also on Saturdays and Sundays.”
“M-Malfoy? I had no idea you were here. I had no idea you were a ghost.” Harry ruffled his hair.
Mick sat at their reception table, on one of the two comfortable office chairs. On the chair beside them, Nippy, the head of the house elf team sat, shifting from side to side. She was used to sitting on office chairs along with Mick by now, but it still made her nervous when they had to talk at the reception on a day a cat would be picked up; and this time, there were two cat owners going to come in and see her. Nippy held the sleeve of her blouse, that she had sprayed with catnip to her nose. If cats loved the scent, maybe it would attract another elf, too, as she had explained to Mick this morning.
“The hat wanted to put me in Slytherin, but I wanted to be somewhere else.”
Father had told them what it took to be someone.  He had always impressed on them how to be powerful, and why it was so important. But Draco had become lonelier and lonelier as they tried to live by their father’s rules.  They had let their friendship with Pansy become more and more superficial, because she was a girl and not marriage material for a Malfoy, and turning Greg and Vince into lackeys, rather than friends. In Father’s opinion, Blaise hadn’t even qualified to be a lackey.  Despite them being in the same House, Draco and Blaise had only become friends after the War, when they had bumped into each other at a Muggle gay club. And then Blaise had opened
He couldn’t keep still and eavesdrop any longer, his arm was falling asleep. With careful movements he stirred.
“You’ve spent enough years having to be the hero. I love you when you’re strong and fierce, but I also love you if you want to be the little spoon.” Draco and Harry sort of melted into each other’s embrace.
“Where are the others?” Draco inquired.
“Honestly, you should be old enough to know you have to greet people without them reminding you.” Draco complained while his gaze followed the line of  Harry’s body.
Her logic was devastatingly brilliant, but just because others could think of love and happily ever afters, that didn’t necessarily include him.
“How is your mother?” Harry asked while assembling the ingredients for his berries and chocolate pancakes he usually made for special occasions. He remembered that Malfoy always used to have a sweet tooth.
“Nah, it’s things such as blanket forts, roller coaster rides and gliding charms. They must be something like roller skates but with magic. And bouncy castles. Draco said that I should learn to use gliding charms before Teddy’s birthday, as he wants us to go gliding with him. I don’t know, I wish it wasn’t too embarrassing to put pillow fights and tickling each other on the list.” Harry felt his face heat up when he thought of touching Draco’s milky skin just for the fun of it. And if he was honest with himself, there was something less silly than tickling he wanted to do.
“No,you oblivious git.” Harry bit back a grin. “It’s because I’ve loved you for years now. And because I wish we were married.” Harry ruffled his hair, and Draco wanted to kiss him. “If your mother and Pansy hadn’t told me you might prefer to be married to a man, I would have forever held my peace, and settled for being your friend.”
Harry approached Draco, a microphone in his hand, wearing a stunning suit in the same midnight blue dress with a draco constellation on his lapel.
“Malfoy, care to follow me to the kitchen, I know, it’s not where most purebloods spend their time, but you could have a cuppa already while I’m cooking breakfast.” Harry exclaimed as he led the way.
“Nippy is not afraid of Mr. Harry Potter or Mr. Draco Malfoy; Nippy is glad to be able to take care of the cats of the best friend of Hermione Granger and the founder of the Dobby Foundation. They is both very great people; but they is known to be not liking each other and their cats…”
“Yass, Queen, now we can see what gorgeous hair you’ve been hiding behind all that gel.” Jonathan picked up a comb with wide teeth and combed through it a bit. “It’s not unruly, it just has some cute natural curls. Prongs will have a hard time keeping his hands to himself when he sees your gorgeous hair. Could you imagine wearing it at shoulder length?”
“Harry, I discussed it with Hermione. She also thinks it’s worth trying, and that the risk isn’t that big.” Pansy added. “She wanted to be here, too.”
Harry decided to ask George about it. He remembered vaguely that Ron had told him about a perfume potion that George had sold to a shampoo company in France, some business the Delacours invested in, but it had sounded rather boring to him, as he didn’t really use beauty products.
“Accio Daily Prophet!” The newspaper came flying from downstairs.
While every Legilimens before had felt like a harsh intrusion, Potter’s felt different, far more gentle, Potter’s magic entered Draco’s mind softly and tentatively. It felt as if Potter were caressing Draco’s thoughts, and they seemed to respond to Potter’s magic like kittens to a hand scratching their ears. Perhaps it was the bonding potion. Draco couldn’t prevent flashes of thought of last night popping up, but if Potter saw that memory, he didn’t show any sign of it.

“Say hello to your new cat.” She held up a travel basket. Inside, a black cat was rolled up; he was rather small and seemed to be fast asleep.
“You’re an infuriating, daft, stubborn Gryffindor. And I—I can’t speak the words I would love to say, or the curse will maim me, but you’re the reason I get up every the morning.” Draco was glad that this was possible to say. Had he said ‘I love you’ he would have activated the curse to harm him.
“Harry, dear, I’m glad to have you here. And with a plus one.” Molly pulled Harry and a completely overwhelmed Draco into a bear hug. “Mr. Malf…”
“Ad-adjust? Y-yes.”
As Ron, Hermione and Pansy were ready to Floo home, Harry noticed that the Floo Powder was spilt on the rug, and mixed with rug cleaning charms. It would not be safe for Flooing.
“I love how he ruffles his hair when he considers something,” Draco started slowly, but then he picked up. “How his green eyes shine when he is happy, his dry sense of humour, I love the way he moves and the way he talks. I love how surprised he looks when someone asks about his feelings about something. I loved that before the trial, and since I can hear thoughts of his, I know that nothing changed about it in the last years.”
Molly squeezed Draco’s shoulder. “You can call me Molly, Draco. Make our Harry happy.”
“I will. From the bottom of my heart, I will.” Draco felt relieved by the questions of the vow. He knew that they could have been worded in a far more dangerous way, and he knew Granger well enough to be aware of how deliberately she must have chosen her words.
“Your cats have become close friends. I ran tests with what cats might harmonize, and apart from your cats, all other combinations of cats put into one room for a night would have been a disaster. So, Paw and Meow had to share a room for one night; and then I wanted to move one of them into the room that became free, but to no avail. I guess, you both will have to find a way to help your cats stay in touch.” Mick felt more nervous than they had thought they would be. The way both men glared at them, Mick was not sure if one of them would hex them or have an outburst of accidental magic. Why did they have to…
When Draco woke up, he found Granger was performing scans with her wand on him unaware of him having woken up. “Harry,” she said. “You saved his life, but you took quite a blow to your magic for it, nothing permanent, but you’d better cancel your appointments for a week. That’s how long it will take until you will be able to cast spells again without him being in the same room.”
“Thank you, Nippy. Also, Mick, thank you for sending me the pictures of Paw. It helped me a lot to get daily updates about him.” Draco told his former classmate.
“We will have to prepare Sirius carefully for the news.” Harry sighed.
It was a Muggle hair salon, at least Harry thought so. And he preferred Muggle places, especially since his dramatic breakup with Justin Finch-Fletchley, who after dating him for two years left him for Percy Weasley of all people. “He’s less chaotic and doesn’t have so much baggage.” Justin had said.
“When we moved to Yorkshire and I attended Upper sixth class there, they bullied me because of being overweight and having a Surrey accent. I realized how you must have felt all those years. I regret how I treated you. I don’t know if asking you for forgiveness is asking too much.” Dudley looked at his feet.
Draco had always thought he had taken advantage of Potter. He had felt so ashamed that at the trial he barely had the courage to nod at Potter, but Potter had also only nodded at him. To Draco’s relief, Potter still spoke in his defense. And it had made the difference. The accusation had pleaded for Azkaban. House arrest for a year followed by a long probation period was clearly better, even if the probation was as long as Draco’s.
“Mother knows?” Draco gasped.
Harry rushed forward. “Sorry, Malfoy, seems I have to carry you.” He gently picked Malfoy up bridal style. “Dempy, can you help us Apparate out?”
by Queen and
That was the corner where the audience felt weird, there, on the right, at the back. Draco focused their eyes on what was going on back there and choked halfway through their next word.
“Did he really?” Harry almost screamed. This sounded awful! But Draco always seemed to be this self-confident man who knew what he wanted and went through with it. Like proving to everyone that he was better than his father, or founding an independent cursebreaking firm with Harry that didn’t have the month-long waiting time of Gringotts and was therefore accommodating to people who couldn’t afford Gringotts’ safe storage fees. Before Potter and Malfoy Cursebreaking, those cursed artifacts would often end up in Knockturn Alley, to be sold to some ill-intending people.
“They plan to celebrate with about 20 people,” Draco replied, as Harry lay back down. He pulled Harry closer and nuzzled Harry’s neck.
“No problem. I’ve been seeing a mindhealer ever since those days, and I feel like I’m still not where I should be.” Harry thought of how often the mindhealer reminded him that he deserved good things in life, and how often he was not able to act upon her words.
Draco gasped. “That feels so good.”
“You remind me of one of my former teachers, a very good man. I didn’t appreciate him in third year, but he was the best DADA teacher I ever had. His name was Lupin.”
“About Emily’s suggestion, I wouldn’t say no if you asked me to be your plus one, but I know that it would be a risk with your found family.”
Draco smiled at Mick. “Congratulations. I’m glad she marries the one she loves. I hope I’ll find someone to love one day, too.”
Draco didn’t know who had started seeking friction, before he knew it, they were rutting against each other, groaning into each other’s mouths, then finally, they both came almost at the same time.
“If you is ready to be following Nippy, Meow and Paw are being waiting for Mister Harry Potter and Mister Draco Malfoy.” Nippy broke the loud silence.
“It was okay. I understood it the moment I saw you that you can’t just tell someone whose name you don’t know. But what does being an Animagus have to do with looking after the kids during the full moon?” Draco took a sip of his drink.
“Potter, if you want, I can ask Pansy to take over my customers, and I’ll help you choose the best suit for the occasion.” Draco’s hand landed softly on Harry’s shoulder.
“Draco, long time, how is your hair salon in Muggle London doing? I’m happy you’re here with Harry.” Arthur shook hands with Draco cordially. “Harry, Draco was the best at the rehabilitation program. He really got interested in rock culture.”
“Yeah, and bread is made from thin air.” Pansy knew Draco well enough to instantly recognise the hackles he was raising at the prospect of turning the conversation around.
“Ronald! What do wizards normally feel when they see ghosts?” Hermione reproached her fiancé.
He turned and looked at a white veil. Yet, the person in the veil didn’t look like Astoria. Draco nervous brain took a little to really grasp what he saw. The person who just lifted the veil off their face was a man. Not just any man – Draco had to be dreaming – it was Harry!
“So, are you an Animagus, Draco?”
A woman who resembled Mother, with grey-streaked hair a little lighter than Aunt Bella looked into the room. “Draco? Is that you? I’m your Aunt Andie.” She walked up to him, got on her tiptoes and pulled him into a hug. “I’m glad you won our Harry’s heart. Take good care of him, you couldn’t find a better man. And tell your mother that I forgave her long ago, and that she could visit me one of these days.” She turned, disappeared in the room, just to stick her head back out again. “Rashers or croissants with jam for breakfast?”
“You’d be surprised about some people’s affinities to creating prank food. And even though I count them among my best friends, I’d rather not give them a chance to trick me into being their guinea pig ever again.” Harry smirked.

“Rose is staying at her grandparents’ house tonight.” Harry explained.
After a long weekend of making love, cuddling and talking, Harry was woken up by a persevering knocking at the window. He opened his eyes, put on his glasses, and summoned all his willpower to leave the comfortable place he was in, with Draco’s warm arms around him.
Dudley nodded in understanding.
“Ready?” Harry whispered into their ear, and at their nod, sidealonged Draco directly into their bedroom in Grimmauld Place.
“Watch it with Granger or Weasley, they’ve always been your friends.” Malfoy’s magic pushed back in order to keep him out.
He headed for the toilet, the refuge of the losers, now he was a loser.
The audience cheered.
“And you think that we can see what’s off about this ghost? Harry, are you sure you aren’t just obsessing over Malfoy again?” The voice belonged to Granger, at least it wasn’t the Weaslette, or was she now Mrs. Potter?
A few times, Draco had tried to send the man a thought, but the bond seemed to transmit only one way.

Draco didn’t have words to reply; he just hugged his mother, feeling closer to happy than he had ever done since his early years at Hogwarts.
.  It looked gaudy.  Like it was from a child’s fever dream. There was a sign saying that Madame Eltanine was going to perform today. Lucius wondered if Draco was her stage partner or background singer. The fact that she was named after a star from the Draco constellation seemed tacky to him.
When Draco found the courage to lift his eyes after a lengthy silence, Harry stared out of the window. “You didn’t choose to be involved in this. It’s not your fault. But those people who… They are lucky they aren’t here at this moment. I hope that it didn’t make you feel too uncomfortable.”
Great-Grandfather Achilles said that with your extravagant appearance on the stage,
“You may also call me Prongs junior, darling, or if you are a bit kinky, sir.” Harry winked.
“What’s your Animagus name?” Teddy piped up.
“Do you mean the Wheezes Weasel?” Draco lifted an eyebrow.
“So, this is an impromptu double wedding?” Officiant Abbott said with a mischievous wink, as Dennis ran towards the altar with a ring box in his hand and Ron Weasley and Neville Longbottom in tow.
“I think the Hippogriff nest is safe enough if you accept sharing with him,” Weasley addressed Potter now.
He pushed the outfit into Potter’s outstretched palm from the closed dressing cabin and waited.
“Feel free to use Legilimens on me. Both of you, but one after the other.” Draco shuddered at the thought of being subjected to Legilimens again; it had been used on him every three months in the first four years of his probation. But it seemed like it would be the only way to convince Weasley.
Three male and one female voice exclaimed a jubilant “Yes!”
“I hope he doesn’t fool around with some Mudblood soubrette.” Lucius muttered to himself
Harry smiled. Ron’s Patronus had reached him around noon, informing him that Hermione was in labour. He also knew that Pansy was very angry that St. Mungo’s didn’t allow her to be present for the birth.
But they invited him to their celebrations, and Mipsy and Acorn’s wedding had been the best celebration of the last three years.
Antoni looked at it and replied: “You have the Dark Mark, but it only defines where you were then. You spent more time doing good than you spent as a Death Eater.”
“Someone told you today?” Hermione’s question was in a matter-of-fact, yet compassionate tone.
“Leave this…” The pale form of a ghost stood in the middle of the room, and if ghosts were able to breathe, the ghost would have gasped. “Potter, do you even stalk me now that I’m dead? I’m a ghost, I can’t be up to anything. Are you and your Auror pals now sending ghosts to Azkaban? Have fun trying. I’m confined to this house.”
“Draco, I rarely see a well-stocked crème-and-lotion shelf as you have. Purfskin is a good brand, and the sun protection is good, but your hair gel needs replacing. You glue your hair in place.” He picked up the jar of Shear Magic Pure Straightener hair gel as if it were flobberworm dung, wrinkled his nose and threw it into the dustbin. “We’ll buy something better.”
“You were over-sensitive now because I was a git then.” Malfoy dried Harry’s hair and turned to him. “I suggest leaving your hair long, just cutting it into shape and using some products, so you can have it more manageable, you could still tie a ponytail or wear it in a manbun.”

“But I am. Want to see it?” Draco couldn’t keep from grinning.
“It definitely isn’t Obliviate. That’s the spell to make someone forget something. And she probably made you forget your name. What do you think, if I call you Cupid until we find a way to restore your memory?” Draco tried to ignore the obnoxious noises the gnome made while eating.
“I have to Apparate. I’ll give you a call, and the Galleons…” Harry rushed to the door.
“The first thing I heard was his thoughts about the monologuing of his colleagues during a meeting. Later, it seemed like a song was stuck in his head on his way home.”
“So, we’ll start this on uneven footing? No.” Draco drew his wand and cast a Flaccidus on his own crotch. “It lasts four hours, I think. We’ll just have to wait, and do the cuddling before the sex.”
“Want to see if you like my wrapping paper?” Harry’s voice sounded even sexier now.
“Yes, but it will take a little experimenting because the elf who baked it uses elvish measurements.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hello, - Mick. How are you? We all haven’t heard from you in years. It’s good to see you again.” He smiled at them. In his school years, he would have considered their fashion choice awfully crass, but he had matured enough to understand that their parents’ over-rigid clothes rules might motivate someone to dress and hairstyle like an impersonation of the Pride flag. And all the colours were in shades that suited Mick’s complexion well. He may be a man to cringe at someone's bad fashion choices, but his definition of a bad fashion choice was nowadays less shaped by convention than by the question whether a particular cut, shade, pattern or fabric were unflattering to the wearer. In that sense, Mick dressed louder than Draco would ever think of dressing if he wanted to play a clown, but every stitch and every hair was chosen to be still flattering Mick’s complexion and body shape.
Antoni carried two cakes and Earl Grey tea to the sofa table one after the other. “We got two cakes from our two heroes’ families: A treacle tart from the Weasleys, and a tarte Tatin from Narcissa.”
The burial casket flag was presented to Draco though he was not married to Potter. Kingsley and Arthur Weasley had unanimously decided on it. He received it holding his head high as a marble statue with a stone hard gaze in his eyes, not shedding a single drop of tear.
Draco parked the car in the garage next to his racing motorcycles. He hadn't ridden his motorcycles for three weeks now. One was cutom made and one was an Aprilia which he had enchanted to fly and hover like a helicopter.
The time was eight o' clock in the morning and he has slept well on the sofa. With his shoes on. He was thirsty. He quickly drank some water and opened the door.
Seven cigarettes.
He turned his head towards him and started kissing again. He was hard again and felt Potter was too. He started stroking him again greedily.
'Thanks Silvia. We have some work in the evening. Perhaps another time.'
'No you stay. I'll drink from the pantry?'
'Why not? All I wanted was a family. Not to be a hero Draco.
But he needed every memory. He needed every story. He needed his one true love. Without those Draco would be an empty man. A soulless man.
'I was having a nightmare of you dying.' Harry hugged him more.
It's when the Time seizes in non existing space in the sealed house hidden from the whole world and Harry has nothing more to say. He unties his neat pony tail running his fingers in the silk and with or without white roses he knows no magic is might but this very moment is, and it is working loud and flawless; his cottony thoughts morph in and out of his mind giving wows and promises to stay imprisoned and locked up, cuffed, in his world.
When Draco woke up, the rain had stopped and the sun was burning the world. Everything was green and shining and smelling fresh. Draco felt so good. His nose had stopped bleeding. His clothes were still wet but he felt clean. He went home.
Harry turned and walked back towards him.
He threw himself at Malfoy who had not been prepared for it that both of them stumbled on the rocky mountain top. Malfoy fell on his back. Harry held his arms over his head pinning him to the ground gazing at his hunger. He looked so supple and mellow under him. That rudeness and cruelty he had performed a while ago was nowhere in his eyes.
The result of the screen absorbed the remaining bit of sense out of his floating life.  He just spent long moments transfixed galring at the beautiful mountains of untouched Amazon and Peru. Where he kissed Draco for the fisrt time. Where they desperately breathlessly kissed each other. Where everything started.
Harry wanted to reach out and stroke his beautiful blond mess but he bit back the desire. He was not sleepy and wanted to say something. Say something nice. Ask something. Or just hold him close. But he held back. Perhaps another time.
So he yearned for him in every passing second in his life; and even when he proposed to Ginny. He hated himself for that but he couldn't control his heart. Throughout the celebration at the dinner table of The Burrow he battled the thought of Draco Malfoy haunting him, that he would walk out to the yard several times, unseen by everybody but Hermione, to smoke in solitude with his voice calling his name in his head. Loud and clear.
Potter smiled, pulled him up and kissed his cheek. He kissed his body, legs and slowly his inner thighs. Draco arched his body inviting him.
She entered the house and glanced everywhere. Every inch was spotless clean. The pantry was gleaming. She walked to their bedroom which was tidy and bed was set, his very many lotions and perfumes were neatly placed with his one or two perfumes and a bottle of cologne was on the dressing table. Their upscale washroom also was the same.
He took Draco there one day to see the beautiful South American sunrise. To where they had kissed each other.
They wouldn't say much to each other.
'Yeah I know I'm beautiful and oh! you are not a girl, you can handle a broken nose.' he said smugly and Harry pulled his hair.
He looked at himself on the mirror one day after weeks.
Harry gapes sideways at him in total bewilderment, the way he indulges in his dream, eyes closed, neck arched, smiling to his own thoughts.
'It is. Take me home!' Draco smiled.
Ron chuckled.
His grey eyes were red. He had produced dark circles around his eyes.
'I did!' Harry raised his eyes in mock astonishment.
He kissed all over Potter, loved how he savoured every touch and kiss Draco gave him. He arched under Draco's body, allowing Draco to reach his every bit. Draco kissed him more and more, kissed his every inch, sucked every toe and every finger. Then he started sucking his cock caressing his thighs and his tight abs. He felt Potter reaching out and running his fingers in Draco's hair gasping softly and moving rhythmically in his mouth. He sucked his cock slow and deep first. Then he held his legs firmly and started sucking him with more preassure. Potter moaned louder and started moving faster and fucking harder in his mouth. He loved how Potter fucked into his mouth breathlessly. He held Draco's hair, started shuddering and jerking getting closer to come. Draco gave him more and more. Finally he came breathing hard on Draco's bed and in Draco's mouth.
It was black and white seven long years back before Potter kissed Draco. Before Draco kissed him back. And then gradually colours invaded life bit by bit. How pathetically he tried to paint it all black and white over what was happening between them. How pathetically he tried to think that he was just having sex, he was fucking Potter, being fucked by him.
Then he cupped Harry's butt and caressed slowly. He planted a wet hungry kiss on each one of the buttocks. Harrry shuddered to his warm tongue, his moist lips and teeth toching his skin. He kissed more amd more to Harry's moaning and gasping. Then held his buttocks properly and parted them and licked. Harry whimpered. He licked again and again and kissed the lips of the entrance intently.
He kissed his hair again. 'We've come a long way since then Drey.'
'Then just stay for awhile. You are tired.'
'Draco!' Mother observed him carefully and said smoothly.
'Why? What did I do?' he exclaimed.
He wouldn't answer. They would just make out which would turn into violent sex and would not discuss anything at all. Even if Harry was worn to the bone they would still make out and have sex.
'Draco, wake up!'
Harry walked towards him and yanked him towards him, 'Look at me!'
He helped Harry and the team to collect the archeological specimens they wanted to take home and advised his team what to do but did not join them to return by the portkey. He ignored Harry and did not bother to thank him for his assistance and simply walked away from everybody.
Harry apparated on Kingsley's instructions with a new portkey at a vast unfamiliar territory deep in Amazon, surrounded by gigantic mountains and rocks. It was three o'clock in the afternoon there. Bright and sunny and covered in lush green. A group of four wizards and three witches were waiting deep in conversation while one of them was watching the beautiful mountain range beyond something Harry could not see.
Narcissa Malfoy and Harry both owned up to the guilt of having performed the blood sacrifical magic at Kingsley's office where he and Draco Malfoy came to a wordless understanding unanimously after exchanging a significant glance. Kingsley disavowed the incident and the file was discarded with the spell book. The curses of high risk potential shall not be dealt with the curse breakers thereafter .
Draco missed the sunrise. He didn't want any sunrise.
'Gee I don't know!' he shrugs looking away, his eyes shutting tight, suppressing something inside of him and swallowing.
'Move on!' he smiled.
Potter always cooked. Draco loved his cooking. Mostly breakfast. But today Draco wasn't hungry. He had to finish the report before 8 o' clock in the morning and hand it over to Kingsley. He used to hate to go to the ministry a week back but now he had trained himself just to ignore them and act normal.
Draco chuckled kissing his back, his hair, massaging  his hard shoulders, hugging him from behind.
But he didn't kiss him on his hair. He shook him gently.
He licked his lips again.
His skin was smooth and the pulse was so low. He gasped but did not pull his hand back. He remained motionless, his fingers brushing against Harry's bare arm.
And then he kissed him on his pale cheek.
'What is it then?' Harry's head was throbbing with pain that he found it very hard to focus. He removed his glasses wiped and wore again rubbing his forehead.
George left and Draco came inside and slept on the sofa.
'Ministry is waiting outside. The magic will try to keep you so it will hurt you a little. I might have to distract you. So please go with the flow. I'm gonna blast all the windows and doors so put your glasses in your pocket!'
'What?' Malfoy snapped again.
His pale face flushed, his gaze hardened but he mastered it so well that Harry really envied his control. He smiled a little, stepped closer towards Harry that they could even feel each other's heat, hear each other breathing in the tropical quietness.
'Mother I...'
Harry grabbed the book and apparated at Ron and Hermione's in the dead of the night.
Then they got dressed went for breakfast as hungry as wolves, Harry made him pancakes to acompany Kreacher's hot muffins. Malfoy read the newspaper while Harry served him pancake and poured him coffee and kissed his uncombed lovely blond mess.
But he'll be back.
He set the bed everyday and slept on the floor. Potter never slept in that bed without Draco. That bed was cold without Potter.
'And I remember you telling me that you had thought that it would be over but it was never over and you knew he was still with you and though it sounded absurd it was the truth.' Draco smoothly said eating his third sandwich.
'Father!'
It was not once or twice he wanted to corner him and tell him to be careful, to avoid risky curses. But Harry was more afraid to influence him, interfere his personal judgement and ruin what they were having. He didn't want to lose him. The bottom line was he thought he didn't have any right.
Malfoy didn't say anything. He just walked a few more steps with Harry and stopped. Then he kissed Harry not bothered by many fancy, trendy uptown men and women watching. He didn't smile. He kissed him hard.
She walked towards Malfoy.
Then Harry started dreaming. The horrendous dream that made him shiver in fear. The dream that did not let him sleep.
'Oh you are irresistible!' he cleaned the table with a casual wave of his wand and took Draco to the sofa and they made out.
It happened the next day too.
Kreacher appears obeying Harry's call bowing low and addressing both of them.
Draco had bought him those. Draco had wanted him to wear leather boots, leather jackets, pullovers, denim trousers to go with his personality. Draco would drag him to Draco's favourite shops and would buy him his favourite fashion brands. Potter didn't have a choice.
He would ask while kissing him. They would suck each other or stroke each other or sometimes Potter would fuck him. Especially if they hadn't had sex the previous night. Potter, with his replenished energy would enjoy him mercilessly.
Potter was not a bad person. He had known it all his life. Potter was actually very nice to him. Despite desperate wild sex Draco knew Potter had treated him very well. His natural kindness and care was all over it.
It was entirely different from Severus Snape's occlumency lesson.
George laughed heartily. 'Figures! Fred loses. I win!' he sighed.
He went to Peru the next day to see the missed sunrise. He disapparated around twelve o' clock and it was the beautiful, colourful, enchanting Amazon sunrise in Peru. He sat where he had kissed him above the dead city of the dead civilization, where death was everywhere, loss was everywhere but smeared with pouring grace and enticement.
'When you were very particular about not wanting a relationship and wouldn' fall asleep in my arms.' he smiled, 'More than once.'
Harry waited till everybody had left. Then Malfoy left ignoring Harry completely. But when Harry went to the elevator he was waiting there reading a notice on the board. He had not pressed the elevator button. They were on the top most floor and the ministry was completely deserted except for them. Harry paused. He thought he should say something.
He came in him jerking hard holding one of Potter's strong arms for support. Then Potter came seconds later in Draco's hand.  Both of them were exhausted. Draco cleaned them and fell on to his body. He felt Potter's fingers in his hair his hands running up and down his body, his mouth is kissing his forehead and settling him between his legs. They fell a sleep.
'Why did it try to lock Dudley?'
Harry answered, 'I can't let you die.'
'Yeah nice try, I'm going to fuck you one way or the other!' He turned him and kissed his back, gringing against him. Harry loved his smooth skin rubbing up against him and his cock, very ready, between his legs. He moaned into the pillow joyously.
It's a howling mistake bringing Draco Malfoy instead of Bill Weasley to get locked up in Dudley Dursley's house. Despite Bill's helping hand Kingsley has pulled Draco out of his holiday in France to make things worse.
Dudley glares at him in disbelief and then turns to Hermione for support or assurance to which Hermione returns a warning look. Harry sits wearing his glasses and looking for his wand and his clothes despite Hermione's plea to stay making Dudley more confused.
Before playing with the refrigerator he placed six wine glasses on the pantry in a perfect line and poured red wine into each one of them with profound practice and artistry as a trained bartender. Then he made the bottle float towards Harry and knocked against his head rousing him from his work.
'You are not tired?'
'Sorry about the house Dudely I'll fix it when he's done with the magic.'
'You think I wanted to let it happen. I don't give a flying fuck of your sick life but he was anyway going to die for you.' Ron yelled back.
Then on a clear Saturday night Harry took him out on a date to a fancy muggle restuarant in London. He seemed enjoyed a lot. Harry asked him if he was happy.
This whole thing started a month back the same way, without much speech.
'We can escape this. But you have to trust me.'
'Do you like living in my house?'
'Did you sleep or you fell asleep?'
'Potter!' he snarled.
You OK Harry?'
'Ok ok... I won't try to kill myself again,  ... now come let's go to bed.'
'Not funny Draco!'
'Harry is not coming back,' he pointed out.
But he still couldn't stand the howling quietness inside the house at night. He thought the house was screaming or crying of unending agony. He preferred staying outside.
'Let's go home. Let's just go home. I want to be with you.'
The dusk was painting the whole place with vibrant vigourous colours and the rays of colours have fallen on them too. Harry slowly let his hand go which made him return the gaze. His face was glowing beautifully in the gloden light of the setting sun. His sleek hair, now a floppy mess shining in wicked gold. His eyes dark and big and flames dancing in them as they looked at Harry. His gaze wandered from Harry's forehead, to eyes to his lips and back to his eyes with his rosy lips moist and lush.
He started eating the sandwiches hungrily. 'Your mum made this?'
He refused dinner and lunch invitations and stayed at home. He went to work, drank cappuccino or coffee, ate from here and there and came home. He finished his work, cleaned, sat on the floor, and stared into nothingness.
He fucked Harry silently and with their eyes open gazing at each other, his hand stroking Harry's cock. They fucked longer and deeper and more pain and more joy and more orgasm.
Day 5-
Harry watched Malfoy jumped back in alarm. He saw his hesitation. Then he turned and looked at Harry.
He has built his walls perfectly. Harry didn't know if he was happy or not but he clearly didn't let anyone enter his fortress.
'My treasure chest.' he winked at him.
How could Draco ever give up on him?
In the morning before Potter left for the mission he kissed Draco thoroughly and said,
She held her son and Harry and told Hermione to take Ron to Malfor Manor and disapparated. She gave Harry, Ron and Malfoy a red drink and Hermione some herbal tea.
He seems cracking under pressure.
It wasn't over. It was getting worse. He was burning for him more and more.
Magic wakes up, screams in agony the force trying to part them. He gasps in pain wraps his legs around Harry holding on, clinging, against the force, shaking violently.
'I have to. She needs help with this issue.' Harry yelled too.
He turned his head and smiled at Harry sweetly closed his eyes and rested against his body. He didn't respond to Harry's call. Harry called him again and again but he remained motionless in his arms.
'Wait why can't we go with him?'
The elevator door closed and started moving down.
Mother came and beamed at the sight him.
'Draco, I'm your mother. Now may I come in?'
He didn't answer.
'What's so funny?' Malfoy frowned.
They knew they were worn out and decided to continue the sweet argument later and went to bed but ended up grinding against each other and undressing each other.
Draco squinted, 'And why would I do that?'
He wanted to go home. He couldn't stay at Malfoy Manor. He wanted to be with him. He would come bcak. He wanted to sleep in their bed. Breakfast. He would pour him a cappuccino, make pancakes.
'Why don't you come live with us for a few days?' She invited softly looking at the clothes he was wearing since yesterday evening.
All three came in five minutes time. Harry explained what happened briefly to which Narcissa squinted a little and nodded as though understood.
Later in the morning he knocked on the door of Dudley's room when Harry was getting dressed, entered before he had answered with two mugs of steaming coffee. Harry, who was half naked blatantly looked up for the unspeakable astonishment but in he cooly swaggered.
Malfoy turned as though asking for candy for his good job. Harry gave him what he wanted.
George walked towards them with a pleasant smile that Harry smiled delighted totally forgotten his dismay. George spoke with Harry in his usual cheerful manner and looked over Harry's shoulder to address Malfoy for Harry's utter astonishment. Harry turned to see him grimace but he was mild.
Two days later when Harry saw him in the ministry he ignored him as usual. He had come to see Kingsley. Yet at the end of the day just before leaving they caught each other's gaze. They spent a few seconds trapped in it. And then Malfoy walked away towards the deserted staircase avoiding the elevator and Harry followed him.
'How are you holding up?'
Went to see Hermione and Ron and thanked for coming to see him, taking him out for lunch and dinner. Came home and fell asleep on the bedroom floor.
He smiled sweetly. Harry observed the smile. It was soft and genuine. But he didn't thank him. He poured Harry a drink from a bottle he got from the cupboard and examined the files. He signed an already written parchment and gave it to Harry.
He drank more water and massaged his head. His head was going to burst into a million pieces and Draco thought what would mother say about the bits of flesh and blood and bones all over the room if his head burst. Potter would definitely scold him for being an attention seeking prat or whatever he could come up with but would hug him anyway.
'I don't know. He goes here and there!' Facing him directly Harry leans against an armchair with his arms crossed eyeing his recovered details along with his usual details; which are, neat clothing, the black blazer with a mat sheen over the vicuna pullover and black shoes shining. Hair silky silver blond, combed and tied to a very neat pony tail.
Draco looks at his blazing stony face confused to the utmost, lips apart in astonishment drops the roll of parchment with a soft thud on the carpet. He gasps as Harry steps closer and closer, shuts his eyes as his steel hands cups his face.
Though Kingsley and the head of the auror division wanted to take him to St Mungo, Mrs Malfoy point blankly refused.
But the colours won.
And tomorrow they will be incomplete without each other, will be half a beating heart, half a blue sky, and half a breath intake. Yet, since he belonged to him, as they had always been, before they had even known what loving was; he loved him tonight, from every bit of him.
He would apparate. Hug him. Kiss him. Scold him for smoking. Sex even if he was so tired, and fall asleep. Wake up and fall in love againg.
He nods obeying stepping completely in to his arms.
Their new house was in London and Malfoy chose it for it's beautiful yard and the picket fence. Their bedroom was spacious with a huge walk in closet, an upscale attached bathroom which Harry said not necessary but he let Malfoy win.
'How obnoxious of me!'
Then he gains his memory. Looking into his grey eyes. A comfortable overrated silence. An unknown scene of him and him in an embrace, not a memory not a dream, a deep secret cherished for ages in the pit of the mind playing live.  A wedding ring, White roses and a kiss he never had, flashing; and he is wandering in his mind picking the clandestine cuffed desires in that borrowed crucial moment.
'Why?'
It's the fourth day passing mounting agitation and distress. Moreover, he appears terminally bored.
Harry freezes. A thick breathless strained silence. Seconds turn to minutes, coffee cup empty.
Draco woke up.
'But the kid next door said I looked gorgeous in his clothes.' he looked at the black sweatshirt he was wearing which he had bought Potter sometime back.
Draco didn't say anything. He gazed into his beautiful green eyes shining brightly at him. He pushed back his black curls with both his hands and kissed his scar and all over his forehead.
'Cancelled special officer Draco Malfoy's duty on my request.
'Why can't he come back?' Harry's voice is calmer and smoother and inhales the direct result of his nasty habit patiently.
Draco nodded. He waited till Potter take the lube and settled between his legs. Potter caressed the hole and slowly entered his finger. Draco moaned when he felt his finger in and the other hand around his aching cock working wonderfully.
Malfoy flipped them, placed his whole body on Harry, caged his head between his hands resting on elbows. He pressed his crotch against Harry's and started grinding while he returned the kiss. Harry felt his long smooth fingers in his hair, lost, entangled in his black mess and smooth fingertips running slowly on his scalp. Time to time Harry stopped kissing and let himself drift into that beautiful sensation in his hair. Sensing that, then Malfoy caressed him more and more while kissing him soft and light. Harry fondled him back, running his hands down the back of his long neck, his shoulder blades, down his back between kisses and pulled him closer again and again whenever he stopped kissing. Malfoy kissed back without a protest. Harry knew he was plainly giving whatever Harry wanted. So Harry asked for more, and accepted and simply adored the blissful moment. They kissed until the sun disappeared behind the rocks leaving a beautiful mess of colours in the sky. Malfoy stood up when Harry did not pull him towards him anymore to kiss, snatched his wand and his cloak and his bag and disapparated without even looking at Harry.
'Because they are your family!'
Draco laughed, 'What's the difference?'
'Are you threatening me Malfoy?' Harry asked in a low dangereous tone.
He gives an odd stare at the owner of the elf. 'Fine! You go! I have to stay anyway...!'
'But I have a home!' he said very calmly and walked out.
'I won't let the healers mess with my son. Besides they know nothing about these,' she conjured a bed and placed him in it and took him out of the entrance to disapparate. Harry helped her and went back to Kingsley, excused him and fetched Malfoy's tool kit and apparated at Malfoy Manor.
When he entered the living room Father looked up from his book and beamed happpily. Draco walked towards him and stroked his hair and kissed his forehead.
'Dudley thinks you are my boyfriend.'
'Why didn't you tell me?' Malfoy brushed off his curls.
'This is so you,' Harry admired, 'You the neat freak, the clean freak, stylish, trendy fashion modle kind of. You need everything in order. You can't adapt to change.'
He spins his wand on Aunt Petunia's gleaming kitchen table staring at it with a duck face. Third spin ends pointing the wand tip at the refrigerator.He gives it a casual wave and the door opens revealing tinned muggle food, milk cartons and dairy products he knows nothing of. Then he points it at several things in the kitchen lifting them, replacing them and opening and closing drawers.
In his very neat black and white bedroom where not even a single item of his many bottles of lotion or colonge or perfume or hair care products was out of place on his dressing table, where two books, a glass of water, an alarm clock and a fountain pen was perfectly placed on his bedside table.
'Potter this!'
'Shut up!'
'Don't!' he snapped quietly. 'Just don't....!' he looked up at Harry with his swollen eyes and blinked, 'I've always wanted....,' he stopped. Shook his head and looked away. Then he looked back and uttered quietly, 'I've felt everything for you.... and it's wasted...!'
He had always waited for him.
They wouldn't say anything to each other. Not even a greeting.
Harry's heart sank.
He gasps in terror. 'It's alright. I don't want the house. Your boyfriend can have it to work on the curse.'
Several times he looked at Harry and quickly looked away. When the class was taking notes Harry was sure he stole long moments to stare at him.
So one of the days he decided to say something to him and waited to hear his footsteps. When he had finished signing Harry took a deep breath softly to speak.
Bliss.....
But they wouldn't say something, anything. They simply gave everything each other wanted. And even after these steamy violent love making, Malfoy didn't cuddle. Harry didn't bother him either. They would just sleep side by side.
He gestured Harry to stand near the window facing him.
They kissed, Malfoy on top of Harry grinding their hard cocks agaisnt each other, stroking and sucking, they flipped, kissed more, more skin, more sucking, and more stroking, they came in each other's hands gasping for air tightly wrapped in each other. They didn't bother to clean and stayed with wet all over them.
