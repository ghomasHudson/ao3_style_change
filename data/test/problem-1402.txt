The two men descended the stairs in silence and didn’t make eye contact until they were back in the kitchen.
people to be over it. The only reason all of these girls want me is because they think I’m some sort of hero. I don’t want that. I want someone who wants me
The one he wasn’t prepared for was Draco. He wrote to him like he said he would. He told him how everyone responded and even threw in a “Don’t worry, no one else was outed in the meantime”.
catch was when Dumbledore explained the staffing changes for the year. “As you can see from our table here, we have a new face joining us. Please join me in welcoming an alumnus back to Hogwarts. After his successful career with Puddlemere United, Oliver Wood has decided to come back as an apprentice to Madame Hooch. Professor Hooch will be retiring after this year and is looking to train Mr. Wood as her replacement. Now, while Mr. Wood is not a professor…yet. He should be treated with the same respect.” At that Dumbledore smiled over to the man at the far end of the table who stood up and gave a small wave.
“What? No. I’m not with Oliver.” Harry knew his tone was harsh, but he was very busy. He needed to get this work done so he could go to meet-up with Draco.
here.” Draco could hear the disapproving tone in Seamus’ voice. Dean just stood there looking rather uncomfortable and moving his eyes around the Great Hall.
“It’s a little more complicated than that. We wanted different things…” Draco left Harry’s gaze and moved towards the counter-top “Or rather… the same thing really”.
Draco looked up in complete confusion, “Lost Granger?” Draco’s eyebrows shot up as he spoke, and he pushed for his voice to
Once Charlie arrived, everyone crowded around him. Hugs and cheek kisses were given as well as a lot of “how are the dragons treating ya?”. Charlie took it all in stride until he saw Harry. He looked at Harry and quickly his eyes caught Draco.
“I needed to see you, to talk with you.” Harry rushed the words out of his mouth as fast as he could.
Another month went by. Another month and no word from Astoria or her lawyer. Draco was just as anxious as before, but Harry also noticed the man was different…sadder and less sure of himself. Harry watched as Draco began to question his own parenting abilities and was growing anxious about letting Scorpius out of his sight. It broke Harry’s heart to watch this happen and he just kept wishing she would come around and say
“Harry, we were sympathetic about you coming out because we understood that was a big step for you. But we aren’t going to sit around while you make yourself (and your parents) miserable. So tell us, what happened?”
Draco looked at his mother. Harry knew Draco loved his mother dearly. He didn’t fear her like he did his father, but he also knew his mother rarely disobeyed her husband – and promoted Draco to do the same.
Harry didn’t have long to wonder before Draco ushered him over to their table. Harry tried to hide his surprise as Draco stood up from the table and greeted Harry with a hug before sitting back down. It seemed like such a ‘date’ thing to do.
“Your most inventive yet my boy! Always keeping me on my toes!” The wizard behind the counter flicked his wand to begin the concoction. And a large cone of ice cream – topped with all of Teddy’s favorites appeared in front of him. He watched the ice cream carefully as his godfather paid and they began to exit the shop.
Draco definitely received the worst of it. Similarly, Draco had impressive wards around the Manor that blocked anything from getting through, but the packages and letters left for him were far more violent. Harry also called Ron for these and the aurors would come and inspect, but none of the packages or letters could ever be traced back to anyone – so they had to let it go.
Two weeks after the incident with Draco, Harry and Oliver were walking back to the castle after a rather late night of training. They had started a discussion about the upcoming winter holiday and Harry had asked, “What are you plans? Going to Scotland to see your parents?”
Draco woke up the next morning to a silent dorm. As soon as his eyes opened and his brain could register what was happening, a smile crept upon his face. He was alone. And could do whatever he wanted.
Draco can remember the exact moment Voldemort entered his home. Draco was in his room when he heard whispers coming from downstairs. He moved to stand at the top of the staircase to have a better view of the entry way to the Manor. That’s when he saw…it.
. They were his father’s best friends from Hogwarts and loved Harry as their own. Sirius and Remus took the role of “godfather” very seriously. They felt it was their duty to show Harry all the amazing things about being a wizard that his parents wouldn’t allow him to see.
Oliver moved to turn Harry around and started kissing his neck and reaching for the waistband of his shorts. But right as a finger was hooked into the band, Harry heard Oliver let out a loud groan and hit the wall beside Harry’s head. Before he knew it, all of the heat from his back was gone.
Harry could hear the tone in Draco’s voice change at the mention of his father. He wasn’t sure if the man was finished or not, so he decided to remain silent just in case.
Draco quickly noticed the crowd that was gathering around them and grabbed Harry by the arm and threw him into an empty nearby classroom.
“No…what Ginny?” Ron must have also sensed the tone in his sister’s voice because he sounded like he didn’t want to hear this rumor.
“Well, I didn’t kill a muggle for it, if that’s what you’re implying.” Draco barked back and felt foolish afterwards. Harry didn’t even
Other memories were almost too much to handle. The feeling of fiendfyre surrounding and suffocating him before a strong hand reached out to grab him. The feeling of pressing up against the back of his savior and the loss of the pressure as he tumbled down to the ground outside the Room of Requirement. Or watching a lifeless Harry Potter being carried toward the castle by Hagrid and feeling as though everything was over…and everything was ruined. The feeling of winning the war, but actually losing.
“I’m sorry Harry, but Ron’s right. You’ve been staring at him quite a bit since we returned. I mean, every girl in school (and several guys) have noticed the change in him, but you really have to hide it better.”
Harry wondered if these people would have given him the same welcome, bonded with him over the same topics. Draco and Oliver were very similar – both valued their schooling and took great care to make their families proud. Both men loved Quidditch and excelled at it. And both men took care of Harry…or at least
With thoughts of Draco still swirling in his head after his rather explicit dream, Harry thought about indulging himself. But his mind seemed to be at war with his body. His body knew what is wanted – obviously. The dream had made is quite sure of what it wanted. But his head couldn’t wrap itself around it.
Harry’s goal for the second term was to integrate Draco into his life with Hermione and Ron. The first time Draco ate with them in Hogsmeade…things were awkward. Nobody knew what to say.
“I see…” was all James could say. He agreed with his son’s actions, but he knew he couldn’t say that. He didn’t want to condone his son engaging in violence. When he looked at his son, he could see tears swelling in his eyes.
“Well, his maternal grandmother is quite keen on telling him bedtime stories. And she often…shows him pictures of the…people she is describing.” Harry was stunned. He was a child’s bedtime story?
“Draco, I feel…terrible. Have you ever had something like this happen?” Harry looked up at him and Draco couldn’t help but think how small Harry looked like this. The man who defeated Voldemort was currently hiding under his blankets, crying, because some large ginger man broke his heart. Draco couldn’t believe it.
“Actually, they’re traveling this year. So it looks like, for the first time in my time here at Hogwarts, I’ll be part of the stay-back group.” Harry couldn’t help but hear the sadness in his voice.
Draco rolled his eyes and stuffed his pillow over his head in an attempt to block out the dark-haired man. But the pillow didn’t stop the man from seeping into his dreams.
Draco learned a lot in his first week of classes. He learned people still hated him – it didn’t matter what the Chosen One said at his trial – Draco Malfoy was a Death Eater. And to some people, that’s all that mattered. But he learned that if he didn’t
Draco ate breakfast with the Trio (plus Ginny) and actually didn’t hate it. He hadn’t realized how much he was
with a dark wizard.” Draco didn’t mean for this conversation to take such a dark turn, but here we are.
Harry felt jealousy rising up inside him and quickly realized he was jealous of his best mate’s sister. She got to kiss Dean. She got to make him smile like that. And when they finished kissing, Dean didn’t pull back in shock or disgust or anger. He kept smiling…
“The first year or so was difficult. Astoria kept coming in and out of Scorpius and my life, almost as if she couldn’t decide what she wanted to do. She would come, stick around for a few weeks, then disappear again. It was getting to be a lot for me. I eventually told her, ‘you either want to be here or you don’t, make a decision’. She left the next day and never came back…well, until now I guess.” Harry was still shocked the woman was here at all.
It turns out Harry was fairly eager to explore this new side of him. Harry learned quickly and was always ready to keep going wherever Charlie led him.
“It’s Drake when we are in town! And yes, how else do you expect me to get all of this home? And also, keep your voice down!” He quipped back at Harry who went back to silence.
Draco debated with himself for what felt like several minutes. No one had been in his house, and now here Harry was, trying to stay over? What was he playing at? Was he going to kidnap Draco in the middle of the night?
, but I meant it in all ways – physically, mentally, and emotionally. I will always check on you Harry.”
godfather) has told me all about your father. How shite he was in school and how he never fought for anything in his life. Just ran away. When the dark lord returned, what did James Potter do? He ran.”
. No, this doesn’t mean Scorpius is your brother. Yes, Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron know (as of a very brief conversation at their house when he went to pick up Teddy).
“Don’t go getting soft on me too Potter. You’re drunk and imagining things. It’s time I take you home…which is where exactly?”
The two fell into natural conversation, just like they always do. Bouncing from work, to family, to quidditch and back around. Harry is still amazed they have things to talk about.
when can we go to another Chudley Canons match? I want to wear the new jersey I got from Uncle Ron at Christmas!” Scorpius was smiling up at Harry who couldn’t help but glance at Draco who had just rolled his eyes. He still hated that Scorpius was a Canons fan.
Oliver walked with Harry as he continued down to the pitch. Harry tried to let out a laugh, “Right… Um…So, I didn’t know you’d be coming back. Must be weird being here…especially after you thought you’d gotten out.”
“Wait – four years, but Scorpius is five…almost six.” Harry just now pieced that together and it looked like the mere mention of it was frustrating to Draco.
Harry followed Draco out of the room and headed towards the door. Before he left, Harry couldn’t resist. “So, you’ve been talking to your mum about me I see.”
“Not that world, Potter! The wizarding world! I live on a muggle farm! I don’t use magic! I raise goats for fuck’s sake! That isn’t my world! No one in the wizarding world needs me for anything, Potter. As evident by the fact that literally no one has bothered to look for me for the past two years.” The rain was pouring harder and harder and Draco noticed that Harry was inching closer and closer towards him as he spoke. “Oh – right, until Precious Harry Potter comes looking for me. But that’s because he bloody needs me to play detective and help him solve his pitiful case!”
“As nice as that all is Mr. Potter, Draco is a pureblood – he has an obligation to this family. We have already made arrangements with the Greengrass family. Draco
“Draco, we can continue this conversation tomorrow if you’d like.” Draco nodded. It was all just a bit much to take in. Harry got up and started to make his way towards the door.
Harry doesn’t seem to have spotted Draco yet, but instead seems to be looking around in utter confusion.
is what they were talking about and shot back quick. “And this is besides the point, what the hell Draco? What’s going on?”
He still walked around with a strong sense of arrogance and pride. His dress robes for the dance were immaculate. Harry looked at them and
Ron blinked and raised his eyebrows before answering, “Uh…yeah. Sure.” Then looked back at Hermione.
But once the dust settled and he found a routine at the Burrow, he did try dating. He tried to go out and meet girls, but nothing felt right. He chalked it up to feelings from the war or knowing he had a kid at home to take care of, but part of him also knew he wasn’t living his true self. He still liked women and found them attractive, but there was something nagging inside of himself. Something that kept making his eyes drift away from the women in the bar and towards their boyfriends/husbands. Something that made him want to date men…
“I see…so, your plan was to what, exactly? Take our son back to Scotland? Start a new family?” Astoria’s face signaled that that was exactly what she was planning to do.
“That’s not the point Seamus. And besides, that’s an offensive word. I think we’re all just…surprised is all.” Harry couldn’t believe his ears. Dean had just defended Draco and reprimanded his best friend in the meantime. He looked at Harry again and gave a small smile. Harry had no idea what to do in return.
James and Lily Potter were strong and determined to fight. But soon, Voldemort heard of a prophecy in which a certain infant would need to die in order for Voldemort to continue his reign. Lily and James went into hiding to protect their son, but a friend of the Potter’s quickly revealed their hiding place and were thereby easy targets for Voldemort to find. He entered their home in Godric’s Hollow on October 31
Draco figured his mother must be grieving the loss of his father and decided to let her be. But this meant more time
“Draco. Do you know how much I’m talked about already? By students, professors, random people I don’t know? And don’t even get me started on the Prophet…they’d talk about me even if I didn’t do anything at all. I’ve actually already thought about all of this. I may be impulsive, but I’ve been gone for a couple of weeks now – I’ve had time.” Harry smiled and Draco couldn’t help but return it.
for a while now, and the serum will allow us to get the truth. Once we have the truth, we can fix it – the Malfoy name is too important for any
fond memories. He remembers sitting in Malfoy Manor’s beautiful and grand library, with his father reading books to him about the rich history and lineage of the Malfoy name. Looking at his son and saying, “You are to carry on and uphold our name, son. You are my only heir; the duty lies with you.” And Draco remembers feeling proud about that – a sense of honor.
“You don’t give him to her, that’s what! Fuck her! Scorpius is your son!” Why wasn’t Draco angrier about this?
“Draco! Listen to me. We need to talk. Just…” Harry was running to catch up to him and when he did, grabbed his forearm. “Just stop.” Harry was out of breath from trying to keep up with the man and Draco felt oddly proud about that.
Harry tried to use work to keep his brain occupied, but Christmas came quicker than Harry had anticipated. Harry had grown to truly love Christmas these past 9 years. It was the holiday that made him truly feel part of the Weasley family – every year he opened up that sweater with the big H on it, he felt at home.
This didn’t feel like the same Draco who had told Harry he loved him just three months prior. Or the one who laid on top of him that night in the astronomy tower. Harry felt like he didn’t know this Draco…
Harry smiled before mirroring Draco’s position. Draco looked beautiful like this. His body was lean but muscular and his white skin seemed to melt into his satin white sheets. Now that he didn’t have a gorgeous man attacking his mouth, he could give the room a proper look.
After the night in the bathroom, Harry and Draco resumed their routine meetups in the astronomy tower. They needed to discuss their plan of action for how to get Draco out of this marriage.
“I-I don’t know…” Harry grew quiet and looked off towards the wall. “It’s nothing. Have you…have you told anyone else?”
“After this morning, I thought for sure you would never come back up here.” Draco’s eyes fell on Harry.
Draco saw the way Harry’s face changed quickly into anger, “Ah! Why are you still such an arsehole?” and just like that,
Charlie looked at Draco with a fierce look in his eye. “And who on Earth do you think you are? Why are you at
Once out, Draco could feel the way Harry was staring at him. It was almost as if he was studying him or waiting for him to do something, say something, or… something.
“Right, well, I think we both have enough to apologize for, so let’s just put this behind us, eh?” Charlie gave a small smile that Harry returned. Before Harry could walk away, Charlie continued “Look. I don’t know what happened with you and Draco, but I do know that while I may have been your first love, I certainly won’t be your last. You’ll find someone to love who will love you back. I hope you can forgive me…for everything”.
“What’s there to figure out Harry? I’m getting married. That’s that. My father will never allow us to be together. I have to do this…”
“Don’t ask Harry those questions, Scorpius.” Draco sounded like he was trying to snap at Scorpius, but the bite wasn’t there.
The Manor was tainted. Draco couldn’t even imagine putting up a Christmas tree in that house now. What would there be to celebrate exactly? The people that had been tortured and held captive there? No, I think not.
at you. Well, except maybe Charlie and even then, I think he’s more hurt than mad. Everyone is just concerned. Ron is upset as to why you didn’t tell him and I think Ginny is surprisingly happy to hear that you’re…well…”.
When they all returned from a trip to Hogsmeade and entered the common room, Hermione waited for the rest of Gryffindor house to make their way to their dorms before gently asking her friend to talk.
One week in and Harry was loving his new job. The program was new so a lot of it involved setting up systems and ironing out roles, but once all of the logistics were taken care of, Harry got to help actual people. Harry also liked this role because it meant dealing with muggle-borns, many of which had families who had never heard of him before.  The anonymity was refreshing.
“It’s not so bad. We really weren’t meant to be. He went to Durmstrang and was essentially molded into a professional Quidditch player from the age of like 8. He thought brawn was better than brains. And don’t get me wrong, brawn is really
Was he slightly irritated? Yes. But honestly, he was relieved. Like Ron said, it was bound to happen eventually, and it just so happens, it happened now.
“Yeah, see, they come in all hurt and wounded. I fix them up and they fall madly in love with their savior.” Draco pretended to faint onto the booth and Harry quickly realized he was joking.
“Mr. Potter…I love your son. Very much. I’ve loved him for a very long time. Longer than he probably knows. I already thought I lost him once…I don’t plan on that happening ever again.” That’s all it took for Lily. She moved out of her seat at the Three Broomsticks where they were having lunch and gave Draco a big hug. Draco hesitated before returning.
As soon as he stepped on the train, he searched for Draco but couldn’t find him anywhere. When students began to walk into Hogwarts, Harry looked around for that familiar blonde head. He spotted Draco far off in the distance talking with Crabbe and Goyle. Harry ran up to him, but as soon as Draco saw him Draco looked away and walked off. Harry stood in front of the castle confused.
“I need to borrow your owl…and some parchment…and a quill…” Harry was looking around as if these things could be found near him.
“I’m so sorry Draco…that must have been terrible for you.” Harry was in shock. He understood Draco. The desire to live the life you want while others are telling you how they think you should live it. It’s suffocating.
Harry left Defense frustrated. After the incident in class, he didn’t even want to talk to Draco anymore. That’s not entirely true, he did. He really did. But after his outburst, he couldn’t risk being seen trying to talk with him.
As if he could read his mind, Draco opened his mouth to speak. “Harry, I do love you. I’ve loved you for a while now. But like I said, I won’t be a second choice. I respect myself too much to allow myself to be with someone who only loves me because the person he truly wants doesn’t love him.”
After the shop, the two made their way towards the Leaky Cauldron. Harry pretended not to notice the stares and whispers happening around them and instead chose to focus on the man next to him. They quickly found a booth towards the back (per Harry’s request – he was still the topic of the Daily Prophet more times than he cared to discuss).
“I said no such thing. I kept pushing him to find his own person…his own happiness. And, selfishly, I hoped he would find it when he was here – at home. But I know now, though I wish I would have learned it sooner, that Charlie is happy. He doesn’t desire the same things in life as his father and I did.”
By November Harry was starting to feel like his old self. He found himself more focused on his classes and with the help of Oliver, more focused on Quidditch. By now, he knew Oliver was out-right flirting with him. Oliver wasn’t shy about it and Harry liked that. Oliver seemed to know exactly what he wanted. Harry.
“Draco…why did you leave…?” Draco forgot for a moment where they were and broke away from the green eyes staring at him.
Seamus leaned over to kiss Dean – the kiss wasn’t obscene, but Draco definitely felt that if McGonagall saw, she wouldn’t think they were just
“You were going to leave your son…?” Harry tried to hide the judgement in his voice, but he knew it was coming out. As much as Teddy was unexpected and difficult in the beginning, he would never think of leaving him or giving him up.
“So sorry to take so long Leona – thank you for being able to watch Scorpius while mother is out.” He kissed the woman on her cheek before turning his attention to Harry. “There was a somewhat emergency at the office, it appears the potion we’ve been brewing for three days began smoking and a fire erupted. I told those half-wits to stir it once every half hour, twice every hour, and to give a half turn every quarter of an hour – but alas, they couldn’t even get that right.” Draco looked flushed as he stopped speaking.
Harry and Dean had been hanging out quite a bit that year. After his talk with Hermione, Harry allowed himself to enjoy his time with Dean. He also allowed himself to think there might be a possibility Dean could like him too. Dean always wanted to be around Harry, he never said “no” when Harry suggested they hang out. He always sat really close to Harry during meals and would engage in really deep conversations late at night in the common room.
“I want to date you!” Harry looked at Draco like this should be obvious. “That’s what people do when they like each other. Like Dean and Seamus.”
The two drank their drink in silence, both feeling the tension in the room of a quiet, child-free house and the reminder of what happened the last time they were alone together.
“Harry, let me finish. You’re…you. You’re part of my family. And so, even if it was something I wanted, I couldn’t be with you like you want me to. I’m sorry.”
If Draco hadn’t been so caught up in his thoughts, he probably would have heard a knock at the door. And if Draco hadn’t been in such a hurry to indulge himself, he would have probably remembered to lock the door…
“I know you aren’t a death eater anymore. I know you probably never truly were…” Draco rolled his eyes at whatever pity Harry was about to throw at him.
Harry wanted to change the subject, quickly. “Why are you coming to watch a whole bunch of second years tryout? It’s a Friday night…don’t you have better things to do? Shouldn’t you be taking some girl out to Hogsmeade or drinking in a pub with your Quidditch mates?”
Draco’s eyes moved from Oliver and right on Harry. “What do you care? You know, I came to talk to you – congratulate you for your win, but I see you have someone to do that for you.” Harry noticed the hurt behind Draco’s words.
“She said that I probably didn’t want to use lawyers because I would never find one to represent me anyway. Who would want to represent a former Death Eater?” Draco grew quiet at the last words.
Draco stopped mid-way towards the barn and turned towards Harry, attempting to disregard the rain. “I see. And why on earth do you think I would have any information about this, Potter?! I’m a free man. I did some shit during the war, but I haven’t talked nor seen that man in over two years.” Draco’s voice grew louder and louder the more he spoke.
They came back to the dorm and went into their respective dorms with a quick discussion on needing to do homework and take a shower.
“Um…no. I heard crying and thought I would come to check…on you. Draco, are you okay?” Harry couldn’t bring himself to speak above a whisper on the last sentence.
Draco’s fourth year at Hogwarts had been…eventful, to say the least. The TriWizard Tournament brought out a lot of emotions from the students at Hogwarts, and even if Draco hid his well – they still existed, somewhere under the surface.
Draco sat in silence, a sudden spark of confidence come across his face, then he looked up to meet Harry’s eyes. “Harry, I like you.”
Harry dressed alongside Draco, “I’m coming with you.” Draco rolled his eyes, but Harry could see a small smile on his face.
talked about it. Draco talked about healing the way Hermione talked about books, but unlike with Hermione, Harry found himself listening. Also unlike with Hermione, he found himself looking at the way Draco’s face and mouth moved as he spoke.
So much had changed. Hermione had also decided to move into the Burrow, but after a month she said that it was time to find her own family. She went to Australia and found her parents and began the process of bringing back their memories. This process would be longer and more difficult than she had anticipated. She decided to live at the Burrow and make frequent trips to, as she called it “continue the process”. Often, she went alone, but sometimes Ron would accompany her (when he could get time away from training).
He sprinted around the Manor and began to pack a bag, but suddenly stopped himself. He didn’t need these
He found Draco in the hallway outside of Charms. He ran up to him and without thinking threw him up against the wall.
But an addendum to the letter came exactly two weeks later that was specific to only Draco. It discussed the new rooming situation for eighth years – a separate dormitory, away from the other houses. It included the rationale that they were now too old to live with younger students and it was proper that they were given autonomy with their age. The separate dorm would have fewer students and all of the Slytherins in his year had expressed they would not be returning. The dorms would be two students to a room, but Draco would be given his own room.
He looked at his father and suddenly felt very nervous. As his mother began to release him, his father stood up and started walking towards him. The two made eye contact and Harry let out a quiet, “Dad?” before he too was wrapping his arms around his son.
That’s why when mid-March came around and Charlie pulled Harry into his room in the middle of the day, Harry knew something was wrong. One look at Charlie and he knew whatever Charlie was about to say wasn’t going to be good. Charlie never pulled Harry in during the day, especially when people were home and walking all over the Burrow.
Harry listened as Teddy started talking Scorpius’ ear off while leaving back towards the playroom, “Yeah – Rose is really small. Like a baby! And Uncle Ron has this really cool quidditch broom, it’s like yours, but real! Like…not a toy or anything. Aunt Hermione has a
But he also knew, it was the right step. He wanted to get back to magic, to his family, to his friends…to Harry.
He dressed himself and went down the steps of Malfoy Manor. He noticed the house was silent – so his mother must already be asleep. As he entered the library, he saw two armchairs sitting across from one another and in front of a roaring fire. He stared at the seats before hearing his father’s voice, “Sit Draco. We are going to have a little talk.”
“Draco! Listen to me!” Draco rolled his eyes once more and found Harry was still following him up to his door. He stopped just short of the porch and looked around at the house. “Is this…is this where you live?”
When everyone at the table shook their heads, Ginny continued, “Yeah, I heard from someone on the Ravenclaw team that Draco Malfoy’s been DUMPED.” Harry couldn’t help but wonder if that’s why Draco had been so upset the past few weeks. Maybe he and Pansy had been on the rocks for a while.
“Daddy! Daddy!” the hug was interrupted by Scorpius and Teddy running into the kitchen. Harry released the man and stood off to the side while Draco wiped tears away from his eyes, “Can Teddy spend the night? Pleaseeeeee.”
Harry Potter spoke for him. He talked about how they were both just children when the war started and how the consequences of a parent shouldn’t trickle down to their child. He spoke of Vincent Crabbe conjuring the fiendfyre, not Draco. And he spoke on how Draco couldn’t kill Dumbledore – apparently Harry was there that night in the astronomy tower and witnessed the entire scene.
time in selecting just the right flavors always warmed Harry’s heart. He knew – whatever the boy wanted Harry would get him.
Apparently, Teddy had a nightmare and didn’t want to wake up Harry. Draco heard him crying from down the hall and went to check on him. That’s when he got him out of bed with the promise of hot chocolate and they sat at the table together. Teddy apparently didn’t want to talk about it but sat in silence with Draco. Draco noticed him getting sleepy at the table, picked him up to take him to his room and found he was already asleep in his arms before they even got there.
. If that’s what you’re asking.”  Harry didn’t like the way she said ‘details’, but also knew exactly what she was referring to.
Harry smirked and relaxed a bit. Of course Draco had thought this through. But just as quickly as his anxiety faded, it came back – now he had to be nervous for the next five days in anticipation of this… ‘date’.
As a child, he loved his father dearly – even if he doesn’t remember ever being hugged or kissed or praised, he does hold
Harry fell asleep that night with thoughts of blonde hair dancing in his brain and was awoken at 6 the next morning to taps at his window. A rather posh looking bird stood outside nearly tapping its foot in impatience before Harry opened the window and took the letter. The bird stood still, and Harry figured the letter needed a reply.
“No, I get that now. Charlie said that too. But…I did feel something…about it. I’ve been feeling something for a while. Um, I’ve actually felt stuff in the past too. Like you mentioned that night by the fire…”
the box. When Harry had first heard about this, he was sold immediately. He could bring Teddy to watch quidditch matches, enjoy themselves, and be hassled by
What in the hell was Draco Malfoy doing here? Charlie had been thinking about Harry a lot over the past few months and had a lot he wanted to say. He decided to clear the air now so he could enjoy the rest of his visit.
But just as he smiled, he could feel his face drop. He and Harry needed to talk. Amidst all of his thoughts last night, and after thinking about his father and the letter, it became increasingly clear that it wasn’t safe for him and Harry to be public yet. He needed to get the mess with his father sorted out first, make sure Harry wasn’t in any danger, and then they could be whatever Harry wanted them to be. But having that conversation, without telling Harry about the letter, was going to be difficult.
Harry hesitated. He couldn’t tell his friend what was going on with Draco. They’d try and stop him. They’d tell him it was a bad idea and to just move on. So, he lied.
Two weeks after the incident and one week before they were set to head home, Harry was honestly feeling better. He and Dean had not spoken since that night and Harry kept having to force himself to not look at the boy. He didn’t realize how much he had done it before.
Harry and Teddy arrive at the Manor for a play-date and learn a little bit more about what's happened with Draco since the war.
“It’s fine. I didn’t listen to it anyway. He was just trying to make you angry.” Harry wanted to give Draco an out. An opportunity to disregard everything that was said that morning.
“Huh? Oh yeah, sorry…just processing is all” Harry took a deep breath before continuing, “And Charlie, I really should apologize too. I should never have outed us like that that night at the pub. It was a terrible thing to do and not a great way to show my feelings. I’m sorry.”
“Oh, I see.” Harry didn’t really actually understand what that meant, but figured he needed to be understanding.
“Even if it is true, he still needs to know Draco. Harry doesn’t like to be left out of things that concern him. He had too much of it with Dumbledore and the Order…”
Harry remained in shock. “Oliver Wood?! You’ve known since I was 11 and didn’t say anything to ME about it?!”
“Well, what do you think?” Draco gestured around at the place obviously looking for Harry to comment on the appearance.
They ate, drank, talked, and laughed all throughout dinner. When they were finished, Draco reached for Harry’s hand and let them to his room. They hadn’t been alone in a house together since their first date months ago and they planned to use it to their advantage.
Seeing Draco interact with Hermione and Ron and watching his two best friends embrace Draco made Harry’s heart swell. Over the course of the term he knew he was falling harder and harder for Draco.
Sirius seemed to feel this answer was adequate and patted Harry on the back before saying goodnight and leaving his room.
As they ordered, they quickly fell into a conversation about Quidditch. Harry forgot how good Draco was at the sport and how much they both loved it. The conversation flowed easily from who was the best Quidditch player, to the best team, to the most important position on the team (which they both agreed was seeker!). This also led them to reminiscing about past games at Hogwarts. They ordered butterbeers and Harry went into detail about how he lost all of the bones in his arm in THAT game second year. Draco talked about his worst Quidditch injuries and how he spent more time with Pomfrey than he cared to admit (he also admitted they weren’t all as bad as he made them out to be).
“I don’t think we could have gone somewhere with MORE people. Look around, there are thousands of people here!” Harry smiled and placed his hands on his hips.
Harry couldn’t help himself, “Draco” he tried to sound stern but realized it came out breathy. He tried again, “Draco…are you sure about this?”. Harry hated himself for asking, but knew it needed to be asked.
A fantasy in which the strong older boy swept him up on his broomstick and they flew off into the night sky together. One in which Harry saw Oliver spending holidays in Godric’s Hollow and Harry spent summers in Scotland.
Harry left the shop and ran to meet-up with the blonde man. Harry tried to not let himself get too excited when he saw the smile on Draco’s face upon seeing him. He also tried to not get too excited when Draco said, “Looking good today Potter. A break-up looks good on you.”
When the circle turned to Harry, he didn’t even hesitate. He stood quickly – too quickly. The room spun around him, and he immediately said to himself, “I should leave. I should go home, sit down Harry”. But that part of him was quickly gone as he decided to allow himself to speak.
Harry allowed himself to chuckle and Draco decided to go sit next to him on the bed and peeled back the covers from his face, revealing those eyes again.
The summer after the war was nothing but trials and funerals. The whole season was a blur, but Harry could clearly remember Draco’s trial. He remembers the pale boy looking paler and more of a boy than ever before. He looked scared and frail as he sat before the Wizengamont and awaited Harry’s testimony. The one that would inevitably free him of his pending prison sentence.
“17 years ago, my son was nearly taken from me. An evil man walked into this very house and rendered your mother and I useless. I thought I would wake up to find my entire family murdered…”
The dance was a let-down, just like Harry knew it would be. Hermione showed up with Viktor Krum, which surprised everyone except Ron. Ron was less surprised and more…angry about the situation. Harry had a feeling why, but let it slide and decided to be there for his friend during his anger.
But luckily, after just a few weeks of this, the Weasleys came to his rescue. Ron came to check on him and quickly realized the situation was not good for Harry or Teddy and brought them both to live at the Burrow. Molly Weasley was ecstatic. She quickly took to helping care for both Harry and Teddy. She taught Harry everything he needed to know and made sure the two didn’t leave the Burrow until they were absolutely ready.
Harry cleared his throat, looked straight in Draco’s eyes, and asked “Draco Malfoy. Will you marry me?”
“Not gay? Don’t worry Potter, I know how to handle this.” And there was that wink again and tightness again.
Draco and Harry left for Scotland one week after graduation. They rented a flat near the Montrose Magpies training camp and Draco started at his school around the time Harry started training.
“Harry. I’m all for having this conversation with you if it helps. But I really need you to be more direct. I don’t want to play this game of reading between the lines and reading wrong.”
The two finished their meal and Draco began to clear the table and head back outside. He once again found Harry right behind him as he began to head out the door. Great, this was his life now.
The last task was a terrifying maze in which the champions would have to find their way to the center and locate the tournament cup. The person who found it first, would win. Harry was smart enough to know it wasn’t that simple. He had heard from several people that the maze changed people and made you see/hear things that weren’t actually there…and some things that were.
“We are going to town.” And on that note, Draco marched right back inside and began to prepare his things to take into town with him. Harry followed behind in a confused shuffle.
“Gallivanting around Britain I imagine. Haven’t heard from her in four years.” Harry noticed the tone shift in Draco and his body language shifted into a more defensive position.
have it perks. The muggles in town have no idea who he is. To them, he’s simply a new farmer with a lot to learn. He goes by ‘Drake’ now because he quickly found that
“As soon as he does, you’ll be the first to know.” He smiled at his godson who returned the smile and moved the conversation towards Uncle Charlie’s dragons, a favorite subject of Teddy’s.
“Harry…your father is…just worried is all. I don’t think he was expecting that…” Lily let out a breath and moved towards her son. She hugged him tight, then released and look at him, “Harry…you love him?”
Draco answered most of Harry’s questions, bypassing the ones that got too personal or too close such as
Harry was the first to speak, “So…” but was immediately cut off by lips pressing into his. Harry needed no time to recover and responded back quickly.
During dinner on Wednesday, Draco was met with a rather disgruntled Hermione Granger approaching him. “He wants you to bring him food.”
Harry now works out of the department of Magical Transportation and conducts apparition tests. Because most wizards and witches receive their apparition license through their school at the age of sixteen, he often only had to journey to Hogwarts (and sometimes Beauxbatons) once a year to conduct the tests. The rest of the time is mostly paperwork or one-off apparition tests conducted in the Ministry.
Harry disappeared for a while, then returned to find a concerned Hermione and Ron sitting next to one another in the living room.
Oliver found him on the field and immediately scooped him up into a hug, whispering “I knew you’d be brilliant” in his ear before putting him down. Harry felt a shiver run all over his body.
Harry Potter. All five feet, eight inches of him. Messy black hair. And even though he can’t see it from this distance, he knows it’s there. The scar.
After days of this, the only thing that got him out of bed was Quidditch. It was something to put all of his thoughts into, something to allow him to
His parents were always quick to console him when he let his insecurities be known. “You are our perfect son, Harry. You are good.” His father James would say to him frequently when he found his son crying in his bedroom.
And so, this was it – the day Draco Malfoy stopped fearing his father. There were much scarier things in the world than Lucius Malfoy.
Hermione took a long pause. “I know Harry and it’s okay. He does seem to enjoy being around you too. Maybe he likes both? Some people are like that.”
“What?! No! I- I don’t. I’m happy for Dean and Seamus, and Ron’s brother Charlie is gay…and he’s…great” Draco noticed the breathiness in Harry’s words as he said ‘great’.
Ron also had a deep love of Quidditch. When they were young, James would take the two boys to Puddlemere matches whenever he could. Harry loved seeing his father interact with Ron – almost as if the two were brothers. And Harry knew Ron loved these days too because it was his chance to get away from being one of seven and just be…Ron. Both boys would dress in their Puddlemere jerseys and bring banners in support of their favorite players.
The two made their way down the aisle of the train until they found an empty space. Not too long after sitting down, the train started to move, and a young witch appeared at their door. She introduced herself as “Hermione Granger, muggle-born. But I already know loads of magic!”. Harry and Ron gave each other a concerned look but allowed the witch to sit with them. They were actually terrified of what would happen if they didn’t.
Draco rolled his eyes and once again gestured for Harry to follow. When they went into the study, Draco closed the door and threw a locking spell on it before moving back towards Harry. Harry found himself once again up against a wall, Draco’s hand in the front of his shirt, and his lips on his neck.
come from behind him – not close, but not far neither. For a moment he strangely feels as though the
“It was foolish. She wants him Harry. What am I supposed to do?” Draco looked at Harry with the most pitiful look he’s ever seen.
to stop staring at Malfoy. It’s getting out of hand, really.” Harry turned defensive, “I’m not staring, Ron! I’m just…concerned.” Harry looked at Hermione who was giving him a pitiful look.
The week dragged on rather slowly and Teddy grew more and more excited as the days went on (while Harry grew more and more anxious). The blonde hadn’t left his thoughts once since the playdate last week. So, as a way to get his and Teddy’s mind off the next playdate, he decided to take Teddy to Hermione and Ron’s on Friday.
As soon as Draco saw Harry, his face changed. It looked like he was dropping a mask he had put on and revealed what laid underneath. Draco kissed Harry back, then broke away, “Goodness Potter. Wait till we get in the castle – don’t want to give these young kids a show.” Draco smirked, but Harry kept his grin.
An hour later and Draco hadn’t moved. His room had grown darker and the only light available was traces of moonlight seeping through the curtains. He was soon startled by a house elf appearing in his room to inform him that his father wished to see him in the library for tea.
Draco gave Harry the grand tour which concluded in the Malfoy library. The room was impressive. Wall-to-wall books. Hermione would love this room.
“Ron! Stop it! Thank you, Draco. That would be helpful.” Hermione decided to wrangle up the rest of the table and step outside.
“Of course Harry! But like I said, they are beneath you. Trust me, you wouldn’t be interested.” Harry felt strange at the thought of Draco knowing what he’d be interested in.
Harry watched from his seat as Draco entered the room in a surprisingly good mood. He seemed to be laughing with Crabbe and Goyle, with his girlfriend Pansy following close behind. Harry was strangely happy to see Draco happy for once, but something about his demeanor was off-putting. This was the same boy who only two weeks ago had been sobbing in the boy’s bathroom and refused to attend any of his meals. And now he suddenly was…giddy?
Harry spent the rest of break dodging questions from his parents and godfathers about the man. As perfect as the moment was…his heart still felt as though he cheated. As soon as Oliver left, Harry’s mind went back to Draco.
an eighteen-year-old boy who just fought and won a war, a child. At a time when all he wanted to do was lay in his room and sleep, shut off from the world, and be left alone – they brought him an infant.
Molly stood back to get a full look at Harry. “Harry, dear. You never need to keep anything from us. We are your family. The only thing we want for you is happiness.”
Draco stood up from the table and began to make his way out of the kitchens. Harry stood to follow but was ushered away by Draco. Draco went upstairs and he heard a door close.
His favorite animal on his farm was actually his Highland Cows. He only had two, but he fell in love the moment he saw them. Their shaggy brown hair felt amazing to run his hands through and he liked the way they just kind of lounged about. The sheep always seemed to be moving and making sound. But the cows…the cows were perfect.
“Harry…why would we tell you to break-up with him? If I’m being honest, I’m a little concerned now.” Sirius sounded unsure of where this conversation was going.
The second name was the champion from Durmstrang – Viktor Krum. This time, it was Hermione’s turn to let out a sound. It was a barely audible gasp, but Harry heard it and turned to look at her. She looked concerned for a brief second, then went back to reading the book she had brought. Harry had heard a lot about Krum, of course he knew of him, anyone who loved Quidditch like Harry did knew Viktor Krum. The man had been playing professionally since the age of 15. He was like a Quidditch prodigy.
“That depends…” He could tell the boys deflated a little at the response, but noticed Draco was still on the edge of his seat.
with me after? What is it about ME that men seem to…pity? Like, I’m some precious creature that can’t handle a KISS without a long discussion after?!” Harry knew he needed to calm down, but he couldn’t help it – the insecurity was rising. He thought he had been doing well with Draco. He thought things had been great! What was happening…?
“I want you to be sure that you’re completely over Charlie before we start anything…serious. I’m not interested in being someone’s second choice.”
Harry walked through the doorway and followed Draco towards the back of the house to the library, which after many Saturdays quickly became, “their spot”. “Have a seat, can I get you anything?”
When Draco received a letter one week later, Harry figured Narcissa must be stronger than she looked.
“Ah – well, it was a rather…difficult day. It’s been a difficult week actually. Been hard to get away, you know?” Draco actually didn’t know. He didn’t know anything about the man in front of him actually. I mean, sure, he knows this man really well when you think about it. But he doesn’t know anything from the past couple of years. Was Harry Potter married? Did he marry the Weasley girl? Maybe Granger? No, Granger’s too smart for him… Did he have kids? He’s an auror, that’s obvious. But what about the rest of him?
“Speaking of Kreacher…how did you know we lived at Grimmauld Place?” This is a question Harry had been wondering about since that day at the ice cream parlor.
over the summer, the thought still didn’t leave his mind. Even while he was having his thoughts about Harry Potter, he never once thought it would or could lead to anything. He knew what he had to do, and he planned to do it.
There were others reasons he liked the idea that Draco was gay. It freed his mind to play some of the ideas he had been creating since the beginning of term. And that night, with the curtains of his bed drawn closed, Harry reached down into his pants and allowed himself to indulge in some of these ideas.
, the rest of you are in no state to try and take care of him right now. Besides, I don’t think there’s anything we can do for him at the moment. Draco has changed. Remember, Harry said so himself and that’s why he spoke for him at his trial. I heard from Blaise that he’s working to become a healer. A HEALER Ron. Do you think an ex-Death Eater turned healer would put all of that at risk to hurt our Harry?”
“Yeah, no one really talks about it much. Like I said, I think mom still expects me to show up with a woman one day and most of the family just doesn’t acknowledge it. Bill has been great about it though– he’d be okay with you too if you wanted to tell him. George is coming around to it too. He and I have been bonding much more now and he made a joke the other day that tells me he knows what I am and is fine with it enough to make jokes about it. But I actually think the rest of them have kind of forgotten about the whole thing…Ron and Ginny were pretty young at the time.”
The first time Scorpius left without Draco; Draco was a wreck. Harry had left Teddy with Molly for the weekend so he could be there for Draco and offered to stay the weekend at the Manor, but Draco refused and said he didn’t want to be there without Scorpius – so they stayed at Grimmauld Place.
He re-plays the scene of Harry Potter rolling out of Hagrid’s arms and jumping to defeat Voldemort. It’s his favorite memory from the war. It’s the moment he felt hopeful for the first time in a long time and as he watched the Dark Lord die (for good) he felt relief wash over his body.
The day before his father’s trial, Draco decided to pay a visit to Azkaban. He didn’t know why, but something compelled him to go – it was still his father.
Harry continued this until he heard Ron say, “hey mate, stop staring. I know you really wanted to ask out Cho, but she’s with someone else. You just got to let her go.”
Harry paced back and forth all day. He tried to busy himself around the Manor but mostly just found himself playing with the boys in the playroom as a way to keep his mind occupied. The hours dragged on and he couldn’t tell if this was a good sign or bad.
or ‘I knew this was going to happen’. His friends respected his wishes and just listened…and hugged.
Harry must have been obvious about his thoughts because he soon saw Draco Malfoy walking towards them and remarking, “We’ve made drastic changes to the house in the past few years. It was important to me that Scorpius and I had a fresh start after everything.”
The two started to make their way towards the front door of Malfoy Manor. As Draco opened the door, Harry stepped out onto the stoop. He turned around to say a final goodbye, when suddenly Draco’s lips were on his. The kiss was quick. Too quick for Harry.
“Mr. Draco fought…?” Harry nodded, “Mm-hmm. He did. He helped save me.” The boy in front of him gave a big smile before growing quiet again.
Harry was awoken in the morning by very loud banging coming from downstairs. The wake up was jarring and he took a moment to gather his surroundings before turning to reach for Draco.
But as his mind was thinking it, his eyes were taking in a full view. Draco had grown at least 4 inches over the summer and became more built. Sure, he still looked pretty skinny, but Harry could tell muscles had formed while looking closely at his robes, which led Harry’s mind to quickly wonder - was Draco Malfoy working out over the summer?
“I found this.” Ron held up a small note that Harry immediately recognized. He quickly checked his pockets and realized his note from Draco wasn’t in there.
“Boys – go into the playroom. We’ll be in there in a little while.” As the boys took off, Harry watched as Draco made his way back to the table and sat down opposite Harry.
Harry loved the idea of having Ron on the team – finally someone to discuss strategy with! Ron also thought Oliver Wood hung the moon. He and Harry would talk about his skills at Quidditch, the way he rode his broom, and his ability to motivate the team.
Harry and Draco both pulled away and blushed. Neither wanting to look at the other. “Well, goodnight”. “Goodnight, Harry”.
Harry wasn’t expecting Oliver to be this invested. “Oh. Um, he just felt we weren’t meant to be.” Harry tried to sound nonchalant, but weeks of crying and frustration just couldn’t be masked.
Some memories hurt more than others. The memory of seeing a disfigured Harry Potter dragged into his home and held up for him to expose (which he knew he couldn’t do). Or the screams of Hermione Granger being sliced open by his aunt. The look on Luna Lovegood’s face as Draco brought food down to her and the others in the cellar of his childhood home.
at anyone, then they wouldn’t outright say anything to him. Maybe mutter something under their breathes, but nothing direct.
“You don’t know what you’re talking about. Scorpius isn’t going anywhere. And don’t talk about Harry as if he isn’t right here. I don’t care what you saw, good-bye.” Draco slammed the door in her face.
“Oh…thanks. But you don’t have to…console me or anything. I’m fine.” Harry tried to shake Dean off, but Dean wasn’t having it.
When Harry arrived at the astronomy tower, Draco wasn’t there. Harry decided to wait and took out his homework from the day. He could barely remember even going to classes after the events of that morning, but felt it was best to at least attempt to do work. After an hour, Harry heard footsteps on the stairs. When Draco arrived, he looked surprised to see Harry there.
Once beverages were poured, Harry began to ask Draco more about his work. Draco seemed happy to talk about it. He spoke in a way that showed great passion for the job (even with his ‘half-wit’ colleagues). Harry watched carefully as the man spoke. He noticed the way Draco used his hands a lot when he got excited and how sweat pooled at the top of his hairline. He liked how much Draco smiled while discussing the job and the level of detail he went into. He’d never seen Draco like this before. But he had also never allowed himself to talk like this with Draco. So…normal. Carefree.
. The date stayed in his brain for the remainder of his holiday at Hogwarts. Two months…then what? What would happen on March 1
Dumbledore’s voice bellowed from the tip of his wand and Harry immediately turned around to find Ron and Hermione staring at him. Harry was grateful they were unable to speak.
he was supposed to respond to that, so they continued their meal in silence. And Draco strangely enjoyed it. He liked having someone here to eat meals with, even if that someone was Harry Potter. He also appreciated that Harry didn’t seem to have any interest in bringing up the whole ‘you have to come back’ thing again. At least…not right now anyway.
Draco contemplated all of the answers he could give before deciding on one that both hid the truth while also put the truth firmly out there, “For me, it isn’t soon at all.”
Potter.” Harry could tell Draco was growing nervous the closer he got to him. Once he reached the still sitting man, he moved to sit in his lap, legs straddled on either side.
The private box also had private access. No one would be able to see them come in, leave, or even see them
“Yeah, well, I don’t know about the romance part, but I definitely have a lot of…feelings at the moment. I just can’t believe I allowed myself to get like this. I’m so embarrassed. I just outed myself. I outed Charlie. Oh shite, I OUTED CHARLIE. TO HIS WHOLE FAMILY! I’m the worst person...” Harry put his head on the bar and covered his head with his hands.
Draco cracked a smile back, “I guess you’re right…”. The four of them continued to watch the game and Draco pretended to be sad when the Canons lost, but Harry saw a smile break out on his face anyway.
Draco heard a murmur of “Happy Christmas” and “Happy Christmas Malfoy”. No one looked surprised to see him, so Draco figured Harry must have told them all he was coming.
“Draco! Did you hear literally anything I just said? I need your help. You’re the only death eater that’s living and not incarcerated who could possibly tell us anything about this man.” Harry was walking quickly behind Draco and he could hear the sound of both of their sets of boots making splashes in the grass.
“Oh! Hogwarts!” Teddy’s eyes lit up as he spoke. Teddy loved Hogwarts. Of course he had never actually been there, but he knew everyone in his family had gone and couldn’t wait until he was eleven and could go as well.
Fourth year was a difficult year. In addition to the excitement of the Tournament, there was also excitement over a mandatory dance, the Yule Ball, that was to take place before winter holiday. Harry didn’t really care to go, and he certainly didn’t have an interest in asking anyone to go with him. Ron was adamant that they go, so Harry said okay and felt the three of them should go together. Ron was quick to point out that that was ridiculous and went on a quest to find Harry and himself dates.
“Happy Christmas ‘arry” Oliver beamed at him as he opened the door. Oliver was holding flowers in his hand and started to make his way into the house. He had barely shaken off the snow from his shoulders when Harry could hear his mother, father, and godfathers enter the entry way.
“We…we caught him. Rowle, that is.” Draco began to nod slowly as Harry continued. “We were able to infiltrate the small group he had formed and took him down outside a muggle house near Cambridge. It was…brutal. But fortunately, no lives were lost.”
Harry looked up at Draco and moved to kiss him. It started chaste, but quickly escalated as Harry began to push against Draco. Draco maneuvered himself to laying with his back on the bed and an excited, kissing Harry on top. As things continued, Draco knew this was a position that made Harry back off. He had noticed by now that any time Harry could
Harry boarded the Hogwarts Express for his sixth year, feeling like a new man. His experience with Dean, while extremely heart-breaking, had actually led to some pretty great moments this summer. Harry was excited to get back to school, to see his friend, to play Quidditch and hopefully move-on from the event with Dean.
It was rather late by the time they arrived, but as soon as they were inside Draco asked, “Can I fix you a drink?”. “Sure” Harry responded and followed him into the kitchens.
They strategized that they would only write once a week – to lessen the amount of times an owl would be at a window at either of their houses. And for the first month of break they stuck to this routine.
“Not necessarily. I dated Ginny because I thought it was what I should do. She was my best friend’s sister; it would guarantee me a place in the Weasley family. Which is basically my only family…but I realized that was dumb. They would always be my family. And Charlie was…out of convenience.” Draco smirked as he realized Harry was stealing his words from earlier.
“Yeah, well. It is what it is. At first, I was furious with her. I never once was going to leave Scorpius. I was always going to be there for him, but she just…couldn’t. But now, I’m not as mad. Astoria always wanted a certain kind of life. The kind she
Harry didn’t know what to say. Part of him was relieved to finally hear Charlie admit to all the things Harry had been thinking. He knew that Charlie knew about his feelings and he knew that Charlie didn’t stop them. Part of him had been so mad about it for so long. But after everything that Charlie had just said, only one piece continued to stick out to him, “He said you deserved someone better. Someone who loved you”. Draco had said that…even when he was only pretending to be Harry’s boyfriend. That didn’t sound like something a fake boyfriend would say. And hadn’t he said something similar on the day in the Malfoy library? Maybe Harry really did mess this whole thing up.
“Harry. If someone was going to hex me, they’d have the good enough sense not to knock on the front door first. Plus, the house has wards in place to keep certain people out, it’ll be fine.” Draco didn’t seem concerned, but Harry couldn’t shake it.
he came to the cottage in the first place. Draco even went so far as to ask after Granger and Weasley and found that they were actually married (not really surprising if he thought back on it). Harry wasn’t married nor did he have children. Draco didn’t trust the way his chest seemed to warm to this.
“Oh. That’s probably just Billy.” Now, that look. That’s the look Draco liked from Harry. One of shock.
“Harry…is everything alright?” Hermione was definitely concerned that he had just apparated to their house on a Monday evening and had yet to say anything yet.
during the war? You weren’t there. You don’t know what it was like. Draco fought for what he believed he had to. He and his mother ended up saving me in the long run. And as for me? In case you don’t remember what brought you here in the first place, the world already knows about us. It’s out and I highly doubt that being with me will
“Merlin Potter! Yes! Yes I am sure. Please continue.” Harry smirked back and continued before eventually pushing fingers and then more inside.
“I…I hoped you would.” Harry’s felt his heart flutter as he thought back to his own thoughts earlier in the night…
“I think you already answered that question. No stares. Silent.” Still trying to keep from sounding like a dick.
Still looking at Draco, he noticed he was quiet for a long time. Draco seemed to be expecting an answer and his face was falling the longer it took to get one.
Draco continued down the steps and began to walk Harry to the door. They stood in the doorway, neither knowing exactly what to say.
Scorpius’ favorite place. Harry had always loved coming here with Teddy, but with Scorpius, it was a different experience. He got to see Teddy
The two flew around for an hour before Draco saw Harry begin to aim back towards the ground. When the two touched down Harry let out a loud yell that startled Draco.
Harry was laying in his bed in a similar state as when he arrived at Draco’s dorm the previous weekend – pajama bottoms and shirtless.
Harry actually found himself watching Cho and Cedric quite a bit during the dance. Cho looked beautiful, of course. But Cedric. Cedric looked…perfect. He watched as the man glided around the dance floor with Cho and never looked away. He looked at the way Cedric’s dress robes flowed around him but hugged in just the right places. He looked at the way Cedric smiled while he danced with Cho and the way he would whisper in her ear before they both would look at each other and giggle.
understand what I was going through…but still. It was nice to have something.” Draco looked off in thought.
), he felt it was a much needed program. He also felt that Harry would be just the person to head it up.
Draco continued, “She’s agreed to visitation…and no lawyers.” Harry watched as Draco’s face broke out into a smile and he stood to grab Harry.
Harry was sitting on the sofa when his godfathers came to sit in the armchairs across from him. He felt this made it look like an interrogation and also felt that was likely what was going to happen.
Harry smiled and looked into the grey eyes in front of him. Harry moved forward and kissed Draco again. This time with more passion. He slid his hand onto Draco’s neck and ran his fingers through his hair. Draco moaned in happiness and surprise. He quickly found Harry’s hip and pulled Harry in tighter. Harry grabbed on to Draco’s arm and could feel the muscles that lived underneath the shirt. It sent a shiver down Harry’s back. The two stayed like that until they were startled by a, “goodnight Mr. Potter” and a sight of Narcissa Malfoy passing behind Draco and up the staircase.
One of his favorite parts of his childhood was when he and his parents would go to the Weasleys’ home, the Burrow. The Weasley family were also part of the Order of the Phoenix and fought alongside Lily and James during the war with Voldemort. The fact that both of their families survived the war brought the two closer together.
The lake had been a fascinating discovery when he first found the cottage. The only time he had ever really seen a lake was at Hogwarts, and the Black Lake wasn’t exactly a good representation for a muggle lake he found.
No matter how many times Harry said that sentence to himself, he still couldn’t believe it. He didn’t understand how he could be so stupid. Of course trying to share a kiss after you were just crying over another guy was NOT a good idea. Stupid Harry!
Harry knew this was true. He had heard it a million times growing up. He knew all about what Lucius Malfoy had done, but if this was the case – then he would have to show his father that Draco was not his father.
“He broke up with you?” Harry didn’t understand why Oliver highlighted the ‘you’ at the end of that question.
His father’s voice became angrier, “No. Draco – what are you thinking about? Are you thinking about a boy?”
Sirius let out a small laugh, “Oh, no, I really do. I promised your parents 15 years ago that nothing bad would happen to you while you were with me. At the time, I think they were thinking more
boys danced in anticipation. But his favorite part was watching Draco. Draco looked at Scorpius as if he had never seen something so perfect in his life.
As soon as his father saw him, he came rushing towards the bars, “Draco! My boy! You have to help me. You have to speak to him – get him to let me out of here!” His words were rushed, and his voice sounded erratic.
“Sure mate.” Ron shot him another smirk before Hermione got up to move into the dining room and patted his shoulder as she walked out the room.
When they both finished, Harry slowly pulled out and landed on his back next to Draco, breathless. “Merlin – we should have been doing that years ago!” Harry exclaimed with the only power left in his body. He heard Draco whisper something and felt a cleaning spell wash over him.
Harry awoke with light streaming into a room he wasn’t familiar with. It took him a minute to adjust to the fact that this was not his bed and the events of last night came back to him.
He would drop Teddy off with Rose and let them play while he could have his grown-up time with his two best friends. Completely Draco free.
“If he wants and if his dad says it’s okay.” Harry was looking down at the boy, refusing to meet Draco’s eyes in case he had overstepped again.
“Shit!” Harry yelled when he landed and realized how close the two were. “Sorry…I’m terrible at apparating and this farm is huge. I never know where I’m going to land…” Harry looked over at a startled Draco.
Harry couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “You had ‘things to take care of’. What about me?! What about taking care of ME!? And I only told them because I was miserable, Draco! I had to tell
Ron attempted to adjust quickly and by ‘adjust’ it meant ignore Draco completely. He began to discuss topics with the members of his table, all the while pretending Draco wasn’t sitting next to his girlfriend. He looked at everyone else, but Draco.
Harry felt he had come this far, might as well tell them everything. So, he did. He watched as their faces went from smiling to hurt.
By the time Ginny was set to return to Hogwarts, Harry was starting to feel useless at the Burrow. Everyone had a task ahead of them or something they were
“So, the people in town really like you, huh?” Draco quickly turned his head towards the man with a confused look on his face.
As the two girls passed by, Draco noticed how close the two men were. Under the cloak, Draco could feel Harry’s hot breath and was dangerously close to his face. The alcove was small and forced the two to stand flush against one another. Draco tried to think about mandrakes as a way to ensure his body would not place him into a compromising situation being this close to the man.
“Harry, I know I’ve done some really terrible things to you (and others) in the past but trust me – that’s done. I’m not that person anymore. I’ve grown up.” Harry nodded and let Draco continue.
“Oh…shite ‘arry. I’m sorry. I didn’t…I thought that was a rumor or like a joke. I didn’t know you were…” Harry jumped in before Oliver could finish.
“You, of course!” Harry looked startled at the sudden excitement in Draco’s voice. “Don’t look at me like that. I can count on one hand the number of gay men in our year and using two hands, the whole school. Half of them are trolls and the other half are Hufflepuffs, so let’s say – I’m intrigued.”
They arrived at the pitch and Harry watched as Oliver made his way to the stands. “Oliver! Why don’t you stay down here with me? You can help me make my decisions.” Harry watched as Oliver’s face lit up.
Charlie smiled and allowed his shoulders to relax. “Yeah, I completely understand. I didn’t exactly have the luxury when I came out. Mom caught me with a boy from school in our living room during winter hols my sixth year. I thought she and dad had taken everyone to London for the evening, but they returned early. Her scream was enough to bring everyone rushing in to find me failing at trying to button up my shirt while my ‘date’ was hastily pulling up his trousers. It was awful, but at least it got it out there.”
Harry remained in a daze for the rest of the day. That night, he replayed the scene in his head over and over again. His body reacted immediately, and Harry groaned. “Great…” he whispered to himself in the dark before he rolled over and went to sleep.
Harry spent the entire day scowling at people. He and Draco decided last night that they wouldn’t give into any of the whispers and would keep their head held high. They had nothing to be ashamed about.
the thoughts were, an emphasis on the family name, and a clear expectation for the future he was to have. But never the name ‘Harry Potter’.
Harry received weird boxes sent to his house, but they never made it past the gate because of his wards. He never even touched the boxes – just called Ron and had him send someone from the auror department to handle it. They were usually ‘harmless’ and were actually just angry howlers or potions to make Harry’s hair fall out or something.
Luckily, this only went on for a week before everyone became slammed with work before winter holiday.
Draco hesitated, but decided telling Harry was the right thing to do in the moment. “It was Blaise. He and I were very…close. Looking back on it now, I feel like he used me. It started off with just helping one another when we felt stressed, but it turned into more on my end. Blaise started to notice and would make comments. He made it seem as though we could have a relationship one day, but I soon realized it was so I would continue to…help him. This happened throughout sixth year when I was already going through a lot (as you can probably remember).” Harry looked down and felt awkward at the mention of the worst time in both of their lives.
did she say?” Harry looked around the kitchen for a moment, “And how did you know I had anything to do with it?!”
“Your party Harry! It’s not every day a young man turns 19! And I hear you’ve been talking with Kingsley about a prospective job opportunity – we will have lots to celebrate!”
Draco tried to listen to Harry as he spoke but kept wanting to fight back against him. He knew he wasn’t a good person. It was stupid to think he was.
anything. But now, he’s with Harry. And now she wants him back… Draco might lose his son because of Harry.
Knowing what was to come, Harry had decided to tell his best friends that morning before breakfast. He knew once they got to the Great Hall that all bets would be off.
Harry fixed himself dinner before calling it an early night and going to bed around 8pm. But sleep did not come. Instead, he found his thoughts wandering.
Harry seemed to be considering that point carefully. “Yes, but…he thought we were together at some point, right? When I helped you get out of prison in the first place? You and your mother, right?”
“Yes, that’s why people know who I am. But I’m not the only hero. A lot of people fought. Your Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron. All of the Weasleys actually. And Mr. Draco.” Harry hoped he wouldn’t have to go into that part of the story.
She didn’t speak, only thrusted a newspaper in his hand. He didn’t bother reading it once he saw the photo on the front page – he and Draco, kissing at the quidditch match yesterday.
His father simply put his hand on his shoulder and gave it a light shake while giving a half smile. Charlie knew his father would miss him, he always did, but he would be fine.
Draco looked down at himself in confusion. This is what he always wore…his tan work pants, a light button-up light blue shirt, and his work boots.
Thankfully, the change with Ginny was welcomed. Shortly after arriving at the Burrow, Harry knew he had no intentions of re-kindling any sort of romantic relationship with Ginny but didn’t know exactly how to approach the conversation. The two had drifted far apart during the past year and now with the death of her brother, Ginny was different. And if he was being honest with himself, Harry was different too. The conversation between the two happened just one week before Ginny was due to return to Hogwarts for her final year.
Throughout their first year at Hogwarts, Harry learned rather quickly that Hermione was absolutely brilliant. She was easily the best witch in their year. Ron and him on the other hand were average. They hated doing their schoolwork, especially when they found Hogwarts Quidditch.
He also found himself staring at Dean while they all got ready for bed. These boys had grown up together. They had changed in front of each other loads of times, and yet, here he was. Staring. He tried to rationalize it by saying, “You’re just curious. You just need to get a girlfriend”. But he knew that wouldn’t help. He didn’t want a girlfriend…he wanted Dean.
sounds familiar…almost like the sound of someone apparating… He doesn’t turn around. Instead, shakes the idea from his mind and continues cutting.
“Potter, we really must work on those manners.” Draco smirked and Harry felt his whole chest tighten. This time, he knew it was all for Draco.
Draco took a deep breath before explaining the situation with his father and the contents of the letter. He tried his best to leave out details he felt were…personal but wanted to make sure he gave her all the information she would need to help him make a decision or devise a plan.
Quite the opposite, Ron was surprisingly the first to comment, “That’s bullshit! We could get him the best lawyer! Right ‘Mione?!” Ron wasn’t even looking at his wife, but Harry watched her smile and look at her husband.
Once the girls were gone, Harry didn’t move. He had been looking to his right and monitoring the girls as they moved past, but now was moving his head to face Draco.
“Well, Harry and Teddy moved into the house. And you and Harry sleep in the same room. And…and…” the boy was starting to stutter as he spoke, “And you always tell him you love him…”.
Harry chuckled before responding, “It’s hard to explain. But, as you know, there was a war that ended seven years ago. A very bad wizard came and hurt a lot of people. Your parents and Uncle Fred included. Well, we all fought against him and we won. He…killed me. But I sort of…came back.”
It took Draco a moment to focus, but when he eventually snapped back to reality, he too made his way towards his dorm. He entered, closed the door, and threw himself on his bed. He was beating himself up about what had happened.
“What do you mean ‘deserve’? Are you saying you left and came here because you felt it was what you ‘deserved’? Some sort of punishment?”
Blaise was still hurt and was growing suspicious of where Draco disappeared to every night. He decided to take it upon himself to figure it out and followed Draco to the astronomy tower. He knew what Draco used that spot for and decided to wait at the bottom of the tower for enough time to catch Draco in the act.
to be fair with him. Some of them, like Slughorn, didn’t actually want to speak to him – but they weren’t rude or unfair. They almost acted like he didn’t exist. Which he was fine with. So long as they gave him fair marks, he wouldn’t mind.
Most of the rumors it churned out, turned out to be true. Which is why when Ginny approached the Gryffindor table one morning and said, “Have you heard the rumor?” – Harry was hooked. Hermione rolled her eyes, she liked to pretend she hated gossip, but Harry knew she’d keep listening anyway.
The next day began the start of classes for their final year at Hogwarts. Harry knew this was a big day. He knew he should be preparing to enter his NEWT-level courses with his undivided attention. But he couldn’t. Last night sealed the deal on Harry’s worry over Draco. He needed to talk to him.
“Sixth year? Or at least, that’s what Hermione and Ron would call it. They thought I was obsessed with you because of how much I followed and talked about you.”
Harry was afraid he overstepped until Draco let out a laugh. “Of course I knew! I knew since I was 14 years old. But that wasn’t exactly something I could act on or think about in this family. I knew I was to marry a pureblood witch and produce an heir. It was my job.”
“No Ronald! I don’t think that’s what they’re doing actually….” Hermione looked down at her plate as her voice got soft.
If Harry’s parents were surprised, they didn’t mention it in their letter back. They simply responded back with a
Draco cleared his throat and decided to just let the words flow. “I – I do…like guys, that is. Um, I….” Draco was stumbling over the words he thought would simply ‘flow’ out. “I’m not sure what to say…”
Harry’s heart fluttered. He gave a half smile, “yeah, I’m okay. Thanks…but you don’t have to always check on me.” Sirius moved to sit next to Harry on the bed.
Harry always knew Draco was intelligent. He came just behind Hermione in their class, but he didn’t know he was this…sexy. No, brilliant. He meant brilliant. But maybe his intelligence was…sexy.
Harry told his parents everything. He told them about the break-up with Draco, the marriage arrangements, and the letter from the Malfoys. He also told them about his plans to leave.
Harry felt his world come crashing down. He had been so angry just minutes ago, but now felt…pain. He wanted to yell, “Wait! Come back!” but couldn’t seem to find his voice. He just kept hearing Draco say, “I can’t take care of you.”
“His father was a Death Eater, Ron. Not Draco. And besides – it’s…nice to have someone to talk to you know…about stuff.” Harry immediately saw the hurt look on his best friend’s face.
Harry read the note several times before folding it up and putting it in his pocket. He looked around the room several times before he remembered Draco didn’t even have Charms with him. He had to have known that Harry would be in Charms right now….and that this was his seat. Harry felt a strange warmth spread over him.
they’ve already had two girlfriends and killed a dark lord. It’s JUST ME who loses their virginity to their best mate’s older brother only to hear him say he would rather live in another COUNTRY than be with you. Yeah, makes sense, it’s always just me…”.
Harry forced himself to try to be calm and ended up coming out sounding more hurt than angry. “What do you want me to say? Do you want me to tell you how I think I was falling for him and now I can’t bring myself to write him back much less go near him? Want me to tell you how I messed everything up because I have no confidence and I don’t feel like I’ll ever actually be loved?”
The answer came the next Saturday while Harry, Draco, Teddy, and Scorpius were having breakfast at the Manor. They all heard an owl at the window and Harry rose to grab it while Draco finished pouring juices for the boys. Draco still had his house elf, but Harry had pushed Draco to do more and more stuff on his own and for Scorpius.
“Shit, I didn’t mean it like that. I just meant…like, you won’t go around spreading it. You seem to be keeping to yourself this year. I haven’t heard you say anything bad about anyone – no slurs or insults.”
Several hours later, Harry was in the kitchens with Luxley talking about dinner when Draco made his return. This Draco didn’t look as broken as the one from earlier. This Draco looked sad, yes, but also determined.
“Is this why you were so upset, son? You didn’t want to tell us?” Harry looked at his parents and decided to tell the story of Dean once again. And once again, he was met with the same worried and sad faces. When it was over, his parents moved-in to hug him once again. In this moment, Harry felt extremely loved.
Harry noticed the shift in atmosphere in the room. Their tones had shifted from aggression and annoyance to…pity and understanding. Their body language no longer screamed ‘defensive’, but now they both somehow looked more open. And it honestly looked like Astoria was thinking about what he had said.
Harry didn’t know what to say but found himself letting out an exhale he didn’t know he had been holding.
I like you Draco. I think I was just…hesitant to acknowledge it.” Draco moved toward Harry but stopped himself from getting too close.
Draco dressed himself more quickly than he ever would were it just himself and made his way into his living room.
One month after the altercation on the Quidditch pitch, Harry heard a familiar sound on another one of his nightly walks. He walked into the boy’s lavatory and found a familiar sight…Draco was on the floor. Completely disheveled. But this time, Harry didn’t see a bottle anywhere in sight.
“What’s so funny? What did I miss?” The room continued to laugh even harder and Draco stood up and walked towards Harry. “Nothing, Harry, now I believe there was a mention of a gift?” Harry led the two of them out of the living room and away from prying Weasley eyes.
The first night after the man left, Draco cried. He cried for hours. He cried through the night. He looked around at his cottage and for a moment panicked. He was Draco Malfoy, the Slytherin Prince. He came from one of the most well-respected pureblood families in history. He shouldn’t be in this shitty cottage in some unknown muggle village.
Harry wanted his old Draco back. The one he had for just a few months before Astoria came back into the picture and made Draco depressed and anxious all the time.
Three weeks into term and Harry was starting to become overwhelmed. Harry knew his NEWTs classes  would be difficult, he just didn’t realize he would be going through…whatever this is while taking them. His stress was making it more and more difficult for him to focus on Quidditch, but he knew he couldn’t push it off any longer – he needed to have tryouts.
“Yeah – I’m happy for you! It’s great! I’m sure your dragons and your co-workers miss you loads.” Harry knew his voice was way too high pitched but couldn’t bother to care. “Wait. Have you told your family?”
He found the store eventually and looked across the street to find a beautiful pub. Emerald green with black and silver embellishments. Harry felt it looked like Slytherin house threw up all over the outside but couldn’t deny it was gorgeous and refined. Definitely owned by a Slytherin…
“You can close your mouth Potter. I was just as shocked as you were the first time Scorpius came home from a sleep over and started talking about ‘Harry Potter The-Boy-Who-Lived’. His grandmother and I had a discussion, but it appears she has not stopped.”
Oliver didn’t acknowledge the comment, but simply gave a polite smile and said, “Well, sir, I played professional Quidditch with Puddlemere United for three years before making my return to Hogwarts this year. I’m apprenticing to be the new flying instructor next year – once Professor Hooch retires.”
On one of their Saturdays, Harry decided to ask the question that had been bubbling inside of him. “Draco, when did you tell your mum you were gay?”
Draco began to push them out of the kitchen, all the while never leaving Harry’s lips, and towards the staircase. When they reached the bottom, the two pulled away and looked up at the stairs before looking back at each other. Draco quickly thought it through and grabbed Harry’s arm.
Draco nodded and closed the door. Twenty minutes. That wasn’t nearly enough time to complete his morning routine. He had to make a choice – get back in bed and finish what he started…or shower.
It happened in little ways really. Draco had an off hour while Harry had herbology and without fail, Draco would be waiting outside the greenhouse to walk him to his next class. Harry started to love the way Draco would push him in potions. This was easily Draco’s best subject and arguably Harry’s worst. But Draco wouldn’t listen to that – he insisted that everyone had the potential for greatness when it came to potions. You just had to practice and study – which is exactly what Draco helped Harry do. Thanks to Draco, Harry received an ‘exceeds expectations’ for his potions OWL last year and now he was on track to receive the same on his NEWTs next year.
“Honestly Ron! You never listen! I told you – he’s working at the Ministry in the centaur rights office. I’ve been meeting with him about a perspective job after I finish with Hogwarts. I’ve told you this!”
“Alright?” was all he said before shoveling food into his mouth. Draco always hated his lack of table manners. He watched as over the years they had gotten slightly better, but it always looked as if Harry hadn’t eaten in fifteen years and he ate as if the food would be taken at any moment.
Harry felt Charlie pause and thought the answer was finished, but guessed Charlie was feeling chatty too because he continued.
It started out small. Harry was left with a lot of time to himself and with his thoughts. In the past, he would have used this time to think about the next
Also, Ron insisted that someone should stay up until you got home to make sure Malfoy didn’t kill you.”
“What was I supposed to say? I had been trying to drop hints! She wasn’t taking them. She just kept talking and acting like we were going to be together forever. But my heart wasn’t in it anymore…” Harry grew quiet, “we should have never gotten back together…the war changed people.”
The two found themselves in the astronomy tower, once again. Even after their relationship became public, this spot still felt…right for them. The night before they were set to leave, the two had decided to further their relationship. Harry still wasn’t ready to move
“No. It’s what I want. If you’re sure, I’m sure.” Harry moved in to kiss Draco again and it soon turned heated once again. Harry pulled away and looked at Draco.
“I see…” Harry let out before making his way to Draco’s neck “…that you’ve been watching me for a very long time apparently.” He moved to the other side and continued, “You know I like treacle tart.” More kisses on the neck, “and you knew I lived at Grimmauld Place.” Harry stopped and looked at Draco’s face. “If I didn’t know any better, I would think someone had a crush.”
He never did learn why…part of him figured a certain ‘Hero’ might have had something to do with it, but knew those thoughts were dangerous. Instead, he just simply let it go.
about the break-up and it was getting to be exhausting. You don’t ever have to do this again if you don’t want to.”
“Of all people, he is no one to judge anyone for their actions during the war. Bloody coward ran, didn’t he?” Shit, Harry was defending him…
“D-dad, what. What are you doing here?” Draco was trying to fix himself and tucked his shirt back in. Harry didn’t know what to do – so he just stood there.
“Blimey, the head of your own house doesn’t even like you.” Ron’s eyes went wide as he spoke. Almost as if he didn’t mean for it to actually come out.
They had the plan for merely 12 hours before it exploded in front of their faces. The next morning, as the two were heading to their first class, they made a spontaneous decision to be a little late for potions that day and sneak off instead.
“No, I am! I just wanted to be sure because last time….” Harry trailed off and was stopped by Draco continuing. “Harry. I’ve been thinking about this every day for the past week. It sounds like we are both sure, so…” Draco looked down towards Harry’s pants where a certain area had grown, then looked back towards Harry “…can I continue now?” Draco’s smirk caused Harry to lunge towards his lips and the two continued.
Harry and Teddy apparated home that night both equally exhausted from the day. Harry put Teddy to bed before dragging himself towards his respective room.
at him… Oliver Wood was in his house…. Harry couldn’t help but think how his 12-year-old self would be feeling right now.
The two made their way to the common room and into their respective dorms. Draco crawled into bed and reflected on the very strange turn of events that happened in just one weekend. He now had people to sit with for meals and Harry Potter was now…single.
At first, it was terrible. Harry had moved into Grimmauld Place and was living alone. Teddy would wake up at all hours of the night, he always needed to be fed, and he always needed to be changed. Harry was depressed and it took every ounce of him to care for the boy.
Draco’s face was cold. “What did you expect to happen Harry? I’m a pureblood. I’m the Malfoy heir. I
?” Draco could hear the distain in his father’s voice and tried with every part of him to hold back.
The rest of Draco’s day seemed to drag as he kept waiting and anticipating what Harry’s friends would say. He played every scenario he possibly could in his head as a way to brace himself for whatever Harry came to him with this evening.
“No, I completely understand. Take your time. I wasn’t ready either – I’m still not ready for it all to be out there if I’m honest. I think that’s why I let mum think what she wants and I keep living so far away.”
The more he thought about it, the more he realized his thoughts from a month ago had shifted. He didn’t want it to be just them anymore…he wanted more. He thought about what it would be like to hold Draco’s hand in the hall and share a kiss before walking into class.
“You are to be married Draco. This…” Lucius motioned between Harry and Draco, “This…can not happen. I thought I made myself very clear.”
“Didn’t I tell you not to worry about that, Potter? Blaise and I will be fine, trust me.” Draco gave a sly smile.
“Bye Scorpius! Bye Mr. Draco! Thank you for having me.” Teddy flashed a smile and Harry still couldn’t believe this kid.
When Blaise ascended the stairs, he was not disappointed. He found Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter, shirtless, and engaging in a very heated make-out session. The boys heard him let out a soft, “I knew it” before he took off running.
“There’s been suspicious activity happening in small muggle areas in Scotland and Ireland. The work seems to be dark magic and we have reason to believe Rowle is gaining followers and attempting to terrorize local muggle villages.” Draco could see Harry’s passion as he spoke, but he wanted nothing to do with this.
There was silence on the other end of the table and Harry was confused. He looked up and was met with two very large smiles. Remus was the first to speak, “We know Harry.”
“No Harry. No. I’m sorry, but no. I don’t feel that way about you. I’m – I’m sorry Harry if I gave you that impression, but I-I like someone else. A girl. I like girls.”
That’s how the four of them (Draco, Harry, Teddy, and Scorpius) ended up in Harry’s private box for the next Chudley Canons match.
“No, we aren’t together anymore. We broke up before she went back to Hogwarts. But, honestly, it’s for the best. I’m pretty sure I’m gay.”
The two boys danced on the balls of their feet while trying to peer around the (what felt like) millions of people in front of them in line. Teddy’s hair kept changing colors as he saw the different flavors and Scorpius kept pulling on his father’s hand to direct him to ‘look at that one!’.
But Draco. Draco was softer. He was less built and more lean. But, while Harry hadn’t seen Draco in anything other than his school uniform or the clothes he wore around his own house, Harry knew Draco was muscular underneath it all. When Harry thought of Draco (which was frequently), one word always popped into his head – handsome. Draco didn’t look at Harry as if he was something to be tamed or conquered, he looked at him like he…wanted him. Like he longed for him. And Harry loved it.
“What position do you play Oliver? I know in the past, Harry mentioned you were a keeper – did you keep that position with Puddlemere?” James looked happy to bring the conversation back to Quidditch.
Sure, when he was a child, he thought he would. His father was his hero. But years of trauma made that no longer a reality.
“But I do Harry. I do.” Draco went silent again and Harry was in absolute disbelief. Draco got up and moved out of the kitchens. Before he left, he turned back to a still sitting and shocked Harry. “You should go now…” then turned and walked back out.
Harry grew more and more anxious until he simply couldn’t take it anymore, “I’m sorry, aren’t we supposed to be talking about Scorpius? Didn’t YOU want to take him from Draco?” Harry pointed at Astoria and watched as her face grew serious. “And now, what? You’re suddenly friendly?”
“Yeah! But it’s back at the Burrow. Would you maybe…want to come by tomorrow?” Harry knew this was a long shot.
He spent the break wallowing in his room. He tried to do his schoolwork. The professors had assigned an enormous amount of work over the break and Draco was trying really hard to be a good student. He needed to do well, get a good job, and get out of the public eye. That was the plan. Forget his father, forget Harry Potter. Focus on school. Focus on your future. Focus on your life.
Harry opened and closed his mouth several times before finally speaking. “I – I’ve been looking literally everywhere for you. I’ve been searching for
They resumed conversation as if nothing happened in the doorway a mere few yards away. The more glasses Draco drank, the chattier and warmer he became. He began to ask questions about Harry’s recent dating history – which he found was a quick conversation. After the discussion of Ginny, which Draco rolled his eyes about, and then to Charlie, which Draco seemed
Charlie immediately shot an aggressive look towards the blonde-haired boy. “It isn’t polite to eavesdrop Malfoy.”
When Draco looked at Harry’s face, he saw a huge grin that Draco couldn’t help but notice lit up Harry’s green eyes.
“Ah – well, at least then it was with good reason, huh?” Draco wanted to smile but couldn’t while thinking back on that year.
Harry sat them both down that morning in the common room and told them outright, “Hermione. Ron. I’m with Draco. I like him very much and we’re a couple. We’ve been a couple for the past month but will make it official today. Blaise walked in on us yesterday and I suspect by the time we go to breakfast the whole school will know. So, I’m telling you now, so you hear it from me.”
Harry smiled and Draco relaxed. “No, I’m not… I just…I had never met a gay person before Charlie. We grew close over the summer…he’s really cool, actually. And then Dean and Seamus came out…and I just didn’t know the wizarding world could be so…accepting…It’s definitely not like that in the muggle world.”
“Well, everyone knows I’m gay except Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. I haven’t exactly found the right time to say anything. Also, since I thought you were joking, no one knows you’re here or
Well, no. Actually, he never hated Harry. He envied Harry, he was infuriated by Harry (at times), he (though he would never admit it) admired Harry, and he…found Harry attractive.
Harry started laughing and Draco felt something pull at his heart. He always liked the way Harry laughed with his whole body. His broad shoulders moving just slightly.
It was Draco who made the comment first, “I – I don’t want the date to end. Is that…lame?” Draco looked at Harry with hope. It was still strange to hear things like that coming from the voice of Draco Malfoy.
“They’re playing Harry. You know how they get. They won’t notice we’re gone.” Draco stopped and smirked while looking at Harry. “Plus, I’ll be quick.” Harry didn’t like the look in his eyes.
Draco glared at Harry while answer, “Riding horses is difficult Potter! It isn’t just, get up on it and go! They can be…temperamental!” At this point, Harry was full-on laughing his ass off. Draco, annoyed, continued to gather his tools and stomp away towards the fence.
The words ‘arch nemesis’ rang in his head and he thought back to Ron and Hermione’s comments a couple of weeks ago.
The two went home and after dinner and bedtime, Harry retired to his room for the night. Alone with his thoughts, Harry once again replayed the conversation from the day. He hated himself for prying so much but was slightly thankful at the new information. Draco Malfoy was…gay. And single. And hot.
Harry finally moved through and went to get Teddy. The boy protested as he tried to take him home but subsided once ‘Mr. Draco’ agreed they could come back again next Saturday.
He heard the man’s footsteps coming up behind him and stayed focus on his grass and his clippers. When the man approached, Draco felt a shift in the atmosphere. There didn’t appear to be as much hostility exuding from the man today.
He knew little things like how he liked his tea in the morning and how his day was just by seeing the expression on his face when he walked through the door.
“Sorry, I just couldn’t sleep.” Noticing Charlie’s demeanor and state of dress, Harry assumed that’s why Charlie was down here as well. Harry allowed himself a quick glance over the Weasley before focusing back on his face.
Astoria cleared her throat before finishing, “And he gave me it…but then he snatched it away.” Her face returned to it’s scowl from earlier.
At first, they were dealing with the fallout from their relationship in the Prophet. Harry was right. People were pissed. And honestly, it came from both sides.
After several weeks, Harry and Draco decided on a day for Harry to come to the Manor. Honestly, Harry was terrified, but figured if he wanted to get to know Draco then this was a part of Draco as well. Not to mention, Harry was missing Draco quite a bit. At this point, he didn’t care where they met – so long as he could see him.
talking to Draco. He’s my friend, Ron. Just like you, except I can talk to him about different things. I like being around him…”
As soon as they walked in, Teddy began telling them all about his sleepover last weekend. He told them about Scorpius’ cut and all the games they played. “Yeah, and when we woke up Harry and Mr. Draco were already there. They made us breakfast!”
The day came and gone for people to leave. He stayed in his room that day for the most part, afraid it would make his depressed that he didn’t have a home to go home to for the holidays.
Winter break came fast. Before Harry knew it, he was making arrangements with Oliver for Christmas Day and packing his trunk to head home. As soon as he was back home, he began to stress about Oliver coming. He knew he had invited him, but part of him felt like maybe it was a mistake.
“You’re not THAT much older”. Harry tried to make his tone sound light-hearted and that he wasn’t internally screaming.
about his training but was beginning to be less of a prat and understood not everyone wanted to hear about every minute of his day-to-day activities. Things were feeling better – and isn’t it those times when things start to fall apart?
Harry was excited for exams to end and was mentally preparing himself to head home when a sight stopped him dead in his tracks. Harry, Hermione, and Ron had been eating in the Great Hall when Harry heard Seamus let out a whistle. When Harry looked up, he was met with seeing Dean and Ginny Weasley holding hands and kissing. Any ‘feeling better’ he had previously felt was gone.
Harry saw red. Memories started to flood into his brain of Charlie. “Why is it every time a man kisses me, he feels the needs to have a
“And I’m sorry that we haven’t talked…lately. It’s not because of what you told me or anything.” Harry was growing more and more nervous by the minute.
Harry was anxious the rest of the week. Part of him knew it was because he was going to his former nemesis now ridiculously attractive father’s house for a playdate that would invariably be awkward, but another part knew it was because of the house he would be going to…
“I…I wanted to say that I’m sorry.” Draco looked at the man before him with a confused look on his face. Shouldn’t
Harry apparated Teddy to Hermione and Ron’s the next morning before returning back to Grimmauld Place and pacing the rooms. He went over it in his head a million times what he wanted to say, but he also knew himself pretty well…he just needed to trust his gut.
Draco pushed himself off the ground and found his way to his feet before extending his hand for Harry and hoisting him up.
Harry finished with the neck and started making his way down Draco’s bare chest. Draco kept mumbling nonsense. He went between looking down at Harry and tilting his head back as if he was debating where to place his head.
“Leona mentioned that the Greengrasses weren’t Death Eaters or on Voldemort’s side during the war…how is you two came to meet? Much less marry?”
“What the hell do you mean a ‘proper family’?” Harry smiled as Draco seemed to be finally ready to have the conversation. “What’s ‘proper’ about a mother abandoning her child for four years?”
James and Lily decided to plan a get-away just for the two of them. It would act as a treat for their anniversary, while also allowing them to ship Harry off to Sirius and Remus for a week.
Draco didn’t have too long to wallow in his awkwardness before the two heard the sound of giggling girls coming around the corner. In a flash, Draco was being pulled in an alcove by a floating hand wrapped around his tie. Harry threw the cloak over the two of them and instructed Draco to stay quiet by placing his finger over his lips.
He walked into the room and laid in his bed. As soon as he heard his father’s door close for the night, Draco began to cry.
Draco really wished Harry hadn’t left him alone. But he put his best Malfoy confidence on and walked further into the living room. “Happy Christmas Weasley family”.
Draco wanted to be thankful for his light sentence, but every minute he stayed in the Manor was pure torture. Upon his return, his mother placed his door back on his room, but didn’t speak about the circumstances involving its disappearance. In fact, she hardly spoke at all.
As they were heading towards the changing room, Ron caught Harry’s attention. “Oi! You see who was at practice?”
“It’s really no bother. I was getting one for Scorpius any way.” Harry stood in the doorway as the blonde man attempted to get around him. Harry moved out of the way and ended up chest-to-chest with the man as he moved past on his way to the shop counter.
“Harry, could we maybe talk in private?” Charlie was looking directly into Harry’s eyes which did not do well for Harry’s fake attempt to be in a new relationship.
Draco decided to answer honestly, he had already shared quite a bit with Harry via letters, he knew it was safe to say more. “Yeah, I fell for a friend who ended up being straight. Well, that part is debatable, but he definitely didn’t want me.”
If his eyes had been open, he would have noticed his mother entering the room with a tray of desserts, followed closely by the rest of his family. Harry would have never known they had an audience if it wasn’t for his godfather’s whistling. Harry would be having a conversation with Sirius later.

Draco knew it was unlikely that Potter would return, but he really did hope. Draco had been pretty…aggressive about the situation. Probably too aggressive when he thought back on it. But maybe he would still show up.
crush on him back in third year.” Ron had pushed into his arm before they made their way into the room to change.
drunk he had allowed himself to get until it was too late. George had decided it would be a good idea to give toasts “to the man who is leaving to sleep with his dragons!”. Seamus and Dean went first, each giving some variation of “I don’t know you too well, mate. But I’m happy for you and I hope you never meet our girlfriends…I don’t think they would be ours for much longer.” Charlie gave a half-smile and glanced over at Harry.
Charlie stood firm and kept his eyes locked on Harry. “You know, I kind of thought you were going to be together for a while. I figured you two would be…forever, as cheesy as that sounds.”
The evening of Charlie’s arrival was filled with Molly hastily putting up decorations and preparing the Christmas meal, which still wasn’t due for another two days. Charlie and Harry kept their distance, and no one commented on the two.
farm where he had built a life for himself. No, he had no intention of leaving this place much less ever returning back to the wizarding world. And yet, he still felt his heart soar when he heard a
Harry awoke to the sound of tapping at his window and found an owl at his window. Based on the sound and the tapping of the foot in his dream, Harry laughed and assumed it was Draco’s owl. But when he opened the window, he found Normigeon, Hermione’s new owl.
Unfortunately, Harry ended up getting the answer anyway. During breakfast one morning in the Great Hall, everyone looked up at the same time because they heard a commotion happening in the entry way to the castle. Harry, Ron, and Hermione quickly followed the flood of students who were making their way to the entry way to see what was going on.
“Yes.” Was all Draco let out before his face broke into a smile. Harry could tell he had been holding it back for a while and decided to take this opportunity to rush over and kiss the man.
“I would love to, but I can’t. I’m sorry. I promised Hermione I would be over early to pick up Teddy. She and Ron have an appointment for Rose in a bit.”
“Definitely.” Harry moved into kiss Draco and the kiss heated very quickly before Harry pulled away. “I really do have to go.”
?” Harry smiled as Draco corrected himself and began to follow him into the kitchens. Harry nodded and a house elf appeared to take their drink orders.
“Right, well, still…I’m sorry Harry. I’m sorry for what happened between us and I’m sorry for what you’re going through now. That’s all I wanted to say.”
The room began to disperse and make their way back into the kitchen to prepare dessert. Oliver and Harry were left alone in the living room next to the Christmas tree.
“Draco! That’s ridiculous! You may have done some bad things, but you aren’t a bad person. Trust me, I know bad people. I killed one and I’ve been hunting them for the past two years. I wouldn’t have spoken for you if I thought you were a bad person.”
Harry thanks Teddy every day for being brought into his life. He arrived at the worst possible time, but he helped in the best possible way. It was a reason to wake up, it was a reason to stay strong, and it was a reason to move back into the Burrow and be with family. He didn’t know how much he needed it until it happened.
Hermione and Ron looked at Harry. “That sounds so fun Teddy, why don’t you go up and tell Rose all about it, huh?” Hermione looked to Teddy and ushered him towards the staircase.
“She’s a bully Hermione! And Draco is too scared to fight back, but I’m not! I don’t know this woman and frankly, I don’t give a shit about her. So, I’ll talk to her.”
The date continued this way through dinner, drinks, and dessert. Before they knew it, the check had come and gone, and they were getting ready to leave. Except it looked like neither of them wanted to…
He stood outside the wizarding bank and looked around. The city was still struggling, even a month after the war. Diagon Alley was a shell of what it once was, but it was trying. Many businesses were beginning to re-open. Several being opened by new owners, since the originals either died during the war or simply were too afraid to come back. The rest of the world seemed as if it was trying to move on; Draco thought it best if he tried too.
“Harry….you’re none of those things. You fell for someone – and they didn’t or couldn’t want you back. It happens. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt, but you shouldn’t feel foolish about it. Frankly, I’m surprised it took you this long for it to happen, but I guess fighting in a war does that to a guy.”
Harry went to bed that night still thinking of Draco. The more he fought the thoughts, the harder they pushed until he finally gave in and replayed the scene at the shop again in his head. It was during this replay that he noticed Draco was wearing muggle clothes, tight jeans and a tight black shirt that cut off at his bicep. Draco looked…good.
Draco looked his father in the eyes. “Harry Potter and I are nothing. We never were. He hates me and he always has. Like I said, I don’t know why he spoke for me, but I can assure you – it has nothing to do with the…
“Look. It’s just a playdate for our kids – nothing more.” Harry tried to drop the conversation but was met with looks. He rolled his eyes before continuing, “Fine! I find the bloke attractive! Fine I always have! Whatever! Like I said – it’s a PLAYDATE for our CHILDREN. End of story.” Harry crossed his arms and pretended to pout.
A very disoriented Harry Potter apparated almost right next to Draco. Any closer and he would have landed on him.
The boys looked at one another and took a breath before Draco finally spoke, “Harry. He’s going to talk.”
Draco smirked to himself. He knew Harry would be back, but it felt good to get him to leave so quickly this time. He finished his cutting, then made his way back to his barn to grab his feed. He made his rounds of feeding all of his animals, a task Billy loved to accompany him on.
As the party began, Harry felt everyone staring at him and Draco. He didn’t have enough time to tell Ron and Hermione about the “plan”, so he decided to just see where this all went.
“Yes a date with Draco, Ron. Who else? And…let’s have him stay the night…” Harry didn’t know why this statement made him anxious, but he once again couldn’t help his face.
Once the tea was gone, the cup disappeared and his father sat up straight in his chair, staring at his son. “You’re smart, so I trust by now you have an idea of the conversation we are about to engage in. We need to discuss the events of earlier tonight. I’ve had suspicions about your…
“Not really. I mean, yes, it’s strange to be back but…Hogwarts always felt like home to me. I thought about writing to tell you I was coming back but thought it would be more fun as a surprise.” Oliver’s smile hadn’t changed one bit. And Harry knew that smile well… Looking at Oliver had memories flooding back.
Harry hurried to finish his ice cream so he and Teddy could get out of there. Seeing Draco Malfoy, hearing that his son was told bedtime stories about him, and Teddy nearly outing him to the man was all too much for Harry at that point.
“She seems open about it now…I mean, just based on some of the comments she’s made.” Harry remarked and wanted Draco to keep talking.
Harry stayed in his room the following two weeks. Even after some of the madness had died down, he remained. He left for classes but continued to receive his food in his room – he never asked for Draco again, so Draco figured Harry just had a house elf bring it. Merlin knows the house elves would be more than happy to bring THE Harry Potter his meals.
“Right, yeah, I get that. Ginny and I didn’t date long, but she was someone to think about during everything. Someone to get back to…” Harry followed Draco’s lead and looked off as well.
Draco screamed and cast a too powerful incendio over the letter before calming down and stopping the fire. He threw himself back on the bed and buried his face in his pillow. So much for his peaceful time alone this holiday break.
“Sure, son”. Harry’s eyes grew wide. Who was this man? “Harry, I’ll write to you and we can set something up soon. You’re at Grimmauld Place, right?” Harry noticed Draco flush again.
Hermione found a date rather quickly but refused to say who it was with. This annoyed Ron and pushed him to find a date even harder.
Next thing Harry knew he was standing in the middle of a very large and very beautiful bedroom. He didn’t have much time to notice anything else before lips were once again pressed up against his. Draco took the lead this time and began to take Harry’s shirt off before moving towards his neck. He pushed Harry back onto the bed and went at his neck again.
“Teddy. This is your room and you need to be more careful. Do you hear me?” Harry looked at his godson and watched as he nodded in affirmation. The two men rose to leave the room and heard Scorpius let out a giggle and knew the two boys were back to playing as if nothing had ever happened.
. That’s what I’m supposed to say.” Harry placed his face in his hands. Why had Hermione taught his godson how to be politically correct…?
Harry dressed himself then went to grab Teddy and put some clothes on the still sleeping boy. He apparated the both of them to Hermione and Ron’s and was met with quite a site. Ron, half asleep on the couch, still in his pajamas as if he too had been awoken by Hermione (which he probably had) and a rather frazzled looking Hermione.
“My father happened, Harry. He found your letters…I had been keeping all of the letters you wrote me from the first month. I wanted to be able to go back and read them…but that was foolish. I should have been smarter about it.” Harry watched Draco’s face fall before he continued.
The entire week after their flying session, Harry refused to leave his room except for classes. Whenever he did leave his room, he was met with swarms of girls trying to make their way to him. Various boxes were left outside the eighth-year dorm with Harry’s name on it (some of which emitted odd odors that Draco took care to get rid of immediately).
“Well, Mr. Potter…what is it I can do for you? I assume this has something to do with mine and Draco’s legal situation. Which I can assure you has
The next morning, Harry awoke with the worst headache he had ever experienced in his life. It was at that precise moment that he swore-off Firewhisky for good. As he glanced around his room, he saw a small potion bottle next to him on his nightstand. There was a note that read, “Drink me, I cure hangovers”. Harry drank the vial and immediately felt relief.
“Yet! I just…this is so new and so fresh. I think that if we take it public too quickly, it could really backfire on us.” Draco hated that he wasn’t telling Harry the whole truth, but he knew he couldn’t. Not right now. Knowing Harry, and let’s face it, Draco
“Teddy – there are people behind us, love. I need you to make a decision.” His godfather always pushed him to make his decision too quickly.
But honestly, it didn’t matter what the Prophet said, Draco Malfoy didn’t deserve to be in the wizarding world anyway. He deserved Azkaban, he deserved death. And he knew that.
The conversation with Teddy went well (honestly, Harry thinks the kid might have tuned out after he said ‘Yes, that means you’ll likely see more of Draco and Scorpius), but overall – good.
When Draco walked into Hogwarts on the night before his first day of classes, he wasn’t met with the shocked faces he had expected. It seemed everyone knew he would be returning. He was, however, still met with whispers and stares as he made his way into the Great Hall for the sorting ceremony. He listened as Headmistress McGonagall gave a heart-warming speech about the ‘trials and tribulations you have all experienced as a result of the war’ and how ‘we will be striving to mend the broken relationships and prejudices that have developed as a result of this war’ and on this she made a quick look towards the near-empty Slytherin table.
As he looked around, he heard Draco say, “well, what do you think?” Harry could swear he heard some nerves in Draco’s tone.
“There’s a lot I want to say to you. I’ve been thinking about this quite a bit and I want to make sure I get it all out, so please don’t say anything until I’m finished, alright?” Harry nodded and Charlie continued, “Right, well, first I want to say I was very angry with you for outing me in front of everyone that night. We had already discussed that I wasn’t ready for all that and I thought you weren’t either. I also want to say that I was hurt that you had all of these feelings and never said anything to me about it. I thought we were on the same page, but instead you painted me out to be this heartless monster who didn’t care about you or your feelings. Which isn’t the case. I care about you very much, but I haven’t changed since that night in October. I don’t want to settle down. I can’t ever be someone’s ‘boyfriend’ much less
A comfortable silence fell upon both men as they continued to sit at the table together, each finishing their current glass. Harry eventually decided to go back to bed. He had a lot to think about and with his glasses of Firewhisky knew that the minute his head hit his pillow he would be out.
The only reason he opened his curtains later in the evening was to go and meet Draco in their usual spot. Harry had a feeling Draco probably wouldn’t show, but he hoped he would.
Harry and Draco made their way to the dining room where upon entering Harry immediately stopped dead in his tracks. Narcissa Malfoy sat at a small dining room table, sipping a cup of tea, and apparently waiting for them to join.
Harry watched as the boys ascended the stairs before turning to Draco, “Want to come in for a drink?” Draco nodded and followed Harry’s lead into the kitchen.
Because I had to. I never wanted to do any of that. And being an auror was just…a natural next step I guess?”
Draco wasn’t prepared when Harry of all people began to include him. “How are classes going for you Draco?”
“I regret using that spell every single day. I didn’t even know what it would do…Not that that’s an excuse or anything. I just…I don’t think I intentionally wanted to hurt you. And when I saw you lying there…” Harry cleared his throat and Draco thought he could see tears forming in his eyes. “I thought about you while I was away seventh year. And when we met again at the Manor…I was so relieved to see you, but I didn’t know why. Part of me was glad you were alright. Then the fire…” Harry didn’t look at Draco, which made him glad. He didn’t want to have to deal with those emotions right now. “All of the commotion of the battle and the trials and just…everything. It was a lot at the time.”
Draco tried very hard to not bite back but had had so little interaction with others that he just couldn’t help himself. “And I wonder how on earth you two managed to convince McGonagall to room you together.” Draco hoped it sounded cheeky and not mean – but he never really did learn the difference.
When they all returned for their third year, Harry noticed a change in Draco. He seemed…angrier and more aggressive. Draco became hell-bent on knocking Harry off his broom during Quidditch matches that year and his insults seemed to increase.
When he finished, he was met with silence. He finally decided to look and saw mixed faces on his parents. His mother looked…sad. Maybe it was concern. His father on the other hand was not sad. Harry honestly couldn’t figure out what the expression on his father’s face was. He watched as his father looked straight at Harry, then the floor, then around the room before slowly standing up. Harry didn’t know what to do, so he just continued to stand there. James left the room without a single word to Harry.
No one seemed to mind. On the contrary, people seemed…happy for them. Seeing them together caused something to pull at Draco. By this point, he knew he was gay. But years of dealing with his father’s ‘views’ on the matter, had left a scar.
Draco had to think things over pretty quickly. Sure, this was everything he ever wanted. He just never actually thought he could have it. He had obviously been thinking about this way longer than Harry had and unlike Harry, he didn’t just realize his sexuality…he needed to be sensitive.
Harry was torn. He definitely didn’t want to leave. Draco needed him…but it also looked like Draco really didn’t want him here.
Harry continued whatever this was with Charlie. Anytime the little feeling would make itself known in his chest he would push it away. Logical and rational Harry would take over and tell himself, “No, Harry, you don’t actually feel this way. This is the first man you’ve been with. It’s normal to feel something – but it’ll pass. It’s fine. It’s not real.” But then Charlie would look over at him, once again bare-chested and out of breath, and emotional Harry would take over. Charlie would open his arm and Harry would snuggle in. The chest would tighten, and the throat would close.
“Oh. Right. Um, I just mean, why haven’t you talked to anyone?” Draco could tell she was getting uncomfortable and likely regretting her choice in seats today.
Harry knew his godfather was right. Sirius continued, “That’s right Harry! I bet the next boy you kiss will
“And how exactly did this ‘playdate’ come about?” Hermione questioned. Harry found himself recounting in excruciating detail the events at the ice cream shop and Malfoy Manor last Saturday before finishing it off with, “Did you know Draco was gay?”.
A week ago, Harry had woken up in the middle of the night to an empty bed. He looked around and called out quietly for Draco, and still heard nothing.
But Harry didn’t love him. And he knew he might find love for him later, after spending more time with him, but he also knew this was a childhood crush. And most people never have a chance with their childhood crush, so maybe he was just trying to live-out some fantasy world his 11-year-old self had created.
“Yes! Yes of course!” Sirius knew he had scared his godson and switched his tone quickly. “I just want to make sure you know…I’m here for you. If you have any
Voldemort and several other Death Eaters moved-in to the Manor in mid-June. Draco’s father never once spoke to his son or wife about the new addition to their home – when the dark wizard arrived, it was as if it was simply expected. No conversation to be had.
The two made their way towards the stairs, still stealing kisses whenever they could. They moved down the stairs, Harry in front of Draco.
“But that still doesn’t answer the question. Why were you looking for me to begin with?” Harry looked around the farm and set his eyes on Draco’s cottage. He motioned with his hand as if to ask for them to go inside and Draco nodded. The two walked towards the cottage and inside in silence. Draco watched as Harry sat on the sofa, seemingly too comfortable with the act.
Draco couldn’t figure out the tone in his father’s voice, but something about the feeling of the room gave Draco a knot in his stomach. The room was heavy, and Draco could feel the magic creeping through the walls. He moved to sit in the chair opposite his father, but as he sat – he refused to meet his father’s eyes. He could feel them piercing into the top of his head.
The table paused for a moment before Seamus let out a roaring laugh and Dean chuckled. The two sat down as Seamus started talking, “Because we’re best
“All students are to report to their next class immediately. Any student found in this entry way in the next 2 minutes will earn one month of detention. Go.” Dumbledore released the freezing charm but kept the silencing charm up until students existed the entry way.
He thought his father would scream. Throw hexes at him, strike him down – he had done it enough times in the past, so Draco wouldn’t have been surprised. But instead – Draco was met with silence.
Malfoy. “It’s beautiful” was all he managed to get out before a house elf appeared and told them it was time for lunch.
“Potter. I will not be going back. So, if that’s all you came here for. Then you can kindly leave.” Draco gave a fake smile and turned away once more. He decided to make his way towards his cottage instead of going towards his barn and quickly tossed the clippers on the porch. He heard a sound escape his stomach and quickly remember he skipped lunch and figured it must be getting close to dinner time.
“Harry…is Mr. Draco going to be your…partner?” Harry was thankful he wasn’t drinking a beverage, or it would have just come out of his mouth.
Draco sounded breathy and like it was taking every ounce of him to say it, but Harry heard it and stopped. He looked up at the man, one hand still on his waist.
Draco quickly noticed that while he put his robe on, he didn’t actually close it. He quickly moved to fasten his robe before responding. “I was just… about to shower. What is it you need Potter?”
Harry really didn’t mind – he had grown to like the Manor and knew Teddy loved Scorpius’ playroom. But he also knew that Draco wasn’t okay.
“Then we will figure it out. I don’t want to be without you Draco. And I know you don’t want to be without me.” Before Harry could continue, Draco was already moving towards him. Draco wrapped his hand around the back of Harry’s neck and brought him in for a hard kiss. Harry could taste the tears from Draco’s face as he kissed back.
Molly looked at her son and a smile rose on her face. “Of course dear! I know that’s where your heart is. We knew you’d go back eventually, but these past few months you seemed rather happy. I’m not going to lie and say I hadn’t secretly hoped you would stay here, find a someone, maybe settle down, but I guess a mother has to let her sons go eventually…again.”
from the man? What about all the nights Harry waited for him in the tower only to be left sitting alone and miserable?
Draco turned to look at Harry who must have been wearing a concerned look on his face. Still unsure of what to say.
As much as Harry wanted to be mad at Draco…he couldn’t. Harry allowed himself to watch Draco over the next couple of weeks and began to notice how skinny Draco had gotten. He always appeared for meals but didn’t seem to eat anything. He also never saw Draco smile…even when Crabbe or Goyle would be howling at the Slytherin table, Draco would be staring off into space.
When Harry dropped to his knees he was immediately stopped. “Harry…what are you doing? You don’t have to do that.”
While getting to know Hermione, another wizard appeared at their door. He did not look as friendly. He was pale and had platinum blonde hair slicked back. He had already changed into his robes and his whole appearance terrified Harry. He introduced himself as Draco Malfoy and held out his hand for Harry to shake. Harry immediately recognized the last name. “My father says your father was a Death Eater. He says he was a follower of Voldemort and I’m not supposed to trust you. Your father lied to the Ministry and that’s the only reason he’s allowed to be free.”
Draco’s eyes went wide as he tried to acknowledge what was happening but when Harry didn’t back away Draco decided to go for it. Hell, if Harry wanted to kiss him, then he would definitely kiss him.
He watched as Ron met Hermione’s eyes. “Harry wasn’t in the room when I left – Where’s Ginny ‘Mione?” Draco secretly loved when they called her that. It was amusing for such a strong person to have such a sweet nickname.
Teddy runs straight into the father and Harry watches as the beloved ice cream cone goes straight to the ground. It splatters on both Teddy’s and the father’s shoes, but all Harry can focus on is Teddy. He knows the tears are coming and he’s already bracing himself to console his godson when the father suddenly bends down.
“Yeah, well – some things don’t change.” Harry responded, but didn’t look as if he was trying to move.
“Thanks Ron…but I know Draco really doesn’t want to use them. I think he’s honestly worried about how he’ll be treated. I know that things are different at the Ministry now, but still…”  Harry trailed off and looked down at his feet.
Well, you already said it Harry. Can’t take it back now. “Yeah. My parents won’t mind. You can at least come for Christmas day. It’ll just be me, my parents, and my godfathers. Nothing fancy or anything, but you’re welcome to come.”
The last thought that crossed Harry’s mind was the fact that his godson thought he and Draco were going to be together because he played at his house. Harry’s dating life was severely lacking if THIS is what Teddy thought a relationship looked like…
“No, Draco. This isn’t about you…well, it is. But not about you being in trouble or anything. You see, we thought we had found them all…that was until we realized that no one could account for one of them. Thorfinn Rowle.” Draco shivered at the name. He always hated that man. Of all the death eaters, Rowle for some reason lived with them at the Manor and always made Draco feel…uneasy.
He returned to the Manor and found it empty. His father was sentenced to Azkaban and even though his mother too was freed, she couldn’t handle it. She drove herself mad with worry over her husband and found herself put away in St. Mungo’s. Draco was alone. And he quickly found out that the Manor was the
And now, here they were. Seven years after the war and seven years after receiving Teddy. Things aren’t perfect, but they’re better. Harry knows he is nowhere near a perfect parent, but he works on it every day. He loves Teddy with all of his heart, but often wishes he had someone to share the work (and love) with.
Harry was scared by how much of that was true. Except for the son-in-law part, Draco had shown how privileged Harry really was.
Luckily, he didn’t have to wait long. Draco’s reply came the next morning and it carried with it an offer to meet in Diagon Alley the next weekend. Draco needed to pick up some equipment for his training and they could have lunch.
“So, I’ll show you to your room. It’s not too far from the boys – one of us should be close, just in case.” Draco gave a smirk and followed Harry down the hall to another room.
Harry had seen the man, he never changed. He always wore all black robes (similar to Draco’s in fourth year – immaculate, cost a fortune) and carried an intimidating walking stick. His hair was the same color as his son’s, but he wore his long and allowed it to frame his face in a way that made him look even more intimidating than he already did.
When they broke apart, Draco continued to hold Harry. “You have to be strong Draco. If this is what you want, then you have to fight for us.” Harry spoke in a whisper.
and swooped in and snatched it right out of his face?!” Oliver noticed Harry’s face drop at the mention of Draco.
Harry paused. When he thought back on it, two things really upset and scared him in that moment. “The word they called my Sirius and Remus…it’s a bad word, a really hurtful word. That caused me to get really upset. But I also can’t stop thinking about what happened with my magic…dad, I didn’t even say a spell. I don’t even think I was going to cast one! It just came out of nowhere!”
Below the information was what looked like an address and more statistics about the coach. Harry looked up at Oliver, “I…I don’t understand.”
Thanks for everything?! Really Harry?! That’s what you want to say?! Harry screamed at himself inside his head but made sure that his face remained neutral.
“Harry. I – I want to do…this. It’s just…” Draco paused, and Harry turned around to look at him before finishing the statement for him “just not right now.”
Harry was terrified, but ecstatic. He didn’t care what anyone had to say about their relationship – well, anyone except Hermione and Ron.
Charlie looked startled by the severity of the question and looked down at the glass in his hand. “Yes and no. I wanted to be back with the family. We’ve all been through so much and I’ve had to miss a lot because of my job – this is where I need to be.”
His father didn’t make eye contact with him, simply said, “It’s an honor Draco.” All while continuing to stare at the table.
“Draco, huh? This couldn’t be the same Draco from Hogwarts… could it? No – of course it couldn’t. That Draco was your ‘nemesis’, your ‘foe’, your…
After they gathered the treats for the sheep and his new gloves, they made their way towards the produce and vegetable stands. When Draco took out his reusable bag, he thought Harry was going to have a fit.
He decided to get up out of bed and go down to the fireplace in the common room. He was chilly and in this moment all he could think about was laying in front of the fireplace, maybe reading a book and enjoying his peace and quiet.
They laid there until the sun came up and Charlie decided Harry should make his way back to his room before people saw him coming out of Charlie’s room and begin their questions. Harry really didn’t want to leave, but he knew Charlie was right. He went back to his room, laid in his own bed, and felt a strange mix of emotions. He was so happy about the night he had just experienced, but he was worried about the way leaving Charlie made him feel. Laying in his own bed and listening to Ron’s snores made him feel alone and uncomfortable – he wanted to be back in Charlie’s arms and snuggled up against that bare-chest. This couldn’t be good…
“We have a meeting with Dumbledore to discuss some items for the Hogwarts School Board’s next meeting.” Draco soon noticed his mother was standing right behind his father.
“My father had a lot of expectations for me. They started when I was very young, and they impacted the way I interacted with people. I allowed his prejudices to infiltrate my own mind and his views became mine. As I got older, he became clear about what he wanted from me – get married. Carry on the Malfoy name.” Draco scoffed, “some name to carry on…” Draco couldn’t believe he was talking like this in front of Harry Potter.
He figured it was nothing. Likely just because of the fact that the prat was everywhere – defeating dragons, using advanced magic, rescuing people from the Black Lake…soaking up all the glory.
“Of course I love you Harry. But it isn’t that simple.” As terrible as this conversation was, there it was – Draco did love him.
“You have to come back.” Draco stared at Harry and blinked his eyes a few times. Surely, he misheard the man.
Without warning or saying goodbye to anyone, Harry quickly ran out of the Burrow and apparated to Malfoy Manor. He was so anxious that he knocked on the door rather furiously, bouncing on the balls of his feet until he saw the door open.
As Harry finished reading the letter, he grew nervous. A pub. In Diagon Alley. Clearly Draco wasn’t thinking this through. The Boy Who Lived can’t just show up for a date in Diagon Alley with a former Death Eater… Shit.
Lily must have spoken with her husband that night because when Harry came down to breakfast the next morning, James was ready to talk.
Harry spent the remainder of the feast alternating between trying to catch Draco’s attention and trying to
So, that was it. Two years after the war and Draco Malfoy now lived among livestock in the English countryside in a muggle village in the Lake District. No magic, very little money, and even less people.
It had been two weeks since Harry up and left. Draco went through all of the emotions he possibly could. First, there was anger. Anger at how dumb he was to actually believe…well, he didn’t know what he actually believed… but he was dumb for it! Second, there was frustration and confusion. Why would Harry possibly think Draco would or even
Draco didn’t think they would ever take him in after some of the terrible things he said to them. But Arthur and Molly chalked it up to him being young and impressionable and quickly forgave.
Harry smiled. “I wasn’t sure at first…People told me I was crazy. That I had another obsession or something.”
The rest of dinner went by without ceremony, as did their retreat to the eighth-year dorms. The only item of note was when Ginny asked Harry to walk her to her dorm and he turned her down with a ‘I’m quite tired actually, I really should get to bed’. Draco wanted to make a comment about it only being 8 but thought it best to keep to himself.
These were the thoughts going through Harry’s head as he sat at breakfast one morning with Ron and Hermione. In an act of deja-vu, Ginny approached the table with her usual, “Did you hear the rumor?” except there was no excitement in her voice. Instead, she sounded…torn. And she looked directly at Harry.
No matter what he did, he always found Draco Malfoy staring at him. The boy would find any excuse to insult Harry. When the three of them would walk down the hallway, Harry could hear Draco whispering “mudblood” and “blood traitor”. But Harry always tried his best to stay strong. He could hear Sirius’ voice in his head, “Never stoop to a bully’s level. That’s how they win.”
So maybe that’s why his mind was starting to wander towards his former nemesis. He always did find him rather attractive…a git, but an attractive git. And now, there was no denying it, Draco Malfoy was hot. Fatherhood suited him very well…
” Something about the way Blaise said his first name made him very uncomfortable. Draco’s eyes caught Harry and immediately looked terrified.
Harry watched as her mask faltered for a split second before she fought back – her eyes never leaving Draco. “Well, like I said…we’ll see Draco.”
“I’m sorry Harry, so much has happened and I’m going back to Hogwarts – you’re staying here. It’s best if we remain…friends. And besides Harry, I don’t think you and I had the right feelings for one another. I’ve thought about this quiet a lot actually and I think I always loved you more than you loved me. And that’s okay. I’m not upset about it…well, not anymore.”
“Draco. This is not okay. She can’t talk to you like that! You can’t believe any of that!” Harry was yelling and growing more and more frustrated that Draco wasn’t more upset.
“This isn’t a good time, Malfoy. Why don’t you go back to the castle?” Oliver’s voice grew confrontational.
“It’s quite alright Mrs”, Oliver stopped and was met with a hard stare from Lily before continuing, ”…
He found Draco and Teddy at the table, drinking hot chocolate and smiling. Teddy and Draco both looked exhausted and barely looked up when Harry came in.
Draco gave a scowl that quickly turned into a smile before answering, “I thought I was alone. I didn’t see anyone else on the stay back list.”
Lily inhaled, “Well, then we will figure it out. I’ll talk to your father.” She hugged her son one last time before she too walked out the room.
“So – what are you doing with the letter and the owl?” Hermione was looking at Harry, but once Harry smirked Hermione grew concerned.
Hermione continued, “I just think that…I think it would be a good show of unity. You know? Like, we’re putting things in the past. Moving forward.” There was the determination he knew.
The night before students were set to return, Draco sat at his desk and repeated this mantra to himself.
Hoping they wouldn’t be talking about Harry’s embarrassing attempt at a kiss a few weeks ago, Harry took this as an opportunity to ask what he had been wanting to ask, “Draco, what made you go into healing?”
“Based on your father’s expression, I don’t think this is the end of this Draco. But it’s a start.” Harry moved to hold his boyfriend. Before moving back towards their class.
of ours! Isn’t that right, Ron?” George nudged his brother in the arm and almost died of laughter watching his face turn red.
“Draco, I wanted to say I’m sorry for the way I handled things the last time I was here. I’m also sorry that I never wrote you back. I read every single letter you sent me. Most of them I read multiple times. I ran because I was scared. I knew you were right; I wasn’t ready. But all I kept thinking to myself was that you didn’t want me and didn’t want to be with me. I hadn’t allowed myself time to actually process all you had said.”
Draco grew uncomfortable and nervous at the prospect of having to tell Harry, ‘Actually, that’s because I’ve had a crush on you for many
Once his family had enough, Harry walked Oliver out the door and down the pathway towards the street.
“Well, we couldn’t pick just one godfather for you. So, we gave you two”. Lily looked at her son and could tell this was not exactly what Harry was asking.
the Malfoys – and so do you! They were Death Eaters during the war Harry! They KILLED people!” On some level, Harry knew this was all true and a year ago he would have agreed with his friend, but now…things didn’t feel the same.
“Exactly.” Harry smiled and was thankful that the diversion worked. He watched as the younger boy’s eyes lit up as his father came back towards them with ice creams in his hand. Harry stood up and was in shock as the man handed one to him.
Neither spoke in this moment. They stared at each other for longer than was necessary and Draco brought his mind back to Sprout and the sound of mandrakes to keep his body in check.
“Sorry mate, I just didn’t know this was where this was heading. I mean, I’m happy for you, but I thought it would be some sort of quick hook-up or more flirting/pining from across the Great Hall. Not actual…dating.” All good points and things Harry had already thought about.
When the day came for the match against Ravenclaw, Harry was all nerves. He tried to focus on the game but kept distracting himself by finding Oliver in the stands – smiling. When the match was over and he got the snitch, Harry descended on his broom and met his team with yells of triumph and hugs.
“Harry! You didn’t tell us Oliver was back at Hogwarts with you this year!” James turned to look at his son. Harry couldn’t help but notice the comment, ‘at Hogwarts
When they were mid-way down the staircase they were stopped in their steps by a, “Daddy! Mr. Harry! Is Teddy here?”.
Harry smiled and walked towards it. He moved his hand over the sofa and Draco watched in shock as he transformed it into a twin sized bed, equipped with pillows and blankets.
Saturday morning came and Draco began. He woke up lazily and began to journey down his stomach and into his pants. He conjured up images of a half-naked man down the hall, coming into his room.  But right as the images became clear and the man began to climb into his bed and explore his body – there was a knock at the door.
He looked down at the two with a question on his face. Draco simply smiled and shook his head as if to say, ‘not now’. Harry left the two and went back to their bedroom only to be joined by Draco a few minutes later.
Harry felt he could no longer hold back. His emotions felt more out of control than they ever did in the past. One day, after leaving Defense Against the Dark Arts, Harry felt Draco run into him. Draco walked ahead with his two goons intact – Crabbe and Goyle. Draco made a point to turn around and say “Watch it Potter! Don’t need you up against me like some poof.” Draco and his friends let out a hard laugh.
When it was done, Harry laid on his back and stared up at the ceiling. He felt…the same, but different. He turned to look at the man next to him, who laid bare-chested and out of breath. Charlie was smiling as he turned to look at Harry. That’s when Harry felt it. His chest felt tight and he felt like he had a lump in this throat. This whole night had been experiences he had never had or felt before. He knew this couldn’t be good but when Charlie opened his arm up for Harry, Harry snuggled in and fell asleep on his chest.
He heard what sounded like a sniffle and figured that behind that door he would find him. Draco knocked on the door and heard a faint “come in”.
Draco soon realized that Harry hadn’t actually brought a snitch for them to play with and quickly pieced together that Harry only wanted it to be the two of them. Draco felt his chest warm.
emphasis on the benefits. And they were great benefits…top notch really.” Harry could feel his face flushing and Draco gave a devilish grin.
Draco thought he might have overstepped with his jab at Harry during dinner. But as they were finishing up, Harry looked at Draco and said, “Want to grab our brooms and go out to the quidditch pitch?”
“Harry. I feel like we should talk. The things he said…” Harry could tell Draco was struggling to say what he wanted to say.
“Harry doesn’t have a wife. Uncle Ron has wife, that’s Aunt Hermione. And Uncle Bill has a wife, that’s Aunt Fleur. But Harry doesn’t have a wife.”
He made his way towards the door and turned back, “I’m going to tell Hermione and Ron tomorrow when they get back. We can talk tomorrow night about how it goes.”
Harry couldn’t control himself and his mouth fell open in surprise while his godfather continued. “We’ve known for a while…”. Sirius laughed and added on “Yeah, we’ve known since you were 11 and wouldn’t stop talking about that Quidditch boy! What was his name Remus? Chestnut or something?”
The first night back was slightly awkward, but Draco quickly realized that the rest of the eighth years felt as he did – let’s just get through this. They all retired to their dorm that night and took a quick tour before finding their rooms. No one questioned when Draco had his own room, the same way Draco didn’t question Harry and Ron rooming together. It was just how it was supposed to be.
Remus and Sirius looked at each other and shared a look that Harry figured meant they were communicating without speaking. When they finally broke their gaze, Sirius looked at Harry.
“Mate. Okay, the first two years I understood. I thought he was a genius at Quidditch too. His speeches were really…moving. But third year…Harry you cried when he left. Like, actual tears. Then tried to give us some lame excuse like ‘the team is just going to really change without him’.” Harry rolled his eyes as Ron pretended to cry into his hands.
He was so lost in his own thoughts that he failed to hear someone calling his name from behind him. It wasn’t until hands were on his shoulders that he even realized someone was there.
“I told her everything. I told her how I felt, I told her she couldn’t have him, even though I feel as though I’ve said that a million times by now, but I also told her we could work out a joint custody situation. I told her I really didn’t want to use lawyers…” Draco stopped.
Harry looked relieved that Draco was finally speaking. “I…We need to talk. It’s important.” Draco looked at Harry with fear in his eyes.
“No, mother lives here as well, but I built her a separate wing during the remodel. She can come and go as she pleases, and she likes to be near Scorpius.” Draco took a sip of his drink. “What about you? Is it just you and Teddy in that big place?”
have to do with me. You see, I’m Draco’s partner. We are together, whether you like it or not and that means I care deeply about his happiness. I also care greatly for Scorpius and I believe he deserves a good home. Which he already has.” Harry felt his confidence boiling up.
When all of the Death Eaters were rounded-up after the war and brought to Azkaban to await trial, Draco didn’t fight it. He deserved punishment. He deserved the Dementor’s Kiss.
Once the line went down and they were towards the front, he could see it. A beautiful display case filled with flavors of ice cream that seemed never ending. Each flavor seemed to be giving off a different smell that permeated through the case and out into the store. Teddy couldn’t be happier.
“No. And I don’t want to talk about it. You and dad can sleep easy knowing your son is safe from the evil Malfoy family.” He bitterly shot back at his mother before removing himself from the table.
“You…you okay?” He finally took a good look at the man. Cheeks flushed, hair even more a mess than usual, and shirt wrinkled beyond repair.
Silence fell over both of them and they returned to their work. Draco’s mind continued to think of how he was going to tell Harry and how the three of them could possibly fix this situation. Hermione, on the other hand, kept focused on her work while giving Draco looks of pity and curiosity for the remainder of their time together.
“That’s all you heard! Out of all that – THAT’S what you choose to comment on?! Where were you Draco?”
He had been bracing himself for it so much that when evening came and he heard a knock at the door, he jumped in fright. He opened the door and found a Harry Potter with absolutely no emotion on his face. Weird…
“He – he knows I have a son. And he knows I was married before…but I didn’t think it right to tell him all the…
Remus continued, “You know the story well by now, but we started off as friends and it blossomed from there. My heart soared when I was with him and hurt when I was without.” Harry smiled and turned his attention toward his other godfather who looked ready to chime in.
Harry accompanied Draco into a little shop towards the end of Diagon Alley that Harry never even knew existed. He watched as Draco carefully picked up vials of potions and various other items Harry didn’t recognize. As he watched Draco glide around the store and eventually check-out with the short witch behind the counter, Harry realized for the first time that Draco was….gentle. Not delicate. Definitely not delicate. Harry had encountered the man enough times to know that Draco could be spiteful and harsh when he wanted to. But this Draco. This Draco was smiling and charming. He handled bottles like they were precious creatures, he analyzed books like they were going to break, and he walked so slowly around the shop that Harry wondered if he even knew what he was there for. When Draco collected what he needed and went to the counter, Harry swore he could see the witch behind the counter blush from something Draco said to her. He could also swear he saw the witch watch Draco has he walked away from the counter.
“Look at the name, Harry.” Harry looked under the headline ‘Our Savior Or Our Enemy?’ and didn’t even have time to roll his eyes before seeing the name
But Draco was okay with it. And that means something. The person he’s with doesn’t mind being seen with him or having the world know they’re together – and that feels really
“Anything interesting?! He’s a person! He doesn’t have to do anything interesting! He doesn’t owe anyone anything! That
Harry was having a lot of feelings about the interaction in the bathroom. For some reason, Harry really liked the idea that Draco was gay. It made Harry feel…less alone. He knew his friends supported him, but there something about knowing someone else was like him, that made him feel…right.
Harry grabbed Draco’s face in his hands and looked directly back at him, “This is my issue because it’s your issue. I love you, Draco Malfoy.”
“No!” Harry raised his voice, but quickly corrected himself, “Well…I guess yeah. But not like you’re thinking. I didn’t regret the kiss…or I did? I don’t…I don’t know.” Draco was growing confused and frustrated. He had already spent the rest of his holiday depressed and trying to move past this kiss, and now here Harry was saying he regretted it but didn’t regret it. It was too much.
Astoria narrowed her eyes as if she was thinking deeply about what Harry had said. “When Draco and I got together, we were happy. I knew what he had done in the war, but I also knew, like you claim to Mr. Potter, that that wasn’t all he was. He was kind and caring and smart and funny. He was everything I wanted…” Astoria paused as if she was catching herself getting too emotional. “He promised me a family…a happy life. That’s all I wanted for myself. I wanted to be a wife, and a mother, and be happy…”.
Harry didn’t know what to say. Luckily, Oliver spoke for him, “Well, sir, that’s up to Harry. But I know he wasn’t sure what he wanted to do after Hogwarts. I wanted him to know he had…options. It’s just a tryout – nothing’s solid.”
“Thick-headed? Ignorant? Close-minded?” Draco was honestly just trying to be helpful, but the glare Harry shot back told him he wasn’t.
Harry couldn’t even imagine what that must have been like. And to raise a child on your own when their mother is still alive. What’s Draco going to do when Scorpius gets older and starts asking questions? What’s he going to say?
And on that note, Draco began to walk away. It was in this moment that he realized he despised his father, and always would. But it was also in this moment that he realized – he was free.
“Oh, come on. There must be something I can do. I have nothing else to do today and I’m already here” Harry waved his arms around the room as to suggest Draco had forgotten Harry Potter was sitting at his dining table, “might as well put me to use.” And the not-so-boyish grin that occupied Harry’s face now should not have been as attractive as it was.
The incident earned him two months of detention and no Quidditch. It also earned him a letter home which made Harry feel even worse than the Quidditch. He knew his father would be disappointed, but worse, he knew his godfathers would be disappointed.
Draco was still smiling as he looked back down at the letter, “She said that she had a conversation with someone close to me and realized Scorpius and I were happy here. She said she was sorry for how she acted and was just scared and jealous.” Draco got quiet and looked down before continuing, “I didn’t do right by her Harry…” Draco trailed off and looked sad again.
As if on cue, Draco rustled and turned to face Harry. “Good morning” he said with sleep still stuck in his voice.
“Yeah, well, he played for Puddlemere too. The break-up wasn’t pretty so I felt it was time to find my place elsewhere. And my Quidditch mates took sides…well, took a side – his. So, here I am.”
“No, I left because I didn’t know what to do after my impulse. In the moment, it felt like the right thing to do. But after…” Harry trailed off and part of Draco’s heart sank. Harry had regrets.
“Oh…Billy. I-I’ll go…” Harry stood to leave, and Draco couldn’t help but laugh at the misunderstanding.
He looked around at the grand home. He looked at his bedroom, at the dining room, at the study and the library. He went into the garden and gave it one final look. Then it was decided. He would leave.
Harry knew he should be happy to be home. It was honestly his favorite place in the world. But right now, in this moment, he couldn’t bring himself to be happy. He had moved past hurt and back to angry. Once again angry at himself for feeling these stupid feelings and angry at himself for feeling jealous of
Draco paused and decided to sit opposite Harry. He looked down and placed his hands in his lap. “We need to talk.”
Harry was immediately reminded of the treacle tart flavor from the ice cream shop. “Merlin! Ron was right!” Harry exclaimed to a rather shocked Draco. “You were pining at me from across the Great Hall!”
Harry felt anger rush over him as Astoria glanced his way. Better than what, exactly? Draco’s the best father he knows, and he knows shitty father-figures. His uncle could give Lucius Malfoy a run for his money. But Draco? Draco is perfect.
But once someone in town told him that after a sheep’s wool was used up, farmers would kill them for their meat…he couldn’t. He wouldn’t.
“Well, Draco, if there’s nothing more you need from me, I suppose I should get going. It was so nice to finally meet you Mr. Potter.” Harry smiled at the woman and replied, “You as well.” She walked towards the door and shot Harry once last smile before leaving.
“True. But haven’t you seen the flock of students lining up to date me? I’m very sought after you know.” Draco kept a serious face for as long as possible before cracking into a smile.
“I’ve got a new friend! I’m going to his house tomorrow!” Teddy screamed out as soon as they walked into Hermione and Ron’s that evening.
Harry let out a breathy, “Um, yeah.” Before smiling and looking back at Draco, “Yeah – definitely bisexual. And I definitely like you.” Draco smiled back.
“And Mr. Teddy will have the... blueberry with…chocolate and…sprinkles?” The wizard seemed less sure of this one.
“May I be excused? I’m really not feeling well.” Harry pushed his chair back and placed his hand on stomach in an attempt to look sick.
A very excited Scorpius was squirming and giddy beside a shocked and knowing Leona Greengrass. “Scorpius, let’s go to the kitchen and fix you something to eat.” The woman began to usher the child towards the kitchens all the while still staring at Draco and Harry.
The man took his own personal tour of the house which only made Draco roll his eyes more. Of course Harry Potter feels entitled to walking around his house without permission.
Late in the evening, he decided to make his way to the library for a change of scenery. He moved down the staircase and began to head towards the library door before he was stopped by whispers coming from the dining area. He knew a meeting was taking place, so he decided to quietly listen-on on what was so important that his father felt it best he wasn’t involved.
“Has Mr. Draco sent anything yet?” Teddy bounced in his seat as he held his fork in his hand, hair flashing various colors.
“If he’s your uncle, he’s mine too, right? We’re brothers…right?” Scorpius no longer sounded as sure as he did earlier.
Desperate to change the conversation, Narcissa began asking Harry about his new job at the Ministry. Apparently, Draco had been talking about him quite a bit…interesting.
“She came because of the Prophet article. She isn’t here to get Scorpius, she’s here because she doesn’t agree with us! Don’t you dare let her take him!” Draco looked at Harry and Harry could see the anger forming in his eyes.
When Charlie walked through the door the whole Weasley family crowded around him, like they usually did. Harry stood off to the side. He wasn’t interested in talking with Charlie. He wasn’t interested in partaking in the “family joy” at the moment. Even though it had been over a month since he had last seen Draco, he found his mind wandering to him several times throughout the day. He had even purchased him a Christmas present in a moment of emotional turmoil when he was in Diagon Alley last week.
Draco could feel Harry’s anxiety growing next to him. The tension between the two was mounting and growing uncomfortable. He wanted to shake Harry and tell him, “Just say what you want to say!”. But as soon as he turned to face Harry and shake the man, Harry moved forward and kissed him.
of their money. There wasn’t much left to ruin. This meant it didn’t matter what Draco did with his life. It didn’t matter if he found a wife, produced an heir, none of it mattered… so maybe that meant he didn’t have to. Maybe that meant he too could have a relationship like Dean and Seamus…obviously not anytime soon – he didn’t know anyone else at Hogwarts who was gay and even if he did, he doubted anyone would date
Draco had spent too many years feeling shameful for his feelings, he wasn’t going to let Harry feel the same.
Harry smiled and answered ‘yes’. Both men went to their respective rooms, changed, and went down to a near-empty Great Hall. Draco thought the meal would be awkward. They had never eaten just the two of them together, but quickly found they had a lot to talk about it. They started with safe topics – school, homework, etc. Then ventured towards quidditch and back to school again.
to do with you. So I can’t imagine why you thought this meeting would be a good idea.” Her tone was so dismissive it was infuriating.
“I…wanted to talk to you. About that night in the changing room.” Harry paused and saw Oliver’s face drop to the ground.
After a rather heated argument between him and his father about Harry’s “attitude”, Harry finally snapped. He broke down crying in the middle of the kitchen and didn’t stop until his mother hugged him and brought him to sit down in the living room.
He went to take the letter from the owl and quickly realized how early it was. The sun was barely up, why was Hermione writing him so early…?
“Our situation, Dean? It was one kiss. You didn’t like it and that was that.” Harry couldn’t help the bitterness that was rising in his voice. For some reason, talking to Dean and hearing Dean’s
They worked side-by-side for a majority of the afternoon. Sometimes in silence. Sometimes in mundane conversation. But it was half-way through the re-painting that Harry finally decided to speak about what he apparently came here to talk about.
After the end of his second year, the novelty of going to school with the Boy-Who-Lived had worn off and Harry was grateful. For the most part, people stopped staring at him and asking for his autograph. Everyone treated him as a normal person.
Harry couldn’t help but notice a change in Draco over the two weeks they were together. Draco seemed…happier and more content. There had always been hostility in Draco – even when he wasn’t throwing insults at people, Draco seemed uncomfortable and angry. But this Draco seemed more relaxed. Harry suspected Draco and Blaise had gotten back together, but really didn’t want to know the answer to that for sure.
Draco couldn’t be sure what time he went to bed last night nor what time it was now. The only thing he could be sure of was that he heard the sound of several voices coming in through the common room. Figuring people must be coming back from their holiday, Draco brought himself out of bed and decided to get dressed and greet everyone.
“Look, Potter – let’s just get it out there. Thank you for speaking on behalf of my mother and me. You certainly didn’t have to, and yet you did it anyway – because you’re…
“Yes, that makes sense. Ron says he wishes he had a Sirius and Remus. I think he’s jealous.” Harry grinned from ear to ear. Lily smiled lovingly at her son and waited for more questions. When they didn’t come, she looked away from her son and continued to smile.
Astoria’s face grew cold, “I left because I couldn’t be near you. All I wanted was a family. The family
By the time his fifth year came around, Harry knew he couldn’t fool himself any longer. His obsession with Oliver Wood, his fascination with Cedric Diggory, and now his
“Draco, what are we doing?” Harry didn’t really understand why he was whispering, but felt it was what he should be doing.
Draco spent his days trying to keep himself occupied. He fed his animals, swam in the lake, cut his grass, and ventured in to town. He was in the middle of doing one of his favorite activities, brushing his horse, when he heard it.
After a rather intense conversation about what they hoped for their future, post-Hogwarts, Harry felt a rush wash over him. He slowly moved towards Dean, looked him in the eye, and went for it. He felt his lips latch on to Dean’s before Dean quickly pulled away. The look on Dean’s face will be etched into Harry’s memory forever. It looked like he had just made the biggest mistake of his life and had been caught doing it. Harry’s mind went blank and just stared at the beautiful, shocked boy in front of him.
