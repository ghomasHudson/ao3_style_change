"Seriously though, Draco. What are you gonna do?" Blaise asks as they enter the now empty common room.
"I've not given up. I'm doing my work, Professor, I just- It's hard to focus." Harry says quietly and McGonagall nods.
"So when did it happen, how did it happen, what exactly happened?" She gushes before stopping. "Nope. First things first. I told you so! Now answer my questions." She grins, grabbing Draco's forearm.
"People are none of your concern, Harry. You need to worry about yourself now. Which is why, should you want to, Poppy and I have arranged a Healer, therapist is his official title I think, from a muggle hospital in London to see you. It can be once a week, once a month, every day, however often you choose, and it can be here or at the hospital, wherever will make you comfortable. Do you think it would help?" McGonagall says. Sirius used to tell Harry he wished he had a sort of therapist for his PTSD. Vernon and Petunia always said that people that need therapists were freaks, but Harry knows it would probably help him, and if Sirius was strong enough to admit he needed one then so was Harry. He nods.
"You need to stop feeling guilty, mate." Seamus says, wrapping his arm around Harry's shoulder. The boys never care about being close, probably because they're Gryffindors and don't care what other people think. Ron is always a bit weird about it but Seamus, Dean and Harry don't care.
"I'm afraid so." And he sounds genuine but Harry isn’t sure Draco is aware of how damaged he is. Of how hard it is to deal with him. How hard it is to love him.
"Then- I- I think I want to do it. It'd be nice to have a distraction other than school work. And I miss it. A lot." Harry says and McGonagall smiles.
"How about we just tell a few people? See how it goes?" Harry offers and Draco smiles slightly and it makes Harry's heart jump.
"That's the spirit." Blaise says and Harry notices Draco pointedly not looking at him and wonders if there's something wrong. He just shrugs.
"Today I need you to tell me what each of the potions on your tables are and then select one to replicate, obviously some of these can't be made in one day but just get as far as you can. You can smell and inspect the potion, you must not drink any." Harry sighs, glancing at the 7 bottles on the table. He writes the numbers 1-7 on his parchment before glancing at the first bottle. Veritaserum. He's seen enough of it to know immediately what it is. The second is Wolfsbane and the third is Felix Felicis. He picks up the fourth and smells it to confirm it's confusing concoction. The fifth could be one of two, so he smells that one too. It smells like broomstick wax and the air after a storm with a slight flowery smell. Amortentia.
Sunday morning sees a quidditch game between Ravenclaw and Slytherin end with a 230-70 win for Slytherin, and the teams soaked by the end of the match due to the heavy rain. Draco kept his eyes peeled, but there was no sign of Harry, and even though he knew Harry wouldn't show up at lunch he still looks out for him. After searching the places Harry usually vacates, he makes his way to the tower, sure he'll find Harry there. He doesn't, and now he's worried. He didn't see him jogging, so he must be somewhere in the castle. Draco is rounding a corner on the fourth floor, near a corridor that's unused, when he hears music. He walks round a few corners before he sees Harry sat on a deep windowsill with his guitar, singing a song Draco doesn't know but he knows Harry is amazing at playing guitar and his voice is heavenly.
"Trust me." He whispers, walking backwards and slowly leading Draco by the hands up the stairs to the bedroom Harry sleeps in, their clothes long forgotten in a heap on the front room floor.
"A black dragon with green eyes surrounded by narcissus flowers." Harry says and she rolls her eyes.
Draco sees Hermione walking alone, probably on her way to or from the library, on Friday midday. It's been 3 weeks since he first comforted Potter and his curiosity is killing him.
"How are we meant to get through Honeydukes without Mrs. Flume seeing us?" He asks and Harry turns back to looks at him and grins.
Harry slides his hands down to Draco's waistband and untucks his shirt before sliding his hands under the fabric and moving them up Draco's back, feeling every scar and bone and muscle as he moves back to kissing him. Draco's hands are tugging and threading and gripping at Harry's hair and he high key loves it. Draco kisses across Harrys jaw and to his ear.
"I mean sure my parents were good to me and they loved me and stuff but I spent my childhood hearing my death eater father talking about the dark lord and how it was despicable that a baby defeated him and trying to think of ways to make him return. My mother was constantly living in fear of doing anything wrong that would upset or anger my father. I was raised to be a proper pure blood son. I was raised to be a death eater. My house was constantly full of my fathers death eater friends." Draco explains, sighing in defeat, before adding, "I've never told anyone that." Harry shuffles closer to him and watches Teddy who is lying on the floor, holding his bear above his head and giggling sleepily.
"You worried about me, Draco?" He jokes, knowing full well Draco is not happy about Harry putting himself at risk.
"I shouted at Ron. They don't want me around anymore cause apparently I'm always sad and bring the tone down." Harry mumbles but his voice is void of emotion and he's staring straight ahead. Blaise stays quiet to see if Harry wants to continue, and when he doesn't Blaise frowns.
"Thanks, see you later." He says, slightly awkward, and just as he's about to turn and go back to his table Blaise stops him.
"Harry someone's gonna see." Draco says; they're in a secluded corner but someone could still see them.
So I'm kind of having a shit day. I know I complain in almost every chapter I update, but today's been rough, so if you don't mind I'm going to have a big old rant in this notes box. You don't have to read it. I've had quite a few patients die this week. Some of COVID-19, some not. And most of the time when a patient dies it's one I don't really know too well. This week nearly every patient that died is one I've known well and genuinely cared about. Today I had to call patients like usual, and I spoke to a 75 year old woman, who is scared to death of COVID, and I had to try and convince her to go to the hospital I work at just for a blood test to make sure her Kidney doesn't fail. She knows it could kill her to leave her house, and she'd rather die at home with her family of kidney failure than alone in hospital with COVID. It feels like I'm blackmailing patients, and it makes me feel so shit, because if I was them I would also not want to leave my house. They're scared, and I'm basically forcing them to do something that could kill them, so if they get COVID during a visit to the hospital I made them attend, and they die from it, then am I indirectly killing them? Cause that's what it fucking feels like. And I think today it just got to me, and I don't know if it's because I'm super tired right now, or because I'm on a new pill and it's messing with my hormones, or just because COVID shit has been going on for so long now that I'm just sick of it, but I just had a full on breakdown. Anyways, I hope you're all having a good day, and if you're not, just know I'm right there with you, and hopefully, it will get better <3
"Of course." Draco says to McGonagall, who smiles slightly at the two of them before turning and walking down the hall.
"Mate, are you sure this is a good idea?" Ron asks, his voice also softer, and he sits in the chair next to him. Harry shakes his head and Ron sighs. Harry is excited about flying and playing again, but he is so terrified to be playing in front of the whole school. He already has enough attention on him as it is, and he's also scared for tryouts. He has no idea who will turn up, and he knows McGonagall is going to filter them very carefully, but people will still turn up to watch or just as a laugh, and Harry isn't sure he can deal with it.
"You poor little pure-blood. Ship is a muggle term, if you think two people would make or are a perfect couple you ship them. It basically means you think they're perfect for each other and you want them to be in a relationship." Harry explains.
"Weasley? What- Is Harry okay?" He asks and that one question is enough to show Ron that he loves Harry as much as Harry loves him. Harry was the first thing he thought of, and Ron appreciated it.
"Dumbledore made them. I wanted to go and live with my godfather. Dumbledore would have gone mad, though, and Sirius was the ministry's most wanted so he was in hiding."
"What's wrong, pup?" Sirius asks, sitting on the bed next to him, and Harry whimpers when Sirius pulls him into a hug.
"Love you too 'Mione." Harry turns around to say, walking backwards so he can wink at her cheekily, and before he turns back around he sees her roll her eyes at him.
The three of them split up when they reach the forest so they can cover more ground, and they're about to lose hope when Luna sees a clearing in the trees.
"I think I'm gonna head to the library, but thank you, Seamus." Harry mumbles, and the two of them make their way out of the classroom before going their separate ways.
They start walking side by side, Harry breathing deeply, trying to calm down, and Draco glancing at him every once in a while to make sure he's okay.
"Then think of a person. A person that makes you happier than you've ever felt." He says and Draco smiles.
"It's dinner time." He says, and Harry finally opens his eyes, locking them with Draco's, giving him a pleading look.
"It's alright, Sirius. My parents have already decided you're going to live here." He says and Sirius chuckles.
"Give us a spin, Harry!" Seamus calls and Harry chuckles at his childish behaviour. Harry holds his arms out to the sides and slowly turns around so everyone in the hall can see his tattoos.
"What did Seamus say?" Hermione asks and Harry shrugs. He knows he's being kind of rude and not at all helpful, but he can't bring himself to talk to them. He also really doesn't want to mention what happened with Seamus, not that he's ashamed of Seamus or what happened, it's just that he's only been back at Hogwarts for less than a week and he could really do without people talking about him more than they already are. He also knows if people found out they would be mad at Seamus and probably bombard him with questions and he wouldn't do that to him.
"So you think everyone's going to think we're perfect for each other?" Draco asks nervously and Harry nods.
"What do I smell like?" Harry asks and when he sees Draco blush he smirks, no wonder he wasn't in Gryffindor, he's got as much courage as the cowardly lion.
By the time they get back to the common room an hour later the entire school has heard at least one of the names.
"Hey." Draco says as he sits next to Harry. Harry's hidden himself in the library, and has been reading through his textbooks and getting all his homework done. He's not been avoiding Draco, he just thinks he should try and get used to not being with him all the time since he's going to have to go 2 weeks without him. Harry looks up from his Herbology essay to smile at Draco.
"Harry!" Blaise grins as he enters the hospital wing. There's a sixth year Ravenclaw in a bed near the door that jumps at the loud greeting, and Blaise smiles when Harry sits up straighter and closes his sketchbook.
"Tell me, Harry. Talk to me." He puts his hands on Harrys cheeks and looks him in the eyes and Harry can't help but let his heartbreak show.
Their walk lasts for an hour in total. Most of it in silence but they keep their little fingers linked the whole time. When they reach the castle Harry unlinks their fingers and bids Draco a good night before making his way to the Gryffindor common room. Harry is dreading going back to his dorm, but since it's only 8pm when he enters the room it's empty. Harry figures no one will bother him if he's asleep so he decides to go straight to bed.
"Draco what's up?" Harry asks, genuinely concerned that he's having some sort of stroke or something. When Draco stays silent Harry moves his hand to rest on Dracos leg, figuring it's something he doesn't want to say or talk about.
"My office." Harry knew this was coming. He walks past the three of them and makes his way up to McGonagalls office, noticing McGonagall didn't follow him which means she's still talking to Malfoy and Blaise. Harry stands in front of the desk, waiting.
Okay firstly this fic passed 10K reads that is INSANE! Secondly this chapter is so cute and don't you deny it <3 Hope you enjoyed :)
"I'll tell you later." Harry says before motioning for Draco to walk with him. There's a few people near the tree when they get to it so Harry takes out the cloak and removes the charm so it's normal sized. He puts his wand back in his back pocket and checks no one is looking before stepping closer to Draco and throwing the cloak round both of them. Draco struggles to breath when Harry steps closer and frowns in confusion when Harry throws a cloak round them both, still confused why they're standing next to the whomping willow.
"I need to get ready but I'm not letting you get away with this." Harry says before climbing out of bed and putting his quidditch robes on. He runs his hands through his hair a few times before pulling on his shoes.
"Harry you're family to me and my family. You know that. And I'm sorry that I wasn't there for you." Ron says, walking closer. Harry presses his lips together.
"You're all free to go." Slughorn says when he gets back to the front of the classroom. Harry sighs and picks his bag up, making sure to take his time. When the class is pretty much empty Harry stands up and takes his essay out of his bag. He walks over to Slughorn and holds it out to him.
"You couldn't Draco. It broke you." Harry says, grabbing Draco's hands in his and bringing them up to his chest, holding them against him.
They let the topic slide, moving on to talk about who knows what, and Ron joins them for a few minutes too. They talk about Christmas and their plans for the holidays, joking and messing around, before Ron says he has to go back to the Gryffindors' carriage. Blaise and Draco start talking about something or another, and Harry rests his head back against the cushioned wall behind him, getting lost in his thoughts again. When Blaise is snoring lightly, head resting against the window, and Pansy has her head in his lap, also fast asleep and breathing evenly, Draco turns and rests his head on Harry's shoulder, burying himself in his side.
"As much as I despise the fact that you refuse to do anything that isn't self destructive, I appreciate what you did." Harry smiles slightly and turns his head so he's looking up at Draco, before frowning.
"She said we need to keep an eye on you." Blaise says and Harry sighs as they enter the potions class.
"Are you okay?" He asks and Harry bites the inside of his cheek. He would usually lie, especially to people he supposedly hated a few weeks ago, but for some reason, maybe because his friends haven't bothered to ask him in half a week, he just want's to be honest.
"All he does is run and read. It's so boring! Like we get it you beat you know who and now everyone loves you and thinks you're some sort of god. Everyone thinks you're a saint and you can do no wrong. Wow your life must be so hard!" Ron mimics and everyone laughs.
"Did you get any sleep last night?" Draco asks, voice quiet like he doesn't think he should be asking the question, and Harry shifts his gaze from the window to Draco.
"It smells good, Kreacher. Thank you." Harry was going to free Kreacher, after the war when he moved here, but Kreacher didn't want to leave the house, and Harry is kind of glad. They've formed a weird sort of friendship, and Harry is happy to have him. This does mean, however, that he has to eat, because he doesn't want to upset Kreacher. He's not too happy about that.
"I didn't have a choice." Draco says, his voice cracking. Harry kisses Dracos hands softly before holding them against his chest again. They're lying so close their foreheads are almost touching and their legs are linked and all he can see is Draco and all he can smell is Draco and it's wonderful.
"No offense but I kind of figured you were gay, and as for the Malfoy thing, ever since you started that silent revision or whatever the fuck you do in the library you've been a lot happier, also not to sound too much like Hermione but you've actually be doing work too. Sure I still think he's a prat, but that's probably because I haven't spoken to him since before the war. Besides, if you love him you love him, I can't change that, and it's not my place to say who you can and can't love." Ron says and a smile slowly spreads across Harrys face.
Harry wakes up to see an almost empty dorm. Seamus is still asleep but everyone else is gone. Harry gets up and showers before pulling on some jeans and a white t-shirt. He's about to leave the dorm and go for a walk before he notices how windy and cold it looks outside, so he grabs a leather jacket that used to belong to Sirius before heading out of the dorm room. He hasn't seen Hagrid in a while, so he leaves the castle and makes his way down to Hagrid's hut.
"Okay, now I will ask Poppy to arrange a time and day you are free, and we will let you know. And Potter if there is anything you need let me know." McGonagall says with a smile and Harry nods.
"You're right Harry, it's getting worse. You're falling in love. But why is that such a bad thing?" She asks and Harry raises his eyebrow at her.
"Oh come on, not you as well! What is it with you two and reading?" Blaise grabs Harrys hand and pulls him up, putting his book on the coffee table with Dracos.
"Whats with the sudden need for affection?" He asks softly, wrapping his arms as tight round Dracos waist as he can.
"You can't just say shit like that and walk off." He growls in Harrys ear and Harry fights to suppress a smirk, instead turning round to face Draco and feigning innocence.
"I don't want to start a fight in the middle of the Zabini home, so I'm just going to warn you." Harry tugs on Brandon's hand, getting in his space, "I think it would do you well to remember that I can do no wrong in the eyes of the ministry, so if you make Draco feel uncomfortable or upset again I will kill you." Harry growls, voice low, and Brandon pulls his hand out of Harry's grip, nods slightly.
"You should smile more, it's a good look." Harry says and before he leaves Draco calls "right back at you." Making Harry blush.
”Well his friends are clearly incompetent and either haven’t noticed or are so stupid they can’t help him. I mean Weasel asked him if he was okay 5 times in Potions today, and Granger keeps telling him he should eat. Yes he should eat because it looks like he hasn’t eaten in fucking months, I know for a fact he hasn't eaten anything since we've been back here, but her talking about it is clearly just making him feel worse. They don't know how to cheer him up or make him feel better, like what kind of ridiculous friends are they?” Draco rants and Pansy glances at Blaise, who shrugs.
He grabs Dracos hand and turns to the pensive before Draco pulls the lid off and Harry pours the memory into the pensive.
"I'm not going anywhere." Draco whispers reassuringly and Harry takes a deep breath before relaxing his grip slightly. Draco let's go of Harry's right hand and grabs his left so he's wrapped further around Harry, forming a human shield around him, and Harry's right hand grips Draco's forearm.
He puts his essay in his bag along with his text book before standing up and looking round at the books on the shelves. He starts browsing books on astronomy, not only because he has the class Sunday night, but also because he likes the subject. He likes knowing that there are things that are so far away and so beautiful and it makes his worries and problems seem so insignificant, for a second, at least. He wanders round a corner, his gaze fixed on reading the spines of the books, and finally finds the one he was looking for when he feels someones gaze on him. He turns around and sees Malfoy and Zabini sat at a table, both of them watching him carefully. Harry turns back to the bookcase and picks up the book before walking back to his table, but he for some reason can't stop thinking of Malfoy and his fucking face and the fact that he had a faint blush on his cheeks which means he was probably talking about Harry, even if Harry didn't hear him. Harry felt slightly self conscious under their gaze. He's only wearing slim fit joggers and a tight t-shirt, whereas Malfoy is wearing a shirt and trousers and looking like a fucking model. Zabini isn't exactly dressed like a mess either. Harry knows he has a good body, and this t-shirt isn't exactly hiding it, but he still feels under dressed.
"You look so much like him." Draco says and Harry smiles slightly, remembering when Sirius told him that. The 19 year olds sat on the sofa are laughing and joking about something Sirius said when a red headed young woman walks in. She's beautiful, and Harry gets why everyone tells him he has his mothers eyes.
"How are you gonna tell him?" Hermione asks, leaning closer to Harry and Harry shrugs, glancing back over at Draco to see Pansy sat on his lap grinning and Blaise sat next to him practically vibrating with what looks like happiness. He wants to tell Draco in a way he knows he means it, because Draco doesn't get that Harry genuinely doesn't blame him for what he did in the war. An idea hits him whilst he's watching Draco and he turns to Hermione with a smile.
They're in no particular order, just the order of which Harry remembered them and wrote them down. But the notebook is full of things like this from Harry's past. No one knows about the notebook, and no one knows any of the things written in it apart from the people that did or witnessed them. It's a book full of things Harry is ashamed of, and he doesn't want anyone to know. He hears people entering the common room and puts the book back in his bedside table before anyone comes in, instead picking up sense and sensibility. He's almost finished it when a cat patronus appears in front of him and tells him he is supposed to be in McGonagalls office, so Harry sighs, stands up and makes his way to her office.
"I should be askin' you that Harry. Come in and have a rest, would yer." Hagrid puts his hand on Harry's back and leads him into his hut. He knows Harry isn't okay, and he just want's Harry to know he can talk to him. Harry walks over and sits at the table and Hagrid passes him a glass of water before sitting down.
"He has a love bite. Pansy why does he have a love bite?" Draco mutters bitterly, staying quiet so no one can hear him.
"You don't have to watch me play, but don't pretend you don't love it." Harry jokes, leaning back against the stairs behind him, watching as Draco turns pink but stays silent.
"Potter, I believe this is yours." She says, handing him Teddy and he sits him on him lap before looking up at the headteacher confused.
"He- He was great." Harry sighs, "He was just- I don't even know how to describe him. Dramatic for sure. Funny too. He was just brilliant." Harry finishes, squeezing Draco's hand.
"We were just talking." Seamus says, looking at Harry in a pleading way, as if he desperately want's to talk to him. Blaise looks at Harry and he looks conflicted.
Harry jumps out of Rons memory after that, feeling like he'd been stabbed in the chest 50 times over.
Harry and Draco stayed in the tower, just existing in each others presence, for hours. Draco eventually had to go to dinner, Harry flat out refusing to go with him, and when Draco had finished eating he saw Harry jogging around the castle and knew there was no way he would be able to talk to him for the rest of the day.
"Mister Potter." McGonagall says sternly and Harry presses his lips together. He knew she'd be upset with him but he doesn't like hearing the disappointment in her voice. He's flat out refusing to look at Malfoy.
"Harry you two need to just make out and get it over with." She says and Harry blushes as Ron runs over.
During breakfast Harry lets Seamus and Dean know that he'll tell everyone at dinner, which of course they needed to spread to the whole school. Which is why Seamus and Dean are now standing on the bench.
"Which one you gonna watch first?" Draco asks quietly as Harry opens the case and bites his lip, running his finger across the rows of 'specific' memories in the lid.
"Yeah. I actually have something I need to tell you." Harry says and Draco looks at him because he didn't think he'd tell him now. He thought he'd at least tell him to sit down. Ron's eyes shine, like he's trying to hide a smile, and Draco gets the feeling Ron knows exactly what's coming.
"At least come sit with me then? Because I'm hungry and you're still cold." Harry glances over at the great hall. He hasn't been in there for at least a month and a half; he hasn't eaten much and when he does eat he sits in the kitchen. It's quite busy in the hall, and the thought of sitting in there makes him feel sick. He looks back up at Draco and takes a shaky breath in.
"Really?" Harry nods, looking at the floor in front of him. He's not great at lying, but he knows he and Draco need to discuss this before he can start spilling about their relationship.
"Well I'm telling my mother as soon as I get home that you're moving in." Draco says and Harry chuckles. Draco likes that he's made Harry happy, and Harry can see pride in his eyes.
"Hey." Draco whispers, and Harry realises he's tensed up and is holding Dracos hand slightly too tight and is gripping his side tight too and he releases immediately, hoping he didn't hurt him.
Okay so I think I might be back lads, although I must admit I only have like 200 words of the next chapter written so I could very easily lose my mojo again... Anyways I hope you like the chapter <3
"So you just said you love each other and that was it?" Pansy asks and when Draco nods Blaise' eyes widen.
"You're not bad, you know." She says quietly, and Harry smiles slightly. No one's seen anything he's drawn before, mainly because he only really draws Draco.
"Wouldn't you like to know." Harry winks at him and Seamus pouts, not being able to press Harry more because Professor McGonagall has started the class.
"Gross!" Blaise calls from the top of the stairs, but he's smiling and doesn't mean it at all. Harry and Draco laugh as they follow Blaise and Pansy up the stairs, away from the loud voices below them.
"No fucking way? Who was the one that finally managed to stop you being such a whore?" Seamus asks in shock and Harry grins smugly.
"Meet us in the entrance hall at 1? That's probably where Andromeda will pick up Teddy from." Draco agrees and Harry kisses Draco softly before he leaves Harrys room.
"No thank you, I'm fine." He says quietly and Madam Pomfrey frowns before she turns around and quickly walks over to Malfoy when she sees him, helping him sit on a bed, and Harry decides he should probably leave them to it. He about to walk out when Madam Pomfrey calls him.
Wednesday comes quicker than expected. Harry spent the last day and a half reading and not paying much attention in class but still getting top marks for his homework. He walks down to the pitch at 4:30 and gets changed into his quidditch uniform before picking up his broom and the trunk of balls and walking onto the pitch. He sets up for a warm up and just as he finishes his team exit the changing room, all in their quidditch uniform.
"I have the resurrection stone. I had it during the war, and then I found it again. During the war I saw my parents, Remus and Sirius. I used it again last week, cause I was desperate to see them. And Fred was there too." Harry says, tears falling down his cheeks.
"Draco, love, were you jealous of George?" Harry asks, smirking slightly, and Draco bites his lip, keeping his forehead on Harry's shoulder.
He wants something to represent Harry; He prevented Draco and his mother from going to Azkaban but he also saved Dracos life. Besides, he's been in love with him since second year when Draco realised the so-called 'hatred' was actually just love.
"Maybe not, but if they were trying to curse you there's a high possibility that mister Potter redirected the curse onto himself."
"Just say it!" He says and Draco blushes and Harry glances over at him before rolling his eyes, a sappy smile on his face, and turning back to Blaise.
He shut himself off during the summer after the war, living at Grimmauld place alone and not talking to anyone. He told no one that he died during the war. He doesn't want to talk about it, or think about it. Only two people kind of know he died and that's Hagrid and Narcissa, because they were both there. He also really doesn't want to see anyone, which is why he refused the offer to stay at the burrow over the summer before 8th year. He feels so damn guilty all the time, and seeing Ron and George and Mrs. Weasley makes him feel worse. He's spent two months alone in agonising guilt and sorrow. He spent the first few weeks working on the house, making it feel homely and he's proud of the outcome, but he's done nothing but read, draw, play Sirius' guitar and exercise since then. The only things he could do that kept his mind occupied, because when he isn't doing things the guilt starts to creep in and quickly becomes overwhelming. This all ends today though. It's September 1st and Harry is going back to Hogwarts for the last time. His trunk is packed with everything he needs, including his broom and Sirius' guitar, and is by his front door ready for him. Kingsley is his chauffeur for today, and when he gets to Grimmauld place Harry sighs before leaving the house with him, locking the door behind him.
"Harry James Potter you are clueless." She says as she sits next to him. Harry looks at her in confusion and slight annoyance.
I'm engaging panic mode right now because I've only got one and a half more chapters ready for this fic and I have major writers block! I am freaking out! I don't want to miss a post cause I've been posting once a week for ages but I HAVE NOTHING!!! Send help! :(
"Yeah but at least I could kiss you in public." Harry says and Draco blushes slightly as they reach the quidditch pitch to see Ron waiting by the entrance.
"And you lived with your aunt and uncle, yes?" Harry nods before going into a spiel about how his family treated him. How he winces if he spills anything, flinches if someone reaches out for him, even if they mean it in a comforting way, how he subconsciously prepares to pick up his plate to wash up after every meal, and how he naturally walks quietly because if his family heard him walking around they'd lock him in his cupboard. The fact that he still calls it his cupboard shows how badly it messed him up. Michael listens, like he did last week, only talking to ask a question or ask Harry to elaborate further. The session lasts an hour, and Harry feels both better for finally telling someone this but also worse as telling someone the trials and tribulations of your childhood is emotionally exhausting. Harry bids Michael goodbye before making his way up to the astronomy tower. It's 3 o'clock and there's no classes tonight so he can stay there as long as he wants and wont be interrupted. He reaches the tower and walks over to the edge, sitting on the wall and throwing his legs over the edge so his feet are hanging over the edge of the tower. Grey clouds cover the mountains and Harry watches as rain bounces off of the lake. It's peaceful, he thinks, sitting on the wall with the world below him.
"You didn't tell Weasley did you?" Draco asks and Harry shakes his head. Draco looks over at him and struggles to breathe. Harry is leaning against the railing on his hands, which means his muscles are very prominent and he looks kind of amazing.
The second Harry touches him Draco's legs feel weak and he gasps in pleasure. Harry undoes Draco's trousers and slowly, agonizingly slow in Draco's opinion, pulls them down, along with his boxers, until Draco is naked. Harry looks him over and smirks; Draco is so beautiful and he's all his. Harry kisses Draco's hips and thighs, gripping Dracos hips to keep him steady and Draco is shaking in anticipation.
"Stairs by the notice board." Harry tries to walk without putting too much weight on Draco but he's so tired and dizzy that he can barely keep his eyes open. Draco all but carries Harry up the stairs and follows his directions to his dorm room.
Ron doesn't have a plan as he says the password and enters the common room, only that he needs Draco Malfoy's help. It's 4:30am though, and he doesn't know where the boys dorm rooms are, so he walks over to a Slytherin sat by the fire asleep and shakes her shoulder gently. She wakes up, bleary eyed, and frowns when she sees Ron.
Harry has been asleep for 3 hours. Pansy came to join Blaise and Draco, glancing at Harry and Draco before smiling slightly as she sits next to Blaise. The three are talking quietly and joking around like they usually do, just at a lower volume, all the while Draco doesn't stop moving his hands through Harry's hair and across his back and down his sides.
"Malfoy I'm sorry, I am. When I was doing your tattoo I tried to distance myself from you emotionally but it didn't work and I linked myself to your tattoo." Harry says and Draco frowns.
"Potter. I would like a word with you." McGonagall says at the end of the lesson as everyone is leaving, and Harry bites his lip but walks over to her desk. The class file out of the room and when they're all gone McGonagall turns to Harry.
"When I was younger I kind of didn't eat. Not a lot. Wasn't allowed to most of the time. My Aunt and Uncle didn't give me much, and if I messed up cooking or I didn't do chores or I got in the way or my cousin complained, then I didn't eat at all. They'd just lock me in the cupboard and I wouldn't eat, so I'm just used to not eating." Harry admits, and he's never mentioned this to anyone apart from McGonagall and Sirius, and Draco's eyes widen.
"But can it be all black, with green eyes? And add a few narcissus flowers?" Draco asks and Harry nods, smiling slightly.
“Oh my god. Harry I’m so sorry.” She whispers and he wraps his arms around her, burying his face in her hair.
"Alright fine, but let's be honest here, you do love playing quidditch and you love playing against Potter and you make each other better." Blaise says and Draco sighs.
"I will have a word with the Gryffindors in question. Meanwhile, you should get to bed." She says, dismissing them, and they both nod before leaving.
"You have got to stop using that." Blaise mutters, his hands on Harry's shoulders, and Harry nods. He's gripping Blaise's arms tight and he hopes he isn't hurting him
"Oh my god Hermione!" Ron says in shock as he walks into the common room. Harry freaks out for all of 2 seconds before Ron continues. "Harry is actually reading! As in there is a book and it is open and Harry is looking at it." Ron says, clutching his chest and falling onto an armchair near the sofa. Hermione rolls her eyes and chuckles.
"'s nice up here." He says softly, watching the heavy rain fall. Draco watches Harry, wondering why he's the only one that can help Harry sleep.
Harry pulls his potions homework towards him along with his textbook and starts writing, getting about a quarter of the way through before he realises he needs more information. He stands up and wanders over to the shelves that he knows holds the book he needs, and when he finds it and goes to reach for it his hands bumps someone else's, who is also reaching for the same book. Harry pulls his hand back at the same time as the other person, and when he looks to see who it is he see's Blaise.
Harry sit's back on the end of his bed when Ron leaves, and shortly after Draco, Blaise, and Pansy come back over and sit down. Pansy takes the chair by the bed, Blaise lies on the bed next to Harry's and Draco nervously sits at the end of Harry's bed. Harry's exhausted, and he yawns as they settle down.
"Being alone." His eyes are watering and he didn't think he'd cry and by the looks of it neither did McGonagall. She smiles sadly at him.
Draco doesn't know for sure what makes Potter so broken, but he has a pretty good idea. He does want to know for certain though, and if Potter won't tell him then he'll need to get one of his friends to. Weasley is completely out of the question; they hate each other. Draco refuses to talk to the Weaslette because she's annoying and, aren't her and Potter dating? Seamus and Dean will definitely not say anything and will tell Potter he's trying to get information. Neville is just a lost cause, so that leaves Granger. Draco has a pretty good idea of how to get her to talk. Either get her so mad that she starts ranting without realising what she's saying and hope she spills what's wrong with Potter, or ask her about a class and while she's excitedly talking about school slyly bring up Potter. He decides not to get on her bad side, anymore than he already is, and try the 'butter her up' option first.
"Yeah, you are. Why won't you let people help you? You're always being the fucking golden boy with a hero complex, the chosen one who saves everyone, but you refuse to let anyone help you. It's fucking infuriating." Draco growls and Harry steps closer to Draco.
Harry casts another silent wandless charm to clean them both up and Draco presses a kiss to Harry's chest.
"George found out before you because Harry was scared about your reaction, and he didn't exactly tell George, he figured it out." Draco explains and Ron raises an eyebrow.
"Oh my god how when where what happened tell me everything." Pansy says in one breath and Draco smiles, explaining what happened, stopping before he gives too much detail.
"Okay so I was unorganised-" He is cut off by Hermione saying "shocker" sarcastically and he rolls his eyes.
"Professor we just want to talk to him!" Harry closes his eyes tight, willing the dizziness to go away, and Draco stands up.
"I'm gonna assume you don't mean when we're fighting?" Draco jokes quietly and Harry smiles slightly.
"That's funny because I didn't see you at any meals, and Mister Zabini and Mister Malfoy haven't seen you all day."
"Nah, I really need to focus on actually passing this year, and we should give the younger years a fair chance." Ron grins and Harry rolls his eyes before noticing how similar Rons grin is to Freds. He sighs and looks back down at his almost finished essay. He just has to write a conclusion and then he has no more homework to do until he inevitably gets some on Monday. He goes back to writing, knowing Ron will probably leave, and sure enough a few minutes later he looks up from his finished essay to see he's alone.
“Harry please don’t be upset. And I’m sorry, but you were.” He says sadly and Harry sits up, tears rolling down his cheeks.
The word gets out about Harry having a secret boy or girl friend and as he walks to lunch after transfiguration with Hermione and Ron he's questioned many times. During lunch he can feel people staring at him, probably trying to guess from his behaviour who it is, as well as the people that actually come up and ask him. He can also see Draco smirking slightly whenever they catch each others eye and Harry is half tempted to walk over and kiss him in front of the whole school just to shut them up.
"You okay?" He asks quietly and Draco nods, unable to stop himself from looking at the group across the bar before he looks down at his drink. Harry follows his gaze and looks over at the group before sighing.
"I'll see them every weekend." Harry says and Seamus pauses for a second before bursting out laughing, which makes Harry start laughing.
"Yeah, okay." She says, looking at him for a second before turning around and walking towards the dungeon.
"Okay." He says, looking back down at the quidditch book. Harry looks at Hermione and she just shrugs so he looks back at Ron.
"Yeah." Harry raises an eyebrow and Draco sighs. "Just don't like Davies." He mutters and Harry nods.
"I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind, that I put down in words... How wonderful life is while you're in the world." Harry finishes with a deep breath before finally breaking their eye contact so he can put his guitar down.
Harry sits in his usual seat at the back right table next to Ron and when Draco, Pansy and Blaise walk in and Blaise gestures Harry over to the back corner he raises his eyebrow. He's guessing Draco told them about what happened considering there's still a blush on Draco's cheeks making him look absolutely adorable.
Draco doesn't know if it's better or worse that Harry is still asleep when Weasley comes up to the dorm. He does know that the fact Harry is still lying on his lap makes it a whole lot more awkward though.
"Stay as long as you want, son." He says and Sirius thanks him before James grabs his bag again and leads Sirius up to his room.
"Of course not. Their great golden boy is with an ex death-eater. I think the only person they would disapprove of more would be if you were to date Voldemort himself." Harry chuckles.
"So you're going out with your team tomorrow?" Blaise asks after a while, having not thought of any ideas.
"I wasn't sure I was going to be until last night." Harry mumbles, lying slightly because he knew 2 days ago, and Rons face softens slightly, probably because this is the most he's heard Harry say since the war.
"I still can't believe you're reading the same author." Blaise chuckles and Draco looks down at Harry's book before looking back up at Blaise.
"I know." He says before putting the picture and his wand on Draco's bedside table. The alcohol is wearing off slightly and now he feels really tired. He pulls Draco closer to him and buries his face in Draco's hair before taking a deep breath.
It's empty, as usual, so he strips down and gets in the shower, turning the water on so it's nearly unbearably hot. The room quickly fills with steam and Harry likes the fact that he can barely see the other side of the bathroom through it. Harry thinks when he showers. His mind drifts, and sometimes it goes to nice places, happy memories, and good times. Other times he's 6 years old and he's locked in the cupboard because Vernon has work friends over and they mustn't know Harry exists, or he's 12 and he's locked in the cupboard because Dudley said he tried to curse him, even though Harry didn't have his wand and he didn't yet know how to use magic without it. Right now he isn't any of these things. He's 18 and he's walking along the lake with Malfoy and their little fingers are linked and they're not saying anything but they're both just existing. Harry sighs and rests his head against his forearm against the side of the shower, letting the hot water run down his back.
They lie side by side, facing each other, so close their foreheads are touching and their noses brush against each other despite the fact that the bed is a king size. Harry's right arm is thrown over Draco's side and Draco's left hand is playing with the hair at the nape of his neck. Their other hands connected against the bed, pressed in between their chests. Their eyes are closed and they're breathing steadily into the small space between them, and Harry realises how fucked he is. He's well and truly fucked. He needs Draco to sleep, which he needs to do to live, and with every night they spend together Harry is falling more and more in love with him and he's becoming more and more dependant and he's going to be fucked when Draco gives up on him. Which is inevitable, he's realised. Everyone gives up on him, and even if he doesn't, when they finish eighth year Harry wont be able to sleep with Draco every night so he's only got, at most, until July. Just 8 months left of sleeping without nightmares. That is if Draco doesn't give up before then. Which he will. Harry knows he will because everyone does.
"Alright." He says, sitting on the bed opposite Draco. "First we're gonna start rumours of the people it could be, get the school more invested than they already are. Then we're gonna add fuel to the fire by making sure some first year or something sees us doing something not so friendly, but then another student could see us arguing or something so they start some sort of debate. Then we show everyone the truth by, i dunno, fucking in the great hall." Harry says and Draco raises an eyebrow and Harry rolls his eyes.
"No thank you, sorry Kreacher, just a bit nervous." Harry presses his lips together, his mouth suddenly feeling very dry so he walks into the kitchen to get a glass of water. He's met Narcissa before, and Draco said she was happy for them, so why is he so bloody nervous? He hears Kreacher greeting Draco and takes a shaky breath before turning around and making his way back to the living room. He can't help but smile when he sees Draco, and when Draco turns to look at Harry a smile spreads across his face too.
"Malfoy I have had feelings for you since for-fucking-ever. I tried to stop them long enough to do your tattoo without linking it to me but I couldn't." Harry says and Draco looks at him with wide eyes, his hand still in Harrys.
"I'll be right back." He's going to talk to McGonagall about Harry, but he mainly just wants to leave him and Draco alone in the hopes that they pull themselves together and make out or something. Harry and Draco watch him leave before Harry sighs and leans back against the pillows. Draco watches him carefully and when Harry turns to look at him he blushes slightly.
"Are you joking?" Blaise says, looking at the books in disbelief. They're both reading Jane Austen. Blaise rolls his eyes whilst Harry and Draco look at each other incredulously.
"Legilimency." He breathes, his gaze fixed on where Ron used to be and his wand still raised. Draco carefully reaches out and places his hand on Harry's, lowering his arm.
"I'm Harry fucking Potter. Besides, I do this all the time." He says, admiring how Dracos eyes basically glow in the dark.
Draco hasn't been with a guy before, and he's only been with a few girls too. Harry on the other hand has fooled around with pretty much every Gryffindor his age and some Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs his age too. He didn't sleep with all of them, but he's done enough to know exactly what he's doing, and the innocence of Draco is so fucking adorable that Harry just wants to pull him into a hug. Draco decides to try and channel some of Harry's bravery and ask for what he's been wanting since he was first saw Harry in diagon alley. He leans close to Harry, which makes Harry wrap his arms around Draco and pull him flush against him.
"Of course. And when would you like that to be?" Harry shrugs. It's Saturday tomorrow so he could see him then, although he did promise his team they could all go out for ice cream.
"It's called being in love and not knowing how or being able to express it." Hermione says and Harry shoots up.
"You're fucked by the way mate." Ron says as soon as Harry gets to him and he raises an eyebrow, letting him continue.
"Potter." Kingsley greets with a smile, and Harry offers a small fake smile that Kingsley sees right through.
"Well, that's a start I guess. But Draco, you need to try harder if you want to help him." Blaise says and Draco nods.
"Okay, why is Draco blushing what have you done? Who mentioned him and Harry fucking?" She asks and Seamus raises an eyebrow.
"I'm leaving now." He says and Harry pouts, tightening his grip on Draco's shirt, suddenly looking nervous.
"Granger, I just had an interesting run in with Potter and need your help deciphering it." Draco mutters and Hermione frowns.
“She was pregnant, Mione.” Harry turns to her. “She was pregnant when she died.” He chokes and Hermione pulls Harry into a hug.
"Okay, well get some rest and eat some food." She says and when Harry grimaces she looks sternly at him.
"I'm gonna assume you bought him that cause there's no way in hell Aunt Andromeda did." He says, walking over to sit next to Harry.
"Guys I don't think we're the people he want's to see right now. Not after what happened earlier." She says and Seamus shakes his head.
"You're actually eating." She says and Harry looks down at his half empty plate before looking up at Hermione in shock.
From that night on Harry and Draco fall asleep curled together. They both preferred it when Harry was the big spoon, but some nights, like the first one, Harry needs to be the one being hugged; Sometimes he needs that security.
"I'm sorry." Harry says, because he can tell that Draco was actually concerned for him, and Draco smiles slightly.
Harry stands up from the table and walks out of the hall, hands in his front pockets and Hermione links her arm through his.
"Okay guys! It is time!" Seamus says as he and Dean stand up. "We're engaged!" He shouts, placing his hand on Harrys shoulder, who chuckles and stands up.
"So this is Edward, huh?" He asks, almost to himself and Harry frowns before realising that they're related.
"Hey." Draco says quietly, rolling over so he's facing Harry and burying his face in Harry's neck. Harry wraps his arms around Draco and holds him close.
Harry spends an hour sketching Malfoy, making sure he gets every little detail correct, down to the pain and fear in his eyes, before looking at the picture and deeming it complete. He closes his sketch book and takes a breath in before rubbing his eyes. It's 3pm and he's missed lunch. By now Hermione would usually have come and found him to lecture him about how he shouldn't miss meals, or Ron would have come to ask him if he's okay. Of course, they haven't. They've given up, it seems. All of his friends have. Harry doesn't know what he feels at this realisation; sadness, relief, anger. All he knows is that he feels like he's about to start crying. He grabs his bag and takes it to his dorm before leaving the castle, going into the woods. He walks deep into the forest before collapsing against a tree trunk and sinking to the floor. He pulls his knees to his chest and lets all the emotion in him show, bursting into tears that he can't even try and stop.
"I know you're awake." Draco whispers into the space between them, and Harry's lips twitch into a small smile.
"Well sorry to cock block. You still gonna come round tomorrow?" George asks and Harry nods because he could really use a good chat with George.
"I won't make you eat anything." Draco promises, and Harry looks at him for a second longer before moving his hands, shoving his right hand in his hoodie pocket and holding Draco's hand tight with his other one. Draco seems to take this as a yes because he smiles slightly and walks towards the hall.
"Finish this year, and the job is yours." She says, placing a hand on his shoulder and squeezing slightly.
"Minerva has informed me to tell her if you refuse food and I think we both know this is the better option." She says and Harry puts the potion on the table next to his bed and shakes his head.
Harry squeezes Dracos hand as tears fill his eyes. They were so happy. He misses Sirius’ hugs, and he wishes he was able to feel his mum and dads hugs. Draco squeezes Harry’s hand and smiles at him.
"Sorry boys but this is important, you can go back to making out later." Hermione says and Draco and Harry look at her with an eyebrow raised.
"Firstly because you are a supportive friend, secondly because there's a certain seeker you love watching." Draco glares at him and Blaise and Pansy roll their eyes.
"Hello, Dw- Dwa-" Teddy tries. He looks at Harry and Harry smiles, nodding encouragingly and he looks back at Malfoy.
When he's sure the girls are far away enough he slips into the next hallway and sprints up to the floor above, the seventh floor, and begins pacing in front of a seemingly blank wall.
"Hey, Harry." Ginny calls as he enters the common room after his chat with McGonagall. Harry looks up and nods once in recognition before continuing to walk up to his dorm room. Ron is the only one there when he enters and Harry bites his lip as he walks over to his bed.
"Come on, he'll get over it eventually. He's just mad that we used to fuck about. He probably thinks we still do." George says Draco frowns, they used to fuck about as in joke around or fuck about as in actually fuck each other. He knew he had a right to be jealous.
"Best get a move on then, McGonagall wont like it if you skip a meal." Hagrid says with a smile and Harry nods.
Harry debates whether he should continue his breakdown or tell Malfoy not to be a nosey prick and piss off. Draco watches Harry's expression change from guilt to looking torn before his expression goes back to looking guilty and sad.
"It's amazing." Draco says before looking down and stroking the dragon, watching as it relaxes against his touch, and where the dragon goes, it takes the dark mark with it, so it will never be visible again. Harry bats Dracos hand away, giggling at his protests, and runs his finger down the dragons back. The dragon stretches it's wings wide and Harry grins as the dragon looks as if it's smiling.
"Blaise and Pansy, Hermione and George." Harry says, knowing the fact that George knew before Ron will hurt him.
"I don't know. It happened so fast. I don't even know if he meant to." Harry admits and McGonagall nods.
"Nah, I think I'll make you find out with everyone else." Harry says, catching Dracos eye who shrugs, telling Harry he doesn't mind if a few more people find out now.
"Ron he's been in love with him for years, maybe now they're finally conversing without fighting he can actually do something about it."
I'm writing chapter 50 at the mo and I could end the fic there and be really happy with it, or I could keep it going and add a bit more, what you lot saying??
"Oh so I'm not even allowed to tease you anymore? Rude." Blaise jokes and Draco just shakes his head, smiling slightly, and pulling his book out of his bag, ignoring his best friends.
"He's... well he's coping. Most of the time. The war really screwed him up. Plus he hates the fact that people still call him the chosen one and all that stuff. He hates the fame, but he can't get rid of it. And he has nightmares about the war. He can't shake the guilt; he's convinced all the deaths that happened are his fault." She sighs before looking at Draco. "Don't tell anyone this but sometimes he says he wishes the curse had worked, because at least he wouldn't have to live through the aftermath of the war and the thought that it's all down to him." She says before frowning. "Are you okay? I know people still don't get that you were forced into what you did." She says and Draco sighs before shrugging and standing up straight.
Harry sighs as he sits down for dinner. He doesn't understand why Draco comforted him instead of taking the piss. He doesn't understand why it was as if Draco could read his mind, saying he wasn't going anywhere the moment Harry thought Draco would leave if he let go. And he really doesn't understand why he can sense Draco's eyes on him. He does, however, know exactly why all he wants to do is go back up to his dorm and lie in Draco's arms forever. He's been in love with the prat since he was 14, and the fact that Harry is 99% sure he's the only person alive to see a soft side of Draco makes him think that maybe Draco feels the same way, but there's no way he's going to get his hopes up.
"So you're free to come Hogsmeade with me after the Slytherin/Hufflepuff game tomorrow?" Rhys asks and Harry's eyes shoot up to meet Rhys'.
There's only 3 days until the Christmas break and he's scared, because yeah, he and Draco love each other and it's great and Draco is already talking about Harry visiting him or him visiting Harry, but Harry knows that will only be for a few days at most, and he's going to have to spend the rest of the holiday alone. Molly offered for him to stay at the Burrow, but Harry declined almost immediately. He loves her, and he loves the rest of the Weasley family, but Ginny is still mad at him, and he can't face Molly or Arthur without knowing he's the reason they lost a son. He can't face George without knowing he's the reason he lost his twin. He just can't. So he's going to spend Christmas at Grimmauld place with Kreacher, and he'll maybe get a letter from the Weasleys and he'll get a letter from Hagrid and maybe McGonagall and he'll read them a thousand times over to pretend he's not completely alone. So all in all Harry isn't looking forward to Christmas.
"Same goes for you too, Gryffindors. Now mount your brooms." He says and both teams do, each keeper flying to the ends of the pitch and the rest hovering above their captains.
Nothing has changed between the two during the day, though. They still only call each other by their last name, they still make sarcastic comments and jokes and still outwardly 'hate' each other, but at night when they're alone in their dorm room, just the two of them, they're both so sweet and nice and supportive to each other and they're both so in love that it's a shame they won't tell each other.
"I'll write to him. And, mother?" Narcissa looks from her food back to Draco, signalling he can continue. "Thank you, for being okay about it."
"That can't have been comfortable." Harry says and Draco shrugs, stretching his back which, admittedly, is aching, but he didn't want to interrupt Harry.
"Go to my office, Potter. This is not a discussion we should have in front of the whole school. I'll have a house elf bring you some food and a warm beverage." She says and Harry nods, shoving his hands in his back pockets as he walks back out of the hall. He starts to walk up the staircase when Blaise calls out to him. People are starting to leave the hall, and Blaise is stood at the bottom of the stairs with Malfoy and Parkinson either side of him.
"Good thing I came in here then, huh." Ron laughs and Harry rolls his eyes at his best friend and boyfriend, both of whom are laughing at his frantic state.
Harry wakes up slowly, keeping his eyes shut, not wanting to interrupt the flow of conversation around him. Blaise is talking about a band he wants to see and he's so enthusiastic about it. Harry feels hands in his hair and on his back and forces himself not to smile. It's comforting, and he doesn't want it to stop. It's then that he realises what day it is, and that he has no idea what time it is. He blinks a few times and the hands retract from his body as he sits up slowly. Draco, Blaise and Pansy fall quiet as they look at Harry. His hair is a mess from where Draco had been running his hand through it, and his eyes are slightly puffy with exhaustion. He's adorable.
"He's great, you'll love him. He's a metamorphmagus so he's always changing his hair colour. It's usually blue. He's always smiling." Harry says before grabbing his wand and summoning a picture of Teddy. He holds it so Draco can see it and he almost forgets how to breath.
Around 15 minutes after Seamus sat down Harry sees something being pushed across the table towards him, and he glances up to see a box of mini chocolate wands. He looks up at Seamus who nods to the box, leaving it half way between the two of them. He takes one before going back to his textbook, and Harry hesitates for a second before taking one too and going back to his essay.
Granger could not be more obvious in her intentions as she motioned at Potter before leaving him and Draco. Draco sighs; he knows Granger isn't the type of person who would lie, especially about something serious, so he believed her when she said Potter forgave him. This doesn't, however, make talking to him any easier. And now he knows Harry has a tattoo he really wishes he knew what it was. After a few minutes of silently writing he bites his lip and looks up at Potter, deciding if he doesn't do it now, and fast, he'll chicken out.
Harry breaths deeply against Seamus and realises that for the past 10 minutes his brain was completely void of any negative thoughts about the war and death. Or any thoughts at all that weren't about what Seamus was doing.
They both meet Hermione in the common room before walking to the quidditch pitch together, separating when they need to go and sit with their respective houses.
"The thing for Potter?" Draco nods, a blush spreading across his cheeks as he looks down at his plate again. "Yes I know about the thing."
"Because I was an arse to you. I made your school life shit when you had a shit home life too. Now I know why you never went home at Christmas and never got post, well until third year." Draco says sadly and Harry smiles slightly.
"It's okay, you know. Not to want to talk about what happened. You've been through a lot, Potter. More than anyone should have to go through. And if you feel that now it's all over you need a break then that's okay."
"That's for convenience. I only tie it up cause if I left it down when I was running or flying or writing I wouldn't be able to see." Draco rolls his eyes and Harry smiles.
"You know, most people fall asleep after they fuck." Harry jokes and Draco blushes, burying his head further into Harry's neck.
"For a run." Harry whispers before walking out of the room, not bothering to wait and see if he has anything else to say before he makes his way out of the castle, stretching on his way out. He goes on a steady jog, not wanting to get too sweaty before breakfast, and at 8am, after sitting by the lake to take a breather for a few minutes, he makes his way to the great hall. Most students are already there, in their uniform as it’s Monday, but Harry doesn't care that he isn't in his, and Harry catches Malfoys eye as he enters. Draco looks good, he can't lie. He thought the exact same thing at his trial. Harry tears his gaze away and walks over to Hermione and Ron, sitting next to Hermione.
"I just- I mean, they know I'm gay. But them seeing me with some random pure blood as my date and me bringing actual Harry Potter are two very different things." Draco whispers.
"Great game today, by the way." Draco says and Harry smiles when Ron automatically relaxes and he and Draco start talking about quidditch. It's the main thing they can bond over because it's something they both love.
"Ginny wanted some sugary food to help with revision so he brought some to cheer her up. I told him that I'd told Ron and that he didn't take it well and he said he'd talk to him." Harry explains and Draco nods.
"So you were both getting all worried and stressy over nothing?" Blaise points out and Harry laughs.
Gryffindor are winning 60-50 when Harry finally catches a glimpse of the snitch and makes a beeline for it. The Ravenclaw seeker sees it at the same time and they both end up side by side diving towards the ground after the snitch. Harry smirks slightly as they near the ground, knowing full well Duncan, the Ravenclaw seeker, will give up before he does. Sure enough when there's only around 8 foot between the two boys and the solid ground Duncan pulls up, leaving Harry to grab the snitch. He knows he's going to hit the floor, so he grabs the snitch and rolls off of his broom in one swift motion, hitting the ground from 6ft up and rolling a bit on the floor before stopping. The whistle's been blown and his team are running towards him in concern.
"Yeah of course I will. I mean, technically Harry's definitely better than me at DADA but, I guess he's got a lot on his mind too so he probably wasn't paying attention either. Basically the spell was..." Hermione starts talking about the spell and Draco nods along, only half listening and taking half assed notes because he's still thinking about what Hermione said. Harry's distracted too. She must know why. When Hermiones finished her explanation and Draco finishes writing he smiles gratefully at her.
"Would Harry sir like some more?" Harry shakes his head. He hasn't eaten that much in ages, and he's definitely full.
"It's a mystery." She says knowingly, before changing the subject. "I have had many people sign up for the team. I trust they have left you alone?" She enquires. Harry nods.
"Ron I- Where did you all disappear to at the weekend?" Harry asks, changing the subject, and Ron frowns.
”Yeah, you look great Harry.” Blaise agrees, and Harry turns back to him and Draco. Blaise hits Dracos arm, and Draco clears his throat.
It's been 2 weeks. Harry's slept in Draco's bed nearly every night. There's a few where his PTSD and Depression get so bad he hides out in the shrieking shack for a few days, having nightmare after nightmare, trying desperately to stay awake, but inevitably falling asleep and having another nightmare. The cycle repeating constantly. He's currently having one of these days. He hasn't slept in a few days, and he hasn't eaten either, and he does exercise in the house and he goes for jogs at 3am when he knows no one will see him and he only goes back to the shrieking shack when he sees the light in Hagrids hut turn on because he gets up at 6:30 to feed the animals and that's Harry's queue that people will start walking about the castle soon. It's 2am on Sunday night/Monday morning. Harry hasn't spoken to another person since Friday afternoon, He goes for his jog early but figures it will be okay. He runs until 4am when he stops by the bridge and sits on the railing, legs hanging over the edge, and he slows his breathing as he looks at the beautiful view.
"But... Sirius was always trying to rebel against his family." Harry says slowly, and Kreacher nods.
"Harry. Could you come in? I want to talk to yer for a minute." He calls over to Harry, sad smile on his face, and Harry stops running and walks over to Hagrid. His entire body covered in sweat and he uses the bottom of his top to wipe his face.
"I'm okay, and I don't mean to pry but Potter even I can tell that you're not okay." He says softly and Harry shrugs.
"C'mon." Blaise says, leading Harry over to Draco. Harry follows nervously. He's been in the Slytherin common room once before but he was disguised as a Slytherin at the time. It's still pretty much the same though. Blaise puts his hand on Harry's shoulder and leads him to an arm chair next to where Draco is sat, pushing him down gently so he's sat down.
The drawer of the table is open slightly and Draco can see a few books in it and he knows he shouldn't but he's curious and Harry's asleep and there's no one else here. He reaches over, careful not to jostle Harry, and opens the drawer more. The top book is the one Draco gave him and Draco's heart beats a little faster. The second book is what looks like a notebook. Draco pulls it out of the drawer, curious, and opens it to the first page. What he sees causes all of the oxygen to leave his lungs and he has to remind himself to breath again.
"Listen I know you're mad at us and that's understandable but we miss you Harry, and we're worried about you." He says and Harry pulls his arm out of Seamus' grip.
"Draco, you need to talk to him." Pansy says and he sighs before noticing something on Potters neck.
Also I am yet again behind on chapters I'm sorry I am a mess my friends hate me and my life is literally falling apart. Also I'm still working. That's shit too.
"You're not human I swear." Rhys says, leaning on Harry's shoulder, and Harry can feel that he's putting a lot of his weight on Harry because he's so tired.
Ron is looking at him in shock and Harry can't take it anymore. He just sighs, grabs his book, and leaves the room, walking past Hermione, Ginny, Dean and Seamus, who apparently were all listening at the door. They look guiltily at Harry as he walks past but he doesn't stop to listen to them try and defend themselves, instead walking down the stairs and straight out of the common room. He doesn't know where he's going, but he needs to get away from his friends. He walks around, trying to keep the tears from running down his cheeks, until he finds himself outside of the headmasters office. He debates whether or not he should knock, before deciding against it. He doesn't want to disrupt her. He continues wondering the castle, and as it's only 8:30 there are still a few people walking around. Harry doesn't know what he needs or wants to do, but when he sees a third year Slytherin on the ground floor he feels the need to talk to Blaise.
"I would love to take the credit for this beautiful blossoming relationship, however I can't. It was Mr Potter who requested to room with you, Mr Malfoy. He knew you were worried about coming back to Hogwarts due to last years circumstances, and asked to share a room with you in order to make sure you were okay." Draco's eyes widen in shock slightly and McGonagall raises an eyebrow.
"I think it's only fair we wait until tomorrow. We can announce it at dinner. Then we can go Hogsmeade together Saturday and not get weird looks."
"I'll admit I'm not exactly happy about the fact that you somehow wormed your way into Harry's heart but he's had a thing for you forever so I figured it would happen eventually. That's not why I'm pissed off." Ron says and Draco sighs.
"Because you're Harry Potter. The chosen one. The saviour of the wizarding world. Plus they all want to fuck you and if you're no longer available they've lost their chance." Draco explains and Harry rolls his eyes.
"You've only asked me one question." Harry mutters and Draco rolls his eyes at how fucking technical Harry is being.
"Are you sure Potter?" Draco asks as they reach the room of requirement and Harry just shrugs, he's also tired because when he's not dreaming of blonde hair and silver eyes he's having nightmares.
"I- er- I." Draco doesn't want to tell Harry that he cares because he's been in love with him since he was 14 and seeing him so broken makes his chest ache, but he doesn't know what to tell him instead.
"Dunno. Never really feel hungry anymore. Eating usually just makes me feel sick." He says and as soon as he finishes talking the door opens.
"He was. They all were." Harry sighs and Draco doesn't know if he means his parent's or the other people that died but he knows this is a tough subject for Harry to talk about and he needs to tread carefully.
"Well McGonagall asked if I knew what I'm doing with my life and I was like no but I ain't being an auror any more and she said I could work here teaching DADA and quidditch." Harry says and Draco smiles proudly.
"You don't have to look so surprised, Draco. Gryffindors are actually nice people." Harry chuckles and Draco shrugs.
"Did. Had to come back." Draco nods and turns back to his parchment. Harry can't help but think this is the perfect opportunity to tell Malfoy about his book, but then again he thinks maybe he should tell him about how he died too. He doesn't feel quite ready to tell him that yet.
Draco is freaking out a little. Potter looked really attractive in joggers and a hoodie but Draco hasn't seen him since he left the hall at lunch without eating anything and after hearing Granger say he wishes the curse had killed him Draco has been desperate to hold Potter and tell him he's glad he's alive. He didn't show up to dinner and it's 11pm so he should definitely be in their dorm by now, but he's completely disappeared. Draco leaves his and Harry's dorm room and goes to the common room to find Granger sitting by the fireplace alone and reading.
"No you bellend." Harry chuckles. "Sirius was great. He told me that the world isn't split into good people and death eaters. We all have both light and dark inside of us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are. He knew you had good in you, even if you didn't think so. He was awesome." Harry says, his tone bittersweet.
"Being here." Draco can feel Harry's breath on his lips and he's so sincere and he so sad and Draco wants to hug him forever.
"Potter I was an arsehole to you, not to mention everything I did during the war." Draco says and Harry shakes his head.
"No." He whispers and Harry could curse at how stubborn he is. Draco knows if he keeps this up Harry will give in. "Potter what happened to you? You disappeared for hours." He asks and Harry frowns in confusion. Was Malfoy worried about him?
"Draco I am so happy for you." Narcissa reaches across the table to squeeze his hand. "We must arrange a date for him to come and visit during Christmas. Is he still at Hogwarts?" Draco laughs slightly.
"Harry she knows you didn't know what that spell did, she knows you didn't mean to and she knows that you regret it. Please don't worry." He says and Harry frowns.
"Why you sat on your ones?" He asks, sitting on the same section of the wall as Harry so his thigh is pressed against Harrys knee.
"Granger. Do you know where Potter is?" He asks, trying to suppress a smile when Teddy walks over and wraps his arms around him.
"You're devious. You're evil. You're sarcastic. How were you not a slytherin?" Draco asks and Harry chuckles slightly.
"Don't fucking lie to me Draco." He growls angrily and Draco figures he should probably just tell him.
Draco eventually finds the will to wake Harry up, softly calling his name and patting his arm until he stirs, and Harry whimpers against his back but eventually forces himself to get up. The two make their way to Herbology, arriving a few minutes late but when Professor Sprout sees Harry and the post nap sleepiness radiating off of him she just smiles slightly and tells them to take a seat. They both walk to their seats in the back of the class, and no one mentions the fact that their little fingers are linked again, or that Draco squeezes Harry's hand before they let go and sit down in their seats.
"I'm not- I can't say it." He says and Draco nods before moving so he's sat next to Harry, leaning against the headboard. Draco opens the book to the first page and Harry rests his head on Dracos shoulder, reading it with him. Harry never thought he would ever share these things with anyone, let alone the person that was meant to be his sworn enemy. His eyes skim the pages of his messed up past and he hear Dracos ragged breathing next to him and he can hear the occasional gasp coming from him and Harry has tears silently falling down his cheeks as he once again finds himself encased in the trauma of his childhood, only this time there's a hand gripping his own and a shoulder under his head keeping him safe.
"Why are you rushing?" He asks, and Draco's mind immediately goes to Harry in their dorm. How long has he been gone? What if Harry has fallen asleep again and is having a nightmare? What if he decided he didn't want to stay in the dorm and has gone back to his own. He definitely wont sleep in his own dorm. Not unless Draco is there.
"You wanna nap?" Draco asks as they leave the hall, and Harry shakes his head. He's got work to do. He tells Draco as much, so they grab their things and make their way to the library, where they settle in the back corner and start their potions essays.
"Alright fine, I vanished it. But I ate breakfast so to be honest I don't see the big deal." Harry mutters and Madam Pomfrey sighs before accioing some sort of potion.
Draco marvels at the beauty of Harry's magic. Teddy is watching in amazement and he looks how Draco feels.
"So why did you bring me here? What did you need to tell me?" Draco sounds nervous and Harry doesn't know if that's good or bad but he can tell Draco is trying to change the subject so he doesn't cry.
"It's my pleasure, Harry. I'm glad I could help." He whispers back, not wanting to burst this peaceful bubble they're in. Harry pulls away slightly, Seamus' leg is still in between his but they can see each others face, and he glances at Seamus' neck before biting his lip.
"I've got to show you something too. Do you trust me?" Harry asks and Draco nods without hesitation. Harry jumps down from the wall and pulls out the map, checking that no one is near the whomping willow and laughing quietly at Draco's shocked and impressed look.
"Yay! Lets go!" He says, standing up and pulling Draco up by the arm. He looks at Harry, who is now gripping his book too because he kind of just wants to finish it.
As they walk down to the three broomsticks Harry notices a few people give Draco weird looks or do a double take when they see him with Harry and it's starting to piss Harry off because they all need to leave Draco alone. Just before they reach the pub a group of boys from Hogwarts glare at Draco and one mutters "Death eater" as the three of them walk past and Harry snaps. He whirls round and walks towards the seventh year Ravenclaw that spoke until their chests are almost touching.
"Do you know who's winning the poll?" Harry asks and Dean and Seamus turn around from the bench in front of him.
"It's okay." Harry stands the guitar up against the wall next to him and shuffles into the corner of the windowsill, crossing his legs.
"Yeah you are." Pansy says, looking concerned, and Draco sighs. He knows he can tell them the truth, and he knows he needs to tell Blaise anyway because Harry is in their dorm room, but for some reason he feels like he shouldn't, or doesn't want to.
"Out of curiosity, what memory did you pick?" Harry asks and Draco realises he doesn't really want to tell him what he actually picked so he makes one up.
"Yes Harry?" Hermione asks, looking amused. Harry walks over so he's behind her and wraps his arms around her, leaning close.
"Mother this is my boyfriend, Harry Potter." Draco says, blushing as he says it, and Harry can't help but smile at him.
"Yeah?" Harry asks and Draco takes a deep breath. Harrys stupid fucking face just has to be so perfect.
"Room of requirement. I had to avoid all the eyes on me." Harry mumbles, feeling at least a dozen pairs of eyes on him at the moment. Hermione starts rubbing his back and Harry raises his head so that his chin is resting on his arms instead of his forehead. Ginny and Ron start talking about the quidditch match in a week or so, Gryffindor vs. Hufflepuff and it's the first game of the year. Harry was allowed to stay captain, considering the 8th years are essentially retaking 7th year as the war made it so they couldn't finish our education. Ginny is still chaser and Ron is still keeper and they've been practicing all summer. They have only been back at Hogwarts for a week but Harry was keen to start practicing, flying takes his mind off of things, so he held tryouts the day after professor McGonagall told him he was captain.
"It was Blaise's idea. I told him it would be stupid, but then they said it would be a big 'fuck you' to everyone and that it would be funny."
"Wanna stay in our dorm tonight? It's only me and Draco in our room cause not that many people came back this year." Blaise asks and Harry bites his cheek. He would rather stay in a Slytherin dorm than go and face his 'friends' again, but he looks awful and doesn't really want Draco to see him, also if he sleeps in the same room as him he might wake up from a nightmare and he doesn't want that.
"What would your mother think oh god." Harry says, sitting up straight, the blanket falling off of his back to his waist. "I almost killed her son and she saved me." He says in shock and Draco raises an eyebrow as he sits up.
"Yeah. You can move." He says and Harry kisses him passionately, placing the hand that isn't holding Dracos on the blond's side, as he pulls almost all the way out and thrusts back in, hitting Draco's prostate straight on. Draco lets out a loud moan into the kiss and Harry swallows it greedily.
"Okay so after dinner Malfoy came to my room and we spoke and I taught him how to do a patronus and I showed him my tattoos and he said he wanted to cover his dark mark so I tattoo'd over it for him and Hermione I am actually fucked." Harry ends with a sigh and Hermione rolls her eyes.
