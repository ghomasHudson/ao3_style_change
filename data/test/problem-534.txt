“Ok everybody! Good work today, keep practicing your Legilimency and next class we will see how long you can keep your partner out. Don't forget the rules and always have someone with you when you practice. Dismissed.”
Harry grabbed his bag and gave Malfoy a nod before joining up with Ron and Hermione. They gave him expectant looks but he shook his head. He'd tell them later, when fewer people were around.
“Alright, it’s usually easiest if we stand in a triangle shape.” Harry explained. Draco stood in the front and Blaise and Harry in the back. Harry threw the Cloak around them. They moved at a slower pace than usual but continued on. Just as they were about to reach the exit, a figure appeared at the end of the hall.
Dean walked over to Draco and stood beside Blaise.
Something changed between the two of them that night, though Harry couldn’t quite place it. Malfoy hadn’t said anything while Harry cried in his arms nor when he had calmed down and said his goodbyes. Malfoy had gently taken his hand and the pair apparrated right outside Hogwarts and walked silently as the snow fell softly over their shoulders. The whole time, Draco’s presence had felt like an anchor for Harry.
Harry felt Draco sink down beside him. Simultaneously, both boys drew in closer. Draco stilled for a moment before wrapping an arm around Harry, pulling him closer. A choked sob left Harry’s lips and he cried into Draco's chest.
Malfoy scowled beside him. "Bloody wankers can't have just one word for their money?"
“It's strange right?” he continued.
Draco tried to hide his smirk as best he could. “Not yet. He had a delivery at Madame June’s, you know how she is.”
“It’s so...different than I was expecting.” Harry said and Draco could hear the honesty in his voice.
“When performing legilimency, it is extremely important to know your basic rules. Most importantly, however, you must have your partner's consent…”
It appeared Ron had suddenly lost the ability to speak, so Harry motioned to the entrance library.
“It's odd isn't it?” Hermione said with a slight frown. “All these years Malfoy’s been nothing but horrible to you, but then he had such a visceral reaction to your...death.”
They locked eyes, both thinking of the same person.
if one did not attend a wedding. Of course, I don’t actually give a shit about tradition and all that but my parents both do. If I didn’t attend, the Malfoy name would be raked through the mud.”
Madame Hooch blew her whistle and the teams lifted off.
“Neville said he was by the back of the train.” Hermione reminded the group as they carried their bags further down.
“You think the size of the petals have any effect?” Ron asked Dean as Harry drew closer.
“Sleep well, Potter?” he asked as he rubbed his eyes. Harry just hummed in response.
night.
“Blimey, ‘arry! Ron! ‘ermione! Jus’ the people I was lookin’ fer!” Hagrid yelled excitedly. He wrapped all three into a bone breaking hug.
“Regardless, please sit at the table next to Mr. Zabini. It's not exactly alphabetical, but it'll do.”
“Morning.” Harry said as he packed his things back into his trunk.
Blaise walked up next and reached into the dwindling pile. “Harley Quinn? She sounds sexy, Pans.”
-=-=-=-
It was all so tedious Draco was getting a headache just thinking about it.
“Oh dear, I could have sworn I…” she muttered to herself, flipping her parchment around to see the names.
topic of conversation but somehow their discussion of which potion provided the best sleep aid had led them here.
Malfoy scoffed, “Oh please.
In a flash, Draco slapped Blaise so hard he had fallen onto Ron and Pansy’s laps. It was the first thing Malfoy had done since they got there.
to see them. And not make a big deal out of it. To hold him while he cried, to bring flowers for them. Having Draco be the one to do all those things felt foreign in Harry’s mind, but he was grateful.
It seemed stranger now, both he and Malfoy washing up together, as if it were a natural occurrence. Harry didn't look at Malfoy through the mirror again, and soon enough both of them were finishing up.
“Why?” Hermione asked, eyebrows raised.
“Because of this, it would both be incredibly rude and quite frankly
The students dispersed and began looking. Michael called out to Anthony, and the two sat at their new desk. Millicent sat down and grabbed Neville's arm as he passed and pulled him into the seat next to her.
As always, let me know your thoughts on this chapter, and instead of what you think might happen next, what parts have been your favorite!!
Hagrid led them down to the boats with all the First Years.
Ginny turned around and smiled at him, “Ready for today?”
About six months later Luna Lovegood opened her own shop selling oddities and trinkets, The Copper Kettle, directly across the street. It just so happened that Harry Potter was her only full time clerk.
“Want to get out of here?” Drack asked over the loud music.
Harry smiled. That sounded wonderful if he was honest. "Do you think they'll be distracted having the Boy Who Lived watch their tryouts?"
-=-=-=-
“So maybe we got together that December?” Harry offered.
. The bell above the shop door jingled and a happy voice called out, “Morning Draco!”
Harry was waiting for him outside the Clover .
"It was more like we were both curious and horny so why not? It was mostly Fourth Year and the beginning of Fifth but nothing serious."
With that, McGonagall gave a nod and turned back to her seat.
“I’m sure everyone wants to keep their old desks, which is exactly why I've given everyone new ones!” Slughorn boomed, a loud chuckle following.
Draco voiced his agreement and followed Harry out of the kitchen and to the front door.
Draco's expression didn't change as he spoke, "Harry, don't ask questions you won't like the answer to."
The applause and cheers that erupted from the Hall were louder than all of the others combined.
Malfoy didn't respond at first, adjusting the sleeve of his blazer. He picked up a bottle of broom cleaner and said, “Same as you I suppose. I'm sure McGonagall won't allow me to join the team this year, but it felt strange not stopping in anyway.”
“Muggle games, party games, call it what you will, they’re all basically the same. But yeah, we used to play all kinds of things. Spin the bottle, truth or dare, seven minutes in heaven. Of course we’d add some type of magic elements. Adds a bit more flare if you ask me.”
if I may.”
"Right then, see you around." Draco said to the man with a smile as he gathered up their drinks. Harry gave him a quick nod before turning away. He placed a hand on Draco's lower back and ushered him to the table.
"Course we'll need a Slytherin or two but I doubt Blaise'll want to play opposite Malfoy, and we obviously got you to play Seeker." Ron continued.
The Slytherins, aside from Blaise and Malfoy, who were nowhere to be seen, were doing their best to socialize with the other Eighth Years. Pansy was chatting away with the Patils, twirling her hair around her finger and listening intently to whatever Padma was saying.
If Draco could go back in time, he would stop the way his neck snapped to look at Harry. Harry’s tan skin had an obvious redness to it, his cheeks particularly aflame.
“Ms. Parkinson and Ms. Padma Patil here.” McGonagall called as she pointed to the next desk. Thankfully, that left Harry with Dean. He leant down to pick up his bag and move to his seat.
His heart was slowing back to normal but Harry still felt clammy. He had no good reason for reacting the way he did.
“I think I’m just going to take a quick shower before bed, it’s already late.” Harry said as he stood up.
“Shove over, Granger. If we're going to become best friends, you need to learn to share.” Pansy said as she sat herself between Ron and Hermione. Their interlocked hands were almost crushed before they moved them, Hermione seeming more confused than embarrassed. Had Harry not been just as confused, he would have laughed at Ron’s soured expression. He looked at Hermione forlornly over Pansy’s petite frame before looking away. Millicent sat down beside Neville, while Daphne squeezed herself on the other side of him. The three boys remained standing.
Ginny nodded and then she, Ron, and Harry ran as fast as they could to Quidditch Supplies.
“Where to first?” he asked, looking at Harry for quick reassurance.
"That was…"
Mrs Weasley looked at Harry, probably expecting a look of dismay on his face. She knew how he felt about being in Diagon Alley while it was crowded. Instead, Harry smiled and asked, “Five minutes?”
Draco gave him a stern look, effectively answering his question. Draco rolled his eyes then. Harry had definitely heard his fair share of horror stories about their relationship, some even from Draco himself.
“Friends? With us?” Neville asked with a raised eyebrow.
"I didn't realize you came together." the man said. His voice matched his look, deep and burly.
The three of them laughed softly and kept walking.
Transfiguration was their second class of the day and Harry was anxious to meet their new Professor face to face. Surprisingly, when they walked into the Transfiguration classroom, McGonagall was standing there.
Harry turned from his stove holding an empty mug and grinned, “Not to mention my house isn’t the least bit welcoming.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Later on that evening they finally got a chance to discuss teams. The Eighth Years were all gathered in the Common Room with Harry and Ron standing on one side of the fireplace and Draco and Blaise standing on the other.
” Ron said distractedly. People were starting to stare as they realized who they were.
“I have no idea.” Harry said, the other two just shrugged and they walked to the Common Room to wait for dinner.
“Draco must not want people to know.” Luna mused to herself.
"Hey, you busy?" she asked breathlessly, as if she had run after him.
” Ron squeaked as he saw Hermione’s costume.
Ginny still hadn't returned when the train began moving but that wasn't uncommon. She was probably fending off all her adoring fans, Neville had said with a laugh. He had looked at Harry nervously after, but Harry was too busy laughing along to notice.
“Just yell if you need me, ok?” he whispered. Harry nodded. He understood Ron’s concern, but it wasn't needed. Hopefully.
Draco pursed his lips. Harry had a point. It was actually a very smart move on his part. Drop a small seed into the mind of someone who they interact with quite regularly, as well as anyone who had been eavesdropping.
“Shove off.” Ron laughed, at least attempting to come to his best friends aid. “You can hold my hand if you get too lonely.” Ron whispered to Harry. It wasn’t Harry’s fault when a second later one of his toadstools ended up jumping down Ron’s back.
_=_=_=_
Harry agreed and so Draco picked up the now empty crate and said goodbye.
“I have actually. Hermione was around this morning and Pansy told her yesterday.” A pause, then Harry continued.
“What exactly is happening right now?” Hermione asked eventually.
Harry met up with Ron and Hermione in the Common Room. When they saw him their faces turned into an expression Harry knew all too well. It was their
“What do you think Blaise is planning?” Harry asked Malfoy as they cleared their desk.
---------------------
“Yeah. Alright” was all he could say and made his way back to the exit stumbling a few times. Yeah he definitely wasn’t going to feel well in the morning. Draco stood there with a blank face and watched the raven leave. He closed the portrait and stepped back and leaned against the wall.
“ Actually dearest Draco I and three others were wondering if you wanted to have a meeting. I mean really between the two smartest people in our year we should figure it out”
I am truly sorry everyone after I posted my last chapter the holidays were here and that took up two day of my time then I ended up getting really sick from a spider bite and had to go to the hospital. Im doing good now and I plan on getting back to posting at least twice a week. I know this is a small chapter so im going to try and get another one up tomorrow to make up for it. I thank you all so much for your comments and reviews. As always please feel free to let me know your thoughts or ideas.
“Please don’t cry Love, please stop. Stop living miserably and hating yourself. Stop wishing for death every day when you first wake up. Please live your life, I want you too. If you won’t do it for yourself then do it for me. I just want to see you smile again, your real smile. I promise I’ve never left you, Ive been with you this whole time even if you can’t see me.” Harry pulled away and took my face into his hands and turned it to where I didn’t have a choice but to look at him. He smiled that beautiful smile at me and my heart melted. I leaned forward and rested my head against his and gazed at him.
He remembered waking up and Draco standing there then saying he should go to his dorm. Harry was so upset that he did not even fight it. Then he got to the end of the corridor and saw Mrs. Norris so he had run back to the Slytherin common room and beat on Salazar’s frame, and then it got fuzzy. He knew Draco had been there, he continued to think while he stared at the other teens back. His skin looked like silk he wanted to run his hands down his back. Harrys eye widened as all the images of last night came rushing back to him. His face was on fire from the blush he knew he had.
“Come on we need to get back, we all have enough assignments we need to get started and finished” Draco said and the others sighed. They made their way back to the castle and to the dungeons, they were met with a group hovering around the information board, most looked a little panicked. They pushed their way forward and read the posting.
Draco sat the letter down on his lap and stared at the wall in front of him. He had deeper feelings for Blake then what he was letting himself see. He should have known especially with him always pushing away the little things that kept popping up in his head. His mother had seen it right way, why hadn’t he. Because he was an idiot that’s why, he didn’t want to acknowledge them because to him that would be disgracing Harry. His mother was right though Harry would be upset if Draco were making himself miserable because of Harry. He wanted to say it was his veela holding him back that it wouldn’t let him think or be with the other boy, but that wasn’t the case.
The sight that met him brought a deep flush to his face. Blake was staring up front but obviously zoned out. He had the tip of his sugar quill in his mouth and every so often his tongue would poke out to run across his lips to clear any remaining sugar. Blake made eye contact with Draco and smiled removing the quill from his mouth.
“I smell……. Broom polish, cinnamon, and hominess? If that even makes sense” he said with an akward laugh. But caught sight of Hermione’s smirk. The bushy haired girl stepped up next.
“ I smell treacle tart, broom polish, wood, and….. a potion” Draco smelt Harry simple as that, but with the added potion smell he usually smelt from Blake. He also smelly Blake too he was utterly confused at this point.
“Probably after midnight, and since your awake you should head back to your dorm” the blond said and started walking over to the portrait hole and opened it. He stood there waiting for Harry to leave.
“Draco stay calm or you’ll be knocked out again” Snape snapped to the blond.
“Welcome back students and I hope your new year has started out wonderfully. This year the professors and I believe that we need to focus on enter house unity. In the past there has been too much hate and fighting. With the war over we have all lost, and won on some level. None of us want to repeat the past that we have had for generations. So it is our duty to come together and stand strong!” as her speech closed the hall burst into cheers and applause, even from the Slytherins. “ With that being said we will  be holding events for the houses to come together and celebrate, when those times come it will be posted in you common rooms. Also we plan to have two Balls this year not only for unity but for all you children. After all these years and hard ships you all were deprived and we want to give you something especially our honored eighth years” at the mention of the few eighth years that had returned after the battel the hall erupted again but even louder. All the teens looked sheepish or guilty but still tried to plaster some kind of smile on their faces. “Again watch for updates in your designated common rooms” with that the students were dismissed to finish out their classes for the day.
“Sure you shouldn’t have been put in Gryffindor? You sure act like one” Draco mused, Blake stiffened a little and shook his head.
He left it simple and without his name so if Draco read it and the person Draco remembered was someone other tan Harry it would save them both the embarrassment. But if Draco did mean for it to be Harry then the blond couldn’t be upset because he did technically leave a note. He laid the parchment next to the blond on the pillow and slipped out of the room. Making his way through the thankfully empty common room.
“You only want to go because someone told you, you couldn’t”
“What time is it” Harry rasped out and stood up slightly swaying.
“Well I can’t go back tonight so I guess Ill just crash here in the common room” with that he started to make his way over to the chair he had been in before he left.
Chapter 6
“One thing I will say about Potter Draco is that he never breaks a promise” The tall man whispered and pulled away. They both straightened themselves back up but the tall black haired man had a knowing smirk on his face. Draco gave him one back and they left it at that. Soon the others started flowing in, then finally the Slytherin group. Apparently Blaise wasn’t overly pissed at him because he sat on one side of him and Pansy the other, but he didn’t even look at Draco, Blake sat down glanced at the blond and went about setting up his station. Soon Snape began his lecture reviewing from last year.
“No one will see it Ill have Hermione heal it” Harry said walking over to the girl and as she raised her wand Blaise gripped her wrist lightly.
Blake groaned and shifted trying to get out of Dracos arms. When he could not his eyes fluttered open and met Dracos. He looked confused but then realization kicked in and he sat up some. The movement caused Blake to hiss and his hand flew to his stomach and he doubled over, his body covered in sweat now.
Draco sat up straighter and leveled a sneer at the other boy as he ran his hand through his hair.
“If either of you go to that party consider our friendship over” he tossed over his shoulder then slammed the door.
Blaise choked on his saliva and the other Slytherins looked surprised by the information. Rons face was now as red as his hair at the information he had let slip. The Slytherins were quick to let him know they were just surprised and it didn’t bother them in the least. Draco knew Blaise was doing a dance in his head right now.
Soon breakfast ended and the group made their way to potions class. The four Slytherins made their way to their table and was surprised when the two Gryffindor’s followed them and started setting up their stations. Needless to say Pansy and Blaise were out of their mind with excitement and quickly sat on either side of Ron and Hermione, leaving Blake and Draco to themselves. Blake smiled on happily at the four, obviously content with his hard work. Draco on the other hand was looking at Blake, admiring the beauty of him. His skin seemed to glow in the dim light, his hair reminded him of milk chocolate, and those damn eyes. One a beautiful emerald and the other so dark it almost looked onyx, and they did things to Dracos heart he refused to think about it, but it was getting harder and harder. He was brought out of his thoughts when a hand was placed on his shoulder. He jerked his head around and met the smirk of his Godfather, but it wasn’t aimed at him, the raven haired man was smirking at a red faced Blake who was glaring at his desk. Draco raised an eyebrow at Snape in question.
“Wait you said until someone let them in, so they’re in the snake pit right now?!”
“Oh that’s right you all are the perfect little pure bloods now. Though not by much, Daddy dearest is still a shame to the black blood line. Too bad he didn’t die that night” Ron spat, a fist connected with his jaw.
“Oh my god Blake you have committed a horrendous crime! How could you bring something red into the Slytherin lair” Pansy shrieked and faked a swoon like she was going to faint from seeing the offending blanket. Blake rushed over and threw the blanket into his trunk and slammed the lid. He shot Pansy an irritated look then threw a book at a laughing Blaise before he climbed up onto his bed and made to closed the curtain.
“Well I did always like a good challenge” he said with a smirk and both Blaise and Pansy groaned. Blake looked up to him with determination in his eyes.
“I promise to never leave you” the smaller boy said in his soft sweet voice.
The two Slytherins watched the obviously angry girl drag the two away then looked at each other.
“No I haven’t she’s her own woman as I said and I agree with her. Go do what you want but leave her and I for that matter out of it” Harry said calmy. Ron glared at both of them and went to storm out of the room.
“Blake is quite lovely” Dracos eyes went wide and he smacked himself. Pansy burst with laughter thankfully it was soon over, and she was wiping tears from her eyes.
“Well since that fun is over I’m going to go get ready for this miserable day” Draco announced but stopped when he heard Blake having a fit just behind the door.
“No Im not going anywhere” and he stepped forward then sat down next to Draco. “I didn’t realize and Im sorry.” He stopped waiting to see if the blond would yell or scream at him but when noting came out, he continued. “Your amazing Draco, you have kept going and continued to live even after you lost your mate. Im proud of you and your strength” after he finished what he was saying he wrapped his arm around Dracos shoulders then wrapped his other arm around his knees and hugged him.
The bell signaled the end of the class and they all stood packing up their things. Blake walked up towards Snapes desk and leaned over saying something quietly. Snape nodded his head and replied, then sat a hand down on his shoulder, Blake nodded his head and smiled then turned around and walked out of the classroom. Draco gave Severus a pointed look and the man had the audacity to smirk and shrug. So Uncle Sev knew this boy too. Once the three friends walked out, they were surprised to see Blake waiting. Blaise walked up to him and threw an arm over his shoulder and started walking off with him as Draco and Pansy followed behind.
“And how is that my fault I just wanted a nap is that a crime” at this point he had sat up and had his back up against the front of the couch rubbing his head. Draco slid down into the couch on Blakes left side and Pansy on the right. The smaller teen looked up when Pansy spoke next.
Further down the table sat Millicent Bulstrode, Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson, Theodore Nott, Daphne Greengrass, and Draco Malfoy.
Harry took in a breath. Malfoy had to relive that type of pain god knows how many times.
In an instant Harry felt the familiar discomfort of portkey travel. His eyes watered as he felt a pull behind his nose. A moment later all twenty one Eighth Years stood in a dimly lit park. A pond was to the left of them and no people seemed to be around.
Ron leaned over and whispered, “Who knew? McGonagall has jokes.” which led to more laughter from his side of the table.
Draco lifted an eyebrow, “They have those?” Harry nodded.
Harry crossed his arms. “It's not my fault that I got injured easily.”
“So Mr. Zabini,” McGonagall continued without looking up from her list, “That leaves you up at the front with me.”
-=-=-=-
If Harry was looking for a safer memory, his subconscious was fucking with him.
“Uhh, maybe mine? It’s more secluded so less people could’ve had the chance to see us.” Draco said.
“I’d expect nothing less.” Draco said before flying off to the other side of the Pitch.
This was fine.
Malfoy turned to him with a frown but whispered back, “Arithmancy.”
“Right.” Harry began walking away and then stopped.
Blaise’s smile had returned full force. “Of course, Longbottom. That's not so far fetched is it?”
“What was that all about?” Ginny asked once they had all left. Ron explained it quickly and then Hermione explained in detail what happened.
It took a few moments for the Hall to fill up with noise again as everyone processed what she had said.
"The are no
At the counter, Harry was placing an odd looking orb made of glass into a box for an older man in front of him.
“Maybe he felt that way because he thought Voldemort had won?” Harry mused softly.
They were in a bathroom, and a sinking feeling in Harry’s stomach told him he knew what was about to happen. And Harry hoped on everything he had that he was wrong.
Again, it happened, only this time a small cry came out with it. Harry was immediately struck with the reality of what he was hearing.
“But he was a Death Eater.” Ron reminded them but both Harry and Hermione rolled their eyes.
Speaking of, Harry felt his gut clench at the sight of her. She may be small but she was vicious. Her nonstop jabs at Harry for the past seven years are only topped by her trying to sell him out to Voldemort. He hates that he still thinks about that anytime she is mentioned-which is rarely in itself-but the last thing he wants to do is keep grudges.
McGonagall carried on, “I know I need not remind you what our past year has looked like. Which is why, every first Friday of the month will be known as “Inter House Unity” day.”
Blaise let out a small chuckle, “And we are trying to work past that Hermione. We don't want to keep being enemies.” And with a twinkle in his eye, Blaise continued in a rush, “And you must not be so bad if Draco was able to fa-
-=-=-=-
“Now we really are late for Charms.” Malfoy said, causing Harry to stop laughing immediately.
"Bad." Draco finished.
“I don’t know what you’re so cocky about, you had the same idea!” Draco snapped angrily at her.
“Well, shall we head to the common room everyone?”
Harry nodded and grabbed his belongings once more and walked into the bathroom before Draco. He quickly turned on the shower and got in, stripping down inside the closed curtain.
“Sorry for what, Potter? Showing up to class on time? Or remembering your book?” Malfoy said without looking up from his parchment.
“Mrs. Weasley, I checked all of our luggage twice. We're all set.” Hermione said confidently. Ron gave her a thankful smile as Mrs. Weasley finally let them board the train.
Harry and Draco were the first ones on line out of their group, and they were up next quickly.
He had a point. If they kissed in front of someone and it looked awkward, their whole lie would unravel.
“No, I just...I don't know. It's odd, is all. And besides, the Slytherins said they wanted to be friends.”
Ron reached in next and read “Eighties workout? How is that a costume?”
Blake let out a little grown “Ive never been able to get the hang of potions” he was taking out his sugar quill and parchment and setting up his area.
The whole hall was quiet as he made his way towards the stool and sat down the hat was placed upon his head and there was a pause, almost a full minuet later the hat shouted “ SLYTHERIN!” there was another pause but then people started clapping. The boy stood up shook McGonagall’s hand and made his way to the Slytherin table. As the boy started walking towards where Draco and the others were sitting he finally took his eyes off of him and saw Blaise was motioning him over to sit with them. Draco gave a scowl and looked down at his plate. This was their final year why try and make friends when after this most of them wouldn’t see each other much anymore let alone a new kid that was only going to be around them for a year.
“Holy shit why not send him to Azkaban he’d have more freedom there” Ron shouted becoming irate.
“Your done with the tears Draco, you always figure out a way and that’s what you need to do now” he took a breath and chose his words carefully “ Your… happiness is right in front of you. It has been this whole time. Now do something about it!”
The group had shown up early to insure there would be plenty of room for them and that no one else would get to the two before they did. The plan was for Draco to go up first and talk to them and apologize for the past, as an olive branch of peace. So the blond lead the way and once in the great hall they immediately found the two sitting there quietly chatting. They made their way swiftly over to the table and stood there waiting for their presence to be known. After a few seconds Hermione glanced up and her eyes went slightly wide and she coughed a little. At this Ron looked up and had an expression of pure shock. By this time more students had made their way inside and was watching the group. Draco straightened his back and extended his hand.
The three Gryffindors sat in the boys dorm room two of them angerly glaring at one. Ron was still seething from the incident and Harry was waiting for the moment he finally lost it. He had been waiting weeks to get ahold of Ron for all the shit he had been doing. Hermione was trying to think of a way to defuse the situation before it ended in half the dormitory being demolished when Ron stood up and stalked over to her. Harry jumped up and pulled his wand aiming it at him.
Harry jolted awake and looked around, the room was quiet and there were people passed out all around. The lights and music were all off and the room was a complete mess. Movement caught his eye and he snapped his head around and saw the boy he had been wanting to see all night. He was standing there with what looked like a blanket at the opening of the hall that lead to the dorm rooms. He stared at the other in surprise but quickly masked it.
Blaise stood up and pulled the curtains around Dracos bed so he could get up and dressed in the cloths Blaise had brought for him. When he turned around the look of heart break about did him in. He walked over and hugged his friend.
They all looked around at each other wondering who would go first. None volunteering to give up what they smelled for fear one of the others figuring it out. Finally, Blake stepped forward and leaned in taking a huge breath in of the steam. He closed his eyes and a smile spread across his face then he opened his eyes and stepped back.
“Lets go to breakfast Dray” she said. He nodded and followed her out and to the great hall. He saw the two other boys sitting at the complete opposite end of the table. He went to make his way towards them but felt a hand on his elbow. He looked back and saw Pansy shaking her head no. She led them to their normal seats and they sat down. Draco looked around and couldnt bring himself to eat any of it. Instead grabbing a mug and filling it with coffee.
“Blake sent it with me to give you”
“That’s a really good idea Ron, I’m impressed” Hermione said, and everyone laughed.
At that Draco leapt up and took the book. Now that he was holding it he could tell it wasn’t a book but a journal. It was made out of black leather and had a silver crest he had never seen before. It looked like a snake wrapped around a lion, but it seemed like there were two letters woven into it. Looking closer he could tell the letters were a ‘B’ and a ‘P’. It was obviously a family crest, but he had never seen it before. The pages looked like they were lined in silver also the way they glinted when he moved the book around. He opened it and nothing was in it, it was completely empty. He looked back up at Blaise in confusion. Blaise was still smirking at the blond but shrugged his shoulders.
Blake paused glanced at the group then walked over to the three friends. Pansy grabbed him by the arm and tugged him down between her and Blaise. The poor guy almost looked traumatized as Pansy started in on him asking any and every question she could.
--------
“If you would like Harry I would be more than happy to walk your sister back to the common room” he was smiling at the girl in front of him.
“Lets get to bed you all first full day back to school and Blakes first so we need our rest” Pansy said standing up and making her way up the stairs to the girls dorms. The three males stood up and followed but turned towards the opposite stair case. Blaise first followed by Blake then lastly Draco.
“ Draco Darling, please write me within the first week that you are at school” Narcissa said to her son with pleading eyes. She had watched her son die inside over, and over again, over the past few months. His once glowing platinum blond hair was now dull and limp. His ice gray eyes she once looked to, to bring her happiness in the hard times were now lifeless. She had held him everyday since the day Harry Potter died saving them all from The Dark Lord. He swore to her Harry was his mate, saying he felt the pull the smell, the instant spark and connection. She had tried to suggest to him that there was another there he might not have seen or was nearby that was his mate due to the fact after Potter died Draco was still alive. And being a Veela all knew once the Veelas mate perished so did the veela. But that had ended in her son throwing her out of his room and locking himself in for four days. After that she never brought up other possibilities to her son in fear of him doing the same again or possibly going further.
“You can look at me” He looked up and met the duel colored eyes he had come to enjoy gazing at in the short time he had known the teen. Blake then leaned down further and grabbed Dracos wrist pulling him up to the bed to sit next to him.
“You ever say you saw me in this state Ill deny it and call you a dirty liar” he said with a smirk. Blake let out a chuckle.
“Draco please don’t think that, you made the right choices in the end. And don’t ever think you need to pay for what your father… parents did. You are a good man and caring, even I can see that. Please stop tearing your self apart you have no debt to anyone or the world to atone for. I know your mate would not have wanted you to live like this. I know he had to love you as much as you do him and doing this to yourself is probably tearing him apart”
“Told you it would be a good idea to invite the two of them” the Italian said and started to walk away.
Draco was standing in a clearing he had never been in before. The grass was a bright green and littered with small blue flowers, the warm breeze causing them to sway back and forth. Draco turned slowly taking in the sight, it was peaceful. The sky was a brilliant blue with wispy white clouds and the sun was high in the sky. When he turned back around, he saw two people standing at the other end of the field with their backs to him. Draco took a few steps towards the pair then stopped; something was familiar about them. He started walking to the pair again and as he got closer, he saw one had raven black hair and the other chesnut brown. The two suddenly turned around and smiled at him, Draco stopped in his tracks. There stood Harry and Blake side by side smiling at him. They both held out their hand to him waiting for him to come to them. Draco continued to stare on at them not knowing who to go to. He wanted to go to Harry he missed him so much and treasured the time he was allowed to dream about him and be with him. Then there was Blake he wanted to go to him just as much and hold him.
‘No simple answer to that’
“Good you need it” the blond said watching as the four people made their way to the Slytherin table.
“Whose name?” the Blond asked
“We’ll leave you all to your discussion lady….. Black. But we look forward to seeing you and Harry tonight. The invitation is only for you two not the red head” he said with a sneer to Ron.
“Your mate? You never told me his name. His name was Harry.” Blake was now looking at him his eyes had a sheen to them, like he was ready to cry. There were two gasps across from them and Draco remembered the new additions to their group. He shook his head.
“Her what?!” Blake asked, Pansy sat their glaring daggers at Draco and he smiled
“You have a point seems pointless I mean having private tutors then to come here. Im sure he already knows more than what is taught here” Draco agreed with Pansy.
“Live Draco, be happy, and if whatever this boy is to you makes you happy, then go for it be open hang out, be friends, but be happy. You owe yourself and Harry that” with that she took his arm in hers again and they made their way to the Great Hall for dinner.
“Look this is going to take getting use to and we’re going to fall into old habits, we’ve only ever had each other. But we will try, and I’m willing to do anything to get Blake back at this point” Draco said quietly, his head hung.
“Your keeping me from my MATE” Draco screeched and threw his self at Blaise.
“Well you cant talk to him but no one said anything about writing to him” she finally said. “I know its not ideal but you’ll still be able to communicate to one another while we try and figure out how to help whatever is wrong with him and fix it”
“I’m afraid he tends to get a little jealous over things he considers his” he finished sharing a knowing look with the brown haired girl.
“Black” Harry cut him off.
“Your teasing me” he said with a sniff “You know I like you and your making fun of me for it. I feel stupid over the whole thing. I should have just let Filch catch me” at this point Harry was openly crying as Draco stared at him I disbelief. When Harry saw his face, he took it as the blond being offended and went to pull away and get out of the bed.
“Great now Im going to get cussed because of you Malfoy”
-----------------
Draco stared at his friend and schooled his face into his normal mask then smirked. Blaise was right he could figure this out this isn’t the first time he had been denied his favorite toy, and he always got what he wanted, this time he had back up.
“Good, you can get ready and return to your rooms to rest” with that he swept from the room.
“Actually, you’ll see him, you’re not to talk to him or be within twenty feet of him” the Italian said slowly waiting for the out burst that was sure to come.
“Blaise what the hell are you doing here” Harry whispered angerly. “What happened to being a gentleman!” Hermione smacked his shoulder.
“What” Draco asked raising an eyebrow
Draco stiffened but only for a moment then his body instantly relaxed and leaned into the hug. At the words Blake spoke it felt as if all the weight, sadness, anger, loneliness, and hate flooded out of his chest. The tears stopped, the head ache stopped, and he felt light like a weight was lifted from his whole body. They sat there for a little longer Blake just rubbing circles on Dracos back.
“Fuck off Zabini, you’re not his keeper” he said with a growl.
“I don’t give a damn Potter. We have something to discuss and she needs to let me in” Ron hissed
Blake rubbed the bridge of his nose and his eyes scrunched up. He knew there was a migraine forming and it wasn’t even seven in the morning yet. He took a deep breath, held it in, then slowly blew it out.
Breakfast was soon over and as the girls and Blake made their way out of the hall Blaise stood up to follow. Draco caught the letter being passed to Blake but was surprised to see one being passed back right then and there too. Draco and Ron caught up quickly to Blaise who had slowed his steps after exchanging the letter with Blake. The Italian slipped said letter to Draco right before they walked into potions. Even though Draco knew Blake wouldn’t be sitting next to him anymore it still hit home and hurt when they all sat down and Blake was all they way across the room. His skin started to boil when a Gryffindor sat down on the other side of Blake that was not taken up. Said boy was leaning in way to close and being way to friendly. Blake said a few words and gave a shy smile but other than that he did not seem interested, but the boy didn’t seem to get the point. Draco was about to stand up when Blaise shouted.
“ Blaise how many times do I have to tell you Im no damn foot rest” he sighed and propped his own feet up on the black table in front of them.
All that was heard was three different people screaming stunning spells and then Draco fell to the floor knocked unconscious.
----------------
Harry fell to his knees in front of me and wrapped his arms around my shoulders and pressed his face into my neck. I could feel the tears rolling down his face now too, and it hurt me to know he was crying.
“Dray Darling its not that hard for someone to figure out your password. I mean really Emeralds could you be any more predictable” she simply stated while pulling out his school robes and tossing them to him. “Now go do your beauty regimen and get ready for the day. Blaise, Blake, and I will be waiting down stairs” and with that final statement she turned and walked out the door but not before catching the off handed ‘I do not have a beauty regimen’ she smirked and walked down the stairs to wait in the common room.
“He wasn’t in our room he was…….” Blaise stopped when Snape shot him a cold look. ‘Yep were all in trouble now’ the Italian thought.
“Blake hey you need to wake up” Draco pulled the covers from him and put his arm under his shoulders pulling him up.
“Yeah Yeah, have fun I’ll talk to you tomorrow” and he left the room.
“I had to come back Filch was right outside he almost caught me” Harry slurred. Draco quickly shut the exit and stepped back into the room.
‘In, hold, out. In, hold, out’ Draco thought to himself and slowly he returned to himself. He stood straight up and walked to the doors of the great hall. Pansy and Blaise following behind. They made their way to the Slytherin table and sat down waiting for the first years to be brought in and sorted. Within minutes they were led in by Hagrid and the usual speech given, the usual song, and the usual screams and applause when a new student was welcomed into the house. Draco could really care less nothing was the same anymore not without him there.
“Occlumency is...never fun, it's not like you have a choice of what you share.”
“Muggle games!” Pansy chimed in, having been broken out of her Padma fantasy.
Harry sighed and tuned out Professor Dreada. Snape had explained all of this to Harry in his sixth year, albeit less gently. He knew all of the necessary precautions, and all though he didn't exactly
She began reading from her list, Hannah and Susan Bones sitting first, followed by Terry and Millicent. Michael sat next to Justin happily, and Seamus gave a dramatic hug to Dean before sitting next to Anthony, making even McGonagall crack a smile.
A few nights after Halloween, Harry and Draco found themselves back in their dormitory without Blaise. They were sitting on Draco’s bed, Draco at the head fiddling with a pillow and Harry leaning against one of the posts, hands running over part of the sheer curtain of the canopy.
The red bounced off the yellow graciously while the green took in the blue and enhanced it. McGonagall watched the students walk in before turning around and leaving them on their own.
Harry looked surprised, was the first thing Draco noted. The second was that Harry hadn’t kicked him out yet.
-=-=-=-
“Mum...Dad...” Harry started but couldn’t find the words. He closed his eyes and traced his hand over their names as his tears began to fall. He dropped his head to rest against the cold grave and shivered through his tears. The thin material of his costume clung to him as the snow fell on it, making Harry that much more cold.
"Reckon we definitely have a shot at winning." Draco said in response. The compliment to Harry was hidden in between his words.
Everyone at the table was caught up in the new topic and were just as loud as before. Except for Draco. He seemed to have sensed Harry withdrawing into his thoughts and was staring at him curiously.
Harry’s arm tensed when Malfoy spoke, causing his potion to spill again.
Before Harry could take in more of the room, Blaise climbed onto a table and cleared his throat loudly.
“Yeah, it was so weird. I never knew Malfoy had feelings.” Harry tried to joke, but Hermione didn't laugh. Ron snorted loudly but tried to cover it with a cough.
“Fine. Whose house then?”
“We sound like we’re writing our own
Harry looked up at him, expecting to see a glare being thrown at him, but instead Malfoy had an almost smile? Harry responded with his own grin, and opened his mouth to respond but was cut off by Professor Deadra.
-=-=-=-
What had Malfoy been about to say?
She raised a third finger and waggled them in Draco's face, "And number three, the two of you are actually friends now. Whether you want to believe it or not."
to be paired up again.
Simultaneously they both said, “So Ginny is going to know.”
-=-=-=-
“Sue, do us the honor of playing Beater.”
McGonagall cleared her throat and then said, “Lastly, I expect to see Houses coming together daily to help one another out. If you see someone sitting alone in the Library, offer your company. Do not let any predisposition on
He and his team made their way to the right locker room while Malfoy and his went to the left. Here they gathered the rest of their equipment, helmets, brooms for those who need them, and mallets for the beaters. They went over their game plan once more as the noise of the crowd began to grow. Soon it was time for them to get out onto the Pitch.
“No way!” Pansy said, “you Halfbloods and Muggle Borns will just put back all the bad ones for the people who don't know them.”
“Night.” Harry mumbled, suddenly feeling exhausted. Draco gave a small mumble of his own before getting into bed.
“Even the Boy Who Lived gets forgotten.” Blaise said, causing a few giggles.
“I'm not sure. I feel like we're missing something…” Hermione said with a sigh.
The Slytherins all said goodbye, none as enthusiastically as Blaise however, who threw in a wink for good measure.
He stood up and took a breath. He'd have to clean up this mess before his roommates came back.
Ron filled her in as Harry shoveled the food that was left onto his plate.
Harry was curious now. “Who taught you them?”
"Goodnight, Harry."
“You ready?” Ginny asked.
Speaking of adoring fans, a voice not belonging to Ginny yelled down the train carriage, “I found them! Down here!”
“They definitely weren’t.” Malfoy’s grin finally enveloped his face.
“Boot get over here, you're playing Beater.” Malfoy announced.
Harry chuckled quietly. “We might even win the costume contest.”
Harry wasn’t entirely sure how they had arrived at
“Shit!” Harry yelled and tripped over his trunk, his book flying from his hand, landing inside with a thud.
Harry reached out and grabbed Malfoy’s arm before taking off in a sprint.
“Ah! Harry welcome home! Draco was just telling me about your Defense class today. Thoughts?” Blaise said, his signature smile on his face.
Malfoy stopped abruptly as Harry stood there laughing.
Ginny nodded in agreement. “And what about Seeker?”
Draco closed the distance between them by bringing Harry's face to his. He had both hands cupping Harry's face now, and Harry let out a small surprised sound. Draco felt him smile into the kiss which prompted his own.
Harry thanked her while Draco stayed silent, still staring at Harry.
ones..."
Harry thought with quiet pride at Malfoy’s success. Harry stood up and took a breath. Suddenly, the ground beneath him shifted and Harry staggered down and started sliding to the left. He tried to grab onto something,
Harry tried to control his breathing so his current state wasn't noticeable. If the look on Malfoy's face was any indication, he wasn't selling it.
“Mate, you Ok? I mean, bloody hell, your room assignment is…”
Harry turned away from him, feeling utterly confused, and stripped into his pajamas. Blaise followed suit and after a few minutes, Malfoy walked back into the room, a hand massaging his heart over a silk pajama shirt. Harry scoffed to himself, of course Malfoy would have silk pajamas. Harry looked down at his own clothes, an old Chudley Cannons t-shirt and a pair of pants that were slightly too big on him. If you asked Harry, he was much more comfortable.
“Missing your seat partner, Potter?” Millicent giggled as she wrangled her Leaping Toadstools into a pot.
Draco turned around so quickly he spilled his own potion.
Neither of them moved from their seats. They just sat there staring.
-=-=-=-
Blaise laughed at that, “Come on Potter, we might be Pureblood but we’re not daft. Millie’s Halfblood though, so she grew up watching movies and stuff.”
"You look good." Harry said with a smile. His heart was oddly beating stronger than before.
“We know our past...behavior wasn't acceptable and we are asking for a second chance.”
“Draco!” Blaise yelled from across the room.
“Oh Harry!” Hermione called out as Harry entered the Common Room. She was sitting in front of the fireplace on a couch with Justin.
Pansy had met up with Draco after also going to Madam Puddifoot’s with Padma and the pair had, as Pansy said, “had a long talk about various
Millicent drew her name next, joining Dean as a pirate. Padma got the other half of the eighties workout and walked over to Ron with a smile.
"And how do you usually lean in?" Harry asked, even quieter.
“Depends on how my team’s celebrating our win.” Harry answered.
Harry tensed automatically and found himself unconsciously backing away from the case. He felt the heat of the Fiendfyre on his back again, as if it were still right behind him. Of all the horrors he faced during the war, that was one of the worst. He had nightmares of not surviving the fire almost weekly. Or of Ron and Hermione not escaping.
“Now, everyone check the desks for your name and then get seated! I have a very special potion to start with today.” Slughorn smiled and wandered up to his own desk.
With that, Harry leaned in, Draco meeting him in the middle.
“Longbottom, your day as Keeper has finally arrived.”
“Madam Puddifoot’s, now
“I know. Let’s go.” Draco said and Harry felt his stomach tighten with the way Draco was looking at him.
"The club is just around this way," Justin started as he walked, "we didn't want to be too close obviously."
“Draco once licked whipped cream off Millie’s bare tits.”
A few more hours later Draco was once again watching Harry lock up the shop. He said goodbye to Blaise and went to join up with Harry for the second night in a row.
For some odd reason, it seemed like the easiness of Harry’s smile faded.
A Stinging Hex had hit Blaise straight on the cheek and he rubbed it carefully before saying, “Sore subject?” as Draco stepped out of the room. A wave of dejavu washed over Harry.
“I arranged a special surprise fer you lot.”
To Harry's relief, it was fun. He jumped around and danced about with everyone, throwing crazy shapes. With each new song came a new dance move and Harry was getting into it. Ron, Hermione and him sang their hearts out to one of the only songs they each knew, Queen's
“And I’ve got to tell Luna, though since she is Luna she probably already knows.”
Luckily, it didn't seem like that was going to happen, as Malfoy’s breaths seemed to even out after almost an hour. Harry’s thoughts floated back to what he had seen in Malfoy’s memory.
Harry brought the tea over to the table and placed the one with the lemon in front of Draco.
A few moments later Malfoy stilled, and Harry glanced at him through the mirror. Malfoy’s hand was still raised to his hair, but he was staring at Harry through his own mirror. When they made eye contact, Malfoy’s eyes widened for a millisecond before he schooled his features. He gave his hair one more flick before quickly gathering his brush and other items and leaving the bathroom.
“For the next three weeks, we will be working on Legilimency and in turn, Occlumency. These spells are incredibly tough but McGonagall and I both feel it is important for people such as you to know.”
“Malfoy, I-”
"Do you?"
A few snickers flickered through the group but diminished quickly when the door sunk into the ground. A few gasps were heard as the Common Room was revealed. What should have clashed came together in perfect harmony. The four houses were all represented, not separately but pieced together beautifully.
Ron and Padma's costumes had everyone rolling in laughter. Both had electric blue leotards on. Ron's was coupled with bright green booty shorts, neon yellow leg warmers and armbands, and dazzlingly white trainers. Padma's had neon pink tights under the leotard, paired with bright green leg and arm warmers with matching shoes to Ron. Both had their hair teased to gravity defying heights.
“Besides,” said Blaise intervening, “we do actually want to be friends!”
"Never got that far. Neither of us wanted to. Like I said it was more of a way to get off. Strictly handies and blowjobs. He's a good looking bloke but not really my type."
Draco rolled his eyes. Ok, now he was thinking way too much into it.
“Really!” Blaise said, looking even happier than before. “Because I know for a fact that Malfoy
Of course, always wanting to make an entrance, Blaise had chosen to get ready in their room. He forbade anyone except Draco from entering and so the two of them were still downstairs.
Multiple hands shot up, including Hermione, Pansy, Michael, Daphne, and Seamus.
Draco nodded. He understood that completely.
Harry smiled at him, “That I can do.”
“We just don’t want you to get hurt, Draco.” Millie said quietly.
And, as always, let me know what you thought of this chapter! Little fun fact about this fic, the next chapter wasn't even going to be in it I was going to end it here. But I couldn't possibly stop writing when they just got together! So the last chapter is like a little bonus for you guys <3
Draco got himself ready for bed on autopilot. His mind was completely focused on what had just transpired.
He ran all the way back to the Common Room, yelling the password and catching his breath as the door slowly sunk down.
Hermione nodded. “Then they started telling me all about their plans for the party, and asking if
Blaise fell to his knees with a yelp, eyes tightly shut in pain. Seeing as his friend was now incapacitated, Theo stepped forward.
"Everyone get with your partner! We've got to sign up for the contest." Hermione said as they reached the club. Once they were partnered and grouped up they walked over. They made it in without difficulty and lined up.
"Piss off," Ginny laughed as she playfully pushed him, "Half of them have played on the team with you, remember?"
with Matt for a few months about a year later.”
Malfoy frowned. “Since when did you care about being on time to class? Every Potions class we had together you walked in late. Not to mention all the classes you missed due to
at the odd fashion they were displaying. Hermione had tried on a dress so colorful, so frilly, and so large it had left the three of them doubled over in laughter.
Immediately when they walked in a group of voices called out to them from the back of the pub.
Despite the fact that Malfoy wasn’t there, the other students poked fun at the two anyway.
Draco raised an eyebrow, “What makes you so sure I wouldn’t have?’
Just as Harry turned to voice his thoughts to Draco, Draco turned to him.
“So what’d you think?” Ginny asked him once the Pitch was clear.
Harry looked down at his own photo. It seemed simple enough. A short white toga with a golden headband around the forehead. Sandals that wrapped around his calves and a golden belt around his waist.
Not that he would ever ask him. But he did make the most sense.
Justin got up to grab more parchment and Hermione turned to Harry with concern.
Chapter 1
“I agree, but if his health is that bad, he shouldn’t probably be here though” Pansy said
“I do see that but Im not going to sit back and watch you sleep with anything that has legs. Go sew your oats but im looking for a real relationship now. I don’t have to wait” she threw back to him.
“Good morning Draco sorry we woke you how about laying back down for a few more Z’s” when his name left Blaises lips Blake Stiffened instantly.
‘Yes, family trait. Why didn’t you stay with your family if they are your only family left?’
“That’s exactly what I said Malfoy” Blaise smirked and stood by the door waiting for his friend.
‘They hated my mother because she was a witch, said witches and wizards are freaks. I lived in cupboard until I was eleven and that’s not even the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the hell they put me though. So I left as soon as I was able to. Do you like your family’?
“I said she’s not going Zabini, if you have a problem with it do something about it.”
“There’s no good explanation Pansy. I fucked up and hurt Draco, short and simple” within seconds Blaise was on his feet grabbing Blake by his collar and dragged him half way across the table. But before the olive skinned boys fist could do any damage it was caught in a bone crushing grip and what felt like claws cutting into his wrist. He whipped his head around and was met with the midnight black eyes of Draco. He was stunned at the action but didn’t make a move he knew good and well what could happen when a veela was pissed off.
“Im still living Harry but your not, Ill never be able to smile again without you.”
“We can all take turns back and forth hanging out with Blake and Draco. And we can pass the notes back and forth between the two of them” Ron added. “I don’t think it would be a good idea to let anyone know you all are communicating at all right now. I have a feeling they would make that stop too” the red head finished.
Draco stepped forward and reached out to Harry and wrapped his fingers around his wrist, and pulled him forward to his chest while his other arm wrapped around his back, and held Harry. His hold on him tightened as he took in Harrys sent. He could smell the wood, broom polish, and trecal tart underneath all the mud, dust, and sweat that covered him. Draco brought his hand to Harrys chin and lifted it to look into Harrys eyes. He saw no fear, hatred, judgement or anything, he saw a blank slate. Draco opened his mouth and began to speak. “ Harry I have loved you since……” he was stopped by a hand to his lips. Harry was staring at him with pain and sorrow.
“Now who has the staring problem” he mouthed to Draco and winked. The blond glared and snapped his head forward to at least pretend to listen to the lecture. He looked over at Blaise and saw he was focused on the red head in front of him probably fantasizing about what he’d rather be doing to him.
