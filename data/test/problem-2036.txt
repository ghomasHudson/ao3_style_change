Harry nodded, choked up and embarrassed, but his eyes were still burning. “Once she is, I’m going to bloody get them. I’m going to make them regret it.”
After eating their fill they stumbled back to the tower, both very heavy and hardly able to speak, and collapsed on the cozy sofas. There was no mention of the fact Malfoy has actually consented to sleep in Gryffindor for only one night; instead it seemed like an open agreement. For a long time they just stared comfortably at the fire, finding the silence between them both easy and natural. it didn’t feel odd anymore, to have this with Malfoy. Harry had come to expect it, even. He knew that when he was around Malfoy, he was at ease. They just understood each other, even without speaking. It was a connection quite different than the one he had with Ron and Hermione. Of course, he would give his life for them; the love he had for the both of them was stronger than any natural force in the universe. But the way he felt about Malfoy was… well, it was still complicated, and still brought him a lot of questions and concerns. But it was also easy in a way, easy and fun. And just… right. That was it: it felt right to be around him. Like he’d been missing something for a long, long time, and now he finally found it. whenever he saw the pale face brightening with a smile, he felt those annoying butterflies hitting the walls of his belly. He enjoyed being around him, enjoyed watching him happy.
“No, I’m sorry, but no way. You’re not going.”
“Yes,” Harry said, not the least bit hesitant. “Thank you.”
“Of course. You always say that, Potter. You never make good on your word, though.”
“Yes, I ran! I just killed a man who was trying to take me back to Azkaban, thereby ensuring I will most definitely go back for life! I couldn’t bloody stay there, could I? I ran. That’s why I had to disappear. That’s why I can’t ever… it was all over for me then.” He huffed and lowered his glance to the carpet. “Look, I know that you’re an Auror, I’m not a fool – I know you’ll need to… do something about it. If you want to arrest me, whatever, do what you must. I just thought you should know, because – because he’s dead. The man who hurt me most… he’s dead. He can’t do anything anymore.”
“What? When?” Harry was standing in front of him now, and everything was so much more difficult.
Draco shrugged and sat himself down. “Do you want anything to drink? I’m afraid I only have water or tea.”
“The flat. I need to go to the flat.” The idea came suddenly, and Draco knew with everything he had that it simply had to be done. It had to, because he had to know, he had to try to understand somehow. This was the only way.
“Yep,” Ron got to his feet and offered her a hand. “They were at the very first place I looked. Still at dinner.” Hermione returned his smile. “If something’s wrong I’ll just hex them. I hope that’s all right.”
“Sorry, sorry, my bad. What I meant was, it’s fine. My leg is fine, my chest is fine, my whole body is fine. I’m all fine. I’m eating every day and I’m doing bloody fine. So you can stop worrying about me, all right? Because it’s only making me worse, I swear.”
“Don’t say it like that. It’s not got to be
At some point they had to come back in, though, when it was getting too dark to see. They missed lunch, so by dinner time they were absolutely famished, and both rejoiced in the fact that once again Snape was missing and they could sit together.
Waking up he felt stronger than ever, perhaps also due to his back not aching for what must have been the first time in ages, but not solely because of that. What happened last night with Potter – the intimacy they shared, the connection, the way Potter took Draco’s pain and simply joined him in it – it was something beyond words and beyond his comprehension. For so long Draco could only see himself as undeserving – the lowest of the lows, the most horrid and unworthy of them all, but that wasn’t the way Potter saw it. Couldn’t have been – not with how he just fell to his knees beside him and shared it all with him. Like he mattered. Like he was something. So for the first time in forever and ever, Draco felt like there might be some truth to that. Maybe, and it was a very cautious maybe, he really could be something.
“But why?” Potter’s eyebrows basically merged into one crooked line.
“No!” she tried to seize the letter from him, and Harry didn’t even notice how it was glowing now, almost blinding. “Harry, stop, it’s a trap – “
“SHUT UP!” Draco was screaming and he didn’t care, he just didn’t anymore. “Fuck you, Thomas!
“Now!” Harry shouted, and he just sprinted forwards. One of the figures got him as he ran, and he could feel the blue paint hit his cloak. When he reached close enough to shoot, he felt another curse hitting him from behind, the spot where Malfoy was meant to be watching. Harry turned to look at him furiously, but he just shrugged and smirked, which almost had Harry changing his direction and running towards him with the curse. But the figure was right there, and Harry got it with a well-aimed “
– and actually divine meaning from its title. A potions book. Potter found him a potions book. He must have looked through the hundreds of books in this room to find something he thought might entertain Draco. Potter took the time to do something to make Draco feel less alone.
“What point was he trying to make?” Harry asked quietly, feeling the sneakoscope spinning faster and faster in his hand.
“Night, Potter.”
he wanted to kiss Draco, but then why did he run off like that? Why didn’t he stay and kissed him if he wanted to do it so bloody much? It didn’t make a lick of sense. And the very clear answer to that – Draco being so far below Potter and tremendously undeserving of him – also helped keep him up. On top of it all, somewhere in the frantic activity in his mind, although he knew it couldn’t be, he kept feeling like he’s being watched.
“That is the biggest pile of rubbish I’ve ever heard.
“Merlin, a little doesn’t come near it. How did they know where to find you? Did you apparate there straight from ours?”
Malfoy laughed and shook his head. “Not yet. Let’s give the torture curse another try.” He summoned the jar from his room and it arrived within a minute, landing on the bed next to them. He took a single cockroach and placed it on the bed, fixing it to the covers by a spell. “Now remember, the key is intention. You have to want to do this. Think of something that makes you mad.”
Harry was already halfway through falling asleep, so all he was able to produce was a sort of a ‘garg’ sound. He burrowed into the soft mat and the covers, trying to let their warmth settle him, but all he could think of was Draco. His Draco who was so strong, so brave. His Draco who loved him. His Draco who saved him.
“I love you,” Harry whispered in his ear, then covered him with the cloak without giving Draco the option to contend. When he took a step back there were tears in his eyes. “I’m so sorry, I know this isn’t fair. I’m sorry about everything. I’ll be just outside the door, all right? You stay here and stay hidden. It’s all going to be all right.” And then he left him there, shutting the door silently, and Draco could only gape at where his figure was a second ago, completely lost.
Potter arrived when it was still late morning, and Draco had never been happier to see him. He made him and Draco coffees, which they took in the kitchen, while Potter told him about his dinner at Weasley and Granger’s last night. Apparently it was a normal thing for the golden trio, to meet every Saturday night. Draco thought to himself, but didn’t mention, how Potter broke this habit for Draco’s sake the week before.
“Yeah… I guess,” Harry wasn’t going to try and deny that. “But it was only because I was so angry, I couldn’t really control it. Listen, I never really – I didn’t actually say I’m sorry for what I did. I am. Really, really sorry.”
Harry clucked his tongue and came a step closer. “Yes. My answer’s always going to be yes, you ninny. I’m happy, I’m so happy, Draco. I’m the happiest person alive, I think. And I’ll never regret choosing you. You’re my whole world.”
“What? No, Ron – it’s me, it’s Harry – “
“I won’t touch you.”
“Don’t give me that look, I can’t stand when you’re all miserable like that. Look, I know you must have a lot of questions, and I’m sorry I can’t give you more straightforward answers. It just hurts a little too much to talk about. It’s not because of you.” He never would have expected such an honest reply from Malfoy. “Even though you still remain a total buzzkill.”
“It sounds great. I kind of like the snow, too. Although when I was a kid snowstorms were the worst, because they meant being stuck in the house with my aunt and uncle.”
“It’s actually, er… well, it’s a bit of a long story. Sit down?”
“Not in Hogsmeade either,” a new voice said, and Draco couldn’t help but stiffen a little; he would never get used to that raspy quality in Greyback’s voice. He closed his eyes. Better than seeing a blurry image of  the werewolf was not seeing him at all. “Canvassed the entire town. I don’t know where they Apparated to, Lucius, but it wasn’t there.”
agreed,” Draco said eventually. “I will not quarrel with you anymore, for I see it's useless, but know this one thing. If anything happens to you – to any of you – I will never forgive you, Harry. Never.”
“My, Potter, are you slow this time of night.”
“Yes, but since you didn’t give him any other explanation, that’s how he sees it. And he’s so upset about it, too, because right now you’re the only friend he has, and he thinks he lost you.”
“Whaddaya mean?” was the best he could pull.
was a whole new level of softness.
Draco shrugged, because nothing mattered anymore. His flowers were dead anyway. His father, if it even was him, was gone. And He was… he bit his broken lip. “Sorry.”
Harry chewed on his lip for a little while, staring at the flames. God, how he wished Sirius’s face would pop out of them right now and give him some advice in his bark-like voice. It was with a pang that he realized he hadn’t been thinking about Sirius as much these past few weeks. It was a weird, painful feeling in his gut. He felt like he might be sick.
anything has ever been. Literally, the knife, in his hand. Cold and metallic and proven to be sharp. But he hesitated, still; even when he told himself all of what He did, even when he reminded himself how He betrayed him. How He lied, and killed, how He was responsible for Grove, how He was trying to take over the world, how He never really loved him. It wasn’t enough, for some reason. It wasn’t real enough to be comprehensible. Draco could only focus on what he knew, on what he could accept, and it was a very limited number of things.
“I… I guess,” he said, uncertain.
life Draco had been practically a toddler, and so he didn’t have much experience. Most of what he did see were hard, cruel things and delight was as rare in them as was compassion. And Potter – Potter was filled with them both, and even more. He was everything good Draco never had, and at this point it didn’t even matter that his heart was torn or that he was His or that he was not even a complete person. Draco realized that it was far too late for any sort of precautions. He was long gone.
“Me?” Draco threw his head back in laughter, and the long expanse of his neck was doing something odd to Harry’s pulse. “Oh, by Neptune, no. I came up because…” droplets of water trickled from his hair and down his bare chest. Averting his gaze now would be an impossible mission for Harry. “You know how I’m named after the stars. I always wished to see them.”
” She must have understood how upset he was, because her face opened in shock.
“I – is it all right if we sat down? I feel a little woozy.” Draco eyed him for a second, then gave a stiff nod. Potter tottered to the sofa, and Draco took the armchair, as far away from him as possible. Still in his mixture of emotions he felt since Potter first knocked, he realized there was also relief. Not to be alone, to have someone here with him. Even if that someone was Potter. Even if what he wanted was another go on Draco’s roller coaster of personal hell.
Harry rubbed his eyes and got up. “Till next week then, you big prat.”
from some nowhere place in north London. So, spill. What really happened and why did you bullshit the captain?”
“Right. And how much of it did you copy off of Granger?”
“What are you even
“Let’s not start talking about what’s pathetic or not, all right, Draco? I don’t think you really have a leg to stand on here. And in regards to your ‘boyfriend’, that’s just - ”
“Crucio!” Harry jumped onto the staircase and, judging by her stunned expression, caught her right in the chest. She gaped at him for a second before falling with a rather satisfying
“Please,” Draco scoffed, and it resonated through Harry’s body like a gong. “I have no feelings for the sappy loser. He is so
“Is that what you think?” Harry asked in a faux-worried tone. “How do you know what he plans to do to me, anyway? Did he finally take you in? Are you now stupid enough to follow in your dad’s footsteps?” he threw Malfoy's left side a look. “How’s your arm doing these days?”
Malfoy stared at him, maybe too stunned to speak. “That’s not going to be enough,” he whispered, his eyes huge. “Potter, that’s not enough to beat him.”
We are at the very darkest part of the tunnel, but some say there is light at the end of it, right?
“Oh, please, you were a child. We were all children.”
not bloody dead.”
“Erm, can we do Indian? From that place that does the Vegetable Pakora Currie.”
“Because you will
him? Harry didn’t love him. Harry couldn’t love him. Draco was an eggshell of a man, a cracked and useless pile of rubbish, and hell, none of it made any sense. He couldn’t, he couldn’t handle this, he couldn’t take this much… he couldn’t…
Wasn’t that what He called Draco, too? Wasn’t that what he was to him, in the end? A thing, a possession? Wasn’t that all he was good for? Something inside him – something that was hot and painful and sensitive and eternal – snapped to a million tiny little pieces, there, then. Irreversible. The bracelet shook in his hands, clanging lost to the ringing sound in Draco’s ears
stop!”
“Oh,” Draco said, surprised. He bit his lip, but there was no stopping what his insane tongue wanted to say: “We don’t really need two. One will be enough.”
He wasn’t exactly rushing towards the prospect of meeting dark wizards. His heart was nearly frozen with hollow fear as he sat on the sofa. But seeing the pain in the grey eyes was enough to ensure he will not stay behind. He will not just sit here and do nothing when there was a chance to save Draco’s mum. A chance to bring back that light into his eyes that will otherwise be gone forever. A chance to make this right, all the pain and suffering Draco had to go through this year. And then a small, ungentle thought rocked him, and he could nearly not bring himself to ask.
Draco only spared him a look for the briefest moment. “Oh, right. I, er, asked Aunt Andromeda not to tell anyone, only Mother ever knew. I was very… It was hard for me, back then.”
think is right, we’re just playing into his hands. This is what he wants, to ruin us too, to make us… You’re a good man, the best I’ve met. I know that whatever you did came from the best intentions. But hurting him won’t change what’s happened to me, and – and if he manages to throw you off balance and ruin your life as well… I can think of nothing worse than that. Literally. I literally can’t, and I don’t know if you know this about me, but I can come up with some seriously bad things.”
, who had to be so fucking atrocious. He was sorry for them all. He was sorry, so sorry, so fucking sorry... And somehow, back on his knees where he felt he knows himself best, he thought perhaps he could make up for it. Maybe if he suffered just the right amount, maybe if he hurt enough, he could get forgiveness. Maybe he could rise again from the smoldering ashes, like the phoenix in the painting, and it would be good again? Maybe... Oh Merlin, he was unraveling, just what he’d been afraid of. Draco buried his face in the crook of his arm and forced himself to breathe in deep and slow.
For longer than he even knew, all he wanted was to kiss that smile. Well, now he could, and it only took a millisecond to spring into action; he swooped down, kissing him eagerly, and Malfoy chuckled and let him in. This was the best thing he ever did in his life – screw that cooky tournament, fighting Dementors, killing Tom Riddle’s memory – this was the real deal; holding Draco Malfoy in his arms and kissing him like there was nothing else in the world that could matter.
He was at war. For days now he was at war. One would think that by now he’d be used to it, a seasoned veteran, but he was just bloody exhausted. This one wasn’t altogether different than battles he’d fought in the past. It revolved around the same principles; loyalty, redemption, obligation. His fucking tendency to destroy any and every good thing he had. The sick way he couldn’t even stick to his own bloody decisions. How pathetic, how weak he was, and how he was always spinning just outside of control, with no chance of ever really grabbing it.
“Draco, you must understand. I didn't know you back then. All I knew was that I needed someone – someone whose blood was powerful enough, someone who bore Father’s Mark. My options were incredibly slim, and then I saw you, and I knew… I knew you had to be the one. Imagine my surprise when I learned Father thought the same thing! He was preparing you for me all along, my love. It was all a part of his plan.”
That remark seemed to bring Malfoy’s fighting spirit back somewhat. “Right, because you people are so frightening.” Harry could feel Ron tensing on the other side of the table.
“Oh, I think I do. I think I know you very, very well. How many years now have you been bullying everyone around? How many years have you made it your mission to make me miserable?” Harry could feel it all swelling inside him: all the years of being mistreated, all the times he humiliated him, the injustice of it all … Snape always taking his side… Snape, in general… and Sirius… “How many times have you proved that you are nothing but a selfish, scared, evil fucking psychopath?”
Draco did jump now. Potter’s voice erupted from the little rectangle, almost as loud as the actual Potter beside him. “H-hello?” Draco asked, very timidly, his hand holding the wonderous object a little shaky. Obviously he knew there was no fireplace in the room, and he understood Floo powder didn't actually play any part in it, still he was surprised that the actual
Pansy, being Pansy, didn’t keep her opinions to herself. “You have to tell Blaise and Theo, darling. Even only for the fact they will most definitely kill you if they have to find out through the
The dream… such a beautiful, beautiful torment. Damn it, Draco wasn’t done with it yet. He would have spent hours in the dream, days, only to soak in every possible second of Harry’s presence, even though it was only imagined. It truly didn’t matter. In the cusp of death, in his dreams, those were the only places Draco could have him. When he was awake he had nothing. No, wait, that was wrong; he had Him, which was everything, what he longed for and what he deserved. What he deserved… There was something he learned about that. Something not in a dream but in a similar state, and Draco could feel it right there in a corner of his chest where his heart was still meant to be, but couldn’t quite access it yet. Everything hurt so superbly.
And that was all it took to draw out all the malice in Draco, all the venom still rampaging in his bloodstream, all the hurt and anger and desperation bubbling inside him. “What the actual fuck!” he screamed,
Potter just stared at him, flabbergasted. It took him a full minute to recover. “He…”
The thing Harry kept fearing, his ‘something big’, happened that night, or more accurately in the wee hours of the morning; twelve Death Eaters escaped Azkaban in the second-largest mass breakout ever to be reported. Among the escapees, all of them familiar to Draco, was one he knew particularly well. It would seem that Lucius Malfoy did not, in fact, die in prison. And not only that he didn’t die, but as of Saturday morning, he was also on the loose.
“Sure. Bye, Potter.”
“Draco…”
. Sometimes it was just common sense, like
Draco shook his head, because he had no fucking idea. He gestured towards the door.
Finally he managed to stumble inside, blinking his eyes that didn’t see much, not entirely due to the darkness. There was no light in the living room, and the bedroom door was still closed. Was he alone? “Sir?” he tried in a tense whisper, then a little louder, “Sir?” no response. He must have been alone then. Draco sighed, took off his coat and hung it on the rack. The flat was bloody freezing, almost as bad as outside, and Draco wistfully thought of warming charms as he lowered himself to his knees in his corner of the living room. Gods, warming charms. And that little ball of flame he could conjure, too, and carry around in his pocket all day. Oh, and the warming potion that made your breath come out in purple puffs... Draco always loved those, ever since his days as a student in the frigid Slytherin dungeons, but now he was partial to them all. Every charm, spell or hex, every incantation or potion he could think of, all came with that bitter-sweet taste to them. Now that he couldn’t use magic at all he really understood how precious, how dear it was to him. He always knew it was essential – from the day he was born magic was in the very air he breathed. But he never really grasped how personal it was to hold a wand, how gloriously delicious it was to use this power. He didn’t know until his wand was taken from him and broken in two.
“So, we’ve been thinking,” Harry continued lightly. “Once you get the all-clear, or the relative, all-we-could-do, I guess, it’d probably be best if you were living with Narcissa in her house. I’d be coming too, if that’s fine with you."
And so, all right. He will take that. Not because he was grasping at straws, but because it was a real reason, real and important and easy to hold on to. They needed him, Mother and Harry and maybe the rest of them. They needed him, and he will live for them, too.
He grabbed Harry’s shirt with one hand, his head emerging from between his arms, and Harry could see just how pale he was, how distraught. He pulled Harry towards him, or maybe he fell into Harry, and placed his head on the groove of Harry’s neck. One of his hands was still grasping Harry’s shirt, twisting the fabric. The other found Harry’s wrist and he held it tight. With his free hand, Harry wrapped around Malfoy's waist, and for a moment they just sat like that, with him leaning against Harry, and Harry holding him, and they were both quiet. Harry closed his eyes and just
Harry to come for him. Honestly, he didn’t. Keeping Harry away and safe was the most important thing. But… there was no denying that it hurt. To have this proof that he wasn’t worth it, wasn’t good enough, wasn’t really loved. Draco couldn’t really blame him; he would not have saved himself, either. Perhaps he even deserved it. Still, anger was enough to keep him from falling back into that loop; he wasn’t here to repay some cosmic charge, this wasn’t an act of karma. It was his father doing this to him, and his Dark Lord, and Draco could finally lay the blame elsewhere. He could not escape, and Harry is not coming to save him; what was left then? Begging for mercy?
Draco couldn’t possibly speak. Couldn’t for the life of him open his mouth. When a full minute had passed, he was shaking so hard he actually fell from his hands and knees and smashed his face against the tiles. A soft sigh was all the warning he got before He was on him, pulling him up to standing, boring down at him with a harsh stare. “Will you not?” He asked again, dangerous, and His hands on Draco had a very expected result. “Answer me.”
“All right then,” Harry said, and Draco was torn between wanting to fall to his knees and wanting to kiss him. “Just don’t take the next dose, I guess.” Everyone remained stock still, as though the effect was going to be instantaneous.
“You were my son,” Lucius nodded gravely, “and my sole heir. Never mind. I will find a new wife after your mother is killed, and she will bear me another son. A better behaved one, I should hope. Turn around, Draco, don’t make this harder than it has to be.”
"I’m sorry," he mumbled, hastening to get to his feet. "I didn’t realize – I was just leaving."
Harry kissed back, warm and wet and choked, a little, and Draco laughed into his open mouth, laughed and cried and laughed, until – and he was such an
“I’d like that, thanks.”
"Don't move, Potter," said Snape lazily, clearly enjoying the sight of Harry standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake. "I'll get rid of it-”
"Somewhere over there," said Ron, pointing along the shelves. "Got her own little study nook, I think. She won’t tell me where exactly-"
"Aren't you finished yet?" called Ron incredulously.
“We’re worried for him, Myrtle.” Harry tried, softening his voice to what he hoped sounded like a that of a concerned friend. This was his chance to find out more about Malfoy’s weird behavior.
"And the Slytherins don't need a spy, Oliver," said George.
"Heard you talking about poor Myrtle," said Peeves, his eyes dancing. "Rude you was about poor Myrtle." He took a deep breath and bellowed, "OY! MYRTLE!"
"Harry, what're we -"
Nott raised his wand quickly and bellowed, "Serpensortia!"
Harry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on the wall. Hermione was pointing at the topmost pane, where around twenty spiders were scuttling, apparently fighting to get through a small crack. A long, silvery thread was dangling like a rope, as though they had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside.
Usually, Malfoy’s sabotage of Harry’s classwork came in the form of notes, stage-whisper jokes, or small jinxes, but he wasn’t doing any of that. Instead, Harry realized after his third stolen glance around the classroom, he wasn’t doing anything at all. The blonde wasn’t there.
"SHH!"
"Oh, yeah -"
The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room. Wood was the only person who looked truly awake. Fred and George Weasley were sitting, puffy-eyed and tousle-haired, next to fourth year Alicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind her. Her fellow Chasers, Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side opposite them.
Oops, I already wrote another chapter!
". . . soo hungry . . . for so long . . ."
"Oh, that's what you said to it?"
Agh this one's reallly long
"Where is she?" asked Harry, grabbing the tape measure and unrolling his own homework.
"Come and look at this!" said Hermione. "This is funny…"
She glowered at him. “Why would I tell you?”
"It matters," said Hermione, speaking at last in a hushed voice, "Because being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was famous for. That's why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent."
"Did you see anyone near here that night?" said Harry.
As they edged nearer, Harry almost slipped - there was a large puddle of water on the floor; Ron and Hermione grabbed him, and they inched toward the message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it. All three of them realized what it was at once, and leapt backward with a splash.
“A Parselmouth!" The ginger ran a hand through his hair, stress evident on his face."You can talk to snakes!"
Harry felt the fear drain out of him. He knew the snake wouldn't attack anyone now, though how he knew it, he couldn't have explained. He looked up at Justin, grinning, expecting to see Justin looking relieved, or puzzled, or even grateful - but certainly not angry and scared.
Harry squinted at the window. There was a thin mist hanging across the pink-and-gold sky. Now that he was awake, he couldn't understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were making.
Hermione nodded absently, and Harry didn't say anything. His stomach had just dropped unpleasantly. He’d never told his friends that the Sorting Hat had seriously considered putting him in Slytherin.
"I don't believe it, I'm still eight inches short,'' said the red head furiously, letting go of his parchment, which sprang back into a roll. "Hermione's done four feet seven inches, and her writing's tiny!"
Lockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet. His hat had fallen off and his wavy hair was standing on end.
Ron shook his head. Both he and Hermione were looking as though someone had died. Harry couldn't see what was so terrible.
"Ah," said Flint. "But I've got a specially signed note here from Professor Snape. `I, Professor S. Snape, give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to train their new Seeker."'
"Good man," said Wood. "Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes.”
Malfoy’s smile looked strange on his face, but perhaps it was because Harry was only used to looks of disdain, and this seemed to be genuine affection. “Well of course I did, Myrtie. Couldn’t leave my favorite Hogwarts ghost without a plus one, could I?”
The end of his wand exploded. Harry watched, aghast, as a long black snake shot out of it, fell heavily onto the floor between them, and raised itself, ready to strike. There were screams as the crowd backed swiftly away, clearing the floor.
"Oh, no they can't," Hermione explained. "It's not a very common gift. Harry, this is bad."
Harry and Ron went to look. Moaning Myrtle was floating above the tank of the toilet, picking a spot on her chin.
He’d thought for sure that the Slytherin prat would have tried out for the team, or at least bought his way in. Strangely enough, some part of him felt disappointed that they wouldn’t be taking their rivalry, if one even existed at this point, onto the Quidditch field.
“Hey Harry, Ron, Hermione!” It was Dean Thomas, waving to them from the crowd around the hall’s message board. “Come check this out!”
The first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, but there was another board under that, and a third under that one. Harry sank into a stupor as the captain droned on and on.
never
And miraculously - inexplicably - the snake slumped to the floor, docile as a thick, black garden hose, its eyes now on Harry.
“Myrtle, are you alright?”
"What's the matter?" said Harry.
"Oh, no," said Hermione, stopping abruptly. "Turn back, turn back, I don't want to talk to Moaning Myrtle -"
"A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?" Ron repeated faintly.
"Harry, what was that all about?" said Ron, wiping sweat off his face. "I couldn't hear anything..."
"Scorch marks!" he said. "Here - and here -"
But it was too late. A rumble, as though of distant thunder, told them that the feast had just ended. From either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happy talk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the passage from both ends.
Harry and Hermione were all for it, so at eight o'clock that evening they hurried back to the Great Hall.
"Almost," said the ghost sadly, and he drifted away.
Draco Malfoy limped through the crowd of ghosts, quietly apologizing as his dark wood cane went through a random nun’s foot. With his sickly pale face and skeletal body, he almost looked like a ghost himself. “You know that Peeves is only trying to upset you, right? You’re not any of the mean things he says.” He came to a stop beside the floating girl and held a hand out in the air, positioned like he was holding her shoulder. Harry realized that he wasn't in his school robes- rather, he was in a set of black formal robes with silver embroidery around the neck and down the sides. Had he actually gotten dressed up for the Deathday Party?

“Oh, there’s no reason for that,” Harry replied easily. “We can just go to the kitchens and grab ourselves something. Just to hold us till then.” His stomach made that awful sound again, and he wanted to bury himself in the covers and never emerge again. But then Draco laughed, actually laughed, and the sound made his heart soar. He looked at him, a little nervous.
said something too quiet for him to hear, but the men around him roared with laughter. “Speak up, boy,” their master chided, and Potter was forced up to his knees by a spell. “What was it that you said?”
Draco had to laugh. “I’m not saying anything, Potter. The Deathless Elixir is just a myth. There is absolutely zero proof that a potion like that ever existed. If you'd heard of it outside of a theoretical potions lecture, it was probably in some sort of proverb.”
He was in a dark forest, with only a little bit of moonlight coming through the trees. There was a blond figure being held aggressively by a monster with a torn face. Tears streamed down his invisible face as he watched the figure squeezed into an embrace –
Why was he trying to please Potter, though? Potter wasn’t his master. Potter wouldn’t even know. Still, Draco was alone, and He was gods-know where, but certainly not here. Draco needed to offer himself to someone who was
“I guess, yeah. He had some sort of a fit about it the other day, can’t really tell you what’s happened. But yeah, we talk about stuff like that all the time. That’s kind of how we became close.”
Harry gulped a little. “You – really?”
“I think it may be time,” Dumbledore said incredibly softly, as if he could maybe hear Harry’s thoughts, “for Draco to tell us what exactly happened during his captivity. That is, of course, if you are ready to speak.”
They sat down on a bench and looked around. The way Potter eyed everything with a true sense of wonder was disgusting, and Draco was drawn to it like moth to a flame. He knew, stupid moth that he was, the he will get burned. He knew that. It couldn’t have stopped him.
“It’s not that I can’t
All my thanks to
“Get dressed, Draco. There is more work to be done today. Customers will come in soon.”
“Thank you,” he heard the soft reply, and then Malfoy’s head dropped on his shoulder. “God damn it, Potter, you are too fucking
“Oh, I’m sure I could take the Boy Who Lived on my own,” Malfoy nearly whispered, eyes narrowing again, “But then I’d have to explain to Dumbledore why his favorite hero is in so many pieces, and I’d like to spare myself the inconvenience.” Harry saw sparks emitting from the tip of his wand. Extremely satisfied, and not exactly sure why, he took another step forward so his face was nearly touching Malfoy’s.
And well… that counted, he thought.
Draco stared at him. “So you live there alone? That must be depressing.”
“Is that – is – “ Draco’s poor attempts at constructing a coherent sentence were interrupted by more yelling from the ground floor. “Is that the
There it was, that feeling Draco never trusted enough to actually miss: Harry was going to take care of everything. It was only with a little bit of concern that he asked, “You really don’t think – I did murder someone.”
“Who?” Potter asked, and it was way too forward for Draco. He scoffed.
“Right, to have the option. Always with your little plots of rescue and choice. But you will never really trust me, will you? You will never treat me as anything but a poor soul who needs saving! I will not be your victim! I will not lay on the railroad for you to fly me away! I simply refuse to grovel at your feet any longer!”
“Potter… thank you. Thanks for listening, and for not forcing me to say more. I know you must have questions, and I appreciate you giving me time. Maybe one day I’ll be able to tell you everything.”
“I had to, I had to let him know…”
The brown eyes looked away, and Draco took a quick gulp of air, nervous. “He is a friend of mine. Someone very important to me. He supported me my whole life, has been there for me always. He’s very important to me indeed.” Draco had no idea why all this introduction was necessary, not when a simple name would do, not when he couldn’t possibly contest it anyway. “Perhaps it is time for you to finally meet.”
“You are all fools if you think their faces can protect you,” was all he said, before resuming his pacing. The Gryffindors gave each other dark looks, but they said nothing in reply. It was very quiet for some long minutes, and Harry was beginning to lose heart.
For the second trial, he had to ‘fight’ this ‘demon’ in black robes. “The Demon knows all your greatest fears,” an ancient mage warned him. But Harry saw the shoes underneath the hem of his cloak, their soles covered in shit. And if there was anything Harry knew for certain, it was that he wasn’t scared of shit.
“No, he was bottoming. But he told me what to do, because I didn’t really have a clue. Apparently you need to – no, I think it’s best if you didn’t hear too many details.”
I noticed there was quite the theme of the *outside* in the last two chapters - lockdown getting anyone else kind of crazy, or is it just me?
“Wait here,” Draco breathed as he put his hand on the handle. He took a deep breath before pushing it open, then stepped inside. Harry waited, all his muscles tense, his gut rumbling uneasily. He stretched his ears trying to listen in, but there was no sound. Absolute silence. After a minute he could take it no longer and elbowed Ron and Hermione gently. The three came in and closed the door behind them.
He frowned, surprised and annoyed. “Don’t be ridiculous. You don’t need to abstain completely just because you had a few too many to drink that one time. Besides, what happened then wasn’t your fault.”
Draco scowled. “There’s no harm in it. They just want to make sure I’m safe. I – I don’t always feel, erm.” He cleared his throat, and the sudden sting of tears in his eyes was truly alarming. “I’m not to be trusted. They know – even with the potions I take there’s no guarantee that I won’t try anything drastic. So they’re just looking out for me.”
“No one
Draco’s hands clasped his trousers so hard they’ll soon rip. “Talk about – what’s happened?”
“He didn’t choose me, he only tried to save her life – “
Harry’s hand ran through his hair. “Er, not really, no. Hermione and Blaise helped a lot. Pansy did too, though she did destroy the – anyway, I’ve had some help. Narcissa did the garden. Is – do you like it?”
“Mrs. Malfoy is in a room on the north wing. She was there alone when Dobby saw. Mr. Malfoy is there too, but not in her room.” He gave Draco a sheepish look. “Mrs. Malfoy looked very sad, Draco Sir. Very-very sad.” The grey eyes seemed torn with pain. Harry found he couldn’t look at Draco, so he focused on the house elf.
Now he could no longer ignore him; the grey eyes shot up. “No, I didn’t try to kill myself. I think I would have known to slice through the arteries, not around them.” His voice was icy. Harry's eyebrows knitted on his forehead.
to his charges. There’s nothing to worry about, okay? The way it works is simple – “
“Why’s that?” Potter’s curiosity took over for the hurt in his voice.
“But why on earth not?”
“So you admit you want to?” Damn that green.
Of course, in
“Yes. It wasn’t pleasant or anything, but it was all right. Do… do you want to see?”
Improbable, but all right. He can wait. He will wait all night if it takes that long. It’s not like he’s got anything better to do than lie here on the floor, shaking, sobbing like a maniac. He’s got the entire night to fuck up with his head, and then a forever of nothing, so what are you going to do about it? Are you really going to let him be? Are you really going to let him suffer in peace?
“Malfoy, what – what was that?” he could only speak quietly. Malfoy smiled.
“I see. Well, it’s as much as I suspected, but… okay. I think – and please don’t be mad at me, all right? I’ve been thinking about it for a while now. You know how you said you’d been marked? I know you didn’t want to hear it before, but Draco, I really think that the tattoo – sort of – binds you to him. Not in the same way Voldemort’s did, obviously, but that it created some sort of connection. And maybe it even lets him – I don’t know, gives him some power over you, makes it impossible for you to refuse him. Makes it so you won’t be able to go against him. Because you so obviously wanted to, Draco, but for some reason you just... couldn't. I mean, I might be shooting in the dark here, but the fact he knows so much… How else can you explain it?”
His brows furrowed as he gulped. Draco watched him drink the beer as if it was the only thing that could save him now, and decided he did like Potter after all. His emotions regarding the man altered every time he thought about him, but the Saviour of the Free World had a little bit of a dark side to him, which was a very pleasant revelation. Not to mention he was very much a person… Draco must have been affected by the drink already, for he suddenly thought of asking something he really, really shouldn’t.
you,” Draco’s tone somehow rose, although he felt smaller than a knut. His hands were shaky fists at his side. “I don’t believe you.”
“No, carry on. It was interesting. I mean, I sort of suspected it anyway, but I’d like to hear it from you.”
it was – “
Harry did a double-take. “Gregory? What are you doing here?” Snape was evidently too stunned to even sound mad. He gaped at the large boy with eyes so wide they seemed endless. Harry swore silently and took a step back out of the room. He grabbed the cloak around him and removed it, stashing it once more underneath his robes. Then he re-entered the room quickly, visible and standing straight. He met Snape’s gaze without hesitation.
didn’t hurt him. She was his mother.
– there they went again, those alarm bells that he just could not make sense of. What, what were they trying to tell him?
Wait a second - what? An
“It’s… complicated.” Draco buried his face in his hands and tried his best not to scream. Stupid, stupid Potter – what, does he think that Weasley will just let him off the hook with that? That he isn’t going to ask a million and one questions about it, until he weasels out of Potter exactly who he’s talking about?
“Probably could have,” Draco said, rubbing his eyes. “I ate… something. I think. At some point.” He gestured towards the kitchen without looking. He heard Potter go and ruffle through the cabinets.
Draco opened his mouth to say yes, anything, but Potter was already gone, and he was left alone in the library with the heaviest feeling in the world. It became their new tradition, cooking together, and Draco came to see these hours they spent in the kitchen at night as the best in his day. In his life, probably. And to think of their sacred time together, ruined – to think of Potter up there now, probably replaying the terrible things Draco said so carelessly,
“Yes, it’s the only toy I have that doesn’t move or talk or fly or jump or spit flames or do anything, I have so many dragon toys now! but that one is my favorite, I called it Draco, after you, because you’re my cousin, Draco.” His sentences were all jumbled into each other, and it was only at a stretch that Draco could understand.
Draco lowered his glance to the ground, a little overwhelmed already, and he’s not even said a word to them yet. He knew exactly how each of the others will react. How bloody
“But we don’t have to do it right now. Let’s just leave the naming for later, okay?”
“The Triwizard Tournament. The trophy was a portkey. It took us straight to him.” There was a certain shakiness to his voice he really did not care for.
Harry’s tone was careful. “If you want. You can talk about anything. Hell, the first three sessions all I talked about was cooking.” Draco was going to protest, but something Harry said gave him pause.
The cooking was apparently done; Potter was busy plating spaghetti and tossing the salad he cut. Draco cleared his throat. “Can I help with anything?”
“No, Malfoy. You made me stronger, better. Also you’ve helped me master those witty comebacks I'm so well known for.”
“Good.” Potter’s shoulders dropped as he inhaled deeply. “Hey, check it out. You can actually smell the sea.”
Potter shifted uneasily. “It was the loon itself that caught our attention. It was someone who knew him well enough, who has a certain standing in the community. I can’t tell you who, but… let’s just say they had to send a team overseas, and the paperwork alone was a nightmare. They wanted me to go, but I told them enough is enough. I killed him once, well actually – I killed him a bunch of times, but then I killed him one final time – and he’s not coming back. The end.” He sighed into his noodles. “Sometimes I think people are just desperate to have him back so they’d have
“It wasn’t. It wasn’t at all. It was pretty hard, actually.”
“I did too, Sir. Last night was…” he couldn’t find the right words to describe it. “I thought maybe you’d –“ no, he simply couldn't. It was too painful to continue. Draco closed his eyes and felt the hand stroking his hair gently.
Draco shook his head. “You were going to take an
him. That all the things He did, all the punishments and the training and the indignities, it was all supposed to… it was all meant to be for his sake. But He was a fucking psychopath, and Grove was alive – Grove was alive and David wasn’t – Grove was alive and David and Delilah and Butterfly Lady were all
“Malfoy, what are you doing?” Ron asked in Goyle’s deep voice. He too went ignored.
“Yes, sorry. Got a little lost in my head again.”
“Okay. I’m going to give you a few seconds to clear your mind again, and then I'll begin. Remember, Potter; it’s really not so complicated. Just think about something that is naturally a part of you. Think about it, until you think of nothing.”
A spell was directed at him – he could feel the gust of air, cold, vibrating – but never arrived, as something heavy jumped in front of him. Harry. Harry holding – a sofa cushion? Then he threw the cushion at the hooded figure, which turned out to be Jugson, who then proceeded to fall with a look of total shock. But the damage had been done; several people were making their way towards him now, and Draco’s racing heart did the impossible and went even faster.
Draco couldn’t hide his surprise. “Why do you care what I think?”
“Come to me, Draco.” He wanted to, really, he did. He would do anything this voice told him, because it held such a fierce promise for pain. Draco knew without a doubt this man caused it. Him – all the others too – he knew it from his previous life. Back when he’d seen the ceiling and recognized the blond man and knew why he hurt so bad. This man controlled the pain, and he could make Draco hurt again. Helpless tears leaked from his eyes. It was punishment. What for, he had no idea, but he was not going to motivate them to do it again. Problem was, his body wouldn’t listen; he couldn’t move at all.
“Seize them,” Lucius called happily, and without even having a second to collect himself Harry found Bellatrix on him, wand up and confuddled look morphing into wicked smile. He raised his own wand, ready to fight, but then heard Draco’s voice.
“It’s – well. I didn’t mean to overstep, all right? But I needed to – and I mean, everybody would know soon enough, so many people saw you. And I thought you would prefer it if…”
Dumbledore sighed. He gave Harry a very warm, almost pitying look. “Of course not, Harry. It was very clear to me from the moment he arrived that Draco Malfoy is not going to perform his task. The reason I veered him more towards you was only to ensure there was no possibility he would. I knew he would not for quite some time.”
“Yeah, I’m fine. We’re at your shop, then?”
“You don’t?” his face was actually painful to watch.
Draco released the breath he was holding and rolled his eyes to the ceiling. Gods. If only everything wasn’t so fucking hard.
“You can’t do it alone, mate. We won't just send you to a known lair of dark wizards on your own. That wouldn't work.” Harry wanted to kiss Ron at that moment. He had never loved him quite this much.
“Yes?” Draco replied apprehensively. He had a feeling nothing even remotely good could come out of this.
Panic made everything far more difficult, and instead of closing the shop in ten minutes, it took him nearly thirty. It was easy enough to act calm in front of Potter, because the alternative would have fucking crushed him, but now that he was alone Draco didn’t know what to do with himself. He was absolutely mad. Not only was he seen – and by Potter, of all the people in the world – but to add insult to injury he
If his jaw fell open then it really wasn't his fault. “I – I wouldn’t say that.”
“Incredibly astute, Potter. Is that why they made you an Auror?”
It still looked like a classroom, just an absolute wreck of one. Desks and chairs were everywhere and in all levels of smashed; the chandeliers were broken, and fire had caught in the long drapes. Hidden behind poles and desks in front of them stood about five masked figures, looming tall and dark.
“Make him feel safe again,” she said as if it was obvious. “Just be his friend. Make it clear to him that you’d be there whether something’s happened between you two or not. When everything clears... I mean, you could talk again then. But you do want to be his friend, right?” Her eyes were filled with empathy as he nodded, and Harry couldn’t resist the urge and hugged her. She hugged back, fiercely. “Ron and I love you, Harry. We only want the best for you. We really don’t care about the details.”
“And did you?” Potter asked almost in a whisper. Draco shrugged.
Draco’s smile was too pretty by half. It wasn’t fair how he could do that thing with his mouth and Harry’s chest squished in response. “Well, look at you, Potter. Reaching for the stars.” He came up and planted a brief kiss on Harry’s nose. “All right then. Pluto. Pluto Fluffy Foot, for his full name?”
? Are you really giving me that?” Potter’s voice rose, and Draco couldn’t hide his flinch. Which only served to infuriate Potter even further. “What, you’re
No, he still wasn’t getting it, he didn’t think. “So right now –“
The memory hurt, and it just wouldn’t do to think about it now, as his knees were already buzzing pins and needles. Draco tried to concentrate on something else, more neutral. Not the dull pain behind his eyebrow, not the sting of his knees on the carpet, not the warm pull in his gut. Flowers. That was a safe topic. Absently he started to run a stock-check in his mind. Tulips, irises, orchids, roses… damn roses. The store was absolutely chock-full of them. For an uncareful second Draco wondered if perhaps He sent them on purpose – the idea of a fuzzy, lightheaded Draco was surely something He would find amusing – but then he checked himself and nipped the thought in the bud. It’s not like mistakes didn’t happen all the fucking time in the Muggle world. Four years of living like one, and Draco was closer than ever to understanding them, he reckoned. In fact he held a sort of grudging respect towards them. For a whole community to navigate life without magic was somewhat of a wonder. But they weren’t without their faults, Draco reminded himself in a weak imitation of His imposing voice. Their mad obsession with roses was one. Draco frowned when he remembered white roses were his mother’s favorites.
Sometimes it made him feel inconsolably sad, because there was so much and he could never hope to achieve even a tiny bit of it. But sometime it made him feel hopeful. It was certainly a reason, in any case. It was certainly a reason for him.
if Potter ever asked him to.
. But now… he had no idea what he’s going to find in there, now. Back when He was alive Draco always knew. Back when He was alive, and Draco barely was. Back when He was alive and there was the floor and being quiet and dying a little every day in trying to please. Back when He was alive –
won’t let him die, anyway, even if He wasn’t currently here. Left alone in the living room, which wasn’t His living room but was close enough, Draco would soon pass out with the way he was losing blood so magnanimously. It will be a blessing, really. The pain – while very precious to Draco – was becoming a little hard to bear. He would welcome a nice respite.
“What are you talking about? All the wizards and witches in Britain – “
“The mattress! Vanish it!” it took the sodding idiot too long to get to the bottom of his intention, and by the time the transfigured rug resumed its flat form, Draco only had about a second to shut the door behind him. By the sound of it, a giant had torn the bedroom door nearly off its hinges and stalked inside.
“So it’s not your fucking responsibility, Potter. This time you’re not the Chosen One or some other bullshit. You have a commander and people who outrank you and I say,
Potter sighed bitterly. “Okay, if you don’t want me to, I won’t. But I’ll have to tell him
“So,” Harry said out of nowhere, because that was the kind of champ he was, “Actually, Draco, there’s something we’ve been meaning to talk to you about.”
– “No, no, you’re wrong. I won’t be, never again. I have – “
, he had no idea what he was. The only thing he could be absolutely sure about was this sobering fact: before, there was the pain, the terrible, terrible pain. Now it abated somewhat. But before he could reach any conclusions from it, the curtains were drawn open and his heart sank to his toes.
She walked briskly, clearly knowing her way around the place. Harry struggled to keep up with her long steps, feeling rather than seeing Hermione beside him. They were nearly running, he realized with some trepidation. Why was she in such a rush? And where, exactly, were they going?
But then he gave an almost audible sigh of relief as the werewolf released Narcissa and pushed her down, straight into Malfoy’s arms. Her son caught her and held tight, his silent tears weaving in her silvery hair, the same color as his. Harry watched with his heart completely shattered as she patted his wet cheeks and planted a kiss on each of them. Then she rose to her feet and took a step back, looking at the kneeling boy in front of her.
This was ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. He’d already been able to sleep well enough in Potter’s bedroom – what the hell was the difference here? Although playing dumb didn’t really help, for he knew very well what’s different. Here was
“It’s not fucking okay.” Draco closed his eyes, then opened them immediately, startled. “It’s not okay. I shouldn’t have said – I’m so sorry, Harry.” He wanted to kick himself for it. He wanted to kneel for it for hours on end, days on end, forever. He wanted to
“I did indeed. Tell me – do you love him?”
“You’re just going to have to hurry up and kill me, then.” Harry’s voice was so cold. Draco’s stomach did an unlikely, frightening loop.
“What are you talking about?” Harry needed to yell to get his attention. “I never asked you to do any of these things! I never asked you to grovel!”
“Better than I could hope for,” Potter grinned, and he took one step closer to Draco, which was both thrilling and intimidating. “You sure throw one hell of a party.”
“You did tell me to go,” Harry said in a startling, bitter laugh. “Again and again, didn’t you? You told me to leave. Threatened me, even, if I remember it right.”
. Here was
“What are you doing here, Draco? and who is she?’” her bony finger pointed at Hermione.
surprises, but he did owe it to Harry and so he followed, trying not to sulk. He felt especially tender after the session, and that meant that no matter how much he wanted to beg for a reprieve, he just didn’t find the required strength to do so. Besides, however it was Harry wanted to punish him for last night, he probably deserved it.
Unable to take it anymore, and with a great sob, he pushed Draco against the wall and crashed their lips together.
“I’m not trying to sacrifice myself,” he said with the utmost levity he could muster. “Just to save your silly damn necks, that is all.” Weasley grew quiet at last, but Draco wasn’t sure he really comprehended. How could he not? Draco had known these people all his life. He grew up around them, visited their homes, broke bread with them. The stupid Gryffindors would do nothing but get themselves killed before completing their first sentence; but this was his world. He belonged here. Or well… he used to belong here, once. Now he didn’t quite belong anywhere.
“We are
“I love him, I do. More than anything. I hardly gain any pleasure from seeing him suffer. But ruling the magical world will surely be a taxing job, and I might find myself one day simply too irritated to hold back. And there he is, Harry. Kneeling with his tongue out, practically begging for it. You are dead, and cannot stop me. What do you think I do then? Tell me. How do you see this scene evolving?”
“Just not that bright, though, am I?” he asked in a wicked, humorless smile. “You as much as told me you’re still in love with him. And I – fuck, all this time you were just trying to
Draco felt guilty enough to be sick, for he was fairly certain he was the trauma she was talking about. “It’s – really? But what about the Statute? Aren’t therapists a Muggle thing?”
This was another set of bad news. “Well – maybe you should stay here then. I guess there’s no point taking you further into danger. Just stay here and stay hidden, okay? We’ll get everyone back here and ready to go in time.”
There was such heavy anticipation in the air, the question was almost funny. They both nodded rather frenetically, and Draco needed to find some courage now. He lowered his head to the ground and took three narrow breaths. “If you don’t like it – just, don’t tell me, all right?” he didn’t remember feeling quite so vulnerable in a while. With a trembling right hand he lifted the sleeve of his left. Valiantly, he thought, he ignored the gasps.
do that. Especially not to her – with all her kind eyes, messy bun, casually soft air, he didn’t trust her one bit. But after spending hours speaking about things like Bermuda shorts, the Bermuda triangle, Pythagoras and the Greek island of Lesbos – well… he was at least familiar with her, now. And that was something too.
Hermione was first to pick up on his intention. “But you said it yourself, Draco. No venom or poison could affect you for so long without killing you, not from any animal or plant source.”
A swear word muttered in an undertone. “On it.”
“You people?” Potter asked, a little smile stealing on his face. “Who are us people?”
“What was? Saving my life?” Potter asked good-naturedly.
“Yes, if you agreed to,” Harry said, a little imploringly. “I think there’s a lot you can teach me. And if you were to – come with me – I think it’d improve our chances.”
Draco made a small sound, maybe a gasp. "Shit, did I - am I hurting you?" Harry's finger stilled, heart thundering in his chest.
“Of course I do,” Malfoy didn’t hesitate. “I don’t want to hear about this again, Potter. I’ve told you, no one can know. No one. Did you understand me then? Do you understand me now?”
Anger, confusion, exhaustion, pain, everything was so overwhelming. Draco stared at him and didn’t understand a single thing. Harry cast him aside, Harry told him to leave, so what was he doing here now? What did he want from him, why did he come back, what did he think Draco could give him? What? He had nothing. “Harry, please. I… I don’t… please.”
“I am not Draco, Mrs. Malfoy,” he breathed.
, woohoo,” he floated his hands in the air and imitated what presumably was a mentally-ill ghost, “but I’ve been calling you Draco and it’s totally normal and I love it, so – “ then he stopped, looking quite mortified, which allowed Draco to smirk. “Oh, shut up, you love it too.”
“No, nothing in particular. Just with – the Dark Mark – “
“Shit, Malfoy – I’m sorry – “ he said, and it was a relief to hear he wasn’t slurring just as badly. He got up to a sitting position, but he did so too fast, and now the room was whirling around him. He rested his head on the sofa, closing his eyes. From his left he could feel the other boy getting up from the floor too. Terrible feelings of shame and fear washed over him, sobering him up quickly. “I’m so sorry,” he said again, or barely whispered.
Harry’s smile grew wider. “You’re welcome. Did you get any other cards from – er – other people?” Malfoy’s eyes became a little unfocused for a second.
“No, maybe I won’t, but…” he sighed. “I’d like to try.”
“Fat chance, Malfoy. Trying to hog all the delicious food all for yourself, are you?” he ruffled the silky hair a little, and this small gesture of affection seemed to render Malfoy speechless for a moment.
) got him smoothly to his feet, and he picked up the strange note in slightly-trembling fingers. It was Potter’s messy handwriting, and recognizing it made Draco feel instantly warmer.
“I wouldn’t be, not if it wasn’t for Him,” Draco whispered. It hurt all over his body. The normal pull in his abdomen he always had when thinking of Him increased tenfold. Draco owed Him so much, his life and everything in it. And what did he give Him in return? Disloyalty, disobedience, shame. Potter noticed the change in his expression.
Mother saw his struggle and her face softened to an impossible degree. “I have an idea. Harry, why don’t you get the pakoras you and Draco like from your Indian restaurant. I’ll pop by the bistro and get us all duck confit, I guarantee you’re going to love it. And Draco, you could choose dessert? Anything you want. How does that sound?”
“You sleep just fine every night, mate,” Seamus said and clapped him on the shoulder good naturedly. “Keeping me up with your snoring.”
“No, of course you’re not
“She said it was on them, on the Ministry and the Wizengamot and all of them. That they were the reason you’d… well, you know, we all thought you killed yourself.”
Draco’s stomach gave a frightening turn. He was very happy he couldn’t eat anything since yesterday. Oh gods, oh
“Malfoy,” Harry said warily. The Slytherin sighed.
for Potter, who was strictly a thorn in his side. With those green eyes and the way his eyebrow creased and that smile, that damned smile that made Draco feel absolutely
Malfoy shifted again in his seat. “I don’t see how that’s any of your business.”
“What?” Potter shifted in his seat. “Oh, I don’t know. Is it not yours?”
you do anything you wanted, because I can’t fucking stop you, but in the end you wouldn’t even face any consequences for it – you’re the bloody Golden Boy, and I don’t even exist in your world. So tell me, are
“Open your mouth, boy.” Grove’s voice was cold and ragged, and the other three men were very quiet. Draco swallowed hard. “Open up, Draco. Or would you rather daddy would do it?”
“Potter – “
“Oh yes, they’re my favorites. The one lesson where I don’t have to work hard to get a good grade.” They both laughed, but Malfoy sobered first.
her, because she was
“Huh?” Potter looked even more lost than before.
“This is him?” Harry croaked, but Draco could not have answered if he tried. His eyes were glued to the door. There was no escape.
“The Golden Horntail, just outside Diagon Alley. You know the place, a dingy little pub, voted worst steak pie in the country? I was a kitchen porter there when I was on parole.”
Draco would have jumped into his arms had he not been careful. He knew he couldn’t bear his touch, but the temptation to give Potter this little token of gratitude was powerful. Instead he gave him his sweetest smile, the one he hadn’t used in – Merlin, probably in years. It had the desired effect; Potter all but melted towards him, but still didn’t touch. “I’m glad to know that. I was – well, I am now. Happy, that is. To be here with you.”
“You talk a big game,” Malfoy shook his head, lips curving upwards. “But do you think you can follow through?”
“What? Why would he do that? Draco, please, can you sit up?”
Draco couldn’t flat out lie in response, so he didn’t say anything to that. “It’s… how did you do it, Sir?”
“Oh, it's absolutely stunning! Here, love, and I’ll have the roses too. And two of these little butterflies, I simply have to. How much will they be?”
God, it felt so good. Rolling Draco on his back he nearly gouged his eyes out with his ferocity. Touching every inch of his body was an absolute necessity; he had to be as close as possible to him. “Draco,” he replied, barely aware to what he was saying. Some frantic thrashing resulted in them both ending up without any clothes on. Writhing on top of him hectically, maddened by the friction of their skins, he felt the upsurge in his crotch, hotter and hotter –
In a second though Draco was in his arms, and as usual, that meant he had no more complaints. Closing his mind to all the worries and concerns, he simply inhaled him – that lemony scent that drove him absolutely mental. This was what he wanted. This was what he needed. Not even to touch him any more than that – not even to move. Just to hold him, to have him right here, and to hear his heartbeat next to his own.
Well, fuck you too.
“Sorry?”
“Then you should have it yourself,” Draco pointed to his bandaged arm. The green eyes smiled.
for one glorious, warm, dazzling second. Then he crashed right back to the unforgiving ground. Fear was always so much stronger. “Potter, please don’t tell him.”
“Well, that would make all of this a little redundant, wouldn’t it, the whole trying-to-save-my-life thing.” His voice was getting colder by the syllable. “No, I never tried to do it. But I have thought about it, occasionally. Honestly, though, you don’t need to worry. I’m far too selfish and way too big of a coward to ever try something like that.”
“That was the night he returned?” Malfoy asked quietly, and Harry nodded.
“You what?”
Harry’s mind was spinning and crashing ungracefully in anxiety. He didn’t want to do anything that hurt Draco, but he had no idea what to do, as he was all the way inside him. There must be something he could do, right? There’s no way it had to be painful. This was meant to be enjoyable, god damn it. People were doing it all the time, and it was supposed to be good... it was good, before, when he did it with his finger. So there had to be a way. He tried to calm himself down, to quell the blackness that started fizzing in the edges of his sight. No, he won't do this right now. He will find a way to fix it, to make it - to make it good for Draco too, because that's all he really cared about. But how could it be good if it was hurting him? Harry tried to think logically. What they needed was a way for Draco to relax, maybe. If he wasn’t so wound up, it would probably hurt less. Very carefully he leaned down, kissing him softly.
“No, thanks. I’m really not that drunk, I swear.”
, were doing this to him. To
.” The eyebrow went even higher up, and Harry felt sick all over again. “No, I don’t know. I’m not sure what I was thinking would happen. I just said it was a possibility, okay, not a big deal.”
, the man I was – the man I am with – Harry, He did it, He killed them, He killed them all. He…”
going on? He was by Potter’s side all the fricking time, very and constantly close, and it was so surreal that he couldn’t even freak out about it anymore. He sat by his bed and made pointless chit-chat. He helped Kreacher make his favorite meals (and some he really didn’t like, the elf was very inconsistent in the kitchen). He gave Potter his medicine and made sure he actually took it, the big baby. He laughed with him, for crying out loud.
Ron took a second to think about it. “I reckon she’s right. Dumbledore’s the only chance we have to get him out of there with all of us alive. And the clock is ticking…” he gave Harry a determined look. “We got to go now, mate.”
Draco nodded again and raised hesitant eyes to meet the brown pair. For a brief second he could see how full of emotion they were, and nearly fell over. It was all true - he knew it then, everything He’d said.
– “I was trying to – cook – for you – and it’s all – “
. But how to actually say it, he didn’t know.
Draco hated looking within himself. It was never something he enjoyed doing, and – well, once upon a time, he didn’t use to be one for self-abuse. Not very believable – and it almost didn’t matter, since for many years he firmly believed he stopped being this person. Though now, crushed through and through, Draco wasn’t so sure anymore. His heart was all the way broken now, right? He had crumbled to the smallest bits of himself, to the tiniest, innermost, most fundamental parts of him. And looking in – yes, fuck, there was no other option but to now – he found the many different shatters to be extremely varied. There were fragments of a scared little boy lowering his wand on the Astronomy tower. There were shards of a young man pacing the halls of the quiet Manor shitting bricks over the future. There was a toddler running into his mother’s loving arms. There was a man, too sick to stand, crying his eyes out on a frozen cell floor. It was all there, all still living inside him, all these… pieces of him. They were all the things that made him who he was, even now, the things that patched up his dreams and his nightmares, the quilt of his needs and wants and shame and terrors. It was all still there, and he understood now what Harry said, something that sounded so stupid back then:
He was just leaving the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione when he came across the scene. Goyle had Malfoy pushed against the wall, a wand shoved right in his face, while Crabbe stood beside them with his wand at the ready. Harry started walking towards them instinctively, disregarding the urgent whispers from his two friends, pulling his wand as he got nearer. It was only when he was close enough to see Malfoy, and the boy gave him a frightened little shake of the head, that he remembered himself and lowered his wand. How weird would it seem if Harry Potter came to Malfoy’s aid? Even Crabbe and Goyle would be suspicious. So he changed his direction and made it look like he was just passing next to them, but the second he went over the corner he stopped and looked back.
“No, I think I got it. Something along the lines of, I’m a fucking monster and you were just too scared to tell me to sod off for real? That I don’t care about you other than my own twisted desires? Something like that?”
“Don’t worry. We got your back – you're safe with us. And we still have the Room of Requirement to meet in when the rest of the school returns.” Malfoy pushed himself backwards onto Harry, who received him with open arms. Well, one arm, since the other was still around his waist. He was clearly uncomfortable with his recent show of emotions.
For a second it seemed like the Slytherin was going to fall back onto his neck, but then he mastered himself. “Yes, yeah, I guess it was. I’m sorry.”
“It was this thing they used to do when I wouldn’t play along. In the first few months, when I still had some fighting in me. They’d starve me till I was delirious, then try to get me to… do things in order to be fed." Potter made a choked sound, something between confusion and disgust, and Draco couldn't stop himself from talking for some baffling reason. "They trained me to react to some signals they’d devised, some sounds and touches. For example, upon hearing three whistles, I was to fall to my hands and knees. Apparently it’s someone called Pavlov who trained his dog to salivate when it heard a ring that gave them the idea. They thought they could train me to do something similar. Their own lapdog.”
“Are you all right?” Potter asked, brows furrowing.
Thankfully, Potter let that one go. He eyed Draco closely. “So when did you get a tattoo with your boyfriend’s secret name on it?”
Potter’s look was confusion in its purest form. “…Why not?”
“Oh, we should, should we?” Ron’s smirk turned into a scowl. “Why’s that, Malfoy? What are you planning to do?”
“No – no hospital.”
“You need to touch my face,” Draco whispered. Potter didn’t waste a second before a gentle finger crooked under his chin and raised his head, and Draco used the release to immediately close his eyes. He could not stand the look Potter was surely giving him right now, could not bear having to see it. Just how
, when –
, it’s always poor Draco, miserable Draco, pliable Draco to fix and to help – it’s never what’s wrong with Potter, never let’s talk about how
Nowhere was good though, nowhere was ever good.
She relaxed a smidgen. “Yes, well, since your father’s release from prison… since he obviously knows you best…” she seemed to resent this fact, but Harry couldn’t much bring himself to care for her emotions. He was doing his best to keep his own at bay. He had a feeling that once this cold, fuzzy shock would blow over, he would be in some serious trouble.
"I was intolerable?
“Of course we don’t have to do it right now. Whenever you feel like it. I’m here, so… you know, no pressure.”
“Oh - I’m sorry, Potter, boring you already?” there was a slight smirk on the pale face, but he still looked rather uncomfortable. Harry crossed his arms on his stomach and looked at him.
“Then what the hell were you trying to pull? Hurt yourself on purpose to draw my attention?”
“Let’s just say that I do.” Harry smiled and looked at the mess around him. “What’s going on here?”
“Well, they
“You don’t know where my shirt is, then?” he asked with a low chuckle, advancing quickly, not unlike a wild animal, to box Draco against the wall. One hand stayed next to his head, but the other lacked the willpower and made its way to touch bare torso, smooth skin, enticing enough to scream. Draco bit his lower lip, which honestly was a dirty move.
“From behind – so you didn’t see them? Where did it happen?”
That night he did not open the door to Potter’s insistent knocking. He was too busy crying himself to sleep on his rug, warped in the worst panic attack he’d ever, ever had in his life. Potter must have understood, since he didn’t come on Thursday either, nor on Friday. Draco thought it was probably best. He didn’t even go to the shop those days – just stayed on the floor and hurt himself in any way that was possible, because he needed, he
“Well, isn’t that just the appropriate reaction to hearing something like that?” Harry was genuinely confused.
The carpet in the bedroom needed hoovering, and Draco spent some extra time on his rug. He didn’t deserve a lot, that much was true, but he supposed he at least deserved a clean expanse of fabric to lie on. All the while he was battling with himself, fighting this tingling feeling at the bottom of his stomach. He could
“Yes, what is it, Lucius?”
Draco shook his head, furious and antsy. “No, it’s all right. I’ll just be a few minutes, then?”
“Wet,” Harry said, but then he fell into an attack of chuckles and it took Malfoy a few tries to gain his attention with the next question.
. I have to, or it will kill me.” He sounded serious. Damn it, he looked serious. Draco looked away hurriedly before it did anything irreversible to his squirming insides, but it may have been too late. He could feel it already, swarming in great clumps around his gut, bubbling and dangerous.
Malfoy bit his lip, deep in thought. “Is that what you want this to be?”
the way a cock looked. He didn’t
It was hard to come to any conclusions when his mind was shaking in his head, but Draco did realize something. “Is it because of me?” he asked in a tiny voice, only audible to Harry’s ears. He caught a glimpse of guilty green eyes.
kind of idea was this
“You’re the strongest person I know,” Potter shook his head, and it was ridiculous enough to make Draco actually laugh. “No, I mean it. You’ve been through hell, absolute hell, and you’re still here.”
“He is not yours. He will never be yours.” Draco stared at Potter, for the words were nothing but asinine. The opposite was correct, if anything; he was nothing

was his vial of Polyjuice? Another noise, a crash, a mumbled curse – a familiar tone –
“I – why? Why do you want to know?” Draco was a hair width away from breaking into a tearful confession, and he had to find a way to stop. Now was not the time to crack. Who knows when He’ll be back?
other poor Muggles, just so those therapist Muggles could learn how people’s minds work? Swallowing became hard. “I don’t want to be experimented on,” he said as quickly as he could, before he lost his nerve. They had been encouraging him relentlessly to share what he wanted and didn’t want. Well, this. He didn’t want this.
what will happen if Potter will dig deeper? Doesn’t he know what’s bloody coming?
Harry went slightly green. “That image came to you a little too quickly there.”
“All right. We all get some sleep, and then… maybe we can give you your magic back. Gods, Harry, I hope I’m right.”
“I’m not blaming you. The days of me blaming you are pretty much behind me, I reckon. It’s your damn golden ways that melt this heart of stone.” He was being sarcastic, but Harry could find the nuggets of truth in there. He said he didn’t blame Harry, and Harry believed him. He breathed with a little more ease.
The floor became blurrier, somehow, and Draco’s cheeks were cold. He had no idea what was happening anymore.
“Yeah, I mean, now that I’ve found you… I don’t want to give it up so quickly. I want to help you.”
“You said it that night, before I… when we had that fight. You told me that sometimes we believe things because they’re easier to digest, and I think you were right. I think I only believed in the bond because I was scared to think what it really was. I was afraid to think it could just be
“What for?” he asked eventually, bemused.
“Do you want me to leave?” Harry tried not to sound like the question ripped him in two. He didn’t want to make Draco feel guilty. If he wanted Harry to leave, he would just go, and he will not make him feel bad about it. “Draco, really, it’s okay. I know you’ve had… so much shit happen to you. I hurt you, I know that. I hurt you bad. And if whenever you think of me you get – you want to throw up – “
“What could I do?” Potter’s voice was so defeated. His melancholy eyes were a bloody war crime, of that Draco was sure. “I left. I couldn’t stay there another minute with him. That
“Well, no time to worry about that then, really,” Ron said cheerfully as he kept the door open for Harry, who was halfway through the room when the look in the little eyes stopped him. “You have to put on the cloak, mate! What would they say if they see you and the real Malfoy together?”
Draco tapped the stopwatch. The image on the face changed immediately, now identical to the monitors down at security. He zoomed in on the bottom left corner, the recording of the main room and the corridor leading up to it – both empty. Perfect. Another tap; now he was counting the seconds, unintentionally holding his breath, until it was… ten o’clock, fucking finally. Go time.
“Then we should be good.” He leaned forward and kissed Draco very softly on the lips. The blond rested his head on Harry’s chest again, heaving a little with pain, and Harry held him close and wished more than anything that there was something he could do. They stayed in bed for hours, way past midday, deep into the afternoon.
“Yes, according to the Old Ways. You can guess it doesn’t mean much – naturally witches and wizards continue to learn throughout their entire lives, and their potential grows accordingly. But this sort of thing still goes strong in places like the Ministry. Did you ever ask yourself why no one can be granted a seat in the Wizengamot before they turn thirty-four?”
“It will be fine,” Draco reassured him, and was gratified to see the light shining again in those perfectly blue eyes. Eyes which did not, under any circumstance, remind him of
“I don’t know how I feel,” the voice was so low it was nearly inaudible. “I don’t know how I feel about any of this anymore. About my father, the Dark Lord, my mother, you. Nothing is clear, nothing is straightforward. It’s like the whole world tumbled down and fell on its head and I’m just trying to find somewhere to hold on to before I fall into the gaping abyss.”
Harry’s whole face contorted. “So you don’t want to…”
“I doubt I would, Golden Boy and all,” Harry rolled his eyes but still looked pained. “But yeah, I guess if it came to that… I don’t know, that’s all I’m saying. I just don’t know.”
Harry thought fast. It’s not like Malfoy knows anything he would want to hide, anyway. He didn’t know about his connection to the Order, and whatever he could have told him about Ron and Hermione, he would have already been able to learn from Lucius and Wormtail. Heart rate slowly calming, he took to thinking in a different direction. “How did he ask?”
“What did you want to say to him?” Malfoy’s voice could have been a figment of his imagination, it was so uncharacteristically soft.
Hermione seemed to notice his behavior too. “We were just discussing the plan, Malfoy. Ron and I are going to keep an eye on Snape, Crabbe and Goyle. That should leave you free to go to Dumbledore with Harry.”
Only… Draco closed his eyes, which meant he saw Potter’s smile again. Potter wasn’t angry with him for being weak. He didn’t even demand an explanation or forced him to talk. And when he said all he wanted was to make sure Draco was all right, he looked sincere. He really cared about him. Fuck… Draco sighed and slunk down in his seat. It wasn’t just that. Potter wouldn’t hurt him – not even if he could, not even if he could
Still with a tiny smile, Draco started making his way back, Harry at his heels. There was something new in the air, something only made available to him now, because he could finally allow it. He didn’t know exactly what to call it, but it felt fresh, and kind of nice. Rather shaky on his legs – for when wasn’t he, really? – Draco took small, careful steps, but he felt so impossibly light. Maybe he didn’t have all the answers yet, maybe he never will. There was plenty of time to figure things out. Nothing had to be perfect, nothing had to be dramatic or life-altering. He would take it one small bite at a time.
“I like it,” Potter shrugged happily. “It’s warm.” Damn him, damn him,
Draco gave him a suspicious nod, then caved. “You can wait in the back room if you want. It’s too damn cold outside.” Potter retired to the back, leaving Draco to wonder just what kind of an idiot he really was. Potter, Potter, that pesky little Potter, always coming when he didn’t need him, didn’t want him… But Potter who was real and who was here… how tormentingly baffling. Draco closed the shop in a very distracted state of mind and as quickly as he could. It was incredibly stressful to know there was someone in the store with him, and it being Potter only made it worse. At five o’clock he’d already finished everything and went to collect the man who was practically bent double on the sofa.
? There wasn’t really any question at all about it.
“Yes, but he didn’t even try to lie! He told you everything straightaway. Almost like he wanted to tell you.” Hermione looked at Harry like that should mean something to him.
