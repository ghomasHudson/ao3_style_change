“It’s nice to know I can make you as speechless as you make me,” Harry teased, grabbing the books with one hand and Draco’s hand with the other as they approached the cashier.
“The man let me rot in Azkaban for twelve year, I wouldn’t be too sure,” Sirius sighed, his tone bitter. “Is it possible for you to adopt him? I mean, you’re
Draco nodded, silently appreciating Hannah’s respect for having his own way of coping. “I’ll be okay,” he said, watching her eyebrows knit together as she tilted her head, as if trying to discern whether he truly would be okay.
“Do you ever think about life after this oncoming war?” Harry asked, leaning back into the sofa, staring at the ceiling.
than any Dad he could imagine,” she replied nonchalantly, before turning to smile at him. “So yes Harry. He might never call you Dad, but trust me when I say, you
“I still rather like the idea of dying my hair a pastel green,” Malfoy admitted. Harry stared at Malfoy, who glared at Harry when he noticed.
Harry paused, taking a moment to consider whether he should tell the truth, or perhaps to figure out how he really was feeling. “I’m not sure,” he said quietly. “What about you?”
,” Zabini said, his eyes narrowing, looking as venomous as Parkinson did moments ago. “And does that change anything?”
The journey across the Black Lake was amazing. Draco could have sworn he saw something move within the depths of the water and was unable to decide if it was the Giant Squid he had heard about, or the merfolk – he didn’t know which he would have preferred. The lights within the castle danced across the top of the water, rippling as the boats pushed their way through the water. In his excitement, Draco had almost tipped the boat over, making Pansy scream at him and almost making Blaise fall into the lake with laughter.
Little did he know that Harry was the one who asked Pansy and Blaise to help cheer him up, leading to the first cross-house sleepover.
his comment about Snape and everyone flooded into the room. There was an unheard groan when the classroom was somehow colder than the corridor, and despite Hermione’s warming charm, he could still feel the change in temperature. They took their usual seats at the back of the classroom and began to set up the basics.
It wasn’t as if he had slept more than usual, and the only difference to the past few weeks had been his run-ins with the Malfoys. “I –“
“Will you be staying there with me?” Draco asked. He wasn’t too keen on staying in a place he didn’t know by himself.
“We can meet on the train there if you’d like, I can look for you, tell you more about Hogwarts,” Draco offered, and Harry instantly perked up.
Draco continued to read the book in the comforting silence of the library. There was a solace he found in the sound of the pages as he turned them.
“I can’t wait to see the Slytherin dormitories,” Blaise enthused. “I wonder how many snakes there’ll be there.”
It was where he would hide away from his own emotions. He would stare out the window, sit by the flames, and remember his mother, or wonder about her safety. There were times when he would sit and compose letters he wasn’t able to send, or imagine what he would say if she was to arrive at Grimmauld Place tomorrow. Sometimes Harry would join him, other times Harry recognised the need to deal with your emotions by yourself.
Suddenly, Draco stopped, his eyebrows furrowed at he looked at a collection of books. “They’re in the wrong order,” he muttered to himself, squinting as if to be sure.
Harry was silent for a moment. “I’m glad you’re here,” he sighed, and Draco felt his face go a deeper shade of pink as Harry leaned his head on Draco's shoulder.
“You can call me Harry, if you want” he said, watching with amused eyes and the two of them wrinkled their noses.
“That you’re incredibly boring,” Teddy replied, and Harry couldn’t help but laugh, his nerves dissipating. “But that you’re also really nice and I’m glad you’re my Dad, even if we’re not related,” Teddy said with a shrug and a small smile.
The Black Manor was, also, a house of many mysteries. The first mystery was how it was concealed so perfectly from the sight of all beings, magical or not – Draco hadn’t been able to ask yet. The second, was how Draco had been unable to find the kitchen an hour ago but was now able to run there in less than ten seconds.
“Scarhead,” Draco grinned, and Harry shook his head, opening his mouth the respond when Remus cleared his throat.
Sirius sighed with a smile. “You don’t have to forgive him Cub, and you can be confused about the kiss because I know I would be, but you should talk to him.”
“Honestly ‘Mione, I don’t care because if he does have Sirius, he will kill him and I can’t lose Sirius, not yet – I can’t just – he’s my,” he stumbled over his words, pulling at his hair. “Fuck, Hermione,” Harry yelled, at no one but himself.
“If it’s not, we don’t ever have to apparate again,” Harry promised, watching as Teddy looked relieved at the promise.
Teddy sighed, resting his head on the table. “But Uncle Harry,” he began, resting his chin on the top of his hand. “Why is it dangerous?” he asked.
“Someone would get hurt,” she admitted, sounding as if she had, had to repeat that phrase many times.
Muttering a string of angry curse words, Ron began cleaning his cauldron as Hermione shot Harry a sympathetic look. Harry knew he had nothing to worry about when it came to Hermione’s potion skills, so at least he wasn’t going to be poisoned.
’ ma petite étoile,” he said, and when Scorpius still looked confused, he added, “which means deep love and respect.”
Potter blushed. “Ah yeah, well, I hear things. You know with ‘Mione being the minister and all.” He spoke rapidly, rubbing the back of his neck and Draco smirked.
Teddy shrugged. “They were angry,” he said, leaning into Harry as a stranger passed by. “But I don’t mind,” he grinned. “Emily and Charlie are nice, and they don’t lie to me just to come across as being cooler than they actually are.”
Harry grinned. “Yeah, yeah,” he said, rolling his eyes as he nudged Draco’s shoulder with his own. “I’m guessing that Scorpius told you?”
After a moment of stunned silence, Sirius placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder, forcing him to stand still. Draco watched as Harry glowered, still, at the floor, but took deep breaths in the presence of his Godfather.
“I can feel you staring,” he said, his eyes flickering in the direction of Harry, who was currently leaning against the shelf.
family life is hunky-dory. It’s fucked up by the sounds of things,” he muttered, and the snow on the ground swished, being kicked around by an invisible foot. “Besides, at least I can say with certainty that my family does care for me – in a way,” Draco said, and whilst it was not meant to be jab at his own home life, Harry felt defensive.
“I will,” Draco smiled, pulling Harry’s hand up to his lips. “Can you handle carrying teapots to tables without dropping anything?” he teased.
They talked for a while after that. Harry bit back his laughter when Sirius complained about being cooped up inside but felt relieved when he heard that Remus visited often to keep him company.
The two were sat opposite each other in the attic, which Harry assured Draco was now safe as they had cleared it of all Dark artifacts only a few days prior.
and I never expected to not want to strangle him when we’re in the same room but also,” he paused, unsure of how to phrase his next thought. “I’d never thought about kissing a guy before and now,” he trailed off, hoping Sirius would understand what he was saying.
A few days had passed since their meeting at the lake, and Draco had tried to visit Harry every day since. Pansy and Blaise insisted it was a lost cause, Madam Pomfrey was very stubborn when it came to her patients. On his fourth try, she left muttering about how it was bad enough that the entire Weasley family insisted on visiting Harry every other day, and something about a dog.
Blinking multiple times, Harry forced himself to look away from Draco, and as he got past the fact that Draco had taken Harry’s suggestion of having emerald green hair, he managed to form a reply. “I’m sure we’ve already established somewhere that I’m not the brightest,” he joked, and heard Draco chuckle.
Harry thought for a moment as Draco looked at his expression, confused. Harry took a deep breath and said, “how about dinner?” he asked, looking up at Draco’s face for a reaction.
Draco sat silently, unsure of what to say. “Still doesn’t explain why I can’t perform magic with it Potter, it’s been fine before,” he sighed.
Draco quickly shifted the weight of the books to his other arm and Harry held out a hand, offering to take the books from him for a moment – Draco was the one looking at the shelves anyway. Instead, however, Draco placed his hand in Harry’s and continued to look at the shelves.
“We need to talk,” Harry said, jump-scaring Malfoy who snapped his head in Harry’s direction, before his second of fear was replaced by a sneer.
There was a lot relating to the dark arts in this library. Draco wasn’t surprised, the Malfoy Library was no different.
“We got into an argument, it wasn’t pretty, and I left,” Sirius said, his eyes never leaving the shelves opposite them. “I’d been expecting to be kicked out and disowned for years, and then
Harry sighed. “That’s what I said,” he grinned. “They just told me it was going to get worse,” he said, smiling as Draco suppressed another laugh. “How long have they been together?” he asked, and Draco thought for a moment.
Which was when Draco turned his head and caught Harry staring. They both went slightly pink, but Draco (‘the git,’ Harry thought to himself) smirked, ignoring Harry and turning his attention back to Scorpius, who had decided that practising his magic by levitating small objects on the coffee table was more interesting than kitchen safety (Harry couldn’t blame him).
“Is there anyone you want to tell?” Harry asked. It wasn’t much of an issue for him. Besides the idea of coming out to the Prophet, he didn’t mind who knew about Draco and him.
if you want to,” he emphasised. Whilst he did want them all the meet, he understood if it was a little too much for Teddy.
“Well,” Draco said nonchalantly, his face still tinted pink. “I might be able to let it slide,” he shrugged, and Harry bit back a laugh.
“I wasn’t going to say anything!” Harry lied, curious about what the lady said that made Malfoy so flustered.
Before he could talk himself out of it, he used some of his Gryffindor bravery and turned to face Malfoy. “Can I kiss you?” he asked, his face feeling as hot as the sun.
“You’re brilliant,” he said, his eyes wide and shining. “A real wonder boy,” he joked, and Harry didn’t have the heart to reprimand him as he usually did. It was a wonderful smile.
“It’s not my fault Snape’s a vile, evil git,” Ron muttered, and this time, Harry couldn’t resist his urge to laugh, making Hermione glared at the both of them.
go away, if you’d rather be alone,” the voice continued. “But talking about things can sometimes help.”
“It’s no problem,” Sirius said, still smiling softly. “And just so you know, the offer of a hug still stands, we’re family after all,” Sirius shrugged, causing Draco to chuckle despite still being a little teary.
Mrs Weasley would be just as upset as Sirius and was probably wondering why Harry never told her anything.
He had spent the past few days frantically making sure Grimmauld Place would be welcoming to Teddy. He had been so obsessed with making sure his home was inviting, that Draco had shown up to see if he was okay. The two of them ended up spending the afternoon redecorating the living room, and then Draco insisted Harry sit down and relax.
“Well,” Draco smiled. “If you ever need someone to talk to in the night,” he offered, and Harry snapped his head towards Draco, meeting his eyes.
“Why don’t you go talk to Mrs Drooble for a minute ma petite étoile?” Malfoy encouraged, his eyes flickering from Harry to his son.
“Teddy would be more than happy to spend the holidays with you Harry,” Andromeda said, and Harry snapped his head up to look at her.
,” Draco said, glancing at Harry for longer than necessary. “I was taught manners,” he grinned, and Harry scoffed.
After watching Draco gently flick through the pages of the book, his fingers dancing across the paper, Harry stood next to him and leant over Draco’s shoulder. “Still the same book?” he said softly, a teasing tone to his voice.
Draco waved his hand dismissively and he opened the box to check nothing was broken. “I’m fine, probably just distracted,” he said, though unsure. He didn’t feel any different but his connection to his wand suddenly felt weaker and he couldn’t come up with an explanation as to why.
went to Hogwarts, that was when I noticed him becoming everything I disliked about my family. He was Slytherin; he was prejudiced; he was stuck-up; he was a complete git actually,” Sirius chuckled.
Harry dropped the mirror and tackled Draco in a hug, hoping that Draco could understand what he was trying to convey; '
Ron nodded. “My entire family has been – at least for a while,” he shrugged, as if bored him. “Sort of hope I’m not in Gryffindor, would be something different,” Ron scowled. He then shook his head, forcing himself to smile.
“My father was away on business. At first, I was terribly upset with him. He’d never missed my birthday before, you see. I sat in my room, sulking, refusing to come down for breakfast or even open the presents he’d left for me.”
Harry was immediately struck with the question of whether this referred to Ginny’s feelings about the two of them as well. Ginny seemed to realize where Harry’s mind had gone and offered him a soft smile.
“Disregarding these idiots,” Violet cut in, looking at Cordelia, “I heard you landed the secretary job you wanted, congratulations!”
“That was brilliant, Draco,” Potter said from the ground, his breath coming out in quick, heavy pants.
Draco didn’t know how to properly describe what he was feeling. He didn’t know if he had the vocabulary, if he had a past feeling he could relate it to.
“I did go by Lucky during my Quidditch days, however Professor McGonagall has rather strongly insisted I instruct you to address me as Professor Ashworth.”
“Not at all, Harry. Believe it or not, this was one of my shorter meetings,” he reached out his hand for Harry to shake.
“Not yet, but I get the schedules on Friday,” Harry replied, leaning back as the waitress arrived, so she could Levitate their drinks over to them. Harry wrapped a hand around the cold bottle of Butterbeer gratefully, the condensation a welcome relief from the scorching weather that was keeping everyone hot and sweaty.
"You know, like Harry says, the war's over and it's time to move on and all that." Weasley awkwardly grabbed fistfuls of his own robes as his hands looked anxiously for something to do.
a concept Harry wasn’t even particularly familiar with. It had excited him and captivated him and scared him half to death and Harry almost felt disoriented from the overwhelming amount of feelings that were swirling around inside of him at the very thought of it.
He waited until he heard Blaise and Theo enter their dormitory and close the door behind them before he gave the plaque on his door a proper look.
He hadn’t been up here since that night. It had been one of the worst nights of his life, comparable only to those during the following war, with Voldemort in his home and his father grinning manically as he cast the Cruciatus.
“Hollowell’s a legend with the Hit-Wizards,” Ron said, sounding somewhat glum. “There’s no way he’d move to the Auror department, he’d be branded a traitor.”
Draco walks over to him and held a hand out to Potter. Potter eyed it for a moment, looking somewhat surprised, and then took it, letting Draco help him up.
For a moment, he thought the man was talking to him, and attempted to flap his wings, but the pain stopped him. He looked around, terrified to take a look at his wings and see the extent of the damage done.
It didn’t matter how many times Potter ended up in his bed, Draco couldn’t get used to it. He couldn’t imagine how one
Waya, who was joining them for today’s session, was watching Harry carefully, in almost the same way Dumbledore used to, like he could sense something about him, though the eyes that trained him now were a dark chestnut brown instead of a twinkling blue.
“Defence. She had a terrible boggart at the beginning of the year. She fought in the Battle of Hogwarts. On your side,” Draco offered, numbly.
The nightmares sometimes felt like they were Voldemort himself, haunting Harry from beyond his grave. He knew that was silly, the voice in his head that always sounded like Hermione reminded him that Voldemort couldn’t come back as a ghost even if he wanted to, since he had split his soul so many times, but that didn’t stop those intrusive thoughts from entering his head.
he muttered, and watched the image of the figure become much larger. He could still only see the student from the back, but it didn’t matter—he’d recognize that pale blond hair anywhere.
“You mean you don’t have a sixteen-step plan complete with dialogue variations depending on what he says to me?” asked Harry, glad his anxiety had lifted at least to the point where he was able to joke with her.
“Harry,” Ginny put a hand up to stop him. “You didn’t. You didn’t do anything wrong. I just…I don’t like this. I know you’ve been avoiding me, and it’s rubbish. You don’t have to feel like I’m going to break if you tell me you don’t want to be together.”
“That’s what I was wondering,” inserted Ron. “The Ollivanders have been wandmakers for generation, but Ollivander didn’t have any kids. His Hogsmeade branch is handled by a wandkeeper, but I don’t think he actually makes any of the wands.”
“Thank you,” Malfoy said, taking it from him and causing Harry to stare at him. Even operating on practically a week of no sleep, Harry was aware enough to realize that Draco Malfoy had just
That wasn’t to say he wasn’t lonely at times. Of course he was. But he was more than familiar with the feeling; it was almost a part of who he was by this point. It was exceptionally lonely—being Draco Malfoy.
There was absolutely no reason for Violet to trust him, and there was no reason for him to attempt to comfort her, but the image of the boggart as that bleeding young girl—that looked so much like Violet—had consumed him. He couldn’t stop thinking about it, and he couldn’t stop thinking about Violet, this girl that he had shared a House with for years and yet knew absolutely nothing about.
“I know, they’re not my favourite either. Let’s get this over with then, shall we?” he said, and with a flick of two of his fingers, the door to a broom closet over on the right opened and a desk came barrelling into the classroom.
“Violet had this idea,” he said, slowly, trying to sound it out in his head first, “of creating a magical preparatory school for Muggleborn witches and wizards.”
But I didn’t hunt down and kill Voldemort because it was the right thing to do. I did it because I had no other choice.”
through his chest and into his heart; Arthur Weasley lying in pools of his own blood in the Ministry; his mother screaming; Dumbledore falling from the Astronomy Tower; the piercing, stinging pain of the Basilisk fang in his arm; the snakelike face underneath Quirrell’s turban; the flash of green and the screech of Hedwig as she hit the bottom of her cage; Hagrid’s wounded roar as he collapsed in the Forbidden Forest; the cold, empty feeling that the Dementors brought with their scent of death; the heat chasing him as he flew from the fire-breathing Hungarian Horntail; Hermione’s agonized screams as Bellatrix tortured her; Ron convulsing as he bled from his Splinched arm; the blood spreading over Dobby’s chest; Bill’s scarred face; Fred’s limp body; the utter darkness and suffocating tightness of the cupboard under the stairs, and—
“Exactly,” he murmured. “Do you ever just hold onto your wand in your robes as if you’re about to be attacked?”
“That’s not what I meant,” said Hermione, patiently. “I just mean maybe you should listen to the Sorting Hat! Not everyone can be saved.”
Draco shifted in his seat. Even after years of perfect posture being drilled into him, he couldn’t help but slide down slightly, wanting to disappear into the ground.
“I suppose we sort of did, but it wasn’t anything real. Just me wanting to live up to my father’s expectations and pretending I liked her more than I did because of her name.”
It was released on Tuesday, and by the next day, it seemed like the entire Wizarding World had heard the news. Luna’s piece had been lovely, writing about how Ollivander had been an staple in the wizarding community, a talented and wise man who remembered every wand he ever sold and cared deeply for his craft. Draco had felt something in his chest crack when he’d read the closing words of the article:
Hello all! This is the first chapter to The Strange & Marvelous Story of Our Revival! Here's some important info:
Draco scowled; did they really have to do this here? Couldn’t Potter just be decent and take her up to his dormitory? Just when Draco thought he might, the two of them simply walked back to their merry group of Gryffindors in the armchairs. Very well, then, at least they’d stop being nauseating in front of Draco. After all, they certainly didn’t want to have to see that; Potter was the last thing he wanted to think about at the moment.
Yes, admittedly, Draco had thrown the first punch, but Potter had been antagonising him for two weeks straight—following him around at all hours, dropping into conversations Draco was having completely uninvited, and constantly making jabs that were clearly intended to get a rise out of him.
“The Sacred Twenty-Eight is dying out,” Draco said. “Avery, Carrow, Lestrange, Rowle, and Travers are all in Azkaban. Ollivander has no descendants. Burke is ancient and Slughorn is…well, I don’t even want to think about that. Hardly anyone’s left.”
Suddenly remembering that this was actually dor Draco’s apprenticeship, Harry took this as his cue to say goodbye.
“Yes! Harry, it’s called Subconscious Linked Legilimency,” she said, clearly about to explain further when Ron jumped in.
After the final first year—“Zima, Danielle!”—was sorted into Ravenclaw and the Sorting Hat was taken away, Professor McGonagall rose from her seat.
Draco had been rather overwhelmed by this, and had nearly lost his composure as the Thestral had pushed its head under his hand and nestled in his lap. By now, however, it had happened enough times that Draco was used to it, and he was always pleased to see the animal.
Draco stared at his shepherd’s pie. Was that not, word for word, exactly what Weasley had said at lunch yesterday? Hadn’t Finchley also said exactly the same words he had spoken yesterday? And surely, the canteen didn’t typically serve the same food two days in a row, did they?
Harry took a moment to refamiliarize himself with his body, and then looked up, suddenly remembering where he was.
“Yes, you’re a great big sap, aren’t you?” she said, her big lips spreading into a wide grin. As always after the summer, there was a small smattering of freckles across her nose and cheeks, and they always made her look younger than she was.
with that?” Draco demanded, feeling his voice getting shriller but now unable to stop himself. “It’s utter
“I dunno,” he said, honestly. “Between Potions lessons and our sessions, I think we just sort of moved on from being horrible to each other and now we’re relatively friendly.”
“You said,” Draco swallowed, suddenly nervous again. “Before you went to get the files. You said you didn’t know I…”
“I’m glad you’re alright,” Daphne said, reaching out and squeezing her arm gently. Violet smiled sadly at her.
He doubted Pansy knew that when she had invited him there. She had always preferred lavish locales, the more luxurious and expensive the better. A hole-in-the-wall pub was certainly not what Draco remembered as being her taste, however he wondered if the privacy the White Wyvern offered was what had attracted Pansy.
“Oh! Oh, Harry!” her voice increased in volume in her strange excitement and a few others around the table to see what was going on between them.
“May I have a word?” he said, in a clipped tone, as if he were putting an inordinate amount of effort into being polite. Knowing Malfoy, he probably was.
It was a clearing, a strangely colourful clearing in comparison to the darkness of the Forest around it, the bright green of the grass and the dots of yellow and purple in wildflowers across it. The sun shone down directly upon the clearing, as it had no large imposing tree branches blocking the sky. It looked like a spotlight was shining down, on this one perfect circle.
“Hogwarts Christmases are lovely, though,” Luna gave him a warm smile and looked at him in that uncomfortable way of hers, that made him feel like she could see right through him. “The feast is always delicious, and the castle is so peaceful and quiet.”
“I’m three minutes early,” Draco said, spinning around to face Finchley. “Would you like me to arrive even earlier? I know how much you’d hate to have to pay overtime.”
“Trying to distance yourself from the Malfoy name now?” he asked, crossing his arms. “And here I thought you were so proud of it.”
Last year, he had been terrified of working on his own, certain that no one would want to purchase wands from a man like him. Ollivander had calmed him, reminding him that after the first year of serving as his apprentice in the store, the gossip and judgment had already died down.
“What did they say?” Draco asked, knowing it definitely wasn’t as benign as Ella was making it seem. She flushed and looked away, and her lip trembled.
“So be it,” he said, and walked directly back out the door he had just come through. Finchley followed him.
From across the table, Daphne snickered, and Violet looked up to beam at her. Draco, on the other hand, scowled.
“Well, what if you had both gotten offers from the Falmouth Falcons, and she was excited about it and wanted you both to join, but then you also got an offer from the Harpies, who were your favourite team and your first choice?”
Lost in his thoughts, Harry didn’t even realise he had made it to his destination until he was stood right in front of the door. He clenched and unclenched his fists a few times, trying to shake the nervous energy out. He remembered what Hermione said, about him and Draco overcoming their hatred of each other to become friends. He took a deep breath and entered the café.
Initially, Harry had been overwhelmingly welcoming of boring, convinced that he had had enough excitement to last him a lifetime. But he was distinctly lacking a sense of adventure that he found he actually craved. Perhaps it was that he was simply used to it, or perhaps it was his Gryffindor spirit, but Harry found himself craving something
He couldn’t imagine why he would be afraid of getting older. For so long, he hadn’t known if he was even going to survive his adolescence. He was bloody lucky to be alive at all, and even luckier to have a chance at a real, normal life. Why on earth would he be
“Yes! I mean, no! I mean, I dunno,” Potter’s shoulders slumped. “It’s just…weird, seeing you like this. Normally, you’d be coming up behind me and making fun of my hair or something.”
it was, but then, he had only asked Potter to speak with him in private on impulse, so he hadn’t exactly had the time to plan.
“Can we try somewhere else today?” asked Sophie. “The Leaky Cauldron’s food always makes me want to take a nap afterwards.”
“Hey, hey, Potter,” he tried to speak in a calm voice, knowing how important it was that Potter get his breathing under control. “Hey, it’s alright, it’ll be alright. Slow down, Potter. Slow breaths.”
Draco decided he was going to cast all of the blame on his bloody wand. He couldn’t imagine how anyone could possibly think the blasted thing was a
She hooted happily and flew off. Draco looked over a Theo, who had finally pulled his present loose from its wrapping. He was looking at it with great interest, but Draco couldn’t see properly over all the dishes in the way.
“Pretty much,” said Harry. “Unless you count the Prophet photographers following me around Diagon Alley.”
“Draco,” he tried, and his voice softened without him even realising it. Malfoy looked at him wildly. “What happened to your mother? Are you alright? Is there anything I can do? I want to help.”
“I’ll check if he’s brewing yet,” she said, and walked through the curtained archway that led to the back of the store. After a few moments, which Draco spent observing the potions under lock and key in the glass case by the register, she reappeared.
Apologies for the long wait, this chapter kicked my ass. As you may have noticed, I have a really hard time finishing stories, I don't know if it's that I get too attached or if I get paranoid that I'm not tying up all the loose ends or whatever.
“I beg your pardon?” Draco raised his eyebrows at him. Not that he was particularly proud of the moment, but he distinctly remembered being in the midst of casting the Cruciatus.
“Is everything alright?” he asked, racking his brain to try and remember the elf’s name. The elf just let out another cry.
“Redwood is in short supply and constant demand,” Ollivander continued, calmly. “It has an excellent reputation and is a highly sought after wand wood. It is especially rare in Britain, since redwood trees are mostly found in North America. I’m afraid you’ve been swindled.”
A moment later, she yelped and winced, and Violet wore a triumphant expression, having clearly successfully kicked her shin under the table.
Harry felt a sense of dread filling him, like he had been jolted from a great height and his stomach was now sinking like a stone.
“But, would you want to be?” Harry asked, hoping he wouldn’t come across as too nosy. Draco’s jaw visibly clenched again and he turned to look directly at Harry.
“I think that’s it,” said Dennis, pausing to flip back through the last few shots. “You just need to talk to each other, that’s the most relaxed Harry’s looked all day.”
Several murmurs filled up the room and Ron looked rather awestruck. Harry could tell the new professor’s coolness factor had just gone up.
He had just levitated his pot of tea upstairs to the sitting room, far warmer on such a cold night with the fire crackling, when he heard two short knocks at the door, so slight that he may have imagined them.
Draco watched him walk away, unsuccessfully trying to stop his eyes from drifting down. Merlin, but Potter was fit. His lean strength gave him presence, perhaps because everyone knew how powerful he was, despite his appearance not directly giving it away. He was still somewhat lanky and awkward, but Draco couldn’t help but find it charming.
“Are you certain you’re alright to be here?” she murmured in his ear, standing up on her tiptoes to reach him.
“You should listen to your boyfriend, Weasley,” Draco smirked. “He’s actually got it right for once.”
Several of the portraits were looking at him now and when Draco dared to look up at Dumbledore, he was surprised to see that the old man looked rather amused.
Malfoy’s tone was hardening, seeming to morph back into how he used to talk to Harry, and Harry suddenly realised his silence can’t have been very encouraging. He forced his jaw to open.
with deeply personal, private information about himself. Information that, prior to this year, not a living soul outside of the Malfoy family had known. And suddenly, it was out there, and he had to simply
Draco squeezed his eyes shut, trying to remember what he had read about portrait magic, raking his brain for anything like what was currently happening.
Potter smirked slightly, but it didn’t meet his eyes, and he darkened. He stayed silent for a moment, stirring the potion once again and then sitting back and staring at the low flame flickering underneath the cauldron. When he spoke again, it was in a voice so soft, Draco had to lean towards him to hear properly.
“I suppose I can tell you some of it,” he said, sounding more like himself again. Harry sat down in one of the chairs, gesturing for Draco to do the same. The two continued meeting in the third-floor corridor for sessions, however it was just as likely these days that they would just end up talking rather than practicing any sort of magic.
Harry did. The thought seemed to follow him; even when he was consciously trying to focus on something else, it was still there, obnoxiously shoving its way to the front of his mind. It didn’t even matter that it was exam season, or that he needed to sleep at night, somehow for the following 48 hours, his mind was quite fully occupied with thoughts of Draco Malfoy.
Draco took his loathed wand into his hand and inspected it, feeling the material in his hand. Ollivander was right, of course, it was much sturdier than redwood should be. It had striping down it too, which woods had that again?
“The Slytherin Beaters are useless. Pritchard’s alright, but he’s not that strong, and Baddock’s aim is shite. Hawkins and Walsh essentially carry the entire team,” he replied, referring to the Chasers other than Harper.
Ron, who was filling his plate with pancakes and hadn’t even glanced at his schedule, suddenly stopped, a pancake dangling off his fork in mid-air.
Draco heard her voice begin to crack as she spoke those words. He felt a great sense of loss once he was finally alone.
Harry thought before answering. “I don’t know. Maybe I’m not saying anything,” he said more to himself than to Draco. Harry laughed nervously before continuing. “It’s just the thought of kissing you…” He trailed off and looked up at Draco. “Is something I’ve thought about for a long time.”
Draco rolled his eyes. Sure Malcom would understand, right after he chided Draco for the stupid way he’d manage to injure himself.
Harry looked up, seeming to have just noticed Draco’s presence. His expression softened slightly as his eyes scanned Draco’s body.
Harry’s hands were firm on Draco’s length. He tugged and twisted and Draco let himself be taken over by the sensation. Draco must have missed the moment Harry pulled his trousers down so he was fully exposed, because when he looked up Harry was sliding off his lap to position himself between Draco’s thighs.
“Don’t waste your breath,” she started towards the door before turning to him one last time. “I really thought you were different, but clearly you were only interested in wasting my time.”
Harry continued up the stairs he and Draco had descended moments ago, where a grand doorway caught his eye. Intricate carvings spanned its entire surface and it was larger than any other door in the house. He pulled it open with some resistance due to its immense size and was greeted by a library.
P.S. (update?) I've lost inspiration to write this story so it's going to end here. thanks for the support <3
If it were anyone else, Draco would have immediately pushed them off of him, but knowing it was Harry, he simply held on to Harry (sneakily) so he could balance them to stand upright. But Harry was heavier than Draco expected, so they both went crashing down to the floor.
“I wish it were that fucking easy,” he let out a soft, bitter chuckle. “I think we’ve been kidding ourselves - or at least, I have. You know, I always thought, deep down, that we would end up together again. Somehow. No matter how much I told myself I hated you, I always knew that wasn’t true. But with every day that passes, the more I think how ridiculous it is of me to think this way. Why are we holding onto a high school relationship? Maybe your father’s actually done us a favor with this curse.”
“Er… I’m not sure if that’s a good idea,” he said, pulling away from her, pulling up the sleeves of his sweater. She eyed him, and he wondered if it was a look of judgement or something else.
Draco tapped him gently, and Harry opened his eyes. “Are you cold?” he asked. “We… can go somewhere else.” Despite what he was saying, he was slowly moving his hands down to Harry’s trousers, who held back a moan. “Hey, are you sure about this?”
”A decision like this really shouldn’t have a due date,” Harry pointed out. His expression was completely unreadable.
A few months passed. The last of winter had left and spring passed, yet even the beautiful summertime couldn’t help the horrible feeling in Harry’s chest. It lingered in the daytime and worsened in the dark. The guilt for Cedric. The fear for his own life. The stupidity of thinking hurting Draco would be better than putting him in danger. The price of his backwards, disgraceful ‘bravery’.
Harry grabbed his stuff and walked to his dorm. He was the Quidditch captain of the Gryffindor house, but he didn’t seem into it anymore. He was tired and just wanted to know what Draco was up to.
Pulling his silk pajamas closer to his body, he sat down to eat breakfast, which was simply just cereal. The warmth that had been radiating off his energy was slowly wearing off, and he felt almost numb.
“Yeah, you’ll be saying that until it’s one day before exams and you’re cramming everything in your brain,” Draco replied with an eye roll, lifting his arm and starting to stroke Harry’s hair gently.
“Potter’s that way, moron,” Blaise pointed towards the table Ron, Hermione, Harry and Ginny were sitting at. He cleared his throat, then sat back down at the booth. Pansy shook her head in disbelief, then followed after Draco. Blaise cursed loudly then left too.
“Look,” his voice was shaky, “I know that out there, you have to be a Malfoy and I have to be Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived. But… when we’re in that room, away from the rest of the world, it feels like I’m just Harry, and you’re just Draco. And it feels like everything will be okay again.”
“What now, Malfoy? Got another bet with your father going on that you need to tell me about?” Harry said, his green eyes sparkling as he stared at Draco. “Oh, and your hair looks awful today!”
Harry slowly took a step towards Lucius, glaring at him. There was no way to express how much Harry wanted to hex him or cast a spell on him. But he controlled himself. “Oh, sir, I really am making the right decision.”
Okay, it was normal for Harry to move on, so why did Draco feel like the walls were closing in on him?
“They’ll hate me,” Harry muttered. “They already hate me. I’m not worthy of your family, Draco. I’m not a pureblood, and I don’t know basic etiquettes… they’re going to hate me, more than they already do.”
Harry pulled Draco away from the crowd, taking him to the side. They were on a sort of rooftop, so they were looking at the fireworks from a distance from where the display actually was.
“Ron, I’m not even an adult yet. How could I possibly be going grey?” Harry asked, astonished by Ron’s logic.
“Lover-” he started, outraged, looking up to see Hermione, Harry, Ron and Ginny all going to sit at the Gryffindor table. He wrinkled his nose in disgust, looking back to Pansy beside him. “He can’t trust me.”
The two boys pulled apart at the same time, gasping for air. Neither of them had realized how close their bodies were. Draco started kissing Harry’s neck softly. Harry leaned back and let him do so. The two were craving for attention from the other.
“I swear you guys just eye-fucked,” Pansy whispered and Draco let out a snort. He was in too good of a mood to even get annoyed by her. She had been able to tell something had happened as soon as he entered the Slytherin Common Room the night before. She asked him what happened and Draco, too flustered to lie, came clean. “You two are like star-crossed lovers.”
“Harry,” he stood up so they were looking at each other eye-to-eye. “That poem… fucking hell... it's about my mother. I don’t have a girlfriend. I don’t even like a girl- I mean I don’t even have a crush.”
Harry took the books from Hermione and practically ran off to his next class. Harry had managed to calm himself, not flinching whenever he saw Draco (or in Harry’s situation, his eyes tricking him into thinking it was Draco).
Draco nodded, his eyes cold. Harry knew that look all too well, and he couldn’t help but wonder if they had just reversed what had been six months of development in their relationship as Draco left the room of requirement.
“Bullshit,” he replied, and despite the harsh word, his tone was ever so gentle, concerned. He took Draco’s hand, who held onto it tightly, unable to meet his eyes. He felt as if Harry had seen a stupid, embarrassing side of him.
Pansy and Draco stopped short when they noticed Harry, who had a guilty look on his face. She gave her best friend a knowing look before walking off. Draco raised an eyebrow at him, then sighed. Better to address it, he thought to himself.
He just about made it back up the stairs when he noticed Draco, who was shakily making his way up, quickly shouting
He snapped out of his thoughts, shaking his head. “I’m not. I was listening,” he protested, looking up at Hermione, who was staring at him accusatively, her arms folded. She narrowed her eyes.
“Draco, it’s okay. Maybe you two need to talk it out,” Pansy was saying. “I’m not sure if ending your relationship with Harry with a
“I’m sure you did,” he mumbled, taking in a deep breath, trying to calm himself down. “I’m sorry. I’ve been holding back a lot of emotions. It’s not you. It’s just… everything.”
“I love how you just know you live in such a great mansion that people get lost in it,” Harry said with an eye roll.
Draco stood nearby the entrance of the train station, looking at the large crowds that were either entering or leaving the building. He looked around before staring down at his hands that were trembling.
hello hello hello!! long time no see! thank you for loving and enjoying this fic, all of you have inspired me to write again!!
“I saw you that night,” he responded as they continued to move to the music. “You were moping and sitting in one place. You seemed quite angry, so I didn’t feel like coming and insulting you. Besides, Moody would have probably turned me into a ferret again.”
He got out of bed, quickly getting ready, putting on the first pair of jeans and a sweater that he could find, brushing his teeth and sneaking out the door.
Draco stayed still. His silver eyes were screaming for help. The hand he had pointed at Dumbledore with his wand was shaking. He was holding back tears.
“Oh, Astoria, we better get going to Ron and Hermione’s for dinner,” Pansy said, turning to Draco, a concerned look on her face. It was rare for her to show it so clearly, but seemed that as the months passed, she was too worried about him to care. “Are you sure you don’t want to join us, Draco?”
“Draco! Wait!” Harry bolted down the stairs and across the main floor. He reached the back hall just as Draco was turning the handle.
Satisfied with Draco’s compliance, Harry tapped his wand on the ignition and the bike came to life. The headlights illuminated the previously dark street and the roar of the engine echoed off the walls of the surrounding buildings.
Sorry it took me so long to update but I promise this fic isn't abandoned! I'm just a procrastinator who has yet to master the art of work-life balance. Enjoy!
“Do you want to sit down? You look like you could use a break from whatever it is you do here.” Harry smiled.
Draco dragged Harry closer to him and pulled the dark haired man’s legs onto his shoulders. He teased his hole with the tip of his aching prick which throbbed in anticipation. Pleasure erupted through Draco’s entire being the moment the head pushed passed the now pylant ring of muscle. He locked eyes with Harry who seemed to be in a similar transe of bliss. It wasn’t until Harry pushed his hips further engulfing Draco’s cock that he snapped back to reality.
Malfoy’s didn’t work. Everyone knew that. Plus, his family had been underground for some time now. The last time Draco’s father had shown his face in this horrid place was to pawn the last of his dark artifacts before the Ministry raided the manor.
“I’m not surprised. Bloodroot is one of the most heavily regulated poisons to date. Only the highest ranking ministry officials have access to it, not even the best potion smugglers can get their hands on it.”
The job was slow at first. Draco spent countless hours scanning various documents and gathering information from customers when he could without seeming suspicious. But all of this work eventually paid off when Draco spotted a sly exchange outside of Borgan & Burkes. Draco figured the best way to get more information was to pose as a buyer. He was far too recognizable to present himself in front of such a high profile criminal.
Merlin, Draco! Talking to you is like trying to talk to that pompous, selfish, arrogant prick from Hogwarts who lived to make my life a living hell!”
“Then why does it matter? It’s not like you ever wanted to be seen with me when we were together. I was just one big embarrassing secret.”
Harry looked at Draco as if he had gone mad before he noticed the sincerity in his eyes and his defences relaxed.
He followed the man to the back of the house and once out of sight Draco rushed at him pinning the culprit to the wall.
“We were starting to worry. And Teddy hasn’t been able to sit still since lunch,” Draco said, still lingering in the doorway.
While pacing the kitchen to stretch his legs, Draco glanced into the next room to see Harry and Teddy cuddled together on the couch and smiled. Harry looked up and noticed the blonde, then smiled himself.
Draco groaned. He never knew wandless magic could be so sexy. The way Harry’s magic engulfed him felt more intimate than anything he’d ever experienced. He caught a glimpse of Harry’s face which made it very clear that he knew just how much his magic was affecting Draco.
Harry had become a regular guest of Draco’s in no time. They’d spent many nights sipping their beverages long after the bartenders left for the evening, long after Malcolm escorted his female companion of the moment back to his and Draco’s shared residence, and even risked sunrise on some occasions.
Draco smiled. Andromeda had a way about her that always made Draco feel like he was worth something.
Draco braced himself against the wall with both hands on either side of Harry’s head and pressed his body against the other man as if he wanted them to merge and become one.
The tears in Draco’s eyes overflowed and formed a steady stream down his cheeks. He stumbled out of Harry’s house in a haze and aparated to his flat.
“This is the only place in London to get a drink after curfew. Here for a similar reason?” As Harry said this he pushed his coat back to reveal the stake he kept on his belt.
Draco enjoyed the familiarity that had grown between Harry and him. As much as he tried to deny it, Draco was looking forward to Harry’s visit.
They stopped in the middle of the dance floor and Harry grabbed Draco’s hips and pressed his chest against the blonde’s back. Harry guided Draco’s hips to the beat of the music while simultaneously grinding up against him. Draco dropped his head back to rest on Harry’s shoulder and shivered as the shorter man’s stubble scratched his cheek.
Both of the men lay breathless next to each other. When their breathing settled they continued to lay motionless in the silence.
Draco lost track of his surroundings and let himself be engulfed by the euphoria of the moment. Harry gently guided Draco to turn and face him and pulled him close. Their eyes met for a moment before Harry tilted his head up to kiss Draco.
“No. And not that it’s any of your business, I actually came to inquire about employment opportunities.”
Harry followed without protest. The music from below was dampened by some variation of a silencing charm as they crossed the threshold. The owner’s lounge was even more lavish than the main floor. Harry glanced around at the standing tables lined the balcony that looked out onto the general crowd, black leather couches were arranged around matching ottomens and side tables, and a bar with priceless liquors. There were about twenty or so people lounging and chatting. All were dressed in the latest fashions and many sipped cocktails with a red heue.
“Don’t act so innocent, Potter. One would think you would have grown out of that hero complex of yours but clearly time has just reinforced it. You aren’t the ‘Golden Boy’ everyone makes you out to be. You weren’t then, and you certainly aren’t now.”
Harry led Draco to a narrow street adjacent to Decadence. There, a weathered black motorcycle was parked on the curb.
Draco looked at Harry. He was silent for a while and Harry began to wonder if he should have asked before the blonde spoke. “During the death eater trials I was pardoned because I was underaged when inducted. That, and it was proved that I only did it because Voldemort had threatened to kill me if I didn’t cooperate. My father, however, wasn’t so lucky. He made a deal with Robards that he would turn in any death eaters the ministry wasn’t able to track down in exchange for amnesty. He still had ties with a good number of them. My father gave the names, but most of the remaining death eaters had offed themselves before the ministry could get a hold of them. Except for Walden Macnair that is. My father was responsible for his arrest and he swore vengeance. The idiot still held onto the idea that Voldemort’s work had to be finished, and my father stood in the way of that. When he was being shipped to Azkaban, a group of vampires attacked the prisoners. That’s when he was turned.
Draco came with a shout, his entire body shaking from the intensity of his orgasm. Harry was soon to follow, just as fiercely as Draco.
Draco looked up to see Astoria approaching him from the stairs. He walked into the kitchen to meet her, taking delight of the image of her wearing his shirt from the night before.
Suddenly, Draco toppled over as if his legs gave out. Harry was fast enough to catch him before he fell to the ground and helped him into one of the chairs in front of the fire.
“Of course,” Draco reassured and Teddy’s expression lightened a bit. “I’ll always be there for you, Teddy. Remember that.”
Draco observed Harry under the dim lights of the club. His usual uniform of vigilante justice--an all black ensemble complete with auror quality robes and sturdy dragon hyde boots--was replaced by an old leather jacket, distressed jeans, and a fitted white t-shirt. Through which Draco was able to make out the outline of Harry’s incredibly sculpted figure.
Draco followed willingly, completely lost in the moment. They descended the balcony stairs and mixed in with the general crowd. The music was deafening and the lights hypnotizing, but all he could focus on was Harry. It was as if they were the only two people in the room. The only two people in the world.
Harry walked into the kitchen leaving Draco to sit uncomfortably at the edge of the couch. The lunacy of his decision to show up on Harry’s doorstep was beginning to dawn on him. He should just get up and leave. What was he even planning to say to Harry? And even if he could find the words he doubted Harry would listen. But before Draco was able to find his feet, Harry returned carrying two glasses and a bottle of fire whiskey.
“No need to get wound up, Potter.” Malcolm responded just as nonchalant as before. “Just wasn’t expecting any company at this hour is all.” He barely acknowledged his presence as he spoke.
Draco slumped into the couch, trying to catch his breath. Harry looked up at Draco. His glasses were crooked and he had a look of complete satisfaction on his face. Draco smiled and ran a hand through Harry’s messy hair once more before pulling him back up to the couch, flipping him over, and yearning for the moment he would have Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, trembling beneath him.
“We can’t be together, Draco. We bring out the worst in each other. And if we keep whatever this is up…” Harry trailed off.
Harry threw head back in a fit of pleasure and bucked his hips forward, causing Draco to gag. The blonde sucked at Harry’s cock, taking in the taste of him and losing himself in the action. Draco released Harry and looked at him with swollen, spit covered lips and a dark desire in his eyes.
“You think I had a choice?” Draco scoffed and all sympathy he might have had for Harry was gone.. “I can’t believe I wasted my time on you! I can’t believe I though you actually cared about me and that it could turn into something that was more than just sex!”
“What are you proposing, Potter?” Draco asked. He leaned in slightly to see how Harry would respond.
“Woah,” Draco said when he received notification of the unexpectedly large amount of money that had been deposited in his vault at Gringotts. His first payment from his unofficial position at the Ministry was much larger than he expected.
For fear of saying something he might regret, Draco simply nodded at the other man and retrieved his clothes. Once he was dressed he stopped at the door and looked back only to find that Harry was no longer in the bed.
“At least they look at you in a positive light. People look at me and pulled their children across the street. People look at me and whisper foul things about my family. No matter what I do I can’t escape what I’ve done!” The guilt and shame from the life Draco had lived had always lingered in the back of his mind, but now they were consuming his entire being.
Harry wondered further into the flat. His eyes swept over the dark wood floors noticing the large oriental rug and elegant couches that framed a marble fireplace topped with a mirror with silver trimming. “And also...not.” Harry added when gaze found the modern kitchen appliances, and lofted sleeping area. Then, noticing that it was a studio, was the biggest surprise.
Harry could tell that Draco didn’t like going home to an empty bed and made a point to stall when he could. Not that Harry minded. He had grown to enjoy Draco’s company. The way they talked and laughed together reminded him of a simpler time. Draco always got Harry in a way no one else had. Not even Ron and Hermione at times. Yes, they suffered losses in the war and resisted The Reform, but Harry and Draco were touched by a darkness. One that could only be attributed to a connection with the Dark Lord.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Mr. Borgin greeted when Draco approached the counter. “To what do I owe the pleasure? I haven’t seen you father in quite some time. Are we buying or selling today?”
Draco smiled fondly and wrapped his arm around Teddy, pulling him in closer. “Yeah, Teddy Bear. I’ll be fun now.”
“Vampires? Yes.” Draco answered before Harry was able to finish. “Not to worry though. They won’t attack you, unless I want them to.”
“The mark doesn’t just go away. There will be a bounty on your head if anyone of consequence saw.” Draco said, ignoring Harry’s protest.
“Draco, you can’t just charge into the ministry.” Harry warned. “That place is a fortress. Nearly all of the employees are brainwashed. Plus, you’re a war criminal and a rogue vampire. If they catch you they’ll do much worse than just kill you.”
“You know I have no money,” Draco smirked, allowing his hands to finally make their way to hold Harry’s back.
“Suppose I do look for a job at the Ministry,” Draco asked, entertaining the idea. “What would you propose they have me do?”
Intending to take full advantage of their new location, Draco rose to his feet and threw Harry onto the bed. Their lips met again, this time accompanied by the glorious sensation of their naked bodies rutting against each other as a result of Harry wandlessly vanishing their clothes.
Just then, there was a flash of green light that illuminated the sitting room. Teddy hopped out of his chair and ran towards the source, Draco following close behind. Teddy jumped into Harry’s arms who caught the child without struggle. Something Draco had yet to master. He guessed being an auror also prepared you for the unstoppable force of a three year old.
“How was the honeymoon?” Draco asked Pansy. Her and Theo had returned from their month long honeymoon in Bali a few days earlier. She was now joining Draco for lunch at his loft.
“Mainly we’d want you to help us keep tabs on You-Know-Who’s followers. There have been whisperings of illicit activity stemming from that particular group of witches and wizards. You do still have connections with ex-Death Eater’s, yes?”
The room suddenly felt much warmer than it had been. Draco swallowed to suppress a wanton moan from escaping his lips. Harry eyed Draco over the rim of his glasses, his usually bright green eyes dark with a burning lust. It was now clear to Draco that he and Harry wanted the same thing.
“I don’t think I’m strong enough to apparate so we’ll have to walk,” Draco said without acknowledging Harry’s statement. “It’s not terribly far.”
He should have just let Harry go home. He wasn’t ready to deal with whatever it was that had happened between them. It was not something Draco wanted to talk about. It was a foolish thing for him to do and frankly he was embarrassed.
“Well, what the ministry doesn’t know is that Macnair escaped. He came directly for my family when he did,” Draco paused. He closed his eyes and took a breath before he continued. “I was unlucky enough to be home alone that evening. I was completely pissed and forgot to set the wards. It wasn’t difficult for him to break in. I don’t remember much,” Draco lied. “I woke up in a tomb somewhere not long after. And, well, you know the rest.”
She was the one to suggest Quidditch to Harry in the first place, not that he hadn’t thought of it before.
Draco felt on top of the world, as Potter kissed him slowly and deeply. He would think it were a dream, if it weren’t all so vividly real: Potter’s stubble rubbed against his chin, his hands warm and slightly sweaty curling around Draco’s neck. Draco relished every minute of it, and had to force himself not to vocally protest when Potter finally pulled away.
“The creek is just outside of the Manor’s grounds, it runs through the forest a few miles away. Father never let me play there because he said I would get all muddy, which was ‘unbecoming’ for a proper young man. But I’d
“I expected this from others,” He finally said. “I’m expected to be evil. I’m a Malfoy, and I’m a Death Eater. I expected this from others. But not from you. Not from fucking
They walked towards the railing, and Pansy looked up at the stars, smiling sympathetically when she heard him sniffle. “He can’t trust you?” she asked, rubbing his back soothingly as he kept his eyes on the sky.
kills him?” Draco asked in a broken voice. “I’ve been to the meetings. He’s so powerful. He’s… he’s made all these plans, Pansy, am I just getting into the wrong thing here? What if he dies? I’ll be all alone-”
“Do you often wonder about that brown strip in your hair?” Snape asked. Draco slowly turned to his mirror, his hand going to the brown streak in his hair.
It wasn’t that simple, not for Draco. He couldn’t just open the door, especially with Harry so close. Draco made sure that he was as far as possible from the door, not wanting to take any chances. ‘Too close’ for Lucius Malfoy probably meant being within the same room.
“Well, that turned depressing quick,” Draco replied, finding himself smiling as the boy in front of him laughed, reaching forward and gently caressing his bandaged hand.
Draco stared at his door for a few seconds. It seemed like he had no choice - Lucius had taken this to far. Draco took large steps back, before charging against his door, hitting his body against it with full force.
Draco let out a squeal, unprepared as the two fell off the bed, rolling on the ground. But Harry didn’t let go. He tightly hugged Draco until he was forced to hug Harry back.
Draco, who was standing beside Pansy, nearly fell over when he heard the words being said. Pansy looked around, in search of Hermione, who was too astonished herself to be thinking of anything.
“The last time I checked, you weren’t even supposed to know about my Dark Mark.” Draco pointed out. “Besides, there’s nothing else to do. It just keeps on burning.”
Without thinking, Draco reached across the table, using his hand to gently lift up Harry’s chin, grinning as if he felt like the smartest person on Earth. “Can’t it be a little bit of both, Potter?”
“Oh, yeah, I understand,” Narcissa said with a nod. She awkwardly turned to leave. Just as she was at the door, she quickly turned to Draco. “Hey, Draco, please remember to use some sort of protection. I know it’s impossible for you to-”
“Because, I know now you were trying to protect me in your own, stupid way,” Draco ran his hand up and down Harry’s arm. “And it’s kind of true what they say. Love is blind. I’m blind for you, Harry.”
“It’s not you I’m jealous of,” Draco blurted, his face turning red as he stood up. “It’s not her I want to kiss,” he said, turning away from Harry.
The two sat in silence for a while. There were two benches side by side, and the two sat on each end of the benches.
“I’m sorry, Draco, I really am,” Harry was chewing on the inside of his cheek, “I was friends with Cedric, and what happened to him… I don’t think I can ever forgive myself for not realizing sooner. Besides, it would hurt more with you because I love…” he quickly stopped talking.
there’s an order you absolute Heathen!” Harry was glad he didn’t have a free hand to swat him over the head with.
The boy looked at him for a minute, examining him. Harry shifted, wondering if he’d said something he wasn’t supposed to say to a child. “I’m Scorpius,” the boy smiled, sticking out his hand.
He squeezed his eyes tight. “Personally, I was relieved,” she replied, and Draco peeked out of one of his eyes to see her smiling at him. “I left of my own fruition, and to receive that letter let me know the family wouldn’t ‘
“Your Grandma would skin me alive if I said no to that Ted,” Harry joked, charming Teddy’s trunk to be lighter and easier to carry across the platform.
“I really hope this one is it,” Harry said, passing over another wand to Draco. “This one is Pine wood and Phoenix feather.”
Draco gently cupped Harry’s face in his hands, forcing Harry to look at his eyes. “You’ve never elaborated on your home life, and I have never asked because if you want to tell me, you will,” Draco’s eyes were alight, and Harry knew he meant every word he was saying. “But that doesn’t mean I can’t see how badly it affects you. I’ve noticed how you eat, how you interact with certain people, how you think you
compared to the Muggle celebration, Halloween.” Draco shifted and was now sat on the sofa cross-legged, tilted slightly to look at Harry as he spoke. “Anyway, despite it still being rather morbid, I now understand the need for it.”
He walked to the other side of the kitchen, where Draco was, and leaned against the counter once more, watching Draco charm the bowls and cutlery to wash themselves in the soapy water.
“Honestly Pansy, you can be nicer,” Zabini muttered, shaking his head as she huffed, still glaring at Harry who shifted on his feet. “Lovely to meet you properly Potter,” he said, flashing Harry as grin. Harry blinked, baffled at the difference in response and nodded at Zabini, shaking his outstretched hand. “Draco told us everything, so you don’t have to worry.”
“Apparate!” he exclaimed, jumping up in the air. “Grandma never lets me side-along,” Teddy complained.
“Some days more than others I’ll admit,” he sighed. “The times I miss her the most are when I see her in Scorpius. The way he finds the good in everyone, how he thinks animals are better company than people, the way he smiles.”
He had arrived early, mainly because if he spent another second staring at his notes, he would have bashed his head against a wall.
“I’m no expert, but I know it’s a Celtic/Pagan festival that relates to Halloween,” Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck with a smile.
“What did you tell them?” Harry asked, hoping his nerves weren’t showing in his voice, despite being able to see his hand shaking as he put food in the cupboards.
Malfoy laughed, his laughter only adding to the warm welcoming feeling of the shop. Harry didn’t even try and stop himself from grinning in response. “I couldn’t agree more.”
“Of course, you sod, you’ll go spare without me,” Draco smirked, kissing Harry’s cheek. “You’ll trip over everything in a five-foot radius,” he joked, and Harry tried to act offended but part of him knew it was true.
“What does spontaneous mean?” Scoripus asked in a whisper to Draco, not wanting to interrupt the conversation.
Once the two boys reached the safety of the trees on the path to the village, Harry stepped out from beneath the cloak. He missed the comfort of the blond’s hand in his own and as they walked down the path, he suddenly understood how strange it must have been for Ron and Hermione to talk to him whilst he was under the cloak.
over here gets frustrated,” Remus said, nodding in Sirius’ direction. Sirius whined slightly, somehow managing to look offended in his dog form. “Did you come alone?” Remus asked, noticing a lack of Ron or Hermione.
Breathing in shakily, Draco flexed his fingers, wincing as his knuckles cracked. Myrtle’s bathroom was rather peaceful when she wasn’t here. Draco hadn’t planned on entering the room, but he was hit with a sudden wave of realisation he couldn’t ignore.
“Hey Cub, is everything all right?” Sirius asked breathlessly, and Harry could just about see Sirius squinting to read Harry’s expression.
With a nod, Teddy linked his arm with Harry’s. “Let’s go!” he exclaimed, raising his arm, and pointing forwards. Harry chuckled, placing his free hand on Teddy’s arm to make sure he would be stable when they arrived.
In reality, they were hiding, sort of. Draco knew Harry didn’t wish to speak to Ron and Hermione, and he wondered how much that extended to the entire Weasley family.
Lupin sighed, a painful expression flickering on his face, like a candle flickers in the wind. “You know how he is; he
“Good,” she smiled. “But it also does more than bring light in the dark; it powers their technology, such as television,” Andromeda explained. “Muggles may not have magic but that doesn’t mean they are imbeciles Draco, you must understand,” she insisted.
Even so, he spent the lesson trying to drown out Snapes snide commentary about his skills in Potions. “Mr Potter, you need to
“My body does not represent me in this case,” Draco shrugged, folding his arms and looking away from Harry. He hoped Harry couldn’t see his faint blush.
Raising his free hand in surrender, Harry tried his hardest not to laugh. “So, what’s the order?” he asked.
The tree branches were swaying slowly as the early sunlight of dawn illuminated the leaves, scattering the light across the street. There was the faintest sound of bird song, and a dog barking. It was all strangely comforting.
Scorpius shook his head. “No thank you Daddy, I have Ladon and my crayons,” he assured, in the way that made an eight-year-old seem to be an old soul.
“Are you sure you’re all right mate?” Ron asked for the third time as they were sat in a corner of the common room playing exploding snap. “I know you say you are, and you say you don’t want to talk about it –“
When Teddy had first left for Hogwarts, Harry had been left feeling lost, alone and unsure of what he should be doing. A few weeks after Teddy’s departure, Ron noticed that Harry was drifting, slowly, into a zombie-like state and his lack of, well, anything, scared everyone for a moment.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Do you even know how to punch?” he asked, appearing genuine, and Draco rolled his eyes.
old,” he said thoughtfully, though Harry was unsure how he felt about being called old. “Thanks Harry,” Scorpius said, jumping from his seat to give Harry a hug.
However, by the time he had brewed his potion, Harry could not only taste blood from biting the inside of his cheek, but he most definitely had a bruised foot from the amount of times Ron had to remind Harry to not give Snape the satisfaction of a reply.
Ron let out a bark of laughter. “Nothing my arse, she’s now Head of the department of Magical Creatures,” Ron said proudly.
allowed to leave,” Malfoy said, staring at Harry, trying to discern why Harry was in the teashop he worked at.
“Of course not!” Harry said, snapping his head up to meet Zabini in the eye as Parkinson watched him, as if she was examining him. “It’s not his fault his dad’s a prick,” he sighed.
This very idea forced Pansy to sit up. “That’s it,” she declared, slamming her hands on the grass. “Blaise, you’d better watch out, or
Lupin returned, muttering about blasting that portrait through the nine circles of hell. “Honestly Sirius, at least greet your cousin before you attack her,” Andromeda chastised, hitting Sirius around the back of the head.
“There are chasers,” Ron cut in. “They, well, they chase the quaffle, score points by throwing it through one of the three hoops. Then there’s the keeper who makes sure they don’t score points.”
Draco smiled softly at Harry, before pressing his lips to Harry’s, “Thank you Harry, for letting me join you,” he said. “But,” he looked at Harry, who had opened his mouth to reply. “Don’t use my problems to avoid your own, talk to your Godparents about what they
As he stood, however, Draco felt a hand catch his wrist, keeping him where he was. He turned to see Harry scrambling to his feet. “I’ll go with you,” he said, his eyes pleading with Draco to not ask any questions – not yet at least. Draco sighed.
The ritual for Samhain left Harry feeling more at peace than he imagined it would. After lighting his candle, it was as though all his anguish and the pain of loss had lessened slightly. It was always there, and after so much loss in his life, Harry doubted it would ever truly go away, but he hadn’t felt so light for years.
“T’es fou,” Draco muttered, laughing along as he joined Harry on the bench. “You’re not wrong though,” he added. Harry wondered if Draco had insulted him.
,” she complained, dragging him into a compartment. She was a similar height to him, and for as long as he had known her, she had short, pin-straight hair with a fringe that was always perfectly level – somehow.
“I also – I wanted to have more time to be able to spend with Teddy and, I was wondering – well, it was more like I had an idea and –“ he muttered, tripping over his words, unable to say what was on his mind.
“I’m not sure how it works, my parents won’t tell me, but I think it’s about what you value, not what you are. So, you can be brave and smart but not be in either of those houses,” Draco explained, and the boy nodded.
“Kreacher!” Harry exclaimed, catching the attention of those in the room with him. “Kreacher, I need to know, is Sirius there?” he asked, holding his breath.
“Yes, yes, we’re very old, as you keep reminding me Beth,” she grinned. “Be thankful of your memory whilst you have it,” Hilda said to Harry, waving a finger at him.
“He’s a little stuck-up still, but that’s probably the pureblood upbringing,” Harry grinned at Sirius who ruffled his hair.
“You do have a sweet tooth Potter,” Malfoy retorted. Nonetheless, he grabbed a plate from beneath the counter and placed it on top.
Furrowing his eyebrows, Harry felt the pit in his stomach grow. “It’s okay, I quite like being an Auror,” he shrugged. The sentence felt strange to say.
“Thank you for entertaining Scorpius, Potter,” Malfoy said quietly, watching as Scorpius was engaged in conversation with an old woman’s German Shepherd. “You didn’t have to say yes.”
,” Draco said, gently shoving Harry with his shoulder. “Surely your Godfather told you this?” he asked, unsure of himself, but Harry saw him relax when he chuckled.
“I already told you both my name,” Ron shrugged, smiling slightly. “But it is nice to meet you I guess,” he said, specifically to Draco. “My dad told me about your family, he knows your dad, but you’re all right,” Ron said, nodding.
As he reached the kitchen, he saw that there were only a few people there to greet Harry and Mr Weasley: Sirius, Lupin and Mrs Weasley. Draco wondered where Hermione and Ron were, but then he remembered what Harry had said in his letters and wondered if Harry had told them to stay away. “Harry,” Draco grinned, as he pushed the door.
Narcissa sighed. “I apologise dear,” she said, placing her teacup on the table to brush her hands on her robes. “But you know your Father will never allow it,” she explained, beckoning Draco to her side. “You understand right?”
His explanation was by no means coherent, or chronological. There were many instances in which he backtracked what he was saying or made additions to memories he’d spoken about previously. He tried not to look at Sirius or Remus because he knew if he looked, he would stop talking, and he didn’t want to.
Saving him from the continuation of this awkward conversation, Rose and Hugo burst in through the door, carrying a Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes version of Jenga, that explodes as it falls and has other additions such as random wobbling and screeching.
because I want them to be happy?” he said, but it sounded more like a question. “I want to lessen the stress of the situation for them, comfort them.”
Teddy rolled his eyes. “She would not,” he said, and Harry was about to raise an eyebrow when Teddy continued to speak. “Far too messy to skin you alive.”
, as he has threatened to do,” she sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose. “You have twenty minutes.”
“No, no, don’t try to weasel your way out of this Potter, you’ve piqued my interest,” Draco insisted, internally remarking on how soft Harry’s hair was. “So, tell me – what’s my biggest flaw?” he asked, biting back a grin as Harry smiled at him.
,” Harry said, rolling his eyes. “Perhaps my lack of observational skills are why I hate being an Auror,” he joked, leaning back into the sofa.
“Why give you a warning about him,” Sirius finished, bringing his hand up to his mouth as he began to think.
Harry nodded in agreement. “I agree with your Dad,” he looked around slightly, checking no one was nearby before leaning forwards slightly. “Magic tends to give it a horrible aftertaste,” he added in a whisper, biting back a laugh as the boy’s eyes went comically wide.
Harry nodded, shivering at the lack of heat. He wished he could skip Potions and curl up in front of the fire in the Gryffindor common room. As much as he hated Snape, and the cold, Hermione would have his head if he even voiced that he was genuinely considering skipping a class during the year of their OWL’s. “Can’t wait to not only be cold, but have to deal with Snape for two hours,” Harry grumbled, already in a foul mood due to Umbridge’s lesson previously.
“Maybe after a bit of Befuddlement Draught, but not on a daily basis,” Harry pointed out with a smile.
“Regretfully, yes I am.” Draco refused to look at the amusement on Potter’s face. “For professional reasons of course, I desperately need a wand if I’m to pass,” he clarified.
Harry nodded. “Seems like it would have been easier, although, I’d have taken that less serious than Dobby.”
Scorpius looked contemplative for a moment. “Then Harry can stay with us,” he proposed, as if he was announcing the meaning of life.
Draco sighed, deciding to give up on understanding why Potter was acting as he was. “No, a wizard is only supposed to own one wand for the duration of their life.” He looked back at Potter, who now seemed to be performing some spells over his wand. “And for what it’s worth, I’m sorry.”
With an exasperated glance at Draco, Harry conceded, handing Draco the card. “Enjoy your hollow victory,” he sneered, but when Draco did a mini victory dance, a smile tugged at his lips.
“Besides you being able to use it, no, none,” he said, turning his head to glance out the window. “You’re not going to listen to anything else I say, are you?”
He took their drinks to a booth in the corner, where Pansy had made herself comfortable. The bluish white light of the hovering moon above her head made Pansy’s skin seem to glow in an otherworldly fashion.
He parked himself next to Violet at the Slytherin table and immediately reached for the fried potatoes. Violet gave him a look, her thick eyebrows flying upwards.
Perhaps it was a bit selfish, but was that so wrong? Was it so wrong to want to feel wanted by someone, especially when it was abundantly clear every day that his very presence and existence was so thoroughly
“Oh, it’s excellent. I didn’t expect it to be so engaging, nor did I expect to have as much choice in my instruction.”
And he had to try to find some way to live with that. Like he always did, he compartmentalized—put it in a box somewhere in his brain with a promise to deal with it later so that he could focus on other things. But things like that refused to stay hidden for long, and the memories would often come back to Draco with a jolt in the most random of times, as if trying to force themselves back into the front of his mind.
“Wouldn’t mind what?” asked Draco, pausing and looking over at him. Harry’s cheeks burned. Draco seemed to have no qualms about facing Harry shirtless. He supposed being a model had made him somewhat immune to it, but Harry had to very determinedly keep his eyes on Draco’s face.
“Potter!” Harry heard someone exclaim as he walked into them, turning the corner. Everyone except the Trio stiffened, poising for a fight.
“Really!” Teddy exclaimed, leaning forwards over the table. “Grandma won’t let me anywhere near there.”
Draco and Ron looked at each other, debating who was going to tell him the answer. “Sometimes,” Ron replied, and upon seeing the worry appear on Harry’s face, Draco decided to elaborate.
– Death Eater. No one was exactly eager to let me join,” Draco spoke as if this were a reasonable response but by Harry’s expression, he could tell he thought otherwise but was wondering whether to say anything.
“I’ll get it,” Lupin reassured, kissing Sirius on the cheek. Lupin rubbed the bridge of his nose as he climbed the stairs and a few moments later the yelling stopped.
“Potter,” Parkinson greeted coldly. Zabini rolled his eyes and rubbed the bridge of his nose as Harry rubbed the back of his neck, a tentative smile tugging at his mouth.
Harry left the two to their squabbling as his mind drifted again, this time to Sirius. Over the Christmas break, Sirius had spoken to Harry about the Ministry’s involvement at Hogwarts. He was concerned about the lack of secrecy their letters held, and how dangerous it would be if someone were to intercept these letters. Harry had no doubt that the Ministry would gladly invade student’s privacy by reading their letters, but he wondered if Sirius was spending too much time around Moody, screaming about ‘
“Next week,” Harry said, smiling. “So, I’m staying at the Burrow for a week, and then, I’ll move to the Black Manor, I think. Sirius hates the place, but I’m not sure if they have anywhere else at the moment.”
It was a circular room, with sofas and lounge chairs huddled around the three fireplaces, placed as far as they could be from the entrance. There was a balcony surrounding the room, with multiple window seats and giant oak doors where you could find your dormitory. Each window was large and circular just allowing you to see the ground and the stars. In the centre of the common room, on the ceiling, was a sunroof which illuminated the growing plant life with moonlight as it curled around the wooden and stone support beams.
There wasn’t much which could be said about Draco Malfoy; he was a rather average wizarding child after all. He knew all about Quidditch and he knew a few basic spells; his mother, Narcissa, adored him, heart and soul, and his father, Lucius, explained to him how the world worked.
If Malfoy didn’t think Harry had lost his sanity before, he did now. “Potter, have you lost your mind? What are you even –“
There was little Draco could clearly remember from his third year at Hogwarts, but there was something peaceful on that day by the lake. Blaise and Draco had just finished their end of year exams, Pansy had finished a few days prior, and they celebrated by raiding the kitchens and taking a picnic down to the lake. There was a spot, just by the wooden pier, that was filled with flowers in spring, and well hidden from sight in summer, when the leaves were their brightest shade of green.
“I don’t know Auntie,” Draco admitted. He liked staying with Andromeda. “You’ll visit sometimes, right?” he asked, unwilling to admit that he would miss her too much if she didn’t.
“My family was not happy with the hat’s decision,” he said with a shrug, smiling sheepishly at Harry. He scratched at the back of his hand, pretending to be really interested in it.
“I’m not sure how spontaneous it would be if you’re here talking about it,” Draco added, not even glancing at her as he stacked away plates with the flick of his wrist. Pansy was about to flip him off until she remembered Scorpius and settled on a glare.
, you still are a nuisance, but I think we’re in quite neutral territory at the moment,” he chuckled.
“So, I should ask him on a date? Is what you’re saying?” Harry asked, placing his finished teacup on the table.
This only made Draco laugh harder. “Who knew you were so easily flustered Potter,” he teased, and Harry now saw this, as a challenge.
Harry sighed. “I’m not going to tell you everything Draco’s told me, but,” he paused, thinking. “There’s a lot that he’s
Harry grinned, and that was that. It was much easier than Harry had anticipated. It was possible Ron and Hermione were completely right and he was really overthinking it. “It can be, but sometimes it’s worth it,” he said, and Teddy raised an eyebrow at him. Harry chuckled. “Not everyone likes it. You know Uncle Charlie?”
going to figure out a way for you to not take the Dark Mark, no matter what.” Harry felt his face heat up as Draco grinned.
Harry’s eyes widened as he tripped over his words for a response, running his hand through his hair. “Hex you? Why would I –?” he looked at Malfoy who shrugged before he continued. “You ambushed me in a classroom I had half destroyed,
Suddenly overcome with hunger, Harry offered Draco a side-along apparation to a park that he swore sold the best cinnamon buns – the perfect snack before dinner. Draco laughed, and commented on how Harry’s solution to hunger seems to always be some form of pastry or cake. He wasn’t wrong.
“Oh, you poor thing, these exams can be rather intense,” she replied, her gaze full of pity. “You can leave if you’ve finished, I recommend a rather long nap, and perhaps a trip to the hospital wing for a calming draught” she smiled, and Harry did not hesitate in leaving, grabbing his bag on the way.
“That’s amazing!” Harry exclaimed, as George left to go find Angelina. “How’s the progress on Werewolf Rights going?” he asked, knowing being the Head of the department would certainly help.
He sighed, focusing his attention on Ron, who looked as if he wanted nothing more than to set himself on fire.
As the door was unlocked, Harry burst into the tower and stood by the door so Malfoy couldn’t run from him.
Now he had begun to speak, he didn’t want to hear their responses, their disappointment and anger and pity.
“It must have been the potion,” Hermione deducted, and Harry nodded in agreement whilst Ron still looked sceptical. “It lets you do what you normally would talk yourself out of.”
His vision blurred as he tried to read one of the letters, and he clutched them to his chest, as if that would replicate a hug. It felt as if his heart had turned to stone and was ripping through his insides as it fell to the floor. His stomach twisted and he tried to take a deep breath.
Harry didn’t know what possessed him to do it, but he placed his head on Draco’s shoulder, closing what little distance they still had between them. He closed his eyes and smiled, feeling the calmest he had for a while. He inhaled deeply, and could faintly smell lemons and cinnamon.
He had tried, but Delphinus would disappear for a few hours, and return with the letter still tied to her ankle every time. He only tried three times before deciding it was only tiring Delphinus out.
“I don’t think I can,” Harry replied, grinning as Draco rolled his eyes. “How do you celebrate Samhain?”
,” he chuckled nervously, and Harry raised an eyebrow at Malfoy. “Fine, Potter, yes. Merlin, you are the most annoy –“
“If it’s from Parkinson it doesn’t count,” Harry said without any emotion, laughing internally as Draco struggled to say anyone else has called him pleasant.
“I don't think I can let them know about it yet. they'll blame themselves for never noticing," Harry sighed. "And, well, I thought that you could talk to Sirius and Remus about your situation because they’re in – because they might know what to do,” Harry smiled sheepishly.
“I have a Muggle deck of cards in my room, do you know any games?” Harry asked, already guiding the way.
?” he asked with a knowing smile. “Did you buy anything off the trolly lady?” Draco asked. “Mother helped the house elves make me a few things, but I saw the pumpkin pasties on my way back,” he said, ducking his head with a sheepish smile as Blaise shot him an exasperated look.
Sirius furrowed his eyebrows. “I’m surprised your mother never explained magical sensitivity to you, it runs in the Black family,” he said, as Draco smiled.
Harry burst into laughter, unable to help himself, and Draco went pink, his nose scrunching up as Harry brought a hand up to his face, dousing his
“Then why don’t you take him in again, I’m sure you miss having him at Grimmauld place,” she suggested, sipping her tea.
As Harry was sat at his desk, he found his mind drifting to Malfoy and his teashop. He thought about what tea Malfoy would get him to try next.
act as a dog should,” Draco admitted, rubbing the back of his neck as his aunt looked at him in complete disbelief. “And Harry mentioned sending a lot of letters to Professor Lupin, but that he wasn’t the intended recipient.”
Harry laughed, unable to help himself. “I’m glad there’s an expert to help me understand the complexities of tea then,” he joked, and Malfoy tilted his chin up.
The only way Draco could replicate this feeling in the Black Manor was to light a fire and huddle on the sofa by the mantle.
going to miss the most, if they expelled me, was the Hogwarts treacle tart,” Harry admitted, smiling at the memory of it.
Hermione rolled her eyes, her face heating up. “Well, if either of you paid attention in charms, you’d realise we learnt that warming spell last Tuesday,” she scolded.
As soon as he was at the front of the classroom, Harry downed the potion, which tasted like burnt toast, and was pleasantly surprised when nothing happened. Then he wondered what it was that everyone else had felt after taking the potion.
Before he could express any form of condolences, Draco continued. “It was an arranged marriage, one of the last things my father ‘
? Everyone knows Harry and him hate each other – or, used to. If I wanted someone to get close to Harry and get information, Malfoy would not be the first to come to mind.”
“You – you’re a wizard?” he whispered back, his eyes shining. It appeared they didn’t get many magic customers. That thought pulled at Harry’s heart slightly.
“Daddy taught me what to do,” Scorpius said proudly. “He’s the best,” he said, and Harry noticed Draco’s expression soften as he pulled his son into a side hug, lightly kissing his temple.
Draco nodded. “I think it might be the magic,” he said, and Sirius looked at Draco in surprise, as if he hadn’t expected Draco to pick up on such a thing. “It feels like a soft blanket,” he shrugged.
When Snape appeared to judge his potion, Harry shouldn’t have been surprised when Snape’s nose upturned, and he cleared the cauldron without any further inspection. “It seems that even celebrities can’t tell the difference between scurvy grass and sneezewort,” he sneered, a smirk appearing on his face, making Harry’s stomach drop. “Perhaps you mistook them on purpose Mr Potter? To avoid testing the potion. After all, it’s a
After a moment of silence, where Harry was certain his heartbeat was audible to both of the Malfoy’s, he decided to break the silence. “So, when are we going to bake this cake?”
“Your Dad is just looking out for you,” Harry said, going to take another sip of his tea, only to realise he had finished another cup. “Dragons are really dangerous; my friend is always covered in burns,” he explained, pouring another cup of tea.
Harry shook his head. “It’s better if he stays with you Andie,” Harry said. He wanted to take Teddy in, but he also knew he was in no position to raise a child, and it would be unfair to Teddy. “But I really will visit more, I promise.”
to do everything yourself, if someone can get you out of there, let them.” He had spoken softly, but his words hit Harry like a ton of bricks and despite the words clawing at his throat, he couldn’t speak.
As soon as she left, a hum ran through the students as they discussed how they were to be sorted. Draco glanced at his friends to see Pansy was still advocating for her owl theory whilst Blaise was growing frustrated. Before he could intervene however, there was a scream, drawing their attention.
“I’ll have a Malfoy as a brother-in-law!” he exclaimed, and Hermione snorted as Harry blushed the deepest shade of red, he had ever gone in his life. “A
“Draco and I are playing Rummy,” Harry said, once he’d stopped laughing. “I’m sure you could join, if you wanted to,” Harry offered, glancing at Draco to see if he was okay with that.
Draco’s face went bright pink, and he took a rather long sip from his teacup. “I’d say it’s rather common knowledge,” he said, avoiding Harry’s amused gaze.
“There are some things you don’t need to try to know how abysmal they would be,” Malfoy said, looking at Harry as if he was mad.
Harry hadn’t seen or heard about Malfoy in years, and he supposed this was why. He had submerged himself in Muggle culture; entirely, by the looks of his hair. As much as Harry tried not to watch Malfoy, it was difficult. It was as if staring at Malfoy would give him the answers to the question in his mind – it didn’t; in fact, it only furthered his curiosity.
Once their laughter died down, they let the silence envelop them, the Prophets article forgotten as Harry’s mind was incapable of thinking about anything other than their close proximity. Harry felt Draco’s fingers gently brush against his skin, and he wondered if Draco knew they were still holding hands – though it seemed unlikely that he didn’t. They’d built a strange relationship over the past few weeks but it appeared that both boys were scared of what they had ending.
“Or maybe you were born to be a professional tea taster, and that’s why,” Draco suggested, grinning as Harry laughed.
, cruel in some respects,” she said, her words calculated, as if there were stronger words she would use around someone who wasn’t a fifteen-year-old. “He never told me his reason for leaving the family, or even if it was his choice.”
“I mean, his mother’s a Black, Sirius told me, so I’m not surprised he knows Kreacher exists.” Harry looked at Ron and Hermione, who looked at him expectantly. “But I don’t think it matters if he does,” Harry replied, seeing Ron raise his eyebrows in disbelief. Harry then told the two about the rest of the conversation, leaving out anything related to the kiss. “He seemed, reluctant, maybe scared, either way he was doing something he
“Told him no, he started kicking up a fuss, so I told him to go fuck himself,” Ron explained, and Harry choked on his own laughter. “What a wanker though. George told me to make sure I banned him from the store.”
“What do you want me to say Ron?” Harry snapped, glad for the loud buzz of activity in the common room. “That every summer I’m
His mother would take him to the greenhouse, and they’d lie down on the benches by the fountain with blankets and pillows and she would point to each star, each pattern and tell him the stories behind them.
“Really? Because I was told the only reason we’re here is because my Aunt confronted you on the matter,” Draco grinned, walking past Harry into the store, as Harry scrunched his nose.
,” he paused, smiling at Harry who rolled his eyes. “You’ve said I’m not allowed to kill them - which is completely ridiculous.”
He opened his mouth to ask what the tea was, but Draco, once again, replied before he could ask. “Apple, rosemary and cinnamon.”
Harry felt as if Teddy wanted to say something, and he didn’t want to rush him or interrupt his thought process. “Can I –“ he began, his voice quiet as he looked anywhere other than directly at Harry. “Is it okay if I call you Dad?” Teddy asked, shuffling his feet.
