It was a good thing he did keep them open, though, because otherwise he would have missed Harry glaring at Smith in a way that would actually have given Draco a run for his money. Harry didn’t say anything to Smith, though. And for a moment they were just standing there.
When Harry woke up the next morning it was light already. And the bed wasn’t empty, the heavy weight of Malfoy’s arm having ended up on his waist somehow.
“Here.” The bartender now set their drinks down: plain lager for Harry and for Malfoy a whiskey without any of the rocks that Harry normally associated with the drink. When Harry tried to pay, hoping he had enough Muggle money on him to be able to, the bartended shook her head and smiled. “No, we’re not allowed to charge him anything,” she said, indicating Malfoy with her head, “Claude won’t have it.”
Fortunately Malfoy came his way.
Next he eyed the queue that was forming at the bar. “I think I should get back. But Potter …” Harry waited, but for a moment Zabini was silent, until he said: “Be careful. Draco-”
That, the storming off, should actually have been almost comforting in its familiarity. Except, it hadn’t been. It had felt like a loss, somehow, like Harry had taken the wrong turn somewhere, but he hadn’t wanted to take it and he hadn’t known where he’d got lost, either.
And his hand was cupping Harry’s cheek.
Well, he
“Ah, yes, that. After everything that happened,” Malfoy said quietly, waving his hand in an elegant gesture, probably meaning the war, the battle, the trails, all of those things. “I actually prefer to be around Muggles nowadays.” He was watching his glass intently. “Nicer, less of a hassle.” His voice had dropped to an almost inaudible whisper now, his words seemingly like an afterthought, like something he might not really have wanted to say out loud.
“You’re going to be alright. You were hit with a Stunner-Drainer combination and although the energy drain will probably stop at some point, anyway, I’ll most likely be able to put a stop to it now.” Draco was glad his voice still sounded completely level, none of the worry or relief he’d experienced seeping through.
Either way Malfoy had probably not meant to be annoying when he had left Harry just now.
Of course he was.
Harry’s answer was simple, too. And short.
Draco looked back at Harry, a question in his eyes. Harry just nodded. “You take it,” he whispered. He wasn’t going to put Draco in the most obvious position to get hit by the small army of guards that were most likely headed their way. Draco would probably be safer in the air.
Maybe they could
And he was just wearing his pants, nothing else.
Malfoy regarded the box in silence for a moment, his brow furrowing and something that looked remarkably like pain somehow flickering in his eyes. However, just as Harry had started to think that he’d made a mistake, taking the box to Malfoy, Malfoy started to speak.
“Whether that’s an advantage in your case remains to be seen,” Blaise remarked, uncharacteristically serious for a moment. That changed quickly, though. “Any idea how long I’ve been waiting for you to get here?” he asked teasingly.
When Malfoy started to move again, his back to Harry, Harry’s arms were securely on his hips. And Harry let himself feel it: the pounding, incessant beat of the music, the rhythm that Malfoy moved to as if he was made for it and Harry started to move with him, his hands high enough now that he could feel the shift of Malfoy’s obliques under his skin.
It was completely absurd, of course, and Draco blamed it on not having seen anyone else all weekend. Blaise had sent him an owl, but somehow Draco hadn’t felt up to contacting him, not feeling inclined to share his current situation with Blaise yet. Instead he had been caught between wanting to be left alone and a deep-seated desire to be with Harry. The latter of which he had quite valiantly resisted.
Draco shook his head, cutting him short. “It’s fine,” he said, shoving a mug of tea Potter’s way.
“Well, you’ll find in this case it does mean,” Draco answered pointedly, asking, in an attempt to steer the conversation to the real issue at hand: “So I understand there is a European Auror exchange?”
“So, ready to go?” Harry asked next. Draco just nodded and then he stepped out, out of his flat, out of his comfort zone, out of everything he’d abided by for so long.
Well, he debated, he could go and have a look. It wouldn’t be strange for him, being Head of Auror Training, to look in on his teachers’ classes, now would it? Especially if he was going to talk to all of his teachers, it wouldn’t hurt to have seen them in action. So why not start with Malfoy?
“I wasn’t sure what you you’d like to have for breakfast, so I had Kreacher make a variety of things. Just choose whatever you want.”
. Potter was kissing him willingly and it was all-encompassing, the club around them falling away as their lips met in a kiss that turned from desperate to deep and hungry withing seconds.
Draco took his hesitation to mean something else, though.
But no, he had wanted to become an Auror, so that’s what he’d become, like everybody had expected him to. He couldn’t say he didn’t like it, though. Most of the time it was okay, chasing criminals of all kinds, working out how particular crimes had been committed and eventually the satisfaction when things were rounded up.
didn’t even always trust himself, not when it came to the important things anyway.
“So, I suppose you
, building. Malfoy went straight for the stairs, expertly evading a group of teens sitting there. He was obviously expecting Harry to follow, but Harry lingered behind, looking at the lift. They had to go all the way up to the twelfth floor after all.
For some reason that stung even more, knowing how he didn’t even matter to Potter at all anymore.
about those evenings, shooting through his mind - but Blaise didn’t do any of that. Instead the three of them just talked, thankfully not touching on anything that really mattered.
“Yeah, well, Kreacher has already started making dinner, but I don’t think he’d mind if you join me. He usually makes too much anyway,” Harry said turning to go back inside. He sounded inexplicably happy.
less.
“I don’t think he wanted to talk about it, though,” Luna added. “He mostly tried to hide them.”
Then, after the screaming, Draco curled in on himself completely, and he started shaking. Again not much imagination needed, even without the sounds coming through the Silencing Charm.
“I’m fine,” Draco said, before he’d thought it through, because this would make it even more difficult to refuse breakfast. “Thank you for the potion.”
The Animagus had turned out to be an innocent girl, perhaps no more than 15 years of age.
But here they were, in the middle of the dance floor in this Muggle gay bar and Draco decided to give it his best.
When Seamus came up to them to collect his bride for the first dance of the evening, Astoria turned back to Draco, smiling warmly at him once more: “Try to have a nice time.” It sounded stronger than advice, almost like a plea.
“Yeah. You still have them too?” Harry realised, not even really asking.
doing here?” someone now spat. It was Smith, apparently still the same little shithead, even if he was wearing Auror robes.
Ron had been discharged from St Mungo’s yesterday morning so they didn’t meet each other there anymore, but Harry had asked him to go shopping for things for his flat anyway, which had resulted in them buying paint: a beautiful soft grey for his living room and a relaxing dark blue for his bedroom. And furthermore they’d been looking at furniture again, and at kitchens, wizarding ones.
For the next ten minutes they ate in silence and it wasn’t even really uncomfortable.
That definitely had been a mistake.
Except he wasn’t. Not really. Not anymore. Harry sighed. He wanted to be angry at Draco, wanted to lash out - it would make it all so much easier - but he couldn’t. Whatever had happened on Friday, he was well aware it had had nothing to with Draco being the poncy twat he’d been in school: Draco wasn’t the spoilt boy who thought the whole world should be at his feet any longer. And Harry knew it.
“Same.” A beat of silence in which they were just standing there, staring at each other. “Zabini said there’s a Portkey back to London for you.” Draco then said. His words sounded matter-of-factly enough, but his brows were slightly furrowed and Harry realised he looked sort of uncertain.
“Malfoy, are you alright?” Potter had that gaze again, the one where he looked at Draco so intently it almost hurt.
“You’ve got a Crushing Cabinet in here,” Harry blurted, his curiosity apparently winning out on what he was actually here for.
And Draco knew he should say ‘no’, like he should have many times before, but he also knew it was quite impossible. “I suppose I could.”
Harry just watched him for a moment. “So, you went to mainland Europe to escape scrutiny?” It was as much of a statement as it was a question. Malfoy nodded without looking at Harry, briskly walking to their Apparition point.
So Harry confidently ordered for them both and sat himself down on the sofa.
And Harry probably saw, because he smiled, warmly. “Home it is then.”
From where Harry was sitting he couldn’t see Zabini very well, but he had a nice enough view of Malfoy. Malfoy hadn’t changed much: still slim and very, unmistakably blond in a way that Harry had never really seen on anyone else. His demeanour hadn’t altered, either: arrogant and regal and, and, well, just fucking Malfoy.
This time it seemed like Draco couldn’t even have this quiet moment to himself, though, because that was when he suddenly felt the tug on the wards on his flat. Draco quickly ran his hands over his face, discarding the tears as much as possible.
Well, Draco didn’t have a clue as to why that would be, of course.
Harry knew that this room had to be important, before he’d even been inside, so he peeked in with extreme caution, opening the door by only a fraction. He obviously hadn’t been careful enough, though, because as soon as the door had opened he heard a poof and was hit with something that looked like pinkish powder. He couldn’t help but breath it in and at first he thought it was actually meant to choke him.
“Always so formal.” The woman smiled at Malfoy, obviously having forgiven him already. “Would you like some tea, you and your strapping friend? There’s zulbia.”
“Goodall made a split second decision, hoping that an obliviated Malfoy would be a suspicious Malfoy, what with his history and all. He thought the Aurors would go after Malfoy, at least for a while, leading them off Goodall’s trail.  And, well, thanks to Boot that almost succeeded.” Ron paused for a beat, than added: “Boot is a right piece of shit, mate. I think it’s quite a feat that you’ve put up with him as long as you have.”
Draco’s ‘okay’ was out before he’d had time to think about it.
Even then there was something terribly wrong, though, his skin so light it almost hurt Harry’s eyes. Harry made it there even faster, realising, with a shock of surprise, it wasn’t Zabini whom he was watching at all.
“What, no, I don’t-.”
So when Friday morning introduced itself, light streaming in through the crack in between Draco’s blackout curtains, Harry was still there, in Draco’s bed, close, Draco’s arm loosely around his waist. And for a moment Draco just savoured the experience, starting to believe that perhaps, just perhaps, this could-.
“Why not?” Harry countered, Gryffindor courage in place, emboldened by the hint of hesitancy he just saw.
Next to Harry Ron gasped. “Are you absolutely sure? Because if you’re going to make accusations, just to clear your name, I swear I will-.” He was stopped by Hermione’s hand on his arm.
“Nothing, I just-.“ Draco couldn’t finish his sentence, though, the pain burning through him with a vengeance. “Harry-.“ His voice sounded so faint that Draco barely recognised it as his own anymore.
He didn’t really know what he was feeling.
“No,” Zabini said, an amused smile on his lips, “I doubt Portkeys will work where you’re going. No, they’re more like alarms: you will need to cast the appropriate spell and touch your bracelet while casting it. The bracelet will send an alert my way and provide me with your location. It acts more or less like a Patronus. Well, less conspicuously so, of course, because, well, without the actual Patronus.”
Malfoy frowned, like he thought that was a rather preposterous idea, but there was an almost apologetic quality to his gaze too. “No, we don’t,” he answered, the sudden coldness to his words contradicting the way he’d looked just a moment ago.
Draco wanted more of that. “You mean you read all the ones on Quidditch and you lent a few others to Hermione.” He said with a half-smile, half-smirk.
And Harry just had to believe him, glancing down at the small note that read:
Harry could feel Draco shrug. “It happens.”
Harry opened the parchment that came with it and discovered the cube was some sort of imprisonment ward the Unspeakables had been working on. When activated by the accompanying enchantment, it would be set to Malfoy’s signature, not letting him pass outside of its boundaries, while allowing everybody else to go wherever they pleased. Only when Harry would perform a long series of counter-spells would Malfoy be able to move anywhere else.
“Hey Harry,” Hannah Abbott greeted him cheerily. “And Draco,” she noticed next, but, being one of the students he’d shared the eighth year common room with at Hogwarts, she didn’t seem to be too bothered by his presence. “I think your usual table might still be available,” she continued, looking at Harry again, “I’ll have a look.”
“Malfoy?” Potter sounded deeply surprised and Draco was quite sure his own face mirrored that sentiment exactly.
It was slightly hesitant at first, as if they were trying where they could take this. Then Malfoy spoke to Astoria again - just short sentences and nods – and then they really started to dance.
Draco had thought it would be awkward, working alongside someone who would probably not be too happy about having to babysit a Junior on this really simple case - well that, plus the trust issues his past usually elicited - but it hadn’t been.
“Some friend you are.” Draco’s voice sounded sulky and he knew it.
This is the first chapter of four, that will be posted within the next week.
“Fuck no, although it could be interesting to see what their reaction would be.” Malfoy smiled again, not quite the smile from before, but real enough. Harry couldn’t help but smile back at him: neither of them needed a lot of imagination to be able to predict the reaction of Harry’s friends.
When Harry woke up to sunlight seeping through the curtains, the night seemed far off, but he knew it had happened: the nightmare, the screaming, Malfoy’s unexpectedly comforting presence. Harry turned to find the other end of the bed now conspicuously empty, though, Malfoy apparently having retreated to his own makeshift mattress some time during the night. He was still sleeping.
“Are you kidding? You just came from hospital. I should make
“So, these are your basic wards, the ones you would find on a house, for example,” Malfoy said. He was standing next to a small training cube that was suspended in the air,  wards interwoven all around it, made visible by a spell that Malfoy had undoubtedly just cast.
Draco only realised he’d fallen asleep when he woke up, because he’d heard something. It was still dark, but there definitely was someone, or something, in his living room.
Malfoy watched him, grey eyes still full of emotion. He shook his head almost imperceptibly: “No, I-. It really is very valuable. You should keep it.”
, only to find that it actually is a sodding
“No, I-,” Malfoy hesitated just a fraction, then continued: “I really don’t have the time. It’s better if I stay here for lunch, that way I can get back to work quickly.” He smiled, but it didn’t quite reach his eyes. “There’s usually enough work to do.”
“So I’m partially Veela?” Draco now asked, his voice still slightly incredulous and much more wobbly than he’d have wanted it to be.
Right.
Not until now, that was.
Harry just watched him while he got everyone’s orders. Draco was smiling easily. At
They’d landed in a drab part of London: faceless blocks of flats lining roads that were just as depressing. And Malfoy, after having cast another quick
Hermione smiled at him now, for some reason just knowing exactly when he’d be decent. “Glad to help. So,” she went on, a question in her tone, ”what did you think of that club last night? Was it better?”
Harry had obviously got the reference to what Draco had said earlier, because he slanted him a quick, almost worried glance, then obviously decided Draco wasn’t being awful and smiled.
Harry woke up in the middle of the night again, this time to the sound of heavy, choked breathing. But it wasn’t his. His eyes had snapped open, only to find darkness, so, not able to produce the softly glowing orb that Draco usually conjured up, he cast a simple
at Smith and his friends.
. If he didn’t piss anyone off in the meantime, that was.
Harry had been with Malfoy for three weeks now and it hadn’t been half as awful as he had expected it to be. Okay, granted, most events that required Malfoy’s presence were rather daunting and just as uneventful as Harry had thought they’d be.
Because Draco realised that it would still take a long time before Potter would be able to trust him, if that would ever happen at all. Potter’s distrust wouldn’t have changed because he’d seen Draco speak French for a day, because they’d been able to be civil.
So they talked, Harry and Charlie, easily, like they were old friends. Which they probably were.
“What kind of understanding?” It was a stupid question and really it shouldn’t matter, but for some reason it did. It mattered a lot and Harry needed to know.
come here for that, it probably wouldn’t be hard at all, given the way he looked right now, his fitted shirt open at the collar and his tight trousers not leaving anything much to the imagination. He looked undeniably good.
“Well, technically it
“I’m going up to bed.” And out he went, Harry could hear him take the stairs at an alarming pace.
Then Harry heard someone clear his throat behind him and he turned around.
At work Potter denied their weekly encounters at the club just as much as Draco did and Draco was quite sure Potter wouldn’t want him to be there in the morning, when he woke up, before Potter would go and have lunch with the Weasleys. It would be awkward beyond words.
Blaise just sighed, then said: “Well, at least give Potter a chance. I think he of all people deserves as much.”
Malfoy gave him an odd look, surprise mixed with something else. Then he smiled a little. “Well, I don’t know how much of a recommendation that actually is, but,” Malfoy paused a beat. “Thank you.” It rolled off his tongue unfamiliarly, but Harry was surprised by how much he liked it anyway.
Malfoy was very much alive. Not lying near dead and soaked in a cocktail of dangerous potions in an apothecary, where in Harry’s dream he’d been working.
“Well, since you’re bearing-, not gifts as much, but erm- baguettes, I presumed that you’d-.” Malfoy - sounding as arrogant as ever, even though his sentence didn’t even run smoothly - didn’t finish what he was saying, but Harry understood well enough.
Then, they let go. “See you tonight,” Harry said brightly.
“And you’re going to live at Grimmauld Place, the old Black house.” Draco continued, when Harry didn’t seem inclined to fill the silence, knowing it was what Harry intended to do. Harry had told him how his godfather Sirius Black had bequeathed the house to him. “It didn’t seem like a particularly cheery place last time I was there, but that might also have had quite a lot to do with my Great-Aunt Walburga. I don’t remember her being particularly cheery either,” Draco added, aiming for a light tone.
Draco just nodded, which his head and stomach didn’t at all approve of, and Neville and Luna got to the dancefloor, Luna doing her weird, intricate dance and Neville happily joining in. They looked good together, fitting.
Next Harry had told him that he hadn’t even
“So, why are you here?” Harry asked.
Harry nodded: that was how it worked. “And when he got out?” Harry found he was strangely curious.
actually help with the nightmares, he knew, but more than that: he wanted
“But especially well with Harry, of course.” Nott taunted, “Your dear Harry. How was it: finally kissing him after all this time of wanting to?” Nott’s tone was plain villainous now.
“Malfoy, you’re drunk.”
Well, it could have been much worse.
Malfoy’s stance as he worked was elegant, his back slightly arched while he was regarding the cube, methodically dismantling its wards with graceful, practiced wand movements. Malfoy made it look so simple: effortlessly making the winding lines of the wards obey his wand as if that was the easiest thing in the world. Which Harry knew from experience it wasn’t.
anything?”
Zabini didn’t need to tell Harry which ‘he’ he was referring to.
And, why not? Harry wasn’t due to come in for at least three quarters of an hour, so he had time.
Harry just watched Corentin.
Harry watched him. “You what?” he probed.
Fortunately work this morning had been as it always was: busy.
“I’m tired.” And with that Draco rose, elegantly fluid as always. He walked to the bed and sat down on it, proceeding to unbutton his shirt, his back stubbornly to Harry.
“Ah, Harry, there you  are.” Ron wasn’t even
Draco had to remind himself firmly that they were friends now, at least more or less, so that would explain why Harry was being nice. And besides Harry was
And it would undoubtedly be the best place to conveniently forget all about Malfoy again.
She was right of course.
It was strangely satisfying that now they had, having fallen asleep intertwined like this, tired and sated after yet another mind-blowing experience, and Harry still vividly remembered how Draco’s fingers had touched his cheek softly, almost reverently, before they’d both fallen asleep.
Next he went back to Zabini. Quickly.
He had learnt how to make breakfast quite some time ago now, had known ever since he’d started living on his own, but he’d never had as much practice as he’d had over the past year. His year with Harry.
Of course it was.
“And Hermione gave you her telephone number?” Harry still didn’t really understand.
For now he chose to just enjoy his unexpected evening off: lounging on the sofa, going through different channels on the enormous television in their suite and eventually settling on some sort of murder mystery that was already half on its way when he started watching.
Fortunately they would both be Glamoured up and wearing robes over their clothes when they were working. That would definitely be a lot less distracting.
The witch and wizard dodged Harry’s spells and the woman stopped for a short moment, just regarding Harry and Draco. When she picked up casting it was at the exact same moment that Harry did too.
“Healer Malfoy, you’re required in room two,” usually that was where the talking stopped, but the witch apparently wasn’t ready yet. “It’s Mr Potter.”
“Okay, let’s give it a try.”
Harry would leave and that would be the end of it.
So here he was, not sure it was a good idea for a whole variety of reasons, but completely unable to turn away from it all the same.
“Yeah, it’s just, you know, hot and stuff.”
Then Potter dropped his hand to his lap and looked down at it, breaking their gaze in the process.
He got up, head swimming unpleasantly. Draco hardly noticed he’d sent his chair flying to the floor behind him. It was so hot in here, the burn in his back excruciating. He needed some fresh air.
Then he kneeled on the bed, just one knee on the mattress, and bent down to kiss his boyfriend, softly, on the cheek, stubble against his lips. Harry turned to meet his lips almost instantly.
And he must have got it right, because Francois watched him with something like awe for the slightest of moments. Then it was gone.
And Draco didn’t pull back. Instead he put his hand in Harry’s neck, pulling him in, and it really just felt right, like they’d been heading for this for days. Harry gladly let him.
Harry just looked him up and down again, like he couldn’t actually believe Draco was still there. Well, that made two of them.
As Harry’s gaze followed Zabini and Ginny to the dancefloor, he saw that said blond twat had also paired up, with Astoria Greengrass to be exact. She was here with her fiancé Seamus Finnigan, who Harry knew preferably didn’t do any dancing either and who apparently didn’t have any trouble with Draco Malfoy stealing away his partner for the time being.
Deserted Muggle areas obviously had to be added to Draco’s long mental list of places to preferably avoid or at least be very careful in.
Then he seemed to shake himself out of it, however, saying: “You should let Draco sleep now. He needs to rest properly.”
“Protection,” Zabini whispered under his breath, “Normally labs like this one are layered in protective spells to keep anyone who enters from inhaling fumes, as it could be dangerous, especially when you are brewing experimental potions.”
So he decided to throw in the towel: to take a shower and go to bed, even though it was still early.
Right. Back to safer ground it was, then.
Then Nott just started laughing, amused and mocking. “Oh, Draco, really? You think Potter really wants to kiss you? What do you think that powder he breathed in just now was for?”
better if Draco just had exclusively professional relationships. That way no one was disappointed.
Oh, wait. Did he mean-? Draco noticed his brain was apparently decidedly slow, only now catching on.
At Harry too, which was why he could only see how Nott pointed his wand threateningly at Draco again, out of the corner of his eye, not able to do anything about it just now.
“I have to admit, I’m with Hermione here,” Ron piped up, levitating a tray of drinks that he apparently just got from the bar to their table. “I know Malfoy was a right dick in school, but everybody on the Auror force knows that if you want the job done quickly and carefully, he’s the one to ask. I know
And suddenly the box opened, at first just emitting a deep, impenetrable darkness. It startled Harry, but it only lasted for a moment, because almost immediately stars began to appear, flying from the box, beautifully bright, effortlessly taking up their consecutive places in the velvety dark.
And then, when Harry didn’t answer: “It seems rather complicated, cooking.”
Draco wasn’t surprised that the news that he wasn’t allowed to carry a wand hadn’t reached Potter, however. Naturally it hadn’t. Why would Potter even care?
Draco just watched Harry for a short while, obviously not quite sure what to answer. Eventually he just said: “Okay,” his voice sounding slightly hesitant. He
They seemed to have the sort of thing Draco couldn’t see himself having, not now, not ever. And he had to admit it hurt. Just a little. If he let it.
Draco only realised how hungry he was, when he finally took his first comforting bite of curry and rice.
“Good. Now I could definitely do with some tea.” Zabini drawled instead, eyeing the pot Harry had ordered Draco for breakfast. Harry himself only started functioning after a cup of coffee in the morning.
Draco let go completely, letting the wave crash over him as it had threatened to do a few times this week already. He just couldn’t keep fencing it off all the time.
It was a Time-Turner, slightly larger than the ones Draco had seen before and probably more powerful, able to take a person further back in time.
“You do?” Draco had gone for steady and a bit bored, but instead his voice sounded rather small and brittle.
He thought he heard Harry swallow. “Yeah.”
Penelope watched him with a small, but approving smile. “Yes, they are. So, what do we do about them?”
“I was having a nightmare,” Harry felt obliged to say, his voice painful from screaming.
Malfoy shook his head, a small smirk on his lips. “No, not really,” then adding: “One of the threats has been given rather a lot of publicity, though. It made quite a few  newspapers. You know, just so it would make sense for me to hire a bodyguard, who also happens to be my former schoolmate.”
“Yes,” he managed, continuing, because he apparently felt a need to prolong this complete agony, “I haven’t lived here long, just a few days now, and I haven’t had the time to-. Well, it’s not done yet.”  Draco’d heard his own voice go quiet and he didn’t like it, not with Harry sodding Potter standing on his doorstep, looking like, like
And Harry’s hands were on Malfoy’s waist again, Malfoy’s eyes a beautiful, silvery grey.
Harry now knew that life had taught Draco the hard way and Draco had actually learnt. Making him more attractive than he’d ever been before. Inside and out.
Malfoy stopped him with a decided gesture of his hand. “It’s fine, Potter.” He hardly looked at Harry at all. “I have somewhere I need to be.”
Draco hadn’t wanted to talk about this mess he’d made, not even to Blaise, who had known better than to press.
Malfoy seemed to be alone - which felt like much more of a relief than it probably should have - locking eyes with Harry as soon as he got back to the dance floor. Harry took that as the invitation he hoped it was.
Draco answered with a little smile of his own: content and utterly adorable.
Again no wards, so Malfoy.
Malfoy stopped moving his fork to his mouth, glaring at Harry. “No, they aren’t. How is that important?” There was a glint of wariness in his eyes all of a sudden and Harry realised, much to his own surprise, that he didn’t like it.
“It was a really bad idea for me to leave the suite so soon,” Harry said softly against Draco’s lips after a long moment. They were still holding each other close.
Zabini didn’t say anything for a beat, almost as if he was surprised by Harry’s concern. It made Harry realise that Covert Ops agents usually worked on their own. They wouldn’t be used to someone in the field having their backs. Not like Aurors were, who  always worked in pairs, relying on each other.
Draco saw Harry go down, unconscious, then the fire the curse also caused. Draco kept up his shield almost without thinking, kneeling at Harry’s side again, not able to undo the spell damage easily this time.
“That was hard.” Harry saw how Zabini was deliberating with himself, probably trying to decide how much he could tell. “He was lucky to find someone who gave him a job bartending eventually.”
And then Harry had told him he was Teddy’s godfather.
Blaise grinned and Draco smiled back, now moving to claim his usual chair, the one opposite to where Blaise was sitting, the chair next to Harry. Harry had actually been looking at Draco ever since he'd come in and Draco loved that look: fondness and hunger all rolled into one.
“I think I know what the spell is doing to Draco.” Draco. Why did this Healer call him Draco? What had earned him the right to call Draco by his first name? “The spell obviously makes him dream and if my readings are correct they aren’t pleasant dreams. I presume we’re dealing with some sort of nightmare spell that was designed for torture. Whoever attacked you must have wanted to extract information.”
“Yeah, I know. I’m not completely stupid. I just-, well, before I saw you in that club, I would never have thought you’d be gay.”
here.
So Harry felt as miserable on Tuesday as he’d felt on Monday, taking over Draco’s class on Tuesday afternoon, because even though he knew
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sorry Professor Potter, I got detained in Professor Malfoy’s class.”
At first Harry had thought that if Ron had been able learn he would be, too. So, that’s when he and Draco had started practicing together. Extensively. Draco had been a good and patient, well, mostly anyway, teacher and Harry had thought he would be able to pull this off. Until the actual ball came closer, that was, and therefore also the moment they would actually have to do it. The dancing. It had made him more uncertain every time he’d practiced.
Because, now, at chess, Harry really liked to see Draco win.
And for the first time since this had started Draco knew, he just
“That actually sounds like a really good idea,” Dean said, apparently having gotten in just after Ginny, together with Seamus and Neville.
Draco started to read, but he didn’t really get very far, waking up to the flare of the Floo in the room coming to life. Honestly, he should stop doing that: falling asleep whenever Potter left him.
Second nature perhaps.
It was as surprising as it was disconcerting.
Because he hadn’t told them about Malfoy being there. Of course he hadn’t: he and Malfoy barely even recognised what they were doing towards each other, so Harry certainly wasn’t going to add others into the mix. Furthermore this thing was rather private anyway, Harry’d decided.
Draco shook his head. No, he hadn’t. He hadn’t even had lunch yet, either, actually, unless you counted a few rather stale pre-packaged cookies that he had been able to pick up walking from one examine room to another.
Thankfully the witch that served them lunch either didn’t know what side Draco had been on in the war or didn’t care. She served Draco with the same disinterest she used for everyone else, not even trying to wring out a smile and obviously wanting to be anywhere else but here.
“Well, don’t let me keep you.” Draco got to his feet in one smooth movement, wincing a little at the pain it apparently still induced.
“Yeah, it was-. When they undressed you, your back had-. I thought you’d been cursed at first, but they told me this was something else altogether.” Harry fell silent for a beat. “Well, at least it’s not dangerous.”
And Harry didn’t know why he did it – perhaps it was the quiet of the night or the realisation that he wasn’t entirely alone in this or just that he wasn’t fully awake yet - but before he knew he’d done it, he had taken Malfoy’s hand, interlacing their fingers.
And for Harry not to be repulsed by it.
where I’ve been.” His voice was cold. “You know exactly-.” He also sounded extremely tired, his voice cracking a little at the end and Harry only now noticed he was very pale, swaying a bit.
addressing Harry, her voice stuck between sympathetic and truly worried. “But I suppose you’ve both grown up enough to be completely professional about this,” she added, perhaps slightly too brightly.
But invading their small group now felt like too much of an intrusion. So Draco decided to turn around and leave. Which, of course, was the moment Harry saw him.
And about how Draco had ignored him ever since.
Then he visibly squared his shoulders.
Because however well they got along now, that would definitely be a deal-breaker: Draco was quite sure Harry wasn’t at all interested in anything beyond friendship.
actually processed it, that didn’t really make it any easier . He knew what this had to mean, but he didn’t want to even think about it. It couldn’t mean that. It just couldn’t.
Harry smiled at her teasingly. “I’m only civil to annoying exes when they get the next round of drinks.”
The way out was not as smooth as it could have been. Harry found he was slightly less stable than he’d thought he’s be and, well, not bumping into people didn’t really seem to be an option. In his defence: it
Now Draco had fallen asleep again the Healer addressed Harry: “I’m afraid I won’t be able to cast when you’re on the bed.” He said it almost apologetically.
“You’re really good at it. You know, bartending,” Harry said while he and Malfoy were walking back to their Apparition point.
It was definitely a question of sorts and Draco considered it. He still had a few hours of work to do, at the very least, so it might not be such a bad idea to get some caffeine in. On the other hand: this was Potter, they weren’t friends, this was stupid.
Malfoy was still asleep when Harry had taken his shower and gotten dressed.
She nodded and smiled back, then proceeded: “Well, as you probably already know, you’re scheduled to teach Defence classes on Monday afternoons, Tuesday afternoons and double classes for our third years on Thursday mornings.” Harry had known that, of course. His main condition for taking on this job had actually been that he would be allowed to teach their Defence classes himself and although that was unconventional no one had put up too much of a fight about it.
“I hope they let him rot in Azkaban for the rest of his life,” Harry had intended to say it under his breath, but it came out loud and fierce.
Draco just went to get them tea.
So Draco set to work, meticulously taking down the last few wards the same way he’d dismantled all the others.
“So that was your first attempt at cooking?” Harry asked after they’d finished eating.
Again it took time –  the sky had gone completely dark by now, the only lights coming from the orbs that were apparently floating at set intervals all over the Cartel’s grounds - but then there was a tunnel that took them through the wards.
Harry unwrapped the present slowly, carefully, and Draco had to swallow a few times, quite unsuccessfully trying to get rid of the nervousness that threatened to take over all of a sudden.
Harry closed his eyes, savouring the taste of whiskey that still lingered, muzzily noticing that he did actually like whiskey this way, sweet and slightly bitter on the soft of Malfoy’s lips. And that he really liked the way Malfoy kissed now, pulling him in close with an urgency that Harry had never felt with anyone else.
“It’s nice, just sitting here.” Harry knew he was breaking the silence, the quiet around them, but it seemed like something he should say, nonetheless.
Veela - there’s no doubt – but just partially. It must be in both your parents’ bloodlines, which means it often resurfaces generations later. Well, given the right genetic conditions, of course. There actually are more pure-blood families with Veela heritage than people think: they normally try to cover it up.”
He sagged to the ground frustrated and powerless and even though he had just tried to blow them to pieces twice, Harry still didn’t quite know what to make of him. He looked so young, so vulnerable.
told me he would probably be coming sometime soon.”
Because Harry had stayed.
When Draco woke up what must have been a few hours later, he was still on the sofa, under his bathrobe and a blanket that hadn’t even been in the living room earlier. Harry was standing by the window, watching London in all its glory below. He was just wearing his trousers, but even that made something stir inside of Draco. And it wasn’t pleasant.
It had meant he hadn’t encountered Harry at all over the past year and, honestly, it had been harder than he’d imagined. For some reason Draco had missed Harry more than he was ready to admit, so when the opportunity had presented itself the choice had been easy.
After his shift had ended Draco had gone to Harry’s room again, for the umpteenth time, just to see how Harry was. He had been asleep, as was to be expected after a hit like that. He looked peaceful. And stunningly attractive, of course.
After the divorce, when Harry had told Hermione what he wanted to spend his spare time on, she had told him to start on this particular room, being curious as to what rare books it might hold, but to Harry it hadn’t really seemed all that enticing, so he’d started on the uppermost bedrooms instead.
Harry decided he wouldn’t let that scare him off, though, not this time. “I talked to Luna,” he simply replied.
“Why does she discuss that with you, though? Shouldn’t she be talking to him about it?” Draco drawled almost viciously. He couldn’t help himself, the image of Ginny, almost sitting in Harry’s lap and Harry holding her tight, still too fresh in his mind.
take you out, Draco. No, even better: I
He was standing just outside the door, lounging against a wall almost leisurely. “Everything okay?” Draco’s voice seemed the slightest bit tense, however, and he was watching Harry intently again.
The question, open and genuine, left Draco a bit off-kilter. Somehow he hadn’t expected it, having thought Harry would certainly not want to be with him again this evening, even though yesterday had been marvellous. “No. No, I don’t.” Draco’d been able to swallow his ‘of course I don’t’ only just in time.
“Perhaps they mean you have to
The answer was there, all of a sudden and it was true enough, Harry realized. He didn’t feel jealous of Ginny being with someone else, he felt jealous of her being with
“Are you going to have lunch again with, erm-, your mother? Today?” Harry asked, feeling he should say something now he’d opened his eyes. It would be awkward to just keep silently staring and although Harry didn’t remember who exactly Draco had said he’d have lunch with last Sunday, he thought it would be a nicely neutral subject.
Zabini watched Harry again, pondering now, not smiling. Then he apparently decided to continue: “It was quite commendable, really, because Draco didn’t even know how to handle Muggle money at the time. He had to learn fast, though: Narcissa wasn’t well and she needed-.” Here Zabini abruptly stopped talking as if he was afraid he might overstep the line of what he was allowed to tell.
Malfoy also took another sip of his drink as if to show how it was done, with complete composure of course, and then smiled almost languidly. It seemed he had decided there was nothing to fear and consequently he wasn’t going to try and pretend he wasn’t rather pissed. “I like it.” He just said, his words slightly slurring.
It was a very unsettling thought.
Harry had had an extensive visit to the Cartel’s secret gardens where there were so many illegal, and rather vicious, plants he was glad he and Draco had got out without being burnt, stung or otherwise incapacitated. Then he had left the Cartel’s grounds, leaving Draco to get to their suite later.
Malfoy smiled at him smugly. “Of course I am.”
She just nodded. “Of course, sir.” Then she started walking to the lifts and Harry followed, dutifully taking his own luggage.
Harry was exceedingly glad that Draco had made him learn all their different uses by heart as part of the homework Harry’d had to do for his Glamour. And that he had actually put in the work. It definitely paid off now.
his wand flying out of his hand, before his spell could actually take effect.
“You will do absolutely no such thing. I’ll take the rug: you’ve always been appalling at transfiguration and your cushioning charms are bound to be even worse.”  Malfoy’s words caught Harry by surprise. Until he registered that next to apparently not wanting to rob Harry of his bed, Malfoy had also managed to insult him.
When Harry had woken up this morning Malfoy’d been gone. Harry hadn’t been surprised exactly. He himself had never done this sort of thing before, but he’d assumed this was how it worked: you met, did what you wanted to do and then you left each other alone again, because that was what a one-night stand was supposed to be like.
Okay, this was really rather awkward. Perhaps he shouldn’t have got out of bed after all.
Okay, so there it was again, the flush, spreading Draco’s shame all over his face. When Draco turned back to look at Harry, there was no malice, though, Harry was just smiling teasingly and Draco recollected himself: “Not yet, although I came hoping that you actually store some decent Firewhisky.”
Then Charlie touched his upper arm, just lightly, his hand travelling up over Draco’s shoulder to his neck.
So Harry just shot Malfoy a quick glance. “Thanks. I think.”
Potter was in the hallway, flushing slightly as he looked up at Draco, then down, and up again as if he couldn’t believe Draco was actually wearing his clothes.
And it hadn’t been a dream, because Draco didn’t wake up.
And even though the space of just one bed was definitely limited, Harry found it was remarkably comfortable to fall asleep like that.
“So the Dragon Cartel seems to be headed by a British Death Eater?“ Harry repeated. Zabini nodded.
That got Potter’s full attention and Draco could almost see the moment Potter’s resolve to actually do this kicked in. “Oh okay. Yeah, I’ll dance. Just don’t blame it on me, if I ruin your toes in the process,” he said, trying to turn to the bloke next to him only to find that the man had already admitted defeat and left.
an Auror and sometimes things happened.
Then Harry finally turned around to watch Draco, who pointedly didn’t look back, taking in the whole room except for the space where Harry was standing.
The door was at the back of the classroom, so Harry opened it carefully and stepped in.
There had only been one owl that had persistently tried to deliver pieces of parchment. And Draco knew, he knew they must be Potter’s, because who else would take the trouble, but he hadn’t even looked at them, had sent them all back unopened.
And it threw Draco off every time.
When Draco’d woken up the next day, it had been later than usual. He had gotten home from work sometime after one in the morning, which had been a ridiculous time even for him, and then he’d been so tired he’d just fallen into bed immediately, waking up with a slight headache and still tired somehow. Feeling sad.
Harry didn’t ask him anything, just gave him a look and got up, making them another round, handing Draco three toasties this time.
Malfoy had actually kept his word and made it an exceptionally quick visit, but it had still been awkward. Mrs Malfoy hadn’t commented on their explanation for visiting together, but she had kept shooting Harry quick glances that undoubtedly meant something, although Harry didn’t have a clue as to what. It had left him feeling decidedly unsettled.
. And he certainly hadn’t expected the Ministry people to follow up on that advice. Not with his history.
“And Harry was there when you finally managed to cast your insect-y Patronus?” Blaise asked smiling. He looked like he would start laughing again, if Draco gave him but the least bit incentive.
“So, you’re eating here again?” Harry concluded, not able to keep the surprise from lacing his words.
Harry couldn’t help but smile a bit: it was quite typical of Draco to put it like that.
“I came to get her out,” David said, “but they just laughed at me, so I demanded to see Alice. Her boyfriend: John something, I don’t know his last name, came with her, though. He only came to have a laugh, I suppose, because he basically just told me to leave. Alice wouldn’t be coming with me, anyway, he said. She was in no fit state to actually leave even if he were willing to let her go. And he was right. She was completely out of it, hardly even remembered me at all.” David stopped talking, his words soft with tears.
Eventually he smiled back.
Harry smiled lazily back at him, draping his arm over Draco’s shoulder and closing his eyes. Draco couldn’t help but do the same, drifting off to sleep without really wanting to yet.
“Yes, something like that,” Draco just answered rather vaguely.
“When have you last slept? Or eaten?” Harry asked, only now realising Draco probably hadn’t done a lot of either recently.
Draco turned to Harry at the same time that Harry looked at him, both nodding.
Well, obviously Draco had missed that particular memo.
“And you’ve been to his flat?” Harry nodded again, still completely at a loss. “Well, doors to a flat don’t actually reach all the way to the floor.”
Draco’s memory, that it’s reliable and that it hasn’t been tampered with in any way.”
Harry frowned. “Don’t you want to give it to her in person?”
Draco fell asleep without having said another word.
Harry turned around to look at him and the smile he flashed him was warm and reassuring, his answer quick: “No,” adding more softly, “at least not if you don’t want me to.”
Or perhaps it would be both.
Late in the afternoon they’d been called away from the warehouse they’d been surveying, however, to investigate a theft, no potions this time, but something important all the same: a wizard’s wand had been stolen.
“Well, for all
The black lines were still there, but the red ones that had been there earlier had disappeared.
That was when he looked up and saw Malfoy. “Get your arse up here,” he mouthed, apparently losing his focus enough for the mixed drink to fall out of the air. It didn’t fall far, though, because Malfoy whipped out his wand and caught it with a neat spell while walking to the bar, all elegance, ease and confidence. Harry found he had a hard time looking away.
Malfoy and Terry, however, now seemed to agree on something for once. They were both watching Harry like he’d finally lost it.
But it looked like this would easily be the longest week of Harry’s entire life.
Saturday night at the club was one thing. The rest of the week was another. It was as it had been for years now.
He would take it to Malfoy first thing tomorrow.
“Well, the blue’s gone.” Harry was still watching him, his gaze soft and intent, the ghost of his touch lingering on Draco’s cheek. “At least it’s off your
There was the familiar stab of pain and although Draco had almost been waiting for it, it still took him by surprise. Of course it would be like this, though: Harry wasn’t going to be with him, because he liked to be. No, Harry just wanted to help Draco, because it would take his mind off Ron and his injuries. Of fucking course.
Potter didn’t comment on it, though. “It won’t hurt as much this time.” he said as he sat down on the bed again, phial in hand.
He had been reaching his phone forward, and Harry realised he’d probably just wanted to show him, but now he pulled it back again, getting up in the same movement, his face shuttered.
flat.
Draco didn’t really know whether he’d manage to keep standing long enough to actually take a shower, but he
Draco felt something profoundly proud bubbling up, but because he didn’t think Harry would appreciate it much, he stopped it short, just a small smile leaking out. “Well, thank you,” Draco sounded almost shy, which was certainly not what he’d been aiming for. “Perhaps we just need to look at it from a different perspective, though,” he heard himself say next.
Harry could almost feel the lie as Nott was saying it and he thought Draco did too.
“So you actually use it,” Harry concluded, his voice soft, gentle.
He’d gotten completely pissed and then he’d done the one thing he really shouldn’t have: he’d gone to Harry’s house. Draco didn’t remember all the details and he certainly didn’t remember what they’d been talking about exactly, but he’d recollected enough to know he’d made a complete and utter fool of himself.
When Harry got in slightly later, Malfoy was gone.
It hadn’t taken Harry much time to write the piece of parchment that he had pushed under Draco’s door just now. He knocked softly. “Draco?”
“He-, I don’t know really. He was cursed, but I don’t remember the exact spell. So you must be Corentin Didier?” The Healer just nodded and Harry quickly introduced himself, not wanting to waste too much time, but not wanting to be rude either.
The Malfoy that Harry knew how to deal with.
“Potter.”
Just being utterly professional.
Draco still didn’t say anything, his face showing contempt at Nott mainly, but Harry also saw the confusion that flitted over his face. And Harry couldn’t keep it in anymore. “But he does. I, Draco, I-.” Harry couldn’t really find the words, but he went up to Draco and kissed him like he had wanted to ever since Nott had parted them, pouring everything he felt into that one single kiss.
Perhaps they’d both grown up: he and Malfoy. Quite contrary to Terry, though, it seemed.
“Hey. You’re still here.” It was the first thing Potter said when he’d stumbled out of the green flames.
if we’re late for lunch again. Especially since we can’t stay long. Shirin has a French test tomorrow and you know I promised-.” Draco’s face had gone all serious again. Tutoring was very important to him: he hadn’t missed one single session. And for some reason that always did something to Harry. “Don’t give me that look,” Draco said next, his voice both warm and pleading somehow.
“Yes, completely ridiculous.” Suddenly all playfulness had left Malfoy’s voice: he sounded cold and reserved.
. “So are they going to stay like this?” Draco asked.
And Malfoy let him, swaying a bit, even with Harry’s arm still firmly wrapped around his waist. Fortunately Malfoy didn’t comment on that: probably quite accurately having decided that talking was not a particularly good idea just now.
He placed their tea on the coffee table – why wasn’t it called a tea table, anyway? – and sat down like that was what he always did, drinking tea in his bathrobe. “So how was Luna?” He asked next, because that seemed as good a place to start as any.
“Good. Do you want to come over to mine?” And because Harry seemed to realise what that sounded like, perhaps suggesting something else entirely, he added: “You know, to eat.”
Zabini proceeded to put the bracelet securely around Harry’s wrist. “And I think you really should be careful.” Zabini’s dark eyes were completely serious, betraying real worry for the first time. “And please use the bracelets if necessary, because Draco-.”
“So how does that Muggle phone thing of yours actually work?” he decided to ask, while plonking down on the armrest of Malfoy’s seat.
“So?” Harry gestured inwards and Draco let him pass, undoubtedly just the right amount of reluctance on his face.
Draco proceeded with Harry into the next room.
It was that Friday afternoon, when Harry walked out of the Ministry canteen after lunch, that he finally saw him for the first time in years.
Apparently, however, Harry had had other ideas, though, because when Draco was at the end of his long shift, ready to go home, Harry walked up to him.
Harry sincerely hoped breakfast would arrive quickly.
Much like Malfoy really, who combined his career as a Curse-Breaker at the Ministry with a morning and an afternoon of teaching Aurors in Training.
“Unless I’m very much mistaken the Cartel will send the cleaners now.” Zabini said next. Harry must have looked puzzled, because Zabini added: “The Cartel uses them to clean up anyone that’s, let’s say, interfering. They will send them soon, because they would want this place to open for business as usual tomorrow. Without us in it, obviously.”
Draco decided not to tell Potter his weekend really hadn’t started yet, wouldn’t for a while to come, because there still was a heavily warded cabinet waiting for him in Curse-Breaking. So he just answered: “Yes, you too.”
He skipped the obvious conclusion, though: the part where they were utterly and completely fucked.
It was utterly satisfying and Draco took his time, figuring that after a night spent working and a day spent waiting for the bathroom to be fitted, he probably deserved it.
Draco decided that wasn’t going to happen twice, so he moved, effortlessly, almost  languidly, but instead of raising his hands over his head, this time he placed them on Potter’s hips, slowly, slightly hesitantly.
Draco didn’t exactly know whether this ensemble would match Harry’s idea of not-too-fancy, but it definitely was the level Draco was willing to stoop to. If he went somewhere Muggle for dinner, Draco would normally have worn a suit.
Because, well, he was having it for Draco sodding Malfoy.
as his plus one for tonight?
Then Draco started screaming again: desperate and terrified.
He was right. The pain started to subside again rather quickly.
Draco wrapped Harry securely into his arms, shielding him from the fire all around them as much as possible.
was why Harry had kissed him just now, why they had made out: Harry had just wanted the hurt that the bond caused him to stop. That made complete, fucking sense.
“Do you want to come?” Harry eventually clarified.
So Draco got up, making it to the door just when Zacharias Smith happened to come in. Smith didn’t say anything, just glancing at him with a look of contempt that left very little to the imagination. Draco stood even straighter and looked down at him with practiced disdain.
They dressed quickly, making it to the official dining room – the one that Kreacher had insisted he’d serve dinner in - still holding each other by the waist, the shoulders.
When Draco woke up again, he felt much clearer, although he wasn’t entirely sure that was a good thing given the circumstances. Luna was by his bedside again too and for some reason, now, in his less sedated state, he felt disappointed.
Astoria smiled at him warmly. “Me too,” she said, “I really don’t regret our arrangement. We were good together. It’s just-, I wanted-“
Luna sat there, still smiling softly, watching him patiently and when, after a short while of studying him, she started to talk again, it was with great kindness. “Well, I’m afraid we’ve ruled out all other possibilities. You
“I’ll have to leave in about three quarters of an hour, so there’s still plenty of time,” Harry said next, sitting down.
Draco’s decision whether to take on an internship as a Healer in France had been an easy one to make then.
Nott evidently hadn’t been, though, flinching back ever so slightly. Then he seemed to collect himself again, saying:  “So, the rumours are true then? You have actually joined the other side?” He said it just addressing Draco, not even acknowledging Harry’s presence any further.
And it had undoubtedly been the enticing scent of Draco’s cologne that had done the rest, making Harry pin him to the wall of the alley and going straight for his lips, hot and inviting against his own, just a hint of tongue that wasn’t near enough. So - no other choice available - Harry had deepened their kiss, leaving them both breathless.
,” he said indicating Draco’s abdomen, where the curse had hit.
The same way Harry got jealous of Ron and Hermione sometimes, at how their relationship was completely natural to them: at how they just seemed to fit.
“You trusted him,” Draco simply answered and his voice sounded soft. He knew about trust and where it could lead and although he didn’t know whether he could ever quite forgive himself for all the trust he’d put in the wrong people when he was younger, he found he didn’t have any difficulty making allowances for Penelope.
Robards went on explaining some more and then some other officials went on doing the same and Harry found himself phasing out. He knew all of this already: last week had been all about this new Cartel. Well that, plus he hadn’t had any coffee yet, and it sort of caught up with him now.
“Of course you did.” Draco said it still whispering, managing to sound rather disdainful, while simultaneously shooting Harry an amused smirk. “Let’s just say, you’re not supposed to be able to push it off. That is, if you’re not
“Ready?” Harry came into Draco’s hospital room looking reassuringly rested and stunningly good in Muggle clothes: grey jeans and a green T-shirt that would have been befitting a Slytherin, but that also did Harry’s eyes real favours.
It was only when the Healer that came in asked Draco to get up – so he would be able to have a better look - that the pain spiked, suddenly getting to be so intense that Draco mercifully passed out.
And that he hadn’t felt like that in a startlingly long time.
actually do this, you know, if they’re so much alike?”
Then a sound, light, like a bell. It seemed to originate from the wards, but it was gone in another instant.
“So heading back to Malfoy?” Terry had been giving little pinpricks on the subject all day, so Harry should probably have seen it coming.
Harry
When Harry got back to Malfoy’s suite, it was completely quiet.
It had taken them under two minutes to get their stuff from the house, send the Ministry a Patronus to alert them of their find and to pack the Time-Turner into Harry’s satchel that conveniently seemed to have much more space than it should. Then they walked into the grounds around the house, so they could get outside of the wards and apparate out.
Harry couldn’t have slept for more than four, perhaps five, hours when he was woken up by an owl that had attacked the window with a vengeance. It was an owl Harry recognised straight away.
Harry seemed to study him for a moment, before asking: “Would you mind?”
And suddenly Harry decided he’d had enough. He swallowed the rest of his beer down in one and made it to the dance floor without a second thought. The way he bumped into the man behind Malfoy was probably a bit too much, but Harry found he didn’t care. This week Malfoy was his responsibility and he’d be damned if Malfoy was going to pull anyone now. That just wouldn’t do. He was practically in custody for fuck’s sake.
at your bathroom, not using it.”
“Potter.” It had taken Draco slightly longer to answer than he had intended it to, but at least Potter’s name had come out the cool statement he’d been going for. “This isn’t going to work,” he added. He was satisfied with his voice still sounding in control, his usual drawl firm in place, although the pain was flaring.
Malfoy shrugged. “Something simple.” He didn’t seem prone to explain any further, but Harry kept on looking at him questioningly, full Auror mode. “Oh, don’t give me that look.” Malfoy smiled a bit, obviously trying for a light tone. “Just a sandwich or something.”
Zabini nodded slowly: “So you’re going to go back in? Together?”
And now there was just the practical test left.
Potter kept watching him for a moment. “You can sit down, you know.” His smile had become just the slightest bit broader. So Draco went to occupy the chair opposite Potter, only now realising Potter had probably expected him to sit down without being invited to.
Draco’s answer was slow, but it was there - of course it was - because when had he ever refused Harry. “Yes, I thought I’d go for mostly Muggle furniture. I rather like a modern Scandinavian style.” Here Harry looked surprised and Draco felt the need to explain: “The flat Astoria and I occupied in Paris was completely furnished like that.” Adding, quietly, almost as an afterthought: “It’s as much opposite to the style of the Manor as you can get.”
“Don’t talk.” Harry’s voice came out remarkably softly. He had registered that Draco using his last name had actually hurt, but this was not the time to go into that. “I’ll take you to the British Room,” Harry just said.
“You didn’t have to. She saw.” Harry knew his voice sounded soft and Draco just watched him, his eyes unreadable. “She even wrote a letter to Robards about it,” Harry continued.
not think it is.”
Okay, so he’d have to be in one house with Malfoy for at least four more days. That couldn’t be too hard. Even in this situation Harry should still be able to make it work. He really should.
the blankets as opposed to slipping under them. He would just be resting a little after all.
“So he was cursed.” The Healer repeated matter-of-factly, not visibly fazed by the way Draco looked: pale, unmoving, just those eyes stupidly shifting underneath his lids.
Draco, in the meantime, proceeded to free something from his left sleeve almost languidly and all of a sudden Harry knew. The log. Draco still had the Cartel’s log, holding their experimental potions: their effects and how they were brewed.
Blaise looked unperturbed, which really didn’t surprise Harry at all. Blaise was still friends with Malfoy after all, so he was probably used to jabs that were much nastier. “Yes, I think it actually is your luck,” Blaise just said flatly, sounding completely serious.
And even though Harry had been okay with Draco helping him this afternoon, had even refused to be treated by anyone else, that really didn’t mean anything. Nothing at all. It just meant Harry thought Draco was a fairly good Healer, if anything.
It was the kind of thing that made Draco exceedingly happy.
Nurie nodded. “When can I expect you back?” she then asked Malfoy.
So Harry eased him down carefully. The bed was so soft and Draco felt so tired all of a sudden that he almost gave in, remembering he had promised to keep sitting only just in time.
Here Malfoy just stopped talking, and Harry kept looking. “So?” Harry eventually asked. “What is it?”
He found himself leaning against Harry, his face buried in the nook of Harry’s neck. It was so familiar, so warm and inviting and he allowed himself to lean into it even more. Harry just let him, holding him up.
He resolved not to overthink why that could be. Well, he didn’t actually need to. He already knew.
“No, of course I don’t. It’s fucking irritating, but Luna said that if we act upon this bond that we apparently have, it should ease.”
It sounded like Harry’s answer mattered.
She didn’t say anything about what he looked like, though, knowing him too well for that too, but Draco realised he probably didn’t look too good. By lack of a kitchen and time he hadn’t had a proper meal for ages and because he hadn’t expected company today he hadn’t even bothered about his hair or anything else much, either. He had a small mirror in his bathroom, due to the previous owner of his flat, but he had successfully avoided looking into it today, because, well, what would have been the point anyway?
Okay, so this was not going to be a quiet evening off.
To find out this was it, was strangely touching.
It took Harry a slight moment to process: ah, Terry and his stupid fucking opinion.
“I really thought Dean and I were meant to last. We were so happy together.”
A few moments later Zabini ordered his meal in fluent French – Harry suspected all Slytherins must have had secret French classes in the dungeons – leaving Harry to just point out what he wanted to have on the menu.
Draco had known Luna had been training as a Healer since Hogwarts, but he hadn’t really expected her to be
It had been a long day, but the two French Aurors had finally left, having been informed of almost everything that went on in Training. They’d obviously been well-versed as Aurors and Trainers in their own country, knowing exactly what to ask and raising all the important questions.
It was the sort of establishment that in London would have been on Knockturn Alley: dark, depressing and usually filled with people who strongly valued their privacy. Zabini, or Francois as Harry had to call him in public, was already at their table when Harry came in, only looking up when Harry was almost right in front of him.
And even if they weren’t together Potter had never dated men, had he? And least of all Ex Death Eaters.
Thanks to my wonderful beta (who has kept me from making some rather massive mistakes). All remaining mistakes are, of course, my own.
This time, when Harry knocked, Malfoy’s answer took slightly longer again. Then the door swung open.
His face and hands were instantly covered in small wounds that started bleeding almost straight away, his blood mingling with angry tears and his hands curled up in white-knuckled fists.
nothing extraordinary.
“Mhm,” Draco conceded, “but I think we’ve already established that I’m very much only partially Veela.”
“Ah, Potter, Draco.” It was indisputably Blaise’s familiar drawl, but Draco couldn’t figure out why
Now Malfoy clenched his jaw just a bit, then swallowed, his brow slightly furrowed and his eyes too bright all of a sudden. “My mother told me that he used to have this box as a child.” Malfoy paused for a beat, then added: “I’d never seen it before, but she had. She told me she really liked it. I can see why.” His voice was so quiet, thick with emotion and Harry felt like he was intruding upon a very private moment.
That was how
It seemed Harry had something else on his mind though. “You know I was married to Ginny for going on nine years,” Harry eventually started, completely out of the blue, and Draco clenched his jaw, not really knowing what to expect next. “And, well, I’d like to know: how’s, you know,
From then on in it had been easy: the daughter-in-law had apparently figured she could take the wizard’s wand in exchange for her Firebolt. So when the Firebolt had been returned, she’d given back the wand.
“Draco, you’re pale as a ghost. Let me see!” Harry didn’t yell, but it was very obvious that he was not going to let this go.
“Should I go?” Harry asked sleepily, after they’d finished what they irrevocably ended up doing on their Saturday nights.
“Oh, just get up,” Harry huffed.
“So-,“ Harry decided not to address the previous evening at all. Malfoy hadn’t done so, so it was probably okay not to. Instead he decided to tackle another subject. “So, I’m your bodyguard now? Did you actually get any threats?” Harry was aware it sounded sort of  doubtful, as if he didn’t actually believe any of it and he wasn’t entirely sure he didn’t mean it that way, either, at least a bit.
Harry nodded. Whatever this would turn out to be, it wasn’t something to take on in an establishment full of witches and wizards and certainly not the ones that seemed to frequent
Harry shook his head.
That was when Harry noticed their wards go off, signalling someone at the door. It probably meant that breakfast had arrived, beautifully in time.
Potter’s smile was so unexpected that Draco almost forgot to nod and send a tentative smile back, but he
and even in
“I do think your dragonfly Patronus is really fitting though,” Harry answered. There was a glint to his eyes and Draco should have heeded that. But he didn’t, expecting Harry to tell him something along the lines of what Luna had said about the dragonfly and what it symbolised.
So Harry turned towards him, sitting up, deciding to just tell him. “Look, I shouldn’t have-. I know you weren’t trying to-.” Well, he apparently decided to half-tell him. Why was it so hard to just say it?
“Yes, but she took all the basic training and rotations. She actually
had never been serious, just a bit of fun, a way to try whether he actually liked boys that way. To him Draco had been a friend (or something along those lines at least) with benefits, nothing more.
Today Blaise had stayed at Draco’s flat rather longer than Draco had expected him to, his visit welcome as always. Blaise was the only Slytherin that Draco was still in contact with: all others having fled the UK, or not particularly prone to want to associate with Draco, fallen from grace as he’d been ever since the war.
The only way available lead through a waterfall.
It made Harry hopeful in a way he hadn’t expected.
And still Potter hadn’t mentioned anything about the Saturdays in the club, not even alluding to them, not once, which meant Draco had leapt to the conclusion that Potter’s way of coping with this actually was exactly the same as his own: his day-life and his night-life two completely separate worlds.
“Yeah,” Harry acknowledged, “he asks me whether you could perhaps come into work for a few hours tonight. Apparently someone couldn’t come to work tonight because they had a sick child and Zabini had to send another colleague home because he was having an actual fever. You’d just have to work for two hours: twelve to two. He says he’s got everything covered from two on.” Harry watched Malfoy. “Do you want to fill in?” It was a genuine question. If Malfoy actually wanted to do this, Harry wasn’t going to stand in his way.
Draco realised this would probably have been cause for some silent panicking on his part, if he hadn’t felt so utterly grounded.
that.” A silence followed that Zabini eventually filled with: “You know I wasn’t even allowed to visit him there.”
picked up on a bit of information that could be really interesting.”
“I’m glad we did it,” Harry said softly while turning, so he could look Draco properly in the eyes.
“Yes, and there’s that.” Robards pondered before seemingly making a decision: “Harry, I hope you and Mr Malfoy get along.” Harry knew that Robards was aware they didn’t. “Because he’ll be your responsibility for the next week. Until we know more.”
is.” He was holding the piece of parchment that Harry had written to him between his thumb and index finger as if it were something filthy. Harry felt the hope that had just flared up, fade away immediately.
Blaise regarded him. “I’m fairly sure you’ll find Draco in his flat and I definitely think you should talk. Draco probably misinterpreted. It happens.”
“I’m going to sit you down on the bed. Do you think you can sit, just until I take your shirt off?” Harry asked.
Draco just nodded, not really knowing where this went and being quite certain that wherever it was, it couldn’t be anywhere good.
It was a feeling that Harry knew. A feeling that definitely didn’t come with people he was just friends with, though.
The surprise on Zabini’s face grew into something like amusement. “Did you now? Really?” It came with a smile that was so Slytherin it made Harry uncomfortable. It was like Zabini knew something Harry wasn’t privy to, but that Harry should have known all the same. “But yes, Claude. He’s helped him in more ways than one.”
Draco reached for the chair, willing himself not to touch Potter. Potter himself seemed to have no such qualms, though, as Draco suddenly found Potter’s arm firmly around his waist, solid and strong.
“I’ll make us a sandwich: it’s late and I really don’t feel like making anything else, if that’s okay,” Draco said when Harry had actually voiced he was hungry.
Harry had thought it would be utterly boring, just sitting at the bar waiting for Malfoy’s shift to end, but it wasn’t, not really. The deep, rather monotonous pounding of the bass made his mind drift in a rhythm of its own, while his gaze was held by Malfoy, whom he, of course, was supposed to keep an eye on.
more than once, not before Potter that was.
“Please, stay,” he repeated warmly and he felt his smile grow into something that was probably much too soppy, but that he really couldn’t stop.
Harry’d thought this subject should be safe, but he wasn’t entirely sure now, because Malfoy seemed quiet when he answered and Harry didn’t exactly know why. “No, not usually. Nurie asks me to, but I don’t think I should. She really doesn’t need another mouth to feed, and I-. Well, I’m in no position to, erm, make it worth her while.”
“I was good at a lot of things.” Draco couldn’t resist a small smirk. He had always been a good student at Hogwarts, although, much to his father’s exasperation and his own at the time, Granger had been better. He decided not to go there, though: “But as I recall you did rather well in Potions too, at least in sixth year.”
If he’d ventured to do so.
Malfoy’s voice sounded as condescending as ever, but it also had a playfulness to it that was completely unexpected and Harry watched him in surprise for a moment. Then Harry just smiled at him, the sort of genuine smile he normally reserved for his friends, for people close to him. “Yeah, who’d have thought,” he said, almost conspiratorially bumping Malfoy’s shoulder. For an instant Malfoy froze, watching him, then gave Harry a smile too, an openly visible one this time. Harry didn’t think he’d ever seen this particular kind of smile on Malfoy before. It seemed real, almost, well, vulnerable. Harry found he liked it.
It seemed to be a genuine question and Draco couldn’t help but be a bit surprised. Of course he didn’t mind: he really didn’t appreciate people gawking either, although when they looked at him it was for an entirely different reason.
has a blasted insect for a Patronus.”
know my translations were completely off.” Draco smiled a little, hoping that Potter would pick up on the humour he’d intended. Merlin, he felt tired. “Besides I told you I speak the language. I-.” This time it was Draco who was stopped short.
be nursed back to health, they will be able to do it. Besides I think it’s also his safest option right now. Now go!”
“We’re fine,” and Harry realised how true that was. They hadn’t even argued yet, not really.
of all people. If anyone had done anything stupid tonight, it obviously was Malfoy himself. He had run off like the dramatically pompous twat he clearly still was. Whatever happened and whatever Luna thought, Malfoy evidently couldn’t have changed that much.
Draco apparated into Harry’s house without a second thought.
Harry saw that his words still didn’t seem to convince Malfoy, although he had apparently decided not to look a gift horse, or baguette in this case, in the mouth, because he sat down. “Well, the gesture is appreciated,” Malfoy said next, his eyes still holding confusion, but genuine warmth as well.
Harry couldn’t argue with that.
“Oh,” Potter just said and if Draco hadn’t known any better, he’d have thought Potter looked slightly disappointed. “I thought that perhaps we could grab a coffee somewhere, you know, other than the canteen?”
“I almost didn’t recognise it, though. It looks, well, comfortable.” Malfoy said it with some difficulty, which was when Harry realised he’d surprisingly made him a compliment. Of sorts.
“Yes, dinner. Very important, of course.” Malfoy’s voice had levelled out completely now and so had his face.
But then Harry smiled at him and he let himself believe. “Yes, I’d like to.”
finished the sentence, though. “Yes, I gathered as much. I heard you’re really, really good at what you do.”
Draco smiled a little, languidly, unfocussed, then unexpectedly leant his head against Harry’s shoulder. “’S nice.”
needed. Draco’s wound should definitely be treated.
And Harry would have been quite content if it had stayed that way.
was stupid.
Draco nodded, still short of breath, but also slightly more put together. “I know, I just-.” Then he looked up at Harry, his grey eyes intent as if he was finally really seeing him. He fell silent for a bit, before saying: “You don’t need-, to stay. I’ll be fine.” His voice was both tired and absolutely genuine.
When Harry got back to Malfoy’s suite, he was late.
So, here he was, probably, no certainly, not looking his best, but he was here all the same. He hadn’t put much effort, well, even less than normally, into his appearance this morning, just glad he’d made it almost in time, but as soon as he stepped into Robard’s office he knew that had been a mistake.
And that absolutely seemed to be the most important thing right now.
my  birthday today, so I’m afraid that also means I get to choose when we’ll have breakfast.”
When Harry went to pick it up, he could feel the tingle of the Wards that Draco had set on their room, his magic lightly washing over Harry, letting him pass.
.” Draco hadn’t wanted the despair to seep through his every word, but it had anyway. He was so done with not having something as basic as a kitchen.
“Well, I thought you might like to have it before the weekend,” Potter explained.
He promptly fell asleep there.
Oh well, on second thought, Draco didn’t think any amount of alcohol could be quite enough to make this awkward situation any more bearable.
Harry shoved him away enough to be able to look at him and Draco braced himself for the inevitable. The cold had started again, but it didn’t matter. Nothing really did anymore and somewhere at the back of his mind there was the knowledge that Veela usually didn’t do well when rejected by their mate.
“Quite okay, I assure you. They just interviewed me: about how I knew you, whether you were to be trusted, that sort of thing. I think I was able to tell them what they needed to hear, though.”
“Well, I only told you that I don’t give presents on an empty stomach,” Draco’s voice managed its usual arrogance, but it was laced with humour. “I never said I do give them on a full one.”
There was a reason Draco didn’t normally have lunch at the canteen and it didn’t have anything to do with time. Well, at least that definitely wasn’t all there was to it: he actually
That’s when they heard the footsteps. Fuck.
“You must have missed it, though, being in the wizarding world,” Harry said, remembering Malfoy’s family and all that pure-blood crap he’d grown up with. Malfoy just gave him a long stare, something cold in his eyes all of a sudden that Harry really didn’t like, but that he didn’t know how to undo. So he just decided to ask what he’d wanted to anyway: “Is that why you started to work for Zabini?”
, but he found his mouth had forgotten how to form words.
And suddenly they were close.
Harry sent a cushioning charm Draco’s way, while Draco cried his name and sent an
Then Draco’s eyelids moved, they didn’t actually open, but they moved. It was as if Draco had to put in a lot of effort to open them and wasn’t quite able to do so yet.
that he wouldn’t have to anymore: he wouldn’t have to let this go.
“Harry, your Wards have been taken down.” It was Lisa Turpin bringing some of their Auror colleagues, but fortunately no Terry Boot. Harry brought his wand down immediately. “We were basically able to walk right in,” Lisa continued.
Harry was openly laughing. “It’s not the spell, you pillock. It’s the caster, as you well know.” His eyes were on Draco now, soft with laughter. “You even have paint on your face. If you go on like this you’ll be just as blue as your walls by the time we’re done.” Draco knew he should have felt offended, but there was a remarkably gentle quality to Harry’s words, that rendered Draco completely incapable of any such thing.
Harry couldn’t help but smile back. “Oh, give it here,“ he said mock-fighting Malfoy for his espresso and taking a sip without thinking. It really didn’t taste anything like coffee.
time for Draco to get up, however, so Draco sighed and extricated himself from Harry, knowing that Harry would take less time to get ready for work than he did.
Draco blinked his eyes a few times, feeling graceless tears roll down his cheeks that he hadn’t actually noticed had been hiding there. He apparated home straight after he’d stumbled outside.
“Fuck, Malfoy, you’re bleeding. Why didn’t you Apparate straight to St Mungo’s?” Well, for the simple reason that Draco hadn’t been able to. Not yet. The day after tomorrow that would all have been different.
Sitting in the small, Italian restaurant that Harry had taken them to, was slightly awkward at first. They were staring at each other over the table, both apparently lost for words somehow and Draco started to fear that this might have been a mistake, that  it was too official too soon, that Harry didn’t like it.
“Well no, nothing prior to this case.” Penelope didn’t quite look at Harry or Draco. Then she started to explain: “Apparently some time before we started working on the house, Mathew was approached by a group of Death Eaters that knew the Time-Turner was actually there. The owner of the wards had died in the war though, so they couldn’t get to it themselves. And that’s where we came in. They hoped we would be able to break the ward. And Mathew was to make sure the Death Eaters would get the Time-Turner once it had been freed. He would have been paid a very handsome fee for that.”
Draco had somehow had to remind himself of that every day since, though.
“No, not really,” the girl surprisingly continued, “Professor Malfoy said he’d take care of it. It’s just, well, she’s late coming to
One last time.
“That might be a matter of perspective,” Draco answered wryly.
Hermione had just told Harry that Draco had said something about being tired and that he’d looked upset. And although Harry had noticed that she had wanted to talk about this some more, he really hadn’t felt up to it. She had probably reached conclusions that he really wasn’t ready to discuss with her, or anyone else, just now.
There was that slightly confused frown on Malfoy’s face again and Harry felt sure he would say ‘no’, only this time Malfoy didn’t, answering: “Well, I suppose I could do with some
“It basically is what it says, though,” Malfoy continued. “It’s a way to project a whole constellation around you. As you probably know the Blacks have always been rather preoccupied with stars and constellations. But as I said before: it’s best if I just show you.”
When Draco spotted Potter, he was standing against a wall, looking around, catching Draco’s eye almost the moment he came in. Draco was drawn his way without even thinking about it, their eyes locked all the time it took Draco to reach him.
Draco sat up on the sofa slowly, trying to hear whether the rest of the house was still silent, whether Harry would still be in bed. It would be so much easier for the both of them if Draco left before Harry would see him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No,” Harry answered with the rather unsettling need to defend himself. “No, it’s just so fucking hot in there.”
Harry shot Malfoy a puzzled glance that Malfoy apparently interpreted correctly, answering: “I rent a room here. Their eldest son has left, because he’s earned a full scholarship to Cambridge, and they’re renting out his room.”
“I really need to go now. Knock yourself out,” Harry continued.
“And, just so you know, I don’t think there are essay titles that are longer than this,” Harry said playfully and just the slightest bit offended, when he looked up from his letter again.
Well, Harry had thought he should at least return Draco’s clothes. He could hardly keep them, now could he?
Harry seemed to give the question considerable, deliberate thought. “I’ll just have tea, if that’s all right. I think having alcohol now-, well, it’s probably not a good idea,” he said eventually. Harry didn’t elaborate and Draco didn’t ask, not wanting to know if Harry would still be going anywhere else this evening.
“Where the hell have
“Yes, well, you do know what doors are for.” Draco sounded as indifferent as ever. “I mean you can close them and -.”
Now it was Draco who pulled him in, their kiss tender at first, but very soon starting to get needy, almost desperate, like it could never, ever be quite enough.
And even though he was obviously still weak, his words were filled with a warmth that was completely impossible to miss. Draco couldn’t help but bask in it for a moment.
exactly. I-, I just needed to know something.” Harry stopped and Draco found himself watching Harry, willing him to go on, to tell him what Harry had wanted to ask Luna, what he apparently hadn’t felt like asking Draco.
“So, if you write him a letter, you could-.”
Last Friday Malfoy had declined Harry’s invitation, because he’d already had lunch, but that most probably wouldn’t be the case now. Too early. So perhaps Malfoy would be more inclined to join Harry today.
He started to move. Fluent, seductive movements that he’d also had the opportunity of perfecting in all the time he’d been frequenting this place. He’d seen Potter watch him last week, had seen how Potter had apparently appreciated the view.
He knew Potter was not together with the Weaselette anymore, that had made all the newspapers just after the trials, but well, they’d still been dancing together at the Muggle club, looking very much like a couple, so perhaps there was something there still. It wouldn’t be the first time the newspapers got it all wrong.
“I’m off tomorrow,” Harry’s answer was quite shocking in its simplicity, its ease. “I can be here, let them in.”
His voice sounded serious enough, but his eyes betrayed amusement and it mesmerised Draco, making him take slightly too long to answer: “Only if your Healer can get himself a glass, too.” At least his voice sounded even enough.
Instead of Apparating, Harry and Draco walked to the gardens: “They’re heavily warded so you can’t just Apparate in. Besides, I like walking
Then ducked, because Nott had apparently turned his attention towards him, while around them the fighting had started once more: wizards and witches firing spells everywhere.
was something Harry could actually do.
perhaps, so Draco stopped Harry with a quick hand to his forearm, hardly touching him at all.
It was only then that Draco rather vaguely realised, there could only be one explanation: he had apparently sprouted real wings now – and it hadn’t even hurt – but he couldn’t dwell on it, because Harry opened his eyes, looking dazed and obviously still in pain, but trying to speak nonetheless.
Until Potter had left, that was. Until, just like that, he’d been gone.
When Draco went to the canteen the next day he’d shoved all sorts of second and third, even fourth thoughts aside. He’d promised to come, so he would.
Here Harry shot him a look and Malfoy obviously understood what he meant, adding, slightly amused: “We didn’t use the former Nemesis part, or whatever we were in school, for the papers. I didn’t think it would be terribly helpful to your cover.”
He addressed Draco first: “Well, if it isn’t Draco Malfoy. I actually thought I might have the pleasure of seeing you here someday.” His tone could easily have been mocking, but it wasn’t. “I didn’t really count on him being here too, though.” He made a dismissive gesture in Harry’s direction. “I would have thought you’d have the decency to work with someone less offensive.”
Malfoy had been sentenced to a year of Azkaban just after his trials, and although the Dementors had been banned from guarding it by then, it was still bound to leave a rather definite mark on anyone who’d been there. Including Malfoy obviously.
Terry kept watching him incredulously, but apparently couldn’t find a counterargument convincing enough, finally nodding his reluctant consent.
And it obviously caught Draco’s attentions, making him look at Harry with an unreadable expression, his pupils dilating just a fraction and his cheeks turning slightly pink.
“Through here.” Draco gestured to a door opposite to where they were standing. It lead to a long corridor to the side of which there were two enormous halls in which potioneers were brewing in large cauldrons. Then a third in which people were sitting at rows of tables, seemingly doing something meticulous and complicated.
Draco got up, finding Harry’s Ogden’s in the same spot it had been in all those years ago. So he got them tumblers and sat himself down again, pouring them both a generous measure and handing Harry one.
actually like to get home, though.
It took him a moment to process what the sticky wetness he encountered there actually was.
Luna smiled her aethereal smile. “Yes, you had Harry really worried. We had to force him out eventually to be able to treat you, to let you rest. He’s been waiting in the waiting room ever since.” For some reason that seemed to settle Draco’s frayed nerves a little. Luna paused just a beat, watching Draco. “Shall I ask him to come in?”
“Come on,” Harry’s voice was even closer now than Luna’s had been, “Let’s get you up.” Harry sounded surprisingly warm. Then he just put his arm under Draco’s and hoisted him up, slowly, carefully, with just a tingle of his caressing magic to help.
It really was quite pleasant.
Malfoy looked at Harry again, questioningly arching his eyebrows, but of course there was no way that Harry was going to turn down an offer of tea, even if it came with whatever zulbia was.
Malfoy considered him for a moment, apparently not entirely sure how Harry had meant this question. “Yes, actually,” he then answered, “As I obviously
“Tonight too?” Harry knew he’d asked too fast, too urgently. It really, really wasn’t his business what Zabini was up to later tonight.
It took Harry just a moment to process, after which he wasn’t able to reign in a broad grin. “Really?” But then he remembered the whiskey bottle in the corner. “Draco, perhaps you should just, you know, sleep a bit first, before making a decision.”
Malfoy regarded him, smiling so slightly Harry would have missed it if he hadn’t been watching intently. “Yes, it is. As much as I’d like to deny it, even sitting here with
And although the work on the house was dull, Penelope was really easy to work with, sharing her knowledge on every object they worked on and subsequently cleared.
“But there must have been more qualified Healers. Why didn’t they-?”
Draco’s words had gotten increasingly difficult to understand, quite clearly invalidating what he was saying, but he watched Harry a beat longer, holding his gaze, before succumbing to whatever the curse was doing to him again.
It didn’t matter anyway.
“No, I didn’t. I was going to make arrangements when I remembered that you actually have a house-elf that can cook,” Draco answered offhandedly. He knew that Harry had picked up on the humour that had also been there when Harry smiled at him yet again.
The object didn’t exactly feel dark or resentful though, but Harry wanted to be safe, so he did what he would have done, if he’d been on an Auror investigation: he approached the box carefully and cast the kind of Stasis Charm that was meant to keep something like this from doing any damage.
When he saw Draco sit down again, Potter relaxed a little. “Really, I won’t be very long,” he repeated. “Perhaps you’d like to look around the library?” There was a glint of amusement in Potter’s eyes and Draco wasn’t sure whether it was a serious suggestion or not.
His hands were bracing the sink, much like they had during his bathroom breakdown back in sixth. Only back then he really hadn’t wanted Harry to walk in on him. Which Harry had anyway, of course. And this time he rather desperately hoped Harry would. Which now obviously was completely out of the question.
“I hope you’re not freaking out in there.” Draco’s tone was light, but he also watched Harry carefully, his grey eyes intent. And close, very close, and very beautiful. Yes, definitely that too.
His arm was on his belly. Red. There was blood on his shirt again.
Harry had wanted to get Malfoy off the dance floor, but when Malfoy spotted him, he gave him an easy, but slightly surprised smile, taking both Harry’s hands. Then he turned and silently slid Harry’s hands over to his waist, just putting them there, nothing more. It was as surprising as it was apparently welcome: Harry didn’t back away.
The cottage, of course.
It felt so much more encouraging than it probably should.
This time he felt them coming - although surprisingly it still didn’t hurt - his wings unfolding from his back where Harry had just touched him as if that was completely normal.
Draco just nodded. “It felt like a good idea at the time,” adding, when Harry didn’t say anything whatsoever anymore: “But perhaps it wasn’t. I mean, it’s probably very inappropriate for
So this whole thing actually was just as boring as the rest of the case.
“Ah, no need for all that,” a familiar voice said and Harry realised who it belonged to within the second.
“Have a nice weekend.” Malfoy now said, filling the silence Harry still hadn’t addressed. Then Malfoy turned, probably getting back to his office.
Until Harry started to shift, turning to Draco’s side, but still holding him up with one strong arm at the same time. “We’re going upstairs,” Harry’s voice was low and a bit gravelly.
“What did you tell her about me? You know, the girl next to you at dinner?” It was the first thing Harry asked Malfoy after they had started walking back to their Apparition point.
Draco didn’t really know how to answer that. She was right, but he also really wanted to get this over with.
Harry decided not to wait and he got his wand out, focussing on the person he was to become. He felt his body shift and change almost straight away.
So perhaps Potter did actually want-.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes at him for a brief moment, while he managed to look wary, puzzled and slightly pained all at the same time. There was a beat of silence. Then he proceeded to take out his phone.
was the ring he needed to incapacitate.
There was a short pause again and then it was Potter who spoke.
When Harry checked the time, he found to his dismay that he was going to be late for his afternoon class.
“You’re worried,” Harry provided, his heart suddenly racing while he was going over all possible scenarios and how each of those could have gone horribly wrong. Malfoy wouldn’t have … .
Humiliation complete.
Until he looked up at the chimney.
“He’s my colleague,” Charlie added, coming slightly closer, “the way he was hurt, we didn’t even know whether he was going to come out of it at all, but he hardly even scarred.” Charlie sounded genuinely impressed and Draco let himself feel it. Just for a bit. His speciality was healing complex deep wounds and burns, especially when they were caused by curses, but most of his techniques worked on dragon fire induced injuries just as well. It was something he had worked really hard to become very, very good at.
), but all of the photos had something in common: both Harry and Draco looked absolutely smitten, undoubtedly in love.
It was something he and Ginny used to do when they’d ended up in this situation.
Because, even though there was a lot of theory on how Auror Training was supposed to work, how it was structured - and Harry had actually read up on all of that - he was also well-aware of the fact that he worked with a team of teachers that he wanted to get to know. How could he be heading an organisation if he didn’t even know all of its employees?
“Yes, it seems I will be.” Draco didn’t manage his usual drawl completely, but he thought he probably came close enough and for some reason that seemed to be the response Harry had been hoping for, because he beamed a full smile at Draco now.
Draco took the vial without further comment, using his wand to extract the silvery substance of his memory and putting it in.
Then he slung his towel over his hips, looked at himself in the now large mirror over the sink for a moment and …, then the door opened.
Malfoy considered him for a moment, then took Harry’s hand, grip steady and warm. “Draco, nice to meet you.” He still sounded formal, but Harry noticed with a slight jolt, that seemed to come out of nowhere, that Malfoy had called himself Draco: like Harry, he had used his first name. It felt much more intimate than perhaps it should have.
Harry was still trying to find out how Malfoy meant this, how serious he was, when Malfoy rose, just as gracefully as he had sat down, and came to sit next to Harry. Close.
“Well, not if I keep an eye on him.” Harry had said it without thinking, but once it was out he found he couldn’t take it back again. It made sense, though. At least to himself. When he’d said it.
“So you just exchanged some sort of greeting and left each other alone,” Hermione interpreted easily. “Well, at least you didn’t hex each other,” she said smiling. “I suppose civil is a good start.”
Harry nodded.
“Mr Potter?” It was the first thing Draco heard when he regained consciousness. Oh, yes, he’d had the good manners to pass out in Potter’s guestroom.
to be slightly too late.
It left Harry confused: “You don’t need me to be your bodyguard tonight?”
Gay clubs.
They had been on the Animagus’ tail all afternoon and were currently combing through one particular warehouse, because they were fairly certain the Animagus’ human form was living there somewhere.
Harry Apparated straight home, but not into the library, because he didn’t know what would be waiting for him there. So instead, when he’d fully materialised again, he found himself in the mostly disused parlour next to the library, where he cast an Auror strength Disillusionment Charm on himself. Then he proceeded into the library.
Harry’s spell hit her, efficiently binding her, but even though Draco put up their shield immediately, he couldn’t completely prevent the witch’s curse from reaching its goal too.
Here Malfoy smiled slightly deviously: “Well, tonight would be a good start. I need to attend dinner at a wizarding family’s in Liège.”
“You really should leave now, though,” Draco said and  when Harry looked up, Draco’s eyes met his, determined, but for a moment also holding an unexpected softness that Harry wasn’t quite ready for, but that he also seemed to want to hold on to. Draco’s eyes were so mesmerizing when they were soft, when he seemed vulnerable. Fuck.
Harry felt the moment Draco gave in: returning the kiss, his lips soft and insistent against Harry’s own. Harry threaded his hands into Draco’s hair so hard it must hurt, but he couldn’t really care: Draco needed to be closer. So his other arm snaked around Draco’s waist and he felt Draco’s hand on his hip, his other one on the nape of Harry’s neck, while Draco deepened their kiss almost desperately.
Harry smiled at her again, suddenly understanding. “You’re worried I might land her in trouble, because she’s late?” The girl nodded.
