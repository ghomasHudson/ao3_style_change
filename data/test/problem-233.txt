Blaise tilted his head back, humming thoughtfully to himself.

Harry was happy to just read Draco’s rant about the new Defense professor, who certainly did sound like a hack, escaping his reality for a little bit in the dark summer night of his dusty shed.
“So soon into the school year, Draco.”
After several seconds he seemed to come to his conclusion.
It must’ve been clear on his face because Blaise caught his eyes and gave a smirk so smug that Harry felt his hackles rise.
“Neville! Oh my god

"You're his godfather." Lucius pointed out calmly. He sighed once more, audibly. "I will be blunt in saying yes, I intend for Draco to learn from your mistakes, Severus. As he is now, and pursuing Darker paths, he'll never win the love of this boy. I refuse to see my son suffer this way, so Narcissa and I are taking steps to move towards the Grey. You of all people should know there is nothing I will not do for my son, and his happiness."

what the hat had meant by needing to think like a Slytherin while he was in Gryffindor to get places: he was making friends in order to obtain some kind of status for himself, and being a Gryffindor is what was giving him the opportunity to do such a thing. Gryffindor wouldn’t give him he time of day if he were trying to do this as a Slytherin, and while not impossible for Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, it’d definitely be much harder. Slytherin would be a tough nut to crack, but they

His mind whited out the pain, from the mess of suffering he could only separate the memory of him realizing he was on the ground, the cold stone a balm on his cheek from the fire ripping through his body. There was white mist…

He wasn’t sure what happened, all he knew was that the air was unnaturally hot and the moist, filthy hand on him was wrenched away as if burned. There was a shattering sound so loud his ears ached, and when his vision cleared a second later, every single thing that had been on the counters, the tables, the shelves around the kitchen… was broken on the floor, bits of broken glass and ceramic rolling to a stop across the now covered white tiles amongst twisted metal scraps of ex-kitchen appliances and splintered wooden cooking utensils.
He was so proud of himself he almost jumped at the sudden presence that seemed to

He still walked proud and tall like a Slytherin, and he came over here because he knew what he wanted and wasn’t afraid to act humble and lie to their faces with an apology he didn’t mean if it meant getting into Harry’s good books, but still…
It shattered,
Almost as an afterthought, he realized someone was yelling near him, and he lashed out, too dazed to really care about how he couldn’t move his arms properly—was someone holding onto him?— or see straight in his first light in months, or even hear because maybe he’d blown out his own eardrums screaming. It certainly felt that way, at least.
They went back to watching the Hufflepuff try and make an attempt at conversation with his Gryffindor classmate, but he was pretty awkward and she seemed too shy to form words so it didn’t seem to be going very well. He did his house proud though by pushing forward and trying to be friendly despite it though.

Eventually, he took pity on him.

when he tossed it up onto the desk, and a minute or so of shuffling pages as he flipped to the right one, he hummed a moment as he pondered whatever was written in there.
"I do. Fred and I agreed on this years ago—we were like seven really." He admitted, revealing himself to be George… which was interesting. But even as Harry watched, his eyes dimmed slightly. "It's just not always so easy, is it? Not that we ever thought it'd be."
and the Ravenclaw had no success convincing her of anything so far so… Harry called that a losing battle and didn’t bring it up.

they were gleeful in helping him hold his stuff and add in more to the pile if he asked curiously about something. One of them was kind enough to point out that he had the wrong size—it’d fit him but would ride up if he lifted his arms so he needed a size up, and since he was still growing maybe even a size larger than that so he could wear them all over the next year or so. He never had fitting clothes before so that was good information to have.

She’d been a teacher for decades, and had always maintained absolute professionalism and fairness for thousands of students who’d crossed through her classroom.
Especially as he moved the collar of the pjs he’d been put into to inspect for himself how his shoulder was doing, and his heart dropped clean into his stomach to see the ugly red line exactly where she’d told him it’d be. He didn’t give a quaffle about his shoulder though, his hand instantly snapped up to his face in horror and realized he could feel the slightly raised skin of the cut he no longer felt, but had known was there.
His whole body felt like it was under a thick layer of dense water, kind of warm and fuzzy but
. He actually preferred it this way though. “I wouldn’t call them light or dark; they were probably better described at dark grey but in reality they cared very little for any sort of politics or even other families. Even their own family actually, as they were mostly individuals rather than a clan. They traveled a great deal, so while Britain was their base of operations they had very little actual investment here so never made much impact one way or another. What investments they did make were not very profitable, I don’t think it brought them much success in general.”
“Harry Potter?” He said in an awed, reverent tone. Harry was instantly creeped out.
He pressed his lips for a moment. “It’s okay if you’re not comfortable being friends with people in other houses, people different from you… though I don’t know why you’d be happy with that.” He admitted, watching Draco looked up at him a little confused. “But I don’t intend to not be myself because of someone else’s opinion. You’re okay with that?”

“Oh, nothing. It was just a lot to figure out magic was real the same day I learn my parents were not drunks but were in fact murdered. Oh and let’s not forget the part where my wand is the brother to the wand of the man who killed them and my first friend is apparently from a family who
Even having explained this to her, Harry got the feeling Hermione didn’t actually have that many friends—if any friends at all really—so the fact he’d shown not to be a bad student and had actually been nice to her meant she now clung to him whenever she could, her earlier jealousy and/or dislike of him seeming to evaporate into thin air with one act of kindness. And she was brilliant obviously, but not so good with social cues—the fact he’d been walking with a bunch of his friends didn’t seem to have stopped her, neither did she even acknowledge anyone else around him at all. Not that doing that would’ve ended well with the likes of Blaise and Draco already only just barely being polite enough to outright ignore her rather than saying something rude like they undoubtedly wanted to.
Still.
being a hypocrite he knew he would be if he actively tried to keep someone from joining it. He was doing this less out of the goodness of his heart, and more purely to put himself on the moral high ground when it came to this animosity between them. He didn’t want to senselessly hate—he could not like someone and still work with them, in the name of his ultimate goals.
“Oh, thanks.” She smiled at him, a bit surprised someone had actually answered her question with the chaos going on around them.
Severus of course had a residence outside of Hogwarts, but the castle had his best brewing stations and most complete ingredient stores, not to mention the summer months were perfect time to get work done on his potion research, uninterrupted. Even Dumbledore left him alone on the most part, knowing he’d be in an even
"Though he'd likely deserve it, it seems a harsh way to go," they chime politely, grinning like the cat that got the canary although their eyes were not quite as joking as they usually were.

offspring… the love he felt for his old flame warred with his past hatred of the man he loathed above all when he looked at this child… so fiercely. It would've been better if it were only her eyes he had— Severus could simply refuse to look at the boy's gaze. He could look down on the boy, no eye contact, and see only a mini James Potter and this would be easier. He would be free to hate the child for the menace he was, like father like son.

Also, he rather like that people kept bringing up how good he was at transfiguration. His trade with Neville for transfiguration in exchange with herbology help seemed to be doing wonders for the both of them, as well as Neville’s confidence as he was actually a very good teacher when he was speaking on something he both liked, and knew a lot about. The praise felt nice and he
He grinned as muffled applause from a little ways away greeting him, giving a dramatic bow for the twins who were squashed together on their own rock to keep their feet out of the snow while they watched him, mittened hands making the applause slightly muted but no less enthusiastic.
“We’ll be doing our own coordinating of course but do let us know if you’d like any help,” His mother offered, leaving it open for him to talk about it now if he wished. When he was younger he definitely liked to talk through his thought process and lean on them while brainstorming, but this time he felt obligated to do it himself. Harry was

"So you were right about Gryffindor being in a tower and all--I was a bit afraid we'd get lost on our first day which would be awkward," He chatted, and the blond paused only a couple seconds before smiling back.

His whole life had always felt like he was five seconds away from being hit. Slaps upside the head or to his hands if he reached for something they suddenly decided they didn’t want him to have were more than common. Actually hitting him just to beat on him was very new, and not a good sign at all, but it shouldn’t have been surprising as it felt like Harry had been prepping to leave this horrid household and distance himself from these people since the beginning for this very reason.

He’d lost count of how many times the frustration and humiliation of being shoved back into a servant role for this absolute dickwads of human beings had brought unwilling tears to his eyes, causing him to bend his head over whatever he was cleaning in hopes no one noticed.

The boy in question hadn’t let got of his death grip on Harry’s hand since they’d entered the Great Hall, and Harry gave him a reassuring squeeze before giving him a not-so-gentle nudge forward. Once he had some momentum Neville managed to get to the stool without much issue and put the hat on with slightly shaking hands.

and he wasn’t sure he knew how.
Glamours would not work under the ward so she went physical with her disguise, shielding herself in a long white cloak and white robes beneath it already turning slightly grey from the grim of this place that seemed to pollute even the air around her. She had the hood pulled all the way up and a white scarf pulled up over her nose to shield most of her face—not very creative, but effective enough for this trip. It only had to last less than an hour, if that, and she picked up her pace quickly as she followed the directions she was given and memorizing every twist and turn of the hallways to ensure she knew her way back too.
“I think that thing is maybe more stress than it’s worth. If you’ve forgotten something, it’ll turn up eventually right? No need to worry about what you’ve forgotten in the moment, I’d think.”
That was a bit cruel though, Harry knew his Slytherin friend just cared. Didn’t make his emotions any less true.

She’d apparently gotten a lot of questions from many people about the same thing, so her response sounded kind of standard.
He was pretty much just begging, and Severus gave up on trying to teach him cleverness for today. There was too much to work on with this horrible tactic and decided that was a future problem of his to deal with.
“And to think, I spent a whole year missing out on that sarcasm. What a shame, truly.”
She made her choice of who she would be saving, and it was not going to be the headmaster at the expense of a child, and that was it. Fifty years was a lot of time to waste on a mistake, but not an excuse to keep making it.

“I’m awesome at every position, thanks.” He snarked, but there was no heat or conviction behind his sarcasm. “But yeah no, I’ve only been training my whole life to be a chaser, so that would’ve sucked. I mean I’d still love to be on the team no matter what role I got but given the nature of the role the pressure, with my lack of training… yeah that would’ve sucked.”
A full minute later the Slytherin fourth year shifted a bit uncomfortably at the searing emerald stare he was being pinned with. Just a small adjustment in their seat as he wasn’t sure why there was no response and unsure if he should be breaking eye contact first or not.

Football was very much more about his body doing some hard labor to not only run back and forth across the ground, but keep himself upright while his legs went this way and that to handle the ball at his feet. There was no magical broom or unexplained feeling of weightlessness to take off the feeling of heavy gravity working what seemed like twice as hard against his muscles. And Harry had been running for what felt like his whole life, lifting heavy things to garden and moving on quiet feet through a house that didn't want to acknowledge he lived there, so he was very much aware of his body and his abilities, likely probably more than the typical eleven or twelve year old. He simply had more training being comfortable with his body and what it could do, so it wasn't that hard to shift gears and tell it to do something new even if he'd never attempted it before. He'd also been very focused on his health choices, like what he ate and what exercise he kept, for at least a couple years now so he wasn't exactly starting from ground zero. He was at the very least partially athletic and that seemed to make all the difference.

Curious, Harry peered between the books to get a glimpse himself and realized the store wasn’t just crowded with kids getting their school texts, but with a lot of witches of all ages who seemed to be clustered around a man with a small mountain of books displayed behind him. With his brand new contacts he could even make out the titles, and realized those were their Defense textbooks for this year. They were… all very sparkly with gold and silver accents making them like shelf pieces rather than textbooks.

“Indeed it is unfortunate news. Especially when you consider the nature of the Longsgate property.” He sounded far too chipper and not only did it freak Harry out but the Malfoys actually looked disturbed through their masks too. “Several generations back, a rather eccentric Potter patriarch of the day decided he wanted his descendants to have the chance to test their mettle against unique, exotic, and dangerous beasts. Hunting wild magical creatures was much more popular in centuries past and laws on protected species not yet in place, so he feared many of the greatest offerings of nature would be hunted to extinction. And in fact he was very correct as many dozens, if not hundreds of species since that day have been entirely wiped out, or nearly so. In his concern of this he spent his lifetime seeking out and capturing a wealth of creatures, and creating what is in essence the world’s most dangerous zoo.”

“As I said, just a diagnostic spell to start off. Shouldn’t feel a thing, though the wand movement is a bit crazy.” She explained, jumping right into it by waving it in all sorts of ways Harry didn’t recognize. In fact he just looked down at the forgotten tea tray on the coffee table to ignore her motions.
Great.
“Pity I didn’t succeed that night. Or… perhaps it was fortunate, as this mirror has provided quite a perplexing challenge.” Harry felt cold when he glanced over his shoulder once more, the look in the man’s eye anything but warm. “My master believes you may be able to help overcome it.”

“That’s it! No dinner—you do your chores and get out! Dare break another thing in my house and you’ll regret the day we let you in!” His uncle bellowed in his ugly way and Harry felt his hackles rise.

“Ah, Filius was so excited fer ya to start—Charms was yer mother’s best subject and she probably would’ve been a Master in it if it weren’t for the damn war,” Hagrid unwittingly soothed his internal annoyance away like firelight melted snow, pouring him another cup of tea—not that he needed it since he’d never finish the liter-sized cup of earl grey before it was ice-cold. Harry found himself forgiving the tiny professor begrudgingly; it was one thing to be gawked at for being the Boy Who Lived, but another if he were excited simply because he was his mother’s son. Maybe he’d be willing to speak about her, since if what Hagrid was implying was true then the Charms Master must’ve known her well.

Apparently he had her face, her eyes, her hair… and he was a little bummed he still knew next to nothing about his dad, but it couldn’t put a damper on the rush he felt to finally be just that much closer to at least one of his parents. He soaked up Hagrid’s words, committing them to memory and reaffirming his vow to be kind to his hair—that he now knew he shared with a precious connection he’d never gotten the chance to cultivate.

No… if it got to that point, he was seriously considering asking Draco to pass along a note to Seamus.

“Mr. Potter.” A familiar voice interrupted his coughing and he perked up, relief at seeing someone he felt was an ally instantly making the fact Mrs. Malfoy was walking up behind them slightly better.
Despite the undercurrent of uneasiness, there was still an intense amount of relief in this turn of good fortune. He only hoped Draco’s skill lived up to the (

“Yeah. Twenty-foot Cerberus, actually. Hagrid tends to name harmless things terrifying names and terrifying things harmless names. So Fluffy will eat you but Fang will probably just drool on you.”

“You came to the right girl.” She puffed her chest out proudly. “You already know what I’m after.”

Seamus just nodded and Neville just made a squeaking noise. Harry decided to ignore the awkwardness and beamed at Draco to pointedly get to the point of him bothering to talk to this group of Slytherins at all: because Draco was his friend and he was hell bent on everyone being civil to each other regardless of if social norms had to go down in flames with him in order to get there.
“Good enough for me! I’ll take a look at it then.” Osmias laughed, finishing up and leaning back to admire his work. “They look great! I think that sheen will be popular—not an overbearing color like some but still pretty snazzy.

Glancing towards the front window though towards the sunlight shining in, looking closely he saw the fine colors, and smiled.

This was alarming for several reasons.

He hadn’t quite expected to be so successful in getting into McGonagall’s good books so early in his time at Hogwarts either, but by being an exemplary student in transfiguration and now the ‘secret weapon’ seeker on her quidditch team, he was fairly certain if she were to ever admit to such things, he’d definitely be her favorite. He appreciated that she was still painful strict and fair when it came to grades and most rules
As the pain abruptly stopped and he panted roughly into the stone beneath him, he realized he was probably

where exactly they were planted, which ones had flowers growing around them, where the tiny fountain he thought would be a nice addition would be placed, exactly how many stepping stones there were semi-overgrown in the thick, lush yard leading to each grave, and so forth. Even the bee hives that lived in one particular tree, and the fox den beneath another, and the rival squirrel families that lived in two neighboring trees in the corner. He knew what kind of weather this place had, with it’s lush springs and crispy winters, it’s rainy autumns and mild sunny summers. He knew where puddles would form during thunderstorms, and where weeds would sprout first if he didn’t tend to his mindscape properly, which plants the bugs would start to eat first, and which graves tended to collect dirt more easily than others. He knew what kinds of birds like to stop by to visit, what time of year the flowers stopped blooming on the trees, and how many branches they tended to lose during storms and heavy snows.

Neither Ron nor Draco would be held truly responsible for the actual consequence of what they were fighting over: Neville would. And Neville’s never done anything to either of them, but they’d have made him suffer over their fighting regardless.

He nodded to them, perfectly polite and not quite as jovial as normal.

“Blaise, not now. I really just have bigger things to worry about than the stupid house points.” Harry shot him a look, “Also, it was Snape. Need I say more?”

“Although if you’d like a snack before the feast, it seems you’ve received some well wishers’ gifts, many of which seem to be sweet in nature.” Dumbledore continued, walking up the side of the bed to the bedside table and bring Harry’s attention to the pile of gifts there. He immediately recognized some gifts and who probably sent them, and smiled a bit despite Dumbledore being here to be reminded of all his friends.
“For a fee Gringotts can do this, yes. We are experts in warding; goblin wards far exceed the quality of a ward any wizard can produce, and whoever created this initial ward was definitely a human. It can be easily dismantled and a new one put in place per your specifications as you request it.”

Harry was surprised, but just smiled warmly at that instead.
“I… I know you don’t want to talk about it, but you should know because people will probably ask. Susan in particular is waiting to ambush you.” Neville warned and Harry tensed up. He managed to relax slightly as the fingers in his hair got more gentle, pulling faintly as if reminding him it was okay. “A lot of people tried to write you letters over break but they all got returned unopened. Mine too, and I was… well I asked Susan because I figured she might know, and apparently she’d been telling everyone your mail wards just blocked everyone.”
Harry turned, and one of the huge snakes at the base of the tree had uncurled itself slightly, body rising up and face looking directly at him.
And… Harry felt like a terrible, terrible friend. He just… wasn’t sure how to fix it.
“Okay so… I can take copies of these? I’ll look over them myself when I have a minute, but you seem to have a handle on things for now.” The goblin nodded sharply once in agreement. Harry made a note to quiz Draco on finances—his father was a part time Barrister when needed and given his wealth clearly knew how to handle money so one could only assume Draco had picked up a thing or two and might be willing to share.

It was cool! And yeah, it was a lot harder than one would think it’d be at first, but Harry was not untalented apparently and even though he was no prodigy in other subjects apart from Transfiguration, he knew a couple charms and had several books on magical creatures that were closer to fairy tales than textbooks, so he had a feeling he would absolutely never get bored of this place, even while he was entertaining his own time alone for now.

Harry sighed… smiling a bit wryly.
She stood, leading the way back out into the hallway and towards her classroom. “I think perhaps our time would be better used addressing some questions I have for you. I’d like to run some spellwork drills, if you are up to it.”
"Oh… I suppose we sit at our own house tables?"

He hadn’t been paying attention to where he’d been walking for the last hour at least, and as he shoved the tapestry in front of him open in his frustration at his current thoughts, it only occurred to him belatedly that he should really have more caution in banging around the castle while he was invisible and technically trying to be sneaky.

it was convenient and no one he cared about was endangered for it, by Draco’s request only, but he wasn’t quite sure where his feelings would actually lay when it came down to it. He had a horrible feeling it was going to end up a choice between his godson and Lily’s son, and frankly he’d be happy to save that fucking nightmare for his future self to deal with.

about the gossip probably should’ve at least made a passing comment if they’d noticed it.

Again, the tall boy realized he’d been caught and shrugged once, seemingly graceful and unperturbed although Harry was quick enough to note that it was in fact rather forced.
Given that Nott was on the clear other side of the group almost as soon as she’d appeared, Harry figured it was best not to find out. He seemed relatively fine with Dean, but Dean could bicker like Blaise could and he certainly didn’t have Hermione’s very straightforward personality.

But still. He had no idea if Cedric were the type of guy to write poetry but Hannah sure thought he was through her rose-tinted glasses, so Harry’s mental image of this William fellow was getting odder by the second.
Which, okay
Draco was suspicious, and Harry knew he was suspicious because he was making no efforts at all to hide his body language or the incredulousness on his face. “Harry
“I’ll have to catch up with her anyway, to touch base on the potions regimen you’ll need. In fact,” She plopped down on the chair again, pulling out a note pad from her bag and a self-inking quill apparently as she scribbled something out. “Turel!”
It was certainly a grim thought, but one he’d first recognized and developed very early into his first year at Hogwarts when he was more actively focused on infiltrating the Slytherin table. He could read the writing on the wall—he wasn’t an idiot who thought that anything he’d done with the Slytherins so far would’ve been possible if the Dark Lord, AKA his blatant enemy, was still around

Draco sat beside him and passed him notes basically the whole class, both taking notes because that seemed to be the proper, academic thing to do and never let it be said the Slytherins weren’t good students even if only in appearance. Harry caught several of them taking notes but also multitasking in writing to each other, while other houses were less subtle and half the Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs weren’t taking notes at all.
Even Draco had been hard pressed to get around defending Snape for that one, and had settled for mulishly admitting Harry was right for studying it so hard in preparation.
He just wasn’t sure if he’d actually be able to do it in what felt like so little time, but he

“I will give it better consideration next time,” He deflected her demand instead, and she shot him a filthy look.
But in a good way, Harry hoped, as he left him to stew that over for this meal and instead let Blaise drag him over to where Draco and Nott were already sitting.
He wouldn’t be so paranoid if it weren’t all just so reasonable. All of that
That was another point in favor of specializing—if he thought it was good for trades then he’d underestimated how much Slytherins liked information. It had turned out even better than he’d hoped if he’d got an invite directly into the snake den itself within a year and change of starting Hogwarts after a centuries-long house feud. This was awesome!
He tossed his hands up exasperated. “You

For Harry though? If the Dursleys didn’t do their obligation as his guardians and no one else filed the paperwork instead, there was no reason that a newly rented single-room apartment in Contrair Alley would need to have underage magic warding incorporated into the documentation of it all. Without anyone pointing it out, the new lease wouldn't be suspicious at all.

the upper hand for against the Headmaster in the future, but if he’d learned anything from Blaise it was that there was never a moment when he should waste an opportunity to mislead someone.

“Well that works out better than I could’ve ever hoped it would.” He admitted with a grin, the twins snicker.
The other three tables in the hall were loud and chatty as ever, no one realizing the Slytherin table had fallen pretty unusually quiet all of a sudden as they whispered amongst themselves almost in sync for when he walked past them. Treacherous things, here and there, and as Daphne actually snickered a couple dark comments lowly for only Harry and Draco to hear around her, he found he actually really enjoyed this when
He considered it a second before shrugging again. “Fine, carry on.”

Harry had not really had a Christmas himself, but he was well aware of the concept. He’d seen the movies they played in school, he got caught up in the holiday spirit like the whole world did even if the Dursleys themselves never really brought it into their home themselves.

But something inside of her was also ice cold. She knew, or rather she had learned in time, that you could not save everyone and everyone was but a child who did not understand why the world caused them pain. She could not save most of Slytherin from their parents, she could not save people like Remus Lupin whose illness was as incurable as it was excruciating, she could not save everyone on a battlefield of a thousand dying men and women and children—but she

Luckily, peer pressure worked better on Gryffindors than most others so when most of their underclassmen got over it within a week, the upper years started keeping their suddenly less-popular opinions to themselves in turn. They still talked about it amongst themselves though which Harry was sure was only deepening their negative stances on the matter with people who agreed with them. There was suddenly a distinct lack of warmth in his own house though that was hard to miss, which was… weird. Gryffindor was supposed to be the warm house with their cozy common room and boisterously friendly people. When a decent chunk of a previously extremely loud, bustling common area was very noticeably

Lucius would admit that he’d entirely been expecting a James Potter clone. Lily Evans was a talented witch but a muggleborn still and he’d never given her much thought aside form avoiding her legendary temper, which she thankfully only directed at people her own year or below—Lucius and Narcissa being upper years and barely sharing their Hogwarts years with her, she was forgettable.

“Vernon, get inside!” He glanced and Petunia was on the back patio with her curlers in and still sporting her nightdress, a pale and disturbed looking Dudley hiding in the kitchen behind her at the scene they were making. His aunt looked drawn and her eyes were darting around nervously, clearly worried about who was hearing all of this.
He flinched and crouched down to curl in on himself when Dudley screamed.

“I’m not available Mr. Weasley so I think we’re done. Maybe go find an open partner?” Harry cut in before it got any more heated. Class was about to start and he
“Are you alright!?” The woman was still yelling, and several people were clustering now, either to half heartedly help or just gawk at the ridiculous scene he must’ve just put on.
He brushed that off and went in search of a compartment, easily finding one a little ways down. Once there he happily tossed his bag down and started shedding layers—he couldn’t wear his new clothes in front of the Dursleys after all so he had one of Dudley’s oversized monstrosities overtop his new outfit, kicking off the old sneakers with haste and digging out his new teal shoes from his bag. Embarrassingly enough he’d planned his outfit out three days ago in excitement for his this grand adventure he was going on: it was a long-sleeved teal shirt that he pushed up his forearms a bit, almost matching his shoes and the front emblazoned with a yellow and pink outline of a bunny boxing a duck. It was coupled with a pair of very light grey jeans with pink patches over the knees.
“Oh, it definitely will.” Harry sighed, picking up his bag to put his books back, causing Blaise some surprise.
WEASLEY, AM I PERFECTLY CLEAR!? WHAT THE BLOODY HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU TWO!? WE'RE ALL YEAR MATES SO GET OVER YOUR OWN DAMN SELVES BEFORE I LOSE MY MARBLES ON THE BOTH OF YOU AND TRUST ME I DON'T NEED MAGIC TO BEAT YOUR IDIOTIC ASSES."

At this point though… Draco still didn’t know.
The woman blinked and did a double take to the can in her hand. “Eh? Oh no this one had freckles! Ha, that’s what I get for grabbing one at random.” She rolled her eyes and popped the lid back on. “I only kinda know what muggle make up is like but my roommate says she only uses it as a base and does other stuff the muggle way still. But this way it’ll match you better—I think the kind you have on is a little too dark for you honey.”

Harry was pretty good at blocking out whispers. The neighbors on private drive had never actually spoken to him personally, but instead everything they’d known about him had come through Petunia’s waspish rumors and Vernon’s grumbling complaints about their delinquent nephew, so Harry assumed they’d believed the absolute worst about him. He’d seen the cross streets to avoid him and lock their car doors if they saw him out gardening, so he knew it was bad.

"For having no information to go off of he has a decent account of what happened, you know." The blond pointed out and Blaise shot him a sour look for ruining his fun.
His cynical side was already preparing himself mentally to put up his masks for the Dursleys when this inevitably turned out to be a very poor joke and the little hope that had blossomed in his chest was squashed out entirely. He couldn’t just

him to continue to live with his ‘legal guardians’ if he went through the goblins to buy some property if he didn’t already have one somewhere and ward the living hell out of it from all intruders, even ministry officials. He knew enough from Draco and the other Slytherins that money fixed a lot of issues with the Ministry of Magic so he could probably afford to work around any legal issues that might cause. So, if he were expelled he’d definitely be free of the Dursleys permanently which would be a wonderful thing all around, actually. And he knew there were other magical schools out there, he could probably attend there if he didn’t want to just pay private tutors to teach him enough to pass his OWLs and NEWTs, which was technically the only requirement one needed.
Dean complained while Seamus burst out laughing—and even Neville had to bite his lip to keep from chuckling. Dean had unfortunately fallen asleep in their first charms class this week and gotten a rude awakening when Seamus had inadvertently blown up the twig they’d been practicing on.

“Magically both you and Mr. Lupin share ownership. It’s a unique property as it can’t exactly just be gifted away; the original creator of it ensured only someone with the Potter bloodline would be able to access most of it and the associated enchantments ensuring that have not been undone despite what laws have or have not been put in place since the property was established. There was the magical inheritance done when it was willed to Mr. Lupin that is magically binding, however that does not remove the pre-existing magical inheritance claim you also have to it simply be being born to James Potter. The ministry could legally of course request Gringotts to undo said enchantments on the both of you, but they have not yet paid that fee.”
