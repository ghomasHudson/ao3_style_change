“I liked that one more than the others,” Draco said finally, as the lights came back on around them.
“Lucky.” Pansy considered him, her eyes so keen that Harry could believe she’d be a great Auror, just as easily as he’d believed she could turn him over to Voldemort. “Living with your enemy, lucky.”
The next day Harry Apparated to Grimmauld before sunrise and insisted on accompanying Hermione to a breakfast that he also had to insist on. He steeled himself with love for her and nodded through an hour’s nervous rambling about Arithmancy, before picking up another pair of coffees to go and Apparating back to the Manor, hands full. He left a warming charm on one cup in the kitchen and dropped some food for the koi before opening the huge front doors to let the birds out, following them onto the lawn with his own cooling cup in hand.
killed for being magical, and when you have to memorize your entire family tree, they don’t feel very far back.” He swallowed, and Harry looked for traces of the Malfoy he knew on an unfamiliar face.
He wriggled down on his belly, tugging the trousers further as he did, until Draco was kicking them off, Harry shifting to let him and helping yank them over one bony ankle. They had one moment of muffled laughter and a shared grin, their eyes meeting in a shock of intimacy, and then Harry kept his eyes locked on Draco’s as he swallowed his dick back down. The new angle allowed him to choke it all down, and he fought a smirk as he saw Draco’s eyes widen, then flutter shut.
Harry didn’t answer. His eyes were glued to Draco, whose face had lit up with the happiest expression that Harry had ever seen on him, barring the times he’d been doing something especially horrible in school. He was laughing, grinning, crying a little, holding Pansy to his body like a precious gift.
It was nice. He didn’t feel that weird loneliness he had on his birthday, seeing evidence of his friends moving in and moving on. It only made him miss Draco, which irritated him, since he’d just seen the fucker, and he redoubled his efforts in following the conversation. They’d moved to the kitchen counter, which was just as packed, and just as  homey.
“Well.” Draco shrugged, and a look Harry had only seen on him a few glorious times before bloomed pink. It was embarrassment.
Harry reached for Draco’s mug, and Draco actually handed it to him, tapping it with his wand to reheat the contents before he turned back to the screen. They finished watching the movie in silence — well, Draco did, barring his occasional chuckle. Harry mostly watched Draco, warm in the contentedness that he felt here, watching old films and watching Draco watch them too. Sharing tea, the sofa, and the home itself. He could almost imagine that the circumstances were different, that this was his life, with no extra complications.
“Just getting bladdered,” Harry assured him under his breath, while the others bravely pretended not to hear. They were Hermione, Hannah, Neville, and Seamus, so Harry didn’t mind. Everyone was bound to think he’d be upset about Ginny, and he knew better than to protest too much. He didn’t see Ginny and Dean anywhere, or Luna for that matter, but they were probably just in the kitchen.
Draco hesitated, but followed him, glancing at each building they passed as though he’d recognize Grimmauld in the next one. “Mum used to take me. We’d Floo in and stay overnight sometimes, I think especially if they’d been fighting. Is there still an awful old portrait that yells at you?”
“I think it was worth it,” he said finally, deciding for the deceased Malfoys. “You’re here, aren’t you?”
It was nice, for a moment, to be back on the same page, and Harry felt a pang when Draco redid his hair once it was over.
It was too late to change his mind, either way. Neville and Luna and Parvati and Padma and Lav and Anthony and Susan and Hannah and Mandy Brocklehurst were suddenly there, loading up the kitchen and putting down beers on the Transfigured furniture.
“There are a lot of old films we should watch,” Harry agreed. “And we can come back for the next classic they show.”
“It was my birthday a week ago,” he said next, cracking an egg into a bowl. If it was weird for Draco to see Harry more comfortable in his kitchen than he was, he didn’t say anything. Instead he snorted.
He was leaving a trail behind him now, pillows tossed to the floor, chairs knocked over as he searched under desks. Somewhere, there had to be some proof
The bell jingled behind him again on the way out, but this time it unsettled him. The world was cruel, he knew that, but it did truly seem like no one cared about Malfoy being alive. Except him — only no, did Harry actually
Finally, arms stacked with goods, Harry left the damp air of the shed. Enormous topiaries dwarfed the walk up the main drive, manicured English lawn perfectly green underneath. Around the front entrance were more small shrubs, each trimmed into a fussy M. Harry dumped his armload and set to work.
“It’s not up to you what’s “just” anything.” Draco’s fear was back, recognizable even through the brown of his transfigured eyes. “I’m not ready. We haven’t even talked about it. She doesn’t even know, right? You’ve been hiding me from everyone, that has to be for a reason.”
Harry was running the bath, hot and fragrant with the potions and lotions he unearthed in a cabinet that seemed too elaborate to sit beside a toilet, when Draco found him. Two plates, a wine opener, and a trotting footstool followed behind him, crowding in the doorway behind Draco’s ankles when he paused. “Round two already?”
“I’m sure,” Draco said, but didn’t follow that with anything about the barbarism of muggles, to Harry’s relief. Instead he said “Is a Hutt a kind of flobberworm?”
“I’m terrified,” Draco repeated, swinging his head up to look Harry in the eye. It was hard to hold his gaze. He looked like a wild animal, like the frenzied dragon that Harry had faced down in Fourth Year, wanting to defend something it didn’t understand. “To go out there? How can I even prove myself when there’s nothing good to prove about me? I was supposed to be a villain for the rest of my life, and now… but I have to do
“Wow,” Harry said, pulling a face at himself just to hear Draco laugh again before he darked it to the same middle brown as Draco. “Well, no one will recognize us now.”
It also started rearranging the house. He lost a bathroom, and then a cupboard. He wasn’t sure about the sitting room, as there seemed to be four or five, but one day he went upstairs and had lost the master bedroom. He thought maybe the house was making room for him — it had, after all, provided a microwave one morning, although it seemed dubiously made, and had buttons with gilded cauldrons and other mysterious settings. One filled the kitchen with a fragrant smoke, one Transfigured anything inside into popcorn, and one didn’t seem to do anything - until he tasted the meal he’d made and discovered that it tasted exactly like a Big Mac.
He didn’t respond immediately, feeling rather like some fluttering creature had landed in an impeachable delicacy, like one move would scare him away for good. He half-believed he was still sleeping, so impossible did the touch of Draco’s fingertips feel.
“You will be okay, won’t you?” Hermione was saying, clutching her endless bag, now filled with sunscreen and her childhood photos. “Harry?”
They assembled a heaping pile of biscuits and crisps, with an even mix of newspapers and celebrity magazines on top. Harry hadn’t thought to bring a backpack, so he hefted the bag over one shoulder, not wanting to lighten it magically if it would make Draco worry.
“I’ll stay here,” he said, and they nodded, and Hermione kissed his cheek, and Harry promised to meet them at next Friday’s Weasley dinner if he didn’t see them sooner.
“I actually believe that now,” Draco conceded. He stuck his hands in his pockets and stared up at the mansion. Harry could see his thoughts, the attempt to pin memories on the shapes of different towers and windows.
“No, no.” Hermione waggled a carton at him. “I’ll just sleep for twelve hours, and then tomorrow I have an appointment with Professor Vector. I owled her to ask if it was too late to change my Arithmancer’s Thesis from last year if I were to retake the class, because I have a lot of new ideas after what we did with the Horcruxes, and I think if I were to - Don’t look at me like that, I wasn’t going to
“We’re… near my house. It’s not in a magical neighborhood,” Harry rushed to assure him, when Draco narrowed his eyes. “I thought I’d just show you the normal muggle stuff I do. We can go to Sainsbury’s.”
They were Levitating half-sealed boxes over to the fireplace, Floo standing ready. Hermione was fussing over a check-list Spellotaped to a second pile of boxes, these ones neatly labelled. They’d propped all the windows of the drawing room open, but Grimmauld was still muggy and hot from the July heat. Harry wasn’t going to miss it.
“So he’s a werewolf with a Time-Turner?” he asked finally. “And he’s flirting with his own mother instead of undoing his Bite?”
“I can’t!” Harry smacked the counter so hard his hand felt like it become one instantaneous bruise. “I can’t, but it’s not what I want anymore, and that’s all I know. That’s all I
“It’s a little more complicated than that,” Hermione interjected, though she saved them from explaining how.
The Floos were close. People were closer. Harry reached for Draco’s hand, and Draco — without looking over — let him take it.
“At least you’re a sexy savior,” he retorted, folding one side of the paper down so Harry could see its cover.
It was quiet in here too, but there were some signs that Draco had been in the room before Harry invaded his space again. There was a glass of wine on the desk, unempty, and a blanket nest askew on the bed. The closet door was missing, a blank expanse on the wall where it once had been.
“I almost was Slytherin,” Harry volunteered, after they’d sat in peace for a moment, taking in the mess. “The Hat wasn’t sure.”
Hairy tidied up in slow motion, afraid of what he was going to face now that they were left alone. If it were anyone but Draco, he would anticipate them leaving the house entirely, but there was nowhere Draco would go but further in. He undid the wards on the stairs and braced himself before climbing them, a thousand excuses and apologies running through his mind, though none of them seemed like a good enough place to start.
Hermione sighed. “It’s the property. He’s the last Malfoy now, right? So if no one can find him, no one will be able to claim ownership of the house. It’s a whole thing, ownership of magical homes are tied to blood if no sale is made. Actually, Harry…” she fixed him with a suddenly-keen look. “You’re the closest Black heir.”
“It’s not my bird,” Harry said automatically, more sourly than he’d intended, and Draco looked surprised, hurt. Harry wondered if Draco had stood up to reach for him, if he was now ruining everything. His mouth ran on without him. “You’re getting your house back now, right? So you won’t need me here soon.”
Draco bit his lip and looked down, and Harry closed the step between them before he could think better of it. He reached out, sliding his hand over Draco’s jaw, and as Draco looked back up Harry kissed him again. This kiss was slower and less frantic, a determined sort of statement that Harry tried to put everything into.
“Why doesn’t anyone Floo call anymore?” Ron asked, sounding pained. “Those little tellyphones don’t even fit in my hand.”
It was wide as a bed and unbelievably comfortable, blankets and pillows crushed and tangled beneath their knees as they faced each other. The journey from the front door hadn’t been a long one, but Harry had lost some of his nerve at the hallway’s rich wooden threshold.
“It fucking should be.” She kissed him again, and this time he felt the good-bye in it. “Ron and them, they might not get it. But you do, I think.”
She’d been taking clay classes and fighting with her father. Harry hoped being out from under the same roof would give them some helpful distance.
been a while since he’d seen his friends. Hermione was right to have worried, he realized, as she always was. He’d sealed himself off with Draco Malfoy and summer was ending and everyone was going to go on to the next thing. Everyone
“Yeah, otherwise you’ll just lock me out of here. How do I know I won’t just go run all your errands and be locked out afterward?”
Draco’s head snapped up so quickly that he caught Harry in a surprising wash of eye contact. An instant of intimacy, of understanding, and then it was over.
“Mate?” Ron said now, starting to peer around at the papers, which had flicked back into The Guardian as a woman passed by. “What is it?”
He led Draco to the Screen on the Green, a janky old movie theater that belched the scent of stale popcorn onto the street every time someone stepped in under its neon sign. He tried his best to explain film crews and California on the way, but Draco didn’t understand two out of three nouns, and he point blank refused to accept that film cameras weren’t just magical photo cameras.
It was cramped and uncomfortable and over quick. Harry barely got his hand around himself before coming, Draco’s hand’s preoccupied with gripping and pulling and holding, holding him.
“But would I?” Ron mused, and grinned when Harry elbowed him. “I could come over there to fly, I suppose. Or we could just go to the Burrow, I know it’s your space or whatever.”
“No one said that,” Draco said cagily, looking behind him as though Harry was talking to some other blond git. “I was merely suggesting, since you’re so determined not to leave my home, that you could get us something to fix this buggering headache before the peacocks start going off.”
She fanned out a row of pamphlets on her desk, pointing to each one with her quill. “Estate tax. Local Statue of Secrecy restrictions. A map of the property and grounds. It’s rather expansive, Mr. Potter, but I assure you that the gardening and security charms are self-maintaining. It’s not quite turnkey, but…” her professionalism fumbled for a the first time and she trailed off. He couldn’t help the thought that came: Bellatrix, Nagini, dungeons full of his friends.
“You are no such thing. You’re a pedigreed, powerful wizard, with mastery of multiple historic estates, and you could be Minister in ten years if you would bother to go to Auror training.”
“They don’t notice that?” Draco shook his head. A few people were passing by, no one giving a second glance to the mansion that had appeared out of nowhere. “It’s like they’re blind or something.”
“That was amazing,” Harry offered, instead of saying any of his thoughts out loud, and he was delighted to see Draco blush again, extra delighted to see him cover for it with a mean little sniff.
Ron was biting his lip, running through some spells. He tapped each wall in turn, waiting until the orange light he was conjuring turned green. Finally he turned to Harry and shook his head.
“Because it’s what you wanted, you berk. I was following your lead.” Harry felt himself being plunged back into another argument with Draco’s fear, another unwinnable battle against the self-defenses that had kept Draco hidden away and alive.
“She hates everyone equally,” Draco assured him. It was strange again, how much they had in common, how non-strange it felt. They swapped a few more Grimmauld stories, and Harry found himself wondering aloud at how to fix each separate horror. Sure, the portraits were bitter and the spiders had taken over the attic, but after Malfoy Manor Harry was starting to think that it wouldn’t be such a hard fix, after all.
“I’m so sorry,” he said, resting his forehead under Draco’s chin to take them all in. Draco rested his cheek on top of his head, after a moment, and Harry felt him relax as Harry’s arms went around him. “I could have killed you.”
“So you did.” Hermione sent all of Ron’s things flying back into his drawers and Levitated his suitcase onto the dresser to await further clothes-sending. Then she dipped into her bedside table and pulled out a pack of cigarettes.
“What did you think?” Harry asked finally. He was afraid to voice the question, but he kept worrying the unfinished sentence in his mind like a toothache.
“Is that how you’re going to talk me into things from now on?” Draco shook his head at his own reflection. “I won’t allow it.”
After he’d worked up a sweat flying, he’d pop back in through the owlery window and freshen up. The house still wouldn’t take a warming spell properly, so he’d run the shower as hot as he could. From there he’d wander the house casting little spells so the house would recognize his magic, usually just turning lights on and off as he explored. Each day had lead to its own adventure: genealogy books that contained photos of Harry’s great-great-grandparents at a party, a singing teakettle that was eager to tell Harry about a king it had served, a burn mark in the wood that resisted any but the most Muggle of repair attempts. The portraits hadn’t woken up yet, but Harry felt like he and the Manor were getting to know each other, maybe trust each other. It made him understand the Malfoys a little better, too, like he understood more of what they felt they had been defending, at least on a personal level.
He hadn’t really expected Draco to be waiting at the end of the hallway, but he checked all of the rooms anyway, and then went into Draco’s little blue bedroom.
He liked all of it, really. He was surprised, but maybe he shouldn’t have been. He’d never spent time alone like this, save a few weeks at the Leaky Cauldron the year he’d blown up his Aunt Marge. He liked setting his own hours, eating his own meals, hearing his own thoughts. He liked the Manor, now that he’d been there long enough to think of it as having two distinct identities. It was a benign, beautiful place, and it was a place where horrible things had happened. He thought maybe horrible things happened at all kinds of places, and it wasn’t the fault of the stone and the grass.
“I’m done with that, by the way,” Harry interrupted, trying to sound stern. He clenched down on his thigh muscles, taking control of his body back so he could listen properly.
Ron looked over his shoulder, and apparently seeing that Hermione was gone, turned back to Harry and lowered his voice. “Are you going mad over there? I would. Luna was saying you need to check for hinkypunks, she reckons they might try to kill you on the grounds sometime.”
Hermione and Hannah were chatting in low voices at the kitchen table while Harry made tea. He Levitated the tray back and waited for everyone to prepare their mugs before he took Hermione’s hand under the table. She squeezed tight and leaned against Ron, who mumbled something about piskies.
beautiful, he could admit that his brain was right about that, at least. In his sleep he looked peaceful and perfect, nothing like the difficult and infuriating person he would become again in the morning. The spoilt and vicious Draco who got under Harry’s skin, who understood Harry’s darker impulses, who missed his mother. It was too much to process, and that was without considering the black Dark Mark that was etched on his outstretched arm.
“Dial it down, please, Ron.” Hermione pushed off the wall and went to him, pulling Ron’s long, freckled fingers out of an angry gesture and into her own hands. “This must have been a hard decision for Harry, to make him change his mind.”
“You’re so slow,” Draco complained. He had opened the window and now stood in the breeze that had wafted inside, preparing to hop out. His hair hadn’t been trimmed in months but was free from gel: Harry wondered briefly if it wouldn’t get in his eyes.
It felt like what he needed. Draco felt like what he needed, ribs and teeth and fingertips. So he kissed him again. Draco’s lips were a soft press of sweetness, opening in a slip of cool sparks that was a slow motion revelation. Their bodies bumped and pressed and aligned in a delicate hardness that sent shivers through Harry’s scalp and spine and teeth alike. Every twist of air and fate brought their hips together, the friction buffeting them ever upward toward the light of every chandelier above. It was erotic in the most painful way, burning through Harry so fiercely that he wasn’t sure if he would come or burst into light.
Hermione answered the door still wearing her pyjamas, a piped lavender set that sent her hazel eyes sparkling. “Harry! You alright?”
Through it all, Draco was silent, obedient. He seemed to have faded under the realisation of his fear, and he didn’t say a word as Harry signed his life away, checking Draco back out from the ministry like a particularly dangerous library book.
It was hard to find a rhythm, but he didn’t need much. Fucking Draco Malfoy was overwhelming even in the short, shallow thrusts that he could manage around the grip he had Draco’s dick in, jerking it as slowly as he rocked back and forth. Draco went up on his elbows to watch, and Harry couldn’t help but steal a kiss, though he bent in half to take it, and Draco bit down painfully on his lip when he did.
“We’re not handing out detentions, man. See if there’s enough evidence for a trial. Act as though you need justification to detain a boy.”
Draco turned around and furrowed his brow at Harry, who had fallen several paces behind. “Pixies,” he repeated. “Pixies are boring. That’s like saying I would show you the horklumps. Pixies, Potter, honestly. Come on.”
“You don’t know that,” Harry lied, ashamed to think that it had once been true. “Why aren’t you asking him, anyway? He’s supposed to be your friend.”
Draco nibbled at him again, experimental this time, and Harry threw caution to the wind in his haste and his need, damn near launching himself forward to chase Draco’s lips and teeth down into the pillows, propping himself up over Draco’s body, aligning them closer than they’d been during their violent fight just days before.
“You didn’t go off with them? FIll out a job application? As if you’d have to keep going past your name.” Draco shoved the pile viciously to the side. There were linen trousers wrinkling underneath everything: he checked them, too, before adding them to the pile. “There. I can live off of that for a year. I can’t sell Mother’s gowns, of course, but maybe some costume jewelry.”
The two of them were crammed into the Transfigured greenhouse room that made up half of Neville’s small flat (located, exactly halfway, between St Mungo’s and his grandmother’s). Neville’s hair had gotten even longer, and hers had seen a trim, so they both sported identical ponytails when he arrived. Somehow Neville had crammed a chef’s dream garden beside a bed of Herbology saplings beside a small grow op and what looked like a still for beer, all packed into what was ostensibly a one-bedroom. The expansion charm was a bit buggy, turning walls invisible at random, but Harry politely pretended not to notice how Neville’s bedroom suddenly resembled a couple’s room, with Luna’s hats scattered across every surface.
“Okay there, champ?” Ron was asking. He tipped his head down toward Harry’s, checking his eyes like a mother hen. Harry suppressed the smile that Ron always brought out in him — Ron’s urge to check Harry’s forehead like Molly would was evident. “You smoke anything, snort anything?”
“I think he’s always been the way he seems now, a bit scared and a bit mean but very smart and... quite determined.”
“Oh, no, I actually died,” Harry corrected, feeling embarrassed for some reason. The people who knew had treated him like some kind of reborn superhero, and he didn’t know what he’d do if Malfoy reacted the same way. He felt like telling the truth here, though.
Draco leaned back, just a hitch, slight enough that Harry doubted he’d done it on purpose. “Or you put me under Imperius, since you’re so good at it.”
They were his friends, but different. It was the same, only not at all. And yet Harry felt a fierce rush of joy to see them, all alive, all surviving. It was incredible to be together still, drinking and shouting and dancing to Sirius’ stash of old punk albums, wands stored safely away until it was time to keep the ice from melting in their cocktails.
“I don’t trust it, I guess, and I’m taking it out on him. And we’re both on edge not knowing what’s going to happen. I don’t know, it’s probably stupid. Everything will be okay now, right? He’s different.”
“Can I?” he asked, though his mouth was already there, but it took Draco’s jagged nod for Harry to give his dick a long, determined swipe of the tongue, following with his hand to twist the spit around and hold tight, to pop the head into his cheek with a showy swallow. He sucked down and his hand moved where he couldn’t reach, a synchronized determination setting in to tease, to touch, and to take him apart.
“Are you going to look at me or are you going to fuck me?” Harry demanded, blustering through feelings that felt too big the way he always did.
“Whatever you want,” Harry assured him, his chest seizing with something he’d never known before. “You name it.”
“Did you jump?” Harry was getting excited in that way that only flying opened up in his chest. Anticipation, adrenaline, that pure childhood joy of discovering another dimension. Draco drew backwards in the air, showing off while giving him room.
It worked— Ron dipped his chin to look back at Harry. The angle made him look ridiculous. “Sleep, mate?” he said incredulously, over the top of Hermione’s
“I cast Imperius to break into Gringotts. And I Crucified someone during the battle,” he tried first, testing the waters. Draco gave him a sharp sideways glance, but didn’t answer. “Carrow.”
“It looks…  different,” Hermione said, sounding surprised and a little relieved. She spun in a slow circle, dropping Harry’s hand to do so. Ginny still had hold of his other one, and they were still holding hands when Dean and Ron stepped through the fireplace.
They’d touched down in the small clearing that Harry favored, around the back of the manor by the conservatory and a Victorian stone bench. The pond he’d moved the koi from looked inviting in the warmth of the day, an oval of cool water surrounded by long, sweet grass.
“I love you too,” she insisted, and gave his shoulders a shake. Her face was bright and clear and beautiful, her hair a wash of flame. “Listen to me. I’ve loved you my whole life and I always will. But we weren’t supposed to be that way. Only one person can have been possessed by the Dark Lord in a healthy relationship.”
He caught up halfway up the second landing, knocking Draco’s slim shoulder aside to pass. They scrambled together through the door of the Quidditch room. Draco tried to shove Harry sideways into the doorframe. Harry stumbled, then dove after him, grasping for Draco’s Firebolt a second after Draco plucked it off the wall. Harry barked out a breath that was half-laugh and found an old Nimbus, its lines familiar under his hand.
do, Hermione corrected. “We have a good plan, we just have to adapt it when we know more. It will be okay, Harry, it will.”
“War breeds orphans,” Hermione said darkly, when he mentioned it. Ron looked at her in alarm, but tipped back his beer without a word. They’d waited ten days after the final battle to truly believe it was over, twenty before they felt brave enough to go into the Leaky. Of course well-wishers had overwhelmed them there, so now they sat in a Muggle bar, three weeks of peace behind them and a whole lot of unknowns ahead.
Draco settled into Harry’s lap like a warm, perfect weight, and then his movement reminded Harry of everything else there was to do in a bath, besides compare their scars. He skimmed his hands down Draco’s long, jutting spine, back up his stark ribs and down again to the soft skin of his arse, which luckily was still plump and soft, though perhaps smaller than usual. “I’m going to fatten you back up,” Harry murmured, gripping the area in question, and Draco laughed while squirming.
“Thank you,” Hermiome said softly. “I’m sorry you lost your parents.” Ron cast a sideways look at her, and then nodded reluctantly.
“Oh,” he realized, when Draco crossed his arms over his chest and looked away, clearly gathering his breath before he could face Harry again, “Oh, Draco.”
It was sloppy and shallow and not wholly comfortable, but Harry felt more like he’d woken up from a years-long fog with every second. He was totally present in a way he hadn’t been since he had to focus or die — here, on the overstuffed sofa, daylight barely making it past the heavy curtains and the koi swimming under the rug.
“Here you are,” Harry agreed, his face red, and turned to Draco. “I need all of you to trust each other. That’s the only way this is going to work.”
“I’m not?” Dream-Draco seemed surprised. He looked down at himself, chin tucking down, and Harry realized he was naked. His body was blue-tinged alabaster, the hair on it shockingly dark against his skin. His veins showed starkly under his skin, and a path of scars was spread over his chest, glowing dimly underneath the water. His hands and penis were floating upward, nearly breaking the surface, and Harry looked away, filled with a half-woken shame that surprised him.
It was Draco’s ghost, it had to be. The presence he felt in the house, the voice he’d heard. The moving rooms, the missing wand. Draco was still here, in some invisible way, and Harry wasn’t going to let the last remains of him disappear forever. He wanted to protect him, whatever was left.
Draco frowned, clearly surprised. His troubled expression doubled, and for a moment Harry regretted bringing it up. He hated to make Draco think of it, a day marked by nothing special, alone with no family but the portraits, half-hidden in his own home. “Yes,” Draco said reluctantly, and he shifted, putting some space between them again. “Why do you mention it?”
Not Malfoy. He’d never felt less like the Malfoy Harry had known, although he’d come to see that name in a whole new way. The ancient, noble historians and potioneers who lined the walls were worlds apart from the petty, standing-obsessed Malfoys he had known. The boy he was starting to...something. Like? He didn’t think it was worth denying anymore, really. He’d grown to like Draco, as a friend, as a person. As more. Even now, with the dull despair that had been building when he thought about what was coming after this summer, getting up to hang out with Draco made it all feel okay. At least for now.
“Are there more?” Harry asked, instead of rising to the bait, and searched the ground around him. All the grass just looked like grass.
“Now, that’s not true,” the Minister said sternly. “But the point in question is his motivations. Fortunately for your roommate, Dumbledore and I once spoke about him at length, and I have some testimony from his mother-“
He shifted, carefully trying to angle himself up and out of the bed so that he could clean up. The statues had fallen asleep in front of the fire, and he gave them a wide berth on the way to the door.
Draco climbed in with him, one long step of one long leg that brought him down into the bubbles beside him. Harry pulled him into his lap, letting Draco’s legs untangle around him underwater. It should have been strange, to touch so much all of a sudden, but it wasn’t. It felt like the dam had broken, and Harry no longer had to steal a mug or start a fight to get his hands on Draco, something he now realized he’d been itching to do for longer than he knew, for more reasons than he’d ever understood.
“Harry’s right, he needs to go,” Hermione chimed in, looking up from her list. “A week should do it, though. And then he’ll be right back, Ron. Just in time for his birthday party.”
Over the weekend he had been distracted, too angry with Draco to regret the decision to punish him. Worried about h him since he’d given up the Aurors, Ron had kept Harry busy with a steady stream of snack foods and Quidditch drills and sending owls for the party. Ginny had agreed at once to the idea, and she and Dean arrived at Grimmauld early with a box full of red and gold streamers.
Ron squeezed a little harder, acknowledging what Harry was implying. How Ron could finally shine, free from Harry’s name and influence. It was Ron who should be Head Auror some day, Ron who loved the chase and the capture, who had the girl and the family to balance a job that could swallow someone like Harry up. It was amazing that Ron even wanted Harry around to distract people from that, from how incredible he had always been.
The guilt disappeared when they got to the dungeons. Harry would rather clean a thousand bedrooms than be left with these grim reminders of the War. Each one had been scrubbed clean, which was somehow just as awful as finding something. All that remained was a heavy, horrible feeling.
here, in a way even Hogwarts was too practical to be. Hogwarts functioned as a school, where the Manor functioned as a seat of wealth and blooded power. Harry felt right there, more in tune with that strange magical part of himself. No one could grow up here without knowing they were a wizard - unlike Little Whinging.
“What do you mean?” Ron asked trying for innocent, just as Hermione’s face hovered into view, robes in place but her hair even bushier than usual.
“What the hell is a Spalva? And more to the point, if I leave this house to run your errands, you and this house will probably vanish into the ether.”
“Only if you mean it,” Ron said, severe now. He was a stickler for the truth, Ron, and bound to it now besides as an Auror-in-training. Harry knew he’d spent the morning in paperwork, and would spend the next six months learning the job. “I suppose you know I’m sworn to the Aurors, and I believe I can help you there, but I have to know that sticking up for you won’t backfire on me.”
?” Pansy shook her head. “It’s only been a couple of months, he never even— he’s always been excessively obsessed with you, I just thought it was only him and that he’d get over it once he sorted himself and came out but…
Harry went to the Weasley’s every morning after that, where he and Hermione would sit with Ron in the kitchen and whisper to each other. Ron was trying to keep his spirits up, but every day that went by, it seemed more and more wrong to have the Burrow feel so gloomy and empty. George was returning from St. Mungo’s soon, and Molly’s nervous energy seemed everpresent.
“Thanks,” he said, a little dubious. He was afraid to open the box, like it would be waking up a piece of the dead to use Draco’s wand. But if he started doubting Hermione now, he’d have to shift his entire worldview.
, you know? I never thought much about who you’d end up with, if not Ginny. Hopefully someone who doesn’t make you think of the war, and how could Malfoy be anything but facing that shit constantly? It just seems intense, I guess, and too potentially explosive. I can see where you two have some weird parallels, but then, so do we, right? And we’re not dating, no offense.”
Harry was grateful for the wide, squashy sofa that he’d replaced the stuffier leather couches with as soon as he and Draco sank into them.
“I just don’t understand how someone could try to kill themselves,” Hermione confessed, as she and Harry tidied up that evening. They’d cleaned the bathroom and patched the wall that Ron had taken his pain out on. Apparently the books weren’t a part of the drama Harry had missed - as the only one of them who had made up her mind to positively go back to Hogwarts for another year, Hermione was merely beginning her two-month slow-burning crisis of which books to pack.
Ron sighed and leaned his head against Harry’s chest, though Harry was shorter than the both of them. He met Hermione’s eyes over Ron’s messy red hair.
Neville thought a moment, scratching his chin. His baby fat had all melted away by now, and the beginnings of a beard gathered at his throat. “I don’t love it for you, obviously,” he said reluctantly. “I hate to go against you, bud, but it’s
He thought about it, weighing the words that sounded mostly complimentary against a lifetime of petty bullying and not-so-petty villainy. “Determined to do what?”
“It’s getting quite late,” she said, peering solemnly around at everyone. “Shall we have a toast for Dean and Ginny?”
Harry‘s lip quirked up. “What else do you and Ron say when you talk about me?” he asked, curious about the answer even if he didn’t have much faith in getting a real one. “Poor old Harry, he’s gone funny at the manor and is having a trauma-based gay crisis?”
“For fuck’s sake,” Draco said weakly, and Harry nearly choked trying to smile. It was like being given the keys to a kingdom, and he was greedy for every inch of it. Draco’s nose was wrinkled up tight, and he didn’t protest when Harry moved back for air, stretching his hand across the inside of Draco’s thigh, to grip it and nudge it aside.
“I’m not sorry for everything,” he mumbled, not sure and not really caring if Draco could hear him anymore. “I don’t regret— I mean, I shouldn’t have kissed you either, but I wouldn’t take it back.” Harry pulled the sheets up toward his now-burning face, unsure how they would ever have this conversation in the light of day. “I hope that’s okay.”
Harry had changed into some other older clothes, things that hadn’t made it to the Manor by virtue of being more formal or less favored. A black pair of trousers that were slightly tight now, a t-shirt that wasn’t one of Dudley’s hand-me-downs. He put on one of Mrs. Weasley’s more minimalist creations, a loose-knit emerald jumper the same shade as his eyes in daylight, and his stupid brain wondered if Draco would like it. What, from the walls? Draco would probably burn the whole place down with everyone inside once he realized his home had been invaded.
Soon, they could eat their sandwiches, sit tangled in fading bubbles and look out the enchanted window at the peacocks squabble and play. Soon Harry would tell Draco that his secret was out, that Ron and Hermione knew and were prepared to help. Soon, they would have the world open to them, and these days of being hidden away would feel precious in retrospect. But now there was just skin, warm and wet and new for discovering. Now there were kisses that felt like entire universes, Draco’s cautious yet growing in demand. Now Harry could grab and touch and
He tried not to blink as Pansy studied him. “I don’t understand,” she said finally. “But you’re right, we both want the same thing. So.” She stuck her hand out, clearly reluctantly, and when he took it she barely squeezed before turning to go. “Tell Draco I’ll be back after work.”
They ate the pork pies standing up in the kitchen, Draco dripping grease over the newspapers he spread across the table. Harry skimmed them for a while, equal parts amused and offended by the public perception of his last years’ reality. Draco lingered over a spread about his father, a few recent pieces about the reparations to Hogwarts, and found a full-page spread of photos of Harry, published when he’d been in hiding.
Harry Apparated to the front gate, feeling like a walk after a night of abusing his poor body. From the iron arcs of the entrance, the place was vast and beautiful, twinkling like a jewelry box set up on a hill.
Another thump sounded, and Harry whirled on it. It sounded like something in the wall, and he relaxed slightly, letting his shoulders down a bit and breathing out. It was probably just vermin, sneaking in through the worn-down maintenance spells from the home’s months of sitting empty. There had been mice sometimes, in his cupboard growing up. A place like this probably had hundreds.
“Could you not point your wand at me so I don’t kill you by accident?” he griped, finally giving in and sitting down. And even though he’d taken down the Dark Lord, Hermione rolled her eyes.
Draco couldn’t choke back the sound he made    when Harry licked into him, and it didn’t sound like a protest. Harry tried again, curling his tongue like a question, and Draco’s body answered in the positive. Harry glanced up to see that the rest of Draco’s face had screwed up, his face gone pink from porcelain.
Dean, to his credit or perhaps as a measure of Harry’s immateriality, didn’t react. He just whistled, following in  Hermione’s circular rotation. “Damn, this is a big house.”
“I have my own sins,” Draco admitted, cautious now but seemingly intrigued. “Could I apologize for those?”
There had been a split second, just before Draco popped into nothingness, that Harry had felt something shift. It was a long way from kissing him back, but it wasn’t nothing. It might have been everything, if he’d chased Draco back instead of nursing his own anger in his oldest sweatpants.
The next morning he sat with a mug of tea and a blanket and stared out over the grounds. It was a good place to go crazy, he thought. Betty the peacock slept at his feet while the sun rose.
“The same ones, actually.” Draco peered at him now, and Harry became conscious of the sweat on his forehead and at his underarms from their flight. He pressed his arms closer into himself. “They live a while.”
It was worth it. In place of the monogrammed, contained shrubbery he’d planted flowers. Lilies on one side. Narcissus on the other.
Ron went back to training the next day with a new plan, though none of them had total faith in all of its elements. Draco had latched onto Pansy’s name like a drowning man, clearly trusting her over Ron, but Ron insisted that, even if they could trust her, the Ministry still didn’t— some of the comments he’d been getting about Harry involved digs like “
Harry put significantly less effort into the jeans and jumper he slid on after a shower, but he did try to calm his hair before heading downstairs.
“I can’t leave being protective of Draco alone, not when I just got him back,” she insisted. Their voices had become less intense, somehow, but no less direct. “I’m all he has now.”
Quickly, Harry pulled his hands away, trying to school his face into something stern and competent. Hermione took his hand and hustled him toward the elevators. He hadn’t been to see Ron at work yet, not wanting to give the department ideas about him joining, and also unwilling to spend more time here than absolutely necessary. The cold marble and the bustling ministry workers around them made him even more anxious as they passed through. He didn’t know how Ron could stand to come here every day, but maybe he had memories of visiting his dad at work that had nothing to do with Harry’s memories of desperate plans and endless trials.
“Of course there are, this is an alder grove.” Draco gestured to the trees as if they meant something. “Wand wood. Really good for non-verbal spells.”
It was a light, quick brush of lips, but Harry was left smiling when Draco drew away, and Draco had started to look less anxious.
“Oi.” Harry pinched him, and Draco turned, so they were crowded into each other’s space, the air buzzing the way it always had before they launched into a fight. “Why did I tell you all my war crimes?”
The fire had died down, and the projector was sending white light out onto the wall before them, no movies playing through the night now that Draco was watching with him. They’d entered into a secret friendship, a strange intimacy that only now was Harry assessing with wide-open eyes. It must have been that shared link that tangled itself up in Harry’s brain and sent him confusing signals. It couldn’t mean anything.
“No, I just… it just seems like they expect me. And I’m sick of doing what’s expected.” He stared into her steady brown eyes, hopeless to say more. But Hermione just kissed his cheek, gave it a pat, and nodded.
This early in the morning, the Manor felt the most innocent, its bushes hanging lower with dew as bees nosed along their flowers. The sunlight was weak but greatly appreciated, and Harry lifted his face to it as he walked down the main path to the gardens. He was surprised to see movement behind a basil plant, Malfoy becoming more visible after a moment, low to the ground. He was wearing his nice clothes again, despite the dirt he was now kneeling in, and it felt strangely right to see him in pressed trousers and a button-down, incongruous though it was to the greenhouse behind him.
And the water poured and poured. Harry sobbed for breath, falling a little against the stone stairwell as the floods finally reached his knees. He felt drained suddenly, too exhausted to stop the upward-swelling flow. It tickled his toes, his calves. He sat down on the step and waited for it to take him.
Harry shut his eyes again, comfortable in the white noise of their familiar arguments. His nose still hurt: he knew it was a phantom pain, but it was easier to focus on than the hurt in his chest. Even now Draco was likely licking his wounds, shutting off walls, dumping Harry’s things into the lawn to be shat on by Betty White and Garuda.
“Can’t fuck ghosts,” he murmured to himself, fiddling with the box. It popped open, and the wand dropped onto the floor, rolling until it was stopped by the cast-iron, House Elf-sized fireplace tools. It was thin and long, made of hawthorn. He thought maybe it had unicorn hair or something, which seemed a little strange, thinking of Draco as an innocent. He was maybe more innocent than Harry had thought as a kid, though. Or at least a little less culpable.
“Potter was living in the manor,” Savage said. “He’s just as suspect as Parksinson, and that means everyone needs investigation. All of them need to go.”
Harry walked into Grimmauld and knew something was wrong. The wards Lupin and Molly had set up so long ago pinged to announce his arrival, but no one popped up to greet him, and no one was making any noise on the first floor. It wasn’t a good kind of silence. By now he’d learned the difference.
Why didn’t Harry know more war idioms? He was truly starting to feel left out. He stood up to shake her hand. “Thanks, Legalwizard Shafiq.”
“Panicked,” Draco shrugged, not meeting his eyes. “I grabbed them in the dark, then didn’t know how to put yours back. I didn’t know you could do wandless magic.”
No sooner did the thought of how nice and cool it looked cross Harry’s mind before Draco was slipping his shoes off, hopping from one foot to another to unearth his shockingly pale feet. He stuffed his socks into the shoes before leaning down, cuffing his pants in a few practiced motions. “Fancy a dip?”
“I love you, too,” she said, because it was obvious. “I just worry about sending you back to rattle around in that place alone. Good thing it’s only a few more days.”
It swung open, to his surprise, a seam in the wainscoting reaching upward to split the wallpaper in two, and Hermione disappeared inside, the blue and gold toile folding seamlessly shut behind her as her muffled voice joined Draco’s.
“Thanks so much,” Draco cooed, his voice flinty with false gratitude. “I’m so glad you’re here to fuck with my house and talk to the Aurors for me.”
Thanks for bearing with me during my writer's block! I have a much clearer vision to the end now, which shouldn't take much longer. Love you all!
Harry passed the bottle and watched him drink, the long, cool plane of his neck stretching and swallowing. Somewhere around fifth year girls had started giggling at the sight of him, and at the time Harry had been furious that they saw Malfoy as rich and handsome and bitingly clever, instead of seeing the evil bastard he had believed Malfoy to be. Even after he’d grown accustomed to recognizing male beauty alongside female, grown used to the butterflies Oliver Wood and Charlie Weasley could spring on him, the fact of Malfoy’s perfect face had continued to bother him. It had seemed unfair that someone so awful hadn’t looked as bad as he was, hadn’t worn his dark soul on his face the way Voldemort did. But Malfoy was paler now and too-thin, and all Harry could do was blame the evil of others. In a luxurious manse that was packed with antiques and art, Draco had always been the most precious object inside.
He followed her to the new home theater, relaxing a little when her face lit up. “This is brilliant,” she said, and began hunting through his films. He’d expected her to have more of a reaction, but maybe he should have known not to expect anything predictable from her.
“After all we’ve been through, this is the day you finally crack,” Harry grumbled, and popped the window open. Cool air climbed in, bringing sounds of the street with it.
He must have made it out with Narcissa. Somewhere between their desperate flight, her capture, and her sentencing, Draco had escaped. He was probably in some Parisian apartment now, planning lavish funerals that no one would go to. Considering what Narcissa had done for Harry, what Draco had done in pretending not to recognize him, Harry didn’t even begrudge him his freedom. Not after losing his parents.
“I’ll let you know what I decide.” Harry tried to sound firm, but there was a bottomless pit of doubt behind his words. Summer was ending and he had to decide his future, at least for the next year. What had happened to the time? He’d spent it all coaxing Draco out of the walls and watching old films, and he’d let that distract him from everything that had felt important beforehand. Now all he wanted to do was chase the Aurors away so he could eat scones and fly with Draco. The weight of responsibilities he’d had his whole life had finally waned a little, now that he didn’t have to be a live-in servant or a student or a warrior or a sacrificial pawn. He didn’t know if he wanted to carry that weight any more, if it was selfish not to. He certainly didn’t have an answer for Savage and Williamson right then. They were still looking at him, waiting, and Harry sighed. “I’ll talk to Ron about it today. I’m was just about to head over there.”
“Yes, very good, now shut up,” Draco hissed. Their feet were touching, and the heat between them gave away how long Draco had been under the same blankets.
Draco sighed and kissed him back slowly, and the brush of their foreheads together made Harry want to cry. It felt like a culmination, no matter how many fights were in their future. He let his hand slide down from Draco’s cheek to his neck, and then pulled back, letting them both breathe.
“It’s really Ginny?” Hermione was whispering, and she glanced over Harry’s shoulder at Ron, who was bustling about the ancient hob, directing heat with his wand. “Are you sure there isn’t a Horcrux in the Manor or something?”
It was strange to trust and be trusted by Draco Malfoy, but it was even stranger to be out at Diagon Alley again, among real people. He was swarmed almost immediately upon entering, but luckily Florian Fortescue was standing outside his shop, and put his sonorous voice to Harry’s advantage, scolding the first few people who tried to jump up and shake Harry’s hand. After that he was going to Disillusion himself, but Dean and Padma were emerging from Flourish & Blott’s, and he let them talk him into some hair of the dog.
“Don’t you want me to? You’ve said you don’t want to be reliant on me, and you never asked me to move in. We haven’t even been dating long enough to live together.” The word
Draco glanced away, but when he looked back again, the calm seemed to have stuck. “I want my family back. I want to go back to the time when I was just a spoiled kid and Voldemort was some story my dad told when he was drunk. Barring that? I want my home back, so it can stay with a Malfoy. I want the wizarding world back, shopping on Diagon and eating Elvish bread and using my own wand without someone covering for me. But that takes money and acceptance. I’m dead right now.”
“I’m not surprised,” he drawled, voice thick again, and Harry didn’t stop to think about what he wasn’t saying.
Draco settled, acting reluctant, but the wiggle that he made to align their bodies better gave him away. They fit together like a quill and its inkwell, and Harry ran his hand up and down Draco’s arm, again and again until Draco was relaxed against him.
The bed was a curtainless four-poster, four wooden posts carved into griffins that framed a surprisingly inviting pile of white-and-grey sheets. One of the griffins yawned and turned its head to look at Harry. He stroked its knotted head, and it blinked sleepily.
can’t wait,” Harry threw back. “You said you needed me to stay, but you don’t anymore. You get to be a Malfoy again, and be with all your real friends, not just whoever moves into your house.”
Draco whooped as the chunks rained down the side of the house, leaving a cloud of dust and a pile of rubble that sent the peacocks running across the lawn. “Finally! Oh, I hated that thing. It always said I flew like a ponce.”
“I look un-Malfoy or good?” Draco’s strange face relaxed a bit with a new opportunity to mock Harry. “Those are mutually exclusive. Shall we do you?”
She nodded, locking solemn eyes on him that he could never see without remembering the chill of the Chamber and the pumping of poison through his veins. And then they left, too, and only Ron and Hermione remained.
Draco lifted his head, and then when he recognized Harry, his hand. Harry nodded back, waiting to speak until he’d come up to the garden’s gate. The shed was to his left, the house behind him, and Malfoy had filled a basket with aromatic greens.
“Not really.” Draco scratched his wrist. Harry had turned his hair into a mess, and it sat at all angles, looser and longer than Harry had ever seen it. “I feel better than I did before you came. Eating better. Now I know the world hasn’t exploded out there. But this is as far as I can go, isn’t it? It’s all reliant on you now. You feed me, you bring me pain potions—”
Wordlessly, Draco did. Harry followed him for a block or so, back past the liquor store, back to the bus stops and metro stations of High Street. It was hard to keep up with Draco now, and he could tell from the sinking in his stomach that he’d pushed Draco too close to discovery, that their day had just been ended.
“For Merlin’s sake, I’m not going to be an Auror.” Harry wondered at his day. So far he’d had three versions of the same conversation, each one going worse than the last. “Didn’t you hear me telling them off?”
Harry hesitated. He hadn’t expected to be handed an excuse. Ron didn’t understand the way his and Ginny’s love had devolved into something strong yet familial. He was tempted to take the excuse, even if Hermione wouldn’t fully buy it, but of course it wasn’t Ginny. Not with his dreams of Draco gnawing at him. Guilt rang through his body at the thought of keeping anything from Ron and Hermione, but he wasn’t about to tell them about a wet dream any time soon.
Draco nodded once, then again, more decisively. “Okay.” He still looked fearful, but determined, and Harry wondered how many childhood rules he was breaking by agreeing. “Okay, let’s go.”
Harry went into the kitchen, carefully not watching Draco until he could sense the other boy behind him. He opened the fridge, the cabinet, the pantry, setting things out one by one.
“Yeah,” he agreed, although a part of him was starting to become attached to the Manor, in some perverse way. With his hangover looming a few hours away, he was almost looking forward to returning to its luxuriant, empty silence.
They Apparated to the top of the manor at sunset to eat and to drink. Draco had pulled another bottle of wine from his secret hiding spot, and he opened it with a lazy pass of his wand.
He hated lying to them. It was antithetical to how he loved, lived, had survived. He had chased them away this summer, physically and emotionally both. It was past time to let them back in. Them, instead of
“Did you get any gifts, Harry?” Hannah asked, blowing on her tea and looking at him. He never would have predicted that a Hufflepuff would hold her liquor so well, but then, she had fought fiercely with Dumbledore’s Army after her mother’s death. Maybe he didn’t know her as well as he’d thought. Maybe everyone else had been busy growing up while he’d been camping and bargaining his soul.
“I know, but.” Draco pulled his knees up, hugging them and setting the point of his chin into his arms. “Now I’m just leaning on you. And for some reason you seem to like it, but you were right. We have to leave the manor. Do things. Be people.”
?” Hermione had gone pale. He didn’t blame her. Hearing a scream here didn’t do much to support his “it’s not evil” theory.
been his own. He wanted to tell them about the aching fear he’d been feeling lately, whenever he thought about signing up to center the rest of his adult life around combat and curses. But he didn’t know how to say it.
“Alright, be careful,” Ron advised unhelpfully, and stood to go. “And if you come, put a shirt on. Gin’ll get the wrong idea.”
“So my life goal is childish?” Ron was going from red to puce. “What happened? You can’t just hide in the Manor forever, we’ve barely gotten you out of it! Are you going back to Hogwarts with Hermione then? Are you going to burn down Grimmauld? Do you hate Quidditch? Who even are you?”
It felt too honest to say, but then, they were in the dark. Draco was quiet for a moment, then cleared his throat and said the last thing Harry would have expected. “I talked to Luna.”
, floating in a dreamworld, beside his in a nest of pillows. He’d have to tell Ron and Hermione something. But he didn’t know where to start.
on and they ate in silence. He glanced over every so often, gauging Draco’s reaction to the movie. He wanted to talk more, to ask a hundred questions, but he was afraid of sending Draco back into the walls. He’d just come back from the dead — questions could wait.
They picked their way down the main path, packed gravel crunching below them, tinged with a blue iridescence. Pixies added further light, flitting from bush to bush in search of spiderwebs for weaving. Beyond them, the topiaries creaked slightly in the dark as the swans swayed and the horses shifted mid-rest. Everything was so ostentatiously
“Oh, you can burn someone off a family tapestry, but you can’t undo blood rights,” Ron asserted, seemingly pleased to know something. “Let us know if you get the house, yeah? We can burn the fucker down.”
Harry bit back his instinctive retort. It had occurred to him, somewhere around when Draco’s voice had hitched on “tomb,” that this was what panic looked like on him. Maybe it always had been — maybe the worse Malfoy had been as a kid, the more stress he had been under from Daddy Death. It almost put the heights of dickery that he’d reached in sixth year into perspective. “I got caught up.”
Harry scrubbed his hands over his face. “No. No, I don’t want that either. I mean, thank you, but I don’t want to make you guys share that place. And Grimmauld will be fine, and I love Quidditch. I love you both. I just need more time to decide what to do next. I’m not going to make some huge decision about my life in the next week.”
So, I owe you all an apology/explanation! I am LOVING all of the thoughtful comments on this fic, and I apologize for the short and inconsistent updates. I lost one of my parents over the holidays, and it's been hard to focus on any of my hobbies. It does bring me so much joy to write and share this story, though, so I'm not giving up. :) I really appreciate everyone's patience, please do keep reading and commenting!
“This place knows me,” Harry said again, wearily. “The Manor doesn’t.” He’d barely been able to get through the front door, even after the bloodletting and the wand ceremony and a hundred more signatures. Its magic buffeted him gently back, not attacking, but not submitting either. Hermione and Zara had both, separately, recommend he spend more time there. But no one had thought he’d make a go of living in the abandoned Malfoy Manor.
“That’s not what I meant,” she insisted. Only Hermione could corner him, alone together in a house full of people, finding the moment of silence in an all-night rager. Only she could gift him books and ask if his heart’s desire had been fulfilled.
Ron sighed and kicked back. “I caught him out by Grimmauld, leaving the cinema. I tried to call Pansy, but she was here with Savage and Williamson. It’s been fighting ever since.”
After a quick pint, he walked the pair down to Gringotts as they finished regaling him with stories of the parties he’d missed. Apparently Alicia Spinnet was pregnant, and Seamus had started seeing a Muggle, and Ginny had been accepted into a writing apprenticeship in Brooklyn. The last one threw him. It seemed like something he should have heard from Ginny, should have known she was considering, but it
The door burst open, nearly hitting Harry in the shoulder. Draco smirked when Harry jumped back, but turned to let him in the room. Harry followed him over to the cupboard, where Draco had piled everything onto the carpet. “What are you doing?”
“Sorry! I thought you would block me, fuck.” Draco came closer, touching Harry’s face, and Harry turned his chin away before the other boy saw anything in his eyes… or noticed the beginnings of the erection that was threatening to make itself noticeable. “Are you okay?”
He told her about Mrs. Weasley’s new attempt at summer knittings, the light sweater wrapped in cooling charms. Hermione dug out Hagrid’s rock cakes for Hannah to try as well, laughing at the look on her face. “Dip it in your tea,” she advised, letting hers sink to the bottom of her mug to soak.
“I know.” Draco sighed up at the ceiling, and then focused — first on Ron’s face, then Hermione’s. “I am sorry. I am. I won’t make excuses for my family or for the pressure I was under — I did and said terrible things, and I never did more than wish it was otherwise. I ought to have gone to Dumbledore, or run away. I thought I was keeping my family safe, but…” he shrugged, the rest not needing to be said. He’d gone along with every awful thing that was asked of him, only to lose his family anyhow. “I was a coward. Still am, hiding here. I didn’t know what to do and I’m sorry.”
it open, the grain in the wood shifting into permanent new pattern as it let him in, Hermione slipping right inside beside him.
“It looks a lot different,” Hermione admitted cautiously, peering around in a much more fearful way than Luna had. Ron had his arm firmly around her, but he tipped his head at Harry, inviting him into a three-way hug. He squeezed them both and let go. “Did you make the downstairs smaller?”
Neville had returned to Hogwarts for his final year alongside Hermione, and he was talking about how Sprout’s expectations were weighing on him. Everyone had assumed he’d train in Herbology — even Harry had, at the back of his mind. Now Neville thought he wanted to go to culinary school, or work on a Muggle farm for a while. Maybe even, and here he seemed incredulous of himself, look into Potions.
Harry turned hot and red and angry, turning uselessly away to leave them their moment. He hated himself for being jealous, but he was, the morning’s peace stolen away from him in another cramp of anxiety. He was happy for Draco, and couldn’t imagine being kept away from Hermione, but it had meant everything to him, being Draco’s confidant
“Potions?” Harry asked, gesturing with his chin at the spiralled plant Draco was plucking leaves off of now.
He’d ordered movies too, every film he’d never been able to see as a kid now a sleek VHS, and when he began building the cheap bookshelf he’d gotten to store them in, the dining room table fell to pieces behind him. Harry was a little confused until the wood started twitching, clearly wanting to be used in the place of fibreboard. After that it seemed like the Manor knew what he wanted, and by dinnertime Harry was curled up with a bowl of penne alla vodka, watching The Goonies.
“It is.” Draco rapped on the floor that bordered the runner they sat on. A fish came up to his knuckles, hopefully brushing along the underside of the glass.
“If you don’t get fired.” Harry pulled out the container of chicken and dumplings, which was blessedly full under its stasis charm.
He thanked Ron and Hermione, releasing them back to whatever unthinkable things they’d been up  to. God knew they deserved it, even if Harry wasn’t getting laid.
“What, get all the way in?” Harry peered into the water, surprisingly tempted. Only the thought of stripping down in front of Draco in broad daylight stopped him, the strange frisson between them unable to bear the weight of shirts shaken loose, of trousers slipping down.
“I’m not leaving.” Harry argued, rolling his eyes. “You may be bound to the Manor by blood but it’s mine legally now. If I leave, you’ll get Unplotted, and you’ll have to haunt a house in some magic black hole somewhere.”
Harry stepped back, startled. Draco rolled his eyes and stepped in again, more carefully this time. “Here.” He stuck out his hand, and after a moment, Harry took it.
Harry shrugged. Ron seemed torn between concern and laughter, but the tense moment seemed to have passed. Hermione sagged a little, then pressed a quick kiss against Harry’s cheek. “You know we love you,” she grumbled, as Ron took her arm to Apparate away.
“Are you sure? Muggles won’t know you.” But Harry was already pulling his wand out. He was half-convinced that Draco would back out still, and he didn’t want to give him an excuse to start spiraling. “Want to look like me?”
Cooking together — or teaching Malfoy indirectly to cook — was one thing, but waiting around for dinner to cook was another. Harry cleared his throat and went for the tea, needing something else to do with his hands.
Hermione emerged, stiff-backed but smiling, to the smell of the madras curry Harry was making. It had gotten too spicy, so he was tipping more yoghurt into the pan, and he barely registered her in the room before she was pressing a hand to his back, her chin to his shoulder. Everyone was taller than him, these days.
It was fascinating, watching the microexpressions changing on Draco’s face. He was so busy trying to read them that he almost stumbled into Draco when he stopped. “Can we sit somewhere?”
The dream hit him and his head snapped to the side. He was terrified that Draco would be awake, watching him, knowing the things that Harry had just been imagining. But he was asleep, eyes closed around some dream of his own. His arm was stretched out across a pillow, reaching toward Harry.
“I wanted to die that whole year anyway,” Draco admitted, and it didn’t come out as flippantly as he had likely intended. “I just wish I hadn’t cried in front of you.”
“Am I-” Draco glared up at Harry. His face was open and pained, and Harry finally saw the fear there. “No, you are.”
“But what about meals?” Ron asked, a little desperately now. “You can’t eat at the same table You-Know-Who—”
Pansy and Savage looked furious. Williamson and Shacklebolt looked calm, as always, with Robards’ face utterly uneasy in contrast. Ron looked grateful to see them.
“Was it a sickness?” he asked, testing his theory since he didn’t know where else to start. All bets were off when it came to the way he normally talked to Malfoy. They were past that somehow. He felt like they were in the middle of a conversation that he’d just realized they were having.
“He protected you too, you know,” Harry pointed out, in a surprising surge of protectiveness for their former professor.
Their kiss deepened slowly, moving from a touch of sleep-chapped lips to a slide and a press and a slip of tongue that buzzed like a live-wire shock. Harry reached out, sliding the arm that wasn’t trapped underneath him over Draco’s jagged ribs, bringing his hand up to cup Draco’s shoulder, the motion curling them tighter like two halves of a magnet. Harry’s blood was singing, burning, and underneath his hand he could feel a rash of goosebumps across Draco’s back. He slid his hand down and up, under the hem of Draco’s soft, thin shirt, spreading his rougher palm across the soft skin at the small of Draco’s back, where each bump let Harry know this was really happening. He tilted his head, and Draco followed, then broke off to breathe, both of them staring at each other too closely to truly take anything in. Without his glasses, everything behind Draco’s face was blurry, but Harry didn’t care to see anything else.
“That’s more like it,” she admonished, and tossed a lump of something from her pile into the flames. Harry snatched it out, dusting off his nearly-clean Weasley sweater. “Give that a Scourgify and we’ll see you about five.”
“I’m worried about you,” Hermione argued from the fireplace, as she spelled a basket of laundry into neat folded piles. “You should be alright now, just try to come out. It would do you some good. I’m sure the Ministry could sort you back out, if anything happens.”
Suddenly it wasn’t funny anymore. Harry could feel his body beginning to react to Draco, the dreams he’d tamped down suddenly faced with the physical reality of Draco’s breath on his arm.
“I was getting to that.” Draco lifted his wand and directed a slow stream of water back into the kettle, avoiding Harry’s eyes now as he spoke. “I have a few errands you could run. At Diagon, you know. Basic potions ingredients and such. And then we can fix up the house some more, if you’d like. We have to compromise on the koi, they don’t need the entire floor. The sitting room would suffice. We can Charm the walls to match, I know a good one. And if you’d like to make some more changes, there’s a gargoyle out back that’s been hassling me since childhood. I can’t unStick it myself but surely your freakish magical ability should extend to stonework.”
Two flights up he heard the water. Part of him sagged with relief and a little embarrassment - he’d just caught them in the bath, of course he had - but it was still hard to shake his awful feeling. He would just check in, he told himself. Knock and say he’d been by and offer to come back later.
He waited a few days to be sure the rooms wouldn’t come back, but finally he seemed to be living in a pared-down, liveable version of the Manor. He felt like he was rattling around in it less aimlessly, at least. Strangely, the house didn’t do anything about the dungeons or the dining room where he’d had so many horrible memories. He started to think he should do something about it, if this was his place now.
That hurt too, and Harry had barely glimpsed the answering regret in Ron’s steady blue eyes before he launched himself upward, catching Ron in an impulsive hug. “I’m sorry, Ron. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t let you go be in danger without me, I should just join—”
It took four hours, twelve signatures, and four more arguments ranging from hallway spats to furious facedowns, three and four at a time. Veritaserum was pulled out, put away, administered — to Draco, Pansy, Harry. Malfoy’s family lawyer was looked for, found in Azkaban, and summarily dismissed. Legalwizard Shafiq was called, and Ron and Pansy and Hermione were sent home. Threats were made and matched. Williamson accused Harry of writing pardons with his dick, Savage and Robards raised their eyebrows, and Harry blew up a desk.
“I don’t think I’ll be caught.” But maybe that wasn’t what Draco meant. “You think they’ll attack us? I didn’t even take out my wand.”
Harry looked up at him, shading his eyes. Draco’s calves were bare, his trousers rolled up past golden-haired calves and hanging off of his narrow hips. His Quidditch shirt was the same he’d worn in school, sparking a hundred memories that felt like they were from another lifetime. And his hair was sweat-tousled, his face that same face that Harry had obsessed over punching a hundred times. He looked amazing, but Harry wasn’t about to say anything.
“There’s no one to tell,” Draco snarled, throwing his hands up. He still had his wand in one hand, and Harry stood up, cautious. “You fucking loon. Just leave before the house decides it’s yours now, and don’t tell anyone I’m here.”
“Have you seen it?” Harry asked, on impulse. He wasn’t sure if solicitors got to tour properties they were handing out to third-cousins, but she seemed to understand what she was saddling him with.
“Don’t smile at me, it’s a manner of speech. Of course you wouldn’t know that. Did you even have any education before Hogwarts, or did Dumbledore have to teach you to wash yourself?”
be taught,” Draco admitted, although it sounded like he was still making fun of Harry. “It’s late, didn’t you eat already?”
“But I’m good at Potions, and something about Snape, and blah blah blah?” Draco glanced at Harry, smiled to himself at whatever he saw, and kept plucking. He dropped each thin ribbon of leaf into his basket, and they twirled through the air before landing. “You can be good at something and not like it, you know. Severus was a good teacher.”
“Houses can’t be evil,” Harry spat, feeling his anger escaping, the monster in his chest unwinding from sleep. “And I’m
Draco didn’t ask what had brought Harry back in a bad mood, and Harry didn’t ask what potions Draco had taken. They just began to play.
“Take your stupid clothes off, Harry Potter” Draco said against his neck, as supercilious as ever. But Harry, driven unreasonable by the pressure of hands and dick and mouth, Vanished them all in one surge of almost-accidental wandless magic. Draco laughed, delighted, and the fire sprung up higher behind them, casting strange shadows on the dark-wooded walls.
“No wonder Voldemort liked it here,” he said out loud. They’d shared a soul and a mind once — hell, Tom Riddle had even stolen away his girlfriend for a year. And if they could have so many big things in common, maybe liking the Manor could be one more little one.
“You think I’m expecting so much,” Harry interrupted, annoyed now at all the begging he was doing. “You think I’ll make you go back to Hogwarts and I’ll go for head Auror and I’ll want to put your photo on front of the
“Perhaps there is some… mutual… unusual behavior,” Draco allowed, and then surprised Harry by tilting inward, pressing a kiss to his mouth. He looked equally surprised afterward, but Harry kissed him again before he could regret it. And then they were just kissing again, slow and lazy, Draco nestled against Harry’s shoulder as though he weren’t slightly taller.
She hadn’t seen them yet, and Harry reached for Draco’s sleeve, tugging them back behind the stoop they stood near. Hermione had blended into the crowd, but now her hair was fully visible, along with her trademark overloaded bookbag. She was sifting through the pages of a book now, bustling along half-reading. The sight of her warmed Harry’s heart, as always, but he turned away, pretending to be preoccupied with the grocery bag as she passed across the street. It felt wrong to ignore her, but their disguises wouldn’t fool someone as smart as her, and he waited for her to disappear into the wards before speaking again.
“Fuck, Malfoy….” Harry sat back up. Draco looked at him, and his face had set back into a mask of cool air. Harry had mourned his parents for years without even knowing them - it had to be infinitely harder and more complicated for Draco. Harry wanted to say that he’d owed Narcissa his life. That he didn’t blame Draco anymore for what he’d done as a kid. That he was sorry he’d said anything. Instead he passed the shopping bag over and asked, “Did you eat dinner?”
She was so much better with people than he was, Harry reflected, watching her laugh from across the room. He was getting sourly drunk, lost between two rejections, and even if hers didn’t sting as much, it would help if Dean wasn’t glowing with love beside her. He wanted that. Even if it could never be so uncomplicated, with the person that he wanted.
“How was your birthday?” Hermione asked, curling back onto Harry’s shoulder. He put his arm around her and nestled his hip against Ron’s sleeping body, enjoying the feeling of being firmly weighed down by his best friends. “Did you get everything you wanted?”
He got Draco started on the dough until he had pulsed together apple, onion, pork, bacon, and spice, then had Draco stir them in a pan while he took over setting the dough in place. “Ramekins,” he muttered to himself as he smoothed the dough out inside, and Malfoy snorted next to him.
, as though it were a better vehicle for Harry’s power than his own wand. It must have been working in harmony with the house.
No one had spoken for a few minutes. The water had stopped at the top stair, and Draco had watched as Harry turned back to the top of the cold, black waters. He closed his eyes, and the floors beneath their feet flickered. He’d turned to Draco, who had handed him his wand. Not Draco’s, Harry’s. Harry just took it without speaking, turned back to his spell.
“Part of me feels like I should be out looking for him,” he tried to tell Ginny later. The other Weasleys had given them space outside, and he was pacing the lawn with her, looking for gnomes. The summer sun was up late, giving them a window of golden light and shadow that felt out of time.
It had felt like seconds as Harry rushed in with Hermione that morning, but now the seconds stretched into eons as they made their way out in silence. Silence between them, anyway. In the enormous marble hall, the whispers were getting louder, irritating Harry and likely overwhelming for Draco, who had spent so long hiding from these very eyes, and been thrust so unwillingly in front of them.
“Hey, do you remember toasting Malfoy at your birthday?” Neville asked, hours later, when they’d smoked most of a joint and gone to dim sum and talked about everything else in the world, all  while Harry steadfastedly ignored the hours ticking. Pansy was almost certainly at the Manor with Draco now, and he didn’t want to think about that. Luna was laying on the couch playing some Muggle video game and eating homemade kimchi out of a jar while Harry and and Neville watched, passing the second half of the joint back and forth. Neville charmed the soil he grew his weed in for a buoyancy that felt light and warm, grown with St. John’s Wort for an uplifting sweetness.
“It’s beautiful,” Harry said without thinking. Beside him, Draco startled. He turned to see Draco studying him, his eyes soft but surprised. “It really is.”
“I want….” He wanted to act, of course. He wanted to change things, he wanted to fix things, he wanted Draco, for Draco to stay hidden for him forever, only his, almost as much as he wanted Draco to be washed by the sun somewhere beautiful and far away and free, whether or not he took Harry with him. “I want my roti a little burnt, can you leave that one in a minute?”
“I wonder if they’d say it was worth it.” Draco didn’t say it, but Harry could tell he wasn’t just talking about Lily and James.
He cleared his throat and turned back once he was redressed, meaning to go back  to Draco’s lap, but Draco was already standing. It was full dark now, the peacocks crying eerily to one another before they settled in for the night. Betty White-slash-Spalva would try to sneak in to sleep in bed again: she had taken the most to the privilege, and liked to exercise it, if a door was open.
“Where is Malfoy, anyway?” Ron was saying now, desperate for a distraction from the dread radiating off of his girlfriend.
“Mmm.” It was tempting, thinking of the Manor burning. Hermione looked far away again, and Ron bent toward her, urging her to drink her beer as though it was medicine and he were Molly Weasley.
Harry hesitated, feeling his resolve to hate Pansy fading away fast. He couldn’t imagine losing Draco already, and he’d only truly known him for a few months. “He couldn’t have reached out to you, he was so scared he almost died here. He would have, if he could, I’m sure. I just… was here. It was lucky.”
“Oh, we’ll need both places, mate.” Ron looked to him with genuine concern. “Don’t worry, we’re not ditching you. Hermione can stay there for class and studying, but I’ll need to be in London for Auror training.”
“Oh.” He didn’t know what Pratt was, but he wasn’t stupid. During the beat of silence that followed, Molly peeked out of the curtains and pulled them shut again. Ginny and Harry both rolled their eyes. “She knows?”
Harry clambered back up to his knees, determined to bury Draco in his stupid cloaks. They scrabbled against each other for another moment, Draco weak but warm, his body long and slight against Harry’s, his hair fisted in Harry’s hand like a handful of golden silk.
A deep, dark humming seemed to turn the grain of the wood floors into crackled, glowing streaks. Upstairs the phonograph turned itself on again, the faraway tune old and jangling and sweet. Harry wasn’t sure how much was him or Draco or some combination, how much was the house itself, but either way he pushed Draco’s shirt up and his trousers down and he went hunting for more freckles to the sound of buzzing, clanging chaos.
her about them! I can keep my mouth shut, you know. I haven’t asked why you’ve been using Draco Malfoy’s wand all day, have I?”
“You’re wrong!” Harry could feel his magic building in his gut, and he fought to hold it down. “We can’t stay there forever. You know we can’t.” He hadn’t wanted to admit it, really, but it felt truer than ever out here in the fresh, free air. He was tired and wanted to go home to the manor, but he wanted to be able to come back, wanted this day to be the start of Draco’s freedom. It was so frustrating to think of the world around them, the world Draco had wanted to know more about all day long, disappearing again.
“That’s right,” Ron jumped in, coming back with three pints held close to his body. “If Malfoy’s dead, that house is yours. Plus you guys are cousins, right?”
Ron was as upset as Harry had ever seen him. His face matched his hair, both flaming red with the anger he was currently directing at Harry. Harry had intended to go over to talk about his hesitance, his doubts and fears. Instead he’d walked into the Burrow, hugged Molly, and announced that he wasn’t joining the Aurors. That’s when the yelling had started.
He felt sick, and overly dramatic, and a little angry with himself. And yet Draco didn’t bring his anxiety to Harry, and Harry left him to it, and the two of them fretted the house full for two long, fraught days.
“Give me a key,” he said suddenly, struck by inspiration. He stuck his hand out, wiggling his fingers at Draco.
“Especially knowing - knowing, mind you, because of Fred - what it would do to Molly,” She shook her curls: they sprang back into indignant coils.
“I’m okay right now. Maybe after Quidditch.” Harry stretched his legs out, pointing his toes and wiggling them before he sent the mug flying back into the kitchen and stood himself.
where he kept them,” Draco mumbled, his voice sluggish, though he perked up a bit when they started laying them out. Runok Ko, wizard’s chess, Snitch Snatcher… Draco touched the boxes with a reverence that spoke to their place in his childhood. It was still hard to imagine the Malfoys as a loving family, but the way that Draco had a favorite color for the chessboard implied volumes.
Making a post-sex sandwich with Draco Malfoy may have been the weirdest experience of Harry’s life, and in his short existence, he’d had more than a few weird experiences.
“So far so good,” Draco allowed. He couldn’t seem to focus on any one thing. He was still acting as if every shadow was dangerous, not that Harry blamed him.
“Of course not,” Hermione answered, exasperation showing around the edges of her voice. “But you can’t lock yourself away forever, people need to know you’re okay. No one’s seen you since your birthday. And this house is still evil, no matter what good you’ve done to it.”
And he wasn’t alone. He’d never been alone in this place, not really, and he wasn’t now. There was Draco, next to him in nebulous nothing. Draco, the long pale insides of his arms like stripes of light around Harry’s waist.
He scraped himself out of the sheets and padded down the hall, where the smell of tea and reheated Weasley leftovers were leaking up the stairs. For a minute, he stood at the door to the drawing room, watching the back of Draco’s head. His bony shoulders rose up from the couch in a thin t-shirt and his long legs were propped up on the table in front of him. He was watching Ferris Bueller’s Day Off with the volume low, and as Harry watched, he laughed quietly at something Matthew Broderick was saying. He didn’t know if Draco’s low volume was coming from his months of isolation, or because he thought Harry was sleeping. Both possibilities made his heart clench.
He didn’t have much to share in response, but it was nice to catch up. He promised to Floo soon before they parted ways, doubling back to the apothecary that Malfoy had mentioned.
?” He thought about his naked tantrum and covered his eyes, pressing the palms of his hands into his eyelids until spots appeared. Then he pulled them away. “Wait, did you seal off half the rooms?”
What did that mean, had the Aurors been to the manor again? Had they come to look for Harry again and found him gone, too busy eating biscuits to protect Draco from the thing that he was most afraid of? “Harry, I have to change.”
“Give that back,” Harry demanded, reaching up into the air above his head. He only succeeded in brushing the floating disc, sending flour snowing down into his wild hair. He swiped for it again, shirt coming up his belly as he reached.
“Hmm.” Hermione worried her lip, looking around. “It doesn’t feel like your magic. Still, you’ve done a lot with it, I’m sure the spells will recognize you when you come back tonight.”
