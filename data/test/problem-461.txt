He rushed to set everything down, turn off the burner and mute the telly, feeling much more composed.
“No worries, Chef. Is everything okay? We’re almost at the end of bruch service if you want to skive off a little early.”
The heat of B.J. against his back, the feeling of his balls slapping against him, the fullness inside, the sensation of two men just taking pleasure from each other. No expectations, no history, no bullshit. Just this. This bliss. Just for now. He moaned. He was pushing back, impaling himself on B.J.’s thick, hard cock.
His lips met Harry's and the world stopped as he breathed him in. Then suddenly Harry was kissing him back,  desperate and hungry. Harry pushed his hands into Draco’s hair and Draco almost cried with longing and relief, it felt like coming home. He moaned into Harry’s mouth and Harry cupped his face, snaking a hand around his waist, pulling him impossibly closer. Harry began to tremble as he whined and tangled his fist in Draco’s shirt. Then he shoved him back violently.
“Pans, you make it sound so easy. It was bad before but now...I mean, when this gets out, and make no mistake it will, people are going to want my head on a spike, and I could even bear that, but…he loved me Pans.” Draco felt like he couldn’t breathe. “I swear, I didn’t know, I thought...I thought I was just there. Just convenient, that he would just move on to the next guy when he chucked me. I didn’t...I mean…why would I think that he…” he buried his face in his hands. “Pans I fucked everything up. I just felt so awful, like I was worthless, and then this bloke asked me if...I just wanted to feel normal. If I’d have known…” he was trying to hold back the tears. Tears were pointless. They wouldn’t bring Harry back.
“Patrick, Harry here is a big fan of football too. Harry was always giving me a hard time about never getting into watching the matches.”
“Well, shall we Harry? I know a great Indian place and I thought I might take you out for a good curry.”
“Ah... delighted my princess,” Draco gave a lordly nod and held out his hand. “I’ll do my best to bring you a victory.”
“Hey Dave! Come on in! Just in time, dinner is almost ready. Here, you can chuck that in the fridge if you like.”
Harry had been right. They hadn’t said anything. But he hadn’t done anything to make it easier for Draco. He was agonised as he watched himself chatting with Dean and Parvati, and turned to see Draco looking very much like he’d rather disappear.
He turned back to B.J. who had an eyebrow quirked at him. Draco smiled and gestured with his head toward the door. B.J.’s smile grew and he nodded. He turned to excuse himself from his friends and Draco set down his glass and walked out the front door.
winking at Draco. He felt the despair. Merlin, this was too much. His head was pounding, but he followed as Draco walked outside.
Harry wiped the tears away and kissed him gently. Draco smiled into the kiss and began to shift his hips, a clear invitation for Harry to move.
Draco sat curled up on his bed trying desperately to read and memorize the Aurors Standard Operating Procedures Manual and failing miserably. He hadn’t slept in days, preffering instead to practice his sparring in the gym until he thought Harry was asleep and dipping into the trainee’s mess for only enough time to grab something handheld and get out. It was leaving him feeling both hungry, and slightly on edge. He looked around and hoped that if he focused hard enough he could reseal Pandora’s box, when his door banged open.
. He finished his wine and poured himself another glass. Now he really needed this bath. He settled himself into the bath and put a warm cloth over his face. Just when he thought he had his life in order. He took a breath and tried to let it all fade away.  As he sank deeper into the water he could almost forget the note on the counter.
Draco tried to curl deeper into the cocoon of blankets and pillows he was swaddled in. They smelled like orange blossom and amber incense; it was comforting. Or it
He nodded. “Yes. Merlin, yes Draco, I’m sure. I want you back if you’ll have me. I’ve fucking missed you. I wanted you every day when you were gone. I tried to make it go away. I was so angry. And what you did hurt me. God, I was gutted. You were everything to me. And when I saw…”—he swallowed—“I thought you didn’t care. But I swear to you Draco, if I’d known what was wrong...I was an idiot. I think we can get it right this time. I want to get it right this time. Please. Can we try?”
“So the kids want to go round to the club again on Saturday. Guess Lee’s finally landed himself that WWN Quidditch-casting gig and they all want to celebrate.” Draco cringed internally. “And I was thinking it might be nice for us to go out and grab a bite together before we meet up with them. I thought I could take you someplace nice.”
“If you don’t stop this right now, I won’t be able to leave and there will be no treacle waffles, Harry Potter.”
Harry was nervous as they walked back to the lanes. People gave Draco curious looks, unsure of who this new person was, but B.J. hopped up immediately, and reached a hand out for Harry’s, shaking it warmly. “Harry! Glad you could join us. You’re a bit late, I was beginning to think you weren’t coming.”
What didn't make sense was that a wireless was commonplace in any wizarding household. Why hide it away? For a second, he panicked; what if it was cursed? He had already touched it! What a foolish way to die! He could see it already. After the initial shock from his untimely demise wore off, he would become a cautionary tale for the children of all death eaters. Warning them to refrain from touching things they knew nothing about. Hardly a fitting legacy for the Malfoy Heir. Years later, perhaps, his Father and Mother might laugh bitterly at it all. Draco had never been able to stop himself from touching things that intrigued him. It was an infantile trait. One that Draco should have outgrown by the age of fifteen— Merlin knows his Father hated it. He could not help but recall his first trip to Borgin and Burkes. For a moment, he could almost feel his Father's cane on his shoulder and his voice in his ear,
anything was hidden underneath. Perhaps it was a forgotten artefact, given to a servant from the last Master of Malfoy Manor- for safekeeping. If it had ever been warded for protection, the charm must have faded away long ago. Taking a deep breath to compose himself, he lifted the floorboard from where it sat to reveal… a wireless.
It didn't take him long to put two and two together- this was a servant's house. From back when the Malfoy's hired wizards and witches to work in the Manor alongside the house-elves. Draco wondered what Malfoy Manor must have been like back then. Busy surely (having been built for a staff of sixty-five). Draco's Grandfather, Abraxas Malfoy, had dismissed all of the staff in the build-up to the war to limit opportunities for spies. Back then, the cottage must have housed a groundskeeper of some sort, and they had taken most of their belongings with them when they were dismissed. It was all in all a very anti-climatic discovery.
Draco broke from his reveries with a shudder, and it became apparent to him that his melodrama was entirely unnecessary; he was alive and unharmed.
He flew out further than he usually did, enjoying the ride and unmatched freedom only flying could provide. After an hour or so, he came to realise just how large the Malfoy estate was. He knew that they owned many acres but never before had he actually explored them. It was strange to think that one day all this would be his. Hundreds of years ago, before Grindelwald or Voldermort, The Malfoys had hosted great hunting parties for their fellow pureblood families- none of the dangerous creatures remained. Still, there were sure to be a few game creatures within the woodland. He came to a halt and squinted.
Draco frowned, underwhelmed at his discovery. It was a dusty old-fashioned thing, a far cry from the gleaming model in the Drawing Room. It made sense, he supposed. No one had lived there for some time; it was probably brand new whenever it was bought by the person who used to reside there. He ran a finger along it, wiping away a line of dust.
. Interestingly enough, however, there was a second fireplace in the bedroom, one that might still be connected to the floo network. That could be useful; a discrete way to leave the estate if he ever needed one.
If he didn't know better, he would have thought his Father was hosting bi-weekly meetings for Potter's Fanclub downstairs.
was among Draco's favourite swearwords. He was above prosaic cussing. Like all things that belonged to a well-bred wizard, his swearwords were bespoke. The phrase
Vaguely, he remembered that muggle radios had been known to pick up on Wizarding Radio stations, but he had never heard of it happening the other way around.
Beneath the trees, Draco felt worlds away from Malfoy Manor. The track was overgrown and went slightly uphill, cast in a strange green light from the trees. Perhaps the path led away from the estate altogether maybe was something at the end of it. Sure enough, after about ten minutes of walking, a ramshackle stone cottage appeared on the top of a hill. Behind the cottage, the land fell away to a steep decline- no trees. Offering an unobscured view of the rolling fields beyond the estate boundaries. Draco was disappointed. Did he really come all this way for a half-ruined cottage? It looked little better than the shrieking shack- less ominous, mind you. It was single-storied, with a dark thatch roof that dipped in the middle, with two diamond-paned windows and a chimney at either end.
The young Malfoy sat up with a sigh; Humiliated. He didn't know what was worse, his dismissal or the pitying look his mother gave him as she followed him out. He wasn't a child. He didn't to be coddled, especially in front of all of his Father's friends. He responded to Mr Goyle in the only way appropriate, with a polite nod and a swift turn on his heel. It was only when the door shut behind them that Narcissa reached for him,
He regretted it the moment he said it; Narcissa's eyes welling with hurt. It must have shown on his face, for she only smiled up at him softly and said,
He turned the dial again. Just to check that he hadn't misheard, and sure enough, the British Broadcasting Company blared through the speakers. Malfoy turned it off just as quickly as before, this time slamming the board back in place, so he didn't have to look at it. He remained frozen for only a moment before he scrambled to his feet, picked up his broom and left.
was of excellent craftsmanship. It had this lovely bite to it, snapping at your ankles like an irritable hound. Offering the perfect catharsis whenever Gryffindor's golden boy stepped out of bounds. It was also more convenient than the distinguished but rather wordy;
It wasn't much. There were two more windows on the back wall and a low archway that lead to what must have been a bedroom. There was little furniture inside either, aside from a cauldron over the fire and a fragile-looking rocking chair.
. The door was unlocked, a breeze swung it open. Almost as if it was inviting Draco inside, He peered in before slowly crossing the threshold.
This, My Friends, was the moment that changed everything; had Draco decided to leave right then (ignoring that loose floorboard), his Great Rebellion would never have come to pass. He would have continued as a doting son, Forever trying to earn the respect and approval of a man who was too blinded by ambition to care about the danger his loyalties invited. He would have played his part in the war to come, like his Father in the war that came before, perhaps one day fathering his own heir- destined to continue the cycle of distant Father and obedient son. Little did he know; that beneath the timber lay the object that would change
— Maybe what? That he could just walk into the meeting as if he belonged? What an idiotic notion. All his efforts to appear mature and presentable were wasted on them.
Draco's hands fisted in his bedsheets. It was maddening! He and Potter were the same age, yet Potter had the privilege of being treated as an adversary while Draco (the Malfoy heir) was regarded as little more than a petulant schoolboy. He had gone out of his way to look older, dressing in his smartest clothes and combing pomade into his hair. He thought that perhaps if he made an effort, put not a foot out of line that maybe, just
Harry just nodded, still confused and retrieved the requested items from the kitchen. "I thought you needed help with the N.E.W.T.s not a guinea pig for new potion" He grumbled warily as he set the glasses and bowl of sugar cubes down on the table in front of Draco.
Draco froze for a second before kissing him back, placing one of his hands on Harry's cheek. Merlin this was perfect, this was exactly what he didn't know he wanted so much. Harry smiled against Draco's lips and moved to sit in his lap.
Harry was looking at something on the desk, what was he looking at? Draco waited but Harry still didn't turn. Suddenly he remembered.
Harry took a step back and shook his head "I can't let myself care about anyone" he said softly "it's not safe" he whispered.
Harry let a sad smile spread across his face as he stared intently at the drinks in front of him "To trust you" he said, Draco fought not to flinch.
Draco rolled his eyes at the behaviour, his mother would be appalled, gentlemen opened the door for a visitor. He opened the door to see Harry sat on a plush dark green love seat in the front room staring into the fire. Draco cleared his throat and took a small step inside
He got up as quickly as possible and hid his face praying to Merlin that Draco couldn't see the blush on Harry's cheeks. An actual blush. Harry hadn't blushed in a decade.
Draco nodded, rubbing his eyes sleepily, a light blush spreading across his cheeks "I'm fine Harry" he said before getting over his moment of shock and plastering his regular scowl on his face "What the bloody hell do you think you're doing breaking into my rooms at this time of night only half dressed" he asked angrily.
He closed the door behind him and slid down the wall "What in Merlin's name am I doing?" he asked himself. He rested his head in his hands and took a few deep breaths before pulling himself together and getting up. He got into the shower and put his not so new newfound fondness for Harry down to the alcohol and the heat of the moment. Deciding that's definitely the reason he climbed into bed and put the night to an end.
She smiled at him "This tastes better, besides there's no way Draco would let me take that from his store cupboard without reason" she explained.
He took a deep breath and shook his head before unlocking his door and making his way into his rooms to begin decorating them. After everything was in its place and Draco was happy with the decor he grabbed his bottle of fire whiskey and made his way next door.
After a few more moments of them standing there like that Harry's tears stopped and he pulled away slightly to look at Draco "I'm afraid" he whispered softly letting that final wall crumble down.
Draco smiled at him and looked down at his own mug of tea, Harry thought he was brilliant. "Thank you" he said quietly. He took a sip and regained his composure "Alright herbology isn't really my speciality but if you'd prefer it to potions I can grab one of my books or something" he began suggesting.
Draco shook his head "No, I don't believe you. I deserve to know why you're pushing me away and telling me it was a mistake because it sure didn't feel like one" he said determined.
Draco stood there frozen, he wanted to go after him but was that really a good idea? He sighed and rubbed his forehead. He knew Harry was going to be freaked out, but it hurt. Draco could swear he saw a hopeful yearning in Harry's eyes but that couldn't be real. It was impossible. But Merlin did Draco want it to be real.
Draco frowned and looked at him with genuine bewilderment "What the bloody hell is a nargle?" he asked.
By the time dinner came around Harry felt ten tonnes lighter, he wasn't in this alone and he was far more prepared than he had been yesterday. Being a professor was much less intimidating when he had a mentor. If you had told him 6 years ago that he would be thinking of Severus Snape as a mentor he would have thought you were insane.
Harry chuckled and nodded in agreement "No matter what this will always be home" he said looking around. At first when he met Luna he didn't believe in these "Nargles" she'd always complain about but through the years of knowing Luna he's found things have gone missing and turned up in the strangest of places and he had to admit he did have some belief that they do exist even if there is little to no evidence.
Minerva smiled wider and turned to Harry "And Harry as well as our new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor I'd like for you to be the head of Gryffindor house" she said. Harry nodded as a way to say he accepted the position but kept quite.
He pulled on a lighter more casual set of robes before making his way out of his rooms. Walking through this school brought back many memories for Draco. He smiled and stopped at the courtyard. He could almost see himself, Blaise and Pansy laughing together under the tree. He made his way into the courtyard and sat on the stone bench, despite the fact that it was late August it was still really warm out even after the sun went down.
Harry nodded "Well I ended up joining him on the bench and I could barely fight my urge to hold his hand, I craved his touch. Luckily I caught myself before I did anything stupid and swiftly left but it was too close. I had no idea what I was doing or feeling and it freaked me out" He explained. His chest tightened a little when he remembered what else happened that night. "In the middle of the night I was woken up by a loud crash coming from Draco's room so my instincts kicked in and I rushed over - wand in hand - when I finally got into his rooms he just stood there looking at me like I was crazy" Harry swallowed hard "Turns out the crash was all in my head, so I could no longer trust my ears as well as my eyes and mind" he said quietly.
“What?” Draco pulled his blanket up above his head and tried to disappear into a fortress of bedding.
Harry looks at himself in the mirror, running fingers through fine blond hair he never in a million years thought he’d get to touch. He gazes into silver-grey eyes and can’t help but smile as he gets to look his fill for once. For the first time in his life he sees a warm, wanting affectionate smile on this gorgeous face and it makes his heart ache.
He ruffled his hair and returned to Harry with an outstretched hand. Harry took it, but he looked as though the touch burned him. “The name’s Benjamin Allman, my friends call my B.J.” He leaned in. “You can call me Benjamin. Don’t you dare hurt him.”
“Muggles don’t have brooms, Draco. Planes are a Muggle invention, they’re big metal vehicles that can fly in the air and carry people and cargo and stuff. You’ve never heard of planes?”
“Oh no? Are you sure?” Draco spat,”I thought “Stalk Malfoy” was your favourite game? Well, sorry to disappoint, but I’m not up to anything this time. I’m just trying to get through training the same as everybody else and—”
Draco reached into his nightstand and fished out a bottle of lube, handing it to Harry and crawling onto the bed on his hands and knees. Harry groaned as he pulled Draco’s cheeks apart and looked at that tight ring of muscle. God, he couldn’t fucking believe this was real. He bent down and licked it in one wet swipe, then he kissed and lapped and worshipped that perfect little hole.
“Okay, that’s enough,” Pansy cut in. She waved down the waiter and ordered another round of mimosas, “Finish that, Draco.” She gestured to his half-finished mimosa. He glared at her but did as she directed.
Harry had nodded and Disapparated. But now he watched Draco lean his head against the wall and pull out a cigarette. As Draco exhaled, the smoke seemed to blow the memory away and time shot forward.
“I know,” said Harry also seeming to take in their proximity, eyes sparkling and suddenly dangerous. He reached out and grabbed Draco by the shirt, pulling him close. “You’re something better.”
She squeezed Draco’s hand. Harry smiled and patted her head fondly. He put his arm around Draco’s waist and smiled that impossibly bright smile again. “Shall we?”
“Sorry, it was just a bit hot in there. I needed a break.” Draco grinned, ”But I’ll tell you what, if you hate the smell so much, when we get back to your flat, we can hop in the shower and you can scrub me clean.”
Harry looked around again. He wasn’t sure where he was exactly. It seemed to be a garden, a rather lovely one. It could have used a bit of maintenance, but it was clearly well-loved. He turned to see an anxious, vaguely nauseated Draco speaking to a house-elf.
“Finally!” Draco says, pushing himself off the wardrobe. “Ok, here. Take this,” he wriggles the signet ring off his finger. “God, you look atrocious. Nobody is going to believe you’re me.”
Draco batted it out of the air with his spoon before it made contact. “Keep it up and you won’t get to see what I made you for dessert,” he said, tossing a grape at Cy, who deftly leaned to his left and caught it with his mouth.
“Look, I’m a great friend. I brought you to your favorite place, got you champagne, let you finish it so you could take the edge off, and ordered you a second so you’d have something to comfort you as I dragged out all the awful details. Now, here’s what we’re going to do.” She took a sip of her champagne and held out a finger ticking them off as she spoke. “We are going to figure out: A, what happened; B, why it happened; and C, what we’re going to do about it.”
Draco bit his lip, he looked as if he was having a war with himself. Finally he nodded and pulled Harry in for another kiss, this one was softer. Kind and slow. Harry relaxed into the Slytherin and kissed him back, humming happily.
Harry hummed in agreement "That it has, thank you" he said genuinely. Draco really was quite incredible when you thought about it.
Harry looked over, his heart ached when he realised what he'd said. He smiled apologetically and instinctively leaned a little closer to the man he'd just hurt "No Draco, you were never a death eater. Nor were you a bad person really. It's a lot to ask because you're a human. Humans are unpredictable and unstable. Trust isn't a natural instinct for a reason" he explained.
It was dangerous to think like that, with no inhibitions who knew what Harry would blurt out. He moved a little closer, somewhat subconsciously, he wanted Draco's undivided attention. When the blonde looked back over he couldn't help but smile "Your eyes are pretty" he said quietly. They were like tiny silver halos in his eyes, he was far more angelic than a human should be allowed to be.
Draco scoffed "Mighty brave of you to subject yourself to more fuel for the Daily Prophet" he sneered.
Harry sighed and sat back as he rode on the Hogwarts Express. He'd soon be back at the school he knew better than any battle ground he'd fought on. He'd only been back once since the war, just after everything had been rebuilt and Hogwarts was back to her original glory. It was almost as if the war had never happened there. Almost.
Harry let a small smile spread over his lips for the first time that day, he wondered if he could catch the Slytherin off guard "That's yet to be decided" he said, revelling in the small amount of shock on Malfoy's face, before disappearing off into his rooms.
"So Harry, are you looking forward to teaching at Hogwarts?" he asked genuinely curious. Harry sipped his whiskey and smiled a little.
Draco hummed softly and looked up at the sky "We all have our reasons Harry" he said softly, though his alone time was brief it was enough to loosen the knots in his muscles.
Harry relaxed slightly and nodded "I'm fine, if that is all I must go over some notes" he said going to shut the door.
Typical, that card always made an appearance when Luna read about Harry's past. Harry made a face and Luna chuckled, giving his hand a squeeze "I don't need to tell you again how you need to stop repressing your problems and acting impulsively to distract yourself" she said.
Draco shook his head and took a step towards him "Why? Tell me why" he demanded, it was his turn to feel angry.
Everything felt so surreal, Draco just nodded weakly. He was expecting to take the fork from Harry but before he could lift a finger the Gryffindor loaded the fork with food and lifted it towards Draco's mouth "Open" he said simply, like this was the most natural thing in the world.
Harry squeezed his eyes shut, every fibre of his being was telling him to shut down, run, get away. But Harry was tired of running, and Luna had never steered him wrong before. "Who?" he asked, voice tight.
The corner of Harry's lips twitched up into a smile as he walked into the room. Draco closed the front door and made his way over to the open kitchenette on the other side of the room. Harry walked straight over to the couch and pulled his wand out of his pocket, lighting the fireplace with a simple flick of his wrist.
Draco didn't bother checking the time or getting changed he shot out of bed, left his rooms and knocked on the door next to his "Harry? Is everything alright?" He asked worried.
Harry hated being called a hero. He hated the title and everything that came with it. All he ever wanted was to be normal and happy and safe. Not the saviour. And the fact that he was only trying to help Draco and he went and acted like a total git actually hurt Harry.
Draco nodded, Harry smirked then, this could be his chance to mess with the Slytherin. Oh how he loved to catch the blonde man off guard "Hell in another world we could have even been lovers" he said bluntly.
Harry hesitated before sitting down next to Draco "That's a lot to ask y'know" he said, pulling his glasses out of his pocket and putting them on. He'd taken them off while he'd been crying but he needed them now.
Oh Harry did not like that one bit. He hummed and leaned towards Draco slightly "So you mean to say you've never thought about it? Never thought about the possibility?" He asked, voice low and cautious. It wasn't a joke and he wanted to watch Draco squirm as he tried to figure out that Harry was being serious.
Finally he caught a glimpse of Harry's face when he slowed and began to fly back down to the ground. Draco found himself walking over to where Harry had landed and was met by a glare.
Harry left his room and Draco leaned against the wall sighing. He hated the hurt look on Harry's face, and he hated even more that he was the cause. He didn't know Harry would be so offended by it and he definitely didn't mean to hurt him.
When Harry saw Draco sat in the courtyard eyes closed and moonlight shining off all the harsh angles of his face Harry was awestruck at how beautiful Draco really was. Admittedly Harry had always thought Draco was an attractive man, as he matured he never lost the angelic glow he has when he smiles. He suspected that's why he got away with whatever he wanted, but he'd never seen Draco like this, completely at peace and serene. He felt incredibly ridiculous that he'd been worried. The war was over, he wasn't an auror anymore, not everything was a threat.
Once they were inside, Luna conjured her cards and a bottle of some home brewed liquor her father made from her rooms. Harry focused on controlling his breathing as Luna fetched some shot glasses. It was a little early for drinking but this particular liquor enhanced Harry's readings.
Harry smirked, Merlin that smile did things to him, and raised an eyebrow at Draco "Charming as always, I told you I'm fine" he lied, putting the empty bottle in the kitchen.
Draco rolled his eyes and sat back "Your stupid, beautiful, intense eyes Potter, I can't stand how they lie to me" he stated.
Draco let out a sound from deep in his throat and wrapped his arms around Harry's waist. Harry pulled away from the kiss just a few millimetres to gasp in some air.
Harry hesitated before nodding and stepping aside so Draco could enter the front room. He walked over to where he was sat and finished the last of the scotch in his glass. "I hope you don't mind, I had a drink or two a moment ago" he said, picking up the empty bottle.
Harry flinched a little and nodded "Yes, but I promise you I was only intending on having the one bottle just to take the edge off. I wasn't going to get drunk... at least that's what I planned" he explained quickly.
He groaned at the sheer act of having to stand up and stumbled over to the front door. He swung it open, somehow still managing to be graceful "Can I help you?" He asked irritated before he realised who was standing in front of him. "Harry" he breathed, the name was both bitter and sweet on his tongue.
Harry nodded in agreement along with everyone else at the table. Minerva smiled and nodded "Good, now I'd like for you all to refer to each other by first names as we are all equil now. Draco as well as our new potions professor I'd like for you to be the head of Slytherin house" she said.
Draco froze in Harry's arms, it almost looked as if there was fear in his eyes "Can you let go of me?" He asked, voice merely a whisper, it didn't sound like he meant it though. No, Harry was imagining that, wishful thinking.
Draco bit his lip, he didn't feel right leaving Harry alone in this state. "Wait, I actually... I need some help with a part of the N.E.W.Ts that I'm having trouble understanding. Would you mind helping me?" he asked, he didn't really need help with any of it but he did need to be here for Harry right now. Even if he didn't know it.
Tears streamed down his face as he kissed the man before him, bittersweet was the only word he could use to describe the scene. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's neck, that was encouraging. Harry wasn't drunk, Harry was sober, he actually wanted this.
Harry looked Draco in the eye and now he could see how raw Harry's pain was "Everyone I love either dies or worse. I'm a curse, a plague, leaving death and destruction in my wake" he said tears streaming down his cheeks "I'm not the saviour, I couldn't save anyone I cared about. Not my parents, not Sirius, not Cedric, or Dumbledore, or Fred, not Dobby, or Lupin, or Tonks. How am I supposed to tell my godson that his parents are dead because of me? I couldn't even save Snape" he said letting out a soft sob "Ron lost his brother, Hermione lost her parents and was tortured. I broke Ginny's heart. So many people have died and lost and been hurt because of me. I can't let that happen again" he said tears streaming down his face in steady rivers at this point.
Harry rolled his eyes, of course, why did he even bother asking. "I know, you know it's Draco" he started, Luna simply nodded "Well first night after dinner, he came to my rooms and offered to share a drink or two" Luna's face scrunched up "If that upsets you, you're not gonna like the next parts of the story" Harry said with an eyebrow raised.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow at him "Once thought? Has your opinion on me changed?" he asked with genuine curiosity
Harry seemed to hesitate for a moment before shaking his head again "It's nothing, I'll see you later Malfoy" he said before hopping back onto his broom and kicking off of the ground, propelling himself into the air and disappearing into the distance.
He sighed and grabbed the bottle of fire whiskey from the other night, this should numb it for the rest of the night. Draco was only really a social drinker and tended to ignore or bury his problems rather than anything else but... he couldn't do that this time. Within an hour he'd drained the rest of the bottle and was sat at his desk. He was writing - somewhat ineligibly - in his journal about the whole situation, as he had been doing since his feelings blossomed all those years ago, when there was a knock on his door.
Harry tore his eyes away and pushed down the worry bubbling up in his chest, leave it be Harry. Once everyone had finished eating, Minerva dismissed us to go get acquainted with our classrooms, Draco dragged his feat as he left the hall, it was like he was on auto-pilot. Harry buried the urge to go after him and walked in silence to his classroom. The quiet of the castle mocked him now, left him with nothing but his conflicting emotions and thoughts. None too soon, Harry reached the doors to his classroom, he took a breath and prepared himself.
He looked back up at Draco and the blonde almost choked. With Harry sat there, hair all over the place, cheeks flushed and lips irresistibly pink and moist. Draco cleared his throat and looked away, taking another sip of his drink.
Draco put his foot in the way and opening the door again "A mistake?" he asked unable to hide the hurt in his voice.
Harry flinched a little and shook his head "I thought I heard a crash. I thought you were in danger" he said softly rubbing his scar out of habit.
Admittedly that was easier said than done. Gryffindors, especially Harry, tended to be very stubborn. Not to mention from the looks of it, Harry had been shutting people and things out for a while now, there was an invisible wall around him that would be hard to knock down. Draco had to try and go about this in true Slytherin fashion, using his cunning wit to manoeuvre his way under Harry's skin.
Draco wiped his eyes "I can't do that Harry. I've wanted this for so long, I can't just let it go" he admitted, he was planning on being so much more cunning and not revealing his weakness but Harry was his weakness. Hearing these things from him hurt worse than he ever could have imagined. He was completely exposed, he'd never felt this vulnerable.
Draco shifted a little, that hadn't been intentional, he quickly regained his composure and nodded wearing his regular smirk "Why yes Harry, we're coworkers now and it's only appropriate that we refer to each other on a first name basis" he said taking another sip of his drink. Quick save, classic Slytherin.
Draco took a deep breath and closed his eyes shaking the memories from his mind "Thank you for your statement in the trials. Without you I'd have been sent to Azkaban with my father" he said.
Harry should have been angry, or offended but he just started laughing. Snape looked at him as if he'd lost his mind "I can't believe I'm about to say this but I actually missed you" Harry finally said.
Harry groaned and nodded, he helped her clean up and left his friend's rooms, more than ready to sleep and put an end to this excruciatingly long day.
Luna smiled wider and twirled away "Oh this will be so very fun" she said before skipping away "See you later Harry!" she called as she left him standing in the hall smiling at his nutty friend.
They both broke out in laughter "Even if I did believe that, that's not what I meant. I just meant well... You look really rough Harry" He said, surprisingly candidly.
Harry laughed a little "All I'm saying is it could have been a possibility, you're a very handsome man Draco and if you hadn't been a total git in school I might have been interested" he said, his level of candour shook Draco to his core.
Draco closed his eyes and smiled, relaxing and letting himself enjoy the warm quiet serenity of the moment. However it didn't last long when he heard a small voice whisper "Mischief Managed"
This amused Harry. Despite his new opinion of Draco, he still had a small part of him that relished in Draco's discomfort.
Draco nodded a little surprised, the Harry Potter, saviour and star of Gryffindor, loved Slytherin colours. He nodded in thanks to Harry before taking a swig of the burning alcohol. Harry downed the whole double of whiskey with ease and poured himself another. Draco raised an eyebrow but didn't question him, instead he finished his glass and Harry poured him another
Harry paused before breaking out in hysterical laughter, which only enraged Draco more. By the time Harry finally caught his breath, Draco was visibly twitching with anger. He was jealous! Oh this is too good!
Harry hummed before slowly pulling away "You have no idea what you're getting yourself into" he whispered.
Harry walked back into the room and raised his eyebrows in surprise "We'll need some glasses and sugar cubes" Draco simply stated, sitting down on the loveseat and fiddling with some intricate looking contraption. Where in the world did that come from?
He could have sworn he felt Harry's hand ghost over his but when he opened his eyes Harry's arms were folded across his chest and he was looking off into the darkness "Well I suppose I should leave you to it" he said before standing up, still not looking directly at Draco.
Harry's heart dropped when the full reality of the situation fell on him. He jumped away from Draco as if his touch burned him "Sorry" he mumbled. He wanted to keep holding him, he wanted Draco to hold him too. He wanted Draco to kiss him and love him and make everything better.
"Even if I did believe that, that's not what I meant. I just meant well... You look really rough Harry" Draco said, surprising both of them.
Harry's heart ached when he saw the hurt pass through the blondes eyes. Draco retracted his hand and smiled apologetically "I'm sorry, instinct. Are you alright?" He asked.
"Greetings everyone, I'm so pleased to see you all here today" Minerva started "As you can see there have been some additions to our staff and I'm pleased to announce that, our own Mr Potter, Mr Malfoy and Miss Lovegood have joined us as professors. I'd be pleased to see you all working together and treating everyone here as family" she said looking directly at Malfoy and Harry for the last part.
After a few hours, two strong brews of tea and a brief nap Harry finished his draft to give to Minerva tomorrow morning. He stretched and straightened his robes before making his way out of his rooms and towards the Grand Hall for training.
Luna grabbed Harry's empty tea cup and refilled it, adding another sugar cube. At the sight of the sweet shape Harry's mind instinctively went back to the feeling of Draco's arms around him, his lips on his. Merlin he wanted it. He shook his head and gathered his thoughts once more, accepting the cup and draining it easily. Luna did the same and urged Harry to continue.
Harry sighed again and did as he was told, he blew on the liquid to cool it down before draining the cup of its contents. Harry smiled a little, Luna had added camomile. She knew it was Harry's favourite and helped calm him.
Draco's heart raced, what in the world was happening right now? Control Malfoy, never reveal your cards. Draco shrugged trying to look as if he didn't care "Maybe in passing, like if one were to contemplate the existence of mythical creatures" he said, voice staying surprisingly even.
Luna squeezed his hand tightly, dragging Harry back into reality "Dear Harry its time. Trust me, trust the cards. Change is coming whether you like it or not. Just please don't shut yourself away when they try to love you" She said.
Last night was the first time in a very long time that Harry actually had a nice relaxed time laughing and smiling. He hadn't been that comfortable and content in a long time. And to think it was all spent with Draco Malfoy. Harry woke up not really getting much rest, not that he usually did because of his nightmares. He yawned and rubbed his eyes as he got up and made his way to the bathroom to take a much needed shower as his pajamas were soaked through with night sweats. He smiled as he remembered last night, he would never have expected it but Malfoy was actually quite pleasant company when he wasn't wearing that infuriating dumb smirk and he was gracious enough to avoid subjects Harry seemed too uncomfortable to talk about.
Harry smiled wider and removed Luna's hands from his face "I'm glad to hear you think something wonderful is happening" he said not really believing that anything extraordinary was going to happen to him.
He began to hum softly as he finished brewing the tea, adding a little raw honey for sweetness. Honey was always better than sugar when it came to camomile. When he was done he walked over to Harry to find him already watching the Slytherin intently.
They all died because of me. If I had been better, if I tried harder, if I trained more, they could still be alive. If I wasn't such a stupid boy and I'd listened to what people told me. If I had just died when I was supposed to.
Draco nodded in agreement "Did you actually want to kiss me last night or were you just drunk?" He asked, the main question that had been burning a hole through his mind.
Harry chuckled and pulled Draco into a soft sweet kiss, slowly wrapping his arms around Draco's neck.
Draco put his now empty glass on the table and crossed his arms "You're full of it, it's not polite to joke about such things" he said. Merlin did he want it to be real, for there to be even a chance, even if it was in a whole other hypothetical world.
"Ah Potter, I heard you'd been offered a position here. Believe me I had no idea you'd take it given your steady trajectory in the Auror field" he said as sophisticated and ponce like as always.
Draco let out a sound from deep in his throat and wrapped his arms around Harry's waist. God do that more, Harry thought as he kissed the man more, after a moment he pulled away from the kiss - just a few millimetres to gasp in some air.
Draco nodded looking back at Harry "I was expecting copious amounts of garish red and that obnoxious gold" he said with a slight sneer as he thought of the, in his opinion, hideous colours.
Malfoy smiled another charming smile and nodded "It would be my honour" he said, Harry had to stop himself from rolling his eyes. Admittedly that would be quite a juvenile thing to do but old grudges die hard. It was difficult not to find everything Malfoy did irritating.
Harry didn't seem to agree with that answer and leaned a little closer, all of Draco's nerves were on fire. He'd do anything to touch the man in front of him, he was painfully close and yet far too far away.
Draco looked over at him and smiled "Yeah, okay. I'd like that" he admitted. So they sat there, sipping their tea, in comfortable silence. When they'd both finished, they put their empty mugs on the table in front of them. Draco turned to say something but found Harry slowly leaning over, he pressed a soft kiss on Draco's lips before cuddling up to his side.
Harry visibly shook "No" he whispered. He didn't care who, or how, or why, or when, he didn't want this. This was dangerous, scary, terrible.
Harry blushed furiously as he made his way away from the courtyard and back to his rooms. As soon as he got in he sat on the couch and took a deep breath "What the bloody hell was that Harry?" he asked himself, shards of hysteria evident in his voice. He rubbed his hands over his face knocking his glasses askew. He fixed them and put his Marauders Map on the coffee table.
Harry walked towards the grand hall much more relaxed than he was this morning, why was he so worked up this morning anyway?
Harry lifted his head slowly and frowned at the Slytherin, why did that bother him so much? "What makes you think I'm joking?" He asked.
Harry's face stayed completely neutral as he nodded a greeting and walked into the hall. Draco looked as if he was going to say something but he just looked down and silently followed Harry into the hall.
Luna shuffled the cards, hands moving almost too quickly to see, and placed the deck face down on the coffee table. She held out one of her hands and Harry instinctively intertwined their fingers. Luna took the top card from the deck and placed it face up on the table.
"Snape?" Harry asked, he didn't know he had his portrait painted - let alone hung in the defence against the dark arts classroom.
Draco smiled a little and nodded "I guess you're right, this drink however is more of a gift than anything else. I don't often share things so dear to me" he said turning the running water off and stirring the drinks before handing one of the glasses to Harry "You're going to want to sip this Potty" he said, you could feel the affection behind the nickname. Harry tentatively took the glass, maybe this wasn't the best idea but he didn't really want to think about it so he scoffed and took a big swig. Draco cringed at him "First of all that was terribly uncouth, secondly you're going to regret that" he said taking a small sip from his own glass.
His chest hurt, this was just cruel. This was torture, knowing that even if Draco saw the want in Harry's eyes, he was just imagining it. Wishful thinking.
Harry opened the door angrily and glared daggers at the blonde man "Everything. Everything that's happened between us. It was  all a mistake" he spat, beginning to close the door.
Harry relaxed a little and nodded "I'm fine, if that's all I must go over some notes" he said, beginning to close the door and trying to get away from his confusing feelings.
Harry just nodded, still looking confused and retrieved the requested items from the kitchen. "I thought you needed help with the N.E.W.T.s not a guinea pig for new potion" Harry grumbled warily as he set the glasses and bowl of sugar cubes down on the table in front of Draco.
Harry nodded too "I know, I'm trying to stay in control" he said. Luna smiled a small supportive smile and gestured for him to continue "We just talked and had a few drinks most of the night and it was really quite pleasant. I was pleased that not only could I now be civil with him but it looked like we could even be friends. I was shocked to say the least at how much I genuinely enjoyed his company" Harry explained.
On the seventh morning of his stay, Harry was awoken from his deep slumber by a frantic Ron, who was shaking his shoulder.
It was so still, so quiet, that when Draco was rudely awoken by the shouts of his father's knights he practically went into cardiac arrest. He sat up immediately, as did Harry, who was looking at him with wide, fearful eyes.
Draco’s mouth dropped open at the sudden forcefulness in Harry’s words and he colored more than Harry had thought possible, pale cheeks dusted with crimson. He was silent for a moment, only to begin squirming.
“Father!” Draco called, pushing himself past the stunned knight and sprinting over to The King. “Why have you imprisoned me like this?! I’m the Prince, I’m--”
“So, Harry,” Hermione continued, ignoring Ron’s apology. “Do you plan on meeting anyone at the ball?”
The lavatory smelled like sex, and so did they.Harriet ran her fingers through Draca’s hair as she thought of a solution.  “Do you...do you want to skip Defense Against the Dark Arts, go to Hogsmeade maybe?” Harriet asked tentatively, fearing rejection for the first time that day.
Draco flushed, deeper now, and scoffed, kicking a rock with his left foot. “Excited? Hah. The day I’ll be excited to spend more time with a petty servant such as yourself will be the day pigs fly.”
Well, that's it. It's done. To be honest, I'm really really emotional about this! I worked so hard on this fic for so long, and I got so invested in it. I'm sad that it's over now. Please please leave a comment if you enjoyed this, it means so much to me.
Harry allowed himself to push in a few more inches and groaned at the tight heat. “Fuck,” He said throatily as he pinned one of Draco’s arms to the bed. “You alright?”
“They've come for me, Draco,” he whispered. Draco looked down at Harry's hands, clutching the soft material of the sleeping bag, and saw that they were shaking.
Draco grumbled in protest but did not object, following Harry down the path once again. The two walked in silence for a moment. Harry kicked a rock and watched it tumble down the road.
“That is possibly the most adorable story I’ve ever heard,” Hermione said dreamily. Harry’s eyes widened and he felt his face flushing.
“Well, I wasn’t expecting to keep them on in the water if that’s what your stupid arse is implying!”
The guard was silent, only to reply reluctantly a moment later. “There’s been an explosion in the far right wing of the castle, Your Highness.”
“Harry Potter. You are to come with me at once,” He boomed, and the knights stood at attention. Harry hung his head as he stepped forward pathetically, body heavy with acceptance. He refused to speak, for knew that it was useless at this point; he was going to die no matter what. The King led him down twisted corridor after twisted corridor, silver robes billowing from the breeze of open windows. His crown, thin and delicate, was crafted from what appeared to be pure silver and diamonds and it sat soft and gentle on his head.
Draco shivered, cock twitching. Why the hell was he getting off on being called a slut? Then Harry began to jerk him off, slow, tantalizing, and Draco felt every ounce of sanity he had left leave his brain. Harry knew exactly what he was doing; he knew where to squeeze, where to tug, and Draco was embarrassingly close already.  But he wanted more, wanted Harry inside him, so he parted his legs as a silent plea. Harry groaned at the sight, hand fluttering around Draco’s dripping cock. “Fuck, you’re killing me. We can’t--I can’t do that, I don’t have anything--”
“Prince Malfoy,” One of the knights said, kneeling in front of Draco and obscuring his view of Harry. “Your father has requested that you return home at once.”
“Hmm.” Draco began to kick more methodically this time; although he was all knees and flailing limbs he still managed to move a few feet closer to Harry.
“I think I understand, now,” Harriet said, eyes locked on Draca’s. Draca backed up, chin raised high, until her small body was flush with the bathroom stall.
Harry sighed, removing himself from Draco slowly. Draco, embarrassingly, felt his throat constrict at the loss.
Draco was silent for a moment. He sighed, sitting up languidly. “Alright, alright! I’ll go find him! But I’ll order Father to behead you if this makes things worse.”
He jiggled his leg, alternating between burrowing into his thin blanket and tossing around like a fish. What is it with these bloody fish metaphors? He thought as he picked dirt from under his nails.
“I didn’t know you came here! I just heard amazing things about their brunch and had to check it out. Have you been here before? It’s exquisite!  How did you hear about this place?” Without invitation Anthony took a seat in the spot Harry had reserved for Draco. “Oh, who am I kidding! You must know of all the best spots, a well-connected guy like yourself.” He grinned lasciviously and leaned forward resting a hand on Harry’s shoulder, completely oblivious to the now silent table. “Do you know of any place more intimate perhaps? I’d love your opinion.”
“WHAT? NO! Why would you pick that? Nobody even LIKES Monopoly! Monopoly is where friendships go to die!” Patrick exclaimed, clearly dismayed.
, if I’d known just how fucking hurt and miserable he was. If only I’d seen it or if he would have just
In stepped a gorgeous, tall, man with slender features, dark hair, and the most piercing blue eyes Draco had ever seen.
He shifted slightly; nuzzling into the hand caressing him, he opened his eyes and smiled at Draco, fully dressed and crouching beside the bed. He began to reach for his glasses, but Draco stopped him.
Someone startled him out of his reverie by plopping down next to him and leaning back against the plush seat. “Oh hi,” said a highly relaxed Lovegood.
“Maybe what!? We’d just kiss and make up like nothing happened!? We’d just hold hands and skip off into the sunset like he didn’t...like
Harry looked crestfallen as he turned away, running his hands through his already disheveled hair. “But we agreed… we
“I swear, you boys.” She looked utterly frustrated, but her eyes bored into his. “Draco, I need you to answer me honestly. How do you feel about him now.”
It had been six months since Draco’s birthday, and Harry still couldn’t believe how lucky he was. Draco was everything he didn’t know he’d wanted until he’d met him. Occasionally he still looked back at the day he’d first met Draco in that club and shuddered. He couldn’t believe there was a time when the most beautiful and fascinating man he’d ever met spent his weekends trolling clubs and getting fucked by strangers in alleys, or, even worse, that Harry had been one of those men. He couldn’t believe that he’d later gotten him, and then nearly lost him again. Not this time, he vowed to himself. He already had the ring; in fact, he’d bought it the morning after Draco’s birthday. He was just waiting for the time to be right.
She fidgeted in her seat. “But then, well with Ron and I, and don’t get me wrong, he was happy for us, but he sort of lost the only thing he could ever count on to just be his. But then you…”
He was curled up in a ball as memories swam through his head; Harry petting his hair, Harry’s excitement when he had agreed to go on a real date, Harry looking sheepish and nervous at the restaurant, Harry saying “I always pay attention to you Draco”, the look of bliss on Harry’s face when Draco had kissed him against the shop window.
Draco laughed. They clinked their glasses and sat in amiable silence. When the first glass was finished, Pansy ordered a second round. Draco took a sip as Pansy eyed him. The second he set it down she pounced.
“Go to bed. I don’t want you to use being tired as an excuse for why I trounce you tomorrow in hand to hand combat.”
The world shifted slightly and suddenly they were outside the club. He remembered now: he had confronted Draco. “Don’t you dare sell this story to
“Fine, if that’s how you feel, then great. Enjoy bunking with Crief, It looks like Anderson is your new partner. Try not to get hexed. He tends to panic and abandon his partner when he gets overwhelmed. Oh… wait, never mind. I’m sure you’ll get along perfectly. Goodbye Draco.”
“Oh, don’t be like that you fucking arsehole. You’ve barely looked or spoken to me in weeks, and then I woke up this morning and you were fucking gone.” Harry began to pace as he launched into a rapid tirade. “Your books, your clothes, everything! Did you not consider what that would do to me? I thought something had happened! I thought you’d had an emergency, or that you’d been taken! Because surely you wouldn’t just sneak out and leave in the middle of the night. I stormed into Gregson’s office and demanded to know where you were and what was wrong because I was fucking
you!” Anthony Goldstein said as he approached, pulling Harry in for a firm hug and smiling mischievously, “My...the years since the war have been good to you. I haven’t seen you in ages...Are you living in London?”
B.J. smiled again,”I have no nefarious intentions friend. You seem like an okay bloke. But lost, and if you don’t mind me saying, in need of a little bit of kindness and repair. Besides, what can I say? We fuck-ups gotta stick together. Now, let's get you to this Pansy.”
When their mimosas arrived, their server brought them three instead of two, placing the extra in front of Draco. “The extra one’s on me,” he smiled, “I’ve seen you around here enough times to know that face means ‘keep them coming’ and I thought I’d save myself the trip.”
“No, love, don’t get up. I just wanted to let you know I’m heading to the restaurant.” He leaned over and kissed Harry softly. “I’ll see you and the guys a little later, okay?” he said, petting Harry’s hair lovingly. “I’m making a special just for you, ‘Gingerbread Waffles with Treacle Butter and a Pumpkin Latte’.”
He looked around at his perfectly appointed flat. He liked it here. It was the first place that was ever all his own. Everything in it was his. No stuffy elegant wardrobes and tasteful antique aubussons. No, here he had his plush comfortable sofa, stylish and functional end tables, the biggest damn TV he could find so he could watch Gordon Ramsey in style, and a wide open space he could fill with people. Everything here was here because of choices
He leaned down and kissed Draco gently, pressing soft warm kisses to his lips and gently licking into his mouth. Draco wrapped his arms and legs around Harry’s body and keened as their erections pressed together. They kissed lovingly as Draco began to rut up against Harry’s leaking prick with increasing speed and pressure. He squeezed him tight and whined, “Please Harry, I need you inside me. I need this. I want you. Make me yours again. Please.”
“Fine! If you have to know, I really care about you! And I can’t do this just one time and be ok later! I can’t taste you and never get to have you again! And I was asked to make this stupid journal by my STUPID mind healer and I found out that feelings are stupid and my father was right because I started to become weaker when I started to fall in love with—” Draco felt the colour leave his face. “Oh look at the time! Is that dinner hour? I better be off—”
made. Okay, well, not everything, he thought as he looked at the candles, throw blankets and end table lamps that had Pansy written all over them. But he chose her, so they belonged here just the same.
Well that's all folks! I hope you enjoyed this fic and much as I do. It's been a wild ride and I created something here I never thought I'd be able to. Thanks for coming on this journey with me. For my next long fic I'll be writing Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert's
“Oi Malfoy! You look hot! Why don’t you roll up your sleeves?” shouted Finnigan from across the table smiling. “Oh...that’s right. Nevermind!” and quickly turned back to Hannah.
, she is the encouragement and focus my brain needs when I get stuck and frustrated. Another thanks this week to
The music was too loud, the liquor was overpriced and the company was miserable. He hated these outings; really outings of any kind. He was reminded every time he left the house that if he stubbornly insisted on existing that he should do it somewhere where his presence wouldn’t be a burden to his fellow wizards. A short trip to the shops resulted in cold stares, snide comments, and shopkeepers refusing to serve him. Occasionally people threw things. Once a woman walked right up to him in the street and slapped him.
Harry looked adorably helpless as he glanced over the wine selection, so Draco smiled and ordered wine and appetisers for them.
This time Harry knew where he was. He was in his flat. It was morning; he looked around and saw them asleep in bed. Draco was half-asleep, reaching a hand into Harry’s hair. Harry stirred, and he could see Draco wake with a start. He looked around, seemingly afraid for a moment, then looking over to Harry and relaxing. He ran a finger over Harry’s temple and down the side of his cheek, studying him. Harry realised this must have been the first night he’d brought Draco home.
“I bought you a ring the day after your birthday.” Harry looked at him with sincere open eyes and took a knee. ”Do you want it?”
alone!? He just needed time to get himself sorted, not all her endless meddling. Furious, he stormed over and flung it open. “Goddamnit, Hermione!”
“A loss is a loss,” Garrett said. “ And I beleive that means I get to pick the next 5 game nights. So I’ll see you next Saturday for…drumroll please…MONOPOLY!”
“If you start leaving your dirty socks all over my flat, I swear to God they will never find the body.”
As Harry plopped himself onto the couch BJ had just occupied, he thought about his impending meeting with Draco. He needed to make an impression...Fuck what was he going to wear? Stricken with panic, he shot up from his seat and all but ran to the kitchen, tapping the floo lantern.
Draco flinched back looking at Harry in disbelief. He didn't know words could hurt this much. He shook his head again "No, you do care. Why did you kiss me? Why were you purposefully trying to make me jealous the other day? Why play with my emotions if you didn't care?" he asked pleading for the answer he wanted.
Harry sighed and slumped in his chair "I don't know" he admitted, it wasn't exactly the answer Draco wanted but at least it was an answer.
Harry fought his instinct to run and picked up his glass "Redintegro" they cheered together before swallowing the last glassful. Instantly the bitterness from the last dose was washed away by... Sweetness. So sweet it was almost painful, it made Harry's chest ache in a way he couldn't even explain.
Draco bolted upright and rushed into the room to see Harry curled tightly around himself, he was shaking and crying.
Luna crossed her legs in her chair and sipped at her own cup of tea "Everything, everything" she answered without hesitation.
The ministry couldn't fight against the saviour and so even though Draco had the dark mark he and his mother were sentenced to a house arrest for a number of months which they served and then they were free. Truly and completely free for the first time ever.
Harry shrugged and decided to play along, Draco had been embarrassed enough and Harry had gotten a good laugh in "The nargles stole them" he said casually after he'd calmed down.
Harry smirked knowingly at Draco as he got two tumblers from the drinks cabinet "Expecting more Gryffindor colours?" he asked slightly amused.
Harry's arms quickly and instinctively shot out and wrapped around the body he had collided with. He grabbed them just before they fell to the ground.
Harry's heart began to pound as he saw the blonde Slytherin he couldn't stop thinking about standing in front of him. Draco looked very concerned, he reached out to Harry and Harry flinched away. He was terrified by how much he actually wanted Draco to touch and comfort him. "Don't touch me!" He spat, panicked.
Harry smirked and raised an eyebrow at Draco "Charming as always, I told you I'm fine" he lied, taking the empty bottle into the kitchen. He took a deep breath and leaned against his counter top for a moment, Merlin what am I doing? He asked himself.
Draco composed himself, swallowing the sudden flush of fear that began creeping in, before knocking on Potter's door "It's open!" called Harry from within.
Harry scoffed again and looked at the glass in his hand "You're kidding right? What is it even supposed to do? Other than taste like liquorice candy" He asked before looking up, his head lolled a bit and his pupils dilated. "Oh.." he trailed off.
In all honesty Harry wanted to be done with fighting for his life, he'd been doing so for all his 25 years and for once he just wanted to settle down and live a nice quiet life of a teacher, however if the curse of the DADA professor is true he wouldn't be living such a safe and quiet life.
Luna tilted her head a little to look directly into Harry's eyes. She stared for a moment before a bright wide smile spread across her face "Oh Harry this is wonderful!" she exclaimed doing a little happy twirl.
The dim dungeon was suddenly doused in an electric red light, walls shaking and cracking in time with an invisible pulse. Harry, blissfully unaware of the ringing in his ears and the debris falling onto his body, merely sat with glazed eyes as the walls caved in. Metal bars keeping him from freedom shattered into hundreds of shards, and warm sunlight streamed down from gaping holes in the ceiling.
“Sorry to interrupt this...pleasant little chat of yours, Potter, but it’s late and I’m tired. I’d like to check in now,” Draco demanded, arms crossed. He wasn’t going to sit here and be Potter’s shadow for a moment longer.
“No, Pansy, he hasn’t,” Draco sighed, “ He simply wishes to uphold the Malfoy family’s reputation which is entirely understandable.”
“Generation after generation of the Malfoy Family, those worthy of the throne, have worn this ring with pride. The thought of passing it on to you sickens me.” Lucius continued, every insidious word causing Draco's chest to constrict. “You’re forbidden from seeing this Potter boy again. If you weren't my only heir, I would have you banished.”
Draco blinked. He still felt warm all over. “If you’ll kindly get your shite together, maybe we can head out before next Tuesday.”
“That’s the best you’ve got? Really?” Harriet said, voice rising in volume. “Funny that you should say that, being as your friends are probably future murderers and--”
Draco scoffed, crossing his arms. “Our son is here, you idiot. Don’t say things like that in front of him.”
“Let’s just leave it as it is, Pans,” Draco retorted, voice cold and void of emotion, “I don’t have a choice in the matter.”
“Did Dadda read you a story?” Scorpius asked, green eyes huge and naive. Harry nodded, ruffling his hair.
The look on his face as he wiped a fleck of mud off of his porcelain chest had to have been one of the funniest things Harry had seen in his entire existence. Suddenly Harry was laughing like he hadn’t in ages. He laughed, and laughed, loose and free. I’ve forgotten how nice this is, Harry thought briefly before finally catching his breath. He opened his eyes to Draco staring intently at him, mystified.
Ron seemed a bit dejected at that until Harry spoke up. “Thanks, Ron. I really, really appreciate it.”
Harry only rolled his eyes, giving Draco a playful shove. He chuckled when Draco actually stumbled. So delicate, Harry thought, amusement soon morphing into something else. He began to imagine how pliable and Draco would be if they fucked, how easy it would be for Harry shove his slender body up against a wall and--
Draco opened his mouth as if to reply, but Harry pound into him once again and whatever he had to say died in his throat.
“Hmm?” Harry asked slyly, tracing his fingers over the new, red marks peppering Draco’s porcelain neck. He added a few more, savoring every one of Draco’s breathy moans.
Harriet grinned wickedly, pushing Draca’s legs apart with a sudden force. Draca keened, pressing her hips upwards expectantly. Once Harriet finally found her intended target, Draca parted her legs, cheeks pink and chest heaving with quickened breaths. Harriet sighed dreamily at the sight; Draca was wearing white panties, with a dainty green bow and in the middle. Harriet ran her fingers across the front of them, and Draca gasped sharply. Harriet chuckled softly, brushing a sweaty strand of blond hair away from Draca’s pretty face.
“Ron! You came!” Harry said, ignoring the temptation to pull his friend into a tight hug. Ron scratched the back of his head, smiling sheepishly, and declared: ‘“‘Course I did. A knight always keeps his promises!”
He deepened the kiss, running his tongue across Draco's bottom lip. A soft moan escaped from Draco's lips, immediately followed by him tensing up. Harry chuckled and just barely pulled away.
“Of course you’re good enough for me, and I’ll keep telling you until…” Harry trails away as he realizes how Draco is nibbling on his bottom lip just so. He recognizes that look. “Hold on. Show you how, exactly?”
“Trust me, Potter. You don’t want to talk to the Minister of Magic right now. I’ll do it,” Draco looked down at the device in his hands and furrowed his brow, puzzled. Buttons with the numbers 0-9 covered its surface, and under those numbers were tiny letters. “How does this work?”
“You don’t have to hold back, Draco. I can see how bad you want it, so go ahead and make all the noise you want.”
“This castle will be mine someday,” Draco growled, and the knight shrank back ever so slightly at the pure acidity of his tone. “Once I inherit the throne, you will regret this.”
“What do you need me to do? Haven’t seen enough to give you any pointers yet,” Harry said smugly as Draco scowled at him.
Draco’s mouth opened and then closed. He raised a finger, almost as if he was about to scold Harry, but settled for crossing his arms instead. “I presume you’ve changed your mind about me?”
“Good, good. Now you won’t freeze to death on your way home. See you next time?” Harry asked, praying that the hope in his voice was undetectable.
Time passed sluggishly, and Harry’s chores seemed to be even more intolerable than usual. Harry was restless. So, naturally, when he was handed a very glittery and flamboyant envelope from the Royal Family, he was shellshocked. Vernon had laughed his fat arse off at the fact that Harry had actually gotten mail for once, insisting that it must have been a mistake. However, he shut his mouth when Harry read the letter out loud. A Royal Ball. To find a spouse for the Prince himself. And Harry, of all people, was invited. Of course, Dudley had received one too, but it still served as a complete and utter surprise. How did the Royal Family even know Harry’s name?
“If I  shove a stick up your arse, Ronda,maybe you’d learn to stop talking,” ‘Mione glared pointedly. Now it was Harry’s turn to laugh.
Only then did the Prince seem bashful. He stared up at Harry rather expectantly, as if he wanted him to make the first move. From what Harry could see beneath the feathered mask, the bottom of his cheeks were flushed. Harry was suddenly breathless.
“Uh... Hello,” Harry mumbled stupidly as racing thoughts of Draco’s legs wrapped around his waist flashed through his mind.
“What the- What the bloody hell?! Are you trying to kiss me Potter? This is sexual harassment, my father will be hearing about this!” Draco shrieked, his voice going up a couple octaves.
Anyway, I hope this chapter was satisfying!! Prepare yourself for some forbidden love angst and a plot twist next chapter...the story only has about 3-4 chapters left. There may be some bumps in the road but remember, it's a fairy tale, so there will be a happy ending. Thank you for reading and sticking with us! <3
“You’re the one who came here desperate to talk about this,” Hermione said curtly, but without any venom. “But all right.”
“Who the bloody hell is Ron?” Draco asked, staring unabashedly at the man beside him. “Aren’t you freezing? You’re in shorts!”
“I have!” Draco rummaged through a diamond-encrusted leather bag he had apparently brought along, and pulled out a bleached white, fluffy towel. Harry momentarily yearned to touch it, to feel the soft fabric beneath his palms.
Harry stared, wide-eyed, as a frantic Ron and Hermione came to a halt before him, blocking his path. Ron’s face was red with overexertion and a bead of sweat trickled down Hermione’s smooth skin.
Harry gave Dudley a grudging grunt of assent before stalking back to his room. He loathed Dudley and Uncle Vernon, absolutely abhorred them with every fiber of his being. Harry longed to be free of his servitude; but if he stepped even one toe out of line Vernon would cast him out to live on the streets. And then where would he be? He was worse than a muggleborn, even worse than a squib or muggle; he was a wizard who had lost his magic. A disgrace. The criminals and highwaymen living on the street would eat him alive. Before returning to the kitchen, Harry stopped by Uncle Vernon’s room.
Pansy gave him one of her looks, that implied there was no way she was letting it go. She did drop it for the moment, though, but Draco heard her mumbling something about “unfairness and Draco deserving true love,” before she trounced off in a flurry of silk and gems.
Ron’s shoulders seemed to sag with relief. “Thank Merlin. I think I’d throw up. You have terrible taste in men, Harry, you know that?”
Draco just stared at Harry, eyes huge and lust-blown, and said nothing. Harry gaped and assumed that he must be dreaming; of course this wasn’t real, it couldn’t be real. He could not have been cursing at, insulting, and fucking around with the goddamn Prince this entire time. He couldn’t have.
And Draco did. Harry knew that he was technically a tutor, and tutors were supposed to be patient, but holding back his laughter was proving to be a challenging task. Draco was barely keeping his head above water as he flailed about, breathing labored.
Harry nodded stiffly, watching as the King and his followers made a swift exit, and sat numbly on the bed. His thoughts were a jumbled haze of confusion and fading adrenaline. Were all death row inmates treated with such grace? Had the King made a mistake? Harry sighed, breath leaving him in tense, wavering bursts. All of this seemed like some sort of perverse dream.
“Well?” Potter’s voice ripped Draco from his own mind and he practically jumped out of his seat. Potter looked at him strangely. “You alright?”
“You--” Draco began, eyes widening when Harry removed his own shirt with a swift flick of his wand. “Get on with it!”
“I’m truly flattered,” Draco said, voice proud and eloquent. “And I can’t speak for Officer Brooks, over here. But I actually prefer my men in uniform as well.”
Draco narrowed his eyes. It was cold enough for his breath to freeze in the air, coming out in puffs; he was chilly even in his multiple layers. “Do you?”
Hermione beamed. “That would be wonderful, Harry! Hopefully you can get things done quicker than Ronald.”
Harry was on Draco in an instant, dipping him rather dramatically and capturing his lips. Draco rolled his eyes but went along with Harry’s display of grandeur. We’ve been together for over ten years, Harry thought as he snaked a hand under Draco’s pajama shirt, and our sex life is still bloody incredible.
Harry awoke to the frantic ringing of bells chiming from where they had been mounted on the stone wall of the chilly kitchen. The bell labeled Dudley’s Room, in flowing script, rung, shaking wildly.
"H...Harry," Draco barely whimpered, voice fervent with desperation. Harry snapped his hips and began fucking into him mercilessly, pounding into his prostate with every thrust. Malfoy was practically screaming at this point, pushing Harry deeper into him with his legs.
Draco was tempted to ask what Potter meant by that exactly, but the exhaustion creeping in seemed to have numbed his brain. He held back a yawn and let his eyes flutter closed for a moment.
“What are these?” Harry asked. Hermione scowled at the pile, and then at Ron, only to smile slightly when she met Harry’s eyes.
He breathed a sigh of relief as he walked the streets of his kingdom, appreciating the fresh air and the familiar, bustling sounds of the people. He waved to Neville Longbottom, the clumsy son of a fisherman, but continued walking. The two would usually make pleasant, mildly awkward conversation for a few moments but Harry was in no mood for small talk today.
Draco was quiet, and then something like a very repressed, very twisted smile momentarily graced his lips. “Wonderful. Perhaps you’ll learn proper manners from spending time with me.”
“God, Draco. Fuck,” Harry gasped. A sick sense of satisfaction warmed Draco’s chest at Harry’s reaction; two could play at this game. Draco sucked on his own fingers for a moment, wetting them, and then began stroking Harry’s cock in time with his own.
“Hah!” Draca snorted, crossing her arms. “More like another bullshit lesson conjured up by Dumbledore. I swear, that blood traitor has dementia or something.”
“And who is this? A Muggle friend of yours?” Vernon asked, eyeing Draco with distaste. Draco, who had been staring wide-eyed at the scene unfolding in front of him, seemed to snap back to reality.
And so, without any particular direction in mind, that’s where he ended up. He stepped in, strides soft and relaxed, expecting to be greeted by that enthusiastic Muggleborn Hermione. She was otherwise occupied, however, blabbing away to a rather eye-catching figure. He was tall and covered in heavy silver chainmail that caused every subtle movement of his to puncture the silence of the library with an obnoxious creaking sound. Harry could make out a fiery piece of red hair beneath his helmet as well as thick woolen socks bunched up inside of his boots.
“Severe?!” Lucius laughed, strained, and Draco cringed. “He caused it! His magic it seems to have been released. Half of the dungeon was destroyed!” Lucius said, eyes glinting. “Such power...if I had not seen it with my own eyes, even I would have been skeptical.”
Draco narrowed his eyes. “Same thing I was doing before you left to go chat with those obnoxious friends of yours. Looking through the case files. Are you drunk, Potter?”
“Will you keep quiet, you insolent fool? I’m actually spending my time doing something useful, unlike you.”
“Oh, how proud your father would have been to see you now,” She whispered fondly, placing a weathered but graceful hand over her heart. “Such capable Kings.”
“Fantastic?” Ron said, eyes still wide. “Better than fantastic, I’d say. You can marry him and be filthy rich for the rest of your life.”
Although his mood had been dampened by Dudley’s recurring insults and foul attitude, Harry still felt mildly excited for his hour-long escape to the marketplace. After notifying a half-asleep and most likely drunk Uncle Vernon and receiving a grunt as a response, Harry set off on his way.
Draco whimpered pathetically when he felt Harry’s clothed erection pushing against his own. His legs spread slightly as if on instinct and Harry groaned, burying his head in the crook of Draco’s slender neck.
The two kept this up for a while until Harry made the decision to silently detach himself from Draco.
Potter raised an eyebrow and pushed the stack towards Draco. He began reading through the numerous autopsy reports as quickly as his exhausted brain would allow, hoping to confirm his suspicions. With each page, his pulse quickened. These Muggles had been tortured in an attempt to cause as much pain as possible before death. It was sickening, yes, but it went further than that. A darkness beyond what most could fathom. Sadism for Sadism’s sake. Something Draco had hoped he would never see again.
Potter, seemingly unphased by Draco’s outburst, took a gulp of coffee and began pacing around his disheveled office. “We’ll start at the last crime scene and search for any evidence. Ever done this before?”
After a few more tense moments, the two arrived in front of Harry's office. He jiggled the loose doorknob and let Malfoy inside.
And to top everything off about that day, his father had demanded that he take on a partner! Draco shifted uneasily, his nerves on edge just thinking about it. Unable to bear sitting down and continuing to brood about it, however, Draco decided to go for a ride on his broomstick.
“So it is. Tricky to read it though. I’d say rewrite the title anyway. Oh! I’ve forgotten to get you a quill!” She handed Harry a cheaply made red quill, feather dyed to appear similar to a phoenix's.
This chapter was more plot based, but more romance/smutty will be coming soon in the next chapter !!! Any ideas as to where Draco might take Harry to hide? ;) Also, this fanfic is gonna be longer than we originally anticipated, more like 11 chapters instead of the original 9 we once thought it would be. Hope you enjoy this chapter! <3
“Yeah, yeah,” Blaise grumbled, shifting under the weight of her many textbooks. “Tell him to get me out of Herbology homework, too.”
“Fuck off, Pansy!” Draco wailed, flinging one of his arms out dramatically and practically ripping Pansy’s pearl necklace off in the process. “This is serious!”
“Hah!” Potter barked out one final laugh and then seemed to calm down. Draco rolled his eyes and secured himself under the covers of the bed. He silently thanked God for their clean scent. Before Draco could start to doze off, Potter began stripping right in front of him. Shamelessly. Draco’s eyes widened. He watched from behind as Potter took his clothes off and tossed them to the corner of the room until he was wearing nothing but a pair of boxers. Draco swallowed thickly, taking in the curve of Potter’s arse and the broadness of his shoulders. Shit. Potter seemed unaware of Draco’s ogling (thankfully) as he collapsed on top of the cot and let out a deep sigh.
“Why don’t you follow me and see for yourself instead of asking increasingly dimwitted questions?” Draco challenged flatly as he lifted the entrance flap and stepped inside.
Harry had turned around and made his way over to Draco, suddenly determined. Before Draco could so much as utter a word, Harry had bent over him, one hand on each arm of the chair. His nose was almost brushing Draco’s as he peered down at him, resolute.
“Harry,” He looked at Harry, and then at Malfoy. “Mr. Malfoy. Do you know why I called you into my office this morning?”
Harry rolled his eyes but was not far behind, ducking his head as he entered. He stopped in his tracks, almost bumping into Draco, when he took in his surroundings. They were standing in what seemed to be a small house, complete with a humble bed, two plush armchairs, and plenty of space to move around. Harry gaped, and for the first time felt a pang of bitterness at the fact that he couldn’t use magic.
“C’mon,” Harry panted, drawing him closer to his body. He could feel the Prince’s hardness through his velvet trousers and he shivered, pressing his mouth close to his ear. “Take off the mask.”
