“How’d you sleep?” Hermione asks anyway, far too perceptive.
that you are.”
And the castle—the castle is almost exactly as he remembers it. The familiarity punches him in the gut, and for a moment, Harry feels like he’s walked into the past, straight into his first year.
“Would you mind if we join? The crowd out there is a bit nuts,” he says, looking from Ron to Hermione to Harry. Harry tries to surreptitiously remove his hand from his wand.
? Don’t know if you’ve forgotten, but I was on the bloody run from a maniac, Gin, keeping track of my cauldron wasn’t the first thing on my mind—”
When Malfoy turns around, Harry is struck at once by his eyes. The rest of him remains more or less unchanged since the end of the War—still impeccably dressed in tailored robes, hair still icy blond and carefully set. Everything elegant and precise and screaming of wealth. But his gray eyes have a weariness that Harry is not used to seeing, and dark bags stand stark beneath them. The only other thing about him to change is his height—he seems to have added an inch or so to his already tall frame, forcing Harry to look up at him.
“Oh, honestly, Ron! Haven’t we moved past this?”
“Thanks.” Neville shoots Hermione a grateful look before plopping down next to Harry. Ginny carefully sits across from him. “Does anyone know who else has come back? Eighth years, I mean.”
Other nights, he was entering the Forbidden Forrest again, except this time he was alone. Utterly alone in the ink blackness of the night. Voldemort’s high, cold laugh would pierce the air, but the flash of green light never came; instead, Voldemort’s icy fingers would lock onto Harry’s throat and dig into flesh, and Harry would die with no one close to him but Voldemort.
He wrestles with the gray quilt of the bed, desperate to untangle himself. He wrenches the bed curtains open, stumbles from bed, and then freezes only several steps away as it all comes back to him—Hogwarts, the gray room, Goyle. He steadies himself on the bedside table and tries to quiet his ragged breaths. Goyle’s snores remain blessedly steady.
“A good number of Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs. Us, of course. Malfoy, Zabini, Goyle.” Hermione adds the final few names in a rush. If she was hoping Ron wouldn’t notice, it didn’t work.
“I think you ought to come back for tonight, Harry,” she had said so gently, cupping one of his arms in both of her warm, dark hands.
“Right there. Next to Hagrid, in the blue.”
engraved on her arms and her whose parents’ minds had erased their daughter for possibly forever.
“Gotta put our hands on the door,” Goyle says gruffly. He evidently has nothing more to add; he won’t even make eye contact. He and Harry place their hands on the door, and Harry feels the familiar tingle of a ward washing over them. Its magic chases a shiver down his spine, and he gets the unpleasant sensation of his magic mingling with Goyle’s. He’s not sure he wants his anything mingling with the broad Slytherin. The door opens with a click, and Goyle lumbers into the room with a grunt.
“I wasn’t
When they arrive, the skies have darkened completely with night, but the rain has slowed to just spitting. They wait until the last minute to exit the train car in the hopes that the crowd of eager students will have dissipated. It works, sort of, but the second they step off the train, the gaggles of students walking toward the carriages seem to automatically swivel toward them. Harry is unnerved by how in sync their turns are.
“Of course you can,” Hermione adds, and Harry nods for good measure.
“Thanks, Hermione. I’ll keep that in mind,” Harry mutters, hoping this will sate her. He doesn’t want to discuss his love life—or lack of—in front of his not-girlfriend’s brother. He doesn’t want to have to address the Grimmauld Incident or whatever issues Hermione is convinced he has. He’s fine.
“Who changed his mind about what position?” Ginny asks, tuning in.
“Really, Ron?” Hermione sighs the second the door slides shut.
“Afraid not,” Hermione answers, although her shoulders loosen and lips quirk up. “I’m a bit more ethical than I once was.”
Harry points Ron and Hermione’s attention to the head table. “That woman, next to Hagrid. Who is she?”
Harry tunes in just in time to catch the next pairing: “Draco Malfoy and Ronald Weasley.”
“Dementors or not, I hope he can last more than a year, at least,” Ron says. “Be the first to manage it.”
“Harry Potter and Gregory Goyle.”
Suddenly, Harry can’t remember why he had been apprehensive to return. Hogwarts, just as it had always been, is home.
“I presume you two are not having issues this early in the term, boys.” She looks down her nose severely at them.
The blond flipped them so Harry was straddling his lap, still kissing the corner of his mouth.
As he looked outside the window, appreciating the colours the sky got in the morning , he noticed that there was a head of messy ginger hair in the grass and went to see why Ginny was up so early.
He fell asleep with a smile on his face.
“Bloody, Fucking, Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”
As usual—and as if nothing had happened —Malfoy started sneering as soon as they laid eyes on each other —Harry responded with a disgusted look of his own.
“Do you think you can come to the victory party in our common room?” Ginny asked, concern in her voice.
This time, he tried to pay attention when she went through the wand movements and the incantation. It was difficult. His mind kept drifting.
“You did look awful funny covered in it.”
“Wait. What? No. We made plans to get together today, but I missed picking him up after his shift. I apologized, and he closed the door in my face.” Now that Harry recounted the story, he felt his anger stir. He’d apologized. It had been an honest mistake. But Malfoy had shut the door on him.
Harry glanced at Ginny, who was smirking now. She said, “I think it’s a great idea.” At Luna’s beaming smile, she added, mouth full, “Did you enjoy the shop? Maybe you can be a barista.”
“Anything else?”
Harry had to agree.
He says, “Just make sure they postpone that hearing. Don’t let him say anything in front of the Wizengamot.”
He needed to apologize. But what could he say?
“Uncle Harry!”
“He usually does.”
“Er—yes.” His gaze flicks to Malfoy, who is watching with bored half-interest. He doesn’t know why he feels self-conscious to do this in front of him, but he fears Hermione’s basilisk stare more than…well, whatever he fears from Malfoy. So he lifts his wand and spells a thin golden wisp of light from his temple, not unlike a memory. Except he doesn’t direct this one into a pensieve; instead, he points it into the rectangular mirror in Hermione’s hands. Golden light shivers over the surface, and when it’s cleared, words appear.
The green seal on the largest letter made his heart clench. All thoughts of breakfast fled. He sank to one of the kitchen table chairs, staring at the envelope.
you with Gnosis University anymore?”
“But how is Draco? Of course they didn’t find anything—right?”
“Listen to everything I have to say before reacting,” she says.
“Go visit Ginny and Luna, yeah.”
“Yep,” Harry said.
, Malfoy said. He scanned Harry’s immediate thoughts: Harry’s regret, which he inspected and then cast aside without a flicker of emotion. More embarrassing was Harry’s state of being over the last week, the worry and the sleeplessness.
Malfoy was boastful about it, himself. But Harry didn’t mind it so much in Malfoy. There was something funny about the way Malfoy gestured animatedly and waxed poetic about the Internet and recipe searches. Harry wasn’t the only one to think so. The girls stifled laughter.
Without breaking stride, Malfoy turned toward the car park and ducked under the chain and its “Private - No Trespassing” sign. Harry ducked after him.
“And you’ve already established that you don’t need to eat,” Draco said, staring intently at his parchment as he scratched notes; he still felt ill at the memory of Potter’s arm cut off at the wrist by the wood of the table. “Am I to understand your body doesn’t need sustenance in this state?”
against you.”
“I’m not a ghost,” Potter said. He looked down at his mostly see-through body. “I know what it looks like, but I’m not actually dead.” Then, when Draco still hadn’t said anything, he added almost sheepishly, “I need your help.”
“Are you sure you—”
“So it’s a plan, then, yeah? We’ll help you get this place sorted.”
He rests his mouth against the rim of the cup, breathing steam into his face and fogging up his glasses. A tiny smile tugs at his mouth as he remembers the canceled hearing and Robards’ surprise. Malfoy—with the help of Hermione—can hold his own. He thinks of the reports he won’t have to write up on Malfoy, and the words he won’t have to censor when Robards blows into his office to interrogate him on the investigation. He thinks of the protesters outside the Ministry—he no longer needs to pretend they’re his problem—and the story in the
“Please. You’d drink swill and think it’s good.”
At the time, he’d thought it was luck. Incredibly good luck, at that. But some days he wondered if he managed the house, or vice versa.
Slowly, painstakingly, Draco unfolded the wrapping paper. It was hard to tell if he was doing it extra carefully just to get under Harry’s skin. Harry should have never said anything that first Christmas they spent together, should have never complained about how gingerly Draco peeled back the paper (
Mostly, he’d begun so she would stop bothering him about it. Then, he’d kept on out of sheer stubbornness. It took months to unlearn what he thought he knew about mind magic. More, to build up his occlumency. By the time he began to learn legilimency in earnest, his mind was a fortress. He liked it. He
Harry sighs. “Come on. I’ll make you some chamomile tea.”
They exchanged a few more lines of apology and thanks. That, at least, was
“Conspiracy?” Malfoy’s voice cuts upward. “Sedition?”
“Oh. Sorry?”
Malfoy’s case file. The one he requested access on days ago.
“And what is your offer?”
The list of beers stretched three pages. Each bore an outrageous name, along with a startling alcohol content and a description that might have been written by a poet imbibing the goods. Harry's eyes glazed over.
The thought came with a vivid image of Malfoy’s sharp profile as he drove. “You should probably be sitting down for that one,” Charlie had told him with a grin—and maybe in private, Harry reckoned as he glanced in shock at the label, which depicted an anthropomorphic letter D with hooded eyes and with large cherries floating above its head like thought bubbles, each with a little drawing of a daydream inside.
Harry smiled ruefully. “You were right. I had fun.”
It was strange to be on this side of the counter. From where he stood, Harry could see out the front window that Malfoy stood at when he was mixing and kneading dough during the day. He could see the spot where he himself had stood when he’d first spotted Malfoy from the opposite side of the road.
Ginny strolled closer to clap Harry on the shoulder. “Glad to have you back.”
“Everyone else seems keen on telling me what they think I should do.”
“What?”
“For fuck’s sake, Malfoy, I’m not—” Potter lowered his voice. “I’m not dead. Please don’t make me keep saying it.”
It made perfect sense, then, and Harry poured his next latte perfectly. He shot a look at Malfoy. “Why didn’t you just say that?”
They said goodbye to each other in the entrance garden next to a gnarled pear tree. Parkinson had decided to stay with Malfoy for a few days, to Harry’s relief and dismay. That killed any idea of visiting Malfoy again before he left for England, but at least his peace with Luna and Ginny wouldn’t be disturbed.
Before he can think about the words, Harry says, “Usually no one sees what’s underneath.”
“When do you want to leave?”
“Oh, would you?”
. It lies folded on the center of the table where the delivery owl dropped it. A portion of the headline can be seen, and that and the part of his face visible in the photo are enough to alert him that he is not interested in reading more. Not right now. Not before his second cup of tea. Not before his third.
So he didn’t understand why Ginny punched
Ginny smiled hugely at Malfoy, who was sitting across from her, and said, “How are you feeling after your
“Hey, little ones,” Harry said. It’d been so long since he’d spoken Parseltongue, and the ability had ebbed since Voldemort had been defeated, so the words came out rusty and spitting. Luna had to help him get their attention by waving her fingers sinuously, and he suspected this was how she’d kept them mostly together in the first place.
“Huh? Oh. No, they haven’t.” Luna and Ginny had remained busy around the farm, and so had Harry. It hadn’t even occurred to him that he still hadn’t seen much of Portland.
Malfoy is the one who opens his grip, letting Harry go. Harry brushes his palm against his trouser leg. His face flames. It has to be the blood catching up to his head.
Harry stared back into the cold eyes. Anger stirred in him, but it was muffled by the sense that he utterly deserved this. He pressed his hands to the armrests, readying to stand. “All right. Well, I tried, didn’t I?”
“Just the way I like things.”
Malfoy pushes away from the chair, rolling his eyes again, like Harry is making demands of him. “Fine. Whatever.”
“Not at all,” Malfoy said, with a smile in his voice.
“Hey, Hermione. Is Ron around?”
Harry was watching Malfoy at a Ministry party. Malfoy looked fey under the soft glow of the lighting charms. Pale, with eyes the grey of polished rock. A civilized predator in his sharp robes. Dangerous but contained, tamed.
“Huh?”
“And that’s it,” Malfoy said. “That is the esteemed kitchen.”
“The actual library is downstairs,” Malfoy said. “This is one of the few dedicated magical shopping centers in the city.”
They emerged from the greenhouse in time to hear a sweet, high-pitched, musical whistle from nearby. Draco froze.
So, he didn’t struggle. Not that it would have made a difference. He took the bare fists and the
“Sir.”
Malfoy tilted his head in the equivalent of a shrug. He was looking at Harry in an odd way that made Harry squirmy. He set down the magazine. “I was thinking. Since you’ll be returning to England soon, you might want to try a few more things before heading back? What happens in the States stays in the States.”
“It suits you, too,” Luna said.
Potter was still looking at him with a look of slight surprise—and suspicion.
to me. Please.” She places a hand on his blanket-covered knee. “The aurors arrested him the morning after your visit to his house. When they questioned him, he admitted to developing the potion himself and releasing it into the water supply, as well as attempting to connect it with Poesy Potions.”
“Well, good for you.” He paused, felt a weight settle over him like a heavy blanket. “Maybe being an Auror is all I’ve ever wanted to do. Maybe I’m not made for anything else.”
Malfoy clenched Harry’s arse and moaned into him.
“Did you know Draco Malfoy is living in Oregon?” Harry asked, suddenly.
Ginny pointed across the field to cast another marker. “So how’s it going with your big gay awakening?”
“Willow,” she said as they passed under the cool shade of a weeping tree. Then, “Elder,” as they passed another with clusters of shining black berries. They’d reached the bottom of the sloping garden, and the air was slightly cooler here, and moist.
Malfoy snapped his fingers. “I’m off my shift at two. We can become bosom buddies then. But you’ll have to order something else if you’re going to stay.”
They only knew that Harry had overstepped with his legilimency somehow and that orders hadn’t been followed as they should have.
This one was noticeably cruder than the one for Teddy. Harry had made it earlier in the month, before they’d refined their book-making craft, and he’d made it by himself. It had been a lot more challenging to make one of these on his own, but he thought—at the time—that it was worth the effort. Now he held his breath as Draco stared down at it—simultaneously despairing and proud.
Malfoy squawked his indignation, an echo of his cry when Williams dropped him to the floor. Then Harry met the resistance he’d first expected from Malfoy.
During one lull between customers, Sophie said, “Impressive. Your taste is terrible, but you have a real talent for charming people.”
Malfoy appeared a few minutes later. (Harry
“Ask her how she knows,” Ron put in.
Malfoy grins a lazy, vaguely predatory grin and finishes his brandy. Harry, figuring what the hell, tosses back the rest of his.
Harry scowled to counteract the swooping sensation in his stomach. “What are you doing here?”
Harry smiled charmingly and said, “You can taste the difference.”
“Oh, that looks good, Harry,” Luna said, glancing at the pepper slices on the cutting board. “The seeds can go here.”
Harry followed her gaze across the room, and his stomach gave a jolt when he recognized Malfoy in one of the corner booths. He was wearing the baseball cap pulled down low, nearly to his eyes. And Pansy Parkinson was sitting next to him.
Ginny and Luna. Merlin. It’d been years since he’d seen them. He still remembered hugging them goodbye before they left for the US.
“Wait. This isn’t— Is it?”
Malfoy scowls, but Harry catches only a flash of the expression before it disappears into the pensieve. Harry braces himself against the edge of the table and plunges in after Malfoy.
“Kind of nice, seeing how he runs the place. Kind of like it’s nice seeing how you run the farm. I’ve only known the Aurors for years.”
, Potter,” Malfoy murmured near his ear. “Tsk. If you were still an Auror, you’d have to report yourself.”
have a life.”
Then he pulled back.
Draco turned his face and bit Harry’s nose.
Brandy to your liking, I hope? With ice, or without?”
Malfoy shot her a look. “Watch it.”
“Oh.” Having fixed the botched cushioning charm and recast it—on the correct object, this time—he replaced the broom on its hook. “That makes sense. So you decided to teach, then. So you’d be closer to home?”
“Yes, Malfoy. It looks good to me. Am I supposed to say something else?”
In the same moment, Draco went down, down into Harry’s memories.
tongue, pushing in and out of him, as if—
Harry went with him. Maybe it was the lack of malice in Malfoy’s expression. Even the words “don’t be a stubborn arse” had been spoken in an exhausted tone, almost plaintive.
Draco Malfoy.
“All right,” Harry says, slowly, as he absorbs this, his voice calm despite the fact that his throat is squeezed tight. “But you flooed me, and you’re here. Did Hermione tell you I was helping you?”
His eyes blink open as he remembers. Malfoy’s house.
“It is.”
A little bell rang above. The rich smells of coffee, sugar, yeast, and chocolate greeted him. A coffee machine buzzed in the far corner.
Harry had a flashback of what those fingers—which were wrapped around the cup—had done to him last night. How those eyes had looked, eating him up.
“—different opportunities,” Luna was saying.
Malfoy looked at it and then met Harry’s eyes, and a feeling of déjà vu struck Harry. He was eleven again, standing on the train. Before Harry could look too closely at the memory, Malfoy clasped Harry’s hand—his own was warm and a little moist—and then the feeling of Apparition hooked Harry around the gut and yanked him sideways.
Every muscle in Draco tensed. He knew, he
. Then he pulled down his boxers. His dick stood straight up, and he was self-conscious about that, but Malfoy stared at it with open hunger.
, his brain supplies.
Harry realized it was the second time the brewer had asked him the question.
“I’ll keep it,” Harry said, and she shrugged, took the stand with its number 4, and left.
Draco stood and deposited his bowl and dish on the counter. He cast a stasis charm over both. Glancing at the clock, he said, “I need bread, and if I’m to get any today, I need to leave before the shops close.”
“Not at all,” Luna said.
Harry felt like he’d missed something, but he was very drunk now, so it didn’t bother him.
Malfoy did not look his way again. Harry could have been just another customer.
“Who ever told you you were a waste of space?” There was a frown in Malfoy’s voice.
“Sir?” he says, looking up at Robards, who watches him dispassionately.
Luna’s face poked back through the coats, and Harry gave a startled jump. She smiled at him, seeming to have not noticed it. “It’s all right, Harry. It’s only charmed to stop non-magicals.” She reached a hand out from between the wool and fur.
They passed into the shade of the trees. The path turned into wooden boards that echoed underfoot. The sound of running water grew until Harry was looking down at a little rushing creek.
“Then I…what? Skive off?”
From deeper inside the shop, a muffled voice said, “Hello?” Harry hoped it was human, and he squeezed through the shop towards it.
“Isn’t it though? We recycle as much as we can.”
“Yes. Please.”
In the end, Hermione does wonder where Draco disappeared to, though her response when she finds them isn’t one of surprise. She only complains that they’re blocking the floo. But that’s all right, Harry thinks. She can apparate home.
She allows a small smile. A loud sound suspiciously like a crash comes from somewhere in the background. She tosses a look in the direction of it. “ROSE,” she bellows. To Harry: “I have to go. You’re fine. I’m fine. We’re fine. If you’re going to apologize to anyone, apologize to Draco Malfoy. You said some not very nice things to him, as well, you know.”
Harry worked his fist over Malfoy’s cock, entranced. Malfoy was so hard, his skin so soft and so slick with precome. He noted every squeeze and twist that drew a reaction from Malfoy and repeated each until Malfoy was mewling desperately and digging his nails into Harry’s back.
“Ground fairies,” Ginny said. “Ground fairy mounds.” She set her bags down and took an Emitter from one.
“Harry!” she said, cheeks flushed and hair wild, but smiling. “Bill! How are things going?”
It is half past four when Harry steps through Malfoy’s floo. He’s come straight over as quickly as he could without drawing attention. He had the report done by noon and spent the rest of the day going through more files on Poesy Potions to fill in the time before delivering the report to Robards at half past three, partly to keep himself out of Robards’ sight until shortly before leaving, and partly to keep himself from contacting Malfoy or Hermione in the middle of his work day at the Ministry. He had not, however, been able to abstain from running some reconnaissance and learning that it was Malfoy’s solicitor who had managed to postpone the hearing. Harry hid in his office for the rest of the day mostly so no one would be able to read the relief on his face.
have bought that when I was twelve, Potter. Do you mean to insult my intelligence, or does it just come naturally?”
Harry bristled. “Malfoy!”
“You what?”
“Exploding snap, Potter. Surely you haven’t forgotten how to play?”
Malfoy was just visible in the dim light, holding his broom. A thrill sizzled over Harry.
Ginny offered to serve something called “lime electuary” along with blackberry pie and ice cream—apparently, this was some kind of tradition after ground fairy removal; Harry only half-heard the explanation—but he begged off to take a shower. He didn’t wait to hear what Malfoy had to say about refreshments.
Pots were stacked near the work table. Next to them stood a wheelbarrow filled with potting soil. The air above the wheelbarrow shimmered lightly, and Draco belatedly remembered the shield charm he’d placed over it so the soil wouldn’t get soaked by the rain. Wincing, he covertly cast a
The grizzled man nods. “Minister.”
“Don’t worry, I won’t tarnish your sparkling image of Gryffindor morality,” Malfoy says, and Harry can’t tell if he’s being serious or sarcastic. “Bathroom is

There’s Malfoy: Malfoy standing down Hills and Bate with cool aplomb, as if he hadn’t been rattled out of bed before he’d had his morning tea. Malfoy allowing Harry to act as his proxy in the search so he wouldn’t have to watch the aurors pry apart his life. Malfoy trying to pry
Harry thoughtfully scratched through the rest of his sweet and sour chicken, and mopped up the remaining sauce with a soggy chip. “What do you reckon the Chinese food is like there?”
Coffee cup in hand, he walked down one of the paths. As he went, he scanned the ground around the planters and pots. He wasn’t sure why. There was nothing there to see. The pots were empty and chipped; the borders along the pathway were covered with bare dirt. Only when he spotted a discarded glass globe decoration—and he felt a jolt of excitement—did he realize he was looking for eggs.
With a calm nod, Malfoy stands and raises his wand. The magic of the wards lifts around them. But Harry doesn’t miss the way Malfoy’s hand shakes.
Draco put down the jar of tea and leaned over the sink, peering hard out the window.
Ginny glanced around the room. “It all is.”
. Like pure laughter.
Ginny whacked his arm with her wand. “Come on. It’s hurting me to look at you. Have you had any caffeine yet?”
Harry’s own breathing hitched.
“Well, yeah. They’re not coming here. Ginny says it’s hell for them to take a holiday, need to find someone to house sit and feed all the animals.”
“Draco hasn’t returned my owls today,” she says, voice low. It’s not quite a question.
“Er,” Harry said, realizing this was the first time he’d spoken to anyone here besides his friends, and found himself inexplicably nervous. “What would I ask for if I just wanted a coffee, about that tall?” He pointed to the medium-sized cup on display.
Harry rubs a hand over his face.
He took it cautiously and stepped through behind her.
you do in your off time?” Harry asked, and was gratified when Malfoy turned his attention to him.
“She’s discharging me properly,” he says, unable to help his defensive tone. “Really, Hermione.”
“Unicorn hair wasn’t always so popular,” Luna said, and segued into a short history of wand cores.
Alive. The news should reassure, but tension steals through him.
Inside, he cast a drying spell over his person and stood next to the fire. He declined to have a third shower. He wanted his tea and toast and to feel marginally human again.
“It’s pretty simple, Malfoy. I was hit by a curse and a potion. We were on a case looking into illegal brewing. You might have heard of that sort of thing? There was a wand fight, and I was hit by a curse. The barrel of potion next to me was hit as well, and I was doused. It was one of the experimental ones we were investigating the brewer for, so we don’t know what it was. We don’t know the spell that hit me, either.
“I guess we’re no one, then.”
“Good thing I’m not.”
Malfoy glanced up at their approach. His eyes flicked over Ginny and Luna and found Harry’s.
He catches himself reaching for the floo powder and stops short of dipping his hand in the jar.
“Harry—wait!”
Harry’s eyes kept moving. Looking. Though he felt silly. Of
Malfoy shrugged.
“Do you have any potions for relaxing muscles? Because I’m going to need it tomorrow.”
Alex follows his gaze and huffs. “Shit. Sorry.”
It’s evening by now. Harry called her late in the morning, soon after returning from the Ministry with his box of things and the case file which Harry couldn’t look at without Hermione’s little mirror.
“It is. You’re welcome.”
Although there was no reason for Harry to feel winded, he sounded breathless as he said, “I was helping Luna on the farm and lost track of the time.”
“No. I still know where it is. Don’t let me take you away from your work.”
His shoulders itch with the feeling of being watched as he approaches the door. But the lacy curtains on the windows remain still. The bronze door knocker features a cat holding a violin and bow. The words
“Let me think. An Erumpent. A Thunderbird. A small herd of white bison.”
Harry nodded, swallowed. Now he felt silly for making any kind of deal over this. “Just open it, why don’t you?”
of your magic has been redirected from your lungs through practice and—I dare say—pure strength of will, but the new channels are fragile. Your core still wants to move through your airways. In an emergency situation, in the field if you must cast quickly…”
“Remembered I exist, did you?”
“You’re beautiful like this,” he growled. “Look at you, taking my cock like you were made for it. Do you fuck yourself on your fingers and dream of me, Malfoy? Have you been saving it for me?”
There is a tension in the air. Harry takes a deep breath and asks the question, “Will I be good to return to active duty?”
“Um.”
“We’re not going to kill them,” Ginny said, “but we are going to make things extremely uncomfortable for them.”
?” he asks, glancing at Hermione.
Harry hadn’t experienced resistance before this because Malfoy had been feeding him lies. Of course. He wasn’t an Unspeakable—how had Harry believed that?—but he was a gifted occlumens.
He gnawed on his pen for a few more minutes, trying to ignore them, then sighed, placed the coffee and pastry half-finished into the bin, and left the coffee shop.
Harry immediately begins to list.
“A potion.”
Technically Harry was done with his morning egg collection round, but the truth was, it was never over at the farm. He was cleaning the remnants of a late breakfast from the patio table when he spotted a little pink egg in a plant pot.
“Do you use it?”
“Harry. Wait.” Malfoy was out of breath and tousled.
Then, he was fucking Harry, the hot drag of his cock hitting Harry’s prostate with every thrust. He was so
“Thanks.”
“Not much,” Harry says.
The cupboard he’d come through looked like another part of the room, the coats all lined up on their bar. He hovered next to it for a moment, still half tempted to take Luna up on the offer of company. But he closed the door and sat down in one of the chairs by the stove.
The other man crosses his arms over his chest. “We’ll do it nowhere. Let me see that.”
A long, drawn-out silence. Then: “You seemed to like the cheering well enough when you won a game.”
Arriving, he just managed not to puke on the floor of the terminal. The Portkey across the Atlantic had been bad enough, then he’d had to make a second jump with a stomach weak from the first. He was grateful he’d followed Ron’s advice and hadn’t eaten during his hour-long layover in New Jersey. He hadn’t wanted to mark his first appearance on Oregon soil by offering up a half-digested burger and chips.
The door screeched and shuddered, and for a moment Harry thought that Malfoy
“Excuse me?”
“Ron tells me you’re planning on renovating the old bat cave,” Ginny said between bites.
“Holy shit.” Malfoy propped himself up on an elbow. “You’re not telling me that I took the Saviour’s gay cherry? Wait. How long have you even known?”
“Hi, Potter,” Malfoy said slowly.
Hermione bites her lip.
“I think Robards is just done with this case,” Harry says. They both look at him, and he adds, “It’s been going on for months. I think someone else in the Ministry is pressuring him.”
Potter scowled. “Sorry, Malfoy. Not everyone has the ability to tune out of the world for eight hours a night. I’ve been awake for months. I’m fidgety. Deal with it.”
Harry’s chest was tight. “You want me to—”
with his and Hermione’s article. “Oh.”
Malfoy laughed. His hand shot out, caught a gleam of gold. He pulled up sharply, and Harry realized he was hurtling toward the ground.
They all moved a little further into the entryway. From here, Harry could see one of the windows of the sitting room was open, the view almost completely taken up by a half-wild-looking rose bush.
Harry took a slice of the bread and spread a generous helping of butter on it, slowly, thinking.
“Hold on. I haven’t yet finished counting my body parts.”
“Right,” Harry said. “That was wrong of me, what I did.”
“All right. What happened between you two?”
“That’s the food bank.”
Harry made a helpless noise.
“What? Oh.” Harry took a drink of his beer. “I do like this one.”
He freed Harry’s cock, ducked to swallow his length in one graceful movement.
Harry was wrong. That voice isn’t pleasant. It’s honeyed poison, and he’s just noticed the warning bitter bite of it. He wishes he had a better response for the question, but he’s bad at lying in a good moment, and in this one, he’s full of caffeine and alcohol. “Things didn’t work out, and I never met anyone else I’m interested in.” Then, swinging his gaze back to Malfoy’s, he says, “And what about you? No white-haired Malfoy snakelings slithering about, I notice.”
“The basics” involved having Harry pour several plain coffees and adding whipped cream to the tops of the fancier drinks that Malfoy prepared. Malfoy stopped Harry twice to correct his whipped cream skills, which—it was
“Yes…” Malfoy draws out the word.
“Not...quite.”
, Malfoy. Just give me what you served me yesterday, you dick. The coffee thing with fancy bits on top. And the bougie bread is fine, thanks.”
Which is how Harry found himself groping for his breakfast in straw-filled boxes, behind bags of feed, and—in one instance—inside of an open cat carrier. (That was one of the little pink eggs.)
“Sir,” Chesterfield said. “I thought you ought to know…”
She pulls away and mutters something. Harry catches the movement of her wand from the corner of his eye and feels the tremble of magic. A hazy cloud of blue-glowing smoke appears above him. She taps the center of his forehead lightly with the tip of her wand.
Outside the room, a healer’s name is called out overhead. A trolley rattles past the door.
Malfoy wanted to show Harry a museum, but it was closed when they arrived, which plunged Malfoy into a glowering mood. Harry demanded they get ice cream instead, then sidetracked them on a tour of the creamery, at which point Malfoy stopped glowering because he was sucked in by the sight of the machinery producing perfect blocks of cheese. He stared, and licked trails of melting ice cream from his cone, and Harry smirked and cast a little underhanded Stasis Charm on the ice cream.
“Oh, good,” she said, looking over the field. “You thought to mark them this time. It did get rather confusing last time when they swarmed and we lost track of the mounds.”
Malfoy looked predatory. He was enjoying this. Harry shouldn’t give him the satisfaction of a reaction, but he was dizzy and his mouth was dry. He couldn’t think straight. “Ah, no. I’ve never tried.”
Hermione doesn’t look convinced by Harry’s reply, but Ron comes to his rescue by bringing up muggle football, his newest fascination. Arthur got him into watching it over Christmas on Ron and Hermione’s old muggle TV, and now Ron goes off on indecipherable tangents that Harry can’t follow, filled with teams and players and rules he doesn’t recognize. He feels about as baffled as Hermione looks when he and Ron go off about Quidditch, and she sends him a wry grin. Ron doesn’t notice. He returns Hermione’s small smile but doesn’t try to derail Ron. Truthfully, he’s glad for the reprieve.
they were Muggle.) For that matter, did Malfoy live in a magical district? Or did he live in a Muggle home?
Harry choked. “Excuse me?”
“I’m not going to promise anything.”
“Something” is about the right word for it. Harry’s not sure what else to call the thing that has him spending half his nights in Draco’s bed, nearly every morning in his kitchen, and all of his evenings in the sitting room with him, or in his study while Draco pores over his books and Harry tries to come up to speed on his research (but mostly succeeds in dozing).
Malfoy’s eyes on him are warm with a restrained amusement, almost a fondness, and Harry has to swallow and look away.
“It is.”
“We have three of the brewers in the holding cells.”
His gaze met Harry’s. He abruptly ceased struggling. Blood from a split lip smeared his cheek. His black robes were torn at the collar and splattered with grey, as if by a spray of bleach. The regal mouth was frozen in a half snarl, half frown. The eyebrows were drawn together in a way that almost looked startled. But the grey irises were cutting.
This early in the morning, it would have been possible, though not easy, to obtain an expedited search warrant. It’s more likely that the warrant was obtained the evening before. In either case, Robards would have known yesterday about the impending search on Malfoy’s house and either didn’t tell Harry or sent a message which Harry didn’t receive.
While Malfoy spoke, he led Harry to the sitting room off the entrance hall. He sat neatly on an upholstered chair and placed his hands on his knees.
“Shit!” Harry said, and jammed the coffee pot in place. Then, he laughed at himself.
Draco straddled Harry’s lap. The look on his face sent a pang through Harry’s gut. Draco was still buttoned up, but his hair was in disarray.
“Forgery should be child’s play for you, Malfoy.”
Malfoy smiled flatly. “I wasn’t exactly revered in England, was I?”
Harry looked up. A silvery glowing jackrabbit fidgeted in place. Williams. Harry’s heart gave a great, painful beat. Soggy bread and chutney were forgotten.
In the memory, the two of them drink and play exploding snap, and Harry winces. It’s so obvious now. His own movement had been thick-fingered and fumbling, and he was hardly looking at the cards. He was looking at Malfoy’s hands.
“Dunno.” He flipped through the menu offerings. “Do they have cottage pie?” Because it was already on his mind.
. “Champion of the wizarding world. You—” He spread Harry’s shirt open and leaned forward to ghost his lips against Harry’s. Almost, but didn’t, press a kiss to them. Grinned. “—are not the bravest wizard alive. Certainly, you’re not the cleverest.”
Malfoy snorts. “No bother. You’ve been a very busy man, Auror Potter. Colliding with one’s conscience takes it out of a person.” But the snort, and the words, are without their usual edge. In the shifting shadows of the room, Malfoy’s face is softer.
The seething water and the tang of salt churned up old memories: sea cliffs and cold spray and Dumbledore. The Inferi belonged to another lifetime, but they lurked there under the black lake in Harry’s mind.
“Only you, Malfoy.”
Molly lowered her wand and attempted to smooth her hair back. “How about some ham sandwiches?”
Even at Luna and Ginny’s, he had the niggling sense of needing to do something, anything, even if it was to go on a long walk.
“That
The waiter held out his hand, and Malfoy handed over the menu. He hadn’t even looked at it. “Mushroom risotto with the rosemary chicken breast,” he said, smoothly.
He skirted the edge of the memories of Malfoy’s torture this time. He was reminded of the way Malfoy had carefully navigated his childhood trauma.
. This was— He spared a single, fleeting thought for his teenage self and what he would think of himself right now. He would have barked a hysterical laugh, only he couldn’t because it felt
Harry felt his face flame. “The actual baking? It was okay.”
“Oh, no. We usually have volunteers. They come and go. And Draco comes by.”
As Harry took it, their fingers brushed. Harry’s gaze flickered over Malfoy’s face, but Malfoy’s expression didn’t change. He looked tired and pinched and amused.
Andromeda was surprised to see him the next morning.
Malfoy smirked, though it was soft. “That’s what you have me for.”
Harry smirked. “I have to say, I never imagined us in this position. I always wondered what went on in that head of yours.”
Harry scrabbled for a moment, fingers scraping for purchase as the riptide of Malfoy’s thoughts dragged him out and out.
Casually, Malfoy said, “You’re not half-bad at sucking cock.”
Harry frowned. “It looks like it’s been cursed.” He’d seen enough of the symptoms in his line of work, including more than one case in which a witch or wizard had poisoned a Muggle’s food crop. This kind of crime fell under the jurisdiction of the regular magical patrol, but occasionally he’d been sent as an Auror liaison, usually when Robards was annoyed with him.
to move, or he would die.
Harry hangs back while Malfoy goes to the door, leaning on the stair banister.
“It’s a possibility,” he said. “It did belong to Sirius, but he hated it. And it was the Order’s headquarters, but that’s been disbanded since the war. No reason not to look for somewhere else in London, or maybe out in the countryside. Somewhere I could go for a fly.”
Oh. Right. And she might be worried about
dusted with flour. He looked up. Smiled at the customer across the counter. Handed a coffee cup over.
The woman with the purple-streaked hair didn’t bat an eye. “In the back. He’s bringing some stuff out.”
Malfoy watches him as if waiting for the rest of the sentence. When Harry doesn’t finish the thought, he says, “What did you
Harry shakes that thought off, too. He focuses on the letters. Standing over the shoulder of his memory self, he pauses the scene to examine the first missive—properly, this time. He is dismayed to note that the letter is in the same ivory parchment the Ministry uses for all of its official documents. The broken seal is in the Ministry’s purple wax. Harry knows he was being a prat. The letter
Hermione’s eyelid gives a twitch, perhaps at his supercilious tone, and Harry feels a pang of fear—for Malfoy. The man holds himself very still and there is a
Harry opened his mouth to decline, but Luna looked so happy at the prospect. Also, Ginny was sending him a pointedly warning look. The words dried up on his tongue.
, Malfoy thought, with a tinge of impatience and laughter that had an edge. Not quite cruel, but not kind.
In his tipsy state, Harry was so thankful for the intervention that he leaned forward to kiss her cheek, which caused Ginny to shriek and Luna to demand her girlfriend back. Luna was laughing while she shouted, but she did sound a bit serious about it.
“I—okay.”
Harry gave a smile and turned toward the door.
Harry didn’t tell Malfoy that, whatever expression was on his face, it had nothing to do with criticizing Malfoy’s idea to cast the lights. He shook his head to clear it. “No. That’s a brilliant idea,” he said, and cast his own ball of light. It was pale golden in color and rose to circle around Malfoy’s before drifting in another direction.
Harry scowls. It feels good to scowl. “What? And you’re not? I suppose you have a house-elf keep up your home?”
Harry took a slower sip from Malfoy’s glass—longer than was strictly polite—and licked a stray drop from the rim before setting it back down. “Porter. They add single origin coffee beans.”
was useless.
to have been taking the piss. Though he wouldn’t expect it from Luna, she
been angry.
“No,” Ginny said. “Harry was just about to tell us what he was thinking of getting.”
Grey eyes gleamed at him with a challenge that sent a thrill through Harry.
“Then don’t.”
“No. I didn’t think so. Charge first, ask later. That’s the Gryffindor creed, isn’t it.”
“Oh. Right. No. What about…making a hole in them?”
Harry puts the casserole dish away. Then he makes a pot of tea to have something to do with his hands and takes it into the drawing room to curl up on the sofa.
Malfoy teased with the tip of his tongue. “What’s not fair?”
He dabbed his fingers into it and rubbed it over his arms, which only served to remind him of Malfoy’s forearms and the tone his muscles must have had. He made a frustrated noise in his throat.
“A Brewmaster’s Beer, please,” he said, proud that he could smoothly give his own drink order.
Malfoy sits up once more, his back straight. He lifts teacup and saucer to his mouth. Takes a long sip of tea while staring at Harry.
—made him turn his head in time to see Edward approaching the venomous tentacula. It’d been defanged, but the spiky mass of tentacles would still lash out if approached.
“The chocolate chips,” Malfoy said. He looked up irritably from the floating mass of flour in front of him. “My magic is good, Potter, but I doubt even Merlin could measure dry ingredients and Summon things at the same time.”
“Malfoy,” Ginny said, and—to Harry’s further surprise—bent down for her own quick hug, which Malfoy returned with a dry, but fond, “Weasley.”
After breakfast, she took him on the promised tour of the house, which involved looking into a lot of cupboards; Luna hadn’t been joking about the magical rooms. The non-magical rooms—which were behind normal-looking doors—held the same decorative touches as the magical ones, though they were more reasonably sized. Luna also showed him a room dedicated to knitting, a small reading room (“The libraries are in the basement”), a room with a TV, and a room filled with jars of dried herbs and blocks of beeswax, with beakers and bowls sitting about. The room smelled pungent but also a bit like honey. A little door at the end of the room led them to the shaded patio that they typically ate on. They exited through an archway dripping with green beans and wound their way through the vegetable garden.
“Hmmmm.” Malfoy makes a big show of thinking about it, and Harry feels faint and but also thrilled because he knows, he
She sits and scrolls through the pages. He goes back to his chopping, more relaxed now that Hermione is absorbed in scanning the case file.
“You’re being distracting,” Malfoy said at one point, and parked Harry at the till to take orders, which Harry did not point out was probably a worse mistake than leaving him on barista duty.
looking at him like he’s an idiot, and so he says, “Mind if I come over? Not—as an auror, or even to talk about the case, unless you want to. Not that I don’t care about it. I just.”
Hermione frowns. Glances at the clock—both the real one and the one next to it with her, Ron, and Harry’s names. Ron’s hand is still pointed at “Work.”
“Job shadowing!” Parkinson exclaimed. “Do tell.”
She’s always had that sixth sense. She’s always been able to see right through him.
Harry hesitated, but Malfoy sounded very sure, and Harry couldn’t help but be a little selfish, so he sneaked into the kitchen for a couple of the ales Ginny kept in the fridge.
Harry is on his way back to his desk when an idea strikes him.
Malfoy moaned against him again.
about?”
“I shouldn’t have stormed off like that earlier. Can I come through?”
Softly—until he turned like a shark, still hunting, sleek and determined. He darted forward, and then he was watching Harry meet Malfoy in Madam Malkin’s. He examined Harry’s vague contempt for 11-year-old Malfoy.
He’s relieved that the hearing wasn’t held, of course. Relieved that Hermione could help, after all. Of course he’s relieved.
Malfoy got in beside him, and they made their way up the bumpy drive to the little road that led to the motorway. Harry couldn’t look away from Malfoy’s hands on the wheel, where they rested so casually, with their tendons and knuckles, thumbs hooked around the wheel.
Harry lowers his arms. He’s no longer leaning against the doorway. He’s standing just inside the room. The corner of the paper brushes the ground. Abruptly, he forgets why he’s here. Maybe he didn’t know to begin with. He knows he shouldn’t stalk out of here, not like he did that night from Malfoy’s kitchen, but he has nothing else to say. And his breathing is getting tight, his chest clenching ominously.
Another movement caught his eye, and he looked up. “Oh.”
“Pansy?”
Silence in the court.
“How are you enjoying your IPA, Harry?” Luna said, turning to him sometime later.
He was still puzzling over that when another thought occurred to him.
He stares at her, his hand frozen in his hair.
Harry doesn’t say a thing. He waits out Robards’ display of anger, hoping Robards won’t direct any questions to him because he’s not sure what will come out of his mouth. He’s tired and buzzing.
A bunch of tiny multicolored frogs leaped into the pathway, and Harry paused so they could pass. Two children playing by the fountain squealed at the sight of them and crouched down to watch them hop and bobble toward the fountain’s edge, where the frogs leaped to the lip of the fountain in a spray of color. The children laughed and thrust their hands out to catch the frogs (they didn’t succeed) or to help them. A couple of straggling frogs used their hands as a step up and disappeared over the edge of the fountain.
A chill lances through Harry.
“Yeah. You made a good suggestion. I even made them different colors so we’d know where to aim.”
Malfoy told Harry more stories about his first experiences in non-magical America, and on the farm, and navigating the magical culture in Portland. In a way, it had been easier than continuing on in England—starting fresh where no one knew him. Luna had been an incredibly sweet tour guide, though her notions of how non-magical culture worked hadn’t been much better than his at the time. Neither had Pansy’s, though she’d had a way of bluffing her way through almost any situation. Ginny had picked things up the easiest and had been his best teacher, when she wasn’t laughing at him.
Sometime after sunrise, he must have fallen asleep on the sofa in the drawing room because the next thing he knows, he is waking to noise and green light, and he surges to his feet, looking for the emergency.
He walked up the stairs to his bedroom, stood in the doorway staring at the rumpled covers on his bed, then turned and walked down again.
He runs a thumb over the words beneath the name.
Harry didn’t know what else to say, so he pocketed his card and took the number to a corner table with a view of the entire shop, the street outside, and Malfoy working behind the counter.
Malfoy’s voice was mocking, but there was something else in it, something playful and warm. The side of his hand gently pressed against the side of Harry’s on the ground.
Instead, those unwavering eyes blink, and then one shoulder lifts in a shrug. “I don’t know. Volunteering for the job, Potter?”
Harry wonders, briefly, if that’s why he came over: to start something—an argument, a debate—with Malfoy. He decides he didn’t, shakes the tension out of his shoulders, and says, “Are you going to offer me a drink?”
In reality, they’d never made it quite to the rock. There was nothing to see when it was that dark, so they’d turned back to the car. But now, they stopped near its base, and Malfoy tugged Harry’s hand, drawing him close.
At that, Harry made the sharp wand movement. “
Harry pauses.
“Malfoy,” he said, glancing around the large space filled with racks of dough and milk and vegetables and meats. “Are you using Wizard Space…to keep food?”
“No one you know.”
Merlin, give Harry strength.
“Sir,” he says. This time, his voice holds a note of irritation.
“No problem,” Malfoy said, but his eyes remained cool. He was so remote—so removed from his usual smirking, teasing person—that Harry was taken aback.
“Yeah. You know, born like that.”
“What do you want?” Malfoy said.
“Is that it?” Harry said.
So Curse-Breaking was probably out for Harry.
This time, Malfoy levitated the trays into the ovens himself, glancing at the large clock above them as he did so and casting a number of Tempus Charms to float over each. The trays went in smoothly, as if they were good friends settling into place together in a well-rehearsed play. It hit Harry at that moment, watching Malfoy’s look of concentration and the fine shimmer of sweat on his face, that Malfoy did this every morning. Surely he had someone to help him, though? Perhaps another wizard or witch?
“I can appreciate the history without appreciating the flavor.” He shot Malfoy a warning look before picking up the last of the glasses. It looked…promising. A bright golden color. He ignored the looks of his friends—Ginny’s gleaming eyes, Luna’s expectant smile, Malfoy’s faint smirk—and took a drink. It was easier to ignore them now that he was starting to feel a little warm. He rolled the beer around in his mouth before swallowing.
“You’re the worst,” Harry told her.
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed as if he were attempting to identify an insult in Harry’s words—though Harry was being sincere, so wished him luck with that.
“Turkey eggs. That sounds unique, Luna.”
“No,” Malfoy said. “A potter.”
Maybe next week.
He headed back toward his house, still woefully devoid of caffeine, but plenty full of adrenaline, with an empty stomach and a handful of cheese. He was mud-splattered and probably smelled faintly of goat. And why had he thought it would be charming to move to the country? Ah, yes. For the
“What
Malfoy squeezed past the woman with the purple-streaked hair to scoop a pastry from the glass case with a pair of tongs. He served that to a customer along with a tall ceramic mug topped with whipped cream. Next was a cup of tea. A sandwich with a cone of chips. A cardboard tray of coffees to go.
As he waited for his second round, he had to sit with no food and no beer and try not to stare at Malfoy balling a napkin and dabbing casually at his mouth while he talked to Ginny.
Malfoy gave a decisive nod. “All right, then.”
“How long?”
He took the chest downstairs and set it on the floor in the sitting room. Then he poured a glass of Firewhiskey.
for dramatic effect—before shoving it open.
Draco tapped his quill against the page and quelled his rising irritation. “Yes. In fact, it does, Potter. If they had a license to produce potions from certified formulas, they’ll have had access to approved ingredients suppliers. If they didn’t, they would have used a different supply chain. Not to mention their setup would be drastically different in both cases. Do you really know nothing about the cases you’re investigating?”
“Look at you,” Malfoy whispered, and claimed Harry’s mouth.
So he measured out the loose leaf and pulled down a plate and scowled at the fire that roared to life in the hearth, as if the house were happy now that Draco was up.
The only question remained: stop by the fish and chip shop on the way home—he was tiring of it, but it was open late—or stop by Ron and Hermione’s with a hangdog expression? Conveniently for him, they nearly always kept leftovers, a fact which Harry tried not to look at too closely. Ron insisted Harry was always welcome over, but Harry had caught them on their way to bed more than once, and not always to
“I mean—yeah, yeast was involved.”
He checked the wards, but they didn’t indicate the presence of a wizard.
“What makes you think I want anything? Maybe you weren’t raised with manners, but I was, and I am not about to let you go running off like a tear-streaked maiden from a Regency novel.”
Harry smoothed it down—in vain, of course. “Leave my hair out of it, thanks. At least I don’t wear it slicked like an eleven-year-old git.”
“Oh. Right.” Harry takes the bag. He has the image of Hermione scuttling from the room, weighted down with an armful of books, eyes glazed and unfocused. Inexplicably, that makes him feel a little better about being left. “I’ll just. Leave by floo. If you don’t mind.”
“What’s it like being with Luna?”
“Stakes?”
“Thestrals,” he said, unable to help the shiver that traveled over his scalp.
After a time, he throws a pinch of powder into the floo and calls out another address.
Harry knocks but doesn’t wait before opening the door. Robards looks up. His eyes widen a fraction before his expression darkens. His mouth opens, but Harry heads him off.
Later, as Harry helped Luna tuck the chickens in for the night, she said, “I’m glad you had fun today, Harry. It’s too bad you’re not very good at making hats, but Sophie said he wouldn’t mind if you showed up at the shop again tomorrow. He says you have excellent people skills.”
Malfoy watched him carefully with too-bright eyes. Harry’s heart raced.
“What makes you think that
“Charming,” Malfoy drawled. “Come on, Potter. This way. Before you break one of my coffee machines simply by existing too close to them.”
Harry nudges Draco’s foot under the table and gives him a wink. He thought he was being subtle, but Hermione raises an eyebrow at him. Later, when he leans in to bump shoulders with Draco and ask if he’d like more wine, he glances up to find Ron giving him an appraising look.
“Try not to flood the shop.”
His finger slid in deeper, to the knuckle. Burning. Sliding.
Harry scowls. “That’s rich, coming from you.”
If the situation weren’t so serious, the fact that they are covered in glitter would be comical.
“That must have been exciting reading,” Malfoy drawls in a voice dry enough to crunch underfoot.
A thin band of sunlight cut across his skin, highlighting the silver Sectumsempra scars in its path. Harry was tempted to brush his thumb over them and feel if they were as raised as they looked, but he didn’t want to wake Malfoy. He swallowed tightly, remembering blood and thinking of how bad the wounds must have been, that they had scarred. He
and he can’t spend another minute in the cramped DMLE suite—and politely requests the files he needs.
“Yes…”
The brewery was pleasant enough, filled with huge barrels and bags of grain and smells of malt and something fruity. No non-magical machinery here. The brew space was done all in mismatched woods that Charlie told him were reclaimed from old buildings in Europe, which is where she’d taken the brewing methods from, as well.
Ginny slapped his hand away. Luna said, “It’s not. Don’t worry. It looks very nice on you.” Her eyes laughed at him.
“Well, thanks to you, I’m no longer an auror.”
Harry is thrown by the biting reference to his old house. Before he can react, Malfoy turns on his heel and steps into a sitting room off the front hall. Harry hurries after him.
The kettle was just beginning to chuckle as the water heated when Draco heard the rattle of a familiar engine coming up the drive. Sighing, he dumped the loose leaf back into its jar and took the canister of coffee out of a high cabinet. Draco did not like coffee. But some of his customers did, this one in particular. He poured the grounds into the cafetière, poured the water over them, and set it aside to steep. He added a generous helping of sugar and milk into his biggest mug and went to get the door, wondering if this was why the house had woken him early, if this was the reason for the feeling of
you, I’m sure.”
“Thanks, Luna. That sounds great.”
Harry glanced at the clock. He had some time before he was supposed to meet Malfoy at the coffee shop. And why his stomach should do a flip-flop, he didn’t know. Well. Granted, it had been incredibly good sex. And—well, not that he expected a repeat performance, but he couldn’t discount that it was a possibility. That is. It was a possibility for Harry. If Malfoy—
“Tosser,” Harry said.
“No, this is fine.” He put his feet up.
Luna didn’t seem to notice Harry’s discomfort. She settled next to Harry on the grass. “Not wanting to wake that early is understandable. A baker’s schedule is not for everyone. Don’t worry, though. I’ve got something else I think you’ll enjoy.”
, Potter. Really. We’ve said everything we need to each other through letters. Merlin’s saggy balls. Is this what your friends have had to put up with? I swear you’re a more dangerous friend than enemy.”
Then the ground under his feet and the air around him trembled, and the fairies blasted away, screaming. The summer sun once more flooded over him.
Harry shrugs. “Sure. Why not?”
“What?”
Harry lets out a long sigh. “I don’t know. Which one would I like?”
In the end, Luna left a haphazard stack of books next to her seat in the sitting area and concluded that they were missing some information.
He feels a moment of frustration at himself that he let someone sneak up on him, followed by a pang of grief and apology for his friends. He closes his eyes.
The garden is bathed in silver moonlight. Harry can just make out the shapes of the pots and trees. A little iron bench sits not far from the door, enclosed on four sides by a trellis of vines. The air smells of night jasmine and lavender.
“Not that it should be of any interest to you, since you can’t eat any of it.” Draco crossed his arms.
“Hm?”
“Actually—yeah.” After the dirty chai experience, Harry was all for sticking with something he knew. He handed over his card. “Where’s Malfoy?”
, but he shook his head.
One of the goats lifted her tail and dropped a load of pellets onto the ground.
“Want some company?” Ginny asked, pausing the film.
“What is with you and my dishwasher?”
“It’s beautiful,” Harry said.
He feels a flash of guilt. “How’s Ron?”
“So… No tea and no brandy. But…pastries? Or do these not exist for twats who throw around insults and stomp off through the floo?”
“Ah. I see.” But he didn’t.
Robards regards him with his stony demeanor. “The
“I know. I know. But, Harry, please take a moment to think about it. What was Robards’ reaction to the canceled hearing today? You’re not— Well, you’re not very good at pretending to feel something you aren’t.”
He thinks about that, sometimes. People who know the truth about what happened in the Forbidden Forest—like Hermione and Ron and Ginny—insist that he was brave for facing his death. He knows the truth. He was simply resigned. There was no other way. He had no choice. Not like Malfoy.  Malfoy could turn away from all of this at any time, could live a quiet, pleasant life in his cottage, donating anonymously to charities and allowing the polluted water to be someone else’s problem. But he isn’t. He’s determined and passionate and doggedly stubborn.
with each other when they didn’t have to report to the office together in the morning, Harry with hot coffee and Draco with fresh pastries, and talk about their latest cases and office gossip.
As Draco set the box down in the truck, Edward said, “The directions?”—which they’d left in the house—and Draco spent another minute assuring Edward he’d grab the paper himself,
Malfoy walked into the fridge. Harry stepped cautiously inside behind him and cast a discreet Warming Charm. For a fridge, it was large, about the size of a utility room. Malfoy strolled through the back wall and disappeared. Harry braced himself—he didn’t trust Malfoy not to lead him into a solid wall, unlike Luna—and strode through it after him.
off chance that Teddy decided it was a great idea to sneak into Draco’s lab at Christmas time—was a book. It was slightly lumpy, and it creaked whenever it was opened because it was hand-and-magic-crafted and neither of them had ever made anything remotely like this before.
“Honestly, you two!” Parkinson said.
At that thought, he cracked open his eyes. They stung in the chill.
Draco had absolutely no idea what to say to that. So he sniffed and drank his tea.
Ginny shoved a big bite of salad into her mouth.
“I know.
“Would you have eaten from my hand? Done tricks?
“Really, Potter. Were you born that self-centered, or is it a side effect of the fame? One wonders.”
“Captain hit it one too many times.”
One chest was locked with a newer ward, and the magical signature felt familiar. Intrigued, and despite his lingering giddiness from the cursed dolls, he spent some time undoing it. It was a tricky little spell, but somehow, he felt like he knew how to pull it apart. At the last moment, he erected a hasty Shield Charm, but the ward gave way with no more than a gentle pop of air, and the lid of the chest creaked open.
Harry sighs. This is more of what he’d been expecting when he came this afternoon. “Listen, Malfoy…”
Harry didn’t know what feelings to replace them with, what should go in their place. The man behind the counter was neither the boy Harry had loathed in school, nor the beat-down, terrified young man he remembered from the courtroom. Harry recognized some of the boy in him, though—in the quick Seeker’s movements, the occasional smirk and the more frequent genuine smile.
Harry’s heart sped up. He was a little warm and loose from the beer, so had to pause a moment, holding his breath, before he said, “I’d love it, but I’m leaving back to England in a few days.”
— Xeno
“What do you mean, the hearing’s been canceled?” Harry says.
.” But he laughed, despite himself. He put a hand to his mouth, startled and ill and buzzing.
And he strides to the floo with Hermione’s small, “
Hermione hasn’t said the words out loud, but Harry knows she thinks he should find a different career, that staying with the aurors is not practical, is in fact probably making him miserable. They are on their second bottle of wine tonight, and Harry still hasn’t told them about the field assignment he was placed on, nor that his subject is Draco Malfoy.
“Going to fuck you now,” Harry said as he lined up, and then pushed inside.
“You knew,” he says, looking at Malfoy, who regards him coolly. He releases Hermione and runs a hand through his hair. He looks between them. “All weekend. Before that, even. While I—”
They stood in a loose circle around the tree. To Harry’s surprise, Malfoy stood directly to his right, and Parkinson took up a spot between Ginny and Luna. He tried not to be distracted by Malfoy as Luna gave them directions for softening the summer-hard soil and removing the roots of the tree, but he couldn’t help but track the movement of Malfoy lifting a hand to push back his windblown hair every so often from the corner of his eye.
Malfoy lifts his glass in a dangling grip to his mouth. He smirks over the rim. “I’ll take that as a maybe.”
Harry blinks. “Thanks. I think. There wasn’t much chance of dodging it, considering I jumped in the way.”
It only occurred to him a few minutes later that the soup was already chilled.
“Harry?”
“I’m not backing out of this,” past-Harry says to past-Draco.
“Hmmm.”
A gentle sound of chimes sparkles in the air. Her alarm. “Oooo!” Hermione groans, eyebrows crinkling in consternation. “Harry, you don’t want to lose your job. Damn! I’ve really got to go.” She darts forward and pecks a kiss on Harry’s cheek. Then she’s scurrying to the floo.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes. “You had that dirty chai.”
Muzzy with wine and a full stomach, Harry lets his thoughts drift to Malfoy. No matter how he looks at it, it has to be a trick.
“And restaurants.”
“If it’s really that much of a trial, I’ll teach you how to bake.”
. He’d tripped over the bucket of fish emulsion and molasses.
“No,” Malfoy breathed, in disbelief. He’d followed Harry inside, and the sound of his voice so close sent shivers over Harry.
The room looked organized but well-used. Draco gave silent thanks for the extra time he’d spent cleaning the grand mess from the week before. Though, many implements were still down out of the cabinets within easy reach. Bowls, ladles, thermometers, stirring rods, and funnels: all the tools needed in the muggle art of remedy-making. Boxes packed with jars of salve and bottles of tincture lined the side wall, now stacked three high. Draco had spent the winter making the preparations from herbs he’d harvested earlier in the season. Draco liked the satisfaction of filling empty jars with medicine, and then empty boxes with full jars, and he liked the exhaustion that came with long hours spent at quiet tasks, but he was ready to be done bending over the tables, pouring and measuring. He was ready to spend his days in the garden.
Harry stares at his distorted reflection in the tea. He had only wanted to bring attention to the corruption in the Ministry in the most impactful way he could at the time. Because…because that was the only thing he could do. That’s it. There’s nothing else he can do. He has nothing else to offer. Just his so-called fame. For months now, in fact, he’s had nothing to give. Hermione was right. He was miserable at the office; the paperwork he did could be completed by a trained troll. Except trolls had better things to do.
“Haystack Rock and Thor’s Well,” Luna said. “They’re very nice, aren’t they? Draco has a lot of nice artwork. He’s collected it from all over Oregon. A lot of artists live here.”
“Well, I did find you.”
“I’m fine, Malfoy,” Harry said, but was secretly relieved when Malfoy cast several preservation and protection spells over their baking setup.
A file sits in his inbox. Harry stares at it a moment and then lets out a soft laugh, rubs a hand over his mouth.
He leaves Harry’s door open. Harry stares through it at the bulletin board with its waving, winking photographs, animated notes, and the little doodle of the panda eating the words from office memos and shitting a line of broken poetry. With a sigh, Harry stands and closes it.
And he enjoyed working with Ginny. After an hour or two of instruction, he fell into easy sync with her. It struck him that they were more relaxed than they’d ever been when they were dating. He liked it. He’d
Malfoy bucked again. Harry’s heart raced. He knew where this would lead, and he looked forward to it. But also—he’d never before sucked cock. Not that he intended to let that stop him.
“Did you know the Ministry has been
“You really mean it,” Malfoy said, in wonder.
Slowly, Harry lifted his head. He felt bad about looking closer, but he couldn’t not.
here. We fold. Like so.”
The bus arrived in a billow of heat, and its doors hissed open. Harry climbed up behind Malfoy and fumbled at the pay machine for his card, only for the bus driver to tell him, “Your friend already paid.”
Then he was pushing Harry away. Harry looked up at Malfoy’s wild expression.
Harry looked at the mug topped with whipped cream. “I ordered a coffee.”
“It’s kind of fun, Harry. Would you like to try it on?”
He looked at the plate of food the waiter handed him, and nearly said,
Harry came to stand next to him and crossed his arms. “Spy.” The word made his stomach twist a bit.
The water lapped gently at the shore. They were along an inlet, not the ocean side, looking across the water at buildings on the near-distant shore. Gulls perched on the wooden pilings out on the water. The air had a sharp tang.
“Next week is going to be busy,” Harry says. He has to look away from Draco before the expression on the other man’s face opens him up and Draco can see all of
“I guess not. No.”
There is not a thing about Poesy Potions here. Every book, every paper—even his own research—is gone, and not just gone but cleaned out as neatly as if it never existed.
Most painful of all was the fact that he still desired Malfoy. Even now, despite the invasion, longing clawed at him. His walls were down, nothing to contain it. It burned in his body along with the shame, all mixed together so they became the same thing.
Then Draco was sliding a finger into him, and Harry hissed and bucked his hips.
“What? It’s a simple question.”
Shacklebolt folds his hands and gives Harry a long look.
It was. The walls and honey-colored wood floors were very clean and modern-looking. A bit like the coffeehouse—except it felt like Malfoy’s home and not like the coffeehouse, so the resemblance sort of ended there. Maybe because of the smell—or the lack of it. Harry had come to associate the aroma of coffee with Malfoy, but the house did not smell like coffee.
“He helps on their farm.”
She is putting things away. In the act of dropping something into a drawer and closing it, she glances at him questioningly.
“Good.” Harry gave a twitch of his wand, and the shoes appeared on Malfoy’s feet.
Dazed, Harry blinked up at Malfoy, who had done this last time, too. He expected long fingers to dip down and tease him, tracing circles over his sensitive skin, and his body tensed with anticipation. But Malfoy stretched across Harry and brushed his mouth over Harry’s neck and jaw and said, voice low, “Fuck me.”
Hermione says, “Anyway, I just meant it’s nice. That you care. It’s awful, what they did to him.”
It took them months to learn a new rhythm with each other while also figuring out what to do with their careers. For sure, they didn’t
Another eye roll, but Malfoy is already moving toward the far counter. “What
“Merlin. Draco.”
The egg was so small in his hand when he picked it up, so small and pink, like the blush of dawn against the clouds. He cupped it in one hand and levitated the dirty dishes into the kitchen, where he set Cleaning Charms on them and placed the egg in a carton in the fridge. It looked tiny in the compartment of the carton and very colorful next to the larger white and brown eggs.
Malfoy leaned forward, kissed his shoulder. “I’ll make you feel good. May I make you feel good?”
“Oh!” Luna said.
It occurred to him that Potter still hadn’t told him anything useful.
“Hermione told me I ought to apologize. So I called to apologize.” He says the bit about Hermione on purpose, because it’s easier if he blames it on her. And also, he’d rather be mocked for taking directions from Hermione again than for admitting he simply wanted to see Malfoy.
“They use some kind of special hops variety for this one,” Harry said. “Less bitter. Kind of piney.”
Harry smiled and took the broom from him. He accepted back the Snitch, too. It was cold from its flight but warm in the places Malfoy had held it.
The symptoms were never the same. Different effects, different potions. A witch whose skin burned anyone who touched it. Another who’d been irreversibly blinded. A wizard who could not stop laughing. But the lab had traced nearly all of the potions to the same brewer. Something to do with equipment and adulterants.
“No!” Draco snagged the old man’s arm. “No. I—want to show you the rest of the garden. We’ll simply…step around the stinking puddle of liquid fertilizer and be on our way. These here are the compost bins. The level of this one has declined by half over the winter.
Ginny snorted into her own drink.
“Oh, don’t worry. There’s lots more to show you,” Luna said.
And that’s when it sank in: this was Ginny and Luna’s home. And the strangeness of being far from home dissipated because their presence was here. Harry’s home had always been where his friends were.
“What happened back there, Potter?”
, and grabbed the first clean clothes that came to hand. He looked down at himself and realized how mismatched and disorganized he was in an orange Cannons t-shirt, blue button-down, and black jeans.
Luna said, “But you haven’t been able to use it, Harry. It needs to be de-infested.”
“Have you run into any othelias, Harry? It’s hard to tell. You can have them living in the walls for generations and not know it. Daddy has the contact for a witch who relocates them. I’ll get her name for you.” She added, “I think it’s good that you’re finally giving the house some attention.”
He looked back.
“Show off,” Draco said.
A couple of the potatoes went flying. Ginny snatched one from the air. Harry dropped the basket to snatch the other.
Draco scanned the rest of the scene. With a burst of relief, he remembered he’d moved the dirigible plums to the south garden under a network of concealment charms.
“Uh.”
It occurred to Harry that he’d placed Malfoy into the position he was most used to having sex with women in. Not that he hadn’t had sex in other positions. He just defaulted to this one. He felt a small moment of uncertainty at this, but then, Malfoy hadn’t resisted, was staring at him with pupils blown wide.
“What’s going on?” he says, moving away from the window. He gestures to the bed. (His guest chair disappeared in the night, the way furniture sometimes mysteriously appears and disappears from hospital rooms.)
Looking into the rising steam from his own cup, Malfoy says, “It’s fortuitous you called. I was considering having you over but didn’t know how you’d receive an invitation.”
Maybe because he was so tired, and maybe because he had spent so much time in their kitchen the last few days, he felt as if he’d slipped into a pleasant time continuum in which Luna and Ginny were forever stepping around each other in the kitchen, a bit like a dance, chatting and trading casual kisses and fond looks.
“Your memories are not my memories, Potter.”
“Ah—yeah. I imagine they would be. So do you want me to guide them there?”
This time, unlike the last, Malfoy pushed it in. He went slowly, but even so, Harry felt like he was being dragged inside out. He couldn’t make a noise.
“Oh, that’s not bad. I cut the length of my palm when I first tried.”
“Apparently just for old books. You
“Let them,” Ginny called back, grimly. “Two shots this time! Then seal!”
He thinks Draco is teasing, but this is the part he’s still unsure about. This is where he falters. His mouth goes dry. It’s like they’re dancing, and his body wants to move in a certain direction, but he doesn’t know if Draco will move there with him. He stares into grey eyes and doesn’t know what to say.
Malfoy stopped Harry frequently to criticize his form.
fascinated by the open kitchen and the cooks he could see inside it—flipping things on the grills, tossing food onto plates, sliding orders onto the steel counter for the waitstaff.
Luna patted his hand. “Would you like me to take you up?”
Harry spent another day on the farm with Luna. He met the white bison, managed to anger the Erumpent (though Luna calmed it with a song), and collected fallen Thunderbird feathers from the forest’s edge.
Edward grinned down at him. “The clumsiness of youth,” he said, and Draco didn’t have the breath to refute him. He was miffed and half-drenched with rank-smelling muck, and could
“I might give it another few days,” he said. “Then I’ll call Bill.”
“I’ll strike fear into the hearts of all Dark wizards,” Harry intoned, because he couldn’t help but pick up on the playful energy.
“What? Oh.” He looked at the credit card Ginny had handed to him and gave it to the cashier. She took it with a grin, and it occurred to him, belatedly, that she had asked him a lot of questions—especially when the coffee person handed him his cup and directed him to a table around the corner where he could choose from a dizzying array of sweeteners and creamers himself. He rooted around for the milk and sugar, added generous helpings of both, and walked back onto the street.
“Not sell hats.” Harry shrugged. “I dunno.”
“And Grimmauld is done.”
The next morning, Harry succeeds in his attempt to sneak into his office unseen.
“For fuck’s sake,” he mutters. Then he forcibly relaxes as his magic threatens to expand in his chest. Takes a long breath. Walks down to Records to put in a request for the full case file. He even manages a bland smile when the record-keeper informs him that Harry will need to be cleared for access and—if he receives permission—the files will take at least three days to arrive in his office.
“Not here, they’re not. They’re legal here.”
Pats of butter. Rolling pins. Measuring charms. Malfoy directing him exactly how to fold the dough before rolling it again, and stopping him every time he rolled in the wrong direction, or unevenly, or too few times—until Harry wondered why he hadn’t wanted Luna to choose a job shadowing opportunity for him. Surely anything was better than Malfoy ordering him to cut blocks of butter
Harry’s eyes widened. “Are we…killing them?”
He went on to tell Harry that the Unspeakables had already taken Malfoy’s report prior to this via legilimency, but Malfoy was now giving his verbal statement as a formality.
He hitched up on an elbow and studied Harry with an intense expression. It was different to the hunger from before. Harry’s breath caught. He couldn’t read Malfoy’s expression, had no idea what to expect from him. Even when Malfoy leaned down, Harry didn’t know whether he’d…headbutt Harry or…
Behind Harry, the door slams itself shut. Malfoy crosses his arms, and Harry realizes the interview’s to be here in the entryway.
On impulse, he takes the guest entrance up to street level. He exits into the protest, which is still going on. It’s continued on in shifts since the day it started. The misty rain has not deterred the demonstrators. Neither has it deterred the press. Harry recognizes several of the faces there from the
The words blurred; Harry wasn’t really paying attention to them. He knew he was stalling.
Harry looked around the attic. It hadn’t fundamentally changed. Most of the old junk was there, only rearranged. They hadn’t actually needed to Vanish much of it. What was left was inert, benign, dusty, ancient. Useless to Harry. Would Andromeda want any of it?
After checking on the progress of the simmering lacewing flies, he left the lab and locked it.
Malfoy accepts the cup with a quick, grateful glance that does something instant and funny to Harry’s gut. He blows on the tea, makes a noise of approval, and sips. “Actually, I left against healer’s orders.”
Fortunately, the food came shortly after. Harry decided he was grateful for the waiter, even if he did want to hex him when the bloke looked at Malfoy. But why should Harry care, anyway? Let him wink at Malfoy and his stupid hat. It made no difference to Harry.
“Er…right.”
“Thanks, Ron,” Harry said, and aimed a mild Stinging Hex at him.
Malfoy’s other hand came to encircle Harry’s aching erection.
Harry was having fun.
“Oh, fuck off.”
for park-sex, were you?”
Luna beamed. “Yes. I think that’s enough, don’t you?”
newspaper.” The paper flies from Malfoy’s hand to his own. He scans the article. He feels a little ill. “Malfoy, this isn’t—”
They watch as past-Harry researches Malfoy’s records at the Ministry. Harry did not consciously choose to include this memory, but the magic must have pulled it in. Unfortunately.
“Traveling the world.”
The hotel clerk didn’t blink at two men asking for one room, although Harry felt conspicuous. When they got to the room, some of the lack of suspicion was self-explanatory: there were two beds, each too small to fit more than one adult man comfortably.
After some thinking, they’d decided to open a private consulting firm. Draco knew a lot about potions and dark magic and artifacts, and Harry was well versed in curses, hexes, and defensive magic, so between the two of them, they had a breadth of knowledge and experience. Following that decision, they endured several more chaotic months as they set up and learned to run a fledgling business. With Harry’s celebrity status, they hardly needed to promote themselves. In fact, they’d quickly drowned under a deluge of ludicrous requests and spent days sifting out the cases actually worth their time.
“What? No,” Harry says, probably a beat too fast.
“Are you sure about that, Malfoy?” Ginny said. “You do remember what happened last time, don’t you?”
“Can you let me in?”
Harry nodded along, though it all washed right over him in a stream of American-and-posh. He was used to Molly Weasley’s kitchen with all of its washing and cooking charms, and he was used to Weasley Wizard Wheezes and its backroom filled with bubbling cauldrons and contained explosions. This was so
“Yes. Thanks.”
, he wants to say.
Malfoy didn’t make a sound, but Harry could practically feel him holding back laughter.
Hermione accepts the parchment from him and gives it a critical eye. She marks a change on it with a quill. Then Harry finds himself the recipient of her full intense focus. “Have you got the files I asked for?”
“I don’t know,” Malfoy drawls. “Some uncouth oaf in dirty jeans.”
“They’re not pets, Potter. They’re— I use them to collect potions ingredients.”
Ginny met Malfoy’s eye as she placed her empty bottle on the little drink tray. Malfoy made a weird expression at her, eyes widening and narrowing at the same time. Before Harry could try to make out what was going on, Luna was bending to give him a kiss, too.
There was no queue this time of day. At the till, Heather smirked at him and handed him a number.
“Potter.”
Harry’s fingers turn white on the porcelain plate. He has to remember why he came here. He has to remember— There’s something beneath Malfoy’s bluster. Harry can’t quite place it, but he can see the shadow of it lurking beneath the narrowed eyes and razor mouth.
“Sometimes we have non-magical guests,” Luna said, as they passed doorways. “Though usually they’re magical. Like you. There’s quite a lot of rooms for the conferences we hold. I’ll give you a tour soon, but I thought for now you’d just like to settle in.”
Edward turned his attention from the geraniums. “Lovely, lovely. Elizabeth would appreciate these.”
Harry had no plans after that.
In that moment, he honestly didn’t care. Screw the other offenders. But he needed a moment to think, needed an excuse to break away from the angry eyes.
Malfoy takes a drawn out sip of tea, maintaining eye contact over the rim. Arsehole.
“Harry?” A familiar voice asked, bringing him back to reality. It was already dark outside and his stomach was empty.
George knew, of course, that Ginny and Luna played in the wrong team since the beginning of Hogwarts. He just wanted to torture his sister a bit.
“—But I don't want to watch you make a complete fool of yourself.”
Every step! That’s it!
“Rumours?” He questioned, locking eyes with her and trying to leave any emotion he might feel out of them.
He grabbed the hand with which Malfoy had been pointing in his direction threateningly and changed their positions, pressing the blond— who was a bit taller than him— against the wall.
“Yes!” He interrupted her, getting up from his spot by the fireplace. “About that, I need to ask you both for a favour”
Malfoy sneered ar him, Harry rolled his eyes and gave a step in the opposite direction of the Slytherin, trying to be as distant from the cunning snake as possible.
They were both gonna pick Hermione,  Ginny and Luna at the Ravenclaw tower— who were all doing their make ups and hairs, probably — and they’d all go to the Ball as a group.
“Get up!” He urged to the blond.
Now it was no time for flashbacks, but something told him it could be of some use later.
Interesting. It was interestingly familiar to him.
He tried to ask him, through not so subtle gestures, what the fuck he thought he was doing. The only response he got was a wink and a sudden pull on his pants that, when he looked down, made him realize his zipper was fully open and was tugging at his underwear.
Oh, right! He's obsessed— for some reason— with that blond, annoying, bouncing ferret who says he stinks and Harry is more determined now than ever to get his revenge on him since his staying at the hospital and everything happening to Harry is Malfoy’s fault.
That scared him above anything else, being with someone who only cares about his fame and makes him feel alone anyway.
George— who was now trying to cut his only ear with his fingernails because of the boys’ screams— smiled and congratulated them, he got up and went downstairs to warn his mother that the girls, Harry and Ron had to go buy school supplies.
Of course, when their tongues started battling —he wasn’t sure who had asked entrance to whose mouth and who had given in first—at sine point the invisible wall was not there anymore, but Harry’s back was pressed against a real corridor’s wall.
And maybe he had never even thought about doing it with a girl, so what's the big deal? Just because he didn't even think of it in fourth year when Fleur was in school, even though every other straight boy was?
He spotted Parkinson looking at him and gave her the signal—who had already trapped Malfoy in some kind of discussion with Zabini—for her to come over.
“And who are you to tell me what to do, Ronald? If I want to put a fucking chocolate frog in my mouth, I will; just like Hermione will put your dick into hers!” And with that, she stole his last chocolate frog (which had an extremely rare card glued to its leg) and left the compartment.
Malfoy was pale enough to be one of those clowns; but too proud to be as stupid as them.
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! He would not let himself go down like this. He, Harry James Potter, was Gryffindor, for crying out loud. So, he was going to be a real Gryffindor and show his red and gold colours as he yelled in the ferret’s face for making him feel this way.
So, in the corridor, as soon as he saw a group of Hufflepuffs—and whispered jackpot under his breath—he approached them and cast a spell to make the bag of one of them fall and drop all the books so he could get close and help her catch them from the floor so he would be close enough for her to smell him “unintentionally.”
She gave Ron and Harry theirs and, after finishing reading it, they both looked at each other and screamed at the same time. “We are going to need formal clothing?!”
“Oh my Merlin, I already had a crush on him, but oh my!”
“It’s on” he scribbled on the piece of paper he wrote back.
“Looking for something, Harry?” He asked, still trying to control the box that, to Harry, looked more like a weirdly shaped bludger.
So he grabbed the front of Draco’s black shirt and pulled him, making their chests colide with each other.
Rip and throw a few papers in the lake —very bad for the planet and very idiot, since he could just use magic to burn them— and then fit ontem the probably very cold ground for almost two hours—head between his knees and the only movement of his body being the rising of his shoulder in tune with his breathing.
You see, Ron assumed that going to the Ball was already included in the dating business.
The less annoying reason —but still extremely so— was the fact that Draco hadn’t showed up —not even at lunch or dinner— for these whole days and even
_________________
First there was a hint of confusion, as the red haired boy frowned and his eyebrows almost touched; then, Harry saw, almost in slow motion, the blush of anger crawling its way from Ron’s collar bone to his face.
THAT made him have an idea. A genius idea if he could say so.
Hermione had confronted her boyfriend about it one day, during lunch, and the only answer she had been given was a nod toward the Slytherin table, where she spotted a familiar blond, stare glued to her table— one she knew all too well, one she was sure if said stare were to be followed would land on none other than the boy who lived. He was eating slower than one normally would, however it was easier for her to spot details that would be invisible to the untrained eye, such as the spoon he was using to provoke Harry with, tightly wrapped around his lips, which were slightly dripping with milk from his cereal.
“You alright there, ferret?”
He opened it and read:
“Calm down?” Harry frowned, finally listening to Ron’s pleas.
As soon as he complained- more precisely, his stomach almost yelled at him to go get food- Izy smiled, those big round eyes sparkling with joy, and wrapped him some scones and wished him good luck after he told the Elf he had somewhere important to be- or better, someone important to meet.
“Drarry!” She yelled out loud when she remembered. “That’s the official name.”
He’d need to enter Slughorn’s locked classroom. Well, he thought, this must be easier to break into than Gringotts.
He raised his hands in the air, showing he meant no wrong, and motioned to his pocket.
“Hermione, PLEASE, let me go back to my dorm. I’ll even do my transfiguration homework.” He was so fucking bored.
Caution was out of the window long ago.
“Did it work?”
He wanted to tell them to go to hell, but Parkinson leaned her head so her lips were right beside Ron’s ear and whispered something.
But that’s not true, he’s just Harry.
(feel free to point out any typos)
“Good afternoon, Hogwarts! It’s three in the afternoon right now and the game is about to begin!”
Draco took both his hand in his and held them over his head, kissing his shoulder and neck.
There was such a mess of limbs they wanted to stay like that forever.
“Uh, guys?!” Asked George, alarmed, he always knew when he was about to win a bet, and this was one of those times.
He looked at the image of Hogwarts. Hermione and Ginny were still in the Great Hall; Ron was heading towards the library—and that surprised Harry very much, but he didn’t really think much of it, Ron was probably just rememberers some homework due tomorrow that he hadn’t done—; Neville was, in fact, heading towards the lake; Luna was leaving the Ravenclaw tower and walking really, really slowly.
A deep part of him wished it had been like that in reality, while the rest of him mocked him for being so weak and allowing Ron’s words to get stuck in his head and for kissing that sinful mouth.
“Sure?”
“Sod off, Malfoy!”
“What d’you think you are doing, Potter?” he asked in a threateningly way.
But it felt so good whenever he and Malfoy kissed. And he still wanted more, needed more. Also, there was no one around, so what could go wrong? As far as he knew, even if they did get caught, he wasn’t aware of any rule that stated student couldn’t get involved with each other. Sure they wouldn’t go further than they already had, at least not if the ferret kept escaping through his fingers every time.
He looked around and noticed that his teammates and the Ravenclaws has stopped midair as well, looking at the cam uncertainly.
They stepped away from each other and both cleaned their mouths to their sleeves—even though Harry had a feeling he only did it because Malfoy had done it as well.
He arranged his tie while looking at himself in the mirror and ran his hand through his hair, taking in a big breath and releasing it, preparing himself for what was to come—a difficult task to concentrate on since he was wearing such silly clothes.
The Ravenclaws—besides Luna— were all going with someone from Hufflepuff.
When he made sure the other Seeker was not looking at him, he sped up towards his target — with Zabini narrating every movement he made — and the snitch flew away once more, stopping right in front of the screen of the kissing cam.
Harry hadn’t seen Neville much this year. They only saw each other at night because of the intense training his friend was getting. He was studying Herbology with Sprout every morning at six in the morning and the rest of his day was spent with her, except for meal times, where the professor and he would eat in the Divination Tower to hel Trelawney with some sort of plants that she said would be very useful in the future of seers.
“She’s crazy, Harry, mate! I’m telling you! She started to get angry when I mentioned Luna and I guess she went over the edge because of the bloody frog! Merlin” he whispered under his breath, “I wanted that card!”
He, for some reason, was swearing as if he were extremely hot. He took off his coat and cast an aguamenti on his hair to keep himself fresh.
After a while he realizes, though, that he still felt relaxed, from the soap and, he’d never admit it, from the sounds coming from next door.
The ginger haired boy was, as planned, waiting for Harry to come down for breakfast —he’d removed the silencing charms on his best friend’s bed the previous day so he would wake up with Seamus’s snores.
He knew the blond would not be so a good action without something in return, but after that much embarrassment, he didn’t mind much.
“Shh. Don’t say anything.” He whispered in a weirdly seductive voice that made him shiver. The hands that were close to his face, slowly covered his eyes so Harry couldn’t see anything. His mind was blank and his vision dark. His senses were perfected and he felt as if he could fully sense everything happening around his body and feel the magic pulsating through his body.
The first years entered the Great Hall, a bit soaked, and looked at McGonnagal nervously, while she held the hat. The hat’s mouth opened and started singing:
She did and “accidentally” crashed into Harry, “accidentally” spilling her drink all over him.
“What do you think the sorting hat is trying to warn us about, this year, ‘Mione?!” Asked Harry, oblivious as always to what those warnings meant.
Maybe he should find an excuse to talk with some nice Hufflepuff or a honest Ravenclaw—something Harry had learned over the years was that no one should ever, EVER, ask for Gryffindor or Slytherin's opinion without being sure of themselves first, because they would probably totally honest without filter or try to lie to you and totally fail because the smiles would end up being totally fake.
They’d both be alone in the hallway and, Ron knew— even though Harry would never admit it— that Harry had been observing the blond. Just sparing glances whenever he thought no one was looking.
As he walked in, George greeted him with a smile as he carried a big box with something moving inside it.
“C’mon, ‘Mione, that song you love is about to start!”
He always did the same thing:
Hermione looked around the great hall.
Firstly, she would be at dinner reading a book instead of preoccupying herself with boys. Since when was he the one with boy problems? He was a boy, for Merlin’s sake. Well, if he was having boy problems, like a girl, maybe he should act like one and try to have the uncomfortable talk of “Where is this going?” “d’you really have feelings for me, or blah, blah, blah…”
He couldn’t remember his dream, but he was sure this instinct to have a quick release was caused because of all the speculation about the shag between Parkinson and Malfoy.
His rage was so bloody hot, that he kicked the door with all his strength and, as soon as the pain hit him, started cursing. “Oh, for the love of Merlin; Ahh!”
"Okay, man, step one, you can't fail." Ron told his reflexion in the mirror.
The kisses on the neck continued; a cold hand crept up his tight and under his shirt. A shiver ran down his spine, he let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding and closed his eyes. Draco’s lips kept softly kissing up his neck, biting sweetly once in a while; he reached his jawline and started kissing up to his cheek, dropped a slow kiss on his forehead, the tip of his nose and on and on until he finally kissed the left corner of Harry’s- much hotter than Draco’s- lips; which should be turning blue any moment.
He needed to be careful so his oblivious friend wouldn’t get suspicious, so he followed him around in hopes to perfect his plan.
He tickled a sleeping dragon
There was cold and a feeling of emptiness, his lips were searching and only found air, his hands were free and he was so hard it hurt. His breath left him in short, fast puffs, his head hit the wall behind him and he rested his weight against it, afraid that his legs could give in at any second and he would be on his knees but not how he wanted.
“Potter!” Draco called, snapping his pale, long fingers in front of Harry’s eyes. “I’m doing my best here and would appreciate it if you at least pretended to care”.
She had already forgotten about the fact that he had— once again— not asked her right away.
“Bloody hell” he whispered as he closed the books and grabbed his broom and Quidditch robes to go straight to the field as fast as he could.
Everyone was still calmly eating in the Great Hall. This was the perfect moment.
He turned the water on and took off his boxers. He washed his face first and leaned against the shower’s wall, trying to ease the tension on his shoulders by cleaning them with a soap Luna had given him, saying it was relaxing and helped whatever part of your body you used it in to ease tension.
Harry sighed, he missed Ginny sometimes, when he saw her with Luna, giggling and hugging and— to his surprise, since it was the first time he’d seen it— even kissing.
He glanced at the benches and saw that every Half-Blood —except him— and Pureblood was confused.
“Do— do you know who that person was?” He noticed her confused expression and added. “In the cam with me, I mean.”
Who was that?
His hands explored the blond’s scarred back and probably left more scars there after a shiver ran down his spine when their members touched and he raised his waist just to feel it once again; getting the hint, his partner reached down and stroked them together, making both of them shiver and sigh contently.
“Kiss, kiss, ...” he kept hearing.
Halle-bloody-luja.
“Hold that thought.” George said, then cast a quick spell on the box and it stopped moving. He nodded, urging Harry to continue.
And it also made that cute line apear in between her eyebrow that always made Ron want to kiss her.
He still hadn’t bought anything to wear and he certainly did not have a plus one to bring. He thought of all the options, all the girls in his year and none seemed right.
But Harry grabbed his arm before he could as much as get up from the bed they were sitting in.
The response was a shake of a head and wide grey eyes. “What now?” Malfoy whispered.
I promise I'm already working on the next chapter and, if you want more smut, i promise it will be better (and if you have notes or something specific for me to add please tell me, tho I do have ideas so do not worry much)
At least now he could take a relaxing, long, hot shower with the shampoo he had borrowed from Hermione, which smelled like apples— she didn’t use it because she said she had purchased the wrong one, since she preferred the smell of oranges and cinnamon— so, after Harry’s shampoo finished, Hermione gave him hers.
Malfoy dropped his head on the mattress and laughed quietly, making his already blushing face heat up even more.
“That’s not a good thing, Ron, if we —“
“Just a little longer.”
“to give you an alternative”, he sighed and handed it to him, ignoring his confused expression as he held a box in front of him.
“Curse you, Draco Malfoy” he whispered to no one.
‘Shame we didn’t share that kiss, I guess we will have to wait until next time.
His eyes rolled back when He-Knew-Who bit his lip, allowing him to taste blood. He tried to move his hands, but felt the grip holding them tighten and the lips touching his move away, just to move to his ear and whisper in one breath a threat to tie him up and fuck him in front of everyone until he couldn’t stand for days if he didn’t obey to the one who owned him. A hand pressed itself against the bulge in his pants and the blood left his brain and rushed south, leaving him wanting nothing more but to free his hands, drop to his knees, unzip Draco’s pants with his mouth and just beg to let him—
Malfoy looked away, checking to see if they could leave and probably to hide the new wave of redness on his face—that Harry just assumed was from relief at the thought of being free.
“where did you find this?” he asked, mesmerized. “this is a bracelet used in the Black coming of age tradition.” He continued.
"I'm here to talk about Potter."
Once the others had left, she sat besides his bed.
They came downstairs and made some chitchat with Harry about what smells he likes.
Merlin knows why George would make Ron pay double the price and Harry could have their products for free.
“We can —“
So what the fuck was he doing?
As Ronald left the Great Hall you could hear Hermione Granger’s sigh that sounded a lot like, “I’m dating a bloody fangirl” followed by the sound of her head hitting the table several times.
Slowly, not wanting to break the illusion, he reached with his hand to his abdomen—feeling a rush of minor pleasure wherever his fingertips touched— laying it flat on his stomach and reaching down carefully, touching and examining the feel of the bites and marks he knew were there.
“Save it, Potter. “He whispered just loud enough for Harry to hear.
And Harry, of course, would be very pleased as well with his gift — a little help with his “relationship” with Draco Malfoy.
“If Lovegood wasn’t so loony, she’d probably be a beast in bed...”
And so Ron gets distracted, thinking about how his friend and Malfoy are so freaking perfect for each other and forgets to listen to the conversation to actually know what he should do for the next part of the plan.
Ron smiled, happy for his sister’s relationship.
“What was that?” She asked through gritted teeth.
The bracelet harry had in his pocket burned him like Draco’s tears were probably burning his eyes. Thinking about the bracelet, harry remembered what his original idea with it was. His hand went for his pocket and he felt something cold on his neck, a wand.
In his room, accompanied by Zabini and Nott, there he was… Draco the bastard who made Harry`s stomach feel like he had butterflies or some bullshit like that even though it was not entirely fucking unpleasant Malfoy.
Even Zabini, the only fool at school who would dare date Pansy— used to be pug face— Parkinson, told him he liked his fresh cut grass of the Quidditch field smell.
She gave it to Ron, who thanked her and left the table, with a satisfied grin in his lips.
______________________________
The body under his was just making him die with lust. He had promised himself he wouldn’t do this, promised himself he would control himself and hold off, not do anything stupid or risky.
“I solemnly swear that I’m up to no good.” He whispered as his wand was pointed to the map and the words and images started to appear.
Until the meal was announced to be over or after , there’s no sign of Malfoy not his ferret face.
It felt good, for about five minutes, when he finally remembered how nervous he actually should be and the reason for it.
They were probably going to their dorms for a quick shag or something.
As they started to pack their things, Harry remembered something and asked, “‘Mione, can you stay here? I need to ask you something.”
___________________________
Ron had just barely escaped Filch and his bloody cat!
There was silence. Everyone held their breaths as the Headmistress pointed her wand at the blanket covering a part of the benches in the pitch.
And then the door of their room opened and George stepped in, with a huge smile on his face.
Lastly, Harry couldn’t stop thinking about the whole Malfoy thing. The way he had pressed the blond’s soft body against the wall and the Death Eater comment and— HOLY GODRIC GRYFFINDOR!
The three of them threw themselves to the couch in front of the fireplace and said, “I’m exhausted!” In unison, looking at each other and asking, “why are you two exhausted? I DID NOTHING!” And getting up and going to their respective beds, feeling bad for lying and suspecting each other.
But, of course, Harry wouldn’t listen to anyone.
How could he had forgotten about the Marauders’ map?! How could he had forgotten about something as important!
“Class dismissed, you can leave now.” But the redhead wasn’t listening anymore. He’d already ran out the door before professor Flitwik even finished his sentence.
It was a wonder he hadn’t cum in his pyjamas during those dreams. How he managed to control himself until the morning was completely unknown to him.
The moment their eyes met, Harry remembered everything that had happened in his dream— sinful thoughts all around his head now— and his cheeks started burning because of the embarrassment he was feeling.
He wanted to start another conversation when he noticed he had stopped talking, but he just couldn’t, he didn’t have any more will power to keep himself from touching the blond.
He could feel them staring as he tried to dress, but as he was still wet, his clothes cling to his body and he only blushed more.
_____________________________________________
Harry didn’t understand what was so special about her. She wasn’t that pretty—at least Harry did not feel attracted to her— and she was with a different boy in her bed everyday, or something.
Oh, he would definitely do no such thing. When Draco tried to turn around again, Harry- out of anger- grabbed his collar and neared their faces, making the distance between them become a lot shorter that five feet.
Grey eyes focused themselves on Harry’s, probably looking for some sign of mockery, but he wouldn’t find any because Harry wasn’t joking. He sat beside Malfoy and sighed.
“There they are” he whispered to himself as he saw one of the cupboards with a small note saying “Amortentia”.
Yeah, that’s great, Harry, why don’t you just get going? It’s late and you have stuff to do.” She hurried him outside, which only added to his confusion.
During this week, Harry had seen himself become more frustrated with Draco Malfoy, than in the last few years with Voldemort trying to kill him and take over the Wizarding World.
But Harry only stared at the place where the mysterious person was before.
Harry nodded toward Ron for him to sit down so they could talk.
He seemed to be confused for a while, but soon was on his feet and walking alongside Harry towards the castle, being careful so not to make too much noise and get caught by Filtch or the bloody cat.
____________
______________________________
“Wait! Wait! Wait!” Said Harry. “So, they didn’t admit it? You have NOT won yet! Ginny could just.. I don’t know but—“
“You was Dobby’s friend, sir.”
He waited until every student was inside some shop to sneak his way through the shops.
Ron and the Gryffindors we’re entering the  male locker rooms to prepare themselves for Quidditch, just like the girls in their team were doing in the female one.
It didn’t hurt as much as he expected, which was great; but it wasn’t any different from what they were doing earlier.
And he was on the screen. His face, sweaty and red, beside the image of someone sitting in the Gryffindor side— their face was covered by a hood and Harry did not recognize who it was.
What shocked them both more than Harry’s lips responding to this by moving as well, was wave that descended both of their bodies, making their movements become like a flame instead of the inicial spark.
The tears once again blurred his vision and he had a hard time swallowing.
The thick material started to lift itself with her nonverbal spell.
He dressed himself and went down to breakfast.
Malfoy pressed his lips in a thin line , his pale eyebrows almost touching. His arms were holding Harry in place, not letting him fall. One of them holding his waist —he could feel those slender pointy fingers even through his robes— the other on his arm.
Why was Harry’s life such a mess?
“Why does it smell like some disgusting muggle food in here?” She asked, not noticing the way Harry’s eyes widened after hearing her question.
Blaise started talking again, introducing every team member in a way that would have made Lee Jordan —the commentator that made everyone except McGonagall laugh— proud.
It all happened really fast. When his mind wrapped itself around what was happening, he was pressed up against a wall behind a tapestry. A cold hand pressing his over his head while another one ran over his rib cage under his cloak, then under his shirt and near the waistband of his pants. All this while a tall, lean body pressed against his own and a pair of lips that he knew so well was kissing his neck and mouth.
“Hold up!” Said Harry, since they had forgotten he was in there. “Ginny is a LESBIAN?!”
THAT got Ron's attention.
He sighed silently.
“I asked you, MrWeasley, what’s the last ingredient in the potion, after the powdered moonstone? You were listening to the lesson, weren’t you?”
So, McGonagall and Hermione raised their wands and started working.
Every comment Malfoy has ever made, from “you stink, Potter” to the comments about fearing dementors.
He pressed forward—stretching him—and paused, letting him adjust to the sensation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Two red ones— who he supposed were Ginny and Ron— a brown one —who he suspected was Hermione — right beside the blonde, almost white one— who, by the colours he could see in the person’s clothes, even though blurry, he’d say was Luna.
He started kissing down Harry’s shoulders, annoyed at the fact that Granger and the Weasel were on Potter’s mind while they were doing THIS, of all things. He moved to Harry’s chest and belly, leaving a wet trace of kisses on his way, until he finally reached the hem of his underwear and bit it as seductively as he could, never breaking eye contact as he pushed it down to Harry’s knees and proceeded to take them off with his hands and tossed them aside.
When Harry noticed the odd look some Slytherins were giving him — including Malfoy— he followed their stares and got a view of the towel wrapped around his waist. And there it was: the one that was supposed to be used for his hair because it was really small, the only thing covering him and, as he looked over his shoulder, he saw the towel he should had used, near his sweaty Quidditch clothes.
Behind him, someone started laughing, scaring him and making him turn around so fast he slipped and fell on his ass, hurting himself.
“You—You forgot?!”
He tosses his clothes aside, grabbed his towel— the right one, this time— and entered the first empty shower he saw.
Harry, after drying himself with a quick wave of his wand, he put on his clothes calmly, noticing that some Slytherins still hadn’t left.
“What are yo-“
“what do you want, scarhead?” Draco spit.
But he’d make an effort to see his best friend happy, just like he was with Hermione, and to see this ship sailing without any iceberg to make it sink— like that movie-thing ‘Mione had told him about, the Titanician or something; he really needed to pay more attention to what his girlfriend told him.
She sighed and kept nodding and saying "sure", "mmhm", and other things everytime he asked something.
“By the way, Potter, good try covering up you old stinky smell with green apple perfume, but you cant fool me.” Malfoy said, unclenching his fists and dropping his chin on top of Harry’s head.
Once his new Elf friend handed him the tea, he grabbed his target’s hand and led him to his dorm where he hoped his Gryffindor classmates were sound asleep, or they’d never let him forget about it.
“Wow” She said out loud. Ron’d kill her if he knew she was doing this behind his back — Harry probably wouldn’t care, since he was too obsessed with Malfoy to even care or notice what his friends were doing — but she was sure Ron would AVADA her, or try to make her vomit slugs. Thanks Godric, when he discovered, she’d just tell him she was trying to surprise him, even though he didn’t like surprises, because they made him feel stupid and oblivious for not noticing.
Bloody. Fucking. Hell.
It was the first day of classes and now, at the first class they had after lunch— potions— Ron was trying to stay awake while Slughorn kept talking about— about an Aswinder’s egg being the first ingredient in— in some potion and— and it  had some kind of rose thorn and— and other stuff he couldn’t place.
And Ronald thanked for that, because he was sure he was going to stab himself in the ears if Harry kept talking about what he did—in this case in particular, what he couldn’t do—with Ginny— his bloody younger sister.
It seemed they really were going to do this… to do it.
That was enough to keep his eyes open while he was daydreaming about the movement he practiced during the summer.
Harry rolled his eyes at their childish behaviour and made his was towards a free spot near the shower, the rest of his teammates —except Ron— followed suit.
“Love is, indeed, the correct answer”, the door said and opened itself.
Both started shouting at each other simultaneously, right before turning away and going their separate ways.
Just because he already dreamt about Malfoy’s penis once or twice. So what?
When he was certain this part of his job was complete, he looked lovingly up at the panting mess the other boy was: one hand gripping the sheets above his head, the other had slithered its way into his dark black hair and was pulling his messy curls as if to wake himself up, face red with the blush that was rising up from his chest and neck and his breath was so hard and hot he probably didn’t even notice the sweat covering him all over, making his skin shiny and deliciously salty if Draco dared lick him clean.
Harry’s chin almost hit the floor when his friend nodded and whispered something back.
“Wow, wow,come here and calm down, mate.” Neville said “Why have you been going through my stuff? Oh, you know what? It doesn't matter! I know you, Harry, and I know you would have a really good reason for that so come on I might have something to help you.”
Malfoy cleared his throat, nodded his head once as he said “Potter”, and turned around after a nod of his head.
“Aha! Here you are!” Said George, holding up a box. “We don’t have enough yet to sell, but this is the last prototype, the one we are gonna use.”
It’s sad to hear him speak as if his brother was still there, but no one ever corrected him so he’d just let it go.
i know it's been long: immmmmm sooooo sooorrryyyyyy lyyyyyy
“You’re right, maybe u should go and do it now.”

___________________________
He had been so distracted by this whole Drarry thing that, when he looked at the clock, he realized he was already twenty minutes late!
They reached a moment in Harry’s monologue where Draco stopped walking backwards while he kept walking forward towards him. He didn’t stop until their chests were touching slightly, so he could feel the other boy’s breathing, very deeply for that matter.
“So, tell me,” he reached for a ring of hair hat had fallen in front of his pale forehead “you gonna keep it?”
Harry rolled his eyes and got up, cutting Hermione off.
It was finally time for the Ball.
“Oh, well...” she seemed nervous, “well, you see, I, uh, I helped McGonagall build it and, uh, it chooses the two people with the strongest feelings for each other, the more chemistry, the better.”
“Are you alright? Neville told me you needed to talk to us—“
It’s not the blood anymore
Hermione looked a Ginny questioningly and kicked Ron’s leg under the table—who had been discussing something with Dean about his first month with Seamus and had probably forgotten about the fact that he should be watching his friend— and they all watched as Harry stumbled through the Great Hall and made his way to his room.
He got up, got dressed, got a shower and then practically showered again with the liquid inside the bottle which Ron had given to him, which he had been staring at after yesterday for at least a couple of hours.
And Harry heard his best friend go on and on about how stubborn his girlfriend was, as if Harry didn’t know about it already.
This meant that, if Harry walked down those stairs in the next thirty seconds, he’d find Malfoy on his way.
“I was looking for that new homework shredder thing you made...” he was sure the blush in his cheeks was noticeable as he remembered who the gift was for.
About the four minds
But please don’t look
“NO!” THAT he couldn’t manage.
He leaned his head against the wall. His head was spinning and he felt like throwing up.
Who once created me:
The good part of the day was that, during lunch, he and Hermione has talked and she swore she’d spend more time with him. And she always kept her promises!
Wait until he learnes what OTP means!!!!
Ron tried to ignore, but it was pretty difficult. He had been so glad when Harry had said he’d have a calm school year and wouldn’t seek trouble or fights with anyone. But, of course, just like his New Year’s revolution, that promise was broken only on the second day.
Only, when he was just passing Madam Malkin’s, something in the window of a shop he didn’t know—probably a new one— caught his eye:
They’d be practicing and choosing new players for the team, today. And every lion was sure they were going to win this year. Not only in the Quidditch pitch, but the house cup too. They had a reputation, after all.
Wait patiently my ass, Harry kept thinking.
Harry pull his face from the wall and looked at Ron’s eyes with his half closed ones and sighed— probably for the thousandth time that day.
The kiss didn’t last long, but when they came up for air they were both grinning like a pair of love sick fools.
She didn’t know why he was so mad about it or why Ron wanted him to be mad in the first place, but she had a feeling —based on his evil grip and the maleficent sparkle in his eyes— that it had something to do with Drarry, which meant she did not want to know about any detail, nor be a part of any of it.
He betted it was Malfoy and his mother, Narcissa, since the blond would probably go back to Hogwarts to torment them.
He guided him around the shop and Harry couldn’t help but miss Fred.
Why not go for another round, if he was probably just stay in bed, anyway.
And other disgusting stuff like that.
And Hermione smiled to herself as she shifted closer to the fire in the room, whilst hearing Ron’s exited words about ‘no more obsessions or complaining about the ferret if they shag each other!’
He cursed himself, he cursed his wet sheets, he cursed Malfoy’s lips and tongue and he kept cursing.
Students this year
Right before their mouths crashed into each other, Harry stopped. Making everything even more awkward.
He stood there looking at Harry with his jaw clenched and his Adam’s apple moving as if here were swallowing nothing.
He was in a corridor in the third floor, pretending to tie his shoe near a group of gossiping  fifth year girls asking Pansy what products she used on her hair.
“What are you planning, Ronald?” Asked Ginny, who had noticed his expression too.
Once again, Harry spent a big part of his time trying to make the “snakes” notice his new perfume just to make sure he smelled good before rubbing that fact in the face of you-know-who—not that you-know-who, Harry is referring to Draco Malfoy not Voldemort, obviously.
Ginny had given him and his teammates an “encouraging” speech about not losing the game or they’d lose their lives.
He would have given up on the whole “Drarry” plan just to star there with her, if only Pansy hadn’t appeared beside them and warned him that it was time.
“Ye-“
He reached the Gryffindor common room—which, unfortunately, was not empty— and made his way towards the place where he had his cloak hidden, making sure no one saw him.
“Do you— I mean, ipotetically speaking, would you think I’m crazy to think Harry ... to think he isn’t obsessed with Malfoy because he thinks he’s bad? I just— what if he just wants to have the last years back— he want to fight with the ferret again and—“
He looked up, to make sure no one had noticed what was happening or who was doing it. However, everyone seemed to be minding their own business and paying attention to the professor. Only one cunning ferret was fixated, through the corner of his eye, on him.
He followed him, having no other choice, since the collar of his shirt was being pulled to the point where he’d very soon have a lower neckline.
He looked around to make sure he was alone and grabbed the map from under his pillow, opening it and saying the usual sentence.
He shrugged, this would have to work. He took the stopper from the bottle and sniffed it.
_________
“It’s from Hogwarts!” She exclaimed. “There’s one for me, for you, Harry, Ron and for the two giggling girls down there.”
He ran a hand through it and stopped walking, sensing someone’s eyes on him.
Foreheads pressed against each other he said the words he knew were always true “Hermione, I love you, I love every big jesters and everything you do, but if you keep this speech going you’ll ruin the one I’ll probably write in a few years to ask you to marry me. You know I’m bad with words, so let’s not show off, alright?”
“In the hospital wing, AGAIN, Mr Potter. You had an allergic reaction to your new perfume.”
She shook her head. He sighed and thanked her, telling her she could go enjoy the party with the others or go to the library or whatever.
At first, it was just two pairs of lips glued together—just enough to break the spell; then Harry felt Draco’s lips tentatively moving against his own.
“Wait. You didn’t do your homework? Oh, Merlin, Harry!”
Meow.
After lowering himself once again, Malfoy kissed him with such force he was expecting his lips to bruise and taste like blood. He’d be okay with it if they did, honestly.
“Gay?”
They had won, but Harry was missing the party.
He closed his legs and pressed them together, trying to regain the friction and pleasure he’d felt before, with that hand caressing him.
A few feet away you could hear Ron congratulating himself.
Harry was really proud of his friend’s achievements. He was already preparing himself for the life he wanted.
He asked himself.
Thanks, Morgana, Harry had left it in the same place he always did since Fred and George has given it to him:
“Harry?” he heard right after the sound of the door closing.
“We don’t.” Stated Harry, siping his tea.
Those despicable long fingers he wanted to beg for, the mouth which mouthed the words as he wrote too. Oh, and the fucking quill he was using. He had to lift the quill and nibble at the end of it with his teeth, of course.
He explained how the ideas for this line of products from Muggle products and, somehow, reached a subject that had nothing to do with the gift itself.
Ginny would strangle him, or even use an unforgivable. She was capable of anything, that crazy sister of his! How was it possible that the girl, a few months younger than him, had created the evil Bat Boogy Hex?
“Harry, mate—“ Dean, who was just besides Ginny, tried to calm him, as he noticed that everyone in their table and in the Hufflepuff one were looking at them.
Maybe he should stop over analysing this stuff and just prepare his revenge.
The hand let go of him and pushed him away. Confused, he stood there, breathing hard and knees shaking.
“I’m sorry” he said between kisses, “just, let’s not leave any visible marks, I don’t want Hermione and Ron to—” he regretted the words as soon as they left his lips, knowing fully well that was not the right theme to bring up at a moment and in a situation such as this one. Why couldn’t he just enjoy the feeling of those soft bruised lips, instead of ruining his chances of getting laid.
Ron shook his head out of his thoughts, he didn’t know about the future yet, but he knew that they HAD to be together first.
He inhaled and held his breath.
When he saw the tears in her eyes he backed away slowly and congratulated him self for the success.
“Yeah— wait, NO! That bet was in second year and I betted twenty galleons! The one where I told you Ginny played in the other team and—“
Ron is wrong, anyway. Harry is only doing this because of revenge, no other purpose, no gay shit, or whatever.
He nibbled at his earlobe and Harry’s knees weakened, making him wrap an arm around the blond’s neck, grabbing the hairs at the back of his head. Malfoy kissed him—not soft kissed, hungry ones—behind his ear, down his pulse point, down his throat, until he reached the place where his shoulder met his collarbone and made his way back up, this time biting him neck here and there; pressing his body against Harry’s more and more, grabbing his waist with one hand and sliding the other inside his shirt.
“I was just wondering if ‘Mione still had Harry’s cloak from the last time she went to the library after curfew.” He said, making those puppie dog eyes, cute smile and ‘attractive’ voice Hermione couldn’t resist.
“Pearl Dust, sir.” Said a voice from the far end of the classroom.
He, after a while, gained a bit of colour and nodded, eyes closed and breath uneven.
Malfoy’s eyes widened and he looked away, making his hair fall in front of his eyes, hiding them.
This was the first time he’d ever read a book without images!
(See the end of the chapter for
She shrugged and kept eating, trying to ignore Ron’s confused glances as to where she had been looking at.
The raven haired boy turned around and his green eyes focused on Neville Longbottom. He had the old looking map Harry was looking for in his right hand and a big smile in his whole face and, as always, that smile made Harry feel calm.
Weird, Hermione thought you; and then she noticed Ron’s smirk.
So love each other
“I have to create a name, like — like Harco or something!” He yelled, and Hermione knew he really wanted to see his best friend happy, AND to have some drama and action in his life again, since he truly missed fighting and all.
“Don’t ever touch me again, Draco”, he spat back.
“What do you want, Potter?” He spat, walking forward. “I’ve seen you look at me. I’ve seen the WAY you look at me. I bet you think of me as the filthy Death Eater who tried to kill Dumbledore, don’t you?” When he finished, Harry felt his feet hit the wall behind him— since he had been walking backwards the whole time— but that didn’t scare him.
Those little shits were always like:
It all turned out to be a big misunderstanding, though.
When he finally found a compartment with one red head, a brown bushy one and a pink one, he entered— ‘wait... pink hair?’
The second letter was a poem, from Ginny, making fun of him just like she had done years before when she had that stupid crush on him. That made him smile, just like the book Hermione gave him and the ‘Every Flavour Beans’ Ron gave him.
He then proceeded to change his position and placed himself over the other boy with an elbow on each side of his blushing face—purposefully neglecting the member brushing against him, aching for attention— and whispered, biting the earlobe carefully, “Thank you for everything, Potter, you’re right and we should absolutely do this again, another day.”
He was so thankful for having Hermione, since he didn’t want to turn out like his friends. At least— now that Harry was oblivious to every single detail around him — Ron had Neville, who was the only normal boy in that school.
And, the more he thought about it, the more he realized the reason why this was sixth year all over again, just like Ron warned him.
“Have you noticed that Goyle hasn’t come back this year?”
“I—uh—maybe some—uh—“
His eyes were glued on the couple of snakes in front of him.
Suddenly, he felt something under his desk. He looked down and there was nothing. Great, now he’s having hallucinations as well. Just ignore it, he told himself as he kept feeling something rising up and pause on his lap.
Their eyes locked for a brief second and Malfoy mimicked Harry’s actions with his pink tongue, as if in a warning, and used his wand to clean himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
And then the most unexpected sound left her lips, she laughed. “Why so defensive, Potter? I’m not here to fight with you, I’m here to confirm if the rumours going around the school are true.”
_____________________________________________
Ron left with them and Hermione gave some excuse to go meet Ginny so they could go to Hogsmead.
Going back to his prior order of business: teasing and marking his property, Draco stroked his tongue slowly up Harry’s extremely hard cock.
Harry slammed door closed behind him, furiously.
“What—why?” He cried.
The next day— their second day of the Christmas holidays —Ron could start putting his plan into action, everything was ready and in place for step one.
He was so fed up with this so, right after potions, he decided to confront him about his behavior. However, when he was looking around the hallway, trying to spot a blond head in the middle of the crowd – while Ron and ‘Mione kept walking and discussed Merlin knows what— a cold hand grabbed his arm and pulled him behind a tapestry.
He turned the water off and wrapped the towel around his waist. He had brought a towel for his hair as well, but now remembered he’d left it with the rest of his clothes.
Once they were in their locker room, Harry came face to face Theodor Nott —who was a bit taller than him, but not enough to make him back down.
So what if he was always more attracted to boy-ish girls who played Quidditch better than most boys and—
---------------------------------------------------------------
Harry followed with his eyes as the drops of milk in Malfoy’s pointy chin fell, slowly, one after the other.
“As you all know, during the... last year incidents, our Quidditch pitch and locker rooms were damaged —like the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff’s— or totally destroyed—like the Slytherin and Ravenclaw’s.”
“yes, I know, Sirius had one with a dog in it” he smiled.
‘WAIT!’ Harry thought. ‘The shower next to mine is —is —‘
‘Well’, he thought ‘at least I won’t be the center of attention and stares and gossip’.
Another finger slid inside him and he shifted, pausing the kiss and scratching his partner’s back harder.
“I’ll repeat what I said, Potter. What. The. Fuck?”
Hermione glared at him, sent him the same hex Malfoy had sent her all those years ago, which made his teeth grow and grow and left the compartment as well, seeking for her friend.
But, in the middle of the day, by noon, right before lunch, Harry started to feel weird.
Well, now he was already in front of Luna’s dorm, waiting to hear the riddle so he could go in, so no point wasting time on going back to his dorm with all this anxiety.
Harry kept saying as he walked from one side of the room to the other.
It was awkward, the silence. Every time they heard a sound they would walk faster and bump into each other and he didn’t know if it was on porpoise or not, but their hands would meet and one of them would try to hold the other’s hand and then give up and create even more tension between the two. If he had a knife right now, he would either cut the tension between them or kill himself because of it.
“Ron?” Harry asked him.
“I bet she’s on her period...” said Ron under his breath.
The bites had continued from the lip to the neck and down.
“Neville, I need your help! Please! How can I take this smell out of me? It's driving me crazy; everyone is gossiping about me me because of it! Please, help me!” He gripped his friend’s shoulders and shook him a bit.”Besides, if you have time, do you have any perfume that you would give me— just because I hate my old one and I wanted a new one and I went through your bag and—“ Harry said as quick as he could even though he still hadn’t caught his breath.
“don’t you dare finish that sentence, Potter!” he yelled as he turned again, eyes shining with tears, as if there was something else in his sentence he wanted to add, like he wanted to yell ‘not you too’.
“No, you guys go without me.”
And Ron kept his eyes closed, half dreaming half awake, when a voice called his name, “Ron...” whispered Hermione— yes, the classroom smelled like Hermione. Chocolate and sweet strawberries.
Throughout the whole game, Harry noticed something was off with Ron. He was usually distracted during practice, it could be because of the Slytherin laughing as they passed by, because of the last Bludger that had hit him in the head, or—recently— because of the new thing the Headmistress, McGonagall, and the other professors were altering in the pitch, behind that white blanket they used to cover it up.
He had even helped Ron carry his books from the library and had given him one of his books about plants that was really helpful.
In his head he could hear the part of him whispering “breathe” fading away as the last seconds ticked in the clock and, finally, the bell rang. Everyone started to pack their things magically, but he did it the old muggle way and grabbed his things and leapt from his seat, running toward the Gryffindor tower and completely forgetting about dinner and the fact that he had barely eaten the whole day.
“I bet he’s so occupied plotting something to ruin our reputation and make everyone hate us that he doesn’t even have time to put gel in his hair!” He kept talking.
Harry pressed his head to the wall behind him, sensing that it truly helped to relax, even if not much and that’s when he heard it.
“Yes! He did it!” Zabini yelled.
Harry laid back down and looked at the ceiling of the Hospital Wing, thinking about his life at the moment.
Harry shook his head, not accepting that answer. He placed his hand on Malfoy’s shoulder to stop him and turned him around.
He reached a shelf full of different sized books and started reading the old looking titles.
Ginny laughed at that— actually LAUGHED!— and shook her head. “I’ll be concerned about Ron when he stops eating a chicken and a half every day. Seriously, ‘Mione, he stole your toast and you didn’t even notice.”
As the door closed after his friend who had just left with his shirt in his hand,Harry grabbed his wand and the map.
In an odd position, though.
And that's the last thing Harry heard before everything went black.
Harry hates when this happened.
Ron groaned when he saw his girlfriend run her hand through the cover of every book she thought interesting and rolled his eyes when she grabbed and opened one; but a smile crept in his lips when she smelled it and her expression turned from excitement to pure adoration.
As he was about to get up, ne noticed he was clean. Draco had cleaned him. He reached with his hand to check himself down there and it was also clean.
“Hmmmmmm?”here groaned, followed by a few coughs.
He did as he was told without another question beside his confused face.
Harry cleared his throat.
“Yeah?” Harry answered Hermione as he cleared his throat.
_____________________________________________
It must be nothing, Harry thought, but as he sat for lunch with Hermione —who was talking with Ginny about dresses for the ball while Luna was at the Ravenclaw table —he had a really hard time swallowing his food and drinking and breathing started to become a difficult task as well.
There, to his great surprise, he found himself hard once again.
“You alright?”
Once Ron had it, he said the words, “I solemnly swear that I’m up to no good”, and made sure Filch and Mrs. Norris were not on the last floor— the dungeons —and made his way there.
Once Harry buys the product he has in mind, he’s sure Draco will understand— he hopes, at least.
The red head was sure he was gonna receive a howler from Harry when he was finished with this, but maybe, just maybe, his best friend would appreciate what he did and thank him after his marriage with Malfoy...
Ps:hope you enjoyed the chapter!
He was in no mood to face Malfoy right now, but he knew he could do nothing to prevent their encounter, since they were like a magnet of opposite poles who attracted each other even against their own will.
Surprise, surprise, his eyes landed on the Slytherin table and found Malfoy’s piercing grey orbs.
So eager that it made that time when she was waiting for her OWL’s ressalta to come out seem like she was relaxed.
Nope! Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope!
Well, the second-best option would have to suffice. To the Ravenclaw tower he goes, still holding his breath whenever he remembered what the advice he was seeking was for. How funny was it that he was going to ask his best friend’s sister slash ex-girlfriend’s girlfriend for romantic advice about the guy he… liked.
Malfoys hands gripping the parchment, ready to rip it apart and throw it away.
“The game is back on, ALLELUJA. The big nose has the Quaffle again and, WOAH, careful with the Bludgers, you don’t want to hurt your own team members.”
McGonagall had announced that the Yule Ball would require formal robes —just like it was written in the letter— so almost everyone went there to buy theirs.
After some unsuccessful tries and some spells that rebounded and almost hit them both, he was finally fed up, “give up, Malfoy, you’re fucking with my patience.”
He shook his head to clear his thoughts, then turned to Pansy.

“Found it.” Malfoy smirked, pushing against he had before, making him burst with pleasure, not knowing the difference between inhaling and exhaling, his breath being as uncontrolled as the yells coming from him.
“How do we get out of here?” He asked after a while, putting his head in the middle of his knees, breathing heavily —and all Harry could do was par his back gently.
“What the fuck?” He yelled and pushed the person away from him, “Ron.”
At that moment, Harry’s smirk would even make the giant squid want to hide in the deepest lake in the world. Said smirk only existed, of course, because of the words replaying over and over in his head covered with dark hair: ‘I’ll show you how good I smell, Malfoy, just wait for it!’
“You—you smell like the cookies my mum used to make before the bottle...”
His knees gave out and he fell to the ground with an exasperated groan of frustration as the weight of his lack of luck pressed his shoulders down.
He took advantage of this alone time to think about the Yule Ball and what he’d do.
Harry was aware of the fact that he couldn’t hide anything from Hermione, but he also knew she, this year, was too concentrated on Ron to notice every step Harry made.
The “Potter stinks” badges!
“Next Hogsmeade weekend, meet me at Madam Malkin’s.”
He sat with his back to the magic wall and looked at the ferret’s useless attempts to escape.
“And they are together. As I was saying, I told Ginny what a ship is, it’s a muggle—“
Hermione was with Ginny doing “girl stuff”, which meant Ginny had dragged his girlfriend along with the other female Gryffindors to buy dresses.
He felt a chilly breath on the back of his neck that made his skin crawl and his hairs shiver.
He focused on the map once again:
And— and with Ginny, when he couldn't— couldn't do THAT, it was just because it wasn't the right time.
Harry, on the other hand, had just arrived at his dorm with great difficulty in the whole breathing area which complicated the process of walking up lots and lots of stairs.
Most people were already in their respective dorms- even though Harry was oblivious enough to not notice Luna and Ginny in the Ravenclaw one, nor did he notice Anna and Neville sneaking to the kitchens where he had just been a few moments ago.
Then, as she looked to her other side, she noticed Luna and Ginny, giggling at each other. They were touching more than usual. Luna, for example, seemed more focused than on reality than is normal, while Ginny seemed a bit loony —actually, Hermione noticed, they both seemed to be glowing in a strangely good way.
Ron was left alone with his best friends— being one of them his girlfriend who, fit some reason, was too eager for the first slow dance he had promised her.
