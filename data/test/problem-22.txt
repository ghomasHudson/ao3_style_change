His eyes slid to Malfoy’s bed as he heard a rustle.  Just as Harry stood, cracking the window in the hopes that the chilled air would chase away the last few images of his nightmare, Malfoy’s bed curtains parted as well, the blonde pausing on his knees at the edge of his bed.  Even after two months Harry was still not used to seeing Malfoy in such a personal setting.  His hair was tousled, damp with sweat at the nape of his neck, revealing a few waves.  He’d been wearing it differently this year, shorter on the sides, growing longer and usually swept to the side, longest tips trailing just below his ear.  It looked like it would be perfect for sliding his fingers through, holding on with a strong grip.
Draco cracked an eye open turning his head back to angle toward the curtain that hid the window and sun.  He shrugged, turning back around.  “Know a lot about my hygiene habits, Harry?”  His legs slid against Harry’s as he readjusted.
Closing the window, Harry decided he would likely never get another chance to be close to the blonde.  If sharing a bed, no matter how platonic and for mutual, non-sexual gain, was the closest he would ever get to Malfoy, he was going to take it.  Harry walked slowly over to Malfoy’s curtained bed.  Now he just had to convince Malfoy that this was still a good idea.
Tonight was just another in a long line for Harry, nearing 2 AM and he’d been awake behind his curtains for at least 25 minutes, muscles in his strong biceps still twitching with the memory of fighting a relentless, fierce grip.  Physical exercise was something he’d explored as a cure for his demons shortly after the war, jogging (sometimes sprinting) around the pond at the Burrow, quiet push-ups on the floor beside Ron’s bed, tossing gnomes for hours in the garden, chasing Teddy around Grimmauld Place while Andy laughed, doing anything the muggle way just in the hopes that he’d be tired enough to sleep that night.  It usually had no effect.
“I can practically hear your brain short circuiting.  Relax, Harry.”  Draco shifted, bringing the blanket further up his shoulder, eyes still closed.  Harry’s heartbeat picked up the pace at Draco’s rough, sleepy voice.  He could really get used to hearing that.
Harry lightly pecked Draco’s lips again after he’d stopped giggling.  “I’m glad to hear snogging me in your bed after getting more sleep than either of us have in a very long time is better than new socks.”
Draco Malfoy, from what Harry could tell, may be having just as many issues finding restful sleep as he was.  Once retiring for bed, they would both pull their bed curtains closed, so Harry couldn’t be sure when Malfoy fell asleep for the night or when he woke, but there had been several nights when Harry had been sat up in bed, thoughts dripping residual grime from that night’s torture, and he would hear Malfoy’s uneven breathing and shifting.  He seemed to still be in the denial stage, fighting the inevitable and chasing sleep.  Harry was well into bargaining with the elusive Sandman, willing to do almost anything to pry some deep, dreamless sleep from his fictional fingers.
Harry snorted and nudged Malfoy’s shoulder.  “Fair enough, Draco.”  The sound felt good on his tongue.
Harry’s face was warm.  Heat was racing through his whole body, tingling spasms waking him up from the outside in and back again.  He moved his hand up Draco’s back, fingers moving to slid into the soft hair at the base of his neck. “Even better than a dream, Draco.  At least I hope so.  The day dream version of you is really good at snogging though.  So I’m not sure if you can live up to that or not.”  Harry grinned, gaze dropping to Draco’s lips.
“Yea, well.  I guess you’re quite a bit different than I thought you were too.  Not nearly as conceited and self-obsessed.  Though don’t think I didn’t notice you bring up your ‘track record’ to convince me you could keep me safe.  To be fair though, you’re not wrong.”  He paused, breathing softly.  “Thank you for being willing to try this.”
Malfoy’s cheeks flushed a deep pink as he spun around, already halfway back to his bed before Harry could finish his thought.  “Never mind,” Malfoy said, curtains snapping back together, hiding him from view.
Standing still, chill evening air still washing over him, Harry’s mind raced. Malfoy wanted to share a bed with him?  Did he fancy Harry?  Think about him the way Harry imagined the blonde?  What would happen if Harry took him up on his offer?  Could he restrain himself from touching the blonde?  Running his hand down his arm, feeling the light dusting of fair hair against his fingertips?  He’d certainly get hard in minutes being that close to Malfoy, vulnerable, sleepy, and relaxed.  What if he talked in his sleep?  What if his nightmares turned to fantasies that close to who he’d been desiring?  Maybe he could play it off as moans of pain, moaning Malfoy’s name because he was seeing him tortured?
“Well, I won’t say I can offer you the same level of comfort and familiarity as your girlfriend was able to provide, but I think you’d feel safe with me.  I mean, my track record is pretty good.”  He stepped closer to the bed and shrugged.  “And I do trust you not to hurt me in my sleep.  You’ve had opportunity to do so over the last two months if that’s really what you wanted to do.  And I know it’s not.  You’re very different than you were be-“
Draco shrugged.  “It was a close call.”  He rested on top of Harry, tucking his head against his chest, forehead pressed to Harry’s neck.  “We’ll definitely have to gather more data before we can draw any final conclusions.”
“Does it help,” Malfoy asked quietly, coming over to stand at the other side of the window, stripped pajama top shifted slightly to the right, showing more collar bone than he probably intended.
Draco captured Harry’s lips again, rolling over him and pressing him against the rumpled bed.  He wove the fingers of both of his hands into Harry’s wild jet-black hair and pulled him back half an inch to speak.  “Better than brand new socks.”  He grinned, eyes looking darker with wider pupils and tried to kiss Harry again as the other giggled against his attack.
Harry’s stomach tightened, his heart picking up pace. He blinked, brows lowering.  Certainly he hadn’t heard Malfoy invite him to sleep with him.  Clearly he’d said “sleep next to brie” or “sweep west of the sea”.  Something like that.  Nothing close to sharing a bed with a classmate he’d imagined kissing beneath his ear, throat flexing beneath his lips.  He looked up at Malfoy, the blonde worrying his lip between his teeth and staring out the window.  “Did…what did…”
Malfoy’s gaze dropped to the floor, out the window, to Harry’s shoulder, and at Harry’s bed before meeting his again.  Voice low and barely above a whisper, he said “sleep next to me.”
Harry blinked a few times, a small shake of his head and turned to look out at the sky.   That seemed to be happening more and more recently the longer he spent around Malfoy.  He’d find his mind wandering in History or Magic or Potions, easy to do, and his eyes would trail the movement of Malfoy’s fingers as they precisely diced a flower stem or twirled his eagle owl quill.  What would those hands feel like spread across his back, fingers running down the ridge of his spine?
Harry sighed softly and tightened his grip in Draco’s hair, changing the angle of their kiss.  He moved his leg between Draco’s when the blonde skated his tongue across Harry’s lips.  With a quiet moan from Draco, Harry parted his lips and welcomed him with a quick nip to his lower lip.  Hands roamed, discovering spots worth revisiting.
Grey eyes flashed at the challenge, as they always did when Harry was on the other side of it.  His hand tightened on Harry’s neck, pulling him so close their bodies pressed together at every point.  Draco smirked, breathe mingling with Harry’s.  “I’ll put him to shame.”  He swiftly closed his eyes and closed the remaining distance between their lips.
The small space inside the bed curtains was still and silent for several breaths.  Harry counted the strong beats of Draco’s heart. At 9, Draco rolled towards him, grey eyes meeting green, face pinker than a pigmy puff Harry had seen in Hogsmeade last weekend.  The blonde’s eyes moved over Harry’s face, gliding over his lips, flicking up to his hair, and back to meet his gaze.  Draco licked his lips quickly and blinked a few times.  “I’m pretty sure I’m dreaming.  It’s a nice change from the torture my nightmares normally put me through.  A very nice change.”  He brought his hand up and lightly traced the edge of his index finger down the side of Harry’s face, resting his hand against Harry’s neck.
“Does what help what,”  Harry’s voice still holding a bit of gruff from his likely dream-induced screaming.
Harry shook his arms out, trying to expel the edgy feeling that lingered there, and moved to the side of his bed, legs parting the curtains.  Maybe he’d chance a walk through the halls tonight.  The teachers were a little more lax with the curfew for the 8ths years, but he was pretty sure wandering the castle at this time would earn more than a concerned frown from any of them.
Malfoy’s curtains parted revealing his guarded pale face.  “I only offered because over the summer while I was staying with Pansy, she’d sleep next to me and it was comforting knowing that someone was there, someone could watch my back.  Even though she was sleeping as well, I felt safer.  Maybe this won’t work, you know, with everything that has happened between us.  I’m not sure you could feel safe that close to me and unguarded.”  He looked down, his expression dejected, like he yearned for that openness with Harry but knew they would never reach that level in their relationship.
His nose incessantly itched.  Harry brought his hand up to rub his nose for what must have been the sixth time that morning, still half asleep.  He paused, hand against his face, and finally noticed the cause of the irritation.  Hair.  Hair that wasn’t his.    He cracked his eyes open, noticed the muted sunlight that glowed at the edge of the bed curtains.  It was Saturday morning and he was in Draco Malfoy’s bed.  Not only that, but he had at some point completely wrapped the blonde up in his arms, his left under Draco’s head, his right hovering at his face still.  Their legs as well intertwined, warm and relaxed.
Draco moved closer, enough so Harry could feel the low heat coming off of his crossed arms.  He shifted from one foot to the other and back again, shoulders tightening. “Listen, I’m only going to offer this because it worked for me and we both, clearly, need some help to get through the night.”
Harry raised an eyebrow.  Malfoy had something that could help him sleep, to not relive his worst memories, to not spiral down into wicked new twists and turns of his tortuous imagination? Why hadn’t Malfoy already been using whatever potion, meditation, or what have you if he knew of something?  “I’d be very interested in giving anything a try.”
Malfoy turned to face Harry more fully, grey eyes catching the moonlight and shining.  “Does the fresh air help you with…” He paused, crossing his arms over his chest.  “Does it help you forget what you still see?”  His voice was so quiet, like he was ashamed of telling a secret.
He at least could be grateful that Mrs. Weasley, under eyes forever shadowed and smile strained, had sat next to him on the tweed print couch in the Burrow’s living room one indecently early morning after neither had slept more than about 3 hours and gently guided him through the wand movements needed for a strong noise canceling shield charm he could apply around his bed every night.  He was sure every member of his unofficial adoptive family who was still living at home was sleeping better after that night, him and Molly excluded.  He had yet to find a cure for the darkness that seeped through his dreams, but at least he would not disturb them, or his new roommate, anymore.
Hermione’s brow furrowed slightly as she tried to comprehend what Harry was saying. “If you say so Harry, just, be careful. Please?” Her voice had a note of pleading in it.
He woke the next morning to a crash in the kitchen and jumped up out of the bed. He grabbed his wand and rushed out of the room. When he ran into the kitchen, he was greeted by a flour covered, purple haired Teddy, beaming up at him, batter covered whisk in hand.
“You try to save everyone Harry. It’s just who you are. I just wish you hadn’t saved me. But then again, I’m getting what I deserve now instead.” Draco noticed Harry’s expression change and he couldn’t hold back. “I mean, after the war of course I got shit. Even after the trial where you stood for Mother and I. But I expected that. I thought that would be the last of it and eventually people would get over it or realize that some people don’t remain the same person. And most people did, my boss forgets most days what I’ve done or who I was associated with and it makes me happy.” A small smile tugged at Draco’s mouth for a second but faded as he continued. “But now, it’s not people remembering who or what I was, it’s life that’s deciding that I don’t deserve a second chance. My father passed, but I honestly don’t fucking care about that prat, but it’s been hard on mother. She seems as if she’s withering away most days and it breaks my fucking heart and I can’t take it most days when she lets me see her. My
Draco simply nodded. “I did that to myself, all I wanted back then was to be your friend, and I was immensely jealous that you had already made friends at that time, and I had been raised in such a way that I was prejudice towards other wizarding families and other magical bloodlines that it kicked me in the arse.” He lowered his head to look at the cup in his hand, which was now empty. “I’m so sorry.” He whispered so low that he thought Harry couldn’t hear him, but to his surprise, he was wrong.
“If you’re sure.” Draco shrugged walked towards the dining room. Potter walked over and set a plate full of food in front of him. He looked down in amazement at the pile of eggs, toast, bacon, potatoes and a glass of orange juice in front of him. He looked up at Potter to tell him thank you and noticed the man hadn’t even waited for him to say anything and saw him digging into his own plate. Draco watched him for a moment and noticed that he was a very uncivilized eater, shoveling food into his mouth as if it were his last meal, or only meal. He scrunched up his face at this when Potter looked up from his food finally.
“Yeah.” Harry suddenly looked down at his feet, not understanding why he felt weird about the whole thing.
“As Teddy has said, I do already call you Draco, which you haven’t seemed to mind, I don’t mind if you call me Hermione.” She smiled softly and kissed Teddy on the forehead.
He stood in the fireplace for a moment, taking in the office that once belonged to Professor Dumbledore, now belonging to Professor McGonagall, and a wave of calm had washed over him. He looked up when he heard the sound of scratching from across the room, he saw Professor McGonagall sitting there at the large desk head down and pouring over whatever she was writing, completely invested to the point that Harry had thought she didn’t notice him come in.
Thank you to everyone who has left kudos! I really appreciate it. If anyone would like to leave a comment, good or bad, either way I appreciate it.
“Well, Ron,” Draco nodded, “Hermione, Draco is perfectly fine with me.” He smiled at the two of them. Teddy hopped off of Hermione’s lap and ran to Draco, hugging him around the neck.
“Well of course! It was something I had never experienced in all my time as the Sorting Hat. Which is a long time might I add.” The Sorting Hat smiled remembering the years he’s had at Hogwarts.
Draco grimaced once he heard his name. He didn’t want to turn to look at the man standing just to his right, he didn’t want to see the smug face of “The Chosen One”. He just wanted to run, run as far as his feet could take him. But he knew that with Potter already standing there next to him, looking at the state that he was currently in, probably judging him with every drag of the cigarette he held between his fingers, that the option to run was not really an option at all.
Harry nodded and finally looked up at Draco. “Yes, Teddy Lupin. And yes, he’s your second cousin. And you’d be surprised to know,” Harry paused and sighed heavily. “He actually knows who you are.”
“Oh…” Ron hung his head; he knew that this wasn’t easy for Harry when that happened to Teddy. “Well I’m sure he’ll be okay mate. You know that doesn’t last long. What color was his hair when he woke up?”
“I’m so sorry Draco! Ronald! You know better than to just hug people out of nowhere!” Draco’s head snapped to the sound of the new voice in the room and saw Hermione Granger standing in the doorway, a stern look on her face that he knew so well from all of those years in school, but instead of it being towards him, it was towards Weasley.
?” Harry’s voice sounded somewhat defensive, but Draco noticed the small smile that tugged at the corners of his mouth.
A cough from behind the both of them interrupted the conversation and they both turned to see a tall red-headed man standing behind them, a tray of pies in one hand, and a pie going into his mouth with the other.
Harry turned to Draco with a triumphant smile on his face, “See! I told you I was supposed to be in Slytherin originally!”
When he stepped out, he performed a shaving charm to clear the hair from his face, applied the facial creams and potions that he had on the shelf that he hadn’t used in so long he almost forgot that they were there. He pulled half of his long hair up, in an effort to make it look more presentable and looked himself over once more. He figured he looked well enough and made his way to his closet. He looked over all of the clothes that he hadn’t worn in months, seeing as he had only wore his work robes on a daily basis and never left the house anymore,
Harry couldn’t make any sense of what was going on in his life. Malfoy had been in his sitting room two nights in a row now. Malfoy never says anything, never looks at Harry besides the initial look through the floo to make sure he can enter, and he leaves without a word. What was his world coming to? Malfoy, of all people was just waltzing into his home, drinking his alcohol, and walking out. But Harry had noticed something had changed with Malfoy the second night of him stopping over. Malfoy seemed to have more stress written on his face, but he didn’t seem to look as in pain as he had the night before. Harry still didn’t understand what was going on but maybe, just maybe, it would either stop and he could just forget about it, or it would continue, and he could eventually ask Malfoy what was going on. That is, if Malfoy even knew what was going on himself.
Draco looked at Harry as Teddy walked out of the room and they both sat in silence for a moment before Harry stood up and headed towards the sitting room. He looked back at Draco when he was halfway to the room, “Would you like to come sit?” Draco nodded and followed the man and sat down in the armchair as Harry sat down on the couch.
Sorry that it has taken me literal months to update the story. Between work and my laptop taking a crap on me, I've had this chapter written for months. I finally got a new computer and am finally able to update the story on a regular basis. Thanks for all the kudos and love!
Malfoy turned around and walked over to the armchair opposite the couch. He slumped and sighed as he sat, the fire lighting his face. Harry looked over at him, taking a look at his face, and if he had thought that Malfoy looked worse for wear when he had run into him at the pub earlier, it was nothing compared to what he looked like now. Malfoy had raised his hand to his temple and gently massaged, a look of pain on his face as he did so.
“Daddy!” Yelled a small voice in his ear. Harry pulled back the blue mess from his face and was looking directly at the vivid, now purple, eyes of his godson Teddy.
Teddy’s eyes lit up, and for the first time, Draco saw the boy's talent in action, as his eyes turned from the bright violet, to a fierce yellow, almost as bright and fierce as the sun. Draco stared for just a moment at Teddy and then up at Harry. Harry looked over at Teddy and noticed the drastic change in the boy's eyes. “Hey buddy?” Harry piped up, making the boy turn to look at him. “Remember, not everyone is used to your gifts?” Teddy turned back to Draco with a shocked expression.
. What he was seeing in Harry as he watched his godson was a look of complete pride and love for the boy. He noticed as he was staring at Harry that he had never, in all their years of knowing each other, seen the man next to him with such happiness. This thought struck him to his core and the pang of sadness in his stomach overwhelmed him. He sat in this pain for only a moment when he felt a hand on his shoulder. He looked up and noticed Harry looking at him with concern across his face.
The two men looked at each other, unsure of this revelation made by an eight-year-old. “I mean, I’m okay with it, if you are
Harry turned back to face his friends and thought for a moment. “Yeah, I guess I am.” He chuckled to himself and went back to his work, not turning back to look at his friends as they shrugged at each other and left his office.
“Well then how am I supposed to help someone who wants help, but won’t ask for help, and doesn’t even know he needs or wants it?” Harry leaned back in his chair frustrated.
Once home Teddy devoured his food in an unrecognizable amount of time, raced to his bedroom and dove into his toys. Harry finished his meal a short time after, walked over to Teddy’s room and leaned against the doorframe. He smiled and looked in on the young boy, hair now a light bubblegum pink, eyes a deep brown, and holding a picture in his hand. Harry heard a small sniffle come from Teddy and walked into the room and sat down beside his godson. He had already known what picture he was looking at based on the color of his hair, it only turned that color when he was looking at one of Harry’s old photos of Teddy’s parents and 2 of Harry’s favorite people.
“Yes, I would love to keep Teddy.” Harry nodded with enthusiasm to the woman who sat opposite him. He couldn’t believe it. He would be able to have Teddy here, in his home, all the time. Harry stared at her in disbelief, trying to wrap his head around the thought of it, and he knew that there was nothing better in his life that could happen in that moment.
“Actually, when it comes to you, he doesn’t tell us much. Just that you two have been spending more time together and that this little monster seems to just adore you.” She smiled and looked down at Teddy who was now playing with a necklace that she wore, and ruffled his hair, which was a bright green at this moment.
The nightly routine of Malfoy coming into Harry’s sitting room had continued for the rest of the week and on Saturday morning, Harry sent an owl to his old professor, Minerva McGonagall, asking if he could come by the school and speak with her, that he needed to get her view on what was going on and in all honesty, he just wanted to see the school again, and her. He received her reply within the hour and she had told him that her door was always open for him and that if he had the time, to come by that same day, her floo would be open for the rest of the day if needed. Harry smiled at the parchment in his hand, sent an owl to Andromeda to let her know that he would be out of the house for the afternoon and if she needed to get in touch with him he would be at the school with McGonagall, and took off through the floo to Hogwarts.
“Harry? What would you like for lunch? I’m sure you’re not fond of young Teddy eating cake for lunch.”
“He’s good. Full of energy as ever. But last night…” Harry trailed off remembering the bubblegum pink hair Teddy sported as he fell asleep.
“Ignoring that ridiculous statement aside, I’m talking about McGonagall.” She stopped and looked at Harry intently.
Being an Auror wasn’t as dangerous at it was when he first joined. The first couple of years consisted of finding any former Death Eaters that had escaped arrest and trial right after the war. The thought of the consistent field work with Ron, hunting down some of the most dangerous and lethal, made Harry smile as he walked down the sidewalk on the busy London streets. But now, now it was just picking up random one-offs. Someone broke into a store, someone was smuggling illegal potions from outside of the country, a duel had gone off in front of Muggles between two irritable Wizards who had gotten drunk and couldn’t agree on the next location. It had all gotten so bland and predictable for Harry that it didn’t have the draw to it like it used to.
Harry smiled and ruffled Teddy’s hair as he sat down across from McGonagall, Draco following him and sitting in the armchair next to him. “I think just some sandwiches will do fine McGonagall, thank you.”
“You have a son?” Harry’s disbelief shone through in his tone more than he would have preferred, so he tried to correct himself. “I didn’t mean for that to come out as rude as it did Draco. I just meant that I didn’t know you had a son, I’m surprised I hadn’t heard about him.”
“I see that the two of you go married?” He said, nodding to their hands. The both smiled and nodded at him. “So you’re a Weasley now, huh Granger? Might want to think about changing your hair color.” He smiled to himself, then hoped that he hadn’t said anything insulting to the two of them. He looked up at them, wondering if he’d be met with glares, but instead, they were both laughing.
“Yes, when it was put on my head, it talked about how if I was in Slytherin I would be destined for greatness, but being eleven and impressionable, I was told that all bad witches and wizards were put in Slytherin, so I just kept repeating “not Slytherin” under my breath until it changed my house.”
“Well,” Hermione blushed at the words. “I appreciate that Harry, but I wasn’t talking about me, because, yes, I may be smart, but I’m not the
“You’re -,” Harry stopped suddenly. He hadn’t realized that Draco had held on to their childhood problems. Harry had forgotten about most of them by now, all aside from their sixth year. “You’re bringing up childhood shit, NOW? If you haven’t forgotten, which it seems you obviously have, I turned down your handshake at eleven because you were degrading the only friend I had made in my life at that time. I let Hermione punch you because you tormented HER. YOU called her a mudblood, YOU tried to get an innocent animal killed and then reveled in it. And as of sixth year,” Harry’s voice had calmed at this point, because this was the one moment in school that he truly regretted his whole life. “I never meant to try and kill you. I didn’t even know what that spell did.” He hung his head at the final words he spoke.
“Scorpius.” He said instantly. He knew it was odd that he had picked out his child’s name before he had any children but he had read the name in one of his favorite stories and from that moment he knew that he would name his first son that. He looked back down at his son, watching him look around the room, back at Draco, over to Astoria and Draco couldn’t take his eyes off him. Draco heart was full for the first time in his life and basked in that moment for as long as he could.
“I KNOW!” He giggled again and waved his hand and suddenly there were miniature people loading the train with their own small luggage, a conductor climbing into the front, and miniature people off to the side waving to the passengers.
“Thank you for reading to Ted.” Harry said softly after taking a sip of his scotch. “I had started to grow tired of Babbity Rabbity.” He had brought his fingers to his temple and had slowly started to massage them.
“He hasn’t been told much, just that your mum and his grandmother are sisters. He’s seen some of your pictures from your school days. Apparently, your mum had sent a few photos to ‘Meda a few years back when she was trying to make amends and wanted Teddy to know more of who his family were.”
Draco and Harry sat in silence for almost an hour before Harry finally got tired of the quiet and spoke up.
Ron looked down at Draco’s hand, which he instantly thought he would swat away, or yell at him to get out of his family home, but then the unexpected happened. Ron pulled him in for a hug. A hug. Something that almost made Draco scream in surprise but when he looked down at Teddy, he saw the light in the boy’s eyes brighten so much as more people he cared about meeting and getting together that he couldn’t help but smile even more and return the hug.
“Aunt Minnie?” Teddy piped up as soon as Draco and Harry reached them. McGonagall turned to look at the boy, who was now sitting next to her in a transfigured desk small enough for Teddy. “Can we have lunch with you today?”
Harry sighed as he rolled out of bed, the small boy bouncing behind him. He made his way to the kitchen, placed Teddy on the counter and began to make pancakes. He was absent mindedly thinking to himself as he piled the plate high, Teddy laughing wildly with every pancake that Harry added, when the thought of Malfoy in his sitting room came back to him. He still couldn’t figure out what any of it meant or why Malfoy even came by his house. He was still trying to figure out why any of that happened when Teddy had pulled him out of his thoughts. He had looked up and saw Teddy with a mouthful of pancake and a fistful of another one.
Teddy nodded and his face scrunched up with curiosity back at Draco. “Whatcha got behind your back?” He pointed around Draco, noticing his arm bent behind him.
A small cough across the room caught their attention. They both turned to see McGonagall back at her desk, but this time Teddy was sitting in her lap coloring.
Harry spun around and looked at her, noticing her expression and feared the worst. His stomach dropped. He couldn’t lose Teddy too; he was all that he had left outside of his friends. “Is he okay?” He said hesitantly, fearing the worst.
Draco had tried to say no, that he needed to leave, that he didn’t know how, but Teddy was giving him ‘sad eyes’, according to Harry, and didn’t take no for an answer. Draco eventually gave in and let Teddy pull him into the kitchen, bouncing the whole way.
Draco looked up at him and nodded. He wasn’t sure if he could open up about it, especially not to Harry, but knowing that there was someone in the world that would listen, and, Draco felt, wouldn’t judge him, made him feel better about it. “You mind if I stop by again tomorrow?” His voice sounded hopeful, much to his surprise.
Harry had sat down next to Teddy and looked over at the toy. He looked up at Malfoy in amazement of the toy when he noticed it was a stuffed wolf that was charmed to change colors every couple of seconds. “Daddy…” Teddy whispered. Harry looked down at the boy, who hadn’t taken his eyes off the stuffed wolf, “It’s just like me.”
“Yes, he’s been coming to my house nightly. He came over Saturday and we finally talked after I went and saw McGonagall. And he came back by on Sunday which is when I let slip about Teddy so naturally I had him come by yesterday to meet him.”
When Harry looked down, mostly to beg for permission, Draco’s little nod and mischievous expression was enough to send him shooting hard into Draco’s throat. The entire time, his hands were tangled tight between strands of white-blond hair, trying
Now that they were a mere few steps apart, Harry could see the weariness in all its fine detail. The dark circles under his eyes were so stark, contrasting to the pale skin gone sallow from lack of rest. Even the former sparkle in Draco’s eyes had dulled to a plain grey. Lines marred the otherwise clear skin of his face, making him appear far older than Harry knew him to be. It wasn’t a genetic thing, because neither Lucius nor Narcissa had shown any signs of age until they were playing house with Voldemort.
Still glaring daggers at each other, Draco reached out for the scroll, then turned on his heel and stormed out of the Great Hall.
Turned out, Hagrid wasn’t great with written summaries. The project he had planned was far more involved than just mucking out stalls.
that day—it developed into things like: Draco ducking in a crowd of people and just moving with the mass, despite sticking out like a sore thumb, or not-so-subtly summoning his broom inside the castle for a speedy get-away—only to be halted by Headmistress McGonagall and marched straight to her office, all the while her lecture streamed through the echoey halls like some kind of Howler gone rogue.
“You’ll find a list of your project assignments along with your individual class schedules on your beds.” Headmistress McGonagall stood in front of the large fireplace, that beautifully adorned the new eighth-year common room. Only a few of them had returned for this attempt at re-doing their missed year, more than expected but still less than worth separating. It made sense to put them all in their own space, given what had happened to them all in the last year, and their relative ages.
“Need you to walk away, if you aren’t sure about this.” Harry twitched, the wolf hating the intentional denial of things to come. “I can’t hold back much longer.”
Before he could even think about stopping himself, and ignoring the fact that they were still very much out in the open hallway, Harry dropped to his knees and burrowed his face right into the thatch of hair springing out around Draco’s cock. The heady scent was strongest here. Harry felt the drool pooling out of his mouth as he quickly undid the trappings of his own trousers.
Harry had been there for both his friends, but they understood he couldn’t choose between them, especially now when he was going through his own life-altering changes. Between his harrowing ordeal and the start of term, Harry had sent letters to every friendly werewolf he knew. In an unusual display of humbleness, Harry asked for help, suggestions, anything that might help him get through the changes each month. However, the most problematic hurdle came during the week of his first full moon of the school year.
Harry couldn’t see, but he felt Pansy’s hand on his arm and assumed the same had to be true of Hermione.
Hermione made a strangled noise that pulled Harry’s attention. Opening his eyes, he saw that she was bright red, and stammering; meanwhile, Pansy was resting her chin in her palm, grinning.
Before Draco could complete the sentence, Harry pinned him against the stone wall. There was a noise not unlike a growling snarl, which Harry realised was coming from him. He grabbed the front of Draco’s uniform with his fists, and despite the aggressive energy radiating off of him, the whole thing felt extremely intimate considering they were practically breathing in each other’s space.
he grasped his cock with a firm hand, giving a few solid tugs from base to tip. Fuck, he was so incredibly beautiful, even if it was just in Harry’s mind. Draco was all limbs and attitude, packaged in the creamiest of wrappings. Harry wanted to beg, to fall on his knees and beg for just a taste. Imaginary Draco smirked, moving his wrist faster and faster.
“Actually, it’s due to both himself and Mr Potter. If I understand correctly, Mr Potter, you hold Mr Malfoy’s former wand?”
When the morning returned, Harry rolled over onto his stomach, feeling drained and fuzzy from the day before. Molly was right of course; the more he allowed himself to succumb to the maudlin emotions threatening to overwhelm everything, the more he started to confuse dreams with real life.
Like predator and helpless prey, Harry started to circle Draco, herding him closer to the center. Perhaps the most surprising thing to Harry, was that despite the way he was moving backwards—towards the tree arched over the lake—Draco appeared not to be afraid. It wasn’t written in his body language, and it certainly wasn’t anywhere in his
“Next time, you’ll be riding me. I’ll make sure of it.” Harry practically growled in Draco’s ear, hips slowly pistoning their way in and out. Every inch of himself was surrounded by slick, snug, heat; his mind slowly getting lost to the dark fog of desire that overwhelmed his senses. Draco groaned, hips pushing back against Harry of their own accord.
The rumbling growls from Harry were the only thing punctuating the silence as Draco appeared to contemplate his options. Silver hues caught nearly glowing emeralds, and a voice that trembled with suppressed desire answered.
“I respect your courage.” Harry replied simply. It didn’t answer every question, but they hadn’t reached a place where they could delve into deeper topics yet. The idea that perhaps eventually they might? It was new, intriguing, and filled him with a strange tickling feeling in his belly.
“You know I don’t believe you, right?” But she didn’t push it. At least, not in the way most people did around Harry. Instead, Molly turned her gaze towards the window.
“Well, the Hogwarts project is almost complete right? Maybe you both need a little holiday, or something?”
“Okay but I, I don’t understand it. How is this possible? I died. I know I did, I remember feeling …” Draco trailed off and shuddered, wrapping his arms around his bare chest.
“Alright there, Malfoy?” Harry called out to the passing blond, who looked up with a rather perplexed expression. Steel-grey eyes narrowed, but the blond head bowed in a nod. At least they were trying. That was all Harry could ask for.
People went by him without noticing, most simply laughing and talking game stats to each other, before hitting the showers. Harry, however, was stuck in that one moment. The moment when his whole world came crashing down around him because of Draco’s
As if Draco’s scent alone wasn’t enough to drive him nearly up the wall with lust, but now he was also covered in Harry’s scent. He was completely marked by Harry. Even if no one else knew. Harry knew. His inner wolf was practically insane with desire and possession.
’ Draco murmured as Harry sank to his knees, practically shouting as his orgasm overcame him. His shots of come washed down the drain before he could even think about everything that had just happened. Including the sure amounts of guilt he was likely to experience the next time he came face to face with Draco. Pun excluded.
“Oh. Uh.” Harry felt sheepish, not having fully listened to Draco’s argument. “I dunno. I don’t really care either way I guess?”
“Harry! You have to come quick.” Hermione shouted at Harry, while running full tilt towards him. At Harry’s confused expression, she flailed her arms about in distress while yelling further. “Harry, it’s Draco!”
“He’s not getting any better. If anything... He’s getting worse.” Harry sighed, rubbing a hand through his quite messy hair.
His dream of working as an Auror had fallen flat, but it didn’t seem to matter when faced with the news that he’d managed to get his entire team killed in that one raid.
“You see, Harry Potter, I know you have lost a great many people over the years. Too many for such a short time on Earth.”
, Harry whimpered quietly—despite the very heavy sound Muffling Charms he’d thrown up after locking his door—and bit down on his lower lip, before shakily bringing the fabric to his face.
“When I lost Fred, it was the most excruciating pain I’d ever felt. Not even a Cruciatus could have hurt me more in that moment. But I couldn’t allow myself to wallow too deeply within my grief, because my family needed me. George needed me.”
Unable to hold it back anymore, Harry moaned loudly as he continued to stroke himself, and the sound echoed reverberated across the tiled bathroom walls. His imaginary Draco moved slow, tantalizingly so, until
The air was muddled with Draco’s scent, peppered with the scent of both of their arousals, and fuck if that wasn’t the most life-changing thing Harry had ever smelled. He was starting to understand what Bill had been talking about before. Despite what they’d gone through, or the fact they could scarcely even be considered friends, Harry would die for Draco. There was something about the feral bonding scent building between them that labeled Draco as Harry’s. If not to anyone else, it was clear as day for Harry.
Without bothering to say goodbye, change, or shower, Harry forced his body to turn and run right out of there. The problem was, left to make its own choices, his wolf would have strutted right into the shower area and completely marked itself all over the blond Slytherin. Which, given the fact that he’d singlehandedly been vehemently protesting against the mistreatment of Slytherins, would have been a
“Oh! ‘Mione, we still on for tonight? I’ve got about three feet of parchment due for Flitwick tomorrow.” Pansy slid into her usual seat beside Hermione. Harry grinned as he watched them banter about late papers, while shoving forkfuls of roast down his gullet.
The lack of sleep was quite apparent on Harry’s face the next morning. Everyone could see the dark circles under his eyes as well as the pale pallor tinging his skin. While activity flurried around him, Harry let his cheek rest on the table, practically melting into the wooden grain, while he listened to Hermione pour herself and Pansy—who’d yet to arrive—a cup of tea.
Panic rippled through the class, and Hermione yelled at Harry to close his eyes, lest he become infatuated with the first person he sees. Harry did as he was commanded, but he didn’t feel overly affected by the potion. If anything, what he’d felt yesterday was worse. By the thousands.
But not once would Draco talk about his ageing body. There were a few times Harry wondered if Draco had been cursed at some point, and if he was refusing to get checked out because he felt it was a justified punishment for his lot in life. Whatever the reason, Harry was terrified that whatever was happening revolved around dark magic, and he’d lose Draco just as they’d finally gotten together.
But by the time the day came for both of them to make a selection, neither of them could agree. Draco wanted to do something related to potions, and Harry was still determined to work with the Quidditch teams—but their arguing took so long that they arrived five minutes late to the sign ups, making them the last pair.
“Come on, we’re going to McGonagall. This is completely unacceptable.” Draco Malfoy’s tone was venom and ice, which would have been entertaining in the years prior, but Harry felt ambivalent about the man’s irritation.
In Harry’s stomach, something squirmed. Below, his cock pulsed eagerly. “Is that right?” Pressing forward at an angle, Harry tried pushing forward and found very little resistance. “Nngh- Fuck, D-Draco you...Tell me about it. I want to hear everything.” His voice was rough with need.
With that, Draco dropped down on his knees in an imitation of what Harry had just done. Except Draco actually followed through with wrapping his lips tight around the tip of Harry’s leaking prick. The scent of Draco’s climax still lingered on Harry’s face, drowning him in foggy desperation. He tried to keep his hips still, so as not to choke the blond on his knees, but the feel of that warm mouth sliding down as far as it could go, and the gentle tickle of hands on his bollocks, killed him.
Of course, the jump from “unknown person” to “Draco sodding Malfoy” was not that far a jump when he was this far gone—especially with that jersey practically shoved in Harry’s nose.
Harry sighed, but Hermione was most likely right. It wasn’t like Draco was willingly talking about his issues, at least not the ones that he could see. They’d talked about a million and a half things, from basics regarding favourite foods, to harder topics such as their respective childhoods.
His hearing returned in a rush, and with it the sound of pounding at his bedroom door. Hermione hated being late for classes, especially if Harry was the reason she was lagging behind. Harry quickly rinsed the rest of himself and dressed in half the time it usually took, while using charms to dry the rest of himself off.
Either Draco wasn’t getting it, or he was purposely ignoring the warning, because Harry could hear the clapping steps of his shoes against the stone floor.
“Uh…” Harry tried to think back but shook his head, defeated. “It hasn’t seemed all that important.”
“Don’t start. We just had this argument two days ago.” The blond replied bitterly. “I don’t like fighting with you. We’ve done it for seven years now, I think we’ve earned the break.”
“Somehow, I don’t think that’s going to be a problem. The way you smell to me…” Harry closed his eyes, overwhelmed by the sensations all over again. “I doubt I will ever forget now.”
“What the-” Harry practically shouted, startled by the sight of blond hair fanned out across a feather pillow.
“I was thinking of grabbing tea. I thought you could probably use some too?” Harry fumbled over words he hadn’t planned on saying. But now that they were out, he stood tall and offered his hand. What Draco was doing—being at Hogwarts, atoning for the crimes of his Father and most likely the guilt he felt for his own part—was far braver an act than any of them had expected. Most assumed he would have hidden himself away until the world forgot his name.
Odd. But Harry didn’t have the time to linger on it further because the doors to the Great Hall opened and trouble flew on the wind right for his nose.
The first sign of trouble showed up around two hours later. Harry had worked up a sweat respelling some of the wards with McGonnagal’s help, while Draco was inside spelling various portraits back in their places. He’d worked a bit on restoring those which had sustained spell damage, and for the most part, everything seemed to be going well.
“Nothing’s wrong mother, it’s just taking longer than expected.” He smiled a small smile at his mother to try and calm her some. He noticed a sigh from her and saw that the tenseness she held and subdued a great deal. “Thank you for coming.” He whispered as he took one of her hands from the other and leaned his head against her shoulder.
He looked at the man next to him apprehensively, “You could say that.” Harry said slowly, waiting for the worst.
“Oh, Harry!” A voice called out from around the corner as Draco was still taking in the amazement that was just the kitchen alone. He turned his head towards the voice and an unmistakable head of red hair had just entered the room. He had started to back away as Mrs. Weasley had rushed into the kitchen but was stopped by a hand on his wrist, that he looked down to notice was Harry’s, which led up to the man turning to look at him with those same eyes, that same smile, that same… everything. He breathed again and planted himself where he stood, now feeling stronger and a bit more confident.
“I’m really sorry Andromeda. I had run into an old schoolmate of mine on the way home who was in a bad spot and- “
“I’m not a Saint, Malfoy. I just like to help people.” Harry sighed, looking down at his feet. “I guess it’s more of the fact that everyone I know has been through so much shit, I want them to know that they aren’t alone in it. That they have someone to talk to about it all. I just, I went through so much shit, so much fucking shit, and didn’t have anyone who I could talk to, or who would listen, for the longest time, that I knew I never wanted anyone to feel that way. Especially after the war. Even now, even though it’s been almost a decade since. Some people opened up about it immediately after, before I was even sure I could talk about it. And in all honesty, I never really have opened up, I’ve never fully gotten how I felt out there, never told anyone what I saw in my dreams, never told anyone about how I felt during and after everything. But if I could help someone get through it all, then it would be okay.” Harry looked up, not knowing the response he was going to get from the man sitting across from him. He didn’t expect it all to come out like that, it just did. But there was no way or point in taking it all back now. So, he just, waited.
“Well I guess that means I’ll be going then.” Draco stood from his now favorite armchair and headed towards the floo.
Draco stared at the card a little longer after Potter had left him in front of the pub. It was getting colder outside due to it getting later, but he pulled out another cigarette and looked at the card again.
Draco was planted where he stood. He didn’t know what was going on. Why would Harry bring him here? Why did he keep this such a surprise? Was Harry trying to find the easiest way to get rid of him? Was this his way of getting someone else to tell him that he needs to leave the Potter household alone? The thoughts in Draco’s head kept swimming and spinning to the point of no return and Draco had gotten lost in them. He didn’t realize that he had zoned out of any and all conversation until he felt a nudge against his ribs. He spun his head around to find the source of the pain and saw Harry looking at him with concern.
“Uncle Draco!” Teddy yelled and ran directly towards Draco and jumped directly into his arms. He grabbed Draco’s face and squeezed it playfully and laughed maniacally.
“She knew what kind of place I’ve been in.” Draco sighed softly. He looked up at Harry, who carried an intense, questioning look on his face that urged Draco to go on. “I’ve been…” He took a deep inhale and looked down at his hands, unable to say the words out loud, he’d never spoken them before. He jumped slightly when he felt Harry’s hand on top of his own. Draco looked at the deep olive that contrasted against his own pale white. He noticed small freckles along Harry’s knuckles. There was a small squeeze around his hand and he looked up at Harry.
The kitchen was quiet again and somewhat peaceful when Draco suddenly felt something crack against his head and then followed by a cold, wet sensation running down his neck. His eyes widened in surprise when he saw an egg land on top of Teddy’s head soon after. They both looked up and noticed Harry had the carton of eggs in his hands, a playful smile formed across his face. Draco looked at Teddy and the boy simply nodded. They grabbed the nearest ingredient and automatically threw it at Harry, who was now covered in the cocoa that they must have grabbed. The three of them stood in the kitchen looking at each other, not saying a word. Suddenly, Teddy yelled what seemed like a war cry and the kitchen erupted into a battlefield of cake ingredients. Food was being thrown from multiple directions and covering all three of them and most of the kitchen.
“Was walking by, thought it looked nice and warm, figured I’d stop in for a drink on my way home.” Harry smiled slightly, letting his worry fade as he continued to talk to the gentleman. They had talked for what seemed like half an hour when he felt someone sit down next to him. Noticing that the person was just there to get a drink as well, Harry continued with his conversation with Eric and didn’t think twice about Lucky’s newest patron.
Draco smiled at his feet, a feeling of care swelling in his chest that Harry would keep something between them, just between them and not tell even his two best friends about. “Sorry, I don’t mean to assume that he would just go about and tell my business to the two of you, I just know that you’re his best friends and honestly, the only friends I’ve ever had, didn’t really care about personal boundaries or conversations and would just tell them anyway.” He sighed, feeling horrible that he would assume such things about someone that has been so kind to him.
When they arrived at their location, Draco could see the room in front of him, but couldn’t figure out why it looked so familiar. Had he been here before? He couldn’t remember, but his thoughts were suddenly interrupted by a voice that called out from across the room.
his father after all. Draco downed his glass and stomped off to bed. Angry about how going over to Potter’s house and sitting in silence and drinking his whiskey calmed his mind. Angry about all the children being affected with sickness. Angry that he hadn’t seen his son in weeks no matter how much he asked Astoria. He was just, angry.
“Well, I guess the first time we played quidditch against each other.” Draco thought back to second year, he smiled at the competitiveness between the two and never noticed how free he felt during those moments.
Teddy finally climbed down from Malfoy’s lap and turned to look at Harry. He hugged the wolf tightly and looked at Harry intently and said, “When’s dinner?”
“Malfoy, wait.” Harry hesitated as Malfoy stopped suddenly at his words. He knew he was going to regret this decision. He knew this could end up extremely bad, but, as Andromeda had said, he’s always been one to take a broken wing under his own. “Why don’t you come in and have a seat.”
“Yes, yes. And of course, you had to help them.” She sighed, waving him off and shaking her head. “I can’t fault you for that Harry. You’ve always been one to take a broken wing under your own.” She turned and smiled at him as she packed up Teddys toys in his day bag.
“Fine.” Draco hugged but didn’t argue. “Well, it seems a bit late, I might as well be going then. Work in the morning.” Draco stood, Harry standing beside him.
“‘Mione, I’m fine. I promise!” He walked around her and her continuous worried gaze and sat on the edge of his desk, not wanting to make Ron get up and possibly make a mess with all of the food he currently had on Harry’s desk.
“He warmed your heart, didn’t he Teddy?” Draco finally spoke, realizing what he was feeling when he held the wolf close. He watched as Teddy spun around and looked at him with bright eyes.
Teddy finally spoke when Draco was face to face with him. “You’re the boy from the pictures Aunt Cissy brought over, aren’t you?” Teddy leaned his head to the side, as if he was analyzing Draco.
Draco hugged him back and whispered, “Of course.” He smiled brightly again and looked back over at Potter who was watching the scene in front of him play out as if it was a play that was extremely bizarre.
“You are Saint Potter.” Harry could have sworn he saw a small twitch at the corners of the man’s mouth as he said this.
Teddy turned to face Harry and then looked back at Draco, squinting his eyes at the man. Draco felt uncomfortable at this but held his composure.
“Well then why don’t you call each other by your first names now? It just seems weird hearing you call each other by your last names.” Teddy shrugged and stuffed a fork full of food into his mouth.
Harry stopped just outside of the door, looked to his left, and realized that he was wrong. Draco Malfoy was leaned against the brick outside of the bar, taking a long drag on a cigarette, and, if Harry had to admit it to himself, looked a lot worse for wear than he thought Draco Malfoy ever would let himself look.
“Yes. Like my other daddy.” He said matter-of-factly. He turned away from the two of them and headed to his room.
Draco slowly made his way up the steps to the guest bathroom. He set the clothes down on the counter by the sink and looked around the bathroom. He felt out of place in the small room, decorated with reds and golds. He smirked at the color placement and shook his head at the obvious Gryffindor decorating. Draco sighed, got undressed, and stepped into the shower. He could feel the muscles in his shoulders relax instantly, he leaned against the cool tile in the shower as the water ran over his back. He stood there for a moment, enjoying the heat, and then he looked around for any shampoo or soap. He spotted the small bottle off in the corner labeled, “shampoo” and applied it to his hair. The scent engulfed him quickly. The scent was strong of vanilla with hints of lavender. Draco melted into the scent as it filled the small space of the shower. There was something familiar and comforting to it that he couldn’t place. He took in the scent again until he finished washing up. He stepped out of the shower and dried off. He put on the clothes that Harry had given him. He took a look at himself in the mirror. The t-shirt hung on him slightly and the pants were just a bit baggy, but then again, Harry was always slightly bigger than him, and he guessed he’d lost some weight lately. He looked down at the clothes and noticed that there were tiny little snitches emblazoned against the maroon color of the pants, and the shirt seemed to have an old muggle band on it that Draco didn’t recognize. He shook his head at his appearance and headed out of the bathroom. He walked downstairs and fell into the armchair in the sitting room.
“Okay!” Teddy took one last jump and bounced off the bed. He took off out of the room and down the hall to his own, Harry following behind him.
Teddy turned to Harry slowly, the biggest smile Draco thought he had ever seen spread across the child’s face. “Cake!”
Harry’s stomach released the knots that it was currently in and sat down slowly and gave Andromeda an encouraging look to let her know to keep going.
“The offer still open or is it a one-time thing?” Malfoy said, glancing over his shoulder at Harry. Harry just nodded and Malfoy walked into the fire as it roared a bright emerald green and was gone.
And did Potter just open up somewhat to him as well? He had rambled on a bit about the fact that he had never really told anyone how he had felt, and that no one had ever listened to him. But didn’t he have the weasel and the mudblood for that? Surely, they would listen to whatever the leader of their beloved Golden Trio had to say and of course they would have compassion for him and make sure he felt better about himself more than he probably already did. Savior of the wizarding world and all that shit.
“You mean when you insulted Ron on the train to school?” Harry could hear the defensiveness in his voice but the memory of his first official meeting with Draco hit him in the chest with an unknown anger that he hadn’t felt in years.
Harry looked at what Draco pointed to and smiled. “It’s a snake.” He pulled his sleeve up again and Draco looked closer. The detail in the snake was mesmerizing. He noticed the intricate shading, the clean line detail, the piercing of the eyes.
“Please, Draco,” He remembered Astoria saying quietly one night after he had just come back inside from one of his nightly breaks, “Stop this nonsense. I would like you to still be alive and healthy enough to watch Pius grow up. It’s horrible for your health, smoking those things.”
“Harry,” Hermione started before anyone else could say anything. “How have you been? We feel like we haven’t seen you in ages.” She placed a hand on her hip and looked at Harry with a worried expression.
“I’m fine Malfoy. Don’t worry about it. It happens from time to time. ‘S long as Ted’s not here.” Harry’s head snapped up at the realization of what he had said.
Andromeda nodded and followed Harry to the kitchen as he put the kettle on. “Harry, I need to talk to you about Teddy.” She said softly and looked at Harry with cautious eyes.
“It means that, despite the fact that you and the other two of the Golden Trio always seemed to save the school at the end of the year, you always had a habit of turning it upside down for at least half of the year.” Draco started laughing at this point. “I mean, do you even
Draco stared at the fireplace in silence for a moment before hearing a noise from behind him. He turned and saw Harry walking down the hall, Teddy following behind him eagerly, trying to look around Harry, trying to make sure Draco stayed true to his word. They both entered the sitting room and Teddy made a bee line for Draco. The boy jumped and landed perfectly in Draco’s lap. Draco laughed and looked down at the child. Teddy was still holding Moony closely but had something else in his other hand.
“To be honest, something had really hit me today and my instant reaction was to try and see if you’d be here. I just got lucky to be honest.”
always trying to help and fix anything he can.” Draco sneered. He didn’t need help, and he sure as hell didn’t need any help from Harry Fucking Potter. “Why don’t you go find another pathetic soul to save. It is the only thing you’re good at.”
Harry thought about this and finally nodded, realizing that Hermione was right, if this kept happening, he should talk to McGonagall. Maybe she could figure out what was going on. Hermione gave a curt nod and headed off after looking at Harry once more. Harry finally went into his office and finished his work for the day. After picking up Teddy and going through the nighttime routine and putting Teddy to bed he sat back on the couch, bottles of whiskey and scotch on the table, accompanied by two tumblers, which Harry had already poured his scotch into his own and laid his head back.
Harry, Teddy and Draco arrived on the Weasley’s floo 30 minutes after Eroll had delivered the invitation to dinner. Teddy was the first to step out of the floo and took off running into the kitchen of the Weasley home.
Harry hung his head and laughed under his breath and turned to Draco, who obviously looked confused. “We eat cake when we’re sad in this house.”
Draco had finally calmed down from laughing and was still looking at Harry. “I had no idea you almost
Draco nodded, “I need to run back to my flat, I seem to have gotten food all over my shirt… again.” He smiled and winked at Teddy, who laughed and ran upstairs into his room. “I’ll be back shortly.”
“Alright.” Ron slapped his knees and pushed himself up out of the chair. “You gonna come by the pub tonight this time?”
Thank you to everyone who has kept up with the story so far. I have so many ideas going on for this story and with school and my small-business, I haven't had time to update. Hopefully there will be new chapters at least once a week, if not more. :)
McGonagall paused for a moment to take in Harry’s question for a moment, then she finally looked at him and said, “Why yes, I believe he is Potter. But the thing is, I don’t think he himself knows that he is asking for help. We both know how Mr. Malfoy is Potter and we both know he is not one to ask for help, no matter how bad things may get for him.”
“Well, when I was eleven, before I even know that I was a wizard, I set a python on my cousin at the zoo.” Harry chuckled at the memory. “There’s that, and the fact that I was almost sorted into Slytherin, so there’s that.”
“Teddy… Lupin?” He had remembered his mother telling him that her sister, Andromeda, had a grandchild at the beginning of the war, his cousin, Nymphadora Tonks had married and had a child with his old professor, Remus Lupin. “He’s, my cousin, right?” Draco’s voice was small now, a lump in his throat had formed from looking at the picture of Harry with Teddy, making him think of his own child, Scorpius.
“Whatcha got there Teddy?” Draco asked, nodding to Teddy’s hidden hand. Teddy looked down at it and then up at Harry, who finally sat down on the couch beside them. Harry simply nodded and Teddy turned back to Draco, a small smile on his little face. He held up a book that Draco recognized from one that he had bought and read for Scorpius a multitude of times. “Babbity Rabbity?” Draco smiled at the title. Teddy simply nodded and looked at him hopefully. “That just so happens to be one of my favorite stories. Would you like me to read it to you?”
“I understand. War is a complicated beast on its own. It wasn’t fair for you poor children to be forced to grow up before you could truly understand what was being asked of you.” She reached out to pat Harry’s hand gently.
“Boys!” McGonagall’s voice cut through to both of them, her disappointment at their display quite evident. “You’ll take your assignment and you’ll go back to your dormitory. At once.”
Once they established a baseline and determined—during the second month—that he’d be perfectly fine with a bit of Wolfsbane, Harry went back to his regular activities. He’d had plenty of visitors in that time, but none of them could really lift the dark cloud that surrounded Harry once more. Many of them knew not to press the issue too hard, as they’d all learned the hard way over the years what could happen when Harry snapped.
Rather than focusing on a lot of in-class study and theory, the premise was to have the large group focus on year-long projects instead, with a nominal amount of class time focused more on being teaching aids. The time was meant to help prepare them to find jobs in their respective fields, and many of them had yet to decide what that was, or had decided but after the war had changed their minds.
“I do need to do this though, Hermione. I need answers, otherwise I’ll never be able to move forward.”
Bill explained that nothing compared to Fleur’s scent on a regular day, but on the week leading up to a full moon? Forget it. His inner wolf was typically mild-mannered, and calm, but he claimed that during that one week, her scent was stronger than any lust potion. He’d place money on it.
Following a spontaneous Quidditch game hosted by the Eighth years—in which Draco and Harry were not even remotely allowed to search for the Snitch, and instead were forced to be Keepers nowhere near each other for the entire game—they hit the locker rooms to shower. Harry’s team had won by a landslide. But it had been less thrilling of a win when he’d barely been able to face off against Draco.
“What about family?” Death continued on, bringing forward two people Harry had expected to see from the start.
… Just ahead, at the lake. Harry was going to thrash someone, whoever it was, just for standing too close to
Voices mingled together in concordance, and then broke apart into groups as soon as the Headmistress left. It didn’t surprise Harry in the least of course, given that people had a tendency to stick with what they knew. And these people had spent years mingling with their own houses which meant sticking with the people they knew and trusted. But most of Gryffindor house hadn’t returned, with the exception of Hermione, and Dean Thomas. Neville was coming back in the next year to shadow Professor Sprout—who was set to be retiring in the near future.
The physical damage was only second to the mental damage Harry had to deal with. The doctors were in and out of his room, as were his superiors from the Auror department, who gave him honourable commendations as well as discreet discharge orders. Which was really only the polite way of saying “you fucked up, and you’re fired”.
A hand touched his shoulder, startling him into looking up. Through the hazy cloud unshed tears, he could see Hermione—her expression said it all.
“I don’t want your pity. If that’s how you’re going to react, you can forget going for a cuppa.” Draco snarked. Harry couldn’t help the smile creeping up on his face. So, the real Draco was still there under all those layers of exhaustion?
He then pulled Harry into a kiss, melting everything else away. Harry knew they weren’t out of the frying pan yet, as Draco’s reappearance from the dead would require explanations Harry wasn’t sure he was ready to share, but that was a problem for tomorrow. For today, he allowed himself to indulge in his second chance at a love he’d almost lost.
“Look at you, Potter. On your knees for me, like a good boy.” Draco’s voice was edged with pleasure. Despite the fact that his wolf was typically dominant, Harry felt his cock twitch at those words. Between the praise, and the mild humiliation, he was a mess of pre-come and moans.
But before he could even think to ask, Draco was already standing and righting his robes. Less than a second later, the Slytherin turned on his heel and left.
It was weeks after that first cup of tea. They had sat beneath a tree watching a rainstorm as it came across the Malfoy grounds. It was terrifying and shaky and a little bit terrible. But it was the first time either of them had kissed a man, so that came with a learning curve. Harry would never forget the feel of Draco’s stubble scratching against his own. Or the feel of petal soft lips pressing firmly into his—as if even kissing had become a competition between the two of them.
As he lay shivering in the hospital bed a few days later, Harry had a newfound sense of appreciation for Remus, Bill, and the others.
They were due for a Floo call this weekend, but Harry hesitated following through since he wasn’t sure he could hide the information from his best mate.
“Don’t make assumptions on my behalf, Potter. Shut the fuck up and kiss me already, you fucking-Mmmff!”
With narrowed eyes, Harry picked up the trail, following it slowly and radiating aggression to anyone who dared look his way. Of course, they weren’t even remotely tied to each other, but that was a
Pale, lengthy fingers slipped lower until they wrapped around the thick cock. The initial few strokes were slow, as if testing the water, or perhaps just Harry’s reaction. Maybe Draco felt the same way Harry did, as if this wasn’t real, just a dream.
In the days following his visit to St Mungo’s, Harry had locked himself away in Grimmauld place. The blinds were drawn across every window with the exception of the little library. As if the weather was emulating his feelings, the skies poured down in sadness for days on end. Harry sat in his plush armchair—having turned it to face the window—wrapped in a blanket, and stayed unless his body physically required him to move.
“No! Wait don’t touch—” Hermione shrieked, but it was too late. Unable to resist a peek, Harry opened his eyes and watched as shudders ran through Hermione. Her eyes were also starting to open, but at that point it didn’t matter. Pansy was utterly still, but with eyes opened brilliantly wide as Hermione shoved Pansy against a wall and kissed her with a thoroughness that left even Harry breathless.
“No! Wait! Come back you as-Oh Hi erm…” Harry spluttered, completely flustered between Ron’s departure and Draco’s arrival.
The sound of footsteps marching back down the hall was both a relief and agonising. On the one hand, Harry could pull away from the wall now, and walk right out the doors of Hogwarts until he’d managed to reach the Quidditch pitch. On the other hand, having Draco’s scent so close made him almost snap, but having it further away was even worse. It took every ounce of restraint he had to keep from running after the Slytherin.
It was only then that Harry realised he was sweating. Draco’s expression was burned in his mind. By purposely wearing the jersey, Harry could only assume Draco was trying to suss out the person who soiled it; but what did he think now that he
And then, in a last ditch attempt to get Draco to walk away—because Harry knew he didn’t have the strength in him to leave—Harry communed with his wolf, finding the strength of the beast empowering him, and wrapping around him like a blanketed aura of dominance. “If you don’t leave now, I’m going to do something both of us will regret later.”
picture some unknown person bent forward in front of him, chest pressed into the mattress, arse up and willing, as Harry pressed into him.
“Mrrghh, Malfoy, stop,” Harry groaned, unabashedly grinding against the wall now. “I really need you to stop and not get any closer.”
“What do you need, Harry? How can I help you?” Hermione held him close, but continued to walk him away from the cluster.
Death silenced him with another wave of his hand, and a second shadow emerged from the depths of his room.
“Aren’t you going to see who you’re paired with, Harry?” Hermione inquired, leaning over the shoulder of his armchair, as he read the scores for the recent Holyhead Harpies game.
“I understand how you feel Harry, and I know how it feels to need the sweet relief of dissociating. But doing so comes at the cost of pushing everyone away, especially when they need it most.”
Among the worst ones was Fenrir Greyback, who continued to attack any Muggle-born students he could find, slaughtering their families and forcing them to become dependent on him. At the time, they had no idea that Greyback had slowly been building an army, wolves as bloodthirsty and insane as he was. Harry had been in a squadron at the front lines, throwing himself into every battle, as if nothing else mattered but the fight.
“I just worry about you, Harry. We all do. You’ve already done so much for the wizarding world… For the whole world.” Ron continued, his voice softening as he brought his wand up to aid Harry.
For Harry, especially, watching the bonds develop between classmates was awesome. Watching his own friends turn into guiding mentors, engaging in study sessions to help the struggling students with their workload. What had surprised Harry the most, was the growing bond between Hermione and Pansy.
Not fighting side by side in a race for the Snitch was the only reason Harry could think of—until later, when alone, staring at the canopy of his four-poster restlessly—for not realising his problem sooner. Draco, in his frustration at having lost to Harry
“D-Draco?” He asked hesitantly, voice wavering with emotion. If he kept talking, maybe it wouldn’t be true. “Babe? You’re alright, it’s okay. You’re just sleeping, right? You’ve been working so hard lately… I kept telling you to take a break but you won't.” Harry could hear murmuring behind him, no doubt already throwing their pity his way. But just as Draco hadn’t wanted his, he sure as fuck didn’t want theirs.
By the time they got through the line and had a chance to see the sign up sheet, only one project remained.
Harry considered ignoring the call for a brief moment, but knowing Molly, she’d come right through all the same and give him a right talking to—no different than she would have given her own children. He truly loved her for that. Despite having many of her own children, she always made Harry feel as if he were just as much a part of her hoard as Ron.
’. Not that he was bothered by the need driving his entire system forward. Not when each inhale of the jersey made his cock harder, or his blood rush through him faster. Settling into a rather strange rhythm, Harry alternated languid hip thrusts right up against the side of the mattress, with inhales of the jersey. It was probably a horrible idea—one he’d likely either feel sick over or at least mentally chastise himself over later—but Harry let his mind wander, imagining burrowing himself deep inside his former nemesis.
Not that he thought he’d ever truly get over the loss of the love of his life. He wished then and there, that he’d taken a moment to say the three words that had weighed on him from the moment they first kissed.
Harry hadn’t made it past the feel of stretching Draco past the widest point of his knot. The moment Draco’s rim completely engulfed him, Harry was shooting hard within the blond’s depths. It was a feeling he could never have explained beyond a bone deep, soul deep, satiation.
There were as many projects as there were pairs. And based on the fact that Hermione was paired with Hannah Abbott from Hufflepuff, they would have selected something that Hermione had chosen for them. He hoped his best friend would learn to compromise, because it wouldn’t be fair to Hannah—who’d also returned for continuing education—who might want to do something that could help her own future as well.
“I know I can’t.” Harry grumbled, but felt a hand on his. Draco brought their hands to his lips and kissed each knuckle gently.
Harry didn’t have to wait long. It was only a few minutes before the stomping sounds of shoes—angrily making their way towards him—could be heard.
Needing no further incentive than that, Harry took off with Hermione lagging behind him—out of breath from her initial marathon finding him—she directed him to the Great Hall, where it seemed a small crowd had already gathered. Footsteps faltering, Harry slowed enough to reach the back of the crowd. His heart pounded in his chest, the fear of what he would find ramping up his anxiety. Sweat trickled down his spine, breath coming in short bursts, as the crowd cleared and he stepped forward.
Harry hadn’t understood why she’d argued so vehemently for his own return, until he’d arrived and seen how both former and new Slytherin students were being treated. From the first of September, Harry had supported them and made it clear that despite his past grievances with some of the students from that house, he bore them no ill will. He didn’t go so far as to tell them what Malfoy had done for him, or Narcissa for that matter, but Harry single-handedly ensured that no Slytherin student would be harassed for things beyond their control.
Harry had to get out. If he stayed, it was very possible Draco would get a lot more of Harry’s attention than he bargained for.
Of course, it had absolutely been a trap, and the only thing Harry could recall—before waking up in a secure ward at St Mungo’s—was teeth and claws slashing into his thigh.
“Harry…” Sirius’ voice called out to him, and for a second, Harry considered running right into his arms.
“What? Don’t you want to come back?” Harry inquired, feeling overwhelmed beyond belief. Everything was starting to feel fuzzy, from lack of air and information overload. Was any of this even real? The edges of his vision were starting to fade.
Malfoy was a rather decent seeker in his own right—not that Harry would ever say as much to his face—and would make great observations on the skills shown by the students.
The sounds of hooves pounding in the dirt drowned out any thoughts Harry had about their task. He knew next to nothing about horses, let alone magical ones. And somehow, they had found themselves responsible for a whole herd of them.
Of course, that went both ways. He’d made it clear to the Slytherins as well, that any untowards behaviour would not be tolerated simply because he was offering a figurative olive branch.
Harry moaned. He took the stairs two at a time, until he was safely behind closed doors once more. The castle had provided quiet, single rooms for the returning Eighth years, so at the least Harry knew he had some privacy as he ripped off all his clothes, and stomped his overheated body into a cold shower.
Closing his eyes, Harry took in the words with pure satisfaction. If his wolf could purr, it would have. Moving quickly forward, Harry reached out and snagged the front of Draco’s shirt, tugging it forward and sealing their lips together in a kiss that spoke of firecrackers and dynamite.
With shaking hands, Draco did as he was commanded, first unbuckling his belt, and then undoing the fastenings of his trousers. As the fabric parted, Draco’s cock bounced free, as if eagerly demanding attention as much as the blond did. It would have been funny, had Harry’s mind not been filled with thoughts of how good the reddened flesh would feel in his mouth.
Even Hagrid had a smaller project (or so he claimed) that had to do with mucking out stalls and other rather dirty work. Not that Harry was opposed to it, but the one that caught his eye the most would pair him with Madam Hooch. There were a few league teams looking to add to their ranks, and it was up to them to determine if any were good enough to play professionally. Harry felt he had a good eye for talent, having added some rather spectacular players to Griffindor’s team in the past.
’ with Professor Slughorn—which seemed to focus on both potions and working with Healers at St Mungo’s—to ‘
Fashioning a makeshift sheath out of Draco’s jersey, Harry fucked into it with a renewed sense of urgency. He was going to come any second, all because he could smell Draco right there. Despite the rough texture of the jersey, Harry didn’t slow his pace, not even when—seconds later—he shot out his climax into the fabric. Instead of moaning, he came on a roar, his throbbing cock soaking the jersey with shot after shot.
The room appeared to grow smaller with the depths of shadows seemingly closing in on him. Harry struggled to breathe properly, and wondered if Death was attempting to intimidate him.
“I’m just not feeling too great. Need some fresh air,” he murmured. The wavering in his voice must have been enough of a sign for Hermione, who let go and nodded, eyes filled with concern. He knew she was worried about him, which he appreciated, but he was barely holding it together as it was. Unfortunately, Harry still had to pass Draco—even with a table between them—in order to get out. As they moved, Harry’s eyes flicked up, catching icy blue hues starting blatantly back. Fuck. He knew. Draco knew what Harry had done.
“That’s not fair Teddy, you know that I can’t say no to you when you give me your sad eyes.” Draco sighed and ran his hand through Teddy’s hair. “I guess I can’t be rude and turn down her invitation. But you promise me Harry that there is no ulterior motive towards me coming with you?”
“I’m sorry.” Harry whispered, his voice catching in his throat. He didn’t know how much he had wanted to say that to Draco until now. He had always regretted that decision and now it was thrown into his face. “I’m so sorry Malfoy. I was scared, we all were.”
They all laughed as Ron just shrugged, putting another pie into his mouth, heading towards the kitchen, where they joined the rest of the Weasley family, which Draco couldn’t figure out how all of them were in the home and he was just now seeing them since he had gotten there.
Teddy jumped up instantly and wrapped his arms around the man's legs and Draco stood slowly to face him, they were almost the same height, the red-head just an inch or so taller.
“What?” Harry couldn’t understand what was going on in his best friend's heads, but he sensed it wasn’t good.
Harry’s breath hitched as he noticed the bright platinum blonde hair of the man walking towards the door.
“Harry dear.” She sounded exhausted as Harry welcomed her into his home. “I’m sorry for barging in on your home unexpected.”
“I’ve just been spending more time with Teddy, that’s all.” He had started to go though the new case files that had appeared on his desk that morning before he had gotten in.
“Well,” Harry sighed, “I guess I can’t argue with that logic, mainly because I know Teddy probably would have decided to make breakfast even if you had said no. So I guess I can’t complain that he had some supervision so he wouldn’t hurt himself.”
“I’m not sure bud, I think that’s something he’s going to have to decide seeing as he bought it.” Harry smiled at Teddy and looked at Malfoy, who was still smiling, something that made Harry’s chest swell with something like pride, but he couldn’t exactly place what it was.
“Shut it.” Harry smiled. “But yes, she was rather annoying when you didn’t understand her reasoning behind it. But back to the story, Ron had made fun of her earlier that day, granted he had no idea that she was right behind us when he said it, but she had heard him and that’s how she ended up in the girls’ lavatory, and how, in the end, so did we.”
“The wolf, Harry, I’m not sure what kind of magic it is, I surely didn’t know that it did this when I bought it, but when the person holding him is sad, he gets warms, and, well, he warms your heart.” Draco looked at Harry in disbelief, but he was the one holding the wolf and experiencing it for himself.
Teddy sighed and walked slowly towards Harry, dragging his feet along the way. When he reached him, he turned and looked back at Draco again. “Will you still be here when I’m done?” The look in the small child’s eyes was hopeful and pleading.
When Draco entered the sitting room, he looked up and noticed that no one was in there. He was worried that he had come by at a bad time or that Potter wasn’t even home, or worse, he wasn’t actually invited and had made the whole thing up in his head. He went to turn and leave when he heard a clatter from the room off to the right of him. He looked up and noticed Potter in the kitchen, he seemed deep in thought as he was cooking something and Draco didn’t want to disturb him, he would just come back another time. He went to turn back to the fireplace again when he heard Potter speaking from the kitchen.
When Draco and Teddy finished cooking, they all sat around the table and ate everything, leaving nothing left over. Harry looked over at the clock on the wall when he had finished putting away the dishes as Draco was playing with Teddy, and noticed that it was already 9 O’clock.
Harry shrugged and finally stood up, claiming defeat. “Thank you, McGonagall.” She stood with him and pulled him into a small hug to his surprise. He hugged her back, not realizing how much she had always meant to him as a parental figure until that moment.
“Well, I invited him to come back over this weekend.” He ruffled Teddy’s hair and slid out of bed, making Teddy’s head bounce off of the mattress.
“Who’s bothering me while I’m sleeping? I know it’s not time for another sorting, so what do you want?” The hat groaned. When it finally opened it’s eye flaps and noticed Harry and Draco standing in front of it, it’s tone suddenly changed. “Harry Potter! And Draco Malfoy! What brings the two of you to come visit me?”
“Yes, Malfoy. I read. Why does that surprise you?” He put the book down on the table and got up to gather the dishes to return them to the kitchen.
“I talked to your Grandma yesterday and we agreed that it would be nice for you to spend some more time with your Uncle Draco and you can stay home this weekend so you can see him. You’ll go to Grandma’s next week, if that’s okay with you that is.”
and heading to greet him in the sitting room. Draco noticed that the man was wearing a simple long sleeve t-shirt and jeans,
He jumped up out of the chair, rushed to the window and let the owl inside. He pulled the rolled-up parchment from its leg and watched it turn and fly away. He opened the parchment and his heart sank at the words.
Draco sat back down in the armchair in the center of his living room. He raised his wand and a bottle of whiskey and a tumbler gracefully landed beside him on the small table. He poured himself another glass, even though he had drunk nearly half of the bottle that Potter had left beside him, leaned back in the chair, and closed his eyes as he took a sip of the amber liquid. His mind played the evening over again. Potter looked surprised to see him there.
“Monday after work, I had Draco come over and meet Teddy, mainly because I let slip on Sunday about Ted.” Harry shrugged.
Draco crossed his arms and huffed, but turned and looked at Harry with a smirk on his face. He turned back to face the sorting hat, “So how did he end up in Gryffindor if he was supposed to be in Slytherin?”
Harry looked down at his godson and smiled, “So I’m guessing you wanted to make me breakfast again but you didn’t want to wake me up?” Teddy glanced up at Harry with big sky blue eyes and nodded. “And since last time I told you that you weren’t allowed to cook by yourself you reached out to Draco?” The boy nodded again. “But how did you know how to reach him?” Harry picked up Teddy and held him in his arms as the boy’s hair slowly started to change back to it’s previous color, which was his common blue-green.
As the memory of Scorpius’ birth ended, Draco suddenly felt sad again. He hadn’t seen his son in almost 2 weeks, and it killed him. The only person on this earth that loved him more than his own mother did, and he had been kept away. He was only 4 years old and Draco feared this separation from him would be traumatizing to the child. He didn’t want to do anything to hurt Scorpius and prayed that Astoria was making sure that he knew how much Draco loved him. And then Draco’s thoughts traveled to his day of work, and all the children in the outbreak of dragon pox and his heart dropped. He didn’t know if Scorpius was okay, if he had caught the infection. But he assumed if something like that had happened that Astoria would at least let him know. He
Draco looked down at the violet eyes looking back at him and smiled brightly. He looked up at Harry who was watching them with the same look of pride in his eyes that he had when he was watching Teddy get the cake ingredients together. His bright emerald green eyes met Draco’s stone grey one’s and that’s when it hit Draco. That warm feeling in his chest that he had experienced when he was holding Teddy’s stuffed wolf, was happening again. Draco couldn’t understand why he felt it, but it made him slightly uneasy, so he tore his eyes away from Harry’s and looked back down at Teddy, who was still holding on to him.
“Teddy? Draco? What are you -?” His eyes caught the sight of their hands, both covered in flour, and his smiling face suddenly turned to shock. “NO! Teddy, whatever he’s convinced you to do, do NOT do it!” Harry started backing away slowly, but ended up against the wall with nowhere to run. Teddy turned to look at Draco, who replied with a smile that Teddy reciprocated. He turned back to Harry and grinned wide. The next thing Harry knew, he was covered in flour from head to toe, and Draco and Teddy were high fiving, laughing wildly.
“Daddy!” Teddy jumped from the chair that he had been standing on and rushed over to Harry, squeezing him around the legs.
“Do you call Uncle Ron and Aunt ‘Mione by their last names like you used to with Daddy ‘cause of school too?”
“I think he needs to get to know his cousin. Even if I never fully did.” Harry smiled at him and held out his hand. Draco took it cautiously, still always worried this whole thing was a trick. “And who knows, maybe we can talk more about how obnoxiously big prats we were back then.” Harry smiled at Draco and he could tell that it was a genuine one.
Finally, Malfoy spoke, quietly, and looking at his hands, which were thin and looked as though he was starved. “You’d even be willing,” he hesitated for a moment before continuing, “be willing to help me?” He looked up at Harry, there was a pleading look in his eyes that Harry had only seen once before, up in the Astronomy tower the night Dumbledore died. Harry winced at the memory but kept a straight face as the man continued to look at him.
“How did you -?” Harry looked at her with complete surprise. He knew nothing ever got past McGonagall, but how could she have figured this out so quickly?
When Draco entered the waiting room, Narcissa looked up at him, her eyes going seemingly wider than Draco thought they could go. “Is anything –,” She tried to choke out.
They all started on their respective parts of the cake, Draco measuring and mixing the dry ingredients while Harry and Teddy worked on the wet. Things were going smoothly until Draco went to measure out the flour, which he hadn’t known would come out of the bag that it was in so forcefully. The first clump of flour came out quickly and puffed back up into his face instantly. He coughed, as he tried to get the bit that had gotten into his throat, out. Harry and Teddy had turned to see what had happened and were presented with a white faced, flour covered Draco. His faced turned sour as they both erupted into a loud laughter. He was ready to storm out when Teddy had piped up.
“Morning Harry.” Draco said as he leaned against the counter, wiping food off of his hands. Harry looked him over and a pang hit his stomach again like it did the other night with Teddy. Harry shook the feeling from his mind and focused his attention back to Draco. “You alright Harry?” Draco looked Harry over, noticing the strange look on the man's face.
“Finally, I’m starving.” Ron said, stretching, picking up the plate of pies and helping Hermione off of the couch.
“Of course that’s okay Daddy! I can’t wait to see Uncle Draco!” Teddy stood up on the bed and started jumping again.
He made his way up to the bar, slid into the only open stool against it, he was only stopping to warm up and didn’t want to take up a table that could have been put to better use by someone else. Looking up to see where the bartender was, he spotted the gentleman next to him out of the corner of his eye. He had long dark, almost black hair pulled up into a bun, only being secured by a chopstick of some sort. The man was laughing loudly with the person next to him, neither of them noticing the sudden occupancy of the seat he had taken. Draco looked a little more closely at the gentleman, he had nothing better to do while waiting for the bartender to eventually come down his way.
Draco shook his head and brought his thoughts back into focus. “Yeah, just wandered off again is all.” He tried to give Harry another small smile and turned to Teddy. “Alright Teddy, what do you need me to do?” Teddy smiled as he turned to Draco and handed him a large bowl with many utensils and ingredients inside it. Draco looked down at it curiously and then back up to Teddy.
He had just started on his second glass when his fire had suddenly turned green. Harry jumped and looked intensely at the fire, waiting for Ron or Hermione to come through. He was shocked when he heard a whispered voice coming through.
“That settles that then.” Draco smiled. “Now, Teddy, if I’m not mistaken, we still have some eggs to make, that is, if your dad doesn’t mind us continuing to cook.” Draco looked up at Harry, who was still holding Teddy. Harry nodded and put Teddy down so they could finish cooking.
Harry had finally looked at his surroundings after walking for what seemed like an hour when he saw a little hole in the wall Muggle pub across the street. It looked warm and inviting and the thought of being able to have a drink or two without being stared at sounded like heaven at just that moment. He walked across the street and entered the pub, no one looked up, no one jumped at the sight of him, no one bombarded him, and he smiled.
“Draco, the baby’s coming!” Astoria shouted from the bedroom. Draco raced up the stairs to her as fast as he could, he held her hand, his mind racing as to what was supposed to happen next. Draco had never felt this feeling of uneasy before, and he wasn’t keen on it. Finally, he remembered he needed to take Astoria to St. Mungo’s. He called her bags to the room and held on to his wife tightly. They landed right in front of St. Mungo’s Hospital and quickly rushed to the front desk. The witch that sat behind the desk and looked up, her eyes opened wide at the sight in front of her. The witch hurried them to the labor ward and called a healer as soon as she could.
“Teddy,” Harry said softly to Teddy, noticing the curious look on the boy’s face. “This is your cousin, Mal-, ahem, Draco Malfoy.”
Draco landed in the fireplace of his flat and looked around the dark and quiet living room. He walked slowly to the armchair he had in the center of the room and slumped into it, watching the now red fire blaze in front of him. He sat and thought of what had just transpired and couldn’t make much sense of it. Potter had just let him into his home without question, granted some hesitation, but still, he did not turn him away. Potter was even quiet through the whole thing, save for offering for a drink and a refill, but he stayed quiet, didn’t ask any questions or badger him about why he was there, in his sitting room, drinking his alcohol.
Harry continued with the rest of his normal work day and continued to answer Ron and Hermione’s constant questions about his new found friendship with Draco. As much as it frustrated him to answer a million questions about Draco and Teddy, he knew that the more questions he answered, the less hesitant they would be if he decided to have all of them in the same room… someday.
“Oh this?” Draco said playfully, pulling the toy he got just before he arrived from behind his back. He had made sure to wrap it before he got to Potter’s house. “Oh, it’s nothing. Just something I got earlier just in case I ran into a kid today.” He smiled at he boy and looked up at Potter who had an eyebrow raised and a smirk playing on his face.
Harry was about to say something to let her know he was there when he heard her say, without lifting her head from her parchment, “Well, come sit down Potter.” Harry smiled and remembered it was McGonagall, there wasn’t a thing she missed. He walked across the room and sat down in one of the chairs opposite her.
Harry laughed and nudged Draco in the ribs again. “Can you please inform Draco here, that when I was eleven and you were to sort me, that you originally wanted to place me in Slytherin but I asked you not to?” He was looking at Draco the entire time he spoke to the hat, a cocky grin now playing across his face.
Draco could never forget that day, because he had respected Granger after that moment. He smiled at the memory and realized the look on Harry’s face was
“Chocolate, of course Daddy.” Teddy beamed and looked over at Draco, whose face erupted in a large smile. “You like chocolate cake Uncle Draco?”
Harry looked at the man and then looked at his hand outstretched towards him, Harry shook it, and cautiously said, “Harry.”
Draco woke the next morning, still angry, and went to work. He went through his day numbly and out of his head, anything to make sure that he wouldn’t mess up the potions that he was making. He didn’t want something he did, some mistake he made, affect the sick children. He ended his day after making another 25 remedies and walked out the door of the brewery without saying a word. He walked home without looking at anything but the ground. When he walked into his home, he went straight to the kitchen and pulled out the whiskey and drank. He didn’t pour a glass; he just went straight from the bottle. He didn’t care about how classless it looked, no one was there to judge him on the situation. He just needed a drink. He sat down in the armchair once more, eating leftovers from the day before. He sat and watched the fire and waited. When the clock struck 10, he threw the floo powder into the fire, said Potter’s address, this time without even looking at the card, and waited. Potter’s face showed up again, this time without surprise on his face and he just nodded. Draco walked in, noticed the bottle of whiskey and a tumbler already sitting on the table, and sat down in the armchair next to the couch that Potter was already occupying. He poured himself a glass, took a big gulp, and sighed deeply. He felt calm.
Harry laughed and nodded, letting Draco know he didn’t need to finish his question. He unbuttoned his sleeves and rolled them up on his arms, exposing a myriad of colors, all belonging to different pictures gracefully displayed along Harry’s forearms. Draco’s eyes wired as he looked closer to the tattoo’s, spotting a few that he could understand. Harry turned and twisted his arm so Draco could see all of the sides of his arms, and Draco watched as the muscles flexed and curved as Harry moved.
Draco stepped away from the fireplace and waited hesitantly. He started to worry that Teddy wouldn’t like him, that this was a horrible idea. Why would the boy care to meet him? Why did he even think this would be okay? He was frozen in fear and didn’t have the opportunity to run like he had thought to do, for a young boy, with, Draco realized after close examination, deep navy blue hair that went in different directions, not unlike Potter’s when they were in school. The boy jumped into Potter’s arms and Potter picked him up and spun him around in a circle above his head, raising his shirt slightly above his jeans and Draco could have sworn he saw something colorful on the mans abdomen before he put the boy back down, and they were both looking at him. Draco straightened up at the sight of them and smiled as best as he could at Teddy.
“Yeah, yeah he’s fine. It’s just…” Harry sighed and ran his hands through his hair. “He fell asleep last night with pink hair. Tonk’s pink hair.” He looked down at his feet and felt a pang of sadness towards his godson.
By the time they made it to class, most of the students had already shuffled in and had taken their seats. Hermione and Harry grabbed one of the last tables at the back, which was not ideal since Hermione tended to complain if they were anywhere but front row. She was already starting to raise a fuss when Slughorn clapped in order to gather everyone’s attention.
“Harry, we need to let the medi-witches through.” He heard someone say, but couldn’t place the voice. There were people helping him up but he couldn’t tear his eyes away from Draco’s lifeless form. Had the curse finally run its course? Would whoever cast it feel sick satisfaction in knowing they’d killed Harry’s chance at happiness?
The air felt thick, sweat dripped down Harry’s forehead as he ground himself against the fabric of his bed; and despite the fact that all he wanted to do was mark his territory, Harry tried to hold back for as long as he could. In a moment of pure feral desperation, he moved Draco’s jersey from his face to the bed, balling it up enough to fuck into. On every inhale, the scent was so strong, it wouldn’t have mattered where the jersey was. The added bonus now was, the jersey was catching the rivulets of flowing pre-come that dribbled out of him on each thrust forward.
“Draco, please…” Harry begged, though he could scarcely think what he was even begging for. He just knew deep down that Draco wouldn’t leave him in agony like this.
“Ah! There we are. Much better. Oh-Heavens Dear, when was the last time you had a wash?” Molly blinked.
“A wolf…” Draco sounded hesitant. Perhaps he knew already what was heading his way, or maybe he was worried that something untamed was coming after them.
“Riveting reply, Mr. Potter.” The tone in McGonagall’s voice was annoyance mixed with her usual level of ‘fed-up-ness’. It was barely the start of term and she was already one hundred percent done with their shit.
“Wouldn’t you like to give a grieving mother a second chance?” Death murmured, waving a skeletal hand in the darkness. From the shadows, a second form emerged: Fred Weasley.
“Oh, you like that, don’t you, Potter? Look at you, just gagging for it on the ground for me…” Draco’s hand sped up, as if spurred on by new knowledge of Harry’s interests. “Fucking hell, Potter. You would do just about anything for me right now, wouldn’t you? If I told you to suck me off? Would you be a good boy and do it?”
From the shadows, the real Sirius emerged. Or at least, more real than earlier when Death had donned the man’s visage like a change of clothes. Harry found it hard to breathe, like he was drowning beneath the weight of the crowded room. But Death continued speaking, paying no mind to Harry’s current mental state.
The sounds of showers running, and peals of laughter ringing out against tile, seemed to drown out Harry’s rising panic. On the one hand, there is no way in
Harry stood frozen in place, eyes wide and panicked. There it was again, that scent, heavy and thick, wrapping around Harry in a kind of trance. His eyes fell shut, his breathing increased until he was panting, and still that sweet, sweet scent filled his nose.
“What?” Harry laughed, taken aback. Not that he had a problem with it, since he could more than certainly afford it.
He hated that he’d already returned the jersey, wishing instead he’d kept it for longer, long after the scent had faded.
“Very well. I accept your choice.” The rattling sound of the omnipotent being speaking was the last thing Harry remembered before he succumbed to sleep.
And yet, as the shower water dripped down his back, over his chest, and between his thighs, all Harry could think about was seeing Draco naked and dripping beneath this shower. Harry panted as he imagined what the prat would look like, hair falling in his face, body slicked with water, hands touching himself the same way Harry was.
“OI! Malfoy! Harry wants to talk to you!” Ron shouted, before turning back around and wiggling his brows at Harry. “Good luck.” He whispered before turning to walk away
Harry rolled his eyes, snickering between bites of yorkshire pudding. It was unfortunate that he’d chosen that particular second to eat a rather large bite, as the doors to the Great Hall opened, and Draco Malfoy sauntered in. Wearing. The. Jersey.
“Oh, sit down! I’ll fix you some tea.” Molly shoos Harry into a seat at the rickety table and puts the kettle on, summoning a couple cups and saucers. “You should’ve told me you were coming! I haven’t gotten around to doing any cleaning, so you’ll have to mind the mess. The time before Christmas is always so very busy, you know.” She clatters about, preparing their tea, before she turns around and hands Harry a cup. “Now, to what do I owe the visit, Harry? Not that you need one, dear. You can always visit, any time you’d like.” Molly sits in the chair across from Harry.
Draco awkwardly clings to Harry’s side, glancing around the room. “You’re missing some people,” he observes.
?” Harry gets close enough that the tiny picture of Draco smiles at him softly, then rights himself as he remembers Molly’s presence.
Draco takes in a breath and nods. He shifts his face into a look of unimpressed boredom, his neutral face. If it weren’t for the fact that he’s holding Harry’s hand like he’s about to shatter his bones and standing as straight as physically possible, he wouldn’t look anything other than coolly dignified.
Molly smiles a little at him. “Well, you’re not exactly the most subtle person, are you? You and Draco started getting close, and Ron said some things that made me wonder… Oh, I should’ve asked, just in case.” She glances over at him. “I thought you’d make a good couple since you retook your last year of Hogwarts together. You’ve always rather liked him a lot, haven’t you?”
Draco nods, glancing over at Luna. She’s speaking to the twins animatedly in that dreamy way of hers. Then he looks at Ron. “Weasley,” he says, then looks around the room at the rest of the Weasleys. “Ron,” he corrects himself. “Do you happen to know where the butterbeers are?”
“Yes,” Harry says, then swallows. “Draco thinks everyone hates him. That’s why he didn’t want to come today.”
Harry nods obediently, finding a spare place near Percy and Oliver on the couch and ushering Draco to sit next to him. Ron sits between Harry and Percy.
“Three?” Fred covers his heart with a hand. “My dear Ronniekins, you’re trying to cheat our dearest Georgie out of his due!”
“We’ll be happy to see him. Do tell him not to be too nervous. That poor boy’s been through a lot, hasn’t he?”
“Harry, dear!” She beams at him. “Come in, come in. Would you like anything to drink? Anything to eat? You’re still dreadfully skinny. Are you sure that you’re eating enough?”
“Wait ‘til everyone gets here. It gets far better.” Harry kisses Draco’s cheekbone lightly. “Thank you for coming.”
Draco reaches out to hold Harry’s hand. “Mother,” he says, voice weighted with meaning and shaking with nerves. “You should know that Harry and I are dating.”
“Molly said you were welcome to come to the Burrow for Christmas.” Harry sits next to Draco on the sofa. “She said she’d started on your jumper.”
In the end, they’d decided Harry would inform Molly of their relationship alone. Draco said it was because he didn’t want to sour the mood. Harry knew very well that wasn’t the real reason, but he didn’t say anything. Draco has his reasons for everything.
“It’s the Weasleys. They’re my family.” Harry reaches out to rub his hand against the sharp cut of Draco’s jaw, soft and gentle. He ends at Draco’s pointed chin, guiding his face up to look into his pretty silver eyes. “If you don’t want to tell them, we don’t have to.”
“Hm. It’s something important to you. If… If my father still wanted me around, I would’ve asked you to go to my Christmas.” Draco leans his head on Harry’s shoulder.
“No, no, I’ll be coming,” Harry says, quickly. “It’s just that- I’ll be bringing someone, this year.”
“Very, very wonderful. Be careful, this time of the year. There’re Nargles in the mistletoe.” Luna looks at Harry and Draco with her pretty, wide eyes. “Try not to kiss underneath it.”
“Why? Because you went against Voldemort?” Harry shakes his head. “She went against Voldemort, as well. She saved my life.”
There’s muffled muttering from within the room and footsteps approaching the door. “If this is someone for Lucius, I’m uninterested.”
Draco’s never cared for Harry’s dress sense, which is why he steals Harry’s clothes. It’s only for the best, you see. If Harry doesn’t have his ugly, horrible shirts, then he has to wear some of Draco’s (much more fashionable) clothes instead. There are no ulterior motives.
“I talked about him nearly as much,” Harry says, light and joking. “‘Draco’s eating a different thing for breakfast today’. Or, ‘Draco must’ve gotten a haircut over Christmas’. Or, ‘there must be something wrong with him, because he hasn’t insulted me today’.”
“She and my father are splitting up,” Draco says. This is the honesty they’ve been working on. “She owled me the other day.”
make sure to make yourself comfortable.” Molly opens up a pot atop the stove. The smell of cooking meat fills the kitchen.
“You get used to ‘em when you’re in Romania.” Charlie says, continuing to show his family whatever they’re fussing about.
“They’re a very… colorful family,” Draco says, after a swig. He leans into Harry’s side, seeking his warmth. “This is far different from any holiday I’ve ever had with my family. We don’t talk about intimate matters.”
Guilt settles in Harry’s stomach, coiled like a dragon. “Ah,” Harry says. “Well, I’ll be bringing Draco to Christmas.”
They apparate back to the Burrow. Once Harry lets them in through the door, they’re greeted with perhaps more yelling than before.
“Ginny and Luna are visiting Luna’s father. Bill and Fleur are at her parents’. Hermione’s at Viktor’s. Charlie will be here shortly.” Molly continues stirring her bowl of cake batter. “Now, I want for everyone to be
get up to a lot, for a Prefect,” Harry says. “And I’d rather you not mention Percy’s sex life. I didn’t know he even
“Well, it’s…” Harry looks up from his tea, but doesn’t want to look into Molly’s eyes, so he looks at the family clock over her shoulder. Most of the hands are at Work, or even Bed (Harry notices it’s Ron, and smiles to himself at that). He sees his own at Home, further warming his heart. But there’s another hand, also pointed at Work. “Hang on, is that a new hand on the clock?”
“I’m so sorry uncle Draco! I forget sometimes.” His little head hung and he held Moony close to him.
“Wait, Weasley hurt Granger’s feelings? I didn’t even know he was capable of doing that to her. Aren’t they like, the perfect couple or something?” Draco was looking at Harry in disbelief.
has decided that it’s okay to just take my son wherever she damn well pleases and just ignore that he has a father that wants to see him and spend time with him, and I’m just so damn pissed about it. Everything good in my life has been ripped away from me in less than six months, and I had just started feeling okay with my life.” Draco took a deep breath and felt the heat in his face grow and spread and didn’t dare look at Harry. He just felt a hand on his shoulder and that was all it took.
“Professor? Why Potter, I thought with it being what, 8 years since you last attended Hogwarts that you would have called me something other than Professor.” She looked up from her parchment and noticed the look of confusion from Harry. She smiled and nodded and said, “If it makes you more comfortable, you can simply call me McGonagall, seeing as you calling me Minerva might make us both a little uncomfortable.” Harry noticeably relaxed and smiled at her. “Have a biscuit Potter.” She put a hand out to the small brass tin that sat on the corner of her desk and Harry obliged. “So, what have you come to talk about?”
The office suddenly went silent and Harry turned around to see both Ron and Hermione staring at him, eyes wide, mouths gaped open, utter disbelief on both of their faces.
“Actually,” Harry’s smile got bigger, and Draco could see a twist of something forming behind his eyes. “No.” And Harry suddenly burst out laughing.
“I’m fine Hermione. Honest.” Her facial expression calmed, but not by much. “I’m serious Hermione! Nothing went down, he didn’t try to hex or jinx me. He just… sat.”
“Well, Harry, what I’m trying to say is, is there any way that you would be able to keep Teddy? It’s not that we don’t want him in the house, it’s just that he requires a lot more energy and attention that we can provide him. And we’d be happy to watch him while you’re at work and we can take turns on the weekends that way Ted and I can still see him, if it’s no trouble to you that is.” She had spoken so quickly that it took Harry a minute to gather everything that she had said, and once he did, he felt as if his heart was going to burst.
“Fuck it.” He sighed. He walked over to the fireplace and read the address on the card again and once again was staring at the face of Harry Potter.
Harry looked back at him with confusion on his face, he honestly had no idea what he was getting at and honestly didn’t want to get into an all-out war in the middle of his sitting room. “I was just trying to talk Malfoy, don’t be so sensitive about the shit.” Harry realized he was now standing up as well, facing Draco with the same intensity.
“I don’t understand.” Draco said slowly. “You’re a wizard, and yet you make cakes the muggle way because making a mess,
Teddy’s eyes went wide with realization. “I’m sorry Uncle Draco! Here, let me.” Teddy hopped off his step and stood next to Draco. “You have to measure out all of the dry ingredients and mix them together. Here’s what you need to measure out.” A piece of parchment appeared in front of the two of them. “Just follow this and Daddy and I will mix the wet ingredients.”
Harry changed Teddy and tucked him bed, as he was walking out if the room, he looked back at him one more time, as he usually does to see what color his hair would take as he slept, and noticed that the bubblegum pink was still there, shining brightly against the dark of the room. Harry smiled to himself and closed the door. He walked down to sitting room, poured himself a glass of Scotch and relaxed into the couch by the fire.
Draco snapped his mouth shut in shock. He looked down at Harry and saw the pain in his face, how his whole demeanor changed, making him look defeated. He slumped back into the armchair and hung his head. “Fuck.” He whispered. “Merlin, Potter, I’m sorry. I was out of line on that one.” He shook his head in disbelief of himself.
Harry looked down at the new list of cases on his desk, no doubt put there by Kingsley early this morning. He sighed and dove into his paperwork. It had only been about 2 hours since he had started in on the cases when he heard a knock at his door. He waved his wand behind his head to open the door. He had turned to see who had come in when he noticed a head of bushy brown hair poking in through the door frame.
“Not today Ron, I still have 3 cases to finish and I know that if I don’t do them tonight, they’ll never get done.” He looked over at his best friend and tried his best to give an ‘I’m sorry’ look to him, even though Ron always saw straight through those.
“Daddy!” Teddy finally stopped jumping and bounced down next to Harry. “I had so much fun with Uncle Draco yesterday, when is he coming back over to play?” Teddy flopped over and laid his head on Harry’s lap.
“Well I bloody well wasn’t expecting you to reach out at –,” Harry looked at the clock. “10 O’clock at night.”
So I have severely slacked off in updating this story. I've had so many ideas on how to continue with this story that it's been a bit overwhelming. I'm so grateful for everyone that has commented, given kudos, and bookmarked this story to keep reading it and those that have been reading since the beginning and have stayed with the story. I'm going to try to keep up with the story in a more timely manner in the future. I hope you enjoy!
“And what? Ted loves him, he even brought him a stuffed wolf that changes colors because it reminded him of Teddy. Hell, Ted even convinced him to make a cake with us last night, well, try to make a cake, but it ended up in a food fight with a huge mess for me to clean up.” Harry laughed as he remembered the events that laid out the prior night.
“Hello Molly.” Harry smiled and took the woman in his arms into a big hug, one that looked as though Harry was about to snap in half. They stepped apart and Harry stepped to the side and smiled widely to her and then back to Draco. “Molly, I’d like to properly introduce you to Draco Malfoy.” He nodded to Draco and finally let go of Draco’s wrist, which Draco had noticed that he had still been holding, even during the hug between him and Mrs. Weasley. “Draco, this is Molly Weasley. This is the mother I never got to have, but was wonderful enough to love me as one of her own. Also, one of the best damn cooks I have ever met in my life.”
, to him, and he nodded in return. Teddy looked back up at him with tears slipping from his eyes, his mouth open, words unable to form from the boy. Draco watched him as he jumped off the couch, holding the wolf tightly in his arms, and ran over to Draco and jumped into his lap and hugged him tightly.
“Yes, he’s a lot smarter than I ever was at that age.” Harry responded with a smile as well and laughed lightly, turning to look back to where Teddy had just stood.
He felt hot, wet tears streaming down his face and he didn’t know how to stop them. He felt the hand remain on his shoulder as the tears came faster and harder and his breathing began to labor and hitch in his chest. He couldn’t understand why he was crying, and he hated the fact that it was happening in front of Harry Fucking Potter but at this moment, he couldn’t change what was going on, so he just let it continue. He felt as if he was crying forever when the tears finally began to cease, either that or he just physically couldn’t produce tears anymore, either way, he was glad it was stopping. He looked up and saw that Harry had moved on the couch and was sitting closer to him, hand still on his shoulder and a look of concern on his face, but sympathy playing in his eyes. He went to tear his gaze away from Harry when he heard a movement behind Harry and he looked up to see Teddy standing there, holding his stuffed wolf that Draco had gotten him, staring at Draco with intense sadness in his eyes. The boy ran over to him so quickly that he couldn’t stop him even if he had tried to.
“It’s fine. With everything that’s happened, I honestly expected something like this.” Draco sighed at this. He had missed his mother terribly throughout the entire time he was dealing with his own issues, but he knew that she needed her space after father had died, and he was making sure that she got that. The last time he had spoken to Narcissa, was when Astoria had filed for divorce and he didn’t think her heart could take that as it was.
The silence remained as they sat in the sitting room until Draco finally spoke up. “He’s a very smart child.” He looked at Harry and smiled, a bit of adoration in his eyes for the boy.
“I would be honored Teddy.” Draco smiled and happily took the book. They both got comfortable in the armchair that Draco got so used to residing in while at the Potter home and he began the story.
“Yes, it’s still here, it’s right around the corner there. It might be sleeping so don’t be upset if it doesn’t want to answer your questions.” McGonagall smiled and pointed to where the sorting hat sat, sleeping soundly on a shelf.
They both turned suddenly, making Teddy knock over the bowl of eggs, which Harry had noticed and stopped it mid-air and placed it back on the counter with a wave of his hand.
He looked over at Teddy, who was making what he called ‘flour angels’. He laughed and shook his head and looked down at his clothes. He, like the other two, was covered head to toe in food, and he was surprised to realize that he didn’t mind. He looked back up at Harry and noticed that the man was looking at him as well. He felt that same feeling in his chest again and instantly looked away, feeling a flush in his cheeks.
“I’d like that.” Draco smiled back. He finally stood up from the armchair and headed towards the fireplace.
