“Hey mate! How’ve you been feeling?” He didn’t wait for the answer before he began pointing at the pizzas, “We’ve got a classic pepperoni and mushroom, that one’s a meat lover’s,” (at this he chuckled approvingly, leaving Harry to wonder if it was meant to be an innuendo) “and this last one’s got some vegetables, in case you don’t think that tomato sauce counts as your daily serving.”
“Did you bond over your mutual dislike of me?” Harry asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
He watched Draco grimace apologetically and then head down the stairs and, at a loss for what to do himself, he retreated to the bathroom to splash cold water on his face and glower at his reflection.
He just needed a familiar face. Someone who cared for him.
Harry nodded and accepted a hug from each of his friends. When the door closed behind him he headed back to drawing room and carefully studied each of the memories that hung on the wall.
“Nothing about this is ever going to be fair to either of us,” Draco replied, eyes tired and shoulders slumped.
“I… I’m just not sure this is a good idea.”
They worked their way up through the rest of the house, popping briefly into various guest rooms that didn’t have much excitement to offer. They both walked right past the master bedroom without so much as a glance its direction. When they got to Sirius’s old room, Harry hovered his hand over the door knob, not certain he wanted to see what they had done with it. At Malfoy’s encouraging nod, he twisted the handle and pushed the door open.
“Thanks,” Malfoy’s smiled widened, and he leant in towards Harry, lips puckered slightly. Malfoy fully stumbled backwards when he realized what he’d been going to do and he stuttered out an apology, looking horrified.
Before Niamh left, she propped up the head of Harry’s bed, so he could see the room better. His glasses continued to hover nicely in front of his face. Straining his ears, Harry could hear more strained murmuring outside of the door before -
How was it that after opening up a little to each other, after asking one another to be themselves, to not give up and exchanging reassurances, this could still be so painfully awkward?
Was Malfoy the ‘partner’ that Niamh had referred to earlier?
George, standing behind her with a hand on her back said, “Shag, I expect.”
Wrinkling his nose, Harry thought this over. This relationship was so new to him. Something about that felt like pushing a boundary he wouldn’t be allowed to push yet.
“Oh,” Draco winced. “Er, it wasn’t with you, actually. The first time with you was quite a lot nicer.”
, Harry.
“Right, then,” Harry said over the kitchen table, a tea clutched firmly between his hands.
They remained silent until they reached the front steps of the castle, where McGonagall stood to greet them with a wave and the warmest smile Harry had ever seen on her face.
“Guess what I’ve got hold of?” She asked eagerly, before her eyes sharpened and she exclaimed, “Oh my God, you two have shagged, haven’t you?”
“Go,” Harry grinned. “The dishes will be clean when you get home!”
Rolling his eyes at the dubious look Harry was giving him, Draco added, “I’m obviously fine, Harry.”
Harry turned to Draco and meaningfully flicked his eyes towards the couch. He waited for Draco to settle on it before sitting next to him and turning to Longeman.
The boy abruptly turned his hair black and curly to match Harry, then platinum blonde and smooth to match Malfoy, who smirked widely at Harry. He quickly pulled his smirk in and turned back to Teddy when Harry met his eyes curiously.
“Okay,” Harry acknowledged in a small voice.
And all the while, there was Malfoy, channelling the rage he clearly felt as much as Harry did into something productive. Treating the girl’s parents with compassion while gaining the information they needed to confirm their next steps. Making a plan to investigate the pressing issue of dementors plaguing the streets of London, rather than only focusing on researching ways to destroy them. This memory, Harry realized was why his past self had been able to move on from his concerns about working with Malfoy.
“Harry, Draco,” Hagrid greeted in his usual genial manner as he fidgeted with the locks and swung the gates open for them. “Come on in. Harry,” he lifted his unruly brows to study Harry with his warm black eyes, “how’re ya feeling?"
Harry pointedly cleared his throat and stood in the doorway with his arms crossed.
“Draco!” Harry greeted enthusiastically the moment that Draco walked in the door. Harry had been waiting in the sitting room, listening for the crack of apparition for the last half hour. “I’ve got an idea!”
“What the
“Draco’s at work, Teddy. He’ll be by to visit you soon, though. Harry, you and Teddy go to the park together every week. Last week you went to the zoo. Do you remember Teddy?”
That was where Molly found him, asleep, when she let herself in later that evening. She woke Harry with a gentle brush of her fingers across his forehead, and sat in the bed next to him, holding him tightly as he cried some more. When he was done, she brought him to the kitchen and fed him. She didn’t say anything beyond gently cooing his name the entire time she was with him.
“No,” shaking his head, Malfoy pulled the first memory of the case.
“Sure,” Harry said, flopping down on the couch and letting Malfoy put the film in. He tried not to pay too much attention to Malfoy’s arse as he bent down to pull the film from a low shelf.
“Do you?” Hermione leaned forward to study it, humming thoughtfully. “It’s not at all familiar to me.”
Malfoy regarded him fondly, “It’s your recovery, what would you like to do?”
They followed her back into the kitchen, avoiding one another’s eyes. Fleur stood at the window with a baby in her arms, looking out into the garden. Her eyes lit as she turned to them.
Harry headed down the hall and nudged Gandalf out of the way with his foot so he could open the door. Malfoy leaned heavily on the doorframe, with Oscar on his shoulder. As Harry swung the door fully open, Oscar came flying into the entryway and Harry turned to watch as he settled himself on the troll leg umbrella stand with a satisfied hoot.
With a thrill, he realized that Draco was just as hard as he was, and after allowing himself a moment to press himself up tighter to Draco, he let his hand drift from Draco’s side down to grasp at his hard cock through his trousers. Draco let out a little moan and, pleased, Harry moved to undo the clasp on his trousers and reach his hand in.
Draco came in a moment later, accompanied by Molly.
Draco swatted him on the arm before stepping away. He nodded to Harry before heading up the stairs.
“That horrific spot?” Malfoy asked, contritely biting back his amusement once more.
“Ah, here we are!”
“I-” Harry scrubbed at the back of his head, at a loss.
Nodding her approval, Andromeda said, “I’ve already dropped up a bunch of frozen meals for you. There’s a chili, vegetable soup and a pasta dish in your freezer alright? All labelled with cooking instructions.”
“Like hell it won’t! If there are people out there who are still stupid enough to believe that you’ve not only managed to manipulate me, but nearly every other person of notable importance from the war, they need to be set straight. And Longeman’s just a bully, plain and simple.”
The feel of Draco’s cock heavy on his tongue, of his thighs twitching and his hands tugging at Harry’s hair was intoxicating. Harry found himself needing to push down on his own cock to calm himself enough to keep going. When Draco came, Harry swallowed it down and licked him clean until Draco shivered and pushed Harry away.
“Mr. Potter, I’m Niamh Brady. You’re safe in St. Mungo’s now. I’m a healer.” She charmed Harry’s glasses to hover just above his face, allowing him to see so long as he kept his head perfectly still. Healer Brady had a soft, round face and auburn hair.
“Harry… we’ve already talked about this.” Her brown eyes were teary and apologetic already, which set Harry’s teeth on edge. “There isn’t a way. The way your memories were taken… there’s nothing anyone can do. I wish it were different.”
happened?” Harry exclaimed, jumping to his feet. “Did Malfoy do that to you? How fucking dare he?”
“Psh, like you could out-hex me,” she smirked as Draco wrapped her in his arms and picked her up off the ground.
“I’ll be owling Draco to let him know as well. If you consent to me doing so, that is.”
She glared half-heartedly at him before pushing the file towards Harry and Draco. “
“Good job, Teddy!” Harry said in a stage whisper. “What about snakes?”
“She was my anchor. My safe place. She never shared a room with my father and when I was young if he was in one of his moods, she and I would lay in her bed together, with the curtains drawn and she’d cast an illusion of the constellations on the roof of the canopy. We hadn’t done it since I was twelve, maybe, but then… that year, she’d steal me away to look at the stars in our little fort as much as she could get away with it. I suppose it was just as much for her as it was for me.”
“No,” Draco shook his head, accepting a bag of popcorn from Hermione and offering it to Harry. “I just wondered if your thoughts had changed, given that you don’t remember the choices you’d made earlier.”
Humming as Draco gently ran his fingers through his hair, Harry drifted in that luscious state between asleep and awake, satiated and content.
The hot tea washed away some of the tightness in Harry’s throat. “I just-” he began.
Draco bit down on a brilliant smile. “I’d like that.”
A photograph of Harry and Malfoy with their arms wrapped around each other as they laughed. They each wore a Weasley sweater, Harry’s red and Malfoy’s green, with the initial of their first names in gold and silver respectively. Malfoy’s hair was longer than Harry remember it, brushing his shoulders. But not so long that he’d ever be mistaken for his father. He had piercings Harry hadn’t noticed when he’d woken up to Malfoy’s blurry face. A silver hoop through his left eyebrow and a small black diamond stud in an earlobe. It all suited him well, making his face seem chiselled rather than pointy and emphasizing the grey in his eyes.
But Draco spent the rest of the week deep in the archives of his mind. Harry would review his allotted memories during the day while Draco was at training and worry over Draco as he became more frustrated and jittery from his own time using the pensieve in the evenings.
For a moment Harry stood and watched them, astounded that Draco was so smoothly fluent. Shaking his head, he went out into the yard where Ron and Bill were chasing Teddy around as Andromeda and Arthur chatted.
Malfoy was laying on his side, a stream of moonlight highlighting the curve of his neck. Harry’s breath caught and Malfoy rolled over, eyes fluttering open.
Ignoring him, Harry raced up the stairs to the workout room with his heart racing and his own fists clenched in anger. He stomped down the hall to the entrance of the room, ready to tear Malfoy a new one.
“Harry?” The sound of footsteps came rushing down the stairs and Malfoy banged on the door to the bathroom. “Harry, what’s wrong?”
Shit. Why couldn’t Harry manage to control his temper, for at least the morning after Draco’s tough day? Draco was probably just stressed about the idea of going back to his training after the way he’d been treated by Longeman.
“Of course,” Harry answered adding the requested milk and turning back to the table to set their cups down. “I pay attention.”
Harry’s heart plummeted. He squeezed his eyes closed.
On Saturday morning, while Draco was at a special training exercise, Harry watched a memory of Draco coaxing Harry to stop brooding and talk about what was on his mind. Then, as though he perfectly understood Harry and the remedy such a situation called for, Draco whisked him away for an impromptu seeker’s game. When Harry emerged into the kitchen he’d made a decision.
“Ooh, yes! So I was thinking after we all talked the other night, that there must be some way to get information on which wizards and witches worked at Azkaban around the time the dementors started going for Harry. I thought about checking with Kingsley but I know that you don’t want to stir up anything more with Longeman, Draco, so I figured I’d best not. So I was thinking about where else – ”
The rest of the day had gone quite pleasantly, really. Harry had given in and taken a pain potion and a bit of a nap after the film was over. Then Dromeda and Teddy had come by again for a late lunch and some time at the park. Throughout the afternoon Harry and Malfoy had sat companionably at the kitchen table while Harry began to review his Charm’s readings and Malfoy worked on an essay for one of his classes. Harry wasn’t sure why Malfoy had chosen to sit with him, rather than in his study. Maybe it was just to keep an eye out for Harry overexerting himself. It felt like more than that, though. It felt like both of them just wanted to be nearby one another, as though watching the first memories had chipped further away at the nervous tension between them.
Harry’s heart flipped over. “Well, I don’t think you need to feed me any sort of aphrodisiac to get me to flirt with you.”
“Right.” Harry craned his neck trying to catch a glimpse of it. “Of a… dragon?”
The pleased look on George’s face reminded Harry so strongly of Arthur Weasley that he couldn’t help but grin in return.
“Wonderfully so. Madam Malkin is training me up to become primary owner and manager of the shop when she retires. I get to design the latest fashions. I do all sorts of amazing custom work. Oh!” Astoria lit up as she looked to Harry, “If you know anyone looking for a gown or dress robes made, do send them my way! Custom work really is the most fulfilling.”
Focused on the patchwork quilt as he was, Harry couldn’t see the expression on Draco’s face. But he did hear him let out an amused huff of air.
Harry’s stomach squirmed at hearing that, but he strove to keep his reaction internal. He thought over the last weeks. Of how Draco had pushed back his obvious worry to help Harry recover from his memory binge the last couple of days, without guilting him regardless of how much Harry deserved it. Anger burned away any trace of uncertainty in his gut.
As they climbed the stairs from the kitchen, Oscar came to land on Malfoy’s shoulder. He’d been particularly clingy with the man since the morning, seemingly happy to have him back. Malfoy stroked his head affectionately and murmured quietly to the bird.
They headed down the sterile halls of Mungo’s, all sorts of strange sounds echoing along them. Harry glanced to Malfoy at his side and asked, “Are you always that polite?”
The few meetings that Harry had had with Longeman had not improved Harry’s opinion of the man from his poor first impression. Longeman was also teaching the trainee Aurors their Basics in Investigative Techniques course. Not that he’d needed the confirmation after what Longeman had insinuated during his conversations with Harry, but Ron had told Harry that Longeman didn’t like Draco. Draco would never say as much himself.
“Well, what if I’m not dressed properly?” Draco protested, his bottom lip sticking out petulantly.
Harry cringed, “That I’m not sure I’m up to redoing them all?”
“Thanks. I just-“ He gnawed on his lip for a moment. “I don’t know how it could ever be the same. How can it not feel… as though I’m forcing myself into someone else’s life?”
“Really. Sounds just like you, though. You were always brave, weren’t you?”
Pulling up short, Ron blinked at her. He took a moment to catch his breath before sheepishly replying, “Sorry, training went late, didn’t think I’d make it in time. I will be a paragon of serenity.”
“I’ll take it!” Harry replied jovially.
“I just watched the memory of that, well of the beginning, a couple of hours ago,” Harry grinned as he replayed it in his mind. Malfoy had been snarky and nervous as he tried to learn the patronus. In what could only have been an attempt to cheer the man up, past-Harry had turned on the telly, finally landing on Jurassic Park. They’d watched the whole film together, just as they had the other day. Though in the memory version, Malfoy hadn’t stopped running his mouth through the entire thing.
“He was…gave me the cold shoulder for a month after I took down Auntie Wallburga, though.”
“Got some ice?”
“I’m happy for you,” she replied with a quick squeeze to Harry’s shoulder. “Now up on the bed for assessment.”
Malfoy set down his fork and leaned towards Harry, his blonde brows furrowing. “For everything from when we were younger. You don’t remember all the steps between you rather rightfully hating me and now, so I need to apologize for all of it.”
Draco was not at all how Harry remembered. He brought tea and coffee out for the Auror’s on duty several times during the hours he was at home. He walked around their home in dressy trousers, large knit sweaters, and wool socks that were surely made by Molly. Harry had overheard Ron poking fun at Draco for wearing suit pants around the house, Draco insisted that they were far more comfortable than denims. Harry wasn’t sure about that, but he couldn’t argue that they
Draco shrugged, “Reasonably.”
“Absolutely not, Harry. You’re going to cause yourself harm if you over do it,” Hermione chided in that bossy tone of hers. God, she drove Harry mad sometimes.
He glanced back up to meet Draco’s gaze, “Are you okay with this?”
“Mr. Potter,” Longeman said after a long slurp, “I wish I could give you better news. We had no stand-out suspects in your case, though we are, of course, following several leads. There have been no concerns noted by the Aurors patrolling your property, which is both a good and a bad thing, as it means the perpetrator is too smart to reveal themself.”
“I’m going to bring in a more senior healer, Harry. We’re going to need to do some more tests. We will figure it out, I promise you.”
“Great,” Malfoy gave him a gentle smile. “We’ll order pizza. Don’t overdo it today. If you want to do the third memory without me, go ahead. But if you’d rather wait for me, that’s fine too. I’ll make sure there’s time before Dudley’s over. I’ll be home around five.”
“Good evening Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy,” he greeted as he pulled open the door. “Wonderful to see you. Once you make your way up the stairs Annalise will show you to your table.”
“Sorry,” Harry bit his lip. “I - uh, yeah. It would be good to have you come with me, actually.”
“You want me to come again?” Malfoy asked, looking bewildered.
you’re not to be going out alone right now!” Draco shouted.
Harry gave a surly shrug.
Draco’s eyes widened, “Those are lovely, thank you.” His smile held a certain apprehension.
Harry let out an amused huff. After a long moment he asked, “How are you, George? Last I can remember…”
Part 2
Harry scrambled to towel himself off and pull his pajama pants up before opening the door. Malfoy bit down on his lip and kept his gaze firmly on Harry’s face.
“You know,” Harry said. “I managed alright on my own yesterday morning.”
Draco smiled back warmly, then hummed in thought. “Let’s see… What food do you hate?”
“Molly will settle you in at home?”
“Well, all the same,” Arthur frowned. “I’m off to find Draco.”
Harry stopped in the pathway to look seriously at Draco. He ignored Gandalf barking in impatience and said, “I would rather have to deal with the resurrection of Voldemort than ever eat Haggis.”
What harm could it do, really? To watch just one more. He couldn’t help that the memories he was missing made for a really good story. He’d watched, stomach twisting in horror, as he and Draco realized that a little muggle girl, out trick or treating on Hallowe’en, had been subjected to the dementors kiss. Her parents would never understand what really happened to her. The pallid, drawn faces of her parents were so impactful Harry wondered how he ever could have forgotten them.
Harry followed him into the kitchen and took a seat at the table to watch. Draco looked in a few different cupboards before pulling a sauce pan out, releasing a quiet “Aha!” under his breath.
“Rie?” He asked.
With a smile slightly stifled with anxiety, Draco said, “Fine, thanks Harry.”
“Yes,” Malfoy tugged nervously at the knot his hair was pulled into. “We’ve become fairly good friends. He’s hoping to come and see you soon, check that you’re alright.”
Shaking his head he turned back and watched as Molly treated Draco and then asked Harry the very same question.
With a soft smile, she said, “It started when he apologized to me. And really, we’ve got quite a lot of interests in common. He’s also very curious about all things muggle, so that helped us along the way.”
“Did I?” Harry rubbed at the back of his neck. “Been a while since I’ve lost control of my magic. Wish it’d given that arse a jolt. He’d have deserved it.”
That didn’t quite work as he’d intended because Harry felt his stomach turn leaden as he thought of all the photographs hung in Grimmauld Place. “I’m pretty sure I don’t remember.”
He met Ron’s eyes gravely. Ron nodded, silently promising Harry that he’d look out for Draco.
that!” Malfoy retorted, doing his best to look offended but clearly having fun with it. He noticed Harry at the doorway and dropped the hand he was flapping Dudley’s way. “Harry! Sorry, I didn’t want to wake you.”
said were absolutely terrible.
“Okay.”
“You need a good challenge in a partner, Harry. Someone to balance you out when you need it.”
“Good,” Harry dipped to kiss Draco deeply, cupping his face in his palms. He kissed him until Draco seemed sufficiently convinced and then dropped to his knees in front of the chair.
“Yes, really. You know, Draco, when I say or do something, I usually mean it.”
? Then that’s fine by me.”
Harry couldn’t have said he
“Memory’s about half an hour,” Malfoy told her.
There had been an article in the Prophet following their visit to Madam Malkin’s that did, indeed, analyze every minute detail of their interactions just as Harry had imagined passersby were doing at the time.
She continued to explain softly, “You were attacked three days ago. We’ve had to keep you unconscious since then, due to brain swelling. We needed time to support your brain to heal. This morning we discontinued the charms, in order to allow you to wake naturally when you were ready. I imagine you’re in some pain, right now. Can we get this potion in you to help before we talk more?”
And yet, Harry thought, Narcissa Malfoy had cut her son out of her life altogether as a result? At least, that was Harry’s impression of the situation.
“Yes.”
“It seems,” Malfoy replied with an amused smile, “that Kreacher had some squirreled away in preparation for my anticipated return.”
The present Malfoy leaned towards Harry while their past-selves were caught in a moment of awkward silence and muttered, “You kept that bottle unopened for over a year until Dudley found it and decided he wanted to test out if magical drinks were any different.”
“How’d you meet?”
“This is Oscar?”
“Astoria, we’ve got no leads on who may have attacked Harry. I’m not really involved in any pureblood events anymore… have you heard any whisperings?”
Next to Harry, Draco was sitting so rigidly he looked as though he might snap.
“You’re kidding right?”
“The sooner we figure this out the better,” Draco frowned.
“It most certainly would have,” Draco replied wryly, leaning in to kiss Harry.
“Morning,” he mumbled as he brushed against the wall to walk past Harry, seemingly oblivious to the state Harry was in.
“What is your happiest memory?” Draco asked, clearly wanting to counter the previous question.
The two of them walked down the hall to the staircase. Hesitating, Malfoy rested his hand on the bannister and turned back, “Thank you, Harry.”
“Uh…” Thoroughly overwhelmed by the films he instead turned to Malfoy. “What about that Will and Ted Adventure one you like?”
“Cantaloupe,” Draco curled his lips in disdain. “It’s such an unpleasant texture.”
Part 1
Harry smiled in resignation. “’Course. Thanks for the food.”
As they approached, Ron slapped his forehead and exclaimed, “Hermione, Harry! I forgot we were having lunch. Draco and I were just going to eat.”
tonight,” she commanded. “Tonight is to celebrate your reunion.”
“And you, Harry. How have you been feeling?”
“I wanted to study dinosaurs and draw their skeletons,” Draco replied instantly. “You?”
“Harry,” Niamh said gently, “I need to ask you a few questions, to assess how your brain is healing, before we talk about that. Okay?”
“Oh,” Hermione rolled her eyes, “they’re always like this.”
So, Harry stood on the steps of his godfather’s hated childhood home with very little hope. Oscar had settled himself onto Harry’s shoulder the moment he’d left the cab, which brought some comfort, at least.
Harry smiled slyly. “That was my first thought when I saw your cock. Thought it might kill the mood to say it out loud, though.”
“So, Mr. Potter, now that you’ve recovered a little, I’ve got to ask you some questions.”
“Have you been having lots of nightmares since coming home?” Draco’s voice was hushed. Harry could see the edges of his features in the bit of light filtering in from the hallway. He looked concerned.
“I’ve been holding back my dark humour around you for a week,” Draco bemoaned while he blinked innocently at Harry.
Harry pressed his left eye shut again, hoping for better results on reopening it. His vision did clear, just a little. The face above him looked more familiar now. But if anything, that left Harry more confused and distraught.
Harry frowned, “Okay…”
Harry scowled, “You’re not supposed to call me out.”
Malfoy nodded with a sad smile. Then he turned to Ron, expression hardening.
Harry pulled open the door to see an Asian witch in pink flannel pajamas. Without a trace of the smug look that typically adorned her face, it took him a moment to realize it was Pansy Parkinson.
“Was he? I mean, the woman cut me out of her life entirely because I’m gay.”
Harry shrugged. It did feel a little voyeuristic to watch memories of the two of him on his own. “Do you have a preference?”
A long moment of contemplation (during which Draco began to look increasingly uncomfortable) later, Harry answered, “I dunno on the one hand, I suppose it’d be like a naughty homemade film. On the other, who would
Harry nodded, his throat too tight to answer otherwise. Instantly, he was enveloped in Draco’s arms. Harry clutched the fabric at Draco’s back. They buried their cold noses into one another’s necks. Harry inhaled the scent of peppermint that Draco carried. Draco gave a small sigh, and Harry could feel all the tension release from his muscles.
Right, then. Harry was going to be a professor. They stepped onto the rotating staircase to McGonagall’s office. Several portraits greeted them with friendly waves as they entered the room. Dumbledore and Snape’s were both empty, Harry noted. He wondered if perhaps they’d been forewarned of the visit and decided to hide. Their teacher headed straight to the cabinet with the pensieve and shrunk it to the size of a tea saucer. She wrapped it in packing paper and slipped it into a velvet lined box before handing it carefully to Malfoy, who tucked it into the pocket of his robes.
That question scared Harry more than any other so far. More than the knowledge that he’d been attacked, the details of which he remained concerningly ignorant of. More than waking up to Draco Malfoy.
“Owl order, don’t worry,” Harry said with a raised brow.
“They were targeting me?” Harry asked, not feeling as surprised by this as he’d like.
Harry, whose interest had been stirred by the conversation, reached for Draco and was pleased to find he’d reacted similarly to the topic. They came for the second time that evening frotting against one another, with Harry’s hand wrapped around the both of them as he imagined what it might be like, to be
The memory was one from just after Christmas, one of Draco’s. On diving in, Harry found himself on the familiar doorstep of Andromeda Tonks. Draco, wearing a now familiar expression of restrained anxiety, stood next to Harry’s past-self holding two brightly wrapped packages.
“How, er… How did we do it?”
Cringing, Hermione confirmed, “Afraid so, Harry. But I’ll help you catch up again whenever you’re ready, just let me know!”
“Really?” Harry found himself pleased to hear it.
He’d never felt so important. Of course, he was considered the ‘Saviour of the Wizarding World’ and all that, but that was really down to the mechanics of the prophecy and Voldemort’s happening to choose him over Neville. Draco made
“Where is Ginny?” he asked, panic eking back up. Niamh’s eyes tightened with concern. “Or- or Mrs. Weasley? Or Hermione?”
right above him, which was enticing and weird.
“It won’t happen again. I swear I’ve learnt my lesson.”
“No,” Niamh contemplated, eyes twinkling, “you look happy.”
couldn’t he have been so on top of things that night last week when Draco showed up at their front door?), they offered apologies to one another.
He’d been dreaming about Draco. It had been a fragmented dream, jumping from scene to scene. Now that Harry was awake the bits of it were slipping from his mind. A falling chandelier, blood and water mixing on a tiled floor, the feeling of searing heat.
Groaning, Harry mumbled, “Like I will learn from my mistakes.”
“I was watching, Draco. It was a fucking interrogation,” Ron snapped.
The scene faded to black, and with a swooping sensation, Harry founded himself seated at his kitchen table once more.
“Or – what did you call it? – my perfunctory arguments.”
A blush spread across Malfoy’s cheeks. “I’ve many favourites, depending on the genre.”
“So?” Harry prompted as he set the flowers on Draco’s night stand and sat next to him on the bed. “Dinner?”
“So when’s this one from?” Harry inquired.
“Yeah, well that was before it turned out it was all wasted time and I’ll have to do it all over again.”
This time, they landed behind Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. Harry looked down at their past-selves, entirely ignoring Molly as she rushed towards them.
“Pot-” he rasped. He tried again, this time managing to shout, “Potter!”
at the cost of your wellbeing, Draco.”
Niamh bit her lip, appearing to be considering her response. Finally she said, “Harry, I’m sorry. It’s February the 6
and its toxic hype.
” He blurted out, coughing a little at his dry throat.
Harry was up in a millisecond, the lights in the room flickering dangerously around him. “Longeman,” he gritted out, “Did you just threaten my partner in our home?”
Andromeda showed up at noon with an orange haired Teddy and a full deli’s worth of sandwich ingredients. Harry was fairly certain that he was not alone in breathing a sigh of relief. After Hermione had left, Malfoy explained that he’d taken the next two days off of his training to be around if Harry needed him. By the look on his face, Malfoy half regretted it. He’d gone to sit in his study and work on an essay, leaving the door open so that he and Harry could have some sense of proximity to one another, without having to actually navigate the reality of it.
Draco smiled his thanks. “Once I’ve narrowed it down a bit, I’ll pass it on to Longeman. His team hasn’t exactly
“Didn’t help much, did it?” Harry waved his hand at the many papers that had been published since. Despite the warmth that had blossomed in his chest when Malfoy confirmed the truth about the Patronuses, he wasn’t ready to let go of the anger that reading the papers had spawned. “They deserve to be burnt down.”
With a shrug Ginny said, “I don’t know if you’ve noticed this, Harry, but now he’s not a little snob living under the thumb of his pyscho parents, he’s quite likeable.”
“Good.” Pansy pulled out her wand and cast a patronus. A dainty cat sprang into life on Harry’s front step. “Go tell George- Draco’s fine, he is at Grimmauld. Meet me at home.”
“Draco sweet talked her into telling him how to remove the sticking charm,” Ron replied casually. “You donated her to a museum. Once she found out that you and Draco were more than colleagues… she er, was even less fond of that than she was of the idea of muggleborns and blood traitors using her house as a base against Voldemort.”
Harry stared at the closed door for a moment, before saying “So…” unsure where to go from here.
A surprising warmth spread through Harry as he regarded his dinner mates. Malfoy leant back in his chair, shaking his head good naturedly and chiding Dudley for teaching bad manners to their pets. He looked the most relaxed that Harry had seen him since all of this began. With perhaps, the exception of when he had been playing with Teddy the other day.
Sighing heavily, Draco said, “From the research I’ve done around it in relation to your situation, I
Shrugging, Draco said, “I’m not letting that ruin our evening. I’d been anticipating flirting, therefore, we shall flirt.”
“He was gaping like a fish,” Dudley shared, before roaring with laughter.
How could he have possibly thought that Malfoy had really changed? How could Hermione and Ron have thought it? He was probably just using them to increase his own image. To make himself look better. He clearly didn’t have any real regard for them or he wouldn’t have hurt Ron. And somehow he’d already begun to fool Harry with his charming little smiles and his quiet laughter and his bullshit earnestness.
Harry winced apologetically but couldn’t pull his thoughts into a proper response. Which was just as well, because evidently Draco was winding up for a good rant.
“Shouldn’t you be better at cooking if you’re so good at potions?” Harry asked.
“Yes, well I’m feeling pretty well, thanks,” Harry replies with such a broad smile he felt he ought to be a little embarrassed by it.
He wasn’t sure what breed the dragon was, but it consisted of shimmering grey scales that ranged in shade from pewter to pearl. It danced around the middle of his back, twisting and turning happily.
Draco flinched a little at the name. He met Harry’s eyes, “You really don’t think she was involved?”
“No more than one a day to begin with. Next week we can see about increasing that,” Niamh warned. She turned to Malfoy, “And make sure none of them are too emotionally intense. Best work up to those.”
for this information but I -  I need to do
Draco pressed his lips tight, the colour bleaching out of them. He took a steadying breath before saying, “The day that the three of you were dragged into the manor. You’re all the most important people in my life now, and I didn’t have the courage to do what I should have to keep you safe then.”
Malfoy let his hand brush gently against Harry’s where it dangled limply at his side. “We never even talked about doing anything else with it.”
With a doubtful nod, she turned around and wove past Narcissa towards the back of the dining room. Draco held his head high and didn’t so much as glance towards his mother again. Harry, in between feeling proud of Draco, took the time to glare at her some more on the way. When they reached the table, he made sure to pick the seat that had a view of Narcissa, though she appeared to be paying her bill and leaving.
Not a good idea?! In what possible way could taking a step to get their relationship back to what it was meant to be, be anything less than a phenomenal idea? Especially when it felt like
“Yes, well it was frustrating me,” Draco grumbled. “What if this is the key to figuring this out and I can’t fucking remember the connection?”
“Narcissa Malfoy, then? I’ve heard she and her son are estranged.”
“Nah,” Harry looked up blushing. “It feels really right, you know?”
“We haven’t,” Draco clarified. “We fought sometimes. You make me want to rip out my hair, or maybe yours, not infrequently. It took a lot of work, to get to know one another. To figure out where our boundaries are and how to talk through problems with one another. I imagine we’ll keep figuring it out for a long time yet. But we’re both committed to working through them, and every time we fight we learn more about how to be better partners to one another. That’s what matters. We’re fighting
“You could stay,” Harry blurted on impulse. Malfoy whipped his head up to look at Harry in astonishment.
“I’m not allowed to leave my home without an escort approved by them.”
Niamh watched Harry, head titled to the side, considering.  “You look good.”
“Not we,” Malfoy said regretfully. “Just me. You didn’t ever know about it.”
Harry bit his lip, but nodded to encourage Draco to carry on.
One that wasn’t wholly terrible informed:
for the Aurors posted at the door. There is a
“What the fuck? Where am I?” Harry now risked a good look around, wincing as the stiff muscles along his neck resisted the movement. Definitely a hospital. Hopefully actually St. Mungo’s and not some secret hospital run by the Malfoys where they got up to no doubt nefarious things.
was there for some utterly inexplicable reason. Harry, uncaring of the glasses that hovered above him, turned his head to catch sight of the man. He was grasping the door frame tightly.
“No,” Harry replied firmly. “I’ve got feelings for you. I mean,” he shot Draco a wry smile, “they’re terribly confusing feelings. But they’re not bad feelings. And they’re there.”
“I’ll- I’ll open it,” Harry said, “Maybe you could get some tea for us?”
The answer to that became clear as George both raised his brows and pulled his mouth into an apologetic smile.
“The last I remember was like five months after the war. Every Death Eater and their families had it out for me, I’m sure.”
The eye roll Draco gave him looked put-on, as though he felt obliged to pretend he wasn’t pleased to hear that. Then a sweet smile broke free and he wrapped his arm around Harry’s waist so they could climb the stairs together. Gandalf, who’d been asleep under the table woofed in indignation that he’d been left behind, and skittered to catch up.
“Harry,” she asks in her calm and controlled voice, “what was the date?”
“Oh…” Harry’s voice caught.
“Yup.”
Harry leaned towards the pensieve and studied the shimmering substance inside. It swirled in that strange not-quite-a-gas but not-quite-liquid way.
“I’ve got the organizing under control,” Hermione reassured her.
“Astoria, I’m not sure if you’ve ever met Harry. Harry, this is Astoria,” Draco said.
Harry shook his head apologetically. “That, er, wasn’t quite the right word. But this is taking a toll on you. It’s not worth it just to try and get revenge on whoever hurt me.”
“Blue, light, winter sky blue,” Draco replied promptly. “Yours?”
Malfoy rushed to Harry’s side and tried unsuccessfully to yank him to his feet. “Potter, get up! Potter!” He ground his teeth, “Come on, Harry. I know you can do these, so get it together and
“So, floo or side along, Harry?” Ron asked.
He held his hands up in surrender when both Harry and Draco glared at him.
He froze in the middle of waving an emphatic hand towards his essay, realizing he’d pushed a button. Draco had gone completely rigid, and cast his eyes towards the floor, a curtain of his hair blocking his expression from Harry.
Harry thought sarcastically as he braced himself for Draco’s anger.
“Oh, my boys,” Molly said with a tearful smile.
“He wants one of us to push him from each direction,” Malfoy explained apologetically.
With a realization that felt like an anchor pulling Harry into the depths of the Atlantic he said, “Draco… I know that I asked you not to give up.” Harry swallowed thickly, “But if this is too hard, I – I’d understand.”
“I didn’t ask
“Sixteen months,” Harry filled in bitterly.
Draco shrugged, “The case is going cold. It makes sense to talk to me again.”
Harry met his friend’s eyes pleadingly. A cowardly part of him wanted to say no. No, he absolutely did not. He wanted to pretend he’d never lost his memory and just go on as if he didn’t miss a beat. To go home to his warm flat with the twinkling string lights and the photos of his friends. Never mind that he
Niamh jabbed a finger at Harry, “Lots of rest. No more memories for the rest of the week. I will see you in my clinic Monday at nine a.m. and we can discuss whether you may return to reviewing memories any time in the foreseeable future.
Rolling his eyes, Draco conceded. “Alright, but we are not spending all night dissecting our relationship.”
Flustered, Draco said, “Ron and Hermione’ll be over any moment. They’re going to help us go through that list of Azkaban guards.”
“I mean, he drives me mad sometimes. Often.”
When he woke, it was to sound of Malfoy greeting Dudley genially and the smell of pizza. Harry cast a general freshening charm on himself and changed into new clothes before following the delicious scent down into the kitchen. Three large pizzas were laid out on the table between the two men who were bantering.
“Your bedroom,” Hermione noted.
A serious-faced middle aged man regarded Harry where he lay in his hospital bed. Harry had begged the Mungo’s staff to let him do this in a board room or something, but then he’d gone and gotten light headed walking to the bathroom and if they’d ever been considering it, they’d instantly changed their minds. Stuck in bed like this, dressed in easy-open hospital issue robes with Auror Longeman towering over him, Harry felt ridiculously pathetic.
go up to the max of four next week if he continued to do well.
“Yes.” Harry heard a shifting noise before Hermione continued, “But Draco, just for now. I don’t think it is a good idea to just- just
Maybe this was different though? This time Draco was missing something he hadn’t had the opportunity to miss before.
Lifting his head away from his hands, Draco looked up at Harry with a wrinkled nose. “Suppose I handled that poorly?”
“I think,” Harry said, tightening his grip on Draco’s arms just slightly, “I’m coming to know who you really are. You’re clever and determined. You’ve got a soft spot the size of the UK for animals and kids. And you are not going to be a terrible Auror. You’re going to be a brilliant one.”
“Thought you were meant to be at training all day,” Harry said, trying for a casual tone.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Draco rake his hands down his face. He took a moment to collect his thoughts before he replied, “No. In retrospect, it’s surprising that it took you this long to do it. You’ve always been an impatient git.”
So Harry took up his position behind Teddy and pushed the swing back and forth to Malfoy, trying to avoid meeting his sparkling grey eyes.
“Careful with that,” she looked over her glasses at him.
“What?” Harry exclaimed, feeling as though his heart had dropped into his abdomen. “I meant it.”
Most recently, Draco had found him out on the steps to the back garden, watching the gnomes play a violent version of tag. It had taken quite a lot to convince Draco that he was fine and in fact, it was Ginny, holding two mugs of tea and informing Draco neither were for him and that he’d do best to go back and finish his debate with George about the use of powdered chrysanthemum in potions, that did it.
Draco raised his brows at Harry, then dumped the first memory into the pensieve and gestured to him as though it were an open door, “After you.”
“It’s trash,” Hermione declared in her most no nonsense voice.
“Alright,” Harry said. “She’s leaving anyways. But… you know that it’s okay if you’re upset. You don’t have to like, keep a mask on for me.”
“Ridiculous,” Draco grumbled scanning the empty bar room. “Not a one of them is even here yet.” He pitched his voice lower and leaned into Harry as they headed towards a large, circular booth in the back “We could still be in bed. Naked."
“Good,” Professor McGonagall said in a final tone. “Then I expect you’ll be getting back to your NEWTs as soon as you feel up for it. I’ll ensure that the first weeks’ course work is sent along to you later today.”
“Hey!” Harry pulled back with a frown, “Was it that bad?”
Malfoy tipped the vial into the pensieve. “Yes,” he said tensely. “Whenever you’re ready, then. I’ll be right behind you.”
“Fuck,” Draco hissed. “I’m sorry, Harry.”
Once Niamh had floo-ed away, Draco pulled out a chair and sat next to Harry.
“Harry,” he repeated, looking as though he may be at a loss for words.
Harry wasn’t so certain that Draco revisiting memories of the year Voldemort was an unwanted guest in the Manor, like an insidious pest infesting the home, was fine. Changing tact he asked, “Does that work? If you’ve forgotten would it still be there to view or would it have slipped from your memory altogether?”
“That’s not good,” Harry muttered to himself as he watched the scene. “Can’t believe I got taken by surprise like that.”
Niamh laughed, “Sure. Same thing, though. If you’re getting headaches take it easy. The screen will make it worse.”
“Yes ma’am,” Harry agreed, looking to Malfoy for the first time since they’d entered the castle. He had a small, pleased smile and his eyes were crinkled at the corners.
don’t want to?”
Draco groaned deeply, “I’m sorry, Pans. I didn’t mean to ruin your date. I wasn’t thinking at all, suppose I’d hoped you wouldn’t even notice.”
“As you told it later, I’d poured too much power into the talisman and fell unconscious. The dementors went for me. Your patronus drove them off.” Draco siphoned the memory out of the pensieve and back into its vial, replacing it with a memory labelled in Molly’s purple. “It’ll pick up here.”
Malfoy winced delicately, “I think that the instructions from the healers were to stay away from bright lights and screens, actually. Come to think, that must be why Ron didn’t show it to you to begin with.”
“So…” Malfoy ventured as he began to crack eggs. “You seemed like you hadn’t seen the study this morning.”
The next room over was largely empty, with the exception of a punching bag dangling towards the right side of the room, a pile of padded mats, and a series of targets hanging at various heights around the walls.
But he couldn’t answer the question right away. After all, he had an array of traumatic experiences to choose from.
The healers had put Harry back to sleep after delivering the news. As he faded off, he remembered Niamh saying that Healer Cunningham needed to be the one to deliver the news to Harry’s partner. The last of Harry’s consciousness was spent on wondering who she meant by that. He must have joined the Aurors after all. He wondered who his partner was.
“Good hunting?” Harry asked, pleased when Oscar landed on his shoulder and nuzzled him affectionately.
“What do you like to do for fun?” Harry asked (the third on a long list of questions he’d drawn up after his appointment that morning).
Maybe the Weasley’s were acting especially parental to ensure that Harry knew they were here to support him as he recovered?
was accompanied by a picture of Malfoy kissing Harry sweetly on the cheek.
They carried on in a silence that, at least, felt more companionable than the silence that stretched out between their past-selves walking just ahead.
Squealing with excitement, Teddy nearly lunged out of Andromeda’s arms towards Draco, who scooped him up and pressed a smacking kiss to the top of his head.
Finally he managed, “I appreciate it.”
The next morning, Harry was trying to scrawl some finishing touches on his essay before sending it off to Hogwarts with Oscar when Draco walked into the kitchen.
The kettle slowly worked its way up to a boil as Harry watched drowsily.
“United front,” Harry said firmly.
“They’d been going away, before,” Draco said, frowning. “Have you told Healer Brady? You should.”
Moonlight filtered into the hallway as Harry tiptoed down it, not wanting to wake Malfoy in his room across the way. He was headed for the kitchen and a strong mug of tea to push away the nightmare he’d just woken from.
Ron? I could’ve spent all week in front of a telly and instead I was moping around the drawing room?”
“Morning, Harry.”
“Fuck that, right? How dare anyone feel badly for you!”
? Harry thinks again, bewildered and miserable.
And settled for a surly, “I wanted to go
This was just irritating. Why couldn’t she tell him what the actual bleeding fuck was going on? “Harry James Potter. July 31, 1980.”
Then came the anger. Draco’s drooping shoulders straightened in affront and he glowered at Harry. “Revenge? You think this is about revenge? Bloody fucking Hades, Harry. This is about being
It was Harry who broke the lightheartedness of it, after they’d finished their dinner on a park bench and began to head back towards Grimmauld. Harry figured Draco was letting him take it at his own pace, and he was running out ideas for the light and easy stuff.
Every nerve in Harry’s body was crackling with electricity. He’d never felt this way, and it made him regret how long he’d taken to do this. He wound his hand into Draco’s hair and flicked his tongue along the bottom of Draco’s lips until they parted and he could tangle their tongues together.
just watched his two allotted memories for the day.
“Wait,” Harry said. He’d been standing quietly by watching as Pansy bustled in to manage Malfoy with a positively Hermione-esque demeanor. “
They fell into silence for a little while, watching as the gnome that was “it” beat the living daylights out of the smaller gnome it had managed to catch up to.
“Harry…” Draco’s hesitant voice spoke behind him, Harry turned to properly look at him. “Do you – Do you think maybe I could accompany you to the healer’s appointment?”
Harry wavered on this. That sounded truly wonderful, but the possibility of finally beginning to remember the time he’d lost was pulling at him. Though, Harry supposed, he wasn’t supposed to begin on the memories until evening time anyways. He glanced at Malfoy who raised his brows encouragingly. “Yeah,” Harry said finally, “That sounds great. See you in a bit, then.”
“And Head Auror Parker specifically recruited Draco, so that means something,” Ron added in a bolstering tone.
This was enough to cause Harry’s gaze to shoot back up to Draco. “
“I’ve just got two more that I think I need to review and then I’ll have it.”
Nodding, Harry took a deep breath to push away his emotion. “Do you know where George’s damned sound orb prototype thingy is?”
“Thank you Kreacher.”
Harry couldn’t understand how the Dudley in question could possibly be Dudley Dursley, but he’d also never met another Dudley.
They lapsed into silence again while they finished up their meals. Once Harry was done, Malfoy jumped to his feet and asked, “Ready to walk around the house?”
“Alright, what is your favourite meal?”
“Want some tea?” Harry asked, turning to the stove to begin fixing some.
Ron beamed, “Brilliant!”
Squeezing Draco’s hand, Harry replied, “Don’t worry, I knew you’d feel that way. I went right from home to the hospital to Andromeda’s and then back home today by floo. I’ll make sure I’ve got someone with me if I’m not just going between safe places.”
“Did you know that you’ve a Chocolate Frog card now?"
Harry sat on the front hall bench until he felt cramped and cold. He moved up to his bed, where he watched the fire that Kreacher had set until it died down. When he gave up on sleep and checked the time, it was only just past four o’clock.
“Yes.” Niamh said. The way her lips pursed reminded him of McGonagall. “It does seem as though you’ve binged on memories until you passed out, doesn’t it? Luckily your vitals are all fine. And when I say luckily, I don’t mean it lightly. You may have nine-lives Potter, but you’re down another one today.”
son-in-law,” came Hermione’s amused voice from behind Harry. A rush of warm air left the house along with her as she came to stand with them.
“I bought this, for next week.” Malfoy replied, voicing another thought which seemed rather disjointed to Harry. “It’s our anniversary, in a way… I thought… Might have been too soon, anyways.”
Harry slipped out of his side of the booth and onto Draco’s, though it wasn’t meant to fit more than one person. After a quick glance around (only because he figured that Draco wouldn’t be keen if there were onlookers) he wrapped one arm around Draco’s shoulders and his other around Draco’s head, so he could guide his head down onto his shoulder. Harry pressed a firm kiss to Draco’s temple and let his lips linger there.
Harry didn’t even have the chance to turn back to the door before he found himself wrapped tightly in Malfoy’s arms with a mouthful of long, loose blonde hair.
He settled himself cautiously while Niamh pulled out her wand.
Harry’s eyes filled with tears and he looked hopelessly at Andromeda. She gave him a compassionate smile and ran her hand up and down his shin. If this was February, Teddy was nearly two years old.
Shuffling out of his room, he studied the closed door opposite his in the hallway. He held his hand up to knock on the door, before deciding that he wouldn’t want to wake Malfoy if he had managed to sleep. Instead he turned the knob and cracked the door open. Gandalf was lying on the end of the bed, by Malfoy’s feet. He lifted his head just slightly and thumped his tail lazily in acknowledgement of Harry’s presence.
“There wasn’t anything in the weeks before your attack that made us worry, so whoever did it was careful to avoid suspicion if they were casing out the right opportunity.”
Snatching another photograph off the wall to toss to the ground, Harry ignored the sound of the door closing behind her.
“Well, best get to it.”
“Alright,” Harry shrugged. Malfoy probably had all sorts of irascible moods that had no rhyme or reason to them. “You pick, then.”
Nodding with satisfaction, Niamh guided Harry’s head back down to the pillow and continued to hover in his line of sight.
“Draco?”
George diverted smoothly. “Wanna play a game of exploding snap?”
Malfoy gave him a weak smile and continued, “I’m sorry for letting the Death Eaters into Hogwarts. For being a coward and not doing the right thing during the war over and over. For not doing more when you and Hermione and Ron were dragged into the Manor. I’m sorry for a lot, Harry. I hope you can forgive me.”
! Rie talk snake!”
“Yes,” Draco’s tone became mocking. “Did you think all the Aurors do is stare out at the street to make sure no one meaning you ill blatantly comes and knocks down your front door? They’ve got all sorts of charms to monitor who enters and exits the home, Harry. There’s a battalion of them out looking for you right now!”
Ron’s gangling figure caught Harry’s eye, “There’s Ron,” he nudged Hermione with a grin.
Nausea twisted up Harry’s throat, “
Clearing his throat once more, Draco asked, “So your parents have been in the continent?”
Malfoy sat heavily onto the pine bench that rested against the wall. Gandalf immediately hopped into his lap and washed his face with slobber. Malfoy ignored this, instead saying morosely, “I’m sorry. I just needed to see you.”
“Oh really?” Harry leaned forward across the desk towards Draco, suppressing a grin. “Like what?”
It was just as Harry had last seen it, though a bit cleaner. Coloured in Gryffindor red and gold, and plastered with posters. When he breathed in deeply he thought he could even catch a lingering smell of firewood that reminded him painfully of his godfather. Above the bureau next to the door, the sole change in the room caught Harry’s eye. Between two panes of glass the torn photograph of Harry as a toddler, riding his very first broom stick, hovered. He reached out to nudge it with his finger and the frame obligingly turned around to show the page of his mother’s letter that had gone along with the photograph.
Reaching back over his shoulder, Harry rubbed at the infernal bump on his back. He’d first noticed the spot yesterday, but today it was so much worse that when he’d swiped his loofa over it in the shower it had hurt. With a wave of his wand, he defogged the mirror, then twisted awkwardly so he could get a view of what he was dealing with.
“I know,” Hermione replied. Harry wished he could see her warm brown eyes.
“Missed you, Teddy.” It was close enough, Harry figured.
Harry couldn’t hold back the laugh that barked out of him.
“Harry – Ron, Ginny, or I would all happily go for a run with you. Between the three of us I’m sure you could go for a run every day.”
Being on the receiving end of so much sincerity from the man he only remembered as a spiteful boy was too much for Harry.
Harry stretched his lips into something between a sad smile and an uncomfortable grimace, “Don’t worry about it.”
“So you’re planning some vigilante justice?” Harry asked, interest peaked.
Niamh knocked on the door and glancing quickly at Harry’s expression, said, “Auror Longeman, I’m terribly sorry but we’ll need you to leave now, I’ve some treatment to do with Mr. Potter.”
It was when Malfoy’s shoulders visibly slumped that Harry realized if he stuck his foot any further into his mouth he’d need surgery to remove it.
“Draco’s not my only son-in-law,” Arthur protested. “There’s Percy’s fellow. Ray?”
Harry scowled at him, knowing that Draco was just teasing. “My favourite meal is Molly’s roast with the rosemary potatoes. Yours?”
“She had this… persuasion about her, too. I think that’s the only way she managed with my father for so long. There’s a legend that there’s some Veela blood in the Black line, way, way back. Maybe it was some of that. She could nearly always talk some of the nastier Death Eaters out of harassing me when they were looking for a bit of fun.” Draco took a shuddering breath. “She was my safe place. And she threw me out.”
Watching himself fight with Draco like he’d done, all because Draco had put himself in danger, made Harry’s heart constrict. He’d always worried about his friends, of course. He hated that any of them were ever in danger simply because of how some prophecy and a madman had steered Harry’s life. But he couldn’t say he’d ever felt so passionately against one of them putting themselves in that position. Now, at least, he could understand why Draco was so upset with him when he’d gone out for that run just days after the reckless memory binge.
“Harry,” Draco shook his head slowly, his eyes piercing Harry, “I’ve not said this because I’ve worried it would be too much for you, but I love you. It would take a hell of a lot more than some forgotten sore spots for me to ever even think of walking away from you.”
to take care of me,” Harry growled.
“Yes,” she smiled gently. “To Ron.”
though, haven’t you?” She ignored him as she slid into the booth.
“St. Mungo’s.” She just told him that, of course he knows. Merlin.
How he could feel both so overwhelming embarrassed and yet also feel completely safe in discussing this topic honestly, was beyond Harry. “Probably the top, to begin with. But… I’m definitely interested in the other way around too.”
At this, Malfoy laughed in a way that warmed Harry. “No.”
he bellowed.
“Breakfast for dinner. That’s your favourite, isn’t it?” Malfoy turned, grey eyes searching Harry’s worriedly.
“Stop it, you know a blush looks horrid on me,” Malfoy said in a tone that Harry suspected was meant to be irritable but which came across as self-conscious instead. Harry remembered Malfoy blushing about his favourite film and thought that he had looked far from horrid.
“Oscar
“Oh God, no. He’d be livid with me. Please don’t even tell her.” Harry shuddered to think of Draco’s response to having Pansy called on him. “But I don’t know what to say to him. It’s seriously worrying me.”
“Of course, why wouldn’t I be? I mean, you gave me a bit of a fright…”
A series of whines, which were becoming increasingly impatient woke Harry the next morning. He glanced over at Draco who’d pulled the pillow over his head to block the sunrise at some point. His breath was slow and heavy and Harry was glad he was getting some proper sleep. Molly had tutted and fussed over Draco all evening and, apparently having decided that Harry himself was sufficiently recovered, chided Harry for not taking better care of Draco’s health.
“Grand,” Niamh said before turning to Ron who was rushing down the hall looking harried. She pointed an accusing finger his way, “You keep yourself calm around him!”
“I’m that worried.”
Draco spent every free moment the next two days in the pensieve. He’d eat dinner with Harry, get caught up on the memories Harry had watched during the day, then they’d go out for a post dinner stroll with Gandalf and Oscar, but every moment of it all had an undercurrent of anticipation. Draco was itching to dive into his own memories. As he dipped his face into the pensieve again and again, Harry would watch him apprehensively over his charms homework. When Harry deemed it was late enough in the evening he would coax Draco to come up to bed.
“True stories, apparently. Just not
“Certainly not, Mr. Potter. I fear you’ve both misunderstood me. Regardless, the DMLE does not have bottomless funds to monitor your home, and we believe you will be quite safe without the Auror detail.”
“Nope. Even went for a run. And got shouted at. Not even the tiniest headache.” Harry said this with some degree of pride for his own resiliency.
Suddenly smoke began to billow up to the rooftop, setting Gandalf off into high pitched yips while Oscar fled the room with an irritable screech.
“Yup.” Harry ran his fingers through the soft pile of the rug. “We’ll find whoever did this. We will.”
Thanks for any kudos and comments - they are much appreciated! Stay safe everyone :)
Dread wound its way through Harry’s vital organs.
With a serious nod, Longeman continued, “With the memories that you do have, who do you know that may have wanted to hurt you?”
“So this is shite, hey?”
With stress, Draco became rigid and unyielding, while Harry became sarcastic and lazy. They’d bicker, hide in different parts of the house for a while, and then pretend nothing had ever happened.
Harry leant over to Hermione and whispered, “What. Is. Happening.”
Draco smiled, the corners of his eyes wrinkling, “So did you watch your daily allocation?”
Niamh hummed as she offered Harry a couple of potion vials, “I can see why that would frustrate you. But also…”
Malfoy smiled sadly and continued, “It wasn’t at all fair of me. Don’t worry about what we talked about. I understand you weren’t in the right state of mind.”
“As I’m gonna be,” Harry said.
“Hey, Niamh,” Harry said cheerfully, pointing to the medical bench, “Want me up there?”
“Ron and Hermione, I think. But I’m sure she’ll be around too.”
Once finished with the memory, Harry looked wistfully at the full case. He headed over to the fireplace to floo Andromeda and ask for a visit. She and Teddy popped out into the kitchen a few moments later with a platter piled high with pancakes and kept him successfully busy for the morning. By the time they’d gone back home at half noon, Harry was exhausted. He collapsed into bed for a few solid hours of sleep.
Scrubbing at his neck, Harry said, “Yes, well, I’ve seen enough to get reoriented. Some things are more important to me at this point in time. Like your sanity.”
Hermione passed Harry a warm cup of tea. He hadn’t even noticed she’d been out of the room. “I’ve been keeping him up to date on how you’re doing,” she shared gently.
“Yeah,” he answered sheepishly.
“Master Harry,” Kreacher appeared with a pop, nodding his head formally. “I is wanting to welcome you home.”
“That’s alright,” Malfoy said graciously, plastering on a smile. “If you truly mean it, I would be pleased to accompany you.”
“I need to head off to my seminar in a few,” Malfoy said, pulling Harry out of his reminiscing. “But I wondered about having Dudley over for dinner? He’s been asking.”
“Missed it on the grand tour the other day. I’ll show you,” Malfoy promised, guiding Harry back across the attic.
Draco turned to Harry, a question in his eyes. When Harry shrugged Draco turned back to Astoria and accepted her offer. She guided them into a back room where some plush chairs sat outside of a series of dressing stalls.
“Cab, please.”
“Thanks,” she beamed. “I can’t deny I’m feeling quite good about it.”
“Yeah,” Harry sighed heavily. “Suppose that makes sense.”
Harry rolled his eyes and began to walk again. “When you were little, what did you want to do when you grew up?”
Harry dropped the sheets back onto the table and pulled Hermione’s schedule towards him. She’d left a note on the bottom, suggesting he work on one subject at a time as he could do anything he wanted at whatever pace he’d like when it came to coursework, and he had the option to write his NEWTS one by one if he’d like; there were scheduled sittings every other month through the Ministry’s educational department. Hermione had scheduled him in to focus first on Potions.
“Maybe not, but it’s just part of the deal when you’re in a relationship.”
“Oh.” Harry stared at Malfoy, willing him to look up and meet his eyes. As though magnetically drawn, Malfoy slowly turned to look at Harry, cheeks flushing pink. The sunlight caught in his hair, setting it aglow. “Why would you do that?”
“I’ll make something,” Draco offered. “Come on.”
True to form, Molly took great care of Harry throughout the day. She ensured that he took the potions left by Niamh on time and, to Harry’s great embarrassment, helped him walk to the toilet when he needed it. Thankfully, Harry slept for much of the day and felt a fair bit better by late afternoon.
Harry thought about denying that there was anything, but George fixed him with a knowing look and added, “You’ve been heaving these ridiculous sighs every two minutes since you got here.”
“Glad to hear it. Draco,” Niamh added softly, “You can sit on that chair right next to Harry if you’d like.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hallo Teddy,” he grinned, then walked over to Harry so that the squirming toddler could crane his neck and sloppily kiss Harry’s cheek.
“I told
It didn’t quite turn out how Harry had imagined.
George sighed dramatically, “Not everything is about you, Malfoy.”
Annalise was less restrained than her counterpart at the front door and kissed the both of them on each cheek. “I am glad to see you well, ‘Arry,” she gushed. “Et Draco, J'espère que tu vas bien aussi.”
On landing back in their own, well-lit version of Grimmauld’s kitchen, Draco looked uncomfortable.
An exasperated huff of air escaped Draco. “You’ve been silencing yourself? That explains it. You don’t need to apologize Harry. We are well practiced in dealing with one another’s nightmares.”
“Let’s talk Gandalf for a walk,” Harry suggested.
“No,” Draco decreed, turning his back to Harry and Hermione and tilting his chin down as though he were a bull ready to gut Ron. The lines of his shoulders were tense. “You do not get to do this. You do not get to spring this on us. You absolutely do
Draco beamed at him as he sipped on his tea. “It’s perfect, thank you Harry.”
Harry returned, feeling just as good as he’d known he would, an hour later. Kreacher’s panicked face met him as soon as his feet landed in the garden.
Harry shook his head and took a deep breath before saying, “Thank you both, really. But I’m good now.”
Harry, now acutely aware of all the people staring at them and filled with a certain knowledge that this would be in tomorrow’s Prophet, turned to glare at Ron himself. “That really was a cunty thing to do, you know.”
“Well you’re the one who put dinner off for this game of yours.”
He actually hadn’t been sure if he’d still be able to, now that the part of Voldemort that he carried was gone. He was oddly pleased to hear that he still could. Doubly so if it entertained his godson.
“Hermione thought you should start with your least favourite. She reasoned that it’ll take the most effort, so you ought to get it out of the way.”
Harry hummed his agreement. He thought about asking George to tell him more about what he knew of it, then decided he wasn’t ready for all that yet. Instead he said, “Tell me about your life.”
“I could’ve done so much more. Hermione…”
Harry nodded at the finger that was waving threateningly in his face. “Yes ma’am.”
Longeman raised a greying brow. “Well, there was Narcissa Malfoy, but you seemed to think that unlikely.”
“Mate, the lunch rush starts in a half hour, so you oughta talk about whatever it is now,” George said casually, as he straightened out the display of love potions.
A stir-fry was sizzling away on the stove when Draco and Ron walked into the kitchen. Harry turned around to greet them with a smile, which immediately faltered.
“How is it, Harry, that you haven’t noticed this tattoo in the last two weeks?” Malfoy asked drolly.
now! Death Eaters followed Harry back here shortly after Voldemort’s coup of the Ministry!”
“So… they’re really friends, then?”
“Good,” Ginny said with such conviction that Harry found the courage to look up at her. “He’s good for you.”
“I’ll give you my answer if you want,” Draco offered, waiting for Harry to nod before he continued. “My happiest memory is a day that we just lounged around home together. I’d never really felt at home, anywhere. At the Manor I always had to be so careful, so clean and proper. And then, of course, we had some unsavoury houseguests. And I spent a lot of my time at Hogwarts hiding a huge part of myself. The first time I ever really felt at home was with you. And not,” Draco shot him a rueful smile, “just at Grimmauld once we’d done it up how we wanted. But at that dumpy little flat before. I think I’d feel at home anywhere so long as it was with you.”
Harry remained still for a few more moments, until Hermione called him out. When he opened his eyes to see her, he was pleased to find he could open both eyes this time. And overall, he hurt quite a lot less. Nonetheless, he was grateful when Hermione offered him a pain potion, explaining that the healer had left it for him to take on waking.
With a squeeze of his arm, she nodded and walked away.
Draco favoured him with a weary smile. “Are you hungry?”
Malfoy obviously agreed because he stood and said solemnly, “That would be nice, Kreacher.”
Draco focused on his tea, pale lashes hiding his eyes. “I’m afraid that every interaction between us, before, needed to happen in just that way… every conversation, every event, in order for you to have feelings for me. I’m afraid I am going to muck everything up. And my tendency is to put up walls to protect myself. I- I don’t want to do that with you, but Merlin,” he raked a hand through his hair, “it’s hard.”
Clenching his jaw, Harry shook his head. He went to fix tea for Draco and tried his best to get his anger under control before he sat back down to offer it to him. Gandalf had made his way into Draco’s lap and had curled there contentedly, which seemed to have relaxed Draco a little.
“Like everything you ate each day and every other human, dog, and squirrel you and Gandalf ran into on your walks.”
- you must be a Slytherin graduate- right? Harry pondered this thought giddily, feeling so tired, even though he had just woken from a three day coma.
Unsure whether to feel relieved or upset at this revelation, something in Harry’s chest twisted awkwardly.
Without a thought, Harry pressed Draco against the wall and grasped his face, kissing him forcefully. Draco gasped, and for the briefest of moments Harry thought he might pull away. And then he was kissing him back, wrapping his arms around Harry’s body, pulling him closer, closer.
But all the same, he couldn’t seem to keep himself from having little rows with Draco over the stupidest things. One afternoon, while helping George out at the shop as an excuse to get out of the house, Harry vented about it all.
“I do!” Harry said fiercely, feeling as though that time, at least, he sounded certain.
Malfoy reached to shake  Niamh’s hand once more, “Thank you for your time, Healer Brady,”
He stood up and walked over to the stove. “Let me help?” When Malfoy hesitated Harry grabbed the pan from his hand. “Come on, I’m sick of people waiting on me.”
Harry took the plate Malfoy offered him wordlessly, reminding himself that this was not an alternate universe. He took a slice of each, and was rewarded with an approving look by Malfoy. His appetite
Why had the Aurors assigned this arse to Harry’s case? From what Ron had told him, Longeman had been close with Scrimgeour before his death (which didn’t recommend him to Harry), but had carried along as normal following the Ministry coup (further damaging Harry’s opinion of the man). He was considered to be a very letter-of-the-law officer, which Harry well knew did not align with morally strong.
“Okay,” Malfoy smiled softly. He looked so very different than Harry had ever known him, ruffled from sleep, with his expression wide open. “I’ll stay.”
“That sounds nice,” Harry said. And he meant it, too. He was almost a little jealous to hear it, though that was the last way he wanted to feel.
It wasn’t until he’d flipped through his mental catalogue to the end of their sixth year of school that Harry remembered feeling anything more than hate towards Malfoy. After he’d (sort of) accidentally cursed Malfoy Harry had felt a tremendous amount of guilt. He’d gone under his invisibility cloak to see Malfoy in the hospital wing in the middle of the night.  He’d been caught out very quickly and ended up having an actual conversation with the other boy. And he’d walked away from it with something that felt a lot like understanding. After that, what stood out for Harry was reluctance. Malfoy’s reluctance to kill Dumbledore. His reluctance to give up Harry, Ron, and Hermione at Malfoy Manor. His reluctance to attack Harry in the Room of Requirement (and his arms wrapped tightly around Harry’s waist, but probably the only reason
Backing away from the bed Harry lay in, Malfoy called out urgently for a healer. Harry couldn’t see them, but they must have been just outside the door because he could pick up on the concerned tone of their murmurs.
“Harry,” he said voice raspy, “how are you?”
Niamh nodded, pleased.
Harry, who was truly in too much pain to deal with anything else, grunted his assent. With a cool hand at the back of his neck, Niamh supported him to drink the potion, which tasted like mint and licorice and rapidly soothed the pain from its previously violent thumping to more of a dull thrumming.
“Does he seem familiar?” Ron asked hopefully.
“Best way to deal with the attention is to just push through. It only gets worse if I avoid it. Besides, we’re already all set for Ron to meet us at Harvest, right? So put on your cloak and let’s go.” Harry stood and looked from Gandalf to Oscar apologetically, “Sorry, you’re not invited.”
God. Did he really have to be honest and vulnerable with
Harry slunk his way into the examination room. Before Niamh could utter what was clearly coming his way, given the unimpressed look on her face, Harry said, “I’m sorry. Really.”
“Great. Right then, Harry. You’re free to go. I’ve got you scheduled in for Monday,  instead of Tuesday, as I’ve got some surgical spells booked for that day. Ten o’clock if that’s alright.”
Featuring Draco! (At least a little, I promise he'll get more screen time soon!)
“To be honest,” Draco gave him a rueful smile. “I had to really scrape my memory for it. I was such a self-absorbed snob. It wasn’t until you told me I’d insulted Hagrid that I remembered it properly.”
“I packed it up,” Harry said, holding his chin up defiantly. “We’re going to bring it back to McGonagall.”
He grinned cheekily.
“I was summoned back by Auror Belmore,” Draco said coolly.
When Harry didn’t reply to Draco’s encouraging nod, he jabbed him in the ribs and demanded Harry be out with it already.
Harry woke to the morning sun filtering into his room and Molly sitting quietly next to him knitting. He’d fallen asleep in the middle of George telling him about his new girlfriend; he’d never caught her name.
Numbly, Harry allowed everyone to cater to him. He figured it made them all feel a little better about the situation, as if they had some control, and he didn’t want them all to feel as badly as he did.
This Malfoy was different than the one Harry could remember. This Malfoy was playful, easy to smile. He was still quick, and a little sharp, but caring, too. Harry wondered if this Malfoy had always been there, or if he’d changed over the year and a half that Harry had forgotten. If there were changes, had Harry noticed them happening while they’d been working together on the dementor problem? He must have, Harry mused, because
When their appetizer arrived, Harry shifted back to his own seat and had to ask Draco how to eat the oysters that were resting between them on the table.
And all the while Harry was slowly making his way through the rest of the lost memories. He’d now reviewed the aftermath of the failed attempt to trap the dementors (a fight resulting in them avoiding one another for several days, Draco showing up distraught on his doorstep due to the damned Prophet article, another fight about going back on patrols again, and a bit of a fight and subsequent make-up with Ron as well), and a brief Christmastime interaction with Ginny that, in retrospect, made it clear she knew their relationship was coming to an end soon, though his past-self didn’t seem to know it yet.
With a gentle smile, Malfoy said, “Good. I’d rather it not be. It tends to be quite inaccurate.”
Pansy grimaced as she turned back to Harry. “I’m sorry, Harry. He wanted to give you some time and then tell you about it.” She gave him an assessing look. “How are you doing? Your head’s not aching so much anymore?”
“Nope.” Harry picked up the sheet with the Death Eater’s family names and nibbled on his lip.
Smiling sympathetically, Malfoy remained silent.
“Erm… It wasn’t quite as bad as it sounds, I don’t think.”
Draco bent down to ruffle the puppy’s fur and received a broad lick across the face. Harry couldn’t help but smile at that. This game was going rather well so far.
Sorry for such a late update, been busy hand-making Christmas gifts to make up for holiday gatherings being cancelled due to COVID's second wave in my part of the world. Happy New Year everyone, I hope you're all safe and well!
“You a muggleborn?” Harry asked. She’d sworn like a muggle.
Malfoy frowned delicately, “Dudley, don’t talk with your mouth full.”
Eyes flitting up to Harry’s, Draco smiled sadly, “No?”
“Hmm.” Malfoy turned his attention to whisking the eggs. Without looking at Harry he asked, “Why’s that?”
remember feeling rather miserable in that life, with all his friends back at Hogwarts and the weight of the war dragging on him.
“There’s also the matter of the dementors targeting you last year,” Draco continued. “It might be connected. We never really figured out anything about it, we were so focused on the dementors right in front of us.”
“She sweet talked that old wizard Henry who works in records on the weekend,” Ron cut in.
A spike of anxiety shot through Harry’s chest. “Well, er. Yeah. I figured. I mean, if you want to.”
“You came out on Valentine’s day,” he explained softly. “To everyone that mattered, really. And then you showed up at the Manor with this whole blarney speech.”
“Uh, thanks,” Harry nodded before catching sight of the pensieve and case that still sat on the table. “Can we watch the next memory or are you going to make me wait a full 24 hours first?”
“I snuck past a rather frightening nurse to get in here after hours,” he whispered. “Bloke looked like a bouncer. Shove over, then.
“I’m so sorry, love.” She leaned forward and pressed a kiss to his forehead, before carding her hand through his hair as he fought off the prickling of tears and a tumult of emotions.
“Hermione and I are working on getting together as many memories as possible,” Malfoy offered.
“Erm…” Harry rubbed the back of his neck. “Of course. Hermione and Molly have been here every day.”
“Of course, Headmistress,” Malfoy said gravely.
“Oh, Harry! Hello.”
“Me too. And something about the air during autumn…”
Harry jumped and whirled around, “Oh, morning M-” He cut himself off uneasily.
“Harry, I’m so sorry. It seems that your memory loss is not just a temporary loss from your concussion. You’ve been obliviated.”
Once again, Harry found himself speechless. He reached for Draco’s hand and gave it a squeeze as Draco had done for him earlier. He didn’t let go the rest of the walk home. He was well on his way to understanding just what Draco meant.
Relieved, Draco picked back up with his gentle stroking of Harry’s hair. “I’ll separate out anything that I feel you should see. And Harry? Really, no rush. I’m more than happy with the ways things are between us right now.”
“Fine. Honestly. The noise hasn’t been too much or anything.” Harry scraped his thumb up and down the side of his mug for a minute before asking. “Is Draco still looking?”
“What, no, I- what?” Malfoy blustered, turning a deep shade of pink.
Kicking his feet, Teddy shrieked with false alarm punctuated with delighted laughter.
“Mhm,” Harry nodded, glancing up at Draco with exasperation. On their last appointment together, Niamh had insisted Harry complete one more week of a single memory a day before considering increasing them once more. He supposed Draco was worried that with Harry’s next appointment being just a couple of days away now, he might be tempted to up his memory dose without prior approval. “Good morning, Draco. Tea’s steeping for you.”
“Or me,” Draco nodded. “A lot of people hate me, but most of them hate me for allegedly bewitching you, so I don’t think they’d be all that likely to attack you in response. There’s certainly a few people who might fit the profile of hating us both, though.”
“I’d go with Charms, maybe, if I were you,” Malfoy said hesitantly. When Harry gestured for him to continue, he explained, “You’re naturally quite good at it and it will keep your interest, so it might be a more enjoyable start. I’d suggest DADA, but it might be a better idea to wait until you’re entirely free of post-concussion symptoms so that you can give that one your all.”
“Sounds great,” Malfoy stood from the table. “Let’s make up some tea and toast and we can eat in front of the telly.”
“And,” Harry continued, “I’ve made that clear to Longeman. I will continue to make it clear. I am fighting for you.”
“Draco got his shit together, after that. The two of you have been in a proper relationship since last April, living together for most of it. You renovated Grimmauld Place and moved in there in July. Draco’s in the Auror training program with Ron. You’ve been working on completing your NEWT level courses.”
“I saw the Prophet, this morning,” Malfoy said.
Malfoy whirled around, pulling his wand out and dispersing the smoke. He lifted a pan off the burner and studied it before vanishing its contents with a heavy sigh.
“Only one memory today, Harry.”
Harry was so fixated on him he didn’t even think to glance towards the real time Malfoy standing at his side. The third dementor, which had turned to watch Malfoy, began to move slowly towards him. Harry had seen them move terribly quickly before and something about the way this one moved made Harry think it wasn’t too concerned that Malfoy would be a threat.
Harry approached the desk and scanned over the papers Draco had been studying. One was a list of Death Eaters and their relations. Another had notes about the location the attack had occurred at (a nearby muggle park) and the time (late evening).
The piercing whistle of the kettle cut between them.
She turned to Ron and Harry, who both shrugged.
Clucking her tongue, Niamh waved Harry to sit on the table. “You should be. Gave us both a terrible fright. I wasn’t kidding – you could’ve damaged your brain permanently.”
“Right. Studying for my NEWTS.”
Draco demonstrated by shooting one back himself, then, with a saucy look remarked, “They’re aphrodisiacs.”
“Everything alright, Harry?” Hermione asked softly from her place on the couch opposite him.
Longeman stood from his chair when they walked into the room. “Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy.”
He realized immediately that it didn’t hold what he was looking for. But what it did hold was far more interesting. Harry reached in and pulled out several of the papers that laid on top. The chest was meticulously organized, the piles within were neatly aligned and they appeared to be organized by date. He laid those he’d pulled out on the floor around him in a semi-circle.
Chuckling darkly, George replied, “No, but that’s a brilliant idea. Thanks, mate.”
“I hate to say it mate, but do you think your mother could have had anything to do with it?”
As George suggests, at some point this story will become a little more explicit. It won't be largely smutty, so the rating will stay at just mature, but for anyone coming over from Shameful Company you can expect more than that story and its teen rating.
They settled into the sitting room and accepted tea fixed by Kreacher. Harry wished that Molly hadn’t felt the most proper thing for her to do was hide in the kitchen. She was over to help make sure he got on well enough again today, even though he felt much better. Molly could’ve taken Longeman down a peg himself, Harry figured.
“He upset you?”
While Harry wasn’t always the lead story of the papers surrounding him, he and Malfoy, or one or the other of them, were featured on every single front page. Swallowing the knot in his throat, Harry turned back to the chest and drew out the rest of the papers, loosely piling them up so that the oldest were now at the top of those that surrounded him on the floor.
“Oscar,” Malfoy replied wryly, “Will do whatever he wants. But I suppose it’d be a good idea to give Harry a heads up about that. And I’ve briefed Kreacher on everything and what the next couple of weeks might look like at home.”
Harry narrowed his eyes, ignoring that his right eye still stung with the movement. “Why the bloody hell would I do that?”
Harry ignored her, and wandered towards the refrigerator. Stuck to its gleaming surface was a colouring page of a Hippogriff filled with rainbow scribbles and signed in Dromeda’s neat cursive
He woke late again the next morning and gulped back a glass of water followed by one of the vials of headache potion that Niamh had sent home with him. It was with relief that he heard the sound of Hermione’s voice from the bottom of the stairs as he headed down.
The most upsetting visit was from Andromeda and Teddy. Teddy, against his grandmum’s protests, ran into Harry’s room and clambered up onto the bed. He patted Harry’s face gently and with a look of great concern.
The second memory wrenched at his heart as well as he was met with Draco’s tear-reddened eyes following a visit with what remained of his father, the sentence of a dementor’s kiss having been carried out months previously. Harry felt a rush of pride in himself when his past-self didn’t drop it and leave as the other boy asked, but opened the door for them to share more of themselves, to let their emotions be what they are.
Falling asleep that night was a challenge. Malfoy had left the bathroom on the same floor of their bedrooms for Harry to use, and had gathered what he needed to take a shower upstairs. Apparently Kreacher had gone off to Pansy’s to collect all of Draco’s belongings earlier in the day. Harry brushed his teeth quickly, sprayed a lavender mist from Hermione liberally over his bed and then flopped down, burying his face into his pillow  and trying to pretend he couldn’t hear the shower running above him. Trying not to think about the fact that he and Draco Malfoy were living together, which was weird. Trying not to think about how Draco Malfoy was
I'm working to pull the plot of this story in order so I can post more frequently, but will aim for about every two weeks atm.
“It’s overkill,” he grumbled to Niamh’s back as she walked out of the room.
Harry frowned at that. “What if something had happened and I didn’t tell you about it?”
“I’m not stupid, Malfoy!” Harry snapped.
Harry watched Malfoy from the past make peace with Wallburga black’s portrait and laughed a little at the look of surprise on his own face. He watched both versions of Draco look apprehensive as past-Harry released the boggart and stood back to let Draco give it a go. With some discomfort, he watched as his past-self needed to step in. As they stood facing off over a bar of chocolate. And as, over some tea (a well-timed offer from Kreacher- so
“Could you just… come here?” Harry asked in a small voice.
have ruined my alcohol tolerance.”
Harry wanted to ask about the tea, but decided that at this point it might be better to let Malfoy sleep it off a little, rather than blunder drunkenly through the awkward conversation coming their way.
Ron clapped his hand onto Harry’s other shoulder and gave it a brief squeeze. “Let’s go, mate.”
The charms textbook stared at him, accusingly. Harry had already fallen behind on his study schedule, the calendar was flashing an angry red colour (Hermione had updated it with his charms assignments). And he
“Who is that actor?” Harry asked casually.
Draco hummed thoughtfully, “Do you wish you’d tried for professional?”
“Around this time last year, Harry, you and Ginny ended your relationship.” Harry felt a loss at hearing this. Ginny. Bright, beautiful Ginny. That small grief was nothing compared to the feelings that overtook him when Hermione said, “And you came out as gay.”
you had nothing to do with the attack, okay?”
. It was true. It was real. They had been in love. Are they in love? Malfoy must be, Harry understood, remembering the pain in his voice at St. Mungo’s that first day.
“Come on,” Harry chided gently. “Yesterday was such a nice break, let’s keep it going just for the rest of the weekend. One more day won’t really matter at this point, will it?”
Harry frowned, grasping for the memories. “Er… I remember it was Tuesday, I think. Drizzly and cold, but I left my flat and went out for a walk.”
Over the next hours, the rest of the Weasleys (and Pansy) arrived and they all crowded around the dining table together, talking over one another. Draco, who was sat at the far end of table from Harry, caught his eye and quirked a brow up, silently checking in. Harry nodded, to let him know that he was alright. And he was. Or, he would be.
Shaking her head resignedly, Niamh replied, “You’re something else, Potter. I suppose you want to know about starting memories again?”
“Harry,” Draco repeated reluctantly, “I have to go to training.”
“Well, Harry. That depends on your results. And how you’ve been feeling – no lying.”
Harry snorted, “How’d you two come to get along so well anyways?”
“It’s like a game to get to know each other better. It was Niamh’s idea, really. Credit where its due and all. But we each ask each other questions and then we have to answer that same question ourselves. I know it’ll be a bit odd because you’ll already know most of my answers, but pretend you don’t, just for the sake of, you know, getting to know one another again.”
“It’s just ridiculous. He loses his mind entirely if I’ve left a jumper over the armchair in the drawing room.” Harry threw a container of Poltergeist Putty into a storage bin too hard and it popped open. The green putty sprang out of the container and attached itself to his face.
Once they reached the top of the stairs, Malfoy turned to Harry and said, “Now you’ve seen the study you know everything on the main floor. Theoretically we were meant to share the study, but you seem to prefer to spread out all over the dining table so I’m really the only one who uses it. Though,” Malfoy added, pulling open the door and pointing at a small stand against the wall just inside, “this is where you keep your books and notes when I insist you clear some space to actually eat.”
was one of the first questions he asked after waking with a large amount of memory loss. Probably rude, too.
Harry nodded, “It should be you.” Malfoy favoured Harry with a small smile. “Have you ever used a pensieve before?”
They stayed to chat with Astoria for a while. As they were gathering up their cloaks to head back into the cold winter air, Draco squeezed in one last question.
“Nothing?” Ron asked with his face scrunched up dubiously. Hermione glared at her fiancé.
“Interesting,” Harry said. “We’ve been talking, you know. But it’s still so awkward. Like… how do you even begin to move past this? I need to get to know him all over again, but he knows all these things about me that I don’t even know I’ve told him. We’re on such uneven footing. And then he’s worried that I won’t like him anymore. I dunno. It’s messed up. If I can catch up on the memories a bit quicker, it would help, I think.”
Just as quickly as his anger flared, it died. Draco looked so distraught, that Harry wrapped his arms firmly around him and pressed a kiss to the side of his head.
Pansy and Neville had both begun to sniff around the pureblood society looking for any rumours about who might have been behind the attack, but nothing had turned up. Harry hadn’t yet bothered to request another meeting with Longeman, but he was getting rather impatient for the Auror to provide him with an update as he’d so kindly reassured Harry he would.
” Ron snapped glaring at her impropriety. “Don’t be rude.”
He looked so discouraged that Harry added, “Plus, I don’t want to miss a single second of having you in bed with me.”
“Draco?” Harry asked, rubbing the back of his neck. “When… when did you start to have feelings for me?”
“Seriously,” Harry insisted. “Also, if you were worried that I might not be gay anymore without my memories – I definitely am.”
“Drawing. But that’s not usually considered a proper past time for a young wizard.”
? Ire bubbled up within him and, with just as much impulsive determination as he’d had when he’d pushed Draco against that wall, Harry stormed down the stairs to find the blonde git.
“Your owl.”
! Don’t we deserve to feel safe?”
“Well, thanks,” Malfoy mumbled.
“1998.”
Draco frowned. “A… what?”
“He’s taken the healer’s instructions to give you some space very seriously, but it’s been hard for him… I think Ron was just trying to help. Which is not to say he isn’t a complete moron.”
“No, Mr. Potter, I’m not kidding.”
“Yeah, yeah.” Biting his lip firmly to keep himself from getting too emotional (he’d had quite enough crying already this week thank-you-very-much) Harry replied, “this is really nice. I’m glad to see it’s been left.”
“Well,” he blinked a few times, clearing his vision. “That was interesting! Sort of fun, even?”
Biting down on a shy smile, Draco hesitated, “I… yes. That would be nice.”
(See the end of the chapter for
and a photograph that showed Malfoy pulling Harry in for kiss as they entered a formal ball hosted by the Ministry, Harry smiling up at Malfoy dazedly as he pulled away.
Draco looked surprised to see him hovering awkwardly by the umbrella stand, his brows lifting. Then he smiled softly, “Hey.”
“That’s a good idea,” Malfoy said solemnly. “Take it easy.”
Draco wrenched his lips away from Harry and pushed at his shoulders, panting. “Harry,” he said with a look of regret.
Draco’s grin widened as Harry placed a hand on his lower back to guide him ahead through the doorway. Once through, he fell back into step with Harry so they could climb the gilded and candlelit stairwell together. Leaning towards Harry, he whispered in a pleased voice, “Encantado’s?”
Laughing gently, Malfoy stood and pulled Harry up with him. He flicked his wand and sent the papers flying back into the chest. “Pretty sure that you put it in the hidden closet.”
Delighted, Harry noted that the kiss seemed to be enough for Draco’s cock to strain against his trousers again. He ran his hand teasingly down its length before reaching to unbutton the trousers.
Harry was about to remind Andromeda that he didn’t have the floo, before it occurred to him that he was the one in need of reminding. His stomach clenched again.
The man sighed heavily and sat at the kitchen table.
He did find it unlikely. Frustratingly, though, he and Draco hadn’t really been able to come up with anyone that fit the “may want to hurt the both of them” categorization who was any more likely than anyone else to have assaulted Harry. The best they could come up with was the Greengrasses wanting vengeance after Draco reneged on their marriage agreement, but Draco felt it was rather a stretch for the pureblood family, known for its moderacy, to go after the Saviour of the Wizarding World. All the same, they’d decided to make a visit to Astoria Greengrass soon.
Looking back to the table where a dozen vials rolled askew, Harry remembered with a sudden rush just what he’d done. He clutched at his temples as confusing memories flooded his mind.
He took great pleasure in the blush that tinged Draco’s cheeks.
“Two-thirty rather than two-o’clock is
Draco huffed a quiet laugh through his nose. “I don’t know. Maybe before you decided you’d made such a terrible mistake in being with me you staged everything just to rid yourself of memories of me."
He would have liked to have said that he didn’t need a babysitter. But Harry both didn’t have the ground to stand on after yesterday, and literally could not stand. When he tried, he fell back onto the bed, awash in nausea and vertigo.
Draco hummed slightly in response, not moving his despondent gaze from the fire. He had a hand resting on Gandalf who was curled up in his lap, and he didn’t appear to be taking any notice of Oscar tugging the tie in his hair until strands came loose.
Harry kissed Draco intently before replying. “Niamh said I can go up to three memories, so that’s brilliant.”
“And everyone’s looking at me with all this bloody pity.”
Pulling the dusty curtain back, Harry craned his neck to catch a glance of the Auror on duty at the front door. It was Zinnia Belmore. That was good; while she was nice enough, he didn’t feel as though it would be a total betrayal to pull one over on her. If Diggle were on duty he wouldn’t have been able to go through with his impulse.
“If you think that’s an insult, Harry, you’re dead wrong,” Malfoy said with a fleeting smile before he bit on his lip and frowned for a moment. “Alright, fine. If you’re feeling alright, you can do the next memory. But don’t think you can sweet talk me into more.”
Harry trailed away in the face of Draco’s ferocious expression.
Harry sipped at his tea, thinking over the tidbits that George had told him that night in the hospital. “You seem really happy.”
Harry ignored him, feeling sick as he kept his eyes on the unwell Draco of the past. “Why the fuck didn’t we go to Mungo’s? You clearly needed to be brought to Mungo’s.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The idea of teaching was so much more appealing to him than the idea of being an Auror had ever been.
Molly choked back a whimper and squeezed him even closer. “I’m honoured to be given even a fraction of space next to your mother in your heart,” she whispered into his ear.
Clearing his throat nervously, Draco took a step forward. “Astoria,” he greeted formally, bowing his head towards her. “I’m sorry to intrude.”
Draco’s eyes popped wide, “What is it with you and believing I think you’re stupid? I don’t think you’re stupid, Harry! I think you’re an arrogant, stubborn, ARSE though, with no regard for your own wellbeing. First you fry your brain because you decide that the healer’s orders don’t matter and then you can’t even wait four damned days before this?”
“I’m ok, mate,” Harry said, running a hand through Teddy’s wild turquoise hair.
With a kiss to Draco’s cool cheek, Harry asked, “Let’s try and forget about this for a bit, try and unwind before we head to sleep, yeah?”
More importantly, even, was what Draco had said to him last week. He was worried that Harry wouldn’t fall in love with him again if Harry didn’t experience all of their interactions the same way.
With a gentle sigh, she said, “I know, Harry.”
“Harry? Are you alright?” He asked, his tone as tense as his shoulders.
Harry twisted to see the moon-faced bird and gave him a pet, “Hullo, mate.”
Harry shook his head, watching the coppery bird shrink from view into the grey sky.
the beginning of your apology campaign. Very touching stuff,” he ended teasingly.
She crossed her arms and raised her brows, “I absolutely have. You spent most of yesterday trying to overexert yourself. As I was saying, three days rest. Then you can progress to spending an hour or two out of the house at a time, getting some fresh air and what not. Memory wise, don’t try to overload yourself. Get a few stories here and there. Once we’ve checked in with you next week, we will see how you’re doing. If progress is good you can start reviewing other peoples’ memories of shared experiences in a pensieve. Best to do that in chronological order, so it might take some organizing. We’ll talk more about that later, alright?
Harry gnawed on his lip for a moment before conceding, “Alright.”
A slight smile lifted Draco’s lips and Harry felt thoroughly successful. “Lockhart? Really? That buffoon?”
She wrapped Harry tightly in a hug and, reminded of his first night home when he’d cried in her arms, he felt emotion tangle in his throat. Since Draco had been back, Harry knew she was trying to give them some space to sort things out, so he hadn’t seen her in a while. After some of the difficult conversations that he and Draco had begun to breach and the day spent raking through lists of possible enemies trying to find ones that would have sufficient motivation to want to hurt both Harry and Draco, Harry desperately needed some maternal comfort.
“Had to get up and leave the handsome man I woke up with this morning behind in bed,” Draco said wryly. “But other than that, it was alright, I suppose. Yours?”
A noise of amusement from behind him caused Harry to turn to Malfoy, who was clearly trying to tamp down a smirk.
“Love it,” Draco replied solemnly.
Sighing heavily Draco said, “No, Harry. You don’t remember
“Yes, a real nap,” Harry jabbed his chin into Draco’s shoulder. “You look absolutely wasted. But if you happen to have any good dreams, I’m sure I’d be happy to carry them into real life when you wake up…”
And then, there was his hair. Malfoy either left it down, accentuating his collar bones at it brushed gently against them, or tied it into a knot at the back of his head, which highlighted his jawline and long neck. And his piercings - something about them drove Harry wild. The hoop in his eyebrow would glint when he raised his brow and smirked at Harry in a way that was definitely more flirtatious than any of the smirks Harry could remember seeing on Malfoy before. Several times now Malfoy had given him such a look and then quickly withdrawn, shyness overtaking his features. Harry found that just as attractive, strangely endearing. Twice as often as that, Malfoy would open his mouth to say something and clearly think better of it, leaving his lips slightly ajar in a way that left Harry wondering how it would have felt if Malfoy
“As soon as this evening, if you don’t experience anything worse than a mild headache between now and then. You need to view them in chronological order, we don’t want to scramble up your brain any more than it already has been, alright?”
They weren’t anywhere near figuring it out though. They’d found nothing but signs of someone disillusioned from the surveillance video footage which Ron had (somewhat furtively) acquired. The wavy outline of the disillusioned person was in alignment with what the Aurors said – Harry had been hit from behind by someone taller than himself by at least several inches. The cameras hadn’t caught any witnesses for them to track down.
Head aching with the effort of thinking his way through it all, Harry heaved a sigh and closed his eyes. He tried to calculate the number of months he was missing before giving up altogether and dimly sorting his way through his different senses. The room he was in smelled astringent, with hints of mint. His mouth was dry, stale. The cotton blanket pulled up over his waist was lightweight and heavily starched. He only had a moment to regret turning his attention to how his body felt before the healers returned.
They carried on like that for a while, batting superficial questions back and forth. Favourite song, funniest embarrassing memory (Pansy had once caught Draco dancing through his dorm in pajamas whilst singing a Celestina Warbeck tune into his hairbrush).
“Never thought I’d hear a Malfoy apologize,” Harry teased half-heartedly.
When they had their plates together they sat across from each other at the table and ate in silence for a while. The awkwardness was back again. It wasn’t like Harry had expected it to just dissipate because they’d had a couple of not-terrible conversations and a bit of a laugh, but how long would it linger? It made his stomach squirm and his brain flustered.
“Potions. Or – don’t laugh- I did rather enjoy History of Magic.”
Harry fumed.
Ron tried to grab his wrist as he ran past, “Harry! Harry for Merlin’s sake, it was an accident. We were training!
“Hullo,” Harry said, shaking off his nerves and wrapping Draco in his arms. He took a moment to breath him in before asking, “How was your day?”
“Oh please, you sound more prudish than Hermione.”
“I…”  Harry started to say that he did forgive Malfoy. But the other young man looked at him frankly, warning him not to lie. He settled on, “I’ll get there,” instead. Somehow, he didn’t think it would take him all that long, actually.
“Oh,” Harry blinked. “Uhm, sure. How do, uh… we get a hold of him?”
“That spell helped me survive fifth year,” Malfoy confessed.
Harry scanned his eyes over the room for a long moment, letting this settle in. “Merlin this is so weird.”
Malfoy let his eyes roam over Harry’s face carefully, as though wanting to know how he was feeling, but (correctly) deeming that he’d have his own head bit off if he had the nerve to ask.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You alright?” Harry asked, coming to sit next to Draco.
Harry perched himself on the edge of Malfoy’s bed. Once he’d done it he realized that perhaps he shouldn’t have, and tensed. Malfoy didn’t seem to mind too terribly though, so Harry stayed where he was and said quietly, “I didn’t mean to wake you up. Just couldn’t sleep myself.”
“Watching that will do you no good,” a wry voice said behind him.
“We planned for tonight before the reunion happened,” Draco said frowning.
It was all so intriguing. How did they manage to destroy the dementors? And how did they work through everything from their past to get to where they would’ve been now, if Harry’s memories hadn’t been stolen? Watching the beginnings of it excited Harry. It reminded him of renting the first series of the X-Files the July following the war in an attempt to distract himself from the noise of his own brain. He’d rushed through every episode and then gone right out to rent the next series. There was a terrible urge to rush through all of his memories to see just what happened. He was cheering for their success and he noticed his heart swoop a little each time his and Draco’s past-selves made progress with one another.
Nodding solemnly, Harry explained, “He went around erasing people’s memories to make himself famous. He stole their lives. I doubt he was particularly discriminate about what memories he took, either. I bet some of them lost their memories of people they cared about, too. It impacts so many more people than the intended victim.”
. Draco…”
Draco emerged with a wry grin, “Call me that again Weaselette, and you’ll wish you never introduced me to the bat-boogey hex.”
He knew as soon as the words were out of his mouth that he was way, way out of line. In fact, the accusation hardly even made sense. But his blood was boiling in a way he hadn’t felt in years.
Harry’s eyes immediately landed on Draco, he studied his face intently, looking for the little cracks in his demeanor. His mouth pulled down at the corner just a little and his eyes were like dark tunnels. He didn’t even respond to Gandalf as the puppy tried to climb his way up Draco’s leg for attention.
For fuck’s sake. “There’s a hidden closet?”
Something in Harry’s demeanor tipped Malfoy off. “He’s awake,” he informed Hermione. “Will you ask if he’d like me to take Gandalf or if he’d rather have him at home when he goes back?”
Harry and Malfoy both saw Dudley to the door. Once he’d left (after squeezing in another story about something embarrassing one of his mates had done at a pub last Friday) Malfoy turned to Harry.
Harry flopped his head back onto the couch and stared at the roof. “Alright…”
“And?” Harry prompted.
“Wonderful. All I want is your style approval.”
After taking a moment to jot down Harry’s results, Niamh said, “You can go up to two memories a day for the next four days. Then, if you’re still feeling good, you can do three. I don’t think we can push any higher than four memories a day at any point in time though, so don’t get too excited. It will still take a good while to catch yourself up.”
Thanks for reading :) Like some of you, I too, am getting impatient for them to kiss! So I thought I'd post this chapter early to get us a little bit closer to that moment. I do love a good slow burn though ;P Just like I love reading your comments, so thank you <3
“You know, relieve all that tangible sexual tension that’s always hovering in the air between the two of you.”
Ron chose that moment to helpfully pipe in, “I swear I saw red when Hermione opened the paper that morning.”
Once back at Grimmauld, they headed their separate ways to complete homework.
A Valentine's Day update (sorry this chapter was a bit more angst than romance!) Thanks for reading, I'd delight in any feedback/comments :)
Hermione smirked, “Don’t let Percy hear you saying that. They’ve been on one date, Arthur.”
Cupping Harry’s face between his hands, Draco kissed Harry deeply. “I’m all yours, love.”
“Thanks, Harry. It’s just hard. The proper investigation is clearly going nowhere. We’re not doing any better. And…” Draco’s mouth twisted and Harry knew he was fighting off tears.
“No, I’d prefer Draco to be here.”
It was immediately followed by
“I understand,” Harry tightened his arms around Draco. “We do deserve to feel safe, you’re right. And I do want to bring whoever did this to justice. But
“I certainly could,” Draco insisted, pulling back to study her. “Your hair looks phenomenal.”
“That’s wonderful, that is!” Hagrid exclaimed. “Well, if you’re not too eager to head straight home and begin that, once you’ve been to see Minerva you oughta come down to mine for some tea.”
“Morning, you,” he greeted with a gentle smile as Draco blinked at him. “How did you sleep?”
Finally he managed to pull together some words. “I just… I keep hurting you. I notice you covering up your reaction whenever I say the wrong thing, you know. And just… we’ve clearly been getting on one another’s nerves lately.”
He walked over to Draco and grabbed him gently by the shoulders, “Sit,” he instructed, guiding him into a chair. He was trembling slightly.
There was only the briefest of moments for Harry to revel in delight at the news.
“No,” Ron reached out to grab his shoulder. “Trust me, don’t.” When Harry eased himself back into his chair, Ron added, “I’d better ask or Draco’ll be angry – how are you feeling?”
“I mean,” Harry turned to Pansy and stumbled onwards when the intensity in Malfoy’s eyes became too much, “If you were on a date… It’s late. He could stay in one of the spare rooms. I’m in a spare at the moment, too. In the morning,” Harry turned back to Draco, “we could talk a bit?”
Once they were back at their kitchen table, Harry chuckled ruefully. “You weren’t kidding about how you dealt with the awkwardness of things.”
They both looked awful. Harry was slumped against a wall, trembling violently, with Draco in his arms. Draco looked disturbingly close to dead. Greyed and slack in his unconscious state. Without thinking about it, Harry reached out to grasp the present-Draco’s hand next to him. Draco intertwined their fingers and held on tightly.
offices otherwise.”
“I did?” Harry asked baffled.
The lights on the ward had been dimmed and Harry was lying flat in bed, staring blearily at the roof. He’d tried to sleep. He was certainly tired and the pain potions made his limbs feel as if they were dead weight. But his mind kept cycling around the fact that he was missing well over a year of his life. What do you even do with that knowledge? Ought he to go around tracking down any details he could find? Should he just pretend it never happened? That might be hard given that he was in a long term relationship. Living with Draco Malfoy, an owl, and a puppy.
Harry did laugh. History of Magic would have been boring even if it were taught by someone with some range in their tone of voice. “Mine was DADA, obviously. Well, at least the content. The only year I ever truly enjoyed the class was when Lupin taught it.”
“Yeah, I can go up to two memories, then three after a few days. I’m recovering well, she said.”
Draco craned his neck down the street as they walked, but the edges appeared fuzzy in the memory. “I wish she’d caught sight of the damned photographer,” he grumbled.
“I’m realizing that most of my thoughts haven’t changed,” Harry replied, with a meaningful look. After a moment of tension which elicited wolf-whistles from George and Pansy on the other side of the box, Harry ventured, “So Ginny said neither of us have ever missed one of her games?”
“A tattoo,” now that his panic was determined to be unfounded, Malfoy sounded as though he was holding back amusement.
“Why am I not in Auror training with you?” Harry asked nervously. Had he not been good enough after all? Maybe he’d fallen deeper and deeper into his grief after the war.
An hour later (Harry had insisted they eat a proper meal before getting in to it) Draco jabbed his finger onto a name.
At this, Harry needed to sit on the bench next to Malfoy. Last he remembered interacting with Parkinson, she’d suggested that he be handed over to Voldemort.
Harry nodded and Hermione ran her thumb across the back of his hand as she began to tell him the story of his life.
“I’m sorry, mate,” he said, looking grim and serious. “But hey,” he brightened a little, “I made a mess of this last time, so now I get a second chance.”
“Hmpf.”
“The crup puppy you adopted at Christmas time.”
Harry snorted and Malfoy ignored him.
“Yeah,” Draco whispered, angrily swiping at a tear trailing down the side of his nose. “Lockhart really did that? Why isn’t that common knowledge?”
“When can I start to review memories?” Harry ignored her.
Hermione, clearing the table of the remains of takeaway curry Ron had brought home as a peace gesture, raised her brows at him.
It was soon followed by a blurry face which hovered above him. Between his swollen eye and his lack of glasses, Harry couldn’t make out any distinguishing features. Hands moved up to hover hesitantly by Harry’s jaw line, as though their owner wanted to hold his face, but was concerned about causing him more pain. Harry was grateful for the caution, he was quite certain even the gentlest touch would be incredibly painful at the moment. Merlin, what a state he must have been in if this was how he felt even
Hermione’s quiet voice brought a rush of relief to him. The other voice took Harry a moment longer to pinpoint. It was male, but delicate, prim and proper.
“Afraid?” Harry couldn’t imagine whatever of.
“Then I’m happy for you.”
For a moment there, he’d wanted to ask Draco to crawl into bed with him. To lay down next to him so Harry could touch him and feel his warmth and know that he was alive and well. Chess was probably a better choice for now.
“Fuck it,” he muttered, pulling out the next vial.
Pulling back a little, Draco studied Harry under furrowed brows. “You’re that worried?”
“Dudley,” Harry said flatly.
Harry
“For fuck’s sake Harry, there is a
“Aw shucks,” Ginny rolled her eyes and knocked her shoulder against Harry’s. “So how are you feeling, really? I can see Draco peeking through the window.”
“How’d you become proper friends with him?”
A drawling voice asked, “Have what?” and the four of them turned to see Pansy, bright red lips pulled into a terribly amused smirk.
Catching sight of the clock on the wall opposite the desk, Harry said, “It’s two in the morning, what on earth are you doing?”
