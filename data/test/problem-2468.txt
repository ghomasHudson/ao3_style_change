In all of twenty seconds, Harry finds Malfoy’s name.
He pads over to the window, feet hitting the cold and hard wood with soft plods. The curtains have not been opened once in all the time he has been sleeping here, as he understands. The fabric is moth-bitten and musty; a cream colour with heavy drawstring ropes that hang lifelessly. Sirius would have hated them, with their haughty sense of importance in both the grandeur and scale, he knows. Along the hemline, there are chunky tassels which swing threateningly when he goes to open the curtains. He meets resistance as he tries to tug them across the rail with all the strength left in his weakened body, which is admittedly not a lot.
Gradually, he comes to a slow stop. There is a weird energy in the air, and he swears he can hear a faint tinkling sound ringing in the back of his head. The clouds seem to hang lower here, pressing down on him.
“I don’t need to prove myself to anyone, especially you,” spits Malfoy, “Potter.”
Indignant, Ron storms off, the loose strands of hair on his body forming a trail behind him. The sun shines down at them, seemingly chuckling too, and his freckled scalp gleams as the rays hit him. Harry didn’t think it possible, but he and Hermione laugh even harder at this, bending over to catch their breath.
Harry feels like he has missed an important chunk of the conversation.
“I think that you being in a room with her is gonna encourage your Ravenclaw side, ‘Mione, and I’m bloody terrified.” teases Ron from beside her on the floor’s cushions. A fire crackles behind them and for a second, Harry could mistake it for being third year, the three of them discussing the mundane normalities of their homework and school life by the Gryffindor fireplace, Ron still deep in his awkward crush phase on Hermione. The one that lasted until earlier this year, curse them both.
“Whatever you say,” he finally looks at Harry, the cold and hard film over his gaze reminiscent of the trial, and that split second where he had turned to Harry amongst all the formalities. As he had then, now, Harry silently begs for him to break the eye contact- it’s too intense, too full of emotions that Harry cannot read. Thankfully, Malfoy grants his wish and he turns away, “I will be sleeping now, Potter.” And at that, he waves his wand, which Harry notices is different from the one he had owned throughout Hogwarts, and the curtains are spelled shut. For several beats, Harry just stares at the bed-frame, before aggressively pulling the duvet up around him and lying down, irked, on the sheets.
They walk through the street a little further at this but Harry finds he cannot keep his attention on the journey, and he stumbles. He can feel that his feet are growing clumsier by the second, something that happens when his body stops wanting to cooperate. Hermione grasps his arm again and this helps steady him. One thing he attempts is holding a focus point in his vision, and just not looking away from it. Using an upcoming picketed fence, it works for a minute or two and he feels a swell of pride. Until, he reaches a particularly bumpy part of the road and wobbles drastically, losing balance. He has to stop in fear of twisting his ankle.
“It’s complicated,” says Harry, as minimally as possible. However, his mouth betrays him, continuing to move on a motor, even in spite of his will for the opposite. “I suppose I’m just not really right for it anymore, Professor.” He hasn’t said much, if anything at all. The fear that it is still too revealing is loud. The idea that Mcgonagall, the reliable and steady woman that she is- has always been- could come to be disconcerted by him-
Harry shakes his head, feeling intrigued by the abandoned ones, “I think I’m gonna have a look at these.”
“Harry, if I get Malfoy in my dorm, please make sure my funeral is dignified. And that everyone cries loads. I want to know that I'm missed when I'm watching from up there. Also, tell Hermione she cannot date my brothers.” says Ron earnestly. He gulps and pats Harry’s shoulder before inching forward with all the bravery one would expect to find in a  Gryffindor. Unlike Harry, who knows he needs to move in order to find out his fate, but doesn't do anything to help accommodate this. Instead, he just stands frozen, like a deer in the headlights, rendered unable to spur his limbs into action. The idea that he could be sleeping, in close proximity, with complete strangers in the immediate future, as in tonight for Merlin’s sake, sends his mind into a wild hysteria.
One time, he takes his satchel with him on an exceptionally blowy day. He bears it well for around twenty minutes, but when the wind causes his eyes to sting with tears, Harry seeks refuge.
In his mind’s eye, he envisages a peaceful scene, where he and Ron and Hermione cook dinner together after a draining day at work. Perhaps he will have a partner of his own, who holds his hand as he stirs the pot, and who teases him when the meal ultimately goes tits up. He no longer fears losing himself, and therefore doesn’t fear losing them either. It is a tender image- and he wants it so fucking
Could it be Malfoy? Some part of him thinks it is undoubtedly so- the part which has been watching his every move, full of suspicion, full of distrust. The other part, the bit whose heart skipped in excitement when the boy spoke softly about tea, which felt the warmth of Malfoy’s humanity and the beginning of peace as they leaned over the railings at the Astronomy Tower together, says otherwise. He doesn’t know which to believe. One lives deep in their past, one in their future.
“Hey, Harry,” cheeps Neville joyfully as Justin nods to him with smiling crinkled eyes, a sandwich in his mouth. Hannah greets him with a warm expression and gestures for him to sit down next to her. He does so uncomfortably, but Hannah doesn’t seem to mind and just shuffles up to make more room for him. She has the kind of quiet and trustworthy smile that dispels all of your tension, fading all the aches and pressures- until you are just left with a tender happiness fluttering around your body. Her button nose wiggles and she clasps his knee quickly, addressing his arrival; he thinks contentedly that she is perfect in every way for Neville.
“Harry? Is that you?” says a female voice, high and breathy. After a moment, he realises that it is Erin. He hadn’t even considered that she might ring him, this wasn’t something he had prepared for. He feels caught off guard, but rolls with it. She just has that aura of ease which transcends space, reaches him even over however many miles they have between them.
“Maybe you could come with us next year, Harry,” says Hermione kindly from across the table.
- takes priority.
helloooo hope this okay :) sorry if the pace seems at all slow but this will be a slow burner (because they are the best duh) and i want to explore everything in detail. this story will eventually become something over than just an eighth year story (hint hint: running away) so keep with me ;)
“Oh, Padma told me. Apparently she, Parvarti and Lavender come here on Tuesdays to have tea with her,” Hermione replies, “It was quite long I think, or at least that is what Padma told me. I have to say, I would be intrigued to know what he had to say.” Harry hums in agreement, mind racing. If Rosmerta got a letter, it is extremely likely that others did too; he wonders who.
“She does. Skele Gro is still probably the worst thing I’ve consumed to this date,” jokes Harry flatly, “Tastes like a House Elf’s rags.”
Either way, Malfoy’s attempts to hide himself from the rest of them are futile. Harry doesn’t need to see him physically as a mess to know that he isn’t quite right. He is erratic, yet subdued. Changed. Harry hates it. Something is up. Whether it is just the widespread trauma, ever so popular at the moment thanks to an especially evil Dark Lord, or something deeper, is a mystery to Harry.
“I dunno what you want me to do, mate! Why don’t you try an Evanesco?”
He would have never thought it to be Malfoy’s style. Credit given where credit is due, and the Slytherin has always been a fighter, tenacious and unrelenting. Perhaps the issue started when Mcgonagall then went and took the Slytherin away when she eradicated houses for the eighth years. It certainly made Harry feel a little stripped of identity, though he no longer relies on Gryffindor when searching for reasons to be prideful.
It reads:
Then, Malfoy whips his head around and says bluntly, “If you are sick again, I’m leaving,” and Harry temporarily forgets all about secrets and mystery.
Harry shakes his head in disbelief, “Professor, I would respectfully argue that there are probably a million other people better suited to being an Auror before me. You know as well as I do that me and paperwork would be a bad idea.”
“Anyways, you’re not fine either,” he states honestly. Malfoy looks affronted, and Harry shakes himself again. He needs to be at his premium; the other boy could leave at any moment and Harry would just be gaping like a fish out of water. “You’re not! Otherwise you wouldn’t be lurking up here for the second night in a row. Hypocrite.”
The cogs in his mind still only just processing the fact that he is being asked to get out of bed, Harry snaps, rather unfairly, “Yes alright, Ron! I get it. Can you just give me a second?”
“Everyone talks about how hard it is for Muggleborns in the Wizarding world, but nobody ever mentions what it is like once you get home!” he exclaims, both eyebrows and lips downturned in agony. Harry gets the feeling that Justin has been bottling this up for a while. “My family don’t understand me anymore. I’ve pretty much lost all of the friends I had as a child because they think I abandoned them, and I don’t blame them. What would you do if, say, Ron left one day and never told you why? If he only came back for a few weeks of the year, with no explanation, and then left again? I would be pissed. It’s a wonder Elliot stayed with me for this long, if I am being honest. It was only a matter of time.”
“Good.”
Justin doesn’t seem to understand how to act in relation to the war, and for that, Harry can’t blame him.
“Yes, Potter?”
The store must stretch back for miles, Harry notes as he squints down the long rows of bookshelves. He feels mildly overwhelmed by the pure mass of content in the store. Where does he start looking? The further back the books go, the more obscure and interesting they appear to become. About six aisles down from him, there is a man handling a book which seems to be growing with every passing second. A little beyond him, one is hovering out of reach of a couple of young girls. Strangely, these don’t draw him in. When in doubt, it is always a good idea to start at the beginning, he supposes.
“No idea. I’m sure he’ll be fine,” he says, not much believing his own words. Then, without dwelling on the implications too much, he adds half-heartedly, “Whatever happened, he probably deserved it.”
Looking Harry in the eyes, Malfoy says with full candor, “You’re sorely mistaken.”
Suddenly- “Wait,” he mumbles out loud.
Despite being pretty minor in the grand scale of things, this offer of companionship means the whole world to Harry. He has a friend- a real one- who isn’t just Ron or Hermione, and one who isn’t about to give up on him, or leave him. He hopes.
Justin seems to wait a little on his bed, perhaps testing the waters to see whether Harry will join him. Harry can just about determine his faint figure through the material of his curtains, drawn up in a silhouette next to him. He knows he should get up. He won’t. Not today. Today is a bad day- he’s aware of it already. The ache in his brain, the freezing over of his mind, the way his limbs have gone soft- they are all indications. And he feels fatigued, despite the fact that he has only just awoken.
He says so- less elegantly than he wishes, but he thinks his point comes across. Some of the tension in Justin’s brow eases and he smiles again at Harry. His eyelashes are very thick, framing his eyes darkly.
“Is it true that you actually died and came back to life?” he asks, humming with eagerness.
Cradling his burns with his other arm, Malfoy closes his eyes. He squeezes it slightly and winces, though surely it still doesn’t hurt. The scabbing looks healed, at least. There is a crease in his brow, however, like he is reliving the pain, and Harry feels awful for bringing it up senselessly in the first place.
(See the end of the chapter for
He stares at Harry abruptly and without hesitation. Strangely, he also flicks his gaze up and down Harry’s body, just once. Wherever his eyes travel, Harry senses a flutter of his jittery pulse follow. He doesn’t know what it means, but he feels mildly disturbed.
Harry, mind frozen, brings his hand down to feel the cloak for, in his stupor, he worries that he might have left it outside or something of the like. Too fast, it was too forceful- something pulled. Too slow, the pressure built, dragging it down with it. He isn’t sure which of these it is, but somehow the cloak ends up falling. Falling- slowly, dramatically, until it lands on the floor in a heaped puddle.
(See the end of the chapter for
Shivering, he looks to the shop window on his right hand side. He examines the items on display and comes to understand that it is a bookstore. Archaic covers are woven with golden leaf imprints, and Harry notices that, bizarrely, one appears to be singing a melodic tune. The dark wooden sign states, with a carving now smooth from the Scottish weather which beats against it, that the place is named
“You’re in love,” she states matter-of-factly, as if she hadn’t just said something most illogical and unfounded, “My name is Erin, by the way.” The daisy-chain is almost finished as she says this, and she smiles at it, as if she is keeping a secret that nobody else is aware of.
. He glares at the creature as it bounds away and then focuses back on Harry with the same disdain.
, but he chooses to storm ahead despite the little voice that demands to know what is going on.
“Busy?” he starts and receives no response, “Busy...with things like missing notes?”
“Great observation, Potter,” Malfoy drones, “So why are you here and not tucked up in bed?” He throws out the question that Harry had wanted to ask back at him before Harry himself has the chance to ask it. Noticing the tinge of pride in his angular features, he thinks that it was intentional.
The sound persists and its volume is so overwhelming compared to the silence Harry which has become used to. Hiding in the space between his mattress and his pillow, he can ignore it no longer. It is ruining his depressive episode, for fucks sake.
“I’m serious,” grumbles Harry. Unjustifiably, he feels defensive. It is only a coincidence, it must be. He is positive that he didn’t come here on purpose. At least ninety percent certain, eighty if he is pushing it. Seventy.
of all people. His cheeks flush, feeling oddly like he has been called out- though for what, he is clueless. “That’s good, I guess.”
The last part of the sentence was a mistake; he knows it as soon as it comes out.
hiii hope u enjoy pls comment and leave kudos it means a lot to me :))
than receive Harry’s help. Suddenly, coming here seems more ridiculous than what he first thought- it wasn’t just a reckless move, it was a bad one.
“Potter, will you please do us all a favour and shut the fuck up?” Harry looks up at him in shock. His chapped lips are curled in irritation, and he spits every word like they have been revving up beforehand. Momentarily, the whirling in Harry’s head pauses. It is still with anticipation, frozen with the weight of the moment, and then it cheers again with vivacity when Malfoy continues. “You vomited all over the freshly varnished floorboards, and it lasted for at least a revolting two minutes. I would know because I counted, thus I conclude: you’re not fine. So stop lying.”
“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” says Harry bluntly.
Placing his head in his hands, he scrunches his hair, the grease ensuring that he feels every time he forwent a shower in favour of climbing into bed. He doesn't register it and quickly tries to calm his breathing, concentrating on the air coming in and out of his lungs and nothing else. Because, if he allows himself to think, he will realise that he is nearing the spot where Voldemort struck him down, the moment he is cursed to relive every time he closes his eyes. Being on the floor means he can sense every inch of the wet ground. It is blanketed in fallen twigs, stodgy soil and the rotting carcasses of defenceless things, soon to be joined by him, most likely. The rough texture is harrowingly familiar. He had felt it on his face, when he had fallen- not a cushion but a destructive landing. Before Dumbledore, and death.
He doesn’t want to end up living his life in some hospital bed- he wants to get
The return to Hogwarts was never going to be an easy ride, but he had hoped that his functioning streak would last longer than a weekend.
Behind the counter, sits a witch, plump and smiling, with violet hair in two large buns. She wears a modest floral dress which matches her welcoming manner. “Hello, I’m Jenna Lockwood,” she introduces herself, her surname indicating that this is her family business, “How can I help you?”
“You are really here right, Potter? You’re real?”
The horrified look on the other boy’s face is ingrained into his brain, destined to haunt Harry for the remainder of his failure of a life.
Questions upon questions flit through his mind; he wants to know more than anything what caused this to happen. His subconscious whispers that it isn’t any of his business whether Malfoy decides to die in his spare time, but he ignores it. Did somebody hurt him, attack him like those boys did it in the corridor? The perpetrator could have been running away just as Harry found him. If he had only worked a bit faster, wasted less time blubbering like a lost lamb, then maybe he could have got there first. Whoever it was would have been no match for the two of them. The thought is agonising.
Justin stirs the potion absentmindedly as he flips through the instructions, trying to find a specific direction.
Harry grabs his hair and pulls it fiercely, in the hopes that it might yank the
The Astronomy tower catches Harry’s eye, sticking out like a dark cloud on a sunny day, and history replays in his mind. Dumbledore had let him believe one too many wrong things on that fateful night. It had taken Harry a long time to feel angry. Sad? Sure. Confused? Absolutely. Rage came last, but it didn’t disappoint.
Pulling away, he says, “See ya, Nev.”
Later, Harry is tucked up in bed, and by tucked, he means constrained. The duvet feels confining and restrictive, and he cannot settle down. When he came in here, Justin was already in bed. It was a great relief, because it would have been just like the boy, warmhearted as he is, to want to try and talk it out. Whatever declaration, apology or grand moment of judgement he has for Harry can wait. Anthony is snoring loud enough to challenge an airplane, and the pillow wrapped around his ears is doing nothing to ease the thunderous sound, despite how tightly it is pressed into his head.
anyways hope u all enjoyed, as always kudos and comments and shares are really appreciated!!!
At some point in the night, he passes a clock. It tells him that it is three-forty in the morning, and he accepts grudgingly that tomorrow is going to be a killer. He watches it tick for a moment, remembering his clock back at Grimmauld Place, the one destined to chime up only at his most vulnerable and fragile. Weirdly, he misses it. At least at Grimmauld, everything felt ordinary; there was nothing that could truly spook him but the power of his subconscious, and that isn’t the house's fault. At Hogwarts, he feels like everywhere he goes, there is a new opportunity for fear and anxiety. A trigger around every corner. For being somewhere he has long since judged as his home, Harry is unsettled at just how little comfort there is here for him. It is just one vast prison of people and places who terrorise him with haunting visions.
First, Harry spots Draco Malfoy walking in late, clearly trying not to be noticed in creeping around the edge of the hall. He joins the Slytherin table at the very end, putting a considerable distance between himself and the rest of his peers. This makes the house appear even smaller than it is, the empty spaces speaking a thousand words at the current disdain of the house. Harry feels like he could be going into shock at the sight of his former enemy. He breaks out of his state to briefly laugh at himself. Enemy- really? At most, Malfoy was a pain in the arse. A melodramatic arsehole, who doubled as a bully and made idiotic decisions- absolutely. But he almost doesn’t want to grant the title of ‘enemy’ to such a weak person. Harry likes to think he deserves a more intimidating nemesis than Draco Malfoy and his stupid face.
uhhh... hello everyone! i would be seriously surprised if there was anyone still sticking with this story tbh after me abandoning it for like 5 months but im really ready to get back on track.. i already have another chapter written and ive found the motivation in me to write again. i'd love it if u stay around for the journey, because i promise it will be great (well i hope so)!!! im quite pleased with this chapter, so i hope you all enjoy (you might want to reread what has already happened if you've been waiting all this time)
He and Ron spend most of the day sitting out in the grass. The late September sun makes up for the fact that Harry is feeling spent today, as if the contentment he experienced yesterday has sucked him dry. Harry had been nervous this morning as he brushed his teeth in a tired daze, worrying that a lot would be demanded from him today when he has so little to give. It is a comfortable temperature, hot enough to sit outside but not too hot that they are sticky in their robes. Some crickets chirp cheerfully from the bushes behind them, singing a harmonious tune. Thankfully, the relaxing nature of the coming evening stops him from having to contribute much to any conversation. Harry feels guilty that he is like this, even with Ron. He isn’t sure what has happened to him that he gets panicked about spending an afternoon outside with his best friend. Oh- wait- no, he does. The war. His fucked up brain. What else would it be?
“It’s not usually unstable,” mumbles Harry, confused at the direction that this conversation has gone in, and he grasps at an opportunity to gain back the upper-hand, “Only when I’m dealing with enormous tossers who still sleep with teddies at night.” He winces at his awful and ungraceful comeback.
“Wait! Malfoy!”
Harry is about to reply agreeably when an aggressive vibration buzzes from somewhere in the room. He has no idea what the culprit could be, but he is certain that it’s in Justin's direction.
“Oh bloody hell, this is too fucking good.”
The statement hangs heavy in the air, and is only absolved by a shy breath from the boy in discussion.
Malfoy’s tall figure heads into the bathroom and Harry hears the shower turn on. The idea that Malfoy is in such close proximity to him,
Harry is shocked. With the amount of people that were there, he is astounded that not a single person knows who they were. With a hint of sadness, he thinks that maybe they just don’t care, or even worse, believe that Malfoy deserves it. He isn’t sure how he feels about the boy anymore, his sentiments seemingly having evolved from their boyish hatred of the past, but nowhere near reaching civility. What he does know is that he no longer wants to see Malfoy beaten down. However, to be fair, he hasn’t a clue who the boys were either, but he would be happy to provide a Pensieve memory if asked.
Upon the departure of Ron, Hermione and Ginny for the Burrow, Harry finds himself at a loss. They had offered, even begged, him to come with them but one thought of Molly’s tears had made him firmly decline, despite feeling ashamed to do so. Ron had shrugged despondently and then they had left him, standing alone on the pavement, walking away with their arms wound around each other.
Needing to escape the relentless moaning and dismal faces which were threatening to drag him into a scarily familiar depression, he had attempted to sneak away from his mates once the lesson had finished. Caught, Hermione had raised her eyebrow as he stumbled away, and he prayed that she wouldn’t question him. She seemed to sense his worries, in that wonderful Hermione way, and just smiled tightly. As she squeezed him goodbye, her earl grey scent relieved some of his tension.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry wants to shout at the top of his lungs that he would rather Malfoy bully him all year long than be ignored. He would bet his life that that would have him running for the hills, however. “Yeah, I promise,” he says solemnly, but the falsity is dripping from each word.
When Harry awakes, he thinks that the total amount of sleep he received last night would probably amount to no more than an hour. At one point, he had gone to try and rest in the warmer lights of the bathroom as a means to escape the roaring wind, which reminded him so strongly of those long, stretched out days camping with Ron and Hermione. He had grasped his head in his hands, curled on the floor of the shower stall and recalling the sense of hopelessness that had hounded him in those relentless weeks. It doesn’t help to ease Harry’s isolation when he remembers the way that he and Ron had grossly despised each other in those moments of fury and despair, and how Hermione had privately wanted to follow him, away from Harry.
His gown is just a fraction too large; it slips down his shoulder to reveal sharp collar bones but smooth skin, carved from marble. Harry forces himself to look away, bewildered by how intriguing he finds Malfoy’s bare shoulder, of all things.
hiii thanks for reading, please leave kudos and comments if you enjoyed (or didn't- tell me why!!) and tell me if theres anything specific you would like to see in this fic;) took bloody ages pls appreciate me cos im failing my exams for this love it! also feel free to share this anywhere OK THANKS IM DONE BEGGING FOR VALIDATION xxxx
He goes to sit down.
It takes a long time for Harry to unthaw. His conversation with Erin fades into the background of his conscience; his mouth moves mechanically, abandoned by his brain, which has wandered off into an abyss of white hair and mottled bruises.
“Tell me then, Potter. What is
, he snorts. What a load of shit. Unwillingly, he goes to join them.
“Ron…” Harry says, trying to stifle a snigger.
Malfoy picks a piece of fluff off of his clothes, taking his time to inspect it. He even seems to prolong the way he flicks it away, causing Harry to almost rip out his hair in a lapse of impatience, before finally speaking.
--------
She makes a noise of agreement and smiles crookedly, her freckled nose twitching and teeth showing. “Yeah, Luna’s coming to watch so I need to get my A game on. Otherwise she’ll make some weird cryptic comment afterwards and I’ll wonder if it was an insult to my playing or not.” At this, she laughs lightly as they step into a cafe.
Veiled in soft green leather, the book is, at first glance, an unimpressive thing. He hopes that the contents prove the appearance wrong. The persistent need to know what Draco Mafoy is up to never seems to disappear, though Harry had hoped it would. Maybe some information in here will provide him with some peace of mind. Anything to stop him feeling so wrongfully interested.
, and the delight in his chest makes him soar. Loughfowl, as in the very same name Malfoy scribbled on the second sheet of paper. Harry had cast it to the side, thinking nothing of it and sparing it no second glance. But here it is- the puzzle piece that Harry didn’t mean to find.
, they don’t.
“Harry?” Justin asks, the articulate tone of his voice pulling Harry right out of the smother of fog beginning to gather in his mind.
At this, Mcgonagall doesn’t appear to be surprised by any means. She simply nods and sets her drink down on the saucer in front of her with a measured
Maybe it is that Malfoy has practically told him to fuck off, in his weird, half-formal, half-aggravated tone, at least three times, and he still hasn’t listened. He probably should, but he doesn’t know how- it isn’t like he
For a moment, he convinces himself that Malfoy is about to say that it is, that he won’t stand for Harry’s company. Ever contrary, the boy just turns his lean figure to the view, so magnificently vast Harry feels like it must stretch out beyond our universe, and answers, “No.”
Harry thinks as Ron aims a spell at him, and he lets the familiar warmth in his belly spread to the tip of his fingers with satisfaction.
It could be the moonlight, or it could be sweat, but his skin has started to shine. He isn’t focusing on Harry anymore, isn’t focusing on anything. There is a veil between them. And he isn’t looking at Harry, but Harry is him. He notices the seconds passing in Malfoy’s expressions. Sees every fleeting emotion, which is only given away by the downturn of his brow.
“Aha!” says Justin in victory, pointing his finger to a smudged line in the book, “Got it!”
“I don’t believe you,” he mutters, deflated. It is the third time he has said it, he knows, and he feels like somebody’s parrot.
The castle flashes before him as he runs. Stone walls and the bodies of students merge into one grey blur, unrecognisable. Someone calls at him as he dashes past but he doesn’t register it. It feels like hours before he stops, but when he physically does, his mind keeps going. It races forward, pulling at his head. He is in pieces; his legs and hands are shaking, and his mind is in a thousand different places at once. Uncle Vernon and every hateful comment he ever made is in all of them, however. He throws up.
“Well that answers your own question,” says Malfoy very matter-of-factly, “Your memory is not right. We all know you’ve gone round the bend. Everyone says it.” It is an insult alright, but a rather halfhearted one. And a bit weak, if Harry is being honest. These meagre prods are for the likes of Ernie Macmillian, or someone else who is only
Nothing happens.
“Twat,” he laughs, a little stilted, “Are you going to tell me then, or shall I just die of old age first?”
Merlin, how he wishes Malfoy would try to engage Harry in an argument- just one more time, that would certainly be enough for Harry to feel satisfied. He simply needs a sense of closure in their animosity, he is sure of it.
It is only when Malfoy slides in, late again, with such an undeniably magnetic presence, that Harry is pulled out his trance. After waiting for so long in the dorm room and subconsciously looking for him all day amongst the castle grounds, Harry doesn’t really want an argument anymore. The anger and restlessness in him that he had this morning has fizzled out into a more familiar feeling of melancholy and dull aching.
“Anyway, Malfoy, I could say the same to you. I’m not the only one in this conversation, you’re here too,” Harry says, and maybe it is too much for them to hold an actual conversation, maybe he needed to keep it flat. “What are
hi hope u enjoyed reading!!! THIS TOOK SO LONG SO PLS COMMENTS AND KUDOS i beg... i would be very appreciative <33333333 !!! i tried to keep this chapter quite centred on harry and his friends because i feel like they havent gotten enough development yet- but of course still building the plot (which by the way is going to be quite big once it comes- just setting the foundations... i have a feeling this fic is gonna be way longer than i had originally planned)!
The Hippogriff growls in agreement from above him, shining in the flickering warm embers of the dampened fire.
“Are you actually being serious? Surely you must be taking the piss!” yells Justin, not paying any mind to Harry’s obscure arrival.
So, he concludes, it’s time to get up. At least today it's easier. Small victories, Harry, small victories.
Lifting his hand, Harry examines the way the sparkles look on his dark skin. In some ways, it is a sweet reminder of the love and joy of the couple that it came from. In many others, it just serves to provoke the memory of the way that Malfoy had briefly scanned him upon looking up from his desk, clearly judging Harry as dirty and uncivilised. The image of it certainly makes him feel so.
“What? Don’t bullshit, Malfoy! I saw it earlier!” Harry proclaims, frustrated. It’s not like he even particularly feels like fighting with Malfoy anymore, but the idea that he can be dismissed so easily doesn’t sit well with him.
- but such a life feels overwhelmingly out of his reach. A blurry figment of a dream that isn’t his to have. Right now, as he stands alone in the bitter cold of the corridor, just him and the silvery light of the night sky, it seems infinite universes away. When he lets a teardrop fall, he holds himself bare to the moon and challenges her to judge him as pathetic. He likes to imagine that the way the light brightens for a second is her smiling down at him.
-------
future, he will be able to find a balanced middle ground.
But Mcgonagall says, “No, Harry.
Eating his toast and jam in the kitchen, he smiles sheepishly at Kreacher, who stares at him from across the length of the dining table. Unsure whether he has something on his face, he rubs around his mouth with the back of his hand, but it comes up clean. Outside, the sun is finishing rising and the sky is soaked in golden washes of yellow and orange, the colour spilling throughout the clouds. His kitchen is submerged in the light of it; he regards the soft gold tones covering the entirety of the room, twinkling like stars, with a sense of contentment.
Their eyes meet and Harry takes in a breath so deep it chokes him.
deciding to stick his nose in a place where he thinks he’s necessary. News flash: he’s not.”
He catches Harry’s eyes then, and a few lone tears begin to fall. Feeling like he has massively intruded and recognising that nobody-
“Got ‘em,” says Ron, arriving at their table. He places a Butterbeer in front of Hermione and Harry respectively, and with a wide grin, a Double Firewhiskey next to his own seat. “Had a run in with some dodgy looking bloke at the bar who told me that the Firewhiskey will make my hair fall out. Told him he sounded like a nutter, I did.” Still, Ron glanced at his tankard apprehensively.
Hermione peers through the archway that leads to the bar as Ron pays for their drinks. The galleons in Harry’s pockets suddenly feel uncomfortably heavy and he gets them out so that he doesn’t forget to pay Ron back. Whilst the Weasley’s have a tad more money in their Gringotts vaults these days, thanks to the roaring success of Weasley Wizard Wheezes and an overdue salary raise at the Ministry, Harry still has more gold than all of them combined. The guilt of it is an unwelcome burden, but he also knows to be gracious for his privilege.
Wind filtering through his hair and cooling his burning forehead is what confirms it. He is at the Astronomy Tower.
“To death by Slytherins!” Harry and Hermione repeat, clinking their own bottles against each other. It rings out loud in the common room, which has emptied out as the fire has died down, taking the light with them. Harry notices that Malfoy has disappeared. Theodore Nott glowers at them so hard that he looks as if he might break into two, and the three of them burst into laughter. Let him tell the rest of the snakes what they had drunk to, as if it will come as a surprise that they are full of hatred. It does tend to happen when you are on different sides of an all-consuming war.
“Hey!” says Ron, offended and lightly reaching across Harry to smack her brown arm.
Pulled by some magnetic force, Harry moves a bit closer, to the end of the bed. He is careful about this, unlike he had been earlier with the Cloak. Every part of Malfoy’s body language, apart from his fingers, now stiff and motionless, yells of a spooked-cat. Harry doesn’t want him to run away. He himself does that often enough for the both of them.
if you read that all, i hope you enjoyed it!! i certainly liked writing it. it was a fat boy (10k) and took a long time but hopefully it paid off xx love u all, and feel free to chat to me in the comments. as always, kudos, shares, and comments are massively appreciated <3
Harry moans loudly, feeling like all his despair and grief at the very fact that this day has the audacity to exist is coming up from the pit he forced down this morning. It must be revenge for pushing it away. “It didn’t?”
of a scarlet steam engine, plague him through the night.
“Mate?”
He stumbles after the boy and pushes further. “That’s odd. Could've sworn I saw some of yours lying around the other day,” Malfoy ignores him and his pace quickens, “Something about a potion, if my memory is right.”
“What?” He holds Harry in contempt when he says it.
“Well that works for me, because I’m fine,” says Harry gruffly.
doubt. Oh, and overwhelming curiosity, a mind which doesn’t understand itself and crippling exhaustion, of course. He isn’t sure which part will win. Because this whole
And he may be generally oblivious, but even he can pick up that this isn’t quite the truth.
Harry scoffs, “Who’s lying now?”
“You’re joking.”
In the corner of the room, a clock ticks with irritating persistence, despite the fact that Harry doesn’t even recall owning one. Maybe Sirius’ old house has had a change of heart. Maybe it is giving him presents now, Harry thinks bitterly, as he reflects upon all the grief he has endured at the hands of the Black’s ancestral home. Not only a week prior had the middle stair evaporated under his feet, mid-step, causing him to fall and adding another hole to the sizeable collection steadily increasing on his jeans. He burrows his feet in the fluffy socks that Hermione had gifted him for his birthday, because if his own home is going to mess with his mind, he can at least feel insane in the comfort of woolen
Malfoy chuckles, and it is the kindest thing Harry has ever heard from his mouth. If somebody had told him all it would take is some measly vomit to chip away at Malfoy’s cold heart, Harry would have done it years ago. Maybe he could have been invited along to one of their house parties, where sickness was fruitful. “Nobody else is crazy enough to be out right now.”
He pointedly ignores the fact that he doesn’t even plan to interrogate Malfoy tonight, and rather, just itches to speak to- or
It hits him that whoever did this to Malfoy is still out there, and he promptly sets up a charm which will alert him if anyone is nearby. Hermione taught it to him, she teaches him everything he knows. He is useless without her. Where is she now?
In hindsight, Harry is not quite sure why he thought the best place to initiate his return to wizarding society would be the busiest and most well known street in Non-Muggle Britain. Diagon Alley, as always, is an eruption of colour, noise and smell. He gazes solemnly at Olivanders for a second, remembering the chilling emptiness of the shop the last time he had visited. Now, a pink haired teenager walks through the door, hand in hand with her younger sister and from the looks of it, a sparkling new wand. From further down the cobbled road, he can detect the whiff of the strawberry and peanut butter ice cream that he had once purchased from Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlour with Ron and Hermione, and if he really strains his senses, the smoke of an explosion from Weasley Wizard Wheezes sifts through the air. He knows that, currently, Lee Jordan is running the shop completely singlehandedly, and he mentally sends him good fortune. Nervous first years and bubbling second years, eager to see their new-found best friends again, are flooding the streets with parents in one hand and bags of sweets in the other. However, as Ron had said there would be, he notes with sadness the significantly smaller than normal amount.
Erin snorts and laughs for a second time, in that infectious manner of hers which has Harry joining in, whether he likes it or not, “Where the fuck are you? It’s pissing it down with rain in London.”
Harry himself also thinks of Snape and his Legilimency lessons in fifth year. He relives how vigorously he had been worked, how cruelly he had been treated for a boy only
“Oh,” her misjudgement doesn’t seem to bother her much as she carries on in her vaguely dreamy voice, “OK. Well then, you will be soon, mark my words. Or maybe you’re still in love with your ex?” Erin peers at him inquisitively, “But I think it’s the other one. No, actually, I’m certain.”
“What happened?” He sighs and tries to shrug off their perceptiveness, willing the unease it stirs in him to go away. That’s what comes with having people who are so close to you, he supposes. Sometimes he truly considers that they know him better than he does himself. Especially now has this become pertinent, with his relief at departing from Grimmauld intermixed with his terror in the face of Hogwarts, with his desire to be with his friends yet somehow completely apart from them, and with his inner conflict about everything Malfoy-related. Does he want to talk to him? Does he want to fight him? Does he want to forget him? Harry has no idea about any of it, but he’s sure Hermione and Ron do.
And then, he notices that Malfoy’s eyes are wide, staring directly at Harry. Panicking, Harry grasps at his Cloak, needing to reassure himself that it is still in place.
“Malfoy?” Harry prods, noticing that the boy has gone glassy.
“Nothing.”
-----
“None,” Malfoy states firmly and without a scrap of emotion- the world’s best liar. Even Harry, in all his suspicion, would have been convinced, had it not been for the very papers in question crumpled at the bottom of his bag.
“Who is this, Harry?” says Erin with a laugh and he can imagine her wiggling her eyebrows suggestively. The dark haired, freckle-dusted, grinning girl of his memory would certainly do so.
“Malfoy?” he asks, though he doesn’t need to ask. It is- of course it is.
“Yeah, no, I think that’s a great idea,” he forces himself to shake off the cold feeling and attempts to bring himself back to the room and the peace of a few moments ago. Only the genial smile on Justin’s face and the inviting warmth of the day manage to dissipate the growing pressure in his chest. He feels frustrated, but that won’t help him now, so he ignores it. “Might try that today, if you don’t mind me stealing your idea. I think it could be good to try and actually get something done rather than sit around on my arse all day.”
Despite being aware that the subject of the meeting is about his employment prospects, Harry still tenses up at the question. Until this very second, he had somehow still clung onto a feeble hope that some crisis might avert the necessity of the session. The stabbing sensations in his brain seem to halt in favour of a throbbing and unrelenting freeze, like he has iced over.
The unwanted awareness that he is in some form of denial is crushing. With the way that he militantly casts away the rogue thoughts that pester him throughout the day, and spends hours trying to wipe his mind during the night, it couldn’t be anything else. Then again, being in denial goes hand in hand with the implication that there is something he is trying to cover, and he refuses to acknowledge that too. You could say, if you can excuse the ridiculousness- he certainly can’t- that it is a double denial.
“Not at all! Go ahead.” says Justin enthusiastically. “In fact, want to do it together?”
Justin sighs a little and leaves too, closing the door gently behind him and whispering as he does, “See you, Harry.”
Following his instincts, he wiggles his bony feet into a pair of socks and shoes, chucks on his robes and heads out of the dorm room, sick of its stagnant air. He thinks suddenly that it is a real testament to his dysfunctionality that he flits between such extremes. One day, he cannot leave the bed. The next, he cannot get into it. All he can do is cross his fingers and hope that at some point in the future, the
Once the water has worked its magic the best it can, leaving behind only the familiar residual aching that he knows so well, Harry regretfully turns it off and grabs his clothes from the floor. Proving just how blissfully oblivious a good shower can render him, they are damp from where he hasn’t been careful and has splashed them. They are still covered in glitter and the laundry won’t be collected by the house elves for at least a couple of days, so he casts a quick cleaning charm. It isn’t quite the same, and as he puts them on, he curses the stiff and itchy feeling of the fabric that comes from washing with magic.
The realisation rocks him and his body shudders with relief and residual fear alike. He stumbles to the nearest tree, using the solidity of the trunk to ground him. Heaving deep breaths, he lets the tears fall unabashedly. After all, there is nobody here.
He shudders.
Though, remembering sixth year, he might have to modify that statement.
Sunday had been terribly awkward. There exists a weird tension between the four of them which makes Harry want to tear out his hair. He could probably spare some. Truly, he swears it grows quicker than everyone else’s, probably in some sort of lifelong rebellion against the memory of Petunia, with her sharp jabs and scissors. Whenever he takes a
Lying on the ground, head tilted to one side and arms limp like a ragdoll, is the body of Draco Malfoy. His skin is paler than the iciest winter, and there is a grey tinge to his pallor that almost paints him as monotone. If it weren’t for the pale bluish-pink of his lips, Harry would think the scene was in black and white. His eyes are sealed shut, like he has been trying to block something out. Whilst his arms are weakly splayed about, his fists are clenched.
The door is heavy, the solid oak challenging him to turn back, and his hands are sweaty. Malfoy will be asleep anyway.
. It feels almost cruel now to prod at both his and the other boy’s old wounds like this when they are so close to healing. Still, he can’t quite shake it. Some would call it self-sabotage, and he can’t find it in himself to disagree with that.
His spoon is cold against his thin fingers and he wishes he had some mittens. Or a self-heating spoon. That would be quite a luxury. He ponders whether Hermione could charm him one, but when he spots her snuggled into Ron’s shoulder like it is the happiest place on earth, he thinks that she is busy enough. Sighing, he shovels another mouthful of his soup with his regular, uncharmed spoon, only to find that it too has cooled immensely, thanks to Ron and his romantic snowflakes. He glares at it and pushes it away, having suddenly lost his appetite. Nobody pays his miniature tantrum any mind, and he judges it odd that he is always paid so much attention, yet simultaneously so little. Harry sometimes feels like he could stand on the table now and shout that he were to jump off the nearest mountain, and still nobody would discover him until they needed a good ol’ stare at or favour from their gracious Saviour, and couldn’t get it.
“A bit of gratitude would be nice, maybe,” mutters Harry, ignoring the first part of Malfoy’s question.
Without as much as a simple
Neither of them talk; Harry debates leaving. He is still standing, though fidgety is an understatement. Restlessly, he shifts his weight back and forth onto each leg, like each one contains a bomb which can’t be put down for too long, lest it explode.
Later, Harry’s brain is in pieces, blown into dozens of shards several times over. After Malfoy’s cryptic and puzzling comments, his mind is reeling with confusion and, most concerningly, worry. Despite the boy's half false assurances that it wasn’t a suicidal incident, there is something amiss. Harry is uneasy.
“Yeah,” Neville agrees, laughing though his lips are downturned, “Probably.”
Mind, his life at Grimmauld wasn’t too different from that- minus the mates, the job, and the housework. Add a strangling layer of trauma and anxiety which cripples him daily, and then you would pretty much have his days.
Suddenly, the moon slides into the room. Silver hair is illuminated by the light emerging from the clouds; Malfoy looks otherworldly. “That’s something you’re never getting. Find it somewhere else.”
“Hmm, yes, we could, but we like it out here, don’t we Dean? Pretty exciting? The risk of it all, all those innocent eyes just waiting to come in,” he waggles his eyebrows and Harry realises, with an internal smack to his forehead, that he has accidentally spoken his inner monologue aloud.
Harry tries to sleep, he does, he really,
He makes a quick escape, rushing for the door. If Justin says anything else, Harry doesn’t stick around to hear.
Another inch, or two. They are touching now, and Justin cradles Harry’s face, staring him straight in the eyes. Dryness causes Harry to lick his lips, feeling self-conscious and not wanting to be chapped. The action draws Justin’s attention away from his eyes and his gaze slips down. Harry shudders and leans in closer. His own lips are not as full as Justin’s, he realises.
Harry doesn’t reply, not finding anything that will excuse him of his creepy behaviour. His feet are both pointed inwards, and his shoes have a hole in them.
Malfoy never comes into the room. Harry detests that he wants to know why. Granted, the boy is a hard worker- he has to be in order to have almost topped Hermione throughout their school years- but the chances of him still scribbling away in the library with that high-arching quill of his are pretty low. Unless Madam Pince has taken him, and he debates the idea fearfully. He wouldn’t wish such a chilling end on anyone, even Malfoy.
to steal it for himself.
Or he is just delusional.
A few moments after Harry speaks, Malfoy appears to shake himself of whatever thought was on his mind. Harry dreads to know, yet craves it simultaneously. Still facing the window, he frowns, “OK.”
with him that- whatever this is- it doesn’t matter. Sulkily, he shoves his head underneath his pillow, judging that it might be less bothersome that way.
In the morning, Harry recalls the most chilling part: how close it already felt to reality.
“So now we’re stalking
would never be sitting here with sixth-day hair and fresh stains on his jeans from where he spilt his cup of tea upon being handed it by Mcgonagall. His hands had been trembling as he accepted the delicate ceramic. Or maybe he would. Harry has never been very skilled at knowing himself.
It was about a week ago now that Harry had sat, chat, and threw up with Malfoy at the Astronomy Tower. Merlin, the memory of it makes him cringe,
He shuffles awkwardly on his feet as he clambers for something comforting to say. Nothing comes, so he asks what he really wants to know, “How come?”
Whoever is on the other end of the line seems to respond with the same volume, if the tinny noise coming from the phone is any indication. Justin stands up and throws his hands in the air exasperatedly.
“So are you planning on ever actually answering any questions? Or are you just going to be a git forever?” mocks Harry, jutting his chin out. Merlin, Malfoy brings out the petulant teenager in him, but he would be kidding himself if he said it didn’t make him feel a little giddy.
Perhaps it’s Harry’s fault, since he has to be so fucking complicated- he wouldn’t be surprised if people are just scared shitless of pulling his trigger. He cannot find it in him to joke about the war itself. The thought of the battle, the fleeing, and the lives upon lives upon lives lost to what should’ve been his own fucking fight- they frighten him, make him lose grip of his own mind. But that last act- Harry killing Voldemort? It almost seems like a joke in itself. If he doesn’t make fun of it, of how terrifying the finality of that moment was, he might combust with the weight of it.
Luckily, the coast is clear. The curtains around his bed are shut, announcing Malfoy’s presence, whether Harry sees him or not. For the whole duration of the night, Harry stares at the bedframe, wondering at the boy and his secrets fastened inside of it.
“I don’t believe you, Malfoy,” Harry raises his chin in the air for what he hopes is a dramatic effect, and not a feeble effort to seem taller. In the silence of the castle, he is sure that that drumming sound is his heart threatening to plummet into his belly.
“Hi. Morning,” Harry smiles back at him.
At least from this instance he was able to deduct that Malfoy is, in fact, not a robot, as Harry had begun to mistake him for.
“Sorry that I left you guys,” Harry leans back against the seat and wraps his arms around his knees, the instinct to protect himself still existent, “I had to get out of there before Amelia Brundlewood ended up stealing one of my socks, or something.”
He lifts his head a fraction, slowly becoming aware of where he has turned up. Absorbing his surroundings takes a while, because he has to close his eyes every few seconds to ease his headache. The puddle of vomit on the floorboards is what he sees first, and he grimaces at both the smell and the sight. Merlin, it is leaking through the cracks.
you had one of those,” continues Malfoy and Harry assumes he means his Invisibility Cloak. The glare which is shot in his direction doesn’t take someone with eyes to feel. It burns enough. “Pansy always said I was chatting bollocks. I was right, though. Obviously.”
“You know, Elliot and I have a pact. When the weather is sunny like this, we have to do something with our day that we usually wouldn’t. Take it as a chance to be productive, or something. It’s silly really, but it helped me after the war,” comments Justin, sitting up a little in his bed. The duvet puffs up around him, framing his small figure in clouds of linen. “When I just didn’t feel like getting out of bed.”
Time ticks as slowly as the earth spins, and the sense of embarrassment grows too much for even Harry to handle, although he is finding the whole thing incredibly amusing, in a strange,
“How is that any of your business?”
-------
Blushing at the thought, he moves beside Ron as they walk down the road, conscious of Ginny’s fiery gaze behind him. She had been the one to call time, after one particularly bad week in which Harry had refused to see her. It had been two months since the battle at that point. There was a wedge between them, which had been cruelly forged during his absence in seventh year, perhaps even before. No matter how forcefully either of them shoved at it, it prevailed- strong, solid and fixed.
“Ollie, Mary!” Another voice yelled for them from his place in the queue. “Where are you?” The voice was now tinged in worry.
“Will you shut up? Right, best laid plans and all that rot, we’ll just wing it.”
"Yes, he wasn't a Muggle sympathizer and he believed that having a wife who had a creature inheritance an embarrassment."
Hari looked from Draco and back to Bill, before he continued. “Serve him loyally, or die. Does that sound like a Death Eater to you?” Hari said in challenge. “That sounded like a scared teenager to me, desperate to survive and trapped by his own upbringing. He was only sixteen, my age, your brother’s age. What would you have done? He made a choice, the only choice his upbringing provided him.” Hari paused taking a deep calming breath, his next part he was going to reveal hurt Hari, because it felt like betrayal. “Dumbledore knew and did nothing, because he needed a pawn in his war game to get his spy closer to Voldemort. He had Severus kill him instead, a mercy kill on Snape’s part, but a calculating, manipulative one on Dumbledore’s part. Draco needed help; he didn’t ask for help, it’s not in his nature to do so. But Dumbledore knew that Draco was in trouble, a student that he as Headmaster should have protected, he didn’t. How many students did he make suffer for the greater good, Bill?” Hari cut off, on a choking gasp, turning away to lean on the countertop. “I can’t get into this anymore, I am too exhausted. Bill, no one else would save him, so I did.” That was it. That was all he had in him. If Bill didn’t see reason, he would cut him and the Weasley’s loose if he had too. He wasn’t going to abandon Draco now.
As they left, displayed in the window Ollivander’s, three iconic wands proudly sat on display under heavy wards to deter thieves. Connected by a golden cage of light, (Priori Incantatem) was a 13 ½ inch Yew wand with Phoenix feather core, (Lord Voldemort’s) and an 11 inch Holly wand with Phoenix feather core (Hari Potter’s) doing battle. Beneath the two infamous wands was an unspectacular, 10 inch Hawthorn with Unicorn hair core, (Draco Malfoy’s) the wand which helped defeat the Dark Lord.
Draco and Hari laughed awkwardly alongside the salesperson. They really didn’t know what they were doing.
-Rubeus Hagrid,
At her intense stare, Hari turned bright red and wouldn’t meet her eyes. Draco was the first to recover. He coughed once and stood, his movement forcing Hari to take a step back. Draco became acutely aware of his half-dressed state as another shiver passed through him, though it lacked less intensity of the others.  Spotting the forgotten charcoal shirt at his feet, Draco bent down to retrieve the garment. Unbeknown to Draco, Hari stood transfixed at the sight of the muscles rippling down his back. When he stood back up, Hari quickly looked away, embarrassed by the possibility of being caught.
Hari couldn't find words, instead he sputtered, squawked, and finally hissed out Draco’s name. Stifling a giggle, Hari rested his brow against Draco’s shoulder,  effortlessly smudging it too. Draco allowed a contented hum to rumble from his throat at Hari’s eager touches.
Draco’s pinkie and ring finger twitched as if to comply, but the movement was halted with a hiss of pain from Draco. Hari hissed in sympathy as he tried to crush his anger.
Stay Awesome!
Draco smirked knowingly and whispered back. "So I can scent mark you in private." Hari's cheeks flamed.
“This is a ball, Teddy. Buh-aw-LL, ball. See it’s green and um, bumpy.” Hari looked sheepishly up at Draco. “It took me a minute to get used to talking to someone who doesn’t talk back, but um, he really likes movement. So I got lots of smaller-ish toys to play with him. Oh, watch this.” Hari said as he gently rolled the ball in Draco’s direction.
"Good. Now how about, you try for some spices to add to our mix. I caught a crawfish. You ever have shellfish? You allergic?" Tout asked.
Quick poll for the readers: will end on December 11, 2018
Shooting daggers at Hari, Draco fought down his rising panic. “Potter…”
Hari was steadily getting more and more dejected as more and more wands rejected him, with Mr. Ollivander standing above him hymning and hawing. He felt like the eleven year old boy during his first trip into Diagon Alley, feeling insecure about his presents in the wizarding world. Mr. Ollivander looked up switching his gaze between Draco and Hari, before saying, “I have wondered if it would be the same, I have just the wand.” He quickly swept around a tower of wands and they could faintly hear, “Yes, yes! I have just the thing, I am sure. A supplier from the America’s shipped the core to me a few decades past. It’s quite unusual core. I have only used it in one other wand.” He came out from beneath one twirling wand tower, “Lily Evans.” He said it so nonchalant that Hari thought he heard wrong. Have the same core as my mother?
As they slowly come to an end, Draco becomes aware of his surroundings once more. He sees the bright and colourful bouquets of roses everywhere and people dressed in their best robes. Kingsley Shacklebolt, Minister of Magic, smiles at him as Draco executes the last dance-steps, carried by the soft music of the string quartet and Harry’s sure lead. As the music slowly fades away, he watches Molly Weasley dab the tears away with a pristine white handkerchief, sees Hermione do the same. Pansy and Blaise grin like idiots and Draco is fairly sure they mirror his own expression.
He shoves his cock into Draco’s mouth, immediately welcomed by an eager tongue and strong sucking, and he goes deepers, relentlessly fucking his cock into Draco’s throat, disregarding the fact that his harsh movements jostle the trapped bollocks.
They should have at least the weekends to themselves, but Draco’s own work schedule cuts away their precious time together. St. Mungo’s is always hectic and always in need of competent Healers. The fourth floor is busy at all times of the day, treating hexes, curses and spells that have gone wrong. It’s visited by Aurors much too frequently for Draco’s comfort but he is glad to never have met Harry during his shift.
Now, years later, Draco can’t imagine not having music around him every day. He carries it with him, made possible by some clever Muggle device, and he even got the hang of downloading new songs from the Internet. He’s particular proud of this accomplishment. The Internet is virulent and dangerous for the imprudent mind, much more so for a person like Draco, who still fights with all the Muggle stuff most days.
He brings the dripping fabric to Malfoy’s face, carefully rubbing at the different traces of body fluids. There’s a literal layer of grime, and once it’s gone, Harry flinches. Underneath the filth, Malfoy is deadly pale and littered with bruises.
“Shite, I need a new jumper,” he says to noone in particular and is surprised when he gets an answer from Malfoy, who’s still watching him.
His hands grab Draco’s hair harder, almost yanking him forward on his cock, finally breaching that skilled throat. From then on it’s an artless face fuck, but Harry doesn’t care and only wants to reach completion.
With a flick he conjures a stool and sits down. It’s going to take some time.
Draco cries out, high pitched and wrecked, before he comes, too.
Harry thinks it's a nice gesture,  Draco always tells him spitefully that he 'donated' more than Lucius to St. Mungo's just by the fact that he's there almost twice a week. Because he's reckless, he can admit that. The years should have been quiet, with Voldemort gone and nobody to take up his slack. It seems the times of evil, megalomaniac Dark Lords are over, but despite that, Harry still gets injured on a regular basis.
Also, while I have read much and fantasized much, I have never been to a BDSM meeting or something similar. If there is anything clearly wrong with my description of Harry and Calliope and their "neglect" of Draco, please let me know. It does sound like something that can happen, depending on your relationship and your friends, but I can't be sure.
He thinks about the little things that make him happy. Waking up beside Draco late on Sunday morning, wrapped up in each other and content with the world. Sitting at the breakfast table, just the two of them. Working in the garden behind their cottage, his fingernails crusted with mud and a huge smile splitting his face.
Like Harry would be gay and actually marry such scum like Malfoy. It’s crazy to think anybody could willingly marry this snake. Rage sweeps through him, and he does conjure the knife just as planned to cut off the offending appendage.
Harry loves this about Draco. Despite all the teasing he still does, all the snark he can’t quell no matter how hard he tries, he knows what boundaries he can cross and what should be left to rest for eternity.
(Also I needed to change the POV so we can end on Draco in Ch. 30 and make the connection to the beginning of the verse.)
The endorphin rush subsides as fast as it came, followed by the crushing realisation of what Harry has done. He just used an Unforgivable on Draco Malfoy, who is admittedly his nemesis, but who’s also injured and weak and not even a hint of danger.
The fabrics are softer and seem more sturdy. Some of them are infused with magic for better fit or longer durability. He has self-cooling shirts for hot summers, and auto-warming socks for the Scottish winters.
Harry basically forgave everything, the huge and awful things as well as the small ones.
As he closes his eyes, letting his mind slip into the oblivion of sleep, he thinks about Harry and that their love helped him deal with so many obstacles before. He dreams about Harry’s sweet smile, his insightful knowledge how Draco’s mind works and all the small and big ways how he helped healing the wounds of the war by simply being there and listening when Draco needed it.
It all grinds to a halt when he finally, finally, puts his hand on Draco’s chest. Both their breaths stop for a second. It feels different than usual, obviously, but Harry would have never imagined how so. It’s a soft mound, barely enough to fit his palm, but warm and soft and perfect. He wants to pull the dress down right this second and take one of them into his mouth, but he has to be tame as long as they’re in the open like this.
Someone is calling him, so Harry peels the sheets from his body and scoots over to the edge of the curtains. His muscles scream in agony, but the pain feels pure, just like after an intense Quidditch practice. Or several of them. His brain thrums away in his skull, but that pain is also manageable. Only, when he puts his feet to the ground, everything is wrong.
“King’s Cross.”
He’s never been so calm, so serene. Systematically his mind separates itself from the burden of living: he doesn’t feel his legs moving or the twigs that crack under his heel. He doesn’t feel his heart beating away, or his breath catching in his throat. He only feels the light touches on his arm and shoulders. He only feels Draco’s hand in his.
“I don’t know.” And he doesn’t, but he also doesn’t care. Sometimes you don’t have to question everything.
Harry thinks for a while. His thoughts are scattered, but simple. He can go ‘back’ or he can go ‘forth’. He doesn’t know what ‘back’ means, doesn’t know where ‘forth’ will take him. When he thinks of ‘back’, there is a slight pang, a pain so delicate and yet deep, that he can’t breathe for a moment. When he thinks of ‘forth’ there is only calm and warmth and the distinct knowledge that something, someone is waiting for him.
When it gets emotional, Draco trusts in different Muggle singers like Dido or Katie Melua. He has a playlist for workouts, for parties, for dates with Harry and even one for particular naughty sex.
The Opera House is a sight to behold, but Harry only has eyes for his husband. Draco looks at it with reverence, his face illuminated by bright blue lights. There are pictures projected on the usually white walls tonight, but neither pays any attention to what they are.
He looks around the overgrown path, remembering the peacocks showing off their beautiful plumage. He remembers the bright flowers that were his mother's pride, the ethereal white horses on the paddock near the woods.
Carelessly Draco lets his robes fall from his shoulders, followed by his shirt. They pool to his feet and he cringes inwardly, but he isn’t the one responsible; the Veela can’t get rid of the clothes fast enough. It’s a bit embarrassing how eager it is to finally be let out, but Draco can sympathise. He’d been a prisoner long enough to have experienced the cravings of freedom, no matter how short the time was.
Harry peels the sheets from his body and scoots over to the edge of the curtains. His muscles scream in agony, but the pain feels pure like after an intense Quidditch practice. Or several of them. His brain thrums away in his skull, but that pain is also manageable. Only when he puts his feet to the ground, everything is wrong.
"Everything."
Harry vanishes the crushed tomato, and levitates the others, all with the wave of a hand. He's become pretty good at wandless magic, Draco notices as a surge of lust shudders through him. It shouldn't be so hot, but it is.
Once more the words were obstructed by Draco's lowered head. Hari went over to Draco to tilt his head up. Draco wouldn't meet his eyes at first, until Hari squeezed his jaw harder than strictly necessary, green eyes blazing.
"Where would he go, Minnie, if not Hogwarts."
"Justin" Hari says a little dazed. Justin Finch-Fletchley was a Muggle-born Hufflepuff in the same year as Hari and Draco. He had never got along with Justin for obvious reasons, but Hari's relationship with the Hufflepuff was estranged ever since Hari set that snake on him in second year, -Hari did not-so the rumor's Justin spread accusing Hari of being the Heir to Slytherin. Since Justin was later petrified by the Basilisk, but cured by Mandrake Restorative draught. That tension never dissipated between the two.
"Now, now Mr. Potter, don't get upset, a title is just a title. Did you know that while the name Potter is in fact a very common English name, it was corrupted from one of your ancestors hobbies?" With a nod of confirmation the chieftess went on. "Yes your ancestor full name was Linfred of Stinchcombe in the twelfth century, he was quite good with herbology and potion making, and because friends and family would often see him pottering around the garden, they called him the Potterer."
"No, the ceremony. It was nice. I got to spent time with Draco’s family."
"It's because you ripped my fucking heart out. Okay, Potter! Can't a bloke cry when he's been rejected, huh? It not like I didn't know you couldn't possible love the likes of me. It's not like I even meant to confess, it just slipped out. I'm not a bleeding buggering moron like some people, I knew you couldn't possibly return my feelings. You're not even gay. You have a girlfriend." He wiped the tears from his eyes with frustrated huffs of breath and impatient hands.
"A promise is a promise." He mumbled against Draco's startled lips, before pulling away to sit at his side.
The end of July couldn’t come soon enough. It was still June. Closing his eyes against the temptation, he refused to release Hari from what was demanded of him. Finally Draco was brought back to the ever real present by the low hissing of Parseltongue, and Hari’s stiffened posture.
I was so worried he was so tiny next to the other players. The Captain of the Slytherin team was a sixth year, Marcus Flint. A real piece of work, with bad teeth. The Slytherin team had a habit of choosing their players for their brute strength rather than their brains. A shame because the Slytherin house is known for its cunningness. If I were on the team, if I was captain, I'd turn the whole ethnics of the team around.
With a slow smile spreading across his face in genuine enjoyment, Harry said, "You know what Kreacher? I would love to eat breakfast outside." And so without any ceremony, Harry stood up finding his alcohol induced migraine reduced from screaming pain, to mild roar. "Wow!" was all he said as he stepped out onto the terrace patio, the scenery taking his breath away.
Hari popped his hips and shimmed easily to the beat of the music playing on the wizard's station on the radio. Much to the disgrumblement of Kokoa, who considered the kitchen her domain, Hari expertly navigated around the kitchen, moving easily around the burners, then back and forth from the pantry, cold storage,prep station, and stove top. Draco could only stare.
His hand was met with lace and he hears laughter, "he-he, your junk catch a breeze, queenling?"
"Why what, Draco?" Hari inquired already on the stairs ready to descend. Draco held his breath once more when he heard his name being spoken by Hari for the second time, perhaps ever. When Draco didn't respond only continued to stare, Hari waved his hand in front of his face, until Draco flinched back.
Alleycat smiled almost impishly. "Very good, Prissycat. Yeah, I guess I am. Kaa here was just telling me that you smell of old magic. You're a witch, too?"

"So, Hari...how do you like your new wand?" Draco said trying for friendly conversation to break the heavy silence.
Harry was just finishing frying up some eggs, when the birthday boy himself waddled in the room looking like a fat pig in a blonde wig. Harry saw his lips moving slowly as he carefully counted the number of presents taking up nearly all the room on the table. He kept a careful eye on Dudley, as he set the first plate down dangerously close to falling in front of his uncle who was reading the morning paper. Because he was watching Dudley intently he saw the moment when he exploded in anger.
"Potter, what's so funny."
"Harry?" A familiar soft bell like voice spoke next to his shoulder.
- on Dudley's face. He couldn't help but remember the times he teased Hari with food, the table scraps he was allowed, the forced diet already on top of food scarcity.
The sport is played on flying brooms in the Quidditch Pitch, high in the air. There are three giant golden hoops on either side of the pitch. There are three types of balls; two Bludgers, one Quaffle, and one Golden Snitch. If the Quaffle is thrown through one of the hoops on the opponent's side, they gain ten points. The two Bludgers are enchanted to knock players off their brooms. The Golden Snitch is a tiny golden ball with wings that is very difficult to see. If the Snitch is caught the game is over, and they gain one hundred and fifty points. However, it is entirely possible to win the game without being the team to catch the Snitch. It is a matter of having more points, the Snitch being caught just ends the game and usually gives that team the advantage.
It was peaceful at Shell Cottage, maybe he should go there, but it wasn't untouched by the war; Dobby was buried on the beach after he saved everyone's life at Malfoy Manor.
thought to himself. Yesterday's excuse was he was feeling sick,
"Nonsense, you have duties to see to before the start of term." Dumbledore chided gently.
Sincerely_Devra
His dragon had decided that Hari was his and an outside alpha was not going to expel him from his own territory. The only person to do that would be Hari.
The people began to be mistrustful of her intentions as Queen, being the most influential person on the king and future kings of the land; jealous of her status, wealth, and beauty.
—plaid shirt, he just knew he couldn't wear it. Throwing the offending garment on the floor he sat down on his crowded bed and ran his hands down his face in frustration.
“Brilliant, but I just recalled something,” Hari said puzzled. “Hermione told me the first time she met that she’s already tried simple spells and they worked out for her…How was she able to do so? She grew up with Muggle parents.”
Petunia Dursley couldn't have known what fate lay in wait for her younger sister that night. Afterall, the last time they saw each other was at Petunia's and Vernon's wedding. When Lily and James' announced their own enempials, Petunia and Vernon did not attend in return. In fact, the last letter Petunia received from her sister was the announcement of her nephews birth.
"Dudley and you know perfectly well he's my cousin." Hari corrected face still buried in his hands.
Draco smiled as they proceeded to roll the ball back and forth to each other, with Teddy secure in Hari’s lap. All the while, Hari talked about how this was helping Teddy with his visual tracking and hand eye coordination.
The house-elves, ever loyal to the House of Black, followed Andromeda, Narcissa, and Draco’s orders, they belonging to the Black bloodlines, but deferred to Hari as head of the household.  As the Scion of two Noble and Ancient Houses, the house-elves wanted to call Hari, Master Potter-Black, but in a compromised, only called him Master Hari. The ladies in residence saw nothing amiss at having their titles being hyphened with their maiden name. They were tickled pink the first time the house elves used them. Draco couldn’t care less about continuing the Malfoy line; however, the Malfoy vaults were his and renouncing his father’s name entirely meant the Ministry would take hold of his still frozen vaults permanently. Draco followed Hari’s example in simply going by Master Draco. Even Teddy, as Hari’s heir presumptive was not spared being called Young Master, or Young Master Lupin-Black.
Draco longued between his splayed legs, and Hari felt rather than saw Draco swipe his tongue from the base of his penis to the tip, before swirling his tongue around its head, dipping just beneath  the foreskin to press against the gland there. Hari’s view was obscured; however, by the curtain of moonlit hair.
"I...I think so." Draco said hesitantly. "And Alice?" Draco asked risking opening his left eye to see the pixie like woman.
I finally found out what Harry, that Mud-blood, and Weasel are up too. During breakfast they received a letter from that oaf of a Gamekeeper. I just so happened to be walking by, okay I was eavesdropping on their conversation. Harris, Haggis? whatever his name, has a dragon egg and apparently it is hatching soon. Weasel and Harry wanted to skip Herbology to watch the dragon hatch from its egg, but Granger said no. After out morning class, I followed them to the hut at the edge of the Forbidden Forest.
Draco could roll around in it and Hari would be none the wiser.
Draco never talked about his infatuation with Harry Potter with Crabbe and Goyle, too afraid that it would get back to his father. He learned that lesson, painfully, with a canning to show for his efforts. Her little Dragon never spoke of Harry Potter in a positive light ever again. The first Hogwarts Express train ride, Draco was nearly late boarding having nearly waited too long to catch a glimpse of the infamous boy. It was a habit her Little Dragon did every start of term. She could sense his hurt and embarrassment when Harry rejected his hand on the first Hogwarts Express ride. Oh, he tried to hide it, just like he tried to hide it when his innocent infatuation turned lustful his fourth year at Hogwarts during the Triwizard Tournament; an Alpha's nose never lies. It's a good thing Lucius is a simple Beta, else he would have been able to sense Draco's feelings a long time ago. After all, Draco always managed to talk about Harry Potter in his father's presents, just not quite in the way Draco would have liked.
of his own that produced a jet of water that hit Hari right in the face.
Draco sighed, “That is what Pansy and Blaise said to me….multiple times.” He said grudgingly. “I tried to make every excuse that I hated him to my friends, but soon I stopped believing those lies. I find him ridiculously attractive in this sort of nonchalant, scruffy way. His hair has this quality about it, either like he’s just rolled out of bed, or just shagged look.” Narcissa raised her eyebrow.
She left to the sound of Hari’s peels of laughter.
He was just about to open the fridge when he rolled his eyes at his own stupidity. The light might attract unwanted attention. Turning to the pantry using the light from above the stove and squinty in the dark, he rooted around the pantry. There were so many options to choose from.
Somehow Draco’s words pierced his very soul. “Same.” He croaked out.
“A Seeker in the making, ah? I can get around that.” Draco nodded in approval.
Petunia's face, previously void of color, colored red with anger. "Like I said," She began in an ever rising shrill voice. "He's not here, that freak, scoundrel, that...that thief." She spat. "He stole money from my purse, had my husband arrested, and humiliated our family in front of our neighbors, and my Dudley's friend."
"Masters Draco, sirs! What to get. What poor Dot gets for poor masters hands?!"
"Alright, yeah. If you have any questions, I'll just be...here." And so without prompting Draco settled his head back on Hari's shoulder as Hari read on and once more carding his hands through Draco's silken hair. Draco relaxed into each stroke and began to hum, a deep crooning noise in his throat. The sound having Hari pause. When he stilled his hand, the humming stopped, and when Hari continued the crooning continued. Hari grinned, settled back, and read on.
Draco and Harry go get new wands together.

Andromeda laughed victoriously. “Before we invite the world in, we have a finish making our home. Why don’t Cissy and I finish up in here, and you and Draco sort out your bags upstairs?
So, here you have it, the Black family reunion! There is a little over a month in the story before Harry's first heat, so what does that mean for the direction of the story? Not in this particular order mind you:
Draco didn't know what compelled him to follow, but he did.
Minerva McGonagall, professor of Transfiguration for the past 35 years, Head of Gryffindor House, and current Deputy Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was livid. The focus of her ire, none other than Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, the blithering imbecile, and current Headmaster of her school. The reason, the Hogwarts Book of Students Past, Present, and Yet To Come has just finished updating this years student attendees.
affects you.” Bill’s words were said almost absently, musingly, but the sharp look in his eyes let Draco know he knew exactly what he was doing. Draco swallowed the billows of smoke in his mouth, hacking uncontrollably. Bent at the middle, Draco looked up through watering eyes. “You can’t act on your feeling at the moment, but I don’t trust you. So I’ll be keeping a very close eye on you.” Bill stepped back, grabbing his dusty bag from the entrance floor, shaking it off with one hand, Bill placed his other hand heavily on Draco’s shoulder. “Malfoy, I don’t think…I don’t think Sirius ever got around to telling Hari about our blood.” Bill was of course talking about the vast majority of Wizardkind whom had some resemblance of creature blood in their genetics.
And Safe!
Draco looked down at his sleeve to see it still covered the dark mark and his magically concealed wand in its sheath.
Even when he prepared the meal himself, the Dursley’s would only allow for him to eat the leftovers, burnt, or foods Dudley refused to eat. When Hari was ten he tried to get away with eating a little extra by purposely burning a few meals. He had become partial to the taste of burnt food. That came to an end when his pigsty of a cousin, Dudley noticed that Hari had been a little too happy with his meals and like the pig he was squealed to his mother. Hari was sent to his cupboard for the whole weekend without any meals, only let out a few times a day to use the restroom.
I have friends and family in the health care profession.
"The name's Nik. What's yours?" Nik asked.
Thank you all for your wonderful support and patients with me. Also I know Revenge of the Sith came out in 2007, but I don't care. Padme always rocked her looks and she is a Queen.
“I am looking, Hari.”  Draco frowned, eyeing Hari from head to toe.
Bill eyes narrowed, flashed from blue to gold. “Don’t you two have places to be?”
" Hari gasped in his arms, looking up at Draco as if seeing him for the first time. "Father never denied me anything, so naturally I expected to get the book." Draco paused. "He told me no. For the first time in my life, I remember feeling anger. I threw a tantrum right there in the bookstore." Draco paused. Hari could see his eyes were far away.
It was a spacious room, large archways and glass doors and windows giving the room an open feeling. Against the south facing wall was a large four cushion couch. Above the couch was a large gray scheme landscape, featuring a crystal clear lake that reflected the sky above and snowy mountains. Against the north facing wall an large desk sat in one corner and in the opposite corner, an even larger bar. In front of the couch was a coffee table made of the same wood as the rest of the room, with matching end tables. Beautifully decorated gas lamp with bases of rich bronze and shapes of tempered glass in an array of colors from ambers to brown and yellow topaz, and turquoises to aquamarines, sat atop each end table and upon the desk. The glass shades matched the colors in the crystal chandelier above the bar.
The lines tightened painfully around Hari’s arms. Letting out a long breath, “I so swear.” The lines flashed blue briefly and settled back to the white colour. The pressure loosened significantly.
Hari looked on in astoundment. “You know a lot about this?”
“Sirius had no family either Master Harry, sir.” Kreacher pointed out.
Draco, nearly overwhelmed with affectionate appreciation for the raven haired, emerald eyed boy scrubbing pans, and chatting with a tiny black haired woman with purple streaks through her hair, and whispered, “He's Perfect” His dragon hummed in agreement.
No man, not even a bent one like himself, wanted to be called pretty. At least that is what Draco told himself; he didn’t take insult to Hari calling him princess that morning,
“I don’t know Malfoy.” Hari said through clenched teeth, reverting back to calling Draco by his last name in reflex. Signing, “It’s complicated.” He really didn’t know why it was happening. But unfamiliar situations caused negative reactions in him. He knew in his rational brain that he was no longer in danger, but sudden noises, or an unexpected touch, and even large crowds now unsettled him. He never really liked crowds before, and now he was being suffocated with all the attention, unwanted or not, it was stressful. It was now a reoccurring situation, where he would panic and he’d withdraw inside himself, frozen, or worse his magic would rush to the surface lashing out violently. Somehow Draco’s touch calmed him and he was grateful for the git, nonetheless.
"My mum's idea. My name, I mean." He said as he reached over and took back the draft. He thought of the only time he had seen his name written not by someone in the muggle world, when he received his Hogwarts letters. All it said was Mr. H. Potter. How was he supposed to know his name was spelled any different. His aunt probably knew, and changed it to the "normal" and "non-freakish" spelling.
Resigning himself to his fate, Hari apprehensively made his way to Draco's room down the hall.
"Look kid, Harry." Nik says as he points his own mug of tea at Harry. "There are a lot of sketchy people living on the streets; drugs alcoholism, those willing to do and sell anything to get a quick score for their own gain, or pleasure." Nik didn't want to think of the perverts in and off the streets offering to 'save' the homeless boy. So many girls and boys go missing, sold into sex trafficking never to be seen again.
Raised off the earth in the center of the lawn, the altar was draped in a golden cloth, decorated with oakleaves, flowers of every hue of red, orange, and yellow; predominate by sunflowers, and an abundance of summer fruit and vegetables.
“Of course he plays. He is a very happy baby.” Hari insisted. “Although what we call playing is a bit different for him at this age. What you sketched was called belly time. Teddy has to learn to strengthen developing muscles in his neck to hold his head up. As of right now, he doesn’t like it very much, but soon he will be rolling around on the floor, crawling, or he might skip the crawling and go straight into walking. But that isn’t for a while yet. So you want to play with us?”
“Draco Malfoy, how do you plead?” No emotion for Draco on the Prosecutors part.
He opened the door, Hari was standing really close to the door, he hadn’t bothered knocking a second time. He was holding up Draco’s journal with his arm up at a 90 degree angle. Draco was stunned.
"I'd be damned." Blaise whistled. "The prophet and a handful of other newspapers like Cecelia have speculated. I mean, a copy of Hari's pardon letter has circulated the papers. Some saying you've bewitched him."
"I just don't want you to get hurt. I don't think he is good for you. I want you to be sure, before you jump into any commitment..Speaking of commitments, what about Ginny?"
“It’s alright, Harry.” A ghostly hand settles on his shoulder, firm but not, and Harry finally understands Beedle’s tale. The dead can’t come back, they are always caught in the veil, neither here nor there, as long as the stone calls to them. He’s aware he’s crying, trying to muffle his sobs in case the enemy is near, but he can barely bring himself to care. Not when his love comes to him from beyond the veil, trying to comfort him on his own last journey.
However, a look at the clock on the mantle tells him he’s late and they need to get going if they want to catch their Portkey. The anticipation makes Harry’s stomach flutter as he climbs the stairs to his dressing room, courtesy of Draco’s meticulous renovations of Grimmauld Place. They both have dressing rooms for days like this when they need to keep a secret alive for as long as possible.
It’s horrible, what those kids had to endure during their captivity, especially the girls, and an army of Mind Healers won’t ever make it alright, but at least they stopped the madmen before anything more serious happened. It’s a small consolation, but in Harry’s book staying alive is still a better option.
Pansy is bustling around, wearing Draco’s “Kiss The Cook” apron, a wooden spoon in her hand, wielding it like a wand and barking orders at Blaise, who dutifully stands by the side and chops vegetables. It smells heavenly of strong spices and fresh ingredients, but Harry can’t help wondering where Draco is. They haven’t noticed him yet, so he clears his throat, trying to get their attention.
“Oops, sorry,” he says, although they both know he isn’t sorry at all. He leans forward, catching some of the blood with his right thumb. The silver ring gets bloody as well, but it only fills him with satisfaction. He smears the blood over Malfoy’s plump lower lip, pushing and prodding until the split opens again and deepens, causing even more blood. It’s an obscene and violent lipstick, and Harry thinks smugly that it looks good on such a pathetic poof.
Harry winces at his rudeness. For a second he actually forgot who he’s talking to and that Malfoy is a ticking time bomb on the best of days. Today doesn’t even seem like a bad day, but like the worst day ever. To his surprise, the git only chuckles lightly.
“Draco.”
The timeframe that is important is the developement of Draco's headaches (I hope you noticed by now and aren't surprised). It will lead to a conclusion and give us the opening for the much longer, much darker 'verse I am planning.
He has his hands full of two dozen jumpers and shirts, some in garish colours he wouldn’t even look twice at, but Malfoy insist he try them on. They have already finished the trousers (he was even allowed some new jeans), but Malfoy, that damn slave driver, has announced he will make Harry try some robes and jackets as well. They’re in the most expensive shop he has ever been, but he can admit that he sees and feels the difference.
There’s more. Dildos and plugs, gags and bondage rope, but also sensual candles, massage oil and underwear, potions for all kinds of purpose, condoms and other contraceptives. Calliope has it all and if she doesn’t, she knows where to get it. It’s their chosen shop since the beginning of their relationship, when they experimented with many different kinks. It all died down over the years, but Harry and Draco like to revisit some of them from time to time.
It took him years to tell Harry about it, afraid he would be laughed at, or thought of as crazy.
“Maybe you should get up and let me help you,” Harry says, but it’s not a suggestion.
He turns, again fixating Healer Neill, nodding at the man when he hands the file over. Mediwitch Goldblum waves frantically at him, beckoning to get over there.
“You want to come, Dragon? You want to show these people what a slut you are? Maybe I should strip you and fuck you on that table, invite other people to use your mouth so your screams won’t be too loud?”
He thanks the clerk, working out the details of delivering everything to Hogwarts, before he turns and says: “Now that we’re done, how about we do something I like?” Malfoy laughs softly, untypically, and just nods, holding the door open for Harry as they leave.
They hissed at him angrily, accusing him of taking advantage of Draco, who couldn’t defend himself in a world that hated him. Who had no other choice but to stay with the Saviour, who only got his job because of Harry’s name and would lose it as soon as he dared to leave. It was all nonsense, of course, but even Pansy and Blaise seemed convinced. What did it say about them all, when even Draco’s closest friends didn’t believe in them.
It’s the longest speech Harry has ever heard from Malfoy and the only time that there is no trace of insult. It’s just an account of what happened and why, no malice or ill-intent. It makes asking questions easier.
He winks at Calliope. “Seems like we found something.”
Then there is a period in his life that he doesn’t remember at all. After the war, when he was suddenly drained, no adrenaline to fuel him anymore. Not battles to fight and nobody left to rescue. It was a bleak year after the war, full of tears, vastly shed and desperately hidden.
“Draco, up you go,” he says, low and dangerous. It only quickens Draco’s heartbeat, and he nearly stumbles over his own feet, so eager to comply.
“Well, I don’t see why not. We’re alone, it’s dark, and I clearly gave you an order, although I can surely repeat it if that’s what you want. Although I don’t think you’ll like it if I have to ask twice.”
Now it's all soft touches and whispered love and maybe Harry wants to stay in this carefree bubble a little longer.
Something is itching in the back of his mind, and it isn’t a headache, which is new and refreshing these days. It still bugs him for several days, before a tiny and innocent fleece blanket finally breaks the stubborn bubble of cluelessness.
Draco is a pro, though, so he’s swallowing everything without complaint and stays put when he’s done lapping it all up. His cheeks are rosy, and Harry can imagine how wet he’ll be underneath the dress. There’s no danger that Draco’s going to come without permission, and it needs to be given explicitly, which seldom happens.
There is not a single sound except for his shallow breaths.
“Tell me, love, how wet are you? Shall I see for myself? See what a slut you are? Would it bother you that people can watch everything we’re doing? Knowing you, it turns you on even more. I bet you’re desperate to come, aren’t you? What would you do so I’d let you come right here, where everyone can see it? You want to, don’t you?” He’s rambling a bit, but his husband doesn’t seem to care.
Harry hooks the leash on him again and leads through into the darkness and behind the counter. He brushes something aside, likely a curtain, and suddenly, there is light. They step into a white-tiled, sterile-looking room with a medical chair, not unlike the one Hermione’s parents have at their dentist’s office. It smells clean, but there’s the slight sting of an antiseptic burning in Draco’s nose. He narrowly avoids sneezing as he takes in the different charts and pictures on the wall. Some of them are medical, but some are art shots.
“No more, please. Not again, I can’t. Please, Harry!”
Right on cue Blaise hurries him out of the kitchen and into the den, where Draco is fast asleep on the sofa, face contorted in pain, even in sleep. Harry picks up the blanket from the floor and drapes it back over his husband. He sinks down on the opposite settee, fully intending to watch Draco sleep, but his eyes grow heavy and before he knows it, Blaise is shaking his shoulder, announcing that dinner is ready.
Harry lets his gaze wander upwards. The midnight blue dress falls softly around his legs and accents his narrow hips. They swing sinfully as he walks down the stairs. Small diamonds catch the light, making it look like it’s embroidered with actual stars. When his eyes land on Draco’s chest, Harry’s breath stops for a moment.
It’s a mesmerising display and Harry is pleased beyond measure.
It’s those memories that keep him sane when he’s faced with death and malice and all the nastiness that still won’t leave his life. And Harry wouldn’t have it any other way.
“Crucio!” Harry bellows, satisfied when the curse hits an unsuspecting Malfoy, making him writhe in agony. He barely screams, which dampens that elated feeling inside Harry just a bit but not enough to stop. Only when he sees fat tears rolling down pale cheeks and flecks of blood flying from bitten lips, he stops.
They end up in Honeydukes. Harry likes it well enough to enjoy shopping there, but he has never seen someone’s eyes brimming with joy like Malfoy’s do as soon as they enter. People look at him in annoyance or anger and Harry can’t resent them for it. They all know what Malfoy did. But surely they can’t stay mad when confronted with the delight that’s written all over his face. He seems almost reluctant to touch anything, to get too close to the displays, as if he won’t be able to hold himself back, once he lets his restraints slip.
“Seriously Harry, don’t let it be like sixth year. I know you were right, I know he was up to something, something bad and awful, but maybe he isn’t now. Malfoy just looks lonely sometimes, maybe that’s why he’s spending time with you. Think about it.”
Today it’s a failed potions experiment at Diagon Alley that made everyone within a mile sick. It was a tricky case since usually the purple end of a Puking Pastille is enough to conquer almost every form of sickness, but not today. Until someone finally found the cure the whole emergency area was full of vomiting people, the stench a challenge for even the strongest stomach.
Harry swirls him around, his hand sure and strong on Draco’s hip, his other possessively holding Draco’s right.
“Don’t worry, babe, I’ll just call that Indian restaurant you like and get some Chicken Korma and Naan for us”, Harry says and disappears into the den.
But there is something in the air, something that makes him almost giddy. It could be the spirit of Christmas, which is coming closer with every day, but Harry doesn’t think so. While he’s learned to enjoy Christmas, it’s still nothing that makes him especially excited or gives him sleepless nights. He’s planned on staying at the castle, where he’s sure he can enjoy some quiet days, even if Molly is writing every day to change his mind. He loves his family, he really does, but this year he just doesn’t feel like celebrating much. Maybe it’s the lingering trauma of the war, or maybe Harry is just one of those people who can be content by themselves in the company of silence.
Harry grunts at the appropriate places, nods sometimes or smiles when he thinks Ron needs some assurance, but he is barely listening, lost in his own thoughts. It’s so homely, sitting in the den of their cottage, his husband sleeping, his best friends around, after a home-cooked dinner, and a Firewhisky in his hand.
“It was bad today, wasn’t it? I heard about Diagon Alley.”
However, there are still things Draco can’t forgive himself. Letting Death Eaters into Hogwarts. Getting Dumbledore killed. Watching the Dark Lord murder people without raising a finger. Watching Bellatrix torture Hermione. He shudders when he thinks about each and every mistake he did during the war. Sometimes he wakes in the middle of the night, the screams of countless victims in his ears.
Another snap of his fingers and Draco is lifted into the air. Usually, Harry would carry him in his arms, but with the humbler still trapping Draco’s balls, it would be painful. Maybe so much so that Draco would likely come after a few steps, pain slut that he is. Harry won’t risk it.
“You did good,” he praises his sub, his thumb wiping away one of the tears. “You did really good, Draco. I’m proud of you. Now, I think I promised to spare you the stairs and you earned it.”
To emphasise his words, Harry pulls at the nipple piercing again, pulling the tit as long as it goes before letting it snap back. It earns him another shudder and an audible moan. Harry pulls the panties out of Draco’s mouth, now completely ruined, and he doesn’t care who hears them. There’s another Portkey ready to take them home as soon as the opera ends.
Harry feels slightly ill, feels transported back to sixth year. He might not have used the Cruciatus Curse back then but something equally horrible.
His mouth still tastes like crap, but at least the heaving subsided significantly. Draco drops on the couch in their den and snaps his fingers to make the room dark. His magic is unstable at the best of times ever since he has more pain filled days than not, and he’s surprised when the curtains close without causing an incident. He has no idea what time it is, other than it’s day. Did he just get off his shift at St. Mungo’s? Or is he due in a few minutes? It’s all fuzzy in his head, laced with the thorns of agony.
Potter groaned again, head moving from side to side slowly as he groggily opened dazed eyes to look around, legs shifting, arms flexing before stiffening. Potter held very still, his breath halted in his chest as he slowly looked up into gray eyes with pupils blown wide. Draco’s own breath hitched as he looked down into brilliant eyes of emerald magnified by dorky thick round rim glasses.
Mouth suddenly dry, Hari gulped. "It's a good thing you aren't going alone." Hari padded out on socked feet to his own room to change his clothes for something less resembling he just came back from a funeral.
Dear Journal,
Hari paused in his mad pacing. That vain prat could probably dress in the dark and still match impeccably.
The two nodded in return before checking out the sitting arrangement. Blaise slipped his own wand out of a hidden sheath, ignoring the group that tensed, and waved it at the only spare chair, executing a perfect
“What was that for?” Hari asked confusingly as he dabbed at the pearls of blood on his lips.
They both declined assistance to their “car”. Both of them were eager to get home to Grimmauld Place and be with Teddy.
“So you can see his good qualities and overlook his faults. That’s very admirable, intuitive even, for a teenage wizard experiencing his first love. As for his fashion choices, I agree with you, but that can be easily changed or adjusted.”
Harry hung his head in disappointment. It just figured the giant talking snake couldn't tell him anything. Kaa seemed to pounder for a moment.
Harry is stubborn. Now he’ll never be my friend. He’ll see. He’ll see how everyone else treats Weasley and mud-blood's like that Granger, was it, and come crawling back to my side. First I’ll have to get rid of these louts, Crabbe and Goyal. No, Father said they’ll keep the heathens from attacking me in their jealousy. DAMN! Harry Potter will be my friend, mark my word.
"Not Harry! Not Harry! Please... I’ll do anything ..."
“Sirius’s motorbike? Your grandfather’s; the one we drove all over London? It can fly?” Draco asked incredulously. “Why the bloody hell, didn’t we fly it already?”
Some of you voiced concerns for my health. I am doing fine. As well as could be expected, in this pandemic.
Hari thought flustered, except he was also
Hari closed his eyes and bared his neck as he felt the hot breath of the dragon on his face. He waited. He waited for the burning pain of red hot fire on his flesh, or the ripping pain of teeth tearing into his unprotected skin.
He always was with his silky blonde hair, gorgeous grey eyes, and cheekbones that could cut diamonds. The intense look Hari received was not an unfamiliar look aimed at him, just not in a while.
ow does it work, I mean we’ve held each other and kissed…does it affect you then?”
“Love?” Hari rolled on his tongue. No one had used such an endearment on him and absolutely meant it with Draco’s conviction before. It was nice.
Harry raised one eyebrow and Kreacher seemed to have realized that Harry needed him to show him the way out of the private study. Gesturing towards the other set of double glass doors and they opened inward on their own. Stepping through this entrance, Harry took in the details of the large library with row after row of shelves lined with books. Four vertical windows that took up space from floor to ceiling, on the east and north wall added the natural light Harry had noticed before filtering into the study. Instead of gas lamps lining the walls, magically adjustable mirrors reflected sunlight all over the room. In the center of the library was two giant circle tables, and against the south wall was a giant fireplace. There was no other doors leading out.

Hari Potter was an enigma. Where was he taking him that “strange” clothes were acceptable luncheon attire?
“No, I understand...er, its not that. It’s just that Voldemort used my blood to revive his full body.” He felt his forearm and the ragged scar that served a reminder of his part in the resurrection of the greatest dark wizard of its time.
