A/N~  So here we are, more angst and fun details…
Harry needed leverage and shifted them so that Draco was laying on his back and Harry could push deeper in.  Draco was panting with each thrust, Harry lowered himself so he could capture Draco’s screams with his own mouth.  The kisses were drugging, and driving them higher.  Each thrust carried them closer to heaven, and their bodies tightened and burned.  Draco met every thrust, Harry demanded every sound with his mouth.  Strong fingers wrapped themselves around Draco, and he could not hold back the bliss any longer.  Streams of hot wet jets shot from his shaft into Harry’s hands and all over their stomachs.  Harry followed, releasing Draco’s mouth to shout his own orgasm to the skies.  They both went limp, Harry rolling them over so as not to break the blissful contact.
“I don’t have time for this Mr. Potter, I…” Harry cut off Snape’s protest, “It will only take a moment, and you can then reassure the headmaster I do not need handling, and maybe more. If you do not try, I will invade your mind, and that did not go well for you the last time.”
Severus nodded, not taking his eyes off the box. He handed Harry the vial of potion.
“Please place your books onto the table in front of you so I can have them collected.” He instructed.  The students began to murmur as they reached for their texts.
Ron grinned a bit, “Yeah, mate, I don’t want to make you uncomfortable either.”
At dinner Ron was fuming, “How could he give you detention for nothing?” Harry just smiled, “Its fine, a ruse to use his lab. Calm down, the man has given up more than you will ever know.” Ron groused some more, but then went on eating. A small pudgy owl flew in and dropped a small pink note next to Harry’s plate. He picked up an apple slice and offered it to the bird and took the note.
Harry let his thumb swirl over Draco’s bottom lip, he nodded then got off the bed.
Once Harry had pulled away, Severus spoke more gently.  “Now can you tell me what you have said to that imbecile of a godfather about me?  The man is practically embarrassing as he tried to apologize to me for the past.”
Severus snorted, Harry chuckled.
“The minister will not be happy with this, Mr. Potter.” She said, trying to keep the fear out of her voice.
Ron’s mouth fell open.
“That was a very interesting move.  What charm was that?” Severus asked, righting his robes.
“Do you care?” Draco asked.
“I wish I could fly half as well…” Ron whispered.
“You can feel it too, can’t you?” Harry asked.
“Not yet, but I expect news from one of my informers any day now as he said he knew where to look.” Dumbledore supplied.
Harry’s strangled voice barely ground out, “Draco…”
Harry turned toward the dark owl and took the scroll from its leg.  It was not from his normal friends, so he was naturally curious. He rarely got any letters from those not within his circle or from the Ministry with new Potion orders.  He broke the seal and unrolled the parchment.
They finalized some of the details and Harry was happy with their plan.  He would present it to the Order in a few days.
Ron accepted that.  Harry placed a map he made of Privet Drive on the desk in front of them.  Ron pointed out obvious places to have the Order members stationed, and the place where they should ‘leave’ their post.  “I suggest Remus, Tonks, Mad Eye, and Shacklebolt.  Those are who the Death Eaters would expect, though keep Dumbledore away, he does not need to be there if your power gets displayed.  Have Severus sit this one out, guarding Vincent or some such nonsense to keep his status quo for both sides open.”  He continued looking at the map, “You should be here, he pointed to a spot on the lawn.  Have the Death Eaters be directed to here,” He pointed to another spot.  He thought about it.  “If You-Know-Who arrives he will most likely go directly inside the house… So since you do not want a full confrontation, stay outside.  You can confine him to the house and he can see your full power that way. Sort of like a front-row seat.”
“Thank you, for the beginning of my relationship with your son.” Harry started.
“Harry?” Ginny called to him.
Draco looked at Harry’s face, the one he had seen a million times over the last 8 years.  The face that taunted him, caused him to hate, caused him to fear, and caused him to be safe.  This one man, who he had battled with for so long, was standing here, had worshiped his mouth, turned him inside out and made him weak with desire.  He saw a new face.  A handsome face, sexy, confident, and hungry.  Draco shivered at that last revelation, he sighed softly.  Harry’s eyes darted to those lips, and Draco pushed forward wanting more.
“No, go on, no seating changes necessary.” Draco said, waving his hands to make them go away.
“Told you so,” Hermione whispered to Pansy, taking the small coin purse she was handed.
Harry let her go and continued on his way to his room.  He was making a statement, drawing a line and he might involve more of the student body than he had anticipated.  He really had to be careful. He didn't want the Dark Lord to take it out on children. Pansy herself had no bad or good outcome from the war, her involvement or noninvolvement should have no effect on the balance, or so he thought, but he just wasn’t sure.  This was a chess game and all the pieces were in play.  Ron might be the best person to talk to on this one.  Unfortunately the key individual in question, was snoring rather loudly.
“My token to show our sincerity. We,” She looked back at Lucius who nodded, “Agree to your terms and will work however you need us to achieve your goal. But,” She glanced at Draco, then back to Harry, pinning him with her stare, “You hurt him…”
“Knowledge” his other hand traced the purple rune.
He was unceremoniously dropped from the broom as they exited the room.  He watched Harry perform the necessary task of yet another Horcrux down.  Harry's eyes bored into his soul before turning away and going back into the din of the fight.
The following week, Harry worked effortlessly on his classes and then spent the rest of his free time in the room Dumbledore had let him use.  His first day he spent constructing the exact dimensions of the arch from memory out of stones he had brought in.  The actual dimensions were critical for the spiders when they arrived.  He needed their webbing to cover the whole arch.
Harry nodded, “At great cost.”
Harry swung his legs over and walked up to her. “You madam, will suffer much if you don’t back off. You may not believe me or in the ‘sight’, but I know about you. Your drive to rid the world of half-bloods is greater than Voldemort’s, and your loathing for children is evident by your willingness to employ a blood quill for detentions, not to mention you would not hesitate to use unforgivables on students to further the ministry’s ideals. It won’t last, madam… And you will not break me.” Harry dropped his wand into his pocket, backed up two steps, performed some complicated hand gestures that were graceful yet intimidating, and she found her arms bound tightly together, her mouth sealed shut, and her feet glued to the ground. Her eyes stared hard daggers at Harry, promising retribution. “I will release you, but just know this. My vision of the future, made me live for over twenty years from this day, I was trained by the best Aurors the Ministry had after the war, and new spells and curses were developed. Do not mess with me or mine. The ministry will survive, and remain in power, and unless you change your tune, you will not be with it. Do I make myself clear Madam?” Harry gazed at her, locking on and not letting her look away, she nodded barely. “Good, we can work together, if you behave.” Harry offered, swirling one hand in another complicated pattern, and she found herself unlocked from her bindings.
Severus nodded, and cleared his mind, casting the necessary shield charms, and weaving them into the Occluding fabric of his mind.  He met Harry there in that dark space, the foundation of the wall already in place.
“You are mine, mutt... Not a plaything… mine. There is no ‘goodbye’.” He said the last with a feral growl erupting from his throat. He picked Sirius up and carried them back to their bed.
Harry let his hand fall on the other cheek just as sharply, and hardened further at the following moan.
Draco shivered almost violently under the onslaught of sensation as his mouth was taken and his senses exploded around him. He fell into those dark green eyes and melted. He could only nod to Harry’s words. His body needed this man’s possession this night.  Whatever came after, he would willingly surrender to.  He had one last truth to impart.
“Oh, and I almost forgot.  The next time you see Mundungus Fletcher, ask him to watch Grimmauld Place for an afternoon while we go out somewhere. It’s important that he be left alone there for some time.  You will understand afterwards.” Harry explained.
Draco breathed in the spicy scent of Harry, his head swimming in pleasure.  His hands wrapped around the silken shaft and he marveled how soft the skin was under his touch.  Each stroke mesmerized him until he could no longer resist the lure to taste.
Harry’s first years were doing very well with their exposition of Pixies.  They could identify all the parts of a Pixy by the day’s end.  The next lesson would cover various weaknesses of the creatures.
Harry turned to leave, remembering that a certain Potions Master was in the office with the Healer. There would be so many he would see again, but he had to not force it. This one though, he could not resist.
Harry laughed, “Only you would see this as something other than your perfect punctuality.”
“I lived a hollow life for her memory… now I breathe each breath for you.” Severus captured a gasp he earned by lifting the mutt and pressing his erection hard into Sirius. He took his time, letting his tongue dance with his lovers. Letting their breath mingle until they were breathing as one body.
Finally, he called the rain to fall from the clouds and the fire was extinguished… He raised both hands and place them together, then gently rolled his hands back to back and pushed softly away, as if pushing the clouds apart… and all the elements fell away on the breeze that was gone soon after.
Her face went almost grey, “You will lose your memory of all the events of your vision, if you choose to let it go. And so will anyone you have talked to about the vision.”
They walked around the dead monster, and Harry let go of his hand for just a moment to take something out of his cloak and place it just inside the mouth of the figurehead.  Harry cast a charm Draco had never heard, and then Harry moved back towards him.  He took a position behind Draco, and wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist.  Draco held his breath as they took off into the chamber, flying to the top, then parallel with the walk way, and finally landing softly before the large door.  Harry whispered to it and it closed, Draco did not hear, his mind was filled with wonder at how Harry could see him through the mask of Malfoy.
“No worries, Mr. Potter, you were not invading.  I got the hang of it, so next time we can work on the bad ones, and we’ll work from there. I do appreciate the training, it is much harder than Occluding alone, but from what I can tell so far, more effective.” Severus stated.
“He is part of my task.  You have your knowledge now... Madam Bones, the choice is now yours.  Many on Voldemort’s side will know of my powers by Sunday… I am sure that will filter to the Minister soon after.” Harry said.
Hermione dropped the ward and smiled at him then went off to her bed.
“You are not her... I would have gladly died because she was dead. But now I live every day, for you. I go to a madman with only the thoughts of a stupid mutt to keep me from doing something stupid.” Severus spoke against Sirius's neck, nipping down for punctuation.
That was not an offer that Harry had been expecting.   But it made Harry really think, so much could be put right.
Draco coughed, “And you trust him?”
Severus was intrigued, the insight was on target, especially with his knowledge of the workings of the Dark Lord’s mind.  Severus looked at Harry, his composure was so unlike the boy of a few months ago.  Usually Severus could read Harry like a book, his emotions always worn on his face.  This Harry was composed, and assured.  He seemed to know when to show his emotions and when to preserve them.  This was truly Harry, not James or Lily, since both had been open books.  Harry was also unlike Severus who just imprisoned his emotions from public and private view. Maybe there was a balance, something he could ask the boy about later.
“Truce, Harry. Thank you, for sharing. Though how did you build a wall like that in your mind? Even with my extensive Occlumency skills I have only managed some barriers.” Severus pointed out.
Draco looked up at him from under dark lashes and he could barely hold himself back.  He had pulled Draco’s head back needing to see the utter submission in those eyes.  No pride, no arrogance.  He looked like sex and sin, with only need and hunger in those eyes.  When Draco’s mouth dropped open, Harry used his free hand to caress those lips.  He took a moment to savor them before he positioned himself at the tip of Draco’s lips.  He caressed down one cheek and then positioned both hands to grip Draco’s hair guiding the man’s mouth onto his hard shaft.
“Family? Huh?  I think we can find a suitable position.” Sirius said with a sultry tone.
She eyed the green-eyed man and waited patiently.
He placed a hand on the Potion Master’s shoulder.  “You have friends, and well, a surrogate son who looks up to you…”  Harry hoped he did not tread too far into foreign territory.
Pansy knew no Slytherin could resist a bet, and Draco Malfoy was no exception.  Hermione created a scheme that would be sure to backfire and cause Draco to have to perform a duty upon losing.  Cocky as he always was, he accepted Pansy’s bet and lost due to the superior intellect of Hermione’s plans.  All unknown to Draco of course.  So they had waited, Draco Malfoy had never lost a bet, so they were not sure if he would go through with it.  This was better than either girl had hoped.  The first peck was obvious, but Hermione knew something grand was happening when Harry hid them both from view, that made Pansy upset since she didn’t know what was going on.  Hermione just waited.  She just knew she was right.
“Wha…” Vince sputtered.
The door opened from the ante chamber, and Professor Dumbledore entered.  He looked alert yet cautious.  The sparkle in his eye only returned when they fell on Harry.
Dinner was no exception to the usual.  Everyone kept to themselves, many just quickly ate and left to attend to other things.  The gossip over Harry and Draco’s friendship seemed to have died down as well… Old news it would seem.  Seamus found Harry this time, and expressed his apologies for his previous behavior.  Harry quickly forgave him and pulled out his pre-written invitation to the ‘defense club’.  Hermione did not understand why Harry prepared it, but now sat smiling at him because of his insight.  Seamus was grateful and excited clapping Harry on the back as he left.
“Did you never wonder why I never left you alone, Severus?” Sirius was desperate not to let the man flee.  Severus turned his dark gaze upon him and he took a breath.  He didn’t trust himself to speak.
They set up a brewing station at one of the desks, and Harry started calling out the instructions for the disposition of the ingredients.
“Cum with me, Draco!” Harry cried as his release tore through him with the power of a lightning bolt striking him. Harry’s eyes never left Draco’s silver as he flew over the edge.  He collapsed onto Draco’s sticky stomach. He held onto the blond as they both tried to regain their breath.  Harry rolled them over onto the bed, he reached for his wand and cast several cleansing charms. He pulled a pain potion from his drawer as Draco snuggled closer.
“Shock. The boy is in shock, which is the only thing I can surmise. There is no fever, or any other symptoms that I have seen.” Madam Pomfrey stated as she settled Harry onto one of the infirmary beds.
Draco’s eye wavered a moment, but he truthfully shook his head.  He did not know Harry’s intentions.  He wanted them to be long term, needed them to be more than one night.  So he would beg for that.
“I can’t tell you what to choose.  That has to be your decision.  I’ll see what I can find on the topic and let you know.  The more you understand, the better position you will be in to make the choice.  And I’ll think about what you said, just be careful when dealing with Slytherins… they are sneaky.” Sirius cautioned.
“What bothered you more, Sir? That he tried to act like an adult, or that he apologized?” Harry asked, curious for the answer.
The sun was still rising, a few clouds were in the sky, partially blocking the brightness. At the current angle, the radiance of the sun was behind the trees and the breaking rays highlighted the luster of Draco’s hair. His blush had not faded much, coloring his cheeks and neck. Harry mused, if he had paid more attention during his early years, he would have noted Draco’s looks. Though diminished in light of his character, he was still very attractive.
Sirius’ body was assaulted with overwhelming sensory stimulation. Severus’ scent was dizzying. When he was lifted and pressed harder into the wall, he wrapped his legs around the darker man and gasped again when He felt Severus’ need for him. His heart bore the brunt of the assault with every word, it beat faster.
Hermione was the first to break the moment, holding up her invitation.  “It’s almost time to return to the dorms.  Place your wand onto your parchment, and it will turn into a coin.  This coin will allow us to communicate if need be, with one another.  It will also act as a port key to our future meetings.  It can only be activated by placing your thumb in the center so that it can identify you by your magic.  This way no one else can use it.” She instructed.  Harry and Hermione had gone over some of his vision details that had gone wrong, and found ways to circumvent and plug up the holes that teenage wizards would never have seen their first go round.
“Everything is back the way it should be, Harry.  Vince has several detentions with Filch, but I don’t know if that will keep him occupied enough.” Draco replied.
With the days flowing against one another like a predictable tide, Harry had settled into a routine. He and Draco worked together on training during the weekend, even using the Potions lab at their house for some of the practical potions. Draco was a quick learner, and without all the homework, he was progressing rapidly on learning spells, counters, and potions. Harry had planned on giving him a mock OWLs test near the end of February so they would know where he needed to work on things.  Draco stood by while Harry practiced harnessing the powers he had already learned.  Harry practiced with the fire of the earth several times, leaning on his bond with Draco to balance and protect him.  He was soon able to call the fire and control it by the beginning of February.
“We have everything ready,” He said as he pulled out the papers he needed her to sign, “These are if you choose to file for divorce.  Mum set up property not far from here, its warded and there is money… If you let me, I can tell you how to invest it so you do not have to work.  You and Dudley can get out of here.  That is if you want to.”
“Move out the way Greg!” Draco shouted, pointed his wand directly at Vince’s head, “Incarcerous!”  Ropes flew out of his wand and wrapped his attacker quickly.  The force of the will behind the spell had sent so many ropes that Vincent looked like a mummy.
“I got some things to explain to Draco, I’ll catch you guys later ok?” Harry explained.
“Good morning Pansy, Is Draco still asleep or is he roaming?” Harry asked trying to keep his tone jovial.
Draco shivered from his toes to his head, just those two words, flared his whole body, bringing a blush, he was sure imprinted on his face.
Back in the Gryffindor common room Hermione was pacing. She was waiting for Harry so that she could tell him what her research had found.
“Ahh, well as you can see, if we talk nicely, I have nothing bad to say to provoke you.” Harry said, “Want to start over, on the right foot?” he offered his hand as a gesture of goodwill.
“Dobby is an elf, everyone in the Dark Lord’s company would never think such a position would be given to one such as he. Dobby would consider it the greatest honor… and I owe him…” Harry’s eyes started to water for a moment before he breathed in and called them back.
Draco flushed bright red as he looked over it, “She used those words?” he asked softly.
Severus positioned himself opposite Harry.  His Cruciatus was very strong, he only hoped Harry’s demonstration went well… He looked to the headmaster one more time and received the nod.
“You're not going to leave me hanging to go be with the Weasleys are you?” Sirius sounded concerned.
“That was Mr. Malfoy, not Draco.  If you treat Draco as if he were his father, what makes you any more different than Professor Snape with how he treats us because he was terrorized by Gryffindors while he was in school?  And Professor Snape is working on it, now that it has been mentioned we are not them.” Harry cajoled.
“Did you even get out of bed today?” Harry asked, amusement in his voice.
Just a small perceptible relaxing of the mouth indicated he had said the right thing.
“You are looking quite content, Draco… anything you wish to divulge?” Blaise pried, ever the one to search out news.
Draco had decided to sit with Harry for breakfast that morning.  The conversations around the table were normal everyone chatting about the restriction and the loss of Quidditch.  Ron groused more than most, he really had been planning on doing so much better to get on the team.  Hermione tried to engage Draco into conversation on their previous potions class, which started a whole new round of chatter amongst the table.
“I should be the teacher… you two are horrible...Should be able to exit a floo without so much dust and soot.” He said smiling the entire time.
“I want to create a fidelius charm for our home.” Harry said, thinking hard. He knew the wards were strong, and the earth’s power would help. But this would just give him a small amount of peace.
Draco was breathless, though from the incredible sensation of Harry holding him, or the new way of travel that was exhilarating, he wasn’t sure.  When Harry let go, and Draco felt the loss, the heated imprint of Harry’s arms and body lingered.  Harry spoke in parseltongue again, to a very large door with snakes that moved.  Draco shivered once again, that voice was like a silken cocoon flowing over his skin delivering pleasure all over his body.
“If nothing comes of this, I want no more discussion about this in my house.” She stated.
Green eyes danced dangerously, "Tell me what you want." One knee pressing hard into Draco's hardness.
“I am no longer a young innocent boy, headmaster.  I do not have to act as one at all times, but being a part of these meetings could be crucial.” Harry impressed.
Draco turned into the strong arms that waited for him and drifted to asleep, knowing now... all darkness and grey was gone.  As long as he was Harry's, he would be alive and free from the Iris of the Malfoy life.
“You want to know what I’m keeping from the minister...I think its time you know.” Harry said.
She stood still, “Well? go ahead then… get it over with.”
“And our secret keeper?” Draco asked.
“Thoughts?” Draco asked, blowing softly on Harry’s back.  The smooth skin was soothing.  Harry had disposed of his shirt and shoes later on during their flight frolicking.  Draco placed cool kisses against the heated skin.  A very slight sheen of sweat could be seen just between the shoulder blades.  Draco reached up and traced bits of wetness, his fingers playing down Harry’s back towards the edge of Harry’s trousers… Harry’s breathing was starting to get more ragged.
“Thank you for coming.  I need both of you for testing purposes.  All the charms work perfectly so there will be no damage to your persons, but I need to test a couple of scenarios.  One in which Professor Snape will be standing next to the webbing, and you, the headmaster will need to cast a spell at him, one I will try to use one of my charms on.  I need to find the right protective charm that will block a powerful spell, and also push Severus back against my webbing.  I have three in mind, but will need to test each one.” Harry explained.
Harry moved closer and sat down on the soft couch next to Ron and just looked at him expectantly.
“It is Sept 12, 1995, Harry.” Dumbledore offered, waiting to see what the boy would say before he asked him some obvious questions.
“Then you rarely saw me out of the company of others. I can be what I want, when I am alone. I am tired of fighting, and tired of the stress.” Draco replied with a resigned sigh.
“Yes, now I don’t know.  They were such a beautiful part of myself, I know that path is closed to me, that is one part that leaves me to wonder if my choice to accept being the Augur is what I should choose.  If I reject the power, I will forget and all will revert and play out as it was in my vision.  I miss my kids, they were beautiful, and wonderful.  Watching them grow was the best part, the chaos of the noise, the fighting, the laughing, the tears and the pains… it was all worth it just being with them.  If I choose to accept, and live a different life, I may not have them.  It’s a tough decision.” Harry sighed under the weight of it all.  The constriction in his heart was painful.  His children were a world unto themselves, they were his world.
“The colors meant something didn’t they?” Severus asked in a quiet tone.
Those piercing eyes reached inside Draco.  They seemed to connect to the part of him that still burned since his last touch.  Draco inhaled sharply to steady his voice, “I have heard about that kind of vision only happening once.”
“Petunia.”
Harry pulled a coin from his pocket, it was similar to what Hermione and Harry had been working on for the defense club.  “Mr. Malfoy, contact your son as you like.  For communication with me, use this.  No one but you can touch it and activate its abilities once I finish the charm.  You can press it when you need to convey something, either speak into it privately, or press it in your pocket and I will hear what is going on around you.  Press twice if you need to portkey to a safe place.  Keep it with you always.” Harry instructed as he placed the coin in Mr. Malfoy’s palm.  He cast the binding charm, to allow Mr. Malfoy’s magical signature to be imbedded into the coin.
Harry got up and headed down to the dungeons, hoping the professor would have a moment for him to ask about some ingredients.
Harry stumbled on a step during the ascent.  Draco caught him to help him from falling.
Harry demonstrated the wand movement to cast the surrounding shield charm.  Today was set for meditation, to visualize the shield charm cast and to learn to touch it.  Harry himself sat with the Professor, working with his own charm to strengthen his wall barriers.  The meditation was calming, his mind was working to funnel his magic along the protection path, honing it so that it is instinctual.  The more practiced, the more honed that protection path, the quicker the response to an attack, and the stronger the shield.  Professor Snape had a few difficulties understanding the concepts, so Harry walked him through it in his mind, showing him how to pull the shield, how to thicken it and how to stroke it with his mind for familiarity.
“Sure, well only a little, something in History of magic, but I think I napped with the rest of the class that day, I only remember that Merlin was one, and they are seer’s or something to that effect.”
Harry felt when Draco walked in the door, everything in him was tuned to Draco.  He lifted his eyes to capture the beautiful grey ones that searched for his own.  Harry never noticed the upturn of Ron’s lips at his actions.  Ron and Hermione were getting up to leave, greeted Draco pleasantly as they left.  They had treated him like a true friend.  Harry was so proud of his friends, their acceptance of Draco had not been easy, but they did it for him.
Harry looked at her for a moment, and saw Draco blush out of the corner of his eye. “At the moment only friendship. I am not known for focusing my attention in multiple areas.  I am interested in exploring the option you presented me with, but my main focus is Voldemort.”
Harry also mentioned that he would need both the Headmaster and Professor Snape’s help when he was ready to test his project.  Dumbledore assigned him a room in the third-floor corridor, close to where Harry met Fluffy in his first year. The headmaster also agreed to help Harry with whatever he needed to test his project.  When Severus finally arrived, he and the headmaster moved off to the side to observe.
It was early February during one of Harry and Draco’s private practice times that Harry felt the telltale tingle of Lucius activating the communication coin…
Draco was nervous as he stripped and folded his clothes.  He put everything on the chair in the corner and knelt at the foot of the bed.  So much anxiety was running through his veins.  He needed this, everything about this he needed.  He could see how much control he had tried to hold onto in his life.  So much so, that he had lost so much of himself to the life he lived.  His words and actions were driven by his life and his past.  Draco had felt so much in the past few hours.  Harry had been a driving force in his life for so long, negative for the most part, but if he had only opened his eyes sooner, he could have missed so much pain.  He could see the beauty in this surrender, he just wished it would last beyond this one night. He fought for so long and could see that he had caused his own pain and needed Harry to take it away.
A/N~(Look up Tasseography, or Tessomancy for the tea leaves meanings if you must)
Draco had looked to Harry, and remembered that one touch in the woods.  That cleansing touch that seemed to ignite a heart that had shriveled long ago.  It was with this thought that his Patronus entered the room, he opened his eyes and smiled.  Had he tried before his friendship with Harry, either he would never have been able to cast one, or it would not represent his tie to the great lion of Gryffindor?  Others seemed to understand only one significance, his allegiance, but Hermione’s knowing gaze found his silver one, and he blushed down to his toes.
Her son’s face with tinged with red, forehead creased and his silver eyes were blazing when he turned back to her.  She watched his face fall into concern when he looked at her.
“Look at me.” Severus said, his voice pitched low, seductive and coaxing. It was like coaxing a little hurt animal to trust him.
Harry turned that over, it did feel as if he knew what to say to people, and knew when not to tell them some things.  “It’s not like the imperious, forcing them is it?” Harry was concerned about forcing people against their will, he would if needed, and he knew that.  Gringotts was the perfect example, but it left a bitter taste in his mouth.  Controlling people is not what he wanted, leading where the people had a choice was what made better sense.
Harry looked at all three of them and began, “You are aware that Mrs. Malfoy imparted a certain coin to me?” all Malfoy heads nodded, “Not only did she gift me with a way back to a safe place, but with knowledge that I had not previously been aware of with or without my Augur vision.  She gave me another gift,” Draco started to blush.  Harry understood that to mean he had not said anything, “This gift allows me an opportunity to help your family in a plan that makes sense, but I do not manipulate people.  I want your input and your suggestions.” Each stared at him intently, eyes not moving, “Your son was waiting for me on the other end of that coin.”
“Molly...give the boy some air.” The headmaster said with a chuckle.
He couldn’t lower himself for Potter.  Then he thought of the pain his mother was in and sighed.  It was only words.  He could write the words at least.  He clenched his jaw and wrote the few words Potter had asked for.
“Potter without his friends, what they desert you?” Malfoy asked, contempt in his voice.
But this time the pain was on Severus, when the words “goodbye” slipped from his lover’s mouth. He found his breath stolen, his chest frozen, his heart pounding in his ears. He wanted to shrink and fade away… But Severus did not shrink… He used all his powers of intimidation he could muster and faced the mutt who could shatter him with mere words.
“Protection, Projection and Compassion” His hand traced three white runes.
Harry pulled the covers over them.
Draco screamed Harry’s name when he felt that amazing tongue dart inside him.  The euphoria was overtaking him and he needed release.
Harry met with the Headmaster and Severus on Thursday evening.  Severus and Albus stared up at the large archway and the intricate netting that covered the massive opening from top to bottom.  The webbing glistened like a multifaceted diamond.  Harry walked out from behind the huge arch and looked up at them and smiled.
Harry ran into a few students, and tried to keep a normal face, especially when he came in contact with those that had died, or those he had become friends with in the ministry. He did not know what to do now, the knowledge he had was vast, compared to where he was now. He wasn’t sure what he would do if he saw Ginny though, they had begun talking about divorce when he left, she had fallen for an old love… someone she would start dating this next year in fact. It didn’t hurt like he thought it would. They had fallen out of love, so the relief was palatable. Though, not having James, Lily or Albus pained him. Would he still have them with someone else?
“This is a gift bestowed by our family when a great service has been rendered, each adult carries one and only one and it is passed down if never gifted. The coin is special, it is charmed to take the person gifted, to their other half, or in absence of that a safe place.” Draco whispered, his eyes dropped their hold.
Draco looked up, letting his eyes meet those emerald ones.  Such warmth, and care met his own.  Draco smiled brightly, “Of course.  I got to talk to Greg.  I’ll see you later...”
“Let me guide you, Sir.” Harry said, beckoning Severus to follow.
Harry just smiled up at the Professor, after yesterday’s reliving of the vision events, he was just glad to be near the old man.  Harry paused, “Can I hug you?” he asked giving in to his basic need.  Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled as he stood up and came around the desk.  There was always something about this young man that made him care more than any other student.  Harry embraced the man, another wave of relief swept over him, it was like the present was washing away the pain of the past, or vision in his case.
Harry was sitting on his bed, thinking of how big a coward he had been.  Harry had run from Draco earlier that morning.  When they had broken the handshake, Harry turned and ran back to the castle.  He had not even looked back.  He admonished himself for his childlike behavior and the fear he felt that made him run.
“Harry please.” He begged.
“She won’t...She is gunning for his job.” Harry said with a smile on his face.
He really like the man he was beginning to know, the butterflies never seemed to go away, whenever Draco would look at him.  Harry liked it, he felt alive.  The trio had been dubbed the golden quartet. Which Harry smiled at since he now related it to Draco’s hair.  Thankfully there had been no further attacks on Draco, but he still worried.  Draco had become important to him.
“I will. I will visit today, lets get Dobby and do the charm. Then I will go see Severus, I will need him with me for this.” Harry moved to let Draco’s head slide so the blond was laying on the couch.
Harry was more than happy to sign the document. Harry put his wand, into his robes, and signed the document. After he finished signing, the document activated the portkey charm and Harry was whisked away.
“Good Afternoon, Draco.  I trust your weekend is going well.” He spoke just a hint louder than normal, so not to be mistaken.
“I don’t want to be jealous…” Draco started, but a feeling of overwhelming possessiveness swept over him.
Draco was quiet, he really didn’t know what to say.  For years he had envied Harry, the easy way the boy seemed to find glory, and how people flocked around him.  Draco had wanted that for himself.  The picture Harry painted, did not sound so appealing anymore.  How could one live such a caged existence?
“I’m going to have to write to my Aunt.” Harry said with an almost monotone voice. Draco sat up, looking at him puzzled.
Draco’s eyes softened to a dove grey, “Not anymore, I would rather be happy right here than be as I always was without you.”  The sincerity of his tone was pure sweetness to Harry.
There was a bet.  And for the first time ever… Draco Malfoy lost.  The prince of Slytherin himself had lost a bet.  Now he had to pay up.  This would not be easy or fun.  The rules stated he had to kiss his worst enemy.  How in the world could he manage that?
Severus noted Potter standing in the doorway. His lecture was just about complete and he could let the third years on their own once he was done to attend to whatever Potter needed.
Harry bowed his head only, and accepted the offer.
Harry looked at her and smiled, “I trained as an Auror, and etiquette was one of our required classes.” He grinned as he said it, “Your actions towards me in the end of the war was the only redeeming actions that saved you and your son, but not your husband. I think a meeting with Headmaster Dumbledore is in order to find out the best solutions for how to help your family. We don’t have much time before actions are needed. But I do have a question that I hope you can answer. Who has access to your sister’s vaults while she is in Azkaban?”
“No idea, but I hope he incorporates new teaching strategies to engage the others.” Harry replied leaving Draco puzzled.  But no reply was to be had, the back of the room was filled with a resounding bang as the door was shut, and Professor Snape made his usual fearful entrance into the room.
He sealed the chamber once he got out and went to bed.
Draco was rising higher on the wings of pleasure.  His body was throbbing and singing with exquisite need. His own hands were not lazy, they were mapping each plane of Harry's chest. He would remember each line and angle.  Savor the sexy texture. Draco caressed Harry's face lowering his own lips to sip from Harry. The kiss was slow, languid and calming. He wanted their bodies to breathe. Climbing off Harry,  he knelt down and locked gazes with this incredible man.
Once they were gone, Harry, Draco, Hermione and Ron, began to eat lunch.  Harry always loved a meal at Hogwarts.  It was always full of just about anything you could want.  Sandwiches of all kinds, hot meat, gravy, potatoes, and of course Treacle Tart. Harry never passed up Treacle Tart.
“You know nothing Vince.  I chose my side, I will stay. Now let me pass.” Draco’s eyes narrowed, his hand twitching while holding his wand.
For his part, Professor Snape seemed genuinely interested. “You get the bottom ingredients here, I will go to my personal stores for these top ones.” Severus said as he walked out of the supply closet. He was at ease, the usual animosity between them had vanished. Though Harry looked young, his demeanor was that of a colleague, so working with him was easier than just a student.
“NO!” Severus pressed against Sirius harder. His entire body pinned the other man hard against the wall, “You will not leave me. Not for some silly conversation with a depressed werewolf.”
“Excuse me, Professor. I need to speak to the Headmaster alone.” Harry stated, he sounded dignified even.
Hermione had known, after Harry had pointed out all the ways she and Ron fought that meant they were suited, she knew.  There had been no spark for with Harry and Ginny, they had let their relationship fizzle.  So the letters and marriage proposals started coming in by the droves.  But Harry wasn’t interested.  Then a few weeks ago, in a similar fray like today, she saw it, the spark.  The way Harry and Draco had interacted; there was a spark in their eyes.
“Are you able to concentrate on the lesson this evening?” Severus asked.
Ron’s face turned as red as a tomato, Hermione choked on the drink she had been sipping, and Seamus just started doubling over in laughter.  At least someone go the joke.
Harry had expected to land back in his own room, but found himself slowly descending in a small outskirt clearing just inside the Forbidden Forest. Upon his feet crunching the fallen leaves, he turned abruptly to point his wand at the person in his peripheral vision who stood up from near the trees.
Harry thought about how the next three weeks would be nerve wracking, waiting for Mr. Weasley to accomplish his task…Waiting for his order to arrive, and he still was worried about his reaction to Draco.  So much ignited in that kiss, and before the kiss with just that look.  If he wasn’t careful, he could fall easily.  Not that falling for the person you're supposed to be with would be a bad thing, but Harry wanted more than passion, he wanted perfection.
Harry was trying to get comfortable, but he couldn’t gain the rest he had hoped for.  No position felt comfortable, blanket bunched up, pillows fluffed, and still nothing.  He tossed and turned, and yet his mind would not turn off.  So he got up to finally accomplish the one thing he was looking forward to, yet scared of.  He padded over to his trunk, and fished out the mirror that had been long forgotten in his vision.  He moved then back to his bed and cast a simple privacy charm.
Once inside, the silence was deafening. He could take his time, there was no war, no Malfoy, nobody to rescue. Harry let his senses flare out. Feeling for the darkness inside him, calling for the darkness of the diadem. He felt the pull and followed. The box was easy to locate. He cast a disillusionment charm on it, and shrunk it and put it in his pocket. Harry then cast an impervious deludes charm on himself, to protect him from the delusions of the dark taint inside the diadem.
“I’m not sure which would be true, Draco.” ‘This could be construed as a safe place’, Harry thought “and I already know the path which I chose for love was the wrong one.”
Harry gently pushed. And Severus found himself standing in his classroom, wand still pointed at the boy. He lowered it immediately.
“Vernon Dursley.”
“That is a practical view, I suppose, Mr. Potter.” Severus offered.
“Ron’s mum called Dumbledore, we need to go.” She said hurriedly before turning away and walking quickly towards the library entrance.
“Do you love me?” it was a whisper.
Harry nodded, that was probably best.  They had much to discuss and plan.
Harry moved to stand behind Draco, wrapped both his arms around Draco’s waist, and then they moved as one, white smoke and a trail following them and Harry flew down the entrance and landed them safely at the bottom.
“Mr. Potter, what brings you here?” Severus inquired.
Draco was at his wits end waiting for Potter’s reply.  He had been nicer, there was no way the man could take offense now.  Unless he just wanted to be pompous. The bird tapped at his window and he let it in quickly and tore open the parchment.  It was his letter that returned with another small addition.
Harry palmed himself through his trousers, his erection straining harder than he ever remembered.
“Her son.” Harry said simply.  That knowing look came into Dumbledore’s eyes.
Draco shivered at the request.  He did not enter Harry often, but when he did it was exquisite every time.  His fingers trembled as they unbuttoned his trousers and let them fall…
“You were, and still are, the Half-blood prince, Professor.” Harry fully turned to face him, pinning him with Lily’s eyes. “You are a great Potions Master, yet if you taught us, how you taught yourself in these notes, we could grow to be just as passionate as you on the subject. This book is brilliant, and should be re-published with your notes and revisions. It is because of this book, I came to like potions better.”
“I was hoping age would be an issue.” Ron groused.
“From your description Mr. Potter, I knew it was dark and most likely held a dark curse.  Dark artifacts are oppressive, and finding it was not difficult, carrying it out and to here was more difficult.” She stated with little emotion.
“Working on it, now go to sleep,” Harry whispered lazily.
His spiders arrived in the room on Thursday afternoon.  Ron refused to even come and watch, Hermione feigned research… Understandable really.  Draco stayed though, he would sit in the corner and take in everything Harry was doing.
“Here is a list with definition of the spells I plan on teaching, followed by a schedule I have drawn up, and a list of students that have been selected to participate in our ‘defense club’.  The logistics are described on the last page, as to how we plan avoiding detection.  Professor Umbridge is somewhat malleable now, but I am not sure how long she can be trusted.  I trust you will inform the head of houses only for those students involved, the less they know the better, but teachers should be informed.” Harry explained and handed the papers over to the headmaster.
“And if she disagrees?” the headmaster asked.
Over the next few weeks, things seemed to go smoothly. Harry of course excelled in all his classes, stunning even the unflappable Professor Snape. Nearing the first of October, Harry decided to talk to Professor Snape.
“The Tuerivelurna charm is one I have been working on for this purpose.  It is a charm that blocks a spell, protects the object and pushes the object at the same time.  It worked as I had hoped, the blocking and protection portion of the spell, allows the curse to look like it had struck the intended victim.  So it can only be used to protect someone else, not yourself.” Harry smiled as he explained, it took him the second half of the first week to work out that charm.
“What if I don’t want perfect?” Draco gasped out desperately.  Harry moaned as Draco moved against him, showing what he really wanted.
“Have you discussed my offer?” Harry asked, looking directly at Narcissa.
Severus nodded. “Tonight then Mr. Potter” Then he stated louder, “Detention Mr. Potter for your insolence.” Most heads turned to look at the pair in the doorway. Harry for his own preservation, hid his smile well, bowed his head and shuffled away.
Harry leaned in close, slowly, not wanting Draco to move.  It was like trying to capture a butterfly.  Their eyes closed as their lips met for a moment, just a small touch, gentle and innocent.  It was clarity put to flesh.  Harry moved back slowly intently staring into Draco’s eyes. Their lips smoldered where they had touched
Draco looked at those behind him, relief was palatable in that moment.
Severus pulled out of Sirius’s mind. He was seething. He wanted to shake Sirius and get him to see sense, he also wanted to pummel Lupin for his interference. Evidently the wolf was miserable and wanted company. Severus moved towards one of his cabinets he had not needed in a long time, and pulled out a small purple vial. He walked back to the mutt who was staring off into space, evidently still reeling from the fact Severus just entered his mind.
Harry didn’t last long in the Library.  He had only found the same information Hermione referred to… Maybe Sirius can shed some light, or Professor Snape.  Harry had some other planning to do, and he needed to start working on how he would save Sirius from dying. And Harry needed to start working out his defense club strategy for the next day.  So Harry approached Madam Pince just before the library closed to check out a couple of catalogues.  He had an idea as he looked in the catalogs, and found exactly what he needed.  Ron, won’t be happy, and probably won’t help, but this just might do what he needed.  Armenian Silk Spiders.  Harry scratched his order and sent it off.  He would need to talk to the headmaster to commandeer an empty room.
Severus woke to hear the offending knock… He did not want to rise from the heat of Sirius’ body. He reached for his wand, spoke a charm to speak to the intruder. “Who is it and are you dying?”
“Was that necessary?” She asked a little scared now.
Harry moved forward, before his courage faded, and wrapped his arms around the Potion’s master and hugged him.  A burden he did not understand fell away in that moment.  It took a longer while, before Snape reciprocated, with a quick squeeze and a light pat on the back.  That would do for now.  Snape was not one to understand affection, nor how to reciprocate it. But he would learn, learn for Lily, and learn for Harry.
“Why are we going into a girl’s bathroom?”
Theodore understood the implications, his father will kill him for this, but Draco would not change sides without reason.  And the reason may be the key to his own survival.  He walked over to stand beside Pansy, “Good choice, Harry is more powerful than I estimated.” Pansy whispered.  Theodore understood her position, and shared it.
Severus held his face, not flinching only breathing. This boy, had gone beyond. “We will see Mr. Potter, and you're welcome.”
Severus looked at the young man, not yet removing his hand, afraid to let go and watch Harry slip away again. “What can I do to help?”
“Stay?” Harry asked softly.
“What is your name.”
Draco felt as if his whole soul was being cleansed with the touch of an angel.
4. No revenge actions will be taken if discussion does not end favorably for you.
On Monday during lunch, Harry received an owl from his Aunt.  He smiled at that, she was settled in her house.  She expressed thanks, and offered an invitation to tea… she wanted to finally get to know her nephew.  Harry’s chest warmed at the idea.  Harry jotted off a few things...Investments he thought she could make, to include the twins…If she wanted to be comfortable, some would pay off sooner and others later.  He tied it on the owl and let it have a piece of his chicken before it took off once again.
“So what about Voldemort?” Severus asked as they walked the road back to the castle.
“I too have needed some time to get used to your new abilities and knowledge, Harry.” Dumbledore started, “I have seen you as this little boy for so long, and on the outside, you still are.”
Harry smiled at her and addressed Ron, “We need to let old childish things go.  I may have grown up more than you two because of my vision, but I can at least point you in the right direction.  He wasn’t that bad as an adult, and if we befriend him now, I think it can turn out much better.”
“I know that.  Sometimes the other order members try to remind me I am no longer a teenager.” Sirius responded with an answering smile of his own.  Harry laughed.
“It was Ginny, wasn’t it,” Draco asked quietly.
“Since I turned 11, I have found out how famous I am for something I had no control over.  From that point on, I have had no real freedom to just be ‘Harry’.  Always the ‘boy who lived’, the ‘chosen one’, the ‘savior of the wizarding world’, etc… never just me.  Now I get to add the title of ‘Augur Saeculum’ to the list of who I am without being me.” Harry’s eyes had lost their brilliance when he looked at Draco, “You and everyone else want all this power and fame, but you don’t realize that with it, you are just a shell of who you could be if you didn’t have to be something to everyone all the time.  I had hoped this vision would allow me to do things earlier so we all could have a somewhat normal life, but for me that seems impossible now.”
“What I am trying to say, is that I am the new Augur.” Harry stated hastily.
Harry pulled Draco closer to him and sat down on one of the armchairs.  Draco was straddling Harry’s lap and the friction was delicious.  Harry took possession of Draco’s mouth once again, reveling in the sweet decadence of the kiss.  This time, his hands did not stay on Draco’s face, they moved to shoulders, and buttons, working them out of their holes.  Harry needed to feel the soft skin beneath those robes, one small patch of neck was open to him and Harry took it, letting his teeth sink down as he tasted the skin.  Draco held on tighter and cried out from the pure ecstasy of the bite.
Severus was never one to turn down a good idea.
This was one of those tangible moments.  Harry usually could not afford to let those happen when he had important plans to take care of, but this time, this moment he took for himself.
Harry reached and bowed over her hand.
After lunch Harry had a free study period which he used to relax in his room. Mr. Weasley would arrive to meet with him Friday evening, in Dumbledore’s office. No doubt the Headmaster wanted to know what was going on. There was a tap at his window that brought his attention. He opened it to let in a very elegant owl. He pulled a treat from his nightstand and offered it to the bird. He took the note and watched the bird neatly eat the treat, then fly out of the window.
“Get Professor Snape...” Draco directed Greg, his voice was strained with pain.
“What do you propose, Mr. Potter? My family and I will consult, but I will ensure they follow the path that leads to their wellbeing. Whatever I did to help you, I am thankful you are here now. Our family is very honored to be graced by the council of the next Augur Saeculum.” Narcissa answered, extending her beautiful pale hand.
Harry had drawn up a list, that included Draco and others he knew would be trustworthy, and needed the training.  He also included a few younger years that had Hermione looking at him quizzically, but she deferred to him that decision.  She was especially reluctant to allow the Creevey brothers, but Harry was adamant they stay.  That was one loss that had struck him to the bone because of how young he was at the time.  Their first meeting would be held within the school at an undisclosed location, Their parchments would transport them to the training location and back to their dorms at the appointed time, so no ‘rule breaking’ would be an issue.  Of course this time, Harry charmed things himself, having had years of practice working on untraceable portkeys.  He would also inform the Headmaster, Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall of their activities, and provide each of them with the list of charms, curses, and counters he would be teaching.  This should allow for any necessary interventions where needed.
She grinned back, she had not been liking how Lavender had been looking at Ron lately, and maybe, she would forget her pride and just ask Ron out herself.
For Harry the three weeks had been unnerving, classes were easy to get through.  It was the waiting, and the wanting that ate at Harry the most.  He had no time to devote elsewhere since his free time was taken up by his plan to save Sirius.  It was easy enough to get the empty classroom and set it up a replica of the veil portal.  The hard part was the daily monitoring of the progress of the spiders.  Their web had to be intricate, had to be tight.  Harry was working with several charms and spells to replicate what his mind was conjuring, but every time he thought he had the right ones, nothing worked right together.  His only consolation had been that Draco had been there.  Silently supporting him, diligently taking care of him.
“Who?” Narcissa asked patiently.
Harry nodded, why didn’t he remember that class?  Probably because he slept through each one with Professor Binns… “Well, one sign is they receive a vision where they live for some years, and gain knowledge of that.  They have to accomplish certain tasks to prove their power.”
Severus groaned… Damn the Dark Lord for his plots and Damn Harry for saving people… He moved slowly to get out of the bed. Then leaned over and pushed on Sirius’ shoulder…
“Justice” red flames flowed from one hand to trace the rune.
Draco sat down and turned to Harry amid the chatter that had grown in the room.  There were glares from some of the other slytherin’s at the change of seating.
“I thank you for that consolation.  That would be something we would look forward to.  Send a message with details if everything is acceptable with my cousin.” Mrs. Malfoy agreed.
“Are you cheating on me.” was the first question she asked.  It was the one burning in her gut.
Draco felt the bite of pain as his head was pushed further back.  Harry’s voice was dark and slipped over him. He moaned as the pleasure-pain of it all coursed through him.  Only truth slipped from his mouth, potions, and mother forgotten under the onslaught of sensation.
He opened the note to a very beautiful handwriting.
“I’m not treating you like a girl, I’m showing you that you are important enough for me to be considerate of.” Harry explained softly, watching Draco sink into the chair, and pushing it in.
“Now you sound like a father…” Sirius said, not trying to mock, but Harry’s face turned into sorrow, “you were a father in your vision?” his voice softer at the question.
“It wasn’t the connections, Professor Potter.  I know he came to be convinced fully expecting to turn you down but was impressed so much that he left happy to participate.  They usually avoid these settings...You are quite the emissary.” She praised.
Albus noded to Severus, who took Ron and Madam Pomfrey and ushered them out of the area. Harry felt his pants for his wand, and cast an impervious privacy charm. Albus was intrigued as only Aurors are taught this charm for interrogation purposes, not something Hogwarts or it’s texts taught.
“Did he see the snake killed?” Harry asked, knowing that if he did, there was a possibility that the Dark Lord could see into Mr. Malfoy’s memories.
"Tell me..." Harry's voice rasped out as he set a punishing pace.
Harry nodded, “I’m the rumor mill for the school, what can I say.”  He led them through the many gathering areas up towards the stairs leading to the Astronomy tower.
Draco found Blaise lounging in the common room.
Draco was shaking, “What do you want to do?” he asked quietly.
Arthur looked very serious and looked to Albus who only nodded, his face grim. “Yes, I will make sure to follow the instructions perfectly.”
“But…”Sirius started.
“Why me?” She asked, even as understanding started to flow over her… He had chosen her and knew of her ambitions.  This revelation was an endorsement.
Harry had watched uncertainty and guilt pass over Draco’s features.  A darkness crept into those beautiful eyes, and he had looked away.  Harry could not bear to see it.  Harry wanted Draco to see, really see that they were past everything.  The skin was warm under his finger, the dejected look he saw when they locked eyes hurt, made him angry that Draco did not see his own worth.  Harry wanted, needed, longed for Draco, in a way he never had for anyone before.  All he could do was stare, and fall into the ice he wanted to melt so badly.
Ron was still trying to get his head around the thought about being friends with Malfoy, but Hermione chimed in, “Well you could be right, regardless of what transpired in your vision, you make sense. Doesn’t he Ron?” She asked, looking at him expectantly.  Hermione had accepted many of the changes about Harry, her friend was still there, he trusted them implicitly still, and imparted great knowledge.  She felt privileged, though she still had to deal with juvenile behavior from Harry from time to time.
Harry held him tighter.  “Took care of that before I took care of you.”
“Evidently your friendship did not sit well with one of his housemates.  He is mending, and that housemate has been reprimanded.  Professor Snape has it in hand.  Just be on guard.” Dumbledore warned.  Harry nodded.
Harry started to gain a sense of foreboding as he walked towards the staircases, he lingered against the stone wall, letting his eyes dart around for the danger he felt.  A shift in the soft light that barely reached a dark alcove on the opposite side of the hall, gave him all the time he needed to shift into a stance to bind whomever hid for the ambush.  His hands weaved their pattern fast, yet gracefully, upon hearing the harrumph of noise, he knew the subject was restrained.  Harry walked over to the hidden alcove to see his enemy.  Pansy Parkinson was struggling against her bonds, her eyes wild and furious as they focused on Harry.
Turning he watched as his teacher pace about in his usual billowy manner.  The black gaze turned on him, pinning him to the spot.
Her eyes widened and almost bugged out of her head as she looked at him, really looked at him.  Her almost horse features became more prominent as she pursed her lips.  Her long neck craned around as she let her eyes roam the neighborhood and then back to him.
Harry smiled back. “Thank you for considering and an honest answer.  Good day, Pansy.”
Draco felt the hot breath on his skin and moaned. Each breath did not stop at his flesh, it seemed to permeate and travel through it and pool low into his groin.  Harry parted those delicious globes and went for the prize.  He sent out a tentative lick and was lost in the absolute musk of Draco.  Draco’s skin was silky smooth, but his tongue found an even smoother tight ring.  He licked in slow circles, relishing the sexy noises flowing from his lover’s lips.
“Have you found the Gaunt home yet?” Harry asked, steering the conversation in another direction.
"I see you Draco Malfoy, for who you are." Harry told him not breaking the contact of either eyes or hands.  Slowly he pulled Draco closer.  The heated tears fell on Draco's face washing the blood and soot away in their path.  His hair was dark with soot, his face dark and damaged, but the streaks revealed pale skin underneath.  Harry's free arm encapsulated Draco, pulling the taller man to him.  They held on, this ride was not going to be easy, but together they would take on whatever life threw at them.  Draco knew that without Harry, he would be an empty shell once again.  Nothing they had been through for those many months stamped permanent, or even love or friendship.  Draco and Harry had just been.  Now Draco needed more.  "Where do you want to go from here?  I will follow no matter the choice." Draco whispered into Harry's ear. He felt the shiver, and his own body reacted to that.  "I died you know." Harry said.  Draco stiffened, the thought making his blood run cold. "I did not stay, as peaceful as it was. I had reasons to come back.  One of those reasons was you."  Harry revealed stretching just a bit to reach Draco's ear, "Do you want to go where I wish?"  His breath was heated as it spread out across the shell of Draco's ear, making the blond shiver involuntarily. A thumb caressed a stray tear and left a streak of pale skin as it was wiped away. "Do you want your blood to burn with mine?" Harry tantalized with his tongue as he spoke, tracing the outer shell of Draco's ear, causing Draco’s body to loosen, and Harry's arm to tighten. Draco could only nod, his throat was incapable of working, and the rest of his body was shaming him.  With Harry's tighter grip, Draco felt their bodies blink out of existence for just a moment before reappearing in a darkened room.
“I had already decided to include you on the next meeting Harry. I just needed time to get used to the idea.” The Headmaster relented with a small smile, as he turned back to his desk, and Harry nodded as he walked out the door.
“I wasn’t trying to keep it from you, I guess it just progressed quicker than I thought,” Harry said exasperated.
“Because I wanted your attention, your eyes on me, not on her.  I’m sorry, I know you loved her, she was kind, but she never saw you… not like I did… and you…you never saw me. I was angry, jealous, and I wanted to make you hurt like I did.  I’m sorry, I know I caused you pain, I’m sorry for pulling you here tonight and not asking.” Sirius bowed his head, he had finally relieved his burden, held for so many years. It was his main torture in Azkaban.
He maneuvered Draco up against one of the posts and positioned himself behind the sexy Slytherin.  He reached around, undid the clasp to the blonde’s trousers and pants, and slid them down while reveling in the softness of the skin as he skimmed the offending items off.  He held one leg for Draco to get one foot free and then the other.
“Wanted to talk to you ‘bout something.” Ron said quietly.
“You are so sexy like this.  No pride or arrogance to mar your eyes.” Harry whispered to Draco.  Waiting to see the blond’s response.
“That mutt cornered me at the last meeting practically begged me to forgive him, and then all of a sudden started to make logical sense on topics that usually he only had juvenile comments on.” Severus said with exasperation.
When Harry came in, he was accosted by Hermione. She took his arm and dragged him to the nearest couch. She cast the Impervious privacy charm this time, having learned from Harry just how to perform the complicated wand maneuver.
She felt honored.  Months ago she would have laughed in his face, or dismissed him entirely.  In her realistic world, there was no ‘sight’, nothing you couldn’t prove without good logic… She only hoped she could keep his good opinion.  He did not press her, and she left his office in a pensive state.
“I think so, but I don’t tell everything.  I seem to know what to say and when, but I know I am not supposed to tell everything to any one person, only revealing that which will help where I need it to.  In a way I feel like I’m manipulating people.  I don’t like that really.  But I do try to give them enough information to make an informed choice. I am not sure if I can talk about some of the tough stuff, like deaths with those who died, so I’m not sure.  The hardest part, is I still feel like an adult, though being a teenager is sort of coming back, I don’t think you really lose that when you grow up.” Harry laughed a little.  It was a like releasing a burden, just talking to Sirius.
The enemy was forgotten, only the angel that stood before him mattered.  “Let’s show the world then,” Harry, said, bending down to capture those lips once again, this time, he let the charm drop and he went for the whole package. Lips, body, heart, and soul.  His lips crashed down taking everything Draco was offering, losing himself in the heated cavern.  Tasting Draco, and ignoring the gasps behind them and they both clung to each other.
“Draco dear, what has happened to upset you?” She asked quietly.
“Can you plant a memory of me finding out and storming out? that’s what I wish I could do.” She said with a trembling voice.
Draco laughed, “Did you think that he would have given up flying even with getting older?  It seems that I forgot how much he loved this.  We will have to do this more often.”
“So …” He tried to say something to break the tension, but nothing came to him.  Instead he went for humor, “You going snogging today Ron?”
The man appeared, his dark hair barely brushed, and stubble all over his chin.
“For that, Professor, I want you to feel comfortable. I know prior to term, Professor Dumbledore asked you to teach me Occlumency, due to the visions from Voldemort I had been having. I no longer need the teaching, but wish to allow it nonetheless, and hopefully, put to rest this animosity, you have for me because my father mistreated you.” Harry stood back a few feet.
She looked at him as if seeing him for the first time, and stood up, and hugged him.  She wept on his shoulder and he let her.  His hands soothed her and he patted her back, it was the best he could do…A burden clung to his shoulders still, not yet ready to fall.
“No.  He arrived just after, and departed quickly after a few exchanges of spells.” Mr. Weasley informed them.
“Ahh Harry...I have someone for you to meet.” Dumbledore said as Harry entered the room.
Harry nodded, “I need to go, Sir.  I have a detention with Professor Snape in an hour.”
“It’s either that, or I subject you to my viewing them and listing things.  I am sure there are some you would rather keep private.” Harry said, a growing grin on his face, “And I further promise, not to tease.”
Harry blinked for a minute, then replied in a voice that was horse with strain, “Yes, why? Why did it bring me here?”
Harry laughed, “Make the move, Hermione.  He is too scared.  You two were made for each other.”
Pain lanced through Draco’s legs.  He was brought out of his peaceful slumber by another blow of a meaty fist to his ribs.  More pain, and a cracking occurred with the blow.  Vincent had raised his hand to deliver another blow, Draco cringed further into his bed, and then the boy was tackled by Greg who was just coming back into the dorm room.  Draco ached as he turned to reach for his wand.
Just as Ron was opening his mouth, Harry groaned, all eyes went to the bed.
“Don’t touch yourself,” Harry commanded.  Draco shook his head in understanding. He placed his hands behind his back and laid on them.
Hermione was curious about his look, but she knew better than to pry.  They spoke the password and the Gargoyle moved so they could walk up to the Headmaster’s office.  Hermione waited just outside the main office.
“That wasn’t supposed to happen,” Draco whispered.
“Me either, but we must.  I want everything to be perfect with you.” Harry explained his voice straining at the edge of his control.
“Do you know my history Harry?” Severus asked gently.
Harry turned around in the hall just before he got to the staircase leading to Gryffindor tower. Ron was following him. “Ron, Sorry. I didn’t mean to ignore you. I’ll need to talk to you and Hermione when we get back to the common room. It’s important.” Harry spoke softly. Ron nodded, “Of course. You alright mate?”
The handwriting was atrocious to say the least.  But at least he could read it.  Draco smiled at himself.  Well so far they were not attacking each other so that was good.  The new start could be just what they needed, though friends would be a problem on both sides.
“I have good news and some interesting news for you.” Hermione started talking immediately, “First this type of vision had, has been documented, but only a handful of times. The receiver of the vision is usually a person of great power, and it is the first sign of being the Augur Saeculum ‘Seer of the Age’. The last Wizard or Witch known as the Augur Saeculum was Merlin. The vision of living, as it is called and not many know about it, brings the Augur into a wisdom not found in his time. The Augur reveals parts of the vision that is why others don’t hear about the wizard living through it. All good things will come to pass such as was in the vision, unless expressly changed by the actions of the Augur. All dark events can be countered and changed, depending on the actions of the Augur. No small changes can affect the larger outcome, but a large change will only affect the negative. The Augur will have to study from the Librum Aetate ‘The Book of Ages’. It is passed from one Augur to another, revealed to the new Augur on the full moon of the Winter Solstice. You will have one full solstice cycle to right the greatest wrong from your vision in order to keep your power. Once you have completed your task and spent one year in study, an announcement will be made within your realm, and there will be expectations for your guidance. Your advice will be sought by those in power, but your choice will be free in who to help, and who to refuse. That means, Harry, that you will receive the book in two months’ time, and you have until June 21st of next year to complete your task to right the greatest wrong.” She was out of breath by the time she was done speaking.
Draco positioned himself, letting his own precum lubricate Harry’s entrance.  He pushed in and heard Harry groan in pleasure.  His own body captivated by the intense pressure being squeezed by Harry’s body.  He pulled out and pushed back in, absorbing the intensity of the heat of Harry.  All of Draco was centered on the joined part of their bodies.  His breath was slow, his heart was beating out of his chest.  The white heat of the pleasure was enough to bring tears to his eyes, he leaned forward and drew Harry upright.  He thrust in while reaching around and letting the drippings of Harry coat his hand.  He stroked each time he rocked his hips into Harry.  They were both making hissing noises, Draco bit down softly on Harry’s shoulder… Harry shuddered and spilled over Draco’s hand. The blond’s name spilling from an angel's lips.  Draco shuddered his own release when he felt Harry’s body clamp down on him taking him over the edge.
Albus stroked his beard.
Severus saw every emotion play across that face, based on the memories he witnessed he could guess what was going on in that mind.
Draco merely nodded, his head dizzy with the pain and the overwhelming musk coming from where he buried his face.  He let his hands skim Harry’s leg and moved to unzip the trousers.  He did not understand the desperation he felt, but he fumbled as he moved fast to free the prize he was fantasizing about.  Just when he caught sight of the purple head and thickness of Harry’s cock his head was jerked back slightly away.  He cried out and looked up into stormy green eyes.
“I won’t direct anything at you, Madam Bones.  I want you to see what I am, then I will answer your questions.” Harry said.  He placed his wand on the table.  She narrowed her eyes.
He reached out and grabbed the blond’s hands, lacing his fingers with ivory. Harry pushed and pulled those slender arms up above Draco’s head, while using his own body to push Draco tight against the stone wall.  The dark alcove hiding them from prying eyes.
“Your…” She stammered, unable to get the words out.
The opportunity presented itself later that day, just after 8th-year Potions.  Their normal Gryffindor/Slytherin squabble.  It was predictable really.  Every Tuesday and Thursday, as they filed out of the room, someone from either house would provoke the other, and the names would be called, a few pushes, and possibly a wand or two drawn... Same thing, different day.  Only this time, with his friends watching, Draco Malfoy would take it up a notch and get rid of his bet obligation.
“I’m sorry I was such a prick.  I don’t deserve this, you… But I need you.” Draco pleaded.
Severus was standing there staring as Sirius as if he had lost his mind.  Something in those words, struck him as true.  He couldn’t examine them now.  He couldn’t see what Black wanted him to see.  He needed time...Lots of time.
“Can we?” it was a soft whisper.  “Do you care what others see and say?” Harry asked, needing to know the answer.
Harry picked it up, his seeker reflexes had never diminished. “In due time, Professor. I have a safe place for it, and that is all you need to know for now. You will be informed later.”
Harry gathered himself and faced his Aunt.
“Either time has thrown me back, or since I was in Professor Trelawney's class, I must have had a vision. Can you live a lifetime in a vision Professor?” Harry asked, looking genuinely curious.
“Can I help you?” She asked as nicely as she could, her nose scrunching with uncertainty.
“Draco please… come into me tonight…” Harry begged… his cock was dripping on the ground.
Mrs. Weasley was about to object, but Mr. Weasley and Sirius both shook their heads.  Snape watched the display with a smirk.  The mutt knew, he was sure of it.  Albus addressed them all and let them know of Harry’s new status, with the added implication that should they be called upon, they should help any way they could.  All of them in the room knew the cost of interfering with an Augur and their mission.  The mission was all consuming for an Augur, any side ventures could cost the Augur the advantage and ultimately deprive every one of their guidance if the task was not complete.  And in this day and time their world needed guidance more than anything.  Severus was uniquely surprised that when the mutt spoke during the meeting he actually sounded sensible.  Though Severus never commented on it, he did note it. Sirius was also impeccably dressed tonight, Severus noted that too…unfortunately.
“Go to sleep...I love you...and no more whiskey.” Severus said as he pulled his lover closer and let them fall into a steady breathing pattern and soon sleep took them both.
“First, I will mention that I have recently found out that I have been given the power to be the next Augur Saeculum.” Harry noticed her eyes widened, “Last Month I was given a vision, where I lived out the last 20 or so years. To which end, I believe I owe you a life debt, even though your actions have not come to pass yet. Hence why I am here. I know you will do anything for your family. I am offering you my protection, and knowledge of how to keep your family not only safe, but out of the hands of the person who would destroy all you have built for yourself over the years. The name of Malfoy in the future will suffer greatly at the hands of Voldemort. Your husband will be imprisoned for crimes he has yet to commit, he will be demoralized by Voldemort. Your home will become the lair in which he resides. Your son will lose a very close friend, be forced to commit actions that will harm him mentally and get him hurt, but not killed. I will not tell you who wins, I want to know if you will make the decision, to save your family without knowing?” Harry explained, looking sharply at her, waiting for her to take it all in.
Harry sighed. He would live the same path over and all those people who died would still die, if he rejected this new power and role. If he chose to change things, he chose to keep the power and responsibility.
Draco spit into his hand and reached for Harry’s cock, stroking it and lubricating it.   He hovered for just a moment, before slowly lowering himself on that rock hardness.  Both men hissed in rapture as they became locked together.  Harry leaned forward and planted soothing kisses along Draco’s chest.  His hands stroking Draco’s back lovingly.  Those tiny buds whispered for attention and Harry did not resist, taking one of Draco’s nipples into his mouth and flicking his tongue over it.  Draco’s head fell back, and he lifted himself up and crashed down, causing both mean to groan loudly.
Greg looked like a puppy dog waiting for attention as Draco spoke.  The two boys looked over at the occupants of the table then back at Draco.  Blaise was not a follower, but he assessed situations and took from them the position of advantage where he could.  Draco’s eyes were no longer cold, harsh, or calculating.  Blaise looked to Harry who sincerely looked at him, with peace in his eyes.  He looked at Hermione, who stopped mid-spoonful and tried a weak smile.  The balance of power had shifted, and Blaise felt it, sensed it.  He would not be caught on the wrong side.  He gave a small acknowledge nod to Draco.  Greg simply missed all that assessment, and shrugged his shoulders.
“Do you remember last month when I ran out of Divination?” Harry asked, his eyes were just starting to focus on Draco once again.  It was like waking up from a nightmare, only to enter a dream.  Reality was not tangible for Harry, so much was muddled from a vision that seemed real, maybe it was real, and this only a dream.  Harry was brought back by the sound of Draco’s voice.
He entered the pale beauty beneath him in a smooth thrust and stared down into mercury.
The glow that came around him was soft, and enticing.  She leaned forward as if basking in the glow was the only thing she wanted.
“Don’t worry Ron, you have your moments, and when you do, they are brilliant.” Harry offered, he knew his friend’s jealousy got the better of him at times.  But he knew Ron, and Ron was just as much top notch as Himself or Hermione.  He was in the best company, no matter when in time they were.
Severus watched as color drained from Harry’s face.  Melancholy flowing over the young man like a second skin, eyes like Lily’s, but the brightness had left.  He saw now, this young man was definitely not his father, so much more like the vulnerable Lily.  Harry must be lost inside a memory of the vision, He could guess which memory.  His own pride and ignorance caused this as he tried to intimidate Harry.
Rules for the meeting:
Hermione was the first to find her voice, “So was you-know-who defeated?”
Harry was ecstatic.  He talked more about the upcoming Holidays, and what he had planned for the Malfoys and Snape.  He wanted the house cleaned nicely and offered to ask Dobby to help.  Sirius accepted that.
Harry had already set a good schedule for what he would be teaching.  He was going to run it similar to the trainings he had for Aurors, but toned down.  The charms included normal privacy charms, disillusionment charms and perfecting the patronus charm.  He would include some new charms and curses, such as the Reduccio charm, and the Sectumtempus, and a few others based on jinxes.  The counter curses for some of the more well-known Death Eater curses, and a new counter to Crucio, Sonabona which could be tested with the Afflictio curse which was allowed and much less painful.  He would teach them how to resist the Imperious, if allowed.
Mrs. Malfoy walked unaided into her sitting room and sat down opposite her guest.
“I had a vision, not an ordinary vision. Most visions are of a single event or something obscure from what I was told.” Harry explained, looking back at Draco, his eyes were and intense green, “I had a ‘vision of living’.  I lived for over 20 years inside that vision that to you all lasted only a few minutes.”
She shook her head mutely.
Harry walked through the doors, and up to the sink.  He moved to the faucet he wanted.  And looked up at Draco.  He wanted to make sure he didn’t scare Draco, but Draco’s reaction was more than a welcome revelation.
“From what I understand, it’s in the blood.  My mother was exceptional at charms, or so I was told by one of her favorite professors.” Harry said, trying not to look at Severus.  He was so proud of the progress Severus had made, but that would not stop him from sharing in the pride he felt for his mother.  He was proud to be Lily’s son, it was just another part of him that he had accepted long ago… well maybe not long ago… Harry smiled one of his secretive smiles at that.
Sirius broke the kiss first.  Each trying to regulate their breathing.
After the Malfoy’s left, Harry inquired after the next Order meeting.
Harry sighed after he reviewed the texts in front of him.  He would have to wait for those memories after all. The first ritual was a no go.
When the music stopped Harry took his hand and led him over to a small table that had appeared.  A silver candelabra sat in the center, and two elegant glasses of butterbeer were on the table.  Harry held out the chair for Draco to sit, and winked when he was given a slight glare.
Professor Dumbledore read over the notes and schedule… “Harry, this is actually the best curriculum I have seen these many years for this study. You have my blessing to proceed, and I would like to watch a time or two if you may… Some of these are new to me.  I shall have the castle amenable to your style so if any help is needed, I shall be notified immediately.  Very well thought out indeed.” He praised.
Narcissa gasped, but then composed herself quickly.
“I was afraid with everything that has happened and all your new powers, that you would not need me or Hermione anymore.  I am glad to help.  I want you to know that, even if you can do things alone, you do not have to.” Ron said, he clapped his hand on Harry’s shoulder.  It was odd looking at Harry now… His friend had become a man before he did.  He was still a child in the eyes of everyone, but Harry well… it was Harry after all..
“You just have all the luck don’t you pup?” Sirius said quietly. “I don’t know much about the Augur thing, I’ll do some looking here since we have a vast library.  Anything from the vision you want to talk about?  Are you allowed to?”
“The next one I will show you, is from my vision. I show you only so you know how to protect yourself should it ever come to pass. My mother only wanted your happiness, not this.” Harry said and he touched a dark brick.
“Merlin said it is time to show Voldemort my power… It will be what draws him to the final confrontation.” Harry said.
‘She will have to be watched and definitely not trusted, but at least offensively she is weak.’ Harry thought.
When she let him go, she went back to her seat gracefully.
They met in a clash of fury, arms gripping and pushing, legs sliding together in the water of a hot bath... and lips... they were branding each other.  Hot, melting and hungry.  Thier mouths fused and undulated, heated breaths fueling the passion.  Each intake of breath took the intensity higher, Draco's scent causing an almost dizzying high for Harry.  Draco was lost in the fire, his blood sang, his mind was blissful and his body completely alive.  There was no slowness between them, only rough touches.  They scrubbed hard as they washed death from their bodies, only to clash over and over again with passion.  Harry pushed hard against Draco's back, bending him over the edge of the massive tub.  He let his fingernails lightly score the pale flesh of Draco's back.  The gasps and needy moans were his reward.
“Have you ever hit Harry?” She asked, hoping it wasn’t true...Harry flinched at that question.
“Harry, dear?” Professor Trelawney asked in a very quiet voice.
“Come, I have to finish here.” Harry announced.
Harry’s eyes slid shut as his hands guided Draco’s face, dragging him closer, and allowing him to possess that mouth once again.  He drank in Draco, plundering, and branding.  His senses were going wild with each inhale that impaled Draco’s scent into his lungs and imprinted it into his mind.  Draco’s mouth was a drug, enticing, hot, addicting.  Draco had to keep himself from falling this time, winding his arms around Harry’s neck, and holding on for dear life as he felt his whole being going up in pleasure.  Again they broke apart unwillingly, needing more air.
“Back off Vince” Three voices spoke in unison behind Draco.
Harry’s vision cleared and he found his hand resting on a crystal ball, and looked up to see the stunned face of a much younger Ronald Weasley. He turned his head and looked around, his eyes collided with eyes the size of dinner plates, set behind glasses that magnified them. Harry Potter stood quietly, surveyed the room with trepidation. Eyes landing on a pensive Lavender Brown, a haughty Draco Malfoy, a very alive Vincent Crabbe and many more.
“I need to show you something, and in a way you won’t like Aunt Petunia.  It is imperative you think long and hard after what I show you… You could be in danger, but whatever you choose, I will ensure your safety.” Harry said.
He turned to face Professor Dumbledore who stood agape, “My apologies professor, this one needed some softening. I believe all people have some good in them, and I hope in the coming weeks I can count on your support behind some of my actions?”
Harry made his way to the headmaster’s office after lunch… He was hoping for news on his class speakers.
“Keep your wand with you when you go places like the loo or to bed.  Are you coming to the defense class tonight?” Harry asked quietly.
“This first week we will learn the patronus charm, how to cast it, learn the appropriate applications it can be used for, and how to direct it for other purposes than protection.” Harry explained.
“Good. It will be good for you sir.  Just wait and see.” Harry said cheerfully.
Harry smiled, “Good boy.”  He peeled off his trousers and briefs and kicked them to the side, He stroked his hard cock until it leaked onto his thumb.  He pressed Draco’s mouth open and let the man lick his thumb clean.  Harry tilted Draco’s lips so he could line his cock up with Draco’s throat.  He reached behind himself to hold onto Draco’s hair as he slid slowly into Draco’s mouth and throat. The first glide was slow and easy, he pulled out to see shining silver watching him. He squatted a little more to change the angle and slammed in hard, his balls covering Draco’s nose as the blond gagged and spluttered. Harry pulled out, then reached for his wand to at least protect Draco’s nose so he could breathe.  A quick charm and then he could slam with abandon and without fear.
“Harry?” Sirius asked as he yawned.
Darkness faded on the scene at Kings Cross station. Harry’s could still feel his hand waving to his children on the train.
“So the Death Eater has finally come home.” A slurred voice drawled from the dark corner of the room, “Meeting with your master go well?”
Today they would work on the Sonabona charm and teachers were needed, as this was the counter for the Cruciatus and Afflictio curses.  The Professor and headmaster were standing off to the side watching pensively as the students entered. Harry paired everyone up again with different partners this time, so no one got used to the same partner.  He set them to do a quick round of disarming vs stunning. He wanted to increase their awareness and casting speed.
Harry penned a quick note and sent it off to Mrs. Malfoy.
Harry only had to wait a few minutes before he was again swept away with a port key.
“Those are painful memories.” Harry revealed.
After he set them working on their brewing, he walked over to the doorway.
Severus reached out and placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder, and spoke softly, “Harry, whatever it is, do not dwell on it.  Harry!”
Her eyes met pitch black, but they were warm and kind and full of love.  She saw then, drawn into Harry’s thrall.
Severus moved closer to the webbing, and Harry showed the Headmaster where he needed to stand.  Harry moved to just the side and waited.  Dumbledore let a strong stinging hex go, Harry blocked it silently, but Severus still stood unmoved.  Harry frowned in concentration, and nodded back to Dumbledore.  The headmaster released a strong cutting hex… Harry’s wand was hidden, but pointed towards Severus, as he whispered, “tuverna”.  The hex flashed as if it hit Severus, he was thrown back, and then the image of Severus faded into a ghostly form as it traveled up the webbing.  Harry stood taller, smiled wider and then laughed.  Severus moved from behind the arch with a bewildered expression.
Draco looked around and let out a little shriek as he saw the dead carcass of the Basilisk still laying on the floor of the chamber.
“At least 5 meetings, or detentions, however you wish to arrange them should be enough.” Harry said as he smiled, “Let me know. I don’t want to be late for lunch, heard Dobby cooked dessert today… treacle tart.” His voice caught on the name, and he cleared his throat quickly before looking away.
Ron smiled wider, and clapped Harry on the back and was about to get up, until Harry stopped him.
Harry complied, one hand came down hard on Draco's arse.  A bright red handprint left in its wake.   Draco moaned louder.
“I understand, I’ll do my best.” Draco said, directly at Ron, who would not look at him.
Harry’s demeanor shifted towards sadness, he could not meet Draco’s eyes.
Harry smiled wide at Draco and held out his hand.
“Expecto Patronum”, The potions master cast his patronus, “Something is seriously wrong with Harry Potter, Come Quickly.” And the silver doe was gone. Severus carried Harry through the halls, and towards the hospital wing. All the while wondering what had gone wrong, the boy did not feel feverish, nor was his body shaking. He did not detect any magical signatures to signify a curse or jinx or other nonsense. Pomfrey would have a time with this one.
Teaching intrigued him. He enjoyed training new Aurors much better than actually pursuing dark wizards.  So in a way, Harry was in his element.
Harry’s eyebrow quirked up in apprehension.
They discussed the events at the ministry in detail and were confident that everything had gone according to the plan.  For the first move, Harry was sure he was ahead.  Next would be Voldemort’s move.  Harry knew that meant the escape from Azkaban was imminent, but he would say nothing, understanding the pieces of the board needed to be filled, without the Queen, there could be no checkmate for the King, and he knew Voldemort would be there in response to his actions against Bellatrix… That was vital.
Narcissa heard curses coming from the other room and slowly made her way towards the sitting room.  She held tightly onto the cane trying to ignore the pain in her legs as she moved.  Once there she settled herself in an armchair.
5. No revenge actions on Draco Malfoy for any reason as a result of this discussion.
Draco, hair still being held tight, scooted closer and rubbed his face into Harry’s crotch while moaning “Please.” “Please” “Please” over and over.
Harry took that information in, smiled, and looked back up at the headmaster. “This may sound strange, but it is good to see you. It has been an eternity for me, but for you I am beginning to believe it may have not been so long. Alas, that means Cedric will still be someone I can’t save. I assure you headmaster, I have not been meddling with time, but I think time has meddled with me.” Albus looked at the boy, more questions were forming as he was about to ask, Harry held up his hand. That was not an action the Headmaster had ever seen Harry use, Harry was unsure, angry and in need of guidance most of the time this year. This Harry was calm, self-assured and in control.
“HARRY!”
They both stood back, and Harry bound Vernon to the chair.
“Professor, I’ll confess what I say next will sound strange.  Over the years, in my vision, I grew to understand you after your death.  I saw you more as someone to look up to, to try to emulate and to respect.  In a way after your death, you became like a godfather of sorts to me, a part of my lost family.  I know I currently have Sirius, and he will always be what he always was.  Do you think it strange for me to see you as a paternal figure for me?  In my life I have always needed, or at least the mind healers told me so, people to surround me and offer that which I needed the most in my life, true affection.  Not just a desire to see me fulfil some destiny, but to form a family of sorts.  I would be honored if you would consider that.” Harry confessed, rather nervously.
“It will take him longer, but I think he will come around.” She motioned with her head towards Ron.
Harry went to ensure Draco would be acceptable first before dragging one of his friends home with him.
“And you Draco, what do you have to say?” She asked softly.
“He is supposed to listen to you...right?” Amelia asked, but she knew the answer to that.  The minister was so paranoid he would waste the opportunity.
“Are you ready for the next lesson?” Harry asked gently, trying to guide the conversation to a safe topic.
Severus shook his head, and pushed himself off of the man.  His head was still spinning.  He had never actually kissed anyone, and that was unnerving.  His control was shattered and his mind was starting to bring up the guilt he should feel for betraying his love of Lily this way.  He scrambled to his feet and swayed towards the fire to leave.
Lucius thought about that, separation from his wife was not something he took lightly.  Nor was the fact that the now public friendship going to cause a stir in the Dark Lord’s ranks.
They had touched often enough over the past three weeks.  Not like their date, where they could do anything, and just enjoy each other with no distractions.  It had been more of a brush of hands here, a shoulder bump while walking, it was always a thrill, this close though was more than a thrill, it was a bombardment of his senses.
“Most of those with ‘the sight’ have prophesies or small visions that only extend as far as a single event of the future. I have not heard or read of any circumstance to my knowledge that a vision from an ordinary wizard encompassed a lifetime, Can you tell me what you saw?” The headmaster asked.
Harry shook his head, “How is he? Who did it and why?”  Something inside him twisted at the thought of Draco in pain, Harry ignored it.
“Where are we?”
Draco looked at both of them, nodded, “I’m good.  I have decided the old rivalry is not worth continuing… I suggest you also let the past go and learn to be friends with Harry as well.  I have made my choice.”
Harry waited in his office… He had his cloak waiting for Ron when he arrived and they walked to his rooms.  Once inside, Harry put the cloak in his pocket.
“CRUCIO!” Snape shouted as his wand sent off a red streaming curse.
“What is that? We need to take it to Dumbledore.” Severus stated, reaching for the box.
Harry grinned wildly, “Only that he needed to stop living like a teenager and grow up.  Treat you with the respect you deserve.”
“Mr. Potter...” Snape tried to form a question, then noticed the book Harry was holding. It was his old textbook.
Severus pushed the vial into the man’s hands. “Drink” Severus ordered. Bloodshot eyes glared back at him. “NOW, before I make you.” There was a finality in Severus’ tone that would not be argued with.
Harry was stunned to see two sleek owls at his window later that evening.  He took the new letter from the same dark owl and set it aside.  Then took a thicker parchment from the golden eagle owl.  He decided to save Malfoy’s letter for last, he did not need to be in a bad mood for whoever sent him the second letter.
After arriving first to his dorm and changing, Harry walked out of Gryffindor tower.  He had a meeting with Professor Snape and he would not be late.  Lateness was a sign of disrespect for the Professor, and Harry was determined to show the man the utmost respect he deserved.
The door opened and his Aunt in all her state stood there looking at him awkwardly.  He knew he looked different, but the puzzlement on her face was so funny he almost laughed.
Pale hands became urgent, needing to feel Harry’s skin as well, their fumbling was making them both impatient.  Harry pulled his wand and spelled their tops off, leaving them in just trousers.  The relief was immediate, but the urgency increased.  Harry stroked each inch of pale flesh he could find, his mouth was quickly leaving marks all over the ivory skin, causing Draco to cry his name each time.
Draco looked over, and shook his head.  He wasn’t ready to share anything yet.  Harry and Draco had an amazing time, and it wasn’t all passion and fireworks.  It was soft, caring and comfortable.  Maybe that is what Harry meant by friends first.  He could handle that, as long as there were some of those amazing kisses too.  He would have to tell his friends sometime, but not today.  Today was theirs.
Harry had to get some rest before his meeting tomorrow.
The memory of Voldemort sending Nagini to strike him played out, Harry tried to cut it off before he and his friends entered, but Severus put a hand on his arm. He watched as Harry knelt next to him, covering his wounds. He saw his own tears form as he saw Lily in Harry’s eyes, and he saw Harry collect the tears. He saw the life leave his own eyes, and Harry’s tears fall, for him.
I don’t like your heavy handed ways, but they seem to serve a purpose. I have thought long and hard about what you said. As I do not have a favorable opinion of you, I do have to acknowledge your power. Your insight is on target. I do not relish the thought of working with you, but in light of recent events, you are the lesser of three evils. I will maintain my ministry post, and help where I can, though I do so reluctantly. If the balance of power shall be swayed, so too will my loyalty. I am not a blind follower, Mr. Potter. But I do see opportunity in aligning with the strong.
Harry unstoppered the potion, and lifted the potion out in thin string like streams, wove it into the box on the top, bottom and all sides, each a complicated pattern that interlinked at various points. Harry cast one charm, and the strings glowed a bright glacial blue and then vanished. The oppression Severus had felt was gone. Harry canceled his impervious deludes charm and sighed. “It worked. It is a good batch.” Harry said.
Harry felt.  He could distract himself with what he felt.  This with Draco was dangerous, if he lit the match, there is no telling what would happen.  Draco’s lips barely grazed his ear, and Harry could not take it.  The pull too strong, his will too weak.
