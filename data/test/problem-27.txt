Draco pretended to be engrossed in his paperwork. He wasn't particularly fond of his father's impromptu visits. It was bad enough that he saw him at dinner every Sunday and in business meetings. No one, and I mean no one should ever be subject to small talk with Lucius Malfoy. Family or not. It was almost always an unpleasant affair for his father seemed to have no filter, though he was better than he had been in the past. Things had been strained between them more than ever before.
Draco snapped out of his trance, turning slightly green and laughed nervously. "Isn't there someone a little more qualified?" The healer nodded in understanding and whisked the baby away to be cleaned and fussed over by all the nurses.
"You should be ashamed young man for leaving your baby alone like that.", she tsked. "Poor dearie. I have half a mind to report you to the Ministry for abuse.", she said waggling a wrinkled finger of disapproval in Harry's direction.
"What are you talking about Pansy? Draco didn't get into Beaubaxtons.", Harry said confused. Pansy laughed mockingly at Harry.
"Have you gone mad Draco?", he hissed. How could you throw away your life like this? It's one thing to date, but now to soil our family blood with this...this filth?", he said gesturing towards Harry. "I will not allow it!"
Draco picked his son up and stabilized his little feet so that he was standing on top of his thighs. The commentors signaled the beginning of the game and introduced the first team. Afterwards, the Beaubaxton team flew out in their blue and silver uniforms, Harry bringing up the rear. Each player was announced individually. When it was Harry's turn, he circled around the arena.
"That's perfectly understandable. It'll be quick. I promise." Hermione gave him her best reassuring smile. One of Hermione's greatest strengths was in her ability to remain rational and calm in any situation. Normally this wouldn't phase him, but today it was absolutely infuriating. He needed someone to panic right along with him.
He knew this was coming. He knew that Draco was engaged. Had known for months. But the reality that it was finally over, that Draco was actually bound to someone else forever and that there was no chance for them left, was too much to bear in that moment. He felt the tears threatening at the corners of his eyes and he knew it was time to go. "Guys, I'm sort of tired and I still have some stuff to do around the house. I'll floo later."
"Sorry about that guys. Must have eaten something bad", he reasoned with himself, although he didn't truly believe that explanation and neither did his friends.
"He's a complete git. Honestly. I don't know how Remus puts up with him. Yesterday when he told you your jeans were too tight, it pissed me right off. Who does he think he is?"
"Harry, it's not nothing. Clearly you're sick and you have been for weeks now. I know Draco's gone and you're having a hard time, but you can't ignore this forever. He has a right to know. You can fix this Harry. You can't give up."
Pansy was notoriously jealous of Harry. Everyone knew she was in love with Draco. She had it in her head since they were practically babies that they would get married one day. Her bitterness was at an all time high now that Harry was pregnant. She couldn't understand it. Harry Black was nothing special and yet Draco still picked that half-blood filth over her. It was unacceptable.
Harry gestured to a box sitting on a shelf. Draco's boots clicked as he walked over picking up the parchment filled box. They were still rolled up and tied.
He looked everywhere for Draco and couldn't find him. With his luck, Draco was already well on his way back to school. He'd missed his chance.
This was death. At this point death might have been preferable. Or torture. Yes, that's it. Torture. It must be. Surely he had done some great misdeed in his life to deserve this punishment. His stomach churned again and before he knew it, he was heaving over the bowl. Yup, he was being punished. Brax was never like this. This baby was a demon, or better yet, a Malfoy. He didn't even look up when a small knock came at the door.
Harry had to compose himself as Draco kissed him on the cheek and handed him a large bouquet of flowers. Harry scowled which was a rare occurrence.
Surely this wasn't happening right now. Not at this moment. He felt a strange sensation and then a rush of water came flooding into his pants and soaked through to the tiled floor.
Harry drew up every ounce of courage he had through the tears now freely flowing down his face and began. "I can't Draco. It's over. Go away." He ignored Draco's increasingly muted protests coming through and walked to the floo.
Hermione nodded earnestly. "Oh, I've read about this before. It's very serious. After giving birth, the hormonal balance can be extremely off scale causing mood swings and deep depression in women and especially carriers. He's torn between his instincts to care for Brax and losing his youth. Poor Harry."
Hermione bumped his arm. "Ronald!", she scolded. "Astoria is a perfectly decent person. She and I worked together on that ball last year."
Twenty-one year old Draco stood in front of the mirror straightening his tie. From an outside perspective, he was the picture of perfection. An aristocratic, educated, abundantly wealthy and extremely handsome young wizard. Yes, Draco Malfoy had it all. The mansions, the money, the clothes, the fame, and a beautiful fiancee as well as a position as the Vice President of a major company.
"How dare he show up after all this time? You don't need him prongslet. Should have known better than to expect a Malfoy to do the right thing. Bloody cowards, the lot of them."
"Draco", his father acknowledged with a slight nod as he sat down, cane still in hand; his Malfoy family crest ring shining brightly on his finger.
"I'm fine. Really.", Harry insisted. He didn't want to go home. There was nothing there for him, but his thoughts. He needed to work. He needed the distraction. It was the only thing holding him together.
Sirius glared at Harry making him shrink under his father's gaze. "This baby is going up for adoption."
"What did you expect me to do? We don't have the money to pay them. Maybe it's time we asked your father for some money."
Draco allowed his head to rest against the coolness of the hospital wall as he sat next to Harry who was silently filling out forms; tear streaks lingering on his cheeks. How did things get so out of control? What if something happened to the baby? The healer came out and cleared his throat. Harry stood up immediately.
"Well then, I love you both and I'll see you later." He sighed as he walked down the stairs. 'Bloody hormones' he said to himself.
As they stepped inside, Harry shouted, "Expelliarmus" and "Stupefy" in quick succession. The intruder fell promptly to the ground. Harry carefully walked towards the man. He was shocked to see none other than Lucius Malfoy on the floor. He quickly cast a renervate and helped the man up. Lucius dusted off his robes.
"Last, but not least, Head Seeker for Beaubaxton University, Mr. Harry POTTER!" The cheers and roars from the crowd were deafening. Brax clapped wildly along with everyone else and bounced up and down. "Daddy! Daddy!", he called out pointing to Harry and reaching out for him.
Pansy poured the money on the counter. She placed a hand over his as he went to collect the coins. "You know Draco, My parents are out of town for a while. You could come over if you like."
"Whatever you want is fine.", he said trailing off, too tired and sore to even consider names. His body was unwillingly giving into exhaustion and his eyes fluttered close.
Harry and Draco stood at the check out desk where the nurse was awaiting the quill that was furiously writing out their bill and release instructions.
"I talked to my father.", Draco explained. "It's all ours if we want it." He had spent days redecorating the family villa with the help of the elves so that it would be perfect for them
Harry's heart tore apart; a slow burn rising in his chest. Draco never begged for anything in his life and here he was begging Harry to take him back. His hand shakily reached for the knob; desperately wanting to turn it. To fall into Draco's arms, to make things go back to the way they were before, but something made him stop. He withdrew his hand knowing that things would never be the same again. They couldn't go on like this.
Harry was tired of listening to Sirius yell. He looked around for his papa for help, but he was still upstairs making sure Teddy stayed in bed. Ever since they had come home and he found out that Draco was back, Sirius'd been on a tirade.
"Oh Harry! We missed you", Hermione shouted as she hugged him. Harry only yawned and rudely pulled away.
Harry smiled warily and wiped his face. "I don't know. I think it's hormones.", he muttered and they both laughed.
It was over. Draco was leaving behind the only person who ever made him truly smile to be the man that would make his parents proud. He was giving up everything to do exactly what society expected of him. To be Draco Malfoy; another faceless slave of the unspoken pureblood rules just as many generations before him had. He desperately tried to shake the memory of the last time he saw Harry from his mind.
Draco would admit that he had been blindsided when his father sent him an owl proclaiming that he had actually signed the contract and they were to be married soon. Especially since he found himself smack dab into the middle of a relationship with Harry. He never thought it would actually happen to him. All of his friends had already been paired off, but he foolishly thought he had somehow escaped the tradition his blood demanded.
"Ohhhh. How could you not have looked at it before? We've had plenty of sex", he said resting his hand on Harry's stomach to emphasize his point.
When he walked in, he was met with the sight of a listless Draco on the couch, covering his ears with his hands and the baby screaming bloody murder in his cot. His tiny face was bright red, tears streaming down chubby cheeks. Harry rushed to pick the baby up.
Harry let out a noise that was close to a sob and a sigh of relief. "Yeah. It's kind of fitting don't you think?"
"I don't know what you're so nervous about. It's Harry we're talking about. He would never stand you up. Besides, where would he go? You've already knocked him up."
He couldn't sit and watch Draco get married. He was strong. No doubt about that, but not that strong. He couldn't keep lying to his friends telling them he was fine when he wasn't. He couldn't bury himself in his work anymore. He had someone else's life in his hands and for the first time it didn't feel like a burden. This was his chance to create a new life, for himself and the baby.
Harry was on his knees with his head stuck in the fireplace. His position was made even more difficult by the huge bump that had taken up residence on his front. The healers thought it could be any day now that he would go into labor. With it being a male pregnancy, Harry knew he would likely not make it to full term due to the lack of room in his abdomen. He sighed heavily.
make your life a living hell.", he promised and Draco knew better than to push his fortune from the look in his eyes. Lucius released his hand from Draco's throat and Draco dropped clumsily into his chair.
"Calm down Harry. That's not what I meant. I'm merely stating that you may want to consider taking the rest of the year off. Have a rest. Figure things out. Though you must admit that being seventeen and expecting is not exactly what Lily and James would have hoped for you."
"That's it Harry. Keep pushing.", the healer encouraged. Suddenly Harry fell back against the pillow as a resounding cry was heard through the room.
Classes begin this Fall. All students are required to move in before the 5th of October. Please note that there is no family housing for first and second years.
He had had lovers before, plenty of them. A healthy sex life involving men and women. Alright, mostly men but that shouldn't have mattered. Malfoys never failed at anything. They were supposed to be the best; always performing above and beyond expectations. After a few embarrassing and pathetic attempts at finding his pleasure with his wife, he had given it up all together and Astoria had for lack of a better phrase, been told to piss off to her own rooms indefinitely. She protested of course, knowing that they were expected to produce at least one child, but Draco would hear none of it. He began a string of highly discreet and frequent affairs to tame his needs and last he heard, so did she. As long as she didn't turn up pregnant or have her dalliances carelessly exposed to the public, Draco couldn't find it in himself to care.
As she reached the door, she turned around and blew him a kiss. "Remember what I said Draco. Anytime."
The bird looked at Draco smugly and flew away. Draco ran to the window and shouted, "Yeah well you can tell him to forget it! We can't get divorced! There's no way to reverse a soul bond."
Lucius brushed off his robes and adjusted his cuffs, straightening himself up as he moved to leave. As he reached the door, he stopped at the sound of Draco's labored breathing as he attempted to suck as much air back into his lungs as possible.
Behind a tree, not far away from the ceremony stood a sobbing Narcissa Malfoy who clutched desperately at Remus. They hadn't been invited, likely out of fear that their husbands would find out and interfere, but they refused to miss their sons' big day once they found out.
"What crawled up his arse and died?" Ron whispered to Draco. Draco quietly led them into the kitchen out of Harry's earshot.
"This is our way. This is how it has always been done. Draco will thank us one day. We may have lost the war, but we must uphold tradition. Have I ever steered us wrong before?"
That night, the blood adoption was performed by Dumbledore as requested in the Potter's will. Sirius would never forget looking into those gorgeous eyes as the ceremony concluded that stayed green but formed a brown ring around the edge that he knew represented him and Remus. He felt the bond as the magic surrounded them. He was a father.
"Spit it out elf!", Lucius commanded, tiring of the creature's incessant blubbering. The small elf jumped at the sound of his master's voice and curled into itself whimpering. Narcissa held up a silencing hand towards Lucius and looked at the elf kindly to let him know it was alright to proceed.
"I'd very much like the opportunity to reintroduce myself to my grandson and my new son in law.". Lucius held out his hand to Harry as a peace offering and gave him a rare smile that was surprisingly warm and inexplicably beautiful. He looked so much like Draco that Harry couldn't help but to smile back.
"I would have given anything to see that.", he said as his mind veered off track before returning to the situation at hand. "Right then, it's just us. Come on, let's get you somewhere warm." They held onto each other tightly as they apparated away.
"M-master is telling Boppin to call when the tapestry changes.", it stuttered. Lucius's eyes hardened to pure steel and his face was void of any emotion.
"Look. I'm only going to tell you this because you're my best friend and I can't stand to see you miserable. It's been four months! You never go out and you don't talk to anyone. All you do is mope around and sit in your room like some lovesick Hufflepuff. So here it goes. Pansy told Harry about your acceptance to Beaubaxtons and that's why he told you to leave. Some rubbish about following your dreams and not holding you back."
"I know Mione, but I'm fine. I told you I just needed a break. I was working too hard and I burned myself out.", he explained with a shrug.
"Silly Potter. For someone so famous, you sure are dumb. Of course he got in. He got Os on all of his NEWTs s well as being Snape's apprentice. How could he not have gotten in?"
Harry nervously pulled at his hair not wanting to remember that night at all. "Um.. a few days ago."
"Harry! How are you my boy?", called Timothy, the store owner. Draco had been working at the apothecary for the past couple of years as an extension of his potions apprenticeship with Professor Snape. He didn't need the money of course, but it looked good on his uni applications.
"I wouldn't do that if I were you", the annoying voice said. He rubbed his eyes and saw Blaise looking at him sipping a cup of coffee.
Harry knew Ron was unaware of what was really going on, but the insult hit him hard in the gut. Because if Astoria was an idiot, then so was he. He was the one actually carrying the next generation of Malfoy in his stomach. Only he didn't get a fancy wedding or a ring to do it either. None of the perks, all of the heartbreak.
Harry rubbed the nape of his neck nervously. "About that..." He almost burst out laughing when Draco turned around and openly gaped at the sight of his stomach.
"Bloody brilliant, that was." Draco's expression was all too smug and Harry couldn't take it anymore. He had gone too far. Harry pushed past Draco and left the room, his face red from embarrassment.
"Oh Draco, you look absolutely dreadful. Must be awfully hard with a new baby and all. How are you coping?, she asked cupping his cheek affectionately with one gloved hand.
With great satisfaction, he had already incendioed the Daily Prophet which contained a picture of the "Greatest Match in Recent History" displayed in the middle of the Society pages that he had to pass in order to get to the Sports pages. Draco and his fiancé Astoria. It was a joke. What kind of name was Astoria anyway?
Harry's fury calmed at the mention of his birth parents. Maybe Dumbledore was right. He and Draco had made quite a mess of things. His heart broke at the thought of disappointing his birth parents.
"Harry love, I'm going to work. I'll be back round nine. I picked up an extra shift. Will you be all right?"
When Harry opened his eyes, he found himself standing inside a warmly decorated living room. "Where are we?"
"It's a start", he sighed as he began to unshrink their belongings. Thank god for their mothers...er mother and Remus. They had to sneak the boys in to get their clothes and other items. Draco busied himself by attempting to transfigure Harry's bed into a king size one like he had at the manor.
She trailed kisses down his chest before wrapping her hands around his semi-erect penis. He was so pissed, she was surprised he could even get it up. Pansy increased the speed of her movements and soon after, Draco felt the familiar tightening in his stomach. He arched off the mattress and came in a few weak and utterly unsatisfying spurts in Pansy's palm. Pansy smirked and continued to kiss at Draco's neck until she noticed that his moans of pleasure had turned to something entirely different. She rose to find tears streaming down his face.
"No.", he cut in. "This has absolutely nothing to do with Ginny. I can promise you that." He almost wanted to laugh. If only they knew that Hermione was half correct. His drastic move did have something to do with an ex-lover's engagement, but not Ginny's. Ginny and him had tried dating, but they quickly realized they weren't compatible enough to be in a relationship and would be better off as friends. They were practically siblings anyway. It would never have worked. Especially once he realized that the one thing they did have in common was an absolute deal breaker. They both liked cock.
"There's my favorite girl!", he cooed playfully nipping at Thea's chubby arms, earning a glare from both Narcissa and Lucius who were obviously jealous, but thankfully held their peace. Draco marveled at how far they'd all come from that night at the dinner table when they first told everyone that Harry was pregnant at sixteen.
Where had it all gone wrong? For Harry, these last two years had been the best of his life. Had they really thought this could work? The son of a death eater loving the Boy Who Lived? It was laughable.
Harry was walking around the flat with Brax sucking down a bottle in his arms. He was exhausted. A loud crack sounded from outside the window and a shadowy figure came to view. Harry immediately put down the baby and cast strong protection charms around his cot. He readied himself for an attack, wand in hand. Whoever it was, was almost throught the wards now.
"Hell if I know. But I do know one thing. Harry loves you. He doesn't give a shit about the money or the clothes or the image. You know that. You guys are meant to be or something. It's disgusting. You have something that anyone would give their right arm for."
Draco had been taught from a young age to hide his emotions. "Emotions are for lesser men Draco. You are a Malfoy. You were born of privilege my dear boy and that has its consequences. Your duty is to your name and nothing else. It is what defines you ," Draco could still hear his father saying. The mantra replaying itself over and over again in his mind.
Draco slowly turned to face Harry, an evil glint in his eyes. Harry's eyes narrowed as he inspected Draco's face. He knew his husband well and he could practically see a devious Slytherin plan drifting through his mind.
"Well let's see. You got completely pissed, went to Harry's, made a complete fool of yourself and I had to drag your sorry arse back here before the aurors came. You also pissed your pants. I know we've been best mates for years, but I'd rather not have to scourgify your knickers ever again."
"I'm sorry.", she whispered as she pressed a chaste kiss to Draco's forehead. "Step back Cissa", Lucius commanded. He raised his wand and chanted the spell; his wrist flicking his wand in intricate, graceful movements. "Nulla memoria reliquit!"
Harry chose that moment to save Teddy who was in tears at the thought of betraying his big brother. Damn, Teddy must have been spying on his conversation with Ron earlier.
"Master is being sick. He is not listening when Kreacher says he should go see healer. Master is being very naughty. Kreacher thinks he must go to mudblood Granger and tell her.", his large eyes narrowing.
Sirius was losing his little boy and he didn't know how to stop it. He remembered the day Harry had come to them.
It was also times like this that she secretly mourned the loss of her grandchild whose little feet would have been padding down the halls of the manor in no time. The guilt of what they had done ate away at her until it was almost suffocating. More often that not, she found herself struggling to tell Draco the truth. It would dangle on tip of her tongue waiting to slip, but never did.
Draco frowned at the mention of his father. "Technicalities love, technicalities. And besides, I doubt he actually disowned me. Wouldn't want to suffer the embarrassment would he?", Draco said bitterly. "Let's not talk about my father. He's not a part of our lives anymore."
"Mother, Astoria.", he acknowledged tightly. "I'm afraid I must leave you. I have something important to attend to."
"Is everything alright?", Astoria asked in concern. She appeared to be trying, but he couldn't find himself to believe her as sincere.
"It's not so bad", Harry said attempting to lighten the mood. He pulled out his wand and muttered a powerful cleaning charm on the front room while letting up the curtains to allow some sun in. Draco sighed. He just wasn't used to this.
"Yes mother. Shall we?", he asked as he took her arm and led her down the winding staircase and into the decorated ballroom.
Draco was dragged through memory after memory of their love. Each one melting in the end; a part of his heart dying with each loss. Until finally, he was left in that last one. The one that meant the most. The one that ended it all...
"They can't do this! That meddling old fool is going down. I won't stand for it. How can they ask you not to come back to school? No one treats a Malfoy like this!"
Harry nodded crisply. For a moment, Draco thought he might get punched in the face judging by the way Harry's fists were clenched at his side. He had been on the receiving end of one of Harry's punches only once during their brief two day break-up period back in fifth year and he never wanted to risk pissing him off again. Harry was small, but he could hold his own. The atmosphere was tense as they both stared at each other in silence.
Harry trudged up the stairs. He was startled by the sound of ear shattering cries coming from upstairs. His neighbor came out to confront him.
"How is he? Is he going to be okay?", Harry asked nervously wringing his hands together. Healer Ronson chuckled.
A knock at the door revealed a tired Dumbledore with an armful of blue blankets. It was then he knew that James and Lily were dead. They had all been betrayed by Peter and little Harry was the lone survivor and the miraculous defeater of the darkest lord in history.
Draco huffed. "I'll have you know that Abraxas was my grandfather's name. It's fitting for a Malfoy."
Harry swooped in front of them and hovered for a few moments to rub Thea's tiny head and reassure Brax that he would be back before he knew it. The toddler's lip had been poked out and wobbled when he realized that Harry wasn't staying. Brax grabbed at Harry's face to press a sloppy kiss against his cheek. The crowd collectively "Aww'd"; someone having cast a video charm on them for the entire stadium to see. Draco rolled his eyes. Sometimes he forgot just how much of a celebrity Harry still was as the Boy Who Lived.
Hermione shot him a scathing look, but he just rolled his eyes and mumbled something about hormones while putting his arm around her shoulder. "Harry...", she began slowly. "This wouldn't have anything to do with Ginny and Dean would it? I know you said you were over it a long time ago, but it can't be easy seeing them get engaged. You two were together for-"
"I told you to stop calling her that. And you wouldn't dare or else it's socks for you.", Harry snapped.
Narcissa hated this. She knew more than Lucius that it had not been just a fling. She had seen his empty bed at night. Been suspicious after he decided to 'move out' on his own. Noticed that Draco had never been this happy since he was a small child. How could she not? She was a mother. But, Potter was gone and had taken her grandchild with him. Her heart cried for the baby she would never see, that her son would never raise. No, that would not do. If there was even the smallest chance that this would bring Draco peace, it had to be done. For she knew her Dragon. He was stubborn, loyal and fiercely proud but also sweet and caring to those fortunate to see that side of him. He would never stop looking for Potter otherwise.
"Yes, I suppose I was. Anyway, we were found out and your grandfather pulled me from school for a few days. He told me how disgusted he was by my behavior and that I was not acting like a young man of my station. I had duties to fulfill and I was already promised. I was too cowardly to go against him so when I returned, I broke things off."
It was always somewhere lurking in the background. The very real possibility that they would eventually be betrothed. Especially after Astoria's mother had fallen ill a few years back and there was a rush to arrange a match for her in the event that she passed away before seeing Astoria taken care of. A preliminary marriage agreement had been drawn up, but nothing was official.
"He's just fine. But I'll tell you what. He needs his uncle to make him feel better yeah? Would you like to go see him?"
Harry had had enough. "Shut up you git! My parents can hear you.", he yelled as he launched himself at Draco.
"You can't do this Harry. Godammit! We're married. We have a baby. You said you loved me. Harry please, I'll do anything. I'll be better. I won't drink anymore. We're a family. Me, you and Brax. I can't live without you. Please Harry...please..."
"Of course not cub. We could never hate you. We're just worried about you. I knew you smelled a little differently, but I never suspected. It'll be alright", Remus said hugging Harry tightly.
"Draco, I told you it's fine. And besides, you're technically not a Malfoy anymore since Lucius disowned you."
Blaise mentally ran through the secret conversation he had with Harry a few days ago. Convince Draco to leave. Check. Make sure he has enough underwear...
He was startled by the curtain being ripped open. Harry jumped in surprise as he whirled around to see Draco's gorgeous smirking face. His heart skipped a beat. He loved that Draco could do that to him.
'His duty' Draco thought with a scoff. His duty to take over a role he had no interest in. To deny his dreams of joining a professional quidditch team or being a healer because while being a healer is admirable work, it is too menial for a Malfoy. His duty to marry someone of his parent's choosing. Not for love, no. Not ever for love because love is an emotion. Love is a weakness. But rather to produce an heir of the highest quality possible.
By the time he returned from his inner musings, Draco had begun walking around and telling him about the kitchen and Brax's room, but he didn't hear a word of it. He slowly let his glamour fade away.
Hermione let out a sigh of relief. "She was worried about you too you know. I think Dean was a bit jealous.", she teased.
"Love you too lion." He gave Harry a little pat on the bum. "Now get your arse in the shower. Can't be late can we?"
"See you later mate.", Ron said with a small wave. Harry smiled tightly before cutting off the connection on his end.
"I can't be sure, but most people choose to marry. Since he is already engaged, I do believe they have the option of petitioning the court for full custody. Perhaps you should seek counsel just in case."
Harry squeezed his eyes shut as Hermione raised her wand to perform the spell. The white light shot from the end of her wand came into contact with his abdomen, the soft magic probing his insides with a tingling sensation. After a while, bright blue swirls hovered above his head. Harry gulped audibly.
The rest of the dinner went by fairly smoothly. As smooth as a dinner in the Malfoy house could be for that matter. Draco remained distant and spoke only when he was asked a direct question. Narcissa continued to chat about her usual nonsense. Shopping, gossip, aloof questions about the family business. Through her chatter however, her eyes were carefully trained on Draco who had begun lazily rubbing his eyes; vision blurry. Sweat beads formed on his forehead as he fidgeted with his tie trying to loosen it.
It was just another day full of empty hours, empty conversations, and breathing. Nothing had meaning anymore. He was doing what he had to do. Anything to keep his mind off of Draco. So what if he was feeling sorry for himself? He was allowed that after what he'd been through. He put the tea kettle on and nibbled on a piece of toast.
God, Draco was gorgeous. Even more so now that Harry could see him standing up. His eyes shifted down to Draco's penis which was hard as a brick and standing at attention. It looked even better than it felt. But of course, he'd never tell Draco that. He decided to play with his boyfriend a bit.
Lucius sighed. "I'm well aware of that. When that day comes, he will be married to Astoria and have a child. Draco will not abandon his responsibilities for some fling", he spat.
Before he knew it, his lips met Draco's in a bruising kiss. Harry felt a sensation in his groin as he let out a moan. In response, Draco's own member hardened as he ground his hips against Harry making his intentions clearly known. Harry's face turned bright red as he realized they were both naked and in the shower. It was crazy in a way. Even though they clearly had sex before, it was mostly rushed and in cramped spaces. He had never actually looked at Draco's penis before. Draco noticed the coloring on Harry's cheeks.
Harry picked up Brax and walked into their bedroom, slamming and locking the door behind him. Draco winced at the slam and slowly slid down the wall onto the floor. He needed an escape and fast.
He sighed and looked over at Harry who was laying on the couch not moving. If it weren't for the rhythmic movement of his chest, Draco would be sure he was dead. He brushed Harry's hair from his eyes and placed a soft kiss on his forehead.
Harry was called up for his diploma and received some of the loudest cheers out of everyone. He did it, he graduated. A little late since he was graduating with Ginny's class, but it was done. When the names were concluded, the chairs disappeared and tables appeared piled with food and favors. Everyone was mingled in the chaos. Harry was hugged half to death by his parents and Teddy who was fidgeting in his formal robes.
Lucius huffed as he was released and immediately picked up the glass to calm his nerves. He looked up to see Draco holding onto the envelope like his life depended on it while smiling like a maniac. Lucius shuddered as he looked scarily like his crazy sister in law Bella.
Ron snorted in amused agreement. Dean had sulked and begrudgingly helped them look for Harry, but they all knew that some part of him was glad that Harry was gone. He didn't want him hurt or anything like that, but he still held onto insecurities about Harry coming to his senses, realizing that he made a mistake breaking up with Ginny and trying to get her back.
Harry gasped and quickly moved off, apologizing profusely. Draco waved him off, wincing at the pinching feeling of blood flow returning to legs. He pushed himself up and held his hand out to Harry. "Come on. I have something to show you." Harry smiled and took the offered hand, finding himself pulled flush against Draco's chest before apparating away in a swirl of magic.
He cleared his throat. "I may have been rather hasty in my decision to disown Draco. You must understand that I was in shock. I never meant to...well let's just say I regret it. I come bearing gifts." Lucius said as he pulled rapidly unshrinking packages from his pockets.
"Yes, you may." He allowed Draco to whisk him away into the hall and carry him up the stairs. Thank god he didn't notice the featherlight charm Draco placed on him beforehand. They finally came to rest at the astronomy tower.
"Hey baby won't you look my way. I can be your new addiction. Hey baby what you got to say, all you're giving me is fiction..."
He doesn’t find Ron and Hermione, not in their room or the kitchen or the entire house for that matter.
He eyed the toy in Harry’s fingers, causing him to cough, placing it back on the colorful rack. “I don’t, for the most part, sir.”
“Lose it?” Harry glances away from the sparkles in the air to stare at Hermione in question. “Lose what?”
There were pieces of soot coating Malfoy’s hair—his locks were dangling to his throat. His face wasn’t visible. Yet the way his grey-tinged skin stretched taut against his sharp bones said enough.
”No, no, listen,” she tells him. “You shouldn’t be going through this alone—you shouldn’t be dealing with this at all. How is it always you? To be burdened by the emotions of others? It’s always you who helps us, and it’s always us that takes you for advantage.”
There was a round of snickers to go around, and even Neville looked to be chuckling at the dare. Harry wanted to collapse into himself, the mortification evident on his face. Zabini whipped around to gaze at Harry, delight bright in his eyes. “What do you think this is, Potter? A First Year's party?”
There was a clattering of glass to the floor, and he looked down at his side. Kreacher’s homemade Treacle Tart was still smoking and warm.
“Proof by memory,” Trulock hummed after spending an uncomfortably long time staring at Harry. “Very well then.” He motions to a stiff witch pressed inside the aisle to the chambers exit.
It was like when a tide rose and rose, until it splashed down taking everything with it. To Harry, it was a green monster whipping it’s head and hissing at him, compelling him to take what he wanted and to fuck all of the consequences. He just wanted to grab Malfoy and take
Parkinson’s dumb party games had a morbid cleverness to them, and Harry was half-anxious and half-disturbed when he thought about it. Anxious because her final goal wasn’t to have a good time: it was to ruin him.
Mrs. Weasley calls out for them to come eat not even thirty minutes later. The long table is set up using eleven seats and plates, yet there were eight people present.
More members assume their wits, lifting their wands until the woman taps her wands tip to wrinkled paper again. She reads the outcome, “In the
“And I said that it’s bullocks,” Ron repeated, “Why do they want Harry and Gin together? They’re not even together anymore!” Harry grimaces, and Ron sputters out a quick apology.
It had suffocated him then, and each time he’d go circles around the obvious. It hadn’t been his friend that had driven him away, yet it had been a valid factor. It had been the air—the asphyxiation of grief and heartache.
It’s a lighthearted photo, no doubt taken sometime during their third or fourth year based off of their more youthful appearances. It’s lighthearted, but his heart grows heavy as he glances at it now. Still, it warms him.
“I have evidence that Malfoy didn’t commit first degree murder,” he says instead. It wasn’t a well-thought out plan, allowing them into his mind, that is. Still, he’d read—skimmed—through Hermione’s Law Enforcement heavy tombs—
“I just don’t understand, Harry,” Hermione had said, her face pinched through the Floo system. She hadn’t been able to meet him in person, yet he never received a reason as to why.
Harry straightened his wizarding robes, shying away from the hard scrutiny of the Wizenmagot. The members were scarce at the moment, yet they’d granted him 2 of the 26 remaining to handle his session.
“You know,” Hermione starts off a while later when they’ve both calmed down and are sitting down by the burning fireplace. He’s soaking in the warmth on his back when she begins speaking. “Ron misses you.”
Kingley sends him a letter on the ninth, explaining to him that Malfoy had been transferred to the manor to carry out his probation sentence while under his mother’s care. It’s a relief to know that he is no longer supervised by the vengeance hungry Auror newbies.
Trulock diffused the Memory Room, and, while he and the Wizenmagot scurried off to discuss Malfoy’s circumstances, they were placed back into the stuffy chambers. Stuffy, because there were heated glares warming his neck.
Draco burned—a brutal frostbite, a creaking heartbeat. He was an inferno of ice. His breathing was cold against the empty dent beside him; the blank space, the gaping faces, the shocked places of people that didn’t even fucking matter to him. Harry was his, and he’d never let the bastard leave him no matter how hard it took to pry Weasley’s hands away from his gaping heart.
“Yes, yes, we know, Longbottom. We are ever so gracious for your suggestion, but we need more than that. Have you any way of, say, altering this game of yours with magic?” At his embarrassed meep, she turned her scrutinizing gaze elsewhere.
Chief Warlock Paris Nixon’s face didn’t betray whatever emotions he had bubbling beneath his skin. “I see.” It was his eyes that told Harry everything.
“How could you do something like that, Harry,” Hermione uncrosses her arms to step forward. Her face twists in frustration. “How could Ginny even allow you to do something like that?”
“Maybe you should come breathe it too, Malfoy. It’ll do you some good to see what a real man breathes like, since, you know, you’re shy in bed.”
He can’t though, and Harry finds he can’t read his paper anymore. The words blur into black lines and blobs, like someone’s gone and snatched his glasses off alongside the reveal of the news.
“I’m all but confident that I’m speaking to a drunk, so I’m going to choose not to respond.” His expression was disgusted when he gave Seamus a once over. Seamus narrows his eyes—christ, Harry had a love-hate relationship with drunk Seamus—and shoots him an unfavorable hand gesture..
“Quidditch is my life, and if I can’t even play it, then what’s the point?” She bites her lip, looking off into the distance at the sight of Mrs. Weasley sobbing into her husband's chest.
Even if his eyes were closed, he could see the envious eyes, the sad eyes; the green glowing eyes that haunted his mirrors.
He hesitated, but at the impatient shove, he moved across the room and grabbed them. The first page was covered in anything that correlated to his and Ginny’s identifications. “What is this?”
It could have been the way the stars were aligned that very night. All he knew was that something astonishing had happened, because intoxicants were known to do pleasing things. But Harry wasn’t capable enough to carry the burden of the sweet-smelling fluids in his stomach for the night; he wasn’t haunted enough to feel the consequences.
The clouds overtake the sun, a dark shade of black falling over their faces. Ginny holds her hands over her head, awaiting the furious pelts of rain that were about to spill from the sky. Hermione’s wand hand moves at a rapid pace, and just as the first rain—
“Shit,” he cursed, settling into what would be a sprint had his legs not been cocooned by the heavy robes Hermione bought him for Ministry events (he was sure Ron would go into cardiac arrest when seeing them be used for an event like this).
“I don’t like the way it looks,” he tells her, and her fingers twitch as though they were itching to reach forward and strangle him. There’s a knock on the door, and they both look to see Ron squeeze himself inside and slam the door closed from the power of his locking spell.
In Family, he usually receives an exact number of 3 letters from Andromeda once a week, and a couple from Mrs. Weasley depending on if she was feeling her particular sadness at the fact he that he only visited a single time that month
“As you are aware, Ms. Ginerva Weasley was falsely verified at the Unification Committee. We are here to set that straight,” Nixon clarified, voice close to a purr in his confident sense of satisfaction.
Out of the three of them, Harry had never doubted that Hermione would be the most level headed one in their group. She would be the best, and he loved her for her even when she wasn’t.
“Pretty stupid,” Harry agrees, spooning his scrambled eggs aside on his plate. Her smile is watered down from its usual gleaming state, and he notices her wiping tears away from her eyes. “I’m sorry.”
Somehow, Harry forgot Malfoy was such a bastard, because his ears were ringing from how fast his glasses were snatched off. There was a rising self-satisfied smile forming on Malfoy’s face—cooperating with the twinkle of sordid amusement in his eyes.
He’s never seen Hermione so broken down and defeated; not during the Horcrux Hunt, not during the obliviation of her parents, not during Ron’s abandonment.
Harry decides now is a better time than ever to go out on a limb and speak up for the poor bloke. “Malf—Mr. Malfoy called me here to speak as his witness.” The courtroom went wild for it, with the two seated columnists scratching their quills down at an enraged pace.
the guilty relief and it hurt the both of them. They hadn’t spoken since it occurred yesterday, and everything was fine.
“As Saviour of the Wizarding world, how do you feel about the Malfoy Family’s demise and the passing of nearly 100 accused Death Eaters?”
Soon renovation replaced whatever development he’d started before. Harry didn’t mind it, because Hermione promised them they’d get over it even when she visited him less and less these days.
“Never Have I Ever…” Seamus’ eyes light up. “Never Have I Ever been shy during sex.” He wiggles his eyebrows, laughing as Dean shoved him aside. Several ‘I Have’s went around the room, though some tried to be sneak and unwrap their candies.
Harry bites down the urge to repeat his last statement, because if she knew that then why had she left him alone? Where were they those quiet days after the trial when Ginny couldn’t make it over? “Alright,” he says instead. “Why now?”
Harry blushed stopping abruptly. Draco also blushed when he caught on. It was quite an experience for the both of them.
Blaise tsked quietly. "Weak comebacks like that will only get you so far. Unfortunately, not far enough I'm afraid."
Harry looks into Draco's eyes smiling but he didn't say anything. Seemingly, the smile on his face spoke to Draco.
"Ah, ah... sorry, it's really tender there." Draco frowned at Harry's reaction to pull away completely.
"Blaise what's going on?" A muffled voice came from the other room. Harry assumed it was the bathroom.
Draco liked this position. He could hear the Gryffindor's heart beating against his ear. Everytime the boy breathed, his chest would rise and Draco felt the cold air blow into his hair.
He had walked to the location Harry had told him. Seventh floor, left corridor. He had Harry's note clutched in his left hand.
It had all felt so surreal to the boy. Since he was only but a young child, he had waited ever so enthusiastically for an acceptance letter to Hogwarts. He was barely halfway through the year and that dream had came crumbling down.
Draco took a good look at himself and frowned. He wore a mesh top and a short pleated skirt. It wasn't
"Hey hey, calm down." Harry placed a hand on Draco's shoulder but immediately retracted when the other boy flinched violently. "What's wrong with you?"
Harry needn't be told twice. He searched for the door handle behind him. His eyes were attached to Malfoy's nimble body as if he were hypnotised. He left the room quickly.
Harry placed a hand next to Draco's head on the door. A small gesture that made Draco swoon ever so slightly.
Draco hummed in acknowledgement this time. He glanced at his own nails for a small while leaving the room in silence.
Draco's hand grasped his chest. His heart beated wildly. He had felt so afraid through the whole rant.
Harry stepped closer to the blond suddenly protective, "You didn't attend class. I suspected something was wrong."
He tangled his fingers with Harry's messy curls. The grip on Draco's hips tightened as he was pulled closer towards the other's body.
Harry looked over at the sound of his name. Both Ron and Hermione were both waiting for him to say something.
Draco had now desperately wished that he had checked himself in the mirror before leaving the dorms. How many people had seen his neck and assumed the worst? His parents sure did.
Blaise didn't use any unforgivables on Draco however his manipulation felt like an imperio curse. Everytime Draco had come close to reporting Blaise, Zabini would always talk him out of it.
"Open your legs slightly...just a bit more... there we go." A bright flash and a camera shutter. "Great. That's 75 Galleons easily made."
"I don't know how you managed it but I'm even more upset than before." Draco looked away from the other boy, the dark room hiding the embarrassed flush on his face.
Potter had black hair which he never styled. It was always swept into a messy curl which gave off the image of him having bed hair. He had an olive skin complexion. He almost looked golden whenever he stood on the sun. His eyes were a rare shade of green. They were bright and capturing. The same shade as the Avada Kedavra curse. It was almost frightening especially when Potter's face contorted into something more menacing. It was too bad that his huge glasses covered his eyes most of the time. Draco so wished that he'd wear contacts instead. Maybe then he'd be able to gaze at his eyes more often...
It wasn't so bad, Draco tried to convince himself. Deep down, he could feel his heart painfully tear into two. He knew nothing else but being a wizard. Now he was convinced that he'd spend the rest of his life as a muggle. A squib just like Flitch.
Blaise looked back up with a warm smile on his face. "Come on, we'll miss Divination." They were right infront of the door leading to Divination. Blaise opened the door and stepped aside.
Draco's attempts to catch the other's attention slowly died down when he realised that his efforts to effect the taller boy were deemed useless.
Draco hummed. Shivers went through Harry's spine. He grabbed the blonds hair into a vicious grip. He shoved his length down Draco's throat and forced it still. Draco gagged violently on Harry but was forced still. Tears streamed down his face. He grabbed Harry's thighs and tried to pull himself off.
Blaise is having fun, then suddenly, he's not. Pansy, you couldn't of been any louder! Go away Nott, your jokes aren't funny... Just get this over with... Wait...what?
Draco blushed lightly. He could see the Gryffindor also redden. Harry took a small step closer and Draco took a step back until he could feel his back make contact with the door behind him.
"Alright. Now we all know what was in The Prophet... in any normal circumstance, we would have no choice but to
But not Blaise was gone. He was alone. Blaise wasn't here to help him. He was the tiny dragon among Basilisks.
"Its obvious. You're the whole reason why this situation is happening. You didn't have to show me the picture Blaise took of me but you did. You put yourself in danger."
After what seemed like forever, the talking between Blaise and a random student, Draco assumed it was a
Blaise said nothing the rest of the way back to the dungeons. Why he tagged along all the way, Draco had no clue. Even when the blond walked into the common rooms, Blaise followed after. He didn't leave Draco's side.
Blaise shrugged. "I don't know. I heard it around when I visited Muggle London last week. Apparently its some villan from a television series about a talking sponge and a bunch of sea creatures."
"Let me down." Harry mumbled. His voice heavy with exhaustion. The blood rushing to his head in a steady speed.
Are you really expecting me to place my trust on someone who openly knew about my situation back on third year? He
"I'm afraid I'm not too sure about what Harry is talking about but I'll try my best to explain." Hermione turned so she was facing Ron. "Harry found out that Zabini was selling nudes of Draco so he decided to pay Zabini
"Draco, come here." Harry whispered, his arms wide and inviting. Draco didn't understand why Harry wanted to hug him at a time like this but regardless, he fell into the other's arms.
Draco felt his stomach churn at the thought of having to endure another game of Truth or Dare with Blaise. The questions were personal and the dares were humiliating.
He never experienced love. Only lust. He was only a teenager who had never muttered the words 'I Love You' out loud in a solemn tone.
"I really hope you're kidding." Draco sat up from his laying position and glared at Blaise with such hatred.
"I'd prefer you not scream. Draco is in the other room and I'd be utterly damaged if he found out that you came in when he wasn't
Pansy looked at Theo at the exact moment he looked at her. They smirked and Pansy answered. "It's fairly obvious." Theo nodded in agreement.
When he put on the clothes the first thing he noticed was the ugly, purple bruise that started to form on his arm. Hard to conceal.
Theo would never know where his confidence came from but he had leaned back and whispered, "I was planning on doing
Draco had realised that he hadn't changed out of the oversized hoodie. Instead, he had spent a whole hour swooning over a Gryffindor that he had forgot to clean the evidence that he had been outside of the dorms.
He stared at the area leading to the entrance of the room. He glared at the slightly agape door that had been closed and locked moments before the noise occurred.
"Young Draco," Dumbledore looked up and so did Draco. "Do you have anything else to say before we proceed?"
He felt a sharp object poke his arm. His first initial reaction was to scream in agony. However the pain sent shocks down his spine. A shock of pain and
"No, you know what Blaise. Fuck you. You are a shit friend and I don't know why I trusted you. You can go ahead and tell my parents. I don't care. Send them to Skeeter. Look, let me give you a headline idea.
Draco couldn't help but feel ashamed all of a sudden. People looked at him as if they knew all of his secrets... Did... Did Blaise have anything to do with this?
He felt a light-weight cloak drape over him. Was Harry being serious. His first reaction was to throw a piece of cloth over the pair to hide from Filch in the middle of a moonlit room?
Draco sat on his bed. He had been wondering on what Potter wanted to talk to him about. He didn't know why he agreed to meet him. Especially during breakfast.
Harry didn't urge to start a conversation. Instead, he looked at the shorter boy. Draco, too nervous and fidgety to speak up, looked away playing with his fingers. He didn't know why Harry kept quiet nor did he understand why he looked at Draco. Draco blushed under his gaze.
instead, Harry shrugged and looked away. He felt extremely frustrated and started to feel lightheaded for being upside down for too long.
"I guess this is goodbye." Draco whispered. He hadn't expected an answer from the piece of wood. It had no tongue to speak with nor no face to express emotion.
Draco took off the blindfold that covered his eyes and put on his robes. The game of truth or dare resulted in the same violating feeling like the last game. The only difference was the fact that Draco was sober. He couldn't say the same for Blaise however.
Speaking of disappearance, Potter had disappeared too. At least that's what he thinks. Draco hadn't seen him and knowing Potter, he would of came to the Great Hall during dinner just to watch Draco. Was it coincidence? Perhaps. It didn't feel like a coincidence but who was he to tell. He didn't even hang out with the boy.
By the time Draco arrived back to Divination, it was only 10 minutes until the end. He didn't want to enter the classroom in fear of being questioned on what he was doing for 20 minutes nor did he want to leave. He didn't want Blaise questioning him either. So instead, he stood next to the classroom door and waited for the lesson to finish. If a professor were to walk by, he'd use a Notice Me Not charm.
"Its ok, its fine. We'll get though this. Your reputation will be restored and everything will turn out okay." Harry quietly whispered still pacing the room.
"I'm sorry, is there a conversation more interesting than my lesson?" McGonagall's stern expression mocked them.
Draco's eyes widened. He knew he shouldn't feel shocked with what Blaise said. He had said it many times. But it always sounded so
Harry intervened when he felt the murderous energy radiating in the room. "Don't worry, Draco. He can help us get you out of being blackmailed." Theo nodded eagerly at Harry's words.
Draco suspected that Potter had told his friends but they didn't take much action. Come to think of it, they haven't even
Draco turned at the sound of his name. He looked into the Gryffindor's eyes. They were full of concentration.
When Draco arrived in the common room, he was dressed in his school robes holding his potion books, ready to start the day.
Blaise followed suit. "You are eager to get out of here but don't be too sad. I'm sure you'll find a career in Muggle London. Maybe you'll use that body of yours to earn more money than your family has ever seen."
Draco sat in Divination. His head rested in his hands while he listened to the teacher ramble on about crazy theories of the future. He looked around the class.
Draco kept quiet and pouted his lip angrily. "What do I do then. If he takes one more picture, he might as well sell my body."
Draco knew however. Blaise's father was not a good person. He had only seen him once when he was younger. The man had passed away and his fortunes were given to his wife, Mrs Zabini. The woman collected the money with pride then had moved on to find another rich man to fuck then eventually marry. Blaise didn't want to admit it but his father, along with 10 other men his mother had married, were horrible, corrupt business men and his mother had a daily routine of finding men to court and then eventually, killing them herself or waiting them to die off so she could collect the money. This made Mrs Zabini and Blaise Zabini, one of the richest pureblood families, not too far behind the Malfoy's.
Harry had tried his hardest to keep his eyes away from Malfoy's lower region but yet again, the temptation was hard to fight with.
Harry sighed. He had explained the same situation more than 5 times and his friends still didn't seem to understand.
Draco stared at the other boy. He narrowed his eyes. "Not everyone can miss lessons and get away with it. Not everyone is Harry Potter, The Boy who
Theo took the pictures nervously. His hands shook. He didn't know why he agreed to this but he was nervous on seeing the other side of the photos.
Harry stood up from his seat. What the hell was wrong with his friends!? Why were they acting so odd. "You know what? Nevermind. I'm Harry Potter. I defeated Voldemort when I was
Pansy, who sat on the couch, had gotten up and walked towards Draco. Not before greeting the boy next to him.
Harry waited patiently in the classroom. He had tried to limit himself to staring at the lewd picture in his hand.
He smiled to himself. He didn't forget to place a Notice-Me-Not charm on himself before leaving the room just in case he walked into a professor.
When Draco laid on the bed he could feel Blaise charm chains to his wrists and ankles on each side of the bed.
Draco went to the Slytherin table, averting his eyes from anyone who tried to catch him. He looked at Pansy who wore the same glare everyone else did but they were softer.
"Why did you need to take out 350 Galleons, mate?" Ron had asked him when they walked towards the school again. Harry had simply said that 'he didn't want to keep taking frequent trips to Gringotts.' Ron seemed to buy the lie but Hermione seemed suspicious of the situation.
Draco sat in potions class next to Blaise. Hs had managed to sober up from the game of Truth or Dare him and Blaise just played. He still couldn't help but feel like his privacy was invaded. Surely it was just a harmless game with two mates. Right?
Draco woke up from slumber, refreshed. He felt pretty good this morning. That was rare, he never usually felt good in the mornings but today was different. He looked around and found that he was the only one in the dorm awake. Everyone else was asleep.
Now he was being blackmailed. His parents had no idea on how much stress was being put on their son and neither does the whole Wizarding World. One wrong move and Blaise would do everything he could to make sure every living soul knew how much of a queer Draco really was.
As if Harry had heard his wishes, the knife was once again on his skin, this time it was dragged slowly down his left arm.
Professor Sprout sensed the unease. "Go ahead and get some fresh air. It seems like you need it." She scribbled down a note and gave it to Harry. "If anyone asks why your out of class, tell them Professor Sprout sent you."
Draco looked at his arms. The blood dripping from his fresh cuts. His eyes dilated. His lips were agape. He was fascinated.
"Hey Dray." A female voice greeted him. The nickname didn't effect Draco either. Instead he turned and smiled.
When Snape arrived to take a look at their potion, he jotted something down on the parchment he held.
She nodded in acknowledgement. "The last time i saw him was this morning. I walked with him to breakfast and he told me he was going to go to the library to study for a charms lesson. I haven't seen him since."
are great help and if you want to get out of this blackmail, I suggest you stop insulting my friends."
Harry checked the time. His first lesson was almost starting. Transfiguration with Professor McGonagall.
Draco once again sat in the Great Hall next the the man he wished death upon. He couldn't even pick what food he could eat. Blaise insisted that he picked for he knows what's best for the blond boy. Despite everything, Blaise was still Draco's first and only best friend so he knew what food Draco loved.
He looked up at the broom closet. It had shook for a quick second. So quick that if you blinked, you would have missed it. But Draco saw it twitch.
"Still... Thank you." Draco looked away at the smiling boy. He still didn't like Nott but he was at least grateful that he had came just in time.
One thing Draco discovered was that Pansy was a gossip girl. It seemed that she knew everything about everyone in the school. She gladly shared some of her secrets with Draco. Through the conversation, Draco found out that a 2nd year Ravenclaw named Ashleigh Clarke, had a shrine in her trunk. Pictures scattered all across her room. All of Harry Potter. Draco couldn't help but feel his blood boil slightly.
She hummed but didn't look too convinced. She looked away instead. Then she smirked. "Hey Draco, that cute brunette is ogling you."
“And you believe that?” It was bullshit. If Nixon didn’t see that, Harry wasn’t going to spend his time persuading him otherwise. “It’s…” He couldn’t find the correct word to describe the bubbling feeling that was resonating deep within his stomach. “It’s..”
A Ministry owl flutters by the open window, impatient to be let out and return to its sender. Ginny is stretched out over the couch with a letter pressed to her face, “You got a letter.” She holds it out for him, and sits up to allow him room.
He’s happy to see the man’s face glow. “We could use a charm to tell when someone’s faking, maybe! There’s this spell that..”
There was no point in putting the tent up, as the clouds were gone and the sun was out. It was a blessing, coming from the howling storms and the murky grey clouds to this.
Harry might’ve regretted taking interest in their conversation if he’d have known the end result. Yet since he couldn’t very well tell the difference between genuine interest or drawled sarcasm, he knew he had to save Neville. He set his paper cup on the floor beside him and looked to the panicked man in front of him. “Weren’t you doing a report in Charms for something like this?”
The courtroom’s magic tickled his nose, flying past him to re-arrange the setup in a spectral burst. A dozen seats merged together to form one row behind the accused: Draco Malfoy.
Harry then attempted to floo directly into Kingsley’s private office, but was spat back out into the Auror Department.
Ink smatterings from their fallen ink bottles—dropped in their haste to dip and go—seeped across the floor near his feet. The court reporter waved his wand in a vicious slash to clear up the puddle, and his eyes never strayed from his parchment paper that was scrawling out sentences at a frantic velocity.
“Harry?” Ron shrieked, scooting closer and bumping Hermione. As if that would protect his friend from the hands of a Death Eater. “He can’t do that!”
The court reporter clears his throat. “The accused is being tried for several accounts of alleged first degree murder, aiding and abetting terroristic acts, and Death Eater affiliation.”
“Yes, I’m quite sure he did, dear,” she brushed her fingers against her apron, watching him flounder for words in jovial bemusement. “Is there a reason why you’re taking up space in my kitchen? Make no mistake, I’m happy for the company,” she includes. “However unexpected it may be.”
The last time he tried to sooth a girl from tears—she’d put bacon on his burger though he requested her not to—she passed out from hyperventilation.
Red envelopes begin to fall from the grey clouds, one landing in Harry’s chicken soup, two on Hermione's lap, and three more scattered throughout the tabletop.
“Um,” he sagged back into the legs of the chair behind him. “No one…” Harry felt a tug at his heart for the boy, because no one should have to be put in a situation like that.
Hermione stops mid-rant to stare at him wide eyed and concerned, “Are you unwell? You did look rather peaky when I came in.”
It all blares out, and she’s overpowered by the fury and the disorientation they have for the boy who now looks up at Harry. Malfoy looks up at him, wide-eyed and mouth hanging open, which was a stupid expression that Harry had never, ever had the pleasure of seeing on his face.
“And, I, for one, think that Finnigan’s proposal is a splendid idea. With adjustments, of course,” she added with a sniff, when too many imposing eyes laid bare on her.
He had five minutes before he was due at the Burrow, because Mrs. Weasley was meant to be helping him prepare for the Ball. When he’d shown her the dress robes he had intended to wear—his spell-lengthened fourth year robes that he’d begged Hermione to refit—she tutted and told him to be inside Burrow at five pm. Sharp.
“I don’t,” she whispers. “I don’t think I’m capable of doing this, Harry. I know—I know that you’re afraid, but so am I. You cannot lock yourself out from the world when I’m a part of it.”
Ginny’s tirades come to an end on the fourteenth—they’re struggling with the strawberry cake mix she’d bought on a whim while on a errand—all she had to do was get some caramel drizzle, it was literally
. He slumps down onto the grey sheets in quick lurches, curling into himself with every agitated twitch. The room crackled red around him, shifting into a yellowish orange hue.
“Harry,” Hermione’s voice is faint, subdued even, in the softness of their dying conversation. “You can talk to me—to us. It doesn’t… we can…” Her words drift off on a shaky breath.
Pansy burned—her heart pounded, her eyes stung. She was ignited. Her nails dig into her palms; the dirt, the bedroom door, the curtains. The way they moved hurt her so bad, and yet she couldn’t quite speak her mind.
“But someone should be allowed to do the dares no one wants to do,” Turpin argues, persistent in her ability to make Malfoy take off her short blue mini skirt or her white three hour shirt.
The lift shot through the building, forgetting Harry’s stomach and colon in its haste to arrive at its destination in less than five seconds. How Author and Percy did this daily, he would never know.
They end up panting the backyard garden. The sounds of yelling blur into the background, and Harry begins to make out her red-rimmed face through his heaving breaths. “Alright?”
He wishes he hadn’t been so hasty and rushed; and, to him, sometimes he fell asleep wondering what life would be like if it were Malfoy.
But Harry’s a brave bloke, borderline stupid almost, so he’s stubborn when he faces Malfoy’s stare. “Are you scared or something?” Ron erupts beside him and Hermione stiffens, seeming to expect Malfoy to burst as well. But Harry knew Malfoy, and he knew that whether he had said the right thing or the wrong thing, the sole sentence that he would receive was—
edit: just a warning that the next chapter will cover A LOT so it might be a bit bigger than the usual chapter size. it’s coming through much faster than expected now that i’ve taken the time to set an update schedule (amongst other things)
Although he appeared to be sick to his stomach, he closed his eyes tight and announced, “Truth.” When he snatched the paper from the opened box, he stared at it with horror. He didn’t have the time to yelp before it disintegrated and golden words filled the air:
Meanwhile the kittens were watching the geese curiously. James had taken to staring at their feet, thoroughly confused by them.
Lucius was mid sip when the sound of kittens meowing reached his ears. He sputtered and champagne flew out of his mouth in shock at the sound.
“Yes Luna,” Narcissa replied confidently. “I simply wish to have the cats inherit first. Then, at the end of their lifespan, my entire estate will revert to Lucius.” Narcissa explained.
“Mm. Mmmm. Oooo. Ooo!” Sirius groaned happily before giving out instructions. “A little lower and faster there.”
“Oh, no, we’ve got to hurry. The baggage truck will be here any moment now.” Lucius mused as he started to push the trunk to the exit.
“Yeah, honey, get those two web-footed lifeguards out of here.” Harry grumbled still annoyed at them nearly causing him to drown.
At the end of the sidewalk, Harry and Draco were trying to find a way to say goodbye, neither of them had considered that the kittens might be in trouble. Draco sighed and looked down at his paws sadly.
“Oh trust me, I plan to wear my speedo all week long. It is a vacation after all,” Draco said with a smirk as he pressed his lips gently to Harry’s.
Neither twin saw James trying to bat playfully at their tails, which were shaking while the geese laughed even harder at their own jokes. Draco was in a wonderful mood at having found some new friends to talk to, especially such fun loving ones like these two seemed to be. He walked over to Harry, who was trying to shake some of the water out of his fur, to catch him up on who had saved him.
Luna pretends not to hear Narcissa, still humming aloud as she dances alone, too lost in the moment to let it go so soon. Hearing Narcissa laugh makes her heart happy and with the way the other woman’s marriage is ending, Luna feels Narcissa could use all the laughter she could get.
“Me first, me first! Scorpius yells as they get close to the cat door. All three of the kittens jump through the door at the same time and get stuck side by side with an oof.
James was on the piano bench when Scorpius arrived so he decided a little payback was in order. Scorpius pulled on James’s tail to get himself on the bench then as James fell with an “Ow!” Scorpius jumped onto the keyboard and onto the side of the piano. There he sat, primping his fur fussily, as if he was going to be photographed. James hopped back onto the bench, glared at his brother before sitting down and cracking his knuckles dramatically. Scorpius gave James a look of indignation due to the wait, but James didn’t notice.
“Don’t do that!” Harry yelled, accidentally letting go of the vine in the process so that he started to sink immediately.
Draco stood up gracefully before turning to open his suitcase. It took him a few minutes of digging but sure enough, Draco found what he was looking for. Harry had been watching the blond apprehensively, wondering what Draco could have bought him for the beach. Harry had a guess… and if he was right, let’s just say Harry was glad they had the whole island to themselves. Sure enough, Draco pulled out a speedo…two of them actually. They were a matching set, both made of a sparkly fabric, and rainbow striped. Harry could feel his face getting warm and knew he was bright red. Draco’s silver eyes shone bright with excitement, and yet the hint of mischievousness remained, written all over the blond’s face.
Speaking of the bridge, Draco and his kittens were still there, but at some point a few of them had managed to tumble out of the bassinet. Draco was laying in the grass nearby when a loud clap of thunder woke him up. He lifted his head in a daze, still partially asleep, before crying out as his eyes adjusted. He was clearly not at home anymore, that much he knew for a fact.
Ron ran over to the trunk as Harry started to push out against the pitchfork. Ron hung down from his tail and inspected the lock for a minute before trying to pick it. As Ron started to turn the dial, Harry managed to kick the pitchfork off of him and it made a loud boing sound before shooting through the air. Ron was struggling to hear the tumblers over the cacophony of yeowling, hissing and growling that filled the stable. Annoyed and grumpy, Ron shouted over the din, “QUIET!”
“Oh Luna, we are just a pair of sentimental old fools.” Narcissa laughs snuggling close to Draco as he continues to purr. Scorpius and Albus join them both on the couch at her words.
“Tell them you are sick. Better yet tell them I am sick. Lovesick is a thing, right?” Read the text from Draco.
Scorpius piped up at that with “Moony of the Padfoots, Solemnly up to Mischief…” Draco sighed and tried to stop his well meaning child from confusing their only helper.
Lucius deflated at Luna’s words but did his best to remain cordial regardless. “She is upstairs and she is expecting you,” was his reply. A moment later, Luna’s hat ended up on his head, as she had tossed it at him while heading towards the giant staircase.
“Yup. And she goes all the way to Timbuktu,” was the response. The two person team lifted the trunk into the back of the truck with a heave-ho, unaware of their animal audience. As the truck drove off, every animal had a smile on their face. They were all safe, rather unharmed and the bad man was going to Timbuktu! Little Albus ran out after the truck, spitting and hissing in his best alley cat impression. Draco and Harry both chuckled at the little tiger’s spunk. Ron and the cat clowder thanked Hermione for her help, before leaving the stable to check out their new home. Draco was hopeful that Madame would have room in her heart for all of them. After all, their mansion was big enough.
“Of course not. That’s pure Harry Potter, baby. Right off the cuff. I got a million of them,” Harry explained with a chuckle.
Draco joined in their laughter for a minute before responding. “How nice. I never would have guessed.” Which sent the three of them into another fit of giggles.
Harry stood up first, offering his hand to the blond who readily accepted. They grabbed their stuff, Harry quickly put the stone he had found in the side of his bag, and they walked out of the grotto, through the curtain of water and sat outside in the warm sun. When they started to get too hot, both men apparated back to the top of the water slide, eager to go again. Harry sat down first and patted his lap at Draco, wanting to hold his boyfriend this time. Draco rolled his eyes at the cuteness but sat down on Harry’s lap as suggested. Wanting to add to the intimacy, Draco turned to face Harry as he sat, wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck and toying with the man’s dark hair. Harry’s emerald eyes lit up as they locked onto Draco’s silver ones. Both men smiled at each other before sharing a sweet, gentle kiss. Draco pushed his lips harder against Harry’s, suddenly needing Harry like oxygen.
Draco turned to bury his face into Harry’s arms, done checking out their room now and seeking the comfort of his lover’s arms. Harry pulled Draco in closer and they spent a while just soaking in the love they had for each other. Eventually, though, Draco started to stir, wanting to have Harry in the ocean before dusk.
Harry kissed Draco back longingly, deepening the kiss as he did so. Draco moaned into their kiss and Harry swallowed the sound greedily. But after just a few minutes, Draco pulled away, he wouldn’t be distracted, Harry was getting in this speedo and Draco was going to enjoy ogling his sexy dark-haired lover all night. As they broke apart, panting, Harry smiled and grabbed the speedo out of Draco’s hands and started to get changed. Draco giggled excitedly as Harry started to strip and began to change into his own speedo as well.
“Where every note is out of sight,” Draco sang the final line of the song beautifully before Pansy started the jazz back up with only a few notes from her trumpet.
“There now, Draco. That’s better. We must both look our best for Luna. She’s our nicest and dearest friend, you know.” Narcissa finished primping her hair so that she could pet Draco’s head gently.
“Whoa Hermione! Whoa. Steady girl.” Lucius said as he pulled back on the reins as they arrived outside of the mansion.
“Whoever it is, is gonna get it and get it good,” Sirius growled, crouching into a sneaky position as he set out to discover the thief.
He guessed right , as Draco was home already, had been for a while now, and was clearly ready for him. Instead of texting Harry “when will you be home?”, he had decided to send Harry a tasteful dick pic.
Meowing and hissing met his ears as Ron looked up, realizing that he had been a few seconds late. Regardless, the word sack still left his lips even though his friends were already captured.
Once they tired themselves out on the slide, they summoned their clothes, putting them inside their waterproof packs, as they headed towards the waterfall. Harry and Draco held hands as they walked through the curtain of water, gasping as a grotto appeared before them, the rocks shimmering from the spray of the water. The world behind the water was beautiful, dark yet inviting and somehow they found it comforting. The pool of water behind the fall seemed to be rather deep, which meant they would have a lot of room to swim here as well, an activity both men enjoyed partaking in together. They had to swim across the pool to the grotto’s edge before they could remove their packs. Harry got out of the water and started to rifle through his bag, famished after their water slide adventures. He pulled out a sandwich, offered Draco half, which he took hungrily, and they tapped the halves together before starting to eat.
James smiles at her relief, glad to not be in trouble. Though part of him wonders if his dad will say something to him about this incident later. But Madame is laughing and happy and that is all that really matters to them. Draco is too busy checking on Narcissa to worry about his son’s shenanigans in the moment and he smiles and purrs happily as he realizes she is truly happy. He cuddles into her arms as she speaks to her friend and confidant.
Eyes locked on each other, Draco started to ride Harry’s cock, up and down, slowly at first to help Harry match his rhythm. Draco’s hands reached for Harry’s, grasping them tightly above his head to help him balance as the two men picked up speed. Draco cried out as Harry kept taking him all the way to the hilt, loving how full he felt with each thrust. Harry’s moans echoed those of Draco's; the weight of the blond combined with the look in his eyes managed to make Harry even harder. Soon both men were gasping for air, both on the verge of finishing, eyes still locked on each other which only added to the heat of the moment. Draco’s lips smashed against Harry's, the kiss deepening immediately as Draco opened his mouth to welcome in Harry’s tongue. That sent Harry over to the edge and he pulled away from their kiss to shout Draco’s name as his white hot seed spurted into the blond’s hot ass. Draco came at the sound of Harry yelling his name, and he cried Harry’s name as his own seed coated Harry’s stomach.
Worried that the noise had woken  someone up, Lucius walked backwards so that he could keep an eye on the door. He backed into a tree branch and threw his hands up, scared that it was someone trying to rob him. He still had hold of the bassinet in one hand though, and stood there for a moment, terrified. Until he looked behind him, that is, and realized it was merely a tree. Lucius chuckled at himself before continuing to walk to his car. Nerves were messing with his mind for sure. Lucius made it to his motorbike not long after and eased the bassinet into his sidecar. He lifted up the blanket to check that the cats were sleeping and was happy to see that they were. However, little Albus, the ginger kitten, briefly opened his eyes a smidge. As Lucius set the blanket back down, Albus’s eyes closed all the way once more. Lucius got on his motorbike and kicked it into gear.
Harry perked up at the kitten’s words and at Draco’s face, loving the way the other cat was looking at him. He smiled happily at Draco when the white cat started to talk.
Draco and his kittens are dropped off at home but Lucius finds them before Narcissa can hear them. He tries to send them to Timbuktu but Ron & Hermione aren't having it! They get Harry and Pansy Cat and her gang to help them fight off Lucius. A welcome home party was thrown for the cats, with special jazz band Pans and the Alley Cats being the major attraction! Basically it's the last bit of the story/movie and almost everyone makes an appearance!
The croak came again, a little bit louder, and James still called for Draco. An even louder croak answered James and he yelled in terror as he turned around and ran. “Papa!”
Sirius had been ready for an escape attempt from this intruder and so when the man jumped, so did Sirius, biting into the man’s bottom to stay with him. Sirius was determined not to lose his prey and held onto the man through a full turn of the blades. He tried to pull the man off when their blade was near the ground again, but to no avail. Instead, Sirius ended up on the ground with yet another piece of the man’s trousers in his mouth. He stood there for a minute trying to get his bearings and then out of nowhere the motorbike ran him over! He was fine, just shocked and in some pain mostly, his ears stood up on end as he watched the motorbike run off without a driver. Remus rounded the side of the windmill at a record pace, eyes getting wide as he saw Sirius on the ground. Before he could swerve to avoid running over his friend, Remus felt the pole of one of the blades pick him up by his collar and he was unable to break free.
Draco and his kittens rounded the bend and managed to find the shore that Harry was being brought to. Albus called out excitedly, “Look Pa! There he is.”
Pans Cat, whose full name was Pansy but she refused to answer to it, lay in the middle of a big bed below the window. Her fur was black, except for her slightly chubby belly, which was a dark gray. Pansy’s toes were expertly playing a trumpet while she lay on her back, cool as can be. She wore a black fedora on her head, adorned with a red ribbon. Behind her on a cylindrical pillow, a cat played an acoustic guitar. He wore big sunglasses and had beads around his neck as he played, his name is Dean.
“Yes, yes, I’m on my way.” Ron shouted as he flew off the oven door, propelled by Draco’s loud voice.
“Whoops!” She called out as she righted herself before going back to her lively singing. “Ra ra ra boom di ay…” She sang the same part over and over, as if it were an ear-worm stuck in her head.
Narcissa spun around in front of her floor length mirror, touching up her hair as she did so and smiling down at Draco. He looked regal in his new collar that she had bought him today. He had needed one that matched Scorpius’s better, so Narcissa shopped until she found the perfect one. It was silver still, but studded with shining emeralds, highlighting how clean Draco’s fur was, pure and white. His silver eyes seemed to dazzle as he took in his image as well, he sat atop a nice cushion admiring his reflection. His tail was full and thick, and he was the perfect example of a purebred cat. The classical music from the gramophone filled the room as Narcissa started to speak.
“That is exactly how it is,” Draco said grinning mischievously at Harry and winking at the dark-haired man as he waved his wand and conjured a soft blanket on the sand next to them. Harry raised an eyebrow at Draco as if to say “are we really doing this here?” Draco smirked and winked again at Harry before closing the gap between them and essentially tackling Harry onto the blanket. Harry landed with a surprised “oof” but that was all he managed before Draco’s mouth was on his. The two men were practically naked already which meant that just laying on top of each other sent electricity jolting through their bodies. Every inch of exposed skin was on fire but in the best way possible. Draco had initiated the kiss but Harry was the one who deepened it hungrily, desperate for more of the man he loved. Harry bit into Draco’s bottom lip as their tongues fought for dominance and Draco moaned at the delicious sting of pain.
While the dogs were arguing, Lucius slipped off his squeaky shoes and put them behind the haystack the dogs were sleeping in front of. He still held his fishing pole, and as he set the shoes on the ground, Lucius walked closer to the pile of hay hoping to get his items back with his rod.
“Of course my love, one minute,” Harry said with a smile. He pulled out his wand, cast the bubble head charm on himself and then swam around the cavern for a few minutes, mingling with the sharks.
“I like the tree-trea-treacle tart like they make back home,” came the first line of a song from a lovely male voice. Draco’s head popped up, instantly curious. His silver eyes were wide and his ears perked as he listened attentively.
Or at least it should have been a sad day for everyone in the mansion. A noise caused Hermione and Ron to turn, and they noticed that one person didn't seem to share their sentiment. They watched while an immensely delighted Lucius danced with a pail in his hand and hummed merrily to himself, as he walked towards the barn. Hermione and Ron shared a look of disbelief and confusion before he entered the stable, confused at how anyone can be so happy in light of recent events.
“Sounds like a plan to me. Here let me get in first, yeah?” Harry offered sitting on the edge of the water and putting his feet in.
Ron ran down from the window and his hiding spot, yelling at the cats and trying to warn them as he ran. “Look out for the-- Ron called, tripping before he could finish his warning in time.
“Oh, Lucius, they’re back.” Narcissa called as she neared the bottom of the stairs. “I heard them. Hurry, hurry, let them in.”
Draco  steadily watched this black and somehow auburn furred cat sing and dance, entranced by the way the cat moved. His voice was smooth and steady, and he seemed so sure of himself. Draco couldn’t look away. As the cat continued dancing, Draco noticed an odd mark in the middle of the cat’s forehead. It looked like a bolt of lightning, and it was the only bit of white on this cat’s body. Harry Potter continued to dance as he moved on to his second verse.
She fell back out of his grasp for a minute before grabbing hold of the back of his suspenders. Not really her best idea but she had been a little desperate to save herself. As she righted her spectacles, she chuckled at the idea of snapping Lucius’s suspenders against his back, the rude man deserved that and so much more. To her delight, Luna kept falling back a little, only keeping upright due to the elasticity of said fabric. Giving herself extra time to pull the fabric, Luna cackled loudly as she finally managed to regain her balance.
“A muggle with a horn makes you wish you weren’t born…” Harry sang as he and Pans cat landed next to each other on a cushion. Harry started to swing his tail in time to the beat, smiling happily as Pansy lined up back to back with him. Pansy played with her fedora as she joined in the song once more.
Lucius hooked his umbrella on a tree near him and used his momentum to circle the tree on the sidecar. He took off as if he had been shot out of a slingshot, and smiled to himself holding all of his belongings in his arms. The bale of hay on the wheelbarrow kept on going until it crashed hard into a house.
Harry had jumped on top of the truck’s hood by then and was hanging upside down, front paws on the windshield, still yowling loudly. He shook his head back and forth, trying to mess up the driver’s ability to see. Rosmerta swerved violently for a few minutes until her brakes finally stopped her runaway truck. The truck came to a screeching halt, causing all of the cats to flinch at the sound. Rosmerta hopped out of her truck livid.
“Keep your head up, Scorpius! Here I come!” Harry yelled, diving off the bridge and into the river below.
Harry did his best to land as close to the white kitten as possible and he only had to paddle a little to reach him. Harry grabbed Scorpius by his collar and saw a log floating by. Harry struggled to tread water and get over to the log. Somehow he managed to get close enough to hook a paw over it, and he put little Scorpius in between his legs while he held onto the log. Draco ran at maximum speed over rocks on the river bank to keep up with his kitten. Harry was struggling to keep them afloat, even on the log. The  current was fast and he didn’t really know how to swim. The log dunked them under the water a few times even though he held on for dear life, both his and the kitten’s. Draco found a branch that hung over the river and climbed out to the edge of the branch carefully.
Lucius had finally managed to rid himself of the cat herd, just in time to capture the black cat inside the trunk as well. The cats had almost escaped when he shut the lid of the trunk once more. Looking around to see if anyone had been alerted by the commotion, Lucius whispered evilly.  “You are going to Timbuktu, if it’s the last thing I do!” He shouted, now standing atop the trunk as he waved a club around.
Ron continued running for a while, until his surroundings and fear started to sink in. He looked around the alley he was in and felt fear take hold of him. “No trouble, he said. Well, that’s easy for…for what’s his name to say. He’s got nine lives. I’ve only got one.”
“Come on, Draco. Come on, let’s get out of here.” Harry whispered, wanting to leave the geese behind. “Well guys, see you around.” He called out to them, “we’re on our way to Paris.”
“Whoops!” Luna cried out as she missed her footing, she had lost her bearings when she turned to scoff at Lucius. And with her Spectrespecs on, everything always looked a little wobbly, making it impossible to recover her footing quickly. She started to fall backwards, and Lucius rushed to her aid.
Harry tucked the phone into his desk drawer then, hoping that would help him focus. Unfortunately, he still had the damn thing on vibrate so the whole desk shook as a new text came through. Harry jumped at the sensation, his pen jerking across the page he was working on. He cursed under his breath and quickly fixed his mistake before grabbing his phone.
"If I leaked your photos, everyone would see you. More would want to use you. Surely you wouldn't want that."
Blaise had been trying to rise a fight out of the shorter boy. He could tell by the blond's slowly reddening face, Draco was ready to fight. Blaise wanted that. Maybe he could get the boy in enough trouble to get him under house arrest from the Ministry.
The blond raised an eyebrow. "Does he really think I'm gonna miss a Divination lesson just to meet him?" Parkinson only shrugged.
The room was dark, the only light source emitting from his wand. He had cast a lumos charm but instead of creating a bright white, his wand casted a soft blue glow that reflected off Draco's eyes so delicately.
Draco left the bathroom once he had brushed his teeth and styled his hair. He hadn't used gel. He had decided to go without. As a result, his hair was left soft and bouncy.
"Will you stop for one damn second?" Draco cried out in a raw outburst. He couldn't help it. All three professors had all made pathetic attempts to improve Draco's mood with hallow praises that only succeeded in bittering the other boy even more. He just wanted to get it over with and done. The sooner he left, the better.
Harry laughed lightly. He wrapped his arms around Draco's waist and rested his head in Draco's hair, hugging him. Draco wrapped his arms around the other's neck enjoying the familiar yet unique scent. The scent of grass and peach.
"It's all in The Prophet..." Pansy turned and closed The Prophet to the front page. She slid the paper to Draco. He gasped.
Nott looked awkward and out of place. He still struggled against the bonds but didn't feel as intimidated as he did before.
Draco's eyes narrowed. His mind screamed at him to do something. Anything. Something to make the other boy
It seemed to of taken forever for her to understand the situation. Her head snapped up in a fluid motion as she bellowed, "
Just like he asked, he had recieved the picture of a naked Draco on his knees with his arms behind his back.
"And some of us intend on getting good marks for our N.E.W.Ts" Theo added. Harry flushed embarrassed. He kept his mouth shut for the remainder of the conversation
"Oh Draco. Why didn't you think before you acted? I took you to be... to be more responsible!" His mother sobbed into her hand.
Harry was only a few inches taller than Draco but he needed to wind his head up to take in his features.
The taller boy grabbed his wand and pointed it towards the door. He waited and waited. Nothing happened.
Few Slytherins looked up curiously at him. Perhaps it was because of his too loud plate scraping or instead of his continuous grumbling. Either way, the other Slytherins did not seem impressed.
Draco knew he was beautiful. He had always been told he was and he didn't deny it. The Malfoy bloodline had consisted beautiful looking people and Draco was no different. He had a lithe bodyframe, which he had acquired to play the position of Seeker in quiddich, and he had stunning eyes. His eyes were silver, a fairly rare eye colour to come across.
Blaise had finished surprisingly quickly. He hadn't taken too much photos and Draco only had to try one outfit on. Draco was immensely grateful but suspicious. When Draco asked him why he hadn't taken much pictures, Blaise shrugged him off and said that business was running a little slow due to quiddich season. Older students were out in practice therefore not many requests were coming through. Draco's outer character didn't display any emotion. Only scepticism. However on the inside, he was exploding in a fit of joy. The more time away from Blaise and his business plans, the better.
One Slytherin trait Blaise took with his family was that Zabini's were very good manipulators. A trait his mother passed on. It was difficult for Draco to say 'No' to him.
with her? Don't hate me for being curious. I didn't know you two were seeing eachother." Blaise smirked.
Harry felt his face heat up unnaturally quickly. His throat tightened and the steam from the recent shower started to cloud his vision and make his head pound even harder.
Harry hadn't realised that his mood changed drastically. His face scrunched up to something dangerous and he was grumbling. He could feel his magic erupt around him. Surprisingly enough, his mood change was clear to the whole classroom.
It wasn't like he was worried or concerned about him. He was just confused. No he wasn't upset. It was relieving. Nott wasn't around to bother him which was a relief since he still had to deal with Blaise. Blaise's controlling personality was toxic but Draco couldn't grow the balls to leave or ask for help. It would of been hard to deal with Nott as well as his obvious situation.
Draco's breath calmed down. He hadn't even realised that he had been panting slightly. He looked back at Blaise and the dark skinned boy looked
He gave up on attempting to stand on his feet. Instead, he looked back at the maniac who had dragged him in the first place. He was prepared to shout words that he didn't even know the meaning of. Well, before he spotted the knife resting in the boys clutched hand.
"Potter, I'm intrigued in the situation if your acting mysterious like this." Malfoy rolled his eyes in exasperation.
Draco rolled his eyes but Harry ignored it and continued, "When i came into the dorms, I saw him... and you..."
What was that flash. There was a flicker of light when Draco was chained to the bed. It was the same flicker he saw when he went to collect his books on the floor. Could it be that...
Malfoy's face glowed a bright hue of pink. "Well what in Merlin's bloody name are you waiting for?! Get out!"
While Pansy spoke, Draco felt eyes on him. He felt a few stares poking the back of his head. He turned his neck and caught the eyes of 3 Sixth Year boys who only grinned back at him.
Draco gulped quietly. He blushed an even brighter shade of red. He didn't understand why he was even more nervous about having his second kiss than his first.
Potter wasn't even at the Gryffindor table. He was usually in the middle all the other lions with his muggleborn and bloodtraitor friend but when Draco looked up to find him, he wasn't anywhere to he seen.
Draco had red, puffy eyes. There were heavy bags under his eyelids and his lips were dry. Draco looked tense. His shoulders were kept still and shook slightly. He looked small. Not physically, but there was something about Draco's posture that suggested he didn't want to be noticed.
A few seconds passed by. Blaise only stared as if be were searching for any clues of a lie but Draco kept his face neutral.
"Uh okay haha." Draco chimed awkwardly when he didn't recieve an answer. "Do any of you have any plans today?"
Blaise shrugged and smiled. "Let's go." He sat up signaling the blond to follow. When Draco made no sign of getting up, Blaise scowled. "Aren't you coming?"
Through the Malfoy generation, None of his ancestors went through the trouble of being expelled from Hogwarts. The situation was below them. Draco could feel the glares of the family before himself bore into him. He brought his arms to cover himself. Their stares itched his skin like sandpaper.
Harry finally released the other boy. His face went slightly red when he glanced at the blond's neck.
Draco knew he was close to going insane. Just like his aunt Bellatrix. The mere thought of her made Draco shiver.
Draco frowned at the tame response. "At least I took the time to wear something decent. Your sense of style is atrocious."
What was he saying? He could survive without Blaise. He can defend himself. He was not soft! He wasn't delicate nor fragile! He was defiantly not weak, and he was certainly not
The girl laughed. "Calm down! I was just trying to lighten the mood. Its funny when you get all flustered." She smiled brightly at him.
Harry felt the pain in his head worsen. He squeezed his eyes shut and searched for the handle leading to the bathroom. When he found it, he practically barged into the bathroom closing the door.
The sudden chatter of students snapped him out of his daydream. Students started to pour out of their lessons. He assumed that they were dismissed.
Blaise may of been a horrible person but he was still Draco's best friend. As his best friend, he knew how to deal with Draco's
She had tried to dig up dirt on Harry Potter but nothing interesting was going on. He either kept himself secretive or his life had lost all it's excitement.
The older boy hummed. "You look great in lingere. That was probably the best 75 Galleons I've ever spent."
"Yeah I agree. Mini skirts are pretty overused." Blaise started to pace the room thoughtfully. "Maybe silk lingerie. They are pretty expensive but we'd make the money back easily."
Draco woke up with a dull ache in his neck. He groaned audibly when he sat up feeling his neck throb in pain. He must of slept in an odd position.
The two had left the common room rather quickly. Draco hadn't even looked back at Blaise to see the frown on his face.
"Mate, are you okay?" His buddy Ron asked him. Harry looked away from the blond boy and back to his friend.
"Now now dear, let's listen to what Professor Dumbledore has to say first." Narcissa reached her hand out to place on her husband's knee in a calming gesture. Lucius physically calmed down.
"Wand to the Headmaster's office?" Pansy looked down at her fingers. She looked at her fingernails thoughtfully. Draco could practically see the cogs turning in her head. Pansy had never been the brightest girl.
"I'm just talking to you. What, am I not allowed to talk to my best friend anymore?" Blaise lifted a brow in mock confusion.
The blond turned his head to the person Pansy had been referring to. True to her word, another Slytherin had been looking at him, he gave a charming smile when he caught Draco's eye.
Harry frowned for a small while before replying. "Well its good that you realised your mistake. That means that your aware of your flaw. You can fix the problem if you talk to him."
By the end of Draco's rant, his face was red. He was frustrated. He had spoken his heart in a moderate volume so only few Slytherin's turned their head and focused their attention towards the blond.
"Well, maybe we can talk to him during dinner." Harry sighed. With the help of Nott, Harry was able to sneak into the Slytherin dorms.
His eyes landed on Granger and Weasley. He had forgotten about the Golden Trio ever since Potter went missing. Speaking of Potter, he had wondered. If Nott was found, was there a possibility that Potter was found too? It seemed dumb but it was too big of a coincidence that they both went missing at the same time. Maybe...just maybe.
" Draco cursed inwardly at the blasted name. Blaise must've heard his and Parkinson's conversation. "It seems that you and Parkinson have grown close."
The clothes Blaise looked humiliating. Malfoy's were meant to wear robes decorated in expensive fabrics, not clothes you would see a common street whore wear. Draco reluctantly put on the clothes.
Draco paled in world record time. He lifted his hand to cover the tender flesh of his collarbone. It was a hickey. The reason his mother cried, the reason his father spat, the reason he had no time to explain himself was because of a
"What's being done is being done. I don't want an investigation. The faster this is over with, the better. I'm not welcome in this school anymore anyway."
By the end of lessons, almost all of the Slytherins knew about Blaise and Draco's fallout. To Draco, he had expected the others to shrug the situation off but it had become the centre of gossip, especially around the older male students.
The kiss was motionless at first, neither knew what to do. Soon however, the actions flowed more instinctively.
Draco immediately caught sight of a dark skinned Slytherin. The other boy seemed unbothered by the hot-headed blond that stood infront of him.
Draco was convinced that this situation began because of his rambling. Or his cowardice. He had insulted, not only Blaise, but his family aswell and as a result, the soon-to-be-former student slowly walked, closer with each step, away from the castle he had always referred to as home.
"He made me dress in such obscene clothing. He took pictures, awful pictures of me. Such degrading photos I wish to never see. I hate to admit it, but you were right. But now he won't leave me alone."
"It's a private matter I don't feel comfortable enough to discuss with you yet." Draco partially reassured her.
It seemed like Draco's theory was proven right since Blaise told him exactly what Draco believed was true. It still shocked Draco on how long he slept however not everything comes with an answer.
"Aren't you hungry?" The girl beside him asked. He shook his head automatically. She narrowed her eyes. "If you aren't hungry, why did you get food in the first place?"
Morning arrived quicker than Draco had expected yet he still didn't get out of bed. How could he? There was nothing to look forward to.
"I hope you're happy." Hermione disciplined. "Not only did we lose 45 house points, i have to work even harder to gain McGonagall's trust again."
He rested his head in his hands for a small while. He only lifted his head when he heared the abrupt sound of the shower shutting off. He groaned when he realised that he had walked in on someone taking a shower.
"Please promise me something Draco." His mother turned to him. She grabbed his hands and brought them to her chest. Tears still falling down her face. "Please. Learn your lesson well. It's not easy being expelled but
"Draco, what are you trying to protect? The truth is already out. The evidence is right-" Pansy pointed to a humiliating image "-there. Everyone knows. You need to learn from your mistakes and take your punishment."
Harry walked to the Great Hall with his 2 friends, Ron and Hermione. Well, it was more like he was third-wheeling. Hermione and Ron were painfully in love with eachother so they talked to eachother more than anyone else which ended up in Harry tagging along to indirect dates.
"Draco's body type is alot more...how do I put this...less manly than ours?" Blaise raised an eyebrow not knowing if he had phrased the sentence right.
Draco looked at the other boy, distaste painted his features. Despite this, he nodded somewhat understanding.
Draco grimaced at what Harry wore. It was a red and orange jumper that had the letter 'H' stitched in gold.
The taller boy led Draco to the dorms. When they were alone, Blaise went to lie on his bed. Draco stood in the middle of the room motionless
The mood soured when Draco walked in. The room was filled with mixed feelings. Feelings Draco didn't want to identify.
Harry practically slammed the door shut. He ran around the room looking for his wand. When he found it, he jumped in bed. He drew up the curtains and cast strong silencing charms.
Draco was clueless of it all, he had no idea that almost the whole school had seen him asleep or naked.
"No, I was sorta seeing him gaze at Zabini. I think its him." Hermione justified. "And stop pointing, its rude!"
The two had entered the common room. It was a little full. Everyone had the same idea to retreat back to the dungeons after the last lessons.
Draco sighed. "That's disappointing. I took the time to dress up." Draco smiled warmly. The truth was that he didn't care too much about his clothing.
