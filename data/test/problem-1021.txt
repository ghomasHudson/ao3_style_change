"Put me down, you uncouth oaf!"
"Got it!" Harry yelled back skirting around a group of boys having a drinking competition in the middle of his living room. He pulled his front door open while looking back at his friends.
A short fifteen minutes later, Draco had Blaise sitting at his dining table scrutinizing him with his dark eyes as he stirred his tea. He had just finished explaining the situation and Blaise's silence was killing him.
"Don't ever regret caring about others the way you do. Not ever," Blaise held his gaze fiercely, "You've saved all of us from ourselves countless times and you make us better people because of who you are. Never wish to be apathetic."
Twice.
Harry frowns and pulls Draco's hands towards his lips. Draco feels the horror wash over him before Harry gets the chance to finish what he's doing.
How could this boy be apologizing for helping him? And he
"It's been a while, Harry," Hermione said lightly, she looked like she wanted to pull him into a hug but she didn't. Draco assumed Pansy had let them know how Harry could be about touching sometimes. Something Harry had finally gotten past with Draco and Pansy a few months ago.
"Draco, I didn't- I didn't know where else to," Harry gasped, "He said he was going to...he h-had a knife. I don't-I don't want to d-die."
"Thank you, but are you ever going to quit using pet names on me, Harry?" Draco blushed softly at having brought the subject up. Harry found his pink dusted cheeks adorable.
on Harry-
Before he got a chance to finish his sentence, Draco had vanished behind his front door. The click of the lock echoing into the empty neighbourhood and sending a pang to Harry's heart.
At that moment a young man, looking more than a bit skittish, opened the door. He was a head shorter than Draco with startlingly green eyes framed by round, crooked glasses and messy black hair.
"Most people would have called the police sooner or complained to the landlord first but you've never been most people have you, darling," Pansy said, but the question was rhetorical and they both knew the answer. Draco liked to play hero and he liked to fix people which entailed him nosing his way into others business and having no regards for himself. He said nothing.
"No, no, no, he didn't, no, oh god. Bloody hell. I am so sorry, Draco. I didn't-that bastard wasn't even supposed to be here."
me of you."
The blonde sighed and walked back to the table, pouring himself another cup of tea.
"Oh and then bloody Potter with his stupid charming face and those goddamned pouty emeralds for eyes. Lord
"What time is it?" Draco shrugged the bed covers off and was about to make a dash for the door when he realized his shoes were gone.
"My cousin, ever the charmer isn't he? Come along Ron, Hermione, we'd best leave Harry to entertain his guest. Fancy a drink?" Luna said airily pulling the couple along with her, leaving Harry and Draco alone.
Then a gasp, it seemed Hermione and Parkinson had finally noticed his presence. It almost made him scoff, almost. Hermione jumped away from the other woman like she'd been burned and stumbled over her words.
"I'd take Harry with you to your bed or you'll both be kicked off of the sofa by Theo in the middle of the night. Either way, goodnight, Draco."
Harry caught Draco before he fell down and passed out.
His words are calm and soft-spoken but the way his eyes are fixed on Draco makes them so much more intense and concrete. And he isn't wrong. Draco had had the same conversation with him before. But that time he had been the one to hold Harry as he cried over the death of Sirius Black, of Dumbledore, of Cedric Diggory, of Alastor Moody and blamed himself for them all. But it's different. Those were all good people who lost their lives to Death Eaters and Draco, Draco
"It was ludicrous, really. Of course, Goldstein's parents were informed, which didn't really amount to much considering they are in fact not bigots. But my father, being the awful man he is, took me out of school for a month because he thought I was confused, having a nervous breakdown, sick even." He said finally meeting Harry's eyes again. His green eyes snapped Draco back to reality and grounded him to the present. The words no longer held the flashes of memories they had before and Harry's face dulled the pang of pain a little.
only a child.
A few more weeks past and Harry had shown up to Draco's flat many times for tea. The first time it had been awkward and the air felt heavy with the unspoken words, but soon enough they settled into a tentative friendship.
"Or you could move into my house. You know my mother adores you." Blaise said as Theo nodded along.
Draco stopped again and sipped some of his tea. He hadn't been able to get more than a couple of words out before he felt choked up again. This was horrible.
But he looks tired. The bags under his eyes are darker, deeper, and his skin is more sallow. He's paler than he once was, his brown skin no longer looks dusted in gold and sunlight but his hair is the same disaster of dark raven curls. It never changes even when the rest of him does.
"It does matter." Sirius said sharply, "When it's you, Draco, it always matters. Are we clear?
"What about you, Harry? How've you been?"
Fury coursed its way through Sirius body as he processed his son's words. He pulled Draco's arm off of his face and pulled him out of Remus' lap so they were eye to eye. Piercing eyes focused on Draco as he spoke.
"Your father, no matter how much of a right ponce he is, loves you, fiercely and unconditionally. I watched him have it out with that arse of a professor we had for Astronomy in third year, all because the sorry sod had accused you of cheating. Your father went out of his way to defend you and even got the wanker fired. Your sexuality won't change the fact that he loves you." Harry said giving Draco a toothy grin after calling his father a ponce. He was rather proud of himself for finding a way to comfort Draco and simultaneously insult his father.
"Ron I-this isn't- it's not what it-"
a/n I am
"Yeah, something like
"All right."
"Touch him again, I
Harry scowled at him and looked at Blaise next as if to ask him the same question.
They locked eyes and Draco spoke, his voice quiet, almost delicate, "You heard me,
"We are leaving," Lucius announced pulling his son along. Harry looked up from his position on the ground and was seriously debating on whether or not he should just charge at the bloody git who dared harm Draco in his presence. It was, after all, a very tempting idea. But, being the wise person he was, he thought better of it and remained silent. He knew this was something Draco had to do alone. He knew his boyfriend was stronger and braver than anyone gave him credit for. He could do this.
He dragged his way from the kitchen to his bedroom and grabbed his cell to message- he didn't know who. Pansy? No, she would go into a full rage and
Harry chewed on his lower lip worriedly. He'd only ever met Draco's mother, a lovely witch who was equal parts elegant, kind, and fierce. No wonder she had left Mr Malfoy. He was vile, cruel, and pathetic. The complete opposite of the refined woman she was.
"Right, I'm sorry to disturb you so late then. I'm Draco, by the way, and the 'sir' isn't necessary." Draco said, taking a deep breath, as he tried to calm himself down. No use getting worked up over the few signs of abuse this stranger was harbouring. He couldn't do anything about it despite his need to fix things. And he didn't even know for sure if there was an 'it' to do anything about as it was.
"The Malfoy heir should never participate in such foul, distasteful behaviour. If you truly believe you are 'in love' with the Potter Boy, I suggest you leave. You are not welcome here and you are no son of mine."
"I'm so sorry Harry. She just- Ron was gone for a month-long undercover mission and I was so afraid he might not make it back. Pansy was
“An unfortunate truth of the universe. Now, let’s go before Ginerva shows up too.”
about it." She said, with an appalled shake of her head. And they all grinned at her.
"Wait!"
Draco opened his mouth to speak when he was hit with a wave of flashing memories: feeling dizzy, Theodore touching him, on top of him,
no less. You've truly tarnished yourself, Draco." Lucius drawled bitterly as he looked down at Harry with the utmost disgust, his lips curling nastily.
date-rape drug and I was felt up. Same bloke tried to take advantage of me, I passed out, oh and then had another panic attack. So that's how that went."
"That will be quite enough of that, Mister Potter. Thank you." Headmistress McGonagall said as she laid a hand on Harry's shoulder. The tension in his back bled out as he allowed himself to be manoeuvred away from Lucius and into Draco's awaiting arms.
"I take it, you're done. Can I let go to get something to fix your hand with?"
"Oh! Oh, you're his cousin with-I mean he told me- well he shouldn't have told me anything. It wasn't his place to tell me anything of the sort. Lord, sorry," Draco huffed flustered, his cheeks pinking at his sudden outburst. Harry really shouldn't have told him such personal things about his cousin. He knew how imposing it felt to have someone know about things you didn't want them to know. Dudley only laughed a little and grinned at him.
Draco watched Harry's hopeful expression falter, a thoughtful half-smile settling on his face instead. He did not understand what this boy was thinking.
Draco let out another earth-shattering sob and wrapped his arms around her. He loved Harry's mother almost as much as he loved his own. And he really needed the physical comforts his family lacked. Everything
"Says the one who was just beating on me,"
"Harry, darling, I'm Pansy. Would it be alright if I took a few photos of you?" Pansy asked, as she crouched down in front of him and he nodded, "Alright, I'll need you to sit up for a quick minute, then you can go back to leaning on Draco, hmm?"
Draco shut his eyes and tried to block out his invasive thoughts. He focused on Dudley's voice and took a few deep, slow breaths like he was saying.
Ron nodded wordlessly as Draco released his grip on him. He stood up and tried not to look at his ruined shirt as he held a hand out for Ron to take.
"What am I going to do? What if he-what if he comes back and tries to...where-where am I going to live?" Harry asked quietly and Draco found himself answering before he could think.
"Whereas, I still have the disgusting privilege of coming out to look forward to. Whoever came up with this was a right bastard." Pansy glared at the ceiling with her words and Draco gave her hand a reassuring squeeze. He knew the feeling, he'd hardly been able to get the words out last year when he had finally decided to tell his parent he was gay.
Throwing one more sly look at him, Draco suavely walked out the door leaving Harry with a dazed look on his face and his heart beating wildly in his chest.
training. And even if he can't look at his hands right now without losing his manufactured calm he knows they're still hanging by his sides, trembling. The hands burn a trail up his neck, brushing calloused thumbs under his jaw, trailing them up and over his cheekbones till they're cupping his face softly.
"You do realize, I bought this on my salary, Pans?" He said, rummaging through one of the boxes labelled kitchen to find his kettle, mugs, and some tea.
"Is it Hermione?"
Luna and her girlfriend, Ginny, had come and picked him up and then they'd met everyone else at the park. Originally Draco hadn't thought meeting eight new people was a lot and technically he already knew four of them so really it shouldn't have been all that much. But it was.
And there are tears in his eyes again. Draco can feel them as they fall down his cheeks. Bloody fucking hell. A piteous sound comes out of his mouth as he tries to catch his breath. He can't.
Harry's hands latch back onto his hips. His fingers pet the soft skin on his midriff making him shiver. He's missed being touched without being hurt. No one else is allowed this close to him without a serious fight. Everyone else is a threat. He hopes when this is all over and it will end, one way or another, that he will be able to allow others near him again.
"Everything,"
"Do you understand me, my lion?
They kissed, lips moving in sync, Draco breathing fiery passion and love all into one kiss. And when he finally pulled away, the pair of them breathing heavily, their foreheads resting against each other, he watched Harry's obscenely gorgeous face and murmured softly,
His hands latched onto Luna violently, his breath coming out short and panicked. Oh God, oh God, did he? He couldn't remember if Theodore had...oh God...he couldn't

"Of course, sir. I'll send it right over."
apologize for existing because you,"
"When she does, do you want to listen to her? Speak with her at all?" Draco asked, finally managing to bring himself to face Ron who wore his emotions on his sleeve. He looked so deeply sad, betrayed, it almost hurt Draco to see the look on his face. The least he could do was handle Hermione once she arrived ready to beg for forgiveness.
when he had to punish Harry. It usually meant that Harry was having a far worse day than he was letting on and the idea of not knowing everything that was going on with his raven-haired beauty made his heart lurch. But no matter how much he disliked the task he and Harry had established rules when they had first gotten into the relationship and Harry had violated them, which in turn called for punishment. Draco sat, stirring his tea, trying to think of a single reason as to why Harry had so blatantly disrespected one of his mate's, especially Blaise who had always been kind to Harry, and when he couldn't muster an explanation for it he decided to ask the man himself.
this was not happening again.
Self-loathing.
"I feel diz-dizzy. My-my head, I can't- god- I think I need-I need to sit down. It's so loud in here. I can't-can't think...b-breath. I need-need some air." Draco struggled to get the words out. Everything was becoming too much. The lights, the music, all the other people around them. He needed to get out of there, his anxiety was bouncing off of the walls and his body became heavy as he nearly collapsed on top of Theodore.
"Pansy, this is not the time for that," Blaise said firmly giving her a pointed look as he pulled Draco further against him, leaning his back against the wall and wrapping his arms around the blonde protectively. Pansy let out a disbelieving noise and folded her arms as she continued to pace.
"You can stay here, and we'll figure it out, you know my parents love you. And he's your father and you are allowed to love him even if he is a complete wanker. Don't worry, love, we'll figure it out, I promise." Harry whispered and Draco curled his body into Harry's. He let the tears run down his face quietly and closed his eyes.
"Course, love." Harry nodded walking off as he heard the blonde suggest a movie night and take out.
The next day the trio had cooked up a large and fancy breakfast for Draco's parents as a thank you. The three lazed around for most of the day, playing board games and talking until Pansy's old nursemaid, Anna, came to pick her up.
Ron gave him a kind smile, then turned to leave, but not before flipping Harry off and shouting, "A whole
pour la honte = for shame
Draco watched as she went stoic and stiff, her relaxed posture turning rigid, her lips pressed into a thin line and fingers twitching at her side. It gave him a small pang of satisfaction. He knew it bothered her. Being called out for what she was, what she did. But she wouldn’t deny it. Despite what she had done, denial of it was beneath her and they both knew it. It was tasteless to pretend what he said wasn’t true. A fact that would bother her in and of itself.
"My love, my sweet pet, have we not talked about this, hmm?" Harry mused a faux stern expression on his face as Draco gazed back at him. His pet tilted his head to the side, raising a pale eyebrow in question, and dragged his tongue along his bottom lip. The movement made Harry want to suck on it.
shields cracking and he lets them slide away, a violent sob clawing its way out of his throat. It leaves his mouth and makes him feel raw and exposed. It's heart-wrenching and frightening how broken he sounds. And it
"That is
"-you hardly know me, I bet you couldn't even tell me my last name-"
. Leo always was loud and reckless in his acts of defiance and his screaming had caught the attention of the Carrows. They told Draco either he could punish him or they would, so he had grabbed Leo by his robe front and dragged him into the nearest classroom shouting and struggling and cursing the whole way there.
Draco resisted the urge to snort again as he carded a hand through his mused hair. He and Pansy both really did have quite a flair for the dramatics. It was a wonder how the world survived with the pair of them as friends.
"Draco? My love? Are you all the way back with me?" Harry sounds hopeful, his eyebrows scrunch in question, and it makes Draco's heart clench. He's missed him. He hasn't seen Harry in three weeks. It's been too long. This war has been too long. He hasn't properly looked at him yet. And he is still beautiful, still so painfully open despite who Draco is.
Draco stumbled out of the fireplace and into the Weasley’s cluttered living room. The smell of Mrs Weasley's famous cooking filled the room and made Draco’s stomach rumble hungrily. It also almost managed to soothe his irritation. Almost.
"You don't have to-"
"Wait, Draco, maybe you shouldn't be moving around so much-"
A shiver ran down his spine as the air of the chamber hit him. Harry leant back into his throne and raked his eyes over his pet's beautiful body, taking in every inch of creamy white skin. His fingers itched to touch and mark him in every way possible. The poor thing was trembling in his lap, his pretty pink cock hard and leaking precome, face flushed with tears in his eyes from his desperation.
Draco was cut off by a loud squeak leaving his mouth. Blaise had jumping up quickly startling him before physically lifting the blonde's small frame and easily throwing him over his shoulder. Bloody rugby players with their brute strength!
"Okay, you need to slow down for a second, Draco. What's wrong?"
Draco pulled her hands off of the door and his wrist and held them in his own hands. He smoothed his thumbs over the back of her hands over and over again. He couldn't remember when his hands had gotten larger than hers and the thought saddened him a little.
Harry dragged a hand through his hair roughly over and over. A nervous tick, like how Dad bit the inside of his cheek or Papa tapped, his fingers, his foot. Draco watched silently, waiting for the rest of the story as he carefully placed the glass down on the nightstand.
"Hey, we're alright. Just breathe, Draco. You're okay, safe." Dudley soothed and it was then when Draco noticed how stuttered his breathing had become and how shaky he felt. Dudley's voice was pitched lower than expected but he continued to whisper comforting nonsense as Draco desperately tried to cling to reality. He shouldn't have brought up his biological father. It always triggered the most random reactions and usually let the thought that he was somehow predisposed to love abusive arseholes worm itself into his head. Like he somehow deserved it in some twisted way for having been related to one.
"I've gone up to check before. Harry lives up there with his uncle, I suppose. He looks about our age, maybe a little younger. And he had bruises on his neck, Theo, like hands-choking-you-out sort of bruises, I doubt they were consensual." Draco said, feeling his anger simmer at the reminder of it. Blaise hushed Theo from continuing his disapproval and nodded at Draco.
"Pleasure, Potter, but that'll be my ride," Blaise said, releasing his hand, and turned to face Draco. "I'll see you soon, Draco, my car should be fixed by next weekend. Be safe, love."
“Bloody fucking hell! I did not need to know that,” Draco sputtered, his face twisting into a grimace. He truly needn’t know what it is Granger may or may not have
Harry went and grabbed the bottle along with two glasses. He poured generous amounts of the liquor for them both and then came back to sit on the sofa. Harry handed Ron a glass and watched as he took a large gulp of the burning liquid, downing half the glass, before coughing roughly after.
"Merlin."
, time!" He hissed, slipping his old converse on, feeling anxiety rising in his chest. He crossed his fingers hoping Papá hadn't done something completely mad yet, like call the police or something to that extent.
Ron took in a sharp breath, pulling his previously bloody hand in front of his face and flexing his fingers a couple of times. Malfoy was a bloody good healer, he thought.
At the beginning of the night, the entire group had been piled together for food and drinks. The entirety of which Draco was happy to sit back and listen to them tell stories only speaking to exchange a few words with Luna and Ginny. It had been fine. They were all nice enough but they had long since finished eating and now he felt like he was some sort of burden. An imposter amongst friends.
Draco's heart jumped at the words. Harry didn't think he was difficult, he had been joking, picking fun. And he had thought that a small part of him had even known it, but it was reassuring to hear. There'd been a time where Draco probably would have snapped back with something far worse than being called difficult.
a/n hello, loves! it's been a while but I've apologized quite a bit over my messed up writing schedule (it really is difficult to write for fun when you
"And, I'll be here to end the sorry wanker who decides to lay a finger on my son."
"Look at me, my love."
"I'm fine. Where is my phone, what time is it? Where are my shoes?" Draco huffed helping himself up and shrugging away from Harry's hands.
Lucius pulled Draco harshly towards him, little beads of blood surfacing as he tore Draco's delicate skin in the process. And Harry's fury only seemed to grow at his actions. Who cared if Lucius smacked him around and threw slurs at him, but how dare he touch Draco like that! How dare he dig his nails into his arm so painfully that it left blood trickling down onto the cobblestone floor. Harry could see nothing but red as he grit his teeth.
“Oh, bugger off! Go console your heartbroken brother!” Draco snapped, his hands coming up to cover his flushed face. The twins walked away laughing and only when they exited the room completely did he drop his hands to glare down at his soon-to-be husband.
“Hmm, sorry, love.”
"Ron! You're
Harry nodded and gave his leg a reassuring squeeze which prompted Draco to continue despite his racing heart. He felt like he might throw up. He hadn't thought about Anthony Goldstein or that hell-forsaken month in a while.
pardonne moi, mon amour = forgive me, my love
“Bloody hell, Harry!” Draco shouted, jumping at the loud crash behind him. He turned around, quick as a whip, ready to snap at his boyfriend for being so careless, prepared to wave the spoon in his hand around disapprovingly when he stopped short.
Draco finally unfroze from the shock of seeing Harry fall apart over seemingly nothing and he quickly turned the stove off, putting the spoon down. Dinner could wait. Harry needed him now.
"I couldn't sleep. I kept-I kept hearing

"But I do. I never explained why I was such a prick for that entire year." He said taking a deep breath as he looked up at the ceiling. He could feel the tears pressing against his eyes already. He just wanted this to end!
This is why they all worked so well as friends. They all had posh, traditional (homophobic), filthy-rich, old-English families. And they were all massive homos, despite how much Draco's parents tried to deny it.
Draco's blood turned to ice.
nasty business. The distant memory of slurred shouting, loud crashes and a silver and black cane coming down quickly, making him see stars flashed through his mind. Gods, he shouldn't have mentioned it.
"You shouldn't have teased me last time we saw each other, love," Harry replied, his words accompanied by a far too cheesy wink, that Draco would never admit made his heart flutter.
. I am not your boy, despite whatever predisposed notions you may have of me because of my father's familiarity towards you."
"Do not interrupt me when I am speaking!" Lucius Malfoy hissed as he raised his right hand and struck Draco across the face. A sickening clap rang out in the courtyard as Draco let his head fall forward till it hung in shame, his eyes glued to his feet and a red handprint surfaced on his pale cheek. The courtyard was now completely silent of all of the students’ whispers. Many had sympathetic eyes focused on Draco, but a small few, including many Gryffindor's, were looking smug about the harm that had come to him.
. Then we'll have a movie night. We'll bake some of those cavity-inducing brownies you love and binge on whatever snacks your parents have hidden away. You've got us till late Sunday, darling. You haven't ruined anything."
him and none of them were here.
An unsettling silence fell over the room. Draco could hear his heart pounding and the blood rushing through his veins was deafening as he glared down his father, daring him to speak. His breathing was ragged and exhausted, his eyes burning holes into the man's skull.
"Hold on to me, tightly." He said seriously, then he bent forward grabbing for Draco's circlet and the plug he'd dropped on top of the red silk. Draco let out a small squeal in the process and in any other situation Harry would have done it again just to tease him, but it was not the time for such playfulness. He righted them once more and caught Draco's eyes in a fierce stare.
"I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Harry," Draco murmured looking up at Harry from where he was tucked into his arms. His pretty silver eyes, red-rimmed from the hysterical crying he had done a few minutes prior. He sighed and kissed Draco's temples.
They stayed like that for a while. Draco's hands gripping onto Harry's shirt as he rocked the pair of them slowly, whispering sweet words to the blonde. The sweetness of it all made Draco want to cry more. He didn't know what he would do without Harry.
Draco shut his eyes firmly, a few tears rolling down his face. The numbness had faded the second Harry's house came into view and his sadness came crashing down on him in waves. All he wanted to do was break down right there on the porch and fall apart.
"Okay, I'm sorry. I'll stay here, love." Draco sighed heavily, sitting next to Harry and wrapping an arm around him. He really wished Harry would let him fix the little cuts on his face and his bleeding lip but if this is what he wanted, Draco wouldn't take that from him. He couldn't bear the thought of Harry feeling more unsafe than he already did.
"What Pansy
“You shouldn’t have to deal with such disrespect and cruelty, it doesn’t matter whether you've had worse or not. It’s awful, you do not deserve that, especially not from my relatives.”
Deft fingers run through his hair. It doesn't look how it used to, it's taken on a grey pallor and waxy feeling ever since the summer before sixth year. It's the stress, the bad eating habits. It's not his fault he can't keep food down. It's the nightmares, the way Aunt Bella thought it fun to poison his food every so often for giggles. Draco misses how it used to look. All white blonde and shiny. He misses how soft and feathery it used to feel ever since he'd quit slicking it back with those charms his father had insisted he use. He supposes that's what happens when you become a child soldier, a spy. Things don't get to stay nice or pretty or good.
"C'mon let's get you on the sofa and you can sip some of that tea and let's take these robes off, it's too warm in here for them."
"'S alright, love, you don't have to tell us right now, hmm? Come now, Cub, you're alright. I've got you." Remus hummed pressing a kiss to the top of Draco's head as he stroked his arm in a comforting manner. Sirius was going to get it from Remus later for sure.
Sirius sighed and pulled his stressed husband towards him. He wrapped his arms around his waist and leant their foreheads together.
Draco had never expected this.
"Oh, love," Blaise said softly, pulling Draco into his side and stroking his hair in that way Blaise always did when he was upset. Ever since they were younger, Blaise had always been the one to bring Draco back from a breakdown. Things hadn't changed all that much over the years. And despite feeling ridiculous for sobbing into Blaise's jumper Draco still held onto him tightly.
It seemed Harry spoke too soon.
"I know love, 's alright. I've got you, it's okay. You can cry, Draco, you're allowed to. I'm here." Harry said pressing a few kisses to his hair.
"I won't let him touch you, never again. You're safe now, Harry, I promise." Draco soothed, stroking his hair and pulling him further into the flat.
Draco's nerves had since calmed. He'd quit his pacing and settled himself against the headboard of his bed, his free hand fiddling with the sheets. Harry's rambling always seemed to pull him away from any unnerving feelings he had towards the other boy. He was just so painfully
"Bloody

"What was that?" He asked, running a hand through Theo's hair. Draco nudged Pansy off of him, who went with a grumble and stood up, looking for his slippers.
Draco's blood ran cold.
mon cheri = my sweetheart
"You are far from useless and nowhere near foolish or stupid, Draco. Your father, from what I've heard and what I've seen, is an unreasonable and foul man. He doesn't deserve to have you as a son, he never did." Harry said, his voice firm and unwavering. Draco shifted a little, making Harry raise his head till their eyes met.
"I promise, love, it doesn't bother me nearly as much as it used to. Besides I've been mothered quite a bit by both of your parents. No need to dwell on someone who wouldn't give me the time of day." Blaise said quietly, his eyes falling shut as Draco dragged soft fingers along his temples, the bridge of his nose, his cheeks.
Harry spoke quietly, keeping his head down and letting his permanently messy hair hide his face. Draco moved the desk's chair aside and began to roll up his shirt sleeves.
"Come for me, just like this. Nothing, but my cock driving you over the edge. Come, my sweet prince, it's okay. Let me please you."
"We are trying to make Draco's home pleasant to look at and be in! Don't. You. Two. Care?!" She hissed, scowling as she finished smacking the two up a bit. The boys dodged her on the last few smacks and came back full force to tickle her. One didn't simply tickle Pansy unless they had a death wish and were prepared for violent retaliation.
Harry's eyebrows knitted together and his green eyes shone with worry as he watched the older wizard shout at Draco. He was slightly taller than Draco with the trademark silvery blond hair of a Malfoy that reached far past his shoulders. A permanent snarl stayed on his lips almost like a wolf baring its teeth, and that fact alone made Harry feel even more unsettled at the thought of this man yelling at Draco. He also took notice of the cane the man held that had a snake’s head as the handle, no doubt a wand hidden inside of it, which furthered his cruel-looking image.
Draco learned that Harry was eighteen. He liked football and he could've been a star player if he hadn't gotten hurt in his 4th year playing. He had an intense passion for animals, owls specifically, and he loved the idea of starting a sanctuary. He'd just graduated the summer before, and he loved the stars, Draco being one of his favourite constellations (a fact that Draco revelled in). His favourite colour was gold and his favourite dessert was treacle tarts (which Draco now had a habit of keeping on hand at all times).
The name seemed to snap him back from wherever it was he had gone and he let out a dry heaving sob, tears streaking his face.
"You, Draco Potter, are the
She settled herself on the other side of Draco and tugged his hand into her own. Blaise raised an eyebrow at her but she ignored it in favour of grabbing Draco's chin, forcing him to look at her. He sniffled a few times, the tears having calmed down quite a bit in the last few minutes.
"F-fuck," Harry gasped, his hips jerking upward, pressing his half-hard cock against Draco's plump arse. His beautiful lover laughed in a lilting voice as he continued to suck love-bites into his skin. As Draco went to undo the fastenings on Harry's dress shirt he grabbed his pet's wrist and forced them behind his back with one hand. The other he curled around his collar, tugging him backward harshly, making his back arch deliciously. He watched his pet bend to his will easily and let out a pleased sound. Harry had the sudden urge to eat him out. Later perhaps.
"Harry, it's rude to stare," Mione chided as she skirted past him, "It's wonderful to meet you, Draco, I'm Hermione. And I'm sure you've already met Ronald."
"Please, let this be a misunderstanding." He whispered to himself as he exited the lift and walked towards the flat that would be directly above his and knocked. A moment or so passed and Draco genuinely considered leaving before anyone answered the door. He really wasn't fond of conflict and this could definitely be a recipe for disaster. He had to learn to keep his nose out of others business but...
Then, Draco pulled back, swiping his tongue along his bottom lip and grinning up at Harry who's eyes followed every. little. movement.
"It's alright, my beautiful boy. We'll sort this out tomorrow and if you still want to speak with a counsellor then, we'll find someone who's suited to you." Remus said, rubbing his back, trying to soothe their son. Immediately after he finished speaking, he shot Sirius a stern look and nodded his head towards Draco's shaking form as if to say
me. What's wrong, do you want me to get Harry? I think I'll go get him."
Draco couldn't process what happened next as he barely managed to open his eyes at the yelling. It was all sort of fuzzy. Theodore was thrown off of him, a red blur following after, someone was shouting-a girl perhaps- she sounded familiar, hands were everywhere his own included. A face he almost recognized swam in his vision.
Harry pulled a charming smile on his face, the kind he used for the media and press, before answering.
Harry watched the trembling man lift his head defiantly. A stuttered and awkward movement that looked nothing, but unnatural on the spineless git before him. Harry honestly didn't see why he needed to hear any of this. They had had this conversation before and Harry was unwavering in his stance. Draco would be his and that was that. Although, Pettigrew's insolence
. I'm sorry. I'm worried, I don't want him to go through what he did last year, not again. Never again. I couldn't survive it again, I-I can't-"
him, father. I'd snog him right here in front of you both, like kissing him was air and I was drowning. I'd let him touch me like I'd die without his hands all over my body and I'd make you watch if I could." He spat, venom dripping off of every word as he went. His mother, seated just next to his father, both conveniently out of his reach, looked as though she might faint and that only seemed to fuel his rage further. Her passivity in all situations was driving him absolutely
Draco let out a wail, back bowing in a perfect arc as his orgasm ripped through his body. Such a beautifully broken sound. He convulsed in his haze of pleasure, sobs, and spasms wracking his body. Come shooting up and dirtying his chest along with Harry's dress shirt. He didn't care and held his pet fast, his thrusts slowing to a calm and steady pace as he lovingly fucked Draco through his orgasm. Harry traced light circles against milky thighs, admiring how they shook as his lovely pet came back down, his pretty cock twitching and spent.
Draco silently hoped Harry would just apologize and lessen the punishment that was coming his way but to no avail.
"Alright,
"This was a brilliant idea, Pans, my queen, thank you," Draco said, pulling her into a hug as Theo grumbled about Pansy always winning and why did they even play anymore which Blaise quickly silenced by smothering him in kisses.
," Papá said, nuzzling Dad's neck, leaving peppered kisses behind.
Harry paused and took another deep breath while Draco steeled himself for whatever horrors he was in for hearing. He knew there was something wrong with Harry's muggles because of the immense aversion he had to the idea of visiting them or even speaking about them but he hadn't known exactly what.
"I won't ask you about anything you don't want to talk about and I promise I'm not playing some cruel trick on you. You're welcome, anytime, day or night. And I mean that, Harry." Draco said firmly, putting as much sincerity in his words as he could. He truly did mean it, but he couldn't force Harry to seek out help or come to him, even if he wanted to. If anything, Draco thought that might actually make the situation worse.
Draco's rhythm became stuttered, his flushed face tipping backwards, lips parted in a silent
"It is.
No more than a few minutes later, Hermione stumbled into the flat just as Draco assumed she would. She looked manic. Her hair strewn everywhere, eyes smudged with tear stains and mascara. Her clothes looked out of sorts like she'd pulled them off of the floor wrinkles and all. And Draco supposed she had. He supposed the only reason she'd taken this long to arrive was due to handling Pansy after Ron caught them in their bed together. What an awful thing.
"Heavens above!" Harry huffed, amusement clear in his voice.
Pansy narrowed her eyes and stalked over to the two boys situated on the bed. She was never one for touchy-feely situations but now seemed like a moment in which she should afford Draco the courtesy of such.
"Devious today, aren't we? Sorry, love, we still have to go." Draco said with a smile, landing a quick peck on his still pouting lips. "Please get dressed, I'll make you your favourite tea if you do."
Something looking oddly like disappointment flashed across his face as he pushed off of the wall. If Draco wasn't on the edge of a break down he might've snapped at Harry about how unfair it was of him to look like such a kicked puppy, simply because he had asked him to not hover.
"Try and match my breathing. You are safe here. No one is going to hurt you. Feel how I'm breathing. You are right here, right now, and you are okay."
"Awe, we love you too, Ice Queen." Draco sang, jumping to his feet and pressing a wet kiss to her cheek which she promptly wiped off. Theo and Blaise chuckled behind him and shuffled to their feet.
"Goodbye, 'Mione."
“My, my, you truly are upset over this. I don’t recall when you and the Weasel became so close that you’d defend his honour. How positively Hufflepuff of you, darling.” She said a mocking smirk pasted to her lips, it made Draco’s stomach roll. The way she said weasel reminded him too much of their youth to be comfortable. He’d
Draco whispered pulling Harry impossibly closer and holding him firmly. Harry's breath came out stuttered as he listened to Draco speak.
He can physically feel wetness hitting his cheeks, it makes his mouth twitch down, eyebrows scrunch a little. That shouldn't be happening.
Sirius watched as his son brushed his hands off of his face and squirmed his way between Remus and him, throwing his legs into his lap and his head into his fathers.
In the end, Draco followed her advice, carrying a sleeping Harry to his bedroom and falling asleep next to him.
“You’re such a
"Goodnight, Potter."
"Thank you, for caring, sir, that's kind of you, but I've got to go back in. Wish I could explain the noise, but I didn't hear anything. It must've been the wind, it can get particularly loud around here, especially at night." The man said, with a tone that Draco could only assume was an attempt to reassure him that nothing was amiss. It wasn't working. Draco itched to press the subject further but pushed it aside and nodded. It wasn't his place. He didn't have any real clue what was going on and they were strangers.
"Hi, welcome back," Harry smiled softly, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he did so. Draco took a few more deep breaths to try and steady his trembling. It didn't help as shivers crawled up and down his back, but the fact that he
"Finally," Pansy muttered, leaning again Hermione who nodded along with the statement.
He howled fury making his entire body shake as he slammed his hands down on the dinner table. He was so
"I-er...I...yes. I remember." He admitted looking more than a little flustered as he glanced at their group of friends watching this play out intently. "Maybe we should discuss this somewhere-"
Draco laughs again but it comes out more of a wet sob than anything else. He keeps his eyes closed,  it makes talking easier. The feeling of Harry's skin against his own urges him to continue.
"Lord, Harry, you shouldn't get so angry so quickly."
"You're right."
Draco finally managed to pull out what he was looking for and smiled at his success as he filled the kettle with tap water and turned the gas stove on.
"Right, sorry, thin w-"
"Sure, luv. One song." Theodore said dismissively as he forced Draco to dance along with the music. One song turned into two, then five, and it continued that way until Draco felt light-headed and sicker than he already had.
"Watch it, Dragon, before I make it two hours.
"Look, Harry, Draco's been obsessed with you since third year. I say you take him out the first Hogsmeade weekend back and lay one on him." Blaise suggested his arm wrapping around Ron's waist as he spoke.
oui = yes
Draco gets quiet after that. He gets caught in the memory of this little eleven-year-old boy with dark hair and fierce eyes storming up to him in the corridor in defence of his friends. He hadn't drawn his wand but held up his fists instead and called Draco a bully, an arsehole, a bloody racist bigot. Told him off for being a coward for having something so
"I'm s-sorry," Harry hiccuped, leaning against Draco, "I n-never meant to drag you into this. It's all-all m-my fault."
His pet draped his arms around his shoulders, straddling him. His frown wilted into a devilish smile, teeth bared. Harry raised an eyebrow at him wrapping his broad arms around his back. Draco's pretty eyes flashed mischievously as he twisted his fingers into the hair at the nape of Harry's neck and tugged deviously.
?" Papá innocently replied, giving Draco a quick wink before letting go of him and pulling Dad into a soft kiss.
Draco pressed his face into Remus' chest and he fell apart a little more. Quiet whimpers and hiccups left his body as he wrapped his arms around his father. Sirius' heart clenched at the sight. He hated feeling so helpless when it came to Draco's feelings and not being able to take the hurt away.
be there to forgive Harry for everything and anything. He would always be there to forgive Harry for all the things that he didn't do but still blamed himself for and Draco would try his bloody hardest to convince Harry that it wasn't his fault.
"I won't hear another word of this utter nonsense. Go to your bedro-"
Draco can feel his gaze on him filled with its usual encouragement and tenderness. He presses a kiss to Draco's hair.
"Harry. Sorry, for being so loud. I really have to-"
Lucius grabbed onto Draco's forearm tightly, nails digging into his pale flesh. His nails would no doubt leave marks and a possessive part of Harry's brain couldn't help but think that no one other than him should be allowed to leave marks on Draco.
Draco pressed a kiss to Harry's forehead and guided him to the bed. They situated themselves, Draco leaning against the headboard with Harry sitting on his lap bridle style.
His pet, who hadn't so much as flinched at the belligerent lord's raised voice, let out a small whine. He looked up at Harry with beseeching silver eyes and a pout gracing his pink lips. Harry released his tight grip, massaging his lover's head. He smiled regretfully, raising one of Draco's hands to his lips and pressing a kiss to his palm in apology. He would never purposefully harm his pet unless it was something Draco had asked for explicitly.
Draco said flatly, an irritated look on his face as he drew up his wand,
"Well? Go on, what's so important that you feel the need to threaten the person I'm hanging out with?"
Harry eyed him suspiciously like Draco might take back his words or break out into cruel laughter over what he'd just suggested. Draco reached up and ran a hand through his hair and licked his lips, trying to find the right words to say.
"Why don't you calm down so we can have a civil conversation, this is very unbecoming of you."
"Sorry, Blaise. You deserve better."
"None of what happened was your fault, the war, the death, not even Sirius, but I forgive you. I know you're sorry and I forgive you, Harry. But don't you ever apologize for living because I am so bloody grateful you are alive and I wouldn't be who I am without you and Sirius wouldn't want you to regret living. And you
This was going to be brilliant. A new start. Far away from his family, their dirty money and nothing stopping him from pursuing whatever and
Ron smiled at him sympathetically and pat him on the shoulder, a large contrast from the angry boy he had been moments ago.
He's too afraid of the answer.
bedroom."
"Yeah, I heard yelling. I wanted to check up on you. Did your...um, what happened to the wall?" Draco asked softly, trying for a comforting smile, but he only managed to lessen his frown a little. He couldn't find it in himself to smile at this.
"Where are you, boy!" A voice howled from the corridor and Draco's eyes snapped toward the still open door as Harry whimpered and burrowed himself further in his arms.
"No!" Harry shouted, then quickly regained his composure and continued, only, quieter this time, "I mean no, I just thought you might like to come."
Hermione broke out into a shaky sob as Harry finished speaking. She covered her face with her hands and tried and failed to contain herself.
"I love you more than all the stars in the sky, Harry, thank you." His pet murmured, nuzzling at his nose before kissing him sweetly.
Harry watched him disappear into his house a small pang of hope thudding quietly in his chest. He'd said that boy had been his
- I need to make sure you are
"Yeah, come
Bloody hell. He hadn't meant for it to sound like that. Draco noticed his parents sharing a worried look, having a silent debate about him right in front of him. He hated when they did that. It made him feel broken. Like damaged goods. And he was
, Harry," over his shoulder as he went.
"I warned you, didn't I?" He hissed with a look that could have made any and every one of the students present in the courtyard turn tail and run. He could hear them gasp at his actions and the faint click and flash of a camera going off somewhere to his left. A small part of him realized this would certainly make the front page of the
"I don't go to parties. Not anymore, anyway."
Draco pressed his nails into the pad of his thumb over and over again, the little tinge of pain drawing him away from the dark hole of misery and self-loathing he was going to fall down. At least this way he wasn't drawing blood. And he could remind himself:
go eat?" Ron said with a longing look in his eye when he mentioned food. Harry shook his head at Ron and grinned.
He couldn't think. He was trembling, his eyes closed, eyebrows furrowing, as he tried to listen to Luna's words but every deep breath he tried to take turned into a gasp for air and he felt like he was drowning. His heart was beating so fast he thought it would explode or beat right out of his chest. His mind was racing and he couldn't process when one thought began and another ended. He felt like he was dying. His body hurt, it hurt so bad.
"You know what's worse is I genuinely thought he meant well by it all. By all the threats, the screaming, the hexes and curses, even the poor french girls he tried to throw at me." He snorted at just how wrong he'd been.
-walls. Apparently, there were very thin walls between Draco's flat and the one above him seeing as he was interrupted once again, this time by two different voices. It sounded like a man shouting angrily and someone...whining or crying perhaps?
"My,"
you." He spat, his face mere inches away from the older man. It was a threat and it came out in a cold and detached tone. He barely contained his urge to curse the old man with something foul and unforgivable. No one was allowed to lay a hand on Draco like that. No one. Not even his loathsome father.
He'd never even imagined it.
Draco flushed at the words, opening and closing his mouth like a fish. Harry watched him swallow and twist his family ring on his hand absentmindedly, a nervous tick he had.
love him," An abrupt sob escaped him as he twisted his hands into the pale blue blanket he had around him, "f-uck, Har-ry!"
"Now tell me, what exactly did this boy try and do? Was it the Potter kid? Hmm?
"Thank you, Draco," Harry whispered softly, a small smile settling on his face. Draco grinned back and nodded again.
"What's going on is Granger needs to leave.
"Wait, wait, wait! Hold it right there, boys! Do not move." Pansy ordered throwing her hand up in a 'stop' gesture. Blaise and Theo froze, holding the painting at an awkward and uncomfortable angle as she picked apart whether or not she approved of hanging it there. This was the fifth time she had done this.
She nodded mutely and grabbed a finger sandwich as Harry followed suit. For the rest of the meal, they dined in silence, the atmosphere hanging heavy with despair and the odd sniffle from Hermione.
was not lost on him. As in
"Well, Potter, did you even
"Do you remember fifth year?" Draco mumbled looking down at his lap. He could feel Harry's eyes on him as he tapped on his glass. Merlin, he never thought he'd tell anyone this.
Harry and them had met up for an early dinner the day after he'd had the whole fiasco with Draco and his friend. And he had just finished explaining what went down, which had incited Hermione's wrath.
"Look," Harry handed Draco his phone which he took without another thought, "look, Harry. Thank you for helping me with all this, but I need to go home."
. Draco cringed as the bitter thought ran through his head. He knew it wasn't how Blaise meant it. He was only feeling irritated because Potter had decided to come and play hero, ruining their fun.
“There’s my gorgeous, green-eyed beauty. May I fix your hand, love?” Draco hummed swiping away a few more tears that spilt down his cheeks.
"Hey, hey, let's not do that, love," Harry said, using his body to support Draco's as he pulled him over to the bed to sit.
helpless.
Draco blinked back the tears pressing against his eyes as he walked up the few steps to Harry's front door. He used one of the posts on the porch to support himself and he tried to swallow the lump in his throat.
"Then if you truly want to apologize, you'll have to wait until he chooses to listen."
Fear.
is how you conquer, boys." She grinned, sitting back with a satisfied look on her face. Draco and Blaise laughed as Theo let out a scandalized huff.
Another silence passed over them, Draco wrapping, what he hoped was, a comforting hand around Ron's free one. He was at a loss. Nothing he said or did could make this better. And Ron looked like he was seeing ghosts and it made Draco wish Harry would wake up and help him handle this.
The hidden meaning behind
Draco's body shook from the crying as he tried to suppress it all. He wished the numbness would come back. He felt stupid for crying. It was his own fault after all.
A knock on the door startled Remus from his spot in the kitchen where he'd been cooking dinner for his boys. He tossed the apron he was wearing onto one of the dining room chairs and made his way to the door.
He stomped his way back to his flat and threw himself into angry cleaning every room. Draco hated how useless he was in this situation. He couldn't go knocking down Vernon's door and he couldn't call the police, Harry would no doubt deny it all and feel utterly betrayed, which would amount to nothing other than a broken friendship. He could do virtually nothing and it burned.
Draco found himself being used as a shield on both ends as Blaise and Theo antagonized Pansy and she continued to slap at them. He shook his head fondly at his silly friends.
"Draco, wake up. It's time to get up now, Dray."
Harry could feel his face heat up at the indistinguishable glint in the other boy's eyes. He dragged his palms down the sides of his trousers and then twisted them behind his back. He watched Draco lick his lips and then smile at him in such a soft way it made Harry's stomach flutter. Bloody fucking hell. He was gorgeous.
"People always apologize. It's not your fault, you didn't know. I just-I don't-"
-Draco chokes a little at the thought- "It suited him so well too. Little muggle-born Leo with his loud mouth and his stupid bravery. He reminds-
. None of them did. He deserved better, they all do."
"You boys need to quit with this or I might have
"It's fine. I haven't had a panic attack in a while, not this bad anyway..." Draco trailed off and finally noticed they were alone. His eyebrows raised at that, which Harry noticed apparently.
Ron shoved his face into Blaise's shirt, using his boyfriend's shoulder to muffle his laughter whereas Blaise did nothing to smother his blatant snickering. Pansy and Hermione settled for exchanging a knowing look before rolling their eyes simultaneously.
"Sorry, what can I do for you?" He sighed, finally taking in the boy in front of him. He was quite...handsome.
In the end, Harry hadn't been prepared for how gutted he would feel after the interaction. He dragged himself to the nearest apparition point feeling exhausted. Let someone else deal with his best friend's marriage that was falling apart and all of the unasked for feelings that seemed to come along with it. All he wanted was to fall into Draco's arms and take a nap, which is exactly what he did the second he apparated back to their flat.
• • •
Draco followed him through the crowd of tipsy teenagers, most of them grinding on each other to the loud music that thumped throughout the house. He preferred the back room they'd been in, it was more private and had less of the blaring noise. It also happened to have fewer people to deal with. Out here Draco felt as if he couldn't breathe.
," He continued, "you can even have Pansy and Blaise over next weekend. Sound fair?"
, Pansy!” Draco ground out as he began to walk back and forth in front of her. He twirled his wand between his fingers rapidly and shook his head as he paced.
"Coming Uncle Vernon! I have to go, sorry again." Harry replied, turning to go back in and closing the door in a rush. Draco shook his head and sighed. He could be imagining all of this. Maybe Harry was just shy and maybe nothing had truly happened. He didn't know all of the facts. He could just be over assuming and seeing something that wasn't there. Draco shook his head once more and headed back towards his flat.
Draco continued his onslaught of smacks with the paddle. The hits varied from hard and slow to quick and stinging but all came without warning and tinted his bottom redder and redder. By the time Draco rounded on the fifteenth or so hit Harry began to cry, his body wracked with sobs as he began to stutter out apologies.
Draco found his hands pressed into Harry's chest by his very large hands. And he pulled away, giving Harry a weak smile. His body felt exhausted. He felt exhausted.
A long silence passed between the pair, nothing but the muggle televisions blue screen keeping them company in the dark.
Draco dropped his hand and tilted his head to the side, looking up into his eyes. Silver met green. And it was electric.
-Potter that he can't see straight! TELL ME!" Draco screamed. He screamed louder than he ever had before and then some. His throat felt raw and he could feel the hot tears streaming down his face as he glared hatefully at his father. He hated being an angry crier.
He stood up, stretching out his long limbs, then leant down to kiss Harry on the cheek. The action was accompanied by a few whispered words as he lingered, lips nearly pressed against Harry’s skin as he spoke.
the entire week. So? Explain yourself."
Remus immediately began running his fingers through his hair, softly getting the tangles out of it and Draco relaxed further into his lap. The sight might have been endearing if the silence and lack of answers weren't leaving him feeling unsettled. Sirius gave Remus a nervous look, as he tapped his fingers on his knee and his husband matched it with worried eyes as he bit the inside of his cheek.
"There, all fixed," Draco said leaving a gentle kiss on Harry's wrapped palm.
Shame
for. There was a reason he was such a poof and imagining Pansy with another woman only seemed to deepen his appreciation for men. He shuddered at the thought.
"Everyone, this is Draco. Draco this is-"
believe it. Pansy always liked taking things she couldn't have. So, the fact that she’d decided to go and carve her way into Granger’s heart wasn’t surprising.
Draco soothed trying not to think about the fact that Ronald Weasley was crying into his chest with a bloody hand tangled into his white silk shirt. Or how Ron was getting tears and blood on one of his favourite silk shirts. Draco had always been prickly and just because he was comforting Ron did not make him any softer. And he
He ground up against him, making his pale beauty tremble with want. Draco whimpered desperately as Harry rutted against him, his eyes fluttering shut in concentration. His pet knew the rules. He wasn't allowed to come until Harry had, a difficult feat for the current position they were in.
maybe it’s time you did the same,” Draco spoke loftily, cocking his head to the side like a bird might, “Don’t you think?”
“Harry, my love, come back to me. Please.”
" Draco huffed angrily and blew his hair out of his eyes, it was completely unfair. Dad fixed him with a pointed look and Draco almost felt bad about interrupting Papá. Almost.
“Darling, when have I ever regretted anything? I still don’t regret offering Potter up to Voldy,” Draco’s eyes nearly popped out of his skull at that but she simply waved a dismissive hand at him in response, “Oh don’t look like such a kicked puppy, Draco, honestly. Just because I don’t regret it doesn’t mean I am not sorry for it, you and the Savior of the Wizarding World are disgustingly adorable together, don’t you worry.”
. Watch this all be some large plot to ruin Draco further. Watch Harry turn out to be just. like. Riddle. Gods, the thought made bile rise in his throat. Draco knew he wasn't like that. Or at least he really hoped. But still, he shouldn't have come here, he should have stuck with-
. Do you remember that?"
"I-" he huffed with a glower, "No I didn't."
Draco felt Harry pull him off of his mother, who released him and went to whisper about Draco to her husband. Despite not wanting Harry to worry or see him like this he didn't make a move to resist him.
"I love you, Harry." He mumbled half asleep from all the exhausting emotions he'd gone through today.
"Tell me, Draco, it's not nothing if it's making you cry."
The living room lights were on as he walked further down the hall and he found Dad and Papá tangled together on the sofa fast asleep. Dad had his arms and legs wrapped around Papá as if to restrain him and Draco breathed a sigh of relief. Thank the Lord he hadn't managed to get out of Dad's grip.
thing from a burden, and you are far more than what your parents raised you to be. You are Prince Consort,"
"I am sorry about that!"
"Christ, Draco!" Blaise choked out sitting up to look at the blonde who kept his eyes firmly glued to the ceiling as he threw about his hands in wild gestures, pointedly ignoring his concern. If he stopped now he wouldn't get through the story.
Before he managed to wander into the kitchen and ask if he could help with dinner, he was swept up by Harry, whose arms wrapped around his waist from behind. His fiancé pressed kisses to the back of Draco’s neck. The tension he hadn’t realized he’d been carrying seeped out of his shoulders. He lent back into Harry’s strong arms and exhaled contently.
Draco deflated at that. He didn't know. He supposed he'd had some sort of childish hope that Blaise would have a magical solution even if he knew that was unrealistic.
"I know! I know, alright? I can't believe--this thing with Pansy it was...an accident."
The fact that he was trying so hard to apologize alone should've been proof enough that he was nothing like Riddle. Riddle never apologized. He had a knack for pinning everything on Draco instead. And yet, some part of him was still a little paranoid anyway.
"And why do you think he's being abused? You can't always stick yourself into people's lives, Draco." Theo sighed, turning around to join in the conversation. Draco fought off a scowl, he wasn't sticking himself into anything if this Vernon was going to be so bloody loud about it.
He only seemed to cry harder at that but this time Harry thought it might've been in relief. One thing he did know, however, was that as much as he had hoped this issue could be resolved, it looked as though it wasn't an option. Harry had a feeling that Ron and Hermione didn't stand a chance against this.
He chokes the name out painfully and looks at him through watery eyes, "I'm sorry."
a/n I'm going to quit apologizing now and instead
Harry shook his head frantically. He looked horrified like he might be sick. Draco couldn't help but feel the same.
Draco really hoped the unsettling boy would leave him alone after that, to sleep off whatever it is that was in that drink, but Theodore climbed onto the bed after him and bracketed Draco with his arms and legs.
"Alright, spill. You've been all," Pansy made a face and vaguely gestured at Draco, who flopped down on his bed throwing an arm over his face dramatically, "like
Draco was instantly greeted with Mrs Potter's glittering smile which only seemed to grow once her eyes landed on him.
Stop!" He says it forcefully, his hands tightening around his wrists and it breaks him out of his hysteria. Draco freezes, he knows that tone of voice too well. It startles him into silent tears instead of the loud sobbing he had been doing. He doesn't want to hurt him too. And if he hurts himself and carries on like this it
And a small part of Draco still wonders why Harry lets him --the monster, the Death Eater, the coward-- touch him, the sun, the Savior, the brave.
“Hey, love, how’s Parkinson?” Harry murmured against his skin as he continued to pepper Draco with little kisses against his nape. He almost wanted to snort at the question. Oh, the irony that his lover would care if Draco’s best friend, who had quite literally screwed with both of his best friends, was alright.
"I shouldn't be."
that!" Theo said, slamming his hands on the table at Pansy's invasion of his part of the map. She let out a cackle and knocked more of his pieces off of the board.
“Har-”
"Yes. No. Ugh, what am I doing, Harry?" Draco groaned covering his face. "They're going to hate me. They're going to be so disappointed in me." He muttered into his hands.
It was finally Friday and he had agreed to meet up with Harry and his friends at the park for a picnic. Dad had fussed at him about what he should wear and made him bring an extra jacket just in case he got cold while Papá gushed over him and how proud he was that Draco was finally putting himself out there and making friends. It was all a bit much but he'd taken it with a smile and slipped out of the door quickly enough to avoid any overly emotional group hugging that would ensue.
with the people you send to stalk me."
Harry sank further into Draco's side at those words and took in a shaky breath just as Pansy came into the room.
, undressing him-Oh
"It's fine," He hummed then looked at him sideways, "You know, he's strangely protective over you. I've never seen him so mindful of someone else. He nearly took Dean's head off for asking about the touching thing."
"You don't always have to be the strong one, we can be strong together, Siri."
"Luna?" Draco gasped, looking startled and excited all at once. Harry gapped at the pair as Luna walked forward and engulfed Draco in a hug. He watched as Draco rushed out a flurry of apologies as he held her tightly. Harry stared wide-eyed and he couldn't help but wonder how they knew each other because apparently, the no touching rule didn't apply to Luna.
"No, Sirius, we both sent him to that party. We agreed he needed to get out. This was neither of our faults."
"Oh is that so?"
Harry pulled him impossibly closer. He bumped his nose against Draco's, eyes boring into him as he continued.
By the time Draco entered their bedroom, Harry was obediently kneeling by the foot of their bed, facing the door, and completely naked. Harry's head was bowed in submission and he held a wooden paddle in his hands, the one they always used for punishment. His clothes sat neatly folded on the chest at the foot of the bed, his round glasses perched on top.
But he never asks because he knows the answer.
Sommes-nous clairs = Are we clear?
"Don't worry, if worse comes to worst, we can always be roommates," Draco suggested, holding in a giggle at the idea of seeing Pansy with bed head. He couldn't imagine it, her looking anything but pristine.
Hermione looked awful. Her hair was wilder than usual, thrown up in a messy half-bun and her dark skin had taken on a pale complexion, almost like she'd fallen ill. She gave Harry a weak smile and fiddled with her menu absently.
“That’s also how you can make it up to me. Now hurry it up, wouldn’t want to keep Mrs Weasley, waiting.” Draco sang as he waltzed out of the room, purposefully swaying his hips as he went, leaving his fiancé on the floor staring after him in rapt attention. He would
"You'll see." Draco hummed happily, pulling Harry against his side as they walked towards their reserved table.
"NO! Draco, my love, please! Please, he didn't-he didn't mean it! Lucius tell him. Tell HIM!" Narcissa cried desperately, looking wildly between her son and her husband. Lucius stared blankly after Draco and said nothing.
“Don’t
One shaky breath later and Draco found the courage to knock on the door. He could do this. It was fine.
school, which suggests you don't go to school with us."
Harry's even breaths stutter at the sudden contact but he held steady, trying his hardest not to flinch away. He deserved every hit, he knew he did.
"How long till your mother is here, Blaise?"
"Yes, dear, Theo, I can.
As far as Harry knew she'd raised Draco by herself other than the odd holiday or weekend he was forced to spend with his father, something Harry's boyfriend complained about constantly. Although, now that he thought about it, Draco hadn't complained about his father in quite a while. He'd actually been rather quiet about it lately. But Harry had just assumed he hadn't been to see his father in a while. That was his mistake.
"Alright, alright. Slow down, Ron." Harry said softly as he took the glass out of his hand before he could chug the rest of the drink. Maybe Firewhiskey hadn't been the best call. He set down both of their drinks. It would probably be best if he was sober for whatever this was.
"I'm s-sorry," Draco croaked looking up at Blaise with watery eyes and then at Pansy who froze midstep. "I didn't mean to...we-we're meant to be have-having fun b-but I've gone and r-ruined it."
She let out an indignant huff and drew herself up off of the floor, leaving the rest of them to sit up and lean against one another, looking at her with curious expressions.
Blaise fixed him with a look and raised an eyebrow. Draco hated this. Maybe he
Draco set the cups down and cautiously stepped towards him. He had been around Harry enough to know how to deal with a panic attack but Draco didn't even know what this was.
"Of course not. How could I ever be cross with you for protecting me, pet? Besides, I never liked the man, he was a rat for sure."
"Both of you look at me." Blaise snapped, his tone reminding Draco of Mrs Zabini when she was cross. Pansy turned to face him as did Draco and he continued in a firm voice.
he bloody well pleased. All he had to do was unpack.
Harry leant forward and licked a salty tear that trailed down his pale cheek. Draco let out a needy cry as Harry reached a hand back and grabbed at the plug settled in his hole that he'd put there earlier. Harry rotated the toy teasingly. He pulled it out till he felt it pop out of the ring of muscles and then pushed it back in, repeatedly. Draco's thighs quivered at the stimulation, cock weeping against his abdomen, squirming both towards and away from the intrusion.
liked that shirt.
"Hermione, she um-she and Parkinson, they…they were-" Ron let out a frustrated sound and then quickly blurted, "Hermione cheated on me!"
"Harry this is my son, Draco. Draco this is Harry. I believe he's come to speak with you?" Remus said, exchanging a questioning look with his son who shrugged in response. He took one last look at Harry before stepping out of the way and wandering back to the kitchen.
Harry watched silently. His heart clenched at the sight. He couldn't imagine how horrible she must feel but he knew it was nothing compared to what Ron was feeling. A twisted part of him had hoped that Parkinson had in some way manipulated or blackmailed her into doing it. At least then there was a chance for reconciliation, redemption even. Then Ron and 'Mione could move past this. But Hermione was far too smart to be tricked or forced into anything. And despite his deep want to stay neutral and not take sides, he couldn't deny that he was one hundred per cent behind Ron.
"Hey, hey, my sweet love, come back to me. Where did you go? What happened?" Harry murmurs kissing the corners of his mouth. Bringing him back to his body and out of his memories.
"Blaise, Theo, make sure that man doesn't get in here and lock the door. Pansy, call the police, tell them a man is trying to break in with the means to hurt us and that he's already committed assault." Draco ordered, fire burning behind his eyes. This
Blaise, Theo, and Pansy were over this time. All four of them huddled together on the couch with dozens of snacks, pillows, and blankets surrounding them as they watched some convoluted French horror film Pansy had brought with her. A loud thud made Theo and Pansy jump. Theo threw himself into Blaise's lap and hid his face in his neck while Blaise laughed, seemingly immune to the movie, and Pansy clung onto Draco fiercely.

." Draco's lips ghosting over Harry's, a soft flutter of movement.
"Did he rape me?"
"NO! RON! Please, I-I never meant-" Hermione howled, trying to skirt around Draco.
Draco hadn't been this tense or exhausted since that monster of a man and the thought of something bad enough happening to cause this was making Sirius freak out. Draco didn't seem to notice his steadily rising panic and firmly shut his eyes, the unease slowly leaving his body.
That's why he was in prison instead of here manipulating Draco into submission.

"One song, then I need to go f-find," Draco stuttered a little as Theodore pulled him roughly closer, "m-my friend."
He can already feel the
Another silence passed over them as Draco stared off in a daze and Harry stroked his legs absentmindedly.
Granger. Granted in the midst of all of Draco’s school rants about
Harry cut off Draco’s grumbling by pulling him into a deep kiss, nipping at the blonde’s bottom lip as he pulled away. He was met by a stunned Draco. It was downright pornographic the way Harry showed affection so readily and easily. Draco never would get used to it when Harry kissed him like that, especially in such a public setting.
He blinked.
"I only meant-"
"But-"
"What's wrong? You never call me
"I won't pretend to know what you're going through," He said, carefully.
"I'm sor-"
Theo and Blaise were left to clean up all of the games and snacks they'd had out earlier while Pansy, Draco, and Harry went to collect his things from his flat. Draco was appalled to find that Harry had been crammed into nothing more than a closet and Pansy went about taking photos before they moved anything. Draco had never felt more disgusted by another human being in his life than when Harry asked quietly if Pansy needed photos of his other injuries. He'd pulled off his shirt to reveal scars all along his chest and his back with bruises in different stages of healing and Draco felt sick to his stomach. He'd kill that man if he ever had the chance.

His father's words seemed to echo in his head over and over and over again. It had been mere hours since his father had...since Draco'd told him he loved Harry.

"Neither did I."

"A list? Of?"
him in. Opening up and making room for him. He looked so pretty and needy. His eyes screwed shut, back arching away from Harry, hands clutching onto his shoulders urgently. He was so pliant and desperate and open, just for Harry. So very, very beautiful.
"I'm going to give you money to help pay the rent, put Harry into therapy, whatever it is you need."
"I-I really think I should get back to-"
By the time he stops, Draco has his eyes twisted shut painfully. He can't watch as Harry worships hands that have torn people's,
Once everything was said and done, the five of them were crammed together in the living room, the telly playing in the background. Draco sat drinking the tea Theo had made, running a hand through Harry's curls, who had fallen asleep with his head in Draco's lap. Theo and Blaise weren't far from passing out themselves as they lay tangled together on the other side of the sofa. Pansy took up the recliner, mindlessly flipping through the channels, a pair of Draco's silk pyjamas resting loosely on her petite frame.
"Hey, hi, umm," He stuttered out feeling jittery and wrong.
"I'm not a child, Potter. I don't need you coddling me. I
"What a shame, you'll have to wait till I'm finished."
"I ah, yeah, it does sound like a good idea. I just, I don't think I know all of the things that might trigger me. It's only been a little while since...well since I've had to..."
His pet was clothed in nothing, but a piece of dark red silk tied around his slim waist. It fell to his mid-thigh providing him with the mere semblance of modesty. The golden circlet with a single ruby hanging from its center resting on his temple named him Prince Consort and the golden collar studded with diamonds and rubies wrapped around his soft neck claimed him as Harry’s. The rest of his lithe frame was bare, unblemished, and pale as the moon. He looked utterly ravishing. Delectable, even. And Harry wanted nothing more than to toss his pretty little pet over his shoulder and take him to bed. Unfortunately, he had matters to attend to if his pacing advisor was any indication.
"You are being rash, childish, acting a fool. This is exactly what led to your father's untimely death! I would hate for you to be next, Harry. You would start a petty war over nothing, but a pretty face? He cannot even bear you children, what of the-"
between your legs! He is the issue!" Pettigrew all but shouted pointing a pudgy finger at his pet's delicate frame, an action that Harry did not appreciate. His hand clenched and pulled on soft strands of Draco's hair.
Harry passed him a glass of water, which he took gratefully. His mouth felt so dry.
With one last sip of his tea, Draco steeled his resolve and began to ascend the stairs.
He dug his fingers into Draco's waist painfully, pulling his body flush against him. Draco put his hand on top of Theodore's and tugged lightly, hoping to loosen his grip or even get out of his grasp completely as the other boy swayed with the music. He didn't seem to notice and Draco's face burned with embarrassment and shame as Theodore made Draco grind up against him. He hated this. He shouldn't have come. He wanted to throw up.
Draco wanted to disappear. He never should have come to this party. He should have let Harry wait for him outside of the bathroom. Why had he been so stubborn? Anything would have been better than this. This was humiliating and this boy kept
But he won't let him, won't let him get more than a few centimetres away. Grabs his wrists to stop him from leaving, till he's stuck straddling him, wrists clutched into hot palms.
"Pansy?" He asked, a hopeful lilt to his voice and when she only shook her head in response he knew he was doomed. The traitor. In a flash, all three of them were on him, tickling him mercilessly. He squealed at them and tried to wriggle out of Blaise's grip but to no avail.
Harry watched Draco preen at the comment and he ran a hand through his ice-blond hair to smooth it out. Still as silky as ever. As he went to pull his softened cock from his arse, Draco mewled in protest and swatted his hands away from his hips. Harry laughed and went to try again only for Draco to bite his clothed shoulder painfully. A sign he didn't want to be moved or disentangled from Harry at all. And if it wasn't clear enough he clenched around Harry's cock for emphasis making the dark-haired monarch gasp.
Draco was to him, especially after their last conversation. The blonde faced him again and narrowed his eyes.
. It gave him time to muster up the courage to call Harry back. The messages were full of Pansy encouraging him to answer and slipping in some none too subtle threats to introduce Harry to her knife collection if he did or said anything untoward, and Blaise's constant reassurance that he only needed to do what he felt comfortable with, what he thought was best for himself. Good, Lord. Okay, he could do this.
“Whatever is the issue, Lord Pettigrew? I grow tired of your incessant footsteps." Harry said wistfully as he continued to stroke his pet's fair hair. The sooner this was over the sooner he could play with his pet.
He shouted out the window as they rolled down the street.
Draco nodded minutely and studied Harry for another minute before responding.
"It's fine, good, actually. Much better than Beauxbaton. They even have their own pool. I haven't really spoken to anyone on the team or otherwise, but they seem alright."
a/n Hello, my lovelies! It's been a long while hasn't it? If you have stuck with this story up until this point thank you! I am terribly sorry for not being able to finish it. This will most likely be the last chapter in this story until I have the mental and emotional capacity to write a multi-chapter story and complete it. I just haven't been mentally here enough for this recently and I need to focus on shorter things or maybe even nothing at all for a while. Thank you for all of your lovely comments and Kudos! I really appreciate all the kind words! Sorry, lovelies <3
And in spite of the circumstances, Harry smiles at Draco. He smiles like Draco hung the sun, the moon, and all the stars. Draco can't help but think that Harry is the one who should be smiled at in that way. He's the one who will save them all as much as Draco hates the very idea of him having to. It should have never been his job in the first place. He was-

was all he could manage to choke out before tears made their way down his face and he was swept into strong arms. They stood like that for a while, Blaise running a comforting hand up and down his back as he cried from all of the worry and the frustration he had about Harry. Sometimes he felt so bloody useless.
sorry for how long this took. I underestimated my classes abilities to completely drain me off any sort of creative energy, otherwise I would have had previously written chapters so I could try and post more regularly. I promise I'm still trying to write and such, but bear with me as I try to figure out how to split my focus enough to do so. I hope you enjoy and thank you for understanding! As always please be safe while reading! <3
And Riddle was never right.
“You do realize after this you won’t be seeing much of me at all?” Draco asked once he’d regained his loose grip on sanity after the images Pansy had so casually snuck into his mind. She smiled wryly and shook her head.
"Promise?" Draco asked with a watery smile as he stared into Harry's eyes. Merlin! Draco's eyes were gorgeous.
"Do you have anything you'd like to say before we begin?"
Draco’s face burned as he pushed himself into a sitting position, turned his head to look at the pair. They smiled at him wickedly and suggestively waggled their eyebrows.
"Bloody hell, what if-what if they-" Draco sucked in a shaky breath, "-disown me?"
"Here," Harry handed Draco a glass of water his mom had brought in on a tray of snacks earlier. The blonde took the glass gratefully and sipped some of the water.
Bloody hell or that Pansy had been the one she'd done it with. Draco really wished Harry was awake just about now. He'd know how to deal with this better than Draco did.
did." Harry had to take a breath to ease the cold bitterness seeping into his voice and continued, "Lord, Hermione what were you thinking? How could you do that to him?"
"It's alright," He hummed soothingly, stroking Ron's hair as he cried into his already ruined shirt, "It'll be alright, Ron, you'll stay with us tonight and we'll sort this all out tomorrow."
(See the end of the chapter for
The next morning Papá and Dad hadn't said anything about him hiding out in his bedroom the rest of the night but he knew they were worried. They kept shooting glances at each other during breakfast when they thought he wasn't looking. He knew he wasn't subtle when upset, he knew that, but sometimes he wished he was. Maybe then Harry wouldn't be trying so desperately to reach him.
This was not off to a great start at all. Although Harry found Draco painfully attractive, especially when he was bathed in nothing but the yellow light emanating from his front door wrapping a soft glow around him and making him look angel-like, the glare stung more than a little.
"Here try this," Theodore shoved a cup to his lips and nearly caused Draco to choke on the drink he'd all but poured down his throat.
Draco sank down hungrily on Harry's cock and let out a wail of pleasure. He allowed his pet to thrust his hips down almost violently. He rode Harry like a professional horse racer; quickly chasing Harry's relief as well as his own, arms tightly wrapped around his broad shoulders.
"Ah, sorry about that, if it's been an inconvenience or anything. I hate to be-"
Right as Harry had resolved himself to silently pouting in the midst of the two couples make-out sessions, as Hermione and Pansy joined in, Draco came barreling into the compartment. His pretty blonde hair strewn everywhere and his cheeks tinted a lovely shade of pink.
Draco put a tentative hand on his shoulder in hopes of bringing him back.
be the last time Vernon ever put his hands on Harry, Draco would make sure of that.
"Still, it's selfish. The others could be in here hiding from-"
"Are you sure? You're alright?" Draco asked the doubt evident on his face as he laced his fingers together hoping to distract himself from the worry filling his stomach.
"Harry, the door!" Ron shouted over the thumping baseline of the music and the loud chatter of party-goers.
"Gorgeous, your parents love you, so, so, so, much. I've seen the way your mother looks at you, the way she lights up when you enter the room. All she wants is you to be happy, love. You must know that, I know you do. Hmm?" Harry said as he put his hand back onto his waist and gave him a small smile and hopeful look. Draco let out a shaky breath.
"Hey, Ron?"
"Better?" Harry asked taking the glass to set it down and running a comforting hand up and down the other's back. He glanced worriedly at Draco's pale face which was pinched with nerves.
It's his choice, not yours, not anymore."
"Is that what you wish?" Draco quietly asked, his fury having dissipated from the shock.
"Are,"
"Hmm, I don't think I've ever met someone quite like you before, Harry. It's...refreshing." Draco hummed, folding his hands in front of him. They stared at each other for a moment. Silence filling the air as they studied one another. Harry couldn't help but to think he'd never met anyone quite like Draco either.
"Professor! Harry's gone mad!" Someone squealed from somewhere in the crowd. Harry was too infuriated to look away from Lucius' scowling face to see the crowd part to let both Professor Flitwick and the Headmistress walk in.
Draco turned a violent shade of scarlet at the blatant compliment and once over the boy had given him. He felt the urge to fidget and squirm. How uncomfortable. He'd only known Riddle to be so forward and he didn't want to think about Riddle.
"Ronald Weasley, I am certainly not in the mood for this! You come crashing in here shoeless, bleeding, and sobbing like a mad man, and say things like that. How do you suppose I respond? You make it sound as if Hermione is dead, I'm sure she's just fine at work. Now, I am not lacking in sympathy or compassion, but what in
Narcissa let out a shrill sound of disapproval and dug her fingernails into her husband's arm. "So help me, Lucius, you'd better take those words back this instant or I'll make you regret it!" She hissed, her face pinched with motherly anger.
Draco sniffled and pressed his face into the crook of Harry's neck. He sucked a lazy bruise into the juncture where neck met shoulder above the bite mark he'd made at the beginning of all this and left kisses around the reddened skin as an apology. Draco took a shaky breath then spoke in a small croaking voice, rough from his loud cries.
"He thought he could
"I didn't want to be right, love. I'm sorry."
"Look at that, your little half-blood
"I know," Harry hummed, pressing his nose to Draco's hair and breathing him in, the smell of green apples and parchment settling his nerves. Draco was fine. He was safe. Lucius wouldn't touch him again, he would make sure of that. He turned his head, leaning his cheek against Draco's hair, "I just wish you had. Why didn't you, love?"
When Draco managed to get Harry off of him, he settled him on the bed and went to get his first aid kit. Before he could get more than a few steps away, Harry snatched his sleeve and Draco turned to face him.
He turned to leave but Ron grabbed his shirt and looked at him with pleading eyes.
. Love, no. Come here."
Maybe Draco
, don't you patronize me, Draco Black, I do not have a-"
"You go to Hogwarts with a mate of mine, Ron, Ron Weasley," Harry said and Draco noticed the way his hands fidgeted as he spoke, he was nervous. Interesting.
"Yes, they do. As do you. We all deserve better than this war. And you aren't wasting anything, we've got all night."
French Translations
"Oh, you don't have to-"
"Not a word." Draco reminded him, tone steady and emotionless as he pulled back the paddle and brought it forward, hard onto Harry's backside.
all the time! Couldn't they just once tell him he couldn't go out. Like now for instance.
“I’m so sorry, I didn’t-I didn’t mean-please I-please, ‘m sorry,” Harry cried frantically, looking horrified and far off as he dropped to his knees next to the broken dishes.
, Pansy.”
They'd been playing Risk for the better part of an hour and Pansy had wiped both Blaise and Draco off of the board, leaving Theo to handle her assault. The distraction of it all was making Draco feel marginally better, not to mention the shots they'd taken earlier.
"Quit squirming or you'll make me get the polish on your sleeve." Pansy sighed as she went and tugged Draco's left sleeve up. Draco went to pull away from her but she simply held fast and pulled his sleeve up above his forearm.
Draco stood silently and his frown deepened. He knew how much the war still affected his lover even after it had ended four years ago. The minute the name Sirius had tumbled from Harry's lips, Draco realized why he'd been so off that day. It was the sixth year anniversary of when Sirius had been killed. The guilt of having forgotten such a stressful time for his boyfriend made his heart well with sadness and regret, he really wished Harry had told him sooner or that he had remembered.
seemed rather close. The thought left him feeling a confusing mixture of bitter and thankful that Draco had someone if it were true.
Harry's sticky fingers slid from his hole. He wiped them on his pant leg, hands going to lay on the armrests on either side of his throne. Draco's eyes opened at the permission and loss of Harry's thick fingers. His hands slipped down towards Harry's impossibly hard cock still covered by his trousers.
." Theodore said, slipping in some casual pet names as he went and in French, with an almost perfect accent, no less. Draco nodded a little and tried to excuse himself. This entire cocky attitude from Theodore was getting to be all too familiar.
Warm hands touch his neck. They feel hot, like the sun. Draco knows they're not his own. He's perpetually cold now thanks to Aunt Bella's
He is beautiful in a devastating way. It makes Draco's heart lock up with all sorts of mushy feelings neither of them has time for. He smiles a small fond thing as he brushes an errant curl out of his face.
Draco sighs and leans forward till his head rests against Harry's, eyes closed. He strokes his thumbs over Harry's jaw. He needs to shave, Draco can feel the stubble growing in again. It makes him smile faintly, remembering the first time Harry had let Draco shave his face for him. It felt like a lifetime ago when in reality it was a little over a year ago.
Blaise turned to see who had essentially
"Draco, darling, why exactly did you wait till now to tell us this?" Pansy asked quietly, "We've been calling for the past week and you never mentioned any-"
A pause and then,
Draco heard Harry snort at his snark and he smiled at the sound.
Tears wet his face, trail down his cheeks in torrents. He opens his eyes to blink them away. It doesn't work. His hands tremble violently and he tries to draw away from Harry. He doesn't want to hurt him on accident, doesn't want to scare him. He knows Harry won't let him go far so he settles for putting his hands over Harry's heart again, leaving their heads bent together. At least this way he won't accidentally scratch his face with his shaking hands.
"I sent Luna and them out...I just...she looked like she was going to be sick and I didn't think it would help."
Fucking hell.
"I feel as though you're insinuating that I'm a slut, is that what's happening, Draco?"
Draco breathed, picking up his own mug and scalding his tongue by drinking too quickly. The burn of it was a nice distraction from his shock and overall inability to form any sort of comforting words for Ron.
"Yes?" The man asked, his eyes flickering over Draco for a second then landing back on the space off to the side of him. He looked so small, skin and bones. His tanned skin looked pale and he had a sweater zipped all the way up, purple and yellow smudges peaking out of the collar on his neck.
"But-but Draco, you have to-please we're friends right? Let me apologize!" Hermione nearly shouted in her desperation, trying her hardest to catch a glance of her husband over Draco's shoulder. Not for long, Draco thought somewhat bitterly.
"Sure, I'll see you then and I hope you feel better soon, Harry." Blaise nodded, smile still in place as he spoke to Harry once again, only to have the ill-tempered, dark-haired man ignore him completely. Draco apologized once more giving Blaise a quick hug and with one more cheery grin, he apparated out of the house.
"I hope you don't mind, Harry's upstairs taking a nap. It's been ages since he's gotten off early like this. Merlin knows he needs the rest. I really ought to have a word with that boss of his, that man would work Harry to death if he could and Harry would let him. Anyway since Hermione isn't here yet, I assume she was held up with work again? Would you like the tea I made for her?"
know that my mother will sue your arse for all your worth before your father ever lays a hand on me." Blaise interrupted, his tone calm, almost bored. He wrapped a protective arm around Draco and shot Harry a withering look before turning to the blonde. Blaise raised a questioning eyebrow at Draco.
"Love," Harry murmured sadly as he reached out and gathered Draco into his lap. "I'm sorry, baby."
“My love, my darling. It’s alright. I’ve got you, baby. I won’t hurt you, I promise. You’re safe.” Draco soothed running a hand along Harry’s cheek wiping away his tears. Beautiful green eyes finally greeted him and Draco gave Harry a loving smile.
"You stay the bloody hell away from me and my family, fucking faggot!" Vernon spat, his face turning a darker shade of red as he went. Draco stared at him for a moment, wide-eyed and speechless.
"P~please," He moaned, throwing his head back with a particularly hard thrust up. Harry groaned at the pale expanse of his neck. It was covered in nothing, but his collar and a ring of love-bites he'd sucked above it. Fuck, his pet was gorgeous.
Draco said softly, his hands hovering close to Harry's, just in case he hurt himself, but not quite touching yet. He’d learned early on in the relationship that during one of these panic attacks touch wasn't always welcome. Although, he’d never seen one quite like this before. Harry flinched away from his voice and managed to cut himself with the broken glass before Draco could grab him.
"Then leave. You may return once you've decided to act like a Malfoy again, as of right now you are not my son."
"Yes," Harry says, bumping their noses together, "A part of me just wants to be with you for the sake of being with you, but I also know that if you're weighed down by all that you've seen you won't be able to feed us as much information. That is why this is not a waste and it is not selfish. Okay?"

Before Draco could finish his sentence Theodore had grabbed him by the waist and began dragging him along towards the sofa. His brain detached itself from his body and while it screamed in disapproval his body stayed pliant and allowed the other boy to manoeuvre him easily.
"F-for being s-nappy to you and rude to-to Bl-Blaise, I'm so-orry," He sniffed, as the tears continued to flow from his eyes. Draco frowned at the shaky and crying mess of his boyfriend and went to hold him and comfort him when Harry spoke again.
"You alright there, Luv?"
Once they had gotten to the infirmary, Harry continuously refused treatment until Draco was healed, effectively pissing off Madame Pomfrey in the process and making him bleed all over her pristine floors. But he was adamant. He didn't want Lucius' marks all over Draco any longer than they needed to be. And Draco didn't need the reminder, neither did Harry.
"You did so well, my sweet prince, my beautiful pet. Thank you for being so good for me, my love."
Draco shook his head and manoeuvred their bodies so Harry sat straddling him with his hands rubbing at the tears tracking down his face. He moved Harry's hands away from his face and cupped his jaw with tender hands.
"'S alright, love. She has her moments, besides, it's always good to have a lawyer in the family. And Isaac and I have been chatting more. I think I might become a chauffer like him simply to spite her."
Regret.
Mione flushed at the compliments and smiled wordlessly. Harry stared, the no touching rule applied to her as well, it seemed. That and he couldn't remember the last time Mione had been stunned speechless, he hadn't thought it possible. And from the looks of it, Ron hadn't either if the withering glare he wore was anything to go by. Harry supposed that meant he was still riding his jealousy kick with Mione.
let me-" Hermione cried miserably, and Draco felt Ron tense up beside him. Immediately, Draco smoothly stood up, set his drink down, and placed himself between her and Ron. If anything he would try and make this as painless for Ron as possible.
Harry stuttered out tears trailing their way down his face in waves and blood dripping from his hand. He looked like a scared child, trying to disappear. The sight made Draco's body
"It was really nice hanging out with you. I hope we can do it again and I hope you consider me more of a friend now."
know you're allowed to have feelings about your mother's absence, right?" Draco countered, the sternness in his grey eyes not faltering as he looked up at Blaise who was irritatingly taller than him. The dark-skinned boy shook his head and layed down. He twisted his body so his head was in Draco's lap and his long limbs sprawled out on the grass.
Except he has to. They both know he does. And it's dreadful.
"How's the swim team, hmm? We should discuss that before you work yourself into a frenzy over my mother's neglectful ways."
"Yes, right, sorry, sorry. It's uh half-past one." Harry said scrambling to follow Draco as he blundered toward the door on shaky legs.
," he spat the word like it was dirty, "tell me."
Nothing would ever look as gorgeous as Harry, completely unguarded and smiling in this moment.
"Hello, what can I get you both today?" The witch asked, she held a notepad and quill ready to write.

actually helped. Pansy and Blaise plus his parents were the only other's who had ever managed to calm him down before.
That would be damaging and if he isn't careful it could rip a hole into his mind and leave him in a not all there sort of limbo. Although there has to be some sort of freedom in delusion and insanity, at least then he wouldn't remember. But then he recalls Longbottom's parents and the way they can't even feed themselves and he decides maybe that isn't the way to go.
Draco chewed on his bottom lip and paced his room as he redialed Harry's number. The phone barely had a chance to ring before he answered, sounding breathless.

"You're as worthless as your good for nothing mother-"
"Oh um, I changed schools last year. I go to Durmstrang now, better sports scholarships come in there," Harry shrugged. He gave Draco a hopeful look, "So, will you come?"
"He is
"Oh, I'm uncouth, am I? How's this for uncouth?" Balise shot back, a grin settling on his face as he went to dump Draco unceremoniously on the ground only to be interrupted midway by an angry voice that startled them both.
"Thought not. You have none of my sympathies."
Draco nearly dropped both cups as he took in the sight of Ron slouched down in the middle of his Persian carpet shaking. Ron was on his knees, still dressed in his Auror robes, shoeless and cradling a bleeding hand with his entire body trembling.
Before Harry had the chance to respond his pet pulled his head to the side and licked a strip up his neck. His tongue swept flat across Harry's dark skin, swirling till his pet pulled the end of his earlobe in between his pearly white teeth. Draco nibbled at his ear till he got bored. Next, his teeth dragged down to where shoulder met neck. He laved over the tender spot repeatedly and then bit down.
"You really do just say whatever comes to mind don't you?" The blonde quirked an eyebrow at him in question. He looked amused more than anything. Harry's face blazed with embarrassment.
ça va = are you okay
"Ouch, Papá!"
Draco watched his phone ring for the third time that day. It was from Harry. Again.
Harry had to stomp down the anger bubbling in his chest in exchange for comforting his beautiful love. He'd never wanted to kill a dead man more than he did right then. No one should've been allowed to make his lovely pet doubt himself so. The sad smile gracing Draco's lips should never have even been possible. He should have dealt with Pettigrew sooner. He should have cut his tongue out the first time he'd
like to pull on her hair right about now or ruin her nails, anything to wipe that look off of her face. It would be so satisfying.
"Of course not, my love. And thank you, Weasley, I appreciate that."
What was happening? Why couldn't he
Grief.
“You don’t even like her.” Draco voiced his thoughts after a long drawn out silence. Pansy clicked her tongue and fixed him with a look.
Draco listens to Harry's steady breathing and the familiar sound of his heartbeat. He hasn't felt this calm in months. He can't wait for this war to be over.
Once.
"You're crying." He says the warm hands brush the tears away gingerly. And he can feel the way his eyes watch him, waiting. He expects it to happen soon. Expects Draco to break under the heavy weight of despair.
"Naughty pet, aren't you?" Harry murmured, nosing along Draco's chest, up to his milky collar bones, kissing softly as he went. Draco let out a frustrated puff of air and squirmed down into Harry's lap. He wanted more friction, touch,
Draco carefully pulls his hands from Harry's grasp and slides them up along his body. He traces Harry's broad shoulders, brushes his fingers along his too-defined collar bones. He isn't eating enough either, none of them are. Draco skims them up to Harry's neck and cups his jaw with oddly still hands. He's almost always trembling now. But not with Harry around, never when he's around.
a Death Eater doing what they do best. Hurt others. End lives. It is not the same.
"You don't have to wait for me, I-I'll be fine. I'll come find you after, yeah?" Draco said through a strained smile in the hopes of getting him to leave. He needed space and the idea of Harry waiting on him did nothing to soothe the panic slowly rising in his chest.
“P-please, I-I’ll be good. It wa-was ‘n accident.”
"Is that so? I'll have
"Hermione," Harry interrupted her hiccuped apologies in a firm voice as he reached out to grab one of her hands, "I love you, but you need to sort this out. I can't be here for you in this because I need to be there for Ron. I don't want to be cruel, that isn't why I came here, but you brought this upon yourself and you need to decide how to handle this. This isn't something you can simply
After Harry's continual muttering of
"You're going to hate me," Ron said, his voice sounding empty, as he looked at anything but Harry. What was he talking about?
"You're alright. Just need to take a few deep breaths. Nothing's gonna happen, just take a moment."
Draco pulled the robes off of Ron's shoulders and guided him to the sofa, pressing the steaming cup of tea into his hands and placing a box of tissues next to him. He went and hung up Ron's robes in the hall closet, then swiped his wand from the kitchen before coming back to the sitting room. Draco sat beside him tugging Ron's injured hand into his lap, then he professionally cast a few healing and cleaning charms, mending the split knuckles till they looked good as new. He wasn't the Head Healer at St. Mungo's for nothing.
"Do you love him?"
He reached a tentative hand out and pulled Draco to him till he stood snugly between his legs. Harry trailed his hands down Draco's arms and left them resting on the other boy's hips, his thumbs rubbing soothing circles on the exposed skin, just above Draco's hip bone.
Draco let out an exasperated laugh and crashed his lips down on Harry's to shut him up. He snogged the living daylights out of him before pulling back, leaving a dazed look on his face.
tu vas bien = you're okay
But he won't.
Ron took in a ragged breath as Harry set a hand on his shoulder and rubbed it in a comforting way. Whatever had happened had really taken a toll on him.
." Draco's nose wrinkled at his parents' public display and he grimaced as Papá kissed Dad square on the mouth and looked straight at him whilst doing so.
By the time he finished scrubbing every inch of his kitchen his rage had given way to worry. What
Harry cuts him off with a kiss. It's slow and soft and mournful. A lot of what they do now feels that way. It feels as though they're always grieving for the carefree love they never got to have.
He heard Harry let out a small sigh. Lord, maybe Riddle was right, maybe he
Draco nodded dumbly and he hated himself a little for the tears pressing against his eyes. Why did he have to have so many bloody feelings all of the time?
"We've got him, hmm? He'll be fine. He tries his hardest to tell us what he has to when he's ready. We simply have to support him and hope he knows he can come to us with anything." He hummed pressing their foreheads together again as he spoke, his hands still resting on either side of Sirius' face, "It would help if you didn't become so angry and protective."
"Hmm, alright well," Draco hummed derisively, as Blaise and Pansy sprawled out onto the bed flanking him on both sides. "I went to a party last Saturday where I saw Luna after ghosting her all last year courtesy of you know which fucker, then I had a panic attack. After which my drink was spiked with only-god-knows-
Draco yelled back. He watched the car fully disappear out of his neighbourhood before the half-smile dropped from his face. He returning his focus to Potter and fixed him with a scowl. Dear, Lord was this going to be irritating. He could already feel the urge to roll his eyes building up.
Draco made a displeased sound at his words.
Draco snorted at that, of course, Pansy would be worried about it being
Draco continued to cry into Blaise. He hated this. Hated that he was so mentally hijacked by the mess his life had become. He thought moving might help, but Nott had managed to mangle that idea quickly enough. And now his best friends were a city away from him because of his own stupid decisions. He felt hopeless.
Draco sobered up a little at the comment and gave him a sincere smile.
"I-I'm so-sorry for be-being alive, for out li-living Sirius," Harry huffed, gasping and choking on his guilt and the tears streaming down his face.
"Merlin's balls, what's going on? Draco?" Harry asked more forcefully this time as he fully stepped into the room, all of the sleepy-eyed confusion leaving his body. Draco looked straight into his eyes and gave him a meaningful look.
"Let him go or you'll have me to deal with!"

"Draco," Harry said softly, "Look at me, love. Please?" He raised a hand and cupped Draco's cheek, wiping away a stray tear that had fallen.
at me, Draco."
"Look, Draco, I'm not sure why I feel so protective of you. Maybe it's because you remind me of my cousin, or maybe it's because-well 'Mione likes to call it my hero-complex, I don't know. But either way, you're right. I
, Sirius!" Remus snapped fixing him with a fierce glare as he tugged Draco away from him and tucked their son against his side. The sheer disappointment settled on Remus' face shocked Sirius out of his lecture and he finally took in the silent tears falling down Draco's face.
Then promptly sank to his knees too and wrapped his arms around Ron's shoulders. Draco pulled Ron into his chest and let the other man cry into his shirt. Ron had never called him by his first name before, let alone had an entire break down in front of him. And Draco had never been more worried about his friend.
The second the waitress popped off Harry looked back at Hermione again and nodded at her to continue. The least he could do was hear her out.
“Hmm, you love me anyway.”
She shook her head and scoffed at him as he stood smoothly, elegantly, so unlike the way he had thrown himself into the chair earlier. He’d since regained his composure and he knew it would displease her more if he was calm in his actions and words. Calm and collected in the face of her wickedness was something she
finish that sentence, Draco, you are not a bother and you know it. You have to tell them or at least, please, tell your new counsellor or tell me or Blaise or someone, anyone. You are so very important to so many people and I -
"You were right, Harry! Father even suggested he take us to London Pride this year, all of us. Wouldn't that be lovely?" Draco babbled happily, finally facing the rest of his friends. The others nodded happily along, scattered responses of congratulations coming from the other four.
Draco shakes his head, face carefully vacant, eyes glazed over as he stares past him. It's too hard to look him in the eye and keep everything perfectly in place.
. Maybe he still stood a chance.
, he shouldn't have been so forceful.
as he slowed, trying to stop himself from coming. Harry smiled endearingly at him. Always such a good pet, even when he was so blissed out he could hardly breathe.
"I was just thinking of you," Draco hummed, as he walked into the kitchen, hoping to put on some tea.
"If I was going to fall in love with anyone, I'm glad it was you," Draco whispered softly, nuzzling his hair.
It's stained with the Dark Mark and scars from where he's tried to scratch off his own skin. It's shameful, and it makes Draco want to pull away again. He doesn't though. He's more here than he was before. More in his body and less in his mind. Harry's heartbeat always seems to bring him back faster than anything else. It's why they send him to get information and not someone else. And they promised never to run from each other. He isn't going to break that promise now.
"Besides, that nice Potter boy came all the way over here to invite you. And you were very rude to him." His dad's voice travelled from the kitchen into the dining room where Draco stood arguing with his papá. He did
And he can't. He just can't.
What were you thinking? How could you say those things to him?" Remus said, he was seething and Sirius could see why. He hadn't picked the best wording for those sentences. He'd meant to say he didn't want Draco to go through hell again, especially without telling them like he had before. However, that was not how it had come out.
"You cannot seriously intend to keep him!" Pettigrew continued, "Harry, my boy, please see reason. Lord Malfoy and Lady Narcissa will not stand for it! You know he has been promised to King Riddle and-"
“Tosser.”
He left a kiss at the corner of Harry's mouth,
Pansy had sprinkled in her own irritation with Granger
Harry frowns at the action but doesn't stop him. Instead, he rests his hands over top Draco's again. He strokes the back of his hands. He says nothing as Draco shuts his eyes and learns to breathe again. And when he's finally caught his breath, Harry speaks. His voice is tender and sweet, his eyes no doubt the same.
Draco asked crouching down in front of him. It was like Ron was looking straight through him.
Draco's face relaxed and the look of terror and panic washed away. He inhaled deeply, slowly, filling the pit of his stomach with air and released it. His racing heart slowed to a normal pace and he finally mustered up the will to open his eyes finding green ones staring back at him.
“She’s a great shag, but no I don’t. I could learn though.”
his arms. His squirming seemed to do nothing to deter Theodore from what he wanted as he pulled both his and Draco's shirts off easily.
"Of course, Draco. I'm happy you had fun. I guess I'll let you get home to your Dad's then. It's late, I wouldn't want them to worry. And thank you for letting me drive you for once, lord, are you difficult sometimes."
This Draco
Draco wished someone would come to rescue him from this silver-tongued, handsome-faced boy with pushy hands. He was far too domineering and resembled Riddle more and more every time he spoke. And Theodore was
He knew he was being sensitive over something that Harry probably didn't even mean. Pansy and Blaise had been called the second he ran up to his room in near tears, a knee jerk reaction to being called difficult. It always made his throat close up and his eyes water. He never wanted to be a burden and Riddle had made him feel like one for what felt like years.
Draco
"Draco." He sighed stroking his cheek softly. Stormy grey eyes finally met his gaze and Draco sniffed a little in the process.
"Alright, alright, let's go then. Where'd you want to eat?" Harry asked as he and Ron climbed into his car and drove off.
"Yes, sir."
-yes, sorry. I should have been more careful." Draco apologized, giving the boy a brittle smile as he yanked his hand away.
He's been staring from behind those stupid and awfully crooked spectacles. His eyes too green, too full of concern and trust and-and something Draco won't admit to himself. He's not ready to yet. It's too dangerous to let himself have that right now. If he does he won't be able to do what he has to, what he
Harry sat on his onyx throne, positioned on the raised dais in the middle of the chamber. He wore the finest clothes of red and gold with an ornate crown perched on his head. Harry looked downright powerful. He ran his fingers through his pet’s ice-blond, feather-soft hair, his fingertips running over the delicate circlet donning Draco's pretty head. His beautiful pet knelt in between his legs atop a crimson cushion, head resting on Harry's lap, eyes closed contentedly.
And with those words, Draco shut the door in his face and locked it. Sirius hopped down the last few steps and smacked his son upside the head.
"It's alright, Draco. It's okay." She said stroking his hair and his back comfortingly. He felts like a child.
A gut-wrenching sob left his mouth and he would have collapsed if it hadn't been for Mrs Potter. She wrapped an arm around him and pulled him inside the house.
He felt the rumble of words coming from the person's chest and he tried his best to calm his breathing down. The hard touch seemed to ground him to the present and after a few minutes, he managed to match his breathing to the other's.
want to have a full-blown attack surrounded by Harry's friends in the middle of the public park. He was so stupid for thinking this was a good idea. He wasn't supposed to be here, he knew he was just some charity case for Harry. It wasn't as though Draco was interesting enough or talkative enough to even be thought of as interesting for Harry. Plus he was difficult and finicky about
"No it's alright, Dean's just a nosey git. I used to be the same about touching, I get it." Dudley said casually as he returned his gaze to the game unfolding in front of them. Draco watched as Harry kicked the ball towards their imaginary goal and Seamus blocked his efforts. Then it clicked.
"I don't deserve to li-live, I-m sor-ry for being the-the cause of all the de-death and for living when they-when they all di-died," Harry gasped over his words trying desperately to catch his breath but finding himself unable to do so. Draco simply and calmly continued to rub Harry's back soothingly waiting for the green-eyed man to get ahold of himself.
"I-sorry-um, goodnight, Potter."
. His pet did so love to play quick and dirty, chasing his pleasure with abandon. He never did let Harry ravish him quite enough.
"Definitely." Pansy agreed.
Draco blanched at the overly affectionate interaction between his parents and gagged a little, "
"Luna?" He mumbled blinking slowly until he shut his eyes completely and he blacked out.
"I'm sorry," Draco whispers back, he's stopped crying now. He's ashamed. He always is after he's had an episode like this. He can't help it no matter how delicate and kind and sweetly Harry handles them.
Harry nodded mutely and let Draco clean him up once Pansy came back with the supplies, although convincing him he had to let go of Draco before he could do so had been a struggle.
"Come along, love, let's go cuddle on the sofa for a tick, hmm?" With those words, Harry's entire body relaxed as he let Draco lead him out of the bathroom and into their living room. Draco usually knew what Harry needed after an attack and cuddling always managed to ground Harry to the present better than anything.
"Hush, now, Draco. We're here, love. We'll come up every weekend once my car's been fixed and we'll make this year just as spectacular as year ten was." Blaise spoke calmly as he ran his hand up and down Draco's back.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!" He doesn't recognize his own voice for a moment, it doesn't sound like him. It sounds hysterical and far away and Merlin, everything
Harry's hips stuttered at that moment driving into Draco hard and quick until he was buried to the hilt. He held Draco still as he bucked up into him, the slapping sounds echoing through the room. His pet let out a high pitched scream from the overstimulation to his abused prostate. His head falling forward onto Harry's shoulder, arms wrapping around his neck loosely. Harry thrust upward one last time and came deep inside his pet, painting his insides with come.
He settled on Blaise. He would listen to Draco rant and if he came over he wouldn't try anything like Pansy would. And he'd always been the best with advice, ever since they were younger. He sent him a quick message asking him to come over and set the kettle on the stove.
him. Draco could feel the need to scrub his skin raw already. He hated this. He couldn't even muster up the courage to tell Theodore off as he had with Harry.
Currently, the pair were sat on the couch, Draco bundled in at least three blankets, his back leaning against the arm of the sofa with his legs in Harry's lap who sat directly across, facing him.
"It's really nothing, it's only...he was right, what he said," He made a vague gesture at the dead body behind him, "I'll never be able to bear you any children, never be able to give you a family. It's-sometimes-sometimes I'm unsure why you chose me. You know who my parents are, whom I'm promised to. You know I can never give you anything other than grief and hardships. You are far too good, too kind, for the likes of me. And I know staying with you, loving you, letting you love me, it's...it's selfish of me. But I cannot help it and I-I'm sorry."
That night he scrubs Draco's hands clean twice. Golden-bronze hands, rough and strong, and impossibly gentle moving Draco's pale shaking ones under the faucet. His look so small in comparison. Weak. Useless. He washes in between Draco's fingers, under his nails, out to his wrists. Let's the water wash away the pain and misery and death from his palms. Till the water runs clear again. Till it is all gone. Except it isn't.
They stay that way for a long while, Harry's hands rubbing soothing lines up and down his back. Until Harry's breathing evens out and Draco can't help but to shift up and gaze at his sleeping lover's face.
"Whatever you say, darling." Pansy hummed, sounding like she didn't believe him in the slightest and far too amused for his liking. He watched her flip off the screen and make herself comfortable, pulling a blanket over herself.
disgrace the Malfoy name with such revolting dalliances any longer!"
"I promise, we will make sure that man stays very far away from you, for a very long time. Once the police arrest him, we'll go up to the flat and take all of your things and bring them down here. And we'll figure everything else out once things have settled."
ready. Not for this. Draco tells him so.
Harry answered it, crooked glasses, pretty green eyes, messy hair and all. He looked distressed, his eyes red-rimmed and his hands were shaking. The skin around one of his eyes was a harsh red like he'd just taken a punch to the face and his lips quivered a little. Draco frowned.
Harry took in the sharp look on his fiancé's face, the malice in his tone as he said the name
"I know,
And with that he padded out of the room and towards their bedroom, leaving Harry to finally hear the story of what had happened.
Harry interrupts him with another kiss. It should be a sin how easily that can make Draco fall quiet. It's an unfair tactic.
"Mister Black, please take Mister Potter to the infirmary." Professor Flitwick said, gesturing to Harry's arm which had a large gash from elbow to wrist. He hadn't even realized he was bleeding. It didn't even hurt. He supposed that must've been the adrenaline. Draco nodded dumbly, a dazed look on his face as he began to pull Harry away from his spiteful father. And Harry would have let him too if Lucius Malfoy hadn't felt the need to open his mouth and speak again.
"You don't have to apologize."
. Or at least Draco felt that way. He felt like such an imposition right now. He almost regretted coming.
Harry nodded again and pulled himself off of Draco, but holding onto his hands tightly. Pansy snap some photos on her phone and asked before she touched him to manoeuvre his face and take off his glasses, to see all of the damage and he let her without a fuss.
Knows that Harry will never leave him.
"Draco,
Harry looked taken aback, how'd Draco know he was going to-
." Draco muttered over and over again trying to calm his racing heart. Nothing had happened and yet the music and people had still set him off. It was overwhelming. He felt like he would run into
"But you are."
"Look mate, I've no idea. If you want him there you'll have to work some of that Harry Potter charm and ask him to come yourself. Now can we
"Hmmm, I think I will. Your 'bloody hero complex' is rather hot. So's the wordless magic, Merlin was that mouthwatering."
The last sentence had been meant as a joke but Draco seemed to stiffen at the words. His smile fell a fraction and then resurfaced looking fake, plastic. Shit, Harry had messed up.
"Hngh~" Draco dug his fingers into Harry's shoulders roughly, "N~need you, ple~please!"
Draco nodded in response and he appreciated his friends more than ever in that moment. He loved that they all adopted the same vendetta against the man outside without so much as a word.
"Dray, calm down. Breathe. It's okay." Luna said calmly using her free hand to stroke his arm, but all he could feel was panic and his throat felt like it was closing up and he couldn't breathe! He couldn't
. And I can't make sure of that if you won't tell people. You promised you would stop. Please, Draco, I can't-"
broken.
“Hmm, let me know when you’ve found the humility to admit what you’ve done was wrong, or, at the very least, enough shame to apologize to Ron. Until then, tah-tah, darling,” Draco said drolly, he heard her let out a frustrated sound and saw her toss a glass figurine she had decorating her coffee table at the wall nearest to him before he took a pinch of Floo powder and stepped into her fireplace.
"I am so terribly sorry for the carnage, my king," Draco pouted, his pink lips quirked downwards, eyes going watery, "However can I make it up to you, your majesty?"
"Mione, I'm home! We can head over to Harry and Malfoy's place early after I change." Ron shouted up the stairs as he shut the door and kicked his shoes off in the process. He had been let off early for the first time in months and it was a luxury he relished. And for once he and Hermione were at home at the same time.
by seeing her. He wished he would just get out of his fucking head.
me just like you can't control what's done
"Thank you, Pansy. Would you mind grabbing the first aid kit, it's in the bathroom, under the sink?" Draco said while Harry fell against him once more, wrapping his arms around his torso. She nodded and went off to get it taking Harry's unsalvageable glasses with her.
Draco let out a shaky breath and fisted his hands into Harry's shirt before lifting his head and sitting back enough to face him. He lifted sad silver eyes to meet his green ones. Harry had to resist the urge to kiss away the tears.
"Oh my-Draco, sweetheart. What's the matter? What's happened?" Mrs Potter cooed rubbing his back and tucking Draco's head under her chin.
Harry hiccuped looking like he wanted to shrink into himself. He kept his eyes firmly shut, but didn't resist Draco's touch as he brushed the broken pieces out of his hands.
Pansy broke off into silent tears and stood up smoothing her skirt down, her shirt, her hair. He hated when she cried, she did it so rarely that when she did cry it felt like the world was ending. And right now it was his fault. Draco stared helplessly after her and he bit down on an apology he knew she wouldn't appreciate.
"Or mine, Mother and Father wish you were their daughter, Pansy. I think they'd try to adopt you if they could." Theo added with a snort.
will be the one in Azkaban." He growled lowly, his heart pounding, eyes narrowed, and a cruel curl to his lips. No one dared touch him, his hair standing on end, magic angrily crackling around him.
"It's nice to meet you both, Harry told me all about how wonderful you are. Isn't that right, love?" Draco asked, stroking his thumb along Harry's side and glancing at him. Harry seemed to come back to the present and kept glancing between Draco and his old school mates before pulling him into a fierce kiss.
He spoke calmly, no malice in his tone but the words probably still hurt, if the look she gave him was anything to go by.
okay," Draco said firmly into the mirror, determination and stubbornness reflecting back at him.
The man growled, his beady eyes narrowing so much that they were only slits. So that was how this was going to go.
"It's Dudley by the way, I'm Harry's cousin. I know there's quite a few of us."
Harry let out an exasperated huff and Draco imagined him running a hand through his hair on the other end of the line. He did that a lot and Draco could hardly keep his eyes from watching when he did. His hair was just so lovely.
he may be a Malfoy by blood but he has never represented you or your awful family. I will
"You, you, m~master! Please, please, fuck me, master!" The pale blond whimpered and panted, writhing against his lap, pulling Harry's fingers further into his hole. His pet's body
a-a child. A help-helpless child. Please don't. Please."
"Hmmm." Draco hummed quirking a mischievous eyebrow at the boys who sent him ice-cold glares in response.
Draco shoved his hands into his pockets and nodded, "I suppose I did."
"I had fun," Draco said, then glanced down at his shoes before continuing, "Thank you, for telling them about my touching rule. I appreciate that and your friends aren't so horrible now that I've spoken with them more."
Ron sank to the floor, his body shaking and eyes wide. He couldn't feel anything. He stared off as Malfoy babbled mindlessly, blissfully unaware of Ron's state.
With a few wordless spells, that he had no idea he was capable of using, he forcefully shoved Lucius against a wall, flicked his wand out of his grip, and had the vines wrap around him keeping him firmly in place.
"It's going to be okay. Come now, love, let me clean you up a little, please?" Draco softly asked, when Harry refused to let go of him when he tried to pull him off. God, everything about this broke Draco's heart.
leave me alone with those blasted monsters ever again!"
"This might all be my fault. I don't-maybe I didn't pay enough attention or I don't know...maybe she didn't-or never.
"Come near him again and
Draco whispers it like a secret, kissing him on the forehead, and then settles himself back down against his broad chest.
And, now, Draco had had quite enough of that.
Harry pulls his inconsequential and fragile-looking hands, a dangerous deception seeing as what they're capable of, down against his chest. The action makes Draco flinch. He puts his large and callous and warm ones over top of them keeping them pressed into his shirt till he can feel Harry's heartbeat. It unconsciously soothes him. And he hates himself a little for relaxing even the slightest after he did something so heinous.
Harry whispered, his voice growing progressively smaller and smaller as he spoke until he stopped completely. Draco nuzzled at his neck and gave him a comforting squeeze.
"Think he'll come to the party you're throwing at my house this weekend?" Harry asked. He wasn't infatuated per se just intrigued, he told himself as he finally returned his gaze to Ron.
“George, Fred, how’s it?” He said casually. Draco let out a shrill sound of disapproval and harmlessly smacked at Harry’s chest. This was mortifying and Harry was definitely going to get an earful later.
mon amour = my love
No, no, no, no, no,
Draco's brain sort of short-circuited at that. Harry didn't want to know what happened? He only wanted to know how not to trigger him? W-what? Sometimes he swore Harry was too good to be true. Or maybe he was just a really good liar.
Draco stopped. He dragged his eyes off the glass of water and locked eyes with Harry. No point in dragging this out longer. Might as well be blunt.
“Talk to him. Don’t worry about heading up to bed with me, hmm, I’ll be fine. We have the rest of our lives to cuddle and comfort each other, he needs you right now.”
"And the
tarnished.
"Where do you attend school?" Draco asked, confusion washing over Harry's face. "You said
ç'est injuste = this is unfair
Lucius clenched his jaw in irritation and Draco felt a pang of satisfaction at the small tell of his rage. His father calmly set aside whatever work he had been doing before Draco had interrupted and he rose from his chair. Fixing Draco with an icy stare, Lucius finally spoke,
"What makes you think you're not a part of this?" Blaise asked, stalking towards him, a dangerous glint in his eye. Oh,
It was a bad habit. A reflex he'd learned to avoid Riddles' brutality. Something about Theodore's demeanour had triggered Draco's submissive survival instincts. He hated it. He wanted to scream and claw out of his grip. His touch
"Again, I reiterate,
?" Papá threatened with a smirk plastered on his face. His dad laughed at them and disentangled himself from his husband as he picked his hot cocoa up again.
"What did you say, love?" Harry asked slowly, carefully, as though he might break whatever trance the blond was in. His green eyes stared intently into silver ones as he spoke.
Draco's world had been jumbled and it took a second to register that he'd fallen on his arse and a pretty-faced stranger was leaning down holding a hand out for him to take. His words lost to the loud thump of the music lulling behind them.
"So, Blaise, how's Anthony? Or, I forget, was it Padma? Her sister perhaps?  Michael, maybe? It all gets a little muddled when you're such a flirt-"
"No. He doesn't wish to speak to you. You need to leave." Draco interrupted, a steely look in his eyes as he folded his arms across his chest. Hermione's eyes widened in disbelief.
"You are
"Ron, help!"
His cheeks flushed and he stammered out a weak.
Draco would be the death of him.
Once he had fully opened his eyes he noticed everyone in the room. Luna sat beside him holding his hand and rubbing small circles into his palm softly. A red-haired girl was sitting at the other end of the bed watching Luna carefully as she held ice to her knuckles and then there was Ron and Hermione toppled in an armchair on the far end of the room dozing off on top of each other.
"Well, since you've asked so nicely. Take what you like, my insatiable pet."
"Yeah."
"Be polite, Draco," Remus warned from in the kitchen. Draco's face tinged pink at his father's words and he corrected himself.
, Draco.”
"Come on, my darling. My sweet love, my Draco. I need you to come back to me." He whispers it like if he says it any louder it will break him. And maybe it would. Draco knows when he goes blank like this it hurts him. He remembers how his pain hurts Draco in return. He doesn't want to feel that. Can't even bring himself to think his name, that might bring all of his walls crumbling down without his permission.
"Yeah, Draco, who said you got a free pass?" Theo continued from behind him. This was not going to end well. Draco suppressed the urge to try and run and turned to face his most loyal and trusted friend for help.
"Goodbye, darling," She said, kissing Draco on each cheek before he pulled her into a tight hug which she tried her hardest to squirm out of. "That's enough of that. And I'll see you at school tomorrow, Blaise."
Draco gave a wet laugh and put his hands at the nape of Harry's neck, fiddling with his hair.
"I- thank you and sorry again. I've got to get back to-"
"You were right," Draco said tapping his fingers on the cup of tea Mrs Potter had made him. Harry's parents had given them the living room to talk, but not before his mother managed to drown Draco in sweets, tea, and fuzzy blankets. That woman was heaven-sent.
"So, Harry is it? What do you want from me?" Draco asked, leaning against the door as a way to block his dad's view of them.
And Draco can still see the blood.
"Not unless you ask me to stop,
By the time Blaise and Theo had joined them, Harry, Ronald, and Hermione were talking like they'd never stopped and Draco couldn't help but silently watch how happy his boyfriend looked.

"Please." He whimpered one last time before screwing his eyes shut and pretending this wasn't real. No one was going to hear him over the music. But he couldn't
flesh and blood from their bodies. He can't bear it.
Around two weeks after he had moved in, Draco found himself making his way up to Harry's flat for the second time. He had almost forgotten about the whole incident, seeing as things had been rather quiet ever since, but he'd still had that nagging feeling in the back of his head that something bad was going to happen.
"Ronald,
Draco knew he probably looked like a disaster, eyes red and puffy, tears streaming down his face covered in pink splotches no doubt, but Harry looked at him like he was priceless, even now.
of, Draco grinned at the thought and swiped to answer his ringing cell.
"No, I haven't told Dad or Papá, not yet. I just didn't want to bother-"
"Bloody hell." He cursed under his breath yanking at the door handle.
Shoes missing and knuckles bleeding, Ron stumbled into Harry and Malfoy's flat.
"Watch your tongue, Pettigrew!" Harry growled his hand falling away from Draco's hair and clenching around the arms of his throne instead. He did not take kindly to such foul words being spoken of his pet. The man ignored him and pressed on carelessly, his beady eyes holding Harry's green ones in a desperate stare.
"Have a drink with me, Luv. Please? It's the least you can do, hmmm?" Theodore gave him a shark's smile and it made his skin crawl. He needed to get away from this boy he seemed too much like Riddle had been before he'd changed. Or before Draco had seen the
He let out a heavy sigh and carded his fingers through Harry's hair once again.

"My father he- I was seeing Goldstein at the time and then I went away for a few weeks for
"You-I really like your laugh. You shouldn't try to smother it." Harry said quietly, peering at him with a shy little smile.
"Sorry?" Draco replied, recognizing the voice as this so-called 'Uncle Vernon' and only mildly shocked by the amount of aggression expressed in one word.
Draco gave him a look. The loving glint in his silver, moonstone eyes going cold and serious. Nearly murderous. The icy protectiveness sent a pleasing jolt through Harry's body.
." Harry smiled, putting emphasis on the word love as he spoke. Draco wormed his way closer to Harry and threw his arms around him. He buried his nose into his mop of hair as Harry's arms snaked around his waist.
"You're okay, it's okay.

When they finally pulled apart, breathless, foreheads leant against each other, Harry could see that all the worry and sadness had seeped out of Draco's eyes. He stroked a thumb across his cheek and pecked his lips once more. An easy smile settling on Draco's face.
of hearing his father dismiss him and his feelings. He was
"You are all the family I could ever want or ask for and if you want children we could adopt, I don't care as long as I have you. You, Draco, are my heart, my world, my everything, and more. Never think otherwise."
Draco knows if he lets the barriers between his emotions and what he's just done down he will fall apart. Knows he won't be able to do anything other than shake and sob into solid warm arms and tell the truth. Tell him that he's disgusting and dirty and vile. That he is
"I-ahem-sorry. I heard shouting and it sounded like someone had gotten hurt. I wanted to make sure everything was alright. I recently moved into the flat just beneath you." Draco explained with an awkward smile. He desperately resisted the urge to ask about the markings on his neck. People never seemed to appreciate his overly observant tendencies.
Pansy opened her mouth and whether it was to argue, cuss at him, or hex him, Draco will never know because he simply continued, refusing to give her the chance to interrupt.
Harry shrugged off his hands and turned back around to storm up to Lucius, digging his wand back into the old wizard’s throat. The older man flinched at Harry's actions and went to speak again when he cast a silent
"Good. Never forget."
Draco, in between those two moments, had risen and elegantly jumped from the dais, bare feet silent on the tiled floor, as he threw carefully aimed daggers killing Harry's advisor. The blond sauntered over towards the body, hips swaying as he went. Bloody hell was he gorgeous. Harry watched him let out a noise of disgust, nose wrinkling adorably as he bent down and retrieved his obsidian daggers coated in tacky blood. The sight made Harry's mouth water. The red silk tied round his waist leaving nothing to the imagination, his round arse on display for Harry's pleasure. Draco wiped the knives off on Pettigrews clothes till they were clean and then reholstered them on his thigh strap.
Draco looked as gorgeous as ever as he stood there in his doorway. He wore an oversized blue jumper, not unlike the green one he'd seen him wear the other day. Oversized jumpers suited him and Harry thought he looked adorable. Draco's eyes, Harry noticed, weren't blue like he'd previously thought, but a beautiful silver that took his breath away. Gods this boy was attractive.
"Okay," Draco nodded, letting the conversation fall away. The pair basking in the melancholy of it all and drinking tea. Draco's fingers drawing circles on the back of Ron's hand, hoping to comfort him in the most minimal of ways.
"Only God knows when I became the mature one of us." He mused with a wry smile when the three of them exchanged a look. That was dangerous and he knew it.
"Thank you, Dudley. I would've hated to-"
"You aren't cross over Pettigrew are you, Harry, darling?" Draco asked innocently, as he toyed with Harry's hair and rested against his chest heavily, "He was ever so bothersome. And awfully susceptible to outside influences, ones working against your interests."
for fucks sake. Harry's head hurt.
"Weasley? Ronald? Ron? What's wrong?"
“Yeah, thanks mate.”
"I never meant for this to happen. It truly was an accident. She and I had been drinking and one thing led to another. I didn't even know I was attracted to women until she kissed me and I don't even know if I am, maybe it's just Pansy, but it was supposed to be a one-time thing-"
"Oh, is that so-
They stayed like that for a while, Draco taking in the breeze and darkening sky while he traced random patterns into Blaise's skin. A calmness overtook the pair, just as the sun dipped out of existence Draco's porch light clicked on and bathed them in yellow light. After the long and comfortable silence, a smirk found its way onto Draco's face.
"Why-why would I hate you for what Hermione did?" Harry finally asked, pulling Ron into his side and hugging him tightly, "This wasn't your fault. You couldn't have known, and she shouldn't have done it. I'm sorry, Ron. You didn't deserve that."
"Yes, well I appreciate her for what she's done for me, but she ought to make more of an effort. Who has a child only to-"
One of the blonde boys said as he settled in next to Draco, leaving a considerable amount of space between them. He was silently grateful for the consideration all of them had been showing him with his no touching rule. He guessed Potter-
Harry took pity on him and pulled him down into a rough kiss. He shoved his tongue into Draco's mouth, sucking on the other's tongue like he'd wanted to earlier. He'd let his pet come before him, just this once. A finger curled around his collar. The other hand he used as leverage to bring Draco's hips down against his, hard and fast. He twisted his hips up as he pulled Draco down. His pet pulled back from the breathless kiss and let out a broken keen against his lips at the blinding thrusts.
"I know."
Blaise Zabini asked, his lips poised with a smile as he sat across from Draco and Harry in their parlour, having joined the couple for their afternoon tea.
"But, nothing, love. If you can see me for more than just my blood, then I can do the same for you."
He spotted his shoes in the corner of the room and gestured towards them. Harry took the hint grabbing them as Draco sat back down on the bed.
"Pansy," Draco whined as she continued to paint his nails a metallic green that shined in a lovely way. His favourite colour too.
Tais-toi!  C'est toujours un ravageur! = Shut up! He is still a pest!
"You too. Bye, Harry."
The pair goofed off for a blissful minute. Blaise swaying about while tickling Draco mercilessly while he continued to squeal and squirm helplessly against his grip. Damn Blaise for being a full foot taller than him!
Harry pouted. Just as Draco went to bribe Harry with some other incentive, Fred stumbled through the fireplace and knocked them to the floor. Harry twisting his body in a last-ditch effort not to crush Draco, who in turn landed on top of Harry’s chest, his hands fisted into his shirt and legs naturally coming up to straddle his hips.
Draco nodded and chewed on his bottom lip, looking at anything but Harry. He really didn't want to ask. But he had to know what happened. He tapped his fingers along the glass of water watching it ripple and finally mustered up the words.
"What happened?"
"His name is Leonidas Baros. The name's Greek. It means lion strength," Draco laughs wetly through the new wave of tears that cascade down his cheeks, "Not a bad name for a first-year Gryffindor is it?"
"Tired. Had a bad attack, almost had two. A guy tried to..." Draco paused and threw an arm over his eyes, "it doesn't matter. I think-I think I want --need-- to start seeing a counsellor again."
"Good, I'll keep that in mind."
Draco walked up next to Harry, wrapping an arm around his waist. He shook hands with Ronald and Hermione with a smile, hoping to break him out of his trance.
"Yes, yes, I know. You're a real-life Saint, a true Golden Boy, only looking out for my best interests," Draco snorted at the sound of protest Harry made, "You can quit your worrying, just ask the question, Harry."
. It had taken a while for them to get to this point and he loved to remind himself of this.
"You know, I haven't the faintest idea why you feel the urge to smother me in your so-called protection. I see no reason for you to act like this, we've barely just met. And another thing-"
Once again Harry didn't speak and only seemed to shift slightly in his kneeling position. Draco sighed and ran a hand through his white-blonde hair. He was giving Harry a chance to explain himself, but it seemed the former was set on not answering him. He exhaled again and closed the distance between the two of them, crouching down in front of Harry.
"Hmmm, I think not," Harry smiled viciously, wrapping his hands around Draco's slim waist and pulling him down, "You started this, pet, now I'll decide when we're finished."
"What would you like me to say, Draco?" Blaise asked, his eyes scanning over him in that calculating way that only a Zabini could pull off.
"Was it?" He couldn't help himself as he interrupted, "A one-time thing, Hermione? It doesn't seem like it was."
They never mentioned Harry's home situation. Draco never asked and Harry never offered an explanation. Although, the bruises that would appear all over Harry's body, at least the visible one's, made Draco itch to swoop in and play the hero. Every time he noticed a new one he had to bite his tongue to stop himself from asking. Either way, he enjoyed Harry's company and he wasn't about to ruin that with his compulsive need to fix everything and help people. At the very least Draco knew that Harry felt safe the few hours he spent at his flat. And for now, that was enough.
Harry took a deep breath. He fixed kind yet firm eyes on Draco. He dropped his hand away from his cheek and tightened the one already around his waist.
Harry's body froze and in a flash, he'd pulled Draco off, jumped to his feet and grabbed the other boys face in both his hands. He could see the subdued grin as he searched Draco's face to see if he meant it. That he loved him.
"Ew! Get a room," Pansy gagged tossing throw pillows at them until they broke apart laughing, childishly sticking their tongues out at her. And all Draco could do was smile. He couldn't ask for better friends. He didn't know how he managed to grow up with the least judgmental and most kind-hearted people he'd ever met, especially since they all had such horrid parents to deal with, but he was grateful.
Draco chewed on his lower lip anxiously and fidgeted before he answered in a whisper.
"Could've fooled me,"
"Okay,"
"I think not." Draco snapped, grabbing onto her wrists and holding her in place, away from Ron, "If he wants to hear any of this he will come to
“She’s still alive if that’s what you mean. I haven’t done anything horribly nefarious to her. Impossible as ever, though.”
"I'm glad you're alright, Black. I'm sorry that happened. If you ever need anything ‘Mione and I are always here in case this git," He jabbed a harsh finger into Harry’s shoulder again, making Harry scowl and flick his finger away, "Isn't around with his bloody hero-complex to save the day."
here and you
Pansy kissed his cheeks too, then tossed her bags in the back seat and settled herself in the passenger's side. She greeted Anna the same way before they drove off.
Mione gestured towards Ron then stuck her hand out to shake, which Draco pretended not to see, instead offering her a nod and a charming smile. "You as well. You're Hermione Granger, yes? Top of our class, you must be absolutely brilliant."
Draco pressed a firm kiss to Harry's temples and then his lips.
"Awe, love. It'll be alright, tell me what happened. Please?" Harry said holding Draco's face with soft hands. He sniffed a little and buried his face into Harry's neck. And he felt Harry's arms wrap around his waist holding him close.
"Please, d-don't leave me alone," Harry whispered, looking at him with those brilliant green eyes, shiny with tears. Draco's heart ached at the sight.
A tight hug later, one Harry hoped translated every ounce of love he had for her into her body, and they went their separate ways.
"Sirius!" Dad sounded aghast as he shouted Papá's name. And it took a lot for Draco not to snicker at the glaring contest he felt happening between them. Papá never was one to censor himself and Dad never appreciated the mouth on him.
She then pushed him towards a beautiful woman with wild curls and a tall ginger-haired man covered in freckles. At first, it took him a moment to process, Hermione and Ronald both giving him fond smiles and a little wave.
Draco said firmly as he held onto Harry almost as though he could disappear without a trace. Harry's shaking shoulders stopped shaking as he finally regained his composure at Draco's words. Draco grabbed Harry's face with one hand and delicately turned his head to face him. Emerald green eyes locked onto glinting silver ones and they held each others' stare intently.
Can see it when he shuts his eyes or if he blinks too quickly. Can feel it under his nails, and between his fingers like it has sunken into his pores. Like it has become a
He could definitely see the resemblance with their all too blonde hair and silver eyes. But wasn't Draco, adopted? He'd have to be, he had two
"Hey, hey, whatever it is, it'll be alright. You'll be alright, it's okay."
"No. It will hurt." Draco says it simply, his voice sounds foreign to himself. Draco knows it will sound lifeless and wrong to him. Right now he doesn't care. He watches how the flames flicker in the fireplace behind him, how the Room of Requirement chose an oddly cosey rendition of the Gryffindor common room. If he could feel right now, it might make him laugh. He thinks it might be funny, ironic in some way he can't process currently.
