“Sorry.” He expertly guided her back to the door and walked with her into the hallway. “But thank you so much for the invitation. I’m very flattered you thought of me.”
“Come on.” She cut him off without even glancing his way, already starting up the latte-making process. “I haven’t seen you off your feet since I arrived this morning. Just take a break, will you?”
Their second round was rougher, fiercer, but no less passionate or intense than their first. Harry took Draco’s cock in his mouth and sucked him back to full hardness, swallowing him deep down his throat until Draco begged him to stop. With his arse already stretched and wet, Harry could easily lower himself down over Draco’s shaft, taking him in just as naturally as before. And then he rode him, hard and fast and with wild abandon. Draco rolled his hips underneath him, meeting Harry’s motions with thrusts of his own, clutching Harry’s thighs hard enough to bruise.
“I’m sorry I’ve been away so much lately. I’ll make it up to you after this whole mess is cleared up, I promise. Now, what’s it to be tonight? Animal bloopers or nature videos?”
Ron and Hermione have found a little cottage in Ottery St Catchpole that they’ll get access to on 28th August. It’s not all that far from here, just a twenty minutes’ walk or so, and it looks really nice, with a well-kept front garden and plenty of space for all the bookshelves Hermione will undoubtedly need. It’s a three-bedroom place, and they’ve already offered me to crash in one of their spares, but since they’re in their lovey-dovey phase, I think I better not. They may be my best friends, and I am happy for them, but there’s still a limit to the amount of mush one’s capable of witnessing without feeling like the fifth wheel in their company.
“Look, Uncle Harry!” Teddy’s excited voice tore through Harry’s thoughts, his beaming smile evaporating every trace of irritation in a single heartbeat. “There’s the tree!”
Smiling, Harry nodded and shoved his hands in his pockets, his eyes still on Draco’s. “I made it for you. I kept thinking about you and your mother, about your happy times together, and I wanted to at least try to give that to you again.”
“How hard can it be to get it into your pretty little head? A is feminine; O is masculine. And as far as I know, I’m still a—”
Just as he turned around, reaching for one of the shop’s black signature cups — adorned with the gorgeous logo Luna had helped him design, an ethereal silvery-blue Patronus in the shape of a classic teacup and saucer — Gabrielle slid up to him, apparently back from her break.
He turned on his makeup lamp and applied the eyeliner he saved for special occasions, the dark lines drawing attention to his grey eyes and making them look smokey. He stepped back to take in the whole package he’d just assembled.
Zabini gave him a toothy grin and disappeared in the sudden flurry of robes, gloves, scarves, and hats being summoned from various dorms upstairs. Harry shoved his belongings into his bag and ducked out of the way of various flying garments as he headed for his room. Since he’d left his wand on the nightstand this morning, he had no choice but to pick up his outerwear the Muggle way.
The man raised his left hand to brush a tangle of unruly locks from his forehead. “Do you recognise this?”
“Oh, Harry. Please don’t say that.” Hermione scurries around the table to sit down beside him, placing a consoling hand on his shoulder.
“Yeah, but…” Harry found it hard to concentrate as the tip of Draco’s nose rubbed teasingly against his. “What if he wakes up?”
Draco’s groan is really all the answer he needs, not that he minds the confirmation from the stirring bulge in Draco’s pants. Harry kisses the spot of Draco-flavoured skin closest to his mouth, the one right by Draco’s protruding collarbone, savouring the man’s salty sweetness with relish.
Whenever something weird happened in my vicinity, I was punished, locked in my cupboard — the one that, at the time, served as my room — and starved, sometimes for days on end. They thought they could force the magic out of me, that they could make me a normal boy they wouldn’t have to hide away or be ashamed of. But as we both know, that’s not how accidental magic works. I couldn’t help it, much less temper it since I didn’t even know what it was. I guess it scared them; this strange, unnatural power that could make inexplicable things happen right before their eyes. (Like the time Aunt Petunia cut off all my hair in a fit of pique for not being able to comb it into submission, just to see it all grown back to normal the following morning.)
You’d think, after everything, I would’ve learned to expect the unexpected. Yet, here I am, a week after receiving your letter and still not sure whether it’s for real or not. Sure, it’s written in your pretentious loopy cursive and has your fancy Malfoy seal on the envelope, but… Merlin, you actually have colour-matched ink and wax? You know you’re just 18 years old, right? Not 81.
He would never be able to recall who leaned in first. Maybe neither of them did, maybe both. It was as easy as magnetism; natural, instinctual, unstoppable; as if — now that they finally allowed it to happen — their very cores acted as opposite magnetic poles, attracting each other, drawing each other in. Draco’s lips were soft and warm and delicious, gentle at first, feather-light, brushing over Harry’s so fleetingly Harry almost couldn’t believe this was actually happening. That he was actually kissing Draco Malfoy. After all this time.
“Well, I accepted it for Charlie, too, but look at him now. Draco, honey, it’s made me so happy seeing another one of my chicks finally settling down.”
he put wards on his flat? True, he hadn’t used much magic at all since he entered the Muggle world, partly because he didn’t want anything to do with anything reminding him of the world he’d decided to leave behind, partly because he feared any use of magic would enable the members of said world to track him down. He’d felt awfully lost and vulnerable without being able to rely on his magic, but at least he’d finally been safe from all the witches and wizards who had taken it upon themselves to purge the magical world of anyone who had been on the wrong side of the war, regardless of the official sentences given and served per the Wizengamot’s rulings. These days, magic was all but a closed chapter of his life, and now he thought about it, he couldn’t even remember the last time he’d held his wand. Apart from the magic still flowing through his veins, he was practically a Muggle now, and, apparently, he’d lost his self-preservation and common sense somewhere along the way.
Even now, long after he’d realised that Potter — that deceitful, lying bastard — had only been playing with his head that night, those words still stayed with him. No matter the impossibility of the statement, no matter the extreme levels of bullshit Potter had been feeding him that night, those four words still managed to ground him whenever his life seemed to be slipping away, whenever his burden felt too heavy to carry.
“One decaf mochaccino and one chai latte, please,” the willowy blonde said, fiddling with the wallet in her hands.
Instead, here he was, sitting alone at his Louis XIV desk, writing out wedding invitations in his best calligraphy for a wedding to a man he barely knew. Smaug was curled up on a cushion at his side, his gentle breathing and the scratch of Draco’s quill the only noises left to distract him from Slyvia above.
Draco loved that bowl. He’d loved it from the moment he’d set eyes on it, the deep red ruby glass that curved up just enough to be a bowl, but not enough that it’d actually hold anything. It had spoken to him, and he’d bid high, wanting to ensure it’d be his.
“Molly, love, you’re scaring the boy.” Arthur stepped up behind his wife and wrapped his arms around her before smiling at Draco. “People rarely bake for her since they know she cooks, but it’s one of her favourite things to receive.”
He would never be friends with Potter. He knew that now. They were enemies, for Circe’s sake, firmly stuck on opposite sides of what was about to turn into a full-fledged war as soon as Draco had managed to complete his task. A fucking
Surely, you see why I rather not think about it these days, much less talk about it, if I can help it. I know it all probably sounds like a fucking nightmare to you, but you must remember that since I really didn’t know anything else at the time, I wasn’t aware of it being anything out of the ordinary. It wasn’t until I heard my Gryffindor friends’ stories about their homes and saw the affectionate Weasleys in action that I realised something had been missing all this time. I appreciate your concern and your sudden urge to seek vengeance on my behalf — I really do — but please promise me you won’t. We wouldn’t want you to get imprisoned again once you’re finally out of there, now would we? Think of all the quidditch matches and patronus practices and dance lessons we already have lined up following your release. Not to mention, my dire need for your supposedly outstanding fan-repelling services. We won’t have time for you being locked away again anytime soon, my dragon, so go back to your cave and cool off for a while, all right? I’ve made my peace with my past and I’m ready to move on. Move on with me?
— but you’re sitting next to me on the couch, curled up in the opposite corner, chuckling at something
The grin Sirius gave him stretched from ear to ear as they walked out of the room and headed to the Visitor’s Floo. “Oh, Molly is going to
Draco closed his eyes for a second and took a deep breath, wondering for the millionth time that week how he’d managed to get himself into this mess. “Right, um,” he said, squaring his shoulders before facing his colleague and returning to his side of the desk. “We’re kind of keeping it quiet right now, but it seems Charlie Weasley and I are engaged.”
… Draco was just about to crawl over to the escritoire to retrieve his talisman when he froze in his tracks, the sound of Bellatrix’s voice reminding him of the women’s presence.
“You’re such a bloody goner,” Harry mutters to his younger self before abandoning him to his fate and continuing towards the kitchen.
Somewhere, someone is keening. There's no other word for it; the long, drawn-out sound that rips through the bedroom and speaks of unbelievable pleasure.
He smiled and rung up the order, offering the credit card machine for her to pay just as a cheerful jingling had him glance over to the entrance.
Apart from that, though, Hogwarts is actually rather good these days, much better than I ever remember it being before. (And I rather liked it back in the day, before Voldemort came and ruined it, for all of us.) Most of it is thanks to McGonagall, of course — she’s the new Headmistress, by the way, and way more impartial than Dumbledore ever was. You know, at the start of the year, she even took ten house points from me for questioning her decision to not let us ‘Eighth Year’s’ play for the quidditch house teams. She said it wouldn’t be fair to the regular students if we obstructed their chances to play. I guess I can see her point, but… Can you believe it?
They don’t go clubbing as much anymore, thank Merlin. Not that Harry wouldn’t appreciate the sight of Draco moving on a dancefloor, he would. He did. Too much. So much so that it’s still the most recurring vision of his nocturnal dreams. And his longer-than-necessary showers.
“Good morning,” Draco said from the doorway to Charlie’s room. For once, there were no other Weasleys around, and Draco was reminded of that first night when it had been just him and Charlie, and he’d ended up explaining everything to the unconscious man.
She grimaced at the thought but nodded, a twinkle of amusement in her hazel eyes. No doubt, she was also thinking back to one of their first encounters back at the beginning of term when they’d commiserated over her friend’s abysmal taste in hot beverages.
“Of course,” he managed, feeling like a fool for ever thinking Harry would be interested in anything beyond a casual acquaintance and the occasional evening of exam revisions. “I’d be happy to help. Whatever you need, I—”
When Ron had first proposed the idea of introducing Muggle coffee culture to the wizarding world — way back when Draco still struggled to call the bloke Weasley instead of The Weasel — Draco had been far from excited by the prospect of returning. If he remembered correctly, it had only been Ron and Hermione’s second visit to Beans & Serendipitea, and at the time, Draco had been convinced it was all just another inane joke out of the man’s mouth.
“I can’t?” Draco’s forehead moves under Harry’s, furrowing as Draco’s eyebrows rise towards his hairline.
Forcing the mental images aside, Draco took a deep breath and slowly turned his head to look at the man who had starred in all his wet dreams and dirty fantasies for as long as he could remember. He swallowed. Harry was standing so close Draco was able to make out every single one of his long, inky-black lashes, every speck of gold glimmering in those impossibly green eyes.
Bellatrix’s exasperated sigh was loud enough to reach all the way to where Draco stood, and Draco could almost hear the accompanying eye roll. “All right, Cissy. I guess I can always find him later. He won’t be going back to Hogwarts until Saturday, right?”
Draco refused to look at the man in question, focusing instead on Arthur and Molly, flanked on each side and behind by the rest of the siblings and spouses and children. Molly’s mouth dropped open and Arthur’s forehead crinkled, both clearly confused.
In fact — and you do best to keep this to yourself if we’re ever going to get Ron on board — but if I’m being honest, I kind of prefer your friendship to about anyone else’s right now. With you, I don’t have to pretend that everything’s fine and dandy all the time. I can be real with you, brutally honest if I wanted to, spewing my petty broodiness, and I know you wouldn’t disapprove. Not that the others would ever say anything if I did (at least out loud, or at least not to me) and I know they’d listen if I ever needed to ‘talk’, but it’s just… they’re all so happy, and I don’t want to bring them down with my shit. The war is over, the world is safe (at least for now), and everyone seems to be moving on without a hitch. Which is brilliant; they do deserve to be happy. After everything we’ve been through, they’re worthy of a life free of worries and concerns for a while. Besides, they all have so much going on; they shouldn’t have to worry about me too.
Don’t worry, my queen; I won’t steal your crown. We both know I wouldn’t make a serious contender for the title if I tried.
“Good. Well, then.” Draco forced a shrug, willing himself to sound casual. “I was about to offer my help, not that I know the first thing about kinesiology, but, well… I don’t know. Just, I mean, Janie
The Ministry is organising a War Memorial Ceremony tomorrow, some huge pretentious thing that’s supposed to raise people’s spirits and remind everyone of how happy we all should be now that all our differences are left in the past. As if they were. As if everything’s just peachy now. As if everyone’s suddenly the best of friends just because Riddle’s gone. I don’t know why they think people would be encouraged by being reminded of all the loved ones they’ve lost, of all the hatred and fear they used to feel against each other not that long ago. I wish I could opt out, that I wouldn’t have to attend, but apparently, the ‘hero of the wizarding world’ is the only person who doesn’t have a choice in the matter. Apparently, my presence on that bloody stage will somehow ensure eternal peace among witches and wizards throughout the country, if not the whole continent. Yeah, I know; it’s fucking ridiculous.
Shrugging, Draco gestured to the bag on the floor nearby. She summoned it to her and dumped it out onto the table, barely even giving Draco time to react and rescue his beloved glass art bowl from its pride of place at the centre of the dark wooden surface. The piece’s enthralling pattern of scarlet, crimson, and ruby swirling through the glass sent a thrill through his stomach even now, over a year after he procured it. Pansy snorted at his yelp, using her wand like a stick to push everything around on the tabletop. She nudged aside a set of keys, a wallet, the half-burnt clothes Charlie had been wearing, and an overcoat with several deep pockets.
Mondays brought only one class in the early afternoon for Harry, and when he gave up on sleeping again at 5:00am, he found that not having anything to do was quickly becoming maddening. He laid in bed and stared at the ceiling. Then he stared blankly at the same pages of a book and let the sentences enter his head and immediately leave it for thirty minutes. When Ron awoke, he gratefully went to breakfast with him and Hermione, and for a moment thought that maybe his restless anxiety would fade. But then Ron and Hermione went to their morning classes and all the other Gryffindors were busy and Harry found his mind racing again.
The Great Hall was as beautiful as it had ever been. The ceiling showed the clear night sky above, and only a few wispy clouds moved swiftly by, covering up the stars for brief moments before they twinkled back into view. If one were to angle their head just right, glimmering lines could be seen connecting stars in constellations. Hundreds of candles floated above, casting warm light down upon the rows and rows of students seated in black robes at their house tables. A swarm of fidgety, nervous first years stood in the middle of the room, some gazing in awe at the room around them, others fixing their eyes stubbornly forward, determined not to show their amazement so openly.
Harry hummed in agreement, thinking of the infinite wisdom and power he had learned Molly Weasley possessed. It was almost always a good idea to listen to her.
Harry felt the tension in his shoulders ease slightly. “Okay,” he said. “Okay, yeah, that sounds okay, then.”
Malfoy just continued ignoring him, walking briskly towards the door. “No matter, Potter,” he said. “I’ll find another space to study in. Like I said, I wouldn’t want to be in the way.”
he thought, and then put the whole thing out of his head as he entered the Common Room. He already had enough to worry about for the afternoon, as in 30 short minutes he was scheduled to have his first appointment with Madam Batra.
“Alright, bye then, I suppose,” Harry said quietly to the empty hall. He shut the door to the empty classroom, and after staring at the door for a few moments, continued to the next passageway he hoped to find.
He attended all his classes, and he saw Madam Batra twice a week on the same days at the same times. Hermione and Ron made sure he went to most meals, and the three of them established weekly study nights again. And yet even with all those landmarks in his week, Harry had no idea what to do with his time. Essays were finished more last minute than he had ever written them, the new spells he was learning went unpracticed, and yet Harry still could not say what he was doing with all the time he should have had to do his schoolwork. It felt as if it all just slipped away before he had a chance to do anything about it.
Madam Batra tilted her head and looked at him for a moment, considering something. “Harry,” she said, “have you ever told the whole story to someone? Everything that happened with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, from the very beginning in your first year here at Hogwarts?”
“That makes sense, yeah,” Harry agreed. It certainly explained the electric lights and the muggle photograph on the wall.
“Potter,” Malfoy said, then trailed off. Harry stopped, staring at him, half curious and half dreading what Malfoy would have to say to him. He had to look up to inspect Malfoy’s face, which was as pale as ever, but there were deep circles beneath his eyes that were darker and more pronounced than Harry had ever seen them, and his cheeks were a blotchy red, like he had a fever. Harry noticed that he even had a few freckles on his nose and cheeks, and wondered if Malfoy had used glamors to cover them before. He seemed to be thinking, his brow furrowed and mouth twisted. Harry was about to give up and walk away when Malfoy stuck his  right hand out abruptly between them. “Truce?” he asked, then made a pained expression like it had come out a little more uncertain than he wanted.
Everyone nodded. Hermione took a sip of her water. “The last time I was here was right after the battle,” she said. Lost in their own memories, they all stared down at the table, each recalling the people they had lost, and the row upon row of white sheets that had covered the dead where they had laid in this very room. Ron put his fork down on the edge of his plate.
“You’ve been out of it all night, are you all right, mate?” Ron asked, leaning around Hermione to look Harry in the eye.
“No, no no,” Harry said immediately. “I’m not staying, I was just looking to see if… Doesn’t matter, point is, I can go, I didn’t mean to interrupt, or intrude or anything.” Malfoy just kept collecting his things, capping his ink bottle with a flourish and standing up with his bag slung over his shoulder. “Really, Malfoy, I’m not staying here, you don’t need to leave. I’m really sorry for intruding,” Harry said, trying very hard to make his words sound genuine.
“Draco, you came! Come on in. We don’t fit in here anymore, so everyone’s in the front sitting room that stretches off the kitchen. Arthur and Bill added it for me a couple of years ago when everyone started getting married and we needed more space.” She kept talking as she led him into a busy kitchen, food piled on the table, counters, and sideboards, and countless Weasleys scattering in all directions. “Do you know everyone?” she asked.
“Well.” Malfoy’s perfectly formed eyebrow rises high towards his hairline. “You’re obviously not to be trusted with a mission like that on your own. Now, where do you want to go today?”
Draco smiled and raised his hand, offering his glass in a toast. Harry met him halfway, clinking their glasses together before taking a sip of the ruby liquid. The moment felt significant somehow, momentous, and Draco grasped for something to say, anything that would diffuse the sudden tension in the air between them.
Harry turned around in Draco’s arms, craving another taste of those lips, another glimpse of his gorgeous angel, when… the distinct chime of the Floo alarm sounded through the room.
His furry flatmate slid by him into the room and raced up onto the top branch of the floor-to-ceiling cat tree Draco had adapted for him, peering down at Draco imperiously.
“Mm-hmm. Right. Yes, that’s exactly what we intend; a wand for every student.” She looked at the clock on the wall then turned her chair so Draco could see her. Her short, shiny black hair was tucked behind her ear, accentuating the large hoop earrings and her perfect cheekbones. She smiled at Draco and nodded as she finished her call. “Wonderful. I’ll put you down for four seats at the Wands for Wixen Ball on the eleventh. Thank you, Minister.”
“Y-yes, Master Draco,” Minette said, shifting her weight from foot to foot. “Snatchers is delivering captives, sir. Says one of them may be, um, H-Harry P-Potter.”
Malfoy motions for the street, prompting Harry to step over the threshold and close the door behind him. A not-at-all-unpleasant shiver travels up his spine as Malfoy places a light hand on the small of his back, guiding him down the front steps.
“Hey, Draco!” George Weasley’s playful voice came from the doorway as Draco was working his way through the payroll in Ernie’s office.
them. Just put it on a toothbrush (you probably have one of those in that kit too, a plastic stick with bristles on one end?) and rub it against your teeth — all reachable sides — for at least two minutes, twice a day. It may sound tricky and tedious compared to a Mouth Freshening Charm, but I urge you to try it. Please. If you haven’t been able to clean your teeth all this time, I can’t even imagine how foul your breath must be by now. Your mouth must taste like… Oh, just do it, already. You were able to make fire, for Circe’s sake. You can do this too.
He dropped his head in his hands, uncaring of the way he was crumpling the invitation still in his grasp.
And he did. Draco undressed him with the utmost care, covering every bared inch of skin with gentle caresses and soft kisses. He took his time to explore every dip and curve of him, all the while showering him with praise that made Harry blush like a shy teenager. Draco rolled him over and brushed his fingertips over Harry’s shoulders, his back, his hips, his thighs, his calves. His barely-there touches were maddening, just enough to set Harry’s entire body tingling and yet not nearly enough to satiate him. By the time Draco’s hands finally reached Harry’s arse, Harry was keening with pent-up desire, eagerly pushing up against Draco’s palms, practically mewling when Draco took pity on him and dug his fingers into Harry’s flesh.
Ginny looked on, her voice quiet. “Is he going to be okay?” Her picture was regularly featured in the Quidditch section, usually showing her latest dramatic play, but sometimes accompanying the latest gossip about her many paramours. She looked older, more self-confident than during her Hogwarts’ days, but Draco could easily recognise her from school.
“I can’t tell you that, I’m sorry.” And he did look it too. “But I want you to know you’ll live through it. We both will.”
“He said it wasn’t that painful,” Ernie continued, seemingly misconstruing Draco’s reaction. Thank goodness. “Can’t say I’d like to have a bar through my knob, but evidently, blokes and birds both love it, so I guess he thinks it’s worth it.” Ernie used his wand to send a copy of next week’s dragon-keeper schedule to the wall where it stuck in place. “According to Charlie, anyway. It’s been quite the crowd-pleaser, to hear him tell it.”
Godric, what’s with me today? I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to bore you with my depressing rambling, I know it must be hard to believe, but I do intend for these letters to lighten your mood, not the opposite. And just for the record, I usually don’t have any problem keeping these pathetic thoughts to myself, but writing to you… it’s like you bring it out of me. So if you think I sound like a miserable mess, you only have yourself to blame.
Draco cleared his throat. “Yes, well, we’ll see. I can’t imagine Charlie being happy away from his dragons.”
Draco laughed, letting out a little snort that he hoped Harry didn’t notice. “Isn’t she? Slyvia’s my upstairs neighbour. She’s just a little over the top sometimes.”
Harry frowned. “The one you could never tell me anything about, just like everything else concerning your job?” Draco shrugged apologetically. Not being able to talk about his work with his spouse was about the only downside to being an Unspeakable. “Yeah, I remember you mentioning it once or twice.”
He practically shoved the nondescript pastry box he’d been carrying into Harry’s arms, all words and manners seemingly forgotten in the presence of this man and his stunning emerald eyes, currently widened in surprise.
“Slyvia, I seriously have to—” He paused, embarrassed. “Oh, Harry. I thought you were someone else.”
“Well, I guess that’s something, at least; one point for Gryffindor. Now, where were we? Yes, don’t speak with food in your mouth,” Malfoy continues with a pointed look that makes Harry’s cheeks grow hot, “open the door for your date and pull out their chair, replenish their drinks and walk them home at the end of the evening. Are you with me so far?”
“I bet they’ll miss you tremendously,” the man said, green eyes sparkling behind sleek, gold-rimmed glasses. “They just won’t let it show. They don't want you thinking about them when you should be focusing on all the good stuff that’s waiting for you at Hogwarts.”
With a huff of exasperation, Harry eventually banged on the Enter key and then sat back, scrubbing his hands over his face. “Okay. Sorry about that. One of our suppliers is dicking us around, demanding more money before they send us the shipment we’ve already paid for.” He stood up, closed the laptop with a flourish, then smiled and gestured to the storeroom.
Harry takes a deep breath through his nose, reining in his racing heart. His walls have required more maintenance lately, what with his restless yearning constantly tearing at them from the inside, constantly trying to climb them in a desperate need to escape the claustrophobic confines of his heart and reach out to Draco with all its might. “No, I—”
“You know, I think you’re actually pretty wonderful,” Draco blurted before he could stop himself. He felt heat rising on his cheeks, but it was okay. Charlie wasn’t awake to see it anyway. Draco’s heart hammered in his chest, but Charlie’s beeping stayed steady, grounding him. “Do you believe in love at first sight?” he asked softly. “Have you ever fallen in love with someone you’ve never even talked to?”
I don’t know why I keep forgetting that you’re all isolated and unknowing over there. Last year was different when you were all locked up in Azkaban and no one ever saw or heard from you. If I hadn’t been at Hogwarts, constantly being reminded of you by random glimpses of memories brought on by the sights of certain locations or people, I might’ve even forgotten you still existed. Now though, ever since we started this letter exchange thing, you suddenly feel so real again, as if you never left, as if you’re just a few floors down in the dungeons with your mates as usual. The feeling that you, at any time, could turn a corner into the corridor I’m walking through makes me forget that you’re not here, but there, and that I’m your only connection to the outside world. It’s fucking weird.
Molly and Arthur stood huddled together in the opposite corner, looking at Charlie like they couldn’t believe such a horrible thing would happen and yet like it all made the greatest sense in the world. Over by the window, Ginny and George kept snickering, undoubtedly going over what kind of pranks they could play on Charlie given his current state. Ron and Bill barely paused in their game of Exploding Snap,  seemingly unconcerned while Percy appeared to keep his emotions in check by studiously scowling at everyone involved.
“But…” Harry watches as Malfoy walks over to the ball return to pick up his neon green projectile. “But you’re a great catch? How can he not…? Do I know him?”
Harry muttered something intelligible, and although it was hard to tell in the darkness, he seemed to be blushing.
“Well, the likelihood of me being drawn into a Veela bond is pretty slim,” Harry finally said with a laugh. “I just wish I knew how to recognise the person for me when I meet them?”
On the kitchen table, Harry’s Quidditch Monthly lies half-covered by Draco’s Potions Review and their latest tenancy bill. Along the wall above the counter, their favourite mugs hang side by side on their designated hooks, Draco’s rainbow-striped ‘Earl Gay’ design somehow complementing Harry’s white on black ‘Smells Like Tea Spirit’ perfectly. Fixed to the front of the fridge is Teddy’s latest work of art, a colourful mishmash of shapeless scribbles bestowed upon them both as a joint gift during their latest visit to Andromeda’s.
Merlin, that voice. Draco had got a taste of it the other day when they spoke on the phone, but hearing it now, mumbling close enough for Draco to sense the warm breath ghosting over his skin… Holy fuck, Draco’s knees nearly buckled from the wave of arousal crashing over him.
When Draco sneaked a peek towards the corner table in the back, the bloke was glancing down at his phone, an amused smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. Feigning nonchalance, Draco left him to it and lay down his phone on the counter to do what he’d been wanting to do for hours now. He reached back to tug the elastic out of his hair, shaking out the long blond tresses before gathering them into a new, improved bun at the nape of his neck.
Harry bobs his head faster, grasps firmer with his hands, and the ache in his jaw, the feel of saliva running down his chin, it's all worth it. It makes him even harder, knowing that he's doing this, that he's unravelling this beautiful man who so rarely lets himself be seen by others. He lets Harry see him, though — all of him — and Harry feels his own release coming closer at the thought.
They all turned in rather quickly after doing some initial unpacking. There would be no classes the next day while the first years were given tours and introductions, and so there would be plenty of time to unpack later, and they were all tired from the long day of travelling. When Harry had said goodnight and pulled the curtains around his bed closed and fell to his pillow, he felt exhausted, but sleep did not come easily. The snoring surrounding him on all sides was nothing he wasn’t used to and was not to blame for his wakefulness. Each time sleep tugged at his mind alarms went off in Harry’s brain, and he awoke with a sick lurch, the memories of the prying fingers of Legilimency fresh in his mind now that he was back inside Hogwarts. He was accustomed now to his insomnia, but the paranoia about Legilimency was not a common subject for his nightmares. There was something about the familiar old four poster beds that was bringing his mind back to those times when the dreams first started, before he really understood them and they were steeped in as much confusion as they were fear. Harry felt nauseated and restless with fear.
Madam Batra pulled a sheet of paper out of her stack with an “Aha!” and clipped it studiously to her clipboard. “I hope you don’t mind getting right into business. I’ll need to start with a bit of medical history, would you like to fill out the paperwork yourself, or would you like to run through the questions together? It shouldn’t take long.”
Most of the Gryffindors who had survived the battle and the Snatchers had returned, and Harry was clustered at the back of the Gryffindor table with Hermione, Ron, Seamus, Dean, Neville, Ginny, and Pavarti. They each ate sparingly and then sat pushing their food round on their plates, except Ron, who was serving himself second helpings. Few words were exchanged, and though the Hall was filled with pleasant chatter, the silence surrounding their group felt oppressive.
When they were done, she thanked him and tucked away her paperwork, settling her elbows on her knees and leaning towards him. “Now, it is my understanding that you were asked to schedule an appointment, and that you haven't necessarily chosen to be here. So before we begin delving into anything, I’d like to talk about what you want from this experience. Do you have any goals you would like to meet, or anything specific you’d like to talk about? And is there anything that you are concerned about for these sessions?”
“No, I’m not a… If anything, I was stupid. I had no idea what I was doing and could have easily gotten us both killed if I’d made her even angrier.”
Whatever Draco and Teddy had been talking about was cut short when Harry entered the room, Draco drifting off mid-sentence as their eyes met over Teddy’s flaming blue hair. Both man and boy sat up as their cups floated over towards them and Harry took a seat next to Teddy on the sofa.
Harry briefly considers crawling into the fridge to cool himself down, only releasing the breath he hadn’t been aware of holding once the click of Draco’s bedroom door closing resonates through the flat.
.” It sounded as though he had to force the name past his lips. “It must be hard to spend the holiday with your fiancé in the hospital.”
“It’s tradition.” Arthur’s voice this time, Draco knew, but he couldn’t move his eyes from Harry’s, waiting to see what the other man would do. He was terrified Harry would do something and, simultaneously, dreading that he might not.
Sorry for the mood. (I blame the house.) It isn’t really all bad. The practical blocks are all right, if tiring, even the more mundane weight and cardio sessions down in the gym. It’s a good tiring, though, you know, the one that gives you a good night’s sleep at the end of the day. But even so — and please don’t let this go to your head, you smug twat — the best part of my week was all courtesy of you.
“Right,” Ernie said, amusement dripping from the drawn-out word. “Last time, he came back with his cock pierced and was showing it off to the lads down in the hatchery.” Ernie grinned. “Got a glimpse myself, actually. Very nice. And the piercing wasn’t bad, either.”
“Can’t believe you’re here,” Harry said at one time, pushing Draco up against the wall, wanting to melt into the man he’d been yearning for for so long.
No, Ron and I are definitely not joined at the hip. (If his hips are joined with anyone else’s nowadays, it’s Hermione’s, and I really don’t want to imagine myself as any part of that equation, thank you very much.) We’ve had our fallouts before, and we’ll undoubtedly have them again, but he’s a good friend and I can’t deny his change of mind threw me for a loop.
And Draco moved. Slowly at first; long, deep thrusts that felt like a manifestation of sorts, as if Draco was trying to pound the reality of it all into Harry’s very core with every grind of his hips.
Ravenclaw’s new seeker should be aiming for the league, though. Damn, but she’s good. She’s only a Fourth Year and she still has a lot to learn, of course, but Maxwell didn’t have a snowball’s chance in hell against her last week. So, no, Hufflepuff didn’t bring home the cup in the end; the Claw’s did.
Harry swallows and pushes the tantalising images aside, ignoring the enthusiastic twitch in his pants.
“But he’s so fun to tease,” Bellatrix all but sing-songed. Tease, in this case, Draco knew, meant torture. With Crucios. For fun. Because, yes, that’s how fucked up that woman was. “And besides, you must agree he could use some serious character-building. He’s seventeen, for darkness’ sake, and still relying on his mother’s protection. That coward is going to need all the backbone he can grow.”
Draco’s eyes flash and he leans down, looking as though he’s going to drop his lips to the same spot. Harry holds his breath, not daring to move.
at first sight. I mean, look at them. Charlie loves a good shag, and Draco’s pretty enough to catch his eye.”
I can’t hear what you’re all talking about, your voices drowned out by the too-loud music, but if Ginny’s delighted grin is anything to go by, it’s old anecdotes from school, saucy gossip from the Slytherin dorms that I can only hope she’ll want to tell me all about later. She looks between the rest of you in rapt attention, soaking up every word you’re saying, hungry to learn as much as possible about her boyfriend’s childhood escapades.
Slyvia’s voice dropped, lower now, and Draco heard her natural timbre come out. “I always think of you, Draco. Let me know if you change your mind.” She ran a finger along his arm as she walked away, and Draco swallowed.
“Sure,” Draco says as he appears in the doorway to the living room, glancing over at the telly while Harry takes in the sight of him over the back of the couch. The sparkling eyes, the soft, white-blond hair, the striking features, the perfect body hidden under impeccable clothing — even now, Harry can’t get enough of the sight. “What are you watching?”
. The reminder of Draco in there… all wet and naked and… and in the very same shower where Harry’s been fantasising about…
“And what about you?” The official asked Charlie with more than a hint of exasperation to his voice. “Do you object as well?”
“Harry,” she called out to where Harry was walking down the hallway in front of them with Sirius at his side. The men stopped and turned to face them. “Can you make sure Draco here gets home okay? It must be quite a shock for him, after everything, to have Charlie not remember him.”
Draco took the parchment, a smear of something that he sincerely hoped was mud and nothing more sinister swiped across it. He glanced at the heading and closed his eyes, doing everything he could to rein in his temper. They couldn’t afford to lose Ernie. There was no one else willing to work his crazy hours to keep this place functional. “In the bin? The invoice was in the bin?” He took a deep breath. Ernie
One thing in particular that’s been niggling me lately is that the man who suggested an auror career for me in the first place, the one who made me want to hunt down dark wizards for a living, wasn’t even the renowned auror he posed as, but a wicked thought-to-be-dead death eater and Azkaban escapee. I’m sure you remember him fondly, considering the unforgettable transfiguration he once let you experience. Yeah, they never made it public, and I’m not sure your parents ever told you either, but the man who once turned you into a cute but skittish little ferret wasn’t Professor Moody but Barty Crouch Jr, one of Riddle’s men who went polyjuiced as Moody for the entire duration of the school year. The more I think about him being the one who first planted the auror idea in my head, the more the idea just doesn’t sit right with me.
to touch them, but something tells him doing so would be too intimate a gesture. His hand is already reaching out when he stops himself, just inches from Draco’s shoulder, and clears his throat, meeting Draco’s eyes.
As soon as the boy was out of sight, Harry went for the closest chair, unsure of how much longer his knees would be able to support him. He wasn’t ready for this. Nowhere near ready. He was only halfway through his two-week Draco detox, and after spending the entire day surrounded by happy couples, his heart felt even more fragile than it usually did.
Hannah, the traitor, was fully in the room now, deftly pushing aside the family members so she could get to Charlie and change the bandage on his arm. “And I don’t know if they told you, but Draco saved his life.”
“Nice.” Wood pulled the word out, sounding impressed. “Guess our little arrangement is over then, huh?”
Has anyone ever told you you’re good with words? Because you are. Really good. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve read your latest letter by now, but your emotional description of Narcissa still makes my chest tighten every time, an actual physical reaction, as if your words somehow had direct access to my body. All from a few strokes of ink on parchment. Have you ever considered becoming an author? I bet your biography would be much more read-worthy than all the drivel they’ve put in mine. You’d think an author would want to do their research properly, or at least contact me with some questions before they publish 800 pages of lies and gossip, but no. ‘The Boy Who Lived: The True Tale of Harry Potter’ is nothing but a made-up fairy tale, bringing the masses even more fodder for their delusional hero worship.
“Black as midnight and sweet as treacle tart?” Draco crooked an eyebrow at the girl, who gave him a pleased smile in return.
An image flashes through Harry’s mind, of soft, pale skin shivering under his hands and lips, and he swallows as he tries to ignore the twitch of interest in his pants.
The panic in his voice caused several people to turn to look at him, but Harry only had eyes for the five-year-old boy in the red-and-green-knitted hat and scarf currently running away from him. This was one of the reasons he avoided the crowds whenever possible; the not-so-exaggerated fear that something would happen to any of his loved ones on his watch. It was enough to have to experience it in his nightmares.
Draco swallowed and glanced up at him. “Because no one else knows, and I’ve been waiting for the right moment to tell you.”
“You—” He took a deep breath and tried again, something twisting strangely in his stomach. “You made this? But… How?”
His green eyes positively twinkled with laughter, and Draco forced a chuckle as he felt his cheeks flush hot.
“Maybe to some extent, but no, not really. He’ll have Rose there with him, which I think will make a huge difference. Sure, I had Theo, but we weren’t even remotely as close as they are. Sirius and Rose will always have each others’ backs, even if they don’t end up in the same house.”
Arriving on Charlie’s floor, Draco slowed his steps, reluctant to approach the room. Hannah found him at the end of the hallway.
PPS Am I a horrible person for wanting to strangle my best friend? Not too severely, of course, and not all the time. Just, there’s still an entire month to go before the N.E.W.T. exams are over and Hermione is already driving me crazy.
“Are you sleeping in here, or are you coming to my room?” Draco asked the animal. “I’ve had a long night and don’t have the energy to argue.”
He stepped farther away, anxious to put some space between them. That had felt too right, too good, and Draco was not ready to deal with any of it. “Wow, look at the time. We really should get going.”
He can’t remember who took the photo, but he’ll never forget the night it was taken. Theo’s pre-Christmas party, seven months ago.
"We'll deal with it. Together." Harry runs a hand through Draco's hair, watching his silver-grey eyes flutter closed. "It'll be okay, no matter your test scores. And one night off from revision won't make a difference in what you know, but it might make a difference in how you manage the stress."
It was like a physical representation of everything that made his life so pathetic. There was nobody except his fox to give a flying Hippogriff shit that he wasn’t there with them to celebrate the holiday. There wasn’t even a true reason for him to be at the Reserve. Not really. To man the offices? What was the point? Most of the keepers already lived on the grounds, all perfectly capable of taking care of the high-maintenance beasts without his assistance. And it wasn’t like anyone would be visiting or requiring access from outside on a day like this.
That’s all it takes. A brief second, a flutter of lashes; the wrecking ball to make Harry’s carefully erected walls come crashing down at his feet, obliterating his resistance in the flash of an eye — or rather, two eyes. Two beautiful, silver-grey eyes currently burning into his, darkening with emotions Harry has never dared hope for Draco to ever direct his way.
Harry returns to their table, taking a long swig of his beer while checking the scoreboard. “So,” he ventures over the characteristic clack-and-clattering coming from one of the lanes further down to their left, “if you’re such an expert dater, how come you’ve never found anyone you’ve liked enough to want to get serious with?”
Draco paused and cast an Impervious Charm over them both, his breath misting around his face in the frigid air.
“Huh?” Harry hummed another line of the song. “That one? I don’t know the words. It’s something Sirius is always humming. He says it’s a tune from his childhood that always gets stuck in his head. Apparently, one of his cousins used to play it a lot.”
my type, Harry? Tell me. Because Charlie is kind and generous, and he loves his family and friends, and he makes me smile. And you know what’s more? He doesn’t go around ruining the first good night out I’ve had in Merlin-knows-how-long by making asinine announcements to my friends that he knows nothing about.”
be perfect. There are only two days to go, and something always goes wrong at the last minute. I simply won’t let that happen this time.”
Draco twitched, only to be reminded of the warm, firm body under him, the press of chest against chest, stomach against stomach, hips against—
Being the benevolent man that he is, there’s nothing left for Harry to do but to bring it out of its misery. So, he grabs Draco’s hips and pulls him closer, feeling a rush of heat shoot through him as their cocks align once more. Draco gasps and Harry is quick to capture that lower lip between his teeth, nibbling on it long enough for Draco to open up and allow him inside. The kiss is fierce; hot, wet, and all-consuming. When Draco tangles his strong hands into Harry’s locks and eventually pulls them apart, they’re both flushed and panting. Draco’s voice is rough when he speaks.
The kettle switches off and Harry pushes his thoughts away as he busies himself with pouring the ninety-three-degrees water into the mugs, making sure to start the timer basically at the same moment the water makes contact with the leaves in Draco’s rainbow mug.
So why did he feel like shit? Why was his stomach turning, his head aching, and his chest tightening at even the notion of tying himself to the man whom he’d been obsessing over for an entire year?
“You named my cat Mushu?” Wood asked, sounding amused. “Well, it’s no Colonel Wellington, but I suppose for a nickname, it’s sufficient. Thanks for making sure he didn’t die, Malfoy.” He glanced at Charlie, then added, “And I suppose that goes for Charlie, too, not just Colonel Wellington.”
Harry’s smile faltered with every retreating footfall. They wouldn’t have any chance to talk tomorrow, not as long as Draco was on the clock. And then he’d be gone, whisked away by international Portkey to celebrate the holidays with his mother and Andromeda in France.
“Oh, Draco…” Harry’s voice sounded strained, and when Draco looked up to meet his gaze, he nearly drowned in the wild swirl of emotions visible in Harry’s deep green eyes. “You make it sound as if it wasn’t a big deal; do you even realise how fucking brave you are?”
Draco jerked his head around, finding Harry staring at a small box he’d just pulled out from his pocket. As Draco watched him, Harry withdrew his wand and enlarged the box before extending it to Draco, his eyes never leaving the gift in his hand.
“Thanks, Draco. Don’t know what I’d do without you.” He went back to the schedule he’d been working on. “Was that Weasley coming through the Floo?”
There’s a pleasant buzz ringing in Harry’s ears as they walk down the street, close enough for Draco’s wool-clad arm to occasionally brush against his. The pavement is coated with a light dust of snow that glistens in the soft light of the streetlamps, and the chilly air is nipping at their cheeks, keeping them awake despite the late hour.
“I’m telling you this because I can see how much you care about Charlie, and through him, his family.”
“Yes, Ernie, I’m pregnant. You found me out. First accidental male pregnancy ever. Whatever shall I do?”
Draco’s gaze darted over to the table in the back corner just in time to see emerald eyes widen before returning to the array of charts and textbooks splayed all over the tabletop. The girl — Janie — rolled her eyes at her friend’s absent-mindedness and said something to him before glancing up at Draco with a knowing smirk on her face.
When morning arrived, sensibility thankfully returned, and with it, a resolute decision to forget the entire ordeal, to act as if yesterday never happened. So far, this new strategy had worked, well…not flawlessly, by any means, but well enough. At least if you didn’t count the times Draco caught himself palming his pocket to make sure The Note was still there and not a figment of his imagination. Which he didn’t. Count, that is.
And fuck, but Draco wanted to believe him, wanted to trust him, but… How the hell was he supposed to do that when every fact, every rational reasoning pointed to the contrary? No, he knew Potter was wrong, knew Potter had lied to him, again. And yet, Draco had let Potter lead him on, had let himself believe — if only for a moment — that what he said could be true. That it would, in fact, be okay. Eventually.
Arthur Weasley put his arm around her and leaned over his son, whispering something in his wife’s ear. They were followed by their children —
“Now, who’s wearing too many clothes,” Harry pouted, already gripping the waistband of Draco’s briefs and pushing them down to mid-thigh.
“Are you suggesting that my Charlie is some sort of trollop who sleeps around?” Molly asked, looking scandalised.
Draco frowned. Not much of what she just said made any sense, and he decided to focus on the one part that didn’t feel like the key to Pandora’s box.
So Draco does. It's only the work of a few moments to banish their shirts to a windowsill in the corner, the cold air hitting Harry's chest turning his nipples into hard pebbles in no time. Draco kicks off his shoes — he prefers to fly barefoot, Harry's learned — then gathers Harry close and pulls them both to the open ledge. Harry wraps his legs around Draco's waist and notices Draco's wings unfurl, feels the feathers brushing his neck, but he can't look away from the serious grey eyes just inches from his own.
“Fuck me, Draco…” Harry pleaded, looking over his shoulder in search of Draco’s face. He had lost his glasses somewhere along the line, but Draco’s features were still clear as day before him, so close was he as their eyes met. “Want to… your cock… Please,” he added, just before Draco growled and captured his mouth in a feral kiss.
. Well, that’s helpful. “He would’ve died with nobody to take care of him. And I don’t know why I’m making excuses to you. You were the one all, ‘Oh, Draco, we can’t just leave him here,’ and, ‘You’ve always said you needed a roommate.’”
Draco felt heat blooming on his cheeks. Merlin, when did he grow so unaccustomed to taking a simple compliment? He typed and erased several replies before he was interrupted by a party of new patrons barging through the front door, forcing him to leave the text unanswered as he became busy with preparing drinks and grilled sandwiches for the famished study group.
In his excitement, when any other five-year-old wouldn’t have had eyes or ears for anything but their upcoming meeting with Santa Claus, this little boy — his darling Teddy — had the awareness to not only bother about Harry but to actually worry about his well-being. Because Teddy knew about Harry’s unease in crowded public places. He might not know the reason for it, no child should ever have to worry about potential terrorists lurking at every corner, but Teddy
“Well,” Harry smirks, squeezing Draco’s hand, “seeing as how I’m your mate, dating sounds like a good first step to me.”
Merlin. If only Hold on Ah yeah, nothing beats a morning cuppa. (Is’nt house-elves the best?) Okay, M, I’m here for you now. Let’s do this.
Harry didn’t want to hang around downstairs alone on Christmas evening. He didn’t want to be reminded of his loneliness tonight of all nights; this evening, meant to be spent with the ones you loved most..
“Listen,” Harry continued as Draco accepted his glass from Harry’s outstretched hand. “We’re all shaped by our pasts, but that’s no reason to let it prevent us from shaping our future the way we want it.”
They only get delayed twice on their way to the shower. Once as Harry nearly trips and falls when his foot gets stuck trying to kick off his joggers without slowing down or breaking their kiss. Once as Draco gives in to the sudden urge to pin Harry to the wall and kiss the living daylights out of him.
Draco chose not to dwell on that part as he followed Harry into a room that was all brick walls and cement ceiling and floor. It was large, with metal shelves lining the walls and standing in two long rows down the middle. One side of the room was filled with boxes of supplies, things Draco had noticed in the shop on his way back here. Walking past the boxes of Blazing Blissbombs and Splendid Sprinkle Sparklers, he zeroed in on the contents of the shelves on the other side of the aisle.
Draco simply refused to acknowledge how many times he’d read those five words so far. He’d lost count long before he even left work the previous day, returning to the girl’s neat lettering time and again as if he expected it to suddenly stop taunting him and start making sense. By the time he’d returned home, he’d been all but certain it was a riddle of some sort, a baffling puzzle he was meant to solve but couldn’t. Two hours later, telly going unwatched before his eyes, takeaway forgotten on the coffee table, he’d reminded himself to check the coffeeshop for hidden cameras first thing in the morning, all but convinced The Note must be part of some practical joke — whether on his expense or as some internal prank between the two friends being the only thing yet to be determined.
PS How can you say the Slytherin dungeon isn’t creepy? I mean, it would be creepy enough with just the eerie lighting from those greenish ceiling pendants, but the underwater windows facing the murky lake and its swimming grindylows… weren’t you ever afraid someone’s spell going awry would accidentally break one of those windows and drown you all? I don’t know if I’d ever be able to sleep in a place like that.
Draco took a sip of his tea and tried not to spit it out. It was truly disgusting. Setting the cup back down, he straightened his shoulders. “I need to tell them. And besides, Harry doesn’t find this the least bit amusing.”
Of course people would be interested in reading about your life. If nothing else, then as a cautionary tale, hehe. No, but seriously. Offering up your story to the public might even gain you some understanding from those out there who still are thick enough to believe a young child can be solely responsible for its own values and beliefs. No, you weren’t a nice kid, Malfoy, far from it — at least not to me and my friends — but looking back, even I can realise those ideas of supremacy and bigotry you used to live by were not ones you conjured up by yourself but parts of the narrow-minded worldview you inherited from your parents growing up. I can’t speak for everyone, of course, but at least I, for one, would be most intrigued by the possibility to read — yes, I read, you insufferable git — about your view of it all, of your experience of the war and your part in it, provided the story is yours and not written by some scandal-seeking journalist like mine. (Yeah, you’re probably right. I wouldn’t have wanted to talk to them. And maybe I’m naive, but I still think I should have a say in what’s published about me, especially if it’s promoted as the ‘true tale’.)
A contemplative silence settled between them, and when Harry finally spoke, his voice was soft and rough.
They were both breathless and blushing when they eventually broke apart, their eyes locked on each other as Harry dropped the magic shield, letting the cheers of the room overtake them. Harry took Draco’s hand, linking their fingers tightly before turning to approach the rest of the room.
PS Teddy is a perfectly valid name, you poncy git. He’s named Edward Remus Lupin, after his father and grandfather, and it suits him just fine.
“All right, first things first,” Malfoy declares after tasting his lentil soup with a pleased hum. “
“It was a hard time for many of us. I lost someone too, you know. Remus. I think you knew him as Professor Lupin, but he was my Moony. He wasn’t allowed to get married because of the whole werewolf thing, and of course, I was still a fugitive at the time, but we were going to find a way after the war was over. We’d wasted too much time being idiots and not enough time just being
“Feel this?” Harry lowered his hips to grind his hard cock along the crease of Draco’s arse, eliciting a throaty moan straight from Draco’s core. “Fuck, Draco, you’re driving me crazy. I want—”
Harry reached out and held Draco’s arm to stop him. “But a relationship is about you, too, not just what Charlie wants. If you want to go, you deserve to go.”
Harry didn’t know what he wanted more; to find out what they were saying about him or remain blissfully ignorant. He decided on the latter as he witnessed Teddy saying something that had Draco choke on his breath. Whatever had come out of the boy’s mouth, it certainly didn’t bode well for Harry, at least not if Draco’s sideway glances were anything to go by. Harry did his best not to squirm under Draco’s inquisitive gaze and stubbornly refused to acknowledge the intriguing blush that spread over Draco’s high cheekbones as he tried to recover from his sudden coughing fit. He looked absolutely adora—
Hermione would probably say he’s becoming obsessed again. She does say it, actually, so often that Harry can’t even bring up Malfoy in passing anymore. His friends don’t want to hear it.
Adrenaline flooded Harry’s veins like a tsunami, dread rooting him to the spot for what felt like ages before he finally got the gears of his brain working again.
Draco laughed and raised his glass to take a drink when an arm reached around him and grabbed his wrist.
And just like that, Draco’s gone, continuing down the hall towards the bathroom. Harry’s gaze lingers on the now empty doorway, not shaking himself into action until the sound of the bathroom door closing reaches him. “Tea,” he mutters, then turns off the telly and rises to his feet.
“I’d never,” Draco assured him with a satisfied grin. He might have just turned this guy down, but the blatant appreciation was still an encouraging ego boost. “So what was that? Double tall extra hot…?”
Harry lifted the edge of the duvet, helping Draco get settled and tucking him in the way Mother hadn’t done since he was five. It was nice, having someone care for him this way. Harry stroked his hand over Draco’s head, brushing a stray lock of hair out of his face. Draco felt soft lips placing a gentle kiss on his forehead, and he relaxed, sinking into the safety that was Harry’s nearness. When Harry spoke again, Draco was already half asleep.
our letters, but the truth is, for some reason, I still haven’t. I probably should, shouldn’t I? No, don’t answer that. We’ve already been over this once and I already know the answer. It’s just, with the entirety of wizarding Britain considering me and every aspect of my life fair game, I kind of like having one tiny part of my life that no one else knows about. Not that I wouldn’t trust
Someone I believe you should’ve been able to know but haven’t been allowed to meet yet (as far as I know) is your aunt Andromeda Tonks. I know your relatives disowned her before you were born, and I guess that if you ever heard of her at all, it mustn’t have been anything good. But she’s a wonderful woman and everyone here loves her. I haven’t experienced her teaching myself since I don’t take Muggle Studies, but Ron and Nev and the others say she’s brilliant. I love having her in the castle, though, especially since it means I get to see my godson Teddy almost every day.
They walked on in silence until they reached the shed again and unloaded their burdens. Locking the door behind them, Harry stood next to Draco as he looked up at the multitude of stars. Seeing them this clearly reminded Draco of Hogwarts, the sky devoid of hardly any atmospheric light and allowing a view of the sky, unlike anything he usually got near London.
Draco chuckles. With his wings safely tucked away, he easily drapes an arm around Harry's shoulder as they continue walking. "We need to get him a mate."
“A year ago,” Draco said quickly. Not a total lie, since that was when he’d started helping more often at the Reserve.
— has worked on some artwork to help me bring this fic to life even further. Make sure to check out their amazing art additions to chapters
“Yes. Pansy started it after school.” Draco looked away at that, not wanting to disrupt their evening with talks of the past.
“Too. Many. Clothes,” Draco growled by way of explanation, emphasising every word with an open-mouthed kiss along Harry’s gloriously stubbly jaw.
Actually, if I remember correctly, the resemblance between the two of you was one of the first things that crossed my mind during our first meeting at Madam Malkin’s. Do you remember, Draco? You talked about your parents almost as if they were your servants, always at the ready to be coaxed into doing and giving you anything you wanted. I think I already decided right then and there that I didn’t like you, after only a few minutes of conversation, and once you mentioned that you expected to be sorted into Slytherin, I instinctively knew I wanted to end up anywhere but.
“Hmm?” He looked up from his Transfiguration homework. He’d been struggling with this assignment for nearly a week and he still hadn’t found an answer to why it wasn’t working. Maybe he was putting too much power behind the spell? The book said this was a delicate conjuring, and delicacy had never really been his strong suit. But if he tried to cut his power by half, then maybe—
Draco glared. “How should I know? I’m not really his fiancé, remember? It’s not like I can just go through his stuff.”
— and adjusted his messenger bag on his shoulder as he moved to leave. Only now did Draco notice he was wearing his coat and a long knitted scarf wrapped loosely around his neck, ready to head out in the chilly autumn air. Draco was just instructing himself to take up breathing again as Harry turned around, hand on the front door handle, and added, “I hope you eat meat.”
Slyvia’s blue eyes were glassy as she beamed at him, then she tossed her long blonde waves over her shoulder and spun, the façade fully back into place. “I’m always happy, darling. Now, you know where to find me if you need…entertainment!”
Draco blinked, bright flames still dancing on the inside of his eyelids. The freezing rain was back in his face, sharp as shards of glass against his skin, feeling like a blessing from the grey skies above. He let out a deep breath, willing his shoulders to relax with the exhale, and looked down at the man in his arms.
“Wanna know a secret?” Your murmured words, so close to my ear I can feel your hot breath ghosting over my skin, send a shiver down my spine.
“There,” Draco says, giving Harry’s shoulder a friendly pat. “No need for me to stick around anymore; you’ve got this, Potter.”
Harry swallowed hard and knew he was ready to take that final step. He'd gone down on Draco, he'd been inside Draco, but they'd never done this. Not until now.
“Interesting choice of colour scheme, Potter,” he said amused, glancing over to where Harry was standing near the door. “Here I thought you’d be the one to go for a classic red and gold, but I guess I should have known better. This rainbow explosion you have going on here is really someth—”
“Fuck, Hannah, I was delirious.” He looked around, making sure nobody was watching them, even if they couldn’t hear. “I’ve had a crush on him for ages, all right, but we’ve barely even spoken!”
And every time we’re here, you ask me to dance. And every time you do, I decline, laughing it off as a ridiculous idea even though I can’t think of anything I’d rather do if I could. To be the one with my arms wrapped around your neck, or the one pressed against your back, moving my hips with yours. To be the one to pin you to the wall, snogging you senseless, or the one to drop to my knees before you and—
I said it with a laugh, but he merely smirked and drawled, ‘Did he now?’ with that one-sided brow-raise he does that always makes him look just like you. (Is that some extra-curricular class they teach in the Slytherin common room after hours, by the way? Individual brow-raising, sneers, and infuriating smirks? I bet it is.) Anyway, then he offered. And I know kissing shouldn’t be like that, like a favour between two friends. I know there should be feelings involved for it to really make sense. But I did it anyway. I let him kiss me. And I didn’t die. It was different, yeah, but not at all horrible. In fact, if I’m to be honest — which we’ve agreed to be here, right? — I rather liked it. Although the mechanics are all the same, somehow it’s nothing like kissing a girl. At least not to my experience. The masculine scent, the rough stubble, the low, growling sounds he made…
Draco considered. Perhaps Charlie had figured it out, in which case, letting Charlie broach the subject first and allowing him to steer the conversation would only be fair, right? If it so happened it’d also save Draco the trouble of having to find the right words, well…  “All right. You go first.”
Draco closed his eyes as the giddiness started to bubble up in his throat. He was practically trembling from the effort of trying to hold it in. “Okay,” he managed, the laughter audible in his voice.
Teddy hesitated, seemingly unsure how to proceed, so Harry patted him on the back, urging him up the steps.
Draco stepped out of the shower later that night, finally warm. Snuggling down under his blanket, he looked at Smaug who lay next to him.
The low din of people cheering could be heard through the muffling Privacy Charm, and Draco pulled back, his arms now around Harry’s neck, his fingers tangled in his messy hair. “I—” He cleared his throat, but his voice still came out husky when he tried again. “I think we have an audience.”
Draco took his foul tea and headed towards a seat on the edge of the tearoom, but a head of dark hair caught his attention, and he made a beeline in that direction.
Draco’s jaw drops, and as he blinks, Harry takes the opportunity to extend his arm, offering Draco the long-stemmed, red-tipped yellow rose Neville had said symbolised friendship evolving into love.
Hermione came out of her initial shock over our correspondence sooner than I’d expected. It only took her a couple of hours, a bottle of wine, and an intense 57-questions interrogation the same evening to eventually accept it. Not that I was ever worried that she wouldn’t. She’s usually a reasonable woman, unlike her boyfriend. Ron still alternates between ignoring the topic altogether and muttering agitatedly about it under his breath. Taken from the frustrated glares Hermione gives him whenever he does that, I’m ready to bet my Firebolt that there’ve been several heated discussions on the matter between the two of them in my absence since I broke the news. No surprise there, really, I know them both well enough to have predicted this very outcome ages ago.
“You’ll see me tomorrow, right? In Diagon? Or are you planning on giving Teddy a broken heart for Christmas?”
Draco approached, careful to keep his voice low as to not frighten the animal. “Hey there.” He sat down on the bench, hoping to entice the dog closer. The dog didn’t growl or give any warning signs, so Draco waited, then spoke gently. “Are you lost? Can I help you find your family?”
Draco’s heart pounded against his ribs as he collapsed on top of Harry, as if wanting to break free only to take up residence in Harry’s heaving chest instead. It was definitely too soon for all that sappy nonsense, Draco knew that much, but even so, he feared it was already too late. He could deny it all he wanted, but the truth was, his heart already belonged to this man. Had done so for longer than he cared to admit.
“A-ageing potion.” Draco’s unsteady voice drew Harry’s attention back to his face, and when Harry looked up, it was to the sight of heavy-lidded eyes and a worried lower lip.
He’d already known their next meeting was going to be a challenge, that if he wasn’t careful, he’d risk an emotional backlash the moment he set eyes on Draco again. He couldn’t allow for it to happen, not after all they’ve been through. Their friendship was too important for Harry to ruin it with his stupid feelings.
Wrapped in his invisibility cloak and with Orion curled around his upper arm, Harry creeps across the grounds to the tower that holds the Owlery. It’s quiet but cold, and he’s sorely tempted to turn back to the warmth of his bed. He probably would, too, if it weren’t for that pulling… It’s starting to get uncomfortable, and Harry needs to figure out what’s going on.
“Yes,” Draco said, watching them carefully. Smaug usually hid from guests in the flat. He was very friendly at the Reserve but generally preferred only Draco in their home, and sometimes Slyvia.
Draco holds up his hand and Harry watches in silence as the glow of Draco’s skin dims into nothing and his wings slowly fade away to disappear as if covered by a glamour. Within a minute, Draco looks normal again — as normal as a stunningly gorgeous man can ever look — stepping into his shoes and covering the bare skin of his torso with a light blue, knitted jumper.
. Draco slunk around the far edge of the bookshelf he’d been perusing, pressing his back against its side, hoping against hope that the witch wasn’t planning to come his way. The Dark Lord was out on a mission tonight, something that always made her antsy and extra eager to “play”.
Honestly, Malfoy, even you must be able to see the irony here? That you, after seven years of constantly mocking me for my rash decisions and reckless behaviour, actually dare to question my motives for the one moment in my life when I’ve been able to rein in my instinctual lion in favour of all those Slytherin traits you’ve always valued so highly.
I seriously hope you’re right, that it’ll get easier with time, and as you said, I’m nothing if not stubborn. (And, honestly, rather curious to find out what you meant about the house wanting to prove itself, to ‘flaunt its capabilities’. You almost make it sound like it’s the bloody Room of Requirement or something.) I’m trying to follow your advice, staying in as much as possible when I’m not otherwise engaged, but Godric knows it’s grating on my every nerve at this point. I get what you’re saying, though. As much as I want to say it sounds like utter crap, it also kind of makes sense, in some weird, fucked up way. So I’ll work on my patience, doing my best to stay sane for as long as possible.
Good news: I haven’t strangled anyone yet. I must admit it was close this morning, though, what with Hermione insisting we’d spend all day in the library studying. Sure, N.E.W.T.s week starts the day after tomorrow, but the weather is perfect and I can't believe I’m not out there on a broom instead of trapped in this dusty library hunched over these boring-as-fuck textbooks.
“Oh, I never said I’d turn down an offer of help.” Those emerald eyes were sparkling now, Draco could hear it in his amused tone. “Not if you’re volunteering…”
“Yeah, I—” Harry scowls at himself in the mirror, wondering why he ever let Malfoy talk him into this.
He lets out a shout and Draco's hand is suddenly tight in Harry's hair, making it even better — a surprise to consider later, for sure. He comes hard, his body overcome with ripples of pleasure. Draco pulls out from Harry's mouth and kneels down before him, pulling him close, kissing and tasting his own residue. He runs a feather over Harry's cock, the gentlest of touches, and then Harry's coming again, a second, completely unexpected wave that takes his breath away.
“I’ve seen the heartbreak, okay?” Harry says firmly, wanting this conversation over and done with already. “I’m not sure I’m up to experience it first-hand.”
fest... Since it's an anon fest, I'm not supposed to reveal any details before the reveals on 15 June, so if you want to have a guess on which LCD story may or may not have my name attached to it, I won't be able to confirm or deny anything until then. 🤐
Harry had almost sprayed a mouthful of his morning Darjeeling all over Draco’s chest the day he’d told him about his seasonal volunteer work.
He pulled back but let her hold on to his hands. “Thanks, Molly. You’ve all been really wonderful and made what could have been a horrible week into something I’ll never forget.”
When he finally settled on a response, he hoped it was good enough. “I wouldn’t do anything to hurt them.”
“Huh.” Harry took his time considering this as he savoured his last mouthful of wine, seemingly unaware of the way the dark red liquid tinted his lips nor the effect this had on Draco’s rapidly increasing heart rate. The sight was so mesmerising Draco nearly didn’t register Harry’s words as he eventually spoke. “Then I guess we might have a problem…”
is something entirely different,” Harry murmured as his arms slid down to Draco’s lower back and pulled him closer. Suddenly, Draco was being enveloped in Harry’s embrace, the change making him acutely aware of Harry’s entire body touching his, his chin fitting into the space between Draco’s shoulder and neck, and when Harry spoke again, his voice was a rumble in Draco’s right ear, his breath tickling the hairs on his neck. “A proper
But Draco wouldn’t give up without a fight. Potter had said Draco was a mystery-solver; well, wouldn’t that come back and bite him in the arse the day Draco finally figured out how to fix the cabinet?
“No buts, Teddy.” The boy flinched at his clipped tone, and Harry realised with trepidation that he, in his distress, had brought his godson to the verge of tears. He swallowed and forced the agitation from his face, careful to replace it with something more akin to concern. “Listen,” he said softly as he squatted in front of the boy. “I know you’re excited to meet Santa, darling, but this is serious. I don’t want to lose you.”
Draco braced himself against the cold ground, bucking his hips in an attempt to throw Potter off before he noticed the complication growing rapidly in Draco’s trousers. But it was too late. Potter was too strong, keeping him pinned down as easy as anything, and to make matters even worse, in his irrational panic, Draco had managed to alert Potter to the one thing he’d fought so hard to hide from the git ever since they ended up as roommates. Potter’s impossibly green eyes widened and then he thrust his hips against Draco’s, gasping as he found his initial suspicions confirmed.
I’m at the academy five days a week, and Hermione’s off at uni most days (she’s studying law at Wixbridge now), only coming home to sleep before leaving again in the morning, apparently. Meanwhile, Ron works evenings and weekends at the shop more often than not, and whenever they both happen to be free at the same time, they have their new home to occupy them. That, and their seemingly never-ending lovey-dovey phase (which I’m still not all too keen to intrude on if I can help it).
Draco buttons his trousers, then helps Harry up and runs his hands along the crease of Harry's arse before tugging up Harry's pants and jeans. He leans down and pushes his nose into Harry's neck, inhaling deeply. "Thank you."
For some reason, the scolding voice in his head always sounded just like Professor Snape. Draco unclenched his jaw and schooled his face into an amicable smile before turning back to the counter with Ginger’s drinks.
How was he supposed to love this? Leaving his home, leaving everything he knew, for a murky old castle all the way up in Scotland — which, for all he cared, might as well be on the other side of the earth? Just because
“Uh, Draco?” Draco could hear the frown in Ernie’s voice. “Is there something you wanted to tell me?”
"You're not," Harry said. "We'll figure out what works for us both, but I'm pretty damned sure it's not the Ministry. And I'm honestly not ready, just like I said." He leaned over and gave Draco a soft kiss. "Right now, it's my birthday and I don't really want to think of anything too complicated."
Any other day, the prodding would probably irritate the hell out of Harry. But while he can still hear the amused smile in Draco’s voice, while he still senses the mischievous twinkle in his eyes, somehow Harry knows Draco’s not out to make fun of him tonight. The teasing tone might be there, but Harry recognises the sincerity resonating in the background, the accompanying sympathy and concern. Despite desperately wanting to talk about anything but the current topic, Harry can’t help but feel grateful for Draco’s friendship. When Draco cares about someone, he does so wholeheartedly
It started so quietly that Draco thought he was imagining it. It was familiar, like some old, forgotten tune that swirled around your brain like smoke on the wind. But then it formed into something solid, something Draco was able to identify.
“I did,” Draco said to his back, following after Harry as he made for the kitchen. “It was highly entertaining to listen to all those spoiled brats talking about their extravagant wishes. Let me tell you, kids these days have no concept of money whatsoever.”
“Of course,” Harry said, amusement dancing in his eyes. “You’re the best Seeker your house has seen in decades.”
I give him a stern look. “My girlfriend would,” I say, surprised by my own words. I have no idea where they come from; I haven’t even looked at a girl in over a year. To be honest, I’m not sure where the surly attitude comes from either. If it weren’t for the monster currently running rampant in my chest, I’d probably just wave the man off with a wink and a laugh. As it is, though, I have no patience for this man, this smirking smug idiot who keeps my attention away from you.
When he managed to return his attention to the girl in front of him, her lips had curved into a sly smirk.
Harry settles against Draco’s firm body, breathing in his addictive scent. His heart is still racing, his mind still trying to make sense of what’s just happened, and for some reason, he can’t stop smiling.
“Oh, thank you.” She smiled gratefully and blushed, as if he’d just told her she was the prettiest girl in the room.
. Draco suppressed a groan. He’d do almost anything to keep hearing that glorious sound every day for the rest of his life. “Actually, it’s part of my kinesiology major, so more like an athletic trainer or exercise physiologist or something. I haven’t really decided yet.”
That is, if you’re able to stop trash-talking my friends. You may have been brought up to hate ‘blood traitors’ and ‘mudbloods’, but they’re my friends and if that’s how this is going to be, then you don’t have to bother writing me any more letters. If you still feel a need to insult someone, I’m sure yours truly will suffice as the sole target for your stupid bullshit for years to come. Okay?
a lot. What the hell are they all even for?) It’s highly entertaining to think about you muttering and swearing as you try to get rid of the dust and cobwebs with nothing but a first-class Nimbus at hand. (You know, even most muggles are better equipped than that, with hoovers and mops and cleaners of all kinds.) The idea of you collapsing sore and sweaty in bed every night after a hard day’s work has effectively brightened my entire week.
It doesn’t help that this particular train of thought has an actual, vivid memory to start from either.
He’d never felt an urge to return, not even for the Quidditch World Cup. Sure, he missed it sometimes, but what he missed most were idyllic memories, of a loving family life in a Wiltshire manor, of the excited flutter in his stomach as he walked along Diagon Alley with his parents as a child — nothing that’d still be there to greet him if he ever decided to go back. No, in the two years he’d been gone, he’d never considered returning. And with every day, the world he’d left behind felt less real; more and more like Narnia, or Neverland; just another one of those made-up places found in ancient fairy tales.
PS No, I’m not immune to the death curse. If you must know, I actually did die that night one year ago. I just… had the opportunity to come back. Sometimes I still wonder if I made the right choice.
The dog turned and barked and ran off towards a family walking down the path out of sight, and Draco grinned. The little moocher. He didn’t have it in him to be annoyed over his lost lunch, though. Even if he hadn’t gotten more than a couple of bites of his sandwich, he felt better, lighter, by the chance encounter.
“Oh fuck, Draco…” Harry gasped as Draco took him in his mouth, swirling his tongue around the swollen head before sucking him in deep. Harry was big, not quite as long as Draco’s, but thicker, heavier. Draco relished the size of it in his mouth, the weight of it on his tongue, and he couldn’t wait for it to fill him up in every possible way.
“Er…” Harry blinked, taking in the boy’s hopeful blue eyes and the elf standing next to him, handing out candy canes. “Sure, why not?”
. I’m in love with him, you know, think I have been ever since Eighth Year. I just thought I’d managed to put it aside, but…” He fed the dog some more of his sandwich but avoided eating anymore himself. “It’s just… He seems to know me inside and out — you should see this snowglobe he made me. Only it’s not snow, it’s flowers, and it’s so gorgeous — and he’s got this kindness in him, this ability to care about people that I’ve never seen in anyone else. But then, I guess now that I’ve gotten to know his family, I understand it better. It’s all of them.”
“Oh, settle down. I don’t normally take in wild animals. He’s a rescue. He has a birth defect and was born with only three legs, and we found him on the Reserve at about three weeks old, abandoned by his mother, starving and cold. I hand fed him until he was bigger, but by then, he was so acclimated to humans that it wasn’t safe to just put him back out in the wild. Besides, baby foxes usually stay with their parents until the autumn after they were born, so at this point, he’s only been with me a few extra months.”
A flash of metal, a slash of flesh, a scream of fury, and then Hagrid’s voice booming over the growing pandemonium.
Draco looked back up at Harry, the delight of victory filling his chest, but Harry only looked uncomfortable as everybody in the room turned to him expectantly.
“Come on in,” I say, moving aside to let you pass before closing the door behind you. “I’ll put the kettle on.”
As will I. No, I don’t want us to sweep our entire past under the rug. If we did that, it’d always remain there, lurking and waiting for a chance to crawl out and bite us in the arse when we least expect it. Rather, I was hoping we’d be able to open the door and set it free, let it run away to bother someone else for a while. And if it happened to get lost somewhere out there, all the better. I can’t say I’d miss it. Would you?
As if sensing his approach, Harry looked up from his book with a bright smile on his face. “Hi, babe.”
He’d thought so, not that it really mattered. Draco knew no promised book bargains would ever manage to instigate anything like the sudden shopping frenzy Madam Malkin was referring to. And neither was the opening of a new shop, Muggle-inspired or not. No, the craze was all about him, about his return, no matter how much he wished it otherwise.
He reaches over and runs his fingers down Orion’s spine, gliding over the corn snake’s emerald scales, warm from sleeping next to Harry and absorbing his body heat. Harry moves his hand to pet the flat part of Orion’s head, eliciting a little moan of pleasure from the snake—or what sounds like one to Harry’s ears, anyway.
“I can’t believe there isn’t any place like this in Diagon Alley!” Ron had exclaimed. He had already fallen in love the first time he’d entered the shop, instantly enamoured by the broad variety of hot and cold beverages, syrup flavours, and delicious pastries, bakes, and cakes. “There really should be, don’t you think, ‘Mione? I’m sure the first to open one would make a fortune in no time.” He had then proceeded to elaborate on his idea for a solid half-hour, blabbering on about his vision of an entire chain of coffee shops all around wizarding Britain; Hogsmeade, Ottery St Catchpole, Godric’s Hollow… He’d even started coming up with name suggestions (all of them abysmal, of course) before he’d looked up at Draco — who’d just come by to clear their table of empty plates which seemed to have been licked clean of every last crumb — and said, “You should do it!”
“Oh, aren’t you just wonderful?” Harry looked up at Draco, his green eyes piercing. “He gets around really well for only having three legs.”
Through the commotion, the dark-haired man made his way over and slapped his hand onto Draco’s shoulder. “Well, little cousin, it seems you’ve saved the day.”
Anyway, we were back at the Three Broomsticks and it was late, okay? And I guess we all had a bit too much to drink and I don’t really know how it happened but I kind of ended up telling Nott and Zabini. About you, I mean.
It took another hour before the reply came, the phone’s unexpected vibration scaring Draco half to death as it resonated through the wood of the nightstand just as he was about to switch off the bedside lamp.
Draco had never shared a bedroom with anyone before, not even his parents. And except for the rare occasion his parents brought him along on one of their holidays, he’d always spent his nights in this very room. Honestly, Draco wasn’t even sure he’d ever be able to sleep anywhere else. But he had to. He wouldn’t be back until just before Christmas, for Salazar’s sake. And right now, that felt like an eternity away, what with summer still holding on for dear life, seemingly not wanting to let go just yet.
Potter gave him a faint but reassuring smile, a smile that quickly faded as the man looked around the room, taking in his surroundings. When his eyes returned to Draco, the raw sadness in them made Draco’s chest ache.
Harry listened intently as Teddy ran into the sitting room and climbed the built-in bench in the bay window to gain a good view of the doorstep.
As they start for the stairs, Harry is struck by a sudden thought, an idea that makes him ridiculously excited in multiple ways.
“We’re going out,” Potter said by way of greeting as he burst into the room like the chaotic whirlwind that Draco had the misfortune to share quarters with.
They dipped up and down over the waves, laughing hysterically when a wave crested early and sprayed them both. They landed in a small inlet sheltered by the rocks and took in the tranquillity of the evening, wrapping it around them.
Draco had come last night — all the way from France. He had sipped hot chocolate with him and Teddy, had admired Harry’s Christmas tree and later kissed him in the kitchen. And then they’d… Harry’s arse clenched at the memory.
It couldn’t be. It was simply impossible. Draco had seen Potter all grown up, all solid and powerful with his crinkling eyes and silver-streaked hair. Potter had spoken to him, had touched him. Had kissed him. And he’d fucking promised…
Blinking up into Draco’s grey eyes, Harry can hardly believe this is happening. But as soft feathers brush the back of his hand, he readily relaxes into the caress. “Please.”
“Yeah.” Teddy’s face lit up like a Christmas tree, his gaze inevitably drawn to the bearded man on the podium. “Yeah, I do.”
"Amazing," Harry answers. And he is. His own cock has softened under the discomfort of his first breach, but it all feels so right that he wouldn't think to complain. "You can move, now."
, was the only thing running through Harry’s mind on a loop as Draco’s eyes flicked to Harry’s mouth, as the tip of Draco’s tongue flitted out to wet those rosy lips, as Harry realised…
His heart was still racing ten minutes later when Teddy was all tucked in; his stomach still fluttery as he whispered, “Sweet dreams, cutie cub,” by the door. His knees were still weak as he descended the stairs, unsure of what awaited him down below.
The sun has moved a good bit across the sky when Harry hears the voices coming closer to his favoured spot under the trees near the lake. He's fully in the shade now, alone after Orion abandoned him a while ago, slithering farther and farther away in his never-ending quest for the sun's warming rays.
Draco chanced a glance at Harry. He hadn’t said a word since they’d all entered the room nearly an hour ago, and although he was surrounded by family, he just looked so…lost. Draco wanted to comfort him, to reassure him Charlie would be fine. Because Charlie already was fine, wasn’t he? Both Draco and Sirius knew that. And now…
Draco whirled on Harry and walked backwards, suddenly irate. “But what? I’m an ex-Death Eater? I’m a slimy Slytherin? I can’t grow up and become a different sort of person and find gratification in helping others?” His breathing was coming quickly, and he wasn’t sure if the burning behind his eyes was due to the urge to hex the man or the desire to cry. Either way, it pissed him off, and he whirled back around, slamming the door to the office building behind him as he entered the warm, dry room.
“Of course I did, every fucking day.” Draco still remembered the long, sleepless nights that first year with no one but Fayette to keep him company. “Just because you had a shitty childhood and no family worth its name to be homesick for doesn’t mean nobody else did.”
“Which is why I like it, Harry.” Draco averted his gaze to take in the room. “You know, my parents never took the time to sit down with me and make garlands out of multicoloured paper. They never let me help to decorate the tree. Salazar knows what would’ve happened if everything wasn’t absolutely perfect where someone was able to notice.”
“Draco, dear, take my seat,” Molly suggested, waving Draco over. “I’m sure it’ll do him good to have you near.”
“Mr Potter, Mr Malfoy, welcome!” the intern greeted them from their desk and began to recite a list of rules that Draco himself had put together the other day.
They each placed their orders, but as they waited for their drinks, the silence grew heavier and both seemed equally reluctant to break it. Stepping back outside, Draco took a fortifying sip of his tea before saying what was on his mind.
You lay curled up on your bed, fully clothed, with your back against the door. You even have your shoes on, for Merlin’s sake, and if that’s not a tell-tale sign something’s terribly wrong, I don’t know what is. My socked feet make no sound as I walk the few steps needed to reach your bed. I hesitate for just a moment before I sit down beside you, lifting my hand to place on your arm when I notice the slight tremble of your shoulder.
I don’t know why I keep blabbering, probably in an attempt to keep your mind off your bloody Father. And to keep mine off the fact that I’ve just offered you to move in, to stay. Indefinitely. “Now, where do you think we should go first? Twilfitt and Tatting’s? Flourish and Blotts? Quality Quidditch Supplies? Scribbul—”
Again, please forgive any typos! Also please enjoy my “Draco used to wear a ton of glamours to make his skin and hair look nice but now he doesn’t bother” headcannon.
Harry nodded slowly. “Yeah, I just, I’m not sure if this really applies, but I’ve heard that sometimes wizarding therapists will use Legilimency. And I don’t know if you do or if that’s true or anything, but I really, really don’t want to do that…” He trailed off again, glancing up briefly to meet Madam Batra’s eyes.
Harry would have bet anything that they were Luna’s, and that they had been sitting there in the little room for a few years, waiting to be found. He pocketed them and stood up in the hallway, deciding all at once to see what other secret passages and hallways he could find that were still functional. Perhaps there were more things to find.
Harry thought to himself that it was the peacefulness that made him feel the most on edge these days, but aloud he said, “I suppose you’re right. I’m sorry, you were saying something before, I didn’t mean to interrupt.”
Harry Potter stood outside the Burrow, watching the stars slowly come into view as the light faded over the horizon. A chill seeped into the air, and the cold breeze cooled the still stinging burns on his arm, and made a shiver go down his spine. He stood and watched the stars until looking up started to make him dizzy, listening to the sounds of nocturnal animals beginning to awake and the rustling of grass in the wind. When he could no longer look up for the vertigo, he closed his eyes and focused on the sounds and the smells of the fields, the way the grass and dirt smelled rich and earthy, the subtle flapping of wings as bats left their roosts and raced through the air after flying insects, and the hint of acrid smoke and ash that still was carried by the breeze, even now. Harry Potter stood there, alone in the night, swaying from the wind and the exhaustion that ate at him, the grief that made his thoughts swirl, and the euphoric relief that it was finally, finally over.
Hermione shook her head. “Don’t apologize, it was nothing important. We were just comparing schedules, is all.”
Off on his quest, and fiddling with the tiny bird earrings in his pocket while he walked, Harry’s thoughts turned to Luna again. What would she say about his predicament? He felt a stranger in a place he had once known so well, and he couldn’t keep track of his days. He thought hard, trying to embody Luna’s mindset. Perhaps the castle felt unfamiliar because… it was not the same castle? Because it had changed so much? ‘No,’ Harry thought, ‘That’s too simple, too obvious. I need to think in loops, the way she does. See some connection there that isn’t so easy.’ Taking the winding turns through the castle with a more deliberate air now, Harry tried to think in metaphors and loops, as Luna would. ‘Maybe,’ he thought, ‘I can’t find my routine because there’s still something that my routine needs. Something I need to do this year that I don’t know about yet.’ Harry rolled one of the little bird earrings between his fingers, feeling the texture of the little feathers as it ruffled in his grasp. ‘Maybe,’ he thought again.
he thought as he started walking again. Strange as the interaction had been, Harry couldn’t help but feel glad that whatever grudges he and Malfoy still had could be put aside. Harry had saved his life after all, and he was frankly too exhausted to maintain that old hatred any longer.
he scolded himself again when a second year raced loudly down the steps and Harry found himself on his feet before he knew what was happening, wand in hand pointed at the terrified kid. “Sorry,” Harry said quickly, tucking his wand back into his pocket. The second year bolted out of the Common Room while Harry called, “Sorry!” at her retreating back again. He sighed loudly and flopped heavily into a chair. His back was to a window, and alarms sounded in his head, so he got up and moved to a chair that was in a corner where he could see everything, then he thought that was stupid and moved back to the first chair, where his rearranged all the items in his bag until lunch.
“Well, while dad was home, he had a really hard time getting better. Not because of his injuries or anything, but because he kept having these awful nightmares, and he would start getting nervous anytime the kettle whistled, or at any other noise that sounded like hissing. So he saw a doctor, a Healer like Madam Batra, and got therapy. And it worked. It took a long time, and it’s still not perfect, but it worked.” Ron looked up, catching Harry’s eye. “Hermione and I are going to see her too. We didn’t get told to, but I think it will help. With what we went through last year, and especially you, I think we’ll all need it. No shame in it, it’s just our bodies trying to protect us and thinking that since we’re here, the battle’s still happening. It would happen to anyone in our situation, you know? I think it’ll help you. Help all of us”
The next morning Ron and Hermione convinced Harry that he should go to breakfast, despite his protests that he wasn’t feeling well. “That’s exactly why you should come. You barely ate last night, Harry, you probably just need food,” Hermione had said, pulling gently at his arm. Ron just commented that he looked “bloody awful,” and agreed with Hermione that a spot of breakfast would perk him up. In the end he had acquiesced and thrown on a wrinkly t-shirt and some jeans, then pulled on his new grey robes to cover his muggle clothing.
The castle still felt odd. No matter what Harry did, the memories of the battle and all the awful things that had happened overtook the memories of all the days he had spent in classes, and the nights that he had spent up late goofing off with his housemates. All those moments paled in comparison to the deaths and horrors which took place in the same spaces. Harry was now weeks into the school year, four sessions in with Madam Batra, and still he could not find a routine that felt like the ones he had developed over his previous six years at Hogwarts.
I have no idea when we came to this, how we suddenly became each other’s confidants. I only know that we are, that you, for some inexplicable reason, trust me with stuff you never tell anyone else, that I tell you more than I probably should, that you now know me better than any of my other friends does. Apart from the one big secret hidden deep in my heart, protected by carefully constructed walls, you know all there is to know about me. All the shit, all the flaws, all the mess; it’s a wonder you still endure my company.
Draco chose not to answer as he grabbed a glass food container from the refrigerator and started scooping up Smaug’s dinner into a fresh bowl. Pursing his lips, he briefly considered whether he should treat Smaug to something extra tonight or not. It was New Year’s, after all, and Draco was about to leave him all alone again, the poor creature. Coming to a quick decision, he returned the container to the fridge and took out the jar of crumbled crispy bacon the fox loved more than anything else. Too bad Draco couldn’t stand the smell it made as he fried it up for him; but what could you do? It wasn’t like he could ever deny Smaug his favourite food.
“I asked him for a boyfriend for you,” Teddy repeated with a shrug, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. “Can we have that ice cream now?”
It’s nice to know you’ve considered my state of mind, but don’t ever feel bad for unloading your shit on me. We all have days like that, and Godric knows I’ve contributed my fair share of misery to this exchange too these past few months. If anything, I’m honoured to know you find me trustworthy enough to share your inner musings, whatever they may be. And no matter how hard you try, I’m fairly sure no letter of yours could ever darken my mood. Not really.
Malfoy had suggested Harry ‘do his thing’ for the first hour of their so-called date, claiming he wanted to ‘observe and evaluate his raw material’ before deciding on a plan of action.
Draco had grown so accustomed to Muggle attire over the years that he seldom spared it a second thought anymore, but seeing Harry now, looking exactly like he did that first time Draco met him, he was suddenly reminded of how weird he’d found Harry’s clothes that night. How foreign and confusing.
, and had huddled here in the darkness ever since, clutching his silver Sickle so tightly in his fist his fingers had started to tingle. Hiding. Like the fucking coward he was.
"Are you okay?" Draco's eyes are closed and he's using Harry's outstretched leg as support, resting his head against Harry's calf.
It’s not like love is a regular topic of conversation between them or anything. Not that they never talk about philosophical stuff; they do. But
Yes, I have them too; resourcefulness, cunning, determination, ambition, pride — even the sorting hat sensed them in me, long before I learnt to appreciate those aspects of my personality myself. Life was so much easier then, back when the world was black and white — or in our case, green and red. One is good, the other evil; no greys in between to smudge the edges of our carefully sketched-out map of life. But that’s not what real life is like, is it? We both know that by now. As your cousin Sirius once said, ‘we all have light and dark within us’, and we all carry traits from all four houses. More or less prominent, of course, but still.
Draco twirled around and strode back towards the office building where he’d be able to Floo home and put on his pyjamas. And then maybe he’d have a good cry over a carton of ice cream and a cuddle with his fox. Because fuck Harry Potter.
“Right. Of course, you know. Because you work there.” The embarrassment in Harry’s voice made the corner of Draco’s mouth twitch. “Anyway, the Wheezes are in charge of the fireworks display, and Ron and I were supposed to transport the supplies this evening. It’s my only night available, but Hermione started having some early contractions, and they are monitoring her at St Mungo’s, so I—”
Looking down at the wedding band on my finger, there’s nothing else for me to do but acknowledge that she was right all along.
“One almond scone and a green tea, please.” The forty-something woman barely looked Draco’s way while placing her order, already scanning the room for possible seating options.
Draco rolled his eyes. “For Salazar’s sake. I know he just thinks he’s being funny, and I couldn’t care less about the pathetic jibes he still insists on throwing my way, but… Surely he must realise how it’s affecting the kids?”
Bellatrix’s cackle broke through the clatter of books raining down from what used to be a bookshelf a few yards away.
. Leave it to Charlie to pick this very moment to finally notice him in that way. Draco wanted to sob in frustration.
good, in his green kilt — And wasn’t that an odd choice of formal wear for someone who was neither Scottish nor part of any clan? — he had a hard time focusing on the man.
“Huh?” Draco was blurry when Harry turned to look at him, an abstract blob of colour extending a hand with Harry’s… “Oh, thanks.” Harry accepted his glasses and put them on, grinning as Draco’s striking features returned to his face.
Harry lifts his head to give Draco a glare. “First: Ow,” he admonishes before laying back down, snuggling even closer into Draco’s warm body than before. “Second: I don’t know. Maybe because you’re an evil person who’s out to deprive me of my perfectly brilliant napping spot?”
Draco examined them, then his eyes grew wide and he looked down at Smaug. “Oh, Merlin, he has a cat!”
Draco stared at Harry, confused. “Why? I’m perfectly capable of Apparating myself, or taking the Floo.”
“Oh, hi George. What are you doing here?” Draco stood up to greet Charlie’s brother with a handshake, but George pulled him into a hug instead. Draco could feel Ernie’s gaze on them, but he ignored it.
“Well, aren’t you a well-behaved little guy?” The owl let out a little hoot of agreement as Draco untied the scroll attached to his leg. He fetched an owl treat from a ceramic bowl on the sideboard and held it out, watching as the owl grabbed it in his beak and flew away.
“Nice try, but no.” Gabrielle’s stern voice had no trouble carrying over the noise of frothing milk. “
The Hebridean Dragon Sanctuary had run for generations under the direction of the MacFusty clan, but the clan had slowly diminished and, after the last war, they were hardly able to keep it running. They’d approached the Park Foundation for help, and with Pansy looking for ways to diversify her family’s charitable reach, she’d taken over its management. And, as Draco worked for Pansy’s foundation, it often left him to deal with the paperwork and other administrative tasks.
And that’s why I simply can’t get why you shouldn’t be allowed to choose your own wife. Because, after what I witnessed on the night of the final battle, I have no doubt your parents love you more than anything in the world. Have you ever talked to them about it? Maybe if you did, they would let you choose for yourself? Come on, we’re at the brink of a new millennium, surely even the pure-bloods would be interested in getting with the times? Or do you plan to stay in the 19th century forever? What’s to say you couldn’t produce an heir with the love of your life? What are these repercussions you’re talking about? You are correct that I don’t get it; so tell me. I do want to understand.
You got a Muggle Survival Kit? I’m sure you understand why the idea makes me wanna laugh. Surely, even you must be able to admit it’s a bit ironic. I’m guessing that’s something the Ministry supplied you with? Well, I guess a torch would be hard to get to function in an ancient magical house like yours — I can’t even get my wristwatch to work in Grimmauld Place (which is bloody annoying, really) —  but see if you haven’t got a box of matches in there somewhere. A small rectangular box with thin wooden sticks in it? If you drag the coated end against the rugged side of the box, swiftly but not too forcefully (or you’ll break the stick), it should light up for long enough to set flame to a candle wick.
“Aw, poor you,” Harry offered, playing along and adding a sympathetic pout for good measure. “Then you better sit down for a while, Mr Claus. D’you want some hot chocolate?”
“No, you absolute tosser, I do.” Draco huffs amused, smacking Harry’s arse cheek without malice. “Why would I even consider it otherwise?”
Dinner was amazing. There were so many different foods, so many cheerful people, all of them adamant to include him as much as possible. What felt like dozens of conversations washed over Draco, vying for his attention, asking for his opinion; even Ron and Hermione included him in their discussion about paint colours for their nursery, in which he insisted that green was the best colour for any newborn child. Of course, it was; green is commonly known to be a soothing colour. However, the couple seemed to take it as a joke, and Draco let them, feeling oddly pleased when they both laughed and thanked him.
Harry’s hand fell away as Draco finally turned and looked at him, genuinely perplexed. “Why do you ask that?”
Draco opened his mouth to reply but…nothing came out. Before he knew it, the girl winked at him and walked away, leaving Draco standing there, speechless, confused, and— No. Not even a little bit intrigued.
Harry flicks the switch on the kettle, marvelling in the unlikely friendship he and Draco have managed to forge between them since the war ended. Who would’ve thought they’d ever be able to be in the same room without wanting to hex each other into next week? The perpetual rivals of their schooldays, the opposing poles of a full-on war, the indoctrinated Death Eater and the hero of the wizarding world.
He looked back down at the dog, who was snuffling at his hand now, and laughed. Draco gave it some more of the sandwich and scratched the dog behind its ears.
The endearing couple had come to Beans & Serendipitea every Friday without fail for as long as any member of staff could remember, entering the front door at three o’clock on the dot, rain or shine. They always sat at the same little table by the window, and if you valued your employment, you knew to put out the reserved sign on it well ahead of time.
Please don’t remind me about that awful day in Myrtle’s bathroom. As you already know, it’s still plaguing me every other night, and I’m pretty sure I’ll have to live with the regret for the rest of my life. I know I shouldn’t have done that to you, no matter what spell you were trying to hit me with, and I still can’t explain why I chose to use that spell. As you say, an Expelliarmus would’ve sufficed just fine, and instead, I went with an unfamiliar curse, unaware of what it would do to you. ‘For enemies’ the description had said, nothing else. Hell, I didn’t even know who’d invented it at the time. Did he ever tell you it was his spell that nearly bled you dry? I bet he didn’t; I sure as hell wouldn’t have wanted to, had I been in his shoes. But then again, he was an awfully brave man, so maybe he did.
godfather, though, he’d better remember that. He was Harry’s. And kind of Charlie’s. His allegiance laid elsewhere, evidently.
Draco blinked and cleared his throat. A movement in his peripheral vision caught his attention and he briefly tore his eyes from the man before him to get a glance of whatever it was. Arthur, Molly, Sirius, Ron, and Hermione were huddling behind Harry, huge grins on all their faces. Sirius’ brows were so high they were practically joined with his hairline, and he was nodding at Draco frantically.
“I missed it sometimes, of course I did, especially in the beginning. It was all I had ever known, after all. But it’s not like coming back would ever be the same, I—” He swallowed around a sudden lump in his throat. “I know I’m not welcome there anymore.”
Merlin, if anyone had told Draco ten years ago that he’d be smitten by a Weasley, he’d have questioned their sanity. But he was a different person now, and it was a different world. All of that old nonsense seemed so long ago, so ridiculous and unimportant.
“That was an irresponsible act, and it’s no surprise he was injured,” Percy Weasley’s imperious tone cut through, and Draco watched all the siblings roll their eyes. Draco was just wondering if he could slip out the door unnoticed when the two people he’d been dreading the most entered the room.
family — and even though it had left him with an overstuffed stomach and a slight ringing in his ears, there was no doubt they all loved him.
Harry chuckles and moves around the small table to take a seat on the chair next to mine. “Because I love knowing I still have the ability to get a rise out of you, and”— I narrow my eyes at him —“because you’re absolutely adorable when you go into that indignant lecture mode of yours.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Seriously, though? How do people cope without seeing their kids every day? I mean, we’re going to be back in this house, constantly reminded of his absence, while Sirius will soon be all wrapped up in school and friends and undoubtedly having a blast. Do you think he’ll even remember us enough to miss us?”
Harry crawls back into bed, closing the curtains, and Orion slithers over his hand to wrap himself around Harry’s wrist. The pull in his chest is getting stronger, stretching tighter.
prissy twats, then do’nt. If you want to choose your own wife, do it! If you want to marry for love, just fucking do it already!
I frown at the contents of our pantry, still unsure what to make for dinner even after minutes of vacant staring. It’s impossible to come to a decision when all I can think about is the fact that you won’t be here to join me. “Yeah?”
“I think he’s talking about Draco.” Luna smiled and took another bite of porridge. Next to her, holding her hand, Neville merely raised a quizzical eyebrow in Harry’s direction.
She stared at him, then sighed. “Ernie has requested Christmas Eve and Christmas Day off. His little sister just got engaged and his family is making a big deal about it. And Jillian has a ski vacation already scheduled.”
Sunday dinner at the Burrow was quieter than Christmas had been, with Bill, Percy, and their families missing. Hermione was on temporary bed rest for a few days, so she and Ron were absent too, leaving a more manageable ten people at the table, including Draco.
How was he supposed to move on and forget about Draco when Draco kept showing up whenever he shouldn’t? When he kept acting so strange and mysterious? When he kept being all sassy and witty and— No, gorgeous wasn’t really the right word.
It’s not even gone three weeks before Harry realises with trepidation that he’s falling — rapidly and irrevocably — in love with Draco sodding Malfoy. Draco — because he’s Draco now, even if Harry will never allow himself to say it out loud — who’s so charming and flirty that Harry tends to forget it’s all just for show, that Draco’s only like this because he’s teaching Harry his ‘moves’. Harry tries to remind himself it’s not real, that Draco’s not actually interested although it sometimes seems like he is.
Michael Aspel congratulates a white-haired woman who’s just found out her grandmother’s tattered sewing kit is worth a veritable fortune. She’s shocked, of course, but positively giddy. I try to focus on their conversation —
“No, not at all. But I do think there are people that, once you choose them and they choose you, will become your one person.”
,” Malfoy declares, letting the word settle between them as he takes the first sip of his mochaccino. A speck of white foam clings to his upper lip, and Harry can but watch as the tip of Malfoy’s pink tongue darts out to catch it. “While there are certain topics you should always avoid in the initial phase of dating” —
“They’re so soft,” Harry murmurs and spreads his hand just as he did on Draco’s arm. Under his splayed fingers, the feathers seem to fluff out, little bits of down poking out from underneath the long flight feathers on top, drawn to his skin as if by magnetism.
“Hey…” Draco leans over to place his mug on the coffee table, then turns in his seat to face Harry, one leg bent over the cushion between them, his knee mere inches from Harry’s thigh. “You can’t mean that, Harry. Aren’t you Gryffindors supposed to be romantic optimists?”
Then Harry’s thumb moved, just a tentative brush of skin against sensitive skin, and with a tremor, Draco came undone. In one single stroke, Draco’s floodgates were unlocked and left wide open, allowing for all resistance to flow out of his system and make room for nothing but aching need and desperate desire. In one single stroke, Draco’s pent-up emotions came bursting out of his mouth in one raunchy moan. In one single stroke, Draco’s hold on his own body gave way, releasing his hips to finally thrust against the mattress the way they’d been craving to do for so long.
Although I’d never question your abilities for potions or bureaucracy, I have to say I am starting to get a bit concerned for your mental state after all. Maybe I was wrong, maybe you’re actually going insane over there after all. At least, that’s the only explanation I can come up with, because hell if I know why else you’d gush about my skills like that. Well, I guess you could have meant it as a joke, but it didn’t really read as one, and so far, insanity is the only other reason I can think of. Because you can’t seriously be out to compliment me, can you?
“Check,” he ground out as he strode past her for the umpteenth time. His body was exhausted after days consumed with work and several restless nights, yet he wasn’t able to sit down for more than mere minutes at a time. So he paced.
Someone whimpers as their lips part. Harry’s unsure of who, but it doesn’t matter. The sound urges him to hurry his actions so they can resume their kissing as soon as humanly possible. Thankfully, Draco is quick to catch on, pulling Harry’s shirt over his head in one swift motion as if he’d been reading Harry’s thoughts. Draco’s shirt follows suit, and once they’re both discarded on the floor somewhere, Harry takes a moment to admire the sight before him.
“Sure you can. How else are you going to learn enough about him to keep this whole thing up? Where is it?”
“Tomsy is to take young sir Edward to meet Master Santa Claus,” said the male elf who’d just returned a beaming son to Mrs Finch-Fletchley. Without further ado, the elf then turned on his heel, clearly expecting Teddy to follow him as he strode over the podium as fast as his short legs could carry him.
Draco looks as though he’s unsure of what to say, his mouth open but speechless. However, his eventual reply speaks louder than words as he curls one of his wings around his body in invitation, allowing for Harry to reach it.
“Please, I—” Potter slowly slid his hands out of his pockets, palms open and empty, raising them to eye level in a surrendering gesture. Leaving himself vulnerable. The fucking idiot. “I don’t want to—”
“Charlie has a piercing on his…” He hesitated and glanced at Molly, hoping she’d forgive him. “On his penis. Through the head. He just got it last month.”
“Suit yourself.” You grin, downing the shot and placing the glass next to your already empty one on the bar.
“Wow, that’s… brilliant, Malfoy. Good for you.” Harry’s fairly sure the sinking feeling in his gut is due to the fact that Malfoy hasn’t cared to mention this significant detail about his life to him earlier. He frowns. “But then, why aren’t you—?
But, you know me; why do it now when you can do it later, yeah? Usually works pretty well too, until there’s suddenly no later left to… D’you know if there’s a cure to recurrent
Sirius nodded. “I know. I’ll back you up with the family, make sure they know it was all a mistake.”
She nodded. “Thank you. I deserve it. His presence alone will draw the attention of an entirely new set of donors.”
“Shh,” Draco admonished, looking around him at the staring eyes of the other patrons. “For Merlin’s sake, Sirius.”
“One of the most critical factors for successful dating is the choice of where and how you’ll be spending your date. You’ll want to have a good time, or more specifically, you’ll want
“I guess I’ll have to take your word for it then.” Draco could see Molly still wasn’t completely convinced about the brilliance of apple-cheese combining, but he was quite sure Arthur would eventually talk her into making it for him to try.
Harry popped a piece of bacon in his mouth and shrugged. “Doing what? I just want to make sure everyone is treating each other the right way.”
“Yeah, loads.” You beam, gesturing an order to the bartender with the confident air of someone who’s been frequenting this club for years and not mere weeks. The exchange only takes a couple of seconds and then your eyes are back on me, intense, sparkling, mesmerising. “You should come dance too.”
“Okay…?” Draco frowned, hesitated, and then reached for the box. Their fingers brushed, and Harry finally raised his gaze to meet Draco’s eyes through thick, inky black lashes. There was something so confusing stirring in those green depths; Draco found it impossible to look away. Under their eye-lock, Draco’s hands fumbled as he slowly lifted the lid from the box and waited, unsure as to what he was waiting for.
Then, as he’d lain in bed in the dead of night, flashes of emerald eyes, bronze skin, and raven-black hair preventing him from falling asleep, he’d finally succumbed to the dark and let himself fantasise about the impossible — about those five words actually being true.
He cleared his throat. “Right, well, this isn’t a bowl; it’s a sculpture. I saw it last night, actually. I’m surprised it’s here already.”
Two hours later, Harry realises he doesn’t mind sucking at dating at all; at least not as long as he gets to do it the Malfoy way.
His best friends and his boyfriend each take seats next to him and Draco leans in, kissing him gently on the cheek. The familiar smell of caramel filling his senses makes Harry hum in pleasure and one word floats to the top of his befuddled mind.
Sirius rambled about his motorbike as they stepped onto the next lift and ascended to the fifth floor. Draco tried to listen, but his mind was racing with the sudden realisation that this was his opportunity. He could come clean, explain everything to this man who reminded Draco so much of family.
He’s not surprised to notice their arrival manages to turn quite a few heads, but it all soon fades away when he catches the wondrous expression on Draco’s face. He looks like a child on Christmas morning, taking in the prestigious venue with evident admiration, his vibrant eyes sparkling in the light from the many chandeliers. He’s so gorgeous like this, all happy and unguarded. Harry has never wanted him more.
?” Not that he didn’t trust his abilities on a broom, but Sweet Salazar. “Will I become a Prefect too?”
After that first encounter in the Owlery, the scene seemed to repeat itself, with Harry finding more and more reasons to send letters, and with Malfoy being there nearly every time, his gaze lost far away amongst the clouds in the sky.
“I know we haven’t spoken before, not really, but I’ve wanted to talk to you for ages. I just never knew how.” Draco paused, wondering if the man really could hear him. Probably not.
so good," Draco mumbles in his ear, urging Harry to move against him — as if Harry needed a reminder. Because honestly, Harry couldn't stop himself if he tried. He's too far gone and this feels too perfect to ever stop. He could die this way and he'd be perfectly content. "So good for me," Draco whispers again, eliciting another raunchy moan straight from Harry's core.
Draco’s hand went into his pocket by instinct, tracing the familiar shape of the silver coin that had kept him going for over five and a half years now.
Harry rolled his eyes and leaned in to give him a quick peck on the lips. All right, then, two. And a third, just because. And then another that went on for longer than he’d intended it to. Draco’s lips were so soft and pliant, his low purr like music to Harry’s ears. Draco’s hand moved lazily along Harry’s spine, making Harry’s cock twitch and his skin tingle in anticipation.
No one seemed to notice him as he joined the crowd pouring out onto the front steps of the castle, his gaze searching for—
PPS And just so you know, it’s not always I manage to save you in those nightmares, Malfoy. In fact, I can’t even remember the last time I did. But I guess they’re better than the ones where I have to watch you bleed to death on a wet tiled floor; at least I get to end my life on a broom.
Harry blinked at Draco’s words, promptly ignoring the amusement in his voice, as well as the heat creeping up his own cheeks.
Draco pulls out of Harry and Harry gasps, the sudden emptiness making him feel like there's a vital piece of him missing. But it's not for long. Draco rocks back onto his knees, not sitting, not kneeling, but something in between as he motions for Harry to turn over, grabbing his torso from behind and pulling him up against his chest.
“Sometimes.” Draco shrugged. “Doesn’t really matter how you do it, though. As long as it’s apples and cheese, you can’t go wrong. You should try slicing Cheddar over apple pie someday,” he added in Molly’s direction. “When the cheese melts and trickles down to mingle with the fruit… magic, I tell you.”
“Oh, Merlin,” Draco interrupted, instantly worried about his new friend. “Is she okay? And the baby? Do they need anything?”
It had been like this all day, not that Draco had really expected anything else. It wasn’t every day a new shop opened up in Diagon Alley, after all. And, as if his exotic injection of Muggle culture wasn’t already enough to spike the interest of everyone and their Crup, a visit to Espresso Patronum also offered the added allure of a first-hand glimpse of the infamous, enigmatic wizard who’d allegedly stolen their precious Saviour’s heart.
Harry chances a glance at his flatmate. He looks content, all relaxed and mellow, but Harry knows better. There’s a minute twitch in his jaw, and his hands are clutching the colourful mug too tightly. Add to that the fact Draco came back from his date much earlier than Harry had expected him to. Something is off. Harry just knows it, just as his instincts have always been able to pick up on these things when it comes to Draco.
Harry didn’t seem to need the nudge Molly was giving him, though, and gave Draco a little smile. “No, please, let me walk with you. At least to the coffee shop across the street? I’ll buy you one before you head home.”
But for fuck’s sake, Malfoy, you're such a bloody tease. You can’t just mention you draw too and then go straight on to saying you won’t show me. Of course I’d want to see! Especially now, after having heard proof of how artistic you are. What do you usually draw? Would you at least tell me that?
When they finally entered Charlie’s hospital room together, most of the family was already gathered. Percy and his wife were missing, as were George and Angelina, and none of the children were there, either, but the others huddled around the bed talking, with Molly sitting and holding Charlie’s now healed hand.
“Mr Malfoy, the Head Healer was hoping to speak with you and Mr Weasley’s family this evening about his progress. Will you attend?”
Charlie cocked his head, a gentle smile on his face. “That’s a nice way to think about it. Thank you.”
“Draco is his fiancé,” a sweet voice came from the door. Draco turned his head towards Hannah in alarm. His
I can’t believe your having me up this blooody early… It’s only like — well, fuck me, it’s actually half ten, but we only got back a few hours ago and I’m so fucking tired I can’t even… Yet, here I am,
Draco wrapped slender fingers around his cup and pulled it close to his face, inhaling the sweet scent of the chocolate. His half-moon glasses fogged up when he did, prompting him to tilt his head down to look at Harry over the frames as he murmured a soft, “Thank you.”
Harry swallowed, lowering his gaze to where his hand was still tangled in Draco’s white-blond locks. “A-and what if I can’t wait that long?” he murmured.
Harry busied himself with another sip of tea and Draco made an effort to do the same, careful not to let his hands tremble too much from the adrenaline rushing through his veins.
Draco hugged his loyal friend closer. Here in the dark, he didn’t really care what his father had to say about it.
“A charity that helps children and Muggleborns?” His tone sounded sceptical and taunting, at least to Draco’s ears.
Michael introduces Richard the Clock Expert to a ridiculous cuckoo clock and its hopeful owner. Before, you would’ve commented on it, said something witty, and then we’d snicker about it together. We’d guess its value and bicker about it for a while until Richard voiced his verdict, allowing one of us to bask in the glory of the most accurate guess. And it used to be a serious competition too; least wins of the evening earned the loser kitchen duty the entire upcoming week.
Add to that my attempts to appease this house by trying to stay in as much as possible when I’m not expected at the academy. The end result is a staggering two (!) Sunday brunches between us so far this month, one at their cottage and one here. The rest of the gang I’ve hardly seen at all, every one of us off somewhere, doing something or other, trying to figure out how to do the grown-up thing. (It’s curious how it often feels like we’re all so far beyond our age, thanks to all the things we’ve been through, and yet, the next minute, it’s like we’re just tiny, floundering kids, trying to find our footing in a big scary adult world we know nothing about.)
I still haven’t decided if I should go over there for Sunday brunch tomorrow, maybe I will. McGonagall has offered me to use her floo if I want to go, and it would’ve been nice to meet them all again. I just don’t know if I’ll be able to take it. Maybe I’ll know when I wake up tomorrow morning.
A minute goes by without any sign of life from inside. You clearly want me to leave you alone, but something tells me that I shouldn’t, that you might need me. So I call out your name a third time, following it up with a soft triple knock.
He knew he should come up with a witty reply, but he had no idea what he was supposed to say to a statement like that, so utterly Gryffindor-ish — bold and brave in a way Draco could only dream of being able to replicate. So he did what he’d always done, he turned to sarcasm.
just around the block, and as Draco approached the door, he realised the walk hadn’t been nearly long enough to prepare him for this. He’d been looking forward to this moment all day and yet, now he was here, a knock away from standing face to face with Harry, in his home, alone, just the two of them… Draco swallowed. He wasn’t ready. There was no way he could ever—
“Nah, but it happens. George and Ron usually take care of it, but… Well, George is the expert anyway; I’m mostly here to assist, making sure nobody distracts him and helping clean up the shells after he finishes. It can be dangerous to do it alone.”
You shrug it off with a wry smile, just like you always do. But before you do, your gaze flits to something behind me, your eyes narrowing slightly at whatever it is that’s caught your attention.
“Draco! You made it. Here.” She shoved a glass of chilled white wine into his hands. Draco estimated she’d had at least a couple of those herself already, at least if her loud and boisterous voice was anything to go by. “Now, please tell me you’re going to relax and have fun tonight.”
Your guess is correct, Narcissa saved my life on the night of the final battle, lying straight to Riddle’s face, telling him I was dead when I wasn’t. If she hadn’t, he would’ve tried to kill me again, and although I should probably let her tell you about her motives herself, I know she did it because she was eager to get into the castle and find you, to make sure you were all right. Yes, I testified for her, but you don’t owe me anything, Malfoy. None of you does. Testifying for you both was the least I could do after you’ve both risked your lives to save mine. If anything, I’m the one indebted to you after what happened in that bathroom two years ago.
“Now, where’s my courageous lion?” Draco gives him a wry smile, but his soft, grey eyes contain nothing but warmth. Warmth drawing Harry in, stealing his breath, weakening his resolve. No matter how much he tries, Harry finds himself unable to look away.
At one end of the table, Ginny was relating her latest match to Angelina. Or, maybe attempting to relate was closer to the truth, considering the constant interruption of questions from young Fred. At the other end, George did his best to persuade Roxanne to at least taste the chicken before rejecting it, all the while trying to keep his mother from noticing her grandchild’s scepticism about the food. When Molly turned to Arthur to tell her about some blue apron she was altering for her cousin Teedle, Draco felt a tingle at the nape of his neck and looked across the table to find Harry’s intense green eyes on him. Draco raised a questioning eyebrow and Harry raised his own, then let his eyes drift from one family member to the next before meeting Draco’s gaze again with a grin.
“You’ve come to the right place,” I say instead. “Come on.” I stand up and gesture for you to do the same. “My spare room is yours for the taking, and tomorrow we’ll go out and get you anything you need, okay?”
It didn’t last for nearly long enough. The protracted build-up, after months (if not years) of mutual pining, made it impossible for either one of them to delay the inevitable. Draco had barely wrapped his hand around Harry’s cock before Harry came with a shout, spurting all over his chest and probably over Draco’s as well. Draco wasn’t far behind, pulled over the edge just a few strokes later by the sight of Harry coming and the pulsating feel of Harry’s arse clenching around his cock.
“Well, yeah, he’s donated before. I think you bought one, actually. The large ruby bowl you have on your coffee table?”
. “He’s been in school together with Potter for six years, you know; imagine the amount of intel that must be dwelling in that blond head of his, just waiting to be examined and put to better u—”
So instead, he scowled. “But seriously, no socks? In December? We’re going to northern Scotland, you dunce. You’ll freeze.”
Draco’s heart pounded wildly against his ribs. What had happened? Narcissa and her sister had been in here not even five minutes ago, and they’d been talking about having tea in the Purple Parlour, not the drawing-room. No one ever even considered taking tea in the drawing-room these days; that room was dedicated to Death Eater meetings and…
Harry barely registered the first knock, drowned out as it was by Teddy’s coming down the stairs. The boy had been coaxed to change into his pyjamas, bribed by the promise of marshmallows topping off his hot chocolate, and even though it would probably send him into another sugar rush, Harry figured it’d be worth it. If nothing else, just to experience the beaming smile that had overtaken Teddy’s face once Harry’d made his proposition.
poor nerves?” he said in a matronly voice, teasing. Fleur’s light laugh joined his chuckle, but Molly shot him a scowl and took the chair Arthur pulled up behind her.
“Oh, Godric,” Harry exclaimed behind him before promptly bursting into a fresh bout of laughter. “I think I split my jeans.”
He was just putting the final touches on the couple’s tray when a deep, soft voice spoke close to his ear.
Harry wouldn’t have minded going with him, just to be able to be there, experiencing the special moment between the little boy and his idol first hand. He’d wanted to listen in on their conversation, already knowing how much he would love Teddy’s precocious demeanour and not wanting to miss out on a single second of it.
“Well, I’ll let you get back to work.” George grabbed Draco and gave him a loud kiss on the cheek before heading out of the room. When he got to the door, he stopped and turned, mirth twinkling in his eyes. “If you’re younger than me and marry my older brother, does that make you my kid brother or another big brother?”
Clothes were strewn all over the floor as they made for the bed, the buttons of Harry’s dress shirt flying in every direction once Draco got too impatient in his quest for naked skin. Draco didn’t stop as Harry’s calves hit the bed frame, instead crowding Harry until he fell backwards onto the dark blue bedspread. Harry scooted up to rest against the pillows and Draco followed him, straddling his legs and taking in the sight of the man sprawled out underneath him.
The words were casual, almost flippant, but there was no denying the strain in his voice. Draco wished he could determine the cause of his unease, because if…
Draco was almost certain he didn’t imagine the choking sound coming from the other end of the line. “Oh, don’t mind Janie. She always has all sorts of strange ideas.”
With no means of resistance, Harry is helplessly drawn into the enchanting whirlwind that is Draco Malfoy, spellbound by the man who’s been intriguing him like no other for over a decade.
“Wait,” I call back, scowling at a can of tomato soup before I abandon the kitchen and trudge across the flat towards your room. “How many times have I told you not to—”
"What they think they see is an illusion," Harry says, wrapping his arms around Draco's warm torso in an attempt to stave off the cold night air. He hasn't noticed it much before, but now that the arousal is gone, he is thankful for the heat Draco always seems to emanate. Harry tilts his head up to meet Draco's gaze. "I see you."
Harry nodded, then opened his mouth to speak, closed it again to think, and then finally said, “I think there’s a lot of context necessary to understand them, but I’m not sure where to start,” he admitted.
Hermione broke Harry’s focus when she hit him gently on the shoulder and looked pointedly at the front of the room. Harry looked up to see he had missed the rest of the sorting while he was staring at Malfoy, and McGonagall was addressing the hall before dinner.
Harry walked out of his Transfigurations classroom long after everyone else had left, after being chewed out again for napping during class. He sighed and ran his fingers through his hair, resolving to ask Hermione for her notes later so he could study and maybe actually catch up this time. For now, he just wanted to go back to his room and lie down for a bit. The previous night had been a rough one, and he’d spent most of it sitting awake staring at the embers of the fire, trying not to hope that Sirius’s face would emerge in the coals like it had so many years ago. He rounded a corner and was suddenly mere centimeters from square shoulders clad in grey eighth year robes, and thin arms in a crisp black dress shirt crossed across a narrow chest. Harry nearly fell backwards in his attempt to not run into Draco Malfoy, who was towering nearly a full head over Harry and glaring directly down at him. Harry absentmindedly wondered when the git had gotten so tall as he sidestepped to walk around him, muttering, “Sorry,” and staring at his feet.
“Again, I know that this year will be different for Hogwarts, but I hope that you will all find it within yourselves to embrace unity and forgiveness, and we may move forward with our lives in this more peaceful time.” Her eyes swept over the room, and the silence was heavy with the weight of her gaze. Harry glanced back over to the Slytherin table, where Malfoy was still facing his book, but clearly not looking at it, listening intently to McGonnagall’s speech. After a pause, she continued. “There is much to make up for, and there is much to forgive. We all played a part in this war, and we must make peace with the decisions we made, and the decisions that others made as well. This is not an easy task I am asking of you, but I find that I trust that all of you will be able to accomplish this.” She paused and gave a knowing smirk at the audience of students. “Now, enough of all that. Let’s eat!” She twirled around towards the head table with a flourish of her robes, and the empty platters and bowls on all the tables filled at once. Gasps echoed through the hall from the surprised first-years, and the Hall filled at once with noise.
“I’ve been hearing that from a lot of people today! Seems like classes are keeping everyone busy, yes?” She said conversationally, rifling through her papers.
Harry put down the notice and picked up the smaller sheet of paper that had slipped out and groaned when he read it.
“Yes,” Hermione said, nodding slightly. “And we have a chance to finish our NEWTS, go on to normal jobs and normal lives now. We’ve earned that, at least. It’s a fresh start, and a chance to remember this place for the good.”
Hermione put a comforting hand on his back. “Harry, we’ve talked about this before. I know it’s not going to be easy, but you’ll have more options if you take your NEWTS. And besides, don’t you think you deserve some peacefulness after the war? Instead of going right into Auror training and all the stress and the danger that comes with?”
Harry thought for a moment, and then shook his head. “I’ve told bits and pieces to people, parts that were necessary, but not everything.”
Class was not much better. Harry was unsurprised that Malfoy was in his class, considering he had also missed all of the previous year of school. Though Malfoy was exceptionally quiet and seemed intent on disappearing into his chair, Harry couldn’t concentrate. He was scolded more than once for staring out a window, and once when there was a loud explosion from an errant spell he leapt to his feet again, brandishing his wand and knocking his chair over before shamefully picking it up to sit back down, almost everyone in the class, the professor included, staring at him with alarm. The only person who didn’t look up was Malfoy, still studiously flipping through the pages of his textbook and practicing his wand movements as if nothing was happening at all.
When the door to the little office opened, Harry nearly jumped out of his seat. A surprisingly young, petite woman with dark skin and short hair walked out, and smiled warmly at Harry when she saw him sitting at the little table.
Harry watched helplessly as Malfoy strode past him, still pointedly avoiding eye contact. He had gone a bit red and blotchy in the face like he had been when he had offered Harry the truce, but he walked with his back straight and shoulders back, the reddening of his face the only sign of discomfort or any emotion at all that he showed. He retreated around the corner, with no flourish of robes this time, but the click of his shoes echoing along the corridor.
Harry wanted to protest. He’d heard that Magical Healing for mental health sometimes included Legilimency, and it made him more nervous than he wanted to admit. He looked at Ron for support, but he offered no more than an apologetic shrug that said, ‘She’s right, you know,’ so Harry went back to dejectedly eating his oatmeal.
Harry curiously walked over to the door he thought was the right one, which came up to be just above his knee. He crouched down and tried the knob, but the door didn’t budge, as he expected. So he felt along the stones around the door until he felt one with a slightly smoother texture than the others, and he pressed his palm hard onto the surface of the stone. Sure enough, the latch on the little door popped open, and when Harry crouched down and looked through, the room beyond was still there, dusty and small with miniature windows to match the miniature door, just like it had been when he and Ron had found it their second year. Something on the floor caught Harry’s eye, and he reached out to pick up a pair of bird shaped earrings. They were extremely dusty, but they still perked up enough when Harry picked them up to peck at him and ruffle their little bronze feathers.
“You’re right,” Harry said, breaking the silence. Ron nodded once. “You know, I thought when he was dead everything would be happy. Like it was the first few months I was here, before we knew about Quirrell.”
“Yes, I have been,” he admitted. Ron glanced up at him, then back down at his parchment, and began pressing the tip of his quill into his thumb the way he did when he was nervous or thinking hard. “I just, I -  ugh,” Harry continued, and then stopped again, at a loss for the right words. Ron waited patiently, still fiddling with his quill. “It’s been different, since we’ve been back at the castle. The last time I was here, I- I died, and so did a lot of people I cared about, and now being back has been… difficult. I mean, earlier today I was sitting in the common room and I moved chairs because I had my back to a window. I felt ridiculous, but I just couldn’t get it out of my head that I was in danger. That’s stupid, right? For all the nightmares and the paranoia to come back, there’s no reason for it, we figured all that out at the Burrow, and now it’s back and I don’t know why.” Harry stopped, feeling hopeless and suddenly very tired.
The Great Hall was bustling with activity, and the trio took seats next to Neville, who greeted them warmly. Hermione put a bowl of oatmeal in front of Harry before he could protest, and Ron passed him a honey jar, looking sympathetic.
Classes began the following day. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were all taking a full seventh-year course load, since they had missed the entirety of the previous year during the war. Some others who had been present at Hogwarts during the war were also retaking the entirety of seventh-year, since their occupation with Dumbledore's Army meant they had missed most of their classes, and many of the classes they did go to didn’t meet any of the standards for what they would need to know to pass their NEWTS.
Hermione tapped her letter on the table. “That’s probably not a bad thing,” she said. “Lots of people meet with Healers for therapy, and most of them haven’t been through half of what you’ve been through.”
“You’ve been awful jumpy,” Ron said. He was tapping his quill against his parchment and avoiding eye contact.
It was late on a Saturday afternoon that Harry finally decided to give in to his restless energy and go about doing some proper wandering. Ron and Hermione were having a date night, and Harry had been forced to agree that though the trio was largely inseparable, he could not always play the third wheel. Neville was in the greenhouse and likely would be there long past dark and Seamus and Dean were… well, Harry felt he would have been a third wheel for whatever they were up to that afternoon too. Ginny was not an option, not since they had broken up, and that left very few people that Harry could turn to for company, and none he particularly wanted to hang out with at that moment. He thought that the person he really wanted to see most was Luna, but she was not a person who was easily found.
Harry leaned back, tossing the note on the table. “McGonagall is requiring me to schedule at least three appointments with Madam Batra,” he said.
So it was with sweaty palms and a lot of dallying and Hermione’s firm insistence that he finally arrived at the Hospital Wing and was pointed by Madam Pomfrey to a small room in the very back of the wing, with a new table set outside of it with a few chairs to act as a waiting area. Harry sat at the very edge of one of the chairs, wiping his palms on his pants, trying not to look as nervous as he felt. Even with all his protesting and procrastination he was still there a few minutes early, and he waited anxiously for the seconds to pass while gazing out the window and trying to focus on anything other than the rhythm of his heart, which was beating too hard.
“Yes,” Madam Batra said, her easy smile returning. “I am muggle-born, and my mother is a psychologist. I have always found that both the muggle and wizarding worlds have very different, but equally valuable methodologies and studies. It simply made sense to me to study both as a witch, and as a muggle.”
“Aha!” Harry said quietly aloud, joyful both in that he had found the door and that yet another familiar hiding place was still intact. He thrust open the door, and immediately froze, one hand on the door handle and the other instinctively reaching for his wand in his pocket.
“Yeah, I’m fine, I just…” Harry paused, trying to figure out what to say, and his friends waited patiently. “I’m just wondering if I should have come back here. It’s been so long, and everything feels so strange now. It’s almost weirder seeing it all looking the same, like everyone’s forgotten. Maybe I should have taken that offer to go right to Auror training.”
As Harry put away his Charms textbook and the homework he had been actively not doing for the past several hours, he wondered what Luna would say about his restlessness and inability to find routine. Generally, when he was experiencing something he couldn’t understand, Luna would pop up to offer some wisdom which in the moment seemed strange, but would eventually prove to be incredibly accurate. He tried to think of what advice she might have for him as he left the common room and began to wander, taking turns at random intervals down hallways and purposefully choosing pathways and corridors that he did not normally frequent. He had the Marauder's Map in his pocket to help him find his way back if he truly got lost, but deliberately did not take it out now, choosing instead to go wherever his whims took him. The corridors wound about and took him to far corners of the castle, to places he had never been and places he hadn’t been for many years. For the first time in a long time, Harry really looked at the castle. He took in the scars from the battle, but also the castle itself. He marvelled at the enormity of the building, the way its interior made little sense and yet became welcoming and easily navigable for the new students. He remembered the way that he had felt as a first year; first nervous and afraid of the task of learning all the ins and outs of such an odd building, and then joyful in finding that the castle, in its own way, welcomed him, and helped him find the places he needed.
“What?” he says as Malfoy’s scrutinising gaze travels over his attire. “I spent twenty minutes trying to figure out what to wear. This is the best I can do.”
Harry hesitated then returned, “See you, Draco,” his soft voice smooth as melted chocolate as it travelled down Draco’s spine.
The demand shoots through Harry's groin, and in an instant, he goes harder than he's ever been before, his jeans painfully tight over his erection. Still, he ignores it and presses his hand to Draco's covered cock. He's felt it before. He's held it before, as they've gotten each other off, but he's never taken it out and examined it, never felt the weight of it on his tongue, never run it along his shadowed jaw like he wants to do now.
Draco stepped closer and leaned forwards, only stilling his movement once their shallow breaths mingled between them. Draco could feel the heat from Harry’s exhale brushing against his lips as he whispered, “Yes.”
For a moment, Draco’s eyes were drawn to the plain golden wedding band on his finger. Then he saw it; the lightning bolt scar cutting through the brow over his right eye.
"I want to try something different," Draco says after a minute, a rivulet of sweat sliding down the bridge of his nose. "Can I?"
weird. I hardly know them. I mean, I’ve been acquainted with some of them most of my life, but I didn’t
Tension seeped from his body, and Draco laid down on the bed, closing his eyes. Merlin, he was so exhausted.
He rocked his hips back to meet Harry’s thrust, only to be left whimpering in frustration as Harry rose up on all fours above him, putting far too much space between them. Draco glanced over his shoulder to find Harry staring back at him, emerald eyes dark and burning with desire.
It came out weak and breathless, the pathetic sound of it reminding Harry to muster up his resolve. He wasn’t over Draco yet, but he would be. Soon. If he could just— Harry allowed himself one last look in Draco’s direction, pouring all his yearning into it with the hope to drain the seemingly fathomless well in his heart.
going to use Legilimency on my son,” Narcissa insisted, the last words from the two before the door finally closed shut behind them.
A sticky mess of come, sweat, and lube coated both their stomachs as Draco eventually found the strength to leave Harry’s warm embrace and roll onto his back beside him. He blinked up at the ceiling and tried to focus his blurred vision, still blissed out, still panting, still struggling to rein in his racing heart.
Only, as soon as he does, Draco’s gaze flicks down, taking in Harry’s worried lip before hastily returning to Harry’s again. Harry watches as those warm, grey eyes widen in comprehension and then his heart skips a beat as Draco’s lips part around a sharp intake of breath.
Harry could feel Draco’s hot, ragged breath ghost over his hypersensitive skin, alerting him to just how close Draco’s mouth was to where he wanted it to be.
Draco pulled his knees closer, hugging them tight to his chest. “My parents will survive. I bet they won’t miss me at all.”
of our generation. For Godric’s sake, M, you’re not a bloody slave to your later-than-late ancestors. I say, fuck them. If you don’t want to
“Sorry,” she said quietly and leaned forward, giving him a little hug. “I shouldn’t have said that. If there’s anything you need me to do, let me know.”
That had Draco finally jerk away from the masterpiece, his eyes turning to Harry’s in a heartbeat. The rich green that met him suddenly made Draco think of resplendent glass.
Draco closes his eyes, but the corner of his mouth twitches into a small smile on one side. “When I realised my magic was reaching out for you, that
A Summoning Charm would probably have been easiest, but Draco’s hands still trembled too much for him to trust his aim. Instead, he crawled over to the escritoire on all fours, laying down flat on his stomach to peer into the darkness.
Arthur cleared his throat. “Do you suppose one of us should, er…check? Just to make sure it’s there? You know, for Harry’s sake?”
“We are,” he murmurs next to Draco’s ear, increasing the pressure of his grinding against Draco’s rapidly swelling cock. “Just getting us ready now.”
Draco’s blood chilled, but Sirius stood and slapped Draco cheerfully on the back as though he’d not delivered an implied threat just seconds before. “Come on. They’re waiting for us at the Burrow.”
“No reason. I like it. It suits you; makes your eyes look…nice.” Harry swallowed, and Draco’s gaze went straight to his bobbing Adam’s apple.  “Although, I must admit I’ve never considered a purple coat on a man before.”
Moments later, Draco sat down with his subpar hospital tea and gathered his courage. “Sirius,” he started, his nerves bubbling in his stomach, “I have to tell you something.” He met the man’s silvery eyes, so like his own.
A crowd of people walking by stopped at that and Draco glared at them, making them hurry on towards the marquee.
“Wow, I had no idea.” Draco could feel Harry’s curious eyes on him, but he kept his gaze on the coin, trying not to gauge Harry’s reaction to what was inevitably coming. “Where did you get it from?”
Harry smiles at the reminder of their little ray of sunshine — his godson and Draco’s cousin — as he retrieves the milk from the fridge and places it on the counter next to their mugs. His body moves on pure routine, his thoughts wandering as he opens the cupboard and takes out the purple tin tea caddy Harry bought Draco for his birthday. It had come with the ridiculously expensive special blend of loose leaf Draco always insists on drinking, and as Harry takes a peek inside, he makes a mental note of replenishing it before the end of the week.
This close, Harry can see delicate spines of silver threading through the pale feathers, reflecting the light. He slowly extends his arm, giving Draco time to pull away before he bites at his lip and runs a trembling finger along one of the beautiful feathers.
Draco still hadn’t been able to rule out the possibility that the man was here on a surveillance mission, posing as an innocent Muggle college student while taking notes to report back to the Ministry. Not that he could’ve gathered much of importance from sitting there watching Draco take orders, prepare drinks, and serve up brownies, but who knew what the Ministry considered important these days? They had always taken a special interest in the strangest things. Maybe they suspected Draco of a nefarious Death Eater plot, poisoning his Muggle patrons one mocha latte at a time?
“Of course,” Draco said, deciding not to mention the preparations Pansy had made him juggle for weeks. For some reason, the dragons seemed to love the fireworks, and magical inhabitants from across the Hebridean islands gathered there on New Year’s to celebrate. It was the only time all year the reserve was fully open to visitors.
“I’m sorry, sweetheart. I just couldn’t resist.” Harry winked. “It’s not often I get to see you this confused, but I’ll be a good sport now, I promise. Let me explain?”
“Sicilian lemon, like you recommended.” His spoon is already in his hand, hovering over his yellow ball of heaven, and I rush to mirror him, touched by the notion of him waiting for me before he digs in. It’ll be his first time tasting granita, and if I’m honest, I’m more eager to watch him experience it than I am to enjoy my own. He smiles and his green eyes twinkle as he gestures to my bowl. “Yours is green apple, though. I tried to get them to sprinkle some parmesan on it for you, but they stubbornly refused. And here I thought the customer was always right.”
Smaug took that opportunity to run into the room, drawn out of hiding by the smell of his food, no doubt wondering why Draco hadn’t come into his room with it yet. As soon as he noticed Harry, he froze at Draco’s feet. Harry, seemingly eager for the distraction, squatted down and offered his hand for the little fox to smell.
Harry shakes his head and turns his attention to the mug in his lap, unable to meet Draco’s gaze. “There always is.”
Draco’s arms wrap around him again, warm hands moving slowly up Harry’s back, outlining his spine. Harry’s entire body is thrumming with anticipation, charged by the growing tension in the air around them. The lion in him is ready to pounce, but before Harry can set it free, he just needs to be certain.
“They’re waiting on you. The Healer is in with him now, but the family is gathered outside the room, waiting on you before they go in. You have to join them.”
Draco raised an eyebrow and chuckled. “Now that’s an idea. Maybe you could have brought down old Voldie with a calculator and a spreadsheet?”
“Only because you kept buying them for him,” Ginny added in, laughing. “You told me you did it to annoy Lily.”
I stop in the doorway, eyes immediately drawn to the swell of your arse, covered only by the tight black fabric of your low-rise boxer briefs. Below, your impossibly long legs, covered in a light dusting of golden hairs. Above, the elegant curve of your spine, your broad shoulders, and small droplets of water trickling down from the nape of your neck towards the waistline of your pants. I swallow hard, ignoring the heat pooling in my crotch.
Harry pulls back his bed curtains and steps out onto the cold stone floor. He casts a quick, low-level
“I do, Draco. Merlin knows, I do. But…” Harry sighed and leant his forehead against Draco’s, clenching his fists in Draco’s hair as he fought the urge to ravage him.
Draco shook his head. “No, not yet. But they invited me to celebrate Christmas with them tonight. Sirius is supposed to meet me here at seven, so I still have a little while to figure it out before I—”
Well, anyway, there you go; dare completed. Feel free to be proud of me at any time. I never would’ve done it if it weren’t for you.
without his twin, wrapped an arm around his sister. “It’s Charlie. Of course, he’ll be okay. He’s had worse than this, trust me. Remember that time with the fireworks?”
Harry doesn't know how he finds the courage to say it out loud, but he does. "I want to feel your wings on my bare skin. I want to hold you as you fly. I want to taste you."
Annoyed, Draco kept walking, forcing Harry to catch up. “Yes, Harry. I help to run a charity. Is that so hard to believe?”
Provided I won’t have to strangle them for spilling the beans next time I see them, I’ll make sure to give them your love. Not sure when that will be, but if not sooner, they’ll probably be here for my b-day in a few weeks.
Draco sighed and cursed the day he met Pansy Parkinson. “I’ll do it, but I am not working on New Year’s.”
Harry opened his mouth to answer, then his face turned red, and he averted his gaze. “It seemed reasonable at the time.”
Sitting up, Draco withdraws his fingers and wipes them on the towel he'd set nearby, then reaches for the Lubrication Potion. "You already cast the protection spell?"
Draco hesitated with his thumb over the send button, staring at the name he’d just typed out. It was strange, seeing it again after all this time, like a ghost from horrors past reminding him of all the wrongs and bads and evils he’d committed in a former life. The name belonged to another world, a world in which it would be quilled in ink on parchment and not made up from glowing pixels on a mobile screen. It felt wrong to use it now, and yet, Draco couldn’t quite bring himself to call the bloke by his first name either. It’d surely be too presumptuous, wouldn’t it, acting as if he had any right to first-name him like that? Too personal. Too intimate. No, this would just have to do.
Several minutes passed by as they stood there peacefully, side by side. Harry’s voice was quiet when he spoke. “Where is Draco?”
I keep the walls from falling down, but their foundations are shaking as I retreat to the relative safety of our kitchen.
Draco obliged, but instead of touching the mark with his hand, he leant forward and covered it with his mouth, licking and sucking it, and Harry came undone. He was fully hard now, thrusting his erection against Draco's, grasping onto Draco's wings, burying his hands in Draco's sensitive feathers, the touch only egging Draco on further.
“Thank you,” he managed to say again. His eyes burned with unshed tears, but he couldn’t look away and words began to fall from his mouth without his consent. “Harry, can you give me any reason why I shouldn’t marry Charlie? Any reason at all?” The moment they were out, he was horrified, but he needed to hear Harry’s answer.
Molly reached out her arms and pulled him into a hug. “Thank you, dear boy. I’m sure it’s wonderful.”
“Aww,” you purr, furrowing your brow in that cute, concerned way you do when you’re more than a little tipsy. In the dim light, I can almost let myself believe the fondness in your eyes is more than just a figment of my imagination. “You’re so sweet, Harry. What did I ever do to deserve you?” I roll my eyes, hoping you’ll never insist on me actually answering that question. “You sure you don’t want to dance with me?”
: I get the nagging feeling this version of Draco is indeed aware of Shakespeare's Hogwarts legacy and might have had this in mind as he crafted that first paragraph. What do you think?
“So…” Draco leaned down to suck one of Harry’s hardened nipples into his mouth, bracing himself with one hand next to Harry’s shoulder while the other reached down to —
Draco did notice those furtive glances, though. Like the man kept scrutinizing his every move, making Draco more self-aware than he’d been his entire life. Was his collar out of place? Was a lock escaping the messy bun at the nape of his neck again? Had he forgotten to put on trousers this morning? Sometimes, it felt like those bright emerald eyes were looking straight through his defences, uncovering every dark secret Draco might have wanted to keep from the world.
But I guess I should at least be grateful that we got him and not Parkinson. Most days, Ron returns from his sessions livid after having argued with her about one thing or another. It’s hard to imagine neither Susan nor Anthony ever getting a word in edgeways when the two of them are at it. Hermione, on the other hand, has got Nott in her group, and they actually seem to get on quite well. So much so that they’ve forced us all to hang out together on several occasions; Hermione, Ron, and I; and Nott, Zabini, and Parkinson. And Bulstrode, for some reason I have yet to determine.
“I used to think so, yes.” Draco returns his gaze to the ceiling and Harry watches his throat bob as the man swallows. “I used to think I’d found him once, but…”
“Draco, please?” The plea in her voice was genuine, and he hated her for it, just a little bit. “I’d do it myself, but my mother would murder me. I just need someone to be there. There’ll be three keepers on duty and I only need someone there in case there’s an emergency. Ernie will be back by late afternoon, then I’ll join you for drinks and movies after. Promise.”
No, he really could have done without all the suspicious glances, but at least they were a step up from the hateful slurs and foul hexes he’d had to endure before he’d turned his back on this world all those years ago.
“Good morning,” Harry murmured and watched Draco’s mouth curve into a content smile. He really, really didn’t want to leave the bed, but… “I have to—”
"Is Kingsley still bugging you too? Or just Hermione?" Draco asked casually as if Harry would give him a different answer than he had every other time they'd talked about it.
Molly’s voice was closer now, but still quiet. “Yes, that’s Draco. I haven’t had a chance to tell you about him yet, but he’s Charlie’s fiancé.”
It’s always the same with them: Hermione, ever the analytical researcher, is quick to look at the situation objectively, trying her best to understand and asking a hundred and one questions on her way. Once presented with enough facts and relevant arguments, she usually has no trouble accepting the truth and starts trying to make the best of it. Ron, on the other hand, is all feelings and action, quick to judge and stubborn as all hell. Once he’s drawn his rash conclusions, right or wrong, he’s hard to convince otherwise. Plus, he can hold a grudge like no other.
Tonight, though, his book still lay next to him on the side table, silver-rimmed reading glasses on top, flanked by an untouched cup of tea. He was in no state to concentrate anyway, thoughts running in every direction as the clock counted down towards the inevitable.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy,” Harry began formally, his voice soft but determined. “I love you. I’m so sorry that I didn’t say anything sooner, and—”
Knowing Lucius, the prideful head of the Malfoy family is probably a lost cause at the moment, but Harry still holds out hope for Narcissa. He’s witnessed the love she harbours for her son, and if it was strong enough to make her lie Voldemort straight to his face, Harry figures she’d be capable of doing almost anything for him.
Malfoy sighs and shakes his head, exasperated. “It’s loud,” he says, raising one long, slender finger as he starts ticking off his mental list, “which doesn’t encourage conversation. The lighting is much too bright for anyone to feel attractive. The vegetables were overcooked, the waitress is a walking perfume factory, and this table is unbalanced. Want me to go on?”
