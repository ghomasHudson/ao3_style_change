I apologize if there are any format errors. I’m uploading this on mobile because my computer isn’t working. I’ve already had stuff crash before and lost a lot so I wanted to get what I already have written posted in case my files get corrupted again. Hope you like it!
“Then why are you being nice to me?” Malfoy was still smiling as he asked, his voice gushing with genuine bewilderment. “That isn’t exactly normal behavior for us.”
In all honesty, he had considered skipping a night, just to give them a break from one another. That was the real reason he had dressed in muggle clothes; he had been halfway to his usual pub when he turned on his heel and went back the other way. He couldn't tell Malfoy that, though. He didn't want to worry him.
Harry didn’t relax. His eyes narrowed as he scrutinized the man. Terry went on, “Look, I wasn’t in the best state of mind six months ago. My father had just passed away and it brought back a bunch of old memories. It doesn’t excuse what I did but I’ve been working on it. That counseling actually helped. I’m still going actually, even though it’s not mandatory anymore.”
. When did he start calling him that? The thought crossed Harry’s mind as he sorted his things to get ready to leave work.
The next morning, Draco woke up to find the spot beside him empty. He wasn't surprised, but he was disappointed. The bed felt unnaturally cold when he was alone.
With his desk marginally cleared off, he left the classroom. He started towards his chambers to drop off his things before going to the final feast but his feet slowed at the same spot they always did. He paused then looked up at the fifty or so names carved into the wall beneath the words BATTLE OF HOGWARTS MEMORIAL. There were too many to have a portrait of each but several people had their portraits littered around the castle.
It appeared the intended effect Malfoy had hoped for had backfired entirely and was now hitting him tenfold. His whole face became scarlet, contrasting grandly with his white hair. It was a better reaction than Harry had ever gotten from seven years of insults.
With a swipe of his wand, the door opened. Laughing hit his ears the moment he entered. A small girl too young for Hogwarts came whizzing down the stairs, a boy who was just a bit older right behind her.
"No such thing," Harry grunted bitterly. "Just ones that were too slippery to catch the first time."
It was only on nights like this that Harry had any problem with Ron and Hermione’s relationship. Ron couldn’t make his nightmares go away but at least at the Burrow, Harry could look over and confirm he was still alive despite just having a dream of him dying horrendously. It was also calming to hear another person breathing, a steady pattern he could attempt to match. The best, but also the worst, nights were when they both woke up and could talk about it. It seemed that the only time Harry could ever talk about any of it was when his friend’s face was shrouded in shadow and their eyes wouldn’t have a chance of meeting.
Harry eyes widened. His gaze darted around the room. “Right now?” He was only in joggers and in a horrible state at that. If that prim woman apparated into the room right now, Harry was screwed.
“No more than London, and the weather is lovely. The summer especially, not a cloud in the sky, cool nights and just the right amount of heat in the day.” Seeing that the weather conditions weren’t going to persuade Draco anytime soon, she quickly changed tact. “Lorena has plenty of room. She keeps asking about you. She says she rather have you live with us than have to constantly listen to me worry.”
“Ouch, that bruise isn’t looking so good,” voiced Ron, eyeing the purpling spot on Harry’s cheek. “Carson got you good, mate. You sure you don’t want to go to the infirmary?”
“Please,” Zabini pressed, his expression enduring. His eyes only broke from Harry’s when Hermione sat up straight with clear intent to listen. “Alone.”
For a moment, he considered ignoring the topic and acting as if he hadn’t read it. That wasn’t right either. He had already told them that if they needed to talk he’d listen. He didn’t want to go back on that. Above all, he didn’t want to lose them.
Malfoy pulled himself up straighter and dropped his legs down, replacing his knees with his crossed arms as if wanting to look more mature. “Why is that so preposterous to you? There aren’t many people who would fancy a game with an ex-Death Eater. Too afraid I’ll curse their broom, I suppose. Or they much rather throw me through the goalposts.”
Harry’s fingers slowly followed the twisting shape of the mark, knowing it by heart even as the image dimmed. A cool tingle ran up Malfoy’s arm and shot down his spine in a shiver. His eyes had fallen closed, never quite able to fully look at the mark on his arm.
"Sorry," Malfoy muttered. He didn't put his hand back on Harry's face, and Harry found himself oddly disappointed.
He collected his papers and what little things couldn’t stay there all summer. He’d leave the confiscated Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes products for the house-elves to take care of. They were becoming very good at knowing how to disarm many of the jinxes and surprise traps that kept adults away – Harry was certain George was adding more just for Harry’s sake.
“No! Anyone who helps me gets hurt!” he snapped. “My parents, Sirius, Moody, Snape, they all tried to help me and look what happened to them. Until I was eleven, I was alone, and I dealt with my own crap, and no one got hurt.”
He knew the answer. It was confirmed by the fall of Ron’s face. He didn’t need to hear the words. “She’s not sure if she’s coming. She has a big game this week that she’s practicing for.”
Andromeda laughed at the long sigh that left the man’s lips. “Yes, I have a few upstairs. I’ll show you.”
Suddenly, Harry deeply regretted sending Draco away. He could feel the dread already beginning to claw at his chest. What had he just done?
Harry let out an exaggerated groan, dragging his feet towards the door. It was clearly a sarcastic gesture and one that made Malfoy chuckle.
Harry took one of his hands from the back of the chair, smoothing a circle into the back of his palm. “I don’t care.”
"Why are you tying me up?" Malfoy snarled, struggling in his restraints. "This is my house! He's the one attacking me!"
“It doesn’t matter, we won’t be here,” Harry declared. He’d thought about this on his way up. They couldn’t stay. Harry wouldn’t be able to find who did this from the flat and he wasn’t going to leave Draco alone, no matter how well he could handle himself. “We’re going to Grimmauld.”
Malfoy frowned at him. His eyes began to flick over his face, analyzing every feature for some tell of a lie. When he came up empty, more aggravation scrunched Malfoy’s face. He crossed his arms tightly over his chest. “What do you really want from me, Potter?”
They made it up the stairs and out of sight. It was a little tricky getting to their room, Harry’s heart hammering and yearning for him to spin around and kiss Draco again. However, he managed to get through the door and close it.
“Wow, you’re a miracle worker, Malfoy,” Hermione peeped up as she looked down at the E on Harry’s latest Potion’s essay. “Do you think you could help Ron, too?”
“That piece of shit,” Ron snarled. He was shaking. His fists clenched. “Of course, he was the second person.” They should have arrested him that day at his flat. He should have never been exonerated. Once a Death Eater, always a Death Eater.
“He’s trying to say something,” Hermione squeaked happily. They all leaned in closer, Hermione dropping down to nearly rest her ear against his chest. “It’s okay, Harry. You’re safe.”
The urge to argue was there, but Harry snapped his lips shut. They had just mended one disagreement. He didn’t want to start another.
“Ah,” he glanced at the clock over the door, “he should be down soon to trade off with me.” He gestured to the old settee shoved against the wall. “You’re welcome to wait, Mr. Potter.”
Harry blinked rapidly. A meeting. What meeting was going on right now? Then, for a moment, he remembered where he actually was. He was lightheaded from his heavy breath, but he knew he needed to get out of there.
Harry wasn’t just complementing Malfoy and relishing in his fluster; he was now touching him a lot more, and of this sort of scheme, Malfoy never said a word. He even stopped complaining when Harry touched his hair, granted it was less of the furious ruffle as it had been before and now more of a fond pat or mild toying. It wasn’t one-sided now either.
Malfoy's heart skipped a beat. It couldn't be. He ran to the door, putting his eye to the peephole to see the distorted face of Harry Potter, himself.
“A tad.” Harry shrugged. “It doesn’t bother me. He did what he had to in order to save everyone. It’s not as if he was making me do something that he wouldn’t,” he glanced carefully at the boy beside him, “after all, he did the same.”
Harry sat up, facing Malfoy fully now. He waited for something else to come, but it never did. The quiet might have coaxed him to share, but it wasn’t going to get everything out of him at once.
He wasn’t even in the room yet before Lucas attempted to tear off past him, Maggie on his tail. Harry caught them both in his arms and lifted them off the ground half an inch, causing them both to fill with giggles. “Time for lunch guys, head downstairs.”
Teddy obeyed and waddled over to her, nearly dropping his cake on the floor as he moved. She twisted in her chair and took his face in her hands to wipe the frosting off his lips, mumbling about how much he was like his mother. When she finished, she slid a glance up at Ron as if to declare her innocence. He rolled his eyes but turned away nonetheless.
Malfoy hadn’t been there when he’d woken up which was a little confusing. He hadn’t told him he had to be out before dawn or anything of the sort. Maybe Malfoy just didn’t sleep in late. He had at least stopped avoiding his eye all together in Transfiguration and he’d accepted the extra quill Harry had offered when he looked at a loss for his own. Ron and Hermione had given him odd looks again but had yet to comment.
After a little more incoherent mumbling, picking up bottles, then putting them back, he finally pulled one out and appeared satisfied.
Harry narrowed his eyes. His thoughts instantly jumped to a conspiracy. “He didn’t know that this morning.”
Harry went to answer but he paused as he looked at Hermione and Audrey. He wanted to tell them all, especially Hermione, but he considered that he should likely discuss it with his partner first. “Come in side with me?”
Draco helped Harry hobble to the sofa, easing him down and placing a blanket over his lap with sarcastic care. Harry swatted him away, fighting the urge to smile again.
"Well, nice to meet you both, Harry, Drake. And thank you," she added to Harry. "Enjoy your coffee."
He nodded but was still visibly distracted. “Yes but this place is a mess. We have to get it cleaned up before she gets here.”
Upon returning to Hogwarts, Draco had made a promise to himself that he would keep his head low and devote himself to his studies. That was his only purpose for being there after all. And he had kept this promise for nearly a month. So much so that he rarely left the library and he was already beginning to read ahead of lesson plans.
There was a bright laugh behind them, and they turned to see the Patil twins with handfuls of fallen leaves that they were attempting to pelt each other’s hair with. Neville had somehow gotten in the middle, and they were soon burying him in arm fulls of leaves, Hannah standing out of the way giggling as she watched.
“You’re not very discreet, you know,” Draco scolded that evening. “He’s already backed off. He doesn’t care what happens to me now.”
Harry’s voice was low and coarse, almost sounding how he did when he first woke up. “Not everything is your fault.” Draco’s face pinched. “But you’re only letting
Ron made a face. “I think I’d need to be committed if I found out he was leaving his toothbrush at her house.” She could still feel the pull of concern in her chest. Nonetheless, she found herself chuckling at his words.
Harry picked up his arm through the covers. Draco didn’t pull away. He only watched as Harry brought his arm up to his mouth and planted a kiss to the center of the mark. He pulled away, lacing their fingers together before dropping their hands between them again. “Then we’ll only tell the important people and deal with the rest later.”
Something about Malfoy’s expression changed, but Harry couldn’t identify it, only that it felt like he had said something revealing. “You…like me?”
He entered what was once the formal dining room. It was now a sitting room with plush chairs and sofa to greet anyone looking to adopt. The original china cabinet remained but it now stored the children’s accolades such as quidditch or academic awards.
Harry sat back in his chair. He raised a brow. “Why?” He didn’t remember any holidays coming up. It was only July. Ginny’s team was doing great so it wasn’t the end of the season yet.
Harry sighed, dropping his arms. “No, I’m sorry. You’re right.” The Weasley children shared looks in the kitchen. “Well, are you coming or not?”
“Yes,” Malfoy answered for them. When Harry looked at him quizzically, Malfoy patted at Harry’s Auror robes and said, “You’re in no shape to get dinner, and I’m not leaving you alone.”
She sat up, releasing his hand instantly. “Already? They said they just cleared you. We were waiting outside before they even allowed visitors in. I never saw... How could…”
Harry shook his head, trying to turn his work brain back on. "It pays," Harry prodded. When this didn't look like incentive enough, he continued. "And it means I get to talk to you about work, so you can help me. And it might help sway a few people's opinions of you within the Auror's Office."
The morning sun broke through the thin cloud cover and diaphanous curtains into the kitchen. A light drizzle of rain pattered the broad windows, setting a lazy mood for the day. Draco stood at the counter, avidly at work on a batch of fried eggs and toast. Everyone loved his cooking nowadays, and this was their favorite dish – of course it was the only dish he could make but nonetheless.
He only took a step forward before Andromeda side-stepped into his path. “I don’t think that’s a good idea, Harry.”
Harry attempted another smile, this one wider but appearing just as painful. “I know.” He made a pathetic attempt at stretching his arm to reach the other man. Draco sighed and moved closer until Harry was able to touch his wrist. He pinched Draco’s sleeve, using only the tips of his fingers to play with the frayed ends of the sweater that resulted from Draco’s constant picking.
Draco looked away from the tables and took a mental measure of the large stain-glass windows. The sun had finally dipped past the horizon, the last few gold hues of the day drenching the glass. He had at least another hour before the library closed.
“I can’t help but stop when I pass here too,” a voice spoke up. It was Neville. He had a sad smile as he joined Harry in front of the memorial. “Seven years… Do you think it’s ever going to stop hurting?”
"The Auror Office is still open. I'm technically not on shift, but I can't skive off tomorrow," Harry said. "Dark wizards don't sleep."
Harry knew the answer to that was yes. Draco never brought it up, so he never told him, hoping he’d forget the whole thing. He had a feeling he hadn’t but that he wasn’t surprised that Skeres hadn’t gotten a severe punishment ― more mandatory counseling, and he’d keep the tracker on his wand for a year. It was a joke.
Draco pursed his lips. “Visiting my mother in Versailles isn’t traveling. We could visit Paris for a day or two but that’s no way experience it for the first time. You’ll need more than a week to do it properly.” He pulled gently on Harry’s roots. “I’m sure Saint Potter could get more time though.”
Ron’s look hardened. When nothing seemed to click, he glanced once towards the pair they’d left at the table near the dartboard. “You and the ferret,” he said in a low rush when Harry still refused to catch on.
Laughter shook through Harry’s whole body as he finally stepped away. Draco glared but he couldn’t say he was genuinely upset. Harry knew that. Lorena hadn’t been wrong in her statement earlier. Harry and Draco had spent all of autumn following the Mediterranean coast, each day getting to know one another’s likes and dislikes just a little better. It wasn’t just their physical interests that they discovered though.
“He doesn’t want anything to do with me anymore, though. When it looked like the Dark Lord would win, and the Malfoys would be at the top, he was more than happy to be seen with me. That was until we were painted as public enemy number one from every corner. Now, who would want anything to do with the Malfoy name? Who would voluntarily be a social pariah?”
Instinct said to restrain Malfoy first. Auror training noted that Skeres was the current hostile threat and should be the one that was contained first. Harry's throbbing head refused to let him make a decision, so Ron made it for him. He threw a body-bind curse at Skeres first before tossing a rope tying jinx around Malfoy.
“No, Harry, you’re not.” She urged, her eyes following him as he began to pace, trying to keep his face hidden from her as much as possible. “You’ve never been fine. You’ve been fighting evil since you were one-years-old. Of course, you’re not fine. We just want you to admit it and let us help you.”
Draco yanked his hand away. “What? No! That’s stupid.” He started to get to his feet again. “Why would I think that?”
Harry only chuckled as he sat back. He left one hand on his knee as if not entirely able to keep that far away.
"I'm aware, Potter," Robards said. "I was one of the jury members who voted in his favor." His voice was low and even but lethal, and it sent a shiver down Harry's spine, making him realize his mistake.
“Then I’ll do what I can to make you believe me.” A sheepish smile stretched across Harry’s face as he ran a hand through his tasseled mop. “I’ve had it pointed out to me recently that I’m not the best at sharing, so…if you ask, I’ll tell you,” he caught Draco’s eyes, “anything.”
The last letter Draco had received continued to swirl in his head for most of the week. They’d talked about many sensitive topics but something about those words struck him strange. It nearly sounded like something Dumbledore would say at one of their school feasts.
He also didn’t want to admit that there was a point that he hoped they lost because a Dementor’s kiss sounded better than what might happen if they won. The guilt of it all felt like a million bricks on his chest. At least a Dementor would be able to take the pain away along with everything else.
Seeing Harry's apprehensive look, Malfoy offered his own cup, which was pre-sweetened. "Here, just try it."
This option lightened Malfoy's face for a moment, but it fell once again. He shook his head. "That's just silly. Besides, this is a lot to carry on your own."
The tension in his body eased hearing the faint plea in her tone. “It’s okay,” he assured. “You guys don’t have time to take care of me, anyway. You have work.”
They got through one and a half episodes before Malfoy looked over at Harry to see his eyes drooping. He stood up. Harry’s eyes shoot open at the movement. “It’s okay,” Malfoy cooed. “Go to sleep.”
Delighted by this turn of events, they both sprung from his arms and ran towards the basement door. “Careful! No running!” he urged as he followed them down.
He followed Robards all the way to the Head Auror office. The door swung closed behind them. There was a shutter in the air as the Silencing charms which layered the room reignited with the click of the latch.
“That’s it,” praised the healer. “Did you feel that? The low vibration here,” she hovered her hand over Harry’s abdomen, “it’s internal bruising. It’s not too concerning for now, but it is painful, and it’s good to keep an eye on it.”
Hermione placed their orders over the phone while Ron changed into muggle clothes. When he came out, she tossed him a wallet, and he walked out the door.
Harry squeezed again. “Hey, after all this time, you think liking blokes is going to be the thing that repels me? And I know you’re a lot of things, Draco Malfoy, but you aren’t
Harry nearly dropped Teddy. He and Draco looked at each other with wide eyes and then down at the child between them. He really did look like their child right now.
The shock rolled back and was once again diluted by the liquor. Harry rolled his eyes. “Fine then.” He took his hand away from Draco’s fiddling fingers and leaned into Hermione, who was already resting on Ron. “I don’t need you, either.”
Draco jumped to his feet. He slapped the file closed and turned his back on it as if that would be enough to convince Harry that his eyes were fooling him. "What?"
Robards assessed his sincerity for a long moment before finally giving a stiff nod. He wordlessly gestured to the chair in front of his desk.  Harry sat down.
Ron raised his hands in defense. “Hey, I didn’t mention anything gross. You’re the one thinking about gross stuff with Malfoy.”
Harry grabbed one of the cushions behind him to throw at the other man. "What is that supposed to mean?"
“I don’t know yet,” Harry wouldn’t mention Skeres, not until he was certain that’s what had happened, “but I’ll figure it out.”
Friday was not typically a night he stayed there, but Harry was not surprised when he opened the door and saw the soft splay of white hair poking out of the covers. He had gone to bed too early; he wouldn’t have wanted to chance Zabini being awake.
Sorry I suddenly stopped updating. I was writing a chapter nearly daily and I got a little burnt out. I also started reading a beautiful Drarry fic called Running On Air and I lost all sense of responsibility so I could finish it. Anyways, this super long update should hopefully make up for it.
Surprisingly, the invitation hadn’t been one Harry had thought of before. He never assumed he had to give one. Everyone else in their Common Room had just started appearing at the end of Gryffindor table, and no one thought to tell them to go away.
It wasn’t as fluid as Harry’s efforts, but the Aurors often had to apparate all over Britain ― it was the one thing he had a real reason to better at than Draco. Despite such little use, they stumbled into the kitchen of the flat and found neither of their persons splinched. All in all, he did well, and Harry told him as much.
Harry didn’t look up, now using his wand to heat up the brew. He shook his head. “Not until this damn camomile kicks in, and it never puts me all the way to sleep.”
The frown was instant at hearing the name, but it didn’t last as long as usual. “I suppose you have a point.”
Draco brought his gaze back to her and gave a nod though his eyes were still cloudy with his previous thoughts. With that, she turned away and snapped into thin air.
A gentle smile curved her lips, but Draco swore he spotted something glittering in her pale eyes. “Not at all. They are quite real. Everyone knows it.”
Zabini rolled his eyes. “I won’t hurt the savior, Weasley. Honestly, you trust him with a former Death Eater and not with someone who had nothing to do with that lot.”
Malfoy stared at him curiously for a long second as if he didn't understand what Harry was saying. Finally, a smirk crawled onto his lips. He took Harry's hand, allowing him to help him to his feet. "You wish."
He nodded. “We go to a cafe every Saturday and I occasionally go along to the shop, and Harry is a decent cook. I’m okay.”
A beat of heavy silence coated the room. Even George and Angelina had paused in the other room out of sight.
Malfoy began to reach out but stopped just short of Harry’s arm, looking up to the other man’s face. “Can I?”
Draco gave a mediocre shrug, his eyes lingering on the steaming drink between his hands. “She considered us living together sufficient enough.”
Harry rolled his eyes but listened as Malfoy’s steps continued up the stairs. He could almost faintly hear his muffled steps overhead until it faded into the popping sound of the fireplace.
Harry’s muscles relaxed. It felt like the easiest question to ever be asked, yet he knew what weight was behind it. “Yes.”
"And is this knowledge just bred into purebloods, or is there some special etiquette school you all go to on the weekends?"
Just as they reached the second floor landing, the subject of Harry’s contemplations appeared and he was not alone.
“He always told me that everything Dudley was saying was a lie,” continued Harry. “I wasn’t a waste of space or useless or ugly. I was good. As long as I was nice to people, then I was good.”
“Carrow?” Ron repeated. His eyes darted between the three Auror’s in the room. Had he missed something while he was gone?
Harry inched closer, one tentative hand reaching out. Malfoy might have noted that he was not using his wand if his fear had not gagged him into silence. He might have started shaking had he not feared movement.
Harry crossed his arms, his lips pursed. He nodded towards the kitchen. “You okay with this?” He was referring to eating with everyone.
George nodded as he dropped into the chair of the used desk. “Angelina has been a lifesaver.” He gestured to the seat beside him, the only thing that was a part of the other setup that had been recently moved.
“You don’t need to,” he assured before she could go off. “I’ll be fine. Go make yourself some tea, relax.”
Nevertheless, he felt strange trying to lie. He was so tired of lying. It never made anything better; it only made complications and led to poor decisions.
They sat down to eat. The whole time consisted of Draco being a flustered mess while Harry smugly watched, feigning ignorance.
When class started again, and there was no means of escape, Harry began to give mild compliments here and there. They ranged from comments on his work to muttering something about his appearance when he passed his table. The response was always spectacular. Harry had never before seen the suave, sophisticated Slytherin so clumsy. It was his best work yet.
Harry slowly lifted his head. Malfoy was in a ball on the ground as well, his back pushed up against the wall as he rocked back and forth. He had thrown his wand on the ground, holding his head between his knees as he looked upon Harry with wide, fearful eyes. "I didn't mean to," he said through sharp, quick breaths. "I'm sorry. I can't. I can't." He shook his head violently, continuing to rock.
Draco gaped at the child. He could feel his heart pounding in his ears. His whole face flushed. “Is…” he glanced around for any eavesdroppers but the child had enough couth to speak in decent whisper, “Is that so?”
Ron shook his head. “He’s too stubborn. He’ll wake up. He doesn’t know how to sit still for that long.”
Harry pursed his lips, trying not to smile. He handed the cup back, looking up at the ceiling to avoid Malfoy's knowing eyes. "It's good, I guess."
be in? They don't even know we…" Harry shook his head profusely, shaking off that sentence. "Why couldn't you just leave it alone-"
A tiny voice hummed in the back of his head. A different voice began to speak up, one which sounded unsettlingly like his father. It hissed things like
Molly came to the rescue before it could get out of hand. “Teddy, dear, would you like to help me add the last touches to Harry’s cake?”
Harry slowly turned his head towards Draco. For a brief second, he caught the fear in Draco’s eyes but it disappeared the moment he realized Harry was looking at him. He put his mask back on. “Oh,” was all Draco managed. He attempted to turn back to packing but all he was doing was smoothing out the blanket.
“You did what you thought was right. You saved people. You aren’t to blame for what they did afterward,” Harry urged.
“So, where are you both off to now?” Narcissa inquired. “I would think Spain would have nice whether this time of the year.” She had stopped pestering them about staying with her longer. She was coming to terms with their transient lifestyle, satisfied enough by monthly visits. Ultimately, she just pleased with seeing her son smile so much.
"No, it's to put bad wizards away," Ron said crossly. He looked absolutely done with this conversation. He was too tired to argue right now. "Terry isn't a bad wizard. He's mourning. If we put away every witch or wizard who acted out after the war, then half of the wizarding population would be in Azkaban – hell, you and I would have been there day one. You know that. Terry isn't a threat. He just needs some help."
"Sod off, git!" Harry snapped, smacking the other boy in the face with his pillow. Malfoy only blocked the hit with his arm and continued to laugh.
Harry’s moment of uncertainty was thrown away. Of course, he should have known. It was Malfoy. When did it even matter if he offended him?
“Don’t blame yourself, Harry,” Ernie Macmillan piped up. “He’s never been too good at keeping friends, has he?”
Harry’s head snapped up. He wasn’t sure whether to be delighted or feel bad that his injury almost brought Draco to tears. “They are, I think.” From the way they were flirting a few weeks ago, Harry would assume so although he couldn’t help but second guess himself. If Draco really did share his feelings than he wouldn’t be able to hold back so well, Harry was certainly struggling. “He’s worried what people will think.” He slid his eyes gaze to the crowded street, suddenly feeling very conscious of how loud they were speaking. “He thinks people will assume it’s some trick or start hating me too.”
Harry and Ron each took a pinch. Harry started towards the fireplace but Terry grabbed his arm. “Hey, can you tell Malfoy-”
Cool fingertips brushed the underside of Harry’s wrist. He looked down to watch as Malfoy’s hand wrapped around his wrist, giving him a proper anchor. The realization that his former nemesis was the one currently holding him to his senses was enough to pull him down, but he still didn’t let go.
Harry wished he could be as creative as Draco. He wished he could draw or write or do something that would describe exactly what he saw. All he knew how to do was fly and fight and move forward. He was always moving. It was not until now, not until Draco, that he had ever even considered staying still or going slow. He never thought of enjoying a moment. He never thought of enjoying being with a person. He liked being with Draco though, he loved it.
He heard clinking in the kitchen and walked out of the hallway towards the sound. Malfoy stood over the sink, cleaning up dishes. "It's okay, I just remembered that we're out of clean-" He looked over his shoulder at Harry. "Merlin's beard, Potter!"
It was only the hollering that got them to separate. It rigidly pulled them back to the present and reminded them that they weren’t alone.
Hermione released her tight grip on Harry’s shoulders so they could both look at Ron but kept one arm around his back as if he needed support. Harry rubbed her back as a silent thank you. “It’s okay, I went home voluntarily. I didn’t want to go in at all today but Draco didn’t want it to seem like it affected us.”
Harry took his warning seriously. There were several muggle cleaning supplies that ended in disaster if they were mixed, he couldn’t imagine what magical ones would do. He stopped trying to fire at Goyle and instead began throwing up shields to protect the supplies.
Draco kept shaking his head. His arms became a clear self-hug. “I don’t- I don’t deserve it,” he whimpered and Harry’s blood ran cold. “I don’t deserve you.”
"I've been living mostly on my own for three years, and I don't think Kreacher knows what spice is," Harry admitted.
The part which stood out the most to him was that they were watching. They knew what he’d done even if they didn’t know they had an effect on it happening. Like a pet being rewarded with a treat, he felt a jolt of elation at the idea. He bit his lip and picked up his pen.
He remained in the library for the rest of the afternoon, as usual, however, he didn’t get a single piece of homework done. His mind was in Wonderland, but not in the same way it used to be. He didn’t find himself in the garden Alice so desperately wanted to get to, but in the handwritten notes that were traded between its pages.
"Fine," Harry snapped. He dropped the food on the ground. "I'll leave it here and go then. Be a pompous prick as always, Malfoy."
Harry held it out again, searching Malfoy’s face for any resistance. When he saw none, he gently touched his arm. Unlike Harry, Malfoy didn’t try to hold back. He melted under Harry’s reassuring touch and threw himself forward into the other man’s arms. Harry held onto him as tightly as possible, cooing reassurance into his ear as he slowly rocked them.
She gave one more fleeting look to the VCR tapes beneath the television. “I see that.” She turned back to the boys. “A few days wouldn’t hurt, would it? Just to give your mother some comfort.”
If those words had not been a confession, then Harry was not sure what could be counted as one. Nevertheless, Draco’s brows pulled together, and he shook his head so minutely that it likely would have gone unnoticed by anyone other than Harry. “I don’t care what others think,” Draco said. “But I can’t tell what you’re thinking. Everything you just said could be a lie.”
Maybe Harry did want to touch his hair again. It had been incredibly soft. It was nothing like the slicked-up style he had worn through most of their time in school. He supposed grooming one’s self became less of a concern when Voldemort was living in your house. Who cared how you looked if everyone around you had a high chance of dying any second? Then again, he still seemed considerably concerned with his appearance. At least the war hadn’t changed everything about him.
“As long as you don’t attempt to find it,” Malfoy said offhandedly, his chortles dying out. “You and your little crew do always appear uncomfortable without a quest in sight.”
Harry straightened up when he noticed all of the odd looks around the room. “What? I’m just saying, you don’t know. It can’t be all that easy being a social pariah, people hating you without even knowing you. If I were her, I’d be trying to reach out to people I thought I could trust too.”
Harry took his hand from his hair, dropping his gaze to his fidgeting fingers. “The same thing that always happens, Dudley. This time he learned a new word: Gay.” There was a pop of sound, but Harry did not look towards it. “He got everyone to start saying it, and eventually, it scared Bradley off. I’m not even sure if any of us really understood what that word meant at the time. I just knew that I wished someone wouldn’t be scared of me, and I never wanted anyone else to feel the way I did.”
Rustling beside him got Harry’s attention. Draco moved onto his side, his brow knitted together. “If you’re goal was to make me actually interested in something Weasley had to say, then you’ve succeeded. What is it?”
The conversation went on to talk about the events of the previous year. There were many heavy parts, and Harry did not mind when Draco’s fingers began to dig into his trousers to keep from caving in on themselves, nor did he comment when he took a swig of whisky. No one was comfortable remembering the screams of the children being tortured. The Carrows were embedded deeper into everyone’s mind than Voldemort, although they appeared to equally horrify Draco.
The first week of March was quiet in the castle. It was unbearably quiet. Not even Draco would explain it when Harry asked why.
The petulant crease of Draco’s brow made it clear he wanted to argue but it was only for the sake of arguing at this point. Harry made good points. The building didn’t bother Draco all that much and it would give them both some peace of mind. Draco didn’t think he could go back to the days of dreading every sound he heard outside the door.
Harry shook his head. "She'd curse me if she ever heard me talking to him like that. I didn't mean to."
“I stopped worrying about him,” she whimpered. “He looked like he was doing better. I’m supposed to notice these things.”
“Visiting hours are almost over anyway,” Sow spoke up. “I’m afraid only family members can stay the night. Your friend needs his rest, but you’re welcome to come back first thing in the morning when visiting hours start again at eight.”
She watched as both men became considerably more at ease with no one else in the room ― more at ease than Hermione’s seen Harry in a long time. Draco perched on the cot. He said something that caused a broad smile to split across Harry’s face. Hermione couldn’t remember the last time she’d seen that smile. It made her smile, too, despite herself.
Harry was wobbling slightly now, and he didn’t notice the chill that came over Malfoy’s eyes. “Right, well, most of my friends just liked me for what I could get them. What’s the purpose of spending time together if we aren’t playing quidditch or studying?”
It was a strange juxtaposition in Harry's mind to see Malfoy in such a contemporary and very muggle setting. He was used to seeing Malfoy with castle walls or ancient, ornate furniture as the background while he stood in his sleek, traditional robes. Right now, Malfoy wore comfortable slacks and a dark green sweater. Harry was curious where he'd gone to get his hands on that - not even in his wildest dreams could he picture Malfoy in a department store rifling through hangers.
Harry went to hit him again, but Ron leaped out of the way this time. Harry glared daggers at him. “You aren’t supposed to know that!”
A crease formed on Heather's brow as she glanced back at Harry. "Well, yeah, that's just what I call you," he lied poorly. "It's short for, er, Drake."
Harry Potter was Draco’s boyfriend. Draco was glad Harry closed the door because that meant he couldn’t see Draco grinning to himself like a madman. After all of these years of pain and isolation, Draco had assumed he would never be happy again. He had completely given up on the notion of finding someone to spend his life with. He assumed that just wasn’t for people like him. Death Eaters didn’t get happy endings. No one else seemed to think he should get one and they made sure to tell him.
Instead, Malfoy’s lip pulled up into a halfhearted sneer as he hissed, “What are you looking at, Potter?”
Draco nodded slowly but there was still no emotion on his face. It drove Harry mad. “Dray,” he pressed softly. “You’re allowed to show me that you’re upset. You don’t have to hide from me.”
She shrugged. “All Abberley will say is that he has a reliable source. If what you’re saying is true, then I’m assuming you have a leak.”
“Because he’s- We’re-” What was Draco even supposed to say about them? Not only was saying they were simply friends an understatement, but Ron would have no reason to believe his words? He’d have to show him.
Malfoy made a face. "I need to stop doing that," he mumbled, making Harry chuckle. "But seriously, all you do is work?"
Harry eased a bit but he still didn’t feel quite right. Something was still off. “Then what’s wrong?”
?” Patil repeated his name in a bewildered tone as if she didn’t know it belonged to him. Her gaze on Draco became more intense.
That is assuming that was really what was going on. Maybe Draco was wholly misplaced in what he was hearing. Harry had moved away very quickly when Draco had suggested a quick snog. Draco tried to test his reactions by sitting a little closer than usual or being less careful about hand placement when they were walking, and each time Harry would get flustered and move away.
Harry gave him a shrewd look. “That’s what you said last time I told you there was a leak in the department.” He tossed the paper on the desk to punctuate his statement, too tense to feel remorse.
A chill ran over Harry. He eyed the malnourished man. "Right." He looked over at the kitchen, which was spotless other than the yellow tea tin sitting out. He wondered if there was anything at all inside that fridge. He wondered if Malfoy even knew what a refrigerator was - it had amused Ron for nearly two weeks until Hermione scolded him for leaving it open and spiking up their utility bill.
Malfoy nodded slowly, never moving his eyes. “Which is aggravating since it’s so damn drafty in here, and warming charms start to feel muggy after too long.”
His fingers were trembling when he put the book away that day. It didn’t get better when he returned Wednesday. He could feel his heart doing flips in his chest, threatening to knock him over with its nerve.
Heather sent her a sharp look that instantly quieted the women. “Yes, Dear.” She pulled her mug to her lips, sipping quietly. Draco burst out in laughter. Never before had he seen the boisterous woman so utterly whipped.
The light turned on, illuminating a mostly empty fridge except for a few bottles of beer. Harry pulled out the bottles and searched for a best-by date – they were only two months out. With a shrug, he put the bottles on the counter for later and gestured to the inside of the fridge. "Regular food goes in here." He popped open the freezer, which hissed and crackled. There were some peas and TV dinner trays there. "Anything you want frozen goes up here. It makes it last even longer." He closed both doors, then pointed at the stove then the microwave above it. "Put it in here or here to warm it back up."
Ron shook his head, turning forward again. “You can stay if you want, ‘Mione. I’m not telling you what to do,” his eyes skimmed over Draco, who was trying very hard not to meet his blazing gaze, “but I can’t be here.”
Harry had speed-walked to Park Row. Skeres couldn't have had too much time on him. When he got to the street, he didn't see anything out of the ordinary but still considered apparating into Malfoy's apartment to make sure he hadn't been too late. Just before he could make a rash decision, he spotted the familiar slim form pass the window on the third floor.
Malfoy shrugged. "My father used to say much worse to ours all of the time. I used to laugh when he did." Harry started to open his mouth, the image of Dobby's fearful eyes whenever he thought he made a mistake splitting his mind. However, his words disappeared when Malfoy went on. "I don't think I ever really thought it was funny. I just preferred that he yelled at them like that than me."
Draco stared at the words he’d had just written. Three little words. He really shouldn’t tell them. It would make it too easy to figure out who he was. They would hate him. He didn’t want this to be over yet.
Everyone prepared to object again, but Draco spoke first. “Your internal organs are bruised, and no one has any idea what spell was actually used against you. You can take off work for a little while until we know you’re okay.”
“Hm?” She gave her head a hard shake then pulled her sneer back on. “I was just silently praying to Salazar that whatever this is doesn’t poison me.”
Kreacher looked the man up and down. He recognized this behavior well enough. “Would Master like his bottle of whiskey?”
“And Ginny?” Harry wasn’t sure why he asked. Maybe it was habit. She hadn’t come to his last two birthdays nor any real event other than Christmas. Even Charlie was around more and he lived in another country.
“Harry James Potter!” Harry was satisfied by the second layer of redness which spread across Draco’s face. Making Draco flustered never got old.
He felt his wand slip into his hand. There was something he was supposed to be doing. He was supposed to be looking for something. He had to move.
“I do know I don’t want to be here when he wakes up,” Robards went on, his eyes opening but becoming very distant. “Macnair already had his next victim with him, a girl he yanked from the next muggle town over. We’re doing our best, but it doesn’t look good for her.”
Never before had Draco thought that helping someone cook could involve so much sexual tension. That night they finished eating in record time.
“I knew he was being an annoying, self-righteous Gryffindor who couldn’t help but jump on the first sorry case he saw. And, yes, Draco, you were a sorry case. I still love you, though. What I didn’t know is that you two share a bed.”
Malfoy gradually lowered himself down on the other side of the seat, keeping his wary eyes on the television. "What is it? I tried telling them to quiet down, but they didn't seem able to hear me."
It wasn't until one o'clock that Harry began to consider lunch. When a commercial began to play, he got up and went to the fridge only to come across a scarce amount of food. "Damn, we finished the leftovers."
“It’s not,” Harry spoke bluntly. When it came to matters such as this, Harry had quickly learned that it was better to not beat around the bush. Malfoys certainly knew how to ask for something without actually saying it.
“I’ve had a loose wand pointed at me enough times,” he finally said when he saw their faces begin to shift from shock to accusation.
I loved all of your comments from the last chapter.  I was smiling at my phone like an idiot all day. I hope you all enjoy this one too.
However, this comfort didn’t last. He could feel her gaze focus and begin to assess him. “How are you?” She tried to speak casually, but he could hear the concerned undertone. He didn’t miss that.
Harry nodded vigorously, deciding to go with it while he could. They both tugged on their shoes and coats then headed out the door. Though it wasn't drizzling at the moment, the overcast above warned them to bring an umbrella just in case. When they got out onto the street, they found the usual quiet of Park Row, but Malfoy began to tense up when they got to the main road. Harry instinctually looped their arms together, partly to comfort and also to keep them from getting separated on the busy pavement.
Harry had to forcefully resist opening his mouth to call for help. He knew it wasn’t real, but his body trembled nonetheless. He clutched at the front of his uniform, pressing the metal buttons into his palm, desperately hoping the cold metal would replace the ghostly memory of a limp elf body in his hands.
It was so incredibly unlike Malfoy Manor that thinking about it too hard might have given him whiplash. He wondered what his life would have been like growing up with the simple change of backdrop. To see familiar smiling faces when he walked through the hall instead of scowling portraits that never withheld their disapproval whenever they felt it. He couldn’t even fathom his mother hand making something for him, not when they had house-elves to do the sewing.
Only once the door was closed did he finally look at her to hiss, "Can't you use the front door, or possibly knock?"
There was an odd spark of discussion between Draco and Heather about muggle medical practices. Heather told him about her studies in medical school which greatly intrigued him. Harry couldn’t help but think Draco, Hermione, and Heather would be a great force to be reckoned with if they all combined their brain power.
Malfoy could feel the urge to smile but tried to fight it to keep a cool expression instead. He nodded, adding a small shrug. “If you want to.”
When Harry got to the flat, he was still thinking about his talk with Ron. As shocking as Harry and Draco’s friendship would be to his other friends, he would eventually have to tell them. If Ron kept showing up at his house, he might accidentally figure it out on his own – he had ordered Kreacher not to mention Draco to them, but there was no telling how long that would be enough.
Ron hesitated. He drummed his fingers across the table once as he collected his thoughts then he finally spoke. “You weren’t faking it with my sister, right?”
“What?” Harry frowned. He wasn’t sure why her teasing tone felt so disconcerting. “No. Actually, you guys can come, too, if you like.”
The ball in Draco’s throat bobbed. His eyes were glued to the shoulder, which obstructed his path. “Just let it be, Potter,” he said so quietly that Harry nearly couldn’t hear it. “Things don’t have to change.”
“Everyone does every once in a while,” said Anthony. “The only ones we haven’t seen are Zabini, Hermione, Ron, and―well―you.”
Neville was dusting twigs from his hair, his smile stretching from ear to ear. “I can’t believe this was the way to get Malfoy back all those times.”
Teddy was silent for a long moment, and Harry wondered if he had said too much for the three-year-old to understand. “Do you know a Malfoy?”
“Well, that’s why you came back for your eighth-year, right? To get to be a teenager without Voldemort hanging over your shoulder.”
The boys, who slowly finished separating, both nodded. “I’ll come with,” said Ron, his voice hoarse. He looked back at Harry as he stood up. “To make sure she doesn’t burn the chocolate.”
His mouth moved once, then he blinked until finally, he shook out of his daze. His whole face went as red as a Weasley’s head. “Just because I admitted to liking blokes last night doesn’t mean I like you…Harry.” He huffed and dropped his head back into the pillow. “See, Potter would have sounded so much better there.”
“I hear you found someone too.” George crossed his arms and sat back into his chair, an accusatory look on his face that looked far more like Percy than Harry wished to admit.
Malfoy released Harry’s arm only to lean back in his chair, one leg crossed over the other as he folded his arms and stared Harry down. “And you expect me to believe you don’t have nightmares.” Harry’s eyes widened. He swore he never told him that. “I’ve been through it too,” Malfoy pressed. “I know what it’s like. You can’t fool me.”
They sat in their regular spot in the corner of the café beside the lounges. When there was a short break of new walk-ins, Heather left the counter and found the trio. “Glad to see you’re introducing more people to our little place,” she said, looking at Pansy.
“You’re absurd,” Malfoy huffed as they walked back to the locker rooms to get cleaned up. Harry needed a shower the most; his pants up to his calves smelling like giant squid.
Draco was a master of putting on an innocent façade. He glanced between Harry’s wide eyes and slack jaw and what he wore. “What’s wrong?”
Zabini’s eyes darkened. Whether he was embarrassed or angered, Harry did not care. He released him and stepped away. This wasn’t worth his time.
The previous weekend, when Harry had taken Malfoy shopping for houseware, they had stumbled upon a small corner café that appeared relatively peaceful. After a short walk ― and the use of Malfoy's far better sense of direction ― they arrived at the English Rose Café.
“I only got Narcissa and Draco off,” Harry corrected. He made sure to keep his voice as low as humanly possible and hoped that now was not the time Malfoy finally decided to look up―or that he could read lips. “Lucius still has another year before his case is re-evaluated.”
Harry let out a much more violent breath of air and shook his head. “No, it’s not something for me to tell.”
A deeper pause of contemplation might have led him to a better conclusion but his whole body was trembling. All he could see were her cold eyes and his imagination fitted together the rest of her sinister visage. He should have known she’d find a way to return.
“What?” Zabini snarled. “Going to kill me? If you can’t have him, no one can, is that it? Maybe you don’t deserve him either then.”
It was around three in the morning when it was his bladder that woke him up this time. He hated having to walk through Malfoy’s room to use the toilet. He was always afraid he was going to wake him up. Nevertheless, it was already hard enough to sleep with his mind pestering him; he had no hope with his body nagging him with needs too.
He shook away the chill that ran down his spine. “It doesn’t matter,” he muttered to himself and suddenly he realized that the tiny whimper in his head had been his own voice. He hadn’t recognized it. “It doesn’t matter,” he repeated both mentally and out loud.
Within an hour, Harry realized just how much he’d missed in the last month and a half. He’d been aware that Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes was up and running again; he’d seen it on his first trip to Diagon Alley to get things for Draco. He had yet to hear the story of how George and Angelina had caught up or how she was now helping out at the store. Percy was also subject to several teasing remarks about some girl named Audrey.
The sight inside caught Harry off his guard. Terry Skeres, who Harry recognized as being a Gryffindor a year above him, stood with his wand pointed at a bloodied Draco Malfoy who lay on a bed of broken glass that appeared to have once been a coffee table.
Draco shrugged. “No, you can sleep here. You do almost every other night anyway. It doesn’t bother me. It’s just a suggestion,” Draco added quickly when Harry didn’t respond right away.
"You've brought this type of food around three times now, and it always comes with those little sticks," Malfoy noted. "They can't be wands; Muggles don't have wands, right? Besides, they're far too thin. How would you even fit a core into one of these?" He held up a conjoined set of chopsticks, glaring at them as if they had personally offended him.
Almost every eighth-year sat in a half circle around the fireplace, littering the large maroon leather sofas and ottoman and even spreading around on the floor. There were only three who weren’t there: the only Slytherins to return. Daphne Greengrass preferred sneaking down to the Slytherin common room to be with her younger sister, and Blaise Zabini was usually resigned to his bedroom. Draco Malfoy was the only one present though he didn’t join the steadily more rambunctious group. He sat in his usual thick leather chair beside the window on the other side of the room, curled up with a book in his lap and never once lifting his eyes from the pages as if hoping he would eventually fade into oblivion.
Ron sighed. He looked back at Harry, his expression tight. “Angelina promised to keep George on relatively good behavior. I don’t know if anyone’s told Bill or Charlie but Percy won’t argue with Mum. Dad doesn’t mind.”
“You don’t usually stay here on Sunday nights,” Harry spoke after the resounding click of the closed door behind him. “Won’t Zabini notice you missing?”
“Notice what?” the pair echoed. They were looking up at their audience, Malfoy somehow having caught Harry’s wrists in a vice grip.
When they were done, Draco took the plates and ordered Harry to take a shower. "If you don't get in that shower right now, I'll finally fulfill that fetish of yours and get in the shower with you. However, trust me, I won't make it pleasant."
Harry felt something trail down to his own chin, but he barely considered it. He reached out to grasp Draco’s face in both of his hands, sweeping his thumbs under the other man’s eyes.
“Goodnight, Harry.” She gave the healer a pleasant smile. “Have a good evening, Healer Sow.” The healer returned the regard just as politely. Hermione’s eyes moved to Draco next.
Harry nodded half-heartedly, not looking up. Ron gave him one last odd look. He didn’t know what it was but something felt off.
Draco glanced at the gap between their beds. It wasn’t as if they slept with their backs pressed together every night, but they were usually, at the very least, at arm’s reach. It was this knowledge that typically kept the nightmares at moderate ease. “Yeah, I guess so.”
For the first time likely all term, he felt a small bit of joy. His letter had vanished and a new one in the same sharp handwriting as before was wedged between the pages. He took it back to the desk.
Malfoy was laughing, and the two were about to fall into one of their wrestling matches when Ron spoke over them. “Hey, we haven’t even finished the game yet!”
She was trembling from head to toe. Her pale face had somehow lost even more color, her eyes wide and overly bright. “I- I’m sorry. I tried to stop it, they wouldn’t listen to me. It’ll be everywhere tomorrow morning.”
Harry refocused on the original topic when Dean returned and interlaced his fingers with Seamus’s. He dropped his voice so only Hermione could hear. “But, everyone was okay with, you know…” he nodded towards the couple.
“You should know,” Harry said softly, “he knew you wouldn’t do it. He wanted it to be Snape. It was the only way Voldemort would trust him.”
Deciding that Malfoy didn't appear distressed, Harry settled to wait downstairs instead of camping out in his hall. He hoped it would mean he'd get fewer dirty looks from Malfoy's neighbors. He grabbed a muggle newspaper from a dispenser nearby and took a seat at a bench in an attempt to blend in.
“Honestly, I wish this was the way you two had always been,” Susan spoke through her giggles. “It’s far more entertaining.”
However, when he rounded the railing and started down the stairs, he found one of the last people he was expecting settled in front of the fireplace. Harry’s steps slowed. He momentarily considered turning around but his feet continued to carry him down.
Hermione crossed the room in the three large steps. Ron right behind her. They both dropped onto the bed on either side of him. They wrapped their arms around him in a tight embrace. He tensed. Then he finally let everything out.
"Malfoy didn't kill Fred!" The second the words came out of his mouth, Harry knew he’d gone too far. This was not the day to say that name.
Malfoy leaned his head back over the back of the couch, frowning at the other man. "You already got food? We didn't even decide what restaurant to go to today."
However, despite the atrocious prospect of eating with muggles, Pansy couldn’t help but be more surprised that Draco was the one to suggest it. Not for blood purity reasons but merely the suggestion that they leave the flat. It took hours for her to just drag him to get food. That’s why she eventually just started buying it by herself and bringing it by when she visited.
Harry straightened, opened his mouth to yell, assessed his words, and then closed it again. "You know who's doing this?"
A short sigh slid out of Harry’s teeth as he looked back. Malfoy was sitting up, one foot on the ground and prepared to leap up if he had to.
The once tired girl quirked a brow. The corner of her mouth twitched as she tried to repress a smile. "I mean, are you on the same tab?"
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Draco spoke over him. He snapped the door shut and went to the pile of takeaway menus. “I’ll get it.”
He tore his eyes away from Harry, his teeth grinding as he took a pause. His face was twisting up into the ugly sneer Harry had not seen in so long as he stepped deeper into his memories. “Of course, he acted like he was damn near panting for it every time after, saying how much he loved seeing me stand up for him. I really should have seen through it, but I didn’t want it to stop. He was the only good part of that whole damn year.
can’t keep up with something?” Ron pressed, his eyes wide. He looked back at Harry. “See what you and Malfoy have done? You’ve broken her.”
Malfoy got up as well, reaching desperately for Harry. Malfoy could feel his chest beginning to tighten already. He wasn't sure what line he'd crossed, but he couldn't let Harry leave like this. "Wait, Potter," he pled. "Please, don't go."
“Yes, well, that doesn’t happen very often now does it? Especially from you.” Harry wasn’t sure why that added dig stung the way that it did. “So, I gave it a chance. Obviously it made sense again once I realized you were trying to get information out of me.”
"Says you, why are you putting honey in it?" Harry urged. "I mean, it's better than Hermione. Hers is seventy percent sugar; I think she really has a sweets problem now that she doesn't live with her parents."
“Potter. Potter?” The frantic voice from beside him pulled him from the green light behind his eyelids.
“I asked Harry not to tell anyone,” Draco spoke up. He didn’t want to get Harry’s best friend even more upset with him. “I didn’t want people like Macnair finding out.”
He never got this feeling when talking about his dreams at the Burrow, but the core of those people had never changed in Harry’s eyes. Every day something seemed to change about Malfoy. He couldn’t even figure out when it started. Had it been when he invited him to drink with them, or was it at the trial when Malfoy had to admit the depth of his involvement with Voldemort and how he was threatened daily, or was it in Malfoy Manor when he didn’t give Harry up, or perhaps it had been in the bathroom when he saw the tears staining his pallid face? Harry didn’t know the answer, but he was beginning to admit that he liked the result.
The sun streamed into Harry's eyes. His sleepy brain assumed he'd crashed on Ron and Hermione's sofa again; he couldn't be in his own bedroom at Grimmauld, light usually avoided the windows of the townhouse as if it was magically inclined. The clinking sound in the kitchen was alarming, considering there was a fifty-fifty chance it was Hermione, which was never good.
Malfoy’s mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water until he finally settled on, “And that doesn’t bother you?”
so much?” Draco asked, likely intending it to be conversational. Harry’s answer cut off the head of any casual discussion.
Draco shook his head side to side. “You know, you’re getting to be far more romantic than I ever would have imagined Harry Potter to be. I thought you were a fumbling fool.”
After Kreacher had left, Harry had scrambled up to his bedroom. There was a clearly worn mark on the carpet between the two twin beds where Harry had paced this time and many times before.
Harry’s shoulders fell. This had been what he’d wanted, but seeing it still hurt. He didn’t get to wallow for long.
He started to leave her side but she took his wrist and pulled him down again. “Did Draco make this?” she asked through a smile, barely above a whisper.
“I don’t have any problem with-” He attempted to step forward and instantly felt a sharp pain shoot up his abdomen. He crumpled forward, nearly losing his footing. Draco caught him before he could fall.
His head snapped up again, and Harry knew he had hit something. It was hard to tell if it was bad or good, but it was raw. “I hated that old man,” Draco croaked. “I don’t even know why.”
His morose thoughts kept him from concentrating on his work. So far, he only had a Transfiguration paper due Thursday and he knew enough about the topic to write it in thirty minutes. Deciding to find some entertainment, he traveled back to the Muggle-Fiction section of the library. He had meant to find a new book but his eyes captured the blue spine of
It got to the point that Harry actively tried to avoid overtime. He hurried out of the office, usually before Ron could even say goodbye.
Across the many books were titles that Draco didn’t recognize in the least bit. He had wandered into the muggle section.
The sound of Hermione Granger howling in pain in his parlor drowned out the voice. Professor Burbage, the previous professor of Muggle Studies, pleading for her life cracked through the screams.
The books tumbled out of Draco’s grasp. The careful calm he’d woven over himself throughout the day and hid behind distractions suddenly crumbled. “How?”
She scoffed, her eyes lingering on the door. “I would normally say otherwise, but I can see you’re well taken care of.” Her eyes flitted back to him. "In more ways than one."
Harry rolled his eyes, but the corners of his mouth were pulling up as well. “Fantastically narcissistic.”
Malfoy let out a noise of offense, but neither paid it any mind. "Tap on the two-way if you need me."
Heather soon arrived with their drinks. “It’s a slow day. If you wait around long enough, maybe we can all go to lunch together.”
Malfoy clicked his tongue to the roof of his mouth. "It'll only take a few seconds. Just stop complaining."
It wasn’t long before both boys were on the ground wrestling, both trying to make the other look as ruffled as possible and exceeding exponentially. Everyone soon began to realize they weren’t going to get a proper explanation for what was happening.
“This one was taken in front of Draco’s apartment building,” Harry pointed at the picture on the front page. He flipped it and pointed at the one of them holding hands. “And this one was just around the corner.”
Ron grabbed his cloak, throwing it over his shoulders before turning back to Harry. "He's calmed down, and we've put a tracker on his wand. We'll know every spell he casts up until the trial."
“Hm? Oh, I ca-“ He stopped and blinked a few times as if suddenly remembering something. “Yeah, okay…”
Draco stood from the sofa, his eyes scanning Harry's body up and down for any wounds. The other man stomped back to the dining table, throwing his bag down so hard that they were liable to get a complaint from downstairs.
Draco pushed the photos away, starting through the files. The wizarding world had a poor form of forensics. It seemed they usually just followed the smell of magic and hoped the person at the end of it was the guilty party. There were some notes, though.
If Harry had left Malfoy, then he couldn’t still be too upset with Ron. Maybe he’d accept an offer. “When you’re done with that, you can come over for dinner tonight,” Ron suggested. “It’s been a while.”
Before Teddy could argue, Harry started towards the door again, brushing past Andromeda as he went. Teddy tried to follow. Andromeda grabbed his arm, keeping him back. His eyes began to water. “Uncle Harry,” he whimpered.
Harry pulled them to a stop in front of the apartment building. Draco gave him a quizzical look but it was cut off when Harry pressed another kiss to his lips. It was a soft, short kiss but it said everything Harry was feeling without words.
Draco gave a stiff nod, still not taking his gaze off his book. In the corner of his eyes, he could see Harry moving around the room. He closed the door then went to the dresser, where he hesitated for a moment. He glanced back at Draco, who quickly tried to refocus on his book. It didn’t work in the slightest.
Draco’s face fell. “Bother me? Why would talking about a girl bother me? Did something else happen?”
Malfoy’s eyes snapped open, and he glared at the dark wood grain. “You saved my life, you bastard, then you saved me from Azkaban,” he spat like Harry had done something insulting. “So don’t think for one second I’m going to stand around and let you wallow in self-hatred!”
When Sow returned an hour later, she coaxed Draco into helping her again. As they worked, Harry noticed Hermione checking the clock. “You can go home, I’ll be okay,” he assured her. “I’m sure Ron will be home by now.”
Only a second passed before Harry’s words sunk in. Malfoy glanced past his shoulder to where the backs of Granger’s and Weasley’s heads could be seen at the sofas.
More flat stones were scattered along the bank. Reason said that none should be there since he had thrown almost all of them last time. Hogwarts, even its grounds, were not a place of reason, though. Perhaps the giant squid liked it when people skipped rocks and supplied more, or maybe the merpeople had thrown them all back in hopes of hitting whoever was littering them. These were the mild thoughts Harry had as the quiet minutes passed. Draco was concentrating, and Harry wouldn’t bother him unless provoked.
She leaned inside as if something was holding her hips outside the door. She glimpsed at a clock. “No, I think not. I don’t want to be late — owl me when he wakes, though, if you don’t mind. I’ll give you the address. Do you have a quill and parchment?” She scribbled the air like she already had the quill.
There were some nice things, of course. Saturday mornings at the English Rose Café were always pleasant. The same barista was always there and had taken to getting their usual orders of coffee and muffins prepared the moment they hit the door.
After nearly three full, consecutive cups of tea, Draco was the first to concede to the bathroom. Silence lingered behind him and Harry thought it would remain until returned. Only a second after his departure, he found that he was wrong.
He started towards the door, grabbing his cloak off the hook. Draco followed. “You promised you’d stay with me!”
Snow soon stuck to the ground of Hogwarts. Holiday cheer swept the castle in a tidal wave. Many were primarily excited to go home for the holiday break. Nevertheless, it was not coming quick enough for a few.
Malfoy felt his heart drop down to his stomach. It was all that he could do to not throw himself across the room. He might have done so if Potter was still not holding onto his hair.
They had been back at Hogwarts for less than a month and it was actually all quite stifling. The adoration from the younger students. The pity in the eyes of the professors. The world outside watching with baited breath to see how the war worn students were going to make it through the year.
Harry wasn't the type to overthink things, though. If it had been anyone else, maybe he would have said to hell with it and just perused the feeling. It wasn't someone else, though. It was Draco Malfoy. It was his schoolyard nemesis. It was Voldemort's chosen one. It was the person Harry cared so much about that he wasn't sure he could handle things going badly between them.
Harry could feel Malfoy look at him and assumed he was deciding how to agree nicely. "I never said that."
They somehow ended up watching the rest of the program. Harry shifted a little uncomfortably when he realized halfway through that two of the characters were gay men. He looked over at Malfoy curiously. Either this didn't bother Malfoy, or he hadn't figured it out yet.
He dropped his hand. A moment passed as he appeared to continue to examine the fabric longer. In actuality, he was collecting his courage. He sucked in a deep breath, pulling his shoulders up tall and wiping off any emotions on his face.
This had become a typical response to any one of Harry’s requests. Harry got the feeling that rather than purposefully being derisive, he was trying to actually learn the difference between someone being genuinely kind or having a goal in mind. It seemed wrong to lie. Harry did have a motive in this case.
He stuck the book back into its place then returned to his studies. It lasted all of twenty minutes before he began to doodle in the margins of his notes. Deep down he really hoped the person would respond. It was becoming extremely boring to be Draco Malfoy.
She shrugged though her lips began to curl once again. “It’s nothing. Only…” She appeared hesitant to go on, but her curiosity got the better of her. “In my experience, men don’t usually try new things unless a girl is involved. Are you seeing anyone?”
Pansy took the mug from her face, a cream mustache staying behind, and nodded her head profusely. Heather giggled in delight. Harry started to point out the white mark on her face, but Draco sent him a quelling look. He shut his mouth, pressing his lips together as he tried not to laugh.
“He’s in love with him.” The whole room stopped breathing for a beat. Eyes moved slowly to the person who had spoken. It was Ginny.
Draco’s wand disappeared within his jacket once again. He tore his gaze off of Andromeda to find the many other pairs of eyes watching him. They were all stiff. Several people had their hands still hovering around their hips, likely ready to pull out their own wands. He cleared his throat. “I think I need some air.”
Draco was curled into his sofa. He stared at the television. His eyes were mostly glazed over, not really taking in what he was watching. It was how he had spent most of the last week. Every once in a while, he’d crack open a book, but he was pretty certain he’d read all of them. He only considered making potions once, but it just didn’t sound entertaining whatsoever.
“When I first learned I had magic,” Draco re-read. He couldn’t tell if that meant they were muggleborn or not. They did say their parents weren’t around so maybe they were magical.
Draco looked at the child with alarm. His eyes snapped to Andromeda who was watching them closely. He really didn’t want to start any more drama. Maybe he should just leave and wait for Harry at Grimmauld. He was about to stand up when he heard the child’s voice. “Uncle Harry says he likes you.”
Malfoy made a short sound of derision, “Sod off, Potter. You aren’t into blokes. It would ruin your perfect image.”
Draco’s lip trembled as he spoke. “I should have known,” he said, barely audible. He looked down at Harry. “Her brother was killed during the battle. She came to the manor sometime after our trials trying to persuade us to help her get revenge. That was when my mother decided to leave, she didn’t want anything to do with any Death Eaters anymore, and she didn’t like that they knew where to find us. Carrow must have found Macnair and convinced him to help her.”
“I forgot what he was like before. He barely slept unless he downed a whole bottle of whiskey. He couldn’t sit still. Loud noises set him off. Honestly, I was getting to the point where I was afraid to let him around Hermione, which isn’t fair to either of them ― they’re like siblings.” Describing the past was making Ron’s eyes burn once again. He had been reaching his breaking point, and it wasn’t as long ago as he’d like it to be.
“But he might,” muttered Justin Finch-Fletchley. He let out a groan after Hannah Abbott had thwacked him over the head.
Malfoy felt his body run cold. In a moment of quick analysis, he realized Harry was watching the top of his head. He couldn’t feel anything there, but he had gotten very close to those trees before thinking better of it. Trees so near the Forbidden Forest held all sorts of things. It could be anything from a Bowtruckle to a young Acromantula or something else entirely more heart-stopping.
Without waiting for her to make a decision, he marched out of the room. Harry could see that she was going to try to talk him back, but there was no point. He reached for her hand, slowing her. “It’s okay, ‘Mione,” he assured. “You tried.”
They had to have spoken after he left, which meant Draco likely told her what happened between them. He was surprised Hermione wasn’t tearing him a new one for saying something so insensitive to anyone ― Malfoy or not. His words and his regret had been knocking around in his skull all day, slowly driving him insane. It was the reason he decided to damn the rules and went to the office.
Harry wrinkled his nose though there was a smile playing on his lips. “Not a bad idea.” His eyes flashed up to lock onto the other boy’s. “But I wouldn’t want to kill something so pretty.”
Ron gestured to where Harry was now on top of Malfoy and doing his damndest to push as many sticks into Malfoy’s ‘perfect’ hair. “Go ahead now. I don’t think he’ll notice.”
Draco could see the tightness on his mother’s face. “We won’t be staying long, only the holidays. Molly Weasley invited us for Christmas.”
Harry frowned at him until he remembered his busted lip. He had gotten used to the swollen feeling, so he'd almost forgot about it. "Our culprit got away from me," he sighed.
Harry shook his head. “I don’t understand that. We’re careful. We don’t kiss outside of the apartment.”
Draco finally tore his eyes off of their hands to meet the other man’s gaze. His eyes glistened, his grey irises appearing like melted silver. It knocked the breath of Harry’s lungs. “Don’t walk out like that again, please. I don’t have anyone else,” he whimpered. “You, Mother, and Pansy, that’s it. The rest left me or died, and the ones who died probably would have left, too. No one wants to be friends with a Malfoy who’s fallen from grace.”
Ron nodded slowly. He grabbed his glass of water again, this time taking several more long gulps. Harry lost his ability to restrain his laughter any longer. Ron gave him a severe glare from the top of his cup.
The years had not treated him kindly. He looked worse than the state Harry had found his son in. Not only was he thin but his face was sunken and gaunt, his receding hairline only making it more noticeable, while the patchy beard he’d grown in his isolation did little to cover any of it. Harry couldn’t help but see a better dressed Mr. Filch.
Harry sighed but didn't say anything more, deciding to stuff his mouth with food instead. Malfoy followed his example. The silence only lasted a second after the food touched Malfoy's lips. His eyes widened. "This is really good," Malfoy gushed, covering his mouth with a hand as he spoke around the food, too eager to wait until he'd finished chewing.
Draco was barely listening. His mind was moving a mile a minute, trying to find answers. “I can’t be your little experiment. I can’t do that. I’m sorry.”
Draco waited until Monday to check the book again. A smile broke across his face the moment he saw the familiar writing.
Harry nodded, mostly just to get the conversation to end quicker. "Yeah, of course." He slung his bag over his shoulder and already began to walk away as he spoke. "See you next week."
Draco nodded. “You’re probably the only person I understand.” He finally looked up again and the challenging smirk on Harry’s face slipped away when their eyes met. “I wouldn’t have been doing my job right if I didn’t. Know thy enemy and all that.”
Draco bit his lip. He looked over at the flaming face of the boy beside him. He had a feeling he knew what Ron was talking about. He risked a glance at Ginny as well who turned away on her heel to sit at the other end of the table. He didn’t remember exactly what his remark had been to the girl about the matter but he had a feeling she remembered.
Zabini’s eyes sparkled, and Harry knew he made a mistake. “He doesn’t trust you? It sounds like maybe he already is holding out for someone better.”
Above all, he remembered the bang like a cannon blast, his own wand in Potter’s hand pointed at the Dark Lord, a flash of green and gold, and then it was all over.
Zabini took a few more steps until he was level with everyone else. “The Slytherins have had one going for ages. Don’t tell me you’ve stooped so low, Potter.”
Harry moved closer to Teddy, dropping his voice to a whisper as he interrupted the child’s train of thought. “Remember that Malfoy I said I wanted you to meet?”
Draco shook his head. "I'm a Malfoy. Before, that meant I was supposed to be a ministry man like my father was. I wouldn't have any time for silly little things like doodling. Now… Now no one would want anything I created except to maybe destroy it. There's no point."
Harry expected that he was coming to share another one of these theories for their latest case when he came up to his desk while Harry was packing up. “I don’t know if my informant,” no one besides Ron and Robards knew ho Harry’s informant was, “will know anything about petty theft. Fletcher will probably be a better source if we can track him down.”
There was a deep frown on Malfoy's face, aging him considerably. "Why do you keep coming here? What do you want?"
After saying their farewells to Kreacher, they started towards the apartment. They decided to take the long way back. This meant passing Allure, the gay club he used to pass every night and tried to pretend he didn’t notice. He didn’t feel self-conscious about looking at the rainbow flag above the door this time though; if anything he felt a short burst of pride in his chest when he glanced at it.
Harry started to tell her to give her their usual, but Pansy interrupted. “Give me whatever is your best.”
“You went alone?” exclaimed Draco. Harry cringed into the cot. He had been severely hoping that would be glossed over. Draco stomped up to the injured man and smacked his leg, causing Harry to wince back in pain. “You went after that maniac all alone, and look what happened! Did you have a mental break?”
“A few months ago I had come down here to check on the shop. While I was here I overheard his older brother talking about him being arrested for attacking Malfoy in his home.” He scrubbed at the back of his neck. “I remember because I was half tempted to ask for the address myself.” He raised his hands in defense when he saw the look on Harry’s face. “I didn’t, obviously. Actually that was also the day I quite literally bumped into Angelina because I was too busy eavesdropping.”
Skeres had just been let out. If Harry were in his shoes at that moment, being released after being forced to stew in one's anger for three days, he knew exactly what he'd do next.
“All of your things are still here anyway,” said Draco. “You’re fortunate, actually. I was about to throw it all out.”
“Good afternoon, Ms. Craft. I’ve only come to check in on things on my way home,” he told her. She started down the stairs which no longer were covered by the tattered runner, revealing glossy hardwood that matched the new, sturdy handrail. “How have the kids settled back in?”
Harry couldn’t see the smirk but he could hear it. “Actually,” he removed his hands from Harry’s head to scratch down his back, “I quite like the idea of him walking in on us,” he added more pressure as he neared Harry’s lumbar, eliciting a moan, “then maybe he’ll learn not to come by unannounced.”
After breakfast, they returned to the Common Room. Hermione was urging them to start on the homework they had been complaining about the night before, but Harry was still nursing his hangover. He slumped onto one of the couches across from Anthony Goldstein, who was also methodically massaging his temples.
“Everything that happened after, that was the lie.” He moved closer, shaking his head carefully. “Last year wasn’t. I meant everything that I did and said. I…” Draco almost choked when he saw Zabini struggle for his words. He couldn’t even keep eye contact with Draco anymore. “I wasn’t using you. If anything, I thought you were using me with how often you talked about Potter. My mother is the one who told me to stop. I didn’t think you’d miss me until I saw you.”
He was still thinking about it when he got to work Monday. Thankfully, he and Ron were sent out for patrol duty which didn’t require much concentration.
The girl bit her lip hard, now hardly repressing her grin. She wrote down their orders and began to work on the coffees, her voice trembling with repressed laughter as she told them they could sit anywhere. They chose the high-top next to the windows.
,” Harry broke the silence, a quizzical expression split across Ron’s face, “about what you told me yesterday.”
“Why were you expecting us?” Harry demanded. He wasn’t in the mood for formalities. Terry didn’t appear nervous at all to see them. It was certainly not what one would expect from someone who knew they’d be accused leaking personal information.
Malfoy pursed his lips as he gave a jab to his napkin. “Or I could stay,” he looked up at Harry, “or you could come back with me.”
“What the fuck is going on here?” Ron roared from Harry’s side. Harry hadn’t heard Ron or Neville arrive but they were both holding him back now.
“My father collects dark objects. Not to be used,” he assured quickly upon seeing the sharp look on Ron’s face, “only to be appreciated for the complicated spell work. I studied a lot of it when I was younger. That dagger, in particular, always interested me. It is extremely complex work and nearly impossible to undo unless you know it well.”
Harry sat back, feeling mild accomplishment for simply getting Malfoy to look up. “So, do you want to come?”
“You mean Potter,” Zabini said on a mirthless laugh. Draco knew he shouldn’t stop, but his legs were already so heavy from the long night. “You know he doesn’t actually care about you. How could he? He’s spent the last seven years hating you. Do you really think that all of a sudden he’s in love with you? He’s probably just hoping you’ll spill all your secrets so he can humiliate you.”
Anyone not already at the table began to migrate over. Molly, Charlie, and Ginny started to levitate at least three dishes each ahead of themselves.
A short gasp drew Draco back as he caught the earnestness in Harry’s eyes. Draco’s eyebrows were knitted together, his eyes darting over Harry’s features with heavy-handed measurements. Panic was rising. Harry had to do something. He reached out to grasp Draco’s wrist, partially to keep him seated and also to give it a reassuring squeeze. “You’re beautiful,” he said quickly. “That’s what I was thinking.”
Harry saw the fury flare in his friend's eyes before he could consider what he said. Ron opened his mouth, and Harry braced himself to be chewed out. What happened instead felt even worse.
Draco relented. He eased his arm, and Harry gradually loosened his grip. When it seemed that Draco wouldn’t pull away again, Harry resumed pulling down his sleeve.
It wasn’t as if he was a mean drunk or that he drank a whole bottle in one night. He was just so restless that he seemed to need something to sedate him. However, once he was sedated, he’d usually become very quiet and stared blankly at the television or out the window, or he’d have a panic attack that Draco would have to talk him down from.
“Come on.” He tugged lightly on his shoulder. “If I come back empty-handed, the others may jinx me.”
“Access? Sure but I’d never look at them,” he added staunchly. “They let us into a whole heap of places others aren’t allowed. I don’t need to go snooping in files to know things.”
Malfoy stalled for another moment before finally getting to his feet. “If you do come in, try to be a little more graceful than an erumpant in a potion’s shop.”
If anyone didn’t belong back at Hogwarts, it was the golden trio. At the very least, Granger acted like there was something left for her to learn, even if she did figure everything out in half the time everyone else did. Meanwhile, Potter and Weasley were happy to mill about and act as though school was their vacation time. To some degree, it probably was.
Once more, Harry tried to get away, and, once more, Ron spoke up. “Right, right. The thing is, I talked to Kreacher,” Harry stopped dead in his tracks, “he said you haven’t been home in days.”
“I need to use the loo,” Harry said, any better excuse evading him. “Go on ahead and save me a seat.”
He didn’t show a hint of fear. On the contrary, he was trying not to laugh. “Down, kitty. You’ll get wrinkles by frowning like that.”
Ron narrowed his eyes. “Did you two switch personalities or something? That’s a pretty evil smile you’ve got there.”
“…Arthur and I have been a few times in our earlier days but it’s been years. Oh, boys, are you all right?” Molly turned away from what appeared to have been a fairly good conversation between her and Narcissa.
“You’re just hiding him, I know it! That bent prick is just a coward hiding behind all of you like he did during the war!”
Harry stared at him for a long minute. It appeared Malfoy didn’t plan to give anything more than the blush steadily spreading across his cheeks and ears. It became even brighter when he caught the smile cracking Harry’s face. “Yeah, I don’t think he’s the only one.”
“She’s doing really good. I was worried she’d be bored or lonely, but she’s decided to renovate the entire manner. For a moment, I thought I was in a different place when I first walked in.”
The warm smile on Zabini’s mouth flashed with wickedness as quickly as the shade in his eyes darkened. “Fight like Draco did? Oh no, wait, he didn’t even have the brains to walk away.”
Malfoy nodded solemnly. Silence washed over them, the stiff type that hadn’t affected them in so long. Harry was desperate to find an easy subject.
Harry had yet to develop an expectation for his birthday. It was only the fourth summer of his life that he hadn’t spend at the Dursley’s and therefore had anyone around that acted as though it was a remotely significant day.
Draco scoffed, his face twisting into a sneer. “It doesn’t keep him centered. That job is killing him. You should see the way he comes home sometimes. He runs headfirst into things and never looks back. This isn’t going to be the last time he’s seriously injured, and he might not get back up from the next one. Honestly, I think he’s more addicted to the job than he is to drinking.”
Draco crossed the room with two of his wide steps to snake his arms around Harry’s neck. “I hope you mean for the better.”
“That’s the only part that matters, and the only part anyone cares about. I’m not dragging my own name through the mud just to keep your feelings from getting hurt.”
There was a moment of silence and Malfoy did not look up from the thin book in his lap. Harry began to wonder if he had not heard him somehow when Malfoy spoke. “The quidditch pitch?” he spoke softly as though he was asking himself a question about something he’d read.
Harry chuckled from the sofa. “I know he used to do so in school. It was the quickest way to get your attention.”
As he got closer he overheard the one who knew as Harper from his days on the qudditch team speaking. “How
Teddy, who’d happily taken up the task of handing out slices of cake, ran up to Draco to hand him an extra sprinkled piece. Draco honestly thought he didn’t have any room to eat more yet but he found himself unable to turn down the child. Did puppy eyes come with the werewolf gene?
She made a poor attempt at glaring at him, her eyes still too red and puffy. “I can make hot chocolate.”
The woman surveyed their position shamelessly. “Really? I never would have guessed.” She gestured to the cooling skillet. “Finish making breakfast, and disinfect the counters when you’re done.” She turned on her heel and disappeared into the dining room again.
Harry’s attention got caught on the door. He didn’t notice Goyle’s hand slip into his pocket. Harry moved to uncharm the door just as Goyle pulled out his wand. A combination of Seeker reflexes and Auror training saved Harry. He managed to change the intent of his spell at the last second. A shield charm fell in front of him just before the red light could reach him.
The usual catharsis—mixed with a healthy amount of alcohol—eventually made for a giddy room. The stories went further back into previous years. They mirrored the victories against the Carrows with the victories against Umbridge, and before long genuine good stories were being told, some of which included Draco and Harry.
Harry dropped his hand which still lingered in Draco’s hair. He snaked both arms around Draco’s waist, pulling him closer. “I guess something about you just makes me
“So did you find what you were looking for at Honeydukes?” Granger asked as the golden boy himself approached.
It felt like someone had just smacked Harry across the face. How had he not thought of that before? He was about to jump out of his chair again but he paused instead, narrowing his eyes at George. “How do you know about that?” His Auror brain was ticking into full gear and it was quick to find suspicion in everything around him.
Her eyes showed a clear message, “Do I stop this?” Of which, Ron could not answer since he looked just as confused by his best mate’s giddy grin and his playfully bouncing partner.
The couple went back down to the kitchen. Kreacher was there; he watched them expectantly. “He’s doing better,” Ron assured. “Three hot chocolates.”
Harry could feel his body whimpering from the stiffness of his muscles. He tried to shift his weight, but it felt awkward, his legs uneven. He brushed back his hair and only then noticed his hands were trembling as they ran across his scalp.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “So does every Slytherin. They’re all trying to distance themselves from me as much as possible. I’m quite universally hated.”
Harry broke apart first, but it wasn’t to stop. He trailed kisses all along Draco’s jaw, following the curve down to his neck. “I’m not going anywhere,” he hummed against Draco’s collar bone. It sent a shiver down his spine. He twisted his fingers firmly into the other man’s messy tresses.
There was no harm in checking. If he recalled, no one had failed to turn in their paper to Slughorn that day. They could have simply rewritten the original, but Draco could only imagine what a disaster a
Harry tilted his head, looking at the other man oddly. "Why wouldn't I?" Harry began to think back to their past conversations, trying to find when he'd ever said he wouldn't be coming by. He came up blank. "And why did you have the door locked?"
Before taking a step, Harry found himself suddenly feeling the urge to touch Malfoy in some way. Like he was supposed to lead him or hold his hand or something.
Harry stared at Malfoy. He knew what it was like to not want anything to do with part of his family, but not like this, not because he blamed himself for any of their misfortune.
Harry kept searching for an opportunity to bring up what Ron had told him but nothing seemed right. He knew he had to say something though. The longer he waited, the more likely he would be to not say anything at all.
He quickly caught back up with Harry and continued to lead him through the shop. He made a small motion towards Harry as they passed Angelica who was clad in purple employee robes. She offered Harry a quick, reassuring smile before her attention was pulled elsewhere. They ducked into the back room.
His shoulders loosened, and Draco began to feel relieved before Harry even nodded. Harry's jaw was still tight, but he let Draco guide him back to the dining table. He reheated the takeaway and sat to eat with Harry. It was a mostly quiet affair. Draco could still see Harry's wheels turning. He was barely keeping himself in his chair.
Harry snapped his head up, and Malfoy quickly began to think of a way to take back his statement. "If you don't mind, yeah. That would help a lot."
Harry’s gaze returned to the mark and began to smooth his finger over the shape. It felt just as smooth as the rest of his skin. With one trace around the mark, Draco felt his muscles ease a fraction. Harry did it again, and he relaxed a little more. Again. Draco’s eyes fluttered shut.
There was slight expectation to Draco’s nod though he was silently grateful to have clarification. His heart had been too loud the first time Harry had told him the location.
The logic wasn’t entirely sound, but it was a good enough excuse to disobey. The elf watched his master go through these fits for three years. If he could get around his master’s rules to get help, then he’d do it.
"You were right about your hair," Draco mused, watching as his hands rubbed just before where his shirt collar ended. "Trimming it didn't help any."
Heather was his ultimate rescue. She appeared with their orders, handing the boys their usuals and placing something with an extra amount of cream and a fancy chocolate drizzle in front of Pansy.
“Right, right,” Harry shook his head, trying to clear his panicking mind. “Of course, yeah. I didn’t forget. I’ll be there.”
Draco shrugged again. He began to fiddle with the blanket between them. “She could tell I fancied you.”
She didn’t pause for long, certainly not long enough for Ron or Hermione to notice. “Yes, certainly,” she assured, putting the kettle down to search for the sweetener.
“No, no,” Draco shook his head violently, “that’s not what I meant. I mean, we can’t do this,” Harry still appeared confused, “at all!”
A mild-weathered Saturday was almost impossible for anyone to ignore. Harry and Malfoy were not the only ones to venture down to the pitch, but when a few sixth-years tried to tempt Harry into a game, they were all more than a little miffed when he declined in favor of playing with Malfoy.
"Who's there?" roared Kreacher from the landing above before thumped down into sight. His old face was twisted with disdain. "Get out! Master will be home any minute. Kreacher won't let another thief in this house."
To be perfectly honest, I had no idea how I was going to end this story. I typically write a lot of angst so this was mostly just a fluffy piece but I hope it was enjoyable. I may come back and do an epilogue but my niece was just born and I'll be busy helping out for a bit. Thanks for reading!
He tiptoed into the room, not closing the door to refrain from making any more sound. He moved quickly and silently to the other door across the room, not turning on the light until he had the door closed behind him.
After a few mind-clearing blinks, Malfoy responded. "You looked comfortable, and I know you had a long day. I really don't mind."
“Well, I’m afraid your influence isn’t very favorable at the moment,” Robards said without a hint of remorse. “In fact, I think anyone involved with your family is leaving themselves open for quite a bit of criticism. That’s why I can’t imagine Auror Potter would intend to be connected to any of you. Given that I don’t believe anything illegal occurred, I urge you to take this personal matter out of my department.”
“You know exactly what I’m talking about,” Harry hissed. “You actually had feelings for him, didn’t you? You were just too much of a coward to admit it after.”
The first thing he noticed was the pictures on top. For the first time, Draco wished he was looking at muggle photographs. At least they didn't move. With muggle photos, he wouldn't have to see the flies buzzing around the still bodies, giving it another layer of reality. These were once real people who now had their intestines littered across the stone pavement.
Malfoy hadn't gone to Azkaban, though. Harry knew that as a certainty. He had been the one to assure it. After Draco's mother, Narcissa Malfoy, had lied to Voldemort and saved him, he felt responsible for repaying the debt by speaking at their trial. His testimony had saved them and put quite a strain on several of his friendships. Nevertheless, he knew it was right, and he considered his debt paid.
Harry rounded the counters and met Draco in the sitting room. He took him by the shoulders and pulled him to meet Harry’s gaze. “Hey, it doesn’t matter what he thinks anymore. It doesn’t matter what anyone thinks. We’ve got each other. That’s all that counts.”
"Wait, wait, wait," Harry fervently shook his hand in the air. "Does this mean there are photos like that of you?"
She turned and instinctively began to pat herself down in search of what she might have forgotten ― that was the only reason he would stop her. But Draco had nothing in his hands. He glanced back at the bedroom door and waited for a second, only for silence to greet him in return. He stepped out into the hall and closed the door gently behind him.
Harry readjusted the three-year-old on his hip as he looked back at the two sisters. “We’ll leave you two to talk,” he said if not a bit awkwardly. “I’ve got Teddy.”
,” Hermione pressed. “It has not been proven one way or the other. There’s no right or wrong answer to it.”
Harry frowned at their hands. “So are you,” he insisted. “Why do you let them talk to you like that? If I had…” but Harry didn’t finish once again, not wanting to think about their younger crueler selves.
Harry could only make himself appear to resist. In actuality, the moment Draco’s arms looped around his neck, he began to sit up again. The hard chest against his arm was much easier to give into. He was yanked up straight, tight muscles wrapped around his shoulders and a firm hand pulling his head close. The familiar sweet but earthy scent enveloped him.
Draco was pulled out of his thoughts by an overly sweet scent. He looked away from his own cauldron which held a shimmery, silver liquid to glance at Neville Longbottom. He was sharing the table with him while they worked on their assignment. Currently, Longbottom was frowning down at the lilac swirl in front of him.
Maybe his brain still hadn’t caught up after his panic attack. Or perhaps he hadn’t been completely done with that hug earlier. Either way, he stuffed his hands into his pockets to occupy them and started down the stairs.
They still bickered constantly. So much that they often found pillows being flung at them when they got too rowdy in the Common Room. They tended to take most of their energy out on the quidditch field, at least. Harry won every game.
“Don’t start being humble now ― it doesn’t suit you,” Harry teased, making Draco’s cheeks flush. “And you’re always healing me. If I had been conscious, I would have apparated to you.”
The witch nodded vigorously. “There wasn’t, or we didn’t think anything else could be done until Mr. Malfoy showed up.” She patted the man’s arm. “He knew exactly what to do. It was astonishing.”
“Even drunk and half asleep, you only live to irritate me,” Malfoy grumbled. He tried to move away, but he didn’t get far, Harry’s fingers tightening around the hair.
Malfoy stared at him for a long moment, only able to blink at him. Harry swore he saw a faint flush teetering at the base of his jaw. “You seemed genuine. And the way you’ve been acting lately, it confused me.”
He had done so. For several years, Draco had managed to keep it hidden and read in secret. He would follow the little white rabbit down the hole and join the tea party every night, arriving only as late as the rabbit. Sometimes Dobby would even read with him or help him act out certain scenes. Dobby was always a strange elf, he was so happy to play with his young master.
He could feel his cheeks burning the longer Harry’s touch whispered up and down his forearm. He tried to find a distraction in their surroundings.
Harry shook his head. "No, just electricity." Malfoy began to play with the dials, turning them back and forth to see if it would change anything. Harry watched the other man's bewilderment, remembering the time he had to take Arthur Weasley through the tube.
Malfoy had no idea how a compliment could be so infuriating, and yet he momentarily considered pulling out his wand all the same.
