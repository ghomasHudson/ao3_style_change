‘Draco!’ He whispered sharply, ‘Your mark, your sleeves are up!’
to that man.”
life.” Rone made a move as if to explain himself but Harry ignored him and carried on.
The doorbell rang again and this time he answered it. 'I know he’ll look at me with the usual mixture of disdain and something like pity' Harry thought, steeling himself. He let down the chain and pulled the door open.
“No, you can’t
It started with a whirlwind shower, with hair washed and teeth brushed in record time. Then came the dressing, where each article of clothing is selected carefully held up next to each other, styled to perfection, a flick of his wand switching items in and out. His hair is taken care of by a couple of spells – something I
“oh yeah because its been so hard for you hasn’t it? Oh yeah, that whole year you spent camping? A whole year? Really, Ron? Because I remember you going home for at least half of it because, as you said it’s a
“Pumpkin pasty? Liquorice wand?” Draco pulled more sweets out of his trunk and suddenly Harry was back in first year, sat with Ron gorging on confectionary, taste buds exploding as he eat more sugar than in his whole life put together. Harry smiled and remembered how entranced he was with the Chocolate Frog cards, effectively his first encounter with Dumbledore.
“Give me time? I’m trying to help him, really I am” She sniffed and stepped back and wiped her nose on the back of her hand.
me to fight Voldemort and once that was done, I meant
Harry looked at him bewildered as Neville shook his head and began again,
“what was it then, smartass?” Harry challenged him, but all he can do is snicker.
He picked it up and hauled it to the front room of No. 12 Grimmauld Place. What little sunlight made it through was pale and watery, bathing everything in a dream like glow. The house had been his godfathers and now it was the ministry’s; stripped of anything remotely related to Voldemort and sterilised so it no longer held even the faintest trace Sirius. If it had ever felt like home, it certainly didn’t now.
The Weasleys were stood about 10 feet from him, bag and baggage gathered round them. Harry looked round desperately for Draco, but of course he’s gone, melted in to the crowd of people like a mirage. 'I shouldn't expect him to mother me' Harry chastised himself angrily. Pulling his coat closer to hide the now oversized shirt, he began to make his way towards them. Over the heads of his siblings Ron spots him and begins to push his way through, dragging Hermione with him.
‘Well, see you there!’ He waved, beamed, and walked jauntily out of the hall, joining Luna by the door, who also waved back at Harry.
‘Yes, now, you
“sorry, but you can’t have needed almost
“Hey Harry!” Hermione answered cheerfully, Ron just nodding in Harry's general direction.
Draco was surprisingly strong and overpowered Harry's feeble attempt at resistance easily; he placed both hands on Harry's shoulders and pushed him back down on to the bench.
Draco snorted and began pointing at the top of the sheet. ‘Sheet music, it’s like instructions of what to play. So the numbers mean the time signature and those symbols are…’ he rose up and twisted round to get a better look, bracing himself with a strong arm next to Harry’s resting elbow. ‘Sharps and flats, the key signature so I know what kind of notes I guess. And the actual shapes on the line show the value. Minims and crotchets and the like.’
Again, there’s silence, but he carried on pulling bottles out of his trunk and moved to sit next to Harry.
He laughed nervously but Ron just shook his head and stalked out of the compartment, robes swishing behind him.
“Where did you go?” Ron asked in a low voice.
. I’m sorry, but when you were eleven Ron, you were most worried about what it was for dinner or your potions homework. It’s like I’ve had a tiny monster on my back, directing my life, not letting me choose how to end each year, how to end my life. I’ve never been allowed to be normal!” He sat back, breathless and realised he'd been shouting, the rawness in his throat a painful reminder;
‘Thanks Longbottom, that’s really kind and we appreciate it’ He smiled warmly and Neville nodded, getting up, hands in pockets.
‘Of course Neville that would be so good, um could I ask wha-’ He was about to ask what on earth Neville meant by they didn’t agree with Ron but Draco cut across him.
A few weeks in they were sat in companionable silence during one of their frees when Harry began rummaging about under his bed and pulled out a suitcase shaped black case. Draco was nonplussed until a cardboard box of dog-eared records followed it. Harry pulled it up onto his bed, and began leafing through them humming softly under his breath.
He turned and waited for the impatient knock at the door.
“Knock knock?” He asked, and tried not to laugh at the flushed complexion of the couple.
'Sorry Hermione, Harry's not in at the moment' He lied, looking at the curly haired witch standing indignantly outside their room.
and love. He hated it. He could feel the pity through the fucking paper.
He walks past me into the bathroom unbuttoning his pyjama top, the picture of efficiency. I barely have time to nod before I hear the shower turn on and the Draco Malfoy Morning Routine began. I’ve never seen anything so well-organised. Whilst I am a get-up-with-plenty-of-time to take it slow, Draco had his mornings down to a fine art, with no room for distraction.
“Jesus Malfoy, I’m not a dog!” Harry was so angry at him, he shouldn’t have done that.
Harry and Draco walked together to dinner that day, Draco babbling on about Paganini and his 24 caprices, about how he had apparently sold his soul to the devil in return for musical genius.
He glances at me before rummaging in his own trunk fishing out two cups and a sachet of something. I get up and grope my way to the bathroom, rubbing the sweaty gunk out of my eyes. Bloodshot eyes stare back at me and I realise that the feeling in my eyes had been my fingers pulling and tugging in the sockets. Scared I move away from the mirror and stumble back into the room.
Neither of them had spoken yet, and Harry didn’t want to break the kind of soft silence that had fallen after Draco’s music – something that had felt like a reveal in kind.
Harry just stared at him, having understood nothing of what he had just heard.
He looked so awful when I pulled back the hangings of his bed that I’m surprised he could even get up. He was pale, beads of sweat glistening on his forehead, as he grabbed at my hands, babbling, fingers squeezing tighter and tighter.
He still looks ghastly, but the chocolate seems to be reviving him, and I make a mental note to thank Moony for that invaluable tip. He crawls back in to bed, pulling the covers up to his chest, and resting his hands, cupped around his mug, on his knees. He sighs and scrunches up his eyes and nose, inhaling the scent, before downing the mug and shuffling down in the bed.
Harry couldn't help but smile, because at last he hadn't had to spend the last half hour explaining or trying to justify himself.
‘Hiya poncy boy,’ Harry grinned back and picked up one of the many papers. ‘What is this stuff anyway?’
He began to sit up, just in time for him to watch as Draco lifted the violin to his shoulder, eyes shut. The violin nestled there, becoming an extension of Draco, his bow another arm, and he looked more comfortable and at home than Harry had ever seen him. There was a red tinge high on his cheekbones and his hands shook slightly as he composed himself, puffing his cheeks as he took a deep breath.
? Not, that I got any choice in the matter. No qualifications for me. No! I couldn’t because yet again, Dumbledore didn’t mean for it to pan out like that. Neither of you get, that I had nothing worth living for. There was nothing, nobody to make me get up, so eventually? I stopped trying. I stopped getting up. I stopped cooking because I wasn’t going to eat it. I just shut down for a bit. It took me so long to get out of the door this morning. I wasn’t going to come, I asked for assistance to get to Hogwarts, did you know? I didn’t trust myself.
“There can’t be anything that bad underneath, Potter! Trust me, I’ve seen it all!”
“What?”
“Open up Harry, I know you’re avoiding me because of Ron but come on!” Ah. Granger.
He smiled, and Harry couldn’t help but smile back, because weirdly enough, Draco Malfoy had cheered him up a bit.
"I needed the kindling," said Draco airily, wrinkling his nose in distaste when he saw his dusting efforts were only spreading more wall plaster all over himself. Potter gaped at him.
"NOW!"
(page is snatched, voices rise in volume)
“When was the last time you
"But-"
He nearly jumped out of his skin when something heavy bumped against his leg. Draco spun around quickly, only to find his daft dog staring back at him. He looked as soggy and miserable as Draco felt, and was covered in mud. Draco sighed.
Chapter two.
“So, in short, you don’t know what the hell you did. As usual.” Draco bristled at that.
“Piss off, Malfoy. I don’t see your report enlightening us all over why magic doesn’t work on this bloke properly.” he spat. Draco’s head snapped up, and if Harry didn’t know any better, he would swear Draco looked confused at Harry’s show of hostility. But almost instantly Malfoy’s face shuttered down, and his usual sneer was back in place.
Happy reading! =D
“But here’s the thing, I don’t think there is.” Hermione gave an apologetic look to Harry. “Think about it. The house is Unplottable, under the Fidelius Charm. Blood magic would already shield Draco, to begin with. And Harry, you added a
“It’s a deathtrap, mate. One of the faucets tried to bite my hand last week,” Weasley
“Yeah, alright,” sighed Potter, shoulders sagging. “But what about the roof here?”
Harry did file a report. Ron snorted loudly at Harry’s description of being pursued by a large, hooded man in the middle of the night.
Potter looked about ready to tear his hair out and both his friends were snickering. Blaise patted Potter's arm amicably:
“No! Why, I never! Absolutely not!”
“Dinner in thirty minutes,” he said.
Whimper number two.
“We apparated first.” Harry pointed out. He was giving the little girl a besotted smile that thoroughly disgusted Draco. “He followed us.”
you are,” said Malfoy, giving the dog an exasperated grin. “Stupid mongrel, I should have left you to fend for yourself this morning.” he scratched the dog’s ears and turned towards a thunderstruck Harry “I’m ready.”
“Do you know who that is?” Harry asked, tilting his head to the side when the Grim started growling.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well, then what are going to do with the roof? You have to stay here, you're on house arrest!"
“What wounds?” interrupted Hermione.
“Oh,” Draco rubbed his eyes. “I was going to turn them into dung beetles and put them in a terrarium. In the winter garden.” He shrugged. Harry gave a surprised laugh at that.
PS: For all your claims of hating my “metal monstrosity”, I didn’t quite see you complaining last night when I fucked you on it.
“I… Oh my God,” he groaned, hiding his face behind his hands. Draco got up, rubbing his backside and nodding.
a frantic voice, vaguely familiar, boomed through the forest, coming from everywhere and nowhere. Harry frowned at his surroundings, still feeling calm and detached from the whole thing. The Grim stood up, towering over Harry, who continued to just sit still and bleed.
After dinner, Harry and Draco would sit down on whatever room seemed the warmest that night, and slowly go through books and case files – Hermione had suggested they looked for precedents on the Auror’s archive. They fell into a bizarre routine, which was mostly based on tetchy comments with no real bite, lots of tea, and no progress on the case.
Well. That answered the question.
“Not another fucking word, I’ll
“It’s time to come clean, old chap. No pun intended.”
“Indeed, Father is a wanker. Yes, there is a war coming, and it doesn’t bode well for you. But never fear, because one day, you magnificent young man... one day you will enter a muggle club and find Harry Potter dancing to Kung Fu Fighting, and it will all be worth it.”
a delight to look at.”
Harry woke slowly, aware someone was shaking him, but not being quite successful in opening his eyes. He groaned, feeling sore and weak as if he’d suffered some terrible accident. His whole body was shaking and covered in a cold sweat. He could feel his heart beating at a frantic, unnatural pace.
They stared at each other, Potter still gasping, the nightmare lingering in his wide eyes.
“Yes.” Astoria tilted her head and arched a brow, seeming amused. Draco actually
“Grimmauld Place.” sighed Hermione, and Harry’s face took the mulish appearance they were all familiar with.
"Alright. Cheers." – Bill grinned and was gone the next second.
“What the hell?” he croaked. The dog, deeming his job done, stopped his sad noises and settled down next to Harry, head on his lap.
about the Dursleys?”
“Well, if you’re going to break into song over Potter’s sainthood, by all means, don’t let me keep you,” he made to get up from his chair. Healer Hall actually rolled his eyes. The sheer
“Not my fault you’re so easy to rile up. Although I am an expert, of course.”
“What’s the matter? Someone needs to do something, it’s a scandal Dumbledore allowed this-”
“Right. I’m sorry about that. Everything sets me off these days.”
Also, I have absolutely no clue what the devil those British guys are using to measure distance now. Yards, miles? So I stuck to my good friend meter. If someone knows the proper terminology, I'd love to learn it.
"If you weren't behaving like a barmy old bat, I wouldn't have called your nanny."
and-"
“Hm… Is he…?” Draco could just
It was enough to give him the vapors. Draco hid his face behind his hands and peeped through his fingers. It was a bit like watching two trains crash. One just couldn’t look away.
"Put your back to my back," he said slowly, over-enunciating the words. "It's not that hard."
“No, it wasn’t,” said Draco, voice strangled, and grabbed hold of one of Harry’s arms.
Kapo_de_uva, don't worry, I'm finishing this story. I made a bet with myself, can't give up.
“Pervert or not, he was not following us both. He was following
? You’re the Auror!”
“If he wasn’t always sneaking around trying to feed you, Potter, maybe he would have enough time to
“What I do know Potter, is that no
I’ll make it look like an accident! I’ll-” raged Draco, struggling to get up. Harry wrapped his arms around him, fighting to keep Draco still, laughing so hard actual fucking tears were running down his eyes. The complete tosser.
"And get arrested for suspicious use of magic? No, thank you, Parkinson."
“Well then. Maybe it resented a buffoon painting its walls the most distressing colours.”
“Well if you must know, Potter,” Harry snorted at his annoyed tone and Draco rolled his eyes. “It was last year. Things were bad at the Manor. You know.”
A loud
“Potter I can’t see why you just won’t admit that-”
If Harry or Draco thought about each other at all in those two years, it doesn’t bear remarking.
in here, it’s fine. It’s… home.” Harry finished uncertainly when everyone in the bedroom looked at him like he was dim-witted. “Whatever.” He grumbled, crossing his arms.
signature.” Draco pointed out disagreeably. Harry rolled his eyes but nodded.
"You!" Draco pointed a trembling finger at his nemesis. "You are a menace! You are the root of the expression: 'No good deed goes unpunished!'"
“Why are you here ruining my bath?” Blaise leaned over, jaw resting on his hands, grinning like that weird Muggle Cheshire Cat.
you get when they talk about me?”
Thanks for reading! Comments make my day =)
He bumped his shoulder hard against Potter's and left the drawing room in a huff.
“Excuse me!” Harry protested crossly. “When have I ever dragged you down anywhere?”
“No,” he repeated hotly. Ron tugged the baby from his arms, whispering something about ‘no squeezing my offspring to death.’
A horrified yell. “Stop being such a sentimental sap, you fool, I’m too hungover for this shit, ugh, why did I ever marry you—”
Harry told him about their plans later that night when they were in the kitchen. Harry was sitting by the table sipping butterbeer while Draco supervised a bunch of knives cutting vegetables. Harry could offer to help, but he was well aware that he would just get in the way. He knew a little about cooking from his years with the Dursleys, but Draco had a very wizarding approach to the whole thing, spells zapping everywhere, and Harry couldn’t be bothered to learn how to do things his way.
Draco opened his eyes to gentle sunlight streaming through the library windows. He sighed in contentment, watching the flecks of dust lazily playing in the light. He was warm and cosy and…
“What, pray tell, are you all talking about?” Draco asked in a clipped tone.
“Kreacher will be preparing the masters’ breakfast tomorrow morning at 7.” The elf stated, rather peevishly, if Harry could say so.
In spite of all this, Potter had proceeded to merrily invite more Gryffindors over, each one bringing an assortment of supplies he deemed necessary. The day carried on in a mind-boggling succession of unlikely visitors. Draco became convinced at some point that he was just having a freakishly long nightmare. No cause for anxiety, he just had to be patient. Any minute now, he was certain, Nagini would come sliding through one of the corridors, and he would wake up shaking in his bed as usual.
"Er Potter, have you ever wondered about you temper? I know this
"I'm trying to help you, you unbelievable prat!" Potter yelled, angrily getting back to bed. "Why do you have to make everything so difficult?! And
While Potter gasped next to him, pointing his wand in every direction, and scrambling for his glasses, Draco turned to look behind himself. Sir Brutus Malfoy was now shrieking and shaking a parchment angrily in their direction. His portrait hung skewed and his blond eyebrows were distinctly singed.
“You have wards against ghosts?” Draco shot Harry a confused look. “
“You can’t imagine? Didn’t he just take over your house?”
“Wonders will never cease.” drawled Draco. Harry crossed his arms and muttered some expletives under his breath.
"Right," Potter rubbed his forehead in annoyance and sighed. "Malfoy, you know I'm supposed to keep an eye on you. It's on the terms of…"
The next night, Draco woke up in a cold sweat, utterly sure he was
Ron glowered, but Draco just arched one eyebrow, disdain written on his face. Harry met Hermione’s eyes with amusement.
“Whatever Malfoy, as if you never-” Harry started, feeling very inclined to begin another row, when Draco’s hand closed around his wrist.
“Well, you left in quite a hurry, I wasn’t sure what to do. Are you alright?”
“Ohh, is it making fun of Potter time?” Came a delighted voice from the door. Pansy was walking in with a mocking smile, Blaise following close behind. “Did you cover the glasses?”
“I ought to arrest you anyway.” Draco extended his wrists in Harry’s direction, one blond eyebrow raised in defiance.
“I should have never said anything. You are a Merlin forsaken nuisance, Harry Potter.” Draco started to get off the bed, angrily doing up the buttons of his trousers. Harry grabbed his wrist, now openly snickering.
Draco took petty delight in transfiguring the lumpiest, most uncomfortable armchair he could get his hands on into a bed for Potter. They had agreed, after much back and forth, that it was probably safest to stay in the library, as it was the furthest away from the disaster area.
Their eyes met for a long moment and Draco felt his resolve crumbling. He took a deep breath and scooched to the far end of his bed, pointedly raising his covers. Harry was lying by his side almost instantly.

"I'll
Mind Healer…"
“I’m fairly certain it will make our ears explode when it gets to twelve counts.” Harry made a protesting noise at this nonchalant answer.
While Draco busied himself stacking his parcels on the top of a long desk, Harry leaned back on his seat and took in the differences in the room for the first time. The whole… office, Harry supposed, was decorated in soothing tones of cream and blue. Harry was pretty sure this particular room had been painted a mildly traumatizing shade of yellow by Luna a few years back. Something about combating a creature that caused depression.
“Potter!”
Harry and Draco, sticking to true form, would never agree on how the whole thing had started. Harry insisted vehemently that it began in a dark stormy night, with his heart breaking.
Harry turned his head to find Draco sprawled on an armchair still on his pyjamas, looking sleep-deprived but otherwise unharmed.
Of course, I wouldn’t tell him about you ogling my arse like a heathen, that would probably offend his delicate sensibilities. I was such a genteel fellow in my youth.
"My probation. Yes, Saint Potty, I know," Draco interrupted, feeling mildly consoled when he saw a muscle ticking angrily in Potter's jaw. He got to his feet and started dusting his clothes.
Anyway. I love you, even if you’re an infuriating little git in the mornings. As for my wedding present to you… I sure hope you find the idea of revenge appealing. Because I’ve got a few pictures of last night after you got spectacularly smashed at your own wedding and I suppose you’ll be wanting them back, especially after you remember exactly what you got up to. (Stripping ring a bell to you? Pole dancing?)
That particular night witnessed one of the biggest arguments Harry had ever had in his life, which was really saying something if you consider who we’re talking about.
The creature showed up in his yard one afternoon, out of nowhere, looking mournful and quite pathetic with his knotted, filthy fur and big sad eyes. It sat very still, strategically positioned so that Draco would spot him out the window every time he went into his kitchen.
Draco blinked at what he just said and amended awkwardly:
“No, wait. It’s just that you are such a
It was irreversibly stuck. Spells had been cast, tantrums thrown (See what you did,
Hello!
Potter stared wide eyed at him.
“Don’t call me that,” Harry growled, but all he got as an answer was a disdainful look Draco sent from over his shoulder.
Draco sat up, interested. It seemed as if Weasley was on the brink of a fainting spell.
“I’ve been thinking about the case,” Harry said eventually. Draco just raised an eyebrow in question, delicately wiping his mouth before taking another sip of his drink. “Made a list of who could have held a grudge against me two years ago.”
“I took the chambers across your room,” he said, and Harry paused for a second at the use of the plural term before deciding maybe it was best he didn’t know.
Hello!
The dog came to greet him while Harry made his way up the stairs to 'Draco's rooms’. Harry sent the animal an annoyed glance.
, Draco had no idea who he was, he
“Draco. You fancy him.”
Hello =D
“As the stables were occupied,
And even now, as I’m lying next to you (my husband! You’re my husband, Malfoy-Potter, how does that feel?) I can’t help but smile. You’re everything I’ve ever wanted. You’re everything I will ever want, and I can’t wait to start this new journey of our lives toge—
“Why didn’t you say so?” Potter asked, bemused.
“Now is not the time- Fuck!
“Well. All right then. Potter, I found a way to repay you.” He declared, trying to look poised. Harry narrowed his eyes at him.
“This is not funny, Pot-
Blaise sat chuckling in the chair, legs elegantly crossed. (Yes, Draco did have a chair in his bathroom. He was a firm believer of leisuring his way through morning routines, thank you very much).
“We didn’t fight in a war just so you stupid boys could die from a candle attack,” she’d said firmly.
weren’t really a ringing endorsement of your hilarity.
I’m writing this to you from our hotel room, on that little notepad they leave out for guests to use as you snore beside me. God. You’re so beautiful in the mornings when the sunlight hits you just right and makes you look like some sort of aristocratic prince. Of course, that’s only because you’re asleep and can’t open your big mouth to tell me to shut up.
“Erm… Maybe we can just finish fixing your roof, and go from there?” Harry suggested, looking at Draco oddly. Draco sniffed at that bourgeoise plan, but nodded his head.
“Indeed. The One-Eyed Trouser Snake murder attempt.” Healer Hall blinked.
“The… bed?”
It is really a shame that a time turner cannot be found nowadays for love nor money, for I would truly relish going back to my sixteen-year-old self and telling him:
“Why would Harry- ah, you mean your dog. This is too confusing, can’t we call him something else? Ow!” Ron sent Hermione a disgruntled look over being pinched into silence.
“Could you even find your wand if you wanted to hex me?” Draco made a rude gesture in response.
“Draco? Is that you?” came a melodic voice from the kitchen. Draco quickly gripped Harry’s wrist to prevent the Auror from attacking. A slender woman dressed in casual clothes entered the living room. Blonde, with delicate features and a kind face, she didn’t fit at all with Harry’s conception of what any friend of Malfoy should look like.
"S'good," Potter mumbled sleepily. "How'd you know?"
They squabbled all the way to the atrium. Harry’s reaction to the dog news was a hearty laugh and a: “Yeah, good one Malfoy.”, to which Draco had taken great offence. Why couldn’t he have a dog? Was there some sort of law disputing a Malfoy’s right to own a mammal? Harry called him an oversensitive prat, Draco accused him of chronic idiocy and they almost forgot about the time limit hanging over their heads when Draco finally side-alonged Harry to his house.
“Be that as it may, I’m not your hostage,” Draco said, and arched a brow when Harry turned to scowl at him.
"POTTER!"
“What did you do with the rug that Uncle Pollux brought from France?”, and:
!” he exclaimed, sounding thoroughly outraged.
“I’ve had quite enough of your bumbling assistance, I wish to go home and proceed on my own.”
They were sitting around a table in the drawing room. Ron Weasley had brought yet another basket, only this time with an appalling amount of breakfast goods that were already divided into individual portions. Or what Mrs. Weasley figured that an individual should have as a portion.
I have to admit, when you’re not being the sarcastic git you are, you’re actually quite funny. You’re going to say something like,
“Granger, I’m very sorry, but my manicure must-”
“Anyway. Sometimes I… In order to sleep, sometimes I would drag my bed against the wall. And I pretended you were there, and that you were watching my back.”
Potter, I hate you,” and then lock yourself in the bathroom to cry because, despite all your bluster, you’re just as sensitive as Hermione when she gets the sniffles. At least she has a reason.
, I mean Potter,” said Draco distractedly, still looking around. “Potter, now!”
“Tory. What are you doing here? It’s not safe.” Draco admonished even as he embraced her. Harry averted his eyes, feeling inexplicably uncomfortable by this show of affection coming from Draco. Even his usual haughty tone had mellowed to something almost sweet.
. Ron laughed at him and got up to give Hermione the bottle. But by then the baby had lost her patience and started crying wholeheartedly, refusing milk or comfort.
They made good on their agreement. For the next two years, Draco and Harry avoided each other with unrelenting commitment, going as far as faking illnesses and hiding in dusty storerooms just to not say hello on the Ministry’s corridors.
“That’s different and you know it! And my plans didn’t involve murder!”
Harry half froze when a grim shape materialized not a hundred meters away, blocking one side of the backstreet. He was huge and emanated cold menace even with his face completely hidden under the hood. Harry watched spellbound as a ghostly pale hand slowly reached behind the cloak. The streetlamp next to the alley entrance flickered and went out. Harry snapped out of his trance.
“Good Salazar, no! Astoria has her own lands. They’re close to the Manor, actually.”
"Absolutely, I'll start right away."
don’t get to talk about Dumbledore-”
Draco bloody Malfoy worked far too many cases. Harry stumbled out of the floo, grumbling to himself. He was carrying at least five different packages. Packages that he could not shrink, according to the horrified secretary back at the Office for the Removal of Curses, Jinxes, and Hexes. He cussed when one of them fell to the floor. Again.
“Traitor,” Ron grumbled at his daughter, making a face. “We get the wailing demon; he gets the sweet angel.”
“No. What assassination plan was that?” Draco huffed and tapped his fingers on the side of the armchair.
Scared?
“Not this Divination nonsense again, Ronald. But Harry, I don’t think that was a nightmare either.”
Immediately after the war, he would wake up from one of those – and plenty others – screaming and shaking uncontrollably. But as the years went by, the dreams started to change. There wouldn’t be people dying around him, no sluggish legs that refused to allow him to run and save his loved ones. No terror, no hurt. Just a stroll around the places where Harry had lost something. Deserted sets from a terrible play. Harry learned to just go with these dreams.
She looked sharply at Ron when the man sniggered.
"Kitchen! If I cannot demolish this place, I might as well have some tea,” he reached the stairs and started jumping down the steps two at a time in his rush to get away. "You can leave Potter, you made your point. The Manor will prevail."
“A little after four. You were down for a couple of hours.”
“That’s creepy.” Said Ron, still watching his daughter over where Harry was standing. “Although, we trace apparations all the time. Maybe he can do it too.”
.” Harry glowered at Draco, but the other man just crossed his arms stubbornly. Now that Draco wasn’t focused on his impending demise, the cold was really getting to him.
, for the love of Salazar,
The end =D
It was a soothing motion, really. Bizarre, but soothing. It should be uncomfortable. All their physical interaction up until now had involved fistfights, near-death situations, and stumbling around half asleep. There’d been none of this skin-to-skin contact. Ever. Though Harry supposed the whole evening’s debacle could in fact be considered life-threatening, even if not immediately so.
“Heart disease. But it would take too long, so he gave up.”
“Huh,” Draco grunted, pretending nonchalance that he was far from feeling. “Did it work then?”
" Draco spluttered.

Thanks for reading everybody!
“We are not the
When he actually found himself alone in his bed though, sleep abruptly disappeared. Harry stared at the ceiling, the image of Draco wet and completely naked intruding insistently on his thoughts. He looked… Harry sighed and ignored the little thrill going down his spine. He was fit, Harry supposed. Nothing wrong with admitting that. And if he was feeling weird… well. He probably just needed a shag, Harry reasoned with himself. That was all.
“Why not?” asked Harry. “It makes sense!”
“I know you’re not. But still.” Hermione relented, squeezing Harry’s hand. She switched baby Rose from one hip to another. Harry had interrupted her morning feed, and the little girl was none too pleased. Ron was now frantically preparing her another bottle over Harry’s desk while Draco observed, nose slightly wrinkled in distaste. “So, let’s go over this again. You were both being followed by an unknown person wearing a long black cape with a hood.”
“The hair?”
yellow.”
Draco tried to scoot forward inconspicuously, in a bid to get closer to Ronald. Best mates were supposed to have this kind of information at hand, right? He scowled at the amused look Blaise shot him, trying to express to him the general feeling of ‘piss off’. The effectiveness of this was debatable, seeing as the bastard winked at him. He turned back around and found that Ronald was looking at him most suspiciously.
I just knew you were going to become a part of my life again, and I couldn’t wait. Even all of those excuses to meet you over and over to discuss the “blackmail” photos were just me trying to spend more time with you. I’m sure you knew that too, but it was always such fun to see your face when I tried new schemes to get them back. (Do you remember the one where Blaise got turned into a kitten and he kept licking his hands for weeks after? Pansy was so mad at us.)
“Hm. Black descendent. The house is being very accommodating.”
“Bellatrix,” Harry mumbled darkly, leaning against a wall, arms crossed. Draco’s jaw went slack for a few seconds, and he murmured a soft ‘
“Tea?” he offered, pushing the pot in Draco’s direction.
They eventually reached Harry’s bed. A lot of fumbling with belts and muffled curses followed their tumbling over the lumpy mattress, but at some point Harry found his bearings and gripped Draco
us in the next turn!” Draco nodded, and they ran faster, desperate to get to the other end of the narrow passage. Harry reached out his hand and Draco took it, letting himself be side-alonged.
A distressed Potter was still tossing and turning, only now he was also spluttering water out of his mouth and nose while cussing. Draco smiled broadly. It was such a heart-warming sight.
“…Really pushing the limits of a friendship, I mean…”
“You should come with a health hazard warning,” Harry stated. Draco just smirked. “I brought your new cases.”
“Right. I’m… I mean…”
“Draco…”
They didn’t find anything useful, but the room was warm and they gradually relaxed, Draco feeding his dog a piece of cake every now and then.
Chapter 1
“I’ll go wash up,” Harry said, feeling rather defeated. Draco was nowhere to be seen when Harry went down to have dinner.
“The evidence is staggering, I told you.”
Life went on. Ginny moved out of Grimmauld Place. Harry went on a cleaning and redecoration rampage, getting rid of all the unpleasant memories he had in that house. Christmas that year was a study in awkward silences. Easter actually had Ginny pelting chocolates at Harry, and Harry getting so mad that he had his first case of accidental magic in years. The situation reached calamitous levels; Molly had to intervene. Ron was grounded, Hermione ranted quite a lot and Percy ended up with blue hair for three days. Nevertheless, it would still be another six months until Ginny and Harry could stand to be in the same room without further catastrophe.
he got.
“What time is it?”
“What the sodding hell are you doing?” Asked Harry, hoarse, eyes quickly taking in all the maps, sketches and books surrounding Draco and Ron on the library’s floor. Draco supposed they must look quite the pair, all dusty and disheveled after an afternoon of research. In retrospect, it was surprising it had taken the others so long to find them.
Harry took another automatic step back, just in time for dog-Potter – who was running towards his master with surprising speed – to smack into him and use the momentum to jump on top of a newly horror-struck Malfoy.
“Fucking Gryffindor.”
"I… Well." Draco darted his own eyes around the drafty room, uneasy. Grasped for a derisive posture. "Look, I'm not
Maybe if he ignored it, Potter would eventually settle down.
“But he is not bent!” His therapist just continued to look at him calmly. “Is he?”
“Anyway,” Draco continued, “Astoria is sending a few books tomorrow. It will be good to go over them together. That is to say, it will be good for me and Hermione to go over them. You and Ronald can make tea and mind the baby.”
. I just happen to like the theory, that’s all.” Harry grumbled something under his breath.
I need to give credit here to my amazing beta, WtheB (got the reference?), who puts up with my nonsense and encourages me to write faster hahaha
But that wasn’t all. The room was bigger, lighter. Full of furniture he hadn’t known he owned. One wall was completely covered with books Harry had never seen before, and all sorts of trinkets and moving what-nots were sitting on top of various tables. Magic saturated the air, at some places twinged with dark hues that somehow didn’t frighten. It was almost comforting, Harry realized. Like greeting old friends.
"Alright, ferr- Er… Malfoy?" Weasley gave him a nod. "Harry?"
"Merlin, not this again. NO!"
“I didn’t tamper, I omitted!” Harry exclaimed, slightly hurt. “I’m not corrupt.”
“… and then, we can just
Potter
! I won’t reenact this horrible play with you, Harry! The red-headed girl and the messy-haired boy-!”
“But- But you’re engaged.”
“Isn’t summer a reasonable cause for red cheeks?”
“Yes. That was when he tried to kill me from mortification.”
“My signature.”
“Oh, grow up, all of you,” said Hermione impatiently, with a roll of her eyes. “Since you’re both here, you will help us with the restoration.”
“What did you do?” he asked, and Draco rolled his eyes.
“Potter! Now!”
"I'm doing you a
“I could have done that!” Harry said, irritated, even as his sight improved tremendously now that his lenses weren’t fogged up or half blocked by little rivers of water. Draco scoffed derisively.
But as he got closer, he saw it wasn’t Sirius at all. This dog was much bigger, with fur cropped closely to his skin. It was lying on the exact spot Harry had fallen and opened yellow eyes that glowed eerily when Harry sat by his side. They faced each other for a while, and Harry took in the way the dog almost shimmered in the dark forest as if it weren’t entirely there.
“You can help me with it next year,” Harry said, pulling Draco closer.
“…Yeah, okay.”
Hello!
“To get to you,” Harry concluded. Draco’s chin went up and something Harry couldn't quite place darkened his eyes for a second. He assumed that haughty, cold posture of his and said:
“What?” Harry asked, uneasy, but she just shook her head.
He couldn’t really talk until his second cup, and Harry came to understand that the tense moments those first few mornings were more about Draco’s incapability of making sense before ten o’clock, and less about any lingering resentments.
"Merlin's wrinkly
“Well, tough, Malfoy. I’m the primary Auror on your case, and I say you stay.”
“Nothing!” Harry exclaimed, putting his hands up. “Nothing, honest. Yes, she can send you whatever you like, it’s… fine.” He finished the sentence with a wince. Draco studied him, shoulders very straight and tense. The easy mood they’d been sharing vanished.
“Sit down, Draco,” the man sighed, shaking his head. They were meeting in a small office on some forsaken part of the Manor. Draco had spent a good 15 minutes putting up privacy charms on the doors. The thought of the Golden Trio listening in on his session actually made his stomach roll.
Another time, he hadn’t even managed to take his auror’s robes off before Kreacher grabbed his hands and dragged him off, sobbing: ‘Master needs to save the other Master! He is falling to his death, he is!’
"No,” he said simply. "Where is the kitchen?"
thank you so much for going on this little journey with us! we had a brilliant time, and getting to know the person behind the letters was even more exciting!
“I think you trying to kill him made him angry,” said Ron, nodding his head sagely.
“You named your dog after me!” Harry exploded, this time red with fury. “Bloody hell Malfoy, what is
“NOBODY HAS THE RIGHT TO TREAT YOU LIKE THIS. YOU’RE TOO IMPORTANT.”
“Harry? Malfoy? I brought the cavalry.”
Have a great weekend!
“Idiot,” Harry said but found himself smiling.
“Voldemort…?” he asked hesitantly.
Potter looked down at his crotch. He opened and closed his mouth in mortified astonishment for a few seconds, taking in his very happy privates.
“That is none of your fucking business Malfoy! It’s my life, my bloody relatives!” Harry yelled back and Draco threw his hands in the air.
“And blushing.”
"Circe's saggy tits!" Draco wheezed to himself, clambering out of the bed in a mad dash that somehow caused him to fall hard on his behind. "Fuck!"
“He spent an awful amount of time gazing at you.”
"I'm going to use the pieces as tinder," Draco continued cheerfully, voice far away as he rummaged around the bottom of the roof, one lone strand of pale hair sticking out and signalling his position.
“The wards are protecting the house, Master Harry. They was weak for a while, but then Master Draco saved us.” Kreacher looked at Draco with obvious adoration. “Master Draco is being wise as he is handsome, Master Harry, like a true Black.”
“Kreacher-”
“Not worth the risk.” Draco shrugged.
“We had a somewhat distressing morning, that’s all,” Draco said in a lofty tone. And when Blaise raised an eyebrow: “Desist, Zabini! There is nothing between me and Potter!”
"A lesson?!"
"Malfoy, what?-"
The war had seen the Malfoy name in the gutter. Vaults frozen, Father imprisoned (that one was actually the only perk), Mother in tears banished to Toulouse, and Draco… Well. Draco was on house arrest until the start of term at Hogwarts, where he was required to take his NEWTS, as per one of the interminable clauses of his probation. Living until then on a meagre allowance that barely put food on the table.
in his direction.
“Oh Harry,” she sent him a sympathetic look “I just thought it was too much at the time. We were all dealing with the aftermath of the war. Ron, you were in no state to talk at all until July. And Harry, you know how you get when we talk about Draco.”
And then it was night-time, and Potter disappeared for a while.
"That's why you never shook my hand, isn't it?"
A lot of bickering ensued.
Harry sighed to himself and scratched distractedly behind Potter’s ears. Draco had adamantly refused to say anything more since he’d woken up and had left to change his clothes once
"Shut up, Malfoy," grumbled his most unwelcome visitor, rubbing his eyes tiredly.
A Dragonpox on Harry Potter and his disruptive ways, Draco thought to himself after Blaise had left him to finish his bath in sullen resentment. Why did he have to change the dynamics of their respectful rivalry with favours and fascinating morning woods?
"It's very rude to mutter, you know. A gentleman should speak his insults in a clear tone."
nightmares.
“He’s back,” Draco said, getting straight to the point. Harry tilted his head a bit, giving Draco a curious look that clearly evaluated, if not his mental soundness, at the very least his sober status.
“Harry, how could you? Tampering with official forms, you know better than that. It’s the same kind of corruption we’ve been
“The Manor’s wards are… not broken, precisely, but with all that dark magic… I don’t know.”
"Fix it? There's no fixing this
“Here, asshole,” said Ron, coming through in a flare of green. “Fuck Harry, you look like shite.”
“Weren’t there vows of never sleeping at Malfoy Manor again and leaving me to starvation last night, Potter? Please, don’t break your word on my account.” Potter shuffled around, stuffing his hands in his pockets.
“Yes. Would you say, given his upbringing and natural inclinations, that he… Is he… Normally, I mean, does he like…” Was Draco rambling? He suspected he was rambling. “Because it’s appalling, you understand, but some were raised in a certain way and afterwards…”
welcome, do you understand?"
Dear Draco,
, and it was rather aggravating.
“Weekend study group.”
“We’re coming through,” said Hermione firmly, and then did just that.
“Didn’t we agree to never meet again?” Harry asked, running a hand through his hair in a half-hearted attempt to get it into a semblance of order.
He came back at the end of the day to alarming noises coming from the kitchen. The dog was napping in the hallway, almost completely camouflaged in the dim light. He thumped his tail on the floor in silent greeting and closed his eyes again, not even stirring when a loud crash came from behind the door. With all the weariness he would normally save for entering a vicious ringleader hide-out, Harry poked his head around the door to evaluate the situation.
"How the fuck do you know about Indian headdresses, you bloody lunatic? Can't we just

Chapter four.
He pondered to himself, feeling vaguely nauseous, how exactly was it that his life had suddenly been taken over by a bunch of overly eager do-gooders.  He just wanted to brood away his probation time all by himself, was that too much to ask?
“I can’t hear you,” Draco shouted obnoxiously while forking a piece of pie. Harry flopped to his own bed and crossed his arms. They fell into silence. Draco figured it was only gracious of him to give Harr-
"What sodding food?"

He went about his life in the tiny house he had bought in London a couple of years ago. He went about his job as a curse breaker and a consultant for the Ministry of Magic. He didn’t worry about any dogs.
“Merlin save me from sappy Gryffindors.” Draco scoffed and rolled his eyes before going back to cooking.
Harry shook his head again and then pointed at the incriminating pile of paper still scattered on the floor. “What’s all this then?”
“Well. It looks like we have some research to do.” Hermione said in a matter-of-fact tone after a while. “In the meantime, Draco needs a safe place to stay. So far wards worked against this mystery person, so at least we have that.”
“Harry?” a panicked voice whispered, and there were hands on his face, pushing his hair back, rubbing his temples. “Can you hear me?”
him?" Pansy's last question was directed at Blaise.
“I don’t think so.”
While Draco was disparaging himself over his stupid,
“It’s a short list.” Harry exhaled, frustrated, playing with a loose thread on the tablecloth. “Most of the Death Eaters had been caught and imprisoned by then. I wasn’t working on any big cases that I can think of. Nobody I arrested had been released. I don’t know.”
(See the end of the chapter for
idea of looking for a mostly black dog
They sat side by side, not interacting, and after a couple of minutes, Harry noticed that he was rapidly bleeding into the forest’s ground. He checked himself for wounds, distantly curious, but found nothing out of place. Nothing hurt. His blood was just leaving his body out of its own volition.
“Potter.” Draco sneered. He rolled his eyes. “Of course.”
"Are you going to fix the roof?" Draco rolled his eyes at the stupid question. As if he had the money.
“Where did you get this?” asked Hermione, gingerly holding up a muggle blueprint.  Draco cleared his throat and got to his feet.
“Do you
On the other hand, Potter, already frighteningly furious to begin with, had worked himself up into a rage. Magic crackled and zapped everywhere, and Draco had witnessed the demise of more than one of his mother's priceless vases in detached stupor.
“When was the last time you stood by my side and felt happy?”
“Blaise would wake me up two hours earlier and make me take a cold shower every morning. Father’s orders.” Draco said, giving up on the biscuit and pillowing his head between his arms. The rules of pureblood etiquette while on the table, Harry noted, didn’t apply for mornings. Draco lifted a finger and shook it vaguely in Harry’s direction:
See you,
Weasley, who was distractedly trying to scratch his nose in the handle of one of the baskets, started to snicker.
“Up yours, Potter! I’m not going to Azkaban for not protecting the Saviour.
“There was this

"Cease this nonsense at once!" he shrieked. "I will
the barely concealed gazes of the others in their direction. There would be no end to the teasing from Zabini. He would taunt him forever.
“How are you feeling?”
“Master Harry will not be putting the House of Black in scandal when we are having guests.” Kreacher continued determinedly, throwing Harry a dirty look before disappearing. Harry gaped after the elf’s back and then snuck a look at Draco. The man was in the process of hiding a smirk behind his glass.
“The Weaselete not doing a good job then, eh?” Draco leered at him.  Potter made a face.
"You needed the what?"
Morning light found them both sullen and subdued. Kreacher had indeed prepared an over-the-top breakfast and called both men down to eat at seven on the dot. Draco, for all his high levels of activity at the break of dawn the day before, seemed to be decidedly not a morning person. He dragged himself down, still wrapped in a robe, and stared listlessly at the empty plate before him.
“Ow!” came a loud yelp, and Harry fell to the ground in a heap of twisted limbs. Startled, he let out a shock of red sparks from his wand, and whoever was entangled with him released another cry.
, no signs of dark magic. Harry scratched the back of his neck, scanning the empty street one last time. Nothing about the whole situation made any sense. Plus, Malfoy was right, the git. He had no evidence, no body, no way to even make sure that somebody had been after them in the first place. He could charge Malfoy with the use of an Unforgivable, but that seemed petty at this point. The man
“She’s fine, if a little annoyed with me,” Draco said, turning his back at Harry to go fuss over some dish or other. “She thinks I’m exaggerating and that she could go home.”
“That would be fine, thank you,” Draco replied in a distant tone, before going back to gazing at nothing. Harry sighed to himself, appetite lost. The fight from yesterday, if that was even what that was, seemed to have destroyed any tentative truce they had reached. Harry held his hot cup of tea for a moment, trying to think things through. All accounts from other co-workers in the DML, grudgingly or not, stated that Draco had good work ethics and wasn’t half as insufferable as he used to be. So why couldn’t they just get along? Harry sighed again, feeling guilty and not knowing why that was. He went to work hungry and bad-tempered.
“It was just some adjustments, Potter, no need to get offended. I’m sure the house likes you too.”
“Oh relax, Potter,” Draco said with an eye-roll. He flicked his wand at the clock, and the bird froze where it was. Harry sagged to the nearest armchair, running his fingers through his hair.
“Nothing,” the other replied, dropping his hands and still looking flustered. “I’m really sorry. I don’t usually… I just…”
"Yeah. Mum got a little insane though. You know how she is." They smiled at each other. Draco scowled at them both.
“You could have told us, that’s all,” Potter mumbled, still frowning.
“You need blood-replenishing potions,” Draco said somewhere above him. Harry tried to focus on what he was doing, tried to argue that it had to be just a
"Shut up. I'll watch this side; you watch the other. You're not… Well, you're not
Do you know who I am yet, Potter?
“Oh,” Draco froze and stared at Harry with surprise. Potter was blushing a bit, but still smiling. Draco made a big production out of rolling his eyes.
“Wait a bloody minute, I didn’t get any letters!” Weasley protested. “Did you, Harry?”
He looked up when he heard a noise outside the door and gripped his wand. But it was just Potter. The man strode in a bit out of breath and looked half asleep, half annoyed. Draco felt himself finally relaxing. Even if Potter was wearing ripped jeans and a ratty t-shirt inside out and generally didn’t look exactly fit to fight off anything.
“Give her to me,” Harry said, extending his arms. The little bundle of rage was passed to him. “Hello, Rosie. I know, we were so mean to you this morning. Old fools, the whole lot of us.” He murmured gently, rocking her, and in a few seconds, the baby was peacefully having her breakfast.
. Blaise was next, retrieving his broom from Merlin knew where and leaving them behind with a cheerful:
“Harry Potter, you have better not be about to say that it’s too dangerous, and we shouldn’t help,” said a glowering Hermione from the fireplace.
an animal person. He held no regard for beasts, excluding maybe his owl. And even that only on the days the bird didn’t try to bite his fingers. His past was sprinkled with unpleasant events involving the animal kingdom, be they hippogriffs, giant snakes, or peacocks. He had no reason to believe canines were any less worrisome. So, he resisted the small urge to engage the dirty dog camping out on his property and squashed any thoughts of – Merlin forbid – feeding it.
Unsure of how to react to this, Harry mumbled something unintelligible and retreated.
"Malfoy," Potter interrupted him. Draco shifted on his feet, something in the other's tone abruptly making him feel uncertain. "What do you mean, you have to count your money to eat?"
“It’s ok, you don’t need to, I can just get another shirt” He doesn’t turn around,
The doorbell rang.
. I was sent to the Dursleys because I played a part in ‘the downfall of Voldemort’. I went to Hogwarts and every single year, ever since I was
“I’m sorry” Draco says, hands twisted together in a knot on his lap.
Harry eeks out making the tea for as long as he could. Picking mugs that weren’t dirty, pouring in milk. He can feel Draco getting impatient, the atmosphere was frosty at best. Clearly there’s something Draco desperately needed to say but, gentleman he is, wouldn’t, till the tea was ready.
Harry watched the tiny footprints of his friends make their way across the page and before long they had all converged together at the Ravenclaw tower before scattering with astonishing speed. Harry had been so absorbed, he didn’t clock that Draco had continued into the library toward the magical creatures section where Harry was sat. He hastily stuffed the map away and tried to look immensely enthralled by his half done charms essay.
“Yeah, Draco, you’re going down the wrong route entirely, why have one type when you can have them all?” Blaise spread his hands and laughed, before turning to Harry. “Potter. Pleased to meet you. Blaise Zabini, pansexual.” He grasped Harry's hand and shook it vigorously.
“We don’t have the luxury to shut ourselves up if we feel like it, do we? I spent a year camping just for your shitty little mission. Some of us have family to support, to look after, because they…they lost a
Harry smiles weakly, and gets in the back, thankful he hasn’t tried to force a friendship, where there would only be silence. It’s like he's tripped and fallen in to an alternate universe, where the most pure-blooded pureblood bastard owned a muggle BMW and doesn’t use magic. Where he’s civil to half-bloods, and Harry just can’t understand why. But, then again, if you saw me, Harry thought, you wouldn’t understand why I’m not living the high life, riding on the wave of post-war delirium. You’d look at me and say, he should be glad! What’s he doing, wasting away his life, letting himself sink in to the depths of history like he’d
. Harry was about to leave when Draco's voice softly breaks the silence,
As the beginning strings of the Tchaikovsky violin concerto softly played, Draco was transported. The smooth violin sang out like melted chocolate and the famous melody began. It was Draco's turn to tip his head back and absorb the sound. He had imagined it so many times, he could hardly believe it was happening. Hearing the music on the radio where it was bookended by talking and they never played full concertos was so vastly different that while he had heard this movement before it was as though he was listening to it for the first time.
“I just want to grab my stuff, and I’ll be out of your way” he hurried to the rack and grabbed his trunk, flipped open the lid and grabbed his robes.
“Because, asshole, I’d be shirtless!” Draco laughed and poked Harry jokingly on the shoulder,
“well, ah,” Harry started “I dunno” He's not really sure where this sudden willingness to talk came from, but Hermione is giving the two hopeful looks as they tiptoe around each other.
“Yes”
“Harry’s in the shower, come in,” I offer, noting the surprised look on her face when I don’t sneer and bully her.
‘Yeah sure’ He shoved the paper back at Draco, ‘You knew I wouldn’t understand that git.’
“Thanks”
'Oooh what's this then' He pulled himself up on to one elbow, looking eagerly at the record in Draco's hands.
He pulled a record out of the box and began to open up the record player. It was definitely old but the care shown to it meant it still played immaculately and as Harry lowered the record onto the turntable, showing such love and care, something suddenly clicked in Draco's mind.
“oh, I didn’t realise….” Harry trailed off, ashamed.
‘No, I’d like that too!’ I’m quick to reassure him, even if I don’t know quite why myself. ‘As you might have noticed I’m severely lacking in that department this year.’
I strip off in the bathroom and hop in the shower. Every time I talk to Potter, I make a complete hash of it. Every time. I catch sight of my left arm I die inside a little. The scars crosshatching the grotesquely elegant snake have done nothing whatsoever to hide the abomination that mars my skin. Sometimes I feel I know what my father went through, hiding the black strokes of dark magic from the world. Whether that was with regret at what he had done I will never know. Not now. I wrap a towel round my head, turban style, and make my way out into the dorm where Harry is sprawled out on his bed, eyes shut. I tiptoe around him, grabbing my pajamas and returning to the bathroom, but he opens on eye looks at me lazily and says,
It also chewed Draco’s dragonhide boots whenever it had a chance, and then proceeded to barf the remains of said footwear into one of the irreplaceable vases that adorned the hallway. Malfoys weren’t supposed to shout, his father had always said. Shouting was for commoners. Draco found that he shouted quite a lot that week.
"Hm. I… Was I?" That wasn't on the document he signed. Draco chanced a peek at Potter's face and was confronted by blazing green eyes and a hard-set jaw. "P-Potter? You're wearing your war face. Could you stop?" he stammered, taking a step back.
could make Saint Potter move anywhere. Including out, as it happened. And oh, how Draco had yelled. And threatened. And insulted.
“What then?” he asked, and searched Draco’s eyes for an explanation. Those bright grey eyes slowly perused his face, and Harry couldn’t help but feel a bit like one of his cursed objects, being irrevocably pulled apart under Draco’s scrutiny.
“What about the families of all those people?” Harry nodded grimly:
“It’s nice that you’re helping her.”
“They are!” Harry exclaimed, irritated. “If they weren’t, that fucking lunatic would be barging in here right now.”
“Did you kill somebody, do you mean?” Harry gritted out, still glaring at the same spot on the ground as if it would spill some answers if only Harry conjured up enough indignation.
“I do not have
“You want me to live with Potter?” Draco looked as sickened by this prospect as Harry. “Surely there’s somewhere else in the whole of Britain that I could go to.”
“Excuse me?”
, Potter, bite your tongue.
“I see. And the food?”
“And then this morning!” He could see that his therapist was smiling gently, always a clear sign he though Draco was being silly. “This morning I woke up first, and
"What the bloody hell is this, Weasel?"
"Point me to a working fireplace, Malfoy."
“Oh yes, I’m sure. I just saw him
It took a few minutes, but Draco finally felt his reticent bedfellow relaxing.
"You can't pull shit like that, Malfoy!" Potter exclaimed, apparently running out of patience. "And who the fuck decides to hack down their house anyway?"
“Yeah, but it’s been a week, Harry. He has to be missing his friends. His life. That Astoria bird. We need to step up.” Ron reasoned with his mouth full, and then quickly dodged a smack from Hermione, who was hissing ‘

“Well, I
! I could be hurt! Do you know how rude it is to…” the lecture lasted a good five minutes, which was just as well because Harry took about as long to get a hold of himself. In the end, he managed to stand up straight again and take in Draco’s appearance. The man was wearing a thoroughly disgruntled look that reminded Harry of Teddy’s face when bedtime arrived. He extended a hand to a weary Draco.
“Come on,” he said, smiling slightly, “I won’t tell anyone.”
Harry Malfoy-Potter
Or glaring at the Manor, really, because at that exact moment all he wanted, from the bottom of his black soul, was to burn the whole wretched thing to the ground, Malfoy history be damned.
These events, as Draco had taken to calling them, started getting more frequent. During field expeditions, he would get the weirdest impression someone was following him. He saw shades everywhere. Discussing the situation with his parents didn’t help. They immediately assumed it was some unhappy war victim, still after revenge against pardoned Death Eaters. Discomfited, Draco finally scheduled an appointment at St. Mungos for the next week. He supposed he had Black blood after all, and Salazar knew his ancestors could be notoriously insane sometimes.
“I’m sorry! It’s just the whole ‘man in the cape’ part. I keep expecting to hear he showed them his bits!” Hermione still looked disapproving, but Harry and Ron shared an amused glance.
The three friends shared a cautious look that had Draco gaping. Harry just shrugged.
“Because he is helping you restore the house?”
“Hermione is right,” said Draco, lighting another fire on the stove, for reason’s unknown to Harry.
“Clearly not.”
Chapter one.
Hermione gave one thunderous glare to the lot of them and that was the end of it.
The elf’s distress turned out to be about Draco, who was perched on top of the ballroom’s chandelier, swinging back and forth while twisting his wand in complicated patterns.
“You are unbelievable,” Harry muttered and then spread his arms out in frustration. “I don’t get it, where did he go?”
“The indignities that your muggle family put you through.”
“Like you can see at all with those hideous glasses.” Draco snapped, voice raised enough to be heard above the rainstorm, and pointed his wand at Harry’s face. “
this thing?
"So! Do you know how to make wolfsbane?" asked Weasley, breaking the uncomfortable silence. "I don't turn, but I get rather moody near the full moon, you know. Only I'm pants at potions."
“Of course, Potter, how remiss of me. I’ll research with all the possible haste,
“I think it's best I go. Clearly, this was a bad idea.”
“I- I… Oh, Merlin.” Harry said between gasps. “This dog is…You have to call me-
The page tears.
“We broke up, alright? After the battle,” Potter yelled. Draco felt a slow smile forming on his lips.
time. Potter sure had a good pair of lungs and the stamina to go with it). He was seized by this ridiculous notion that if he could only get to his feet, the ginger bloke standing in his library would disappear. Weirder things had happened. Specially lately. Just look at this Potter situation.
Potter, I'm fine. It's called punishment for a reason. I was merely explaining about the roof expenses."
“But she was there that morning!”
"Potter,” Draco spat out, fuming. "I will murder you, probation or not."
They fell silent, Rosie’s occasional gurgles the only sound in the office.
Now. Draco would forever reject this order of events. In his (always correct, mind you) opinion, it had all started with that blasted dog.
“I’m just saying, you can hear everything perfectly fine from the floo, there’s no need to risk-”
Ron snorted, and Draco glared at a spot on the wall. Harry noticed his ears were a bit red.
McGonagall followed, stern robes somehow still pristine even in the heat of midday. She gave them both a severe look. Using the excuse of clearing out the debris in the drawing room, Draco and Potter had been just shoving each other around instead. As was evidently clear to the teacher.
Draco found himself sitting stiffly in an armchair at the library a couple of hours later. He was utterly horrified. Harry Potter was currently kneeling in front of the fireplace screaming himself hoarse at the Minister of Magic.
, what else could it be, that he was fine, but… He was out cold.
“Draco, stop it, I’m trying to write you a fucking letter—”
Draco gulped and glanced at the chandelier high above, which had started to shake in a rather disquieting manner. Magic was gathering around them at an alarming rate.
“Go ahead.”
Love,
“Particular? I mean, in his tastes.”
While Draco charmed various items into a trunk he’d just conjured, odds and ends zapping all around them, Harry took the opportunity to look around curiously. The house was nothing like he would have expected. Far from the lavish coldness he remembered from Malfoy Manor, Draco’s house was all about comfort and soothing colours. It had a nice, lived-in atmosphere to it, and was cosy in a way Harry himself had never quite managed to reproduce at Grimmauld.
" growled Draco, scrambling out of his bed and standing up. "
“But they’re Slytherins!”
“Tactful as ever, I see,” drawled Draco, leaning back on his chair and fixing his cuffs. He looked so put together, no one would ever say the man had spent the night up obsessing over Harry’s vital signs. “Say, are you trying to break a record for the number of cuss words per minute?”
again.
“Well…” said Ron, a bit dubiously. “You could have a point, but-”
. Harry’s search had unearthed an article from around a year ago announcing Draco Malfoy and Astoria Greengrass were engaged.
“I was a concerned student,” Draco stated loftily, and all three Gryffindors snorted.
And if you wear those tight jeans again, and if I’m feeling particularly nice, you might see me dance to something even
“Very well. Potter woke me up,” Draco said, voice low. “He was going crazy, barking, scratching the door-”
"Really good man, why are you so surprised? Did you forget the Dementor fiasco? The Hippogriff theatrics?" Potter started to smile, Blaise was full on laughing and Draco had had enough with the lot of them.
“Who the hell knows.”
“Yes. Especially the sexually frustrated.”
“Why are you following me?”
“Go…?”
During the first few weeks after the
Best wishes,
Harry denied this vehemently. He’d lived in a forest under the elements for
"Out of my house!" Draco yowled, all righteous anger and burning ears. "All of you, that's quite enough! Out!"

Harry rolled to his back but kept close. Draco wondered idly what had happened to Harry’s friends. To Draco’s own friends. For that matter, what the sodding hell had happened to his left sock? He frowned at his foot, distracted. Turned his head to Harry and blurted:
"Just don't ask for my dad's help, eh?" he said, casually stealing a piece of cake from Potter's plate. (They'd taken that tea break after all). "You've seen the Burrow."
“I was most certainly
“I won’t impose you, Potter. Let’s reconsider the Manor option. Maybe talk to an expert.” Draco said, narrowing his eyes as he contemplated his options. “It can be done, I suppose.”
, because she came looking for me after I barraged into her room at fuck o’clock in the morning to leave Potter with her.”
“What the buggering fuck is that Potter?” he yelled, whipping his head around to see if they were being chased. They were. “
“Are you sure?”
“Prat.” He grumbled to himself before marching off into the night, leaving Draco to stand alone under the elements. Which he did, because this whole business with Harry seemed so surreal that he needed a moment - or five - to put his thoughts in order.
, Harry was stumbling in and out of alleyways at random, still seething. He had half a mind to go back to Grimmauld place and start the fight all over again when he first glimpsed the hooded shadow standing to his right. Harry turned around, heart racing for totally different reasons now, and pointed his wand to a particularly unlit corner. There was nothing there. He frowned, instincts starting to buzz in his stomach.
“You’re asking
Draco startled and likely to the mortification his ancestors, sprinted away to comply.
“I’m… Sorry, I thought I saw something.” Harry shifted, gazing at the dim street. Their only companions were the biting gusts of air and the rubble tumbling around on the ground. The rain was still falling, making it hard to distinguish a lot of sounds.
"Hermione," Potter quipped, shrugging.
“That’s why you named him Potter? Because he’s immune to usual dog poison?”
“He was hysterical, babbling something about the house being under attack, and that its master was dying.”
, why is the Purple Parlour painted green? Are you a complete barbarian?”
“If the wards were really in place,” said Hermione, face acquiring that faraway look of when she was working a puzzle, “then this person wouldn’t have been able to get access to Harry in the first place.”
“Hey, this bed is softer than mine!”
. That thing. The hooded rubbish from a few years ago.”
“Well, fuck.”
Ah. Revenge is truly sweet.
“Indeed. And what about when the
joined the commotion and Harry helplessly tugged at his hair, wondering how a man was supposed to deal with this when he hadn’t even had his first cup of tea.
Well,
“We can trace apparations
"Zabini," Potter growled in warning, sending a scowl in his direction. Blaise grinned, unabashed.
"I'm fixing your sodding roof, Malfoy, not the world! And tomorrow I'll be done with this shit
Draco at five o’clock in the afternoon, on the other hand, was an unpredictable source of mayhem. Harry had come home one day to a cauldron flooding Draco’s office with weird bubbles that turned into a slippery black paste when popped. The dog was madly trying to catch them but succeeded only in skidding from one side of the room to the other, crashing into the furniture, while Draco shouted at him to
“Is he- magical?” he asked Draco, who let out a desperate, choked laugh and ran a hand through dishevelled hair.
“Her name is Astoria Greengrass. I don’t want her involved in this mess.”
"Stop making stuff up, Malfoy, bloody hell!"
means no
“I don’t know!
“Just so. You- What?”
By lunch time they were all snapping angrily at each other. By teatime, Pansy had inevitably broken a nail and thrown the mother of all tantrums. Hermione finally relented and said they could continue the next day. Pansy immediately left in a huff, without so much as a good day flung their way, the savage. The Golden Trio had then buggered off to Merlin knew where and that left Draco soaking alone in hot water, trying to regain the feeling in his legs.
“Right. You mean because his relatives were such arseholes, if he is ok?”
Harry stared back at him in open astonishment.
Nothing would make a difference. The creature stalking them seemed immune to all magic. Draco could feel the panic tightening his throat, making his voice hoarse as he showered their enemy with every curse, hex, and spell he could think off.
Ron and Zacharias Smith were next to be paired and Harry was feeling increasingly panicky, looking at the remaining boys as Seamus and Dean get paired together, which by the way was extremely unfair?? Finally, he was left stood across the hall from Draco Malfoy.
Ron stared, and Hermione gaped. Harry hadn’t been planning to tell them this, but it had come out as something to say. The silence became unbearable and Harry could feel the pressure on his chest as it got heavier and heavier. He's about to carry on when...
I’m left running after him as he strides down the hall, trying to tuck my shirt in and sort out my own mess of hair, full of elegant grace and composure. No one would know that ten minutes earlier he was bedraggled tuft of hair sticking out of his duvet.
Draco straightened up and laughed, ducking Harry’s punch. He settled back down and grabbed Harry’s essay.
“…seriously Potter, when did you last shower?” Draco was saying “You look like you’ve been washing with wet wipes since last May and honestly, when did you last sleep a full night? I can see your cheekbones where they used to be fleshed out, even during the last few years? Are you eating enough, you’re so thin, I’m worried…
'It's beautiful Draco' Harry said, 'How long has it been in your family?'
Harry needed to do some digging he decided, there was something happening across all the eighth years and he needed to know. If they were planning to ambush him and cross-examine him like Ron had done on the train, then Harry wanted to be ready.
‘Pansy, Blaise’ Says Draco and takes a seat. I hover tentatively, not sure if last nights situation was temporary or not. Draco looks at me puzzled,
For one thing, Neville telling him that they didn’t agree with Ron piqued Harry’s interest, and now he thought about it, not only had Ron and Hermione been avoiding him, but he had barely seen Neville since the beginning of term. In fact, he hadn’t seen much of his old Gryffindor dorm or year. He had either spent time either alone, with Draco or with Blaise and Pansy. They had taken to joining him on the walk between lessons, claiming they were going that way and it was a simple coincidence, but the more he thought about it they were with him almost all the time. And since Neville’s oddly formal invite he had been joined occasionally by him and Luna and sometimes Dean.
Chapter 2
“Boys,” she scolded, fighting down a smile. “Focus.”
“He just… He teased me into a… flustered… state. In a clear effort to cause my early demise.”
The cavalry, as it were, consisted of one Hermione Granger. She came in talking a million words per minute, hair messily done up in a bun and for all purposes having acquired mastery in magical construction theory over the last 12 hours.
"I was absolutely
“Well do tell, Potter, how
“Malfoy,
“Repay me?”
? How exactly does one go about asking something like that? Draco shifted restlessly on the top of the bean he was supposed to be hammering into submission. Hermione had banned magic for this part of the task. In her defense, Blaise had almost – accidentally, Draco was sure – maimed Ronald with an overly enthusiastic swarm of nails.
“I remember you being awake and already behaving like a pillock during breakfast back at Hogwarts,” Harry commented, after watching Draco try and fail to dunk a biscuit in his teacup.
“You appear to have a rule of no cooking here, from what I gather, correct? Regardless, how many times do you find food lying around when you’re hungry?”
was draped all over Potter. You see what he’s done?”
"Potter?" spluttered Draco, and the axe fell again from his hands.
“Imbecile,” said Draco, rolling his eyes. He turned back to Hermione and a few seconds later they exited the room, talking excitedly to each other. The dog gave a yip a rushed to follow his master. Ron looked on with bemusement.
“Okay, sure. I’ll see you later,” he took one last look at Draco, who was now glancing around the kitchen and frowning slightly, and bolted before the madness commenced again.
As Harry walked down to Ron and Hermione he noticed the people stare and somehow, he didn't think it’s because he was in muggle clothing. Coming to a stop Harry could hear the messy noise of kissing and hesitated before he knocked on the door.
Harry lay back and looked at the slightly curved ceiling above me. Their room being in the old astronomy tower meant the turrets became ceilings and the wide sweeping vistas became commonplace. Draco had moved into the space at the end of their beds and was fussing with a black padded thing at the end of his violin. Blimey, no wonder he didn’t know any real music he thought, his anti-muggle upbringing was really showing with a stark clarity. Obviously, the Malfoys respected the muggle classical composers more than modern bands and singers. Or maybe Tchaikovsky wasn’t a muggle after all, Harry mused, it wasn’t as though he knew much about it and the music had created its own kind of magic whilst it was playing. He wasn’t sure what to expect, whether Draco’s slightly abashed confidence was misplaced was yet to be seen.
“I’m just gonna take a shower, Malfoy” Harry offered to the prone form of Draco on his bed. No audible response but a thumbs up was all that was needed.
“yup”
He was lost in thought when Hermione poked Harry in the ribs, pointed to the laden tables and grinned. He smiled weakly and looked away before his face betrayed his feelings. With no appetite, and having not eaten properly for months on end, too much food at once would probably make him sick.
“No thanks, I’ll let Harry come in his own time, actually.” She smiles grimly and turns down the corridor. The doors almost shut when I hear,
Harry stopped and looked at them through gathering tears, “and you know the worst part?
They followed, feet shuffling, in a close huddle. Harry had been hoping to slip in without the stares and whispers, but now that was out the window. They troop in to the Great Hall as the last first year was called to be sorted, their footsteps echoed as heads whipped round to watch them come in. As one unit they sit at the back and Harry found himself opposite Draco again. Harry could feel Ron watching his back intently, probably feeling
to let him have some space.
“Don’t say that!” Her voice was choked by tears and she stepped forward and collapsed in to Harry's hug. “He’s got so angry after the war, Harry.
“Yeah well, its one way to die isn’t it?” Harry can’t look at his face. It would be disappointed and pitying, just like the councillors at St. Mungo’s, just like Hermione’s; and Harry couldnt stand for Draco to see him cry
Harry snorted and shook his head, 'of course you are, pureblooded prick'
He got up and wandered round to his side of the room, looking about under his own bed. Draco had owned a vinyl copy of the Sibelius and Tchaikovsky violin concertos for some years now, having found it in a dusty corner of the Malfoy manor, but had never had a record player to play it on. It was a muggle violinist called Kyung Wha Chung with an orchestra called the London Symphony orchestra. Draco had always played the violin but after the war, finding himself at a loose end, he had decided that was what he wanted to do. He listened to muggle radio absorbing as much music as he could, Radio 3 was his permanent soundtrack - but he had never managed to find a place to play his record. He shyly carried it over to Harry, still lying back on the floor and waited for him to open his eyes. They were coming to the end of Moonage Daydream and Harry opened one eye, perhaps to see if Draco was enjoying it, and saw him nervously clutching his record.
Harry can't seem to find the end of the tunnel he's descended in to but theres a certain blond who thinks he has the answer. If given the chance he could bring light to the darkest time.
“How’ve you been? Harry?” Hermione is the first to speak, tentative and cautionary, notes of fear dancing in the air.
An unsure grin twitches Draco's mouth to the side;
“Well. After…everything, I sort of, I wasn’t…I um, I couldn’t work out why I was alive.” He was quiet and tentative and it felt like running uphill trying to explain this. “so, I didn’t want anyone to see me that way. I shut everyone out and I hadn’t spoken to anyone for months until Dra..Malfoy came to pick me up this morning.”
‘Hermione, stop, I only said it because I care about Harry!’ He tried to justify himself, a slightly desperate note in his voice, ‘I don’t know what I would say, please don’t make me not yet!’
sorry guys, gals and non-binary pals its #toodramatic but ah well :)
“I’m fine, I just needed a little space” Harry couldn't meet their concerned gaze and felt the heat rising, colouring the back of his neck a virulent red.
Her parting words reassured Harry, that even if the train got picked up by a giant dinosaur, Hermione would make sure everyone was still on time.
‘If you knew what it was supposed to sound like, you wouldn’t be saying that,’ He laughed and strode to the door, ‘Come on, its dinner time’
Harry carried the laden tray to the coffee table and found that Draco had already made a space, piling the dusty magazines and doodles neatly in to stacks on the floor.
“hmm?” he feigns disinterest.
‘Hi Harry, just wanted to say,’ he swallowed and glanced at Blaise before turning back to Harry, ‘Luna and I, and Cho and Lav, Padma and Parvati and really Dean and Seamus too…’
“Don’t mention it” He turned on his heel and walked away and Harry followed cautiously, wheeling the trolley and feeling like a first year.
“what is it? Did I hit the nail?”
He stoped abruptly as he noticed Harry staring at him. Part of him wanted to laugh and brush off his concern. Another part wants to ask where this new soft side to Malfoy came from and another side wants to tell Malfoy everything. In the end all he could do was stare.
The sound of something twittering and scratching at my window wakes me up in the morning, and I drag myself up, bleary eyed, to let Hedwig in with a letter. I breathe in the morning freshness that is unique to Hogwarts and turn in to the bathroom rubbing my eyes free of sleep.
I wake up.
Harry can't seem to find the end of the tunnel he's descended in to but theres a certain blond who thinks he has the answer. If given the chance he could bring light to the darkest time.
to him
‘Sorry Harry what did you say we had? Potions?’
Most of the meal passed in relative peace, Zabini and Parkinson sniping at each other occasionally, discussing which pairings McGonagall thought suitable. Its almost time to go when Pansy turned to Harry abruptly.
‘What I’m saying is that, er, we miss you, we don’t agree with Ron and would really love it if you came to our party on Saturday evening? Itll be in the Room of Requirement, if we can find it, but we can let you know! Obviously you three are invited aswell’ He added quicky looking round at Draco, Pansy and Blaise. Harry’s head span,
“I know you love me really” Harry smirked and went to unlock the door as Draco spluttered and protested behind him.
He’s balanced on the front step, rocking on his heels as he watches the traffic go by. Curls tousled in the wind, wand sticking out of his back pocket. He spins round at the click of the door and stuck out a hand, which Harry took.
Harry stumbled down the corridor, vision blurred, in search of an empty compartment. He wasn't paying attention to where he was going, so when he ran headfirst in to Draco Malfoy carrying a cup of coffee, they both went down, sprawling across the musty carpet of the train aisle. The burning coffee spilt all down Harry's front and the pain made him yell out. He lifted himself up off the floor and offered Draco a hand up. He took it and they stood, quietly in the corridor.
A short walk later, and the trio were stood at the base of the steps, the doors open, and the returning Hogwarts students flooded in to the entrance hall, grateful to be out of the cold.
And I reckon you’d be right.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco's face split in to a beaming smile, and he nodded vigorously, pulling several out of his trunk. Harry sat down next to him this time and accepted the offering of chocolate.
I slouch up to the door and pause running a hand through my hair, but it gets stuck in the knots, so I give up.
They passed the meal talking about this and that, laughing as Blaise tipped peas all over the floor and into the pockets of Pansy’s robes causing her to whip out her wand and spell his hair a violent acid green.
s and Harry would be surprised if Draco understood anyway. But he nodded and says,
world that he longed to go to a muggle music conservatoire. The almighty Draco Malfoy wanting to live and study as a muggle was a leap he didn't think Harry's mind could comprehend. He lifted the gleaming instrument out of its velvet folds and began to assemble and prepare to play. Whilst the instrument was clearly old and well-played, the warm glow of the wood and rosin-free strings showed the love with which Draco cared for his violin.
He got Harry to stand up and looked at the damage before dabbing various ointments and potions on the harsh red marks. He worked softly and gently, and Harry began to feel relaxed as he pulled out the heat and layered plasters over the worst of it.
“Well I’m sorry Potter, there’s nothing I can do, the Sorting Hat was consulted, and he seemed to think it best!” She turned on her heel and it was more than Harry could do to not shout after her that I'd
“on the head?” Harry whispered it out in to the stagnant air. “yes”
Draco thought for a moment, he didn't want to own up to Harry that he had only began listening, or even contemplating, muggle music since the end of the war. It wasn't that his mother had never allowed it, just that it would have been deeply frowned upon; and unlike his cousin, Sirius Black, had never had the gumption to rebel in any capacity.
‘Tomorrow?’ A wheedling tone appeared, and Harry could feel Hermione melt, she could never really refuse Ron.
He hauls Harry's trunk out of the back and offers his hand again.
It was Monday. There was a long way to go before the promised party on Saturday and Harry could feel it all too well. Draco had begun disappearing off, claiming that he had to practice – for what, Harry couldn’t work out.
hope you enjoy
Harry felt a soft glimmer of love in his chest as he remembered that whilst Ron and Hermione might be his closest friends, they were not his only ones.
to let me know that
“What the hell Harry?” Ron got up and braced himself against the luggage rack, looming over Harry, anger written all over his face. “Don’t you think we all felt like that a little? Don’t you? And we didn’t hide away in our fucking mansions? Did we huh? DID WE?” He’s right up close, and his breath was hot in Harry's eyes. Hermione stood and grabbed the back of Ron's shirt pulling him down with a scared look but he’s not bloody finished.
a single room! When he got back to the entrance hall, Draco was still there, sitting on the stairs clutching two keys.
She pulled away and looked at Harry, her face puffy and tearstained.
“Professor!” he called at McGonagall’s rapidly retreating back “Professor wait, please!”
He felt so uncomfortable. In the dark reflection of the window, he could see his prominent ribs and skinny stomach; nothing compared to the manicured strength of Draco. Harry watched his muscles move through his fitted t-shirt, sliding neatly as he worked on reassembling the bottles on the bench.
to learn myself – so the curls bounce on top in an endearing mop on his head, nothing too crazy, just like when he came to pick me up. A spritz of cologne, a pair of beautiful leather brogues laced magically, and he’s ready to go all within the 6 minutes he had left himself.
. Eventually it came, the onslaught of questions as to
He pulled out the Marauders Map and began tracing the names of his friends. Ron and Hermione were in the common room McGonagall has organised for eighth years. It was warm and cosy with a roaring fire and a kettle hanging above it for tea now that the weather was turning. Draco was walking down the stairs towards the library, and with a start Harry saw he was accompanied by Luna and Neville. Draco was civil enough with them but was by no means their friend. Harry quickly scanned the map for signs of Blaise and Pansy and was startled to see Pansy with Dean and Seamus and Blaise’s tiny flag with Padma, Parvati, Lavender and Cho in a tight circle.
“hmm, sure” Draco looked at him appraisingly and grabbed Harry's wrist, pulling him in to the closest compartment. He sat Harry down and started rummaging in his trunk for a tissue.
! But guess what, Harry believed that people could change you know? Malfoy had seemed equally
Harry sat back in the squeaky leather of the car on the way to Kings Cross. The tightening feeling in his chest got heavier and heavier the closer they got. When he had recieved the letter, inviting him back to finish his last year properly, he didn’t reply for weeks. The follow up letter from McGonagall was full of
“do you think, Harry, er that we’ll keep our room?” Ron asked tentatively.
“hmm?”
I laugh and drag myself out of bed, calling to Draco that
Draco blushed a pale pink, colouring his pale cheeks as he pulled the odd shaped thing out and began to undo the clasps.
“Thanks.”
morning lads and ladies ive risen from the dead.
Ron nods, one vicious promise of an argument later and Harry looked him in the eye, assessing and thinking if they could ever get back to normal. The whistle of the train broke them out of their stalemate and they boarded, taking a compartment towards the back. Hermione was nervous by the way she keeps checking and re-checking minor details, chattering on and on about her latest campaign as if everything was ok. Ron in contrast just sat there and trying to start seemingly innocuous conversations. It’s so tense Harry could have shattered it with
He trudged his way through Monday’s potions, charms and herbology and sat in the library, at his usual table, surrounded by books, quills and empty chocolate frog wrappers. He began to wonder what exactly this was all leading to. Did he actually want to become an Auror, given his response in the last six months. His subjects didn’t necessarily confine him to that, and he’d always had an interest in healing maybe? He shook his head and returned to the charms essay in front of him. It had evaded him all afternoon and bringing it down to the library in the vague hope that inspiration might strike proved pointless. He looked around idly, hoping Draco might appear, violin slung over shoulder clutching a pile of confusing sheet music but nothing.
“Thanks”
They meet in the middle and Harry was immediately enveloped in a bone-crushing hug from both sides. Its nice. At least he thinks it is. Suddenly it’s not so nice and he can feel himself trying to push back, to
‘Ron, you better actually do it,’ a sharp rustle suggested that Hermione had drawn her wand, Harry stifled a laugh as he imagined Ron’s face – it was all he could do to not turn around and watch.
“What is this?” The spell was broken by Professor McGonagall sweeping in to the entrance and the milling student body to scattered in seconds. “You will all come forward and collect a password when I call your name.” She surveyed them with a wary eye as they shuffled their feet and avoided eye contact.
“Yeah mate, we were worried” Ron chips in.
She nodded and looked away, “I’ll go and find him ok? Make sure you’re changed by the time we arrive though!”
Harry follows him out the door and together they haul the trunk to the car. The hug, however spontaneous, was a definite reminder of change in the taller boy’s attitudes, something Harry couldn’t quite pin down. Draco nods, and makes his way round to the driver’s seat;
“I ran in to Malfoy, with some coffee, er…and he mopped me up and gave me a couple plasters.” Harry wished he didn’t sound so awkward and false, “who knew coffee could give you third degree burns eh?”
“I know you are” Harry said, not brave enough to disagree, “of course you are.”
When Madam Pince came round, it was to tell them it was dinner time, and she would be shutting the library so if they didn’t want to be stuck there all night, they better get a move on. They collected their things, stuffing papers and quills haphazardly into bags and Draco handed Harry back his essay. It was substantially longer, and Harry realised Draco had finished it for him.
“We want answers Harry.” The steely note in Ron’s voice made him flinch a little, but he stays silent. Harry unbuttons his coat.
“Potter” He asked tentatively as Harry pulled his shirt over his head again.
I smile and wave back, probably looking confused as hell (which I am) and close the door behind me. I pull a few more things out of my trunk, fold and place them in the dresser between our beds. I leave exactly half of every drawer for Harry, trying to make my stuff look as innocuous as possible next to the gold and red. Hmm, so Granger seems to have forgiven me. Interesting, has she bought Weasley with her is the question. He seems really angry about Harry not being exactly on top of the world, which in my humble opinion, is utterly ridiculous and to be honest, he needs to get a gri-...
"I can send you some in two weeks, should you want me to."
“Yes, Draco. He sent me a lovely letter apologising in the beginning of summer. And he has been helping me with the magical theory for reversing memory charms.”
“Right,” Draco said. “Tory, you have to go. Don’t come back here until I say it’s safe, okay?”
"Look, I know you can't hire anyone because of the probation-"
made them both jump. Draco looked to his left, only to be confronted with Ronald Weasley standing by his side, struggling to balance two enormous rickety baskets in his arms. Draco gawked in a most undignified manner. The previous somber mood was quickly forgotten.
“Oh God,” Harry wheezed, brushing his tears away with the back of his hand, still chuckling now and then. “I wish I could tell 15 year old me about this.” Draco huffed.
. Unhand me, Potter!” Draco hissed, shaking his arm loose.
“Would your father allow strangers messing up with the Manor?”
He was dimly aware of Potter’s weak protests. Draco watched the jet of green light dash towards the dark form. It was as if the world had been shrouded in silence for a few seconds. No wind, no rain, no laboured breathing coming from Harry or himself. A white flash exploded, making them squint and put their hands up. And then it was over, Harry and Draco just two wizards standing in an empty street in the middle of a dwindling thunderstorm.
“Yes. Draco, get on with it.”
It was a Saturday morning in the beginning of August. The already hot sunlight found one Draco Malfoy standing very straight and preternaturally still on the front garden of his ancestral home, looking at the Manor.
"Malfoy, old chap, you can't do that," Blaise chided, still relaxed in his broom, floating above his friend.
!” The chandelier was in fact a popular drinking game for the Gryffindors, who would try to dash from one end of the room to another without getting hit. “Get down from there!”
Draco made a show of looking around himself. Malfoy Manor was deadly silent. No house elf wanted to step even one foot inside the place after the war. Draco didn't blame them.
“How did you know to do that thing? For my nightmares.” Draco turned his head towards Harry, who was looking back at him, appearing at once shy and determined. Draco shifted to his side, muttering a cleaning charm at the mess pooling between them. He bit his lip, considering.
The house was quiet when he slipped inside and closed the front door. Harry decided he’d earned the right to a proper bath today, instead of his usual quick showers. Mildly appeased by the prospect of regaining feeling in his toes, he took the stairs two at a time and barged into the bathroom next to his bedroom.
“Git,” Harry grumbled, but took a sit, nonetheless. A brooding Kreacher appeared next to Harry’s right elbow, pouring him a glass of wine too.
"I'm going to rip it all apart piece by piece," Draco murmured gleefully, smiling at the tile.
“Yeah mate, we’ve been having this argument since we were
Draco woke to a blood-curdling scream, heart racing. For a moment, he was thrown back into Voldemort times in the Manor, and it took him a few seconds to re-orientate himself.
“They’re swots, right?” he asked, taking up the vacated space the dog left next to Harry and leaning against the headboard. Harry just shrugged. He had no idea who Conway was, or what a way line might be, for that matter.
"Well," said Blaise, still peering over the axe like it was some exotic plant, hands at his back. "As much as I am enjoying this Excalibur debacle, I'm afraid I must take my leave."
“Er… your house. I mean, the both of you.” Harry stammered, growing uncertain the more incredulous Draco looked. “Because you live together. Because you’re getting married… Right?”
“Back at the Burrow. Hermione is staying there for now, until she fixes her parent’s memories.” Draco made a noncommittal noise and took a plate to his bed. Harr-
and you can go starve to death for all I care!" He shouted, lying down and punching his pillow.
help you, you inconsiderate prat. I’ll have you know-”
He cut himself off. Was Potter

"Why? No." They grappled for the covers for a moment, until Draco elbowed Potter in the ribs
“Absolutely not.” was Draco’s instantaneous retort.
was not one of them. He agreed he made poor choices in his youth and, to his chagrin, was mostly inclined to worry just about his own problems, the rest of the world be damned. He wasn’t proud of that, but he accepted the assessment. However, all of his selfish actions and judgement lacking conducts were always made with a sound mind. So why the fuck was he seeing things?
…” he continued to grumble, checking the kitchen, and then coming back to the living room. “Potter!” Draco bellowed, making Harry jump and bang his elbow on a wall.
“Good.” He whispered, then frowned at the scratchy sound of his own voice. Draco conjured a glass of water and helped him sit up and drink.
He apparated to Astoria’s house, landing directly on her room. He ignored her shriek of fright and shoved the dog on her bed. Draco barked a quick: “Take care of him!” and didn’t wait for her response before apparating again and storming into the Ministry’s building. It was empty, obviously. But Draco figured it had more barriers and protective wards than his house, and probably more than even Malfoy Manor. Draco ran straight to the Department of Law Enforcement, forgoing the elevators in favour of the stairs. He barged into the Auror Headquarters’ and didn’t even pause at the automated voice informing him of the Office’s working hours.
Draco made a choked sound of despair.
"Ok, I have to go, mate. Meet you here tomorrow morning."
“This fucking dog!” Draco hollered, madly kicking his feet in order to sit up. And then, shoving the animal, who was licking his face:
“S-sorry, I’ll…” Harry fumbled for words, so completely flustered he couldn’t actually follow the advice the last sane part of his brain was screaming at him:
“Your point?”
! Malfoy, go!”
.” He staggered forward to where they last saw… whatever it was that they saw. Smooth cobbled stone and water were all that remained.
“Fuck! Stop it, what the-”
Draco was standing in the middle of the room, sleeves rolled up, charming pans and ingredients into… something. Kreacher was running in circles around him, crying that he could help. Harry must have made some sort of noise because Draco suddenly raised his eyes to him.
"You come back here this instant! Stop with your Savior favours! You are
“Ron!” Potter was sinking into his chair, the very picture of discomfort.
“Get Potter.” he wheezed at the baffled rookie on call, who had been quite clearly just taking a nap on a couch in the corner. When the trainee continued to blink at him owlishly, Draco banged his fist on the counter and shouted:
“Is this room… er…?” Harry asked, bewildered, noticing a wide window that had been decidedly
“Stop acting like it doesn’t happen to everyone.”
“Well.” Draco paused, and then shrugged. He sat straighter and tried to look confident in a way that never fooled Harry when they were in school, and most certainly didn’t fool him now. “If it meant my life, of course he would.”
"Cheers, Ron."
Harry grunted, putting his glasses back and mulling over the subject. He did find small tins of cookies inside his robe’s pockets, and sometimes sandwiches were waiting for him at his office when he got back from a raid. He just always assumed Ron or Hermione had bought extras or something. Come to think of it, Harry recurrently found ‘left over’ food inside his fridge that he had no recollection of ever buying. Draco was staring at him smugly when Harry’s eyes went back to him.
Soon they were crossing the entrance hall, which managed to be freezing and give off a malevolent energy despite summer's best efforts. Merlin, how he hated this house. At least the roof on this section of the Manor was still holding.
?” Harry raised his eyes to find Draco, hands on his waist and knit in the brow, glaring at him. His t’s got more pronounced when he was ticked off, a distantly entertained part of Harry noticed.
“Yes,” Draco replied simply.
has nightmares, so don't come acting like you came out of that bloody war completely okay!"
“Or what?” asked Draco, sneering at him.
“Alright darling, but I expect a very thorough explanation,” Astoria said, picking up a purse Harry just now noticed was hanging in a hook next to the door, and kissing Draco on the cheek. “Very thorough.” She stressed. And with a polite nod to Harry and soft pop, she was gone.
“You were a pain in the arse, mate.” Draco spluttered, apparently appalled at being referred to as Weasley’s
"Fucking hell, Malfoy!" he shouted, jumping out of his bed and shaking his covers.
See you (and bring those pictures, will you?),
"Fucking hell, I KNOW! Stop wasting all that sickening goodness on me,
“Can you do that thing with your tongue again?”
“Weekend study group?” he suggested. Ron winced but nodded. Hermione was looking at him with a speculative expression.
“The clothes?” asked Blaise.
"Shut up, Malfoy!" Potter turned to glare at Draco. "Clear enough?"
“Malfoy, I have your-”
"What are you doing, Malfoy?" Potter repeated, this time in a quiet voice. Draco whispered
"No," Potter rubbed the back of his neck. He was back to frowning at the hearth. "But now the Ministry is the new prejudiced bastard pushing people around. I'm fucking tired of bullies."
"Well fine, so maybe not that one, but-"
"Shut up, Malfoy!" Potter sounded almost cheerful. "I'm moving in."
Their eyes met. Some long forgotten part of Draco's brain still holding on to ancient grudges was finally able to make an old connection.
“Hogwarts?” suggested Ron, breaking up the staring contest.
“Malfoy, it’s too bloody early for this,” he grumbled, annoyance apparently starting to gain on embarrassment.
Potter had nightmares. Horrible, fucking
, Harry said to himself, irritated, and pushed to his feet.
"I shared this very house you are so hellbent on saving with Voldemort, did you forget that?" Potter shot him a dark look.
“This ‘right’ of yours. I asked if I could give her your address, and you said I could. So what is it now?”
stupid cursive scrawl. (You might have at least changed the way you write “Potter”, it’s hardly changed since we were fourteen.)
A distressed Potter was tossing and turning. Draco rolled his eyes and this time started by putting Potter's wand out of his reach.
“I hate this house,” Harry’s voice almost didn’t carry, it was so low.
THUMP.
Which, in Harry’s opinion, was code for: Lucius would try to do it himself, and the results were unpredictable. Harry scrubbed his face with both his hands, already exhausted, and gave a loud groan. “Fine," he said, at last, adjusting his crooked glasses. He then fixed Draco with a determined glare.
“Yes.”
"Do shut your mouth, won't you Potter? You'll get flies in it." He drawled, trying to give the bane of his existence the most disdainful look he could produce.
Which brings us back to that October evening. Draco had fallen into the habit of leaving the backdoor open. The dog would take a stroll around the neighbourhood, do his business somewhere far away from Malfoy’s sensibilities, and come back when it wanted to. Except for that night it didn’t. The world seemed to be trying to rain itself to an end, and it was bloody
jumped in front of Harry just to protect him, not even five minutes ago.
"Articulated as always, eh?" Blaise was having way too much fun with the situation, in Draco's opinion. Even if Potter had the eloquence of a baboon.
And seeing as we never quite completed our chat about those photos you took that first night...
“You know, I think he is alright,” Harry said on Friday, munching on a sandwich. He, Ron, and Hermione were having a late lunch in his office. “Weird, but alright.”
He wasn’t there in the morning either, which caused Harry to get so annoyed he gave up on the meal entirely and went to the Ministry particularly bad-tempered. He proceeded to snap at every co-worker unlucky enough to cross his path and was finally sent out to do surveillance on an illegal potions case by an exasperated Ron. Of course, the moment Harry found a good spot on an alley and put up some notice-me-not charms, the fine weather they had been enjoying that October decided to take a turn to the worse. Harry went home early, cold, and miserable, and not at all cheered by the thought of having to face Draco again.
Do you want to meet up, grab a coffee, or some brunch somewhere? We can then discuss the negotiations for the photos. In the sunlight. With no chance of either of us getting distracted. At all.
“Stop being idiots.”
“Yes. Ronald and I…” he made a face at Ron, who was slowly shuffling away from Draco, looking guiltily at his friends. “Fine,
Harry discovered that if he came into Draco’s room early in the morning and bribed him with a cup of tea full of milk and sugar, he would get up and agree to join Harry for breakfast. He would follow sleepily in his pyjamas, body warm and pliant as Harry manoeuvred him into the dining room.
Draco paused for a second to glance at him. Astoria was clearly a sore topic, and Harry didn’t even know why.
Harry
“I’m not so sure about the non-bleeding part,” said Draco, finally moving away. Harry was left feeling distinctly deprived and grimaced.
“What the fuck Malfoy, I’m right here!” Harry protested, rubbing the sore spot.
“Kreacher!” bellowed Harry, just to go into a fit of coughing. This fucking night,
"You were supposed to have access to your personal vault," his voice was harsh and at his sides, his hands were closed in tight fists.
“Put it on my weird ‘Chosen One’ nonsense tab.” He suggested, and Draco huffed but didn’t argue.
“Ron, I can’t believe you!” shrieked Hermione. Draco looked from her shocked expression to the dark rage building on Harry’s face.
Chapter 6
"Oh,” Draco said quietly. Potter arched an eyebrow when Draco turned to look at him. He seemed to be saying
Draco Malfoy was decidedly
caused him to lose his shirt and you drooled like a commoner?”
"Draco, darling-" Pansy ducked when a huge chunk of wood flew by alarmingly close to her head. "Please can we just sit down and discuss this for a minute?"
"Because it's humiliating," shouted Draco, reaching fresh levels of distress. "I already owe you enough! I took the wrong side of the war! I had to sit there and listen to you defending me at the Wizengamot even though I didn't deserve it! I have to count down every knut to be able to eat! Do you think I have the funds to re-roof the Manor?! My house is crumbling down on top of me and I can't get out, I can't fix it and I just want you to
Flat out shout.
"You were rubbing your Saviour plonker between my unaware arse cheeks Potter, that's what I'm on about!"
Chapter 5
“Malfoy, sodding hell, what the-”
“What is this dishonor now?”
“I am Potter!” Harry yelled angrily. “Did you go completely mental?!”
“Yes,” he breathed out, and finally managed to open his eyes. The room was lit by dim light, and Draco’s face was hovering over his. He was biting his lips and frowning. Harry hadn’t seen this expression on his face since his Voldemort visions during the war. It was heart-breaking. Somewhere out of his sight, the dog was whining piteously.
“Hermione,” he nodded towards her, before taking back his sit in the armchair next to Harry’s bed. “Where’s the ginger one?”
Draco, for his part, continued to work. He travelled a bit. Got banned from Spain after his dog peed in an Ambassador’s side table. It was an antique, and the man was very crossed indeed. Draco then figured out, after many lost galleons on boots, that the stupid animal would just as happily chew on potatoes - of all things -, if only Draco supplied him with a big enough stock.
“Well. Yes, thanks, Kreacher.” Harry said quickly before the elf decided to break down in song. Kreacher bowed before disappearing. “No breaches then, see.”
“You know. Potter’s Twig and Berries? His Throbbing Whistle. The Purple-”
“Erm… I’m remodelling Grimmauld Place?” Potter asked while accepting a plate filled high with eggs and toast.
"Good grief Potter, don't look like you've just seen somebody kick a crup.
(See the end of the chapter for
thought Draco to himself.
“I’m never giving you another hand job. Ever. And see if I care when you end up screaming in your sleep.” Harry smiled broadly at him.
Malfoy,
“He should be slowing down, not taking up more obligations,” Harry muttered from behind his hands.
Back at the library after his bath, ready for supper and sleep, Draco found one Harry Potter standing awkwardly next to a table filled with snacks. He stopped on his tracks.
"Move over," Draco said in an annoyed tone.
"I'm going to burn this fucking place to ashes," he half exclaimed, half groaned, arching his back and struggling with the weight of the axe while trying to take impulse for another hit.
angry, or have you forgotten?” Harry scowled at that, and Draco scowled back.
“We could put him in a safe house.”
“M’fine.” He mumbled, struggling to sit up. His vision swam and nausea suddenly gripped him. Draco hurried to help him, hissing at him to wait. “Just a dream,” he said after a brief pause where Draco conjured an alarming amount of pillows for Harry to lean against.
A blonde head suddenly popped from behind a wood plank, giving Pansy another start. Draco looked at her with a manic glint in his eyes.
“Where is that blasted dog?” Draco interrupted, closing and shrinking his trunk. He took a few steps towards the hallway, squinting in the direction of the backyard. “Usually, I can’t take one step without tripping over him, but
"Well? What are you waiting for? Trumpets announcing the way to the gates?" Draco asked, exasperated. Potter was still smiling a bit, green eyes extra bright in the morning light, and that made Draco irrationally angry all over again. He needed to have a word with his Healer. Clearly the man was an incompetent buffoon.
Chapter five.
and if you'd like to scream at us some more, here are our tumblrs:
“Thank you,” said Draco, helping himself and settling beside one of the counters with a contented sigh. “No dogs in the kitchen,” he added firmly, and Harry turned around in time to see dog-Potter halt and sit down next to the kitchen’s entrance.
“I’d never seen anything like that. Harry, it really looked like you were dying.” Harry jumped a bit when Draco’s fingers touched his arm, stroking him. Draco didn’t seem to be conscious of his actions, eyes distant and forehead wrinkled in thought. Harry sent a surreptitious glance at his friends, to check if they were aware of this new development, but they were paying him no mind. Well.
Draco stared from Hermione’s earnest expression to Weasley’s suddenly mollified nodding. Turned to Potter, who was studiously not meeting his eyes. His face was darkening to an intriguing beet-red shade.
“Draco?” Harry said a while later.
"P-Potter?" his sheets tangled around his legs when he made to get out of the bed. The library was in disquieting darkness, and all Draco could see was an unfocused shape twisting next to him. "Shit. Potter! Wake the hell up!"
“And the Killing Curse made him disappear,” Hermione murmured, sounding thoughtful. “It makes no sense. Draco, are you sure you cast correctly? It’s not an easy curse to perform.”
used to live…”
“That eats like a savage, shows no regard for rules, proper etiquette, or antiques, really,” Draco continued evenly, completely ignoring Harry’s outburst. “And most of all,
"I did not!" Potter protested, flushing bright red and sitting up. "I- I would never. I don't even like-" Potter gave a mean glare and finally exploded:
“All the more reason to fix this.” Hermione gave a frustrated sigh and closed the book she’d been studying. She nicked some chips from Ron’s plate. “We have nothing. He can’t live with you forever.”
“I’ll check if you have any new cases today and bring them back to you,” Harry said, at last, unable to bear another second of the stiff mood between them. Draco half turned towards him, staring at Harry as if he had no recollection of ever meeting him before.
“Who just sacrificed so much to keep the whole of the wizarding world safe.” Draco scowled at that. His therapist raised an eyebrow, not in the least intimidated.
“Mate, you even have wards against ghosts!” Ron tried to reason when it looked like Harry might explode right then and there. “
Draco pursed his lips in an unhappy line but acquiesced.
“I can’t feel it,” he said and searched for Draco’s eyes, spooked. Draco was staring back at him in stunned silence. His grip on Harry’s arm was so tight it hurt. Harry supposed he should be glad his nerves were still functioning on the rest of his limbs.
“Yes,
He pointedly refused to acknowledge the small part of his mind that was feeling very grateful indeed at not being forced to spend another night alone in this mausoleum of a house. Draco transfigured another bed for himself – this one positively cozy, - and fell asleep before Potter returned.
Draco huffed and went to his own side of the library. He sulked for a minute, grinding his teeth. Potter was leaning against the bedframe, and by the looks of his frown, he was equally bad-tempered.
But trust me, making badges that said
“Maybe she’s right, you know. This bloke doesn’t seem to be targeting anyone but you.”
I know what you did last Saturday night.
“What do you mean, my room is full of dark magic?” asked Harry, a bit indignant. “I hired professionals to clean up Grimmauld place after the war.”
"None of your bloody business! Away with you!"
…" Draco sighed mid-sentence. Shrugged. "Fine. Yes. Doesn't change what we did at the beginning."
“Right. I should feel sympathy for my assaulter. I apologize if my heart is not quite that
“Who was that?” I spin around to find Harry, dripping on the carpet, glasses steamed up, with a bath towel round his waist – his protruding ribs reminding me how bad he's gotten. Gone is the soft but very visible strength from his quidditch training days.
Draco reveals himself to be soft and Harry remembers some things.
'Um, well I've had this record for a really long time now, but I've never, ah had a record player to hear it on and I was wondering, you don't have to say yes, I realise it's not really your style and if you do-' Harry cut him off by tugging it out of his arms, taking Ziggy Stardust off the player, and gently lowering Draco's vinyl on to the player.
“That I could hear? You only went ten paces Potter” He looked at his feet and Harry felt a pang of pity.
Hermione had called at their room again a few days earlier to try and talk to Harry, but he had promptly shut himself in the bathroom shaking his head vehemently at Draco as he answered the door.
That’s strangely comforting to know, that I’m not the only one being driven mad by memories, and flashbacks. No, not even memories, cruel fabrications planted in my mind by months of revisiting the warped version of the war I experienced. Dreams where Hermione is attacked by Bellatrix except, in this version, she doesn’t make it out alive; mudblood isn’t confined to her arm, its scrawled across her cheeks, her belly, her thighs and chest. Her corpse is dropped at Shell Cottage – the starter for another nightmare, where Bill and Fleur’s home is compromised all because of him.
“Don’t let my mother hear you say that” he’s saying, grinning. “I think she’d have a heart attack”
because of you and your stupid,
“When did you last eat a proper meal?” Harry could feel his eyes on my shoulder blades as he paused, hand on the door.
Draco stared nervously and chewed his lip. God, Harry was going to think he was an even bigger loser than he already was.
“Here”
. I know I can help him, I know I can!”
Harry looked slightly mollified as they sat down at the Slytherin table with Blaise and Pansy and began helping himself to mashed potato. Whilst his eating habits had improved, he still had a tendency to pass food surreptitiously to Draco when it got a bit much. So far Blaise and Pansy hadn’t noticed and if they had they hadn’t said anything.
war” He turned away and took severel deep breaths.
(See the end of the chapter for
'It's my violin,' he said, not facing Harry, 'I've had to play it since I was about seven and used to really hate it but now...um'
He smiles, and I can’t help but feel he’s laughing at me, mocking me for the way I’m trying my best to make amends, even in the tiniest ways.
Draco leans crookedly in the doorway, head on the side and Harry looks up, unsure of how long he’s been there. He smiles and Harry doesn't know how to feel.
when they came around to help. I shut them out in the hope you'd all forget about me and live your lives; the lives they’d always dreamed of, before Volde-bloody-mort got in the way and they spent last year camping'.
“what?”
'Well, if you must know, I'm more of a classical music man myself' Draco flushed at looked at Harry, abashed but truthfully.
“Sorry, if you think I’m not serious Potter” I glare at him, “I want to make an actual effort this year, so if you don’t mind, I’ll be calling you Harry. Ok?”
“You’re calling them by their names?” He’s looking at me, squinting slightly as he wipes his specs off on his towel. “That’s really nice of you Malfoy”
“hmm” Says Draco making wry eye contact with Harry over his goblet. He feels a slight flair in his chest as he realises what this means. Draco maybe, just maybe, considered him a friend. Or maybe has just decided to tolerate him and feels sorry for Harry.
“Neither of you know what its like to have no purpose. The war ended, and I no longer had a use. I wasn’t
‘Yes!’
When I remerge from the bathroom, Harry is in bed, glasses off, squinting at a crusty old parchment. He’s absorbed completely and doesn’t seem to notice me putting my stuff away in the various drawers, sliding my violin discreetly under the bed.
“You did, but I hope you’ll accept that those burns are worse than they look, not that you would look!” the cold mask of the pureblood heir slid back in to place and Harry was reminded that this is the boy who has spent his entire life getting his own way. The hard look unnerved him, and he looked away, accepting that, yes, it is
, because that coffee burned you, I can tell by the way you shouted.” He’s cleverer than Harry thought, not used to anyone noticing.
“No Mr. Finnegan, not on this occasion.” Her voice was sharp, and Harry could tell she expected at a little
‘Oh shut up, just because I beat you in the last five homeworks!’
They sat like that for a while, nibbling their way through Every Favour beans and a couple more frogs. The whistle blew, signaling the approach to Hogwarts, but neither boy had their robes on, let alone any room for the welcome feast.
of women who pine for you.” Pansy smirked and looked at Harry, albeit with mild confusion.
“I’m sorry, I just didn’t think that this would be your ideal situation either? You know?” He stated, reasoning that he probably wasn’t high on Draco's bff list.
It’s a voice in the darkness and it sends sparks flying up and down my spine. The hoarse whisper of the Dark Lord fills my brain and I suddenly I need to get out of this room. I stand up and try to push my way through the heavy, suffocating velvet of the bed hangings. The material seems to grow heavier and thicker as I keep pushing getting lost in the cloying scent of mothballs; my eyes are stinging, I can feel my eyeballs; His voice echoes through the room now, taunting me, telling me Harry Potter will die tonight Draco…he will perish…why do you resist dear Draco…he will go and there is nothing you can so to save him…stop running Draaco…Draco…Draco…Draco!
It’s clear Malfoy's not willing to open up, so he's left to himself as Harry sits there, face blotchy and red trying to scrape some composure up off the floor. Harry watched as he takes the overflowing rubbish bags out back, to the bins. He could’ve just vanished them? Just as he could’ve vanished the dust.
edit: sorry for the almighty gap between posting but 4 should be arriving soon :)
Draco twisted round from the front seat. “you all right there, Potter?” he checks with a grin which Harry can’t bring myself to return. Harry's mind continues to whirr;' why Draco is being so nice? I mean we’re enemies? Enemies don’t suddenly become friends. That’s not how it works.'
“Oh really?” eyebrows raised.
and you couldn’t be bothered to stick it out with Hermione and me. You’d rather run back to Mummy because you don’t know what it’s like to lead your friends in to basically certain death on the orders of a man who manipulated you your
The song is David Bowie - Five Years (strongly reccomend it made me cry the first time i heard it hehe)
He nodded, walked to the end of his bed, watched Harry lie back once again - eyes open this time - and began to play.
‘I was only trying to help, I’m sorry…’He tried to talk to Draco running after him as he marched away. ‘Draco, I’m sorry, listen to me, I thought I was being helpful! Please!’
----------------------------------------------------
A black car pulled up outside and a man ducked out of the front seat. White-blond hair and a grey hoodie tugged at something in my mind; it was on the tip of his tongue as he peered out of the window, but he couldn’t find the words. It wasn’t until the boy pushed his mop of curls out of his eyes, sunglasses perched precariously on top, did it click. Draco fucking Malfoy. When he’d asked for assistance getting to school Harry thought they’d send Hagrid maybe, but no. A bloody car and Malfoy was what he got.
“Why are you doing this for me?” Harry asked him quietly as he drank tea and Draco busied himself clearing the kitchen table and wiping away the dust from the mantlepiece.
Ugh. Stupid Potter. Idiotic Potter. Why did he have to shower straight away? I’m still lying face down on my bed when I hear a knock at the door and an impatient voice call;
He leant in once more, “Fred is gone. George can’t stand himself and its all. Your. Fault.” He chocked the words out and his spittle landed on Harry's cheek. And that’s it. Harry suddenly snapped and he lost control.
I laugh and look up as Draco clenches his jaw and doesn’t say anything as Blaise and Pansy begin arguing over the toast. I’m trying to eat something when Draco nudges my foot under the table and mouths ‘you ok?’ at me. I smile and take a big bite of my toast, chewing and swallowing even as it turns to glue in my mouth. He watches as I finish the slice of toast and gives me a small smile. I’m not sure if he cares or if I just looked a bit green which is quite likely, but as we walk out of the hall he drops a little ‘well done’ into my ear as we all make our way to potions. Ah. So he realises. He knew. Of course he knew. He’s Draco fucking Malfoy and I practically told him on the train.
“Thanks? Uh, Potter, straight?” He blushed and looked down as Draco raised an eyebrow. “for now, at least”
'So, Draco' Harry began, 'what is your genre of choice? classic rock? indie pop?'
Hermione nodded, and there ensued a long and detailed conversation about Harry's shortcomings in potion making and many other gripes besides. Almost 15 minutes later, Draco opened the door to a very disgruntled Harry.
“Just that you look tired but now you ask I’d say, exhausted and,” he took a breath, “look, can I come inside?”
Draco stuck his tongue out but began to read, pulling out his wand and lightly tapping the parchment making corrections as he went. They sat like that in companionable silence, Harry gathering up the scattered sheet music and putting it back in order, Draco humming softly and correcting Harry’s half-finished essay. Occasionally Harry would look over and watch Draco push his thick, curly hair out of his eyes as he wrote, and Draco would catch sight of Harry screwing up his nose to push his glasses back up his face as he counted quietly under his breath. Neither boy said anything for a long time.
“Potter” he starts “you look…”
“Me? No, why would you…no…I’m not eve…no….stupid Potter” He muttered and Harry could practically hear the blood rushing to his cheeks.
‘I hope you liked it, it was a little dodgy especially at the beginning but-’ He was cut off as Harry leapt up from the floor, shaking his head.
“Oh, Malfoy? Thankyou.” She smiles again, this time softer and more genuine, before waving and leaving. ‘I’ll see you tomorrow! Early morning potions class!’
The notes were sprightly and his fingers crossed the strings with an incredible agility, leaving nothing to chance. His hands seemed to settle into the music, shifting up and down the strings, stretching and twisting to accommodate the two notes. His bow flew through the air, the bounce creating the beautiful running scales and shapes that seemed to be no effort at all to Draco. The longer he played the more natural it seemed and the more Harry couldn’t believe he had ever been sceptical of the blond boys talent. His face reflected the emotion of the music, his nose screwing up slightly at the trickier passages. He came to a close with a final flourish of his bow and lowered his instrument, chest rising and falling as he looked back at Harry.
Her awkward attempts at conversation all fizzled out, and they passed the journey listening to the soft murmurs of Neville and Luna, and the rattle of the harnesses. Harry's mind turned to the question of rooming for eighth year. They don't have enough of us returning to warrant four different house dorms, but what other alternative werethere?
, simple? It occurs to Harry that he hasn’t used magic since he got here. Maybe the ministry has his wand; they don’t quite trust him.
“dra...uh…Malfoy?” Harry stuttered and Draco doesn’t meet my eye in the mirror.
“awful I know.” Harry cut across him and avoided his eye. He couldn't see why he had to tolerate Draco Malfoy after everything that had happened.
‘Don’t worry about it Harry. I’ll tell you in the morning’ I say, I cant bring myself to endure the pity and possible, no definite, fear it would cause. ‘Thankyou for the chocolate, I um, I really appreciate it.’
were out of bed?”
"Sure,” Potter had the gall to grin at him. He picked up the baskets Ron had set on the floor. "You can throw me in that Manor bonfire. Kitchen?"
Harry was back at the Forbidden Forest. The wood’s floor was covered in chilly mist, and his surroundings were so quiet, Harry could hear his own heartbeat. He sighed, shoulders slumping. He was back on one of those dreams.
. At 8 o’clock, Draco gave up all pretence of his indifference and went in search of the vexing animal.
Draco nodded, feeling relieved at the implied request. Bartering goods – a much more enjoyable activity than this endless aid receiving indignity.
Draco shrugged and whispered
"Redecorating, apparently," said Potter from his place near a window, smirking. He was twirling his wand in his fingers, completely unconcerned about Draco's previous intimidation techniques. Weasley laughed and turned to Draco.
“Get off me, Potter!” The dog sat down, untroubled by Draco’s fury, and waved his tail rapidly, seeming incredibly pleased with himself. “Just you wait, I’ll live to go to your funeral, you’ll see!”
"Zabini, I swear to Salazar-" BOOM. Another bean caved. Somewhere down to Pansy's left, Draco could be heard cackling.
They spent a couple more hours discussing theories back and forth, Harry getting more and more sleepy. Draco manhandled him up the stairs at some point, scolding Harry about his ridiculous notion that it was appropriate to fall asleep on one’s living room floor.
"Doesn't matter," Draco whispered. Potter was already asleep.
"Really, Potter," he drawled. "Are you taking these excellent danger-detecting instincts of yours to the Aurory?"
just used the term
“… Fucking lunatic,” Harry breathed out, a smile tugging one side of his lips. They fell into a lazy silence. Draco would adamantly deny it if questioned later, but he had linked his fingers through Potter’s and was felling rather cuddly.
of that man, honestly.
“But Harry,” said Hermione tentatively, interrupting them before the argument escalated. “If the wards aren’t holding-”

‘Coming Potter?’ He asks obnoxiously as I struggle to pull on my own shoes, ‘wouldn’t want to be late for breakfast.’
‘It’s nothing’ he says awkwardly, before pulling the covers up to his chin and rolling over to face the wall. ‘Bedtime reading’
“I don’t really think that Draco Malfoy is the best roommate for me?” he ventured, not quite meeting her eye.
“I know you’ve been crying Potter” He said, eying the blotchy mess that once again constituted Harry's face.
“Hannah Abbott and Padma Patel” not quite as enthusiastic, but maybe a newly cautious friendship is good?
The journey up to the castle passed in a tense, awkward silence. Ron glowered at Harry from time to time, and ignored him at others. Harry felt bad for Hermione, though; because if there’s anyone who deserved a peaceful eighth year, it was her.
“Thanks.” Silently they make our way up to the rooms.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'Ah. No longer welcome until I
‘Didn’t think I’d leave you alone that fast Potter?’ He smirks and starts to settle, leaving me with a curious blooming feeling in my chest.
Silence.
“Why not?”
“Bertie Botts’ Every Flavour Bean?” Draco held out a bag of the brightly coloured beans.
He glanced at Draco as he flipped through the stack of now orderly music and made a mental note to thank him later. Draco had his shirtsleeves rolled up, something that had escaped Harry’s notice earlier and he suddenly panicked as they left the library,
“Lavender Brown and Parvati Patel” Air punches and a rush of feet accompany the first pairing, closely followed by an outburst of chattering as hopes soar.
“We’ll see you in a bit yeah?” Ron puts a hand on Harry's back like an uninterested acquaintance, as he followed Hermione to sit next to Dean and Seamus.
He wrote. Stopped. Ate a chocolate frog. Wrote a bit more. Then heard animated whispering approaching from behind the shelves. Harry’s ears pricked, and he listened in, not caring if it was interesting – just that it was a distraction. However, he could hear Hermione’s voice scolding and low and someone’s chastised response.
He felt a curious spark in his chest as Draco looked at him, flushed and grinning bashfully. His hair had come down, the curls spilling over his ears as he bent down to put his violin away.
not sure if anyone actually likes this but im having fun
“Sorry, Hermione but I don’t think its going to work this year.” Harry looked down at his feet and back in Hermione's desperate eyes.
Harry stared and took in the tender way Draco held and handled the violin, turning it over in his long dexterous hands, plucking the strings and lifting it to his shoulder to tune.
Sorry for the long wait amigos, but thanks for all the support! <3<3
“When did you last eat properly” He’s not afraid to ask now, but Harry didn’t want to answer that. He was sure Draco wouldn’t understand anyway.
Harry is standing with two steaming mugs of something that smells like chocolate and something else I can’t place, he hands me one.
